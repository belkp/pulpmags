Mr Cooke:—
Age or Lack of Education No Handicap
 No matter how old or how young you are, or what education you have, there is a real I
 future for you in electricity. If you can read and write I can put you on the road to'
 success. I can help you to a position that will make people admire you and look up to you.
   When t enrolled with you less than a year
ago I was a common mechanic earning $25
to $30 a ueek. Today I am an "Electrical Ex-
pert" with a business of my own that gives me
a clear profit of over $750 a month.
   I have more work than lean do. The people
around Chehalis come to me to fix their start-
ers. generators and ignition troubles because
they know that I know how to do it right.
   My success, I one to you, Mr. Cooke. The
thorough practical training which you gave me
through your Easily-learned HomeStudyCourse
in Electricity has made me an independent,
highly respected business man in this com-
munity. Sincerely yours, W E. Pence

BRIGHT LIGHTS
BY ROBERT ORR CHIPPERFIELD
      is a novel as scintillant and provocative as its title. It illumines the lives of characters
      as real as your own social circle. And if you do not already know the heroine, you
      surely have seen her. She is the girl who turns toward the bright lights as the sun-
      flower to the sun, if not as the moth to the flame.

“w;
HY, that’s my third increase in a
year! It just shows what special train-
ing will do for a man. When I left
school to go to work I couldn’t do anything in
particular. All I could hope for was just a job
—and that’s what I got, at $60 a month for
routine, unskilled work. I stayed at it for three
years, with one small increase each year.
  “Then one day I woke up. I found I wasn’t
getting ahead simply because I couldn’t do any
one thing well. I decided right then to put in
an hour after supper each night preparing
myself for more important work. So I wrote
to Scranton and arranged for a course that
would give me special training for our business.
  “Why, in a few months I had a whole new
vision of my work and its possibilities. You
see, I was just beginning to really understand
it. I made some suggestions to the manager
and he was immensely pleased. Said he had
noticed how much better I was doing lately
and wished he had more like me.
  “Just after that an opening came and he
gave me my chance—at an increase of $25 a
month. Then I really began to grow. Six
months later I was put in charge of my de-
partment and my salary went up again. Since
then I’ve had two increases of $50 a month
and now I’ve got another $50 raise!”
  For 31 years the International Correspond-
ence Schools have been helping men and women
everywhere to win promotion, to earn more
money, to have happy, prosperous homes, to
know the joy of getting ahead in business and
in life.
  More than two million have taken the up
road with I. C. S. help. More than 180,000 are
now turning their spare time to profit. Hun-
dreds are starting every day. Isn’t it about
time for you to find out what the I. C. S. can
do for you?
  Here is all we ask—the chance to prove it—
without obligation on your part or a penny of
cost. Just mark and mail the coupon printed
below and full particulars will come to you by

    His Startling Stories—10 Full Size *
    Volumes Beautifully Bound In
    Maroon Cloth—Short Time Offer.
  Biggest book bargain over offered. We challenge anyone
 to produce tlie same set at this amazing price! Not pocket
 size books: not paper bound, not cheap in anything but
 price! Includes 17 stories never before printed in English,
 2‘il short stories—5 big novels.
   .Maupassant, more than any other writer, dared to rip aside
 the veil of convention and tell the naked truth. He held
 the mirror up to nature—portraying life openly yet never
 making vice attractive—never passing Judgment. Mis storie3
 of Parisian high life, of the underworld, the Orient, the high
 seas, the jungles, are realistic; as delightfully human as they
 are bold.
  Frankest of Frenchmen
  Maupassant startled the
 world with his boldness and
 m a d c humanity
 gasp because he
 wrote from first-
 hand observation
 a n d experience.
 The situations he
 created are true-
 to-life situations.
 His characters are
 real people—most-
 ly young people—
 like those you see
 around you every
 day.
   Ideal Gift For
   Christmas!
 SurprlKe your friend* with
 this handsome 10 volume
 net of I)o Maupannant.
 Tasteful — inexpensive —
 hringft joy all year * round!
 Save« you money, time
 and worry. Order today
 before the few remaining
 sctM are snatched up.
  Maupassant stands alone
          as a creator of thrills—of a
          veritable tumult
          o f emotion: a
          drama of startling
          contrasts; a train
          of closely-packed,
          swiftly moving ep-
          isodes. Me wasted
          no time flirting:
          around the edges
          of life. And his
          stories are the
          most startling that
          ever came from a
          writer’s pen!

ARE you fat? You shouldn’t be. Without
rigorous dieting or exercise—by a simple
natural process—you should quickly and
easily be able to have the slender fashionable
figure that is so attractive.
  Scientists have discovered that excess fat is often caused bv the
subnormal action of a small gland. Once this island is healthy
and functioning properly, your weight should reduce naturally and
without effort on your part, to the normal amount for your height
  And science has discovered a simple extract which tends to
regulate the gland that controls fat. Without lifting a hand in
unnecessary and violent exercise, you should find it a delightfully
simple matter to have the ideal, slender figure admired by
everyone.
  The wonderful thing about the scientific formula known as
Rid-O-Fat Is that in losing your superfluous fat you should gain
added vigor, health and energy of mind and body.
Feel Young—Look Young
  There Is nothing which adds to a person's age so much as fat.
A few extra pounds makes any man or woman look from five to
ten years older Not only that, the excess weight and Increased
heart action saps vitality and energy.
  Once the gland which controls your fat Is functioning
pro|M*rly your food should be turned into firm, solid flesh and
muscle. As your weight comes down to normal you should ex-
perience a delightful and amazing improvement in your appearance.
You should not only feel and look younger—you should actually
l>e vounger. You should also be in b-tter health—a real health
of energy—not the fictitious and deceiving health of fat that in-
surance companies say shortens the life ten years.
  Complexion, health and figure are improved at the same time.
Th«» result is new vitality, magnetism and personal charm that
imk-'s for success. Tasks once hard becomo easy and life worth
while.

Arresting Pain with
“ Concentrated Sunlight ”
INSTEAD of hot water, messy
1 poultices, intolerable plasters,
etc., modern medical science to-
day uses a new, clean and in-
finitely more effective method of
relieving pain.
  It is—Radiant Heat and Light,
as perfectly produced by the
Stein-O-Lite.
    Why Stein-O-Lite
    Is more effective
   Old-fashioned hot applications, whllo
helpful, havo little penetrative power.
They heat the surface hut do not touch
the seat of pain. Stein-O-Lite's magic
rays do! They get right down into the
throbbing tissues and break up the
congestion thru stimulation. You can
actually feel tho pain-shot tissues relax
and tho pain die out as the warm, mel-
low rays—golden as tropical sunlight—
play upon the tender area. Clean as
sunlight, safe as sunlight, pleasant as
sunlight—Stein-O-Lite does the work.
Now Steln-O-IJte
can become your flr«t aid
  Because Stein-O-Lite rays cannot burn
or irritate tho skin (see why in panel
text) any individual can uso it. For
the pains of little ones as well an
grown-ups. Think of its convenience.
t«K>—Just screw a plug into a light socket,
turn the switch and a flood of pain-
soothing light starts to work.

CHAPTER I.
SVEND THE BLOODY.
BILLOW upon billow the mist rolled
away from the fiord, up over the
rocky beach, over the wooded slope,
on and up into the hills where the dense
green forest shielded black aisles in which
wild beasts frolicked and evil spirits out-
cast by Odin and Thor held sinister sway.
  Now the waters of the fiord danced and
sparkled in the sudden glory of the rising
sun, and sea fowl commenced their raucous
squawkings as they breakfasted and fought.
1 A	i
Sleepy thralls appeared about the great es-
tablishment of Svend the Bloody, the big
log house at the edge of the dark forest
with its half score of smaller out buildings.
Smoke issued from vents in the sloping
roof. The odor of scorching meat stole
through the air.
  The huge gates were thrown open and
dogs charged forth to snap and snarl at
one another as they took their morning run.
Sheep and swine wandered slowly toward
the edge of the wood for forage. Horses
fed in the clearing.
  The rays of the bright sun glanced from

ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
metal as a man at arms shifted battle-ax
from shoulder to shoulder. A shield
maiden came forth in gleaming corselet and
bright kirtle and heavy sandals, her fair
hair streaming down her back and almost
to her knees. She followed a trail through
the brush to a rushing stream that tumbled
down from the hills—the bathing place of
the maidens, where they plunged, laughing
and shouting, into the melted ice and snow.
  Far away on the headland, a tall and
slender thrall stood to his feet as the mist
rose out of the sea, shaded his eyes with
his hands, and looked long at the ship in
the offing. Then he buckled his leather
belt tighter, made certain that his sandals
were secure, turned, inhaled a deep breath
—and ran.
  He was high above the shore of the fiord,
yet he knew the country well. And not for
nothing had he been named the Swift. His
elbows glued to his sides, his head bent
slightly backward, his torso held straight—
he knew the proper method of running, al-
beit that it was natural with him and not
a thing acquired.
  On he ran, skipping brooks where the
melted snow had come down from the head-
lands to swell the flood. He darted through
second growth timber that had grown since
the great fire in the forest years before. He
sprang over jumbles of rocks and fought
the tangling vines and tall ferns.
  On he ran; and now he descended rapid-
ly toward the level of the water. In the
far distance he could see curls of smoke
from the chimneys of the house of Svend
the Bloody. The thrall’s breathing was
more rapid now, and the perspiration
streamed down his cheeks and along his
throat. His hands were clenched so that
the nails bit into the palms. Still he ran,
nor slackened his speed, knowing well what
would occur if he did.
  Presently he reached the rocky beach
and went forward at a much greater pace,
darting to this side and that to avoid the
rougher places. Once he stumbled, but
caught himself before he fell. Again he
staggered, but when his knees and palms
touched the ground he sprang erect again,
crouched, and once more he ran.
  Now he was compelled to swim a swift
stream some thirty feet in width. Emerg-
ing on the opposite bank, he took a deep
breath and hurried on. Dogs barked and
ran to race with him, snapping at his heels.
Other thralls squinted their eyes as he
passed, for greater expression of interest
was denied them and might bring a blow.
Men in armor shouted at him, and men at
arms, but the thrall gave no heed. He had
important news for Svend the Bloody, and
for no other man. And as he ran hope
sang in his breast—hope of reward.
  The ship had been reported just at dusk
the night before, and had anchored to await
the coming of the dawn. Svend the Bloody
had sent his thrall to the headland to watch
for the day and carry true news. Now, in
the great hall of the house, Svend sat with
his back against the thick wall, eating his
morning meat. Cringing thralls served
him. Magnus, his chief lieutenant, sat at
his elbow and imitated him. There was no
talk, no sound save of men eating with no
regard for table manners.
  The thrall dashed through the huge log
gates and into the great hall. Almost
breathless, he prostrated himself before
Svend. Another hundred feet he could not
have gone. He gasped for breath and
hoped that his master would give him a mo-
ment before causing him to speak.
  Svend the Bloody put aside the joint of
half-cooked meat from which he had been
eating. He scraped his giant hands on the
edge of the board and looked down at the
thrall. Magnus, his lieutenant, copied
Svend’s actions.
  “ Speak!” Svend commanded.
  The thrall raised his head and gulped for
breath with which to give the message.
  “ Master, I saw the ship in the first rays
of the sun,” he said.
  “ It is my ship?”
  “ It is, master!”
  “ The one that I sent to Gaul?”
  “ Even that one, master,” the thrall re-
plied. “ I know the ship well. When she
was building, I worked on her with the
others. It is the ship, and none other.”
Svend the Bloody got upon his feet and
moved slowly forward. He was a giant of
a man even in that land of giants, with the
shoulders of an ox. His fair hair and shag-
THE BLACK JARL,
gy beard were noted for their length. He
clenched his hands and flexed the muscles
of his great arms, then stood for a moment
with his hairy fists planted against his hips,
looking down at the thrall.
  “ It is the news that I expected,” Svend
said. “ You made fair speed here as soon
as you were sure?”
  “ I ran with all my strength, master, to
fetch the news.”
  “ You have done well,” Svend the Bloody
told him. “ It is your moment of triumph!
You, a thrall, a common slave, have car-
ried important news to your master. You
deserve a reward!”
  The eyes of the thrall glistened.
  “ If only that I might see my Normandy
again, master!” he begged. “If I might
but have my freedom now, and permission
to go to my home on some ship—”
  Svend the Bloody suddenly laughed rau-
cously, and Magnus joined in. The big
jarl’s merriment rang back from the thick
walls. Though it was laughter, yet the
thrall felt a shiver of fear.
  “ So you would leave your kind master
and the fair land in which he rules! ” Svend
said. “ Thrall, this is your hour of
triumph, as I have said. You have done
well. Were you to continue on earth, you
might mar that fair record.”
  “Master!” The thrall was alarmed
now.
  “You are a swift messenger, and Odin
has need of such,” Svend continued. “ We
are not supposed to make sacrifices to him
now, so our king, Olaf Trygvesson, says.
That half-Christian monarch who is build-
ing him a city at Trondhjem would tell
free-born jarls their manner of conduct in
things religious. Yet such a deed as this
of yours calls for a sacrifice.”
  “ Master!” the thrall wailed.
  “ And so, Magnus,” the jarl continued,
turning to the man beside him, “ we are
compelled to conduct ourselves with strate-
gy. An indirect sacrifice, as a man might
say. Should not this thrall be sent to the
thralls’ Valhalla, wherever that is, in the
moment of his greatness?”
  “ Nothing could be more appropriate,
Svend,” Magnus replied, laughing.
  The thrall began whimpering. He was
                                163
                                1
still trembling from his long, hard run.
And now he trembled also for quite another;
reason. Svend the Bloody allowed the ex-
pression of merriment to die out of his face,
His eyes narrowed and his brow wrinkled,
He bent forward quickly and grasped the
thrall, and lifted him from the floor.
  “ Master! I did my best—”
  “ Yet there must be a sacrifice, and you
are the nearest,” said Svend. “ Fool, to
think that it was good news you brought!
By the hammer of Thor, it was ill news,
thrall! Think you that I rejoice at the ap-
proach of the son of Haakon the Lover?
Men may think so, but it is not true. And
now you have heard me say too much, and
so—”
  “ Master!”
  “ Your breath is half gone already, and
’twill take no great blow to rob you of the
rest of it!”
  Svend the Bloody drew back his right
hand, doubled his fist, and launched it for-
ward. There came a scream of pain, the
crunching of breaking bones. Svend the
Bloody tossed the quivering body of the
thrall to one side.
  “ Not quite dead at the blow, but he will
be before the sun is much higher,” Svend
said. “ I wished to see whether I still could
slay a man with a single blow. Magnus,
we must out and welcome the ship. Be
careful of your countenance, that men may
not guess the truth.”
  “ So he has come!” Magnus said.
  “ Do not taunt me with it! Can I do
less than make him welcome, my brother’s
son? Is he not a jarl in his own right?
Yet did his father wed and live his life in
the southland, and now that he is gone the
son returns to claim the rights of a jarl
here. I fear that we may tread on each
other’s sandals.”
  “ You have but to say the word—”
  “ And you would take your ax to him as
he sleeps? It will not do! After all, he
is my brother’s son—and King Olaf might
ask questions. Perchance this young man
does not know that half my estates of a
right belong to him. His father was called
Haakon the Lover, because of his softness.
The son may be as soft and can be bent to
our will.”

  For a moment he paced back and forth,
busy with thought, his brow a thunder-
cloud. Then he stopped his pacing and
raised his voice.
  “ Eric!” he called.
  There was a moment of silence, and then
another thrall came slowly through the
open door. He was a giant, almost as huge
as Svend the Bloody. Eric the Dumb, he
was called by men, and there was good
reason for it. He had been captured while
but a boy, during a Viking raid in Nor-
mandy, and the horror of that night had
struck him. Thick witted he was, his mind
and tongue moving slowly. He did not re-
member his name and station. So Svend
had named him Eric in derision, after a foe
he hated particularly.
  Eric the Dumb folded his arms across
his great chest and stood waiting. His eyes
strayed once toward the quivering thing on
the floor.
  “ Take that carrion out of here and
throw it from the cliff!” Svend command-
ed in a loud voice.
  Then the jarl stalked from the room and
into the open, followed by Magnus.
  Eric the Dumb uttered a little cry of
pain that could not have been heard more
than a dozen feet away. He bent over the
quivering body of the thrall and made a
swift examination. Then he turned his
head toward the doorway, and a flash of
hate came from his eyes. The dying thrall
had been his best friend, and Eric the
Dumb would not forget!
CHAPTER II.
A MAN COMES OUT OF GAUL.
ALREADY the ship was coming down
the fiord. She was a picture of a
ship, some hundred and seventy feet
from stem to stern and seventeen feet wide.
Her sails were furled, and cascades of
watery gems flashed in the sun as the big
oars worked through the sixteen oar open-
ings.
  Down on the shore, those of the estab-
lishment of Svend the Bloody made ready
the welcome. It was a long time since this
great ship had been sent away, to loot, to
trade, and to return to the land of his
father Edvard, son of Haakon the Lover.
Wherefore, women crowded the water front
to greet husbands and sons they had not
seen for long, some of them fearing and all
hoping, for not always did all of a ship’s
company return from a perilous voyage.
  Thralls rushed this way and that prepar-
ing for the landing. Shield maidens strut-
ted back and forth across the rocky beach.
Their eyes glinted as they looked at one
another, and with reason. Edvard Haak-
onsson, so report said, was as yet unmar-
ried. It was to be expected that he soon
would take one to wife. And he was a
man worth the winning.
  Edvard Haakonsson was a jarl and heir
to broad estates. Moreover, he had been
born and reared in that land far to the
south, where, it was whispered, men had
delicious manners. They were great lovers,
those men of the foreign land. And was
not this Edvard’s father known as Haakon
the Lover?
  Not a man or woman in the establish-
ment of Svend the Bloody but knew the
story. Years before, Haakon had gone on
a Viking cruise, and he never had returned.
He had met a maid in the land to the south,
had wooed and won her, and there he had
remained to make his home. The north-
land called to him in vain.
  And now he was dead, and his wife also,
and Edvard, their son, alone remained of
the family. Wherefore he was returning
to claim his place in the land of King Olaf.
  There was much speculation among the
maidens, and not a little among the men.
Haakon the Lover had been a giant of a
man, with long fair hair, a proper brother
of Svend the Bloody so far as strength was
concerned. Yet his great frame protected
the heart of a woman. He had been kind
alike to men at arms and thralls. He had
been known to weep at the death of a close
friend in battle. And a great love had soft-
ened him.
  Edvard Haakonsson, these people of
Svend’s supposed, would be another such
giant. Yet in his blood flowed the influ-
ence of the soft land to the south. Per-
chance his great frame, too, would hide the
heart of a woman. Yet he was a jarl!
THE BLACK JARL.
165
  Now the great ship was approaching the
landing place, and men and women shout-
ed their greetings. Thralls waded out into
the water, ready to be of service in the
landing. There would be great casks of
wine to be taken ashore and carried to the
big house, they knew. There would be
bundles of other things fetched from the
lands to the south. The homecoming
meant naught but much work for the
thralls. Yet there would be a great feast
at which Svend the Bloody welcomed his
kinsman, and then the thralls would have
tiieir share, eating on the floor with the
hounds.
  Down to the beach Svend the Bloody
stalked in company of Magnus. He had
forced a smile to his face, and Magnus
likewise. They stood aloof, and others
gave them space.
  “ He will be a hulk of a man with the
heart of a sheep,” Svend said, in low tones.
“ Such a man was his father, my brother.
My mother must have been under the curse
of Odin when my brother was born. By
the hammer of Thor—”
  “ The ship is handled well,” Magnus put
in, hoping to change the other’s manner.
  “ Let us hope that she brings a cargo of
profit, since she brings this other also,”
Svend whispered. “ I must be under a
curse myself. This, and the command to
wait upon King Olaf at Trondhjem, and
the activities of the cursed priests with
their cross—”
 “I have a thought!” Magnus said.
“ This nephew of yours, Svend, comes from
a land where the Christians rule. Do you
think it possible—”
  “ That he be a Christian?” Svend thun-
dered. “ A man of my blood? Fool my
brother may have been, and soft, but he
died in the grace of Odin and went to Val-
halla in a viking funeral ship. That much
I know! Would he allow his son to be a
follower of the Christ? No more words of
this! It were an insult even to ask the
lad. And, after all, he is a jarl!”
  Now the ship was near to the land, and
the oars were in. The craft drifted slowly
toward the landing place. The thralls were
up to their knees in the water, to their
thighs, their necks, waiting to help. On the
deck of the craft were cheering mariners
and men-at-arms. Frantic women called to
their loved ones. Others lifted high above
their heads babes that had been born since
their fathers had sailed away.
  The ship grounded, and the thralls pulled
her broadside to the land. Over the side
tumbled a score of men in armor, to wade
through the surging waters and so claim the
dry land. They shouted, brandished their
weapons, laughed and called round oaths
because they were home again.
  Over the side of the ship the end of a
landing stage appeared. Sailors thrust it
outward and lowered it, until its end rested
on the land.
  “ What is this?” Svend roared. “ Is there
a man aboard who cannot jump into the
water and swim or wade to land?”
  “ Perhaps there are captive women,” said
Magnus.
  “ Even so! Has the day come when a
man cannot pack a captive woman on his
back? This is a touch of that southern
softness, by the hammer of Thor!”
  Svend the Bloody started to make his
way toward the landing, and Magnus
stalked at his heels. Svend was in an ugly
mood, though he endeavored not to show
it. He cuffed thralls out of his way. He
struck a shield maiden aside, and she snarled
at him, and put her hand to the dagger at
her waist. Svend laughed and cuffed her
again.
  A child was in his path, and he kicked
it aside. A girl, shouting to one of the
sailors, was hurled back into the throng.
So Svend the Bloody made his way down
to the shore and the end of the landing
stage.
  “ Hail, Edvard, son of Haakon the Lov-
er!” the crowd was shouting. “Hail, Ed-
vard Haakonsson!”
  The ship was fast. At the top of the
landing stage appeared her master. He
turned to shout orders to those behind him.
And then he walked slowly down to the
beach, a giant of a man in armor and hel-
met, his fair beard blowing back over one
shoulder. A dagger was in his girdle, an
ax was fastened to his belt. The muscles
stood out in knots on his bare legs beneath
his mail.
166
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  Above him were other men-at-arms,
swords and axes gleaming, bows, arrows,
and spears near at hand. Some were armed
with javelins, light and deadly weapons in
the hands of those skilled in their use.
They shouted, and then they were still.
Their commander walked on down the land-
ing stage, which bent beneath his tread.
  “ Hail, Svend!” he called, lifting a hand.
  “ Hail, Rolf! What of the voyage?”
  “ One profitable raid, and only five men
missing,” the ship’s commander replied.
“ Much of value have we aboard to be
landed.”
  “ Once more you have done well,” Svend
declared. “ And—my kinsman?”
  “ Is aboard and ready to land and be
greeted,” Rolf replied.
  The ship’s commander now was at the
foot of the landing stage. Stfend clasped
him for a moment by the hand, then stood
back and spoke in low tones.
  “ What manner of man?”
  “ A most peculiar one,” Rolf answered.
“ He is one not to be judged hastily. A
man may make his decision at a first glance,
and find later that he has decided amiss.”
  “ Let him land! We wait to welcome
him!” Svend said.
  Rolf turned and lifted his hand. Down
the landing stage trooped half a score of
men-at-arms, eager to be ashore. They
touched the land and stood aside, making
an aisle.
  “Edvard Haakonsson, come to land!”
Svend the Bloody called.
  The throng ashore stilled its tumult.
Every eye was upon the top of the landing
stage. A man appeared there.
  Came a gasp from those on the shore.
   “ He is black of hair! ”
  “ A black jarl, we have!”
  “ And small! Little in stature! ” a wom-
an cried.
  Edvard, son of Haakon the Lover,
stopped for a moment at the top of the
landing stage. He looked at those below
him, and his teeth flashed in a smile. He
stood in silhouette, and those below had
their good look at him.
  “ By the hammer of Thor! ” Svend swore,
lightly.
  For Edvard Haakonsson did not wear
gleaming mail. His bare arms were not
crowded with bracelets to show his jarl’s
rank. His legs were incased in cloth, and
he wore a jacket. No helmet was upon his
head, but that thing known as a hat. He
was a picture of the lazy and woman-heart-
ed land to the south.
  Again he smiled, and then he swept down
the landing stage like the breath of a gale.
His movements were quick. His eyes were
glistening, he glanced rapidly from side to
side. He came to a stop before Svend and
Magnus, and looked up at them.
  “ You are Edvard Haakonsson, my kins-
man?” Svend demanded as though he
hoped it were not true.
  “ I am. And you are Svend, brother of
my father!”
  “ It is so,” Svend agreed. “ Welcome
to the land of your fathers! May Odin
give you long life and Thor lend you his
hammer against your enemies! My house
stands open for you! ”
  Without another word, Svend the Bloody
turned his back and stalked through the
crowd, Magnus beside him. Edvard Haak-
onsson followed beside Rolf. The crowd
fell back to let them pass. Thralls gazed
at the black jarl, wide eyed. Eric the
Dumb showed a flash of interest, because
this man was in part like the men of his
own land. The shield maidens with their
helmets of gleaming silver smiled upon him.
Small he was, and black, yet he was a
jarl!
  They crowded forward closer to look
at him. A girl stumbled and fell under
his feet. But Edvard Haakonsson did not
kick her out of the way and shower oaths
upon her. He stopped, gave an exclama-
tion, reached down, and gently lifted her to
her feet. He brushed some dust from her
kirtle, laughed lightly, and then walked on.
  “By Odin!” swore Svend the Bloody,
who had noticed the incident. “ He is as
soft as his father! Magnus, did you see?”
“ I saw! ” Magnus replied.
  “ He stoops—he, a jarl—to lift from the
earth a maiden of no rank at all! These
be soft southern ways! There are certain
things that this pretty black jarl must be
taught! I suppose he would pet a thrall!”
Magnus laughed. “ Any of the shield

maidens could defeat him in combat,” the
lieutenant said.
  Edvard had dropped a few feet behind
and was looking back at the ship. And now
Rolf bent forward and dropped a few words
into Magnus’s ear.
  “Do not be too quick to judge!” Rolf
said. “ I am no weakling, am I?”
 “ By Thor—no!”
  “ And you would think me able to take
care of myself?”
  “ That goes without question.”
  “ Yet were it not for this black jarl I
would not be with you now,” Rolf declared.
“ Once he saved my life in combat, and
once he saved the ship in a storm, when
the men were terrified and on the verge of
mutiny and would not work the vessel! ”
  “ This man?” Magnus gasped.
  “ That man! ” Rolf said.
  “ A man of his small body?”
  “ Yet in that small body, Magnus, my
friend, he has a thing that not all men
possess in a great degree,” Rolf declared.
  “ What is this thing he possesses of which
you speak?”
  “ Brains!” answered Rolf. “ Brains!”
CHAPTER III.
A FEAST AND A COMBAT.
THROUGHOUT the long day, thralls
worked at unloading the ship. Huge
casks were carried to the storehouse of
Svend the Bloody, and bundles of wares.
The sailors and men-at-arms frolicked
ashore. All made ready for the feast.
  Inside the great house, Edvard Haakons-
son was given an apartment of his own,
where he refreshed himself after the voyage.
And then he walked forth into the great
hall again, to find Svend and Magnus and
Rolf eating at the big board. He joined
them, but he did not eat as they ate. Ed-
vard, son of Haakon the Lover, had fas-
tidious manners.
  Svend eyed him for a time in silence,
while Magnus grinned into his grease soaked
beard. And finally the Bloody one saw
fit to speak.
  “ Our customs and manners are differ-
ent from yours, Edvard,” he said. “ It is
proper that you dress and conduct yourself
here as we of the Norse do.”
  “ That is agreed,” Edvard said.
  “ You should dress as a man-at-arms, and
on your bare arm wear the bracelets of your
rank. Such dress as you now wear is fit
only for women.”
  “ I can change to armor, kinsman!”
  “ Do so before the feast,” Svend said.
“ We grow rough here at times when there
is feasting.”
“ And you would do well to watch those
about you,” Magnus put in. “ Some may
entice you to combat, to try your strength.”
Edvard turned to look full at him. “ I
shall be ready,” he said.
  Magnus grunted and returned to his eat-
ing. The fact that there would be a feast
that night did not prevent him eating his
fill now. Svend the Bloody put aside a
picked bone and leaned back against the
wall.
  “ It is well, Edvard, that you know some-
thing of the times here among the Norse,”
he said.
  “ I am eager to learn,” Edvard declared.
His manner was somewhat puzzling. He
acted like a man who knew more than he
betrayed. Svend frowned, but continued
his speech.
  “ Olaf Trygvesson, our king, is a good
man in many ways, yet peculiar,” Svend
said. “ The Christians have won him over,
and he would win the remainder of us from
Odin and Thor. He is building him a city
at Trondhjem, and he has commanded that
all jarls await upon him there. We have
been waiting but for your arrival before set-
ting out.
  “ There may be grave trouble,” Svend
continued. “ There are jarls who have
adopted this new religion, hoping thus to
get favor from Olaf. Harald the Just—
may the curse of Odin be upon him!—is
one such.”
  “ And where lies his estate?” Edvard
asked.
  “ Adjoining mine—that is to say but a
night’s march away,” Svend replied. “ We
have been at warfare for countless moons.
Our thralls fight when they meet in the
woods. And here and there a dead war-
rior is found in the brush, with none to tell
168
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
the manner of his death. Between the es-
tablishment of Harald the Just and mine
there can be naught but enmity! It is
well that you, my kinsman, should know
this thing.”
  “ I shall remember it,” Edvard replied.
  “ We go to Trondhjem to see Olaf, but
we go prepared. I shall take men-at-arms
with me, and thralls, and pitch a camp out-
side the city. Olaf is giving a fair. But
his real intention is to urge us to peace.
’Twould not surprise me if it be a bloody
fair. Olaf may turn against the gods and
cling to this new cross, but, by the ham-
mer of Thor, he cannot turn all the jarls
with him! Only a few week-kneed ones,
who curry favor at the foot of the throne!
Olaf perchance will not live to see his beard
grow gray. This is the year 998, as the new
religionists count it from the birth of their
Christ. For three years has Olaf reigned,
and for two wears has he been building
his city. He is constructing what he calls
a church, for this new worship. ’Twould
serve him better if he constructed means
of defense.”
  Svend the Bloody spoke bitterly, but he
was watching Edvard closely meanwhile.
And this kinsman who had come out of the
south did not betray anything but polite
interest.
  “To-night we feast. Then a rest, and
then we go to Trondhjem,” Svend declared.
“ We go to the fair—and what happens!
Jarl, you are a man of proper years, yet you
are not wed. Have you put eye on
maiden?”
  “ Not to any purpose,” Edvard replied.
  “ It were well you did so. The estates
of your father are on the other side of
mine, but years ago I combined them. It
would be a difficult thing to separate them
now. It is in my mind that we allow
them to remain as they are, and at my
death you shall be jarl over all. I have
no son.”
  “ The thought pleases me,” Edvard said.
“ The estates are in good hands.”
  Svend smiled for the first time. “ Then
it is proper that you take a maid to wife,”
he continued. “ Let not yourself be found
in the years of age without male issue.
There is in my household the maid for you.
She is a distant kinswoman, Brynhild by
name, a shield maiden.”
  “ Brynhild!” Edvard said.
  “ A glorious woman, jarl! Big and
strong. She can swim the fiord. She has
slain a bear with her hands alone. She is
tall and straight, with fair hair that hangs
below her knees. She would bear you
strong sons.”
  “ But this woman perchance would not
wish to wed me,” Edvard said.
  “ Not wed a jarl? When she has nothing
but good birth, no fortune of her own?
Not wed you—if I commanded?”
  “ But perchance I would, not wish to wed
her,” Edvard said again. “ If my heart did
not warm toward her—”
  Svend the Bloody stopped him with a
roar of anger. “ Heart! ” he cried. “ You
speak of this thing men call love? What
has that to do with bringing forth sons?
What you want is a woman of skill and
strength, a worthy mother of jarls! No
more of this now. You shall see her to-
night as she sits among her maidens.”
Edvard Haakonsson said nothing to that.
He pretended to eat the meat before him.
But his mind was working swiftly. He
foresaw that he would have to handle this
kinsman of his with velvet gloves. Svend
the Bloody was a man used to having his
own way and brooking interference from
none.
  He might have been enlightened had he
glanced at Magnus at the moment, but he
did not. For the brow of Magnus was black
with wrath, and he darted venomous glances
at both Edvard and Svend. Magnus long
before had marked Brynhild, the shield
maiden, for his own.
  The remainder of the day passed with-
out event and the dusk came. Out in the
clearing great fires had been lighted. In-
side the big hall torches were fastened to
the walls, and things had been prepared
for the feast.
  Oxen, sheep, and swine had been roasted.
Wine casks from the land to the south
had been broached. Men-at-arms thronged
the big hall, and thralls scurried here and
there attending to their labors. Hounds
barked and snarled and fought.
  Edvard Haakonsson came from his own
THE BLACK JARL.
169
apartment dressed as befitted the country.
He looked more the Norse now, save for
his dark hair and skin. He took his place
at the table beside Svend, with Magnus on
the other side of him. Rolf sat at Svend’s
other elbow, as was his right.
  Never had Edvard seen such a feast as
this! Huge chunks of meat were devoured,
wine was guzzled. Intoxicated men grew
rough in speech and manner. Thralls were
cuffed, dogs kicked.
  The shield maidens had a table of their
own, and Brynhild sat at the head of it.
Edvard had looked upon her. She was tall
and strong and fair, yet the fact that she
was a shield maiden did not prevent her be-
ing woman also. Perhaps Svend had whis-
pered certain things to her. The space be-
tween her and Edvard Haakonsson was
clear, and she looked continually across it.
  “ There is a maiden for you,” Svend whis-
pered. “ Mark her well, kinsman. Wed
her, and have her bring forth sons. Then,
when I am gone, you shall inherit from me
also.”
  “ If he outlives you,” Magnus snarled.
  “ I grow old, and Edvard has youth in
his veins,” said Svend.
  “ Yet youth has been slain.”
  “ Brynhild will make him a fair wife.
See how she looks at the youth even now.”
  Magnus saw, and growled low down in
his throat. Brynhild was not the one to
pass by a jarl and accept a jarl’s lieutenant.
Her eyes burned with ambition more than
love. In her heart she despised the black
jarl for his small stature, yet she gladly
would wed with him.
  The feast went on. Warriors were teas-
ing the shield maidens now, and scuffling
with them. Shrieks of merriment rang out
in the great hall. Dogs fought at the sides
of the tables, and thralls scrambled with
them for bits of food.
  Svend the Bloody lurched to his feet, a
huge wine goblet in his hand.
  “Drink!” he cried out above the din.
“ Drink the silent toast!”
  Instantly all was still. Not a man or
woman there but knew what he meant.
And so the toast was drunk, and the names
of Odin and Thor came in whispers from
lips.
  Svend sat down again, half a smile upon
his lips. “ Olaf may be a great man, but he
cannot change every heart,” he muttered.
“ We march to Trondhjem before the sun
twice more has sunk beneath the western
sea! And before we return perhaps we shall
know more of the might of Thor!”
  Men and women were leaving the tables
now and wandering about the great hall.
One by one the shield maidens stopped be-
fore the dais and bowed before Svend the
Bloody. Brynhild was the last.
  She moved deliberately before him, and
once more her eyes sought the face of Ed-
vard Haakonsson. And then she would
have walked on, but Svend raised a hand
and stopped her.
  “ Fairest of the shield maidens!” he pro-
claimed. “ Our kinsman would greet you!”
  Edvard got slowly to his feet. Svend
had said it, and Svend was to be obeyed.
He, too was a jarl, but Svend the head of
the family by weight of years.
  Down from the dais Edvard stepped, and
went forward. Brynhild bowed low before
him, though in her status of shield maiden
she was not compelled so to do. By this
added courtesy she showed the state of her
mind, and big Magnus growled again into
his beard.
  And now Edvard, son of Haakon the
Lover, did a peculiar thing. He reached
forward and took one of Brynhild’s hands
in his own. He lifted it slowly, while men
and women wondered, and gently he bent
his head and kissed the shield maiden’s
hand.
  There was a murmur of surprise, delight,
horror. Brynhild flushed with pleasure.
Edvard Haakonsson stepped back, and
again he bowed, and then he spoke.
  “Greeting!” he said. “My uncle has
wonderful maids about him!”
  That was all. He went back to the dais
and his seat. The shield maiden walked on.
  “ Is she not a proper maid?” Svend
asked, when Edvard had regained his seat.
  “ All are proper maids,” Edvard replied.
  Magnus leaned toward him. In his heart
was hatred, but he knew that he must con-
duct himself carefully. This man was kins-
man of Svend, and so was entitled to some
consideration. Yet not even Svend could
170
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY,
prohibit the outcome of a quarrel. This
was Norseland, where all men, be they jarls
or thralls, stood by themselves.
  “ She is a wonderful maid,” Magnus said
in his beard. “ She could pick you up,
black jarl, and toss you over her shoulder.”
“ Possibly,” Edvard said.
  “ When she weds, it should be to a man
of might. By the hammer of Thor, she is
for no weakling!”
  All those at the table heard the words.
Svend’s face grew black, but he said noth-
ing. Edvard turned his head and regarded
Magnus as he might have a curiosity.
  “ Do I understand you to mean that I
am a weakling?” he asked.
  “You have not the size of a warrior,
scarce!” Magnus sneered.
  “ Nor the strength?”
  “ Nor the strength!” said Magnus.
  “ Men have made mistakes before to-
night,” Edvard observed.
  Magnus lurched toward him, and again
he snarled. “ Jarl,” he said, “ you have not
your father’s great body, and I doubt your
strength. You have inherited more from
your mother, a woman of that land to the
south where women—”
  “ My mother is not to be mentioned by
your lips!” Edvard warned.
  “ What is this? A man may not men-
tion a woman? Are women, then, gods to
be treated so?”
  “ They are to be treated with love and
respect,” Edvard said.
  “ Love? Respect for women? Jarl,
your body speaks for itself. I doubt your
strength. And now, after your words, I
doubt the quality of your brain. Has your
head been touched and weakened by the
southern sun?”
  Edvard faced him squarely. “ Do you,
by any chance, doubt my courage also?”
he asked.
  There was a moment of silence. Every
eye in the great hall was upon those on
the dais. Edvard, son of Haakon the Lov-
er, had put the question, and Magnus could
do naught but answer. An expression of
glee came into the face of Magnus. What-
ever happened after this, Svend the Bloody
could not hold him to account. A man of
rank had the right to protect his honor.
  “ Yes, jarl, I doubt your courage, also!”
Magnus said.
  Rolf, the shipmaster, gave an exclama-
tion of surprise. Svend swore roundly.
Edvard Haakonsson got slowly to his feet.
A wine goblet was in his hand. A moment
he hesitated, and then he flung the dregs
of the wine into Magnus’s face.
  The uproar came instantly. Men sprang
back against the walls. Shield maidens
hurried aside, their eyes glowing. Thralls
scattered out of the way.
  Magnus roared like an angry bull as he
wiped the wine from his eyes. He glanced
once at Svend, who gave no sign. This
thing was between men, and Svend could
not take a hand in favoring one or the
other. His new-found kinsman, he sup-
posed, would soon be new-lost. In such
event, the estates—
  “We fight!” Magnus cried.
  He sprang down from the dais and wait-
ed. Edvard wiped the wine from his hands
carefully. He was not smiling now. His
face was grim. He walked down to the
level of the earth floor, and stood there
with his hands at his sides.
  “ You are my uncle’s valued man,” Ed-
vard said. “ In such case, I have no wish
to harm you.”
  “ To harm me?” Magnus shrieked.
“ You shall die, jarl, by my hands!”
  “ Nor have I any wish to die at the mo-
ment,” Edvard told him.
  Svend towered to his feet. “ What mean
those words?” he cried. “ Do you, of the
blood of Haakon, my brother, turn from
the face of a foe?”
  “ I turn from no man,” Edvard replied.
“ It is but a test of strength and courage
this man of yours demands, and I am will-
ing to grant him that. It is not necessary
that we fight each other with death-dealing
weapons.”
  “ Then what would you?”
  “ I can throw him!”
  Another moment of silence, and then a
roar of laughter, in which even the shield
maidens joined.
  “ Throw him?” Svend shouted.
  “ Throw me?” Magnus shrieked. “ I
can crush your ribs with my arms. Far
better you try the ax or javelin.”
THE BLACK JARL.
171
  “ I have chosen,” Edvard replied. “ The
right is mine. The first insult came from
you.”
  “ You would wrestle me? In armor?”
  “ As we now stand.”
  Magnus scarcely could conceal his de-
light. This man would be a baby in his
arms. He would crush the ribs of the black
jarl, and toss him aside to die. Then he
would claim the fair Brynhild for his own.
  “ Make your peace with the gods! ” Mag-
nus cried.
  Then he rushed. But Edvard Haakons-
son merely stepped aside and let him charge
by. Magnus turned, growling his curses,
and once more he rushed. And this time
Edvard Haakonsson did not seek to evade
him.
  They clashed, their arms entwined, their
legs mingled. There was a moment of quiet
straining. And then the great body of
Magnus whirled swiftly to one side, and he
crashed to the ground. Edvard stood over
him, hands against hips, breathing no heav-
ier at all.
  Silence for the space of a heartbeat, and
then shouts of surprise. Magnus struggled
to his feet, his face purple with wrath.
  “ It was a trick! ” he roared. “ I slipped
in wine—”
  Once more he rushed. His rage now was
a terrible thing. That the black jarl had
thrown him once was bad enough. And
deep down in his heart Magnus knew that
it had been no accident. The black jarl
had a method of wrestling that was new.
  Once more they clashed, and again there
came that moment of silent straining. And
then the body of Magnus was whirled aside
again to crash against the floor.
  Cheers rang up against the beams of the
thatch. Svend the Bloody roared his
laughter.
  “Enough!” he cried. “Edvard, son of
Haakon the Lover, you have methods of
which we know nothing.”
  “A trick!” Magnus shouted again, but
they laughed him down.
  Rolf, the shipmaster, leaned toward the
man at his side. “ The black jarl has many
such tricks,” he whispered.
  Edvard Haakonsson had stepped back,
and again placed his hands lightly against
his thighs. He was laughing lightly. Mag-
nus lurched toward him.
  “ There are things besides wrestling,”
he said. “ Some day we may clash again,
and with weapons.”
  “ When the day comes, you will find me
waiting,” Edvard said.
  Magnus turned away, shouting for wine.
His face was still purple with wrath. Men
were laughing at him behind his back, he
knew. Even the maidens had witnessed
his downfall—and Brynhild with them!
  Edvard walked aside. For a space he
leaned against one of the walls, watching
the scene. Men and women walked before
him, eyed him. His status had changed
somewhat, but still they doubted his qual-
ity. Brynhild stopped beside him.
   “ You are strong, jarl,” she said, softly.
“ Magnus was right. It was but a clever
trick.”
  “ But it served,” she said. “I am glad
that I have found favor in your eyes. Your
kiss still bums my hand.”
  Edvard looked at her quickly, laughed
nervously.
  “ Twas nothing,” he said.
   “ Such a kiss nothing, before guests and
thralls?” she said. “ By it you elevated me
to your station, jarl. I am your bride when
you wish to claim me!”
  “ But I meant nothing by it,” he ex-
plained. “ In the land from which I come,
it is but proper courtesy to greet a woman
so.”
   She raised her head quickly, and her eyes
flashed as she regarded him.
  “ Then I am no more to you than any
one of the other maidens?” she asked.
  “ How could that be, since I saw none
of you until to-day?” he replied.
  “You do not want me, then?”
  Edvard shook his head. “ I am sorry!”
he said. “ I would be your friend—”
  “ There can be no friendship between
us, jarl, after this!”
  A moment she looked at him, and then
she turned her back upon him and walked
rapidly away. Edvard Haakonsson had
made another enemy, and a vindictive one.
For Brynhild sought out Magnus, and
whispered in his ear.
  “ Kill me this black jarl when you have
172
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY,
the opportunity,” she said, hotly. “ And
then ask Svend the Bloody for my hand.
It will be waiting to clasp yours!”
CHAPTER IV.
AT TRONDHJEM.
BECAUSE of circumstances, Svend the
Bloody did not hesitate in leaving
Rolf, the shipmaster, in charge of the
estate, with only the ship’s crew and a
handful of thralls as guards. For King
Olaf had commanded all the jarls to ap-
pear before him at Trondhjem; hence none
would be prowling through the forests with
men at arms behind him, ready to fall upon
the unprotected domain of a foe.
  Two days after the arrival of Edvard,
Svend the Bloody gave the word and the
start was made. Svend, having some
knowledge of the situation, journeyed as
became a jarl of wealth and fame, the bet-
ter to make an impression upon King Olaf
and upon certain other jarls who might be
close to the throne.
  None knew better than Svend the Bloody
that King Olaf had turned Christian, and
some of his jarls and their households with
him, and that Olaf was seeking to convert
others. Yet there were stolid jarls like
Svend, who clung to the gods of their
fathers and turned against the cross. And
this was to be their last stand at Trond-
hjem before the king. Either they won
permission to worship as pleased them, or
bloody war would follow.
  Svend the Bloody led his host from the
clearing and took up the trail through the
woods. At his side rode Magnus, and at
his other side Edvard. Behind them came
men at arms, mounted and on foot, swords-
men and archers and spearmen. And then
the armies of thralls, tugging with the
oxen at carts that bore Svend’s tents and
booths, presents, weapons, foodstuffs.
  They made a brave company as they won
their way slowly through the woods, those
in the fore sitting their horses regally, their
armor glistening where the sun struggled
through the tree tops, their huge swords
clanking, their shields swinging, each man
with a battle ax at his saddle bow.
  Throughout the day they marched, and
when the dusk came they camped beside a
tumbling stream, pitched a few of the tents,
cooked and ate and rested. Edvard Haak-
onsson, as became his rank, had a tent of
his own, and Eric the Dumb to serve him.
The choice had been a natural one, for
Eric the Dumb had managed to be close
at hand when the black jarl had wanted a
thrall.
  In Svend’s pavilion that night there was
a whispered conversation between himself
and Magnus, while a sentry stood before the
opening and another at the rear. Magnus
the sly was not the one to overlook such
a chance.
  “ It is in my mind, jarl,” he said, “ that
it might be an ill thing to allow this Edvard
to see the king.”
  “ How so?” Svend demanded.
  “ Know you not the story of Olaf Tryg-
vesson? He came of the race of Harald
the Fair-Haired. Did not his mother carry
him to Russia to escape the murder decree
of the wicked Gunhild? Were they not
captured by pirate vikings and sold as
slaves?”
  “ But what has that to do with this
affair?”
  “ In Russia he was well trained for king-
ship after his identity was discovered. Then
he journeyed to foreign lands, to the one
they call Greece, and there went through
that mysterious rite that the Christians call
baptism. That softened him, and because
he had been a slave he felt pity for the lot
of slaves.”
  “ Still I do not see—”
  “ He also visited the land of the Gauls,
and Normandy, and Scotland. He raided
Britain. The mild winds of the southern
countries softened him. And this Edvard
is new come from there. King Olaf, once
he meets him, will observe him well, talk
with him, perhaps make him a favorite.
  “ By Odin!” Svend swore.
  “ He may whisper into the king’s ear,
jarl, that he would like an accounting of
his father’s estate.”
  “ By the hammer of Thor! If he did
that—”
  “ I see that you understand my mean-
ing,” Magnus said. “ It would have been a
THE BLACK JARL.
173
good thing if you had left this black jarl
behind to guard the estate.”
  “ But he has come with us,” Svend re-
plied. “ And how am I to prevent him
seeing Olaf? It is his right.”
  “ Being a stranger, perhaps that task
will be an easy one,” Magnus answered.
“ Tell him that there may be trouble be-
tween the followers of the gods and the
Christian jarls. Say that you must go to
the king, since he has commanded, and that
you leave this Edvard at the camp, in com-
mand in case of a surprise.”
  “ By Thor! That is a rare idea!”
  “ I have a rarer one—to split the head of
this black jarl some night while he sleeps!”
“ Why not come face to face with him?”
Svend asked.
  “ Give me but the chance! ”
  “ It will not do. After all, he is my
brother’s son. I may have need of him.
But I do not trust him yet. Therefore,
say nothing to him regarding our policies.”
“ Do not fear I shall exchange words with
him unless it must be done,” Magnus said.
  “ However, it will be well to keep him
from Olaf. I thank you for the thought.”
“ It was freely given,” Magnus replied.
“ I must face Harald the Just at Trond-
hjem, I suppose,” Svend said. “ Each time
I face him, it is in my mind to lay open his
brains with an ax. Thoughts of him dis-
turb my sleep and bother my days.”
  Svend the Bloody sought his furs, and
Magnus left the tent to go to his own.
  In the morning the gay company moved
forward again, and late that afternoon they
came to the vicinity of Trondhjem. Svend
was one of the last of the jarls to arrive
for the fair. He growled angrily as he
ordered his men to pitch the camp. He did
not like King Olaf, and little cared he
whether men knew it.
  Svend had selected a good place for the
camp, on the bank of the fiord and at the
edge of the woods, close beside the road
that ran into the town. Here was water
and fuel, and a place easy to defend. Tents
were pitched and pavilions erected. Fires
were started, meat was roasted. Other jarls
encamped in the neighborhood sent men
with greetings, and Svend returned them.
They slept, and were up with the sun.
Already the road was a trail of dust clouds
as horsemen and footmen hurried toward
the town. Jarls rode by with their guards,
shield maidens smiled when they saw
Svend’s camp, thralls trotted beside the
horses.
  Svend the Bloody ordered out his men
and had the horses made ready. Magnus
stood to one side talking to two of his war-
riors. Edvard Haakonsson came from his
tent, dressed in his armor, the bracelets of
rank upon his bare arms.
  “ Kinsman!” Svend’s loud voice called to
him.
  “ Jarl?”
  “ It is my wish that you remain in the
camp for the day,” Svend said.
  “ Remain in the camp?” Edvard gasped.
“ When there is a fair and a king to be
seen? When there are ladies—”
  “ It is a matter of urgency,” Svend de-
clared. “ In these times, it would be un-
wise for me to venture into the town with-
out ample men at my back. It would be
unwise, also, to leave this camp without
leaving some man of proper authority in
command. I do not want some Christian
jarl to lay waste my goods.”
  “ I would make but a poor commander ”
Edvard said.
   “ It is my wish, jarl! ”
  Edvard’s eyes flashed at the tone. For a
moment he looked straight at Svend the
Bloody.
  “ It is in my mind,” Edvard said, “ that
it is my right to go to the town.”
  “ Is there to be dissension between us?”
“ Not unless it is of your foolish making,
uncle! I am a jarl. the son of a jarl! It
is my right to face the king! You have
warriors fit to command the camp. What
of this Magnus?”
  “ I—I wish him to go with me,” Svend
said.
  “ If he were here, I might go?”
  “ But he will not be here,” said Svend.
“ If at least two of his lieutenants were
here you might go. But I need my men-at-
arms beside me. Your word, jarl! Your
word that you will neither walk nor ride to
the fair.”
  Again there was silence for a moment,
and the black jarl seemed puzzled. But
174
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY,
presently he raised his head, and his eyes
were twinkling.
  “ So be it!” he said. “ My honored wrord
that I will neither walk nor ride to the
fair.”
  “ And that you will not leave the camp!”
  “ And that I will not leave the camp,
save if two of your lieutenants are here to
command it.”
  Svend the Bloody said nothing more. He
swung into his saddle and raised his hand.
The others mounted after him. The thralls
buckled their belts and prepared to run be-
side the horses. Magnus turned quickly to
the two warriors with whom he had been
talking.
  “ You understand?” he whispered. “ Start
with us, but drop out along the way. Re-
turn to the camp, and pick a quarrel with
him. And then slay! He must be dead
before we return. Make up what story
you will, and Svend will not punish. Your
tale will stand. There will be none but
thralls to see.”
  Then Magnus mounted and cantered
after the jarl.
  Down the dusty road they went, headed
for the town. Edvard watched until a bend
in the highway sheltered them from his
view1. He turned back and sat down before
his tent, and looked over the camp.
  Half a score of thralls were going about
their duties. Eric the Dumb was but a
short distance away, watching the black
jarl and waiting to be called. The light
of adoration was in his eyes. Eric was slow
of w it, but this man caused things to strug-
gle through the mazes of his memory. This
man had been in the country Eric had once
called home!
  The sun rose higher in the heavens. Ed-
vard Haakonsson got up and entered his
tent. The manner of Svend had puzzled
him, and he was not a fool. He had given
his word, and he would keep it, but he
wondered why it had been asked.
  Presently he heard horsemen in the camp,
and went to the door of his tent again. Two
warriors were dismounting, two of Mag-
nus’s trusted men. Were they to remain in
the camp, Edvard might go to the fair and
still keep his oath—providing he did not
walk or ride!
  He knew them both by sight, but not
by name. Giants they were, and no doubt
great soldiers. They stretched their shoul-
ders, and threw out their chests and ad-
vanced toward him. A few paces away they
stopped and spoke to each other, yet the
words were for him to hear.
  “ When a man’s body is small, so is his
courage!”
  “ When a man apes the manners of wom-
en, he has the heart of one!”
  “ The fairer the hair, the fairer the
honor,” said the first. “ A man with black
hair is not to be trusted.”
  “ It may mean something amiss in his
ancestry,” the second declared.
  Edvard Haakonsson had smiled at the
first two remarks, scowled at the third, and
had become enraged at the fourth. He
hurled himself forward and confronted
them, his eyes blazing, his hot southern
blood uppermost for the moment.
  “ You speak of me?” he demanded.
  One sneered at him. “ If the jarl so
wishes to take it,” he said.
  “ Do I understand that you question my
courage, my honor, and possibly that of my
parents?”
  “ The day is too hot for a man to repeat
his words,” said the second.
  Edvard Haakonsson took a step back-
ward and looked at them searchingly.
  “ You are of the company of Magnus,”
he accused. “ Why has he sent you? Is he
afraid to come himself?”
  “ What has this to do with Magnus?”
  “ Do you think that I am blind” Ed-
vard demanded. “ So it is a game, is it?
A craven game! Yet two men against one
is a compliment. Which of you desires to
cross swords with me first?”
  “ The little jarl would fight,” sneered the
first.
  Edvard whipped out his sword and lifted
up his shield from before the tent.
  “ If a moment more passes, I term you
coward!” he said.
  With a roar of rage the man nearest drew
his blade and darted forward. He was no
mean swordsman. The second laughed at
the ease of it. Yet he drew his blade, too,
and stood ready, in case some accident hao-
pened.
THE BLACK JARL.
175
  The thralls crowded near, but not too
near. Eric the Dumb crouched before the
tent, making little sounds in his throat. The
son of Haakon the Lover advanced.
  The blades touched, and then the Norse-
man found a game he never had seen be-
fore. For the black jarl did not fight in
the usual manner. He did not waste his
strength in the weight of a downward stroke.
He fenced. He darted from side to side,
and his blade bit into mail. His opponent
made great slashes that cut nothing but the
empty air.
  And Edvard Haakonsson was fighting like
a man who intends to avenge an insult.
There was deadly intent in his manner.
The big Norseman gave ground again and
again. He had strength remaining, but no
skill to match the skill of the black jarl.
  Again he whirled, and he grunted a word
to his companion. Into the fray leaped the
other man, so that Edvard was compelled to
face them both.
  “ So!” he cried. “Assassination! Apart
of a foul plot! You came back to taunt me
—and kill me! But the end is not yet! ”

/"\NE by one my friends depart
Through a secret door;
I have seen so many start,
         To return no more.
       Where the kings and prophets went,
Thither they have gone.
Have they found a rich content
As they journeyed on?
One by one, with solemn tread,
         Leaving me behind,
       Friends have joined the quiet dead,
Whilst I, dumb and blind,
Wondered, pondered all in vain
Where they traveled far.
Did they wander in the rain
Till they found a star?
       If they only could come back
         For one little hour,
Smiling from the lonely track,
Noiseless as a flower!
I will come when I am dead,
(Knowing, love, your need);
Ah! how many this have said—
          Said it oft indeed.
Silence! and the aching night;
Nothing through the dark.
Ghostly moths at candlelight
Blundering near the spark.
Emptiness, when but one word
Would have meant so much.

A NOVELETTE—COMPLETE IN THIS ISSUE
SALLIN smiled cheerfully at Viola.
The word had just come to him. The
promise of action was to his liking.
Risky action, but lucrative. He contem-
plated it with the pleasure of the artist.
For he was an artist in his own particular
bent.
  “ We move to Norford, Vi,” he said.
  “ Yes! ” Her interest, too, quickened.
Viola was his first lieutenant and his reputed
wife. She understood the significance of
moving to Norford. Thev had been wait-
ing a long time to do that—for circum-
stances to adjust themselves and make the
effort profitable.
  “ You mean that we can get the house
you spotted?” she asked.
  Sallin nodded. “ It’s being bought for
us now.” He looked out from their suite
in the Commodore over the ragged scar of
the subway excavation bordering blighting-
ly on Pershing Square. That he should be
looking upon that hole in the ground w'hen
the day arrived for him to go ahead on
the Norford prospect seemed to be a favor-
able omen. His smile maintained and his
eyes glinted. He reviewed the scheme fcr
the execution of which he had waited so
patiently.
  “ That’s a hunch, Vi,” he remarked.
  She moved to the window beside him and
laughed. “ Let’s hope,” she said. “ It’s
high time we put something over, Floyd.
Since that Michigan affair—” She paused
in thoughtful silence.
  The Michigan affair had been bungled.
It had cost Sallin two men—one shot dead
in the get-away, another wounded and cap-
tured. It had come near to costing Sal-
lin his liberty, and for many months had
176

caused him to lead an unobtrusive and un-
productive existence.
  Sallin drew her onto his knees. She
snuggled her head against his.
  “ The angels are with us,” Vi,” he
smiled. “ I was getting ready to go after
something—anything. The mob have been
getting fidgety. Duke Taylor and Mint
Odell are talking about cutting loose.
Think I’m losing my grip, I guess. We
can hold ’em with this Norford job cropping
up at just the right moment.”
  “ When we get away with this, Floyd ”
—her subdued blue eyes narrowed on him—
“ we’ll be set up so we won’t have to worry?
We’ll be able to quit?”
  Coaxingly she moved her head from side
to side against his, as she had a trick of
doing, her mass of dark hair rubbing his
graying thatch.
  “ If everything works out right—yes,”
he answered.
“ You’re going at it the way you doped?”
“ With only one change that I see now.”
His eyes were laughing as they turned to
hers. “ We’re going to make you over,
Vi, before we hit Norford.”
  “ Make me over? Why? I thought we
were to stay quiet while we’re there?”
  “ We will,” he agreed, “ but we won’t
be such hermits as we figured. Conditions
have changed since we spotted that place
two years ago. There’s a little neighbor
you’ll have to cultivate. A girl called Bessie
in the house next to ours.”
  “ Why?” she asked again.
  “ Because one Frank Denton is sweet on
Bessie,” returned Sallin. “ And Frank
Denton is cashier of the Bank of Norford.”
“ Oh!” Viola got his drift.
  “ Besides,” he added, “ it’s better to give
them plenty of description to work on.
They won’t see me, but they will you. So,”
he grinned, “ we’ll let them have something
brilliant to remember: we’ll make you a
red-head! ”
  Sallin did not think that he was calling
upon her to assume too much of the risk.
Neither did Viola consider that he was
doing so. It was necessary that one of
them should be visible to their neighbors.
There had to be some contact.
  A man cannot alter his appearance as eas-
   2	A
ily as can a woman. About all he can do
is let the hair grow on his face, or shave if
it already is there. He has not at his
command the many artifices that a woman
may use: the expert application of cos-
metics; the artful changing of the style of
dressing her hair, and of its color; the intro-
duction of a “ birthmark,” manufactured in
a beauty parlor and easily removable when
you tire of it; differently fashioned clothing
and millinery; the addition, innocent ap-
pearing enough, of a veil or furs which can
conceal half her features.
  In half an hour a woman may change her
appearance radically. Though he shaves a
beard or grows one, a man must continue
to expose distinctive features that cannot
be changed—ears, nose, and e3'es; the shape
of his face, round, oval, or long. He cannot,
without being conspicuous, heighten his
complexion or reduce it; he cannot fix his
hair so that the contour of his face is made
different; nor can he achieve the deceiving
result given by the substitution of a wide
floppy hat for a toque.
  Neither to Sallin nor the woman, there-
fore, did it seem that an unreasonable bur-
den was being placed upon her. They di-
vided the chances always. If it fell now
to her to hold the spotlight—as much of
the spotlight as they could not evade—that
was entirely fair. The likelihood of success
must be vastly diminished if, when they
fled, a description of Sallin could be flashed
over the country.
  Viola accepted her role, then, without
demur.
  “ I never have been a red-head, have I?”
she laughed. They had a way, these two,
of going light-heartedly into a dangerous
proposition. “ I’ll have a strawberry mark
on the left cheek, I guess, to match the car-
rots!”
  “ And tone up your complexion,” he sug-
gested further. “ You want a fair skin,
don’t you, to go with red hair? Make
yourself genteelly bright without being
noisy. You know. Remember that you’ve
just suffered a great shock—that tragedy is
with us in the person of dear Floyd!”
  “ Leave it to me,” she declared. “ I’ll
make the picture. When do we start?”
How long do you need to change your

spots?” he chuckled. “ You can’t do it
overnight?”
  She shook her head. “ That ’11 take a few
days.” She loosened her hair and let it
tumble over her shoulders. “ Being dark,
I’ll have to blond it some to make the
henna take. Three or four days and I’ll
have it blazing. That’s what, isn’t it—a
regular flaming top?”
  “ Yes. The wilder the better, so long
as it looks natural.” Sallin glanced at his
watch. “ Suppose you begin at once? Get
the blondine and the red stuff, and what-
ever else you need, and begin making over
w'hile I talk with Heusler. I’ve sent for
him. He’ll be here in fifteen minutes or so.”
Viola gave a final caressing rub of her
head on his and got up from his knees.
  “ Sam is cast for the doctor?” she queried
while she piled her hair back on her head.
  “ Uh-huh.” Having given her her in-
structions, Sallin desired to devote the time
until the arrival of Heusler to a review of
his scheme.
  Viola had expressed his own hope when
she had inquired whether this effort might
not make possible their retirement. Sallin
figured that he had been taking chances
long enough. He was due to put across a
really big job and quit. His luck could not
hold out forever.
  The bungling of the robbery in Michigan,
to which Viola had referred, had made him
pause. He had wondered then if his luck
was not overstrained. Superstitious, he had
read in that failure a warning, because for
years he had directed his mob with un-
varying success.
  With the patience that had ever charac-
terized his operations, he had waited till
the auspices should be favorable to tackling
one of the bigger prospects on his list.
  This Norford job he had schemed out
minutely long ago. The elements in it were
right. The engineering was well thought
out in detail. All that had been lacking
was the house that he had chosen while
looking over the ground. That house now
was available. The rest depended upon the
degree of adroitness with which his plans
were carried out.
  Gazing across Forty-Second Street, Sal-
lin noted again with satisfaction the exca-
vation that was an eyesore. He did not
find it such. To him it represented a hunch.
  On her way out Viola paused. “ How
much will we draw out of it, Floyd?”
  Sallin glanced at her dreamily. Then
for a moment his lips tightened and his
face hardened. He relaxed and, leaning
back with his hands on the arms of the
chair, he resumed his dreaming.
  “A million!” he said softly. “A mil-
lion sure, Vi—and maybe more!”
  With a quick step she was beside him.
Her head bent to touch his.
  “ A million!” she whispered with a long
breath. She gripped his arm. Her dull
blue eyes took on a sparkle. “ The biggest
yet, Floyd! We’ve got to put it over!”
  “ You bet we will!” He laughed quietly,
confidently. “ Just as soon as you become
a red-head!”
II.
  Sam Heusler was the man who acted
between Sallin and certain other members
of his organization. As the directing genius,
Sallin took the precaution of remaining an
invisible quantity to the lesser lights of his
mob, to those who could execute daringly
enough when told exactly what to do, but
who had not the initiative or the ability to
devise. It was advisable that he, as the
“ master mind,” should be known only to
his most trusted lieutenants.
  In this case it happened that in the
actual operation of taking a million dollars
or more from the Bank of Norford he re-
quired the services only of Heusler and two
others. These were Duke Taylor and Mint
Odell, in whom he also had implicit confi-
dence.
  Aside from the actual operation, how-
ever, in the preliminaries he had need of
several others, and these were of the type
to whom he preferred to be unknown.
Their mission would be among the people
of Norford, among the extensive population
of foreign-born mill workers.
  Heusler looked big and clumsy in com-
parison with Sallin’s slight figure. His
round, stolid face was the opposite of Sal-
lin’s keen, lively expression which even in
repose reflected the powerful, active, shrewd
mind.
RED FOR A MILLION.
179
  Usually Heusler served only as a scout,
ranging the country to pick out prospects.
The Norford Bank was one of his discov-
eries. He had reported it to Sallin as a
straight job. Sallin, checking up on it to
confirm the judgment of his scout, had seen
the greater possibilities. Therein lay his
genius—the faculty of looking deep and
evolving a plan that should take advantage
of everything that offered.
  The undertaking upon which he was now
embarking was to be the materialization of
Sallin’s dream. In the town of Norford he
had perceived the essential conditions for
the realization of his pet project, the am-
bition which he had nursed and pondered
over eternally—to snatch a million dollars
in a single haul. It was not exclusively
applicable to this one town. Norford was
to be honored merely because it was first
to present the opportunity. The field had
to be just right for the attempt. Norford
satisfied in that particular because of its
many foreign-born.
  But the taking of a million dollars from
a bank is something to be gone about
circumspectly. There could be nothing pre-
cipitate. For that reason Sallin had been
content to bide his time.
  Especially there was the matter of his
own location in the town. That had to come
about naturally. Anxiety to get into a cer-
tain house might well excite suspicion.
There must be no suspicion. For if he was
to get the million he had to have time to
bring it within reach!
  Banks outside of the great cities do not
carry anything like a million in cash; even
in the great cities few do. In a place the
size of Norford, with about forty thousand
people, an institution such as Sallin was
aiming at would have nothing approaching
a million. A hundred thousand, or up to
twice that sum, would be a liberal sum,
except in an emergency, for a bank carrying
the deposits of the Bank of Norford. Cash
lying in a vault earns nothing.
  Sallin, consequently, purposed placing
the million in the Bank of Norford before
taking it out. That is, he would be instru-
mental in placing it there.
  Because this was to be his grand slam
he was keeping the number of participants
as scant as possible. That was why Sam
Heusler was given an active part.
  “ You can get away with it, Sam,” said
Sallin. “ You’ll motor out from New York'
each day. That’s all. Motor out and
look as much like a doctor as you can.”
Heusler murmured acquiescence. Per-
sonally he would rather have stayed out of
sight. Had this not been scheduled as the
great coup, he would have demurred. But
he understood that if it were successful
the reward would be adequate. And, as
Sallin pointed out, the fewer that were in on
it, the bigger would be the split.
  “ I’ll take Taylor and Odell with me,”
said Sallin. “ They can spin a nickel to
decide which will be my valet and which’
the handy man round the house. Viola, of
course, will be along. Just five of us.”
  “ How about the outside men?” ques-
tioned Heusler. “ Don’t they—”
  “ That’s where you have to watch your
step,” interrupted Sallin. “ They’re not to
know what’s coming off. Their job is to
mingle with the people, the foreign element,
get acquainted, and follow orders. Who
are you going to get? Two or three will be
enough. We’ll give ’em a thousand apiece.”
Heusler rolled a cigar between his soft
fat hands. His rounded face wrinkled.
  “ I was thinking of Fiorella and De
Real,” he said. “ They ought to be able
to work their way into the foreigners. De
Real has been in Russia. He’s been mixing
with a Bolshevik bunch in New York.
That ’11 give him an introduction. Fiorella
can run loose among the Italians. Mostly
Slovaks and wops in Norford, you know.”
“ They’ll do,” said Sallin. “ Who else?”
“ There’s another Bolshevik called Kolin-
sky we could get. He’d be tickled at the
chance it would give him. He could go
round bragging afterward on how he helped
smash one little flock of capitalists.”
  “ That’s the idea,” approved Sallin. “ If
it looks like Bolshevist stuff that ’11 keep it
far away from us. There isn’t any way it
can connect with us, anyhow, unless you let
slip something to these birds, but we can’t
be too much on the safe side. Have it
look like Bolshevist stuff,” he repeated,
“ and we’ll be in good shape. We’ll give
them enough for expenses and on the face of
180

things they can plead that they are organiz-
ers for the radical crowd if they get into
trouble. Worst that can happen to them
then will be to get chased out of town as
undesirables.
  Thoughtfully, Sam Heusler stroked his
plump cheek. His gaze ranged over his own
considerable bulk. He was wondering how
much he would have to appear in public.
. “ How long’s it going to take?” he asked.
1	“ Less than a month,” said Sallin. “ We
may get through within two weeks. You’ll
send Fiorella and De Real and our other
Bolshevik friend over to Norford at once.
They’ll need time to get proper standing.
Don’t tell them what their real purpose
is until I give the word. That ’11 be when
we’re ready for the smash.”
  “ I won’t,” said Heusler. “ But—how
soon do we go there?”
  “ About a week.” Sallin grinned. “ We
have to wait on Viola. She’s out now get-
ting the dope to make herself a red-head for
a million! ”
 <
• That night Viola applied herself to an
intensive campaign with peroxide. After
that came the plastering of her hair with a
paste made from henna leaves as the Egyp-
tian and Persian woman does to achieve
the rich luster for which they are famed.
And to hasten the process she held her head
over a kettle steaming on an electric grill
in her room while Sallin stood by and mar-
veled at the transformation.
m.
  Norford is what is known as a model
town. While most of its population are
mill workers it presents none of the blight
of crowded tenements. They are a pros-
perous people; and were so even before the
war brought them increased opportunity to
labor at high waegs.
   Their prosperity and the wise fatherli-
ness of the authorities and the employers is
evidenced by the almost unbroken residen-
tial aspect of the town. It is a place of
green lawns and trees with ample space sur-
rounding the homes, few of which contain
more than two families. The mills lie off to
one side, the erection of dwellings having
trended away from rather than around
them, to maintain the desired model atmos-
phere. With this development the business
and shopping street came to be a pleasant
tree-lined thoroughfare of modern buildings
in keeping with the general plan and reach-
ing wrell into the heart of the better residen-
tial neighborhood.
  The house into which Sallin and Viola
moved was only one street from the busi-
ness artery. It was a neat two-storied struc-
ture set, like most of the homes in this dis-
trict, in the center of two wide lots.
  Its prime desirability, essentiality, from
Sallin’s point of view, lay in the fact that di-
rectly through the block from it was the
Bank of Norford. It was for this that he
had waited so long—to get the house that
was in the proper relationship to the bank
building for his purpose.
  The street on which he located was peo-
pled by business and professional folk. The
arrival of the new household w-ould thus
have passed by with no more than the po-
lite scrutiny that is given a newcomer, had
it not been for the remarkable appearance
of Sallin. That was sufficient to create
curiosity among the most uninquisitive.
  In the quiet of a summer afternoon, a
limousine drew up with Sallin and Viola
and Mint Odell, who had been lucky enough
to draw the post of valet.
  For a couple of days previously furniture
had been going into the house. Duke Tay-
lor accompanied it. A pardonable interest
therefore had been aroused and on verandas
round about the womenkind were seated to
obtain an initial glimpse at their latest
neighbors. The glimpse turned quickly into
a frank and concerted stare.
  Viola stepped first from the machine.
She guided Sallin as he alighted—for Sallin
could not see. His whole face w'as covered
with bandages—also his hands! He moved
with the groping step of a man recently
deprived of vision; his head tilted upward
pathetically as though by straining he would
see; his hands outstretched fearfully, with
an apparent dread that they might encoun-
ter an obstacle.
  With Viola on one side and Odell on the
other Sallin stepped gingerly up the walk
to the house. The strange procession was
RED FOR A MILLION.
181
almost inside before the whispering observ-
ers, now patently curious, noticed another
item of distinction: Viola's blazing red hair
showing beneath her small, modish hat.
  But for the spectacle of Sallin, Viola’s
hair must surely have been instantly the
center of focus. It was a glory triumphant
in the sunshine, compelling in its fieriness,
and dazzling. She had indeed reached the
peak of magnificence in carrying out Sallin’s
wish. She had attained a shade that was
brilliant yet alluring in its burnished tone,
that held the eye and made the beholder
marvel, but did not offend.
  It crowned her with a splendor at once
ravishing and baffling. Which was admir-
ably the effect she sought since the vivid-
ness of her hair distracted the gaze from
her features and seemed to make them gen-
erally indistinct. Her eyes, for instance,
of a pale blue that never was striking, now
appeared to be of a complex tint and quite
negligible; they would not impress them-
selves upon any one so that that person
could report positively their color. Her
mellowed skin, too, took from her violent
hair a deceiving depth of luster; her brows,
untouched and dark, mirrored a redness
that was not really in them.
  Viola had worked to perfection in re-
constructing herself for this adventure. In
her tender solicitude for Sallin, likewise, she
was well schooled. Those who watched
them enter the house on their arrival could
not but observe the gentleness with which
she aided his faltering feet up the steps; nor
the sweet gesture with which she placed an
arm about him as they went indoors.
  Had they been permitted to look through
the walls these good people certainly would
have been more amazed than they were by
the sorrowful picture of Sallin already given
them.
  No sooner was he inside than he started
to emit muffled words through the bandages
which covered even his mouth. His white-
swathed hands wagged peremptorily for re-
lief.
  Laughing, Viola headed him upstairs.
“ Run and see that the shades are drawn,”
she instructed Odell.
  As he went on she stopped Sallin on the
stair landing. No one could see them there.
With rapid fingers she undid a few pins
in the bandages at the back of his head and
the whole came away.
  “ Good Lord! ” Sallin grinned wryly and
mopped his face with his still enshrouded
hands. “ Whew! Believe me, Viola, it’s
hot inside that blanket. Why the devil
couldn’t we get a chance to pull this job
in the middle of winter.”
  Viola pulled off her hat and placed her
head against his in her favorite caress.
  “ I get the best of this, Floyd,” she said
gayly. “ Being a red head is easy com-
pared with being embalmed! But, say—
you sure did give this countryside some-
thing to chatter over. I got a flash at some
of them on their porches out of the comer
of my eye and they were hanging over the
rails, gaping.”
  Sallin joined her laughter. “ Then they’ll
have to look their fill mighty quick, Vi,”
he asserted, “ because we’re going to cut our
stay as short as possible. You’ll find me
smothered to death one time if I have to
wear that trapping too steadily. Here ”—
he extended his hands—“ get these nui-
sances off, too, and let me feel human
again.”
  She unmuffled his fingers and they went
on upstairs to the room where Odell had
pulled the shades.
  Odell grinned. “ You’re some freak in
that get-up, chief,” he remarked. “ How’s
it feel to be all burned up?”
  “ Try being embalmed, as Vi calls it, for
a few hours in this weather and you’ll
know,” returned Sallin good naturedly.
“ Hello, Duke,” he greeted his other aide,
who appeared in the doorway. “ How’s
everything?”
  Duke Taylor didn’t look any too cheer-
ful.
  “ Soft for Mint,” he declared, “ picking
the easy stunt. Say, chief,” anxiously, “ I
don’t really have to do anything that’s regu-
lar work?”
  “ You’re the cook and general houseman,
Duke,” smiled Sallin.
  “ You’ll make a nifty cook,” scoffed
Odell. He referred to the Duke’s appear-
ance which had won him his nickname.
“ I’ll sit by and coach you.”
  “ Don’t coach too hard, Mint,” inter-
182
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
posed Sallin. “ You’ll get a crack at labor
yourself once we get going.”
  “ Yeh,” said Taylor, “ and we’ll let you
do double time for what I do while you’re
coaching!”
  “ Beat it, you two,” put in Sallin. “ I
want to talk with Vi. You’d better chase
out to the hotel down street, Min, and order
dinner sent over. Don’t worry, Vi will do
the cooking. I want to live a while.”
  Odell and Taylor departed, the former
crowing over his soft berth, the latter fling-
ing back that he’d see Odell did his share.
Their squabbling, however, meant nothing.
They had been working too long together
to quarrel over the tasks allotted. They
respected one another’s talents as they re-
spected Sallin’s ability to conceive and his
generalship. Odell had earned his soubri-
quet from fellow craftsmen who conceded
that if given half a chance he could carve
a way into the mint! As a mechanic whose
expertness was similarly misdirected, Tay-
lor was no less capable. They were the
aces of Sallin’s mob.
  When they had gone Sallin peered from
behind the drawn shade at the rear of the
bank he intended to make disgorge a mil-
lion. His eyes brightened and he motioned
Viola to look.
  “ There’s the beauty,” he whispered.
“ Here’s where we’ll show them something
new.”
  Her head nestled against his. Silently
they regarded the stanch building with its
dead rear wall and heavily barred windows
on the sides. The immensity of their task
impressed the woman. She experienced a
quickening of the pulse. This was the first
job in which she had actively engaged at
the consummation. In others she had gone
ahead, spying and sizing up. It w-as the
only time in years, also, that Sallin himself
had taken the field.
  He noticed her become rigid and her
hastier breathing.
  “ Not nervous, Vi?” he asked.
  “ No—” but she laughed a trifle shakily.
Not with fear, but excitement. “ No; not
nervous, Floyd. But—it’s different, isn’t
it, when you actually get into the ring!”
Smiling, he put an arm over her shoul-
ders while still they bent watching the bank
building as a hunter watches the approach
of unsuspecting quarry.
  “ It’s different, Vi,” he said earnestly,
“ but there’s something in it that gets you.
Wait till we’re reaching out our hands—”
  He drew back from the window. His
voice lost its tensity. They had not ar-
rived at that stage. There were prelimi-
naries to be gone through before they would.
  “ See anything of little Bessie as we came
in? The house to the right.”
  “ There was a pretty girl on the porch,”
said Viola. “ Blond, not tall.”
  “ That’s Bessie. We’ll find an excuse to
get acquainted with her. She’ll be glad
to be the first to hear all about Floyd’s
frightful injury! It ’11 give her an edge on
the other folks—and help us out. The
sooner the quicker, Vi, so I can unwind
myself—”
IV.
  In the evening, Sallin, again “ em-
balmed,” sat outside with Viola. Her de-
votion to him was apparent to all who cared
to look, but not too effusive. Sitting on
the arm of his chair she leaned her head
affectionately alongside his while she talked
to him.
  The picture was inspiring, as it was de-
signed to be, and the consuming curiosity
of the neighbors increased to learn what
grievous mishap had befallen Sallin.
  The top of his head, they noticed now,
had escaped injury. That was because
Sallin felt that it would be only an extra
discomfort to swathe his head entirely.
The covering of his face was sufficient.
  Sallin did little more than nod or shake
in reply. It was awkward talking through
the encumbering bandages; and he was too
hot to be conversationally inclined.
  While apparently absorbed in him, Viola
watched covertly for the opening that would
give an answer to the curious. She wanted
to introduce herself to Bessie Wentworth.
  Miss Wentworth finally appeared and
made herself comfortable in a porch swing.
  “ There she is now,” Viola reported to
Sallin. “ I’ll run over.” She had not gone
to the next house earlier because it was
Bessie she wished to meet, not some other
in the family.
RED FOR A MILLION.
183
  “ I won’t stay long, Floyd,” she added.
“ I’ll hurry so you can get out of exhibition.
They’ve seen enough of you for one day.”
  Sallin flapped his muffled hands and mut-
tered unintelligibly. She couldn’t be too
fast to suit him.
  It was growing dusk as Viola crossed the
lawn. Bessie saw her coming and fluttered
expectantly. She would not of course be
rude enough to inquire, but she was just
dying to know what frightful accident had
happened to that poor man. Nevertheless,
Bessie appeared surprised when Viola spoke
softly over the end of the veranda.
  “ I wonder,” said Viola, “ if I might use
your phone?”
  Bessie jumped up. She wished there was
more light in which to see that gorgeous
hair. She stepped forward to where Viola,
smiling faintly and hesitant, stood at the
rail.
  “ Surely,” said Bessie. “ Come right in,
please.” She was doubly fortunate—she
would see the Titian marvel close at hand,
besides hearing probably about the man.
  “ I’m sorry to trouble you,” murmured
Viola, moving to the steps.
  “ No trouble,” assured Bessie, keeping
pace with her. It was a favor! Bessie
was scarcely twenty years old, and she was
positive that there was a thrill connected
with the newcomers.
  “ I am Mrs. Sallin,” Viola introduced
herself as they met at the top of the steps.
“ They haven’t connected our phone yet.
We just moved in to-day, you know.”
  Bessie tingled. She was aware of the eyes
directed at her from other verandas—en-
vious eyes.
  “ I’m Bessie Wentworth,” she returned,
and her hand went out. As Viola took it
she decided that Bessie was a lovable little
creature. She sensed the eager interest of
the girl, but did not hasten to satisfy it.
She would let that come about as a matter
of course.
  Bessie piloted her visitor into the house.
  “ I wouldn’t bother you,” apologized
Viola, “ but the doctor will be here in the
morning, and I have to get some things
from the drug store.”
  “ The doctor,” echoed Bessie with slight
insinuation. That was a lead; it ought to
bring the story. A glimmer of horrified
sympathy came to her face—sympathy that
conveyed an irrepressible outspoken query.
They were at the phone in the hall. She
withdrew while Viola talked over it, but
she could not help hearing the order for
surgical dressings, emollient oils and tinc-
tures, and oiled silk. But that didn’t tell
her much. She half concluded to put an
innocent question if Viola did not volunteer
information.
  “ Let me call mother to meet you,” she
said as Viola left the phone. It was a sin-
cere effort to be friendly, but it was also
a pretext to detain Viola. “I’m sure she
will—” She gave Viola no time to answer,
“ Oh, mother,” she called; and mother re->
sponded.
  Viola and the elderly woman exchanged
commonplaces. Viola was invited to stay
a while. She took the opportunity to
accomplish the real object of her visit, with-i
out appearing to advertise her affairs.
  “ I’d love to,” she said, and a sadness
crept into her voice, “ but I must get back
to Mr. Sallin. He ”—she gestured compas-
sionately, lovingly, and her eyes blinked—•
“ he isn’t able to do much for himself, and
the strain is wearing him out. I have to
remain with him.”
  Mrs. Wentworth was not so backward
as her daughter. She was a motherly soul.
She could feel the weight of the tragedy
that had so evidently stricken this couple,
“ How ”—she was genuinely affected—<
“ how did it happen?”
  Bessie trembled on tiptoe. It had been
a master stroke, the summoning of her
mother.
  “ An explosion,” replied Viola without
hesitation. “ A gasoline explosion.”
  “ Oh!” Now that the subject was up,
Bessie poured a question on top of her ejac-
ulation: “ He must have been fearfully
burned?”
  “ Terribly.” Viola nodded somberly;
then she smiled bravely. “ But he is
coming through all right. His eyes, by
some mercy, were not seriously injured.”
  “ And how—” repeated Mrs. Wentworth
after further expression of horror.
  “ A spark from nowhere,” answered
Viola. “ He was pouring gasoline from a
184
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
can into the car when—” She threw out her
hands.
  “ And his face and hands—” prompted
Bessie breathlessly.
  Viola shivered a little. “ Were, oh—I
cannot describe it! ” An air of thankfulness
came to her again. “ But he won’t be so
frightfully disfigured. At least we don’t
think so. He has just undergone a skin-
grafting operation which the doctors say
will make a wonderful difference.”
  “ It is dreadful that his face should have
suffered,” said Bessie.
  “ Yes.” Viola smiled wanly. “ Yet we
are grateful that it was no worse. It would
have been had his cap not been pulled down
and given some protection to his eyes.”
That explained how Sallin’s hair had not
been scorched off.
  Viola glanced over at the house where
he sat motionless, a bizarre figure with
the white of his bandages showing in the
faint light.
  “ I’ll have to go,” she added. “ It was
good of you to ask me to stay.”
  She had done well, she noted. Her re-
cital had won their hearts.
  Mrs. Wentworth caught her hand. “ If
there is anything at all that we can do,”
she offered, “ don’t hesitate, my dear.”
Bessie caught Viola’s other hand. She
was somewhat ashamed of her morbid in-
terest now that she knew how seriously poor
Mr. Sallin was afflicted.
  “ I wish there was something we could
do,” she said impulsively. “ You will let
us know if there is.”
  Viola’s smile was wistful. “ It’s dear of
you to offer,” she said gently. “ I’d love
to have you drop over and talk to me now
and then. I won’t be able to get away
much—Mr. Sallin feels so helpless. If you
will come sit with me sometimes—”
  She broke off, and a light glimmered in
her eyes. A man was coming up the path—
a young man. She had not expected to
make such rapid progress, to meet him so
soon. She assumed that he was Frank
Denton, cashier of the bank that was to
yield a million, and she was right. She was
departing, but Bessie restrained her.
  “ Oh, Frank,” said the girl, and he came
forward; “ I want you to meet Mrs. Sallin,
who has just moved in next door. Her
husband has had a terrible accident. This
is Frank Denton, Mrs. Sallin,” she smiled
prettily. “ You—you’ll see him often
here.”
  Acknowledging the introduction, Viola
laughed quietly, understandingly.
  Denton grinned. “ As often as possible,”
he declared.
  “ When I know you both better, I’ll
congratulate you more adequately,” said
Viola. “ But now I mu9t run—I’ve stayed
too long gossiping.”
  With their friendly words following her,
she tripped down the steps and rejoined
Sallin.
  “ Isn’t her hair won-der-ful! ” Bessie
watched her affianced as she asked that.
But there was a little pout on her lips.
She didn’t want him to think it was too
remarkable.
  The pout was not lost on Denton.
  “ Is it?” he responded guilefully. “ What
color is it?”
  “ Don’t you try to fool me, Frank Den-
ton,” proclaimed Bessie darkly. “ I saw
you staring your eyes out. Didn’t you,
mother?”
  Mrs. Wentworth backed away. “ You
can’t get me into trouble. You fight it out
with Frank.”
  Denton steered Bessie toward the swing
and the shadows.
  “ Of course I saw it,” he confessed; “ but
—pooh, it’s red. Now if it were golden—”
  And with a golden head on his shoulder
he permitted its owner to recount the ca-
lamity from which Floyd Sallin was recov-
ering.
  “ How’d you make out?” came Sallin’s
muffled accents as Viola bent her head on
his.
  “ Great! They’re nice folks, Floyd.
We’re over the first jump. I met Denton,
too. Come on inside and I’ll unmask you
and tell you about them.”
V.
  Queer doings began immediately within
the Sallin house.
  On that first evening a survey of the
RED FOR A MILLION.

upper regions was made by Sallin. With
daylight Odell and Taylor went to work
with fine saws that made hardly a sound,
cutting out the flooring and joists in the
attic. Every scrap of lumber that could be
taken with safety was removed.
  “ We’ll need it all,” said Sallin. “ Leave
enough to hold the roof for a couple of
weeks. We’ve got two thousand dollars
paid on this ranch. They can use that to
fix it up when we quit.”
  At intervals throughout the day the work
went on. Taylor and Odell sweated and
swore, but they stayed at it. They would
be well paid for their labor.
  The timbers were cut into lengths of
three and four feet and stacked in the cellar.
As he sized up the growing pile Sallin re-
marked that they would have to cut into
the second floor too.
  “ Hell, chief,” said Odell, “ can’t we
fetch in a load of lumber and save all this
work? These boobs never would tumble
to what it was for. Make out you’re going
to build a new porch or something.”
  “ A good idea, Mint—good,” derided
Sallin. “ It’s likely that we’d have a gang
of workmen hammering round here while
I’m so badly injured. I’m here for quiet.
We can’t have any noisy work going on.”
  “ Get on the job, Mint,” grinned Tay-
lor. “ Being cookie and chambermaid has
made you soft. This ’11 put you in trim for
what’s to come.”
  “ Yah!” said Mint with disgust; but he
went ahead because he knew that this prep-
aration was essential to the main task.
  Another incident that day was visible to
the outside. It was staged for the benefit
of the neighbors. That was the coming of
“ Dr. Perthwaite ” in the person of Sam
Heusler.
  Sam arrived in the forenoon in a luxu-
rious town car. He looked the part well
enough.
  On the porch with Sallin, Viola rose to
meet the “ doctor.” All three promptly
went into the house.
  As he was relieved of his camouflage and
sat down with a cigarette in his mouth to
kill the time that it should take to dress his
injuries, Sallin warned Heusler.
  “ You’ll have to be careful, Sam, that
none of our Bolshevik agents see you in
this town. They might follow to find out
where you call.”
  “ I’ll watch out.” Heusler stared at
Viola. “ My God, what hair! ” he exclaimed
in admiration. “ A woman sure has the
edge when it comes to make-up. Look at
me—” He ran a hand over his round
face, and his brows gathered. “ What
chance have I got of changing my map?
That complexion and hair make you some-
body else.”
  Viola laughed reassuringly. “ You’ll get
away fast enough, Sam,” she said soothing-
ly. “ Floyd’s going to let you have a day
or two start on us. That ’11 give you time to
get under cover.”
  “ You’ll be all right,” affirmed Sallin.
“ What did you hear from Fiorella and his
crew?”
  “ I got their daily report.” Heusler pro-
duced it. “ They seem to be getting next
to the natives.”
  “ Let’s see.” Sallin read the poorly writ-
ten letter. He smiled and nodded. “ That’s
good. They’re not having much trouble,
Vi, worming a way in. These foreigners
that this town’s been so good to aren’t so
pleased as they were a year ago. They’re
peeved about the shortening of hours—the
cutting out of overtime, that is—that’s been
coming about as the plants get back to
normal. They’ve been spoiled by the fat
pay envelopes they came to know through
the war.”
  “They’re grateful cattle!” said Viola
scornfully. “ Because they can’t keep their
faces in the trough until they’re gorged,
they listen to any burglar that comes along
talking soviet and the rule of the proleta-
riat.”
  “ That’s what,” agreed Sallin. “ But
we haven’t any reason to kick about that.
It helps our game. Say, Sam, you ought to
see the Duke and Mint on the job as house-
wreckers! They have the place half torn
apart already. Either of them would trade
jobs with you.”
  “ Yeh; I suppose so.” Heusler looked at
his watch. “ How long do I have to hang
around here? I’d just as soon not be.”
  “ You can go soon.” Sallin was not
186
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY,
pleased by Heusler’s attitude. Sam wasn’t
showing any too much nerve—nothing near-
ly commensurate with his bulk. “ You’ll
have to look after everything on the out-
side,” he said sharply. “ If there’s any
trip-up, it ’11 be on your end. How' about
that load of stuff? When’s it get here?”
  “ To-morrow,” replied Sam uneasily.
Sallin shouldn’t put the burden on him like
that. Heusler’s pudgy hands rolled on a
cigar. “ There won’t be anything go wrong
—outside of here,” he added.”
  “ Then ”—Sallin darted a glance at him
—“ nothing will go wrong anywhere. We
are under way—waiting for these boxes.
See they get here to-morrow. And now,”
he smiled, “ you’d better jack up Fiorella
and De Real and Kolinsky to open fire on
the moneyed interests. Tell them not to
lay it on too thick at the start. Just ooze
it out that if it wasn’t for the interests that
lend money the employers, the slave drivers,
couldn’t exist. Have them remind the
bohunks that it’s their own money that is
used in this way against them.”
  “ You don’t want to give them too much
to work on yet?” asked Heusler.
  “ No. Enough to get ’em tuned up.
We won’t be ready for the smash until
about two weeks from now. That allows
lots of time to get the yaps into line. If
they listen to our dope they ought to be well
primed.”
  “Humph!” Heusler grunted weightily.
He got up. “ I’ll get back to town. Noth-
ing else you want looked after?”
  “ That’s all just now.” Sallin frowned
slightly. “ You’re in an awful hurry, Sam.”
It was at once a question and a rebuke.
  “ Yeh.” Sam grinned wryly. “ I don’t
want to be seen any more’n necessary.”
There was a tinge of malice in Viola’s
comment: “ Wouldn’t hurt Sam to lend a
hand with a pick and shovel. You’re too
fat, Sam.”
  Heusler didn’t appreciate the humor.
  “ I’m too big for that,” he said quickly.
“ Besides, I’d make a funny looking doctor
with my hands all grubby.”
  “ You could wear gloves,” shrugged
Viola. Her pale eyes roved over him, then
went to Sallin. Viola was registering a
doubt about Sam—doubt about the wisdom
of having given him a more or less conspic-
uous part. “ Don’t take to wearing goggles
and a cap that ”11 make you look like a
stick-up,” she advised. “ Nobody’s going
to notice you much coming in and out of
here.”
  “ Maybe no,” said Sam. He tried to ap-
pear more at ease. “ That grafting opera-
tion I did on you is a big success, chief,”
he joked. “ Nobody ’d ever know your
face had been burned off!”
  “ You can set up as a specialist when
we’re done here,” remarked Sallin dryly.
“ You can chase along now. Get that load
here early to-morrow. We’ll be ready
for it.”
  Viola accompanied Heusler to the front
steps. As he continued down the walk to
his car she waved to Bessie Wentworth,
who was trimming a rosebush at the side of
her home.
  Bessie snipped off a dozen of the blooms
and held them up. Viola smiled acceptance,
and they went to meet each other.
  “ The doctor gave you good news to-
day?” queried Bessie anxiously. She was
intensely sorry for the sweet red headed
woman who bore her tragedy so bravely.
  “Splendid!” returned Viola. “He is
more optimistic than ever, and his promise
of complete success for the operation has
cheered Mr. Sallin greatly. So much so,
in fact,” she laughed delightedly, “ that
Mr. Sallin wants me to invite some folks to
visit us. You’d understand how wonderful
that is if you knew how despairing and con-
sequently nervous he has been.”
  “Oh, I’m so glad!” enthused Bessie.
“It must be— Oh!”
  She broke off with the exclamation as
Viola twined one of the roses into her hair.
The effect was almost startling, so vivid did
the white blossom become on that billowing
background of red.
  Viola grimaced in deprecation. “ It is
awful,” she remarked.
  “Awful!” Bessie was aghast. “It’s
adorable. I wish I didn’t have this old
blond hair,” she sighed. “ Anybody can be
a blond!”
  “ And I ”—Viola was amused—“ often
think of bleaching out this mop.” She
pushed it back on her forehead, and Bessie

satisfied another point of her curiosity—as
Viola hoped ;he would. Bessie’s glance
went keenly to the roots of the flaming
crown. She had had just a suspicion—
just a doubt that this was not all nature’s
own glory.
  But that suspicion was dispelled. Viola’s
hair was red clear down to the scalp. There
was no telltale hint of another shade close
to the roots, on the newest growth, to be-
tray that it had been dyed. Viola took
pains to insure that there was none, by
daily applications of henna; for she knew
that without constant attention that reveal-
ing margin would appear within a very few
days.
  For several minutes they bandied their
mutual envy, the red head favoring the gol-
den, the golden favoring the red. Then
Viola apparently was struck by a thought:
  “ Perhaps you’d take pity on us, since
Mr. Sallin is feeling so much better, and
run over this evening,” she proposed. “ You
can bring Mr. Denton. It won’t be very
exciting, of course, but—although he won’t
be able to join in our chatter I’m sure that
just having company will do Mr. Sallin a
world of good.”
  “ Why, yes; certainly.” It pleased Bes-
sie to be of even such small service.
“ Frank will be here. We’ll come over after
dinner.”
  “ It’s sweet of you,” said Viola gratefully.
“ Thanks ever so much for the roses—”
She pressed them to her face to hide the
twinkle in her eyes. Bessie was such a
dear, simple little thing it seemed a shame
to make use of her! “ We’ll look for
you—”
  “ After dinner,” said Bessie; and she re-
turned to her rose trimming while Viola
went in to report to Sallin on the further-
ance of her campaign to bring the cashier
of the Bank of Norford within reaching
distance.
  The visit of Bessie Wentworth and Frank
Denton to the Sallin house that evening was
without special significance except that it
paved the way for Viola later on to obtain
an invitation to look over the interior of a
modern bank vault. She led up to that by
displaying an amazing ignorance of bank-
ing and awe regarding those who engaged
in it.
  “ Doesn’t it scare you to have the money
of so many people in your safekeeping?”
she asked Denton. “ I wouldn’t sleep nights
for fear burglars were carrying away the
millions!”
  Bessie joined in Denton’s laughter. As
the affianced of a bank employee she had
a contact knowledge of the internal work-
ings.
  “ If you examined the box we keep it in,”
said Denton lightly, “ you wouldn’t be
afraid.”
  “ But millions!” repeated Viola. Perched
as usual on the arm of Sallin’s chair she
snuggled her head closer to his. “ Men go
to extremes for trifling sums. What
wouldn’t they dare to get at millions! I
shouldn’t imagine that any box would be
strong enough to keep it safely.”
  “ Anyway,” supplied Bessie with a su-
perior smile, “ there aren’t millions in the
bank. Are there, Frank?”
  “ Not generally,” he chuckled. “ You
see, Mrs. Sallin, we have to use the deposits
to earn money—lend it out—so that we can
pay interest and dividends.”
  “Oh!” Viola brightened as though she
had been let in on an extraordinary fact.
“ I never thought of that. Of course it
would be absurd to suppose that you kept it
all there. Still, the vaults must be tre-
mendously strong.”
  It was Bessie who issued the invitation.
“ We’ll go over some day and Frank will
show you through. It is truly remarkable,
the big vault, with its door so thick ”—she
measured in exaggeration with her hands—
“ and its walls—um! You’ll let Mrs. Sallin
peek, won’t you, Frank?”
  “ Surely,” Denton indorsed the invita-
tion. “ Drop in any day and I’ll show you
over. But you’ll be disappointed. It’s just
a great big safe—nothing more.”
  The red head nodded vivaciously.
“ That’s how it seems to you,” said Viola,
“but to me—well! And don’t you forget
that you promised! I’ll be in in a day or
two—soon, because I want to open an ac-
count.”
  With a trace of excitement she spoke
close to Sallin’s ear, relating that she was

to be permitted to inspect the insides of the
bank. He, poor chap, couldn’t engage in
the conversation on account of his covered
ears; but it did not detract from the pathos
of the picture that he had to sit practically
out of touch with the company except for
Viola’s constant caress!
  In her fondness for her new friend, Bessie
imparted an item of information which in
conjunction with his acquaintanceship with
Sallin was to have a result upon Denton.
  “ Another bank wants Frank to leave the
Norford,” she told proudly. “ He’s only
cashier over here. He’d be vice president
if he’d go to the Phcenix.”
  “ Congratulations!” exclaimed Viola. She
patted Bessie’s shoulder. “ You’ll be the
wife of a bank president before he’s
through.”
  “ I don’t care what he is,” confessed Bes-
sie with a flirt of her head, “ so long as
he—” She laughed, and in the darkness
extended a hand to Denton which he held.
  “ And are you going to change, Mr. Den-
ton?” asked Viola. “ It would be quite a
step up, would it not?”
  “ Yes—but—” Denton hesitated. “ It
would,” he added finally with gathering
brows, “ but I don’t know. The Phcenix,
you see, might expect certain things—that
certain accounts would go along with me
from the Norford. They haven’t said so,
not outright, but that is what they’d look
for.”
  Again Bessie evidenced her pride in him.
“ Frank has done a lot to keep the Norford
in front,” she declared. “ It’s the oldest
bank, and since the others came it’s had to
fight for business. It is a savings bank,
you know, Mrs. Sallin, but the others also
handle savings. Frank’s ideas have kept it
ahead. But for him it wouldn’t have all
the mill workers’ accounts, for one thing.”
“ Bessie thinks the institution would col-
lapse if I wasn’t there,” laughed Denton.
“ It’d go along just the same, Bessie.”
Plainly Bessie was skeptical.
  “ I don’t understand,” said Viola. She
maintained her role of ignorance. “ What’s
the difference between a savings bank and
any other?”
  “ A savings bank pays interest on all de-
posits,” explained Denton. “ Others pay
only on sums ranging upward from a thou-
sand dollars, and their rate is not so high.
That is on account of checking and other
privileges they give which do not go with
a savings account.”
  “ That’s it,” said Viola vaguely. She
came back to Bessie’s remark: “ And you
don’t think you’ll leave to go to this other
bank?”
  “ I don’t know,” said Denton again. “ It
is tempting because it will be a long time be-
fore further promotion offers in the Norford.
Not until some one dies as happened at the
Phoenix. I’ll have to talk with them some
more before I decide.”
  “ I think you ought to take it,” said
Bessie suddenly, inconsistently, in accord
with her woman’s license.
  “ And let the Norford go to smash!” he
grinned.
  “ You said it wouldn’t.”
  “ You said it would!”
   “ I didn’t.”
  “ Didn’t she, Mrs. Sallin?” Denton ap-
pealed for support.
  “ Can’t get me into any quarrel,” laughed
Viola.
  Bessie also appealed to her. “ He should
take it!”
  “ Why?” demanded Denton.
  “ Oh, because,” retorted Bessie without
logic. “ Don’t you want to be more than a
mere cashier? I’d rather be a Mrs. Vice
President!”
  “ It seems to me,” gurgled Viola, “ that
you’re doomed to be vice president of this
other bank, Mr. Denton.”
VI.
  The load of stuff which Sallin had ad-
jured Heusler to hurry conformed to the
general scheme—with the exception of
Viola’s hair—in that it was nothing to at-
tract unusual attention. On the face of it,
it was furniture—all furniture. But in it
were seven boxes which did not contain
anything resembling furniture.
  A few boxes, however, when some one is
moving mean nothing. They might hold
books or the accumulation of odds and ends
that belong to every household.
  The men on the truck who carried the
RED FOR A MILLION.
189
boxes into the house commented on their
weight, but had no suspicion of what they
contained. In line with his determination
to keep down to the limit the number of
participants in this, his greatest effort, Sallin
let the trucking be done by a regular con-
cern. Aside from the fact that it cut down
the possibility of capture—the fewer who
had knowledge of what was toward, the less
the risk—the name of the company em-
blazoned on the truck was in itself a dis-
arming sign of legitimacy.
  The heavy boxes, moreover, were of dif-
ferent sizes. Uniformity might have drawn
an inquisitive eye.
  The various pieces of furniture in the
load were distributed in their proper places
through the house. The boxes were left in
the lower hall.
  Immediately the truckmen had departed,
Taylor and Odell proceeded to open the
boxes. Sallin, who during the unloading
had remained on the veranda, removed his
bandages and superintended. This was
equipment that he had had ready for long,
in readiness for the chance when it should
come into play, and he wanted to see that it
was correct.
  “ The hose is in these five,” he pointed
them out. “ That one has the fans and
drills. This has the tanks. Once we get
the hose hooked up the labor will be done.”
  “ But until then,” grumbled Taylor, “ all
we have to do is work! How about getting
a couple of wops to do that and bumping
them on the skull when it’s done?”
  “ You have an idea sometimes,” favored
Odell. “ I’m for that.”
  “ And ideas often are disastrously expen-
sive,” voiced Sallin. “ Get it into your
heads now that this job has to be kept
tight among ourselves. Pry these boxes
apart and I’ll help you get the stuff down-
stairs.”
  Viola came in as Taylor slid a chisel
beneath the metal binding strap on the first
of the boxes.
  “ How long will it take to make the con-
nection, Floyd?” she asked. “ How far to
dig?”
  Sallin produced a map of the street copied
from that on file in the Department of Pub-
lic Works.
  “ We have twenty-four feet to go,” he
said. “ We can make it in four days. We
won’t rush.”
  Viola studied the map.
  “ What if there’s a cave-in?”
  “ Then the whole works goes blooey,” an-
swered Sallin grimly, “ and we travel fast.”
His eyes glinted on her. “ You’re not turn-
ing pessimist, Vi?” he added half irritably.
“ Let Heusler do the moaning. There won’t
be any cave-in. We’ll take our time to
avoid that.”
  “ That’s what I meant,” said Viola.
“ That it would be better to lose a day
than to take a chance of the ground giving
way.”
  Taylor and Odell ripped away the boards.
In the box were six lengths of stout hose
such as a fire engine uses for emergency
pumping. Each was four feet long and was
fitted with union clamps so that all could be
quickly joined together.
  Four more of the boxes produced similar
freight. A powerful valve was installed in
one piece of hose
  The sixth box uncovered two electric
drills with an abundance of points, a couple
of picks and shovels and crowbars, and a
nozzle for the hose. The latter also was
equipped with a controlling valve.
  From the other case came four cylindri-
cal tanks.
  “ There’s more of the gas to come,” ex-
plained Sallin.
  Odell’s eyes livened. He ran his hands
caressingly over the tanks.
  “ They’re the boys,” he gloated. “ If
only we didn’t have to go mining before we
can use them.”
  “ Aw, here’s the babies,” contented Tay-
lor, fingering the drills. “ We got to have
these in action before your blamed torch is
any use.”
  “ And without the torch your diamond
points wouldn’t be worth a dime,” jeered
Odell. He was of the oxy-acetylene school
while Taylor pinned his faith to the ability
of a tempered steel bit to go through any
plate that ever was built. “ Your drills’d
flatten like cheese on what we're going up
against, Duke.”
  “ Might take longer with them,” admitted
Taylor grudgingly, “ but if I have to I
190

can go through the whole job. You can
only go halfway—and the second half at
that.”
  “ I’ll show you,” snorted Odell. He
touched the weighty cylinders again with
loving hands—the two larger that held the
hydrogen and the pair half the size that
contained the oxygen. “ Wait till we get
going—”
  “ Meantime we’ll get going into the cel-
lar,” interrupted Sallin. “ We’re working—
not debating. There’s a matter of digging
leads the program.”
  They fell to work and soon the myste-
rious and burglarious assortment was down-
stairs beside the pile of lumber that had
been flooring and walls in the upper part of
the house.
  Guided by the map, Sallin marked off a
place on the cellar wall at the front of the
dwelling. The bank was forty feet from the
rear wall. They were heading in the oppo-
site direction from that.
  “ Drive straight in,” said Sallin, “ and,”
emphatically, “ don’t forget to shore up
every inch as you go. If there isn’t enough
lumber here now we’ll take the rest of the
house apart.
  “ Remember, we have to go under the
sidewalk. Safety first! If we don’t make
it solid all the way, we’re done.”
  Odell picked daintily at the mortar in the
wall with a crowbar.
  “ I’d let you go at it with that tooth-
pick,” hooted Taylor, “ if I wasn’t in a
hurry myself to get to hell out of here.
Come give us a help with this wire and see
how the drills eat that up.”
  They made the connection, and fifteen
minutes later Taylor was squatting over a
drill thrust against the wall and biting
through it.
  After the removal of one stone the task
moved more briskly. The hole permitted
leverage with the crowbar to be exerted on
the other masonry. Soon the aperture ap-
proximated a yard square.
  While his men started to run a shaft
toward the street Sallin resumed his
bandages on face and hands and, with
Viola, sat out again on the veranda. It
was Viola’s duty to look out for possible
callers and to listen with sharp ears for
any sound of the work going on under-
ground. It was not likely that they would,
but the bur rowers might prove too ambi-
tious and so sacrifice silence to progress.
VII.
  One cog in the Sallin machine slipped
and for the moment threatened to strip all
the gears. It was that which Sallin had
come to look upon as weak—the cog in
which Sam Heusler was the king-pin.
  The slip-up was Sam’s fault. In his in-
creasing nervousness at being in what he
considered too much of the limelight, he
imparted information to Fiorella, De Real
and Kolinsky which he should have saved.
He was premature in relaying instructions
to them
  The upshot was that on the fifth day
of Sallin’s sojourn in the town of Nor-
ford the presence of the three alleged radical
organizers became noticeable. Worst of all,
their endeavors won the interest of the bank
most involved. That was because Heusler
gave his agents too great latitude in their
agitation against the moneyed institutions.
  From what could be gathered in a hasty
investigation, the banks appeared to be the
principal target. And on account of the
ground on which the seed of discontent
was being sown, the Bank of Norford
found itself especially concerned. This
was because of the large number of foreign-
born mill workers on its books.
  Withdrawals of their balances by several
score of that class of depositors first caused
Frank Denton to wonder. He had a par-
ticular interest in these depositors, for he
had been instrumental in obtaining their
patronage. On his suggestion the bank had
sent representatives among them when they
were piling up high war wages, and had
convinced them of the benefits of opening
accounts and the greater security. At the
mills on pay days it had conducted a branch
and won over many who distrusted banks
but were becoming fearful about the ever
fattening stocking in the bottom of a trunk
at home or the growing bulge in the mat-
tress.
  Thus the Bank of Norford had stolen a
march on its competitors and had brought
RED FOR A MILLION.
191
into its keeping many 'thousands of dollars
which were being hoarded against the time
when their owners should return to their
native lands. Once having made friends
among these people, its patronage from
them had grown until at the period of Sal-
lin’s advent it carried on its books nearly
fifteen hundred of this class with deposits
aggregating two million and a quarter.
  The abrupt closing out of a number of
these accounts puzzled Denton. He had a
nodding acquaintance with the workers be-
cause he had cultivated them, and he had
the banker’s memory for names and faces.
When a dozen arrived in a group to with-
draw their funds, therefore, he talked with
them.
  His assumption was that they were about
to leave for the country which they still
regarded as home, and he inquired when
they were to sail. They shrugged, said
“ No goin’,” or something like that, and
evaded further questioning.
  When others followed rapidly on their
heels to close out their accounts he sat
up and took wide eyed notice. They gave
him just as little information as the earlier
comers—they were not leaving Norford;
but they wanted their money.
  Denton put the situation up to the presi-
dent. Having explained that almost three-
score accounts had been closed within two
days, he proposed that steps be taken to
learn the reason.
  “ We ought to send a couple of scouts
among them,” he suggested. “ There’s
something underhand going on. I—” He
paused on the thought and his face clouded.
  His resignation was on the desk of the
president, effective in thirty days. He had
accepted the vice presidency of the Phoenix
Bank. And he paused on the thought be-
cause of a sudden suspicion that the Phoenix
might have a hand in the affair.
  Denton was aware that much of the con-
fidence these foreigners had in the Bank
of Norford was due to confidence in himself
who had won them over in the beginning.
Was it not possible that the Phcenix was
spreading the w-ord that he was going over
to it and capitalizing his popularity to wean
depositors from the Norford?
  H. H. Trainor, the president, looked
 at him quizzically. He read Denton’s
thought.
  “ You’re going away from us, Frank,” he
said quietly.
  Denton flushed angrily.
  “ But that can have nothing to do with
it,” he declared. “ I don’t believe—I can’t
believe—that the Phcenix would play a trick
like this. I don’t believe they could get
away with it if they did. We—the Norford
always have treated these people right. We
have helped them in every way possible—
transferred money to their native countries
at the most advantageous rates of exchange;
protected their relatives and friends coming
to this country by putting them into the
hands of reputable agents during the jour-
ney. No; it can’t be the Phoenix. And
yet—”
  He stopped again doubtfully. What
other explanation could there be?
  Trainor refused to be perturbed.
  “ You’re fidgety, Frank,” he smiled.
“ You’ve been imagining things since the
Phoenix started to take you away from us.
Now' you think you’ve discovered something
to hang your fidgets on. A few withdraw-
als can’t make any impression. That they
occurred in a group is only coincidence.”
  “ That may be so,” argued Denton;
“ but let’s see if we can locate a reason.
Call in Jenkins to hunt out the source. I
know these people, Mr. Trainor, and they
know me. But I could get nothing definite
from them—only that they wanted their
cash.”
  “ Well, call Jenkins if you want to,”
granted Trainor good naturedly. “ He has
our retainer and we might as well use him
once in a while. Have him come over,
Frank, to look for your mare’s nest,” he
laughed.
  So, Jenkins, head of an agency that op-
erated for banks in the metropolitan dis-
trict, was summoned to Norford. He came
next day; and by then the president of the
Bank of Norford was beginning to sit up
too. Another dozen of the mill workers had
withdrawn their accounts.
  Sitting in Trainor’s office, the detective
heard Denton out. The cashier now did not
hesitate to voice his suspicion that the
Phcenix Bank was at the bottom of it.
192
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY,
  “ Still,” he added to be fair, “ I can’t
find that the cash being taken from us is
going to the Phoenix. It seems to be going
to the ancient and easily pilfered stocking
bank.”
  “ Any sign of con artists in town?” asked
Jenkins, a mild mannered little man of
cheerful mien. “ With a good line of gold
mine or oil stock?”
  “ Not that we have heard,” replied
Trainor. “ Though that would offer a fair-
ly reasonable explanation.”
  “ It isn’t it,” negatived Denton. “ These
people don’t buy stock. Now and then one
falls for a con game, but they don’t fall in
bunches. No. There’s some sort of propa-
ganda going on, and we’re feeling the brunt
of it because we have more of the foreign-
ers’ money than the other banks.”
  Jenkins’s expression was bland, but his
mild eyes focused on Trainor. He put an
indirect question.
  “ I can’t figure where any one would
gain by knocking your bank,” he remarked.
“ You’re sound enough—yes? It could not
affect your stability, even though there
were wholesale withdrawals.”
  “ Good Lord, no—certainly not!” puffed
Trainor. “Not if every nickel was taken
out. If we liquidated to-morrow we’d show
a tidy surplus for distribution. Nobody
could be crazy enough to attempt to injure
our credit by pulling out a few thousands.”
“ Have the examiners been in lately?”
Trainor laughed at that because he knew
Jenkins. Had the query come from any
one else on top of what he had just said,
he might have resented it. He understood
that Jenkins did not dispute his statement,
but was simply completing a thought. Jen-
kins always completed his thoughts.
  “ They were here a month ago—less than
that,” said Trainor. “ If you find there’s
a conspiracy against us,” he went on
thoughtfully, “ we’ll have them in again to
demonstrate that we’re O. K.”
  “ If there’s a conspiracy,” said Jenkins
shrewdly, “ you would only hurt yourself
by having the examiners back so soon.
Those on the outside would read it as con-
firmation that something was wrong.”
  “ Umph. That’s so.” Trainor showed
a trace of worry. He began to see that
  there might be something serious going on.
“ Go ahead, then, Jenkins. You’ll have to
go after it in your own way, for I’m blessed
if I can offer any suggestion of what to
look for. It seems like an idiotic proposi-
tion to be wasting time on.”
  “ If we can turn up anything, it will be
time well spent,” said Denton. “ If there
is nothing to turn up—well, we played on
the safe side.”
  Sallin’s judgment in scraping acquaint-
ance with Frank Denton was justified that
night.
  Bessie Wentworth was over chatting with
Viola, as she had fallen into the habit of
doing, when Denton arrived. He joined
them.
  Bessie again proved an unconscious ally.
She remarked on Denton’s preoccupation.
  “ You look worried, Frank,” she said.
“ You don’t want to leave the bank,” she
challenged.
  “ It isn’t that.” Denton tried to shake
off his perplexity.
  “ Then, what is it?” she insisted. Den-
ton couldn’t be allowed to have any se-
crets.
  He saw no objection to mentioning the
puzzling circumstance before the Sallins.
  “ It isn’t anything serious,” he said;
“ only—we can’t make out why so many
of the mill workers are closing out their
accounts. Nearly a hundred have done so
in the last two days.”
  “ Is that all! ” Bessie could not see the
matter as of much moment. “ That can’t
ruin the bank!”
  Viola bit her lip and her arm tightened
warningly on Sallin’s shoulder. She hoped
that he could hear. The bandages had been
reduced to a bare covering over his ears.
She pinched him to pay heed.
  “ No—but—” Denton pursed his lips
and gestured. “ No,” he repeated, “ but it
strikes us as so queer that we’ve put de-
tectives to work to discover the reason.”
   Viola felt Sallin start.
  “ It would make a big cut in the bank’s
business,” explained Denton to Viola, “ if
all these foreigners drew out. They have
over two millions on deposit.”
  Viola smothered a quickening of her
                          2	A

breath. She knew that this was not on the
schedule.
  “ Oh,” she said rather inanely, vaguely,
to intimate that she in a distant manner
appreciated the situation. “ But what if
the detectives learn anything? What can
you do? Can you make these people leave
their money in the bank?”
  “ Not if they don’t want to,” laughed
Denton. “ If we could show a conspiracy,
however, and that is what it seems like,
we could prosecute, and restore the confi-
dence in us that evidently is being under-
mined.”
  “ I see,” said Viola slowly.
  Sallin stirred, lifting a shrouded hand.
She bent her ear to his lips, and he mut-
tered through the bandaging.
  She smiled apologetically on Bessie and
Denton.
  “ I’m going to send you folks home,” she
said with a laugh. “ Mr. Sallin is tired and
wants to go indoors. You don’t mind? And
please ”—she was sweetly pleading—“ do
not let my sending you away keep you from
coming again. You won’t? Promise!”
  They promised and retired to the greater
intimacy of the swing at Bessie’s house
Denton was not displeased over that.
Neither was Bessie, really, although she
did not begrudge the time she spent in
Viola’s company. Viola had been through
such a trial and had borne it so coura-
geously.
  In the privacy of the house, with his
mock dressings removed, Sallin swore
whole-heartedly. His fists clenched and his
face was hard.
  “ Damn that fool Heusler,” he wound
up. “ He’s let these rats get away from
him. But, by Heaven, he’s got to hold
them—repair the damage they’ve done.
Or ”—his lips pulled coldly thin—“ or Sam
Heusler ’11 wonder what’s happened to him
—if he’s able to wonder in the here-
after!”
  Viola let him alone as he raged. She felt
as he did. But wisely she maintained si-
lence. All that could be done to rectify
this premature development was, as Sallin
had said, to make Heusler put a check-rein
on De Real, Fiorella and Kolinsky.
  Heusler would come in the morning. She
     3 A
pictured the lashing Sallin would give him.
She could not conceive that that lashing
of Heusler was to cause the cog that already
had slipped to go farther out of mesh.
VIII.
  Heusler sulked when Sallin lit into him.
At the end of the tirade he attempted to
defend himself, to criticize and shift the
fault to Sallin himself.
  “ You can’t blame me for what these guys
do,” he asserted with fair vehemence, for
he was sore. “ It’s a crazy stunt, having
them there, anyhow. How d’you expect
them to do anvthing but mess things up?
What—”
  “ I expect you to make them unmess
things,” interjected Sallin icily. “ You’ll
get in touch with them—quick—now. I
don’t care what chances you run. Get to
them and hold them down. It’s up to you,
Sam.”
  Under his gaze Heusler squirmed. He
moistened his fat lips and opened them to
speak.
   Sallin’s voice, incisive, threatening in its
quiet, checked him.
  “ There are no two ways about it, Sam.
You handle your end of the job right, or
you quit. And ”—he smiled sourly—“'if
you quit, it will cost you a hundred thou-
sand dollars. I let you in on this because
it was one of your prospects. I’ll let you
out—fast, without a nickel divvy.”
  “ What can I do?” mumbled Heusler.
He didn’t take to the notion of being
ditched, now that the big job w’as well
under way. “ You told me not to be seen
in town here by De Real or the others.
How can I get to them now? I’ll have to
wait till they can come to me in New
York and—”
  “ You’ll chase them up as soon as you
leave here,” ordered Sallin. “ Tell them to
soft pedal these hunkies that are with-
drawing their cash. If that isn’t done at
once, everything ’11 be shot to pieces.” His
narrowing eyes increased Heusler’s discom-
fort. “ That, Sam,” he purred, in addi-
tion, “ would be unfortunate for you.”
  Heusler squeezed his cigar flat between
his fingers and glowered at the remnant.
194
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  “ And you’d better hustle,” advised Sal-
lin. “ Get to your men and set them right
before the detectives working for the bank
get a line on them. If they beat you to it,
the cops will make you, Sam, and ”—his
face froze again—“ that, also, would mean
that we’d be through.”
  “ All right,” said Heusler. There was
nothing,else to say. There was nothing to
be gained by arguing with Sallin. Sallin
had the whip hand, inasmuch as he could
discard Heusler and have some one else
carry on the outside work. He switched
the subject to safer channels.
  “ How are you making out down below?”
He jerked a thumb toward the cellar.
  “ We’re making out all right,” Sallin
spoke crisply, “ if you don’t ball us up
again. I want the truck to come through
here to-morrow at one o’clock. Jake will
drive it himself. He knows what he has
to do. And have him bring his owner’s
license so that he can put the truck up as
bail if he gets pinched. Understand?”
  “ Yes.”
  “ Make sure that Jake does.”
  Heusler acknowledged with a grunt. “ I’ll
go now and bawl out De Real and the
other birds,” he said without enthusiasm.
“ They got to lay off, huh?”
  “ Don’t go at them too strong,” revised
Sallin. “ They’re hard guys, Sam. And,”
he gave them credit, “ we have to admit
that they’re good workers. Trouble is that
they’ve got the hunkies going too soon. You
needn’t tell them that the fly cops are on
the job. Might scare them. But tell them
to show their control is right by holding the
mob in check for a few days.”
  For the second time, however, Sam Heus-
ler neglected to carry out instructions to the
letter. As he had overstepped in giving too
much material to the three man sent among
the mill workers as agitators, he erred again
by being too liberal—w'ith abuse.
  He did not meet the disturbers in Nor-
ford, but he did get into communication
with them before leaving for New York.
That was as far as he was willing to go;
despite Sallin’s threat, he refused to be seen
with them. He got De Real on the phone
finally and had him come on to the city.
  “ And before you start,” he snapped,
“ tell Fiorella and Kolinsky to lay off until
they see you again. I want them to crawl
into a hole and stay there.”
  His talk face to face with De Real was
all to the point. The Spaniard’s eyes glint-
ed several times as he listened and his sal-
low face wrinkled; but he held his tongue.
He wanted to understand this deal more
before he quarreled with the man who ap-
peared to be running it—with Heusler. He
did not believe Heusler was the head; he
wanted to know exactly who was.
  “ So?” He took his call-down suavely,
although it had been rough enough in spots
to make his fingers itch toward a knife
sheathed lengthwise along his belt. “ They
are taking their money from the bank too
soon.” He spoke with quiet precision of
language. “ We are to make them stop?
I comprehend.”
  “ Then see that Fiorella and Kolinsky
comprehend,” said Heusler meanly. It was
a new experience browbeating a man of this
type, a dangerous man, and Sam enjoyed it.
He remembered some of the things Sallin
had said to him and adapted them.
  De Real’s teeth showed in a smile. “ I
shall remember,” he said smoothly, and he
meant it—two ways!
  On the way back to Norford he smiled
often over the situation. Some day he
might have the pleasure of inserting his
knife capably between Sam Heusler’s ribs
for the words that had been spoken. Mean-
while he could shrug—and wait. Also, he
could assuage his injured feelings to some
extent by pouring upon Fiorella and Kolin-
sky the flood of Heusler’s vituperation with
embellishments.
  Fiorella exploded when he heard it.
  “ Let’s stick him up for the rest of our
dough an’ quit the big bum,” he advo-
cated. “ We can—”
  De Real quietly negatived that.
  “ It’s fanny business,” he said meaning-
fully. His slim fingers strayed along his
belt. “ Heusler does not serve himself. He
works for—you know—the big chief. When
it is done ”—his eyes shone craftily—“ we
might make Heusler—pay more. Yes?”
  “ We can cut in now,” began Fiorella,
but De Real shook his head.
RED FOR A MILLION.

  “ It is not well to cut in on him unless
he invites.” By “ him ” he referred to Sal-
lin; and, knowing of Sallin, Fiorella took
back his proposal.
  Kolinsky backed De Real’s course. His
wide mouth gaped twistedly.
  “ Heusler ’11 be easy,” he contributed.
“ What they doing, Real?”
  De Real answered with his leisurely, ex-
pressive shrug.
  “ After a while we shall know. But,
this I learned from Heusler: He comes to
this town. We shall discover where he
goes.”
IX.
  Sallin crept from the tunnel back into
the cellar of the house. That much was
done—and well done. He looked upon it
with complete satisfaction. Taylor and
Odell had been careful; their job would
stand.
  Roughly, the shaft was three feet square.
Above it was a good four feet of solid
ground. There would be no severe strain
upon that, not even at the outermost end
where the shaft projected for a yard or so
beyond the curbing. Even there no appreci-
able load would pass; nothing heavier than
an automobile which was not sufficient to
break into the underground excavation.
Foot by foot it had been shored up with the
lumber taken from the upper floors. And
already most of the earth had been disposed
of through the drain in the cellar, the grat-
ing of which had been removed.
  Although an eighteen-inch electric fan
drove a current into the tunnel, Sallin came
out sweating.
  “ Good work,” he said approvingly. “ A
couple of hours and you'll be through boil-
ing in there.”
  “ Wish it was headed the other way,”
regretted Odell with a glance in the direc-
tion of the bank. “ Look at those hands ”
—he held them out, raw and callousing
from the plying of pick and shovel—
“ damned good thing there’s no fine work
to do.”
  “ It ’11 be well paid labor,” returned Sal-
lin. “ We’ll run the hose in now.”
  They fell to and linked up the hose, a
task made simple by the adjusted and close
fitting junctions. The section containing
the valve was taken into the tunnel sepa-
rately. The hooked-up length was pushed
in so that it extended from the cellar to
the small chamber with which the tunnel
terminated.
  Through the chamber ran the water main.
But for its presence on this side of the street
Sallin never could have attempted to exe-
cute in Norford what was to be his great-
est triumph. Here was one of the details
for which he had been compelled to look
before he could build. It represented an-
other of the essentials to success, exact
knowledge of which always had character-
ized his operations. He never took a step
without knowing just what was in front.
  The rust scales on the water main were
broken by a circle that cut into the pipe
itself. But not too deep for safety. This
was a delicate part. Should the pipe give
way before they were ready, their plan
would be frustrated. They never could
manage to plug the break. Not only would
they be washed out. but the break must
soon be discovered when the flow of water
loosened at houses farther along the main.
  This was a stage at which they had to
go slowly until conditions were created to
their advantage. Then they would have
to work with greatest speed; for they could
not know how long a time would be given
them.
  Sallin crowded into the tunnel. Taylor
and Odell were in the chamber, cramped
but with room enough to work. There was
not space enough for Sallin.
  “ You have everything handy?” he asked
tensely.
  Taylor and Odell swung the portable
electric lamps with which they lighted the
place. Odell looked to the connections of
the torch with the oxy-acetylene tanks.
That was his chief concern and would come
into service first. Taylor saw to it that a
pipe threader, cans of packing and red lead,
and strips of thick canvas to be used as
binding on the joint, were within reach.
   “ All set, chief,” they reported.
  Sallin looked at his watch. “ It’s twelve
thirty,” he said. “ If we run on schedule
you’ll begin to tie that hose up to the main
a few minutes after one o’clock. You don’t
196

have to stay in here until then. Get out
where there's some air. I’ll come down and
pass the word when to stand by—when
Jake appears. Viola will let us know when
he pulls his stunt. It ’11 be Go! after that.”
Upstairs, Sallin sat beside Viola, who
watched from a window commanding the
street. She bent her head against his.
  “ What happens, Floyd, if there’s a flood
we can’t control?”
  There was recklessness in Sallin’s laugh,
but also confidence.
  “ We get up and run, Vi,” he answered
fliply. “ The farther away we are when
they locate it, the better for our health.”
  “ You’ll have time to cover up your
face?” Concern clouded Viola’s counte-
nance.
  “ I won’t take time,” said Sallin. “ I’ll
want to see where I’m going.” His tone
harshened. “ Heusler should be here with
the car to get you away. Sam has a yellow
streak. He’s waiting till the show is over
before he comes along. He’s looking after
his own fat hide.”
  Viola’s head rubbed back and forth on
his.
  “ I wouldn’t go anyhow without you.
We’ll simply walk out quietly if things
break bad. You go first—I’ll catch up on
you round the corner. The Duke and Mint
will take their chances?”
  “ Yes. They’re game, otherwise they
wouldn’t be in that hole down below.
Good girl, Vi.” He squeezed her. “ We
won’t have to go, though. We’ve waited
too long for this. Look out now ”—he
shoved her gently to the window—“ so we
won’t miss Jake. He’ll give us a bray of his
siren, but—”
  The shrill cry of a motor horn sounded.
Viola’s teeth bit into her lips. She pressed
close to the window, but was careful to re-
main out of sight behind the curtain.
Sallin jumped up.
  “ The truck?”
  “ Yes! ” whispered Viola. “ Coming! ”
  Sallin bolted downstairs.
   “ In!” he called.
  Taylor and Odell scrambled into the tun-
nel. At the cellar end of it Sallin squatted,
watching the stairs for Viola to bring the
word that Jake had done his work.
  Breathlessly Viola saw the truck pass the
house. It was moving about ten miles
an hour. Not fast enough to demand more
than a passing glance, but still fast enough
to accomplish its object. After that one
blast, the siren had remained silent. Hav-
ing signaled his arrival, Jake knew that
more and unnecessary noise on that quiet
street probably would attract onlookers to
what he was about to do. Although it
would appear to be an accident, he did not
desire witnesses.
  Approaching the corner past the Sallin
house, Jake glanced sharply about him.
Back of him along the street two women
were walking in the same direction as he
was going. Ahead of him were a few other
pedestrians, but they were not facing him.
  Making to round the corner, he stepped
on the gas. The truck picked up as he
threw over the steering wheel. He took the
corner short, lumbered over the sidewalk,
and struck a fire hydrant.
  Under the impact of the T-beam guard on
the front of the truck the cast iron hydrant
shattered. As the truck lurched back into
the street, a geyser shot into the air.
  Stopping the truck, Jake jumped down
and stared with dismay at the damage he
had done. Then like a good citizen he de-
cided to call for help. He made his siren
blare.
  People tumbled from their homes to stare
helplessly at the torrent of water spouting
from the wrecked hydrant.
  “Hell!” said Jake at large, letting up
on the siren. “ What you know about
that?”
  Women and children gathered, and men
home to lunch, but no one did anything
until a policeman appeared in response to
the shrilling horn. He took one look and
ran on into the nearest house to phone for
the water bureau’s emergency wagon.
  Jake was quick to grasp his opportunity.
While all were absorbed in the shooting
water, while the policeman was absent, Jake
went under his truck, which was lying at
right angles across the street. With a
wrench taken from his pocket he loosened a
bolt in the steering gear. He was out from
under the car before the policeman reap-
peared.
RED FOR A MILLION.
197
  Jake was looking ruefully at the machine
and scrubbing his chin when the policeman
came over and demanded what was the
trouble.
  “ She just ran crazy,” replied Jake.
“ Steering gear out of business, I guess.”
  He reached up and jiggled the wheel. It
moved with wide play that did not affect the
wheels.
  The policeman nodded understandingly
“ How fast were you going?”
  “ ’Bout six-eight miles. You see how
quick I stopped.” He had had his brakes
specially lined to insure stopping in a short
distance.
  The policeman did not question the ex-
planation, but told Jake to stick around
because he’d have to go to the station house
to make a statement.
  “ I’ll get the truck moved out into the
street,” said Jake and had another driver
who had come up tow the truck to the curb.
  Meanwhile the emergency wagon arrived.
Its crew paused only to glimpse the flood
then ran through it up past Sallin’s house.
  From the sidewalk Viola observed them
pull up two blocks away. That was where
the pipe serving this street and others
branched from the principal water main.
As the repair crew raised the manhole cover,
she turned to watch the spouting hydrant.
The instant the flow dwindled there, indi-
cating that the water had been shut off. she
hurried into the house.
  From the cellar steps she called to Sallin.
He relayed the information into the tunnel.
  In Odell’s hands the oxy-acetylene torch
flared. The searing flame ate through the
water pipe, following the circle already
marked out.
  A minute and the bit of iron was cut
away. Water poured through the hole, but
it was only the dregs and did not interfere
with the threading of the tap and the in-
sertion of the hose.
  The packing and lead were slammed into
place, the strips of canvas bound fast about
the joint. A strong clamp was set about
the brass end of the hose and screwed to
the main.
  An hour before the hydrant could be re-
placed Sallin had the water pressure with
which he purposed driving silently and with
a minimum of labor into the bank from
which he was to take a million—a million
that he first had to cause to be placed there.
X.
  To Viola fell the duty of prying from
Bessie Wentworth and Frank Denton in-
formation about the progress of Jenkins’s
investigation into the withdrawals from the
Bank of Norford. She did that cleverly,
without arousing suspicion.
  Bessie was ready clay; it was from her
that Viola learned the name of the detec-
tive, a point gained in an inconsequential
way the day after Denton mentioned Jen-
kins’s presence. Viola knew when not to
appear to be seeking information.
  Denton was but slightly less communica-
tive when the situation began to show im-
provement. He had no reason in the world
for supposing that Viola had an ulterior
motive. She never manifested any great
interest; but she fashioned her questions
adroitly when the subject came up. Hav-
ing told her along with Bessie when the
affair developed, Denton saw no harm in
letting her know what was being unearthed.
   The day after Jenkins took up the thread
a few more accounts were closed. On the
succeeding day, however, the movement vir-
tually ceased.
  Trainor, the president, then smiled an
“ I told you so,” and, his own misgiving
allayed, rallied Denton as being scary.
Jenkins so far had been unable to pin the
sudden shyness of the depositors on any
fixed cause. The return to normal was
ascribable only to the promptings of De
Real, Fiorella. and Kolinsky, who persuad-
ed their dupes that the time to smash this
group of capitalists had not arrived.
  On the fourth day of Jenkins’s inquiry,
Viola joined Bessie and Denton soon after
the latter’s appearance at the Wentworth
house. She had to keep in close contact to
find out whether the activities of the three
agitators continued to escape detection.
   It was apparent to her at once that Den-
ton was divided between pleasure and
doubt. Bessie also noticed his mingled
feelings and it was she who broached the
subject.
198
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  “ You look as though some one had
stroked you the right way, Frank,” she com-
mented, “ and then some one had stroked
you the wrong way. Your depositors aren’t
running away from you again”
  “ No.” Denton half frowned, half smiled.
“ We have the same number that we had
this morning—two more, in fact.”
  “ You’ve started, then, to make up the
loss that alarmed you a few days ago,”
interposed Viola conversationally.
  “ Well, yes, but—” Denton hesitated.
  “ But what?” commanded Bessie.
  “ My alarm was justified to-day. It was
my turn to ‘ told you so.’ ”
  “ Why” Bessie advanced the query while
Viola held her breath.
  “ Jenkins turned up something,” said
Denton.
  “ Jenkins” Viola cocked her red head
and looked interrogatively, seemingly un-
able to place the name.
  “ The detective,” explained Bessie.
“ What was it, Frank? Was the Phoenix
Bank the instigator?”
  “ I’m glad to say it was not. And sorry,
too,” he laughed, “ because if it were we
would have something tangible on which to
base a prosecution. As it is,” he gestured,
“ we’ll have to let things run along—un-
less we can get something on these men
and put them in jail or drive them out of
town.”
  Viola turned her face into the shadows.
She quivered, waiting for Bessie to seek fur-
ther enlightenment.
  Bessie did. “ What men? You’re talk-
ing in riddles, Frank. If you’ve found the
men who were scaring off the depositors,
why can't you prosecute them?”
  “ Because there is no evidence of con-
spiracy. They are simply radical agitators
who are trying to stir up the mill workers
with soviet talk and down-with-capital
stuff. We felt the effects of their spell-
binding because we have practically all the
savings accounts from among the foreign
element.”
  Viola spoke tentatively, as one groping
for understanding.
  “ If they have been trying to destroy
your business, why can’t you have them
arrested?”
  “ That’s the difficulty,” repiied Denton.
“ They have not been trying directly to de-
stroy our business. All they have done is
to indulge the right of free speech. There
is no law forbidding verbal attack on what
they call capitalism. If, as a result of their
talk, some persons are influenced to think
they can injure capital by such measures as
withdrawing their cash from a bank, the
agitator cannot be held responsible in law.
You see what I mean?”
  “ Partly—I think so,” smiled Viola. Den-
ton was an obliging and helpful chap! Since
he had expounded for her benefit, there was
no danger in asking him to go on. “ Then
you can only watch them until they some-
how break the law?”
  “ There’s where we’re rather helpless,”
admitted Denton. “ They’re careful usual-
ly to stay within the law. That breed
knows its game.”
  “ You can watch them, though,” per-
sisted Viola, “ and, knowing what they are
about, forestall them. Do they know that
you have discovered them?”
  “ Not if Jenkins could help it, they
don’t,” grinned Denton. “ There are only
two of them so far as he has learned. He
has them shadowed day and night. An
Italian and a Spaniard, he says they are.
He’s looking up their records.”
  Viola caught at the fact that Kolinsky
had been overlooked, the most dangerous
of the trio because of his Slavic origin which
was similar to that of the bulk of the people
he was working among; and because of his
recent visit to Russia and claimed comrade-
ship with the Bolshevik chieftain there.
  “ It isn’t fair that you can’t do anything
to stop them,” protested Bessie. “ They’ll
persuade more of the workers—”
  “ I don’t think so,” said Denton. “ The
little flurry of withdrawals that brought the
affair to our notice probably weeded out
both the more timorous and the more radi-
cal. As a general rule, these people are sat-
isfied,” he declared in his ignorance.
“ They’ve been well treated in this town—
in this country—and so far as the bank
is concerned their relations with it have in-
creased their confidence in it. That is dem-
onstrated by the many who have become
depositors since we got the first of them.”

  “ The mystery is all cleared up in that
case,” said Bessie. “ Now, as Mrs. Sallin
just said, all you have to do is keep an eye
on the—the Bolsheviks and checkmate
them.”
  “ Uh-huh.” Denton was, on the whole,
pleased with the way matters had turned
out. He had been cleared of the imputation
that he was an alarmist. His perspicacity
had given the bank a weapon with which
to combat further possible inroads, by re-
vealing the agitators and the point at which
counterpropaganda should be aimed. But
—he spoke the thought aloud.
  “ No,” he repeated, “ we don’t expect any
more to quit because of this agitation.”
  “ That does seem unlikely,” remarked
Viola sympathetically, “ considering that
they know your bank so well.” She maneu-
vered the conversation into other channels
and was departing when Denton recalled
that he had not asked how Sallin was pro-
gressing.
  “ Oh, so splendidly!” said Viola jubilant-
ly, and she laughed inwardly over her real
meaning. “ He does better and better every
clay! Why, just think of it, he’ll soon have
the bandages off his eyes! ”
  “ That’s great,” enthused Denton. I
hope your best expectations are realized.”
  Bessie echoed his expression. And. so did
Viola as, the good nights said, she laughed
softly and skipped over the lawn.
  Sallin was doing better every day—with
the help of Taylor and Odell and the city’s
water pressure! The news she brought him
to-night would be far from depressing!
Hadn’t the damage momentarily done by
Heusler been repaired? And this Jenkins
person wasn’t so much as a detective.
XI.
  Throughout the summer afternoons and
evenings Sallin maintained: his mummvlike
pose on the veranda. Constantly beside
him was Viola, the personification of loving
devotion, sitting close to him, her head fre-
quently cuddling his. The picture came to
be an accepted one among the neighbors
who could not but applaud the way in
which Viola clung to the man who, after all,
might be horribly disfigured!
  Such was the face the household pre-
sented on the outside to mask what was go-
ing on within.
  From the other side of the cellar, toward
the bank, another tunnel was being run.
Though more than twice as long as that
which had been cut to the water main, this
bigger work was being done with a mini-
mum of labor and with greater speed. It
went on more quickly because there was
no need of being cautious about pick ax
blows lest their thudding might be heard
above ground. For this drift that was to
reach the bank was being made by hydrau-
lic power with a stream at sixty pounds
pressure from the tapped main.
  The sandy soil was ideal. Under the one-
inch stream from the six-inch hose, it crum-
bled fast and was swept back into the cellar
to swirl down the drain in the flood.
  It was soggy working, but easy. Always
they were close up to the head of the drift,
lengthening the hose as they advanced and
getting the full force of the water. And the
only sound from their operations was the
steady swish-svrish as the powerful stream
carried them ever nearer to the million dol-
lars that was to repay their effort.
  Occasionally they had to stop to do some
shoveling, but on the whole they were called
upon for little exertion other than steadying
the bucking nozzle and shoring up the shaft.
For the latter need they kept on ripping out
lumber from the interior of the house. The
upper floor and the attic were completely
wrecked. More than the two thousand dol-
lars that had been paid on the house would
be required to repair it!
  On the fourth day they reached the foun-
dation wall at the rear of the bank. They
had gone forty-five feet.
   Their line was straight, their calculations
correct. They were within five feet of the
goal! But before they attained that there
was the greatest difficulty to be overcome—
a solid mass of concrete to be gone through,
and hardened steel.
  Here again Viola’s friendship with Bessie
and Denton proved invaluable. Availing
herself of the invitation to visit the bank
and be shown how well the money was
protected, she had learned something of
the construction of this particular vault.
200
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  The bank stood by itself, a square stone
building, high ceilinged, two stories high.
The vault was to the rear, projecting onto
the floor, with three sides and the top ex-
posed, its back to the wall. Steel incased in
concrete, it seemed impregnable. And Viola,
with many exclamatory “ Ohs!” as Denton
showed her the massive walls and the huge
door with its complicated mechanism, re-
marked on the tremendous strength of the
place. Also, as she stood inside it, her heel
rapped the armor plate floor and she spoke
of the impressive solidity of that, too.
  “ It is pretty solid,” Denton had smiled.
“ There is plate and concrete and more
plate—and then two feet more of concrete
underneath.”
  Viola had nodded brightly at that.
“ That’s so no one can break in from the
cellar,” she had remarked knowingly.
  And Bessie again had shown how much
she knew about the bank by smiling and
shaking her head.
  “ No fear of any one breaking in from
the cellar,” she said, “ because there is no
cellar. Not back here. Only in front.
  Whereat Viola voiced another vague
“ Oh!” She had been aware that the cellar
did not extend beneath the vault. What
she had sought to learn, and had found out,
was the thickness of the base of the vault.
Denton had told her. Had she asked him
at any other time about the construction of
the vault, she might have awakened sus-
picion. By coming to the bank to be awed
by the weightiness of the strong room she
had obtained this detail in a natural way
during his exposition.
  Odell and Taylor reached the foundation
wall in the afternoon. They rested there
and called Sallin.
  Sallin’s face was eager as he made his
way through the muddy tunnel. The con-
summation of his dream was near. The
patience with which he had waited for this
moment was close to being rewarded.
  “ We’ll wait till night before we go on,”
he said softly, his fingers lingering over the
bared masonry as though he would brush
it away. “ There are clerks up there—in
the niches on each side of the vault. They
are close to the wall. They might hear the
drill or notice the vibration. A wall is a
good conductor.”
  “ We can scrape away the mortar with
a chisel,” objected Odell. “ We’re getting
close to it now. No use losing time.”
  “ That’s the way I feel about it,” put in
Taylor. “ This damned burrowing like a
rabbit is getting on my nerves—and usually
I haven’t any. Let’s stick to it. We’ll hit
that concrete to-night.”
  “ All right.” Sallin was not averse to
haste provided it did not jeopardise the un-
dertaking. “ How long will it take you,
Duke, to bite through the concrete? It’s
two feet thick.”
  Taylor considered. “ I doubt whether it
can be done in a night,” he announced.
“ It’s a tough job. We’ll have to cut a hole
about eighteen inches in diameter—and
we’ll have to do it piecemeal, drilling at an
angle and breaking it out in scraps.”
  Sallin was figuring on a definite date.
  “ Can we count upon getting in Friday?
This is Tuesday. That allows until Thurs-
day, three nights, to get through the con-
crete. After that, Mint, you won’t want
much time to put the finishing touches?”
“I’ll say I won’t!” promised Odell.
“ Once we hit into the plate we’ll step into
that vault any time you like.”
  “ Right,” said Sallin. “ We’ll wind up
Friday if all goes well. Saturday, anyhow.
There’s no use waiting for Saturday—we
wouldn’t have the advantage of Sunday
for the get-away; not with the way the
cards lie.” He turned to crawl from the
tunnel. “ I’ll start things moving outside
to make it Friday.”
XII.
  While the underground members of the
gang were clearing a working space under
the bank vault, Sallin speeded up his plan
to put into it the million dollars which he
was to take out. Rather he gave release
to the plan already well in motion. That
was on Wednesday.
  “ Kolinsky will have to do most of the
talking,” he told Heusler, who was making
his call as “ Dr. Perthwaite.” “ De Real
and Fiorella, remember, are known and like-
ly are being tailed. They can circulate
some, but warn them to be careful.”
RED FOR A MILLION.
201
  Viola had managed to keep advised on
the success of the detective employed by the
bank. They had not yet made an excuse
on which to jail De Real or Fiorella, or to
run them out of town. Neither had they
identified Kolinsky as one of the agitators.
  Sam Heusler heaved his big bulk rest-
lessly.
  “ When do I quit coming here?” he
queried. “ I’m getting well known—I mean,
the folks round here ’11 be able to give a
good line on me. I’ll have a hell of a job
getting away.”
  Sallin eyed him coldly and his tone was
chill. “ You’ll quit coming Saturday night
when you carry us away.”
  “ You said I’d get a couple of days’
start—”
  With a motion Sallin halted the protest.
  “ We’ll all start even,” he said grimly.
“If you can’t take the chances with the rest
of us—” He turned away, the sentence
uncompleted.
  Heusler gathered his nerve to express
something that had been growing in his
mind.
  “ There ought to be a better cut,” he be-
gan.
  Sallin wheeled on him, his lips drawing
over his teeth.
  “ It’s late in the day to talk about that,”
he rasped. “ You’re down for ten per cent
and ”—he stopped close and his finger on
Heusler’s chest emphasized the words—
“ and you get ten per cent. See!”
 Heusler backed up. “ Well—” He
stopped, his glance wavering, his hands
twitching. “ Well—”
  The word was snatched from his mouth
by Sallin.
  “ It is well,” he said with a flickering,
menacing smile. “ It’s advisable, too, for
you to see it that way. Now, listen.” He
ended the argument by taking up his in-
structions. “ These birds will have to get
in their big work on Thursday night. Fri-
day morning they can go to the mills and
set off the fireworks some more. I want the
rush to start Friday morning.”
  Heusler did not feel very companionable
toward Sallin. Sallin acted too high-hand-
edly—let others take too much of the risk.
  “ And for the love of Heaven,” went on
Sallin fervently, “ don’t let them go off half
cocked this time.”
  “ I’ll tell them.” Heusler defended him-
self in advance. “ If they ball it up, it
won’t be my fault.”
   “ See they don’t ball it up, then it can be
nobody’s fault. And the night we get
through—Friday, as things now stand—
you’ll come here in the evening about nine
o’clock. Some time during the night Vi and
I will leave with you.”
  “ I could leave you the car and go ear-
lier—” Heusler had no ambition to be in a
party on the flight. There would be more
danger in numbers. Viola’s red hair would
be a flaming marker.
  “ As you like.” Sallin smiled and squint-
ed at him. “ How about your divvy? How
do we get that to you?”
  Heusler crumpled a cigar. “ Yeh—that’s
so. I guess—I’ll have to stick. Where you
going to make for?”
  Sallin held up his hands in negation.
“ We’ll drop you anywhere you say or take
you into New York. But when we finish
here, Sam, I don’t aim ever to see you again.
I’m going—” He waved the round of the
compass.
  “ You have it all straight?” Sallin be-
came brisk. “ Friday morning the big show
is to begin. That ’11 make it right for us
if everything pans out. Have you told De
Real and Fiorella that the cops are onto
them?”
  “ No. You said—”
  “ They don’t know it? Haven’t wised up
themselves?”
  “ They’d have spoken of it.”
  “ Then you can slip them a hint to watch
their steps. There’s another thousand apiece
if they make good. That will hold them.
Beat it now, Sam, and get them tuned up.”
  That night, after he had summoned Ko-
linsky through De Real and delivered the
final instructions, Heusler gave himself up
to disgruntled and surly thoughts.
  First among these was his distaste for the
public part he had been given to play. He
had a hunch that somebody was going to
bump into trouble. Sam was a good spy
and prospect hunter, but he was not so good
as a field man. He sincerely wished that
202

he had not been tempted into active partici-
pation. He could just as well have re-
mained on the outside and still collected a
substantial rake-off from Sallin. It wouldn’t
have amounted to ten per cent, but he might
have got half that.
  Second, he was sore because he was get-
ting no more than ten per cent. Sallin was
a hog on the big end—sixty per cent for him
and Viola. Sam couldn’t dope out why
Taylor and Odell should get fifteen per cent
apiece—-more than he was getting. Hadn’t
they been under cover throughout, while he
was in the open?
  Sam would have had more than that to
disturb him had he been within hearing
distance of De Real, Fiorella, and Kolinsky.
Fiorella had trailed him a few days previ-
ously to Sallin’s house. They could not
make sure that it was Sallin who occupied
it, but they could guess shrewdly. None
of them knew Sallin personally, but they
knew of his existence as a criminal director
of large caliber specializing in banks. The
proximity to the bank of the house at which
Heusler called therefore was significant.
They were biding their time—to declare
themselves in with Heusler if anything was
pulled off.
  “ We start a riot in this town Friday,”
was the way Kolinsky communicated the
orders received from Heusler.
  “ What is doing?” asked De Real.
  “ Don’t know, but ”—Kolinsky winked
and his mouth widened!—“ it’s something
good, sure thing. We have to keep tab on
Heusler.”
  “ It’s funny business,” opined Fiorella.
“ What we stirrin’ up these guys for?”
  “ I just said I don’t know,” responded
Kolinsky, “ but there’s a thousand more in
it for us. That’s regular. We get it by
mail Saturday if the riot comes off.”
  De Real smiled leanly. “ We shall have
to watch Heusler very closely when he
comes here. Is that all he told you?”
 Kolinsky pondered. “Uh-huh!” He
thought it better not to pass on the warning
that Heusler had given about detectives.
His companions might be perturbed enough
to drop out. He wanted help in handling
Heusler; and he did not desire to introduce
any new faces.
  Furthermore, Heusler would have started
a rapid fade-out right then had he but
known that Jenkins, the detective, was on
the verge of establishing the connection
between the agitators and their immediate
chief. He was checking up on the phone
call to De Real, made by Heusler when
he summoned Kolinsky. That led Jenkins
to a cigar store in New York City and ap-
parently into a blind alley. But Jenkins
was persistent. He had landed in blind
alleys ere this—and gone beyond them.
XIII.
  Friday morning the external waves of
Sallin’s contriving burst into full motion.
The “ riot ” began on schedule.
  Frank Denton saw the initial evidence of
it through the windows of the bank before
the opening hour at ten o’clock.
  More than a score of the foreign born
mill workers were standing there. And
they were visibly excited.
  Denton pointed them out to Trainor, the
president. His face became troubled.
  “ More accounts closing,” he said.
“ What’s the latest word from Jenkins, Mr.
Trainor?”
  “ He phoned a few minutes ago that these
agitators did a lot of circulating last night
and this morning,” replied Trainor. “ He
talked with some of the people they talked
to, and learned that word is being dis-
seminated that the bank is unsound. Sup-
pose we let those fellows in, Frank, and you
talk to them?”
  Several more depositors joined the cluster
at the door. They were jabbering in their
native tongues and gesticulating.
  Denton glanced at the clock. A quarter
to ten.
  “ There’s one there that I know well,” he
said. “ He was among the first to come to
us when I directed the missionary work for
the bank at the mills. I’ll call him in.”
  A chorus went up from the little crowd
as Denton approached the door. They
pressed forward when they saw that he was
going to open it. Some reaching through
the outer grilled door, pounded on the plate
glass with their fists. Their clamor grew as
Denton opened the inner door.
RED FOR A MILLION.
203
  Through the hubbub he called to the man
he wanted. The cries partly ceased and he
asked the man to enter. The others let
their fellow come to the front. But when
Denton slid back the grille to let him come
in, they also tried to force a way. Another
besides the favored one crushed by before
Denton could again bar the entrance.
  Denton gave them a friendly smile. They
answered with sullen looks.
  “ What do you want?”
  The man who had intruded replied with a
torrent of words mostly in his own language.
From the scattered English phrases in it,
Denton gathered that the bank was “ no
good.” The man brandished his bank book.
He wanted his money.
  Trainor, come forward to listen, stared
in amazement. His brows drew together
as he saw that the crowd outside was in-
creasing.
  Denton was questioning the man he
knew.
  “ What craziness is this, Joe?” he asked
with a carefree assumption that was in di-
rect contrast with his feelings. He also
noticed the growing numbers at the door.
“ What’s he talking about when he says the
bank is no good? You know how good it
is—”
  “ Me no know!” vociferated Joe excited-
ly. “ You been give our money to them
capitalists to beat us till it’s gone. You
been—” In his agitation he wandered off
into a flood of Polish.
  Denton looked at Trainor. The presi-
dent was very grave. His eyes traveled to
the clock. Five minutes to ten.
  “ We’ll have to make ready for that
crowd, Frank. There’s a hundred there
now.”
  Denton continued to smile on the twain
who apparently were speaking the belief
of the throng. “ Who says the bank is no
good?” He used the unfortunate expression
because they understood it best. Its repeti-
tion served only to impress it more strongly
on their minds.
  “Everybody! We know! Fellas tells
us!” Such was the meat of their voluble
and butchered answer.
  The futility of argument was plain. They
were in a panic They saw their savings be-
ing swept away—and that into the hands of
the capitalist, the slave driver!
  Denton stepped aside with the president.
From the street came a renewed murmuring.
  “ We can’t stall them,” he asserted the
obvious. “ All we can do is pay them and
while we’re doing so try to restore their con-
fidence. We’ll stack up all the currency we
have in plain sight. It will look like mil-
lions to them and may cool them off.”
  The president sputtered. “ My God,
Frank, it’s a run! That’s what it is. Good
Lord, a run on the Bank of Norford!” It
was sacrilegious! He glared angrily but
nervously at the chattering scores who
blocked the sidewalk. Scrutiny of the mot-
ley crew aroused his caution.
  “ We can’t let that mob in until we have
protection,” he decided. “ Hey, you,” he
called to a clerk with a lack of dignity that
under less distressing circumstances would
have been impossible, “ phone the police
to send a squad here at once. Tell them to
hurry. We can’t open until they arrive.
My God, Frank!” He ran a hand over his
brow, and it came away wet. This was the
most amazing event he had ever witnessed.
A run on his bank!
  “ The police—” Denton doubted the
advisability of having them. “ Their pres-
ence may only stir these folks up more,” he
counseled. “ I don’t believe they’ll start
anything—get out of hand—if we let them
see that there is plenty of cash.”
  “ We’ll have the police,” said Trainor
stubbornly. “ Look at them!”
  The crowd was milling more compactly
about the door. They knew that ten o’clock
had struck, the opening hour—and the bank
bad not opened.
  For ten long minutes they watched the
shuffling throng whose mutterings swelled
louder and more sustained. Once Denton
attempted to reason with them through the
grilled door, but they howled them down
and clawed through the bars at him.
  An automobile with six policemen was
pulling up when Jenkins telephoned.
  Trainor spoke with him.
  “ I’ve just had three of the agitators
thrown out of the mills,” reported the de-
tective. “ They were going round advising
the workers to get their money before it's
204
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
too late. They say your bank is busted
and that you are preferring the moneyed
people in making settlements.”
  Trainor swore between gasps. He heard
Jenkins continue:
  “ You can prepare for a rush. Bunches
of them are quitting work to go get their
money from you. Anything doing down
your way yet?”
  “Anything doing!” Trainor’s voice
creaked excitedly. “ They’re besieging the
place! That’s all! Why the devil don’t
you do something to protect us, Jenkins?
That’s what we pay you for. Get busy!
Do something! Lock these men up. Make
a charge against them. Get them—”
  “ It’s past time for doing that, Mr. Trai-
nor,” interrupted the detective. “ You
should have let me do it days ago.
But you wouldn’t stand for framing them.”
Trainor bobbed up and down with rage.
“ What in the name of God are we to
do?” he shouted. “ We’ve got a mob here
—and you say calmly that there’s more
coming. There's somebody back of this,
Jenkins. Find who it is.”
  “ I’m trying to do that,” said Jenkins
patiently. “ And meantime all you can do
is—pay.”
  “ I know that—and we can do it,”
snapped Trainor. “ But we can’t handle
them all. We haven’t that much money in
the place. We need time. We have to get
currency from New York.”
  “ Make time,” retorted Jenkins. “ Count
out their cash in one dollar bills—in quar-
ters and halves. Don’t pay at more than
one window. You can make time if you
need it. I’m going back on the job. I’ll
phone you later. How about protection?
Have you got the police?”
  “ They’re here,” said Trainor. “ We’re
waiting till they get the mob lined up before
we open.”
  “ I'm bringing half a dozen of my men
over from New York right away. They’re
huskies and will help keep order. I’ll be in
later. I’ll hold the three birds who made
the trouble.”
  Herded by the policemen, the depos-
itors were in a long cue on the sidewalk.
As Denton had predicted, the coming of the
police did not improve their temper. They
were quieter in the presence of the officers,
but their looks were blacker. In the call-
ing of the police they read confirmation of
the fear that their money was lost.
  At ten thirty the bank opened, but the
grilled gate was drawn only wide enough
to admit one person at a time. At each side
of it was a policeman. Inside were two oth-
ers. Patrolling the cue were four more.
  Frank Denton was in the only teller’s
cage that was to serve the stampeders.
Other depositors were to be handled at an-
other wicket.
  Beside Denton were great stacks of cur-
rency. Behind his cage clerks were piling
up more. It was a desperate but impressive
display of strength made in the hope that
those who departed with their demands met
would tell their fellows that there was lots
of money and so stay the panic.
  At ten thirty-one Denton smiled on the
first of the line to be admitted. He scanned
the withdrawal slip which called for four-
teen hundred and sixty dollars. He sent
the pass book back to have the balance
verified. .
  Two minutes later he started to count out
fourteen hundred and sixty dollars in one
dollar bills!
  The bank had to have time. If it should
pay out with customary speed, the cash in
the vaults, totaling less than two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars, must be ex-
hausted before noon. Time was necessary
to rush in funds from the reserve bank to
meet the emergency.
XIV.
  As the day wore on, the run increased in
volume. It was felt elsewhere in the town,
and so became a sensation. The Bank of
Norford called loans. Its borrowers could
make good with money obtained from other
banks. The stacks of currency back of
Frank Denton had to be replenished. But
no matter how slowly he paid out, they
diminished alarmingly.
  By early afternoon the panic among the
foreign element communicated to some of
the more stable citizens. The calling of
loans had much to do with that. They did
not understand that this measure was taken
RED FOR A MILLION.
205
as a means of stalling along pending the
arrival of currency from the reserve bank
in New York City. Securities and time
paper was being realized on there while the
Bank of Norford’s physical reserve was
being brought in.
  Crowds packed the street outside the
bank. The line of those who wanted to
close their accounts constantly lengthened.
By two o’clock the last of the fifteen hun-
dred mill workers joined it.
  Up to that hour Denton handled about a
hundred depositors. He went about his task
with a semblance of confident cheerfulness.
He was unflurried and methodical as ever,
and he made his painstaking slowness seem
like speed. Approximately he had paid out
two hundred thousand dollars.
  Under normal conditions he could have
disposed of four times as many people.
These were not normal conditions. He was
still paying in small bills, obtained from the
other banks in town, because the cash had
not yet come from New York.
  At the meeting of the board of directors
which sat throughout the day the proposal
was made to exert the bank’s prerogative of
thirty days’ notice on withdrawals. That
was voted down when the ill effect of refusal
to pay was accented.
  “ We can dally as we have been doing,”
said Denton, “ but we mustn’t stop paying.
The minute we do that there will be a
riot. If we keep on passing out currency,
that crowd won’t get rough. They may
growl, but they won’t begin to smash things.
Stop paying and they’ll go wild.”
  “ Denton is right,” said Trainor, whose
head had steadied after the first shock. He
was all business now, protecting his bank.
“ We have to keep on making motions.
The bigger depositors know well that we’re
solvent, and they are standing off. Some
of them have come forward with cash to
help us out. We’ll weather it without a
battle out there in the street as long as we
continue to pay.”
  The directors listened to that argument
and were convinced.
  i! You can speed up a little now, Frank,”
said Trainor. “ A million and a half is on
the way from New York. It may get here
before closing time; if not, soon after.”
  The other banks when appealed to came
to the ..assistance of the Norford with up-
ward of a hundred thousand in Liberty
bonds and other fast collateral. Denton’s
fingers riffled faster over the bills, but he
did not make real haste. The stacks of
currency surrounding him dwindled too fast
for safety. Already they were stuffed—cash
was being piled on top of ledgers and de-
posit boxes to make it look like something
substantial. He was playing more than ever
against time, for it appeared that the million
and a half could not reach Norford from
New York before the closing hour. Until
then appearances must be maintained. In
the morning all comers would get their
money as quickly as it could be counted.
Meantime—
  At three o’clock the bank closed. It had
twelve thousand and some odd dollars left!
Two score of policemen were on the scene
for the closing. There was the moment
fraught with danger.
  The precaution was well taken. When
they found that no more was to be paid
that day, the throng that had stood in line
for hours broke into a wailing that soon
rose into a vicious, angry shouting. They
scattered from the cue which the police
had kept intact and jammed the street in
front of the bank.
  The policemen bore the demonstration
with tolerance. They contented themselves
with keeping the walk clear. The crowd
weaved back and forth, but abstained from
violence. It lacked a leader, lacked the
provocation of a violent act.
  About three thirty the police opened a
way for the heavily guarded machine which
finally arrived with the currency. It was
that, however, which fired the mob.
  The machine, which by its very stanch-
ness reflected money, pulled up on the side-
walk to the bank door. A silence fell; then,
as the door wras opened and the auto’s
freight was unloaded, as strong boxes were
passed into the bank, those nearest began
to shout. There was money in these boxes.
They wanted money—their money. The
bank was no good! If that money got into
a no-good bank, it would be gone!
  So they yelled; and the thousand others
behind them, who were as vitally interested,
206
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY,
took up the cry. And the several thousands
back of them, women and children mostly,
reechoed it.
  They pushed forward. The police, aided
by Jenkins’s huskies, pushed them back.
They pressed on. They surged and fought.
A policeman, hard put to it, used his stick
on a head. A rock was thrown.
  Another policeman, being borne back by
weight of numbers, felt a knife rip his
shoulder. He struck down a man. One of
the plate glass windows of the bank was
smashed by a stone. The clamor became
the deep toned baying of a mob become fu-
rious and out of hand.
  “ Hustle that stuff,” the police captain
in charge called to the men unloading the
money. “ We can hold them about one
more minute. Then—”
  “ All out,” said Denton from the door-
way. He slammed the iron grille.
  The crowd roared. The money had
passed into the bank that was no good.
  “ Get your machine moving,” the cap-
tain ordered the chauffeur. “ I'm going to
use it to break up these hoots.”
  His men still held a clear space on the
walk, but they had to fight for it. Gun in
hand, he swung aboard the automobile.
  From the midst of the mob a revolver
shot rang out. Others followed.
  The captain called upon the crowd to dis-
perse. They howled in their several tongues
more furiously. He spoke to his men.
  “ No shooting unless you have to. But
—use your sticks if they buck you. Go to
’em!”
  The police went. The auto helped, back-
ing into the mob again and again.
  One policeman was shot. A dozen of the
besiegers were laid out with broken skulls.
The police were being overcome when an-
other force attacked the rear of the mob
and the half hour battle w^as ended.
  For an hour thereafter the chief of police
and substantial citizens, including the mill
managers and superintendents, harangued
the several crowds which collected. They
told of the money that had been brought
from New York. Hadn’t the mob with
their own eyes seen it unloaded? In the
morning it would be distributed. More was
coming. They talked earnestly, these men,
singling out among the crowds those they
could best thump some sense of the situa-
tion into. At length they drove home the
futility of further trouble. Many were per-
suaded to leave. Many remained to see
that the precious boxes were not removed.
But quiet had been restored.
  The police threw lines about the building.
The affair simmered down for the night.
Inside the bank the million and a half of
currency was checked and stowed in the
vault. The weary clerks went home under
police escort.
  Trainor and Denton remained in the
bank, as did the treasurer. There was al-
ways the chance that the mob might re-
gather and attempt to storm the building.
But for that possibility the vault might not
have been locked that night.
  Sallin had bet that it would be locked—
that just such a condition would prevail.
He won.
  Viola sat late with Bessie Wentworth that
evening. She had to learn how matters
stood in the bank.
  Bessie was worried about Denton. She
feared he might be attacked on the way
home.
  Viola spoke reassuringly. Across the lots
they could see that the bank remained
lighted.
  They may stay there all night,” said
Viola. “ What did he say when you talked
to him a while back?”
  “ That they might stay,” said Bessie.
“ Wh-what if that crowd breaks in! ”
  “ I’m sure there is no danger, dear,”
Viola soothed her. “ Phone him again, and
have him, if he can, run over to see you.
He’ll tell you that he is perfectly safe; that
the trouble is past.”
  She patted Bessie’s hand encouragingly.
  “ Ye-es,” conceded Bessie tremulously,
“ I suppose it is.” She took Viola’s sugges-
tion. “ I—I’ll phone him.”
   “ It is said that they got millions in this
afternoon,” added Viola. This was what
she wanted to know. “ In the morning
they will be able to pay every one. The
crowd knows that. Ask Frank if it isn’t so,
dear,” she was craftily insinuating. “ These
people saw the money go in. They realize
RED FOR A MILLION.
207
that they can’t get it before morning. Ask
Frank. He’ll tell you that’s so.”
  In her anxiety Bessie failed to observe
the trace of eagerness which Viola could not
altogether suppress. She asked Denton
about the shipment of currency.
  “ We’re all set, Bessie,” he said cheerful-
ly over the phone. “ It’s a case of waiting
for morning. . . . No, there won’t'be any
more trouble.”
  “ Why are you staying in the bank,
then, Frank?”
  “ I’m staying ”—he gave a woman’s rea-
son, which she, being a woman, could not
understand—' oh, because.”
  Thought came to her of the procedure the
bank had had to pursue that day. The
panic-stricken depositors would not stand
for that again.
  “ You’re sure you won’t have to pay so
slowly to-morrow?” she demanded suspi-
ciously. “If you do— How much money
have you?”
  “ We won’t,” replied Denton happily.
“ We’ll pay at all four windows as fast as
we can shovel it out. We’re all fixed now,
although, I’ll tell you, sweetheart, we were
down to twelve thousand when we closed.
We couldn’t have lasted ten more min-
utes.”
  “ How much have you now?” she in-
sisted.
  “ A million and a half,” he answered
truthfully; and Viola started as the girl
repeated the amount. “ That is locked in
the vault now,” continued Denton, “ and
as much more will be here in the morning.”
They talked longer of more intimate
things, and more material when she pressed
for assurance that he had had something to
eat.
    The police brought food in to us.” he
told her. - “ We’re O. K., except that we
haven’t anything more comfortable than
chairs to sleep on.”
  Whereupon Bessie lamented over his dis-
comfort, and promised to obey his injunc-
tion to forget it and go to sleep herself.
  From Bessie, thus, Viola learned the
amount of cash available; and that the
vault was locked, although three of the bank
officials remained on the premises.
  Gleefully she went home to Sallin.
  His lithe figure tensed and the pulses
throbbed at his temples.
  “ Into the hole, boys,” he said to Taylor
and Odell. “ I’ll be right after you. The
big clean-up is on.”
  He turned to Sam Heusler.
  “ Get out, Sam, and shoot the five hun-
dred bonus to De Real, Fiorella and Kolin-
sky. No—make it a thousand each; they’ve
earned it.” He gave Heusler six five hun-
dred dollar bills. Heusler was addressing
three envelopes in which to mail the money
when the doorbell rang. Viola answered it.
Her face was troubled when she returned.
“ It’s a man for you, Sam. De Real!”
An oath sizzled from Sallin. “ How did
he get here?” he snarled at Heusler.
  “ How the hell do I know?” Heusler
snarled back. His nerves were crackling.
“ I didn’t tell him.”
  Sallin stifled his fury. This was not the
moment for a clash. De Real could know
nothing.
  “ Go see him.” Sallin smiled poisonous-
ly on Heusler. He was glad Sam had
agreed to be on hand at the finish. He
would want to see Sam—very much—if the
robbery fell down at its consummation.
  In trepidation Heusler went downstairs
to meet his visitor. De Real also smiled
upon him—anticipatorily.
  “ We are arrested—my friends and my-
self,” he related. “ One thousand dollars
bail is required for each. We made up
enough to get me out. Two thousand dol-
lars is required to release my friends.”
Heusler breathed more freely.
  “ What is the charge?”
  “ Conspiracy, they say.” De Real
shrugged. “ We shall not come back to
hear the rest of it. You will give us the
money you promised—and the three thou-
sand dollars for our bonds. Yes?”
  “ How did you know to come here?”
scowled Heusler.
  De Real’s shoulders moved again. “ I
just—came.”
  Heusler did not parley. His cue was to
get rid of De Real.
  “ Wait a minute.” He went upstairs to
Sallin, who with few words gave him the
additional money.
208
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  “ Get him out,” he said. “ And advise
him to leave town.” v
While Heusler was seeing De Real on
his way, Sallin drew Viola to him.
  “ Do you want to leave now, Vi? Be-
fore we make the break? They may open
the vault while we’re in it. You can take
Heusler’s car—”
  “ I’ll stay,” she said quietly. “ We’ll go
together, Floyd.”
  His eyes kindled on her. “ A million,
Vi! That’s what we went after. And we
take a million and a half! For the rest of
our lives, Vi—”
  Silently they contemplated the alluring
future. The red-head rubbed back and
forth. It was the last caress Sallin would
have from that red-head. As he went to
direct his cracksmen, Viola went to soak
her gorgeously flaring crown in a bath of
indigo.
XV.
  While the three bank officials slumbered
restlessly, and the watchman kept his usual
vigil beside the eighteen-inch steel and con-
crete walls of the vault, the oxy-acetylene
torch burned a way through the floor of it
for Sallin, Odell, and Taylor.
  Once during their labor, Trainor, the
president, sat bolt upright from his sleep.
That was while the drill in Taylor’s hand
was nibbling out the layer of concrete im-
mediately beneath the floor of the vault.
  “ Do you hear anything?” Trainor spoke
sharply to the watchman.
 “ No, sir. What?” The watchman
looked out the front windows at the police-
men patrolling. They were the only per-
sons in sight.
  Trainor was peeved over his sleep having
been broken; it had been none too good at
best, curled up as he was in a chair.
  He listened. And he heard nothing be-
cause his senses were tricking him. He had
not heard the drilling. He had felt it. Un-
consciously he had registered the vibration
which in his full consciousness he could not
define.
  “ Nothing,” he said. “ I was dreaming,
I guess.” It was reasonable to believe that
he had been dreaming, after his stressful
day
  The watchman noted the time. He
punched his clock.
  Trainor squirmed into his chair.
  “ What time is it?”
  “ One o’clock, sir.”
  “Ugh!” said Trainor. He glowered at
Denton who was smiling in his sleep; and
at the treasurer who slouched wide-mouthed
and snoring.
  As the flame of the torch licked a hole
through the floor of the vault and began
to turn out a circle big enough to admit a
man, the president of the Bank of Norford
composed himself again to sleep.
  At two thirty Sallin, Odell, and Taylor
made their last trip through the tunnel they
had bored to strike into the bank from be-
low. They were muddy and perspiring,
their muscles were cramped from stooping,
but they had in their possession three-quar-
ters of a million dollars in hundred-dollar-
bills, a quarter of a million in fifties, an-
other quarter million in tens, and a third
quarter in fives and ones. Fifty feet away
policemen circled the bank from which it
had been taken. They saw the lights in
the house through the block, did these same
policemen, but lights in a private dwelling
meant nothing though the hour was late.
Sallin was avoiding any evidence of stealth
on the get-away.
  In the living room of the house that had
served so well as a base of operations, they
divided the cash—two hundred and twenty-
five thousand each for Odell and Taylor;
one hundred and fifty thousand for Heus-
ler; nine hundred thousand for Floyd Sal-
lin and Viola.
  His face alight, Sallin looked over his
accomplices. He had cashed in at last on
his dream!
  “ We’re through, boys,” he said softly.
“ From now on it’s every man for him-
self.”
  Taylor looked up from stuffing his stack
of hundreds and fifties into a hand bag.
  “ Mint and I are going to hang together,”
he announced. “ Eh, Mint?” They had
been working partners for many years.
They could take their chances together to
the end.
  “ That’s what,” said Odell. “ Chuck
                         3	A
RED FOR A MILLION.

that into your bag, Duke.” He tossed over
his fortune like so much dross.
  Sam Heusler alone in the company
showed fear. His face was pallid. He turned
over with shaking hands the paper package
into which he had wrapped his share.
  “ You—you’re going to take me with
you, chief?” he begged. “ You aren’t go-
ing to quit me here?”
  Sallin regarded him contemptuously. He
raised his eyebrows as he glanced at Viola.
She stood, keyed up but nerveful, arrayed
for the street in a plain tailored suit. She
seemed now to be of slighter build, her
clear complexion had become olive, the
“ birthmark ” was gone from the left cheek,
and her hair that had been so entrancingly
ruddy was a glistening black.
  “ You ride into New York with us,” said
Sallin to Heusler. “ Then you shift for
yourself. You boys ”—he smiled on the
two cracksmen — “ can climb aboard the
machine down street if you please. Or
you can jump the blind on a train that goes
through at three twenty. We don’t want
to leave here in a bunch with the cops look-
ing on. We can make it look like a party
breaking up. What say?”
  Taylor and Odell glanced at each other
and nodded.
  “ The rattler,” they agreed. They knew
the ways of the jungles, and in this instance
they preferred these to the highroad.
  Sallin picked up the two suit cases that
held his and Viola’s loot. He had changed
to clean clothes from those he had worn on
the wealth-laden trips through the tunnel.
So had Taylor and Odell. All was ready
for the get-away.
  “You two, Duke and Mint, go first,”
said Sallin. He was cold as ice, except for
the glow of victory in his eyes, the smile
that radiated in little waves from the cor-
ners of his mouth. “ You turn to the left
along the street. It’s a dark night. Step
along as though you belonged. Away from
here you’ll be all right. A lot of those bo-
hunks are loafing around, I guess, waiting
for first crack in the morning at the cash
they won’t get.”
  He led the way to the door. In the ves-
tibule he laid down the grips and gave a
hand to Taylor and Odell.
    4	A
 The door was opened. They stood in the
 faint light from the hall.
 “ Good night,” said Sallin in an ordinary
 tone.
 “ Good night.”
 “ Good night!”
 It was naturally done. There might be
 some one within hearing.
 “ Good luck, boys,” whispered Odell as
 they turned awav.
 “ ’Luck, chief.”
 They were gone, turning down the street
 to ihe left.
 “ They’re game, Vi. They ’11 make out.”
 It was a hint to Heusler to take a brace.
 “ We’ll all make out,” said Viola in sharp
 undertone, “ if we play half as well as they
 do.”
 Sam Heusler’s teeth clattered.
 “ Let’s go,” he whispered huskily. “ Let’s
 get—”
 “ After you, Sam,” said Sallin. “ We’ll
 pick you up two blocks west.” That was
 in the opposite direction from Main Street.
 “ You go to the right from here, then two
 blocks west.”
 Heusler clutched at him.
 “ You’re quitting me,” he whimpered.
 Sallin’s fingers bit into his arms.
 “ We’re not quitting you. Two blocks
 over is where we’ll meet you.”
 Heusler was afraid—but he knew that
 Sallin’s word was good. Sallin never had
 thrown a pal.
 “ You’re wasting time, Sam,” said Sallin.
 “ Get going. We want no jam getting out
 of here. Ready, Vi? Going, Sam?”
 “ Ready,” answered Viola. She took up
 one of the grips. Sallin took the other.
 “ So help your God, you won’t quit me?”
 wheezed Sam.
 “ So help me!” Sallin opened the door.
 “ You’re yellow, Sam,” he added dispas-
 sionately.
 Precipitately Sam went into the darkness.
 He did not hear Sallin’s “ Good luck!” If
 he did, he gave no response.
 They allowed him three minutes.
 With magnificent effrontery Sallin and
 Viola wished “Good night!” to nobody.
 They shut the door, leaving the lights in
 the house burning, and walked without
 haste to the car.
210
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  Starting it, there was still no attempt at
concealment. Sallin raced the engine,
throttled it down, and moved away at not
over eight miles an hour. He threw on the
headlights, making the turn into the street
on which they were to meet Sam. A block
down he dimmed them and slowed.
  At the designated corner they stopped.
  “ Hell’s damnation!”
  Sallin’s curse was the first speech since
leaving the house.
  Heusler was not there.
  Viola gripped Sallin’s arm. “ The fool,”
she breathed. “ He came this way—the
yellow pup! We can’t wait, Floyd. He’s
had time—”
  “ We’ll give him his chance,” said Sallin.
“ Wait.” He got out of the machine and
stooped as though examining a shoe.
  Sixty dragging seconds they waited. Sal-
lin returned to his seat. The car was mov-
ing when Viola gripped his arm.
  “There!” She pointed. “Is that—
No. There are two men there—three
men.”
  The machine gathered speed.
XVI.
  Discovery of the body of Sam Heusler
opened the second day of sensations in the
town of Norford. A milkman crossing a
vacant lot stumbled upon it just round the
corner from where Sallin had lived. There
was the mark of a weighty blow on the
face—and a knife wound between the ribs.
The knife had penetrated the heart.
  The body was found soon after six
o’clock. Instantly it vied in interest with
the crowd already assembling to withdraw
their funds from the Bank of Norford.
  On account of the latter situation the
town generally was early astir. In this
neighborhood were few who had been
drawn into the run on the bank. Many
there were depositors, however, and they
were up betimes to watch developments
from the side lines with a more peculiar
concern than the ordinary spectator.
  Among these early risers was Bessie
Wentworth. Her waking action was to
telephone Frank Denton. He reported a
wearisome night with “ all well.”
  “ There’s a crowd out front already,” he
informed Bessie, “ but they seem to have
lost their pep. If they had as rotten a
night as I had, I don’t wonder.”
  “ Poor dear boy,” murmured Bessie.
“ I’m going to send you something nice for
breakfast. What do you want, Frank?”
  “ Well, now—” Denton considered. “ I
know!” he asserted suddenly. “You get
’em for me, Bess, and I’ll love you twice as
much.”
  “ Then you admit that you don’t love me
all you might?” she challenged.
  “ Of course I do. But this—”
  “ Never mind your excuses,” she pouted.
“ You can’t explain. Tell me what you
want.”
  “ I’ll explain this afternoon when I get
you-—” He interrupted himself as Trainor
awoke and turned heavy eyes on him. He
reverted to his breakfast hankering. “ I
want creamed shrimp on toast and a pair of
coddled eggs, Bessie, sweetheart. Do I get
them?”
  “The easiest thing!” It would be fun
making breakfast for Frank. Like the days
that were to come. “ I’ll go right out and
get the shrimp in the first store that opens.
It ’11 be canned, of course, Frank, but—”
  Denton laughed deprecatingly. “ Of
course you will not go out. I didn’t think
of that. Make it four coddled and forget
the—”
  “ I won’t forget it,” stated Bessie indig-
nantly. “ You’ll get what you want. And
a melon and cream and coffee and hot rolls
and cruellers and—and—and a shark steak
if you say so.”
  “ That ’11 be great,” he accepted buoyant-
ly. “ Bring what you said and forget the
shr—”
  “ I won’t forget it,” she repealed, “ and
you won’t see or hear from me until I bring
it over. So there!”
  And Bessie hung up to dress hurriedly for
the street. Her Frank could not be denied
what he most desired for breakfast after
having had to sleep in that horrid bank all
night.
  Consequently Bessie was outdoors before
seven o’clock.
  In her quest for shrimp she went along
the street in the direction Sam Heusler had
RED FOR A MILLION.

taken from the Sallin house. At the first
intersection she noticed a crowd a few lots
distant. Policemen were there. With ex-
cusable curiosity she stepped aside.
  As she came up another policeman made
his way through the knot of people. She
caught a glimpse of the man lying dead on
the grass.
  Bessie screamed. Through horrified sobs
she identified Heusler as “ Dr. Perthwaite,”
who attended Mr. Sallin.
  “ That helps,” said Detective Blakeley,
of the police department. “ Where does
this guy Sallin live?”
  Bessie led them to the house. There
there was an immediate evidence of some-
thing out of gear. Though it was daylight,
the house was still illuminatd.
  When no one answered the repeated rings,
the police broke in. The absence of occu-
pants, coupled with the ruin made by the
tearing out of the floors, inspired more com-
plete investigation. The twin tunnels were
found, and the ruck of hose and other para-
phernalia in the cellar.
  In this way, through the murder of Sam
Heusler, the robbery of the Bank of Nor-
ford was discovered backward.
  When a policeman entered the bank and
notified Trainor, the president, another po-
liceman was standing in the vault when
Trainor opened it.
  That was at seven forty-five o’clock.
  The vault was clear of cash excepting the
twelve hundred odd dollars that had been
on hand at the previous close of business.
Nothing else had been tampered with; no
effort made to break open the strong boxes
which contained securities. The money had
been easy to take because it had literally
just been dumped inside to be handy when
the bank reopened to meet the run.
  Jenkins arrived while Trainor, Denton,
the treasurer, and the police were gawping
at the looted vault. The hole in the floor and
the tunnel told the whole story, but they
were having difficulty grasping it, so enor-
mous was the job.
  The little detective whistled. Like a flash
he saw through the scheme. Largely that
was because he had been wearily perplexed
by the campaign against the bank.
  “A genius—a genius in robbery,” he
spoke his thoughts aloud. “ Pulling off a
run to get a bunch of cash here.”
  His tone was not without admiration. It
riled Trainor.
  “ If we had a genius in the shape of a de-
tective,” he exploded, “ we might get a start
on capturing the genius robber.”
  Jenkins received that with customary
mildness. “ Mebbe you don’t need a genius.
Where does the hole lead to?”
  “To where there is nobody now, of
course! Where did you think?” Trainor
lost his dignity again. This was the finish.
Two hours hence the mob would be back
clamoring for the money that was gone.
Already it was gathering. And there was
twelve hundred dollars to face it with!
  Trainor suddenly aged ten years. He
slumped into a chair.
  “ To where there’s nobody,” he iterated
less venomously, “ and, I suppose, no trace
of who was there except a dead man.”
  “ A dead man!” Jenkins jumped at that.
He had been doing something himself, de-
spite Trainor’s unkind remarks. The three
agitators he had locked up had given him a
little to work on. “ How was he killed—
where?”
   “ In a lot round the corner,” said a police-
man. “ Must have been a quarrel on the
get-away. He has been known as a doctor
tending a man in the house the tunnel
comes from.”
  The twinkling eyes of Jenkins twinkled
more brightly as he assembled the known
facts. He put Trainor aside and gave his
ear to Denton when the latter told what he
knew of the Sallin household.
  Blakely, the local sleuth, also pricked up
at that. He went after Denton, cross-ex-
amining.
  “ You’re quitting the bank, ain’t you, to
go to another?” he fired belligerently at last.
“ You knew the whole gang. You visited
them—they visited you. What d’you
know?” His gaze transfixed the flabber-
gasted Denton. “ We’ll want you, young
feller! You and your girl! Where’s she?
Say— don’t you stir out of here. W7e’ll
want you!”
  With a burst of energy he plumped into
the tunnel and went blundering through it
to tear apart what Sallin and his crew had
212
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
left of the house. Blakely was looking for
a clew.
  The accusation left Denton gasping.
Jenkins drew him aside.
  “ Don’t you bother about him,’' he said.
“ He doesn’t know there are four angles to
this case. And on one of them 1 bet I
know who killed this doctor guy. Who, I’ll
bet again was named Sam Heusler and trav-
eled in funny company.”
  “ Eh! What?” Trainor thrust himself
forward. “ What’s this you’re saying, Jen-
kins? For God's sake ’’—he lapsed into
pathos—“ if you can see anything like day-
light, go after it, man, go after it. We ”—
his voice broke—“ this old bank is out of
business.”
  Jenkins refused to be hurried.
  “ We’ll get nowhere by flying off Mr.
Trainor," he said gently. “ Will you let
me be? And if that sleuth who thinks he
wants to pinch Denton asks where Denton
has gone, say he's over at his girl's house.
Were going there. Tell him.” Jenkins
chortled, “ he can get them both at one time
over there. Come on Denton. I want your
girl to tell me more about the red head!”
XVII.
  By nine o'clock, while almost the entire
police force was forming a cordon for a
block around the bank and excluding all
who were not on official business, Jenkins
had an alarm sent out for De Real, Fiorella,
and Kolinsky. His men had failed to find
them at their lodgings, or any trace of
them in town. He swore heartily because
the police had not photographed and bertil-
loned them; because they had been granted
bail. But he had a fair description of them
to put on the wires. Also he offered a thou-
sand dollars’ reward for the capture of any
of them dead or alive. He charged them
with murder.
  The local police followed his lead. They
threw their net for the three agitators, plus
one red-headed woman. These four with
Heusler, they concluded, made up the rob-
ber band.
  Jenkins let them think so. He encour-
aged them to think so by informing them
that he had established direct relationship
between the agitators and Heusler by fol-
lowing up the phone call from the cigar store
in New York to De Real a few days previ-
ously. In addition he told them that De
Real had visited the Sallin house the night
before just prior to bailing his companions.
The bitterness in Jenkins’s cup was that his
operative who had shadowed De Real had
lost the trio immediately afterward.
  But it was on the red head that Jenkins
concentrated. The wrash basin in the Sal-
lin house he found was stained a rich, deep
blue. That apparently was fresh. Among
the fund of information catalogued in his
head, he recalled that the women of north-
ern Africa, Arabia, Persia and the East In-
dies use indigo in conjunction with henna
on their hair. The indigo applied on top of
henna, makes a glossy black.
  Jenkins advised the police to look for a
black-haired woman.
  Conversation with Bessie had raised
doubt in his mind about the genuineness of
the red head. Yet Bessie would not say
that it had been manufactured.
  “ I looked to see whether there was any
darkening at the roots of her hair,” Bessie
confessed, “ but I never saw any. It was
such wonderful hair. If it hadn’t been natu-
ral, I don’t believe it could have remained
so consistently brilliant.”
  “ She could have treated it every night,”
said Jenkins. “ Now about Sallin. Did
you ever hear her say where the explosion
took place that mussed him? There was no
explosion, of course—there is no record of
any Dr. Perthwaite, and he, anyhow has
been identified as Heusler—but we might as
well prove there was none.”
  “ It occurred in New York City” said
Bessie.
  “ We’ll find out.” Jenkins dispatched a
telegram.
  “ Tell me everything you can remember
about them,” he went on. “ Was there any
little characteristic that she showed—or
Sallin? Your description of her isn’t worth
much. It might fit a hundred women out
of a thousand. With her hair a different
color and dressed differently, her complex-
ion changed and all that, it probably
wouldn’t begin to fit her. Did she have any
noticeable gesture or trick of expression?”
RED FOR A MILLION.

  Viola loomed as a rather indistinct figure.
Her hair was what had impressed every one
who had seen her, to the eclipse of her
other features.
  “ I can’t think of anything,” said Bessie
slowly, “ only that she was terribly devoted
to him—or appeared to be.”
  “ Devoted? How so?” Wifely devotion
wasn’t a great deal to go on, but Jenkins
was overlooking nothing.
  “ Oh — just.” Bessie’s mind wandered.
She was thinking of Denton, back there in
the bank, to reach which the angry de-
positors already were fighting the police.
  “ Just what?” Jenkins sharpened his
tone to bring her back to the question.
  “ Oh, she was always — always loving
him,” replied Bessie none too definitely.
“ Petting him and—and leaning her cheek
against his bandaged face. That—that’s
all I meant.”
 “Umph!” Jenkins couldn’t see any
progress here. “ You never heard Sallin’s
voice?” he asked again.
  Bessie had not; nothing more than a
murmur of it through the bandaging.
Neither had any one else.
  “ See if you can think of anything that
would help identify the woman,” he urged
as he left Bessie. “ I’m going to follow up
the machine they got away in, if I can, but
if you remember anything tell it to the op-
erative I’m leaving here. I’ll be in touch
with him.”
  Passing out of town in a fast automo-
bile, Jenkins looked grimly on the crowds
storming the police lines surrounding the
bank. From their point of view the rob-
bery was a fake, and they refused to be-
lieve that more currency was on the way
from New York.
  “ He is one bird, the guy who worked
this,” quoth Jenkins. “ And since nobody
round here ever saw his face, it looks like
he’ll get away with it. Heusler got jabbed
when he was lighting out with his divvy—
that’s a safe bet. The three Bolsheviks
weren’t in on the big deal, but they horned.
The red-head is the bunk—doesn’t mean
anything. A red-head and a bandaged-
iaced man. There’s a hell of a combina-
tion! The only other definite item we have
about her is that she’s a loving wife! Yah! ”
  Abruptly he leaned forward in his seat
in the speeding car. He stared with widen-
ing eyes.
  “ By—by—by—” He searched for an
adequate expression. He leaned back.
  “ Let her pop till she busts, Bill,” he
said softly to the chauffeur, referring to the
car.
  “Well,” said Jenkins. “Well, we-ell!”
XVIII.
  The most direct way from Norford
brought Jenkins into New York over Broad-
way. From Yonkers he telephoned his
office to inquire whether any one, police-
man or motorist, had been found who re-
membered seeing the Sallin machine come
in. The car’s number was not available,
but a good description of it had been given.
  “ They’re fishing it out of the Harlem
River,” his office recounted. “ At least, it
seems to be the same car. We’ve got a man
up there.”
  “In the river!” Jenkins tingled. He
would have liked to run the case out, but
if it was to wind up this way it was well
enough. “ What’d they do? Run through
an open draw?”
  “ No. It isn’t at the bridge. It’s in a
slip where there’s a dead-end street up at
Two Hundred and Seventh.”
  Jenkins’s hopes fell.
  “ Any bodies?”
  “ Haven’t heard yet. We just got the
tip fifteen minutes ago. Somebody saw the
car as the tide went down.”
  “ I’m going there.”
  When he reached the place a derrick-
scow was running tackle about the partly
submerged machine. The car was upside
down.
  A police launch was casting grappling
irons. It was believed there were bodies,
because a watchman at a power station on
the river edge recollected having heard a
splash. He had looked out, but, hearing
nothing further, no cries for help, decided
that it had signified nothing.
  But though they dragged the slip, they
brought up no bodies.
  Talking over the phone with Norford,
Jenkins received more encouraging news
214
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY
than he had to present. The run on the
bank had been checked by the arrival of
more currency about noon. The morning
had been filled with clashes between the
panicky depositors and the police, but the
results were no worse than a few minor in-
juries. Quiet again prevailed, with the
bank paying off as fast as its tellers could
count.
  About three o’clock in the afternoon it
developed that a motor boat was missing
from a boathouse on the slip into which the
automobile had hurdled. The boat had
been moored outside the house, and seem-
ingly had slipped its painter. About the
same hour the harbor police reported the
boat picked up adrift in the upper bay,
below Bedloe’s Island.
  Because of the fact that if the idea he
had was to be made good, Sallin must be
captured quickly, Jenkins took up the in-
cident of the motor boat. He noted where
it had been found—and that the tide was
coming in. Had it gone down the Harlem
River on the ebbing tide, which makes an
appreciable current into the East River, it
would not have got into the bay. It could
not have drifted that fast. Failure to dis-
cover any victims of the motor car in the
river was a suggestive factor. There was
no doubt about the car being that which
Heusler had used as “ Dr. Perthwaite,” and
in which Sallin and Viola had escaped.
  The machine in the river at the point
from which a boat had disappeared the
same night offered at least a coincidence
worth investigating. The watchman who
had heard the car plunge into the water had
not noticed the departure of any motor
boat. It could have been poled out into the
river stream and so got away noiselessly.
  Jenkins sent a wireless broadcast over
the sea asking all ships that sailed that day
whether they had picked up any one from
a boat. He set inquiries going along the
water front, among the tugs and barges and
pilot boats and ships that had come into
port.
  And with several operatives he went over
to Staten Island. The point at which the
boat had been found drifting, judging by
the set of the tide, indicated that it might
have been cast loose from the island.
  “ We’ll comb Staten Island with fine
teeth,” he instructed his men. “ I doubt
whether the woman is there. She probably
crossed back to Manhattan on the ferry.
But the man—there’s a chance.”
  During the night Jenkins and his men
rested. It was useless to search in the dark
for a man whose face they would not recog-
nize; about whom they knew positively
nothing other than that he was of slight
build and assumably clean shaven.
  With daylight some of them went abroad
on the island. Jenkins and an assistant set
out in a fast launch down the inner shore
from Port Richmond. Another launch took
the outer shore.
  “ Stop everywhere,” was Jenkins’s final
order. “ Look at everybody—every man
who in any way slightly resembles in build
the guy we’re after. There is ten thousand
in it for the man who gets him. I don’t
believe he’s camping in Manhattan or
Brooklyn. The heart of the big city is a
good place to hide, but not always. This
bird probably has an alibi cooked up re-
gardless of his expectation that he can stay
clear. He can prove an alibi better out
here on Staten Island where he can be in
an isolated spot, than he could in the city,
when as in this case it has to cover weeks.
Get me? Let’s go.”
  Late Sunday afternoon Jenkins’s launch
chugged alongside a houseboat moored close
inshore at a dreary spot three miles below
Port Richmond.
  There were five men on the houseboat,
lounging about in the nondescript garb of
men having a good time. Two were in
bathing suits, sitting with their feet dan-
gling in the water.
  Jenkins stopped alongside these two.
From the upper deck the three others
looked down disinterestedly.
  No word was spoken as Jenkins stood
up, fending off his launch. His eyes jumped
from the three, who in form bore no resem-
blance to the fugitive. He gazed with benev-
olent smile but keenly at the two bathers.
  Both were lithely built and about the
height and weight he understood Sallin to
be. One was young, in his twenties, and
had fair hair. The other, about thirty-five
had hair shot with gray.
RED FOR A MILLION.
215
 The silence became strange. The young-
 er man drew up his feet.
 “ Hello!” he said.
 “Hello!” replied Jenkins, but he was
 looking at the other man.
 “ Sight-seeing?” said one of those aloft
 frivolously.
 Jenkins did not look up. He glanced at
 his assistant, who was sitting negligently
 jiggling a finger between the spokes of the
 steering wheel.
 “ That’s the guy!” said Jenkins sudden-
 ly, and he covered the graying haired man
 with a gun.
 His aid pointed a gun at those on the
 upper deck.
The man whom Jenkins menaced
laughed.
 “ If this is a hold-up,” he said, “ you’ll
 get damned little. A couple of bottles of
 rum—the end of our perfect vacation—are
 the most valuable things aboard.”
 “Piracy!” The word came satirically
 from above. “ Where’s your black flag, old
 man?”
 All five laughed.
 Jenkins gazed on his man benignly. He
 was unruffled by the hilarious reception ac-
 corded his gunplay.
 “ I’m an officer,” he explained. “ I want
 you.”
“ Sure.” The wanted one was more
amused. “ What have I been doing?” He
flipped his toes in the water.
 “ Not much/’ said Jenkins. “ Will you
 all come over to New York? Or do you
 have to be taken?”
 “ Aw, go to hell,” grinned another of the
 party good-naturedly. “ You don’t want
 our hooch. You’ve had enough?”
 Jenkins ignored that. “ Coming?”
 The man with the grayed hair bent to-
 ward him. He frowned.
 “ Do you mean this foolishness?” he
 asked earnestly.
 “ I do,” nodded Jenkins.
“ But—”
 “ We’ll listen to the ‘ buts ’ later on.”
 Jenkins’s voice crisped. For a small man
 he looked uncommonly businesslike.
 “ Heusler is dead,” he added.
 The information failed to get a rise. The
 man he shot it at stared blankly.
  “ Do you mean that you accuse me of
murdering this—what did you sav his name
is?”
  “ No.” Jenkins shook his head.
  “ Then what—”
  “ If you can’t figure it out,” said Jenkins
drolly, “ the charge is bank robbery!”
  There was renewed laughter.
  “ Where? When? they chorused.
  Jenkins sighed. “ Town of Norford—
yesterday,” he explained patiently.
  “ I’ve been here a month,” protested the
accused while his companions roared.
“ I’ve been on this boat—here—a month.
You’re crazy.”
  “ We’ll let you prove that,” retorted Jen-
kins. “ The sooner we get going, the quick-
er you can prove it.”
  They went with him finally, laughing
and kidding him. Their attitude was that
of humoring a nut. They told him so
frankly. And the least troubled of the
party was Floyd Sallin. He had four wit-
nesses to make good his alibi.
XIX.
  Jenkins returned to Norford with his
prisoner at midnight Sunday. At New
York police headquarters he had had Sallin
finger printed and measured. The records
were being searched there for a previous
arrest.
  Sallin’s four witnesses went with him.
They had identified themselves satisfactori-
ly to the New York police. Jenkins had to
admit that there was nothing on them.
They were reputable enough witnesses,
whose word would go in court unless it
could be indubitably discredited. They
insisted that Sallin had been with them
during the three weeks on the houseboat.
  Sallin gave an address which was verified.
He had lived there for two years, the land-
lord affirmed; and Sallin had maintained
the small apartment that time. He had
closed it to go on vacation a month back.
Neighbors confirmed that. His occupation
—he had none; he had some money and
helped out his income by gambling a little.
  Upon reaching Norford, Jenkins learned
of others in the case. Taylor and Odell
were prisoners. They had been arrested by
216
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
railroad detectives while riding the blind.
The bag containing their share of the loot
they had cast away, but the action had
been observed by the officers and it had
been recovered.
  Blakely, the Norford sleuth who was be-
ing restrained from arresting Frank Denton
and Bessie Wentworth only on the pleading
of Trainor and others of the bank officials,
was highly elated. He claimed the credit
for the capture of Taylor and Odell—hadn’t
he got out a fast alarm—and he scoffed at
Jenkins when Sallin’s alibi appeared to be
so well founded.
  “ Where’s the black-haired woman?” he
jeered. “ You’ll get her on a submarine,
eh?”
  He couldn’t see where Jenkins had any-
thing to back up his contention that Sallin
was among the robbers. Jenkins smiled at
him and said nothing. He was awaiting the
coming of two men he had requested to fol-
low him from New York. They had not
accompanied him because they were not at
home when he passed through the city.
  Sallin listened stolidly to the recital of
Heusler’s death. He was taken to the
morgue and looked on the body without a
sign of recognition. He looked stonily at
Taylor and Odell when they were brought
before him without warning.
  Bessie Wentworth and Frank Denton
identified Taylor and Odell as having been
in the Sallin household. They looked
blankly at Sallin and he looked as blankly
at them.
  On Jenkins’s suggestion the muddy suits
of clothes found in the house were tried on
Sallin, Taylor, and Odell. They fitted.
But that was inconsequential. The tailors’
labels had been removed. A man could not
be convicted because a suit fitted him.
  All this Sallin submitted to without ob-
jection. Toward daybreak he yawned.
  “ Isn’t that enough for one night?” He
smiled wanly. He looked from Jenkins to
the chief of police and the district attorney.
“ All my cards are on the table, gentlemen.
I was never in this town before. I did not
rob the bank. I have been with four friends
on the houseboat off Staten Island for the
last month. You say the man you want
was here during the last three weeks. I
can’t be that man. I can say no more than
that — offer no more proof than I have
given. I’ve been decent with you because
you are trying to solve a big crime, but
now ” — he tapped the chief’s desk — “I
want you to reciprocate. I want a lawyer,
and I want to be taken into court and dis-
charged.”
  The chief and the district attorney con-
ferred with Jenkins. He telephoned New
York.
  “ The men I'm waiting for are on the
way,” he told the chief and the prosecutor.
“ They are chemists.”	,
  The chief was worried. Sallin might
make trouble. They were holding him
without evidence.
  “What d’you want chemists for?” he
questioned tartly.
  “ Haven’t you any idea?"
  “ None.” The chief disliked being kept
in the dark. “ What is it?”
  “ Talk to Bessie Wentworth.” said Jen-
kins dryly. “ Ask her about the woman.”
  The chief snorted. He had a profession-
al dislike for private detectives which was
not fully overcome by Jenkins’s unassum-
ing traits.
  “ And oh,” Jenkins imparted a piece of
information he had just received from his
office. “ We’ve got De Real. He has a
wad of fifty thousand dollars—and a knife
with fresh blood on it. We got him pulling
out on a train for Philadelphia. And—”
Jenkins swapped grins with the now beam-
ing chief—“ did you happen to notice that
big clumsy ring on Heusler’s finger? Yes?
We-ell—there’s a ragged cut over De Real’s
eye that might have been made by that
ring. They’re bringing him out here. Sal-
lin may know him.”
  Jenkins was wrong there, for Sallin did
not know De Real. But that turned out to
be immaterial. The chemists arrived be-
fore De Real. Jenkins conferred with them
in private. They were smiling broadly as
they came into the chief’s office and turned
their eyes on Sallin.
  He confronted these newcomers boldly,
with the calmness that had marked him all
along. Yet he was obviously puzzled by
the introduction of the aged, white-haired
man, and the other, stoop-shouldered and

wearing horned glasses. To Sallin they ap-
peared as a new breed in police business.
  They stood behind him. They looked
at each other and chuckled. Jenkins had
put an original proposition up to them. It
worked out!
  Together they nodded to Jenkins.
  From his pocket, while his cheery eyes
sparkled, he took a pair of hair-clippers!
  “ If you’ll have somebody hold him,
chief,” he invited, “ we’ll cut his hair on
the left side and mark it as an exhibit!”
  “ His hair!” The chief rose out of his
chair in surprise. He thought Jenkins had
gone mad.
  So did the others. All except Sallin,
whose face wore a dawning wonder. His
hands gripped together slowly as though
he would prevent their slightest expression
of his feelings but had not the power.
  “ His hair—on the left side,” repeated
Jenkins. “ And these gentlemen ” — he
waved at the chemists—“ will find in it
traces of henna! Can’t you see that it’s
reddish—when the woman we’ve yet to get
constantly leaned her head when he was
playing injured? I told you chief,” said
Jenkins with a note almost of apology, “ to
ask Bessie Wentworth about the woman!”
  While they crowded round with many
amazed ejaculations to gape at his hair,
Sallin relaxed. His eyes narrowed, and he
smiled with tight lips. He nodded to Jen-
kins.
  “ You’re a wonder, little man,” he said
without too much bravado, but with rare
nerve; “ but—you make me laugh.”
  “ Mebbe so,” said Jenkins. “ Mebbe—”
THE
   The phone rang. The chief took it up.
 New York police headquarters was calling.
 His head wagged as to a rhythm while he
 listened, and his brief replies were alive with
 joy. He set down the phone with a semi-
 flourish.
   “ They’ve made you, Sallin, in the gal-
 lery in New York. Your picture and your
 fingers from the time you were in on sus-
 picion for the bank job in Michigan.
 ’Member? And—”
   Sallin’s face became drawn and he
 straightened for the blow.
   “ And they have Viola’s picture from the
 same time. We’ve got you by the hair,”
 he laughed at his own joke; “ and when
 we get her we’ll identify her with witnesses
 and you with her. Where’s the cash, Sal-
 lin?”
   “ Checked at the ferryhouse at St.
 George,” said Jenkins softly. “ I was sav-
 ing that until his red hair was tagged. That
 was a mistake, Sallin,” added the little de-
 tective with something like regret. “ A job
 like you pulled spoiled by a red-head!
 There wasn’t a thing to take you on if that
 dope didn’t work. And if we hadn’t got
 you to headquarters we wouldn’t know who
 the ex-red-head is, would we? She’s black
 as a raven, now, isn’t she, Sallin? That
 indigo in the wash-basin—”
   Floyd Sallin laughed.
   “ Little man,” he said. “ you have too
 many brains for your size.”
   He had achieved his dream—a million
 dollars in one haul—had excelled it by half
 a million. And he had lost in the winning
 through the red-head that he had made.

WHAT HAS OCCURRED IN PART I
 JENNY DEVON, manikin^ in Mme. Lacour’s dressmaking establishment in London, is besought
 by Baroness Luini, lady in waiting to the Archduchess Stephanie of Rosemark, to impersonate
 the duchess, whom she greatly resembles, for a few days. The archduchess, headstrong and
 reckless, has eloped with Count Saxt, although she is about to be betrothed to Prince Nicholas of
 Galmatia. He must not know of her disappearance, as it is hoped to overtake the archduchess
 and persuade her to return.
      Jenny agrees reluctantly and goes to Argar Castle with the baroness. There she is presented
 to the exiled Empress Melita, grandmother of Stephanie, who is one of those in the secret, and
 meets Prince Nicholas. The prince finds her charming and makes love to her. Jenny loses her
 heart to him. Her visit to Argar Castle is cut short by the return of the real archduchess.
CHAPTER VIII.
           AT THE MEET.
Nicholas almer Frederick
 CHARLES HONORS, Hereditary
 Prince of Galmatia, Prince of Gan-
 dolo, Overlord of the Transmontine
 Marshes, and Duke of the Lerinnean Is-
 lands—to give him only a few of his names
 —awoke on that Saturday morning in the
 state bedchamber at Argar Castle very much
 pleased with himself and the world in gen-
 eral.
 As he stood and shaved his handsome
 chin and upper lip before an imperial look-
 ing glass, brought from the capital of Rose-
 mark by special permission of the republic
              Thit itory began in the Argosy-Allttory Weekly for November 24.
218
 long established in that country, he looked
 forward to an engrossing day.
   He was, as we have seen, most pleasur-
 ably surprised by the personality of the
 bride he had found in this ancient Kentish
 Castle.
  The young man was something of an
enigma. Whether he was really as frivolous
and casual as he seemed to be even his
mother would have found it hard to tell.
His serious moments were too rare to chron-
icle. Suffice it to say that he had a charm
of manner that won all hearts, that he had
been personally indulged from childhood,
but at the same time trained to perform his
public duties to the very best of his ability.
   This marriage had been a case in point.
ANOTHER WOMAN’S LIFE.
219
He must marry, he had been told. In vain
he pointed out that other princes belonging
to far more important countries had delayed
their marriages until they were many years
older than he. Things were different, he
was told. He was the only son. There were
elements in the country and its administra-
tion that made his early marriage impera-
tive. The next heir was highly unpopular
with the people. And so on. His cousin,
Hortense of Mangora, luckily for him, had
died. He was little more than a boy when
that alliance had been proposed. Then
came the choice of the Princess Caroline of
Hisperia—she of the cod fish eyes. He had
put his foot down. In vain his mother had
argued with him in her jolly, sporting way.
It simply wasn’t to be done.
  Then, after an interval of three years,
during which his country was at war, and he
and his father were at the front and every
moment meant danger to the succession, the
Archduchess Stephanie of Rosemark was
brought to his notice. Negotiations had
been undertaken. The ex-empress was
agreeable. England , gave her unqualified
approval. The archduchess was not of a
reigning family, but the bluest blood in the
world ran in her veins, including that of the
Plantagenets, of the Bourbons, and of Mary
Stuart.
  Nicholas had learned things during the
war. He was more amenable. The arch-
duchess’s photograph was shown to him.
He sighed, shrugged his shoulders, and
gave in.
  And, really, there was no hardship about
it. That was the delightful surprise. Short
of choosing one’s own wife, nothing could
be better. There was the little sting. She
had been chosen for him. His mind played
queer tricks as he deliberately set himself
to picture what would have happened if he
had not been himself and she had not been
herself, and they had met—just like any
other ordinary pair.
  To-day was going to crown the pleasant
week. He was an ardent horseman himself,
and the thought of that sweet and surpris-
ingly lovely girl in the saddle was a rarely
stimulating one.
  The archduchess did not appear at break-
fast.
  He found that a dozen or more of the
household were in hunting kit. He did not
wear the English pink himself, but the bot-
tle green and buff facings of his own home
hunt.
  Stephanie was already mounted when he
first saw her; surrounded by members of
the household and by certain neighbors in-
vited to start from the castle to the Picker-
ing Cross, where the meet was to be held.
  She sat her sixteen hand bay mare with
the white blaze like a feather, riding side
saddle, wearing a plain dark habit and a
hard felt hat. A glance at her hands satis-
fied him. A more workmanlike figure he
had never seen.
  But—by St. Melchior, why was she more
made up than ever? And for the hunting
field! And was it the hard hat that made
her lovely face look harder?
  He rode to her side, saluting her.
  “ Good morning, Stephanie.”
  “ Good morning.” Stephanie replied.
“ We’re in for a grand day.”
  Just then a move was made, Stephanie
leading, and he falling in beside her. What
was it about a horse that made a woman
look “ horsey ”? He could have sworn that
she was a little changed. Her voice even
had sounded harsher. And she didn’t seem
to want to be alone with him. She kept
in the middle of a bunch of people all the
way to the place of the meet.
  There was a crowd of country people at
the first covert side. There was some de-
lay, and then the covert was drawn; the
hounds w’ent away, everything was forgot-
ten in the business of the day.
  Nicholas and Stephanie were in the first
flight of a gloriously long run. His admira-
tion grew. No fence was too big for her;
she wanted no one to give her a lead; she
fled the much swollen Pickering Brook as if
a puff of wind wafted her over it. She was
unheated, unruffled, when, after a grand kill,
they halted to eat sandwiches and give their
horses a breathing space before going on to
the next covert.
  Dismounted, she made a perfect picture,
and Nicholas felt his heart give a great
bound, as he walked up to her.
  “Stephanie, you're truly a marvel!
Who’d think you could ride like that?”
220
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  “ Why not?” she asked.
  “ Of course, I’ve always heard about
you,” he said quickly. “ But what I’ve seen
of you hardly made me expect it.”
  “ Why?” There was an unmistakably
mocking note in her voice.
  He gave her a swift look. What was the
change in her? She was just the same to
look at, except that her beautiful hair was
hidden by the hard hat. Only a few burnt-
golden tendrils escaped in the nape of her
neck. The rouge and lip salve, added to
the sharp wind, made her face less tenderly
soft. Her brown eyes seemed to have lost
some of their fascinating questions.
  “ I don’t know,” he said. “ You seemed
different before—” He looked around him.
The field was discreetly dispersed; their
suites were at a respectful distance. He
and Stephanie were practically alone.
  Out of some inner unexplained perplexity
came his next words.
  “ Stephanie, this morning you don’t seem
a bit the girl who kissed me last night.”
  “ Don’t I?” She laughed, softly enough,
but again with a hint of mockery. “ My
dear Nicholas, are we ever the same in the
morning as we were—last night?”
  He had spoken with rare sincerity. Her
tone stung him. He offered her a sandwich,
and said, with an infinitely cool smile:
  “ I’ve heard people say that the hunting
field spoils the most charming woman. I
think they must be right.”
CHAPTER IX.
THE OTHER STEPHANIE.
AS the day wore on. Prince Nicholas was
destined to receive several disagree-
able little shocks in connection with
his future bride.
  They had another kill after a short run,
and then a long point of more than seven
miles over the springy turf of the high
downs, and through the gorse, where hounds
were checked, and scent gave out. Another
neighboring covert was drawn without re-
sult. And then there was the long trot
home after an essentially satisfactory day.
As to the weather, it was a day to raise the
spirits sky high and make the heart sing.
  After the second kill Nicholas had an-
other short conversation with Stephanie,
who this time remained mounted. The way
she sat her horse entranced him. It was the
very essence of grace, of youth, of fearless-
ness. She was indeed a dazzling horse-
woman. But there was still that change in
her demeanor, that something less simple,
less tender, less girlish, more provocative.
He was moved to answer her little mocking
sallies. On the occasion when he said that
he believed the hunting field spoiled many
women he was all but rude. He was an-
gry with himself for that, but could not
help it.
  What a double-faced girl she must be!
Last night all surrender, all sweetness; this
morning offhand and cool, with a hint of
gay mockery in those velvet brown eyes.
Also it might almost be said that she
spurned his company and deliberately kept
in the midst of her suite.
  But toward the end of the day, as they
jogged down the lane that led into the main
road and the entrance gates of Argar Castle,
Nicholas managed to attach himself to her
side, and the other riders fell discreetly
away.
  “ We must make an opportunity for a
little chat again this evening,” he said.
“ It’s my last evening, Stephanie. I have
to leave before dinner to-morrow.”
  “ Isn’t there a dance or something on?”
she asked carelessly. “ I saw an army of
workmen unloading millions of roses and
carnations this morning.”
  “ Oh, yes, of course! Well, we shall get
a chance of being alone. Do you love
dancing, Stephanie? But, of course, you
do!”
  “ Of course I do. But it’s frightfully
stiff and formal here, you know, Nicholas.
If you and I want to dance a waltz, it will
have to be the old-fashioned Viennese kind.
Mostly, it’s all quadrilles and things of that
kind. They bore me to death.”
  He could not stop wondering about the
change in her. Where was the girl he had
held in his arms, the girl whose eyes had
been wet with the deep wild emotions that
had stirred him, too? Where was the girl
who had tremblingly asked him if it was
only a piece of luck to him they had been
ANOTHER WOMAN’S LIFE.

brought together by reasons of state? Had
he offended her? No, he knew he had not
done that. At least he had given her no
reasonable cause of offense.
  “ Stephanie,” he asked again, “ why are
you so different to-day? Have I done any-
thing to hurt you? I can’t understand how
you can change so. You’re hardly nice
to me—hardly polite. And last night you
cried in my arms.”
  She gave a little impatient laugh.
  “ Good gracious, Nicholas, we all make
fools of ourselves sometimes! Don’t rub
last night in so heavily. We shall get on all
right.”
  So she was just a cold-hearted, capricious
flirt! There was no other explanation. His
hostility was roused. No young man likes
being made a fool of, but Nicholas of Gal-
matia less than most.
  He laughed, too.
  “ Oh, I’ve no doubt we shall get on all
right! I hope you’ll be good enough to give
me one of those decorous Viennese waltzes,
Stephanie. As I’ve told you before, we’re
not nearly so stiff or meticulously formal
in my country. You’ll have a much livelier
time.”
  “Thank goodness for that!” she ex-
claimed, and touched her horse with her
crop cfnd bounded through the wide open
castle gates and up the great avenue.
Nicholas, piqued and ruffled, did not follow.
  If this was to be her attitude—well, two
could play at any game.
  Her pale eyes screwed up with anxiety
and her thin lips quivering with suspense,
the Baroness Dora Luini awaited her young
mistress in the orange and gold sitting room
of the archduchess’s apartments.
  “ Your imperial highness — does the
prince guess?” she asked, hardly able to
frame the words for anxiousness.
  “ I don’t believe he does,” Stephanie re-
plied with a rather wicked little smile.
“ But, my dear old Luini, he must! It can
only be a matter of time. Unless he’s half
witted. This was no test. It’s when we’re
alone. Your little substitute seems to
have made the running with him. He talks
of kisses and tears and doesn’t understand
why I don’t gaze at him in adoration.
That’s obvious. I must say, he’s wickedly
good looking, too.”
  “ But—your imperial highness! I told
you how simple and quiet she was! ”
  “ I know. I didn’t let you down, Luini,
dear. Really, I was quite nice to him. But
I couldn’t fall into his arms. I must avoid
a tete-a-tete. After all, he goes to-morrow.
And when we meet again, he’ll have forgot-
ten the impression she made on him. I’m
not coming down to tea. Excuse me to the
all highest, will you, Luini? I’m dog tired.”
But before the baroness left the room,
Stephanie flung a question at her.
  “ I say, is she really so awfully like me?
It’s rather quaint. I don't believe the
prince has the slightest suspicion.”
  The baroness gave the royal lady the
same intent scrutiny she had often given
Jenny Devon during her brief stay at the
castle.
  “ It would really be almost impossible to
tell you apart, your imperial highness. I
am amazed myself. It’s only a little some-
thing in the expression and in the voice.”
  “ I’ve talked like a peal of muffled bells
all day,” said Stephanie with a laugh.
Then her voice took on a carelessly good
natured tone. “ I say, Luini, I am a nui-
sance to you, aren’t I?”
  “ Nothing matters now that your imperial
highness has come back,” retorted the loyal
lady with a deep sigh.
  Prince Nicholas found at dinner that the
archduchess was keeping up her new pose.
Whereas before she had been modest and
quiet and self-effacing in company with her
family and relatives and the exalted guests,
to-night she was simply wooden and unin-
terested. He noticed it particularly in the
ex-empress’s little sitting room, where they
spent half an hour after dinner. The arch-
duchess sat stiff and bored. There was
something almost sullen about her. Her
deep curtsy seemed purely formal and im-
plied no real respect. She moved like an
automaton during the stately dances at the
beginning of the ball.
  But she looked—she looked like a rose
herself among the thousands of exquisite
blooms that lined the ballroom. She wore
cloudy rose color, and the splendid string of
222
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
pearls, and a strange arrangement of rose,
gold-dusted feathers that made her little
proud head look as though it had wings.
  And she danced—she danced like a god-
dess. She danced like she rode—as if air
were her element and not earth.
  Nicholas found that out when he waltzed
with her. It was a disconcerting job in that
eitquette ridden ballroom. A glittering
company stood around. Never, surely, were
there so many gorgeous jewels displayed
on so many women who wore them to the
manner born. A ridiculously small space at
the upper end of the room was available.
And one danced with officers of the house-
hold guarding the four corners as if one were
a pair of professionals at a night club, the
cynosure of all eyes. But even then, with
such a partner, the poise of her body, the
sway of her hips, the gossamer lightness of
her footing—it was the most rapturously
enjoyable exercise in the world.
  Later, there was general dancing. The
older members of the imperial family had
withdrawn. Nicholas found Stephanie in
conversation with one of his gentlemen.
And, having had a word with the band-
master and finding a waltz in progress for
the general company, he got hold of her,
and masterfully, without a word, bore her
off, and through one of the rose arched door-
ways, perilously, intoxicatingly dancing
down a flight of steps into one of the great
corridors.
  It was a breathless performance; and at
the end of it, with light fingers, he touched
her cheek.
  “ Still all this powder and paint, little
girl?” he said. He was a trifle carried away
by her nearness, by her overwhelming beau-
ty. “ After what I said!”
  “Good Lord!” Stephanie cried. “Mr.
Puritan, what on earth is the matter? You
should see what a sight I look without it.”
  This instead of the confused modesty of
a night ago. Then she had murmured that
everybody did it. And she had said that
he had not offended her.
  She roused something fierce and auto-
cratic in him. He suddenly felt that he
wanted to crush this impudent new spirit.
After all, she was the same girl!
  They were right at the end of the corri-
dor. Nobody was near. The distant music
was like some half remembered love song.
Her beauty fired him. He took her in his
arms, perhaps a little roughly.
  “ Stephanie, little girl, you can’t keep
this up! You’re playing with me. You’re
trying to, you little idiot! But you can't!
You can’t!”
  He covered her face with kisses. The
subtle perfume of her powder—the baroness
had not forgotten that touch!—stole over
him. His head was high and proud. He
would make her be the little girl of last
night. She couldn’t help herself.
  She could help herself, it seemed. She
pushed him away. Her little hands were
hard. She was breathing fast, furiously.
  A little sound of rage was in her throat.
She ran from him fleet as a deer. She
fled him just in the same way as she had
fled the Pickering Brook on her glorious
bay mare, as if a puff of wind were bearing
her away.
  He saw her no more that night. He
stayed with the general company for a little
while, dancing enthusiastically. When he
left the ballroom, many a bright, slightly
wistful feminine glance followed him.
  The next day, being Sunday, there were
two elaborate services in the chapel'.
  There were guests to luncheon afterward,
and Prince Nicholas had no opportunity
of seeing Stephanie alone. During the meal
she complained of a headache. Soon after-
ward she disappeared. And at tea time the
Baroness Dora Luini brought a message to
the prince to the effect that her imperial
highness was feeling so indisposed that she
was obliged to retire and greatly regretted
being unable to take leave of his royal high-
ness in person.
  At six o’clock Nicholas left for the
coast by motor car.
  When the castle had settled down again,
the Baroness Dora Luini went to the arch-
duchess’s apartments and asked to be re-
ceived.
  Stephanie lounged on the settee in her
sitting room, clad in a wonderful wrapper of
flame satin and sable, reading a letter. She
flashed her wicked little smile at her lady
in waiting.
ANOTHER WOMAN’S LIFE.
223
  “This is delicious!” she exclaimed.
“ Your little substitute has caught the
young gentleman’s fancy, and no mistake,
my good Luini. He doesn’t like me.
Read!”
  She tossed the letter over. It fell on the
floor, and the baroness picked it up.
  “ You kind and unkind girl,” she read in
a small, rather cramped, but very pretty
handwriting—“ good-by. Please wear my
ring. And be your sweet self, and not your
prickly one, when I come back. Devoted-
ly, Nicholas.”
  “ How did your imperial highness be-
have to him?” asked the baroness anxious-
ly. “ Are you perfectly sure he suspects
nothing?”
  “ Not as far as I know, Luini,” Stephanie
replied. She frowned slightly. “ It was
rather difficult for me. I wasn’t prepared.
I shall know the next time. That girl didn’t
lose any time, did she?” She laughed with
lightly contemptuous amusement.
  “ Your imperial highness knows—the be-
trothal is to be announced at once,” said
the lady in waiting as she returned the
prince’s note.
  “ Is it? Well, here’s the ring.” She held
out an ivory case, lined with crushed white
velvet.
  “ Oh!” gasped the baroness, her breath
taken away by the magnificent gem—a
pigeon’s blood ruby of oval shape and un-
usual size, set in a rim of seven other
rubies of equal splendor and fire. “ Isn’t
it wonderful? What a ring! Your impe-
rial highness must wear it at once.”
  “ I suppose I must,” said Stephanie,
slipping it onto her finger. “ Luini, when
is the prince coming back?”
  “ Not for another month, so I understand
from her majesty.”
  “ Thank goodness for that!”
  “ Then the contracts and settlements will
be ready to be signed. There will be the
court ball in London and a banquet in your
highness’s and the prince’s honor. And a
luncheon in the city, when the prince will
receive the freedom. And other public ar-
rangements. The prince is expected to stay
a fortnight, I believe. And then he will not
come back again until the wedding.”
  The archduchess said nothing in reply.
She held up her hand with the ring on it,
and examined its rose colored fire with
an unreadable light in her lovely eyes.
CHAPTER X.
HEARTACHE.
WITH the instinct of a wounded ani-
mal Jenny Devon had slipped back
into her old fourth floor back room
in Bloomsbury. She saw no reason why she
should seek new lodging.
  Her landlady, like Mine. Lacour, thought
she had taken a job in Rome. She had
actually had time to get to the Italian
capital, spend a few days there, and re-
turn.
  She announced that she had not liked
the work or the people. Her landlady wel-
comed her back, a nice, quiet lodger who
gave no trouble. She gave her baked beans
for supper on the first night, because she
knew she liked them. And Jenny ate them
with relish and wondered if the gold plate
and the thousand candlelights and the won-
derfully seasoned dishes and the delicate
wines and the hothouse fruit of Argar Castle
had been nothing but a dream.
  She was a sensible girl, and she knew
that she must take up her life again. She
must think of those days as if they were
a dream. She must not think of the prince
at all. He had now met his real bride.
Either he would be deceived and think her
the same girl, or, if he wasn’t, the thing
would be explained, and he would under-
stand and forget all about it.
  Jenny realized that royalties might have
two lives, very widely differing one from
the other. Anyhow, as the real archduchess
denied that she had gone away with an-
other man, but simply out of caprice, it
would probably not be long before she fell
in love with Prince Nicholas. And he was
already on the road to being in love with
her.
  Jenny fought with her tears that first
night. She felt so insignificant, so unwant-
ed, a lone Peri cast out of Paradise. She
awoke in the middle of the night and cried
softly to herself for an hour.
On the Sunday she went to see Bertie,
224
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
bearing her usual gifts. She had a few
pounds—enough to live on for about a cou-
ple of weeks. She must begin to look for
work at once.
  Bertie grumbled because she had not
come last Sunday. She told him she had
been away. He said everybody else had
had visitors. He had been ill. She looked
at his drawn, fretful face with loving com-
passion.
  But she could do nothing. It seemed
impossible to help Bertie. To-day she had
brought chocolates, and he was pining for
acid drops. She had brought his favorite
comic papers, and his eyes hurt him so
that he could not even look at the pictures.
It was a dreary day, gray, with every now
and then a drizzle of rain. Jenny’s spirit
was steeped in gloom. The omnibus put
her down in the heart of the West End.
She had nothing to do. The thought of
her back room was most uninviting. She
could not look up anybody she knew. She
had not collected herself sufficiently to be
able to answer questions.
  She saw a cue in front of a cinema. Me-
chanically she fell in with it. A famous star
was appearing in a film of circus life. It
would distract her mind. She felt utterly
disheartened. Her thoughts went round and
round in a circle, and always they came
back to this: that she would never see
Prince Nicholas again.
  A short film was just ending as she took
her seat in the crowded auditorium. The
lights went up for a moment, then down
again as the screen announced that the
topical news pictures would be shown.
There was a rally of Boy Scouts: the arrival
of an African chief at Liverpool; and then
some words appeared that made Jenny’s
heart beat with fearful excitement.
MEET OF THE ARGAR VALE ROYAL
FOLLOWERS
  And then, to the tune of “ John Peel,”
the meet that had been her last rendezvous
with Prince Nicholas was shown, and a
young man and a young woman on horse-
back amid a crowd of others.
“ His Royal Highness Prince Nicholas of
Galmatia ” was flashed on the screen, “ and
Her Imperial Highness the Archduchess
Stephanie of Rosemark, whose engagement,
it is understood, will shortly be announced.”
There was another picture of the two, iso-
lated at a covert side. The orchestra played
a sentimental air. The prince, a handsome
and gallant figure, was seen to dismount
and approach the archduchess, looking up
at her, all smiles, and offering her a sand-
wich.
  A woman next to Jenny exclaimed: “ No
doubt about their being in love, do you
think?”
  And her companion, another woman, an-
swered fervently: “ I should think not.
And no wonder! Aren’t they a handsome
pair?”
  And then yet another picture, as they
hacked backed to the castle, quite alone,
their horses very close together. And from
the audience a burst of sympathetic ap-
plause.
  Jenny gulped down something in her
throat that threatened to choke her. He
was already falling in love with Stephanie.
She could hardly bear it. How that girl
sat her horse! To Jenny she looked a
scornful, insolent figure.
  The prince’s words to her, spoken only
two nights ago, rang in her ears: “ Stepha-
nie, just think, it won’t be long before I
shall take you to my own country—as my
wife!”
  And now he was saying this same thing
to another girl.
  She crouched in her seat. Of the circus
film she saw nothing at all. She could not
keep back her tears; and the kindly dark-
ness hid them.
  Monday morning she received a small
registered parcel. On opening it, two jewel
cases were displayed. One held a beautiful
string of pearls, not large or magnificent,
but such as a girl might wear and have
them supposed to be imitation by the world.
They had been chosen with thought. The
other gift was more difficult to place. It
was a flexible bracelet of the very finest
workmanship, made of diamonds inter-
spersed with brilliant brownish yellow to-
pazes. The stones were large, the diamonds
obviously of the very first water. It was
a dazzling ornament and quite unsuited to
                        4 A

a girl in Jenny’s position. She knew it must
be exceedingly valuable.
  There was a plain card in the package,
and on it some one had written: “ With
much gratitude.”
  She would not take money, so they had
sent her jewels. They were proud, and
would not accept her services for nothing.
They must pay her for those hours that,
now she looked back on them, filled her
with a sense of incalculable loss. Not the
gold plate, the roses, and the white and
silver bed, but that presence with the
laughing eyes and the tender voice, that
brilliant personality that had just stretched
out a careless hand and robbed her of her
heart. They thought they could pay her
for those days!
  Her first impulse was to return the jew-
els; but, thinking it over, she decided to
keep them. She would wear the pearls,
and lock the diamond bracelet away.
They had been given in kindness, she was
sure. Every one at Argar Castle had been
most kind to her. She bore them no
grudge. It was only that they could not
understand.
  She went out and bought a newspaper
and began to look through the advertise-
ment columns for work. She would not go
back to Mme. Lacour’s, for all sorts of rea-
sons. She must try other establishments.
It seemed that very few manikins were
wanted. She tried Bluespray’s and the very
exclusive establishment known as “ La
Maison Rouge.” She had no luck. Neither
had any vacancy, although the managers of
both houses looked at her with more than
common interest. As soon as a vacancy oc-
curred they would communicate with Miss
Devon, if she were still at liberty. Would
she leave her address? Seeing a sign up
in a small shop in Bond Street, she present-
ed herself there. The proprietress, a smart
society lady, offered her three pounds a
week, and it appeared that she would have
to do practically the whole work of the
showroom as well as perform her manikin’s
duties.
  She was disheartened as she went out,
having refused the place. She was more dis-
heartened still after an afternoon and an-
other morning spent in seeking work. Sev-
  5 A
eral big shops offered her a post at a ridicu-
lously low wage. She did not want to give
Mme. Lacour as reference. She dreaded
inquiries into her supposed journey to
Rome. She was strictly loyal to the people
to whom she had rendered her fantastic ser-
vice.
  But she had to live. There were Ber-
tie’s expenses. He needed clothes, the
matron had said. A wage of three pounds
would mean that she would have to leave
her present lodging. She had learned none
of the technical branches of dressmaking.
In her spare time at Mme. Lacour’s she had
helped the girls sometimes to make bead
embroideries and such things; but she had
no real skill or gift for such work. She
could do nothing but what she had been
doing.
  Panic began to seize her. Bertie’s ex-
penses had to be paid week by week. She
could sell the diamond bracelet; but she was
terrified lest she should have to explain how
it came into her possession.
  Five days passed in her search for work.
She would not be able to live much longer.
She had had to send some things to the
home for Bertie. She went back to the
Bond Street shop to take the post at three
pounds a week, but, of course, it was filled.
She understood by now that none of the
first class establishments were taking on
fresh manikins until they began to see how
the season was going to turn out. There
was nothing for it but to take on a job in
one of the big shops—an irreparable loss of
caste.
  On the day of this decision she happened
upon Mr. Phare in Bond Street. He greet-
ed her in his quiet voice, while his eager,
steely blue eyes showed concern as well as
admiration.
  “ You are not looking well, Miss Devon.
I hope there is nothing wrong.”
  “ I am quite well, thank you, Mr. Phare,”
Jenny replied in a stiff little voice.
  “ I was afraid something had happened
to you—after you left Lacour’s.”
  “ How do you know I’ve left Lacour’s?”
she asked in astonishment.
  “ I heard it from Lady Grace. I was
inquiring after you. You must know that
I take a great interest in you. Miss Devon.”
226
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  “ You are very kind, Mr. Phare. But
there is nothing the matter with me, I as-
sure you!”
  She was not so much on the defensive as
usual. And when he asked her to lunch
with him, she found herself accepting. She
was very tired and hungry; she had very
little money in her purse. And she was
thoroughly depressed. There was some-
thing soothing in the man’s obvious sym-
pathy, tendered as it was with simple friend-
liness. She did not stop to think what had
happened the time before.
  At the very beginning of the meal an
untoward incident happened. A waiter
knocked Jenny’s hand bag off the table.
It was an old one, and the insecure fas-
tening gave way, emptying its contents on
the carpet.
  Marcus Phare stooped to pick it up. As
it happened, Jenny had brought the dia-
mond and topaz bracelet with her, not in
its case, but wrapped in tissue paper. She
had been trying to make up her mind to sell
it, or perhaps pawn it. This was Saturday,
and on the next day she had to take Bertie’s
money to the home.
  The paper became unwrapped, and Mar-
cus Phare lifted the glittering thing from
the floor with the other humble contents of
Jenny’s bag, her powder puff, some keys,
and her almost empty purse. He looked
at her very hard as he said carelessly:
  “ How very pretty!” He examined the
bracelet. “ And what perfect stones! Old
Brazilian. I’ve never seen finer. And I
know something about diamonds.”
  Jenny felt herself growing red to the
roots of her hair. His tone might have
meant nothing at all. But she read into it
a meaning that outraged her feelings.
  She took the jewels from his hand with-
out a word and thrust it back into the
bag
  “ It does not belong to me,” she said
coldly, not caring a pin about the lie. In
fact, in that moment she felt that it did
not belong to her—that it never could.
  “ 1 was wondering,” said Phare, “ who
was the lucky person privileged to give you
such a pretty thing. I think you know I
covet the honor.”
  She faced him with angry eyes; and his
kindled into flame as they rested on her
lovely face.
  “ Something has happened to you,” he
murmured. And then he changed his tone
and played the agreeable host.
  Jenny ate so that she need not talk.
Marcus Phare was most entertaining. He
knew everybody, and he had that slightly
detached, slightly cynical manner of the
rich bachelor courted by society.
  “ I would like you to see my house,” he
said toward the end of the meal. “ Won’t
you let me take you there now? It’s only
round the corner—in Charles Street. I have
some nice pictures.”
  “ Thank you very much,” she answered,
“ but I can’t. I have an appointment.”
  “ Then, another day. Won’t you come
to tea—to-morrow?”
  “ I’m afraid I can’t.”
  “ You’re rather unkind, aren’t you?
Why did you come to lunch with me? You
can’t hate me altogether. You must know
my feelings. I am very much interested in
you. You and I might be great friends. I
should love to show you the world—the real
world. I would love to show you Monte
Carlo and Rome, and the desert. Why
don’t you let me? For a girl with your
face to show off other women's dresses is
monstrous. It’s a crime. Wouldn’t you
like to have lots of things like that pretty
bangle that you say doesn’t belong to you?
I suppose it’s a client’s and you’re going
to pawn it for her. I hear that you girls
are asked to do all sorts of funny things.”
“ Please, Mr. Phare, I would rather you
didn’t talk like this,” Jenny said. She put
down her half smoked cigarette and quickly
gulped down her coffee. “ I must be going
now.” She began to pull on her gloves.
  “ Don’t be absurd,” he said. “ There's
heaps of time. I don’t want to frighten
you, little girl. But I can’t bear to see you
throwing your life away like this—your
wonderful youth. Why don’t you trust me?
I know what life ought to be like to a girl
like you. I might—even marry you.”
She went white to the lips and sprang
to her feet. She saw only the odious impli-
cation in his generous proposal. No doubt
the man thought it a magnificent promise
to hold out to a girl of her class.
ANOTHER WOMAN’S LIFE.
227
  “ I’m going,” she said under her breath.
“ Please don’t follow me. I never want to
see you again as long as I live.”
CHAPTER XI.
ONCE MORE.
THE next day Jenny took all the money
she had but a few shillings to the
home. Bertie was weak. He had had
a slight fever the last few nights. As
soon as it was warmer the doctor wanted
him to go for a few weeks to an affiliated
institution by the sea. That would cost
more money.
  Jenny was in despair.
  On Monday morning she ran into Mme.
Lacour in Oxford Street. The dressmaker
stopped dead and gazed at her furiously,
and was about to move on, when she
changed her mind.
  “ You did not stay long in Rome, Miss
Devon,” she said coldly.
  “ No, madame; I did not like it,” the girl
answered.
  “ Oh, it was not such an improvement
as you thought it would be on my humble
establishment!” the Frenchwoman cried.
“ Are you working now?”
  “ No.”
  Madame had a high temper. She gave
Jenny the benefit of it. She was ungrate-
ful, stupid, just like the English, and all
the rest of it. Then she offered to take her
back.
   It is entirely because of the arch-
duchess. We are getting on with the trous-
seau. She will probably be displeased if
you are not there when next she comes. I
have written to ask for a visit next week.
She noticed you, and you certainly do look
something like her. You don’t deserve it,
but you can come back if you like.”
  Jenny played for time to think. She
wanted to go back, but she daren’t decide
at once. It was just that—the archduchess.
Could she bear to stand before her, pos-
turing in the clothes made for the royal
lady? Could she meet the baroness’s eyes?
Could she carry it off? She wanted to go
back. It would be like going home. If only
it weren’t for that.
  She said she would let madame know to-
morrow. She had almost arranged to take
on another post. Oh, these lies—how she
hated them!
  Madame went off grumbling at her in-
gratitude, but very much pleased all the
same.
  At her lodging Jenny found the Baroness
Dora Luini.
  Her face was a picture of anxiety.
  “ I have come to fetch you,” she said.
“ You must come back with me at once.
Thank Heaven, I have found you here!
The archduchess has gone again.”
  “ Gone again!” echoed Jenny.
  “ Yes. Oh, the wicked girl! The cruel
girl! Can you imagine such behavior? Her
majesty is beside herself. I have never seen
her so agitated. Last time was nothing to
this. And she is ninety-two! I am terrified
for her. We thought it was all right. The
archduchess was brought back; she swore
Count Saxt had nothing to do with it. We
know that she lied. She has hoodwinked
us. She came back to gain time. Prince
Nicholas suspected nothing. He did not see
much of her.
  “ We were grateful to you. Our minds
were quite at rest. And now she has gone
again. She went on Saturday—slipped out
of the castle without any one knowing.
And we had a wire this morning that she
and Count Saxt passed through Paris on
Sunday. It’s from the best informed source.
That young man is as wicked as she is.
It seems that he got permission to go to
the bedside of a sick relative. In the con-
fusion of the archduchess’s first flight the
empress was not told about it. The person
died, and he did not come back immediate-
ly, and the empress, who is very strict about
etiquette, sent word to him that he must not
return. There was no truth in that report
that he was with the archduchess in Venice.
But they must have planned it all. And
now there’s no doubt about it—they’ve gone
away together.”
  “ I—oh, I am sorry!” exclaimed Jenny.
  “ You will come back with me?”
  “I can’t. I really can’t!”
  “ You must. It won’t be for long again
—I assure you. This person who saw them
has gone in pursuit by this time, and the

other person who brought her back before
started yesterday. That person can influ-
ence her when no one else can. I told you
before; you saw that she came back. She
will come back again. You won’t fail us, my
dear. You can’t be so cruel, so heartless.”
“ You don’t understand,” Jenny mur-
mured. “ It is too difficult—too impossi-
ble!”
  “ I know. No one knows better. But
you have done it once.”
  Jenny looked at the nervously working
face in a dazed, wounded way.
  “ But just now it can’t matter. Give me
a little time. The prince has gone back.
He wasn’t to be here again for some time—
you told me.”
  “ I know,” said the baroness faintly.
“ But that is just it. He is coming back—
at once. A letter came for Stephanie this
morning. He has put off all sorts of en-
gagements and is coming back to the castle.
He has invited himself. He will be here
to-morrow night.”
CHAPTER XII.
WITH THE PRINCE.
ONCE more within the walls of Argar
Castle, Jenny stood by the window
of the archduchess’s orange and gold
sitting room and wondered why she had
consented to come back. Now that Prince
Nicholas’s arrival was only a matter of two
or three hours, she felt more anxious even
than she had done the first time. She knew
the pitfalls that awaited her. Ignorance had
really been a safeguard. It had made her
natural.
  She asked herself why she had come
back. Was it because the baroness had
pleaded so passionately? Perhaps, partly.
Was it because she had been so savagely
wounded in her woman’s soul and in her
self-esteem by what Marcus Phare had
dared to say to her? Perhaps, partly. But,
really? She knew why. Because she had
to come back. Because the prince was
coming back—coming back to her. Be-
cause he wanted to see her so badly that
he had put off all his engagements and was
returning at once. It was not Stephanie of
Rosemark he wanted so badly to see again.
No, no—the letters proved that it was not
Stephanie. It was Jenny Devon, the hum-
ble manikin.
  The baroness had given her the prince’s
letters. Jenny knew them all by heart.
The one that he had written in farewell,
when he sent his ring—the glorious ruby
that now glowed rosily on Jenny’s own
hand. He had asked her to be her sweet self
when he returned, and not her prickly one.
Evidently, Stephanie had not been nice to
him. And the second, written from Gal-
matia after his return, in answer to hers
thanking him for the ring.
  He had called hers a prim little note.
But he was glad she liked the ring. Evi-
dently, Stephanie had written formally. He
had told her that the big ruby was his-
torical, supposed to have been taken from
the crown of Charlemagne. He signed
himself hers sincerely, “ Nicholas, P.” But
the third letter she had kissed over and over
again when she was left alone at night. In
that the prince wrote: “ I am coming back,
you unkind girl. I can’t forget your un-
kindness, you see. I’m giving you an op-
portunity of being nice again. Please let me
find the little girl of the little room with
the china cabinets, and not the cross prin-
cess of the ballroom and the hunting field.”
  It was to her, to Jenny Devon, that he
was coming back. Those words proved it.
And Jenny felt as guilty at her own return
as if she were not doing the imperial family
the greatest service in the world.
  They had returned yesterday afternoon.
The first thing had been to give a sitting
to a photographer who had come to take
portraits of the archduchess. In the tem-
porary studio, with its brilliant lighting,
Jenny posed for more than half an hour to
the satisfaction of the artist, who, it ap-
peared, had never had the honor of making
pictures of her imperial highness before.
  She had seen the empress for a few min-
utes. The old lady had given her her won-
derful unfaded smile and thanked her for
coming back. She looked tired, and dined
in her own apartments. So did Jenny, with
the baroness in attendance. She spent the
whole morning with the baroness.
  The lady in waiting discoursed on the em-
ANOTHER WOMAN’S LIFE.
229
press’s wonderful character. Her body was
as frail as a wild rose leaf, but her spirit
was indomitable. Until her husband’s death
she had only been known as a peerless beau-
ty, and a somewhat frivolous one at that,
according to contemporary gossip. But she
had developed into a wonderful woman of
business. She managed everything in her
enormous household down to the smallest
details. She knew' every head of stock on
her farms, she knew how much sugar was
used every day in the castle. Her estates
were model ones; her farms were hugely
prosperous. She ruled as an autocrat, but
she had never done any one an injustice,
and she tended her servants with her own
hands when they were sick.
  Jenny learned other interesting and curi-
ous things; that the ex-empress possessed
the most valuable jewels in the world and
that they were all kept in the castle, and
she wore them constantly; that she always
slept with a loaded revolver by her side;
that all the laundry of the castle was sent
over to Boulogne to be washed and to Paris
to be ironed, and that certain of her ma-
jesty’s more personal articles of linen trav-
eled as far as a village in the south of
France, where lived a woman almost as old
as she was who had been her personal
laundress when she sat on her throne. Con-
sequently, she possessed enough household
linen to stock a town, and all the elaborate
cyphers and the imperial crowns on the
sheets and towels and pillow cases were em-
broidered in Irish convents. Also that every
single day of her life she descended to the
crypt under the chapel and laid fresh flow-
ers on her husband’s and son’s tombs,
  The empress was devoted to animals, and
there were some rare specimens in the wilder
parts of the grounds. She especially loved
dogs, and they were to be met on every side
and were allowed everywhere. But there
was not a cat in the castle. Instant dis-
missal would be the penalty for any one
who introduced a member of the feline
tribe.
  It was after five o’clock in the afternoon.
From the window Jenny looked straight
across the great grass drives of the park,
stretching as far as her eyes could see, be-
tween the clumps of enormous old chestnut
trees and giant elms, where the deer browsed
in the warm red rays of the sun about to
set.
  The baroness came into the room. Jenny
turned.
  “ Good heavens, how white you look!”
the elder woman exclaimed.
  “ I feel sick with fright,” the girl said.
“ I can’t see how the prince can take me
for the archduchess. I simply dread his
first sight of me. What will happen if he
knows I am a fraud?”
  “ You mustn’t think of such a thing, my
dear. It only upsets you.”
  “ But if he does know?”
  “ We shall have to explain,” said the
baroness, evidently anxious to soothe her.
“ But it’s not at all likely. He had no sus-
picion about the archduchess. I have told
you he saw very little of her. You must
put some color on your cheeks.”
  “ The prince told me he hated it,” Jenny
said.
  “ I daresay. He told the archduchess,
too; but she wouldn’t take any notice of
that.”
  “ Therefore I mustn’t?”
  “ Exactly. You must remember that—
that—” She hesitated.
  “ That I am only a substitute.” There
was more bitterness in Jenny’s voice than
she knew.
  “ My dear, I am thinking of you as much
as of any one else,” the baroness said
hastily. “ Perhaps it would be as well not
to make yourself too attractive. I hardly
know how to put it—”
  “You mean that I might fall in love with
the prince,” the girl exclaimed.
  “ He certainly might very easily fall in
love with you,” was the retort. “ You see,
the archduchess is rather offhand in her
manner. He evidently noticed a difference
—you can see that in his letters. He
thought her capricious. I am inclined to
think it would be better to take that line.
For—for both your sakes,” she concluded
rather lamely.
  Jenny understood the hint. The prince
must have referred to something that had
passed between them to the archduchess,
who had repeated it to her lady in waiting,
no doubt in mockery. Jenny was beginning
230
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY
to hate the archduchess. Why was she so
foolish as to do this for her? It wasn’t
fair to ask her to. She mustn’t forget that
she was the humble little manikin. Oh, no!
She mustn’t presume to imagine that the
prince could fall in love with her, or that
she might allow herself to care for him.
Everything he said to her was meant for
his future wife.
  It was in a mood of miserable revolt
that she was arrayed for dinner in a won-
derful golden gown, with a wreath of small
golden roses in her hair that a pope had
once given to one of the archduchess’s an-
cestresses in the days when popes went
about in society and entertained sumptuous-
ly in the Vatican, not even scorning hunt-
ing parties and masquerades.
  “ It isn’t fair!” she repeated to herself.
“It isn’t fair!”
  She was in the empress’s sitting room with
the other members of the family when
Prince Nicholas came in. His eyes sought
hers at once, laughing, bright with excite-
ment. She found herself flushing painfully.
She could have sunk through the floor in
the agonized suspense of that first moment.
  He bent over her hand, murmuring his
conventional greetings. She bowed and re-
plied mechanically.
  The ex-empress annexed him, talking
much more familiarly than usual. Per-
haps beneath that exquisite manner there
was a hint of anxiety, too. It was a game
of incredible boldness that they were all
playing. Her majesty rallied him playfully
on his prompt return, inquired after his
family, and made him describe the beauties
of the early spring in his southern land.
  At dinner the places were differently ar-
ranged. The prince sat on the empress’s
right and Jenny on the Archduke Gabriel’s
left, with one of the prince’s gentlemen on
her other side. He was young and very
ready to talk. The table was of a flattened
horseshoe shape, so that Jenny could not see
much of the prince. But once or twice he
leaned forward to catch her eye and to toast
her with the smile that had stolen her heart
away.
  She found him more irresistible than ever.
It was perfectly obvious that he still had
no suspicions. It was marvelous to her,
almost incredible. She could hardly see at
that time, so confused and distressed was
she, that the mere possibility of there being
two girls so much alike had not presented
itself to him. And, still less, would he, or
any other young man in his place, have
credited the empress with the bold simplici-
ty of such a deception. The very success
of the undertaking lay in its impossibility.
  But for Jenny Devon these thoughts were
too subtle. She only knew that she felt
like a criminal.
  The archduke was a very silent person.
He only addressed her twice throughout the
elaborate and seemingly endless meal. Both
times it was to ask her opinion of a dish
he was very fond of. Jenny did not know
what his vacant air meant, but she had an
idea that he was not exactly “ all there.”
She believed, for instance, that after she
had been explained to him his mind slipped
back and he really took her to be his niece.
He only seemed to live in his mimic battles
on the great maps with the toy soldiers and
the little flags.
  All through the subdued but lively con-
versation of Prince Nicholas’s young
equerry, Captain Florimar, one thought em-
bedded itself in Jenny’s brain.
  The prince was too dear to her. Though
she was not close to him, his spell was
stronger than ever. She couldn’t resist it
unless she used all her self-control. She
must play a part—for her own sake. If
he still wooed her, she must keep him at
arm’s length. It was her only salvation.
If she allowed her heart to sway her, she
would lose herself forever. It was an in-
stinctive resolve. He meant too much to
her. He could mean nothing in the end.
She could not bear it.
  There was some wonderful orchestral
music after dinner. The empress withdrew
very early. The music went on after she
left. Prince Nicholas bent over Jenny.
  “ Come to the China room—I want to
talk to you,” he whispered.
  She had to go with him. It was clear
from the empress’s manner that they were
to be allowed all the amenities of engaged
couples. The girl thrilled all over as her
hand touched his coat sleeve, but she was
stern with herself. On with the mask!
ANOTHER WOMAN’S LIFE.
231
  In the little cedar paneled room were
masses of forced white and purple lilac.
The subtle, rapturous scent met them like
a southern night breeze.
  “ Now you’re going to make friends with
me, Stephanie,” Nicholas said.
  “ Aren’t we friends?” Jenny asked rather
awkwardly.
  “ We weren’t when I left, little girl. Why
did you hide yourself And write me that
freezing little note? To make me come
back, I suppose. Well, you’ve done it!”
He bent to take her in his arms.
  She drew back.
  His eyes darkened.
  “ So it’s like that? You think you can
make a fool of me by putting out your
prickles? I ought to have known from the
first that you were nothing but a flirt.
That’s what one’s heard about you.”
  In her devastating nervousness Jenny
used exactly the same words as the real
Stephanie had spoken.
  “ We—we shall get along all right.”
“You said that before,” he retorted.
“ But why, in Heaven’s name, were you
so different at first? Why did you let me
kiss you? Why did you cry? Why did you
lie in my arms as if you liked to be there?
Why did you look at me with those wonder-
ful eyes of love”
  On with the mask!
  Jenny braced herself. She made her voice
gay. It sounded awful in her own ears.
  “ I—I thought I’d try to fall in love with
you.”
  “ And you didn’t succeed.” He laughed
angrily. “ Many thanks. It’s a pity. It
was a pretty mood of yours. You must be
a wonderful actress. I quite thought we
might—have been happy together.”
  “ I did, too.” She laughed—on the verge
of hysteria.
  “ It’s just as well to know where we
are,” he said savagely and looked like a
beautiful young thunderstorm. “ You
needn’t think that I shall worry you in any
way. I was an idiot to come back.”
  “ Why did you?” she asked. The farce
had to be kept up.
  “ Because you were so nasty to me,” he
answered bluntly. “ The dear little girl of
the first days I should have thought of and
dreamed about, and gone on with my life as
usual. But after the day’s hunting and
your horrid ways at the ball—” He broke
off furiously. “ Why, you kissed me will-
ingly enough before! But I might have
been poison that night. And not a sight of
you afterward except in chapel, looking like
a wooden image! That’s why I came back,
and I’m sorry I ever did.”
  “ So am I,” echoed Jenny from her heart,
indeed, although her voice made the state-
ment sound unkind and shrill.
  “ Well, it doesn’t matter,” Nicholas said.
“ I suppose we can at least be friends. It’s
about the utmost we could expect anyway—
people like us. It’s a darned shame. We’re
positive slaves. Well, I won’t keep you
here any longer, Stephanie. I’ve made an
idiotic mistake. Shake hands! We may
as well be friends as we’ve got to marry.”
  “ Yes,” said Jenny, with feverish light-
ness in her voice, “ we may as well be
friends, as we’ve got to marry.”
  They shook hands, and Jenny fled to her
rooms, while from below the maddening,
stupefying strains of the “ Love Death,” of
“ Tristan and Isolde,” followed her.
CHAPTER XIII.
UNCOVERED?
“ TV It ME. LACOUR writes that she is
I y I held up,” the baroness said to
Jenny, with anxiously knitted
brows. “ She has the material for the wed-
ding gown. She has more than a dozen
dresses ready. She urges an immediate
visit.”
  “ How can I go there?” the girl asked.
“ They all know me so well. They would
be sure to recognize me.”
  “ It is most risky, I admit. The place
is comparatively small.”
  “ Can’t you put madame off?” asked
Jenny. “ The archduchess must be back
one day this week. You said they had
traced her to Naples.”
 “ I know. But what excuse can we
make? The clothes are so important.
We’re not giving her time. It’s only just
a month to the wedding, and there are the
court gowns not yet fitted.”
232
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  In the end the baroness found a solution.
Mme. Lacour was commanded to Argar
Castle with her young ladies. One of the
big paneled rooms was rigged up with a
stage at one end.
  Jenny and the baroness sat in the dark-
ened room, while the manikins paraded on
the brilliantly lit platform, showing off the
exquisite creations. Madame, who curt-
sied to the ground before her ex-manikin,
explained the gowns and begged for a fit-
ting for some of them. She had previously
explained to the baroness that the manikin
of whom the archduchess had generously
approved had left her establishment in the
most sudden manner and with shameful in-
gratitude. She had met her in the street
not many days ago and actually offered to
take her back: but she had only received
a telegram from her saying that she had
accepted another post.
  Jenny saw little Linette Gurney, with her
hunched shoulders and her plain, pathetic
little face. She badly wanted to talk to
her. It was hard work not to when, after-
ward, she stood up and the gorgeous silver
cloth of the manteau de cour was draped
on her, and the shoulder knots of real pearls
were brought from the jewel case and fas-
tened in their places, and madame stood
back in delight, pointing out the del bleu
velvet roses nestling in the glittering em-
broidery that lined the side of the train.
  “ Your imperial highness, it is ravishing! ”
she cried. “ It’s a dream—a poem!”
  And little Linette, her mouth full of pins,
looked up with adoration at the slender
girlish figure with the radiant hair, the
perfect princess of her dreams, standing
there, proud, and unsmiling, as if the sight
of all these beautiful clothes could arouse
no emotion in her royal breast. That was
how a princess should be in the little cock-
ney’s eyes: unmoved, completely wrapped
up in her own greatness and her own
beauty.
  Jenny gave her a quick smile before she
left the room, and Linette Gurney walked
on air for a week.
  It was a very severe test. A triumphant
one. Nobody recognized her. But, then,
of course, they never dreamed of such a
thing.
  “ There is a deputation for you to receive
this morning,” the baroness informed Jenny
two days later, when she came into her
room to announce and discuss the plans for
the day.
  “ Some gentlemen who are the trustees
of the hospital and convalescent home for
children of the east end of London that
you laid the foundation stone of the other
day are bringing the plans and an illumi-
nated address and a wedding present.”
  “ What do I do?” asked Jenny in
alarm.
  “ You look at the plans and accept the
address and the present and say a few words
of thanks. It won’t take long. You will
receive them in the blue drawing room.
Prince Nicholas will be with you. You
needn’t be in the least nervous. They are
city men and not one of them has ever seen
you before.”
  “ Is there no news?” asked Jenny anx-
iously.
  “ Not yet; nothing definite. Unfortu-
nately they had left Naples. But they are
positively located. It can only be a mat-
ter of days. The empress has sent tele-
grams to the King of Italy and to the Pope.
The utmost pressure is being brought to
bear.”
  “ I don’t think I can keep it up much
longer,” said Jenny, half crying with the
strain. “ It’s having to play a part—all the
time.”
  “ You are doing wonderfully well, my
dear,” comforted the baroness. “ It’s amaz-
ing. You’re much more like the arch-
duchess now. So gay, and a little more
careless than you were.”
  “ More desperate, you mean,” put in the
girl with a touch of passion.
  “ And the prince? Is it going all right?
Are you remembering?”
  “ I am remembering,” Jenny answered,
“ that as far as I can make out, the arch-
duchess will treat him like dirt. Oh, yes, it
is quite all right! We have agreed to be
friends.”
  She had learned her lesson. She was be-
having to the prince as she imagined the
archduchess had done. She was apparent-
ly doing it very well. He was jolly and in
the highest spirits on the surface, but she
ANOTHER WOMAN'S LIFE.
233
believed he was profoundly disappointed in
her.
  What could that matter? She had taken
this game on. Her feelings didn't count.
If she broke her heart, that was nothing as
long as the match between Nicholas of Gal-
matia and Stephanie of Rosemark became
an accomplished fact. Royalties didn't ex-
pect domestic happiness. Nicholas con-
stantly said so. He said things in a care-
less way that cut her to the very quick.
He assumed that she was just a girl who
would bury her feelings deep out of sight
for the sake of those horrid ‘ reasons of
State,’ who was quite willing to make a po-
litical marriage, and eventually become a
queen. And so heartless was she that she
had even pretended to fall in love with him
until his too ready response offended her.
  He despised her. Jenny felt that. And
she was more desperately and hopelessly in
love with him than ever.
  The hour came to receive the deputation.
  They assembled in the blue drawing-
room, a vast chamber with the usual fur-
nishings of state apartments in royal pal-
aces, much gilding, enormous glittering
crystal chandeliers, chairs and couches up-
holstered in sky blue velvet, curtains em-
broidered in gold, a hideous carpet, like a
pale blue sea, with the imperial coat of
arms in the center, and a border of golden
eagles.
  Prince Nicholas was attended by three
gentlemen, the archduchess by the baron-
ess, another lady, and General Mortis.
They stood by a huge marble-topped table
with gilded feet.
  The deputation came in. and was pre-
sented by one of the household.
  Jenny had learned to look at people with-
out seeing them, particularly a group of
people. She smiled and held out her hand,
and each gentleman in turn bent low over
it.
  Then suddenly her heart seemed to stand
still.
  “ Mr. Marcus Phare,” announced the
resonant voice. “ Mr. Phare is one of the
two trustees, your imperial highness, and
has most generously increased the endow-
ment of the hospital by fifty thousand
pounds.”
  Jenny stood like a statue. She could not
bring herself to look at the man, but she
knew from something magnetic in the at-
mosphere that it was he.
  The little ceremony went on. She ex-
amined the plans, praised them. She re-
ceived the address, and a beautiful golden
casket. She thanked the deputation in the
few words she had learned by heart, in a
very low voice, shaking with nervousness.
  Then Prince Nicholas moved about
among the gentlemen, and she supposed she
ought to do the same.
  She nerved herself, looked up, and im-
mediately met the concentrated gaze of
Marcus Phare’s steely blue eyes. They
flashed an unmistakable message to her. In
that moment she knew that he knew who
she was.
  She did not know what to do. She felt
like a rat in a trap. She knew that he
would not speak to her unless she spoke to
him first. She longed frantically to test
her fears. Yet she was trembling so that
she could hardly move.
  She caught the baroness’s eyes with fear
in them. The lady in waiting thought she
was going to break down. She mustn't do
that. She forced herself to move. She
spoke to one member of the deputation,
then to another. She came up to Marcus
Phare. It seemed as if it took her a year.
Her head was swimming.
  “ It’s—a lovely day,” she managed to
say.
  He bowed with the easy grace of a man
accustomed to mix with all classes of peo-
ple in all countries.
  “ As your imperial highness says,” he
replied, “ it is a lovely day.”
  She heard the subtle accent on the title,
and she knew as well as possible that he was
giving it to her knowing it to be a lie.
  The moment had come. The game had
failed. She was found out.
  The deputation withdrew. The last thing
Jenny was aware of was the uncompromis-
ing gaze of those blue eyes, that revealed
nothing, that promised nothing, that
threatened everything.
  She did not dare tell the baroness. The
rest of the day passed like a dream. She
tried to persuade herself that she was
234
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
wrong. She would wait for a sign from
him.
Several days passed, and none came.
CHAPTER XIV.
THE END OF THE GAME.
IT came to the day on which Prince Nich-
olas was leaving England again, not to
return before the wedding.
  To Jenny this whole period had been a
whirl so confusing that she could hardly
tell one day from the other. Deputations
bringing presents; addresses of congratula-
tion; court ceremonies; three nights in
London; a glittering pageant of public
gatherings; balls, banquets, a gala night
at the opera; drives through thronged
streets; a sea of faces around her that she
had never seen before and would never see
again.
  People raved about the bride, and said
that she looked very tired, but more lovely
than words could describe. Her behavior
was perfect. She seemed to touch every-
body’s heart. The gay mouth and the sad,
questioning eyes, and the weariness from
the incessant strain made a combination
that seemed to lift her into another sphere.
  Every day she asked the baroness for
news. Each day there was none. The run-
away pair had escaped to Greece. The
pursuers were hot on their trail. It could
only be a matter of days, perhaps hours.
  “ But,” said Jenny again and again in
despair, “ it can’t go on!”
  The baroness admitted that it couldn’t
go on. But there was no doubt. The
archduchess must be brought back within
a day or two after the prince’s departure,
[ennv must hold out. She had done so
much. Never, never could they repay her.
  They were back at Argar Castle. There
was a lull. There had been a walk in the
park in the morning to inspect the deer.
Prince Nicholas was making his prepara-
tions for departure. He was to leave about
six.
  At five o’clock a message from him was
brought to Jenny in her rooms—would she
honor his royal highness by meeting him in
the library?
  She could think of no excuse. Her heart
failed her, as she slipped into a gown of
white cashmere with dull silver embroid-
eries and a hem of white fur.
  She went downstairs alone and found
Nicholas standing by the great open fire-
place, looking rather awkward and self-
conscious. As she came in, he took a large
flat case from a table beside him.
  “ These have just come, Stephanie. I
wanted to give them to you. They are my
presents. A messenger brought them to-
day.”
  He opened the case; she fell back, daz-
zled by the splendor of the jewels. More
rubies—a long chain, a large square pen-
dant, big earrings, bangles, and a gorgeous
stomacher.
  “Oh!” she said below her breath.
“ They are much too grand for me!”
  She spoke out of her heart, laying the
case on a large table on which were silver
baskets full of red roses. And she looked
at him, speechless with sorrow and fear.
  “Stephanie!” His voice was low and
hoarse and thrilling. “ Why, you speak
like the little girl of the China room! And
you look— Oh, Stephanie!”
  Before she could move she was in his
arms, and he was raining kisses on her face
and hair, and she was sobbing as if her
heart would break.
  “ Stephanie! Stephanie, you do care!
My little love! My little love! You were
playing and pretending all the time—trying
to pretend! But you do care! I can see
it in your lovely eyes. I can feel your lit-
tle heart beating against mine!”
  She went on crying. She could not help
herself. She did not give back the kisses,
but she lay passive in his strong young
arms in a hazy dream of bliss, lulled by
the beloved voice showering on her its pas-
sionate words of love.
  “ Stephanie, you have given yourself
away, you little witch! Oh, my sweet-
heart, how I love you! How I love you!
And I know you love me! I shall be away
such a short time, and then I’ll come back
and we’ll never be parted again.”
  The magic moments passed. She hardly
knew what she said—just broken sentences,
things that a lover knows but always wants
ANOTHER WOMAN’S LIFE.

to hear. All her defences were broken
down.
 They stood there, lost to everything but
 themselves, not heeding the rubies and the
 roses, but only their love.
 Then Nicholas had to tear himself away.
 And his last words were a gay command.
 “ Think of me every second, sweetheart,
 until I come back!”
 A week to the wedding. Five days to
 the wedding. Three days to the wedding.
 Jenny asked the baroness her daily ques-
 tion.
 “ Where is the archduchess?”
 And the answer was one of despair.
 “ I don’t know. They have escapea.
 They have disappeared.”
 There seemed nothing to say. The sit-
 uation was monstrous. A royal wedding—
 and no royal bride.
 The day came on which the prince was
 returning. He was to arrive in the eve-
 ning. It was against imperial usage for
 him to stay at the castle, so the house of
 a neighboring landowner had been placed
 at his disposal and that of his suite.
 But he was coming to dine en famille at
 the castle.
  The empress had been laid up with in-
fluenza. The baroness was terrified of the
effect on her frail health.
  Jenny and the baroness were summoned
to her majesty’s sitting room about a quar-
ter of an hour before the prince was due.
  The little old lady was more richly
dressed than ever, and her jewels were more
splendid.
  She smiled at Jenny.
  “ There is no news of Stephanie,” she
said. “ She has entirely disappeared. You
have done all you can. The prince will be
here directly. I will tell him the truth.
There is nothing else to be done. As soon
as he comes I will tell him.”
  Some one came to say that his royal
highness’s motor car had entered the castle
gates.
  The empress smiled at Jenny again.
  “ Go to your rooms, my child. It is not
fair for you to be here. It has been my
doing. The prince shall know that you are
perfectly blameless. Luini, you can stay
until the prince comes. Then you can
withdraw, too. I would rather speak to
his royal highness alone.”
  Jenny, trembling in every limb, made
her deep curtsy and left the room.
  TO BE CONTINUED NEXT WEEK
   THE OUT TRAIL
A LITTLE moon’s the new moon, low in green skies;
    Yet who can see the new moon but something in him sighs
To start for secret places beyond the edge of things,
A new hope in his bosom and a heart that sings!
Wondrously the rounded moon wheels overhead
And floods the world with loveliness till desire is dead,
And beauty drowns the breathless world, but better had desire
Not perished in this loveliness of still white fire.
A wistful moon’s the old moon, fading with day,
And weary the returning feet of one long astray
Who sought the secret places—but something in his eyes
Reveals the strange happiness of a heart that sighs.

THEY called him the Gatlin’ Gun. He
could hit from any angle with the
speed of machine gun fire.
  He continually wore the expression of a
lost sheep in the ring. And always, when
hit hard, he would look at his antagonist
as if to say, “ Now that wasn’t fair.” In
the flash of an eye he would then turn tiger
and send terrific five-ounce mallets of pain
in all directions. Some were jabs of six
inches in length, and some were swings that
swished swiftly through the air, humming
like bullets. And some were straight arm
jabs that carried a long sleep in their wake.
  Indeed, a mighty man was the Gatlin’
Gun, and mighty men he had whipped.
And to the credit of the ring, there was
always a new man to trade blows with him.
For fear is a plant of weak growth in the
prize ring. The Gatlin’ Gun’s rivals asked
no odds, they gave none, and when whipped
they tried to rise with oblivion creeping
over their brains.
  The Gatlin’ Gun feinted with his black
eyes. So great a master was he that he
could look at one point in his antagonist’s
defense, and aim his blows there, then sud-
denly shift his aim to the unprotected por-
tion of the other fighter’s body. They
would land with the impact of iron weights
hitting a wall.
  The Gatlin’ Gun was a handsome fellow.
His brown hair waved back from a high
white forehead. His features were strong,
well proportioned and well chiseled. He
weighed one hundred and seventy pounds.
  He seldom talked long at a time.
  Neither had he ever been known to have
a sense of fear or pity. He was as merci-
less as a Gatling gun prepared for action.
  He leaned his elbows on the table in the
dining car, and looked out of the window
with a bored expression while his manager
chatted. 11 We’re guaranteed ten thousand,
Gatlin’, and even if we do say we’ll give
two thousand to Iron Jaw Bolan for lasting
236
THE GLASS JAW.

ten rounds—well, he just won’t last them.
This guy’s got a glass jaw, an’ you’ll stick
your mitt through it before the fight goes
very long.”
  “ Yes, I’ll crack him early,” said the
Gatlin’ Gun. “ I want to get the ten thirty
train back to Cleveland.”
  “ That’s the ticket,” was Teddy’s com-
ment. “ I hate to lay over all night in
these tank towns.”
  The Gatlin’ Gun rubbed his knuckles
and said, “ All right, but I’m tired of fight-
ing boobs. First thing you know we’ll do
a jolt for murder. This guy’s been in the
war and had a bullet rip through his jaw.
This is the first time out since then, and
before that every fighter he met used to
pull the curtain down over the glass win-
dow in his jaw.”
    Yep,” said the manager, a swarthy lit-
tle fellow with a black, needle-pointed mus-
tache, “ they call him Iron Jaw Bolan now,
an’ he thinks he’s good. They were kiddin’
him when I was down there gettin’ the
match, an’ he says, “ Well, you kin tell the
Gatlin’ Gun for me he’ll have to shoot ’em
harder’n a gatlin’, ’cause I’m goin’ to lick
’im.”
  The Gatlin’ Gun smiled, and rubbed his
well chiseled jaw with his left hand. He
then put his silk cuff in place, and still
smiling, said, “ I hear Iron Jaw can hit,
Teddy, is that so?”
  “ Yep,” answered Teddy, “ they tell me
he throws a mean mitt. But he can’t hit
a clever man. He goes to pieces when they
crack ’im on the jaw and he has to get a
new pane o’ glass in it. He’s been battered
on the head so much he’s goofy. Poor
fish.”
  “ Yep, poor fish,” repeated the Gatlin’
Gun, “ I’ll drain the water out of the pond
to-night.”
  The train swerved, the engine whistle
shrieked, and soon the long limited slowed
up and stopped at Findlay.
  A committee, wearing badges, met the
Gatlin’ Gun and his manager, Teddy Ray,
at the station. “ Great night,” said the
chairman to Teddy; “ the crowd’s crazy to
see the Gatlin’ Gun. WTe got your guar-
antee in advance already, and still they’re
cornin’.” Teddy Ray was loquacious, while
the Gatlin’ Gun smoothed the well tailored
lapel of his coat and upstaged the crowd.
Leaders of uneventful lives, counters of
money, employers of labor, lawyers and
doctors, who were they anyhow? They
didn’t even know how to block a left jab.
  A taxi drew up, and manager and fighter
were whisked away to the leading hotel, the
lobby of which was crowded to obtain a
view of the famous Gatlin’ Gun. But he,
like a bored preacher at a bartenders’ pic-
nic, ignored them all.
  “ I wish Iron Jaw’d knock his block off!”
exclaimed a man in the crowd.
  “If wishes were horses we’d aH have
Fords,” was the comeback of another.
“ Iron Jaw can’t hit that bird with a load
of buckshot.”
  Iron Jaw Bolan was one of those men
who would have been a great fighter, but—
he had a glass jaw. A knockout on the
jaw is the most painless of all knockouts.
A quick curtain drops on the brain, and the
pugilist sinks, forgetful of battles and
blows, and sleeps for a short while. The
next day or week the jaw might ache, and
sometimes nothing but soft nourishment
can be taken. But that is all.
  A glass jaw is one in which the nerves
leading up to the brain are more easily con-
nected with. In all other ways it may be
even an iron muscled jaw. But this weak-
ness has kept more pugilists from reaping
the great reward than all others combined.
At least seventy-five out of every hundred
knockouts are bludgeoned on the jaw.
Iron Jaw Bolan had been given his name
ironically on account of the dreaded glass
jaw.
  He was silent and stolid. Life to him
was a drab meadow, and he was an ox that
roamed within. He had always been a
drawing card in Findlay in spite of the
weak jaw. For he battled like a fiend,
and not all hitters, even the heaviest of
them, connected with the jaw. When they
connected squarely, the fight was generally
over. He would not have a manager. He
trained always with a larger and even more
stolid brother.
  His legs were of iron, and he could run
ten miles over the pretty roads that
stretched through the countryside
238
A RGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  Then the war came, and he went away
with his brother. He was going over the
top one morning when a bullet popped into
his mouth. It carried away part of his
lower jawbone.
  He was taken to a base hospital, and
later removed to Paris. The surgeons there
took one of his ribs and fashioned a new
jawbone for him.
  When the war ended it found Iron Jaw
Bolan full of dumb agony over his blasted
future.
  Knowing the weak nature of his jaw he
had given up the ring completely. To-
gether the two brothers tilled their farm,
and put stolid dreams of ring careers be-
hind them seemingly forever.
  Always a diligent reader of boxing news,
Iron Jaw Bolan allowed nothing to escape
him. By a peculiar twist of the mind, he
had learned the leading events in ring his-
tory from the very beginning of it. Tom
Figg, Jem Mace, Heenan, and Sayers, Cor-
bett, Jeffries, and Fitzsimmons, were all fa-
miliar to him. He knew their famous blows
and all their fighting eccentricities.
  After reading the offer of two thousand
made by the Gatlin’ Gun’s manager to any
man who would stay ten rounds with him,
Iron Jaw turned to his brother Jack and
said, “ I wonder if I kin keep my jaw outa
the Gatlin’s way for ten rounds. It ’ud
mean a lot to me an’ you both. We’ll never
git on our feet this way. Jane’s been wait-
ing a long time now, an’ we owe everybody
an’ his brother. I jist gotta take a chance
on gittin’ my jaw cracked or somethin’.”
  Jack rubbed a stubby chin and looked
across at his brother.
  Iron Jaw’s parents had named him Pearl.
But no one but Jack and Jane ever called
him that. It was too much like saying
“ Kitty ” to a lion. “ Well, Pearl, you
know, till they started crackin’ your jaw
they weren’t no better man in the world.
I	never see no one could fight like you.
Then, course, they all played for your jaw,
an’ you was so busy blockin’ it you couldn’t
give your ’tention to the fight. Then, when
you did, zowie, they’d gloom you.”
  The conversation always ended the same
when the day’s work was over. Stolid men
the Bolans were, but they had one thing in
keeping with the men who eventually win.
They had the tenacity of bulldogs fighting
to the death over the bone that was their
ambition.
  “ I’ll tell you, Pearl, I’ll git John Ames
to match you with the Gatlin’ Gun. You
kin draw a crowd here if you’ll fight again.
Are you willin’?”
  “ Yes,” answered Iron Jaw slowly, “ I’ll
fight him.”
  “ That’s good,” as slowly answered Jack;
“ you kin keep your jaw down, an’ I’ll prac-
tice hittin’ it a little harder each day while
you’re trainin’.”
  In a few days the Gatlin’ Gun’s manager
appeared, and the match was made.
  The brothers trained alone, and faith-
fully.
  Many a night in a large attic room, by
the feeble glare of two kerosene lamps, they
boxed and wrestled about. Always did
Jack play carefully for the jaw of his
brother, and always would he lurch for-
ward to hold him when he was apparently
beaten. After a furious exchange between
the two, Iron Jaw once said, “ Now, listen,
Jack, talk to the referee good. Tell him
not to stop the fight till he counts ten, may-
be I’ll jist stagger an’ look bad an’ not be
out. Maybe that little somethin’ jerks over
my brain an’ goes right away again.”
  “ I’ll ’member that,” replied Jack; “ the
referee’s a good guy. You know that.”
  “ Yeah. I know, but watch he don’t for-
get.”
  As the hour of the fight drew near the
two brothers walked slowly in the direc-
tion of the place in which it was to be
held.
  Breasts pounding with drama they still
remained as quiet as one of their own mules
at midnight. Not able to give utterance to
their feelings they looked at the indistinct
shadows along the road, but said no word.
  “ Wonder what Jane ’11 think of the
fight?” remarked Iron Jaw presently.
  “ She told me she might come,” Jack
replied, and then, as if in an afterthought:
“ I wish it was over.”
  “ It won’t be long now,” said Iron Jaw.
“ It ’11 be over soon.”
  They hurried past the crowd in front of
the building and entered the rear door. All
THE GLASS JAW.
239
was excitement within. The elite of the
Findlay sporting world had gathered there.
Jack called the referee aside, and said so
all could hear: “ We don’t ask for nothin’,
only don’t rule Pearl out before you count
ten. We got a hunch he might stagger an’
act goofy, but if he’s on ’is feet, let ’im stay,
will yer?”
  The referee and promoter, a smare bil-
liard room owner, looked at the intense
face of Jack, and then at Iron Jaw. “ I’ll
do that, for it’s cornin’ to you both,” he
answered.
  Iron Jaw stepped up and said: “ Thanks,
John,” and stood back silent.
  “ Think you’ll win, Iron?” asked the
referee.
  “ I know it,” replied Iron Jaw, as he
walked toward the dressing room with Jack.
  “ Lordy,” said an overhearer as the
brothers walked away, “ if nerve w?as money
them guys would be Peerpoint Morgan.”
  “ Well, you gotta admire them for that,”
rejoined another, “ and besides, we all know
Iron Jaw can fight.”
  In a short time Gatlin’ Gun appeared on
the scene. The place became a-whirr with
the murmur of voices. But the Napoleon
of the ring looked neither to the right or
to the left. His manager walked ahead
as much as to say: “ Make way for the
king,” and men fell back. A bell boy fol-
lowed, carrying the Gatlin’ Gun’s fighting
paraphernalia.
  The Gatlin’ Gun was soon alone in the
dressing room, save for the boy who re-
mained near him. Like a trained monkey
the boy would jump at the slightest nod of
the Gatlin’ Gun.
  Teddy Ray left and soon returned to the
Gatlin’ Gun’s dressing room. “ The first
prelim’s over,” he said, “an’ there’s a six
round semi between two hams. They can’t
stand up six rounds, so we’ll sure make
that train. I got all our dough but the two
thousand we got to give up if Iron Jaw
stays the limit. I’ll grab that right away
an’ we’ll beat it for the depot in a taxi.”
  “That suits me fine; these hick towns
give me the shivers,” answered the Gatlin’
Gun.
  The semiwind-up ended in the third
round. The crowd yelled for the main event.
  The Gatlin Gun was the first to climb
through the ropes. Proud was his bearing,
as became a man, who in a hundred battles,
had never been knocked down by a blow
from a glove. Immediately his face took
on the lamblike expression. It was part of
his repertoire. He tested the ropes and
then walked casually about the ring. The
crowd cheered lustily, but he paid no atten-
tion. His body was as well formed and
powerful as the granite dream of a sculptor.
His feet no sooner touched the canvas than
they seemed to spring his form forward as
though on new rubber. Narrow in the hips
his body widened until it was immense at
the shoulders. A mountain of graceful mus-
cle he was whom the leather rage of battle
had never dented. His eyes darted quickly
hither and thither, not the slightest move-
ment escaping him. They, were eyes that
could see more than those of many people.
  When he returned to his corner, he spoke
tersely to his manager and as he did so, his
thin lips curled into a half sneer. Then
the tiger crept into his eyes, and puckered
lines of cruelty formed around them.
  He seated himself and looked up in an
unconcerned manner while loud cheering
shook the building.
  Iron Jaw Bolan was climbing through the
ropes. His brother followed him. He had
no other seconds, or trainers.
  He contrasted greatly with the Gatlin’
Gun. The scar on his jaw could be distinct-
ly seen under the strong lights of the ring.
While the crowd still cheered he threw his
bathrobe over the chair in his corner, and
stood with his left hand leaning on the top
rope of the ring.
  The crowd gasped at the muscular build
of the man. “ Lord, if he didn’t have a
glass jaw!” commented one man.
  “ Can’t tell, maybe some doctor in France
lined it with iron,” laughed another. “ He’s
game, though, you gotta say that for him,”
added a third. The gloves were adjusted,
and the men were called quickly to the
center of the ring.
  Around them grouped several men. Jack
Bolan stood back of Iron Jaw, a heavy
towel thrown over his arm. The customary
instructions were given, and the fighters
nodded their heads with half bored looks
240
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
as men will who have heard the same words
many times. In another minute they
touched gloved hands in what was meant as
a quick handshake.
  They returned to their corners, and pres-
ently the announcer shouted, pointing to the
Gatlin’ Gun’s corner: “ La-dies a-n-d gen-
tle-men, Jack Carrol in this corner, cham-
peen of the wo-r-ld.” Then he snapped like
the crack of a whip: “ The Gatlin’ Gun.”
The crowd cheered, and the great bruiser
condescended to nod at them with a bored
expression.
  And then—in the same singsong voice:
“ La-dies a-n-d gen-tle-men — Iron Jaw
Bolan—the pride of Findlay.” More cheer-
ing. “ The men will fight ten rounds to a
decision, the champeen forfeits two thou-
sand dollars if he fails to knock out Iron
Jaw Bolan.” He clapped Kis hands to-
gether.
  A tense quiet spread over the crowd.
The gong rang. The Gatlin’ Gun and Iron
Jaw went forth to battle.
  They made a picture of animal motion
that thrilled the crowd. Iron Jaw’s right
arm was bent, and the glove formed a bul-
wark of protection against his left jaw
through which the bullet had gone. The
Gatlin’ Gun, his hands moving gracefully,
his face mild, was feinting with his eyes.
Iron Jaw fell into the trap for a second, and
his right glove dropped from his left jaw.
The Gatlin’ Gun’s great shoulders moved
quicker than a flash, and his right glove
zipped through the air and caught poor
Iron Jaw in the very place the bullet had.
He staggered backward, his eyes popping,
his gloves sinking to his sides, his body
falling to the floor. The Gatlin’ Gun
stepped back, the gleam of execution in his
eyes. Jack Bolan yelled: “ Come on,
Pearl, you ain't licked yet.” He wasn’t.
He was up at the count of three and rush-
ing like a madman. The expression of a
lamb left the Gatlin’ Gun’s face. He was
a tiger driven into a comer.
  One body swayed against the ropes, then
another. They fought to the center of the
ring amid a thudding clatter of gloves. The
Gatlin’ Gun had no time to measure his
man, though he did throw sledgelike leather
blows at the glass jaw of his antagonist.
They worked in close, and the great science
of the Gatlin’ Gun came into play. Blows
rained from every angle on Iron Jaw. He
lifted one foot at a time and stamped it
on the canvas floor to relieve the pain. He
then stood rigid; the muscles in his legs as
taut as the strings of a violin.
  “ I’ll break your jaw, damn you!” hissed
the Gatlin’ Gun in a clinch. Iron Jaw kept
on fighting, and grunted “ Huh! ” Then the
gong rang.
  Jack Bolan gave Iron Jaw a piece of
lemon to suck. He poured cold water down
his back, and said slowly: “ Watch his right,
it’s the one to zip you.”
  No word was ever said to the Gatlin’
Gun in his corner during a fight. He would
not allow it. As well interrupt a Napoleon
poring over the plan of a battle. The gong
rang for the second round.
  Iron Jaw rushed from his corner swinging
a wild haymaker that missed. The Gatlin’
Gun’s gloves played a rat-a-tat-tat on his
face before he gained his balance. He tied
Iron Jaw into knots with his marvelous
feinting. He then rattled blows in rapid
succession against his opponent.
  Iron Jaw bent his head low, like a man
caught in a hailstorm who does not wish his
face cut to pieces. He wisely decided not
to look at the Gatlin’ Gun’s eyes. Danger
lay there, curled like a rattler. Iron Jaw
suddenly worked in close and ripped his
right hand downward on the muscle cov-
ered kidneys of the Gatlin’ Gun. The
round had been a fierce encounter from the
start, with always Iron Jaw keeping his head
down. When the gong rang the fighters
dropped soggy gloves to their sides and
went to their corners.
  A stamping and cheering started. It did
not completely die down until die gong
sounded for the third round.
  With the suddenness of a bullet shot out
of a gun Iron Jaw’s antagonist rushed from
his comer. The crowd stood up as he
planted six vicious triphammer blows on
Iron Jaw’s scar. He went down like an ox
felled with an ax. Terrific screaming fol-
lowed, and a hush followed as quickly after.
Iron Jaw was on his feet without taking a
count. The astonished Gatlin’ Gun stared
at him as he rushed forward.

THE GLASS JAW.

  As Iron Jaw whipped four blows to the
Gatlin’ Gun’s face, Teddy Ray looked seri-
ous. His face relaxed as his man drove
Iron Jaw halfway across the ring with a
left to the heart. He was after him like a
flash. Iron Jaw Bolan stood, instinctively
knowing that a storm was headed his way.
It came in gales of whirling blows. He
pinned his left jaw to his breast and fought
back on even terms until he stepped into a
short left jolt to the chin, and he folded
over toward the Gatlin’ Gun with his head
down. The back of his neck exposed, the
Gatlin’ Gun whipped a murderous right
downward and it crashed solidly on Iron
Jaw’s neck. The latter’s face went livid
with rage. The crowd hooted. Iron Jaw
became a madman while pain jabbed
needles in his brain.
  “ Ouh!” he screamed. His brother held
the rope as though he would squeeze it in
two. Iron Jaw bellowed again as another
blow followed the first. Then he wrenched
his body away, and balanced himself for
the briefest of seconds and rushed at the
Gatlin’ Gun. No living man could have
stopped him. Few could have stood before
him. One hundred and seventy pounds of
hurtling bone and muscle he was, driven
with the fury and pain of a titanic passion.
  He rushed against the ropes as the Gatlin’
Gun sidestepped. With bleeding face, he
turned quickly and rushed again at the
Gatlin’ Gun. Relentless, he tore after him,
now crouching, now with a terrible swaying
motion of his body, his arms throwing so
many blows that the Gatlin’ Gui? was
forced to block and quit fighting for a mo-
ment.
  The Gatlin’ Gun measured him after a
lime and stepped in close. He ripped a
catapault left to Iron Jaw’s chin. His head
went backward in time to expose his left
jaw completely to a horrible right that
followed. His knees shook like posts struck
by lightning, then he crashed to the floor
and rolled over and over. The referee
followed, counting the while.
  Blood dripping from his macerated lips,
the back of his neck raw, his sides oozing
red fluid—the undaunted owner of the glass
jaw rose at the count of seven. “ I’ll kill
you, damn you!” he groaned.
   6	A
  The good looking master of boxing and
brawn said tersely: “ Shut up and fight.”
  “ I am—damn you!” screamed Iron Jaw
Bolan. Just then the Gatlin’ Gun stepped
in and delivered blows with masterful pre-
cision. The fourth round ended.
  When the Gatlin’ Gun went to his cor-
ner, Teddy Ray said: “ Finish him quick;
the train leaves in a little while.”
  “ I’ll sure get him this round,” was the
retort.
  Jack Bolan mumbled into the ears of his
younger brother. “ He cain’t lick you,
Pearl. He ain’t man enough. He flops
you down, but you bounce up like rubber.”
  The noise lulled into silence when the
fifth round started. Quickly the men toed
the scratch. Arms flying like iron weights
fastened to a revolving wheel. Iron Jaw
stepped in and looked up.
  “ Don’t look at ’im,” shouted Jack; and
his head dropped in time to get away from
an uppercut aimed at his chin. The Gat-
lin’ Gun’s jaw was set; his lamblike ex-
pression gone. His teeth grated. He boxed
with the art and speed of the master that
he was. With the accuracy of perfectly
aimed gunfire he shot lefts and rights to all
points of Iron Jaw’s face and body. As
the latter went to his knees the fur}' of the
Gatlin’ Gun’s rush made him hurtle over
him.
  Iron Jaw rose and whirled into the storm
of battle, the pace of which was set by a
world’s champion. He went down and rose.
He went down again.
  “ He’s done,” murmured a man in the
first row. “ The Gatlin’ Gun wins.”
  But the Gatlin’ Gun was not the winner.
Not yet. Iron Jaw rose and steadied him-
self.
  “ Make him rush, Pearl!” shouted Jack
Bolan.
  The Gatlin’ Gun sneered—and rushed.
Suddenly, Iron Jaw shot a left that trav-
eled with lightning speed the distance of
six inches. The power of a mule’s kick
was behind it. The Gatlin’ Gun staggered
backward, the fierce Iron Jaw after him.
A swishing right and left sizzled over the
master’s guard, and he sank in a corner.
There was never such a screaming before.
.The Gatlin’ Gun had been knocked down.
242
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
The referee counted. “ One—two—three—
four ”—silence sank like lead in water—
“ five—six ”—the champion rolled over, a
tired tiger—“ seven—eight ”—he rose to
his elbow—■“ nine ”—he stood erect; the
gong ended the round.
  An engine whistle shrieked. Neither
manager nor Gatlin’ Gun heard it. Their
minds were on other and more important
things.
  Jack Bolan hugged his glass jawed
brother. Cheers rolled over the audience,
interspersed with handclapping.
  A voice in a tone of admirable derision
yelled: “ Pearl—Pearl—little Pearl.” Iron
Jaw did not hear. He stretched back on his
chair, his big breast heaving mightily, while
Jack rubbed caustic over his bleeding
wounds. The last round had thrilled the
stolid brothers.
  “ I wish ma and pa could see you now,
Pearl,” said Jack, choking back the nearest
■he had ever come to a sob in his life.
  The Gatlin’ Gun leaned back in his chair,
an egglike lump on his handsome jaw. Two
towels were swung in front of him in zigzag
fashion, while Teddy Ray rubbed his hand-
some body. No word was said. Teddy
Ray, like a man who had witnessed an exe-
cution, was nervous. The Gatlin’ Gun’s
face was set, and the lines ran from the
corners of his eyes like little skin ditches
dug with a razor blade.
  “ You’ll cop him this round, Gatlin’,
an’ we’ll breeze outta here on that train
like the wind.” Just then a whistle shrieked.
“ We got twenty minutes yet,” resumed
Teddy.
  All noise had subsided. The gong boomed
like the echo of a bell in a tomb. The
lighters rose. With muscles taut for a sec-
ond, each man surveyed the other. They
then walked slowly forward, in the manner
of men who carry bombs in each hand.
Every fighting cell in their brains was alert.
The Gatlin’ Gun walked close, and feinted
with his eyes, manipulating his gloves with
dazzling speed the while. Iron Jaw was
confused, and jerked his head upward.
The Gatlin’ Gun’s left crashed through, but
Iron Jaw’s chin was down before it landed.
It caught him on the bleeding forehead.
The right followed after and whizzed across
the top of his left ear. It stung like electric
needles.
  Maddened to desperation, Iron Jaw
whaled in close and kept his glove pounding
furiously. But he was not alone at the
pounding. Flashing blow after flashing
blow followed, and then the Gatlin’ Gun
fell into a clinch. Falling out of it, he
rammed a right and left to Iron Jew’s
face. The latter worked in and clinched.
His huge bearlike arm worked around and
pounded the Gatlin’ Gun’s back as with
a heavy bludgeon. In fierce retaliation, the
Gatlin’ Gun sledged the top of Iron Jaw’s
neck with rabbit blows, called thus for the
reason that it is the way rabbits are killed.
  Through battered lips Iron Jaw hissed:
“ I ain’t a rabbit.” The words were no
sooner spoken than a look of madness came
over the Gatlin’ Gun. The rough, unshaven
face of Iron Jaw leered at him. He forgot
that he was the mental master of the man
who held him as a bear does a victim.
He tore himself loose with magnificent fury.
His arms began to work like tremendous
w’hite and red flails under control of the
lightning. His gloves were heavy with
blood and water. The squishy impact of
them could be heard a dozen rows from the
ringside.
  Iron Jaw Bolan stood up under the with-
ering attack and leered. His brother Jack
yelled: “ He cain’t lick you, Pearl.” The
words taunted the Gatlin’ Gun. He rushed
madly at Iron Jaw, who fell backward
against the ropes.
  They struggled fiercely, and it was now
the Gatlin’ Gun who leaned against the
ropes, fighting madly. The long whistle of
an engine could be heard above the whir of
battle.
  The men worked out of one clinch and
rushed madly into another. Four rights
followed in thudding impact on Iron Jaw’s
scar. Science and ringcraft were blotted
out.
  “ Come on an’ fight!” snapped the Gat-
lin’ Gun.
  “ Come on yourself!” was the rejoinder.
  Hands low, heads together, they slugged.
Their knees sagged and became stiff again.
They backed away, and Iron Jaw missed
two smashes that unbalanced him. The
THE GLASS JAW.
243
Gatlin’ Gun stepped in. Iron Jaw slugged
him away. The Gatlin’ Gun shot a left
that knocked Iron Jaw reeling against the
back curtain. He sank quickly to the floor.
Iron Jaw rose, swinging his arms wildly.
“ He wants to watch now,” said a man
near the ring, “ or the Gatlin’ ’11 knock him
colder’n a snowball.”
  A wild right swing—a miss—a counter
by the Gatlin’ Gun—and Iron Jaw’s head
hit the floor with a thud. He rose again
suddenly. They fought to the center of the
ring. The Gatlin’ Gun shifted to long range
boxing once more, and Iron Jaw danced
about him as if anxious for an opening at
infighting.
  “ I wish it was over; we’ll miss the darn
train sure,” thought Teddy Ray; then, as
a terrific blow landed: “ He’s got him.”
But not yet. Iron Jaw ripped both
gloves to the body. They lifted his antago-
nist from the floor. In a quick come-
back he was himself staggered by a jolt
to the scarred jaw. Four gloved hands
crossed each other in the fury of the fight-
ing that followed. Darkness came. A dyna-
mo was changed at the electric plant, and
the lights suddenly went out for a few sec-
onds. They no sooner went on again than
the men were at each other with renewed
fury. Heads rocked with punches as one
after the other held the upper hand.
  Punch after punch was delivered amid
wild cheering. Then a silence fell. Next
a cheering. Iron Jaw was down. He rose.
Then Gatlin’ Gun was down. He rose,
shaking his head.
  They clinched until their bodies seemed
chained together. Suddenly a right jolt
shot upward. A body sagged downward
and fell face foremost on the floor and
rolled over three times. The referee count-
ed. The Gatlin’ Gun was out. Excitement
ruled.
  Jack Bolan hugged his brother. Their
eyes glistened. The ring was full of
people.
  The Gatlin’ Gun sat in his corner for
many minutes. A doctor was called.
  “ You see,” said the man of medicine,
“ the German bullet must have torn away
the nerve in Bolan’s jaw that connected
with the brain. It’s not how hard you hit
a man’s jaw. You must hit it in a vital
spot. That was a lucky bullet for him.”
  “ Well,” said Teddy Ray, as if anxious
to get the Gatlin’ Gun’s mind off serious
things, “ the train’s gone.”
  “ So’s the two thousand,” was the Gatlin’
Gun’s rejoinder, “ and the championship.”
ON THE HEIGHTS
 THIS is no day for tears.
     The glorious mountains, sane and high,
 Rest in unbroken calm upon the crest of earth,
 Impregnable, serene.
 The sun stoops down to kiss their fringe of pine trees,
 Green and sweet perfumed with God’s own nectar,
 Unmoved by earthly cares and unperturbed by grief.
 Why, then, should we despair?
 Are we not worthy to be part
 Of God’s great scheme of beauty?
 Or must we, grieving, ever contemplate
 The everlasting failure to perfect
 The pattern given us to weave,
 With threads all tangled by our ignorance?

WHAT HAS OCCURRED IN PARTS I and II.
EX-ROUNDSMAN McCARTY discovers that a man he has seen fall dead in the street has
been poisoned. He and his old friend, Denny Riordan, investigate and learn that the mur-
dered man is Alfred Hughes, valet to Henry Orbit, one of the wealthy residents of a block
with gates at either end, adjoining the park, known as New Queen's Mall. Inspector Druet, of
the police, joins in the investigation.
    Neither Orbit, nor his neighbors, the Sloanes and Goddards, shed any light on the poisoning.
McCarty learns from little Fu Moy, nephew of Ching Lee, Orbit’s Chinese butler, that Lee and
Hughes were enemies and also that there had been a slight fire in Orbit’s bedroom. It develops
that the valet was a bully, drunkard, and trifler with women, and therefore had other enemies.
Several days after the murder, Trafford, tutor of young Horace Goddard, interrupts McCarty and
Denny while they are interviewing Orbit to inquire whether Horace has been seen. Later it
develops that Horace has disappeared.
CHAPTER IX.
IN THIN AIR.
“y^LAD you could come at once, Mc-
(j Carty.” Eustace Goddard’s round,
ruddy face was sagging and pale,
and the humorous quirk beneath the ends
of the small, sandy mustache had given
place to a tremulous droop. “ Your in-
spector thought I had some information
for you about that valet’s death when I
telephoned headquarters to ask for your
address, and I didn’t undeceive him. Don’t
want any notoriety about this while a shad-
7711* story began in the Argosy -
ow of doubt remains, but, God—I—I’m
afraid!”
    “ You’ll recall Special Deputy Riordan
  from that first talk we had at Orbit’s?”
  McCarty indicated his colleague, who stood
  speechless with tense interest in the door-
  way. “ You told me over the phone that
  your boy had been kidnaped. He’s pretty
  big for that, ain’t he—and in broad day?”
  “ What else can we think?” Goddard
  threw out his short, pudgy arms in a help-
  less gesture. “ Horry vanished in thin air
  this afternoon. He hadn’t any idea of going
  out; in fact, he complained of a headache

after iunch—he has never been very strong
—and his mother left him curled up on the
couch in the library here with his sketch
book when she went shopping. She re-
turned late to dress for Orbit’s musicale,
and I didn’t inquire for him, supposing him
to be with Trafford, his tutor. I reached
home from the club about half past five,
and found Trafford very much disturbed.
But here he is. He’ll tell you himself.
Mr. Trafford, these are the men for whom
I sent. Will you tell them when you first
missed Horry?”
  The thin, anxious looking, bespectacled
young man whom they had seen in conver-
sation with the watchman that afternoon
came slowly forward.
  “ I went to the library at three to tell
him it was time for his Latin lesson,” he
began, his voice dazed and shaken. “ He
wasn’t there, and I searched the house for
him, surprised that he should have gone out
without mentioning it. Then it occurred
to me that he might have slipped over to
Mr. Orbit’s house next door, where there is
an exceptionally fine collection of paintings
which fascinate him. His ruling ambition
is to become an artist, and Mr. Orbit has
encouraged him. But I digress. I went
there to inquire for him, but no one had
seen him, and then, really anxious, I ques-
tioned the watchman, who assured me that
he had not gone out either gate.”
  “ H-m!” remarked McCarty, as Dennis
shuffled his feet uneasily. “ And what did
you do after that, Mr. Trafford?”
  “ I concluded that Horace had gone to
see the artist who has been instructing him
in drawing and of whom he is very fond.
I could think of nothing else that would
account for his disappearance, but it seemed
probable some neighbor with a key to the
Mall had entered just as he left, so that
the watchman need not have been called
upon to open the gate for him.”
  The young man’s hands were clenching
and unclenching nervously, and beads of
moisture stood out upon his forehead. “ I
therefore didn’t mention it to Mrs. Goddard
before she went to the musicale, but waited,
believing Horace would return at any mo-
ment. When the afternoon grew late I
searched the house again, questioned the
servants, even went across the street to
inquire at the Sloane house for him. Young
Mr. Sloane has taken an interest also in
his artistic efforts, and it is the only other
house on the block he is privileged to visit
by himself, since the Burminsters are still
away. I—I met with no success. If I had
only given the alarm earlier!”
  He was turning away with a groan when
McCarty asked:
  “ Why didn’t you think to phone Blais-
dell and ask if the lad had been there. Traf-
ford?”
  The wretched tutor stared, and Goddard,
who had been standing with his elbows on
the mantel and his head in his hands, sud-
denly wheeled.
  “ How did you know Blaisdell is the art-
ist who has been giving him lessons?” he
demanded.
  McCarty smiled.
  “ I heard him say himself that Blaisdell
was going on a sketching tour next month
and would take him, only you wouldn’t hear
of it,” he explained. “ The boy was wild to
go along—”
  “ Mr. Blaisdell started yesterday,” the
tutor interrupted. “ I learned this when I
telephoned to his studio this afternoon, as
I did as soon as the idea occurred to me
that Horace might have gone there. I for-
got to mention it, but my anxiety— I feel
criminally negligent in having taken the sit-
uation so easily.”
  “ Don’t the boy ever get a chance to play
with other lads?” Dennis spoke for the first
time, his tone filled with pitying contempt.
“ Couldn’t he have gone to the park and
then home to supper with one or another of
them?”
  “ My son does not play in the park.”
Goddard responded with dignity. " He
rides there with a select class from the
academy on two mornings of the week,
but the season does not reopen until next
month. Horace is delicate, as I told you,
and has never cared for rough physical ex-
ercise, although he is far from being a
mollycoddle. He has a few friends of his
own age, but they are all still at their
country homes; Mr. Trafford and I have
telephoned to every one we can think of.
Mrs. Goddard is prostrated and under the

care of her physician; when she returned
from Orbit’s musicale and learned of Hor-
ace’s disappearance she was almost beside
herself, for he is our only child. If any-
thing has happened to him—”
  He ran his hand violently through his
scanty fringe of hair; and McCarty ob-
served:
   “ ’Tis queer the lad didn’t tell you him-
self that Blaisdell was going away yester-
day.”
  “ He hasn’t talked of him very much
lately.” Goddard hesitated, and then went
on: “ Horace is an unusual boy—very sen-
sitive and reserved. I don’t pretend to un-
derstand him; it’s what his mother calls the
artistic temperament, I suppose. He took
it very much to heart when we declined to
allow him to go on this sketching tour, but
of course it was out of the question. No
one but an artist would have suggested such
an impractical thing for a boy of his age,
and with his frail constitution. Damn that
dog! He’ll drive me out of my mind!”
  A doleful, long drawn howl, subdued but
eloquent, reached their ears from below
stairs; and McCarty remembered his brief
talk with the boy in that very room three
days before.
  “ Is that Max, the police dog your son
was telling me about when I called here?”
“ Yes. He wandered around, whining,
until I couldn’t stand it any longer and had
him shut up. Devilish clever animal and
devoted to Horace—knows there’s some-
thing wrong! By God, hear that! Mid-
night! What can have happened to my
boy?”
   He dropped into a chair, burying his face
in his hands as the clock struck; and once
more Dennis spoke.
  “ Have you any notion how much pocket
money the lad had this day?”
.. It was Trafford who replied to him.
  “ Six dollars and seventy-five cents. I
am teaching him to keep a budget, and he
carefully puts down whatever he spends
each day.”
   “ Little and red headed, wasn’t he, with
a narrow chest and spindling legs—”
  “ Riordan means is he small for his age
and kind of delicate looking?” McCarty
amended hastily, glaring at the tactless in-
terrogator. “ How was he dressed when
you last saw him, and what’s missing from
his things?”
  “ He wore a brown pedestrian suit and
brown shoes and golf stockings,” the tutor
answered. “ He had a plain platinum wrist
watch on a leather strap, and a gold seal
ring with the family coat of arms, but noth-
ing else is missing except a brown cloth cap
with the manufacturer’s name, ‘ Knowles,’
inside. Before communicating with you
Mr. Goddard and I telephoned to every
hospital in the city, fearing that some street
accident might have occurred, but no child
whose appearance tallied in the least de-
gree with his had been brought in. The
only remaining possibility is that he is being
detained somewhere for a ransom.”
  “ Have you any other reason for think-
ing the lad may have been kidnaped?”
McCarty turned to Goddard. “ Know of
anybody with a grudge against you or your
family? Had any threatening letters?”
  “ Great heavens, no!” The bereaved fa-
ther raised his head. “ Horry is a little
chap for fourteen, looks nearer twelve, in
fact, and Mr. Trafford usually accompanies
him when he leaves the Mall; but he begged
so hard to go to Blaisdell’s studio by him-
self that I allowed it, though it was against
his mother’s wishes. I wanted him to be
manly and self-reliant—and the Madison
Avenue cars pass Blaisdell’s door near Fif-
tieth. I thought it was perfectly safe, but
he may have been watched and marked by
some member of the criminal class as a vic-
tim for kidnaping.”
  “ That don’t explain how or why he
passed out of one gate or the other with
not one on the whole block seeing him.”
McCarty shook his head. “ You say you’re
wishful to avoid notoriety, or I’d advise
you to report the lad’s disappearance to the
Bureau of Missing Persons and let the in-
vestigation take its regular course, but there
is a chance still that he’s not been kid-
naped nor yet met with an accident. ’Twas
for Riordan and me to try to locate him
and get him back without having the news-
papers getting out extras that you sent for
me to-night?”
  Dennis caught his breath audibly at this
irregular supposition; but Goddard nodded.
ANNIHILATION.
247
  “ That’s it, exactly! It would kill Mrs.
Goddard to have the press make a sensa-
tional case of this while there is the slight-
est hope that Horace may be restored to us
without publicity. You’ll do what you can?
I’ll pay anything, a fortune, to have my son
again, safe!”
  “ We’ll do our best, Mr. Goddard.” Mc-
Carty rose. “ If we’ve no news for you
by morning, can we have a word with Mrs.
Goddard then?”
  “ Of course. I’d take you to her now,
but the doctor has given her something to
quiet her. The servants don’t know any-
thing; I’ve questioned them till I’m hoarse
and been in touch with every one to whom
Horry might have gone. For God’s sake,
find my boy!”
  Young Trafford showed them out, and
McCarty glanced keenly into his pale,
troubled face as he held the door open. He
seemed on the point of speech, but glanced
back over his shoulder and then resolutely
closed his lips.
  McCarty paused.
  “ Before we come in the morning, you'd
do well to tell the lad’s father to come
clean with us,” he admonished in a low-
ered tone. “ ’Tis not by keeping anything
back that he’ll help.”
  Trafford started.
  “ Do you think he is?” he countered
quickly. “ I’ve told you all I know, at any
rate, but let me hear if there’s anything
more I can do. I’ll sit up all night by the
telephone.”
  “ Where are we going now?” Dennis
asked as his companion turned toward the
east gate. “ ’Twas to find who killed
Hughes that the inspector made deputies
of us, not to be chasing runaway kids; but
I'm trailing right with you.”
  “ Runaway, is it? I thought that was
your hunch when you asked what pocket
money the lad had and then described him
with more truth than politeness!” Mc-
Carty chuckled. “ You think he’s gone to
join this artist fellow Blaisdell? ’Twill be
easy to settle that when we find out where
that tour was to commence, for Horace
could not have gone far on six seventy-
five.”
  “ And we know how he got out all right,”
Dennis supplemented. “ ’Twas by that east
gate ahead when Bill left it open so con-
venient. Look at Orbit’s house! Do you
suppose his afternoon party is lasting on
through the night?”
  The awning and carpet were still
stretched from entrance door to curb,
and, seemingly borne upon the subdued
radiance of the glow which filtered through
the curtained windows of the conservatory,
there came to them faintly the strains of
the organ. It was no majestic harmony
this time, however, but a simple, insistently
repetitive measure, and McCarty paused to
listen, shaking his head.
  “ Orbit’s by himself, and just kind of
thinking through the organ, can’t you tell,
the way he’s just wandering along, amusing
himself? That’s an easy little tune, too,
that would stick in your head. Come on.
I’ve a notion to see a part of this Mall we’ve
not thought to examine yet.”
  “ If there’s a foot of it we’ve never been
over, barring the insides of the other
houses—” began Dennis in obvious disap-
pointment. “ I thought we’d be getting
after whoever takes care of Blaisdell’s place
to find where he’s gone—”
  “ At this time of night?” snorted Mc-
Carty. “ Has it come to you that God-
dard may not be so far wrong at that,
especially if he’s got some reason he hasn’t
told for thinking the lad was stolen? I’m
beginning to see the practical workings of
those books of mine you turn your nose up
at, and I ask you: Did Horace look to have
nerve enough to run away? If he went out-
side these gates, it was of his own free
will, of course, and during the time Bill
left the one of them open; but what if he’d
been paid to do it? What if the lad had
been decoyed outside? How do we know
there’s not others on the block concerned
in it?”
  “ Others on the block?” repeated Dennis,
stopping short as they passed the dark Bel-
lamy house. “ Mac, you’re not thinking
there could be any connection between what
happened to Hughes four days ago and the
Goddard kid’s disappearance! You’re not
looking to have him found dead somewhere,
poisoned! Glory be! What’s come to this
street all of a sudden?
248
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  “ I'm asking myself that,” returned the
other grimly. “ I’m going no further in
my mind, though, just saying it looks fun-
ny—that’s all. Here’s a handful of rich
families living behind their gates in peace
and seclusion for generations, with nothing
ever happening except maybe a funeral now
and then, for they could not shut out death.
Then a murder takes place right in their
midst, even if the victim did go far before
he dropped in his tracks; and while there’s
still no answer to it somebody in the next
house disappears.”
  “ So that’s why you hinted at notoriety
if Goddard took the case to headquarters
instead of leaving it to us! We’re still on
the Hughes affair, after all!” exclaimed
Dennis, adding: “ What’s down here?”
  McCarty had turned down the black pas-
sage or court between Mrs. Bellamy’s and
the closed Falkingham house next door on
the east, and he vouchsafed no response
to the companion who followed curiously
at his heels until they had reached the
rear of the boarded-up residence. Then he
whispered cautiously:
  “ Got your flash light?”
  For answer Dennis produced the pocket
electric torch, without which he seldom
went on a nocturnal adventure with Mc-
Carty. Pressing the button, McCarty
darted a minute but piercing ray of
light along the rear of the houses whose
front sidewalks they had just traversed.
  “ See that, Denny?” he whispered. “ An
open court as clear as the palm of your
hand straight past the Bellamy’s and Orbit’s
to Goddard’s on the corner. If the kid had
wanted to get out without being seen he
might have left the back of his house and
come along this court to any of the pas-
sageways that lead out to the sidewalk
nearer the gate.”
  “ True for you,” Dennis assented. “ Turn
the light along the back wall till we see
how high it is, and whether there are any
little doors in it or not.”
  But the wall, not of brick, but of ancient
brownstone, was as high as the city’s regu-
lations permitted, blank and bare save in
the rear of Orbit’s miniature palace where
it was covered by a thick, impenetrable
curtain of ivy, sable and glossylike black
satin in the moving finger of light.
  All at once heavy footsteps pounded
along the sidewalk to the mouth of the pas-
sageway they had just left and a brighter
beam was trained suddenly upon them.
Dennis dodged instinctively, but McCarty
turned and faced it, calling cautiously:
  “ Is it you, Dave Hollis? We’ve not
gone yet, just taking a look around.”
They had encountered the night watch-
man when they let themselves in at the west
gate earlier in response to Eustace God-
dard’s summons and now he merely grunted
in acknowledgment and passed on.
   “ There’s nothing more to be seen here,”
Dennis remarked. “ No one could cross
that wall without a ladder and though they
might climb that ivy it could not be done
carrying a boy the size of Horace.”
  “ To say nothing of it being broad day
and the back windows of all the houses in
this row looking out at the performance,”
McCarty interjected. “ All the same, we’ll
stroll along to the Goddards’ kitchen door
and back, Denny.”
  The rear of Mrs. Bellamy’s mansion was
as dark as the front and in Orbit’s also the
lights had by now been extinguished. In
the dead stillness their stealthy footsteps
seemed to ring unnaturally loud to their
own ears. Only in the Goddard house did
the dull glow from roof to cellar gleam forth
through shrouded windows like sleepless,
anxious eyes.
   “ ’Tis almost unhealthy, the cleanness of
everything!” Dennis looked about him as
the flashlight circled over the spacious, im-
maculate court. “ Not an ash can nor so
much as a garbage pail that a cat could
hide behind! We’re wasting our time here,
Mac!”
  But McCarty did not answer. He had
gone halfway down the tradesmen’s passage
leading to the sidewalk and paused before a
door in the side wall of the Goddard house.
Dennis saw the light play in narrowing
arcs over the paved ground before it and
then settle to a mere pinpoint as McCarty
stooped. After a moment he straightened
and came swiftly back, cat-footed despite
his bulk. He was holding out some small
object in his extended hand and as he

reached his companion’s side he played the
light upon it; a small, plain platinum watch,
crushed beyond repair, on a pathetically
short leather wristband.
CHAPTER X.
THE MAN IN THE SHADOWS.
THE cold, early light of a clouded morn-
ing found McCarty and Dennis seated
over pancakes and coffee in an all
night restaurant on Sixth Avenue not far
from Fiftieth Street. The intervening hours
since they left the New Queen’s Mall had
been fruitlessly spent in a weary round of
the ferries and railroad terminals in search
of news of a small, solitary traveler. Now
they had just come from an interview with
the superintendent of the palatial studio
apartment building in which the artist
Blaisdell resided.
  “ I always thought those painter guys
lived in garrets with never a square meal
nor a second shirt.” Dennis spoke in a
slightly dazed tone. “ I mind that day
watchman, Bill, said young Horace told him
Blaisdell was one of the greatest in the
country, but he must have some regular
business to be able to live in a place like
that! There’s one thing sure; no matter
how much of a fancy he’d took to the kid
he could afford to get into no trouble by
taking him on a tour without his father and
mother being willing, and if the boy showed
up he’d bring him back. Where is it again
that he’s gone sketching?”
  “ Up in the She-wan-gunk Mountains.”
McCarty pronounced the name with pains-
taking care. “ Ellenville is his headquar-
ters, the superintendent said, if you remem-
ber; the Detw'eiler House. Granting there
was a train, and the lad had more money
with him than that four-eyed tutor suspect-
ed, he could have got there by early eve-
ning, but no word of any kind had come
when I phoned the Goddard house an hour
ago.”
  “ I know.” Dennis drained his cup and
held it out to the sleepy waiter to be re-
filled. “ ’Tis too bad you did not tell Traf-
ford about finding the watch.”
“ And send him into hysterics? He’s as
bad as a woman now! ” McCarty shrugged.
“ The doctor ’d give orders Mrs. Goddard
wasn’t to be woke up till eight, but we’ll
chance it by seven. How' do you feel,
Denny?”
  Dennis eyed the questioner with swift
suspicion.
  “ There’s nothing the matter with me that
I know of!”
  “ ’Tis a pity!” McCarty commented cal-
lously. “ I was thinking if you called up
the lieutenant at the engine house and told
him how sick you were he’d maybe let you
off duty the day. There’s a phone over
on the cigar counter.”
  “ And what’s ailing me?” Dennis’s eyes
sparkled, but his tone was flat, for his in-
ventive faculties were at low ebb in the early
morning.
  “ From what I’ve learned lately, Denny,
about mental defectives—”
  But Dennis had risen, and stalking to the
counter he took up the phone. Presently
McCarty heard his voice raised in a harrow-
ing description of pain, but it was abruptly
cut short and after listening for a moment
with a dazed look on his face he silently
replaced the receiver and returned to his
chair.
  “Well?” demanded McCarty expect-
antly.
   “ Mike’s out of the hospital and he’ll take
my nine to six shift.”
  “ But just what did the lieutenant say
to you?”
  “ He told me,” Dennis replied very slowly
and distinctly, “ to get the hell off the
phone, for I’d be no good at a false alarm
while my crook chasing side kick McCarty
was on the job again. I gathered from a
few' more remarks before he hung up on
me that your friend Jimmie Ballard of the
Bulletin has been nosing around the engine
house to get dope from me about what
you’re pulling off, and by that same token
running the lieutenant ragged. ’Tis what I
get for associating with you.”
  It was McCarty’s turn to eye his com-
panion suspiciously, but Dennis’s stolid
countenance was quite devoid of humor
and he retorted:
  “ Is that so? Well, we’d better be as-
sociating ourselves with the Goddards again

now or there'll be no news for Jimmie or
the inspector either, which is worse. Come
on.”
  “ Unless the boy is found as Hughes
was,” Dennis suggested optimistically. “ It
would let the Lindholms out, but who ex-
cept a lunatic would be poisoning children
and servants, promiscuouslike?”
  McCarty’s reply wras a stare and a grunt
which the other construed as derisive, and
he lapsed into aggrieved silence as they
made their way once more to the gates be-
hind which so much of mystery and menace
brooded.
  Trafford opened the door almost before
the bell had ceased to echo through the
house, and his haggard face was mute evi-
dence that the suspense had not been lifted.
  “ Have you—” He could not voice the
rest of the question; but McCarty replied
briskly:
  “ We’ve several possibilities, Trafford,
and we’re following every last one of them
up. No news is good news just now. Is
Mrs. Goddard awake yet, do you know?”
  “ Her maid told me w^hen I inquired a
few minutes ago that she was stirring. I’ll
go and see.” The young tutor turned dis-
piritedly away. “ You’ll find Mr. Goddard
in the smoking room at the rear on the
avenue side.”
  In dimensions and ponderous style of fur-
nishing the smoking room resembled* a club
lounge rather than a private apartment and
it was a full minute before they decried
Eustace Goddard’s rotund figure relaxed in
the depths of a huge leather armchair. He
was apparently asleep, but on their ap-
proach he opened widely staring eyes upon
them and sprang up with an inarticulate
cry.
  “ We’ve not located your son yet, Mr.
Goddard.” McCarty spoke quickly before
the father could frame words. “ We know
what even7 minute means to you and ’tis
for that we’re going to bring the inspector
and some of his other men into it. I can
promise you there’ll be no publicity through
us.”
  “ By God, McCarty, they can blazon it
in every paper in the land if it will bring our
boy back to us!” Goddard cried brokenly.
“ The living horror of this night has made
everything else fade into insignificance!
You mean you—you’ve failed?”
  “ Not exactly, sir, but there are only the
two of us now, and ’twill save time if others
take up some of the clews we’ve got,” Mc-
Carty explained.
  “ There’s the telephone.” Goddard
waved a shaking hand toward a stand half
concealed behind a lacquered screen. “ Get
the whole department if you need it! I’ll
offer any reward you suggest—fifty thou-
sand? A hundred?”
  “ Wee’ll settle that when the inspector
comes.” McCarty moved to the screen and
took up the receiver, and Dennis cleared
his throat.
  “ How many doors are there to this
house?”
  “ Four!” Goddard replied in a surprised
tone. “ The one at the front, two at the
rear—kitchen and tradesmen’s entrances—
and a smaller door at the side opening on
the court that runs between this house and
Orbit’s. But why do you ask? What are
the clews you’ve found?”
  Dennis coughed discreetly, and from be-
hind the screen came McCarty’s voice.
  “ Is it yourself, inspector? Yes, me, Mc-
Carty. No, at Goddard’s and you’re need-
ed. Wait a bit! Can you lay hands on
both Martin and Yost? Can’t talk now,
sir. Get me? All right, bring Martin
along, but send Yost over to—to Bill, 0565.
That’s it. Maybe and maybe not. Sure,
I’ve been in touch with Bill and he knows
the party I’m looking for. Tell Yost to
phone if anything turns up. Of course not,
inspector, till you take it in hand! ’By.”
The last had been straight blarney, but
Dennis shivered as the receiver clicked on
its hook. Well he knew that telephone
number and the grim little house far over
toward the river where for a brief interval
the bluff, kindly Bill harbored the city’s
unknown dead! Had the sickly little God-
dard heir after all gone the way of Hughes?
  “ Why did you ask about the doors?”
The conversation had evidently held only
its obvious meaning for the man before
them. “ Horace must have been induced
in some way to leave the house, for no one
could have entered with Trafford and all
the servants about!”
ANNIHILATION.
251
  " He did leave, and by the side door.”
McCarty held out the shattered little wrist
watch. “ Does this belong to the lad?”
  “ Good God, yes! He wore it yester-
day ! ” Goddard seized it and then sank into
his chair. “It’s—smashed! He must have
been handled brutally, perhaps even—”
  “ That don’t follow, sir!” McCarty inter-
rupted. “ The strap slips out of the buckle
easy, for I tried it, and the lad might have
dropped it without noticing. Anybody go-
ing to one of the back doors could have
come along and trod on it after, for ’twas
in the alley right in front of the door that
I found it. And now—”
  “ Mrs. Goddard is awake and ready to see
you now.” Trafford’s voice sounded from
the threshold and Goddard started up once
more.
  “ She knows there is no news?” he asked,
and at the tutor’s nod added: “ Come, then,
but don’t tax her beyond her strength, and
don’t mind any—any wild statements which
she may make. My poor wife is almost out
of her mind!”
  “Of course; we understand.” McCarty
darted a quick glance at Dennis and then
turned to the tutor. “ Trafford, Inspector
Druet and another man are on their way up
from headquarters and you’ll be helping
matters if you tell the both of them what’s
happened and all about them you phoned to
for trace of the lad.”
  In silence they followed Goddard to the
tiny jewel box of an elevator whose velvet
and gold and glittering crystal mirrors made
Dennis gasp. He gasped again when their
guide pressed a button and they shot
abruptly upward, and his weather-beaten
face turned a delicate green as they stopped
with a smooth but sickening swoop at the
second floor.
  He was the first out with the opening of
the door, but there was no time for the
aside which trembled on his lips, for God-
dard led the way down the wide hall to the
doorway in which the gaunt, gray-haired
figure of an elderly maid was silhouetted
against the dim light of the room within.
  “ Eustace!” A woman’s trembling voice
sounded from behind her. “ It can’t be
that nothing is known, nothing! Did you
tell them about that—”
  “ Everything is being done, Clara.” God-
dard motioned the maid aside and McCarty
and Dennis followed him into the dressing
room. They received only a confused im-
pression of mahogany and old rose and tall
mirrors, of a faint, aromatic perfume and
the sound of deep drawn, convulsive breath-
ing.
  The next moment their eyes were caught
and held by the long figure outstretched
upon a chaise longue, imposing even in the
disheveled abandonment of grief. Mrs.
Goddard was a woman well over forty, but
her distraught face still bore traces of the
beauty which must normally have been hers.
There was no touch of gray in the masses
of luxuriant dark hair which the maid had
arranged with evident haste, but that night
had etched lines about the fine eyes and
firm though sensitive mouth that would
never be erased.
  As her husband went on speaking her
glance swept past him to the two who wait-
ed at his elbow.
  “ Everything that is humanly possible is
being done, my dear!” Goddard repeated
more emphatically. “ These are the police
officers I called in, and they want to ask
you a few questions. Do you think you can
collect yourself enough to stick to facts and
not foolish, morbid fancies?”
  “ I am quite collected, Eustace!” There
was a note almost of defiance in Mrs. God-
dard’s tones and she sat up among her pil-
lows with an unconscious dignity in spite
of the emotion which she held in check with
such obvious effort. “ Ask me anything you
please! I—I only want my baby safe once
more!”
  “ Of course, ma’am,” McCarty responded
soothingly. “ You went out and left the
lad on the couch in the library and when
you came back to get ready for the musicale
next door you thought he was with his
teacher. Now, what was the first you knew
of his disappearance?”
  “ When I returned from the musicale. It
was late, after six, and my husband met me
in the hall with the news. He and Mr.
Trafford had been telephoning everywhere'
They thought Horace might have gone to
some of our friends, but he had never done
such a thing as to leave the Mall without

ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
our knowledge and I knew that something
terrible had happened! I could feel it—
here!”
  Her slender, very white hands flew to her
breast. “ I cannot blame Mr. Trafford for
not starting the search for Horace in the
early afternoon; he supposed he had slipped
away to the studio of an artist who has
taken a great fancy to our little boy, but
Mr. Blaisdell is not in town.”
  The forced composure still held her and
only her fluttering hands and quick drawn
breath gave evidence of her supreme agita-
tion.
  “ You don’t think the lad has gone to
join him. do you?” McCarty asked.
  “ Run away, you mean?” Mrs. Goddard
shook her head slowly. “ Oh, no! Horace
would never dream of such a thing! Mr.
Blaisdell wanted to take him, but we would
not hear of it and Horace had no idea of
disobeying our wishes. He has never been
away from us before—before yesterday!”
  “ Then you think he has been kidnaped?”
  At the question Goddard, who had moved
around to the other side of the couch, took
a step forward, the sagging muscles of his
round face tightening as his jaw tensed, but
his wife did not take her eyes from those of
McCarty.
  ‘•He isn't here!” her trembling voice
broke. “ He wouldn't run away! The
earth didn’t open and—and an avalanche
descend upon him! It must have been that
man!”
 “What man!” McCarty and Dennis
spoke in chorus and then Goddard placed
his hand on his wife’s shoulder.
  “Now, Clara!” he admonished. “You
promised—”
    To give us facts, Mr. Goddard!” inter-
rupted McCarty sternly. “ If Mrs. God-
dard can tell us whatever it was you were
holding back last night so much the better!
You phoned to me that the lad had been
kidnaped, but you couldn’t give me any rea-
son for thinking so except that he was gone,
and you didn’t breathe a word about any
* man ’! Will you tell us, ma’am?”
  “There’s nothing to tell!” Goddard in-
sisted obstinately. “ My wife is nervous,
imaginative, and so is Horace. He was
badly frightened by a strange man here in
the Mall a short time ago and his mother
was quite frantic about it. It was some
days before she would allow him to go out
alone again, but personally I think he exag-
gerated—”
  “ Our boy would not tell a falsehood!”
Mrs. Goddard interrupted. “ It was just
at dusk one afternoon about a fortnight
ago, or perhaps less, when Horace had re-
turned alone from Mr. Blaisdell’s studio.
He entered the Mall by the east gate as
usual, but stopped to play with a little
white Persian kitten, the pet of Mrs. Bel-
lamy’s baby. Mrs. Bellamy lives just two
doors away, next to Mr. Orbit’s. The
watchman had passed him and gone on to-
ward the west gate when all at once the
kitten darted across the street and Horace
followed, afraid that it might become lost.
It ran into the open court between the
Parsons’ house and the closed one next door
belonging to the Quentin estate and Horace
was stooping to coax it to him when he was
seized from behind by a strange man and
searched! ”
  “ Searched?” echoed McCarty.
  “ Yes. The man pressed Horace back
against him with one hand over his mouth
and felt in all his pockets with the other,
but he took nothing and never uttered a
word! My little son was too startled to
struggle at first, and all at once the man re-
leased him—and disappeared!”
  “ Did the boy have any money with
him?” inquired Dennis.
  “ Three or four dollars, I believe, but
the man left it untouched.” Mrs. God-
dard’s eyes shifted to those of the ques-
tioner. “ It was quite dark there in that
narrow space between the two houses, but
Horace saw the face which bent down over
his distinctly. He said the man was an
utter stranger who he had never seen in the
Mall before; rough, unshaven and desperate
looking!”
  “ Which way did he go?” McCarty took
up the interrogation once more. “ Was it
down the alley to the street or up in the
open court behind the houses?”
  “ How could the child tell?” Goddard
interjected before his wife could speak. “ It
was almost dark and he was terror-
stricken ! ”
ANNIHILATION.
253
  “ Horace told us that the man ran to-
ward the rear and disappeared in the shad-
ows of a doorway at—at the left.” Mrs.
Goddard replied as though her husband had
not spoken.
   “ At the left, facing the rear of the houses
on the north side of the way?” McCarty
was thinking rapidly aloud. “ That ’11 be
Parsons’s house, then! Why didn’t you
want us to know this, Mr. Goddard?”
  “ Because it can have no possible bear-
ing on the disappearance of our son yester-
day!” Goddard retorted hotly. “He ran
home immediately and told us, and I insti-
tuted a thorough search without delay, but
the watchman could find no trace of the
fellow, and insisted he had admitted no
one that day through either gate who re-
sembled Horace’s description. The Par-
sons’s servants had seen nothing of him,
and he has not reappeared since, although
a strict watch was kept. It is madness to
suppose that Horace left this house of his
own accord to meet the fellow when he
stood in mortal terror of him—”
  “ Not unless he met him accidental like,
and got waylaid a second time!” Dennis
broke in irrepressibly. “ There’s no telling
what he was after if ’twas not money, but
if he was crazy, and the boy put up a bit
of a struggle—”
  “ A-a-ah!” Mrs. Goddard’s taut nerve?
gave way, and she broke into a low, wrailing
cry. “ That is my fear! No sane person
would harm him, but all night long in hor-
rible dreams I have seen him— My baby!
He is hidden somewhere, helpless, suffering,
and I cannot reach him! I shall go mad!
Mad!”
CHAPTER XI.
THE CLOSED HOUSE.
“A FINE mess you made of that!” Mc-
Carty remarked disgustedly when
the door of Mrs. Goddard’s dressing
room had closed behind them, shutting in
her husband and the maid. “ Just when
we were on the point of getting at the truth,
too!”
  “ Truth, is it?” Dennis retorted. “ I
suppose you mean you’d have been finding
out what the crazy guy expected to find in
the boy’s pockets!”
  “No, I know that already!” McCarty
emitted a grim chuckle. “ ’Twill keep,
though, for we’ve got quick work ahead of
us now, and the inspector must have been
waiting this long while.”
  “ You can shoot yourself down in that
gilt birdcage if you’ve a mind to, but my
own legs will carry me!” Dennis eyed the
elevator door, cunningly concealed in the
high oak paneling of the hall, with a hos-
tile glare. Then he added sarcastically:
“ I’ve no doubt but that by the new book
learning you’ve got lately you know who
the guy was. too, and where he came from,
and how he got out, through solid walls and
barred gates! Education is a grand thing,
but where is Horace? Answer me that!”
“ If we’re not able to answer that soon,
Denny, I’m thinking it would be best left
unanswered forever, for the sake of that
woman back there.” McCarty spoke with
deep earnestness. “ There’s a feeling in
me that we’ve something working against us
more than human—something worse than
lightning, or the plague, even! If we could
onlv see our way clear to the black heart
of it!”
  They went down the stairs together, to
find the inspector and Martin awaiting
them with Trafford, who appeared crushed
from the gruelling half hour through which
he had passed.
  McCarty addressed him first, with a mere
nod to his superior.
  “ Trafford, why didn’t you tel! me about
the man who grabbed the lad in the alley
not two weeks ago?”
 “ Mr. Goddard forbade me,” the
wretched young man stammered, then drew
himself up with a vain assumption of dig-
nity. “ Since it has nothing to do with the
case—”
  “We’re the best judge of that!” Mc-
Carty w-aved him away peremptorily.
“ Tell Goddard we’ll see him later. Now,
inspector, before we talk, if you’ll follow
a suggestion of mine just once more, there’s
a train Martin will be after catching, and
he’ll have to hustle to do it.”
  The inspector eyed him keenly for a mo-
ment and then nodded.
254
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  “ Go to it,” he said briefly. “ Get the
instructions, Martin.”
  McCarty drew the young operative aside,
and after a brief interchange of words, the
latter took his departure. Then the in-
spector motioned the other two into the li-
brary and closed the door.
  “ Now I want an explanation of this!”
he announced in a tone which took Mc-
Carty swiftly back to the old days. “ Why
didn’t you report to me at once when you
learned what had happened? What have
you two been doing since? I made you
deputies, but by the Lord I didn’t appoint
you chiefs!”
  McCarty told him in detail of their ac-
tivities during the previous night, and add-
ed frankly:
  “ I didn’t report, inspector, because I
wanted a few hours the start of you, and
that’s the truth. So far I’ve only done
what I think you would have, yourself,
but I’m working from an angle of my own
that you’d not have taken. I’ve sent Mar-
tin just now to Ellenville to find out if this
Blaisdell has heard anything of the lad, but
that’s only routine; the real job is here in
the Mall, even if Horace turns up dead or
alive somewhere else.”
  “ What’s this angle of yours on the
case?” the inspector demanded curtly.
“ What did Goddard forbid that tutor men-
tioning, and why?”
  McCarty described the interview with
Mrs. Goddard and the inspector listened
attentively, asking when he had finished:
  “ What do you propose to do? Put the
screws on Goddard to find out why he kept
that back? He can’t be a party to the
kidnaping of his own son!”
  “ No, but he thinks he knows who the
fellow w!as, and that he’ll hear from him
or them back of him, soon, with a view to
ransom; he’s ready to offer fifty or a hun-
dred thousand reward whenever you give
the word. Until he does hear from him,
though, he can’t be sure what happened
to the lad, and that’s why he’s anxious. His
wife don’t know anything about this pri-
vate opinion of his, of course, and natural-
ly she’s half crazed.”
  McCarty summed up as though his proc-
ess of deduction was equally clear to his
two companions. “ We’ll leave him worry
awhile, for ’tis my opinion he’s mistaken
entirely. I want a look now inside that
empty house next to the Parsonses across
the street, and there’s no time to wait for
red tape to get permission.”
  “ The Quentin house, that’s been closed
all these years?” The inspector looked fix-
edly at him, and Dennis gaped. “ You
think the fellow might have hidden there
after letting the little boy go? Come on,
we’ll take a chance.”
  A huge dark blue limousine of impres-
sive aspect was just drawing up before
No. 7 as they emerged from the Goddard
house and crossed the street, and at sight
of the distinguished, gray-bearded man
who alighted and went up the steps the in-
spector halted with an exclamation.
  “ Do you know who that is, Mac? The
ambassador that the mayor gave the keys
of the city to only yesterday down at City
Hall! If he comes himself to call on the
Parsons, they’re of more importance even
than I thought!”
  “ And ’tis small wonder they don’t
bother to associate with the rest on the
block, millionaires or no,” McCarty com-
mented, eying the equipage with vast re-
spect as they passed. “ You said the old
gentleman was—”
  He paused suddenly, and Dennis’s eyes
followed his to the great entrance doors
which were closing slowly behind the aris-
tocratic back of the ambassador. There
was just a glimpse of a thin, sallow-faced
manservant in black who appeared to sweep
the trio with a curiously penetrating gaze,
and then the scene was shut out.
  McCarty seemed to have lost interest in
the question he was about to ask, and they
went on in silence to the narrow, paved
court between the Parsons residence and
the vast, rambling pile of brownstone next
door.
  “ Let’s go up here and see if the rear is
open for the length of the block, the way
it is on the other side of the street,” Mc-
Carty suggested. “ There’s Parsons’s side
door, the one Horace said the man disap-
peared into; it’s pretty deep, you see, deep
enough for him to have stepped into the
embrasure and been hid in the shadows of
ANNIHILATION.
255
late afternoon without actually going
through the door itself, though I don’t say
he didn’t, at that!”
  “ ’Tis likely a nut that’d go around grab-
bing children and searching their pockets
would be let into the Parsonses!” Dennis
exclaimed in fine scorn. “ Unless the boy
made the whole thing up for a sensation,
the way some kids do, how’d the man get
in and out of the block? The house on
this side looks to be boarded up as tight
as a drum.”
  They reached the rear and found the
open court extending along behind the
houses to be even wider than that on the
south side of the street, the back wall high-
er and devoid of a single vine. The silent
Quentin house presented as blank an as-
pect as from the front, its sealed windows
and barred doors staring like blind eyes in
the sunlight, and the inspector shook his
head.
  “ No one has entered here in months;
years maybe,” he remarked. “ The pad-
locks are so rusted on those board doors
that they would have to be broken, and
the boards themselves are weatherbeaten
and rotting. I’m surprised they’d let the
place get into such a condition, even though
it is in litigation. What are you doing,
Riordan?”
  The house being the corner one, was
built around in an ell on the Madison Ave-
nue side, and in the right angle formed by
its two walls a leader descended from the
roof. Dennis was examining and testing it
speculatively, and at the inspector’s ques-
tion he turned.
  “ Do you mind, sir, ’twas a wide shiny
mark burnished on a pipe running across the
top of an air shaft that showed Mac and
me how a murderer had swung himself
down on a rope and in at a window, in the
first case ever he butted in on after he left
the force?” he asked. “ This rain pipe
looks to be too frail to bear the weight of a
cat, but ’tis not a cat rubbed the rust off
here, and here, so it shines like a new tin!
I put on a clean shirt yesterday, more’s the
pity, but hold my coat and hat, Mac.”
  “ Mind or you’ll break your neck!” Mc-
Carty warned, forgetful of his friend’s call-
ing as he complied. Dennis scorned to re-
ply, but swarmed up the straining, creak-
ing ieader to the second floor, swinging out
to land as lightly and sure-footedly as the
cat he had metaphorically mentioned on
the broad sill of a window two feet away.
The leader, released suddenly from his
weight, tore loose from its fastening and
canted crazily against the angle of the wall,
shaking and clattering, and McCarty ex-
claimed:
  “ You’ll not be coming down the way you
went up!”
  “True for you!” Dennis sang out with
a note of rising excitement. “ I’ll be com-
ing down the way the last guy did who lit
here, and that’s by the inside! Wait you
there for me.”
  He had been examining the sill upon
which he stood, and the boards which cov-
ered the window, pressing experimentally
upon the latter, and all at once one of
them gave way, forced inward with an ac-
companying crash of glass.
  “Now you’ve done it!” McCarty ob-
served superfluously. “ Look out there is
not more than us waiting for you inside!”
“ I’ve my flash light, thanks be, and my
two fists,” Dennis responded. “ That
board wasn’t tight; the nails had just been
stuck back in the holes. Here goes an-
other!”
  With the rending of wood the second fol-
lowed the first, and with a third which he
wrenched loose, Dennis smashed in the
fragments of glass which still clung to the
sash, and then wriggled lithely through the
aperture and disappeared. McCarty drew
a long breath and turned to his former su-
perior.
  “ I’d like to be following him,” he said
wistfully. “ If so be some guy is hiding in
there—the same one that grabbed the lad
—he’ll be desperate enough to kill, and
Denny’s too slow-thinking and slow-mov-
ing to take care of himself! I’m heftier
than him, and ’tis long since I did any
shinnying, but maybe that pipe would hold
me after all!”
  “ A man with four medals from the fire
department for meritorious conduct and
conspicuous bravery doesn’t need a nurse-
maid, Mac!” the inspector responded with
a laugh. “ Personally, I don’t believe any
256
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
one’s been in there for months before him,
but—what’s that?”
  “ That ’’ was a sudden subdued commo-
tion within, a long-sustained clatter fol-
lowed by a reverberating thud, and then a
silence ominous in its intensity.
  “I knew it!” McCarty dropped the
hat and coat and made for the wooden bar-
rier that sealed the main back door. “ I’m
going in if I break the whole damn place
down! Denny! Denny! I’m coming!”
  His reassuring roar was lost in the mighty
smash of his fist on the rotting boards, but
after the first blow the inspector reached
him and dragged him back.
  “ Have you taken leave of your senses?”
the latter demanded. “ You’ll have the
whole block aroused to find us breaking
and entering! Riordan’s all right! There,
1 hear somebody moving about inside.
Listen! ”
  McCarty waited, panting and tense, and
faintly there came to his ears the sound as
of stumbling footsteps within, and a
scratching noise from a window at the left
of the door which, being protected by an
iron grillework, had been left unboarded.
A heavy green shade hung close against
the inner side of the dirty w'indow pane,
furrowed by many past rain storms, and
•the stout bars seemed at a glance to be
firmly imbedded in the broad stone sill, but
McCarty strode to them and began trying
them one by one, while behind him the in-
spector drew his revolver and stood ex-
pectant.
  “Look here, sir!” McCarty whispered.
“ Tis fine burglar protection they’ve got
in these houses! See how this bar slides
up into its groove in the top of the case-
ment till you can pull it out below and
down over the sill entirely! I’ll bet the
next will work the same. It does! If we’d
taken the trouble to find this out at first—
Glory be, here’s Denny himself!”
  The green shade had flown up, and the
face of Dennis appeared in a sickly yellow
aura cast by his flash light, but he prompt-
ly extinguished it and set to w-ork on the
catch of the window. As McCarty removed
the fourth bar the sash opened upward,
and the two, who had meanwhile been ex-
changing grimaces pregnant with meaning,
gazed silently at each other for a full min-
ute. Then McCarty found his voice.
  “ Where is he?” he demanded. “ What
did you do with him? WTe heard the row
out here—”
  “ There wasn’t any ‘ him,’ ” Dennis in-
terrupted sheepishly. “ It was me, by my-
self. I came on the stairs unexpected like,
and took the whole flight of them without
even breaking my flash light! But come
in, the both of you, and see what I found!”
McCarty scrambled over the sill, and In-
spector Druet, despite his added years, fol-
lowed with the effortless ease of a boy.
They found themselves in a large room
bare of furniture, but in the dust which
lay like a heavy carpet upon the floor, a
meandering trail of footsteps, many times
traversed, ran from the window by which
they had entered to a connecting door open-
ing into a laundry. Dusty finger-marks,
with here and there the imprint of a whole
hand, were plainly outlined on the white
woodwork of the inner sill, and below it
greasy pieces of wrapping paper were scat-
tered, while in a comer tw® pitchers and
several small tin cans were heaped.
  “ Some one has been camping out here,
that’s evident,” the inspector remarked.
“ Getting his food handed in to him through
that window, too!”
  “ And it wasn’t any ordinary bought
stuff, the kind that comes ready fixed in
stores.” McCarty was poking about in
the papers. “ Here’s the carcass of a whole
chicken, pieces of fancy rolls, and pastry
and other stuff, but it’s all stale; it’s been
here for four or five days, at least.”
  “ And there’s traces of coffee in those
pitchers and cans, to say nothing of the
wine bottles on that shelf!” Dennis point-
ed impatiently. “ He’s been living on the
fat of the land from one of the houses in
this row, and the nearer the likelier, even
if it does happen to be occupied by them
high-and-mighty Parsons! Come upstairs
till I show you more.’*'
  The larger adjoining room must have
been the laundry, for rows of enameled
tubs and washing machines were ranged
against the wall, and driers stood about,
but all were covered with a thick blanket
of dust. Dennis led the way through a se~

ries of kitchens and pantries far more elabo-
rate than those they had encountered in
Orbit’s house, to the back stairs and up
to the second floor rear, into the room with
the broken window. All the way they had
followed that zigzag trail of overlapping
footsteps, and here the floor was crossed
and recrossed by a network of them. This
apartment had evidently been one of the
master bedrooms, for a well-appointed,
marble-lined bath opened from it, and
heavy, old-fashioned furniture of richly
carved mahogany inlaid with tarnished gilt
marquetry was ranged with stiff precision
about the room. A half-burned candle
shielded from the window by an old card-
board box cover stood on a side table, to-
gether with a handful of matches and some
cigarette stubs, and McCarty pointed to it.
  “ He couldn’t live without a light, but he
hid it from the window, and he didn’t dare
carry it when he went down to get his
food; that’s why those footprints rambled
so, he was feeling his way in the dark.
That bed looks as if it had been slept in,
with all those old draperies piled on it,
and what’s in that big pitcher on the bu-
reau?”
  “ Water,” Dennis replied. “ There’s still
a little left, though you can see from the
marks on the inside where it has dried
down.”
  “ Evaporated?” The inspector nodded.
“ That would show, too, that whoever the
fellow was he hadn’t used any of it for a
few days at least. Hello, what’s this?”
  He had turned to the bathroom, and
after a moment he emerged from it holding
a bright, new razor, a piece of soap, and
a very dirty Turkish towel.
  “ The water has been turned off in the
pipes, of course, but there is an empty
bucket in there in which some must have
been brought to him, and he seems to have
had some regard to his personal appearance,
at least. The Goddard boy said the man
who had tackled him was rough looking
and unshaved, didn’t he?”
“ When he tackled him, yes,” McCarty
replied. “ He had chance enough to clean
up after, as soon as whoever was helping
him to hide here brought him the things.”
“He did more than that!” Dennis de*

clared. There was an unwonted flush on
his leathery cheeks, and his gray eyes were
alight with excitement. “ Why do you sup-
pose he was hiding here, anyway? Why
does anybody hide? If ’tis not to do some-
thing unlawful, couldn’t he have broken
the law already and be hiding from it?”
“Denny!” McCarty breathed. “What
are you getting at? You’ve found out
something! Who is the man?”
  “ Who’s wanted now, inspector?” Den-
nis asked. “ Somebody that’s gentleman
enough to keep shaved and clean in spite
of everything, who’d appreciate good food
and wine and the best in life, and yet was
a convicted criminal for all that!”
  “ ‘ Convicted—’ ” McCarty started for-
ward. “ An ex-crook, do you mean? How
did you guess—”
  “ ‘ Ex-crook,’ nothing! ” retorted his con-
feree. “ I’m not up in the latest of prison
styles, but if this ain’t a penitentiary get-
up, I’m an Orangeman!”
  He flung open a closet door behind him,
dived in and dragged forth in triumph a
telltale suit of stained and ragged gray.
  “ Sing Sing!” exclaimed Inspector Druet.
“ Good Lord, Riordan, you’ve made a find!
Do you remember, Mac, that three men
escaped last month? One was killed mak-
ing his get-away, and another caught and
transferred to Dannemora, but the third of
those that crushed out then is still at large,
and there’s a big reward out! Heaven
knows how he managed to get into the
Mall, and why he should have come here,
of all places, but I’ll stake my life that the
man who has been hiding in this house is
George Radley!”
CHAPTER XII.
THE BREATH OF DEATH.
 WHO is he?” asked Dennis, wide
 eyed. “ Who is this George Rad-
 ley?”
  “ You remember, don’t you, Mac?” The
inspector turned to the ex-roundsman.
“ Radley was a young chemist—”
 “A chemist!” caroled McCarty and
Dennis in unison. Then their mouths shut
like traps, and they stared at each other.
258
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  “ What’s got into you two?” Inspector
Druet demanded. “ This Radley was ac-
cused, together with an accomplice, of send-
ing poison to a mutual enemy, concealed in
candy. An innocent member of the man’s
household ate it and died, but the actual
evidence against the accused was so weak
that they could only be convicted of man-
slaughter after two disagreements, and then
the accomplice only got two or three years
and Radley ten. He’ll have several more
to serve yet, however, even allowing for
good behavior, and then, too. a guard was
seriously injured in trying to prevent that
crush-out, so he’s wanted bad. He could
never have got as far as the city in those
clothes!”
  “ He had others outside of ’em, either
stole or slipped to him.” Dennis returned
to the closet and produced a pair of de-
lapidated shoes, gray trousers, and a long
mackinaw, together with a soft Panama
hat. “ Only the shoes are ragged, you see;
the rest is in pretty good condition, and
there’s an umbrella in a corner of the
closet. He could have got past the watch-
man easy on a rainy night, especially if he
said he was coming to see a maid, maybe,
in one of the houses. Still, that don’t ac-
count for his grabbing the Goddard kid, if
’twas him, and going through his pockets! ”
  “ His clothes may be a find, but we’ve
not got himself yet. What if he’s hid
under this roof now?” McCarthy exclaimed.
“ He’d have no call to harm the Goddard
lad unless Horace found out he was here
and was going to give him away; but harm
or no, if so be he’s had no chance to es-
cape! ”
  “You’re right, Mac!” The inspector
dropped the clothes he had been examining
and started for the door. “ We’ll smoke
him out!”
  But a painstaking search of the great
house from attic to cellar failed to reveal
any further trace of the refugee, and they
departed at last through the open window
in the basement to round the corner into the
court and come face to face with Bill Jen-
nings.
  “ Mr. Parsons’s butler next door sent
me,” the watchman explained. “ He said
somebody’s heard a noise in there and I’d
better see about it. Nothing wrong. I hope,
inspector?”
  Open curiosity rang in his tones, but
the official replied brusquely:
  “ Nothing. We’ll go over the other
empty houses on the block later. It’s all
right.”
  “ What’s this we’ve been hearing about
a strange man who scared the Goddard lad
in this very court not two weeks ago?” Mc-
Carty asked as they approached the side-
walk once more.
  Bill Jennings looked uncomfortable.
  “ There was no strange man got between
these gates while I was on!” he averred
defensively. “ It must have been some
butler or houseman that works on the block
trying to play a joke on the little feller. It
was a week ago Saturday that he raised
the rumpus about it, but there wasn’t any
sign of the rough-looking kind of guy he
described when Trafford and I looked, and
we went over every foot of the courts.
There’s Mr. Orbit motioning.”
  It was to the inspector and his deputies,
however, that Orbit beckoned, and when
they had crossed to him he asked with
grave concern:
  “ Is it true that Horace Goddard cannot
be found? One of the maids from next
door told Jean, and that you had been no-
tified, but I couldn’t believe it! Trafford
came to my house yesterday afternoon,
though, inquiring for him—but I forgot,
McCarty and Riordan were present. Is it
possible that the little boy hasn’t been seen
since?”
  “ Not so far as we’ve been able to dis-
cover,” the inspector responded. “ It’s a
pretty bad business. If he was a normal,
healthy, mischievous kid we’d be apt to
think he ran away, but from all accounts
he was sickly and timid, not the kind to
strike out for himself.”
  “ Horace is very nervous and highly
strung, with remarkable artistic possibili-
ties,” Orbit observed thoughtfully. “ I’m
immensely interested in him, and my friend
Blaisdell is of the opinion that he'll become
a great painter some day if his people don’t
kill his aspirations by lack of sympathy.
Like a sensitive plant he needs encourage-
ment, nurturing. But what can have hap-

pened to him? If he isn’t with friends or
relatives the child must have met with an
accident. Has an alarm been sent out?”
  “ We’re trying every way to locate him.
He used to run in and out of your house a
lot, didn't he? Did you ever hear him
speak of any one he might have gone to,
now?” the inspector asked. “ We know,
of course, how disappointed he was when
his father and mother wouldn’t let him go
on a sketching tour with this Mr. Blaisdell
you mention, but he seems to have got
over it. Do you know if he had any boy
friends his own age?”
  Orbit shook his head.
  “ None. He is a solitary little chap,
self-contained and retiring, and I don’t
think he cares very much for the society
of other boys. He would not have gone
away and remained like this without a word
if he was able to communicate with his
family. It seems inexplicable! Goddard
must be dreafully cut up about it, to say
nothing of the boy’s mother, and I feel
badly myself. I should hate to think of
any accident happening to him. I’m going
in to see Goddard and ask if there is any-
thing I can do. Meanwhile, you’ve no news
for me about Hughes’s strange death, have
you? It is odd that two such mysterious,
unrelated incidents should have occurred in
less than a week, even though Hughes must
have taken the poison either accidentally or
through some one’s murderous intent, after
he left the Mall that night. Haven’t you
come upon the slightest indication?”
  “ We’re working on several promising
ones.” The time-worn formula was repeated
a trifle wearily. “ Let you know when there
is anything to give out, Mr. Orbit. Come
on, Mac—it’s nearly noon.”
  Orbit turned toward the Goddard house,
but the others had scarcely gone a half
dozen steps in the opposite direction when
again they were halted. This time it was
by the pretty little French nurse, and she
drew the Bellamy baby closer, gazing at
McCarty with wide, affrighted eyes as she
voiced her question.
  “ Pardon, monsieur, but is it of a truth,
that which I have heard? Must it be that
the little garqon of that house there is
lost?”
  “ That’s about the size of it, ma'am.”
McCarty removed his reblocked derby with
a flourish. “ I don’t suppose you saw him
playing around anywheres yesterday after-
noon?”
  “ But no!” She caught her breath with
a slight gasp. “ All the night he has been
depart, alorsl It is terrible, that! He is so
gentle, so good, the little Horace! He
would not run away. Is it that he have
been stole? Me, I have fear for the little
Maude—”
  She hugged her small charge tighter, and
the baby stared at them solemnly.
  “There ain’t much danger of that!”
McCarty laughed reassuringly. “ I guess
the lad will turn up all right. When did
you see him last?”
  “ Yesterday morning, when he have
passed with M. Trafford. Oh, if he has
been keednap wre do not go beyond these
gates! ”
  She nodded, and led the child away slow-
ly, while Dennis remarked:
  “ Pretty and a lady, but did you ever
hear the like of such lingo? No wonder
them French have a fit when they talk; ’tis
from trying to understand each other.”
McCarty darted a quick glance at the
harassed frown on the inspector’s face, and
then replied to his companion:
  “ She had it straight, though. Horace
has been depart all right, and if we don’t
get him back soon there’ll be a bigger howl
than ever from the chief. Isn’t that what
you’re thinking, sir?”
  The inspector nodded gloomily.
  “ I’m going to the agents in charge of
these houses and get the keys.” He indi-
cated the two closed residences east of Mrs.
Bellamy’s. “ Try to get a line meanwhile
on who slipped food to the man hiding over
there and what became of him, and meet
me here in an hour.”
  “ It’s not much he’s wanting,” Dennis
remarked as the inspector left them abrupt-
ly and strode toward the gate. “ Still, if
we could trace what cellar them wine bot-
tles came from that was stacked up on the
shelf in that empty house— Look! The
ambassador’s limousine is going away.”
  The impressive dark blue car was indeed
moving slowly away from the curb in front

of the Parsons house, and the great front
door closing. They caught another fleeting
glimpse of the sallow faced manservant, and
then McCarty exclaimed:
  !< Come on! I want a few words with the
butler over there, anyway, and maybe the
old gentleman himself, and don’t be putting
in your oar, Denny, and rocking the boat.
I know what I’m after.”
  Dennis followed in injured silence, and
they mounted the steps of the stately house
iand rang the bell. A lengthy pause en-
sued. McCarty was about to ring again,
when the door opened suddenly and the
manservant whom they had seen a moment
before stood confronting them. He paid
no heed to Dennis, but his dull, sunken eyes
fastened themselves on McCarty, and as
he stared his sallow cheeks seemed to
whiten.
  “ Hello, Porter. You remember me, I
see,” the latter said brusquely. “ Me and
my friend here want to have a little talk
with you.”
  “ My name’s not Porter; it’s Roberts,”
the man replied stiffly with an evident effort.
“ You’ve made a mistake.”
  “Not me, my lad!” McCarty spoke
with easy assurance. “ Inspector Druet got
you, too, the other day, but he didn’t bother
you then because we didn’t know as much
as we do now.”
  “ By God, you’ll never frame me again!”
The man shrank back, and a harsh, grating
note came into his low tones. “ You
haven’t got anything on me!”
  “ Haven’t, hey! How about the neigh-
bor you’ve had next door for the past week
or so?” McCarty inquired, while Dennis
held his breath. “ Look here, Porter, I sup-
pose you have been pretty well hounded,
and I don’t want to be hard on you, but I’m
going to get the truth.”
  “‘Neighbor’!” The pseudo Roberts
moistened his dry lips. “ I don’t know what
you’re talking about!”
  “ Maybe Mr. Parsons does, then. We’ll
see him.” McCarty made as though to push
his way past the cowering figure; and the
man threw out his hands.
  “ For God’s sake, don’t, just when he’s
giving me the only square chance I’ve had! ”
It was more an agonized whisper than
speech. “ I’m Porter, all right, but he
knows that! He knows I got railroaded,
and you bulls wouldn’t let me go straight
afterward; that’s why he took me in. I
don’t know what you’re trying to hang on
me now, but you’re not going to drag him
into it. What do you want of me?”
  McCarty glanced down the long hall,
which seemed almost bare in its lofty aus-
terity in spite of the richness of the carved
paneling and quaint old furniture.
  “ Take us some place where we can talk
without anybody butting in,” McCarty sug-
gested. “ It’s for your own sake, man! If
you’ll come clean—”
  “I’ve heard that before!” Porter
shrugged, with a shadow of a dreary smile.
“ Come along back to my pantry if you
want to, but why don’t you take me right
down town now and be done with it? If
you’re out to frame me, cut all the bluff!”
“ Did I ever?” demanded McCarty.
“ Did I ever try to send you or any other
guy up, unless I had the straight goods on
them?”
  “ I guess not, Mac. I haven’t got any-
thing against you, but I’ve had a rough
deal. What’s come now is just the luck of
the game, I suppose.”
  He closed the pantry door carefully be-
hind them, and, motioning to chairs, he
leaned back against the table, gripping its
edge with his thin hands.
  “ What do you want to know? I’ll come
clean, all right—about myself.”
  McCarty noted the almost imperceptible
pause, and asked quickly:
  “ How long have you been out this
time?”
  “ A year and a half. My lungs went
back on me, and I would have been a goner
if I hadn’t got pardoned, but what good
did it do me? Every time I got a job
clerking in a drug store one of the narcotic
squad came along with my record, and I
was kicked out. My record! God! And
I wasn’t guilty! I never knew my boss was
crooked and in with the dope ring, making
me the scapegoat!”
  His voice had roughened again with a
sort of savage earnestness. “ I was about
at the end of my rope, but the—the man
who’d had me pardoned was keeping his eye
ANNIHILATION.
261
on me all the time, and saw how hard I'd
tried, and—and so Mr. Parsons took me on
here to give me a breathing spell. Any-
thing else—about me—you want to know?”
“ Yes.” McCarty replied on a sudden in-
spiration. “ You were tried with Radley,
weren’t you, and convicted of sending that
poisoned candy—”
  He paused, and Porter shrugged again.
  “ What’s the comedy for? You got that
from headquarters, and nobody’s making a
secret of it. It was that old charge, the
record of that first case, that convicted me
again, and it helped convict Radley, too,
for we were both of us innocent. But what
is the use of telling that to you now?"
  “ There’ll be a lot of use in telling us,
for your own sake, what you had to do with
the crush-out last month.”
  “ Nothing. I haven’t been outside these
gates since I came in June.”
  “ Then, you didn’t know anything about
it till Radley showed up here a couple of
weeks ago?”
  “ I don’t know anything about it now,
except what I read in the papers.” Porter
faced him squarely. “ What do you mean
about Radley showing up?”
  “ You didn’t hide him in that empty
house next door and smuggle food and
drinks and a razor and clothes in to him,
did you?” McCarty paused for a moment
again, but Porter maintained a dogged si-
lence, and he went on: “ Does Benjamin
Parsons know of it? ’Twill be news to him
to hear that after him taking you in and
all. you’ve been making him accessory after
a crush-out—”
  “ He’s accessory to nothing!” Porter in-
terrupted. “ I know the law, for I have
bitter reason to. He’s a fine old man, and
believes in giving everybody a fair chance,
especially if they’ve been framed; but he’d
do nothing against the law even if he thinks
it’s in the wrong. You’ve no proof that
Radley was here or that any one helped
him to hide, but I’m glad he made his get-
away—glad! I hope to God he’s never
caught to go back to that hell!”
  “ Even though you go, now?” McCarty
demanded. “ You’ve one chance to keep
clear of it, Porter, and you’ll not be giving
Radley away, either. We’re wise already
that ’twas you helped him to hide and then
make his get-away, but ’tis not Radley we
are after now, except as the alarm has gone
out to the whole force. We’re on another
lay entirely, but we just want to find out
when he beat it away from the Mall and
how he got out. I never gave my word
yet that I broke it, and I’m giving it now
that ’twill not be from me nor Riordan
either a hint will get out about your part in
all this.”
  “ You mean you’re not here to frame me
nor kid me into snitching on Radley?” A
faint tremor of hope ran through his tones
as he gazed searchingly into the honest,
square jawed face before him. “ You’ve
got a name for fair play, Mac, and you’re
on to enough already to put me away again
if you want to, so what I tell you can’t
matter. It won’t hurt George Radley either,
as it happens.”
  Dennis started violently; and McCarty
asked:
  “ Why can’t it? You don’t mean he's
croaked?”
  “ I mean I don’t know any more than
you do when he beat it or how he passed
the gates, and that’s the God’s truth!”
Porter responded slowly, his gaunt, sallow
face twitching. “ I read about his escape
in the papers, as I told you, and when the
days passed and he wasn't caught I was
happy, thinking he had got clean away, but
I never dreamed of him turning up here.
  “ Late one afternoon, though—never
mind how long ago—I opened the side door
to find him all but leaning against it, weak
from hunger and thirst and fairly desper-
ate. He'd got past the watchman during
a rainstorm a night or two before to try to
reach me, his old pal, and he’d been hiding
in that empty house next door, without food
or water, not daring to come openly and ask
for me. When I didn’t show myself he made
up his mind to beat it, but he found he
couldn’t get out as easy as he’d got in, and
he was near crazy!”
  “ That ’11 be a week ago last Saturday.”
McCarty nodded. “ When you came on him
he was just after grabbing a kid that lives
on the block here and searching his pockets
to see could he find if the lad had a key to
the gates!”
262
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  “ Glory be!” Dennis ejaculated beneath
his breath.
  “ Yes. He was half off his head, but he
didn’t hurt the boy any—only scared him.
I made him go back next door and lay low
till the search was over, and after nightfall
I took him some bread and meat and a bot-
tle of rare old port from the cellar. It was
stealing, and poor return for all the old
gentleman has done for me, but George
needed it bad, and I figured I owed most
to him. He needed clothes, too, but mine
fitted him, and I didn’t have to steal money
for him, either, because the old gentleman
pays me good.
  “ The trouble was, how to get him
through the gates, for after the scare he’d
given the boy both watchmen were leery of
strangers; and if he was held up and ques-
tioned I knew he’d go to pieces from the
long strain he’d been under, and it would be
all up with him.”
  Porter reached for a silver jug of ice
water which stood on the table beside him,
and drank deeply, then replaced it with a
sigh of relief. “ No one has keys except
the families themselves, and I’d no chance
to borrow Miss Parsons’s, of course, nor
her niece—Miss Hester’s. The old gentle-
man carries his on a ring and sleeps with
it under his pillow, and though I tried twice
to get it he woke up both times. I had a
job of it to explain what I was doing in his
room, and I didn’t dare risk it again.
George was getting wild with the waiting
and worry, and took to prowling out at
night in spite of all I could say. I was get-
ting pretty desperate myself, when all at
once he’d gone. And that’s all I know.”
  McCarty rose.
  “ When did you see him last?”
  “ Sunday night late, when I went to
take him some food. I handed it in through
the window, and we talked for a minute,
but I didn’t dare stay longer. George was
almost ready to give himself up, for his
nerve was gone, and it was all I could do
to persuade him to wait. We’d arranged
that I was to go to him every other night—
I couldn’t risk it oftener—so I didn’t miss
him Monday. Last evening I got some
rolls, a cold pheasant, and a half bottle of
burgundy, and waited under the window
as long as I dared; but he didn’t come, and
finally I took down the loose iron bars and
let myself in. There wasn’t the least sign
of a light from his candle, and he didn’t
answer when I took a chance and called,
so I left the food and came away, but I
was awake all night, worrying, and toward
morning I went back and got the stuff,
which hadn’t been touched. I was afraid
cook would miss the pheasant and it might
be found and traced. I never thought about
the wine bottles.”
  “ So he might have got away any time
from Sunday night on?”
  “ That’s right. I’m giving it to you
straight, Mac, and I knew when I saw you
an hour ago that you’d be after me sooner
or later, especially when Miss Parsons—the
old gentleman’s sister, Miss Priscilla—heard
a noise next door and told me to notify the
watchman. I was afraid it was all up with
us last week when Inspector Druet came,
but it was about that valet from across
the street who was poisoned, and the in-
spector didn’t even let on he recognized
me.”
  “ Do you know the kid that Radley tried
to get a key off of?” McCarty ignored the
observation.
  “ Only by sight. Red haired, isn’t he,
and lives next door to where that valet
worked? I see him now and then going
by on the other side of the street.”
  “ Have you seen him since he got that
scare?”
  “ Oh, yes.” Porter smiled faintly in sur-
prise. “ Only a day or so ago. George did
not mean to scare him—he wouldn’t harm a
fly.”
  “ You’ve been here since June, you say,
Porter? Did you know that valet who
died?”
  “ No. I think I’ve seen him with the
butler from the next house, but I don’t
want to know any of them. I was glad
enough to stay here and do a servant’s work
myself till I could get my nerve back to go
out and hunt up my own kind of a position
again where the bulls wouldn’t keep moving
me on.”
  He smiled again, but bitterly. “ I guess
there isn’t a chance of that now, with you
on! I’m not sorry, though; I’d do it again
ANNIHILATION.
263
for George! He was innocent, the same as
me, and look what was done to him!”
  “ If I find you’ve come clean, I’ll keep
my word, Porter,” McCarty reiterated as
he moved toward the door with Dennis in
tow. “ You may not know it, but I’m not
on the force any longer, nor connected with
headquarters except to mix in now and
then for old times’ sake; and the inspector
didn’t recognize you the other day; he kind
of knew your face, but he couldn’t place
you. Riordan and me will just forget you
laid eyes on Radley, unless it comes to a
showdown, and then we’ll do what we can.”
Cutting short the ex-convict’s broken
thanks, they took their departure, to find
Inspector Druet pacing impatiently back
and forth before the two closed houses op-
posite.
  “ Did you get any dope from Parsons?”
the inspector asked.
  “ We didn’t even see him,” McCarty par-
ried. “ I was getting a line on the ser-
vants. Do you recall saying you’d seen
one or two of them before? Have you
thought where?”
  “ Lord, no! I’ve had enough else on my
mind! I had an idea one of the housemaids
and the page boy who runs errands looked
familiar, but there wasn’t anything out of
the ordinary about them.”
  Dennis coughed, and McCarty remarked
hastily:
  “ I guess none of them knows what’s be-
come of the man who has been hiding next
door, nor anything about the Goddard lad,
and that’s all that matters right now, isn’t
it, sir? Did you get the keys to these
houses?”
  “ Yes, and explained again to that fool
of a watchman, Jennings. I had time to
look around pretty thoroughly outside them
while I waited for you, and I couldn’t find
a window or door that had been tampered
with, but we’ll see what’s inside.”
  One o’clock had come and gone and
another hour passed before they emerged
from the second of the two houses after a
fruitless search. Dust and mold were all
they had encountered in the huge, echoing,
partially dismantled rooms, and the foot-
prints they themselves left behind them
were the only recent signs of human pres-
ence.
  Dennis blinked and drew in the fresh air
deeply when they stood once more in the
sunlight.
  “ ’Tis like coming out of a tomb,” he
said. “ What’s it to be now, inspector?”
  “ I’m going to Goddard and make him
talk!” that official responded with a certain
grimness which was eloquent. “ Until he
comes across with his suspicions as to who
kidnaped the boy, our hands are tied, and
every hour counts. You two had better
get a bite to eat and meet me at his house
later.”
  Nothing loth, they accepted the hint, and
it was mid-afternoon before they ap-
proached the east gate of the Mall again,
to find Jennings energetically engaged in
driving away a swarthy vendor of toy bal-
loons, whose basket, freighted with globes
of bright, crude color bobbing on slender
sticks, resembled an uprooted garden patch.
  “ They’re a pest, those peddlers!” he de-
clared as he admitted them. “ They’re not
as bad, though, as the reporters that have
been trying to get in since you left. Say,
did you know Horace Goddard is lost?”
  “ Sure we know it!” McCarty interrupt-
ed. “ Didn’t Trafford tell you so himself
yesterday afternoon? Hurry, Denny!”
Leaving the watchman staring speechless-
ly, they quickened their pace toward the
Goddard house and were passing the en-
trance door of Orbit’s when it was flung
open and Ching Lee appeared.
  For once the Chinaman’s wooden impas-
sivity had deserted him. His slant eyes
were rolling wildly, his yellow face distort-
ed as he plunged down the steps and seized
McCarty with an iron grip.
  “ The nurse-baby!” he babbled, his sing-
song voice high and shrill. “ The Flench
maid of next door baby! Come quick!”
  “ Lucette, do you mean? The Bellamy
child’s nurse?” McCarty halted. “ Stop
chattering like a monkey and tell me where
she is, and what’s the matter?”
  “ Lucette!” Ching Lee nodded vigorous-
ly and pointed in at the -open windows of
the conservatory. “ She is the next! She
has breathed the breath of death!”
TO BE CONTINUED NEXT WEEK
By GEORGE M. JOHNSON
TOM WILLOUGHBY started to step
on the gas, but changed his mind
and stepped on the brake instead, as
the car he was on the point of passing
swerved abruptly to the left.
  “ What’s that crazy fool think he’s try-
ing to do?” he growled angrily.
  A moment later, with a clear road ahead,
Tom sent out an ear-piercing blast from his
horn and swept on by the offending car,
shooting a side glance over at the driver
as he did so.
  “ Might have known it all the time,” he
muttered. “ It’s a woman driving.”
  His wife, Alicia, in the seat beside him,
pressed her lips firmly together in resent-
ment at the contempt in his tone.
  “ You make me awfully mad when you
talk that way, Tom,” said she. “ Just as
many men do boobish things on the road
as women, and you know it. Anyway, that
woman was perfectly right; she turned over
to dodge a deep hole in the road; she didn’t
know you were going to pass, because you
hadn’t yet sounded your horn.”
  “My word!” and Tom glanced toward
Alicia with an amused grin. “ At-a-
girl! Rally round to the defense of your
maligned sex!”
  “ But it makes me sick the way you men
persist in crabbing women who drive cars.
I think they do mighty well, especially when
so few of them can have a chance at a
car oftener than now and then—when
hubby doesn’t happen to want it. Women
are just as good drivers as men; lots of
them are better.”
  “ That’s what you say,” her husband re-
torted, and for the time being the discus-
sion died a natural death as their car swung
up to the Willoughby home. But Alicia
was not through by any means.
  After dinner that evening, when the chil-
dren—ages two and four—were safely in
bed and Tom had relaxed to the comfort
of a fragrant Havana, Alicia opened up
on him again.
  “ Tom,” she began, “ I think it’s about
time I learned to run the car.”
  “ I’d rather you wouldn’t,” he returned
shortly.
  “ But, Tom, dear, please be reasonable.
ALICIA LEARNS TO DRIVE.
265
All women drive nowadays. You know
yourself that whenever there’s an afternoon
bridge at the country club dozens of cars
are lined up, and every one of them was
driven out by a woman.”
  “ Women rarely become good drivers,”
he answered impatiently, “ and the few ex-
ceptions you are all ready to throw in my
face only prove the general rule. They are
lacking in the mechanical instinct. Driving
an automobile involves a great deal more
than the simple matter of steering it. An
intimate knowledge of the machine itself is
essential. No person who fails to under-
stand, for example, the principle underlying
the shifting of gears on a hill can ever make
a crack driver.”
  “ I don’t believe the majority of men
know that. To most of them what goes
on beneath the hood of the car they drive
is a sealed book. You happen to be an
exception; and yet you seem to assume that
all men know as much about the automo-
bile’s vitals as you do.”
  Tom Willoughby’s reply was a non-com-
mittal grunt.
  “ Listen, Tom,” and Alicia perched her-
self on the arm of his chair. “ Haven’t I
got brains?”
  “ Of course,” Tom admitted readily.
  “ Thank you so much! Well, then, this
is a sort of showdown. If silly little flappers
like Estelle Simmons and Dot Fenton can
sport around in big cars, and get away with
it, / can. What’s more, I intend to.”
  “ It’s not necessary at all,” Tom argued.
“ I can usually find time to take you wher-
ever you want to go. If not, you can easily
order a taxi. You know that.”
  “ You miss the point entirely. I must
do it, merely to show that I can. if no other
reasons came into the argument; plenty
others do, for that matter. It’s terribly
humiliating not to. Why, I'll soon be a
sort of laughing stock—the only woman in
my wide circle of acquaintance who is
forced to admit that she doesn’t know' how
to drive an automobile. Most of my friends
learned to drive practically as soon as their
husbands did; some before.”
  “ Women were never intended or designed
to drive cars!” Tom insisted, realizing as
he sooke the weakness of his assertion.
  “ Why, Tom Willoughby! You’re al-
most mid-Victorian in your ideas! I never
thought it of you. You belong back in the
dark ages, when women were mere parlor
ornaments, clinging vines, and all that sort
of thing; when no woman had any just
claim to beauty unless her waist was laced
in till it threatened to snap in two if she
had to bend over suddenly. No golf, ten-
nis, swimming, or driving cars for them,
poor dears! Croquet was their limit in
physical exertion.”
  “ I never did admire fat waisted women,”
Tom grinned provokingly.
  “ I suppose you mean by that remark
that you'd like me to begin pulling my
waist in. No, thank you! Women don’t
do it now, and they never will again.”
  “ No, I don’t mean that at all,” and Tom
glanced approvingly at his wife—as slender
and youthful in appearance as the day they
were married. “ You’re far from requiring
any such harsh measures. But don’t climb
up on any high horse regarding what women
will or will not do. You’ll all do exactly
what your imperial goddess, Dame Fashion,
demands of her loyal subjects; now the
streamline effect is in vogue, but when, in
the course of events, the cycle swings round
again and small waists are called for, you'll
find the poor, helpless women obediently
pulling in on the strings until their fingers
are blistered.”
  “ Tom Willoughby, you’re positively dis-
gusting!” Alicia flared, but Tom only
chuckled in exasperating good nature.
  His wife deserted him and withdrew to a
chair in another part of the room with an
air of injured dignity; presently she spoke
up again.
  “ I’m going to learn to drive the car just
the same!”
  “All right, all right!” Tom exclaimed
resignedly. “ If you say you will, you will.
So we may as well consider it settled. I'm
not crazy about the business, but I’ll give
you a lesson in the morning.”
  “ But I don’t want you to teach me, Tom.
Have a man sent up from the service sta-
tion.”
  “ What’s the matter with me? Can't I
drive well enough?”
  “You’re too good, Tom—so skilled a

driver yourself that you’d have no patience
with my shortcomings. All the women say
that you must never, never let your hus-
band teach you to drive. While you’re en-
gaged to him, or about the time he wants
you to become engaged to him, is the best
time; after marriage, never! Husbands jaw
you and bawl you out unmercifully, so one
must get a stranger. He has to be polite
and gentle with his pupil, no matter what
she does.”
  “ By Jove, Alicia, if you haven’t got it
all doped out!” and Tom laughed in spite
of himself. “ But here’s where your gears
don’t mesh. I’m willing to make a conces-
sion and let you learn to drive the car, but
I’m not going to have any half baked young
salesman from the agency sit back and
smile serenely while you in your blessed ig-
norance ruin the sweetest running motor in
the city. I’ll promise to try to behave like
a gentleman and not yell at you unduly,
but if you take lessons in driving, it’s got
to be with your husband as teacher. I'm
sorry, hon, but that’s the best I can do for
you.”
  Alicia hesitated an instant, then grace-
fully yielded to what she instinctively real-
ized was the inevitable.
  “ All right,” she agreed, “ but let's make
a game out of it. Let’s pretend that you’re
not teaching your wife at all; just imagine
that your pupil is that snappy looking little
Mrs. Armstrong, of whom you spoke so
warmly the other day.”
  “ What’s the big idea?” Tom demanded,
eying Alicia a bit uneasily.
  “ Why, if you were teaching Mrs. Arm-
strong to drive your car, stupid, and she
pulled back on a lever instead of pushing
forward, or made that mysterious thingum-
bob under the floor boards chatter like a
mowing machine, you’d say: ‘ Never mind;
that’s really nothing at all; you’re doing
splendidly.’ That’s what you’d say, Tom,
and down in your precious old heart you
know it. On the other hand, if your poor
wife made a frightful mess of things, I’m
very much afraid you’d swear—not at her,
of course; but swear in a general sort of
way. And I’m pretty sure you’d inquire,
loud enough to frighten some horses a quar-
ter of a mile away: ‘ What in the world are
you trying to do—wreck the boat?’ And
so that’s why I’d like to impersonate Mrs.
Armstrong during the lesson, if you don't
mind.”
  Tom sat back and laughed till the tears
came.
   “ You win the flat tire, Alicia,” he cried.
“ Don’t worry; I’ll be good.”
  “ You better had, Tom Willoughby,”
Alicia declared; then she added darkly:
“ Remember that if you yell at me, I'm
going to be awfully mad.”
  “ Fair enough, old girl,” Tom laughed,
“ since you’ve warned me. Now if you’re
going to drive we might as well go about this
right. You’ve got to get at least a general
knowledge of the principles involved. I
think I can make it reasonably clear.”
Alicia listened dutifully; at first, that is.
But she skidded rather badly on the second
curve, and then, her brain a confused jum-
ble of meaningless terms—carburetor, pis-
ton, compression stroke, cam shaft, and so
on—she wisely reflected that none of the
girls who drove cars knew anything about
that formidable list and managed to get by
on the road in spite of such ignorance. So
why worry? Instead, she began dreaming
about how much fun it was going to be
when she was free to use the car without
having to call on Tom to drive her around.
Suddenly the instructor ceased his lecture
with a brisk:
  “ Understand so far?” whereupon Alicia
dimpled sweetly at him and confessed with
praiseworthy candor:
  “ Not all, I’m afraid.”
  To her relief Tom took it as a good joke.
“ I'm crazy to think of jamming all this
into your head at once, hon. What you
need you can pick up as you go along. To-
morrow morning we’ll have the first lesson.”
Tom was really very gentle and patient
with Alicia; she admitted that herself. In-
deed he was quite puffed up with pride over
his forbearance with her slips. As a mat-
ter of fact, however, she managed quite
well—for the initial attempt.
  “ Did I do so terribly bad, Tommy?”
she inquired when they returned home.
  “ No-o,” Tom answered judicially. “ But
when you stop the car, remember not to
let in the clutch until the gears are in neu-

267
tral. You stalled the engine that way sev-
eral times, even after I’d cautioned you.”
  “ Neutral’s when the lever’s in the middle
of the H, isn’t it?” she asked, and when
Tom nodded, Alicia began repeating to her-
self over and over: “ Don’t let in clutch un-
less gears are in neutral,” though not having
the slightest idea as to the whys and where-
fores.
  A few days later Tom gave her practice
in gear shifting on a hill, and poor Alicia
didn’t do quite so well. Actually the en-
gine came in for quite a bit of abuse,
though its driver was blissfully unconscious
of this. Finally she plugged up a long
hill, barely crawling around a dangerous
curve in high gear. Alicia had dreaded that
place, and getting by it at all was to her
very much of a victory.
  “There!” she breathed in triumphant
elation. “ Wasn’t that fine?”
  “ No!” groaned Tom, who had held him-
self in so far only by Herculean efforts. “ It
was rotten!”
  Quickly she pulled off to one side of the
road and stopped; in her hurt bewilderment
at this wholly unexpected condemnation in-
stead of the hearty praise she had hoped
for, Alicia let the clutch pedal back while
the engine was still running, the gears in
high. The car gave a little jump forward,
and then the engine stalled.
   “ I’m sorry,” faltered Alicia, realizing the
mistake too late to remedy it, “ but when
you get that dying-duck-in-a-thunderstorm
look on your face, I’m gone; that’s all.
Now what in the world did I do wrong com-
ing up that hill?”
  “ Everything,” said Tom shortly. “ You
were moving too slowly for high, and the
poor old engine was knocking its head off.
You should have dropped into second, or
cured the knock by pulling down the spark
lever. I explained that to you very care-
fully yesterday.”
  “ But there are so many things to remem-
ber, Tommy,” Alicia cried miserably. “ You
ought not to expect me to get them all at
once.” Desperately she struggled against
giving way to the tears, which were perilous-
ly near the surface. “ I got up the old
hill, didn’t I? What difference does it
make how I got up?”
   “ Gad, Alicia, but that s a terrible line of
argument!” Tom fumed, beginning to lose
his temper. “ What would you think of a
surgeon who bungled in an important opera-
tion, and then excused it with the careless
remark: ‘ Well, what difference does it make
as long as the patient refused to die?’ Of
course you got up the hill, but a few more
successes like that and our car will be ready
for the junkman. I don’t believe you’ll ever
learn to drive.”
  Alicia, her lips quivering, slipped out
from behind the wheel.
  “ Go ahead and drive yourself!” she de-
clared. “ I’m through. All the girls said
it was always this way when your husband
taught you. And that’s the f-first t-time
you ever jawed at me.”
  “ But I didn’t really jaw you, dear,” Tom
said gently, already ashamed of his mo-
mentary temper. “ I didn’t say anything so
very rough, did I?”
  “ You said my driving was r-rotten when
I thought I’d done so well, and you couldn’t
have looked any blacker if I’d run the old
car through a stone wall.”
  “ I’m sorry, dear. But you ought to know
by this time that any unnecessary abuse of
a fine motor makes me actually sick. To
me an automobile is like a living thing.”
  “ That sounds very well,” Alicia rejoined
in stony dignity, “ but your wife surely is
entitled to as much consideration as any
automobile; you shouldn’t think more of a
collection of senseless steel parts than of
her feelings. Since you do, I suppose I’d
better give up my idea of driving. I can
see what it will lead to.”
  “ Come now, Alicia, please be reasonable.
I was rude, and I apologize. Start the motor
and try it again.”
  “ Do you really want me to? You
haven’t been displaying any alarming symp-
toms of enthusiasm.”
  “ Well, as long as your heart is set on
driving, I want you to keep at it. Please,
Alicia!”
  So Alicia tried it again, but she was ner-
vous and Tom was also nervous, though h&
made a manful effort to conceal his condi-
tion, which w’as so pitiable that Alicia was
actually sorry for him. She managed to get
them home without wrecking the car.
268
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  In the lessons which followed she made
less rapid progress than at the beginning, for
Tom was very exacting as to the finer points
of driving. Alicia was more than once close
to utter discouragement.
  “ I must say you’re hard to suit!” she ex-
claimed one day. “ Honestly, I don’t be-
lieve it’s humanly possible to please you.
No matter what I might do, you’d find
something to criticize.”
  “ I'm trying my darnedest in what looks
like the hopeless job of making a good driv-
er of you,” he snapped back. “ There’s
one thing you certainly are good at; that’s
forgetting instructions. If you’d only do
as you’ve been told, there’d be no criticisms
forthcoming. What I can’t seem to get you
away from is the footless and silly notion
that any old way is good enough provided
it gets you there.”
  Tom and Alicia were really an ideal cou-
ple, held up as the perfect model of wedded
happiness by all their friends. The only
times they ever even approached a quarrel
was over the car, and those occasions left
both of them miserable.
  Alicia was slow in gaining that self-confi-
dence which is so essential to the full mas-
tery of a heavy automobile. This w-as main-
ly Tom’s fault, for, perhaps unconsciously,
his very attitude served to destroy her con-
fidence, to unnerve her. The best drivers
do not always make the best instructors.
  Came a Saturday when they had been in-
vited for dinner and an evening of bridge
with friends—a young married couple living
about twenty miles away. The weather was
threatening when they started, and as a
measure of precaution Tom fitted the tour-
ing car with its side curtains. The sky
grew blacker, but no rain materialized dur-
ing the trip, and the storm did not finally
break until just as dinner was served. Then
it more than made up for the delay—an
electrical disturbance of unusual severity,
accompanied by a veritable cloudburst
which continued fully two hours without
intermission.
  The storm put an effective damper on
the social pleasures of the evening, as both
Alicia and her hostess were terrified by the
vivid lightning, and Tom himself was secret-
ly concerned as to road conditions for the
homeward drive. The rain finally slack-
ened, and Tom announced that he thought
they ought to start back.
  “ Don’t think of going home to-night, old
man,” cried the host. “ We’ve a spare bed-
room that isn't earning its keep. Better stay
over with us.”
  “ Indeed, yes!” his wife urged hospitably.
“ It would be foolish to go home now.”
  “ But mother’s staying with the chil-
dren,” Alicia protested, “ and if we don’t
appear at all she’ll be frantic.”
  “ I’ll phone your mother not to expect
you till to-morrow,” but her attempt to get
the central operator was fruitless. The
line was dead.
  “ Storm’s put the wires out of commis-
sion,” Tom Willoughby remarked.
“ What '11 we do, Alicia? Go or stay?
It’s up to you.”
  “ We’ll have to go,” Alicia declared
without an instant's hesitation, and no urg-
ing on the part of their friends could change
her decision.
  It was about ten when they set out, the
rain decreased to a fine, steady drizzle,
though the thunderstorm had passed by.
Two miles from the starting point the road
crossed a small river, where their machine
was halted by a red lantern in the hands
of a guard.
  “ Can’t cross this bridge,” he warned
them. “ It’s liable to go plumb to kingdom
come any minute.”
  Tom got out to look the situation over.
The ordinarily modest little river was now
a foaming, roaring torrent, showing brown
with its load of sediment in the glare of the
head lamps. Even as he watched, one of
the bridge supports yielded to the relent-
less thrust of the flood.
  “ That bridge is scheduled to take a long
ride, I reckon,” was the guard’s cool com-
ment.
  “ Right you are,” Tom agreed grimly.
“ But how can I get across?”
  “ The iron bridge three miles down the
river at Haskins’s Mills was O. K. the last
report I got. But you better shake a leg,
for the way the water’s still rising even that
one won’t last.”
  The low mutter of thunder sounded while
he was speaking.
ALICIA LEARNS TO DRIVE.
269
  “ Another storm like the last one, and
we’ll not have a live bridge left in the
county,” the guard continued. “ Those
birds travel in pairs sometimes. Mebby
its twin brother is coming along now. If
it is—good night! You familiar with the
detour down to Haskins’s Mills?”
  “ Never drove it,” Tom told him.
  The guard gave detailed instructions as
to the road to the bridge; then added:
  “ When you once get across the river
you’re all right. Keep straight ahead for
four-five miles through the woods, and it ’11
bring you back to the State road here again.
You’ll find the traveling not too easy, but
it can be done. Some bad hills. Watch
your step on ’em.”
  “ Much obliged,” said Tom. “ Have a
cigar?”
  “Thanks!” returned the guard appre-
ciatively. “Good luck!”
  Tom briefly explained the situation to
Alicia.
  “ Nothing to be worried over,” he re-
marked as he turned around—a difficult
operation because of the ditches full of
water on either side of the hard roadbed.
  She snuggled comfortably up against him
as they headed back for the detour.
  “ I’m glad I’m not driving now, aren’t
you, Tommy?” she whispered. Then, star-
tled, “ What was that?” as a brilliant flash
illumined the sky.
  “ More lightning. Looks like another
storm coming.”
  “ What ever shall we do? You know
how deathly afraid of thunderstorms I
am.”
  “ Do?” he echoed. “ Why, nothing but
hit that bridge at the Mills, and then
straight ahead through the woods till we’re
on the State road again. Next stop, home.
Don’t let yourself get worked up, hon.
Really there’s no occasion to be frightened.”
“ But suppose it’s a storm like that first
one.”
  “ Don’t worry. We won’t get another
like that for ten years.”
  “ I hope not!” and Alicia shivered slight-
ly, nestling closer against her husband.
  The second thunderstorm developed far
more rapidly than its predecessor, but Tom
drove fast—almost dangerously fast for the
muddy road they traveled—and pulled up
at the iron bridge just as the first big drops
were falling. Lightning was almost con-
tinuous, though still some little distance
away. There was a guard on duty at this
bridge, as at the other.
  “ Is it safe?” Tom inquired anxiously.
  “ She’s safe enough now, mister,” he was
informed, “ but I ain’t predictin’ what she'll
be before morning. Listen to that barrage
old Lady Nature’s laying down back there.”
  Tom didn’t wait to discuss the matter.
He shot across the bridge and on up into
the woods, where he immediately found
any sort of speed wholly out of the ques-
tion. Then storm number two broke upon
them in earnest, proving Tom a poor
weather prophet as regarded his ten years
remark. Alicia clutched his arm in terror
at the continuous crackle of thunder and
the dazzle of lightning.
  Suddenly a huge dead chestnut just
ahead loomed up for the fraction of a sec-
ond, clear-cut in the blinding, unnatural
glare; with a roar like that of a thousand
cannon it actually exploded, heavy frag-
ments of the trunk and branches flying in
all directions. Alicia screamed frantically
as another lightning flash disclosed a por-
tion of the shattered tree toppling toward
them. To avoid it in its fall was out of
the question. Dimly she realized that Tom
had thrust her down from the seat, his own
body bent over hers as protection; a crash-
ing, splintering blow—and silence.
  Not many minutes later a trickle of
water, flowing through the ruined top of the
car on Alicia’s face, brought her back to
consciousness. She had not been hurt at
all; had fainted from sheer fright more
than anything else. A crushing weight
pinned her down, and a sickening realiza-
tion of what had happened swept into her
brain. The weight was Tom; possibly
killed, at the best badly hurt, by a piece of
the old chestnut when the lightning bolt hit
it. And his last conscious thought and act
had been of her—an attempt to save her
from the very danger which struck him
down.
  Desperately, hot tears flooding her eyes,
Alicia struggled to free herself. Tom’s poor
helpless body pressed down so heavily-
270
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
panic gripped her at its apparent utter life-
lessness. She managed to reach up and
turn the latch of the door, which opened
an inch and then stuck. Bracing her feet
as best she could in such cramped quarters,
Alicia pushed backward against the jammed
door. Abruptly it yielded, and she
sprawled out into the mud and pelting rain.
Quickly she regained her feet, intent only
on learning the extent of Tom’s injuries.
  The car lights were still burning, but
they gave her no help. However there was
a flash light in the side pocket of the door,
and Alicia had it out in a second.
  The scene it disclosed was startling
enough. A long splinter of the chestnut,
like a giant rail, had fallen directly across
the top of the car, crushing Tom down be-
neath. But how badly was he hurt? That
was the vital question now.
  In feverish haste she tugged at his limp
body, and after an effort succeeded in get-
ting it free from the jumble of torn mohair
and crumpled bows of the top; fortunately
the section of chestnut tree, cause of all
their trouble, had broken in half across the
car as a result of its fall, and now played
no part in holding Tom’s body prisoner.
 “Tom, dear, speak to me!” Alicia
moaned, her fingers smoothing back the
hair on his forehead.
  There was no response, and in a sudden
spasm of shuddering horror Alicia felt sure
that he was dead. She tore open his coat
and shirt, placing her ear directly above
the heart. The steady throb, characteristic
of a healthy, athletic man like Tom Wil-
loughby, was not there; but straining her
ear to catch the faintest sound above the
rattle of raindrops on the ruined top, Alicia
did get something; a flicker, perhaps even
more than that; not much, yet enough, at
least, to assure her that Tom was still liv-
ing.
  “Tom, darling! Don’t leave me!” she
whispered softly. “ You mustn’t leave me
now!” Then turning her face upward into
the stinging rain, she sobbed: “ Oh, God,
don’t let him die! He just can’t die!”
  A thin stream of blood trickled down
out of Tom’s rain-sodden hair, and Alicia,
seeking its source, found an ugly bruise on
the top of his skull. Tenderly she fingered
the wound, immediately realizing that it
was serious; she feared a fracture, perhaps
concussion of the brain. Prompt and ex-
pert medical attention might save him.
Otherwise — Alicia shuddered at the
thought. But to mention doctors—at such
a time and place—marooned there in the
depths of that desolate wood, on a lonely
road, a dreadful storm raging; it all seemed
a hopeless mockery.
  A sharp flash of forked lightning, with
its nerve - shattering accompaniment,
brought no more than a slight start from
Alicia. Suddenly she seemed to have lost
her former fear of lightning; in the har-
rowing crisis which she now faced all other
things seemed indeed trivial. What could
she do?
  “ I’m going to drive Tom home in this
car,” she abruptly announced aloud, ad-
dressing the raging elements. “ Stop me
if you can!”
  With a degrefe of forced calm Alicia sur-
veyed the machine by aid of occasional
lightning flashes and her small electric
lamp. The tangled mohair and splintered
bows formed a blockade behind the steer-
ing wheel, but she found a knife in Tom’s
pocket, and succeeded in cutting away the
worst of the mess. The section of chestnut
worried her, but owing to the lucky fact
that it had broken, Alicia shrewdly reasoned
that if she once got the car started it would
clear itself of that encumbrance.
  She settled Tom in the seat next the
driver’s; the posture was far from a com-
fortable one, but with a tender little smile
which reflected no pleasure and a world of
pain, she remembered that Tom was past
caring about bodily comforts or discom-
forts. Then, climbing awkwardly around
the obstructions that still blocked the
wheel, Alicia pressed the starter.
  Slowly, engine racing and wheels churn-
ing mud, the car moved ahead, with a sharp
cracking from the shattered chestnut. For
an instant progress ceased, and despair en-
gulfed Alicia at the thought that she was
trapped. Then the spinning wheels found
traction and the car leaped forward, free
from the dragging fragments of the splin-
tered tree.
  The rain increased to a deluge, fairly

blotting out the gleam from the head lamps.
The windshield supports were badly bent,
though by some strange freak of chance
neither of the plate glass sections had been
broken. The blur of water made the glass
opaque; she could see nothing through it.
Alicia struggled with the windshield; final-
ly succeeded in opening it. She had been
wet before, but now in an instant she was
soaked, the filmy evening gown worn in
honor of the little dinner party molded to
her like so much adhesive plaster. She
could see a little better, however, which
was the only important consideration.
  That backwoods road was none too good
under the most favorable circumstances;
now it was a nightmare—mud, rocks, and
water-filled holes into which the rear wheels
dropped to the hubs with a sickening lurch
of the car, there to spin furiously with the
racing engine, until at last they gripped
the slimy roadbed and again drove the ma-
chine forward. Rapid progress was im-
possible, even had Alicia dared attempt it:
most of the time she was forced to keep in
second. On that unspeakable road the big
car bucked and bounced like a flivver;
holding it down taxed Alicia’s strength to
the utmost.
  A stretch of hard gravel roused false
hopes that the worst was over, and for the
first time Alicia ventured to make fair
speed, conscious only of the fact that Tom’s
life might hang on a few seconds. The
gravel ended as unexpectedly as it had be-
gun, and at a sharp curve in the road.
When her wheels hit the soft mud, Alicia
skidded, and before she realized what had
happened, the left rear wheel was bedded
deep in the ooze, off to one side, the car
headed diagonally across the road.
  Alicia made one fruitless attempt to go
forward; then tried with no more success
to back. She had ridden enough with Tom
to learn the danger of letting the wheel
churn deeper and deeper in such a situa-
tion. Desperately struggling against an in-
clination to give way to panic, she got out
of the car to investigate. The wheel was
mired less deeply than she had feared,
though it was bad enough.
  The headlights disclosed a pile of tan-
gled tree tops and branches, left where
some one had been cutting firewood. To-
ward this Alicia stumbled, sinking nearly
to her knees in mud and water, a clump
of blackberry briers tearing viciously at her
legs, to which the gauzy dress she wore af-
forded no protection whatever.
  Several trips she made, thrusting the
dead branches down in front and back of
the tire. Half dead, Alicia crawled back
into the car, not till then realizing that one
of her slippers was gone. The dash light
showed a long tear in one of her black silk
stockings, the skin beneath white in con-
trast, the white rapidly changing to red.
Yet Alicia had felt no pain; there was a
growing numbness over her whole body.
It seemed that utter collapse could not be
far away. She grimly set her teeth, deter-
mined not to yield.
  She remembered that Tom had told her
the clutch must be eased in very gently
when a wheel was mired. She tried this,
the gear shift lever in reverse. To her de-
light the car responded, backing perhaps a
foot. Again she left her seat to thrust more
of the dead branches deep into the mud
where the wheel had been. Back in the
car she slipped the lever into low, hardly
daring to breathe as she gently nursed the
clutch, feeding only a little gas to the en-
gine, striving to the best of her ability to
avoid that fatal spinning of the trapped
wheel.
  She felt the motor slow down as the
clutch took hold. Alicia gave a trifle more
gas, and she wanted to shout in relief as
the car moved slowly forward. She cut the
wheel sharply, then straightened out, and
was again on her way.
  The slow progress made that lonely road
through the woods seem endless. Suddenly
Alicia woke up to the alarming fact that
the engine was no longer responding prop-
erly to the throttle; was losing its snap and
power. It even knocked distressfully when
she tried to push up a slight grade in sec-
ond. She shut off the ignition, and could
hear the water boiling furiously in the cool-
ing jackets.
  Sick and dizzy, hardly knowing what she
was about, Alicia got the folding bucket
from under the rear seat, dipping it full
from a roadside puddle; there was certain-
272

ly no lack of water available. But when
she heedlessly proceeded to unscrew the
radiator cap, a spurt of steam shot out into
the air, scalding her hand and fingers; she
didn’t feel the pain till later.
  It took four pails of water to replenish
the exhausted supply in the cooling system,
and again Alicia crawled weakly in behind
the steering wheel. She felt that to get out
of the machine once more would be utterly
beyond her failing strength.
  The second thunder storm had passed on
after the first, and now a cold rain fell with
steady relentlessness. A long winding hill
loomed up before her. Half delirious, she
babbled to the engine:
  “ Please, oh please take us up this hill!
Don’t desert me now! ” and almost reckless-
ly Alicia’s slipperless toes pushed down on
the accelerator for a good start. Up she
raced in second, but the grade and mud
were too much for the overheated motor;
it faltered, knocking. Alicia attempted to
get into low, a change she had never yet
had occasion to mrke on a hill. The gears
clashed horribly, and before she could start
up again the car came to a stop—started
backing down. In desperation she opened
the throttle wide, slamming home the
clutch. The entire transmission groaned a
bitter protest at such unfair treatment, but
everything held, and the machine, with a
violent jerk, resumed progress up the hill.
At last it gained the summit. Far below
lights were visible in the falling rain; they
marked the State road.
  Alicia was too far gone to appreciate the
dangers and difficulties which beset her on
all sides as the car had slid down that
grade. Under other circumstances, in day-
light, she would no more have undertaken
the task than attempt to drive an airplane.
  On the State road at last, Alicia’s brain
refused to work clearly. Dimly she remem-
bered that Tom must be taken to a doctor,
but like a wounded pigeon her thoughts
centered only on home, and toward home
she sped.
  In the meantime her mother was nearly
dead from worry. A phone message had
finally come through telling her that Tom
and Alicia had started at ten. An hour
usually sufficed for the trip, and when one
o’clock arrived with no other news from
the wanderers, the poor woman was con-
vinced that her fears of some disaster could
not be groundless. She sat up, waiting, un-
able to go to bed, dreading the worst.
  It was after two when she heard the
sound of a motor at the driveway. She
rushed to the door, but there was no an-
swer to her relieved cry of welcome. The
porch light shone on a forlorn looking car;
at first she could not recognize it as Tom's
machine; it looked like a wrecked ship,
the top crumpled in, nothing visible but
mud. And two unconscious figures in the
front seat, Alicia slumping forward across
the steering wheel. The last half of that
frightful journey she had driven on sheer
nerve, but there is a limit even to that. She
lasted just long enough to swing the car into
the driveway at home.
  In a couple of days Alicia was herself
again, save for a few minor aches and pains
that still persisted, but Tom got by much
less easily. In fact, he pulled through by
a very narrow margin. Finally they let her
see him.
  “ That was a wonderful thing you did,
Alicia,” he said huskily, as she dropped on
her knees beside the bed, her fingers ten-
derly stroking his bandaged head. “ Do
you know what the surgeon told me?”
  Alicia said nothing, her head pillowed on
Tom’s broad chest.
  “ He said,” Tom continued, fussing with
Alicia’s hair, “ that if you hadn’t got me
home when you did, it would have been the
end of the trail for me. You’re a wonder-
ful girl, Alicia; not one woman in a thou-
sand could have brought the car in over
that awful road. You’re a driver now,
Alicia. I’ll never criticize you again.”
  “ But I didn’t do at all well, Tom. dear,”
Alicia humbly confessed, her voice muffled
by the bedclothes. “ I got the poor old
engine terribly hot, and it knocked, and I
nearly stripped the gears, and everything.
Really I gave a miserable exhibition of
driving.”
  “ What of it, hon?” Tom demanded.'
“ Your getting through at all proved that
you’re a real driver. The accomplishment
was the important thing. How you did it
doesn’t make a particle of difference.”

CHAPTER XXII.
A STRANGE TURN.
THERE are some who are stunned by
danger. There are others who strike
back hard, an action of swift and un-
reasoned reflexes.
  And though Olivetta bad led a most shel-
tered life, yet now she reverted to the type
of what she might have been in the wild
and the rough. She was backed against
the wall. The loss of the pearls being dis-
covered, she could expect to be quickly
found and dragged from her hiding place.
And she estimated her strength, and the
distances to be covered, and all the things
to be done, if she bolted for the window
or, what seemed now a far better chance,
if she struck straight for the doorway and
strove to speed down the hall beyond and
down the stairs to the bottom of the house
with a prayer of hope that once she was
at the bottom she would find a door open,
and thence gain access to the street.
  Yet al! this was a hopeless planning. In
two bounds, no matter how by surprise she
took him, John Hodge would be up with
her. Or if he could not overtake her by
running, or if he wished to cut short the
thrilling screams which she would begin
the instant she started in her break for
safet}-, he would knock her down with a
bullet.
  She knew him well enough to know that,
she felt.
  All those hopes, doubts, fears, plans, had
been condensed and crammed into the space
of a meager second while the girl leaned
over the table drawer, her face working.
Then she turned upon John Hodge.
  “ After all,” she said in a low voice, “ it
was only a glorious bluff! ”
8 A

  “ Eh?” said Hodge, evidently at sea.
“ I’ve bluffed now and then, I suppose, and
here and there. But what are you referring
to now?”
  She gestured disdainfully to the drawer
and stepped away. John Hodge came to
the place in one long stride and stared down.
Olivetta, pushing to the side the clothes
which were hanging about her, prepared for
her desperate bolt, drew in her breath to
be in readiness for the first shriek on which
she must depend to draw vengeance upon
the heads of her enemies, and crouched a
little lower. But John Hodge had neither
exclaimed nor moved. He merely looked
down to the drawer in silence for a mo-
ment and then lifted a face which was only
a trifle paler, perhaps.
  “ Oh,” he said, “ you mean the pearls?”
“ What else?” said the girl. “ It really
excited me, your willingness to leave them
in my care. But I see that it was only
for effect, John Hodge—simply because you
thought that that would be a good way to
blind me. Ah, you’re a very clever fellow,
John, but you’ve given me just one too
many opportunities to see through you!”
Olivetta, amazed, studied him. And for
once he had no ready answer. What could
possess him? thought Olivetta.
  “ Wasn’t that a natural thing for me to
do?” he said. “ Particularly in the light
of what you said about your father? Good
gad, Jacqueline, you couldn’t expect me to
leave that large fortune around loose after
you had warned me about him, could you?”
“ There is no reason why you should
hunt for explanations, John,” she said.
“ They are your pearls. You can do what
you wish with them.”
  “ Nonsense, Jack.” he pleaded. “ Good
gad, don’t be silly about this.”
  “ I’m not,” she said. “ I’m perfectly seri-
ous, perfectly calm.”
  She laughed to prove it. Her laughter
was crystal hard. It was plain that she
was angered to the core of her heart.
  “ Jack,” he said, “ I'd give you one of
the pearls if it would buy this anger.”
  He had made a miscue.
  “Bah!” she cried at him. “Do you
think it makes any difference to me. whether
or no you trust me? Only—let us be frank
with one another! For God’s sake let us
be frank, my dear John! You think I am
a thief, the daughter of a thief. I think
as much of you. You think I am—amus-
ing; and I think that you are—only a little
too thick with your acting, John—only a
little too thick!”
  The last words were spoken through
clenched teeth. She was under the govern-
ance of the wildest passion.
  “ Jacqueline—”
  She was in such a rage that his yielding
manner threw oil on her fire.
  “ Will you leave me to be quiet in my
room?” she said. “ And stop annoying me?”
“ If only—” he began.
  “ I don’t want to talk!” cried Jacqueline.
  “ You have to listen to me, Jack! ”
  “ Not a word. If you will not leave me
in peace, then I shall leave you, do you
understand?”
  “ Jacqueline, when you are quieter—”
  “ Why, if you insist upon keeping the
room, I shall go to another place. And—”
She changed her mind about completing
the sentence which she had started and
flew out of the room, crashing the door close
behind her. And before the rapid tattoo of
her feet had died away down the hall, John
Hodge turned and walked straight to the
closet of Olivetta.
  She was prepared. Only the closing of
the door into the hall had cut down to the
point of zero her chances of escape. Yet,
when he opened the closet, jerking wide
the door, she sprang out like a little tigress,
her lips parted for the scream.
  But the sound was stillborn. If there
had lingered in her any doubt about his pos-
sible gentility it was now banished. An
iron-hard right hand darted out and the
palm was clapped across her mouth with
such force that she was half stunned.
  She found herself jerked back into his
arms and half crushed by the force with
which he held her.
  “You infernal spoil sport!” gasped John
Hodge at her ear. “ You confounded nui-
sance, if you so much as whisper do you
know what will happen? You’ll have your
throat cut! From ear to ear, you hear?
And they’ll cut mine, too!”
  He threw her away from him. She stag-

gered back against the wall, gaping and
staring at him. Her mind was refusing to
work toward the meaning of his words.
  “ Give me the pearls!”
  She could not resist. She was hypnotized
with terror and the nearness of him. She
poured into his long, extended hand the
stream of great pearls. And he dumped
them without a glance into his pocket.
  “ Now can you come with me?”
  She did not answer. There were no words
which she could find to answer with.
  “ It means, very simply,” he said, “ that
if they find you in this house, they’ll mur-
der you, my dear, and think no more about
it. Is that perfectly clear?”
  She managed to nod.
  “ Get that frozen look off your face,” he
said. “ You've got to think' faster now
than you ever did before. And you’ve got
to keep yourself under control, as you never
did before. The reason is that two lives
hang on what you do. If you're caught here
they’ll blame your coming on me. And
they’ll get rid of the two of us.”
  '* If there’s only her father here—” be-
gan the girl.
  “ They have a half dozen cutthroats in
hand, my dear, and they'd think nothing
of sending them to get us and whittle the
two of us into small bits to be sown on the
river waters. Is that plain?”
  “ Then, lock the door and start making
a noise that will bring help.”
  “ Do you think I want help brought?
Do you think that Fm mad?”
  She shrank from him, and he actually
smiled at her, so perfect was his self-control,
so deadly cold was his courage in the crisis.
  “ Follow me,” he said. “ Step as I step.
They mustn’t hear two people walking.”
  She nodded, and he turned his back on
her and led the way our of the room, walk-
ing with short, quick steps to which she
kept time softly behind him. He led down
a dark hall which smelled of the dust of
long vacancy, long lack of human care.
And, opening another door, he showed her
into a room where he switched on the light
and revealed a great bare apartment with
only a cot in one corner, a bureau in an-
other, and nothing upon floor or walls ex-
cept a single cracked mirror. There were
one or two ancient chairs, and there were
two closets, whose open doors revealed in-
teriors where only half a dozen garments
hung. A suit case had been dropped in a
corner and the dust was already whitening
on top of it.
  “ Here we are,” said John Hodge, clos-
ing the door behind them.
  She turned about and faced him again.
It was strange above all strange things that
she should be trusting to him for guidance,
or protection. And now that she was closet-
ed with him in this room, it seemed to her
that she would faint from sheer dread.
  “ Sit down!” he commanded.
  She obeyed.
  “ Now get that look out of your eyes.
I’ll promise you one thing, that Fm not go-
ing to dispose of you immediately, if that’s
what’s on your mind. I haven’t brought you
in here to murder you, my dear.”
  In spite of the peril which, it seemed,
threatened him, also, he was daring to laugh
in his grim way! She gaped at him.
  “ That’s better,” he said. “ Anything is
better than that frozen face. Turn your
head a little.”
  She obeyed. It seemed that she had no
volition saving what he poured into her from
his overpowering strength.
  “ By Jove,” he murmured, “ I hurt you
when I crashed my hand over your mouth!
I was too rough, but I hadn’t the time to be
polite. One yell from you would have sent
us both to hell. Excuse the word. Won’t
you wipe that bit of blood away?”
  Without a word, studying his face as
though the strength to raise her hand came
from his scowl, she lifted the handkerchief
and under the touch found that her lip was
a trifle sore, and wiped away a fleck of
blood. John Hodge had leaned his wide
shoulders against the wall and was scowling
down at the floor thoughtfully.
CHAPTER XXIII.
0L1VETTA CHANGES SIDES.
AT length he shrugged his shoulders and
w looked suddenly up as one who aban-
dons thought, finding it useless for
the moment. “ We may talk freely enough

for a moment or two,” he said. “ She’s
downstairs telling her father about the
pearls—just to get it out of her system and
to put me in as much danger as possible.
After that she’ll probably be a bit sorry,
for a moment or two, and she’ll come back
to tell me what she’s done and how sorry
she is. Some girls are that way. They’re
full of impulse. They act on impulse enough
to damn every one around them, and then
they’re as sorry as can be.”
  He grinned at her entirely without mirth.
“ In the first place,” he said, “ you
recognized me when you saw me on the
train?”
  She nodded, then shook her head.
  “ No?” he insisted.
  “ I—I—I only thought there was—some-
thing—”
  “ I tell you upon my word of honor,”
said John Hodge, “ that if there is any
possibility of harm coming to you in this
house, it will not come from me. Will that
help you to talk more freely?”
  She could not help but believe. Liar and
murderer and thief though she knew him
to be, yet she found herself, incredible
though it seemed, honoring and trusting him
as a harbor of refuge!
“ In the first place,” he went on, smiling
on her again, “ you must admit that I have
made you famous. You won’t deny that?”
She was beginning to find it possible to
think. Her blood again circulated.
  “ I put forward that claim to make you
a bit more at ease,” he said. “ Does it?”
'• John Hodge,” she breathed suddenly,
“ whatever you may have been in the past,
I know that you are now the only thing I
can look toward for help in this crisis. I
believe that you have told me the truth,
and that there is a mortal peril for me,
and—let’s not talk about things that have
gone before—let’s only plan how we can
best fight our way out.”
  He nodded to her, stroking his long, hard
chin in his thoughtful way.
  •' You are certainly a Trojan,” he said,
in the same mild and self-possessed fashion.
“ But at the present moment there is not
an earthly thing we can do. We might go
back to the fire escape upon which, I take
it, you came to the room of Jacqueline, but
we’d never reach the bottom of the stairs.
Never! So we might as well rest here and
wait for developments. Can you stand the
suspense?”
  She swallowed hard and nodded. “ I’ll
try,” she said faintly.
  “ And now go back to what happened
on the train. You followed your idea—that
ghost of a thought that you knew me. You
got off the subway in the same crowd with
me at One Hundred and Twenty-Eighth
Street and trailed me into a taxicab.”
  She nodded again. To her amazement,
instead of betraying vexation, he merely
rubbed his long, bony hands together and
chuckled down at her. So great was his
apparent enjoyment that he started to walk
up and down the room, still nodding and
chuckling. And as he strode to and fro,
turning swiftly at the ends of his walk, he
seemed to her more like a panther than
ever.
  “ And by the Eternal,” he went on, stop-
ping suddenly and facing her with his legs
spread far apart—“ by the Eternal, you
noted the house I went into, and came
around to try the back entrance. Good
gad—it’s almost more than I can believe,
though I have the evidence of my own eyes!
With nerve like that for a girl, if you were
a man there’d be no stopping you! There
would be absolutely no stopping you! But
tell me, were you much frightened?”
  He had drawrn a chair close to hers and
facing her. Now he sank into it and leaned
forward, bringing his face very near. She
could see that he was as excited as he was
delighted. And more and more he amazed
her; until, at last, it seemed to her that he
must have given the right explanation after
all when he confessed to Jacqueline that he
lived for the joy of danger.
  “ Yes,” she admitted. “ I was nearly
dead with fear.”
  “ But you kept on?”
  “ Yes.”
  “ What nerved you? What kept you
going?”
  She managed to meet his eye, but she
could not help flushing.
  “ Oh,” he said, “ you can talk right from
the shoulder. I know that you understand
all of my vices and crimes. And it was
THE STRANGER AT THE GATE.
277
the thought of all that I had done that
spurred you on, eh? I had done murder,
robbery in your house where you took me in
as a guest, and I had wound up the deal
by attacking your father with mysterious
intent!”
  He broke into a soundless chuckling once
more, but stopped this to continue: “ It
was that which kept you going, when you
were about to sink with fear. By the Lord,
I admire you with all my soul!”
  He stopped short.
  “ Did you hear much of our talk—Jac-
queline’s and mine?”
  “ From the time vou came into the room.
Yes.”
  “ You were there that long?”
  He snapped his fingers in his vexation.
“ But let it go. It can’t be helped. As a
matter of fact, the one thing that's kept
my skin whole in this house has been the
interest that Jacqueline takes in me, do you
understand?”
   “ Yes,” said Olivetta faintly.
  His embarrassment grew; he cleared his
throat: he looked down to the floor.
  “ Let me try to explain more in detail,”
he went on. “ You know that recently it
has been necessary for me to lead a rather
secluded life, to put it mildly.”
   “ Yes,” said Olivetta.
  And through her mind swept some im-
ages from the crowded mass of headlines
and advertisements which had to do with
the chase of John Hodge and the rewards
offered for his apprehension. Yes, there
were certainly reasons why he must keep
in seclusion.
  “ So that, as a matter of fact,” said John
Hodge, “ if I should cut loose from this
one last harbor which remains to me, I
should be running my head into the noose.
The chances would be about five to one
against me. I might fool the people for a
time with disguises of one sort or another,
but in the end some one would be very apt
to run me to the earth, just as you have
done. Though, by Heaven, I think that
there are fewer brains in the list of men
I’ve known than there are in the detective
brain of Miss Dascom. But you follow my
drift—it is life for me in this house or
death outside of it!”
  “ Yes, yes! But—”
   “ You are going to tell me,” he smiled at
her, “ that you’re sorry you ran me to the
ground? Tut, tut! I’m a sufficiently good
sportsman to give you all the credit due for
the excellent game you have played and
the way you have played it. But to come
around to the main thing I’m trying to ex-
plain: Jacqueline is a charming girl—in
ways. But her father is an abysmal brute.
The one thing that has kept his cudgel from
my sconce has been Jacqueline. And the
instant that Jacqueline loses interest in me,
I’m a goner. And she will lose interest, I
fear, the instant she discovers that there is a
girl in this room. Does it begin to clear up
the situation for you?”
  “ Yes, I begin to see. But surely she
knows—”
  “ That you have been trailing me in the
name of the law? It will be hard for her
to understand that. If she finds that I am
protecting you—you see? In short, Jac-
queline has to think that I’m prodigiously
fond of her—”
   He paused, quite red in the face.
   “ I think,” said Olivetta, “ that that, is
a part you can quite easily play.”
  “ Ah, yes,” answered John Hodge in an
oddly submissive way, “ I suppose you feel
that you have a right to say that. Some
time—but let it go, again. I can’t hope to
explain. It's all too much of a confounded
muddle, just now. It bewilders even me, at
times. Only—if the pinch should come and
I should have to talk to Jacqueline as
though I were devilishly fond of her—”
   “ I shall understand,” said Olivetta, and
she flushed in turn.
  “ There is one thing more I am going to
tell you, though I can’t expect that you
will either understand or believe. And it is
this: I did not kill Sam Logan; I did not
attack your father to do him any physical
injury, no matter what he may say; and,
thirdly, the Sheik I can be said to have
stolen for a sufficient reason—that it be-
longs to me! ”
  So saying, he turned his back squarely
upon her and walked to the window.
There was an interval during which she
stared at his wide shoulders, tapering down
to the lean, narrow hips.
278
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  He whirled upon her.
  “ It seems impossible to you?” he de-
manded.
  She did not answer.
  “ Very well. But just keep a shadow of
doubt in your mind until the time comes
when I can try to explain. As for nearly
everything I have told you, I freely admit
that they were lies. All that stuff about the
Red Captain and old Hallyt being the same
Was, of course, just bunk. But these three
things are true. I’ll try to prove ’em later
on. Just now I think I’ll have my hands
full with quite another problem.”
  He raised a bony forefinger as he spoke.
A heavy footfall was creaking up the
stairs. And now it beat out squeaks and
groans from the flooring of the upper hall.
  “ That’s her father,” said John Hodge;
and it seemed to Olivetta that he lost color
a little as he spoke. “ It’s not an easy job
to persuade him of anything except what he
wants to believe. I’m going to ask you to
go into that closet. And wait there quietly.
No matter what he does, don’t be too fright-
ened- Sometimes his words are a bit worse
than his actions—though often his thunder
and lightning go together.”
  As he spoke he had opened a door to the
closet and was waving her toward it. She
paused an instant as she was stepping in.
  “ Not for my sake only, but for your
sake, too,” she said, “ oh, John Hodge, I
wish you another victory!”
  And so she stepped on into the solid
blackness of the closet, and the last that
she saw of his face was a look of blank
wonder, shot through with joy.
CHAPTER XXIV.
BEFORE THE STORM.
A PONDEROUS blow crashed against
the door of the room. Olivetta,
huddled into the black corner of the
closet, craned her head into the white wedge
of light that struck in—for the door was
left a trifle ajar. But she could only see
John Hodge turn toward the sound.
  “Hello, Hodge!” called a thick, deep
voice from the interior of the hall.
  “ Hello,” said Hodge. “ Come in, Tom.”
  The door was thrown open with a bang
and closed with equal violence. A wheezing
man whose immense bulk she could sense
by the quiver of the floor beneath his tread,
made a step or two into the interior of the
room.
  “ This,” said Tom, “ is a hell of a hole.
Come down below, Hodge, and get into a
comfortable chair. I got a few things to
say to you.”
  “ Why not here,” said Hodge. “ Be-
sides, I’m about to turn in. Fire away,
governor, and you can shoot as straight
here as you can below.”
  Tom grunted in response, grumbled
words which were lost in a thick blending
together, and then advanced across the
apartment and finally sat down in a chair
well within the rectangle of Olivetta’s vi-
sion. She glimpsed his profile as he went
by—and there was nothing about it to in-
dicate that this was the father of pretty
Jacqueline. His features were small, and
apparently they had been further reduced
by heavy battering, so that the profile was
little more than a straight line, slightly dim-
pled. The bulge of the scowling brows was
well nigh as large as the nose, or the great,
out-thrusting lower jaw. He was plainly
a man made for conflict.
  The lean and active muscles of youth
had been clothed, to be sure, with outer
layers of fat, but fat, in turn, must have
been converted into flesh, and from flesh
to muscle. For, wide and round as he was,
he seemed as hard as iron. Even the flesh
of his face was hard. The drink-reddened
cheeks seemed covered with a colored leath-
er. When he sat down, his back was to-
ward Olivetta, but the back was hardly less
imposing than the side view.
  He was poised gingerly upon the chair,
with his feet drawn well back to the side,
so that he could support his bulk upon
them, if need were. And he overflowed the
chair in all directions, just as his great neck
overflowed the white, shining collar with
which he was so absurdly throttled. He
looked as though he must be between forty-
five and fifty, strong as Hercules, and a
fighter for the love of pure battle.
  Opposite him, and facing the closet
where she watched, was John Hodge, a lithe

and ineffectually slender figure, in compari-
son. But there was that in his lounging
carelessness which was hardly less formid-
able than the downright bulk of Tom, when
one regarded the pair in contrast for a
time.
  “ My girl’s been down talking,” said
Tom, by way of introduction.
  “ Yes?” queried John Hodge politely.
  “ Sure,” said Tom. “ When a girl gets
mad she tells everything she knows. And
Jack has been down chattering a lot about
your pearls.”
  “ She seemed to admire them,” said John
Hodge. “ Was that what brought you up
here, Tom?”
  “ Fact is,” said Tom, rolling his bulk a
little in the chair; “ fact is that you’re a
fool to keep them pearls rolling around
loose the way you do, Hodge.”
  “ I haven’t kept them rolling around so
loose,” said Hodge. “ Matter of fact,
there’s only one person in the house that's
seen them—Jacqueline.”
  “ What sort of puzzles me,” said Tom,
and his great voice here rolled out into a
great volume under it, choked the room
with his thunder; “what sort of puzzles
me is that you’d trust a girl before you’d
trust a man like me. Ain’t all women fools,
Hodge?”
  “ In part, I suppose,” said Hodge, smil-
ing.
  “ But look here, Hodge, ain’t I been a
friend to you? Ain’t I acted the part of a
man that can be trusted?”
“ You’ve given me a place to live,” said
Hodge, “ but I think I’ve paid you for it.”
“ Paid?” cried Tom. “ Can a man be
paid for keeping the neck of another man
from stretching?”
  “ Ah,” said Hodge, “ is that it? Is that
in your head, Tom?”
  “ And why not? I’m not a fool, Hodge.
I know what I’m doing for you!”
  “ When I dragged you out of the river
like a half dead rat a few years back,” said
John Hodge, “ I knew what I was doing
also!”
  Olivetta, gasping at his cool imperti-
nence, wondered if this were the proper way
to conciliate the big man.
  “ That’s old stuff,” said Tom. “ That’s
damned old stuff. I pretty near forgot
about it!”
  “ But at the end of three years,” said
Hodge, “ do you expect that I shall have
forgotten about what you’re doing for me
now, Tom?”
  “ The point is,” said Tom, “ that you
ain’t treated Jacqueline right. You sure
been talking rough to her, or she never
would of come down to me like she done.”
“ Nonsense,” said John Hodge, setting
his teeth. “ Do you think that I'm a fool,
Tom? Do you think that I'd dare to of-
fend her in this house if I could help it?
Why, man, I know what you could do. I
know the fellows you have at your beck
and call. I know that I’d be helpless if
you saw fit to close your hand over me! ”
This speech seemed to greatly pacify the
big man. He leaned back in his chair,
which creaked as though it were on the
very verge of crashing to the floor under
its burden.
  “ You got a lot of sense in you, Hodge,”
he said. “ That’s why it looks so damn
queer to me that you ain't got the sense to
let me shove those pearls of yours into the
safe. They’d ride there as safe as daisies,
wouldn’t they?”
  He broke off this proposal to fall into a
violent fit of coughing, which was no doubt
assumed to save his expression. John
Hodge looked squarely at his host, nodding
as though he seriously considered the offer.
  “ Couldn't think of letting you do that,
Tom,” he said. “ It’s bad enough for you
to be taking me on here as a roomer. But
if they should grab me here you could say
that you never saw me except on the day
when I hired the room, and that was a
dark day of a thunderstorm.”
  He shook his head in an increased vio-
lence.
  “ But if they found the pearls in the
safe—why, it would be all up with you.
They’d give you a sentence, at your time
of life, which would mean prison the rest
of your days.”
  Tom showed no determination to follow
up this tack. He merely sighed and began
to stir restlessly in his chair.
  “ I might as well be going down,” he
said, “ if you ain’t going to see reason.”
280
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  “ About the pearls?”
  “ Them and Jack and—why, Hodge,
she's terrible fond of you. I never seen her
take to anybody the way she’s taken to
you. Most of the boys, why, she simply
passes ’em the icy mitt and can’t see ’em
inside of a mile. You know that. You’re
making a bum play to kid her like you been
doing, Hodge. Arid if I believed the half
of what she’s been telling me—why, you
and me couldn’t come to no agreement by
just talk, after that! It’d take a pile
more’n talk!”
  “ You wait till there’s a real reason,”
said Hodge. “ She’s talking through her
hat, just now.”
  “ I’ll be going down below,” said Tom.
and heaved his bulk out of the squeaking
chair.
  He strode out of the line of Olivetta’s
sight. Then he paused again.
  “ But you might give me a look at them
pearls,” he said, “ after Jack’s been telling
me about them. There ain’t no harm in a
look, I guess. Am I right. Hodge?”
  For. the least fraction of a second John
Hodge hesitated. Then he scooped out the
jewels from his pocket.
  “ No harm at all,” he said.
  He held them up so that the electric light
glimmered over them, and Tom came sud-
denly back and bowed his misshapen head
over the treasure.
  “My God!” breathed Tom, stepping
back at last. “ My God, Hodge, you’re
rich—you're rich as hell!”
  He came closer again.
  “ F’you mind me just taking them in my
hand?” he said with something childlike in
his whispering voice.
  They were poured into his great cupped
hands. And he began shifting them so that
different lights might fall upon them.
  “ They’d be breaking the heart of one
of these millionaire’s wives, I guess,” he
said. “ I can see her putting them around
her throat, Hodge. God, how they’d look
against the throat and the breast of one of
them beauties!”
  “ They’re turning you into a poet,” said
Hodge, smiling, and slapping the other on
the shoulder.
  At the blow his landlord started violently
and glared at Hodge as though roughly
awakened from delightful dreams to brutal
commonplace.
  “Take ’em!” he gasped. “Take ’em
back, Hodge!”
  He fairly thrust them into the hands of
John Hodge and then turned his back and
lurched out of the room with his peculiar
and clumsy gait. The door banged behind
him, and his noisy tread went off down the
hall.
  John Hodge opened the closet door.
  “ You’re saved, then!” breathed Olivetta.
“ But, oh, how could you face that terrible
man?”
  “ You really think we’re through the
pinch?” he asked curiously.
  She looked more closely at him. He was
worn and gray.
  “ Aren't you?”
  “ We’re lost,” he said. “ There’s not a
ghost of a hope for us now, unless the girl—
no, she’s out of it now. Even Jack couldn’t
save us. I knew it the minute he asked
to see the pearls. There was no way to
refuse him. And yet, once he had seen them
the wolf came up in him and looked out
at his eyes. He’ll never sleep till he has
those pearls. And—listen!”
  He glided to the door and turned the key
softly in the lock. An instant later the knob
of the door was wrenched violently over and
the whole door shook under a sudden pres-
sure!
CHAPTER XXV.
THE TRAP.
JOHN HODGE turned to Olivetta with a
pointing finger and a half rueful, half
sardonic smile, as though to say that the
danger he had prophesied had already come.
  “ Hello, Hodge,” called a voice from the
hall, a voice which was carefully smoothed,
but in which the snarl of disappointment
could not be quite kept down. “ Let me
in, will you? What’s the idea of locking
the door?”
  “ Who’s with you?” countered Hodge.
There was an instant of silence. Then
the answer, in tones still more sullen: “ No-
body’s here but me.”
THE STRANGER AT THE GATE.	281
  Hodge laughed.
  “ You’ve some sort of a joke up your
sleeve, Billy,” he said. “ I heard two of
you coming up the hall.”
  Another one of those ominous little si-
lences followed. Then, with a frank savag-
ery: “You got the ears of a cat, Hodge.
And if you got the claws of a cat maybe you
can scratch your way out of this hole, eh?”
It was the declaration of war. And im-
mediately upon its heels, a heavy weight
crashed against the door and made it sag
in. Yet it held, and the sudden echo struck
through the distant rooms of the house.
  “ If you do that again,” said John Hodge,
“ I’ll drive a pair of bullets through the
door, Billy. I hate to be bothered like
this, and if you keep nagging me, I’ll send
a couple of you to hell! ”
  “ Listen to the damn dude,” said one of
those in the hall. “ We’ll tear your hide
off for that, you swine!”
  Another voice boomed suddenly down
the hall.
  “ Here, here! What in hell is all this?
Get out of my way! W:hat you trying to
do to Hodge? Ain’t he my friend? I’ll
be learning a couple of you boys some les-
sons in good manners if you bother him.”
  It was Tom again, and his heavy, lurch-
ing step could be traced in its progress to-
ward the door, while the men greeted him
with sullen grumblings.
  “ Hello, John,” called Tom. “ Open up
the door I’ll find out what’s been in the
minds of these blockheads and skin a couple
of ’em for it.”
“ Show me their skins when you’re
through with them,” said Hodge, “ and I’ll
open the door to you. That’s a bargain.”
“ What are you after, Hodge?” roared
the giant.
  “ It’s no good, Tom,” said Hodge. “ No
good at all. I won’t open the door, and if
you try to break it down I’ll stick a chunk
of lead through the wood. I mean it, too.”
A wild burst of cursing roared from the
throat of Tom. He threw away the last
pretense with an open threat.
  “ You’re going to try a hard hand with
me, kid? Why, I’ll bust you in two. I’ll
get you, Hodge, and get everything you
have. Do you hear?”
  But John Hodge turned from the door
with a shrug of his shoulders. In vain
Tom bellowed in the hall his reproaches for
the “ ingratitude ” of Hodge. He got no
answer, and with a final declaration that
Hodge would be starved until he was a sick
dog and gave in, the big man and his fol-
lowers departed, all save one who was told
to stay behind and was noisily instructed to
blow the head off any one who attempted
to leave the room.
  John Hodge came back and stood before
Olivetta.
  “ When I was at your house,” he whis-
pered, “ I heard some one talked about
the way you could handle a revolver. Was
that true? Are you a good shot?”
  “ Fairly good.”
  “ Then take this.”
  He pushed a long thirty-eight into her
hands.
  “ W'hat does that leave you?”
  “ Nothing but my hands.” He held them
up grimly, and moved the fingers a little
in a way that made her blood run cold.
“ But they’re better than a gun to me,”
he said. “ I can’t hit the side of a wall
with powder and lead. You can do better
than that, I hope.”
  She nodded. It was so unnatural for this
big fellow to whisper that the sibilant sound
of it put her nerves on edge with a greater
fear than ever.
  “ You really mean it?” she murmured.
  He nodded.
  “ And you want me to use it—when—
when—”
  “ Whenever you please," he said. “ The
gang of men in this house are a hardy crew.
If you can get rid of a few of them you’ll
be doing a service to society. I’ve heard
them talk. I’ve heard of the things they’ve
done. There’s not a one of them that
doesn’t deserve hanging and that probably
won’t get it sooner or later. That’s why
I say to shoot and shoot to kill when you
get the chance. And keep in mind that if
they have the chance, they’ll shoot just as
straight at you as though you were a man.
I know their kind!”
  She turned in her hands the cold steel
mechanism. Then she balanced it and took
the butt in a firm grip. It was heavier than
282
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
the weapons to which she was accustomed,
but the balance was good and by maintain-
ing a strong hold on it, she should be able
to shoot well.
  “ I’ll do exactly as you want,” said Oli-
vetta. “ I’ll shoot to kill!”
  Something about her expression made him
wince, and she heard him murmur to him-
self: “ Poor child!” She wondered at that,
but there were so many sudden changes, so
many unexplained phases to John Hodge,
that she no longer tried to understand every-
thing he did.
  “ Let me tell you this,” he said, still in
the cautious whisper which they were forced
to use, “ that even if I had done all the
things you think I have done, the thing
which would most damn me would be be-
cause my affair has dragged you into this
hole!”
  But Olivetta shook her head.
  “ No,” she said thoughtfully, “ that isn’t
fair. I started out to trail you, John Hodge.
And if I could, I would have turned you
over to the police. But instead I was drawn
into the trap. And you saved me, after
I’d compromised you. If I had not come
to-night you’d be in no danger. You’d
be—smoking cigarettes with Jacqueline
right now!”
  She managed the faintest of smiles. John
Hodge seemed greatly moved.
  “ Good God,” he breathed, “ what a great
hearted girl you are! But I’ll talk no more
about regrets. We’ll look only one way,
and that’s toward the possibilities of getting
away.”
  “ From the window—” she suggested.
  “ There’s no way down from that. Oh,
when they gave me this room I took stock
of it, you may be sure. There’s a narrow
ledge running past the window, but only a
circus performer could walk on it. That’s
the only possible exit. And there’s no
chance of getting in help. If we start a
clamor, there’s no one in this block of
houses to hear, and there are empty lots
behind the house.
  “ But even if we should be heard, it
would be too late. If it were the last thing
that Tom Lanier were capable of, he would
knock in the door to finish the man who
betrayed his hiding place. For this house
is almost as precious as life to Tom. He's
been condemned to death three times, and
three times he’s broken away only to be
caught, tried under another name in an-
other country, and held again. But this
time he’s hidden himself safely away for
months in this house, and be believes that
his luck is tied up with it. If we raised a
racket that would bring the police here,
they’d find empty rooms except for the
one that held our bodies. I know honest
Tom!”
  “ Then—what can we do?” gasped Oli-
vetta.
  “ I don’t know—I honestly don’t know.
I see no hope.”
  Panic rushed through her brain.
  “ There must be some way out,” whis-
pered Olivetta.
  He stepped close to her with a look of the
greatest anxiety.
  “ You understand,” he said, “ that I'm
not holding out on account of the pearls.
If they would buy us freedom I’d give them
in an instant. But they wouldn't count. If
Tom Lanier takes the pearls, he takes my
life with them—he would be a fool not to,
now that he has the opportunity. And if
he finishes me, he finishes off the only other
witness, no matter whether it’s a man or a
woman. I’ve heard that great beast of a
man talk before now. I’ve heard him
say that the trouble with most criminals
is that they stop halfway in their crimes.
As for his own methods, they are the height
of thoroughness.”
  She made a little gesture of resignation.
Then she leaned back against the wall with
her arms folded, for it seemed that her
heart would thunder its way out of her
body.
  At last, “ Is there water in the room?”
she asked.
  “Here!” he said hastily, and stepped
to a wash basin in the corner. But when
he turned the tap the water did not flow.
  “ They’ve cut us off from the water line,”
he said. “ That’s Tom Lanier again. He
loses no time. He knows food is nothing—
water is the quick finisher.” He came back
to her. “ God knows how sorry I am! ” he
said.
  She was sick at heart. Her knees were

283
shaking under her weight. She wanted to
drop to the floor and pray and weep and
cry out to the brutal guard beyond the
door for mercy. But the watching eye of
this man who leaned above her held her
together. She could not weaken while he
was there looking on.
  “ Listen to me,” she said, and the effort
(to control her emotion made her voice
hard and dry. “ We haven’t time to accuse
each other of what’s past. Please believe
that I’m thinking only of this moment and
none other. And — and — But there’s
something at the window!”
  For there had come a light scratching
sound just outside the window, and it un-
nerved Olivetta and sent her cowering back
in the comer of the room. There, with
staring eyes, and with the revolver leveled,
she waited for the first stir of the lowered
pane, ready to shoot. John Hodge stepped
to the side of the room; he paused with
lowered head by the window, listening, and
at that moment there was a light, furtive
tapping at the pane.
  For an instant he hesitated, seeming to
doubt whether he should signal to the girl
to shoot or else wait for a more definite
proof tliat there was some one just outside
the window. But finally he did neither. He
gripped the lower sash of the window and
thtew it up. It revealed a glimmering bit of
white paper hanging at the end of a cord
which was weighted down with a pencil.
CHAPTER XXVI.
“ ONLY ONE CHANCE.”
JOHN HODGE caught at the paper and
brought it in. Instantly the upper end
of the string was loosed and came flut-
tering in to the room. He lowered the sash
again, and, unfolding the paper eagerly,
read the contents and then passed it without
a word to Olivetta.
  The paper was thin, the writing had been
done with an indelible pencil, the impression
being very faint on the smooth surface, and
the writing was crowded together closely.
It was by no means the sort of hand she
would have expected to come from Jacque-
line Lanier, and yet it was from her.
  “ Dear John,” ran the letter, “ I don’t
know what strange devil came into my
head and made me do the terrible thing.
But I have done it. And now I am sitting
in my room, above yours, and wondering
how I can undo the harm I have done.”
  Here she looked up from the writing and
watched John Hodge standing patiently on
the farther side of the room, studying a
problem which seemed difficult of solution.
The letter went on:
  “ It was the thought that you had only
been playing with me that drove me mad.
It seemed to me that you had been jesting
from the first—and I had taken your friend-
ship seriously. But now I know that I must
have been wrong.
  “ At least, I want to try to make up for
what I have done. And I think I can. First
I’ll tell you exactly what I’ve done. I must
do that before you will trust me. And if
you don’t trust me, there is no way in
which 1 can now be of help to you.
  “ I went down to father in the first rage.
I found him in the dumps, his arras folded
on a table, his head on his arms. I should
have known better than to tell him any
exciting news when he was in such a mood;
but, before I knew it, I had told the whole
story of what I had seen.
  “ And from the expression on his face I
knew that I had said too much. He lis-
tened like a starved man. He began to
moisten his lips and smile in a peculiar,
starved way. He went up to see you at
once. What he said to you I don’t know.
But when he came back I knew, by the
first glance at his face, that he had seen the
pearls.
  “ He went to work at once. He called
up the boys from below. He told them
•that they were to get at you, and that if
they did ‘ finish ’ you there would be a
richer haul than all the hauls they had ever
made before rolled into one. Then he told
them what to do, and they started for your
room.
  “ I had had a chance to cool off by that
time. I tried to change his mind, but it
was too late. Nothing that I could do would
save you, if I had to rely on persuasion. I
waited in a cold terror until I heard that
they had failed to get into your room. I

suppose that something father said made
you suspect, and you were on your guard
when they came for you.
  “ By that time I had thought of the only
way in which you could escape. Even that
way is dangerous. But I’ve come to offer
it, John, if you will trust me to help you.
Simply wave your hand out of the window,
and I shall lower a rope to you. You will
find it knotted so that you can easily climb
up. And from this room you’ll have an
even chance of slipping out of the house
without being seen.
  “ John, 1 know that I have thrown you
into this danger, but trust me to take you
out of it again!
                            “ Jack.”
  She lowered the letter and looked across
the room to John Hodge.
   “ There is a hope, then! ” she breathed.
  “ I wonder,” mused John Hodge. “ The
chances, I think, are about two in ten.
But shall we take them, even so?”
  “ Yes, yes! Anything to make a start.
Without water—why, we’d die in three
days, if they cared to keep us here as long
as that. Once in that room—”
  “ Ah, if we could reach that room.
But—”
  “ But with a knotted rope—surely you
can climb it, and I know that I can manage
some way to get up it.”
  “ If the rope holds, yes.”
   “ If it holds?”
  “ Aye, don’t you see that that’s the only
dubious point? But of course you don’t
see. You cannot conceive what goes on in-
side the brain of that girl. She looks dif-
ferent enough, but there’s very little of her
father that isn’t in her. Clever and shrewd,
suspicious and cunning, revengeful as the
very devil, cruel as a witch when she’s an-
gered—that’s what Jacqueline is. I’ve had
a rare opportunity to study her, and though
I’ve only had a few days, I’ve found those
things in her.
  “ She likes me fairly well, simply be-
cause she thinks that I have been com-
pletely blinded by her little tricks. If she
thought I knew her for what she is, the dear
girl would slip a knife into roe and kiss her
hand to me as I went out to sea. That, very
much in brief, is my lady Jacqueline.”
  “But do you actually think—” gasped
Olivetta.
  “ That she would wait until I was nearly
to the top, and then cut the rope and drop
me a few stories down to the hard pave-
ment below? I don’t know, in fact. I may
as well tell you what I tried to hint at a
while ago. I have tried to make Jacqueline
think that I was about to become her en-
tirely blinded admirer. If she believes that
I am sincere, she may attempt the rescue in
good faith. But if she really believes that
I have not been truthful, she’ll cut the rope
and let me go.”
  He made a gesture to indicate the drop.
“ It would smash a man, a fall like that.
A gunshot through the head couldn’t be
more fatal. And after I’m up, even sup-
posing that I get there, it might not be so
extremely simple to handle her and keep
her silent while you climb the rope after
me. You begin to see the difficulties?”
Olivetta, appalled, reviewed them in her
mind. But she was very young, she was
very strong, she had within her a wealth
of. unspent adventure. Moreover, in John
Hodge she saw the very spirit of invincible
strength and courage. Thief and murderer
he might be—yes, she had reason to feel
confident that he was—but he was also
capable of being a matchless gentleman,
thinking only of the woman who was with
him, even if it were she who had drawn
all this peril on his head. In these last
few moments his ugly, hawklike face had
become almost handsome in her eyes.
  “ It only seems to me,” she said, “ that
there is really nothing else to do. Am I
wrong?”
  “ Unless the police should come on the
trail of Tom Lanier or of John Hodge—
and so liberate us.”
  “ And so bring you to prison?”	*
  “ That’s a danger of the future, and the
future is a very dim thing. Our present
danger is a concrete fact. But I truly be-
lieve that the odds are against the police
finding me here, or finding Tom Lanier.
He has stayed here several months. Why
should he be trailed here now? It would
be entirely too improbable.”
  “ Then you think we should go?”
  “ If we try to climb that rope,” he said
THE STRANGER AT THE GATE.	283
slowly, “ I know that we shall risk our lives.
And yet if we stay here—”
   “ It’s just the same risk, isn’t it?’’
Suddenly he struck the back of his hand
across his eyes.
  “ I see you swinging up there in the
middle of sick, thin space, and it takes the
heart out of me. Gad, it makes me weak! ”
She stared at him. And it seemed to
her that if ever she had seen sincerity
stamped deep in the features of a man, she
could see it now stamped on the face of
this tall John Hodge, that lean and ugly
face as he bent above her.
  Then. “ But you’re right,” he said.
“ You’re entirely right. There’s only one
chance, and we must take it. If it were
any other place, if they were any other
men, I should take the chance alone and
leave you here, knowing that a woman
would be safe. But in this house—no, no,
you must come with me. If anything
should happen to you—but nothing shall
happen, nothing shall happen, God help-
ing!”
  And again a quiver of wonder ran
through all of her nerves. Indeed, he
seemed sincere, he must be sincere, unless
some devil kept him acting with a consum-
mate skill up to the very last moment.
  “ You see,” she said gently, “ I take the
risk of my own free will.”
  “ I know', I knowr—well, we’ll forget the
rest.”
  He took her hand and crushed it between
both of his, and both his strong hands were
trembling.
  “ If only I had not come! ” she said. “ If
only I had let you go!”
  “ But do you really wish that? Well,
I don’t. All the danger that comes to a
man—that’s fate. But the happiness is
another matter. And I’ve found some hap-
piness out of your coming. When you first
came, you looked on me as a sort of cold-
blooded devil, isn’t that true? But if we
come through this safe and sound, I think
you’ll have a slightly different feeling about
me. Is that true? A feeling that I am at
least not so bad as some men, eh? A feel-
ing, let me say, that I can admire grit, and
pay homage to a girl with courage!”
  She found herself listening after he had
stopped speaking, as she might have lis-
tened to music, too delightful to have end-
ed. And she roused herself with an effort.
It was the old story ; the moment she came
near this man she was drawn mightily to-
ward him. Her reason could not keep her
at arm’s distance.
  John Hodge had gone to the window and
raised the sash softly. She saw him lean
out, and looking up, wave his hand in a
broad gesture into the night, and as he
did so, a twining length of rope dropped
past him and was swept into the room as
he straightened again.
  His gesture brought Olivetta on hasty
tiptoe.
  “ It’s strong enough,” he said, and he
tested the rope with a great tug of his
hands. “ It will carry our weight unless
she does something to it above—or unless
her father is in the room with her. In
that case we’ll get quickly what otherwise
would have been delayed and prefixed with
a long agony. Are you sure that you can
climb?”
  “ When I was a youngster I used to
climb. I still can manage it.”
  “ I could draw' you up, but I shall prob-
ably have my hands too full with her, try-
ing to keep her quiet while you climb.
Wait for a moment or two after you see me
disappear into the window above, if I can
reach it at all, and then start yourself.”
  So saying, he stood up on the sill of the
window, reached up as high on the rope as
he could, and with his first effort, swung a
yard or more clear of the wall of the house.
CHAPTER XXVII.
THE ALARM.
SHE saw him swing hand over hand up
the rope with an incredible display of
strength and agility, while the rope
swung wildly back and forth. Below' was
a great black pit with an unseen bottom.
  Then, out of the blackness above, ap-
peared the dim pallor of a voice. She heard
a whisper of encouragement. Pale hands
went out toward the climber, and seemed
to help him in his last upward effort. And
so he was brought to the sill of the win-

clow above, ana an instant later disappeared
into the interior.
  That was not all. The rope swung trem-
bling back and forth. Once its knotted end
actually struck against her cheek. But
then it was whisked away and withdrawn
completely from her reach.
  Olivetta leaned recklessly out and
watched that last hope swept away. And,
with a sick falling of the heart, ail of her
former doubts of John Hodge poured back
over her. There was some magic in the
actual presence of the man that kept her
from distrusting him after the first mo-
ments. But now her last frail hope of es-
cape was gone. He had caught it up with
a consummate selfishness and left her to
whatever might come.
  He had made only one mistake. He had
left her his revolver. And if they rushed
the room they would meet with a grim re-
ception. She looked desperately around
the room. How blank and empty it was,
how utterly devoid of hope since he had
gone! Then, glancing back to the win-
dow, she saw the dark and serpentine length
of the rope dangling and twining back on
itself there.
  It was a glorious good sight to Olivetta.
She reached the window in one flurry of
haste and caught at the rope. She gripped
it so hard that the harsh fibers bit into her
palm. And now, leaning out and looking
up again, she saw the rope quiver in a
solid, straight line, while from the window
above it seemed to her that she heard a
light scuffling sound.
  That was all she waited for. She climbed
hastily onto the sill of the window, just as
John Hodge had done. But she crouched
there and hesitated. Below her the void of
blackness began to stir, as it were, and open
enough to show her the dizzy distance to
the ground. And the trembling rope was
fragile, indeed, as a support.
  More than that, it was many a year since
she had climbed a rope. There had been
a time, in that wild girlhood of hers, when
she would have thought no more than a
sailor going up this rope as handily as John
Hodge, well nigh. Those were times when
she had been able to swing like a veritable
monkey through the trees, from branch to
branch, the delight and the admiration of
the boys with whom she played. They
had been stronger, but none had been so
daring.
  Even now, when she remembered, there
came again a faint pang like an echo of
that great pain with which she had come
to know that she must be only a woman,
with all of a woman’s limitations. With a
sigh of fear and of grief and of amusement,
she reached up. But when her hands set-
tled on the rope, each clutching a knot, all
was banished except her fear. Would
there be sufficient strength in her arms to
sustain her?
  She closed her eyes and let her weight
fall forward. Blindly she swung out on the
rope. It seemed that she would never
cease swaying out. And she began to spin
on the rope. The fear was turning her
muscles to water. Her wrists shook. The
fingers grew numb and weak, and she felt
her hold slipping.
  Then she opened her eyes and saw, far
above, the glittering of the stars. And, in-
stantly, she began to fight her way up the
rope.
  A danger met and struggled against, she
discovered, became less paralyzing than one
in the presence of which she had been trem-
bling. The rough rope burned her hands,
but in her arms, made strong by swinging
a golf club and swimming, drew her up
with difficulty but steadily enough. And
when she wearied, a little below reaching
distance of the window sill above her, she
twisted her slim ankles into the rope and
let her weight rest in that fashion.
  Then she resumed the work until she
could swing a hand in and grasp the sill,
then the other arm followed: she was drawn
up to the level of the sill and then swung
through and stood, at last, panting on the
floor, safe for that moment, at least.
  In a farther corner of the room she saw
John Hodge busily at work bandaging the
arms of a woman behind her back, a woman
already gagged. At that instant he ended
his task and lowered the helpless form to
the floor. He leaned a moment over it.
  “ I don’t like to do it, Jack,” he was
whispering. “ By the Lord, it goes against
the grain. But I knew that the moment
THE STRANGER AT THE GATE.	287
you saw another person coming up that
rope, particularly if it were a woman, you’d
raise the roof and have that light-handed
father of yours upon us in a twinkling.
That’s why I’ve had to do this. But be-
sides, this will be a lot better for you. If
they find you bound and gagged they’ll
never dream that you’ve actually helped
me to escape. And as for the girl—they’ll
never know, I trust, that she was in the
house!”
  The wild, bright eyes of the captive
blazed up at him, but she made no struggle.
  “ Good-by, Jack,” said John Hodge,
stepping back and waving to her. “ Good-
by, and better luck next time.”
  He motioned to Olivetta. They stole to
the door which opened upon the hall.
  “ There are two- ways out now,” he whis-
pered softly. “ But first, wait here until
you’ve stopped breathing so hard. It was a
stiff pull to get up the rope?”
  She nodded, drawing in great breaths.
  “ There’s time enough. We’ll let you
quiet down. And then we’ll start. But
as I was saying, there are two ways out.
One is down the fire escape, the way you
came up. But I think the chances are
that old fox, Tom Lanier, is probably keep-
ing a guard on that, just in case things
should come to the present pass. I say, I
think that the odds are ten to one that he’s
having the fire escape watched. And if he
is, we’re both hopelessly trapped if we try
to go down it.
  “ There’s another way, and that’s to go
straight down the stairs and out of the
house by the front door. Nobody will be
watching that way out, I’m sure. At least,
there’s a chance that’s worth gambling on,
I think. Once we get past the hall below,
where the guard is waiting, we’d have clear
sailing. Will you have the nerve to go down
that way? You won’t break down?”
  She shook her head. Her heart was thun-
dering, but she would not admit her fear.
It was better to go on in his guidance, doing
blindly what he told her to do. He had
already brought her to the threshold of es-
cape, she felt.
  He waited, watching her a moment. At
length he nodded.
  “ I think we may make the attempt now.
And so—we'll make a prayer for good luck
and go ahead!”
  So saying, he opened the door and
stepped boldly out into the hall. Olivetta,
following, felt her breath taken as though
she had plunged into icy water. But she
went on behind him. And now she remem-
bered that when she started to climb the
rope she had left behind her the unneces-
sary weight of the revolver—unnecessary
then, but how vital now!
  Even in her anxiety she could find time
to wonder at the stealthy silence of the
movements of John Hodge. The big man
stalked down the hall before her, fairly dis-
solving into the darkness of the passageway
without leaving a trace of noise behind him.
She herself, with all her advantage of a
lighter weight, could not avoid slight whis-
pering sounds, slight creakings.
  And the difficulties of proceeding noise-
lessly were redoubled when they reached the
stairway, for here even John Hodge made
some noise and she herself stopped time
and again, crouching in horror at the
squeaking of the boards under foot. But
never once did he turn to her with a cau-
tioning gesture!
  And so they reached the bottom of that
flight. And here he held up a hand to keep
her back. She stopped, and looking back,
she wondered at the shortness of the de-
scent, for there had been a year of dread
in it.
  “ Listen,” murmured John Hodge.
  She threw her whole heart into the effort,
and above them she heard an irregular and
rapid beating, a sort of heavy flutter of
sound.
  “ It’s Jacqueline fighting to get free,”
whispered Hodge. “ Little tigress—she’ll
probably succeed before long. I hadn’t the
heart to sink the cords into her as far as
they should have gone. She’ll work out of
them. But the guard has heard already,
and he’s coming to investigate what’s caus-
ing the racket! ”
  In fact, up the hall came the thud of the
guard’s foot, felt in the vibration of the
floor rather than heard. And to the horror
of Olivetta, John Hodge stepped squarely
out from behind the wall and into the view
of the approaching man!
288
•\RGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
 The latter halted.
 “ What in hell—” he gasped.
 “ Hello! Hello!” grumbled John Hodge
 in a roughened and deepened voice. “ You
 ain't asleep yet, eh?”
 “ Who is it?” said the other, approach-
 ing nearer in their direction. “ I dunno that
 I remember—”
 “ Tom sent me up to Jack’s room. You
 must of been asleep when I come by going
 up.”
 “ You lie! I ain't closed an eye. What
 you been doing?”
 The answer was only one of those inde-
 scribable intakes of breath when a man
 leaps into action. There was a startled snarl
 half formed from the throat of the guard,
and then a quick thud, as of a fist striking
home, followed by a jarring fall.
  Olivetta ran out into the hall. She saw
a form in the dim light prone on the floor.
John Hodge was already turning toward
her.
  “Now run for it!” he said eagerly.
“ Don't mind the noise now. We’ve got to
get out before he comes to, and that ’11 be
just a matter of seconds.”
  They turned side by side for the next
flight of stairs, but each halted and shrank
before beginning the descent, for a door
was suddenly cast open on the floor above,
and the voice of Jacqueline rang through
the house, sharp with fear and rage: “ He’s
loose—John Hodge—”

 THE I-told-you-so's have it. Food
for gossip! Why, they’ll have a
regular feast!” Phyllis soliloquized
bitterly as she packed her trunk, going
about it with an anxious-to-shake-the-dirt-
of-this-place-off-my-fee£ sort of air. Silk
stockings and silk “ other things ” were
piled in a rebellious heap.
  She heard Graham go into the hall and
take his hat off the rack; heard him walk
toward the bedroom and then abruptly turn
away. A moment later the outer door
slammed. He had left the house.
  “ Brute!” she muttered, flinging a bottle
of French toilet water viciously into her
gold-mounted, black morocco suit case.
  Just a year ago Phyllis, the spoiled,
motherless daughter of a millionaire, had
eloped with a man who had nothing to
offer her but love and prospects. She had
met John Graham while visiting a college
chum, and with both it had been a case
of love at first sight. Graham, who during
his thirty odd years had been a student
in the school of hard knocks, had suggest-
ed waiting until he was better established.

But she had declared that she would
“ adore housework,” and, being deeply in
love, he had closed his ears to prudence
and opened them wide to inclination.
  Experience proved her wrong. She did
not adore housework. Washing dishes and
cooking, even with the assistance of a by-
the-hour colored maid, was sadly different
from her romantic expectations. At first
the young wife was delighted with the nov-
elty of the four room bungalow, but re-
sponsibility was new and soon became irk-
some. Gradually she drifted back to her
old frivolous life, demanding luxuries quite
beyond the reach of the wife of John Gra-
ham. Her husband, who idolized her,
plunged harder than ever into his work,
trying to give Phyllis some of the things
which she was continually reminding him
she had always had.
  The climax had come that morning. Gra-
ham was making toast at the kitchen stove
when his wife appeared in the doorway,
looking like a fluffy chicken masking as a
bird of paradise with her disheveled yellow
hair and gorgeous, pastel-shaded negligee,
290
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY,
His surprise—as it was long before her cus-
tomary rising hour—had been largely mixed
with apprehension, which was well founded,
for she immediately plunged into the unset-
tled argument of the night before.
  “ Well, John, are you more sensible this
morning?” she demanded, perching herself
on the edge of one of the blue enameled
chairs, and rubbing her sleepy pansy eyes.
  “ If you mean have I changed my mind
—no, Phyllis.”
  “ How can you be so unkind?” pouting
down at her blue satin slippers. She looked
as strangely out of place in the miniature
kitchen as did the tall, dignified man in his
shirt sleeves bending over the coffee pot.
“ Taxi bills run up frightfully. Really, I
could almost own a car for what I spend
on them. I’m only asking for a little run-
about, although you know that at home—”
  “ But I explained all that last night,
Phyllis,” Graham broke in, the lines deep-
ening on his careworn face. “ It’s abso-
lutely out of the question. Until business
improves even the taxis will have to stop.”
  “ Oh, will they?” mockingly. “ What
do you expect me to do? Ride in street
cars? Well, I won’t. I’ll go back to fa-
ther first. You don’t love me, or you would
not make me a laughing stock for my
friends; and I w'as a fool to marry you—a
fool, a fool, a jool!” She had risen and was
brandishing her closed fists, spoiled child
fashion, the last “ fool ” being fairly
screamed at her husband, who had stopped
his preparations of a hurried breakfast.
  Although not the type of man one could
suitably call a worm, Graham certainly
did turn. If he could have explained the
serious problems facing him at the factory
—which he couldn’t, as Greek was more
intelligible to Phyllis than assets and lia-
bilities—his gentle tolerance might not have
deserted him; but the strain of many sleep-
less nights and harried days, together with
her incessant complaining, broke down the
wall of his patience.
  “ Stop it,” he commanded, although the
stern set of his lip was belied by the pain
in his gray eyes. “ I’ve tried to make you
understand, but either you can’t or won’t.
God knows I’m doing the best I can, but
instead of giving you more money I’ll have
to cut down expenses. If you think you’ll
be happier at your father’s, Phyllis, maybe
you’d better go back.”
  Phyllis stared at him in angry astonish-
ment. It was the first time he had not
petted and coaxed her out of her tantrums.
  “ I will go,” she cried, her blue eyes turn-
ing black with rage. “ You’re a beast,
John Graham, and a miser. And I’ll never
come back, never, never!”
  “ I won’t ask you to,” wearily, “ for I’m
afraid our marriage was a mistake.”
  “ Beast!” she cried again. And with her
silken robe flying, she flung herself into the
bedroom and locked the door. Then she
began packing.
II.
  That evening she walked in upon her
father, who, having promptly disowned her
upon her marriage, had not seen her for a
year. Mr. Smyth, who was a stock yards
magnate and looked it, puffed thoughtfully
at his Havana as she told her hysterical
story in the library. He seemed far from
displeased at the return of the prodigal
daughter.
  “ I’m not surprised,” he told her. “ I
didn’t think you’d go through with it. No,
don’t interrupt me, Phyllis. It’s my fault
as much as yours. A poor man’s wife must
be a good, honest piece of crockery, able
to stand hard bumps without breaking or
even nicking. I made a dainty Dresden
china doll out of you, and with my money
and your schooling I figured on getting
some blue blood into the family. I’ll let
you come back home on condition that your
separation from that man is permanent.
We’ll go down and see about the divorce
to-morrow.”
  “ To-morrow?” Phyllis choked down a
sob. “ There’s no hurry, is there, dad?”
  “ No-o-o, I suppose not,” with carefully
simulated indifference. “ Just go ahead
and enjoy yourself.”
  As Phyllis predicted, her return was a
feast for the gossips, and she sensed it in
spite of the acclaim with which she was
welcomed.
  Ray Kensington Alexer was among the
first to call, accompanied by his mother, a
stoutish, white haired lady who wore real

beads with an air. The Alexers had been
among the Pilgrim Fathers—so had the
Kensingtons. Mrs. Alexer found it rather
inconvenient, however, to keep up the fam-
ily splendor on the family income.
  While Ray and Phyllis exchanged merry
badinage, Mamma Alexer and Papa Smyth
exchanged significant glances.
  “ It’s simply great to see you, Phyl,”
drawled Ray. “ Your husband — didn’t
come, eh?”
  “ John? No,” with a vigorous shake of
her fluffy blond head; “ he’s too busy.
John’s a regular human adding machine.”
“ I’m doing some adding myself right
now,” Ray laughingly asserted, “ trying to
put two and two together. Freedom of an
old friend, you know.”
  “ I always thought two and two made
four,” Phyllis smiled impishly up at him
from the velvety depths of the tall, mahog-
any chair. After her jaunt into Poorman’s
Land she was pleasantly conscious of the
gorgeousness of the oriental rugs, the
creamy softness of the satin wall hang-
ings, and the luxury of the silently moving
footman serving tea in eggshell china cups.
Her companion, too—slim, distinguished
looking, faultlessly groomed, fitted into the
general luxuriousness. Ah, this was her
world, she thought contentedly!
  “ Two and two do make four,” agreed
Ray, “ but one and one— Now, in our
case,” leaning confidentially toward her, “ I
had expected—”
  “ Expectation never hurts. It’s realiza-
tion that’s tragic.”
  “ Right-o. But,” with an aggrieved air,
“ it was a scurvy trick you played on me.
Nobody would ever dream as you sit there
looking like a yellow angel—”
  “ Yellow! This dress is peach color.”
  “ Is it? Well, you certainly look lus-
cious in it, and if you don’t stop smiling at
me in that ‘ come hither ’ way—”
  “ Be careful, Ray,” demurely; “ don’t
forget that I’m a married woman.”
  “ Are you too much married to play
eighteen holes to-morrow?”
  “ Absolutely. Unless,” relenting, “ we
get up a foursome.”
  Which they did. This was the first of
many days spent at the country club, and
it was remarkable how quickly Phyllis
slipped back into her old niche of popular-
ity. Loaded down with gold from her fa-
ther’s coffers—which, like Hawthorne’s
“ miraculous pitcher,” were ahvays full and
running over—she indulged in unrestrained
shopping orgies, and plunged with feverish
gayety into a round of teas and dances and
dinners.
  At an exclusive affair one evening Mr.
Smyth—a fat, pudgy figure, in spite of his
gentlemanly attire—stood watching her
with exultant satisfaction. Her eyes spar-
kling like twin sapphires, her hair burnished
gold against the cobwebby midnight blue of
a gown upon which sparsely scattered iri-
descents glistened like drops of dew, she was
the center of an admiring group, the most
worshipful of whom was Ray.
  Smyth—who had been “ Smith ” before
the war had made him a multimillionaire—
was obsessed with one idea. Having no
pedigree of his own, he wanted to buy one.
And it was through his pretty daughter that
he had planned on getting it. To this end
he had had her carefully trained, hothouse
fashion, and her elopement had been a
bitter blow. He had shrewdly foreseen,
however, that if he disowned her—luxury
being woven into the very fiber of her being
—back she would come when the lash of
poverty scourged her flesh. He smiled com-
placently as he realized the correctness of
his prediction. True, she had thus far
evaded his suggestions as to a divorce, but
that would come. '
  He knew that John Graham was strug-
gling along on a shoestring. He knew also
that his largest debt was to the Shannon
Company, in which Smyth himself hap-
pened to be a director and a large stock-
holder. He had but to say the word—-
Unconsciously he closed his large, rather
puffy hand as though in the act of crushing
a small, helpless fly.
  Phyllis, passing him wTith Ray in her
wake, stopped at that moment.
  “ Ray is going to drive me home, dad,”
she said, turning her flushed, pretty face to
his. “ You don’t mind, do you?”
  “ Wouldn’t do me much good if I did,”
with pretended displeasure. “ You be care-
ful, you two, and don’t go over sixty miles
292
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
an hour. I don’t want to be getting you
out of jail at daybreak.”
  “ No danger, sir,” laughed Ray. “ I’m
more liable to make it a mile an hour.”
  In the machine, Phyllis, leaning back,
noticed how the white moonbeams gave a
spectral appearance to the shrubs and trees,
which waved their arms fantastically. Who
can control the mind in scenes like this?
Balmy, moonlight nights in the little road-
ster which John had afterward sold to make
a “ down payment ” on their bungalow—
nights when the swaying trees and whisper-
ing wind had played an exquisite symphony
to accompany the melody which love was
playing on their heartstrings! It was on
such nights that, against her will, John came
into her thoughts. Intuitively she knew that
her companion was feeling the intoxicating
influence of their surroundings now. As for
herself—
  “ Why the sigh?”
  “ I hardly know,” with a reckless sigh,
letting the hand he had taken remain in
his. “ Guess I hate to think of such a glo-
rious moonlight night ever coming to an
end.”
  Abruptly Ray stopped the car in the
leafy, whispering road. “ An echo of my
own thoughts,” he whispered. She felt his
hot breath on her cheek as he went on un-
steadily. “ Wonderful girl, have you any
idea how much I love you?”
  “ Do you—really?"
  “ You know I do. Why won’t you get
your divorce, Phyllis, and marry me?
Promise me now, to-night, that you will.”
She allowed herself to be swept into his
arms. She even let him kiss her, assuring
herself that she was supremely happy. Yet
she did not find the experience particularly
exhilarating.
  Pushing him away, she drew her ermine
■wrap about her. “ I suppose I should,”
she answered. “ And I will some time.”
With this Ray had to be contented. He
scowled at the wheel as they proceeded on
their way, his lips set to repress words
which would not have been at all in keeping
with the w'ondrous scene and his wondrous
companion.
  Phyllis thought the conversation over as
her maid helped her prepare for bed. Ray
was right. A divorce was the only thing.
She could not go back to that beggarly
existence. As for John—she never wanted
to see him again; and evidently he felt the
same way, she told herself bitterly, for she
had never had so much as a word from him
in all the months of their separation. Well,
he would hear from her soon, she deter-
mined, through an attorney.
  The very next morning she was spurred
on to act. It was her birthday, and her
father, on leaving the house, asked her to
go out with him to the drive. Under the
massive archway built on one side of the
gray stone mansion stood a long, tawny
roadster, luxuriously upholstered in choco-
late brown—a car so powerfully made and
yet so symmetrically beautiful that Phyllis
gave a gasp of delight.
  “ Is it for me?” she asked excitedly.
   “ Yes; a little birthday gift.”
  “ Why, dad, you dear! You're always
doing things for me.”
  “ Am I, kitten? Well, suppose you do
something for me to-day. We’ll christen
this car together, not with a bottle of cham-
pagne. but with a trip to Lloyd’s office.”
  “ Your attorney?”
  “ Yes. You’ve never heard from Gra-
ham, you’ve told me. And it seems to me
that your pride, if nothing else—”
  “ You’re right, dad. We’ll go to-day.”
  Smyth suppressed a triumphant smile.
  “ Sensible girl,” he commended.
  After the case was started Phyllis was
conscious of a feeling of expectancy. But
no word came from John, and his apparent
indifference enraged her. “ I hate him,”
she fumed inwardly. “ I only wish he’d
come to court so I could show him how-
little I care.’
  She expressed her desire to “ have it over
with,” to Ray, who frequently accompanied
her on long rides in the new roadster.
  “ I can hardly wait for the time when
I can claim you,” he told her ardently. He
did not tell her that her father’s millions
had something to do with his impatience,
nor that he considered it quite something
to give people of no lineage the exalted
name of Kensington-Alexer. He really felt
quite magnanimous about it.
   Still, she was a prize, family or no family,
A DAUGHTER OF MIDAS.

he admitted as he watched her run the car
with dexterous skill. Refusing to let any
one else have the wheel, she would throw
off her hat, and with hair flying and eyes
sparkling, would whizz down the long,
smooth roads looking like a picture of
poetry in motion.
  Twice she was arrested for speeding, and
twice she listened demurely to her father’s
warning reprimand as he paid her fines and
allowed her to drive him home at the rate of
ten miles an hour.
  “ That car’s put the devil into you,” he
grumbled.
  She laughed. “ Every time I get my foot
on the accelerator and my hand on the
wheel, it seems to dare me.”
  “ Can’t understand it. You used to be
such a sane driver.”
  Phyllis herself could not understand it.
She seemed to be trying to run away from
her own thoughts—from fits of restlessness.
She did not attempt to analyze these moods
—she simply tried to escape from them.
  In spite of the lawyer’s precautions, the
paper printed a sensational story of the im-
pending divorce under the blazing caption,
SOCIETY BELLE WHO ELOPED SEEKS
DIVORCE
Phyllis hoped John would see the account.
The charges of “ cruelty and neglect ” stood
out like a close-up on a movie screen. He
couldn’t deny them. Didn’t he spend most
of his time at his old factory, and didn’t he
cruelly deny her the decencies of life?
  “ I don’t see how it got into the papers,”
she remarked to Ray.
  “ Neither do I. I’m not sorry, though.
It kind of casts the die and brings you that
much nearer to me.”
  “ Does it?”
  “ Doesn’t it? Look out, Phyl!” as she
turned a curve with dangerous abruptness.
  She was in one of her reckless moods.
Ray vowed that after she was married to
him this foolish speeding would stop. He’d
see to that. At present—
  “ I can’t understand, though, why he
never made an effort to see you.”
  “ He realized it would be useless. Heav-
ens—he doesn’t know what real living
means! A little two by four house on Main
Street, a garden, some chickens, a kitchen
cabinet type of wife in a kitchen cabinet
type of housedress—those things are reali-
ties to him.”
  “ And there’s always the possibility,”
suggested Ray slyly, “ of his having met
some one who entertains the same foolish
notions.”
  Phyllis started and gave him a strange
look.
  “ Why—why—yes, of course.” But it
was a thought which had never occurred to
her. John, alone and punished, was like a
sop to her vanity. But John—and another
woman!
  After letting Ray out at his club, she
drove like mad. The idea of John and an-
other woman, which Ray had hoped would
set her more firmly against her husband,
stung her like a mental wasp. Soon she
was speeding through the poverty section of
the big city. Pushcarts lined the curbs;
men, women, children and dogs in varying
stages of unwashed squalor, cluttered up
the streets. It was a section where care-
ful driving was requisite, and it always
acted as a brake on Phyllis. But to-day she
was scarcely aware of her locality. The
idea of John kissing another woman, loving
another woman, getting sympathy from an-
other woman as she was getting it from
Ray, possessed her. Why, it was unthink-
able!
  There was a cry echoed by many voices
in the narrow street; a grinding of wheels
as she hastily applied the brake; and in a
moment an excited mob was crowding
around the car, shouting in many languages
and gesticulating angrily. Phyllis, white as
the imported frock she wore, got out as a
policeman pushed back the crowd. She
stared at the small, unconscious figure that
had been ground beneath the wheels; at the
frantic mother moaning in an unintelligible
language as she clasped the child to her
bosom.
  But for the policeman, things would have
gone hard with Phyllis. Like one in a
dream, she found herself starting the car
with mechanical precision and taking the
officer and the wailing mother with her
burden to the hospital, after first aid had
been administered in the corner drug store.
294
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
She was calm, but her hand on the wheel
was like ice. The druggist’s face, the look
in his eyes, haunted her. If the child should
die she, Phyllis Graham, would be— She
dared not finish the thought, but her teeth
cut deeply into her lower lip as she smoth-
ered a scream.
  In the hospital the little inert form was
carried down the hall, and Phyllis was left
in the waiting room with the policeman,
who sat at a respectful distance—but who
still sat.
  Presently a tall, gaunt nurse came in.
Her unfriendly eyes, like the druggist’s,
spelled disaster. Phyllis understood that
she was being permitted to leave—with the
policeman.
  Her lips formed an almost inaudible ques-
tion.
  “ We don’t know yet,” replied the nurse.
Her cold, businesslike manner was madden-
ing.
  “ Spare no expense. I will pay,” faltered
Phyllis.
  l' We shall do all we can, of course; but
money is sometimes quite powerless.” The
woman’s voice was contemptuous.
  Unlike the usual dynamic Phyllis was the
white faced girl who told her story in a
sort of numbly horrified way to Ray and
her father in the latter’s study. Mr. Smyth,
being a man of quick action, left at once
to set the powerful wheels of his influence
in motion. The girl, staring off into space
with a vacant horror in her eyes, seemed
scarcely aware of Ray’s presence.
  “ Don’t be afraid, dear,” he said cheer-
fully. “ Your father is a very influential
man. He can fix anything. Even if the
child should die—”
  “ Die,” she muttered. It was the word
which during those long, terrible hours she
had kept warding off—pushing out of her
mind. Slowly she fixed her gaze on him.
Evidently he thought she was afraid for
herself. Her eyes filled, but she said noth-
ing.
  How could she blame him? Would she
not have felt the same but for the soft body
which had scrunched beneath the wheels a
few hours ago? Was it a few hours or was
it a year?
  The words of the nurse came back to her.
“ Sometimes money is quite powerless.” All
the money in the world could not efface
the memory of that afternoon’s experience.
  Ray rambled on as if the affair were a
mere incident—rather unpleasant, of course,
but then—a Ghetto child. Too many of
them anyway. But although she tried to
smile at his effort to cheer her, she was in-
wardly conscious of a growing horror as she
realized that his reasoning would have been
her reasoning had the experience not been
a personal one.
III.
  In the days that followed Smyth succeed-
ed in obtaining his daughter’s discharge on
the ground that her negligence was not the
proximate cause of the accident. Phyllis
asked no questions; showed no interest in
the proceedings. Daily she visited the hos-
pital and daily was met by the brusque
nurse, who did not soften her concise bulle-
tins. The child was near death. Phyllis
always left with the vision of the curling lip
and condemnatory eye of the nurse searing
into her soul. Formerly a complacent ad-
mirer of herself, she shrank from the intro-
spective thoughts which were continually
crowding in upon her.
   The child fighting for life in the hospital,
the divorce case looming up before her,
obtruded themselves into every act of her
daily life. She wondered dully how other
people could go on thinking the same
thoughts and doing the same things when
such a drastic change had taken place in
her own existence.
  At a dinner given one evening in their
magnificent dining room, Phyllis looked cu-
riously down the long, dazzling, overloaded
table with its mammoth centerpiece of rare
flowers; its sleek, well-fed occupants fairly
glittering with prosperity and twittering
with small talk. Involuntarily her mind
flittered back to a small living room. She
saw its modest talking machine, its cushion
filled divan, its simple bookcase of much
bethumbed, well chosen books—for John’s
literary taste was of the best—and as she
listened to the frothy conversation buzzing
around her she experienced a sensation
somewhat like a small boy who has eaten
too much pie.
A DAUGHTER OF MIDAS.
295
  After the guests had gone, Smyth went
into the library to glance over the evening
paper, whither Phyllis soon followed. She
dreaded to go to her room—to be alone
with her thoughts.
  At last her father looked up from his
paper. “ For Heaven’s sake, sit down,
Phyllis,” he growled. “ What’s the matter
with you?”
  “ Nothing.”
  “ H-m! Probably some gewgaw you saw
to-day.” And, opening a drawer in the pol-
ished mahogany table, he drew out a check
book.
  But Phyllis, springing forward, pushed it
from him. “ Don’t, dad. I can’t stand the
sight of money to-night—-not even a check.”
Her nervous little laugh caused Mr. Smyth
to shoot a glance at her from his steely
blue eyes. “ I’m tired, I guess. Good
night.” And she abruptly left him.
  Looking after her frowningly, he shook
his head. If that confounded divorce case
were only over! He’d make sure the next
day that the girl should not change her
mind.
  Troubles, like twins, seem to come in
pairs. It was the day before the divorce
hearing that the physician, more communi-
cative than the dour faced nurse, informed
Phyllis that the night would bring a crisis—
the child would either pass out or turn life-
ward in the scale.
  In a voice she could hardly control, Phyl-
lis repeated the doctor’s words to Ray,
who was waiting for her in the car, and add-
ed that she would return after dinner.
  “ But, Phil, you can’t come back,” Ray
reminded her. “ Don’t you know that this
is the opening night of the opera, and that
you and your father are going in our
party?”
  “ I can’t go.”
  “ You don’t mean that you’re going to
miss the first night of the opera?”
  “ Opera!” she jerked out. “God!” The
words came from between her set teeth of its
own volition.
  And in spite of the combined persuasion
of Ray and her father, she did not go to the
opera. That night, a tense, solitary figure
she sat huddled up just outside the room
where the child lay—waiting, waiting. The
eyes which had always overflowed at the
slightest provocation were now dry and
burning. They were viewing mental pic-
tures. She saw the little girl’s Russian
father, a tailor in one of the down town
sweat shops; the thin, overworked mother;
and the other four, poorly clad children, who
occasionally accompanied their parents.
She had made overtures at first, but the
family had one and all scorned them. In
their evident opinion she saw her reflection.
It was not a pretty reflection.
  A smothered sob escaped her. No won-
der John had not stooped to bring her back.
Scene after scene of her married life un-
rolled before her. Her unreasonable de-
mands; John’s endless patience; his efforts
to make up for the luxuries which he could
not supply. At that moment she fairly
ached for the comforting pressure of his em-
brace; for his quiet dependability.
  Ray at the opera ranged himself beside
John in her thoughts; Ray, in full evening
regalia. It struck her suddenly that wearing
the right clothes in the right manner seemed
to be his main object in life. Again a sob
escaped her and the words: “ What a
contrast! ”
  She was aroused by the opening of a
door. In an agony of terror she raised be-
seeching eyes to the unfriendly face of the
tired nurse, who said curtly: “ It’s all right.
The little girl will get well.”
  “ Thank—thank you,” stammered Phyl-
lish. And then she did something old-fash-
ioned. She fainted.
  She had to be helped into a taxi half an
hour later, but by the time she reached
home her natural resiliency and the knowl-
edge of the child’s certain recovery had
brought the color back to her face; the
strength to her body.
  Approaching her father’s study, she heard
voices. Evidently Ray had returned with
him. She would go in and tell them the
good news. She stopped short, however,
as the name Graham came from her father’s
lips.
  “ You see, my boy, Graham’s failure is
really due to an action taken by me,” he
was saying. “ The Shannon Company was
his biggest creditor. I’m an important
stockholder besides being a director. At
296
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
my request they close in on him, refuse him
any more time. The other creditors fall
into line. Get it?”
  “ I suppose it was the only way,” ap-
proved Ray.
  Phyllis, closing her eyes, leaned against
the Avail outside the door. What was this
new calamity? What was it they were plot-
ting against John?
   Her father’s voice came to her, harsh, de-
cisive. “ It was,” he snapped. “ Don’t
know what’s got into Phyllis lately, but one
thing’s sure. When she sees this newspaper,
she’ll realize that the divorce is the only
way out.”
  Pulling herself together with an effort,
Phyllis walked into the room, and noted
that her unexpected appearance disconcert-
ed both men.
  “ I thought you were in bed hours ago,”
mumbled Smyth.
  “ No, I just came from the hospital.
What paper are you talking about and why
should I see it?”
  She picked up the evening paper and
found a small item marked with blue pencil,
but outside of John Graham's name it con-
veyed little to her.
  “ What does it mean?” she asked.
  “ It means,” answered her father, chew-
ing at the inevitable cigar, “ that he’s bank-
rupt—broke—bills and no money to pay.
Although he says he’ll make good every
dollar.”
  “ Of course,” Phyllis mechanically
averred, “ John would do that.”
  She sat down quietly at the foot of the
long table, facing the two men on either
side of it.
  “ It’s all my fault,” she stated simply,
“ I kept nagging him for money, and be-
cause he couldn’t give it to me I reviled
him. And now, in some way, you’ve tried
to finish what I started. But you can’t.”
She raised her head proudly and looked
straight at her father. “ John will keep on
fighting. He’ll rise above it all. That’s
the kind of a man he is!”
  Then her calmness deserted her. Her
breast heaved convulsively, her breath com-
ing sharply from between her quivering lips.
“ Why, when I think of the way I treated
him I could die of shame!” she moaned.
  “ Here, here,” railed her father impa-
tiently, “ this can’t affect you. To-morrow
you’ll be a free woman.”
  “ Free! What does that mean? I’m be-
ginning to think it means a clear con-
science.”
  Without waiting for a reply she fled up
to her room and threw herself, face down-
ward, on the bed. Conflicting emotions
caused her slender body to shake with sobs,
but when the gale had subsided one thought
was dominant in her mind—she must see
John, and at once.
  On consulting her time-table she found
that she had just an hour to catch the train
and as she hastily packed her suit case
smiles and tears chased each other across
her face. At the landing she was con-
fronted by her father, furiously chewing at
his cigar.
  “ Are you crazy?” he demanded.
“ You’ve got to be here to-morrow to ap-
pear in court.”
  “ I’m afraid the court will have to get
along without me,” with a tremulous smile.
  “If you couldn’t stand it before, how
are you going to now?” He glared at her
angrily. “ Why, he hasn’t a dollar to his
name! ”
  “ I’m going to help him.”
  “ You—help him!”
  Her father’s derisive laugh stung her to
the quick. “ Help him; he’s down as far
as he can get—you’re going to help him stay
down, I suppose.”
  “ No, I’m going to be a wife this time—
not a parasite. I’ve been running around
with an apparently solid gold brain, but I’m
cured, I think. And I’m going back to
my husband. That is,” humbly, “ if he’ll
have me. I must hurry or I’ll miss that
train. I wish you’d say good-by to me,
dad.”
  But he turned from her without another
word.
IV.
  The sky was painted with the salmons
and grays of dawn as she alighted from the
train. The first thing she did was not to take
a taxi.
  Going around the back of the house, she
let herself in quietly through the kitchen,

297
tiptoeing on through the dining room.
Dreary, desolateness and deplorable neglect
pervaded the atmosphere, and, as she
paused on the threshold of the living room,
a little gasp escaped her.
  Graham, his back toward her, was poring
over a litter of papers on the library table,
and the unutterable weariness in the bent
head would have melted a heart of stone.
There was a chill dampness in the air, and
ashes were strewn about the dead hearth—
ashes which spoke of many cigars smoked
and an all night session. As the sense of
another presence caused him to turn, Phil-
lis was shocked at the extreme pallor of his
face, its emaciation bringing his cheek
bones into startling prominence.
  “ Hello, Phyllis.” He evinced no sur-
prise; but he sat up very straight and his
hand closed spasmodically over the pencil
he was holding. Then, with a smile so ob-
viously forced that it brought tears to her
eyes, he continued: “ Rather an early call
you’re paying me. You’ve heard, and, of
course, you’ve come for the rest of your
things.”
  The simple statement brought a hot flush
of shame to her cheeks. “ Oh, no, John,”
she protested, “ I—”
  “ Don’t bother explaining. I got that
divorce notice and knowing you wished to
be free I didn’t file an answer, so there
won’t be any obstacles in your way. You
see how lucky you are to get rid of me,”
with forced lightness; “ this cottage must
                                XJ
  go, and even the despised street cars may
  become a luxury.”
     He did not look at her, but kept his eyes
  glued to a brass bulldog ferociously hold-
  ing down some of the papers on the littered
  table. “ But to-day at least I can still offer
  you some breakfast. I’ll wash up a little
  and make some coffee.”
    But Phyllis sprang forward, blocking his
  way into the dining room. “ No, you
  won’t,” she said with tremulous emphasis;
  “ that’s my job and after this I'm going to
  get the breakfasts.”
    What Graham read in her eyes changed
  his bewildered look to one of radiant hap-
  piness. But even while he strained her to
  him, he murmured over and over: “ I
  shouldn’t let you do it.”
    “ Stop me if you can,” she challenged,
  with something of her spoiled child manner.
  Then, after a moment:
    “ And you’re not sorry I came back?”
    “ Sorry! If you knew how I’ve hungered
  for a sight of you!”
    “ And you don’t think our marriage a
  mistake?”
    “ No, no! But I have so little to offer
  you now, dearest.”
    “ You have everything that counts; and
  I’m going to try giving as well as taking.”
  Then, after a blissfully silent moment:
     “ But there’s one thing I won’t do, John,”
  she whispered from the shelter of his close
  embrace, “ I won’t ride in street cars—I’m
  going to walk.”

CHAPTER X.
THE THREE CHUMS.
MORGAN stooped to go through the
low door. He found himself in a
small' sitting room, bedroom, and
kitchen, from which the soldier, Vine, could
tend his shop af^lmost any hour of the day
or night by wheeling himself through the
door and out into his store. A low fire
burned in a stove, and the teakettle
hummed.
  Two windows looked out upon a green
little yard with rosebushes in bloom, along
a graveled path scarcely a foot in width,
which led to a gate in the garden wall.
This in turn gave upon an alleyway along
which Morgan could see the torsos of people
passing. The gate cut off any view of their
lower limbs, and the softness of the soil
upon which they walked drowned their foot-
steps, so that they seemed like figures float-
ing across a dark screen.
  The white curtains at the windows, the
green window boxes, the high polish of the
stove, and the sailorlike cleanness of every-
thing warmed Morgan’s heart. It was a
comfortable bunk, just the place for an old
soldier to stow himself and, even though
crippled, spend the rest of his life in a
mellow quiet.
  The tobacconist himself was by the stove,
washing his dishes. They were a cheery
white and blue, and he placed them in a
rack as he drew them out of the steaming
water. He sat in a wheel chair; a rug,
thrown across his lap, reached to the floor
and concealed his lower limbs.
  As he looked up Morgan felt a shock. He
was chalk faced, small eyed, and his move-

THE FOURTH CHUM.

merits were furtive and jerky. He dropped
a cup, and both he and Morgan stooped to
pick it up.
  Their shoulders touched, and in the mo-
ment that they looked into each other’s
eyes Morgan saw cunning, fright and a
curious lust in them. He stood up and
stepped back a pace. Those eyes were as
much out of place in this pleasant, cozy
room as a tropical spider would have been.
The man in the chair began to speak.
  “ Wot cheer, mate? Bli’me if it ain’t a
gunner from the ’Oss! That’s my old regi-
ment. Many’s the time I’ve polished that
round button and fought with a field ar-
tilleryman over it. They’re ’ot because they
wear the flat ones, and we’re ’ot because
they ’ave the grenade and we ’aven’t. Wot
can I do for you?”
  “ I came down from Woolwich,” said
Morgan slowly, “ to see you?”
  “ To see me!” said the cripple, wheeling
himself about in his chair. “ Tyke a chair,
and we’ll ’ave a chat about the old times.
Wot battery are you from?”
  “ P Battery.”
  “ I was in P once, but I’ve been a sig-
naler so long I feel like I belonged to all
the batteries. First, you’re working with
one and then another, when you’re a sig-
naler. The bloody times I’ve spread wire
over that practice ground in Woolwich!
They told me once to cover a gyte with
wire, and I covered it. That was my first
time in the field problem test, and I made
a bloomin’ ’ash of it. The book said to
cover every gyte with wire, meaning to run
a little along the top and leave a little more
for slack, but I’m damned if I didn’t run
wire up and down it from top to bottom
and crossways until you couldn’t see a bit of
timber. Ha, ha!”
  All this tumbled out in a rushed mechan-
ical sort of recital, punctuated with bursts
of nervous laughter. The stuff was good and
true, and in it Morgan recognized the tone
of the signal school where Pearsley had
spent much of his time. But Pearsley, what-
ever his morals might have been in regard
to lost and found property, was a big, stur-
dy English Tommy of Victorian mold, and
from what little he had heard of him Crill
must have been somewhat the same sort.
  In his mind Morgan had built up a pic-
ture of three men, all of this kind, and
somehow ennobled by their love for one
another. The man before him was of
another sort, but after the first shock had
abated Morgan remembered that Vine had
been terribly wounded and that he had
spent years in hospitals, most of which must
have been in pain. That would alter any
man, although he told himself in the next
moment that he had seen ex-soldiers going
about London as badly crippled as this man,
but still cheery, healthy, and honest in
look.
  “ Sit down, will yer?” said the cripple,
and pointed to a chair. “ Just knock all
that stuff off on the floor. I ain’t ’ad time
to clean up proper. It’s a cozy little bunk
when it is done up—it always makes me
think of Sergeant Russell’s at the signal
school. ’E was a terror, and no mistake.”
  The voice trailed off, for in clearing the
chair Morgan had come upon a small,
modish black hat. He picked it up, and
his heart leaped, for there was something
about it that reminded him irresistibly of
Virginie Eloise St. Alary. It was just the
sort of smart, expensive looking little tur-
ban she would wear. He looked at the
cripple and saw that his face was set in a
leer.
  “ That belongs to my ’ousekeeper’s
daughter. She’s a smart little thing, and she
’as her eye on being a movie actress. That
’at ought to get ’er a job—she looks as
fetching in it as any filly I ever saw. Wot ’11
you ’ave to drink? I can give yer whisky or
tea, but not much else.”
  “ Nothing, thanks,” said Morgan, and
for the sake of the memory laid the hat
carefully on a painted wooden chest. “ I
have had lunch,” he added, and sat down
in the chair.
  “ It’s a blawsted good job you ’ave.
When a chap keeps bachelor ’all the way I
do, ’e don’t live very ’igh. I don’t see a
femyle fyce or ’ear a femyle voice from
one year’s end to the other. If it’s all the
syme to you, I’ll ’ave a spot of whisky.
What cheer?”
  He brought a bottle up from beside his
chair and poured himself a stiff drink and
downed it. When that was done he seemed
300

to relax—he settled himself back in his
chair, and the smile on his face became
warmer and more human.
  Morgan sat pondering the strangeness of
the man, and the inconsistency of him; for
in one breath he spoke of his housekeeper’s
daughter, and in the second of not seeing a
female face from one year’s end to the other.
Still, a man caught in an amour would be
more or less bound to make some sort of
excuse.
  It was a disappointment not to find Vine
of the same mold as Pearsley and Crill. He
cast about in his mind for some proper
means of approaching his mission, but the
man in the wheel chair seemed to be crazy
to talk, and he went on in his high voice.
  “ Is Todd still at Woolwich?”
  “ Yes.”
  “ 'E will be until the last trump is
sounded. ’E’ll be there to devil the last
recruit that joins up. Many’s the time I’ve
seen ’im pull a driver off ’is 'orse in the
square and bring ’im flat on the ground,
field kit and all. ’E don’t coddle ’em
none.”
  Morgan nodded and smiled. He had seen
Todd in action, and the words fitted the
brigade sergeant-major’s methods. There
was a step in the outer shop, and the faint
click of a latch. The man in the chair
stiffened, and the face became a shade
whiter.
  Morgan made as if to rise, but the man
shot out a hand and pushed him down into
his chair.
  “It’s a customer, I think,” said Mor-
gan. “ I heard a step and the latch of
the door. I’ll go out and see what the man
wants.”
  “ No. Sit where you are. I’ve shut shop
for to-day, and it’s going to stay shut!”
the man answered in a fierce whisper. His
hand clutched the tall soldier’s forearm, and
both sat in a silence which bad become
suddenly tense. There was no repetition of
the footstep, however, and after a time the
cripple relaxed and fell back into his chair.
  “ I was blown ’igh as ’eaven,” he said,
wiping his face with a shaking hand. “ A
shell blew me thirty feet in the air, and
I’ve never been the syme—inside or out.
I ’ave to ’ave plenty rest, even ’ere, and I
shut up at noon and don’t open till four.
It’s the only way I can keep from going
barmy. There ain’t any proper lock on the
door, and sometimes people will get in, but
I sit ’ere and let ’em stand until they get
weary. They can clean out the plyce, for
all of me; I won’t move to wait on ’em.”
  A twitching movement made the rug
sway that covered his lap, and Morgan saw
that from the knees down the man was
legless. His history was clear, and with it
the little, creeping doubt in Morgan’s mind
vanished.
  Vine had been so terribly injured and
shell shocked that it was a wonder he was
alive at all; he was but a shell of his former
self, and even the impression he gave of
cunning must be excused on the ground of
his terrible injuries. The man seemed to
divine his thoughts, and began to speak of
his hurts, of the many months he had spent
in this hospital, and the years in that.
When he had finished Morgan said: “ You
heard about Pearsley, of course.”
  “ Aye, that I did,” answered the cripple
and dropped his forehead on his hand.
“ Poor old Dick! ’E was always planning
that ’e would pass his last days with Crill
and me—the three of us in some little shop
like this. Wouldn’t this ’ave been the
proper place for three old sods like us?
Not ’alf.
  “ With Pearsley and Crill to run the shop
and me to keep the ’ouse, we’d ’ave been
as ’appy as clams. I was always the ’and
for cookin’. When we was on maneuvers
in India they would get the goat or the
jungle cock or whatever else was ’andy, and
I would do the cookin’. Both of ’em was
good ’ands at foraging. I tell you, mate, we
’ad a system.
  “ And they always thought I’d be the
first to go west, but I didn’t. I was unlucky
like, and it seemed as if when we went out
to France I’d be the first to get it. I was,
but wot’s left of me is alive, and both of
them are underground. It’s a bloomin’
queer gyme.”
  “ You must have been great chums.”
  “ We was. Ever since we was kids to-
gether in the Home for Soldiers’ Orphans.
Then we was trumpeters together, and arter
that gunners. And we fought for each other
THE FOURTH CHUM.
301
from the time we first began smuggling fags
into our rooms at the ’ome and blowing the
smoke out of the window arter lights was
out.
  “ We ruled the trumpeters, too—the
three of us against any other three, or the
’ole lot. It didn’t myke any difference—
they couldn’t bust us up. It’s a wonder wot
three kids can cook up and make stick.
And if one was punished, the other two
would get into some blawsted ’ole and tyke
the confinement or the stopped pay along
with ’im. Dick was always in trouble with
the schoolmaster. You mind the school
over by the magazines?”
  “ Yes.”
  “ We went there three days a week for
God knows ’ow many years. Crill was al-
ways a lad for ’is book, and I was quick
enough at catching onto the pot ’ooks, but
Dick could never tell one letter from an-
other. And the sergeant-major that was
schoolteacher was always whaling poor
Dick for his dumbness, but he never whaled
’im that ’e didn’t whale us for sticking pins
into the other lads.
  “ Arter we’d been gunners for a time,
the major told us we could go to signal
school if we could pawss the tests. You
’ad to figure a bit, and write somethink
that the corporal read to you out of a book,
and explain somethink in writing—’ow to
get to Beresford Square it was the time we
three took it.
  “ We all three wanted to get into the
school for the reason that the life was
cushy—no guards, no stables, and two ’alf
’olidays a week. Everybody wanted to get
into the flags.
  “ But Dick couldn’t tell ’ow to get to
Beresford Square. ’E’d been there three
times a week say for ten years, and ’e could
tell a bloke ’ow to do it, or ’e could draw a
picture, but to put it in words was more
than ’e could get around. Bli’me! ’E ate
up ’is pencil trying to think, but he couldn’t
do it. The figures didn’t bother ’im so
much.
  “ Arter the test was over the sergeant
told Crill and me that we was all O. K.,
but Dick was to go back to the battery.
So we told ’im it was all three or none, and
since we was three likely looking soldiers ’e
let Dick tell ’im ’ow to get to Beresford
Square. ’Struth! I laughed until I was
near crying.”
  There were tears in the man’s eyes when
he finished. He dropped his forehead on
his hand and sat still again for a time.
  “ The things us three bloomin’ Tommies
went through!” he said. “I mind the
time we first went out to India. When we
got aboard we ’ad to go up a gangplank
that was ’igh and thin and rickety, and it
broke with the three of us on it. Crill ’ad
’is leg broken and I ’ad my ankle twisted,
but Dick wasn’t ’urt. They put us to bed
in our proper bunks because the hospital
was full of worse ’urt than us. I mind the
time when Dick came in to open the venti-
lator. ’E ’ad to stand on a little ladder
not two foot off the floor, but Crill and I
laid there and sweated blood for fear ’e
would fall.”
  These scenes moved Morgan deeply, for
they had a significance in his own life. He
forgot the chalky faced, ferret eyed man
opposite him, and saw only the three young
soldiers, chums from babyhood almost.
Together they had gone through the home,
through the rigors of the trumpeter's life,
through the molding, and chipping, and
fining that had made the old time British
soldier.
  There was no more sacred relation in life
than that of chum to chum, and there was
no side of life in which the relation
flourished as it did in the old time British
army. This much he knew from observa-
tion and experience. Low pay and harsh
treatment threw men on each other, and all
the pleasure of the old Tommy’s life must
come from the courtesy, wit and generosity
of his pal.
  The tall young soldier seemed to shrink
and sag as though he had taken on fifty
years. His face was white and drawn as he
looked out of the window into the quiet
garden plot, and beads of sweat stood out
on his face. He wiped them away.
  “ You three had better luck than I did,”
he said in a voice which became loud and
harsh as he tried to control it. “ I had a
chum who was as much to me as you and
Crill and Pearsley were to each other. /
killed my pal—boxing!”
302
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  “ Garn! ” said the man in the chair, star-
tled.
  “ Yes. That is why I’ve taken so much
interest in you and Pearsley. Pearsley died
in my arms, and his last thought was of
you. He asked me to bring six diamonds
to you. I’d have gone through hell to put
them in your hands!”
  “ No,” said a low, clear voice.
  Morgan’s heart leaped, then seemed to
pause in his breast, and wait for a second
word. He knew’ that low voice, with the
thrushlike break in it. A slow tremor w'ent
over him, and his big hands closed convul-
sively.
  “ Wot’s the trouble, mate?” said the man
in the chair in a ghastly attempt at gayety.
  You look like you’d seen a ghost.”
  Morgan stared into the cunning, wolfish
face. It was paper white, with dirty
shadings about the eyes and the mouth.
  The tall soldier arose, and, tiptoeing to
the shop door, threw it open. There was
no one there, and he went next to the gar-
den door and threw that open; but the little
plot was empty, and for the time there was
no one passing beyond the gate. He turned
back toward the cripple, who was gripping
his chair and raising himself on rigid arms.
  “ Sit down, chum,” he said hoarsely.
“ Sit down. There’s nobody ’ere but you
and me.”
  In answer the voice began to sing.
          "Petit mouton, ou vas-tu?
          Je vais—”
  The voice stopped suddenly; and Mor-
gan heard a quick step over his head. Then
it began again, with a note of terror in it.
     “ Petit mouton, quandre viendras-lu?
    Jamais! Jamais! Jamais!”
  “Good Lord!” said Morgan. “You’re
not Vine!”
  For answer the cripple’s arm shot out and
seized a caseknife from the table. He
raised himself by his arms, and as the rug
fell away Morgan saw that his legs were
doubled up under him.
  The man put one foot to the floor, then
the other, and crouched.
  “ ’And ’em over!” he said in a fierce
whisper. “ ’And ’em over!”
  Morgan fell back and put up his hands.
The blood was boiling in his breast and his
great muscles twitched, but the dread of a
fight was like a lead weight on his spirit.
  “ No!” he said. “ No! Don’t make me
strike you! ”
  “ ’And ’em over!”
  From above came the clear voice, say-
ing, “No!” again. It ended in a soft,
choked scream. The ceiling creaked under
the weight of a falling body, and at the
sound he straightened. His big hands went
out, and he took a long step toward the
cripple.
  “ Where is she?” he demanded. “ Tell
me, or I’ll break every bone in you!”
  One hand fell in a long sweep and caught
the wrist of the knife hand. The bones
cracked, and the man’s lips curled in ag-
ony, but he made no sound.
  “ Tell me!” The man went to his knees,
biting and scratching at the inexorable grip.
Then he fell to the floor; he had fainted
from the agony of the crushed bones.
  Morgan left him and, whirling, ran into
the garden. It had appeared to him that
the voice had come from above, but there
was no door in the room except the one
which led into the shop and the one which
opened on the garden.
  He looked up at the narrow' back of the
house, and saw a woman’s handkerchief
fluttering at the sill of a partly opened
window.
  He could hear the movement of a body
there, and a savage, doglike whimper. By
standing on a bench he got his finger tips
on the window sill, and by setting his foot
on the frame of the garden door he w'as able
to swing himself up and look in.
  She lay near the window, face down, and
the hair, instead of being gray, was black;
but he knew her for the woman of Black-
heath. Beside her knelt the batman. Her
warning song had roused the lust in him,
as had the opposition of the old soldier of
the coal yard, and his answer was the same.
So intense was his fury that the smashing
of the window frame did not pierce the
crimson fog that clouded his senses.
  Morgan knew him, and as he raised his
malletlike fist there was no pity, none of
the leaden apprehension of hurting a man,
THE FOURTH CHUM.
303
in him. The cheek bone cracked as the
fist fell, and the batman shot through a
half arc, only to meet the other descending
fist. He put up his hands uncertainly to
ward off the thunderous blows. The soldier
hauled him to his feet and let him stand
for a moment while he gathered his
strength.
  Under the impact of the blow that struck
against his dark, suffused face, the batman
rose and sailed like a heavy bird through
the air until he struck the wall. There
he fell, but Morgan would not let him rest.
Once, twice he hauled him to his feet, and
struck again, then raised him bodily above
his head and hurled him against the wall.
The man fell in a confused, broken mass.
  Morgan bent over him, fighting for the
control of his runaway muscles. They were
crying out to break the batman as a man
is broken on the rack. Slowly the fever in
him abated, and as he saw the curiously
malformed face, and the pinpoints of blood
standing out on great patches of bruised
flesh, he was suddenly wreak. He stood up
blindly, then, making his way toward the
girl, swept her up in his arms and held her
close.
  A clock struck a quarter and then the
hour. The wild beating of his own heart
had abated, and he felt cold and tired, but
she still fought her terror. Tremor after
tremor swept the slim body, and the arm
that encircled his neck clung desperately.
Her other hand was at her bruised throat.
The clock struck again and again before
she was calm. She slipped out of his arms
to the floor and looked up at him with a
wavering smile.
  “ Ah!” she said in a broken whisper, lay-
ing one of her hands on his. “ I have known
that big han’ would be of service to me.”
  Morgan got stiffly to his feet and stamped
to set the blood flowing again in his knees.
The truth dawned on him that it was all a
plant, and that she had been the brains of
it, and as a corrollary to all this came the
certainty that she was a soldier of fortune;
woman of charm though she might be, she
was a criminal. But she had warned him.
  She seemed to read his frowning scrutiny
and spread out her hands. A slow flush
crept into her cheek and her eves left his.
  “ It has been very badly manage’,’’ she
said in a stronger voice. “ When he drop’
the cup I know it cannot go. Sir, you will
have no respec’ for me. You will laugh at
me as long as you live.”
   He shook his head.
   “ No, mademoiselle, I can never laugh at
you.”
   “ And my hat,” she said ruefully, “ which
you foun’ on the chair. Never before have
I made such a blunder. I have call’ myself
many hard names as I sit here and listen
to you talking below. Such a willing sheep,
and such a clumsy shearer! It is a sad
waste.”
  “ But you warned me,” said Morgan.
“ Why?”
  “ How do I know-? Perhaps I have los’
my nerve; perhaps I do not like it because
it is so easy. An actor, sir, does not value
an audience that is too easily move’. And
perhaps you have so touch’ me with your
story that I cannot bear to see you hood-
wink’. Perhaps! But no! It is leaving
the hat on the chair that has disgus’ me
with it all. Things so badly begun cannot
turn out well. Sooner or later I should have
trouble—”
  A stertorous breath from the batman cut
her short. Her eyes closed and her hands
flew to her throat. Morgan stooped and
touched her; after a moment she opened
her eyes and looked up at him with the
wavering smile.
   “ You will forgive me,” she said. “ It is
not customary that people try to—kill me.
Ah, such a bad dream!”
  Morgan went to the batman. He was
breathing thickly through puffed lips.
  Morgan straightened him out, suddenly
happy that the man was not dead, and, in
looking about for something with which
to bind him, got his first glimpse of the
room. It was a small, dowdy chamber, with
bed, dresser, chairs and washstand. At the
foot of the bed was an automobile trunk,
and he took the straps off it to bind his
prisoner. It was initialed on the end—
V. E. St. A.
   “ I have live’ here,” said the woman, who
was watching his movements until they took
him so close to the batman that she must
see him, “ since yesterday at noon. It is

a furnish’ lodging. Here I have made my
plan, and here I have listen for hours to
tales of the army. Then when I hear’ one
that is about chums, that brings the tear
to my own eye, I say: ‘Boh! Use that.
He will like that.’ It was a good plan, still
it could not succeed.
  “ Vine is travel’ to London, and will not
be back until we have the stones and are
well away. But that man below! I have
not like’ his face from the first, and, sir,
I think you did not either. He is a beggar
who sits with his legs doubled up—a White-
chapel beggar.
  I have been in favor of a soldier, a real
soldier, who is out of work and who will
do it for ten pounds. But, no! I am
overrule’ and we mus’ have a crafty man;
one who will know how to whine, an’ not to
fall into traps.”
  “ We!” said Morgan when she had fin-
ished. “ Mademoiselle, what are you?"
  She laughed her delicious, low chuckle,
but the delicate color flushed her face.
  “ Years ago,” she answered. “ I have
hear’ a man in a music hall ask: ‘ Why is a
cow?’ The people have shriek with laugh-
ter. Answer me that, sir, and I will answer
you.”
  He looked down at her soberly, for she
had touched him as no other woman had
ever done. Indeed, she had touched him
as no other person, outside his chum, had
ever done.
  His life had changed when he walked
with her on Blackheath; the melancholy
which had sapped him had lifted to a de-
gree, and he had felt within himself the
low stirrings of his old self. The ghostly
hands of a life which he had thought dead
were plucking at him; he saw in a flashlike
vision the tall elms of his college campus,
heard voices singing. Even now, that was
where he belonged!
  The woman got to her feet, and he put
out a hand to steady her. She held up a
finger solemnly, and the haunting smile
curved her lips.
  “ You will remember this of me,” she said
in a voice in which the mocking quality
did not hide a strain of earnestness, “ that
there are good souls doing bad things, and
bad souls doing good things. I mean there
are people who have live’ inside the law
all their life, inside every law, yet they are
not good souls, and there are people who
have broken all the law, yet they are good
souls.
  “ Whenever you think of Virginie St.
Alary, you will think that, too? And now,
sir, I hear people in the garden. Will you
please to look and tell me who it is?”
There were two men in the garden, both
looking up. at the back of the house, and
at the gate was a blue uniformed and
helmeted member of the constabulary.
  “ Quickly!” said the girl with a stamp of
her foot.
  “ One is tall,” said Morgan. “ He has
big, brown eyes, and he wears a gray bowler
hat, and a checked overcoat.”
  “ And the other?”
  “ Same height,” said Morgan. “ He has
a pale blue eye, and a red face and a thin,
sandy mustache. He wears a gray tweed
suit. And there is one thing I can tell you
about him, mademoiselle, he loves cricket.’'
“ How do you know?”
  “ He was in the same compartment with
me coming down on the train. He got out
a few miles from Winchester and rode off
in a trap with a policeman.”
  “ Ah! ” she said. Morgan turned and saw
that she was pale and that she pressed one
hand against her lips. He went to her
and, putting his hands on her shoulders,
spoke earnestly.
  “ Who is he, mademoiselle? Tell me. It
may be that I can help you.”
  “ He is Cartier’s man,” she said.
  “ Cartier? The great jeweler?”
  “ Yes. It is his man, Crissey. I will tell
you he is the one most fear’ by all, for he
has the police of every country at his finger
tips. Until now I have never met him face
to face, but often we have brush’ shoulders
in the dark, as it were. He will be very glad
to see me! ”
  Morgan could feel her trembling under
his hands.
  “ Why’s he here?” he asked. “ On ac-
count of Pearsley’s diamonds?”
  “ Yes—he is here for the same reason
that we are all here. But he will try to do
other business. Perhaps he will arrest us,
and I am sure he will make me trv to tell.
                         9	A

He is a very cunning man, and in his work
he has no pity. Sir, it is for me very des-
perate.”
  “Third degree stuff!” he said, backing
away from her. The blood boiled in him.
Whatever Virginie St. Alary might be, she
was by far the most lovely woman he had
ever seen, and the thought of a heavy
handed policeman catching her and pinning
her as if she were a moth angered him un-
controllably. He forgot Vine, he forgot
his promise to Pearsley; for the time he was
a crook fighting for the head of his gang.
  “ Mademoiselle,” he said, “ I am with
you—body and soul.”
  She stared at him out of heavy eyes.
  “ You mean you will fight for me?”
  “ Yes. And I hold the trump!”
  “ Ah!” she breathed as a flash of light
went across her face. “ The stones of which
we are all so weary. You mean you will not
give them to him?”
  “No. A thousand times, no!”
  The change in her was galvanic in its
suddenness. She straightened and was sud-
denly full of vibrant life. The gray eyes
glowed, and the color flooded richly into her
face.
  “ Twice,” she said, “ you have save’ my
life—and now you have done a greater
thing, sir, for you have save’^my self-respec’.
It would be a sad thing for me to fail as a
workman and. a woman, too. But now that
I have succeed’ as woman, I have a hope
that I shall succeed as workman.

CHAPTER XI.
HAMPSTEAD WINS.
MORGAN was the last to enter the
room. Crissey sat on the edge of the
table, swinging his leg; Wales was in
a chair by the stove, and the girl stood in
the window. She had put on the small
10 A
black hat, and a coat lay over her arm. It
was an admirable effect; she seemed to be
just on the point of leaving in a motor
after calling on a dependent on some sweet
errand of mercy. Her eyes were lowered,
and her face almost completely in the
shadow.
  On closer examination Morgan could
scarcely feel that Crissey was the formidable
man the girl had thought him to be. He
turned out to be thinner and more nervous
looking with his top coat off. His shoulders
sloped so sharply that his coat sagged a
half inch away from his collar, and his
favorite gesture was a hitch which tried to
remedy the defect. A pair of gold rimmed
spectacles, the hooks of which did not quite
fit his ears, gave him an old womanish look.
  When they were all before him he ap-
peared at a loss for an opening. Morgan
seated himself on a chest, linked his hands
across his knees and waited. Crissey stared
as he entered, and nodded. He spoke al-
most apologetically, and addressed himself
to Morgan.
  “ Here we all are, Pauline Laboulaye,
Jimmy Wales, alias Frank Morton, alias
Jerry Hoke, alias Howard Dicey—”
  “ You haven’t forgotten some, have
you?” asked Wales in a nettled tone, and
the detective answered almost humbly: “I
haven’t mentioned three—but they were
names you worked under in America. You,
soldier, I met on the train, but I didn't have
the pleasure of hearing your name.”
  “ Morgan. Gunner Patrick Morgan
R. H. A., regimental number two hundred
and eighty-two thousand six hundred and
sixty-six. Here is my pass, if you care to
see it, and my number is stamped on my
boot tops, on my cap band, on my—”
  “ That’s enough,” answered Crissey,
“ quite. You didn’t go on to Southampton.”
“ No.”
  “ I remember now you spoke of stopping
off at Winchester to see a crippled old sol-
dier who ran a tobacco shop. You must
have been a trifle surprised at the people
who were keeping your shop, what?”
Morgan maintained a stony silence. The
batman was a lesser trump—he was a mur-
derer, one intensely wanted by the army,
and it must redound greatly to this man’s
306
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
benefit to get him. Morgan was planning
to turn him over at the proper moment, and
it was on the tip of his tongue to speak
then, but he thought it best to wait. In-
stead he kept a non-committal silence, and
nodded.
  “ Winchester is a lovely place,” went on
Crissey. “ Where else would you get pop-
lars and old gray walls and a little garden
like this one? You ought to see the ca-
thedral, too. Repairing it and restoring it
was one of the great engineering tasks.
For the first time,” he said impressively,
“ in the history of ecclesiastical architecture,
a diver was employed in repairing the foun-
dation.
  “ I’m a bit interested in brasses, too, and
there must have been some fine ones on
the floor there—you can see the outline
where they were sunk into the stone. Gone,
gone in the time of the Reformation with
most of the world’s best glass. Pauline,
where did you get that bruise?”
  “ Ah, sir,” she answered, startled out of
the abstraction into which his soft, monoto-
nous voice had thrown her, “ I have—”
Her tongue faltered and a red flush of
shame climbed into her cheek. She glanced
at Morgan, and at Wales, and then looked
down. Morgan was shocked—she seemed
so faltering and nonplused.
  “ Is he upstairs?” asked Crissey, and the
girl nodded.
  “ Oh, Tom!” called Crissey into the gar-
den. “ Take two men upstairs and get that
soldier chap who’s wanted at Woolwich,
will you? I fancy he’ll need first aid. Yes,”
he finished, turning back, “ Winchester is
a lovely place. Jolly historical, too. They
have a leather jack in the college which
holds about two gallons. For eight cen-
turies—eight centures, mind you—that jack
has been brought into the dining hall full
of ale for the young men. Eight centuries.
  “ I suppose Canterbury is a bit older still.
Thirteen centuries, I think, is the age of
Canterbury School. Thirteen continuous
centuries of education! My word, it speaks
for the solidity of England.”
  “ For God’s sake, what do you want?”
asked Wales in a hoarse voice. Crissey
whirled on him, surprised, apparently, by
the tension in his voice.
  “ I’m just a plain con man,” said Wales,
“ one step up from a yegg and not a very
tall step, either. I always did hate these
private dicks. You never know where to
find ’em, and you never know what they’re
going to do once they find you. Give me a
copper every time, who has a locust in his
hand and the Black Maria around the cor-
ner. They don’t kill you with suspense,
anyhow.”
  “ You will see that my frien’ is a very,
very nervous man,” said the woman. “ It
is not kindness so to treat him. Soon I
expect he shall need to go to a rest cure, and
sit in a chair, and have a nurse.”
  It was a rebuke, Morgan saw, to Wales,
and it worked. The cool voice seemed to
bring back his self-control; he stirred in his
chair, reddened, and muttered an inarticu-
late answer. Crissey turned to her when she
spoke, as a somewhat deaf person turns to
people taking part in a general conversation.
  Morgan found that his hands were cold;
one trump was gone, and there was some-
thing in the personality of Crissey that
seemed to take away one’s powers of falsi-
fying. He knew the time would come when
he himself should be questioned, and he
went cold at the thought of it.
  “ Speaking of rest cures,” said Crissey.
“ I saw a friend of yours a few weeks
ago, Pauline. Louette Anisterre. I know
she was not exactly a friend—you saw her
only three times to my knowledge, but you
know how it is—you always think that girls
of the same age are friends.
  “ Let’s see,” he said, closing his eyes and
putting his forefinger on his lips, “ you are
about the same age, I think. Yes, but she’s
the older by three months. She was bom
in January—and you were born in April.
It’s a beastly custom the French have of
cutting off a woman’s hair when she enters
prison. It’s bad enough for a convent—
she’d been washing something in lye water,
too, and her hands were swollen and knotted
and red—I keep track of my patients—and
she wanted to see me, asked me to do a
kindness for her.
  “ She has a boy with some friends, a
little chap of two or so, and she was look-
ing ahead to the time when he should go
into the army. She earns a few sous a week

in the prison and she wants them put away
at interest. At the time when the boy is of
military age, he will have a little money for
comforts. It was a jolly unpleasant task,
I can tell you, talking to her—”
  Crissey wiped his glasses. Morgan’s knee
slipped from his hands and his foot struck
the floor with a thump that made them all
jump. His heart was like ice, and when
he looked at Wales he could see that that
man had his eyes on the girl and was trem-
bling like a wet dog.
  Crissey had drawn a picture of Louette
Anisterre, but in his mind and in the minds
of his listeners was the picture of Virginie
St. Alary, in the same prison, with her hair
cut off and her hands swollen with iye
water. Of them all she was the one most
quiet. Her face had gone white, but her
voice was cool and steady as she said: “ You
cannot frighten me, sir. I am no child to
be scared by bogy men.”
  “ I suppose we all began at the same
point,” went on Crissey more cheerfully,
“ and with about the same amount of in-
formation. I suppose you found that Vine
was Pearsley’s old chum and would try
to get the stones down here some way or
other. By the way, I have seen the Mar-
quise de Perthuis, in her old chateau. She
showed me the tile under which the stones
had been hidden and from under which
Pearsley evidently took them. Like all
Frenchwomen, she is brave.
  “ I take it that you rigged a plant for the
messenger—or it may be that the stones
are here when you get here. Then you fall
out somehow or other with the little swine
that Wales picked up at the Red Lion and
he tries to murder Pauline. Wales, you’re
a rotten judge of men—rotten! Then this
big soldier blunders in here on his leave and
saves Pauline.
  “ Am I right? No? Probably not. I
am usually wrong when I let my imagina-
tion get the better of me. But let me tell
you this,” he said, shaking his finger like a
schoolmistress, “ I know that Clure wasn’t
in on this. If Clure had had it under his
direction—good God! You ought to think
of Clure once every day, Wales, and then
walk to Jerusalem on your knees. If I could
lay my finger on that man—ah!”
  He took a long breath and sank back to
his seat on the table. Wales moved for-
ward in his chair, and wet his lips.
  “ Look here, chief,” he said. “I’m a
yegg, as I told you. This stuff about honor
among thieves don’t go very far with me.
I’m out to save my own bacon—and hers.
If I put you onto Clure, if I tell you now
where you can lay your hands on him, if
I give you the low-down on some jobs that
he pulled that are still puzzling the dicks,
will you let us go? Will you?”
  Crissey pushed his glasses farther up on
his nose and stared at Wales. Morgan
caught a curious glance that Wales flashed
toward the girl, a pleading, apologetic, agon-
ized ’.ook.
  “ Why, I don’t know,” said Crissey un-
certainly, “ this is extraordinary. Very un-
usual. It would make a difference—natu-
rally, I have to have information to work
on, and 1 have to get it where I can, and
unfortunately, how I can. What can you
tell me about Clure? I give you my word
that if it is of value—”
  “ He can give you nothing of value,” said
the girl, in a low, clear voice; “ sir, my hus-
band is dead.”
  She trembled and pressed the back of her
hand against her lips. Morgan, hanging on
every word as if it were the most thrilling
play he had ever seen, felt a dull shock
run through him, first of surprise, then of
pity, for there was no pretense in the tre-
mendous grief which she was fighting. Cris-
sey watched her for a moment, then again
wiped his glasses.
  “ That was cricket, Pauline,” he said
huskily. “ Dead! What a pity. He was a
god, in looks and in his abilities. He was
too great for this life—he could live to his
height only in some great crisis such as war
furnished, and when there was no war, he
turned to crime. And, you will forgive me
if I ask how he died?”
  “ He was kill’ in an accident,” she an-
swered, her voice sunk to its lowest and
most thrilling depth, “ a street accident.
Ah, sir, it is one of the puzzles of this life
why a man who have live’ through the air
as he have live’ should die from a cab.”
  “ It is. It is.” Getting up, he walked
across the room and back briskly.

  “ I mustn’t forget what I’m here for. I
always make it a rule to be rather severe,
just after something has moved me. Of
course, that puts a different face on things.
With Clure gone, you are both about as
harmful as bees with their stings drawn.
You can buzz, but tell me, honestly, has
either of you had any luck with him gone?”
“ My God, no!” said Wales.
  “ And you, Pauline?”
  “Alas, no!”
  “ You won’t have. You’re like Napo-
leon’s marshal after he went. Wales, my
boy, drive a taxi. Pauline, go back to your
ivory carving—you will do something with
it if you work. And, remember, all women
need a manager, and the more clever and
more beautiful they are the more need they
have of one. You French girls come along
too fast. When you came out of the con-
vent at fifteen you knew more than my
grandmother did at ninety.”
  “ Yes?” she said, with a flash of spirit.
“ And you who are the all seeing eye of the
bon dieu, I have a commission for you.
Every month some one have sent me twenty
guineas, yet never have I been able to fin’
out who it is that does it.
  “ As I listen to you, I say to myself:
‘ Ah, Pauline, it is the oracle. He can tell
what makes the rivers run, and the moon
to turn, and why this year dresses are long,
and the next they are short.’ Perhaps you
can tell me who it is that sends me twenty
guineas every month.”
  “ Twenty guineas!” said Crissey. “ No,
I don’t know, and I take it very unkind of
you to rag me this way. God. knows, I’ve
worked hard enough—I’ve had every man I
could lay my hands on laboring like beav-
ers on this business, from the old general at
Woolwich down. And now, soldier, I think
I will take the stones, if you are ready.”
Morgan got to his feet and looked at the
girl. It should have been a carefully guard-
ed, significant glance, a communication con-
fined to the two of them. Instead, it was an
open-mouthed, blundering question, which
any one could read who cared to. She nod-
ded and spread out her hands in an eloquent
gesture, and he strode back into the shop.
Crissey followed him and closed the door.
THE
  On the counter was a small mountain of
black, shag tobacco, and into it as he passed
it on his way into the back room, Morgan
had plunged the Perthuis diamonds. He
retrieved them now, and gave them to Cris-
sey, who put them into a vest pocket and
buttoned his coat over it.
  “ You’re a queer chap,” he said in a
friendly voice, “ to be in the army—our
army. It’s a lark, isn’t it?”
  “ Yes,” said Morgan and heaved a sigh,
a big sigh that relieved not only the op-
pression of the moment, but of the last two
years, “ I’m going home within the year.
My time will be out.”
  “ I used to think I wanted to go to your
country and be a cowboy,” said Crissey in
the same friendly voice, “ and I suppose
you feel the same—especially after Kipling.
I understand he’s even more popular in the
States than here. I say, you’ll be about
London for a year then, won’t you?”
  “ Yes.”
  “ Keep your eye on that girl, as a favor
to me. She’s—she’s a rainbow, if you know
what I mean. She’ll do something some day
if she works. She fell across Clure’s path
just as she came out of the convent, and
she thinks now she’s a great crook. She
isn’t—and if she has some one to—to boss
her a bit, if you get what I mean, she’ll go
straight.
  “ Just between you and me,” he finished,
sinking his voice to a whisper, “ Clure
wasn’t the great man she thinks him. He
wasn’t killed by a cab—that’s a story some-
body told her to cover up his death. He
killed himself because he was cornered—
by me! And I’ve been sending her that
twenty guineas a month.”
  He looked at Morgan and nodded slowly
to drive his points home. A policeman
tapped at the door, and Crissey opened it
to receive the newspaper which the man
thrust within.
  “ Going back to America,” he said in a
louder voice, as he turned the pages to
the sporting sheet. “ It’s a good thing—
a man does best in his own country—what
I mean is, he does his best work.” His
face brightened as he read.
• “I say, Hampstead’s won again.”

By LIEUTENANT C. DONALD FEAK
AN assorted variety of liquor sodden
beach combers decorated the unin-
k viting portals of the Hawse Pipe.
They lent a vast amount of local color by
their varying attitudes and altitudes of
drunkenness and sprawling positions. A
rickety covering of boards protected them
from the white hot rays of the sun. A row
of empty whisky kegs held a promise to
thirst parched throats.
  Leaning against the rough boards that
formed the wall were two men: Mike
and John Slagin, proprietors of the dive and
den, the Hawse Pipe. They were by far the
most uninviting objects in sight. Mike was
dozing in a chair, his legs drawn up like a
grasshopper poised for a record breaking
leap. His face was long and thin; his nose
had been set aside deftly by a flying whisky
bottle and had since followed the new di-
rection with astonishing faithfulness. His
eyes were set close together, necessarily, be-
cause of the hatchet-thin head. His ears
were large, hanging downward by their
sheer weight. His brother and twin—John
Slagin—was a second edition of Mike, both
in character and bodily resemblance. Ex-
cept for the nose, which John had managed
to protect, he was Mike Slagin in another
body. Both, however, retained their twinly
qualities as to reputation.
  The Hawse Pipe itself squatted like a
huge toad on the water front of Port Reso-
lution, in the New Hebrides. Its mission
in life, governed by the twins, was to dis-
pense evil tasting drinks to careless sailor-
men. Sailormen—those who were sailormen
—did not hesitate to leave the pest hole be-
hind. Those who were unfortunate enough
to linger were promptly shanghaied by the
Slagins on the first ship requiring their ser-
vices, collecting in return a fee. Hence, real
sailors were scarce. The beach combers and
wine legs enjoyed a peaceful amnesty—a
perpetual armistice with the Slagins. No
skipper would take them, and even that
pair of vultures, Mike and John Slagin, tired
of foisting them off for seamen.
  At present Port Resolute was suffering a
scarcity of sailors.
310
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  The skipper of the schooner Paddy Boy
had just placed an order for two deck hands
at fifty dollars apiece, as soon as they were
placed aboard his vessel.
  “ An’ remember,” he said warningly—
“ remember, none o’ yer shenanigans! I
know every bamboo white man in this cor-
ner o’ hell, so don’t try an’ send me none
o’ this ballast—none o’ these human whisky
bottles. If you do—I’ll break yer necks!”
With that he stalked out.
  Mike smiled—a smile he meant to be
symbolical of his inherent honesty; his nose
distorted it into a grin that suggested the
snarl of a hyena.
  Mike cast a calculating eye over the as-
sembled beach combers. Each specimen of
manhood was a living example—a living
threat of a broken neck as a reward, instead
of fifty dollars. Hardly had the brothers
assimilated the order than Jack Mullen and
his partner, Percy, arrived.
  “ Where’s that pair o’ half witted con-
victs?” Mullen roared, glaring around.
Out of the group of lounging men Mike and
John Slagin came forward sullenly.
  “ I want two new men. The last two
disappeared two days ago.” He glared sus-
piciously at the brothers.
  Jack Mullen was of medium size, tough,
stringy, and ornery. He habitually glared
ferociously at every one. His neck was
knobbed with an enormous Adam’s apple
that worked rapidly when he grew angry.
His jowls were hung with folds of tough,
hairy skin, and his nose was long and pro-
nounced. His speech was fiery, his temper
worse, and his fists faster and more deadly
than both combined. In direct contrast was
his partner, Percy, half owner of the trim
schooner Burweed. He was small, wizen
and runty. His thin stooped shoulders were
topped by an enormous head. Superimposed
on his shiny bald pate was a cap many sizes
too small for him. Beneath the thin, sparse
eyebrows were two watery orbs, faded a
pale azure.
  He hopped from foot to foot, gnawed at
his fingers, and generally exhibited the
symptoms of advanced insanity. His small
body seemed driven by some enormous
dynamo of energy that found an outlet
only in his nervous pacings and gestures.
  Clearly distinct from the odors of the
dive was the scent of costly French per-
fume. It stained Percy’s shirt front in large
concentric circles. His remaining character-
istic was his tremendous sense of vanity.
  His speech was halting, stuttering. He
stumbled and fumbled when any one ad-
dressed him. If the anomaly can be more
complete, he was born on the north side
of San Francisco; the north side of Frisco
is to Frisco as the gas house district is to
New York.
  “ Now, looka here,” Mullen said, shak-
ing his finger at the Slagin twins—“ we
want two sailors. We don’t care how ye get
’em, nor who ye get—only get ’em! An’
none o’ yer didoes, either! If ye send any
o’ this dunnage out, ye’ll do well to slip
yer cable an’ drift away.” He indicated
the group of loafers as the unwanted dun-
nage.
  “ Sure,” Mike rejoined placatingly.
“ Sure, Cap’n Mullen, ye know us better’n
that.”
  “Aye!” answered Mullen with convic-
tion. “ That I do! An’ a more unprinci-
pled pair o’ bla’guards never lived! ”
  Frankness was one of Mullen’s outstand-
ing points. A spade was a spade, and a
Slagin a crook. The Slagins were not in the
least offended by Mullen’s truthfulness; it
was first rate advertising.
  Mullen went inside out of the sun and
sat down at a table. Percy followed meek-
ly and sat at his left. When Mullen ordered
“ smoke,” Percy meekly asked for soda
water.
  Mullen, coming ashore with the avowed
intention of getting drunk, was fast ap-
proaching the state wherein missing sailor -
men had no call, and was doing his best to
sponge Percy of his sin of teetotalism.
II.
  The Slagin twins were as nearly frantic
as flea brained human beings can be. Here
was a perfect demand, and no visible sup-
ply. Mike, by a superhuman mental effort,
had managed to make a sum total of the
receipts for the day, providing the orders
were filled. The sight of the lounging beach
combers tempted him. They had been

shanghaied so often, and mauled so much in
the process of shuttling back and forth be-
tween the ships and the Hawse Pipe, that he
had lost heart of ever disposing of them.
  John had visited every nook and corner
in the town where he might reasonably or
unreasonably be expected to find a seaman.
The only available members of the frater-
nity were two distressed mariners, nursing
a perfect collection of Solomon Island sores
commonly called yaws. He had cherished a
thought that perhaps they might be reno-
vated. When withdrawn from the thatched
hut into which they had crept, and into the
broad light of day, they disgusted even that
hardened wretch and his sense of gain. The
two sailors resembled nothing so much as
a pair of moth-eaten feather dusters, age old
and useless.
  He returned to the Hawse Pipe, and
found his brother Mike in the act of rolling
a drunk for the change which Mike had
found impossible to annex before the man
lost consciousness. It jarred John’s ethics—
this slot machine thievery.
  “ Mike, knock that off! Here’s some real
money. Come here.” John pulled him aside
and in a back room delivered his message.
Not a sailor had he been able to find. He
suggested shanghaiing a couple of native
women and putting pants on them. Mike,
however, was more cautious. Better give
Mullen a couple of beach combers than
that. It would be infinitely more healthy
were they ever caught. Mike’s hide, and
its condition of health, was the only thing
Mike cared for. He took excellent care that
it didn’t decorate any one’s bam door—
John’s included Mike played in John’s
back yard, simply because there was no one
else who would trust him, and because John
was the only one who had the foresight and
hindsight necessary to keep a check on his
brother.
  No matter how' quickly Mike moved, nor
how fast the toboggan of their morals
dropped, John was there on deck.
  “ John,” Mike said suddenly, almost
knocked full length by the thought that
struck him, “ s’pose—s’pose—” Mike was
not given to thinking, consequently when
his mind did not function it left him in a
sort of a temporary daze; it was a kind of
mental flipflop. “ John, s’pose we fix the
skipper o’ the Paddy Boy up? There’s that
that old duck of a Mullen in there, and his
sissy partner. Give ’em a knockout drop
an’ a sleigh ride; then put ’em aboard the
Paddy Boy. She’ll sail, an’ we’ll be a
hundred dollars ahead! Listen—I got an
idee!”
  He bent forward and whispered into
John’s ear. John shook his. head. Mike
repeated the whisper, with verbal garnish-
ment. John, heretofore cold, smiled,
grinned, and then laughed. He waxed
warm with the idea, clapping Mike on the
back. They chuckled at this clever piece
of close business. Oh, they were clever!
Yes, they were!
  “ Edication? Bah!” Mike said. “We
don’t need it. We wtuz born clever! Here’s
w'here we’re so dumb we’re smart!”
  When the plan was as complete as their
minds could make it, they shook hands.
The heavenly twins were thumbing their
much battered noses at Providence.
III.
  In due time Mike had mixed the drinks
—one for each of them—and turned his
back on the tray holding the whisky. John
took the drink Mike had prepared for him-
self, and gave Mike his ow'n. John’s hind-
sight w'as working smoothly.
  Later, Mullen was under the table, and
the frame of his partner, Percy, was draped
carelessly over his chair like a rag doll.
With a caution that marked him as a lesser
Napoleon, John, before the knockout drops
had taken effect, had reminded Percy that
they, the twins, w’ould see them to their
ship, should the necessity arise. That was
to be one of the main threads of the de-
fense, should the half witted brain child
of Mike’s ever turn on them, as it was apt
to do. Soon the two conspirators could be
seen carrying the inert forms of Mullen
and his partner Percy toward the water
front.
  They explained to inquisitive passers-by
that the partners had partaken of whisky
in “ large doses,” and that they—the Slagin
twins in the full bloom of civic pride—
could hardly be expected to see the much

splattered escutcheon of Port Resolute fur-
ther defiled.
  “ Don’t fergit, John,” Mike warned,
“ that big idee o’ mine. ’Tain’t every day
a chanst comes like this.”
  John wasn’t likely to. That “ idee ”
represented a bulwark, all that stood be-
tween him and the fiery furnace—a sort of
reprieve from his specially allotted reserved
corner of hell.
  “ I ain’t gonna!” John said. “ Our edi-
cation might ’a’ been neglected, but, boy,
we ain’t showin’ it none!”
  Then the twins wandered from the path
of safety. Instead of taking the recumbent
forms to their own schooner, the Burweed,
but a little way down the dock, they hired
a boatman and pulled out to the Paddy
Boy, anchored in the stream.
  When they dumped their unconscious
burdens on the deck, they held out their
palms to the mate.
  “ Wait a minute,” he said cautiously.
“ I ain’t buying a pig in a poke. What’s
this—a coupla Noah’s deck hands?”
  “ Better take what ye kin get,” Mike
said. “ They’s the only sailors in the
town.”
  “ From our own garden,” John added
with a grin.
  “ What’s wrong with ’em?” the mate
queried. “ Are ye sure they’re alive?”
  The mate had in mind a specific incident
wherein the Slagins had disposed of a dead
Chinaman under similar conditions, collect-
ing in return good legal tender.
  “ Wait ’11 they wakes up.” Mike grinned.
  The mate paid over the hundred dollars
and escorted the pair back to the gangway,
a wary eye peeled for possible straying fin-
gers. The twins left, much satisfied. Al-
though the market remained still unsatis-
fied, they were content to rest on their
laurels.
IV.
  For the first time in Percy’s life, he ex-
perienced the rocky awakening so closely
associated with Scotch whisky in large
quantities. The mate of the Paddy Boy
had dumped them into the forecastle. Mul-
len was snoring contentedly, a few feet
away. Percy sat erect, clutching his head.
A mystified gaze about him awakened no
familiarity with surroundings. He staggered
to his feet, shook Mullen violently, and,
getting no response, made his way to the
deck.
  Out of the corner of his eye he saw the
aggressive mate start toward him.
  “ Well, whatta you think you’re gonna
do?” he demanded truculently. “ Get back
in that fo’c’s’le.”
  “ But—but—” stammered Percy; “ this
isn’t my ship. Something’s wrong here!
Have we been shanghaied?” he questioned.
“ I’m Mullen’s partner. We’re owners of
the schooner Burweed. How—how did we
—we get here?”
  “ You were carried here, me bucko!
Down ye go! If ye can’t remember signing
articles, ye shouldn’t drink bad liquor.”
  “ But—but—we didn’t sign articles!”
Percy quavered. “ We were shanghaied!
That’s Jack Mullen down there, and I’m—
I’m his partner. There ”—he pointed to
the Burweed, a hundred yards distant—
“ there is our vessel!”
  “ D’ye know any more funny jokes?”
the mate asked sarcastically. “ If ye do,
ye better tell ’em to yer pal down there.
Shut up! ” he roared when Percy interrupted
him. “ Stow yer jawin’ tackle. I just paid
a hundred good American bucks fer you
two birds.”
  “ But—” Percy edged toward the side.
“ No, ye don’t!” the mate snapped, and
dived for Percy’s legs. Percy leaped clear.
The mate rose and swung an enormous fist
at him. Percy chattered for peace; he
avoided the insane rushes. He led the mate
a race around the decks, pleading for es-
cape. When he found that talking was
useless he whirled about and leaped into
the air. One foot flashed out—and patted
the mate on the nose. Before he could leap
again the mate had punished the little man
with a bony fist in a blow that shook Percy
to his heels. He staggered clear, waiting
for the daze to work itself off, and circled
again around the deck. Then, when his
brain had partially recovered, he turned
on his tormentor and fought.
  The mate disappeared beneath the ava-
lanche of flashing feet. Percy was over him,
beneath him, on both sides of him, behind
SHANGHAIED FURIES.
313
him, and always those feet were prodding
the mate into insensibility. When he
stopped, it was solely to pant for breath.
  Then Percy went forward, seized the still
insensible form of Mullen, and began drag-
ging him aft to the gangway. He hailed a
boat that was passing, and dumped the in-
ert form of Mullen into it, cast off, and
headed for the Burweed.
  Arriving at the schooner, he had his
crew hoist the unconscious Mullen aboard.
They did it in a matter-of-fact way; hoist-
ing Mullen aboard was a matter of routine.
Sometimes they did it in a bosun chair,
sometimes in a cargo net.
  Percy hesitated only long enough to erase
the signs of the struggle, then went ashore.
He headed straight toward the Hawse Pipe,
ignoring the gibes sailortown flung at him.
Their shanghaiing had already become
common gossip.
  When Percy arrived he found two incred-
ulous crimps awaiting him.
  “ I think we was shanghaied,” Percy be-
gan. “ We woke up on the Paddy Boy.
You said you would take us—to the Bur-
weed. The mate—tried to make us stay
aboard. Every one is laughing—at us.”
He gulped down the remaining words, as a
small boy might, on the verge of tears. “ I
got—to have an explanation.”
  “ Sho! ” Mike gasped. “ Do tell? Well,
whadda ye know about that? We must ’a’
picked the wrong ship. We can’t read!”
  “ But—but—” the little man gasped—
“ couldn’t you see the name Paddy Boy
had two words in it—and—the Burweed—
only one?”
  “ Naw!” Mike snarled. “ I tell ye, we
can’t read!” Then his injured pride gained
the upper hand. “ We takes ye out, an’ then
ye says ye was shanghaied!”
  “ But the mate says he gave you a hun-
dred dollars,” Percy went on, pulling on his
fingers nervously. “ I—think you’re—
telling an untruth. It was unfair—of you.”
John shook with mirth. “ Aw, gwan,
little boy! Didn’t me brudder just say we
can’t read? If ye don’t believe it, ask any
one. How d’ye expect us to make out the
name on the ship? We got all we can do to
sign our names. Didja expect us to refuse
the money? We thought it was a gift.”
  For the first time in John’s fantastic ex-
istence he had uttered the truth. They
could not read; but a missionary had pa-
tiently taught them to write their names.
That was the extent of their education.
  Percy could appeal to the commissioner
if he chose, but he knew that the twin’s
ruse would carry them through. They could
swear they thought they were taking them
to the Burweed, and were innocent of any
wrong. As he stumbled his way back to
the Paddy Boy he could hear the gibes
flung at him. All sailortown knew that
Jack Mullen and his partner had been
shanghaied. All sailortown laughed and
wheezed with mirth.
  “Babes in the wood!” they howled at
Percy. “ Go get yer mamma! ”
  Percy found Mullen on deck. His Adam’s
apple was performing spasmodically. His
eyes flashed, and he choked with suppressed
wrath. Percy explained that the Slagins
couldn’t read.
  Mullen cried “Bah!” Percy suggested
that they think it over. Mullen snarled:
“ I did! I thought it all over in one sec-
ond! I’ll wring his neck! I’ll nail his car-
cass on my fore truck for the crows to pick!
That dirty pair of blackbirds!”
  When he landed on the dock he heard the
gibes directed at them. It was like a quick
match to a powder magazine. The disgrace
was more than Mullen could bear. His soul
was struggling for vindication, and nothing
but blood would wipe out the stain. He,
Jack Mullen, twenty years in the South
Seas, to be shanghaied like a cabin boy!
He would wreck the joint! Shanghai him,
would they? Well, they had a buzzsaw by
the tail!
  Mullen was almost running, with Percy
hopping along, pleading with his partner
to stop. He prayed, ordered, commanded,
and still Mullen strode on. He had grasped
his pistol by the muzzle, intent on braining
the twins.
  Percy was frantic. “ Please, Jack, heave
to! Wait—wait! I got a plan! Stop!”
He was scared.
  The angry Mullen would have nothing
short of their scalps. “ Go ’way, Percy,”
he snarled. “ This is my turn. Go ‘way
an’ stop botherin’ me—or I’ll scuttle you.”
314
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
  “ Wait—Jack—the Bible says: ‘ The
meek — meek shall—inherit—inherit—the
earth.’ Stop!”
  “ Who the hell wants the earth,” Mullen
threw over his shoulder, “ with a coupla
coyotes like that on it?”
  Percy continued to plead, pulling'on Mul-
len's coat tails. His voice was threatening
to break. His shirt tail stuck out of his
trousers—he had lost his hat, and his mind
was in chaos. He must stop this madman!
He would murder those two ruffians. He
was about to give up when he saw Port
Resolution’s sole keeper of the law and
the jail.
  Deliberately he waited until they came
abreast of the officer—deliberately he an-
gered Mullen the more—deliberately he
hurled the last, back-breaking, soul-shaking
barb.
  “ You big cheese! You can’t handle yer
liquor! You big drunken bum! Mike ’11
beat yer head off!” Percy shrieked, and he
danced up and down in defiance.
  This insult referred to Mullen’s lack of
capacity for alcoholic drink was deep and
deadly.
  “ What?” Mullen roared, stopping.
" You little runt, you little sawed-off hunk
o’ nothin’! You mean to say that that
skunk ’11 lick me? D’ye mean to insinuate
that / can’t carry my liquor?”
  “ Yes,” Percy shrieked again, shaking his
puny fist, “yes, you big Irish Mick!”
  Then Mullen hit him. For the first time
in all their career, they quarreled. The
officer advanced on Mullen. Percy grabbed
the gun and yelled hysterically: “ He hit
me! He hit me! Arrest him, officer! Lock
him up!” Over and over tumbled the irate
Mullen. Percy clutched the pistol, and
after a short battle, Mullen was led away
by the constable. The tussle had drawn a
crowd.
  “I’ll git that little runt, too!” Mullen
roared back at them. Some of the specta-
tors warned Percy to disappear. “ He’ll
git you, little feller. Better make knots out
o’ here.”
  Percy stood aghast at his own audacity.
  “ Do you—you think—think so?” he
quavered, reaction robbing him of his
strength.
  The news that Mullen and his partner
had quarreled spread all over town. They
were known as fast friends by every one,
and the split came as a thunderbolt. Sev-
eral minutes after it had happened, Mike
and John Slagin were breathing easier.
They grew solicitous for Percy’s aid. The
little chap had wandered about forlorn,
saddened.—greeted everywhere by the warn-
ing to “ drift.” At last, seeking companion-
ship of any sort, he had gone to the Hawse
Pipe.
  John asked him sarcastically: “ Where’s
yer knittin’, ole lady? I hears yer got a
bust in the jaw from yer pal. Didn’t crip-
ple ’im, did ye?”
  Percy dropped into a chair, tired, as if
from long running. He pulled at his nose,
moved his feet nervously, and at last an-
swered: “ Jack says he’ll kill me! And he
will! I’m—I’m afraid! I gotta go soon—
before he gets out,” he finished helplessly.
  “ Yep,” Mike said judicially, “ he’ll prob-
ably kill you like a worm now! There’s
the Paddy Boy goin’ to Fiji to-night.”
  “ But—but—my schooner share—what ’11
I do with that?” Percy trembled with fear.
“ I can’t give ’im that. What ’11 I—I—
do?” He was wringing his hands. “ It’s
worth—five—five thousand dollars. It’s all
I—I—got!” The little old man was gulp-
ing back the tears. Who’ll buy my half
from me?” he demanded chokingly.
  Mike looked at his brother. Another
brain child that showed all the humanity
of a snake and all the appearance of a
hyena. They drew apart, leaving Percy
with his wreck of friendship to suffer alone.
  They talked and whispered and argued,
at last reached a decision and came forward
again.
  “ Ye know ye’re in trouble,” Mike began,
“ an’ money’s scarce.” He seemed to con-
descend in his bargaining. “ But me’n me
brudder ’11 take yer share o’ the schooner
offen yer hands; the best we kin do is five
hundred dollars.” He finished with a wave
of his hand that was meant to impress
Percy with his munificence.
  “ But—it’s worth five thousand—not—
not counting the—cargo,” Percy chattered.
“ I oughta have—more than that.”
  Mullen’s partner was fidgetting, casting
SHANGHAIED FURIES.
315
quick glances at the jail behind him. John
shook his head in a negative to Mike, and
whispered in his ear “ Put the screws on
’im. We’ll freeze Mullen out in a week.”
  “ Don’t fergit.” Mike paused impres-
sively. “ They might let Mullen out to-
night. You gotta be out o’ this place
afore then. Five hundred dollars is all I’ll
pay.” Mike still had the sledge hammer
up his sleeve; when Percy wavered, he
brought it out.
  “ I guess I better go down an’ bail Mul-
len out. Come on, John; Mullen ’11 give
us a hundred fer interest, anyhow.”
  He started away, followed by John
Slagin.
  “Wait—wait!” Percy almost shrieked.
“ I’ll take—take it!” When the two came
back, Percy was almost groveling on his
knees.
  “ I’ve got a little—stake stowed away—
from some pearls—maybe that ’11 be enough
to get away with,” he rambled on. “ Don’t
bail Mullen out till I get away, please!”
He was scraping his feet nervously together.
  “ All right, but yer better be good, or
we’ll git him out. Then ye’d better say yer
prayers. Come on, we’ll look at yer damn
ship! Un’erstand, we’re doin’ it as a favor
fer you. We’ll probably lose money on it.”
  Percy incoherently agreed. They left the
saloon and started toward the Burweed,
the Slagin twins complimenting themselves
on their cleverness.
  Arrived at the schooner’s berth, her well-
kept rigging, teakwood decks, and clean
paint made Mike’s mouth water with gain.
  They went below and into the cabin.
The Slagins casting appraising eyes about
them at the well-kept room and found it
impossible to hide the grin that comes of
success in close bargaining. With the cargo,
their share was worth about ten thousand
dollars.
  Percy had gone into his room and re-
turned with a large, official looking piece
of paper, and a pen. He scribbled a mo-
ment, surveyed w'hat he had written, then
passed the paper to Mike.
  “ Sign here—it’s all straight and proper.
Give—give me the five hundred dollars.”
  Mike drew the paper toward him and
with much physical labor scrawled his sig-
nature, gazing at it as if it was suddenly
imbued with supernatural powers. All he
had to do, was to sign his name, and the
schooner was his. Mike passed the paper to
John, who signed it in turn with an equal
amount of physical effort, then Percy hand-
ed them a copy and put the original in his
pocket. He had gathered his portable be-
longings together and stood ready to leave.
  Followed by the Slagin brothers, he went
on deck, and headed forward, toward the
fo’c’s’le. At the entrance to the latter was
a sand locker. He lifted the heavy hatch
and was preparing to enter when Mike in-
terrupted. Here was additional meat for
the hammer. For the moment he had for-
gotten the stake of which the little man had
spoken.
  “ Hey! Where’re you goin’ to?” he
questioned. John seconded the demand
belligerently.
  “ I gotta get something—something I—
got—here,” Percy mumbled'. “ It—it isn’t
in the agreement—you—you didn’t buy
nothing but my share of the schooner,” he
said, fumbling at the latch.
  “ No, you don’t, little boy,” John snarled,
“ the schooner’s ours. We got the paper
here. Ye don’t take nuthin’ out o’ the ship
now, see?” Cupidity blazed in their nar-
row, piggish eyes. This was the summit
and culmination of their day’s luck.
  “ If we bails Mullen out, ye won’t need
any money where ye’ll be agoin’,” Mike re-
minded him calmly. “ Don’t fergit, we got
the paper, all signed an’ bindin’. We got
our signatures on it!” Anything that had
Mike’s name on it was possessed of a mys-
terious power—the power in direct ratio
to the effect it required him to scrawl it.
  “ But—” Percy was flustered. “ You—
you bought the schooner—not my savings.”
The little man was writhing, biting his
nails; his eyes were filled with tears, his
feet shuffled and twisted. “ Please—please
—I gotta get it! I—I gotta!” He dived
for the narrow opening and wedged his
shoulders in.
  “ No, yer don’t,” Mike growled, jerking
him out. “Beat it!” He advanced on
Percy, menacingly. “ G’wan! Make
knots, fer I’m goin’ ter bail Mullen out in
an hour.”
316
ARGOSY-ALT-STORY WEEKLY,
  They shoved and shouldered the protest-
ing Percy aside and on to the wharf.
  As soon as Percy was on the dock, Mike
and John piled hastily for the sand locker,
and wedged themselves through the narrow
opening.
  “ Ho! Mike, me boy, ain’t this luck?”
John chuckled. “ Ain’t this a fine piece o’
business? A crackin’ fine vessel she is, an*
all ours, too. We got the papers all signed,
an’ they’re bindin’!”
  “ An’ a stake all stowed away, too,” Mike
added; “ a nice little nest egg. Let’s go an’,
dig in the sand.”
  Conversation languished in the heat of
the search. They dropped to their knees
and pawed the clean sand over, digging in
the comers, in the center, everywhere. Per-
spiration began to dot their faces. They
dug harder, and faster. The sand fell in
cascades from their backs, where their eager
hands had flung it. John found a piece of
coral rock; Mike snatched it, thinking it
the fruit of their search. They had half
buried themselves in the sand when John
suddenly stopped. Over his head had
sounded a stealthy footfall.
  Suspicion began to dawn slowly, like the
head of a turtle, breaking through a scum
of slime on a pool of stagnant water. The
suspicion materialized into a hatch top that
rattled and jammed into place, the bolt
shooting home.
  “ Hey I On deck, there! We’re down
here!” Mike shouted at the top of his lungs.
“ Open up!”
  They heard a voice answer, a voice that
was mild, gentle, and reassuring.
  “ I’m—I’m sorry—can’t let things go on
like this—terrible—regrettable.”
  It was Percy. His voice quavered.
  “ I’m going down—and bail Mullen out.”
They heard his footsteps grow fainter and
fainter. Then Mike began to shout fran-
tically
  “ Let us out! We own half o’ this
schooner! We order ye to! ” Then to John
he gasped “ He’s tryin’ to git out o’ his bar-
gain! He’s craw-fishin’! There ain’t no
stake down here—he was lyin’—it’s a
trick!”
  Another voice, harsh, forbidding, sounded
through the hatch
  “ Youse guys pipe down! I gotta hand-
ful o’ marline-spikes here. We’ll get yer
hair parted in a minute.”
  “ But this is our ship. We’re the own-
ers!” Mike yelled. “ We got the papers to
prove it.”
  The ominous rattle of a marline-spike
sounded on the hatch. “ G’wan back to
sleep!”
  John gazed once at Mike—Mike gazed
once at John, and with that they hurled
themselves forward. The sand locker rever-
berated with the sounds of combat. Groans,
shrieks, curses, and thumps came forth.
Accusations, denunciations, denials, and
over it all, was one of Percy’s sailors sitting
on the hatch, marline-spike in hand.
V.
  The schooner Burweed was at sea. The
early morning sun bathed the-clean limbed
little vessel in a flow of molten brass. Two
figures were on the afterdeck. Percy was
explaining to Mullen
  “ You see, Jack, I hadda make the fight
look real. I hadda do everything up all
ship-shape and Bristol fashion.”
  Two angry, wild-eyed men interrupted
him.
  “Yer crooks! We got yer where we want
yer. Yer shanghaied us! Yer ain’t got
our names on yer articles! We own half o’
this schooner. Here’s our bill o’ sale.”
Mike waved it over his head. “ We signed
it, an’ it’s bindin'.”
  The bosun led them away forward, hand-
ed them a deck scrubber, and commanded':
“ None o’ yer slack, savvy? Massage
that deck a while.”
  Mullen had Percy by the collar. “ Ye
little runt! What did ye do?”
  “ It’s—it’s like this, Jack,” Percy chat-
tered, “ they can’t read. They—they said
so themselves—they shanghaied you an’
me—’cause they couldn’t read the ship’s
name.
  Mullen cut him off: “ But they have a
bill o’ sale, all signed by themselves. You
saw it!”
  “ ’Tain’t a bill of sale,” Percy answered.
“ They signed articles as deck hands for a
six months’ voyage.”
By HARRY VARLEY
WORDS are queer creatures. They
have in them more possibilities
for good or evil than men and
women. They are not, as you may think,
self-contained colored blocks of wood,
which, arranged in certain sequence have a
definite meaning. No! Sometimes they
live and breathe with the accumulated
power of a volcano which has stored up
cussedness for a thousand years and, with
no heraldic grumblings, erupts and vomits
fire and brimstone on an innocent world.
  One word sent Howard Jackson halfway
around the earth. It was not a woman’s
“ no ” or “ yes.” Goodness knows those
two words have enough to answer for.
  Jackson was strolling through a native
bazaar in Bombay doing nothing for once
in his busy career. Two women—Ameri-
cans, he judged from their dress—were look-
ing at some ivory chessmen. As Jackson
passed them, the tail end of a speech fell
on his ear: “ —reminds me of Miller’s shop
on Fifty-Seventh between Fifth and Madi-
son.”
  That “ Madison ” stopped Jackson in his
tracks. It is possible for a drowning man
to see his entire life in the moment before
he loses consciousness. For this one word
Madison flooded Jackson’s ears and literally
swamped his mind, a slice of his life passed
before his eyes a million times faster than
the speeded-up movies could show it.
  He was seven years younger and back in
New York City. In a little front room in
the brownstone house at 340 Madison Ave-
nue—he and Jane Overton were talking.
It was two hours before steamer time.
  “ You will be true to me, Jane, even
though we have agreed not to bind each
other with a formal engagement?”
  “ Yes, Howard.”
  '• And you will wait for me. I know
that I’ll make good with the Standard Rub-
317
318
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
ber Company. And when I do—it ’11 only
take a year or two—I’ll come back for you.
Will you wait?”
  “ I will. I love you, Howard, and I
don’t care if you stay away ten years,
you’ll find me waiting here by the window
when you come back ”—which was a silly
promise to make, particularly in New York.
  They kissed and parted. On the ship
Howard wrote several letters. When he ar-
rived in Bombay, he immediately became
altogether entangled in the business of
“ making good.” So that he neglected his
correspondence. Finally he stopped an-
swering Jane’s letters, until she, in her pride,
could write no more.
  For a time conscience gnawed Howard’s
internals, but he opposed his conscience by
all the tricks men use, and then one night
he figuratively seized his conscience by the
scruff of its neck and kicked it out of his
existence.
  And he made good. Money came to him
easily. Work, even under the scorching sun
of India, was second nature to him. Whisky
and soda and women—the terrible trio of
temptations for the American in India,
could not touch his life. His mind was a
vase, full of the pea soup of business—too
full for one drop of the perfume of romance
to be added.
  It was too full until, after the long seven
years, he heard that one word Madison.
The word haunted him. It had no definite
form. It was fluid—alive. Neither had it
a settled color. It was opalescent. But in
every shape and every light it fastened
itself upon his imagination. He would wake
up at night hearing again the woman in
the bazaar say Madison.
  And soon he realized that this thing had
become a part of him—that he could never
rest or be happy again unless he made his
pilgrimage to his special Mecca which was
340 Madison Avenue, New York City,
there to confess his sins of omission to the
lovely Jane Overton and receive her for-
giveness.
  He made up his mind and packed his
trunk simultaneously. As he put in layers
of shirts he thought of the great desira-
bility of Jane, that her lovely personage
would be one to possess. How she would
grace his household and make his exile
sweet! By the time he clamped down the
lid, he was already married, little Jane and
Howard, aged three and five approximately,
were playing in the garden and the ayah
was calling them to tiffin.
  All the way across the ocean Howard
dreamed his dreams of married happiness—
to the great annoyance of some of the wom-
en passengers who would have been glad to
flirt with him could they have broken down
the barrier of visionary stuff more real than
concrete, that surrounded or enveloped him.
  That Jane may not be waiting never oc-
curred to him. Not once did the faintest
suspicion cross his innocent heart that she
might not have kept her promise—that she
would have been a foolish maiden if she
had, and that, however much she loved
Howard, he had been away seven years and
she lived in New York.
  New York! And Jane was a lovely crea-
ture who w'ould be exceptionally fascinating
to the jaded, bored men of Manhattan.
Through a habit formed because of an
invalid mother who needed her care, she had
always kept herself away from the turmoil
of Broadway and had a minimum of seven
hours’ sleep at night. Therefore, she was
radiant as a fresh May morning in Killar-
ney.
  Jackson was spared from even the imag-
ining of knowledge that might have proved
his mission a wild-goose chase.
  When he saw the skyline of New York
it gave him a thrill. It meant Jane to
him. A white gull, sweeping over the ship
as it steamed through the Narrows, sang
Jane to him—but a prophetic fog came
up and shut out the gull and New York
and slowed down the boat, until it was late
before they finally docked and had passed
the customs.
  Jackson taxied directly to the Biltmore
across the street from 340 Madison. He
tried to get a room on the Madison Avenue
side of the hotel so that he could look across
at her house and think of her sleeping
there not knowing how near he was. There
was none. He had to take a room on the
Forty-Third Street side of the hotel. He
consoled himself by thinking of the good
night’s sleep he would get, the careful toilet
ONE WORD.
319
he would make in the morning, and of the
fact he would look so much better after
sleeping again in a bed that kept still.
  He undressed, put on his white silk
pyjamas, stood in front of the mirror in his
room. He looked at his face and imagined
he had not changed much in seven years.
True, he was tanned and had grown a small
mustache in imitation of the British officers
he knew in Bombay. Then he rehearsed
his meeting with Jane. Trying to put an
agony of appeal into his voice he talked
aloud, seeking to get just the right note in
it and with the note the Barrymore gesture
of supplication.
  “ Jane! My Jane! I have come back
to you. Will you forgive me?” He even
debated whether it would be better to say
“ Come back to you ” or “for you."
  He dropped into sleep still murmuring:
“ Jane! My Jane.”
II.
  Now while he was sleeping we could go
back and find out what happened to Jane,
but we may as well dispose of Howard
Jackson.
  He arose in the morning. He bathed.
He shaved, trimmed his mustache and
dressed carefully in a light suit. Then he
went out to meet his Jane. He came to
the corner of Forty-Third and Madison and
his eyes leaped across to find the brown-
stone dwelling at 340. Instead, he saw cut
in the side of a big commercial office struc-
ture, “ Canadian Pacific Building.”
  Bewildered, stunned, literally over-
whelmed by the shock that Jane had gone,
that life had played a cruel trick on him,
he stood stock still for fully five minutes.
The absurd asininity of his behavior in
dashing across the earth when a cable would
have saved him the trip, smashed him be-
tween his mind’s eyes. Turning, he dashed
into the hotel, talked hurriedly with the
man at the “ Travel ” desk, picked his ship
for India and checked out of the Biltmore
to go to the Astor Hotel until his boat
sailed. He simply could not stay near
the scene of his tragedy.
  Three days later he boarded the boat and
went back to Bombay, where, confidential-
ly, whisky and soda and women, the trio of
temptations that beset Americans in India,
found that competition against them had
vanished. Which is what Jackson richly
deserved. He had no right to treat the
lovely Jane as he had.
  Now that he is disposed of—what of
Jane?
HI.
  Jane’s mother died soon after Jackson’s
letters stopped. That was coincidence—not
cause and effect. She left Jane the two
brownstone houses at 340 and 342 Madison,
but they were both so heavily encumbered
with mortgages and other obligations that
she had to give up one of the houses to
save the other.
  Fate flipped a coin. Her lawyer found
a weakness in the deed to 340 not visible in
the deed which held 342. The result made
It unwise for her to keep the corner house at
340 so she moved into 342. She could wait
for Howard there just as well.
  A few months elapsed. Along came the
Canadian Pacific Company and bought up
the entire block except the house and lot
at 342. They argued with Jane. They
used every method they knew to persuade
her. They made out a deed of sale and left
the purchase price open for Jane to fill in—
but she refused. Her own lawyer wept
copiously thinking tears would melt her ada-
mant will. He discovered that water takes
a long time to wear away stone. He quit
finally as they all had to quit.
  Around the brownstone house at 342
Madison they built a big white building.
It overshadowed the house. It does to this
very day, but it could cast no shadows on
the soul of Jane. Within her all was sun-
shine, and the birds were singing “ He will
came back for me. He said he would.”
  She had wooers. Several tried, in the early
days of the Canadian Pacific controversy,
to win her hand and make her sell out. She
was obdurate. Only one succeeded in es-
tablishing himself more or less permanently
in Jane’s life.
  He was Rodney Stewart, a young bank
clerk who had pushed Jane from the path
of an automobile one wet day and rescued
her beaded bag from a puddle. He used
320
ARGOSY-ALLSTORY WEEKLY.
a silk handkerchief to wipe the bag and
start a conversation.
  So Rodney Stewart had called on Jane
three times a week for years. Regularly he
drove up to the house on Sunday morning,
took Jane for a drive on Long Island and
always he proposed to her three or four
times before she kissed “ her dear brother ”
good night.
  Jane had told Rodney about the lover
who had sailed away. A hundred times
Rodney tried to show’ Jane the absurdity of
waiting for one who had forgotten her or
who was dead. He told her of the deadly
cobra, the man eating tigers, the cholera,
the fever, the whisky and soda and women
—all the dire possibilities of India, but
Jane put her rosy fingers on his mouth and
would not let him talk.
  But the years began to have their effect.
Time was on Rodney’s side. A woman who
wants love, husband, babies, will not forever
be denied. Nature waits in ambush, and
sometimes, though it be in the most inop-
portune, inappropriate and unromantic
time, Nature will have her way and the bar-
rier will be downed.
  And so it was with Jane. One Sunday
morning she was standing in the window
looking across the avenue at the Biltmore.
Rodney was glancing at the morning Herald
picture section, when suddenly he looked
up to ask Jane to come and see a new
picture of Mrs. Castle. But the words died
on his lips. The sunlight, softened as it
filtered through the courtains, fell on Jane’s
face and he saw such a loveliness that
poets vainly try to describe.
  It was a new Jane. The same yellow
hair, the same blue eyes and small, delicate-
ly chiseled aristocratic nose, and the full,
beautifully lined lips. But there was some-
thing different. Not just expression. It
was a feeling, that was the word, a feeling in
her face he had never seen before.
  Love swept through him. Inspired with
                               XJ
 a masterful courage strangely new, he
 called:
   “Jane! Come here!”
    Without wonder, smilingly and with ut-
 ter surrender, she went at his outstretched
 arms, and lifted her lips.
    “ No more of this ‘ brother ’ stuff, Jane.”
    “No, dear!”
    “ You will marry me!”
    It was a declaration—not a question.
    “ Any time you say, Rodney.”
    And so for a time they talked the inti-
  mate and glorious nonsense which would
  have to be set down if this were a love
  story. But the only part of their conversa-
  tion which we care about is this.
   “ Tell me, Jane, why have you refused
 me for so many years? No! Never mind
 that. Tell why, on this Sunday morning
 of all mornings, you finally gave in and
 promised to marry me.”
   She waited a moment. Rodney saw the
 same feeling come over her face that he saw
 when she stood in the window.
   “ For seven years I waited for Howard
 Jackson. You know that. I used to dream
 about him at night. When I curled my
 hair, I would look in the glass and see his
 face instead of mine. It grew worse lately.
 I began to be afraid I was losing my mind.
 So to-day, this morning, something hap-
 pened while I was at the window. I—I—”
 She stopped. He squeezed her hand.
    “ Yes, Jane! Tell me.”
    “ I actually thought I saw Howard Jack-
  son himself standing on the corner looking
  up at the house. But, of course, it was my
  imagination. This man had a mustache.
  Besides, Howard never wore a light suit
  and this man did. I don’t want to keep
  on seeing ghosts, so I decided to forget
  him. You will help me, dear, won’t you?”
  They kissed each other.
   At that precise moment Howard Jackson
 was paying his bill at the Biltmore across
 the street.

Break down that wall
between you and
your boy!
   That baby whose first smile was di-
 rectly into your eyes, that toddler who
 took his first steps with his little hand
 gripped round your fingers, is he growing
 away from you?
   Now he is weighing, judging, making
 his own conclusions. Each careless re-
 buff cautions him to build a wall of re-
 serve against ridicule. Each misunder-
 standing builds the wall higher and thicker.
   Between the ages of 10 and 20, what
 boys most need is association with fellows
 and men of strong character, who under-
 stand them and whom they understand.
   This is the companionship that a half-
 million boys are finding and being de-
 veloped by in The American Boy.
   Each story is written to let boys face
 a real boy-problem and teaches them how
 a regular fellow will meet and solve it.
 Its articles are instructive, boy-building,
 man-building, and suggest all that is best
 and healthiest to a boy.
   Right now you are facing the Christ-
 mas season. What an opportunity to
 break down the wall that separates you
 and your boy. Give him a year’s sub-
 scription to The American Boy.

a wonderJuT idea
in "Christmas gifts
THE gift of a Corona will mean more this year
than ever before. You can now select a
Corona Keyboard which exactly suits the vocation
of the one who is to receive it.
There is scarcely anyone who does not need a
Corona nowadays. In business, in school, in the
home. Corona is fast replacing the pen.
 It’s a satisfying gift to give, or to receive—wonder-
 fully durable, light, compact, yet big in the work
 it does.
Corona has a 10-inch carriage, a two-color, auto-
matically reversing ribbon, back spacer, margin
release, platen release, paper .elease, self-spacing
carriage return—everything you would expect in
a heavy machine—yet it costs only half as much.
Place your order today for one or more Coronas
for Christmas. Your dealer will deliver the
machines, specially packed in beautiful Christmas
cartons, on whatever date you specify. If your
phone book doesn't list "Corona," mail the coupon
for the address of the nearest store.

WHAT’S the use of living when
you’re only half alive? You
get up in the morning and you
don't have the pep of a jelly fish.
Your work is a burden and life
has ceased to give you a thrill.
You don’t seem to get anywhere
and nobody cares whether you do
or not. What’s the use fellows?
Call the Undertaker, for you’re
dead and you don’t know it.
      A New Life
   Stop! It’s all wrong. There is
another life right here before you.
A new and a better one. A life
that is full of thrills and sunshine.
Every day opens new worlds to
conquer, new joys, new friends and
lasting ones. Come with me and
let me guide you to it.
   I have a system that knocks those
gloom bugs higher than a kite.
I’ll put pep in your old backbone
that will make you feel like a jack
rabbit. I’ll put a spring to your
step and a flash to your eye so that
your own friends won't know you.

Oarmonicas
All the other gifts are forgotten when they
see how easy it is to coax those joyful Yule-
tide tunes out of the melodious Hohner!
 HOLIDAY
 HARMONY
“There is no music you enjoy like the music
you make yourself.” That's as true of your
friends as it is of you. Give them Hohners
for Christmas —no other gift at the price will
give half the pleasure. The Hohner is a
whole orchestra in itself—it makes real music
—sweet, tuneful, delightful music. Anybody
can learn to play it in an hour. Ask the
dealer for the Hohner Free Instruction Book;
if he is out of them, write “M. Hohner, New
York.” Hohner Harmonicas are sold every-
where; 50c. up.
“Own Your Own Hohner”
   Are you self-conscious about the
   impression you make on people ?
Ij^E.VR is probably the greatest handicap anyone
can havo in life. It keeps you from being
your own real self—from »loing your downright
best and from getting on in life as you should.
  Personal appearance has a lot to do with the
way you feel. Clothes count, of course. But still
there is one thing so many people overlook—
something that at once brands them as either
fastidious or careless—the teeth.
  Notice today how you. yourself, watch another
person’s teeth when he or she is talking. If the
teeth are not well kept they at onco become a
liability.
  Only the right dentifrice—consistently used-
wili protect you against such criticism". Usterine
Tooth Paste cleans teeth a new way. The first
tube you buy will prove this to you.
 You will notice the improvement even in the
first few days. And. moreover, just as Llsterine
is tho safe antiseptic, so Listerino Tooth Paste
is the safe dentifrice. It cleans, yet it cannot
injure tho enamel.
 What are your teeth saying about you today?

She Found A Pleasant Way To
Reduce Her Fat
  She did not have to go to the trouble of
diet, exercise or unpleasant greases and
salves. She found a better way, which
aids the digestive organs to turn food into
muscle, bone and sinew instead of fat.
  She used Marmola Prescription Tablets,
which are made from the famous Marmola
prescription. They aid the digestive sys-
tem to obtain the full nutriment of food.
They will allow you to eat many kinds of
food without the necessity of dieting or
exercising.
  Thousands have found that Marmola
Prescription Tablets give complete relief
from obesity. And when the accumula-
tion of fat is checked, reduction to normal,
healthy weight soon follows.
  All good drug stores the woild over sell
Marmola Prescription Tablets at one dollar
