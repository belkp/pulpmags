Prison of Time...............................by Eando Binder 12

        When Barry Carver's piano was shot down in the Sahara desert, his precious
        message undelivered to the Allies, it meant the Dictator powers would win
        the Great War. But that was before Barry found Shorraine, Land of the
        Mirage, and the demon people of Phoryx, who schemod to enslave all Earth-
        mon—and Sha-tahn, alter-ego of Satan, and spfrit of Dictators of all genera-
        tions!

Ananias..............................by L. Sprague de Camp 68

        In the war of the future will belligerent nations fight only with scientific ma-
        chines of destruction? Or will they also uso a more sinister weapon—subtle
        propaganda!

Under the North Pole.........................by Ed Earl Repp 80

        Hopelessly lost in the frozen Arctic, Anthropologist George Kane stumbled
        on that strange workroom, deep in the blue depths of a glacier. But ho didn't
        dream he had discovered a mad scientist's ice-palace laboratory—and a wild
        scheme to bring world-chaos by demagnetizing the North Pole!

The Stronger...................by Fredric Arnold Kummer, Jr. 94

       Instead of a space-trip from Venus to Earth, Jim Weston found himself a
       shanghaied member of a slave-crew, Mars-bound on Saturnian Slane's rocket
       ship. And when they crashed on the red desert of Mars, this Earthman showed
       a Saturnian bully that on any planet it's guts, not size, that makes the man!

Insight.............................by Manly Wade Wellman 59

       What would you do if you had a pair of contact eye-lenses that x-rayed
       cloth and wood? Perhaps, like Sam Sterrett, you'd find yourself in a kidnap-
       gang’s kill-trap—with the finger of death pointing at your sweetheart!

is the time f

Business is Searching

for YOU/ if ... .

RIGHT now, in many lines, there is a search
. for really good men—managers, leaders—
men who can take charge of departments, busi-
nesses, branch offices, and get tilings humming.

  As always, there are not enough ordinary
jobs to go ’round—but rarely before, in the
history of American business, has there been
so much room at the top! And new jobs are
being created by the business pick-up in many
lines—jobs that pay splendidly and that open
the way to lifetime success.

  Ordinarily, there would be plenty of men to
fill these jobs—men in junior positions who
had been studying in spare time. But most men
have been letting their training slide during

these dark years of depression___“What’s the

use?”—You have heard them say. Perhaps
there has been some excuse for sticking to any
old kind of a job one could get the past few

FROZEN UTOPIA

(The Cold Truth)

Dear Sir:

  Is it possible to produce a tempera-
ture of absolute zero?—J. G., Harris-
burg, I’a.

  For all practical purposes, scientists
have reached absolute zero — and
strange indeed are some of the experi-
mental results. 79° below zero (on our
familiar Fahrenheit scale), recorded in
the arctic by Amundsen in 1905, is be-
lieved to be the greatest natural cold
ever reported. But this, compared to
the laboratory efforts of cryogenic or
low-temperature experimenters, was
but a warn summer day. At the Uni-
versity of California, matter has been
chilled to 1/10° above zero on the Kel-
vin absolute scale, which is nearly 273°
below zero on the Centigrade scale or—
button up your overcoat!—minus 459°
Fahrenheit!

  At this temperature, hydrogen lique-
fies—and helium defies gravity! Lique-
fying within two degrees of absolute
zero, helium almost completely loses its
viscosity, the property by virtue of
which fluids and gases resist change of
shape. Surface films will then spread
over any object brought into contact
with the helium, and will even climb out
of the liquid and ascend to considerable
heights in defiance of gravity!

  The world record for low tempera-
ture, however, belongs to Holland.
Using the same method as the Ameri-
cans, but more powerful equipment,
Dutch scientists have plumbed to only
forty-four ten-tliour,.aidths of a degree
above absolute zero. The ingenious

method is based on the principle that
magnetizing matter heats it, while de-
magnetizing lowers its temperature.
Magnetic salts, pre-cooled with liquid
helium, are magnetized and the heat
thus generated is drawn off with he-
lium vapor. Then the salts are further
chilled by demagnetization, and repeti-
tion of the cycle literally jams the sub-
stance down toward the objective of ab-
solute zero, the temperature at which
matter is wholly deprived of heat.

 Though the goal may never be
reached, even its vicinity is studied
with profit by chemists. All chemical
reactions obey the laws of thermody-
namics, governing the relations be-
tween heat and energy. In the region
of absolute zero, it is possible to foretell
whether certain chemical combinations
are thermodynamically possible! If
not, there is no use seeking a chemical
activator or catalyst for an impossible
combination. But of much greater pos-
sible benefit to mankind than mere
tune-saving are cryogenic experiments
on living organisms.

  Certain cells—spores, infusoria, bac-
teria—all of them dry or nearly dry, are
actually able to survive temperatures
close to absolute zero! In that extreme
cold, the organisms go into a state of
suspended animation—but resume nor-
mal living when thawed out. Cells of
higher water content, however, ordina-
rily die when subjected to this freezing
because their internal liquid crystalizes
and its molecular structure is altered.
But now a way has been found to avoid
this damage—and possibilities appear
which stagger the imagination.

  If organisms are frozen in a split sec-
ond with liquid hydrogen, their mole-
cules are immobilized before they can
change pattern. They become like
glass, solid but with the molecular ar-
rangement of liquid. In this way sus-
pended animation has been induced in
yeast cells, which may be revived after
being preserved 10,000 years—without

  PRISON OF TIME

by EANDO BINDER

When Barry Carver was shot down In ih.e Sahara, his urgent message undelivered, the ~'
tator nations were about to crush the Allies. But that was before Barry found
Shorraine, Land of the Mirage and the demon people of Phoryx, who schemed
to enslave all Earthmen—and Sha-tahn, guiding power of all Dictators!

  Carver raised his head and looked
through the heat haze that lay over the
mighty Sahara. The cloudless blue of
sky was clear. They had left, satisfied
that he could not have survived both
the business-like strafing of their ma-
chine-guns and the crash.

  Barry Carver grinned. They were
wrong. By a miracle he had come
through unscathed. Not a bullet had
touched him. He remembered nothing
of the crash. Obviously his body had
been thrown clear, onto the cushioning
sand.

BARRY C A R V E R groaned. A
great light pressed against his
tortured eyelids. He opened them
and winced. A torrent of sunlight
stabbed into his eyes, blindingly. He
rolled himself over^ spitting sand from
his mouth. He raised a hand to the ten-
der lump .on his head. How long had
he been out? What had happened?

  Memory stabbed into his mind, as
the sunlight had stabbed into his eyes.
The attack, by three enemy ships whose
wings bore the black swastika! They
had brought his lone ship down—

ANSWER, IN THIS TIMELY BOOK-LENGTH SUPER-SCIENCE NOVEL!
14

DYNAMIC Science Stories

  He looked around.

  There his small ship lay, a twisted,
shattered wreck that would never fly
again. It had come down like a rock.
The engine had buried itself out of sight.
Rows of bullet-holes, neat and orderly,
zigg-zagged across the crumpled wings.
Gasoline soaked sand rapidly evapo-
rated in the hot sun. By that he knew
he had been unconscious only a few
minutes. Why the plane hadn’t burst
into flame, toasted him to a corpse, was
another miracle. Well, he must accept
the little finger of fate.

  He came to his knees, and suddenly
found himself dizzy, almost nauseated.
He fought off his weakness. No time
now to be a weakling. He must carry
on somehow, reach an Allied-held port,
deliver his message. It was vital. More
vital, perhaps, than any other phase of
the Great War that had turned the en-
tire world into an armed camp, in 1942.
Scouting over western China, far from
where the Japanese-American Front
lay, he had spied a secret Japanese
army marching southward. If they
once smashed through to the coast
of India, the Dictator Coalition would
have driven its first wedge through
the Allies’ earth-girdling belt of con-
tinuity.

  Barry Carver had decided this infor-
mation must go directly to GHQ, in
London. Radio was out of the ques-
tion, because of the barrage of artificial
static made by both sides in the at-
tempt to hinder the other. So he would
fly, since he had a long-range scout ship
fueled for 3,000 miles. He had had his
choice—north or south route. North
lay the enemy in full force; too risky.
But south, via Arabia and the Sahara,
then north to London—that was the
safest route.

  But of course, as chance would have
it, the few of the enemy’s devil-dogs pa-
trolling northern Africa had seen him,
given chase, shot him down. . . .

\ /ITAL information. Bravely, he set

  *	out on foot across the burning
sands, equipped with one canteen of
water, a pair of binoculars, an auto-
matic and a compass. Young and
strong, he refused to be pessimistic
about his chances. He would soon find
an oasis. Or run into a caravan. He
plodded away from his wrecked plane,
out into the ocean of sand that heaped
endlessly to all horizons.

  Three days later, Barry Carver was
not so sure of himself. He sucked the
last drop of carefully rationed water
from his canteen and flung it away.
Wearily, he raised the binoculars to his
blood-shot eyes. Nothing but sand, sand
in all directions. Bitter curses rasped
from his parched throat. Vital infor-
mation. Was he to die with it searing
his brain?

  That afternoon, under the pitiless
sun, his mind began to wander. He
fought against it, but hopelessly. He
was going to die, out in this sandy hell I
All else slipped from his mind, even the
Great War that was blasting humanity.
He moaned like a wild animal. .His
blistered feet, burning skin, aching
throat were driving him mad, mad!

  Then he saw it—the great, spired city
ahead of him. He broke into a stum--
bling run, shouting hoarsely. Saved!
The people of the city would give him
water. How sweet it would taste! ^

  He stumbled on, but the distance was
greater than it first seemed. To inspire
his failing strength, he peered at it
through the binoculars. How hazy it
looked; it wavered! That must be his
eyes. But there was water, great foun-
tains of it cascading up in lush patches
of greenery. There were even people 011
one of the balconies, staring at him. He
waved, but they stared stonily. Why
didn’t they come out to help him?

  He again took up his tottering lope,
cursing at the loose sand that dragged
at his feet.
PRISON OF TIME

15

  Suddenly, through the fog of his
mind, a terrible thought pierced. A
mirage—it might be that! No, it
couldn’t be—mustn’t be!

_ Yet what was such a great spired city
doing out in these wastes? Doubts
trooped through his agonized mind. It
shimmered, that city. It wavered and
floated over the sand. It wasn’t real.
It was a phenomenon of refraction, an
image cast across miles of desert. A
diabolical vision sent to torture him in
his last hour of life.

  Barry Carver’s mind was paradoxi-
cally shocked to calm and sanity by the
dread realization. His poor burned feet
automatically propelled him toward the
wonderful vision, his whole body strain-
ing forward. But his mind, clear and
rational, told him he was chasing a
chimera.

  Another hour and it would be over.
He would sink, drained of strength, to
the hot sands. His information would
die with him; the Great War go on with-
out him. Perhaps some day a wander-
ing desert tribe would find his bleached
bones. His epitaph would be written
in the drifting sands.

  Stumbling on, refusing to lie down
and wait for death, Barry Carver’s eyes
appraised the city of the mirage with
almost philosophical detachment. How
real it looked, and yet how unreal. Dis-
torted by heat waves, it seemed like no
city ever seen on Earth. Its towers and
spires had a slim grace unknown to or-
dinary architecture. It stretched right
and left and back interminably. Yet
beyond it, through it, he could see
plainly the hateful dunes and ridges of
the vast desert.

  Just a mirage. No, maybe it wasn’t!
Maybe it was real. He would find out
—Lord! Madness stealing over him
again. His right hand brought up his
automatic. Sweaty fingers gripping the
stock, aiming for his temple. Better the
quick death by bullet than the tortures

of nightmarish insanity.

  He flung the gun away, suddenly.

1WIADNESS overwhelnyd his seeth-
ing mind. The great city’s gates
were opening, massive steel halves that
swung silently apart on cleverly-devised
gymbals. He could see now down into
the wide avenues, row on row of build-
ings. The people were beckoning to
him, urging him on! Water! A beau-
tiful, splashing fountain of it. . . .

  With voiceless shrieks from his burn-
ing throat, the half-dead creature whose
name was Barry Carver lurched for-
ward. He fell to his knees and began
crawling forward inch by inch toward
the mirage-city that seemed to dance
tantalizingly just beyond his reach.

  Now here was one side of the giant
portals. He clutched at the pitted stone,
but it was empty air. He pitched on his
face and his groveling fingers found only
sand, sand. . . . And in a last moment
of calm before a black wave blotted out
his mind, Barry Carver welcomed
death.

  It was strange, the awakening.

  He was aware of physical lightness,
and a queer sense of unreality. But then
he opened his eyes and saw substantial
things. He was in a bed, under soft,
silken coverlets. The room around him
was white-walled, curving to a domed
ceiling. There were sylvan pictures of
haunting beauty, long flowing drapes
spectrum colored, carven furniture in-
laid with gold, silver and ivory. Some-
how, the motif of the room was Orien-
tal—or ageless.

  Soft sunlight, not the harsh desert
glare, streamed in a window of crystal
clear glass. Carver’s eyes were arrested
suddenly by what he saw over the foot
of the bed. A woman, a girl at second
glance, seated at a table', writing. Her
bronze-gold hair glinted in the sunlight.

  Carver essayed a call of attention
16

that came out as a feeble croak. The
girl came forward, instantly, smiling.
She wore a rich silken blouse, rainbow
hued, tucked in at the belt of baggy
trousers gathered at the ankles. Orien-
tal costume, Carver reflected, in keep-
ing with the room’s furnishings.

   But she herself wasn’t Oriental. Blue
eyes, rose-white skin, oval cheeks—they
were quite Caucasian features. Strongly
Irish, in fact. The contrast with her
clothing was startling. And her smile
was friendly and open, not inscrutable
and half-apologetic, as with Oriental
women.

  “Cairo?” guessed Carver, concerned
first of all with where he was. “How
was I rescued—caravan?”

  “Cairo?” The girl looked puzzled.
Carver repeated his question in his
indifferent French, hoping this would be
understood.

  The girl laughed. “No, I speak Eng-
lish,” she said. “I was puzzled because
you mentioned Cairo.”

  “Well, where am I then?” pursued
Carver. “Khartoum? Or maybe”—he
frowned—“north coast — Tripoli or
Tunis, in the enemy’s hands. But in
that case, how would you, a white
girl—■’* He stopped, wonderingly.

   The girl’s face had become grave. “I
see you don’t realize you’re in Shor-
raine,” she said slowly. “Well, neither
did I, at first.”

  “Shorraine?” echoed Carver. “Never
heard of it. What part of Africa?”
The girl shook her head. “Not Africa,
nor any other continent. Shorraine is
the—City of the Mirage!”

  Carver gasped. He stared at her si-
lently for a moment. What reason
would she have for lying. Or was she
lying? “Do you mean that city I saw
—the mirage—the big gate—” He fin-
ished explosively: “I don’t believe it!”
“You will see, soon,” returned the
girl calmly.

  “I’ll see now,” grunted Carver. He

tried to struggle up on his elbow, ignor-
ing the girl’s plea to lie quiet.

  “You’re weak. You must rest.”

  But Carver didn’t have to be told as
a sudden wave of weakness turned his
muscles to rubber. He slumped back
and a tide of darkness again buried him.

AY7HEN next he awoke, hunger
•gnawed within Barry Carver. The
girl was again there, and turned at his
call. “I’m hungry,” he told her with-
out preamble. “Incidentally, I’m
Barry Carver, of the United States air-
force.”

  “I’m Helene Ward, also of the Uni-
ted States,” she smiled.

   “But you still insist this is the City
of the Mirage?” he said half mockingly.
“Right out in the middle of the Sa-
hara? A dream citv that floats, ghost-
like!”

  She turned from a cupped wall instru-
ment into which she had whispered a
few words. “I won’t try to explain now.
After you’ve eaten, put on those clothes
over the chair. I’ll meet you outside
and—show you.”

  The door opened and Carver gave a
start that shook his whole bed. The
figure that entered, bearing a silver tray
loaded with steaming dishes, was squat
and hulking shouldered, with thick
bowed stumps of legs. His abbreviated
costume of sleeveless shirt and kirtle re-
vealed an ape-like hairness. The fea-
tures were brutal—thick, flaring nose,
protruding lips, receding brow.

  But docile-like, without a sound, he
set the tray down on a taboret beside
the bed and retreated, with a brief bow
of his thick neck toward the girl.

  “Good Lord!” breathed Carver. “I
don’t know much anthropology, but that
was a Neanderthal Man! What—’’

   “I’ll meet you outside,” said the girl,
slipping out.

  The tempting odors arising from the
tray clipped short Carver’s amazed con-
PRISON OF TIME

17

jectures. He sat up, finding himself
considerably stronger than the other
time, and satisfied his inner cravings.

  The food was exotic, strangely spiced,
but tasty. He recognized no single in-
gredient of it. But that it was nour-
ishing he had no doubt. He could feel
new strength pulsing through his veins.
At last, he reflected, he was no wraith,
if this was the City of the Mirage. But
he hadn't made up his mind about that.
It would require indubitable proof for
belief. Yet, if it were some Oriental
earth city, what was a perfectly natural
white girl doing here? And that Nean-
derthal Man!

  Barry Carver put the dishes aside
hurriedly, eager to get the mystery over
with. As he swung his feet out of the
bed, he noticed they were cleanly healed
of any sign of his terrible trek across
the desert. Either he had been uncon-
scious a lung time, or had had expert
medical care. Probably both. He tast-
ed faintly a drug that might have kept
him asleep.

  The costume fitted his stalwart frame
perfectly. An ornate sleeveless coat
narrowed trimly at the hips. A broad
leather belt held up baggy trousers sim-
ilar to the girl’s. For his feet there were
sandals of some soft hide. He stepped
before a full-length mirror, chuckling
whimsically at the bizarre contrast to
his blond, wavy hair, light grey eyes and
typically occidental face. Yet he had
the swarthy skin of an Oriental, burned
almost mahogany by the three days of
fierce Sahara sun.

  On a small table he found his binoc-
ulars, automatic and compass. He
picked up the gun and tucked it into his
belt, somehow feeling better for it. He
found a pocket for the compass. He
carried the binoculars in his hand.

  He strode to the window, but couldn't
see much because of a high sill. He
turned to the door. It opened magically
at his approach and as he went past he

detected the faint photoelectric eye at
the side. In a short hall stood the girl,
Helene. Smiling, she led him to another
door that gave access to an open bal-
cony hanging like a crow’s nest from the
tower. From this vantage, Carver saw
the full sweep and extent of the incredi-
ble city.

CHEER depth greeted him that took
^ his breath away. He was very high
in some tower, nestled among a forest
of similar spires. Far below lay lower,
flatter buildings and moving figures in
winding avenues. Dotting the expanse
of metal and stone were numerous areas
of green sward, parks whose meander-
ing lanes were bordered with trees and
flowers.

  Barry Carver knew there had never
been such a city on Earth, save in tales
of the Arabian Nights. Was the girl
right? Was this the City of the Mi-
rage?

  “But it’s so solid, so real!” he ob-
jected aloud, as though they had argued.
“The mirage I saw was shimmering,
ghostlike—as unsubstantial as an air-
castle!”

  “Shorraine exists in a different di-
mension,” explained the girl. “In this
dimension, Shorraine is real and Earth
is ghostly. Look!” She grasped his
arm and turned him part way around.
“Squint your eyes and stare straight
out.”

  He did. Back of him, the sun’s bril-
liant shafts speared through the city.
And suddenly he saw a quivering, un-
real scene of endless hills of sand hov-
ering below and all around. It was like
a superimposed view, the desert faintly
occupying the space the city lay in. He
opened his eyes wide and the illusion
vanished. Shorraine reared solidly
around him.

  Carver felt shaken at the weird op-
tical effect. An axiom of physics rose in
his mind. “Two things cannot occupy
18

DYNAMIC Science Stories

the same space at the same time,” he
stated flatly. “How do you explain
that?”

  “I can’t,” Helene admitted simply.
“They tried to explain to me, but I un-
derstood very little of it.”

  “Who’s ‘they’?”

  “The ones who rule this city.” The
girl shook her head at his open mouth,
ready to issue further questions. “You’ll
meet them later. I’ll tell what I can.
The huge front gate to Shorraine en-
closes the ‘spot’ at which Earth and this
world contact. When anything of
Earth reaches the Spot, it passes on
through to this dimension.”

  At his wry smile, she said sharply:
“I’m trying to be as clear as I can. You
approached the Spot, attracted by the
vision of Shorraine. We saw you, dimly,
as you saw us.”

  “Then there were people waving,
beckoning to me!” interposed Carver,
remembering.

  “Yes. We opened the gates for you.
You stumbled at the end, but fell within
the influence of the Spot. You had en-
tered our dimension. We picked you
up, unconscious from your experi-
ences,” she explained.

  The girl looked at him sympathet-
ically. “You must have suffered a great
deal. Your feet were masses of blis-
ters. You were feverish. Your throat
was so constricted we feared you would
choke to death, lying senseless. But
Shorraine has miraculous medicines.
You were quickly treated and brought
to this tower for rest.”

  “How long has it been since I ar-
rived?”

  “Two days. You were kept in a
drugged sleep, to hasten your recov-
ery.”

  “Two days!” echoed Carver. He
looked down at his healed feet again, re-
flecting that the medicines of Shorraine
must indeed be efficacious. And the
vigor that flowed through his body,

when so recently he had been a half-
mad, racked creature more alive than
dead! It had been a toss-up, probably,
whether he would fall within the gates
of Shorraine, or through death’s doors.

TTELENE Ward was watching him.

*	*■ “Do you believe now—about Shor-
raine?”

  “What choice have I?” sighed Car-
ver. “Though it’s all like a fairy tale.
A city in a mirage—another dimension
—a Neanderthal Man—complete cures
in two days! ” He shook his head. Then
he swung on the girl. “And you—
you’re a mystery. Tell me about your-
self.”

  She blushed a little, at his stare.
“There isn’t much to tell. My father
led an archeological expedition west
from Khartoum, and never returned.
That was a year ago.” Her face was
grave now, saddened. “1 set out in
search of him, in an airplane. It cracked
up—bad air currents. The pilot was
killed, in the crash. A miracle saved
me. I was alone, then, and set out
across the desert.”

  She shuddered. “It was terrible!
Finally I saw the mirage—Shorraine.
The gates opened for me, too. I’ve
been here a year.”

  “A year?” Carver looked at her.
“You like it here? You’ve never tried
to leave?”

  Before the girl could answer, there
was an interruption. A young, eager-
faced man strode from the door of the
tower. He nodded to Helene, and
gripped Carver’s hand warmly.

  “Heard you were up and about. I’m
Tom Tyson, of the good old U.S.A. air
squadron. By the look of the togs you
arrived in, I’d say you’re an airman
yourself?”

  Carver’s eyes lighted. He introduced
himself and went on: “What Front were
you on? Jap, European, or South
American?”
PRISON OF TIME

19

  “Hold on!” Tyson stared at him
queerly. “There was only one main
Front in my time—Flander’s Field.”

  “You mean—” Carver choked on
the words.

 “World War,” nodded Tyson.
“Strangest thing, how I got down here.
I was doing scout duty with a fast ship
and plenty of gas. Fog came up at
night; compass went wrong. I saw
water below once or twice and figured
it was the English Channel. Next thing
I knew, at dawn, I was over the damned
desert. I had crossed the Mediter-
ranean ! ”

  “You did a Douglas Corrigan,”
smiled Carver briefly.

  “Exactly,” agreed Tyson. “Anyway,
I ran out of gas over the desert, with
no idea where I was. Forced landing.
Then the mirage, the gates opening,
and here I am in Shorraine. Been here
since 1918.”

  “But you’re just a young man—
about twenty!” blurted out Carver, as
the astounding thought struck him.

  Helene and Tyson glanced at one an-
other. Tyson spoke. “I guess you’ve
heard so many mysteries, one more
won’t hurt. People don’t age in Shor-
raine!” He was about to say more, but
compressed his lips instead.

  Carver stared helplessly. Could this
be some mad dream from which he
would eventually awake?

  “I was nineteen when I came to
Shorraine,” continued Tyson. “I’m still
nineteen, physically. But I know what’s
been going on since then. I know about
your war. What’s the latest develop-
ment?”

  The thought of the war suddenly
swept all other considerations out of
Carver’s confused mind. “The latest
development,” he muttered, “is a move
on the enemy’s part—a secret Jap
army trying to cut through to the In-
dian Ocean. And I think I’m the only
one knows about it. If they succeed,

they’ll sever our overland connection
between the European and Japanese
Fronts.”

LIE drew himself up. “I haven’t time
A A to waste. All these mysteries by
the board, I have to leave Shorraine.
Get back to—civilization. Warn head-
quarters of the Jap move. Do you sup-
pose I can get some help here, to cross
the desert?”

  Carver saw again a look exchanged
between the two and wondered what it
was this time. His heart sank in anti-
cipation, even before Helene spoke.

  “You can’t leave Shorraine,” she
said softly.

  “Why not?” snapped Carver impa-
tiently. “Nobody can stop me. If I
came in the Spot, I can go out again.”
The girl looked at him as though
warning him to prepare for the greatest
shock of all.

  “Remember when you were stagger-
ing into the city gates?” she said. “You
must have wondered why we didn’t
come out to help you. You saw us
watching. We couldn’t come out. The
Spot only works one way!”

  Tom Tyson nodded soberly. “You
can come in from the Earth side easily
enough, but going back is impossible.
It doesn’t work. Or else I'd have left
here long ago.”

  “Good Lord!” groaned Carver. “You
mean there’s no way back? And I have
priceless information for headquarters!
It should be delivered soon. In another
month, that Jap army—”

  “There’s no way back!” murmured
Tyson.

  Carver grasped at straws. “Is there
any way of communicating with the
outside world. Radio, for instance.1”
Tyson shook his head. “Radio also
works just one way—into Shorraine.
We know much of what goes on in the
world by radio. But no radio waves
can go the other way, to Earth.”
20

DYNAMIC Science Stories

  Carver bit his lip. What a mad, im-
possible situation! Trapped in a mys-
terious “dimension” from which there
was no return. A dismayed feeling
clutched his heart, and not only at the
thought of his untransmitted informa-
tion. He must continue to live here in
Shorraine, in a strange, almost alien en-
vironment. In a city of witchcraft, to
judge by what he had heard and seen so
far.

  Barry Carver whirled suddenly.
‘•Listen, there must be a way back to
Earth,” he protested. “Have you ever
tried the Spot?”

  “Well, no,” admitted Tyson. “But
they’ve told us—”

  “They’ve told you!” Carver mocked.
“Why not try it?” He had never taken
anybody’s word for anything, when the
issue at slake was vital.

  “.\il right,” agreed Tyson. “We’ll
try it right now.”

  He led the way off the balcony into
the short hallway, at the end of which
was an elevator that took them down
at a sickening pace. They traversed
another hallway, passing other people.
Carver stared at them curiously. Were
all of thc-m unaging, as Tyson was?
How long coidd they be kept so? But
he would find out such things later. At
present, his only thought was departure
from Shorraine.

  They stepped out into the sunlight,
on a broad flat roof. Tyson spoke low
words with an attendant and then
jumped aboard a flat-decked craft built
like a half egg-shell. Carver followed
and helped Helene aboard.

  Tyson stood before a pedestal whose
top surface held dials and levers. As he
manipulated them, a soft hum arose
from below deck and the craft glided
into the air smoothly. Carver hung on
the rail around the deck, thunderstruck
by the fact that there was no propellor
whirring. He flushed as he caught Ty-
son’s half-amused glance.

  “Little different from the kind of
things we piloted, eh?” grinned Tyson.
“Works on an anti-gravity principle.
Apparatus below produces a field of
force that neutralizes gravity. Power
comes from a central broadcast sta-
tion.”

/^ARVER swallowed his amazement
with difficulty. It was becoming
apparent to him that Shorraine was a
city of more than common science.
Neutralizing gravity was no small feat
and so far ahead of Earth science that
they laughed at it as an optimist’s
dream. Broadcasting power through
the ether, though long sought, still
evaded engineering efforts on Earth.
Both of these had been achieved here
and combined in a craft that soared
magically.

  Sailing high above the spires, Carver
had a panoramic view of the city’s ex-
panse. A circular stone wall, a hundred
feet high, completely surrounded it.
Beyond was wild-looking land, appar-
ently uncultivated.

  “Where is food grown?” queried
Carver, mystified.

  “It isn’t grown,” informed Helene.
“It’s nwde—here in the city, by scien-
tific processes.” She smiled. “But
don’t ask me how. The wall around
Shorraine is to keep out—beasts.”

  Tyson slanted the ship down toward
the ponderous gates and landed it on
the wall next to a small housing. The
gatekeeper, a hawk-nosed fellow, stared
at them quizzically.

  “Open the gates,” commanded Ty-
son.

  “But why?” asked the gate-keeper,
turning to peer with squinted eyes be-
yond the city. “There is no one ap-
proaching from the Earth-dimension.”

  “No, but we wish to try going
through the Spot, back toward Earth,
just for our own satisfaction,” spoke up
Carver. “There’s no harm trying, is
PRISON OF TIME

21

there?”

  The gate-keeper grinned at him in
recognition. “You’re the man who ar-
rived recently? There is no return to
Earth. Others have tried it—countless
others.”

  “I want to try for myself,” insisted
Carver stubbornly.

  The gate-keeper scowled. “All right,”
he said grumblingly, after a moment.
“Go down below. But do not go too far
outside the gate. I saw one of the big
beasts roaming around before.”

 Tyson led the way down winding
stairs to the base of the wall. Carver
was in a fever of impatience to attempt
the return, despite the repeated pessi-
mism against its success. Finally the
massive halves of the metal gate swung
outward, without a whisper of sound.

  The three waiting stepped forward,
out toward the dark wild wastes.
Squinting his eyes, with the sun in back
of him, Barry Carver could see the
“mirage” of Earth before him, the vast
ocean of the Sahara. It hung over the
other scene like a dancing image. Was
there no return to it?

  They trudged forward. Out of curi-
osity, Carver took out his compass and
glanced at it. The needle, pointing away
from the city as north, suddenly spun
wildly as he walked along. A few feet
further on it was pointing into the city,
in a queer reversal that was like an ill
omen.

  Altogether, they walked forward a
hundred yards, but the Earth-mirage
did not become real.

 “You see?” said Tom Tyson, but
with disappointment himself.

  “I had been hoping—a little,” mur-
mured Helene.

  Carver looked back baffled. He could
see the outline of the Spot, like a round
bluish tunnel in the air, filling the space
between the gate posts. They had
walked right through it. It offered no
return to Earth. He was convinced of

it now. He shrugged and turned to go
back.

  “Oh!”

IT was a gasp from Helene. Her fin-

*	gers dug into his arm. He looked in
the direction she indicated and gasped
himself. Out of the dark land was
charging a monster of scales and spines,
rearing twenty feet from the ground.
Rooted in surprise, Carver recognized
it. A Tyrannosaurus, from the Rep-
tilian Age of the dim past! It thun-
dered down on them, a juggernaut of
bone and muscle.

  “Run!” shouted Tyson. They fled
for the gateway, but Carver felt futile
despair. They would never make it be-
fore the monstrous killer caught up
with them. He jerked out his automatic
and emptied it at the creature, though
he realized it would have as little effect
as tossing pebbles.

  Fifty yards to go! Carver pushed the
girl before him and glanced over his
shoulder. Giant jaws, edged with rows
of horrible teeth, were almost within
striking distance. Death at his very-
back!

  And then—from the top of the wall
stabbed a crimson beam, hissing
through the air. It caught the beast
squarely and burned smokingly through
armored scales. Screaming shrilly, it
spun about and raced back the way it
had come, with a thunder of its pon-
derous feet.

  Safe within the gates, trembling and
panting, the three watched the great
portals swing together.

  “A dinosaur!” growled Carver.
“What else have you got in this crazy
world?” He was more angry than as-
tonished, for his sense of surprise had
become dulled with repeated reve-
lations.

  When they had climbed to the top of
the wall, the gatekeeper was shoving a
wheeled weapon back to its niche in the
22

guardhouse. Carver could see an intri-
cate group of tubes, coils and wiring be-
hind a mesh-screen, connecting to a
shiny convex mirror. It was powered,
probably, from the ether broadcast
lines and shot out raw heat energy as a
beam. Again an example of advanced
science.

  “Thanks, Proxides,” said Tyson
warmly. “We owe our lives to your
sharp eyes and quick action.”

  T h e gate-keeper grunted. “These
eyes that are trained to watch for the
demon-people’s slinking shapes cannot
fail to see a mountain of flesh before the
nose. And in the old days”—his eyes
flashed slightly — “one had to learn
quickness in the hand-to-hand battles
with the Persians. Ah, in those times
_»

  The buzzing of a wall instrument in-
tervened.

  Carver turned to see a square panel
glow with prismatic colors that sudden-
ly flew together to form a face. Tele-
vision—and far clearer than the images
cast by the latest 1942 models on earth!

  A bearded, sharp-nosed visage peered
out of the visi-screen.

  “Proxides,” he barked, “for whom or
what reason did you open the gates?”

  “For the new man, sire, who did not
believe there was no return to Earth.”

  “I see.” The eyes shifted to meet
those of Carver and he felt as though
he were looking inlo pools of endless
depths. “I will explain to him some-
time. when I am not so busy.” The im-
age faded.

  “Who’s he?” asked Carver.

  “Chief scientist of Shorraine,” said
Tyson. “If you want a scientific ex-
planation for everything, Val Marmax
is the man to give it.”

  “Then let’s see him right away!” de-
manded Carver.

  “Can’t, while he’s busy. But I’ll ar-
range for you to see him as soon as
possible.”

ND right now,” spoke up Helene
Ward, “you’re going back to
your room, and bed. You’re still a con-
valescent. Too much excitement at one
time.”

  “I feel fine,” Carver protested.

  “Doctor’s orders,” said the girl firm-
ly. “You’re not as well as you think,
yet.”

  “You’re taking pretty good care of
me,” smiled Carver.

  The girl’s face tinted and she low-
ered her eyes without answering. By
the time they had flown back to his
room, Carver realized she was right. A
strange weakness had stolen over him.
an after-effect of the drugs, he sur-
mised. In bed, he fell instantly asleep,
too tired to conjecture over the amazing
riddle of Shorraine.

  For the next three days, while his full
strength rapidly returned, Barry Car-
ver lived a strange dream. Helen and
Tyson,who spent most of his waking
hours with him, had obviously entered
a conspiracy to explain little or nothing.
Tyson assured him that soon he would
be told all things, by one more qualified
to make it clear, Val Marmax, the sci-
entist.

  In fact, in the many hours they spent
on the balcony conversing, Helene and
Tyson asked the most questions. They
were pitifully eager, almost, to hear of
events in their former life. They drank
in his words, the picture of rapt atten-
tion.

  “We hear much of what goes on in
the world, by radio,” informed Tyson.
“But it’s dry, second-hand. And we
can’t ask the announcer questions.
Since the war’s been on, we’ve heard
less, because, I suppose, of stiff censor-
ship. We hardly know what is going
on right now.”

  Carver’s eyes went bleak.

  “It’s the greatest conflict in human
history,” he murmured. “With science

gan with the assassination of Hitler,
over a year ago. It was a mistake. He
became a martyr, in the eyes of his
world-wide followers. Two months later
they rose in attack, inflamed by the
other leaders. Every nation became in-

  He jumped up and began pacing,
hands clenched. “I keep thinking of
that Jap army. It must be stopped I
Why did I have to fall, or crawl, into
this damned trap?”

 “You wouldn’t be alive if you
hadn't.” reminded Helene gently.

  “Well, you’re right,” admitted Car-
ver. His shoulders sagged helplessly.
“I’ll have to make the best of it.”

  He saw an exchange of looks between
the other two, as though they too at one
time had come to such a conclusion.

  Tyson took them flying at times, over
the city. He taught Carver the tech-
nique of handling the controls, and it
was with some pleasure that Carver
maneuvered the ship at breathtaking
spurts and spins. It was far superior
in manipulation to clumsy propellored
ships. He thought vaguely of such
craft in the war on Earth, and what a
tremendous advantage they would be in
any aerial battles.

  The second day, high over the city,
Carver noticed a break in the horizons^
beyond, which elsewhere was an un-
broken expanse of dark wilderness.
Faintly, he seemed to see the spires and
serrate outlines of another city.

  “Is it a city?” he asked.

  Tyson nodded, his lips tightening a
little.

  “Well?”

  “It’s a city of—other people,”
vouched Tyson reluctantly.

/^ARVER stared at their averted
   eyes.

  “You two are keeping a lot from
me,” he accused.

  Helene touched his arm. “You’ve
only been here a few days, Barry,” she
said softly. “You can’t learn of every-
thing at once. Val Marmax will ex-
plain better than we can.”

  Carver let it rest at that, though his
impatience and wonder grew hourly.
His two guides took him through the
various industries of Shorraine. Robot
machinery, almost unattended, made
the necessities of life, including food.
All raw material came from simple rock
molecules, by processes of transmuta-
tion. Power to run all machines, as
with the aircraft, came wirelessly from
a central power-station. This gigantic
plant was crammed to the roof with
busily humming cyclotrons. Carver
vaguely understood it as the generation
of atomic energy.

  And here was all this science in full-
bloom, cooped up in some isolated “di-
mension!” It was the science of
Earth’s future. But how wonderful to
have it now, if only Earth could have it.

  The people of the city interested
Barry Carver the most, however.
Though dressed uniformly in the color-
ful costumes of their style, they were of
all races, including a sprinkling of Chi-
nese and Negroes. The predominant
white, in turn, was of all different types,
from almost black Asiatic Indians to
pink-white Nordics. The main bulk,
however, seemed to be an olive-skinned,
sharp-nosed people.

  Ethnologically, the citizens of Shor-
raine were a mixed group. And Carver
sensed too that they were divergent in a
subtler way that he couldn’t define.
Snatches of conversation that he over-
heard mystified him. There were re-
ferences to the past that puzzled him.
But most amazing of all, when he
stopped to think of it, was the wide-
spread use of dozens of different lan-
guages. And particularly when he no-
24

ticed a swarthy Indian talking German,
a Chinese using French, a blonde Nor-
dic rolling off the difficulties of Greek!

  It was always with a queer shock that
Carver came upon the silent, unobtru-
sive Neanderthal Men. They served
a s well-treated menials, apparently.
Their little, dull eyes reflected the mud-
dled mind of a creature half-way be-
tween man and ape. Earth anthropolo-
gists would mortgage their souls for one
of them.

  On the third morning of his awaken-
ing, Helene informed him, in a rather
subdued voice, that he was to be re-
ceived by the “Queen.”

  “Your ruler?” asked Carver.

  “No. She was a Queen, in her for-
mer life, and out of courtesy the title
remains. She makes it a practice to
welcome all newcomers to Shorraine.”
Helene turned away with a strange
hunch of her shoulders. She turned
back suddenly. “If you wished, you
could pass it by.”

  “No, I’ll see the Queen,” said Car-
ver. interested. He quoted: “A royal
invitation is a command.”

  Tyson joined them and together they
soared to a tower of elaborate design,
frescoed and studded with blocks of
sparkling stone. At the landing terrace,
a bowing hawk-nosed attendant ush-
ered them into a room hung with gor-
geous tapestries. Statuettes gleamed in
wall niches. Perfume lingered in the
air. On a couch of silks reclined a
woman in a clinging robe of white.

  “Her Majesty, Queen Elsha!” an-
nounced the attendant solemnly, with-
drawing.

/^ARVER stared almost rudely. He
v^-' had never seen a woman quite like
her before. Raven-black hair ran
smoothly over the ears to outline an ol-
ive-tinted face of dark, heavy-lidded
eyes, thin aristocratic nose and lips
crimsoned artificially. One hand, with

gold-tinted nails, toyed with the ears of
a woolly dog curled beside her. The
langorous lines of her figure were a
study of artistic perfection.

  She was staring at him, a faint smile
on her lips.

  “You are Barry Carver, most recent
pilgrim to Shorraine,” Her voice was
low, husky, melodious. “You will tell
me about the outside world that I have
not seen for—a while?”

  “Anything you want to know. Queen
Elsha,” assured Carver, flushing a little
at her direct gaze. He felt himself be-
ing appraised, weighed, almost ana-
lyzed. and seemed to see a gleam of ap-
proval in those slumbrous eyes.

  She glanced at the others. “May I
not be alone with my guest?”

  Carver saw Helene dart a veiled
glance at the woman, and then turn
away with that same little hunch of her
shoulders. Tysoa managed to whisper
a word in Carver’s ear before he left,
with a cynical grin: “Dynamite!”
Alone wifh the creature who seemed
the essence of Oriental womanhood,
Carver felt at a loss. He could feel his
ears burn.

  “Sit down beside me, Barry Carver,”
she invited. Her English was fluent,
natural. “Tell me about yourself.”

  He did, briefly. Then he asked:
“What were you queen of, before you
came to Shorraine?” He reflected it
must be some comic-opera principality,
perhaps in Asia Minor.

  Her eyes lighted. “Of a great land.
But that is no more.” A fiercer expres-
sion shone from her dark eyes, then.
“I should still be a rightful queen. But
they have taken my power away, in
Shorraine.” She peered up at him.
“Will you help me regain what I have
lost, Barry Carver? You are a leader.
1 know that at first glance. You could
do much—for me.”

  Carver stammered a negative, star-
tled at the sudden appeal.
PRISON OF TIME

25

  “No?”

  Her arms were suddenly around his
neck, drawing his lips to hers. The
exotic perfume of her hair hypnotized
his senses. But a word flashed through
his mind: “Dynamite!”

  “I have to go,” he said firmly, pull-
ing himself away. He left without a
backward glance, and soared away in
his ship.

  Helene was waiting, at his tower.
“Well?” she said, with a trace of cold-
ness.

  “Well, what?” he countered.

  “You were there a half hour,” said
the girl pointedly. “When the Queen
welcomed me, it only took five min-
utes.” She turned with that queer
hunch of her shoulder.

  Carver laughed, and drew her to him.
“I love you, Helene,” he said simply.
“From the first moment.”

  She resisted him. “You’ve only
known me three days. How can you
know—”

  “Three days, three minutes, three
years- -what’s the difference? Hel-
ene—”

  Carver was determined, sure of him-
self. He hadn’t been sure of it before.
The episode with Queen Elsha had
served to crystallize his own attitude to
the sweet, attractive girl who had been
nurse and companion for three days.

CHE held herself stiffly as he slipped
^ his arms around her, but suddenly
relaxed in surrender, sought his lips
eagerly.

  “Oh, Barry, take me away from this
place—back to Earth! ” she half sobbed,
after a moment.

  “I’ll certainly try,” he promised.

  “Tomorrow.” she whispered. “To-
morrow Val Marmax will see you.
You'll hear the full story.” She shud-
dered. “Then you’ll know!”

  In the morning. Tyson was on hand.
“Val Marmax is waiting for us, Barry.

He says he will explain many things.”
“Good,” nodded Carver. “So far
I’ve seen things that need plenty of tall
explaining.” He set his lips grimly. “If
I’m to be stuck in Shorraine, I want to
know the why of everything. Coming
along, Helene?”

  She slipped her hand in his. “I think
I want to hear what Val Marmax has to
say, too. I’ve been here a year, Earth-
time, and it’s all a mystery to me.’
“Why do you say ‘Earth-time’?”
asked Carver, having heard the expres-
sion several times. “Is there a different
time-system in Shorraine?”

  “Let Val Marmax explain,” said Ty-
son, shortly.

  Their flat-decked ship arose, smooth-
ly, and darted in the direction of the
city’s gates. A short distance before
them lay a long, low building in the
shadows of sky-piercing towers. Land-
ing on the roof, the way led down wind-
ing stairs. Finally, before a door of
burnished metal, Tyson pressed a but-
ton. Soft lights flashed in their eyes—
Carver guessed it to be a vision scanner
—and then the door opened.

  Not unfamiliar with laboratories,
Carver recognized the room beyond im-
mediately as such. But little of the
paraphernalia strewn about on benches
and shelves was that of Earth-science.
The aspect of the place was foreign,
strange and somehow, age-old. Car-
ver’s heart beat faster, for some inde-
finable reason.

  Val Marmax was seated at a desk be-
fore an instrument whose rotating me-
tal scroll made some kind of record.
But the scientist was neither speaking
nor writing. He was just staring at a
small humming globe over the machine.
In a flash of insight, Carver knew he
was recording his thoughts directly on
the scroll.

  The three stood silently, waiting.
Finally the scientist’s thin, sensitive
hand flipped a switch at the side and the
26

DYNAMIC Science Sioiries

machine’s hum ceased. He looked up.
Carver met his eyes. Far more than
the vision screen had showed, that other
time, they were orbs of dynamic inten-
sity. They seemed filled with the wis-
dom of ages, shining forth like a steady
beacon. Yet behind this, Carver sensed
a deep weariness. For the rest, he was
an average man, about forty, somewhat
portly, with a lofty brow, pointed beard
and full lips.

  At a querulous glance from the scien-
tist, Tyson gave Carver’s name.

  “The things of Shorraine mystify
you, Barry Carver?” spoke the scien-
tist in a deep, grave voice. “I will an-
swer your questions. I am Val Mar-
max, chief scientist of Shorraine.”

  “From where are you?’’ queried Car-
ver first of all, unable to place the man’s
precise accent.

  “From Atlantis.”

  “Atlantis?” Carver looked blank.
Then he gasped “Atlantis'.” again,
sharply . It took him a few seconds to
regain his lost voice. “But you can’t
mean the mythical island of prehistory
—” He stopped, looking at his two com-
panions, but they showed no surprise.

  Val Marmax nodded with a faint
smile. “That same ill-fated land of
twelve thousand years ago, Earth-
time!”

/'"''ARVER tried to rationalize. He
could accept offhand the one-time
existence of Atlantis, though in Earth
history it had always been a fable. But
must he accept Val Marmax’s state-
ment at face-value? An impulsive
laugh that he couldn’t control shook
him.

  “You’re not twelve thousand years
old,” he objected. “You mean you’re a
descendant of that race.”

  “No, I am an original Atlantide,” as-
 serted the scientist. “Proxides, at the
 gate, is a Greek from the time of Alex-
 ander, 330 B.C. There are people in

Shorraine from all times and periods,
from the days of Atlantis to the pres-
ent.”

  “Remember, Barry,” came Tyson’s
voice, “I told you people do not age in
Shorraine!”

  Tyson, of course, was an example
himself, Carver reflected, though he
hadn’t followed through the reasoning
before. He had simply taken it for
granted that some miraculous scientific
process, like a Fountain of Youth, kept
him young and would do so for a lim-
ited time. But this survival of Val
Marmax, through centuries, was a dif-
ferent matter. It was immortality!

  Carver forced himself to be calm. “Is
there no such thing as death here?’’ he
asked quietly.

  “Only by violence, and occasionally
by disease. Never by what is known
on Earth as old-age.” The scientist
went on. “Our science has conquered
most disease, which is really a death by
violence, through the attack of germs.
Actual violent death, however, we can-
not control. If that Tyrannosaurus
outside the gates had caught you. one
snap of his jaws would have ended
your life as certainly as on Earth.”
“But old-age!” remonstrated Carver.
“How do you escape that?”

  “We are in a different time-world
than that of Earth,” responded the At-
lantide. “It is hard to explain, in terms
of your orthodox modern science. In a
sense, time does not pass here in Shor-
raine’s world. Or, rather, call it bio-
logical time. Old-age is a wearing
down of the body-machine, measured
by biological time. And biological time
stands still here. There is no simpler
explanation.”

  Carver’s eyes rested on Helene.
“What of your children? Good Lord,
if death is so rave, how have you kept
the population from choking itself by
sheer pressure of numbers?”

  Helene looked back at him queerly,
PRISON OF TIME

27

sadly, Carver noticed and he suspected
the answer. The stunning thought oc-
curred to him that he hadn’t seen a
single child, in three days!

  “There are no children in Shorraine!”
Val Marmax was looking at the floor
now. “There can be none. Birth and
growth arc processes dependent on bio-
logical time, again. We have no senile
old dotards, ready for the grave. But
neither have we children to grow up at
our sides. That has been the price of
immortality in Shorraine!”

  Carver broke a strained, depressed
silence. He sensed that Val Marmax,
and perhaps all the others of Shorraine,
would willingly exchange this immor-
tality for normal life.

  ‘•'The pathway back to Earth is
closed, as I know,” he said. “But have
you tried, with your science, to open the
way?”

  Infinite weariness suddenly came
over the Atlantide’s face.

  “I have tried, and many others, for
these thousands of years. It seemed
impossible. The Spot can be simply ne-
gotiated, from Earth to Shorraine. But
the return is barred as though Earth
were in the remotest galaxy. And
therein lies the whole story of Shor-
raine.”

I_IE settled himself back. His eyes

A * faded as though he were plumbing
the depths of time with his vision.

  “The world of Shorr—which in our
tongue means ‘mirage’—lies in a differ-
ent universe than that of Earth. There
are different stars and different dimen-
sions. The two do not conflict, though
they lie wrapped in one another. They
are in different time-sectors. And as
your Einstein has shown, partly, two
things can exist in the same space, at
separate times.”

  H e waved a hand of dismissal.
“Having studied the problem for so
long, I could show you the formulae.

But they are too involved for ordinary
discussion.”

  Carver nodded. “Skip it,’’ he said.
He realised that the riddle of Shor-
raine was something Earth science s
rigid dogmatism hadn’t made allowance
for.

  The Atlantide resumed.

  “Shorr, however, does have contact
with Earth, at the Spot. To give an an-
alogy. it is something like a two-dimen-
sional flat world touching a three-di-
mensional globe. They would contact
at one point. Thus, since time began,
there has been this path from Earth to
this world—one-way.

  “As a result, creatures of Earth
blundered through the Spot, into this
dimension. All other conditions, save
time, being strangely alike, they lived.
In the dim past, millions of years ago,
the great reptiles came through, during
their era of predominance. The Sa-
hara, in those remote times, was not a
desert, but a rich, prolific hotbed of life,
and by the laws of numbers alone,
though the Spot is so small, many dino-
saurs entered. In my idler moments I
have soared over the dark lands and
catalogued Triceratops, Brontosaurus,
Stegosaurus, Trachodon, etc. They,
too, were unable to die of age, but their
numbers have been depleted by their
mutual depredations. The Tyranno-
saurus you saw is the only one I’ve
known of in fifty years. He may well
be the last of his species in Shorr.”

  Carver heaved a sigh. The pieces of
the puzzle were falling into place. And
in a less crazy pattern than had at first
seemed possible.

  “Eventually,” continued Val Mar-
max, “man came on the scene. Per-
haps, through a period of fifty thousand
years, all the sub-species of near-man
wandered in. Before the dawn of true
man, the Neanderthalers particularly
entered the Spot. Terrified, bewildered
by the new world, they did not venture
28

DYNAMIC Science Stories

far from the Spot, and established a
cave community exactly on the site of
later Shorraine. They managed to eke
out a living by hunting.

  “We found them here when we came
—we of Atlantis.”

  The scientist’s voice became tense,
vibrant.

  “Fifteen thousand years ago Atlantis
and Mu achieved a cultured, scientific
civilization that lasted for three thou-
sand years. Then came catastrophe, as
your fables relate. The seas rose, the
lands split, and the fires of the under-
neath erupted. Atlantis and Mu were
doomed—”

  Something of the terror and agony
of that long ago disaster shone from the
speaker’s eyes. Carver felt sympathy.

  “Some of the scientists of Atlantis
knew of the Spot, knew that it led to a
livable world, as they could faintly see
in ‘mirages.’ While there was yet time,
we gathered as many of our people as
we could, led them into Shorr. Better
a chance for survival in an unknown
world than certain death on torn,
twisted Earth. Some few of Mu, from
half way around the world, were also
saved. Queen Elsha — was queen of
that great land in the Pacific.”

/'■'’ARVER started a little, thinking of
his visit with Queen Elsha and her
strange conversation.

  Val Marmax sighed.

  “Thus we began life anew. With our
science, we founded the city of Shor-
raine—Mirage City—on the site of the
Neanderthal cave-home. The few sur-
viving Neanderthalers we trained as our
servants. Life was not unpleasant in
Shorr, but we soon longed to return.
Particularly when we knew at the im-
mortality that denied us children.
Then we found—that we could not re-
turn!”

  The furrows in the scientist’s brow
■—sharpened by twelve thousand years

of life and thought—grew deep.

  “Though we prided ourselves as be-
ing the masters of nature and all its
mysteries, we could not solve the prob-
lem of the Spot. Life went on. In the
past twelve thousand years, others have
wandered into the Spot, from later
times than ours. When the Egyptian
empire flowered, thousands of them
came to Shorraine. Later, men from
all lands—Sumerians, Persians, Greeks,
Romans, Crusaders, Arabs, and the
European adventurers. Not in great
numbers, of course. Only by chance,
sometimes only one a year. Since the
days of Egypt, when the Sahara became
a death-trap, only doomed men whose
half-maddened minds saw the mirage of
Shorraine as possible rescue, have stum-
bled in, as with yourself.”

  “Are all the mirages of the Sahara,”
asked Carver curiously, “caused by
Shorraine?”

  Val Marmax nodded. “All mirages,
so-called, are reflections of our city,
from different angles. Or views of the
rest of Shorr. Earth eyes have dressed
them with many fanciful details, but
they would have noticed, by compari-
son, that it was one and the same gen-
eral scene each time.”

  “And that,” mused Carver, “explains
one of the oldest of historical phenom-
ena.”

  He looked at the Atlantide’s studied
face. It was hard to believe that this
man had lived three hundred lifetimes.
That the city was filled with other peo-
ple whose lives had gone past the Bibli-
cal three-score and ten.

  Carver was suddenly appalled. “How
have you filled the time?” he whispered.
“All those centuries and centuries—”

  “We have managed to occupy our-
selves,” smiled Val Marmax. His smile
was mirthless. “The repairs and run-
ning of our machinery, beautifying our
city, and the pursuit of hobbies Earth
history has particularly absorbed us,
PRISON OF TIME

29

collectively. Each new visitant to Shor-
raine, when he had become settled in
the new life, was set to work writing
down all he knew of his times. We have
written records that would be priceless
to Earth—detailed accounts of early
history lost to your times. Another pop-
ular avocation has been to learn differ-
ent languages. Almost every person in
Shorraine can speak fluently in dozens
of languages. It takes time—but Ishtu
knows, we have enough of that.”

  Carver saw now, though he had taken
it for granted before, why everyone in
Shorraine seemed to know English thor-
oughly. They had studied it over the
the radio, as they had studied all other
modern languages. They had probably
spoken it longer than Carver himself!
Like that Greek. Proxides, who had
been born a thousand years before the
rudiments of the modern English lan-
guage had been set down! Everything
in Shorraine was topsy-turvy. It was
all queer, queer!

  “I suppose it’s been interesting in a
way,” remarked Carver. “Living on
and on. learning many more things than
normal humans ever have a chance to.
But which would you rather have—this
life or life on Earth?”

*'6 'HE visage of Val Marmax suddenly
unmasked itself as an incredibly old,
senile, wearied face behind its ageless
lines.

  “Earth!” he said instantly, his eyes
glowing. “We would welcome release
from this deathless prison. I have lived
twelve thousand years in Shorraine. I
would exchange it for 12 years of Earth
life. Life is a meaningless Purgatory
here. Immortality is ashes. Twelve
years back on Earth would be fuller,
richer, grander—” He stopped, help-
less to express himself. “You will find
out, Barry Carver, when you have
watched the slow years parade by end-
lessly, endlessly—”

  “I don’t intend to find out,” said Car-
ver rebelliously. “There must be a way
out of the Spot.’’

  Val Marmax’s sigh came from his
soul.

  “I have chanted those same words for
twelve thousand years,” he said. He
became suddenly fierce, scornful. “For
twelve thousand years I’ve tried—and
my science has failed. And you say
childishly it can be achieved, as though
it were a tent-flap one could toss aside!”
Carver took the rebuke in silence.
Beside him, Tom Tyson stirred. “If
there only were a way!” he murmured.
“I’ve only been here twenty-four years.
But I’d take a day on Earth for another
twenty-four. Even an hour, in a dog-
fight against enemy planes, knowing I
couldn’t escape them!”

  The war! Carver had almost forgot-
ten about it. He jumped up and began
pacing. “It’s all so ironic!” he com-
plained in a mutter. “You people would
gladly go back to Earth, and Earth
could use your great science. Your
atomic-energy process, wireless power
transmission, chemical food, robot ma-
chinery. And your marvellous anti-
gravity ships and beam-weapon, in the
war! If we had your help, we would
win!"

 Val Marmax nodded. “I have
thought of that myself. I have fol-
lowed your war, by radio reports. What
puny guns and methods you have! I
could rout an army with ten of my
ships!”

  Carver whirled.

  “Suppose the Spot were open!” he
demanded. “And you could go out.
You would have to choose a side. Which
side?” He almost held his breath, wait-
ing for an answer.

  “That would be up to the Council,”
returned the Atlantide non-commitally.
“Five of my fellow Atlantides rule Shor-
raine, but they would call a Council for
a decision. The Council would consist
30

DYNAMIC Science Stories

of one member from each kind of race,
time and nation. The Five have ruled
wisely that way, through the voice of
the people.”

  “Democracy!” cried Carver happily.
“You have it here yourself. They would
vote to help the Allied Democracies!”
“Perhaps so.” Val Marmax’s eyes
were dull. “But foolish talk. It will
never come to pass. Are you still think-
ing of conquering the Spot, Barry Car-
ver, when 1 have failed in twelve thou-
sand years?”

  Carver felt the crushing force of that
statement. His eager thought of Shor-
raine’s help in the war evaporated, leav-
ing bitterness. He felt Helene’s eyes on
him and looked at her. She had hope!
She seemed to be telling him she be-
lieved in him, believed he could do some-
thing, against all reason.

  Carver’s pulses stirred. He faced the
Atlantide.

  “Just what is the Spot?” he asked.
“Why is it so impregnable?”

\ 7AL MARMAX spoke dejectedly.

  *	“It’s a time-warp, in brief. Passing
through from the Earth side, all elec-
trons within the countless atoms reverse
their spin, which throws them into the
new time dimension. But to force the
electrons back to their original motion,
seems impossible. It involves attaining
a high potential. I have tried the ti-
tanic powers of atomic-energy, without
avail. It is an irreversible equation, ap-
parently, of time—”

  “Magnetism!” interjected Carver,
thoughtfully.

  “What?” asked the Atlantide.

  “It must be a magnetic phenom-
ena,” Carver related his experiment
with the compass, when passing through
the Spot.

  “Magnetism-—compass? What are
those?” Val Marmax looked puzzled.

  Carver stared, his thoughts whirling.
Could it be possible that this master

scientist knew nothing of magetism?

  “How do you generate electricity?”
he demanded.

  “By conversion of disrupted atoms
into pure energy.”

  “You don’t use a generator—an ar-
mature, copper wire, magnetic field?”
The Atlantide shook his head, still
puzzled.

  “Good God!” exploded Carver. A
blinding light seared his mind. “Too
much science, that’s your trouble!” he
hissed. “You’ve been playing around
with your anti-gravity, atomic-energy
and what-not, without realizing there
are such simple things as magnetic
fields, rotating coils, and plain ordinary
two-plus-two! I’ll bet the key to the
Spot is so simple, you’ll cry like a baby
when you find it!”

  Val Marmax rose in red-faced anger,
glaring at the younger man. For a mo-
ment he stood thus, haughty, proud,
wrathful, in a pose that might have
been a picture of a long-distant past,
when he and his fellows w-ere lords of
civilization. But suddenly he relaxed.

  “This magnetism,” he asked. “What
is it?”

  Barry Carver launched into an ex-
planation. and halting though it was,
he knew he had put the idea across.
An utterly dumbfounded look had
frozen on the Atlantide’s face.

  “Ishtu!” he gasped. “That’s it! The
vital clue. At my fingertips all the time.
If the polarity is reversed, the electrons
must spin the other way—”

  Radiant with hope, the four looked
at one another.

  Then suddenly, Carver felt a queer
sensation. Something dark and shad-
owy seemed to be in the room. It hov-
ered over him and darted down sud-
denly. He felt strangely light-headed,
and something was prodding in his
mind, like a mental gimlet. It burned,
agonizingly, as though his brain were
on fire.
PRISON OF TIME

31

  Instinctively, he brushed at the shad-
owy thing around his head, trying to
knock it away. His hand felt nothing
save a tingling—and the burning, tor-
turing, probing feeling continued.

  The other three had been staring at
him, frightened.

  “Don’t think!” barked Val Marmax.
“Make your mind a blank. Carver,
you’re in danger—think of nothing,
nothing—”

  While he spoke, he ran toward the
wall where a row of gleaming switches
lay. Carver, bewildered and half-pan-
icky, tried to obey, tried to make his
mind a blank. He pictured sheep
jumping over a fence. One sheep—two
sheep—three sheep— He noticed the
burning in his brain lessening.

  And then suddenly it vanished alto-
gether. He was free. Val Marmax
had thrown a switch, followed by a
deep humming sound that seemed to
fill the room with an intangible force.
The black shadow rose to the roof, and
vanished, with a soundless scream.

I_TELENE w'as in Carver’s arms,

  A then, clinging to him wordlessly.
He looked down in her face and saw
horror. There was something else in
Shorraine, or Shorr, than these other
mysteries. He disengaged her gently.

  “What was it?” he asked, frowning
at the dull ache that remained in his
head.

  “The demon-people!” Helene mur-
mured.

  The demon-people—the city beyond
Shorraine—vague snatches of things he
had heard failed to dove-tail in Carver’s
mind. He looked quizzically al (he sci-
entist.

  “I haven’t told you the full story of
Shorr,” confessed Val Marmax. “Shorr,
of course, is a separate world from
Earth. It has its own—creatures. We
of Shorraine are outlanders, invaders,
in (hat sense. The higher life-forms

have achieved civilization—of a sort.
Their largest city is just fifty miles

away.”

  “Wh&t are they like?” Carver
queried.

  He saw the quick looks of loathing
in their faces. “They aren’t—human
in form,” answered the Atlantide. He
seemed reluctant to continue the topic.

  “You mean this shadow-thing was
one of them?”

  “No. They have definite form. But
they have a strange science, tangent to
ours. They are able to project astral
forms. One of them, the shadow-thing,
was sent here to probe your mind—to
read it!”

  “For what?” Carver was astonished.
Val Marmax shook his head. “I
don’t know. But I suspect it was to
find out what you knew of magnetism.
You see. they too have a Spot, connect-
ing with Earth! I didn’t mention it be-
fore, but Shorr and Earth impinge at
two points, according to their axis of
rotation. We built Shorraine around
the one. bul the demon-people kept con-
trol of the other.”

  Carver whistled. “I’ll say you didn’t
tell me the whole story. In fact, only
half. This complicates matters con-
siderably. What of the Earth-people
who have wandered into their spot?”
“Poor devils!” It was Tyson who
spoke, somberly. “Having to live, on
and on, as slaves of (he demon-people.
Suicide is probably the way out for
many of them.”

  “The demon-people, I take it, are
bitter enemies of mankind?” Carver
suggested.

  “They are different in all ways,” in-
formed Val Marmax. “Their forms,
minds, aims, science—everything. If
they once had the chance to invade
Earth, through their Spot, they would
trample down civilization ruthlessly.
We must be careful, in our work on
Spot-penetration. that they don’t steal
32

the secret. I have this laboratory pro-
tected from their astral-spying, how-
ever, and we can safely go on.”

  Carver wanted to ask more questions,
still quite hazy about the enemy, but
Val Marmax waved an impatient hand.
“I will tell you more some other time.
Right now”—his eyes were charged
with exultant hope—“you must show
me how to build a simple magnetic cir-
cuit. From that I’ll learn about this
unbelievable phenomenon — one that
has somehow escaped all the science of
Atlantis!”

  Carver was already rolling up his
sleeves. “Where’s some copper wire?”
He smiled whimsically at the thought
that he was going to show a twelve
thousand year old scientist, who could
blow mountains to atoms, how to make
a magnetic needle twist like a live thing.

  The following week in his new,
strange world, was a busy one for Bar-
ry Carver. He spent long hours with
Val Marmax, imparting to the scientist
all he knew about magnetism. The At-
lantide caught on quickly. His trained
mind leaped the gaps of understanding
at an accelerated pace. In a week, Val
Marmax had learned as much about
magnetism as it had taken Earth sci-
ence a century to uncover. Carver was
already out of his depth, but continued
to help, as laboratory assistant.

^ARVER had less time than he
^ wished to spend with Helene and
Tyson. The girl particularly. In his
eyes, she grew more lovely every day.
And for that reason, Carver was almost
rude to Queen Elsha, who dropped in
the laboratory at almost any odd hour.
Carver, alert, began to wonder what
game she was playing. She was not the
sort to do things aimlessly.

  On the third day, she ran across the
annoyance of Val Marmax, intent and
nervous as he was in his work.

  “Elsha, may I ask you to leave?’*

  She drew herself up haughtily, heavy-
lidded eyes insulted. “You forget I am
a Queen, Val Marmax!” she purred
dangerously.

  “Were a queen,” reminded the At-
lantide tactlessly. “And never mine
anyway.”

  Carver saw her quick, humiliated
flush, and had an inkling of her feel-
ings. He almost pitied her. Once
proud queen of a great people, in a
glorious era, and now a common mem-
ber of a democratic society, surrounded
by an indulgent pretense of her former
royal authority. It must hurt—espe-
cially through twelve thousand years of
memory.

  Perhaps she saw the sympathy in his
face. She turned to him. “I’ll leave.
But will you dine with me, tonight.
Barry Carver? Sometimes I am so—
alone.”

  At the point of refusing, Carver fell
under the hypnosis of her eyes. They
were pleading. He was surprised to
hear himself say “yes.”

  She swept her cloak about her glori-
ous figure and left.

  Val Marmax shook his head. “She’s
a queer case,” he confided. “She saw
much of the destruction of her land,
Mu. She almost lost her mind. For a
year, in Shorraine, she brooded and
even tried suicide. But she came out
of it, and since then has created a new
empire—of lovers. She has had the
pick of men, from the lowest to the
high.”

  Carver glimpsed a dreamy look in the
scientist’s eye, but said nothing, smil-
ing to himself. The things of Shorraine.
if ever the world heard about them,
would fill many libraries.

  Ushered into the queen’s presence
that evening, Carver’s heart beat faster.
She was a dream of brunette beauty,
clothed in sheer.robes, with soft, strate-
gically placed lights to bring out her
lo'viiest Charms. Almost, he retreated.
PRISON OF TIME

33

But again a subtle magnetism gripped
him. Perfume mounted headily to his
intoxicated mind.

  She told him of Mu as they ate, a
heavenly land in a golden era. It was
a spell of enchantment, with her low,
husky voice lulling his senses. A rich,
synthetic wine more delectable than any
he had ever tasted in Earth, did more
to confuse him till he had forgotten all
but her witching presence. Dimly, in
the back of his mind, he thought of her
past, her real age. but it was a lost voice.

  The food cleared away, she sat close
beside him on the couch.

  “Kiss me!” she commanded softly.

  Carver gripped himself. “You’re a
queen,” he tried to say casually.

  “Not tonight,” she whispered. “To-
night I’m a woman—a lonely one. I—”

  Carver, leaning toward the alluring
lips, caught something in the corner of
his eye. A black something. His con-
fused mind tried to snap alert. That
black thing was—danger!

  With a cry, he leaped erect and
pulled from his belt the hand-projector
that would spray high-frequency waves
through the room. Val Marmax had
given it to him, as a protection against
astral visitants. The black, formless
shadow, about to envelop his head, quiv-
ered and puffed soundlessly into the
ceiling, passing through matter as
though it didn’t exist.

CARVER snapped off the instrument.
The shadow-things, of all the
queer things in Shorr, decidedly ap-
pealed to him the least.

  Queen Elsha did not seem too dis-
turbed. “It is nothing new,” she said.
•‘Sit down, Barry.”

  “No.” The spell had been broken,
and Carver realized how close he had
been drawn to something unworthy. “I
won’t be next on your list, Queen El-
sha.”

  She flushed angrily. “You think you

love that Helene child!” she blazed.

  “I’m going to marry her,” said
Carver.

  “You prefer her to me. wretch?” It
was the Queen of Mu talking, imperi-
ously. “She has washed out eyes, skin-
ny limbs, a simpering smile. What can
you see in her, fool?”

  “Youth,” said Carver, brutally frank,
turning to leave. He had one glimpse
of her face before he left—a blaze of
fury. What was that expression about
a woman scorned? Carver laughed,
and forgot about the Queen of ancient
Mu.

  The following day, Tom Tyson
brought the news that Carver was to be
given an official welcome to Shorraine
by its “rulers.”

  Carver smiled. “After I’ve been
here ten days, picked its number one
beauty as my future wife, and started
collaboration with its chief scientist!”

  “What is time in Shorraine?” mur-
mured Tyson, with a reflective air that
betrayed the middle-aged maturity be-
hind his boyish face. “Once, through
an error, an Italian of Columbus’ time
lived in Shorraine for a century before
the Five heard of him. His entrance-
date, corresponding to ‘birth’ in Shor-
raine, was never fully settled in the rec-
ords.”

  The headquarters of the Five were
contained in the central and highest
towers of the city, a combination of
palace and business office. Here were
hundreds of clerks and administrators,
conducting the daily affairs of Shor-
raine. and its million inhabitants. It
was a smooth-running organization,
long since brought to perfection, as
nearly as man could achieve.

  The receiving room of the Five was
bare, simple, a symbol of their own cog-
nizance that they did not “rule” Shor-
raine autocratically. Dressed no differ-
ent than the rest, the five Atlantides
were old, patriarchal in appearance.
34

Their eyes shone, as Val Marmax’s had,
with calm, cool wisdom. They looked
at Carver as though weighing him on
the spot, as they doubtless had so many
others in their long past.

  One of them stepped forward.

  “Welcome to Shorraine!” he said, in
the perfect English Carver had come to
expect. But he started a little as the
Atlantide thrust out his hand in a ges-
ture that likely had never been known
in Atlantis. Carver gripped it warmly.
Tyson grinned.

  “I taught them that,” he whispered
in an aside.

  “Since there is no return from Shor-
raine.’’ spoke the Atlantide, ‘•you. Bar-
ry Carver, were a citizen of our city the
moment you arrived. As such, you will
respect and obey the laws of Shorraine,
and the common good. We are not your
rulers. We are a living Constitution,
never ourselves deciding the application
of fundamental articles laid down ten
thousand years ago, when this govern-
ment was founded. You understand?”

D EALIZING there was no stilted
A formality in this, Carver nodded
and then asked, “What of the first two
thousand years?”

  “Evolution of government,” smiled
the Atlantide, nodding as though com-
mending the question. “During the
building of the city, everyone worked
with a will, to found a lasting home.
Then came the thought of government.
In two thousand year’s, many forms
were tried. At times”—his eyes grew
a little sad—“there was even struggle,
revolution. Also, for a century, a des-
pot ruled and there was near chaos. He
was assassinated, finally. Anarchy, too.
prevailed for a while. But the light
shone through, and at last we found the
happy combination of personal liberty
and communal cooperation that pre-
vails today. It has lasted ten thousand
years.”

  “Democracy!” stated Carver.

  “It is nearest to that in your time.”
agreed the Atlantide. “But—superior.”
Carver couldn't doubt that, of a form
of government that had been matured
four thousand years before the Egyp-
tians on Earth had broken away from
tribal rule. He realized that if the Spot
were conquered, one of Shorraine’s
most magnificent contributions to Earth
civilization would be a perfected model
of government, tried by the fire and
sword of time. And without dictator-
ship!

  “And now,” the Atlantide resumed,
“we have been informed of your work
with Val Marmax.” His grave eyes
shone eagerly. “We hope you succeed
in penetrating the Spot. In that event,
perhaps many of our citizens will prefer
to go back to Earth. But some will re-
main. and there will be intercourse be-
tween Shorraine and Earth. We have
long awaited the day.”

  Carver looked at their five face^.

  “I think we will succeed. Val Mar-
max is hopeful.” He paused. “There
is a great war out there, today, as you
must know. Would Shorraine help the
side of the Allied Democracies, against
the threat of dictatorship?”

  “The People’s Council would decide.”
The Atlantide's voice was non-commit-
tal, but Carver read much in their
glances at one another. “When the
Spot is definitely penetrated, a Council
will instantly be called. If our interven-
tion in the war is voted upon, the de-
tails of ships and armament will imme-
diately be settled.”

  “Good enough,” said Carver.

  On the way to Val Marmax’s labora-
tory, in their ship. Carver thought again
of the Japanese force he had spied strik-
ing into vulnerable Allied territory.

  “How soon could Shorraine,” he
asked, “send out an aerial force?”

  •	Quicker than you think,” Tyson
spoke excitedly. “I’ve been thinking it

over a lot, since you and Val got to-
gether. There are at least ten thousand
light, fast ships. Mounted with the
beam-gun, they’d be a match for ten
times their number of Earth ships—at
least the World War kind. Top-speed,
500 miles an hour. Can turn on a dime,
with gravity-brakes. Beam’s range—
a mile. Power-source, one cabbage-
sized atomic-motor. Fuel, one hatful
of sand, lasting 48 hours. How does
that stack up with your modern ships?”
“Okay,” asserted Carver. “But I’d
need more. You can’t stop an army
with that. You need bombs to blow up
and cut off all ground lines of communi-
cation and reinforcement.”

  “All right. How about one thousand
ships, big ones, used around here for
hauling building material. They could
carry all the bombs you could load on
the deck. Atomic-bombs—one would
make a mountain fold up!”

/'''’ARVER grunted in approval. “But
^ how long to turn out all that? The
Jap army I want to stop, if possible, will
smash through in three weeks.”

  “Robot machinery,” reminded Ty-
son. “Overnight, practically.” His
eyes glistened. “Boy, the chance to
bring a few more Boches down! You
have more than Boches in this war, but
the enemy’s the enemy. I’ll finish up
where I left off in the last war.”

  “If we get through the Spot.” Carver
was suddenly pessimistic. Perhaps the
Spot was impenetrable, and all his hopes
built on sand. Was it possible for his
simple suggestion of magnetism to un-
lock the door to Earth, when Shor-
raine’s super - science had battered
against it in vain for twelve thousand
years? It almost seemed too much to
hope for.

  It was just a week after Carver’s first
visit with Val Marmax that the scientist
set up his experimental apparatus with-
in the Spot. The giant gates of Shor-

raine were open. Tyson and Helene
were there, and Proxides was on guard
against beasts, but no others. The gen-
eral populace had not been informed.
Some few watched, idly, from the nearer
avenues and windows, unaware of the
importance of what they saw.

  Carver had helped set up the tripod,
upholding the apparatus. A small, pow-
erful electromagnet, keynote of the in-
strument, hummed as Val Marmax sent
power hissing through it from a nearby
atomic-generator. The scientist indi-
cated the slow twist of a magnetic nee-
dle.

  “When it points straight out toward
Earth, the way should be open.” He
washed his hands in the air nervously.
“Anything thrust through the magnetic
field should reverse the spin of its elec-
trons—enter the normal Earth dimen-
sion. Ishtu be kind!”

  Finally the needle pointed quiver-
ingly straight through the Spot, like the
finger of Fate. The machine sang as its
energies battled the strange time-stric-
ture. The space through the field-coils
of the magnet turned from blue to soft
yellow. The glare of the Sahara? Car-
ver crossed his fingers in hope.

  Val Marmax, drawing a breath,
tossed a ring of metal through the mag-
net, out toward the mirage of Earth.
They ran to the other side. The ring
was not there! The Atlantide lighted
a peculiar handflash in whose circle of
strange rays the sands of Earth stood
out clearly. He played the ultra-light
around till suddenly the metal ring
leaped into sight.

  It had gone through the Spot safely.
It rested now in the time-dimension of
Earth.

  Val Marmax stood motionlessly,
then, staring as though he couldn’t be-
lieve. Carver wondered what his
thoughts must be, he who had striven
ceaselessly for twelve millennia to ac-
complish this miracle. The scientist
36

DYNAMIC Science Stories

turned suddenly, to look at Shorraine.
It was the glance of a man who sees re-
lease from an age-long prison.

  Tyson broke the silence.

  “If that space was big enough, I’d
crawl through right now!” he threat-
ened.

  Carver swept Helene Ward into his
arms. “You’re going to get your church
wedding, darling!” he declared. “Any
church you want—on Earth!”

  ‘ On Earth!” echoed the girl happily.

  “I suppose I should wish you two ev-
ery happiness?”

' I 'HEY turned, startled. It was

*	Queen Elsha. They hadn’t seen her
come up, from the shadow of the wall.
She gazed at them a queer mockery in
her eyes, as though they were children
who amused her. Apparently, Carver
thought, she bore him no animosity for
their last meeting.

  “Thanks, Queen Elsha,” Carver ac-
knowledged, but realized that she had
not actually given the wish.

  Her dark eyes turned interestedly on
Val Marmax’s Spot-penetration appara-
tus. “The way is open—to earth!” she
murmured. “At last!”

  And this sentiment came in a rising
murmur that wafted from the towering
city at their backs. Up on the wall,
Proxides had yelled into his televisor.
With the swiftness of light, the news
went around the city. Faces began to
peer from all windows, roofs, from ships
that darted gracefully near. A city of
immortals raised its voice in thanks, to
a hundred different gods, that the ada-
mant walls of the prison of time had
fallen.

  Val Marmax gripped Carver’s hand.

  “You showed me the way,” he said
with frank honesty. “It is done. The
time-warp can be simply negotiated
back to Earth.”

  “J want ships to go throueh the
warp,” aaid Carver, practically.

“Armed ships, to help my side in the
war—our side. Can you build some
kind of large magnet for that purpose?”
“No, there is a better way,” returned
the scientist thoughtfully. “I’ll have
individual units made, spraying out the
magnetic force, to be mounted at each
ship’s prow. They will sail right through
the Spot, then, into the Earth dimen-
sion.”

  “Good!” Carver was jubilant. “But
work fast. A fleet of ships must leave
within two weeks. Every minute
counts!”

  The scientist smiled. “I have lived
for twelve thousand years. Now, sud-
denly, every minute counts! It is as
though Fate’s threads had all suddenly
gnarled. Strange! But I’ll work out
the indivdual units tonight,” he prom-
ised. He .went on a bit pridefully.
“Your science gave me the key I
needed, but I will in one night work out
what any of your scientists would take
a year to devise.”

  “Can I help?” offered Carver.

  “No, but I think Helene can. She
knows shorthand. She has helped me
before. I’ll dictate all data, specifica-
tions, and plans for their manufacture
to her. Tomorrow, the factories will
begin turning them out.”

  Carver suddenly whirled, jerking out
his high-frequency pistol. He sprayed
its forces over the Spot apparatus. A
black shadow that had been slinking
around its contours swirled off into the
sky.

  “An astral spy!” exclaimed Val Mar-
max. “The demon-people are trying to
steal the secret. We must be on guard.
My laboratory is protected from them.
But tomorrow, when we begin manu-
facture of the units, we will have to
guard the factories.” His face was pale.
“Better that we never had found the
way than that the demon-people should
invade Earth!”

  Barry Carver spent a busy evening.
PRISON OF TIME

37

First he went to the Five, informed
them of the experiment’s success, and
asked for the Council on war. They
readily agreed to call it the following
day. Then, with Tyson, he had written
down tentative plans for a war fleet, to
be presented to the Council. When Ty-
son left, Carver called the laboratory.
Helene’s sweet face ghosted into the
visi-screen.

  “Busy, darling?”

  “Yes, but happy!”

  “I keep worrying about those damned
black shadow-things,” Carver muttered.
“Are you sure you’re safe there?”
“Perfectly!” assured the girl, half
chidingly. “Val Marmax has taken the
added precaution of having his whole
laboratory surrounded by guards armed
with beam-guns, in case the demon-peo-
ple tried to spy around in person. Now
don’t worry, and get some sleep. You’ve
been driving yourself too much all
week.”

/'"''ARVER hung up with a restless
' feeling. Now that events were
coming to a climax, his mind seethed
with vague fears. He stepped out on
the balcony, looking over the city of
mystery. It lay like a tinsel fairyland,
in its own towerlights, incredibly beau-
tiful, age-old, weird. He looked up.
There was no moon in Shorr’s skies,
only a firmament of strange, fiery stars.
Perhaps the native people of this world
had charted them into constellations of
their own. His hand unconsciously
gripped the butt of his wave-gun as he
thought of the demon-people, and their
eerie astral wanderings.

  He heard the buzzing of his visi-
phone and went to answer it. The face
of Elsha, Queen of Mu, greeted him.

  “Barry Carver,” she pleaded, “I
want to see you. It’s important. Please
come over right away.”

  “No!” snapped Carver.

  She argued, and all the while her eyes

were on his. He tried to fight their in-
fluence but again a subtle hypnotism
cast its spell. Agreeing finally, he re-
flected vaguely, as he went to the ship
terrace, that mere man could not fight
the magnetic allure that the woman had
built up in twelve thousand years of
practice. But he promised himself sav-
agely that he would tell her once and
for all to give up the chase. Pointed
insults would repulse even her.

  He stepped into the witchery of her
presence, and the straight-laced words
he had thought up came out haltingly.
She smiled through it all, though he
sensed the suppressed fury behind her
lidded eyes.

  “All right, Barry Carver, I under-
stand,” she said calmly. “I drink to
your happiness—with the woman you
choose.”

  Carver did not think of her odd use
of tense in the words till he had drunk
half his glass, in relieved courtesy to the
toast. He set the glass down.

  “What do you mean—choose? I
have chosen already.”

  He glared at her, but suddenly his
eyes swam. His brain reeled. He stag-
gered to the couch, almost falling.
Elsha was close now, peering into his
eyes—waiting. The thought ham-
mered in Carver’s mind that the drink
had been drugged.

  “The woman you—chose!” repeated
the Queen of Mu. “And you choose me.
You love me, Barry!”

  And suddenly it was all clear to
Barry Carver. He loved her. the Queen
of Mu. Of course! She was a glo-
rious, desirable woman. How had he
ever thought Helene Ward was the one?
His head sank to her shoulder. Bab-
bling words of devotion came from his
lips. His voice seemed to come from
somewhere outside of him, from a vast
roaring distance.

  Then hers, though in his confusion he
could scarcely understand what she
38

DYNAMIC Science Stories

said. “I will be queen again! A queen
needs a king beside her on the throne.
You will be my king, Barry, beloved.
More than any other man, in twelve
thousand years, you are my choice. We
will rule Shorraine, you and I, even
after the Spot is opened. They have
promised me that.”

  Carver’s head came up, dizzily.
“King? Rule?” he mumbled. “I don’t
—understand.” Dim instincts of warn-
ing worked within him. He staggered
to his feet.

   “Yes, go now, Barry,” she said. “Go
back to your room and sleep. Tomor-
row, it will be clearer to you. You will
come to me in the morning.”

jV/IUTTERING, Carver stumbled to
A A his ship. Elsha’s servant quietly
piloted him back to his quarters. In
bed, Carver’s thoughts were a dizzying
turmoil. He was sure of only one thing
—that he loved Elsha. Queen of Mu!

  He awoke with a hand shaking his
shoulder frantically. It was still night,
with dawn about to break. Tom Ty-
son’s boyish face, aged now by some
urgency, peered down at him.

  “Get up, Barry!” His voice was
hoarse. “Something’s happened. I just
got the call from Proxides, and came
over to take you along.”

  “What happened?” demanded Car-
ver, fully awake.

  Tyson’s lips worked. “Val Marmax
is gone! Taken bv force! By—”

  “Yes?”

  “The demon-people!” Tyson’s young
 face looked haggard.

   Carver dressed hurriedly, and in a
 short while their ship descended to the
 great gate’s parapet. Proxides came
 forward, nursing an arm whose bicep
 was a torn, bloody mass that he had
 hastily bandaged.

   “Just touched me as they went by,”
 he growled. “Jove curse them—”

   Carver stopped his flow of Greek in-
vective. “The whole story, from the
beginning!”

  “I saw the ship slant down to Val
Marmax’s laboratory. I seldom sleep
at night; time enough in the day. It
landed on the roof. A few minutes
later I saw a flash of a guard’s beam-
gun, on the roof. The ship swung up,
and some blasting force from it laid the
guards out like sticks. As it slanted
past me, I took a pot-shot at it, and got
this.” He touched his arm. “It was
the demon-people. I saw their devilish
eyes.”

  “But why didn’t you sound the alarm
when you first saw the ship?” groaned
Carver. “And the guards—they let
them get into the laboratory!”

  “It was Queen Elsha’s ship!” re-
turned Proxides.

  Carver gasped, looking at Tyson.

  ‘‘That’s the only reason they suc-
ceeded,” said Tyson. “Queen Elsha is
allowed to go anywhere she pleases, at
any time, without question. She has
always done so. She must have helped
them!”

  Confusion rose in Carver’s mind.
Could she have done such a traitorous
thing, leagued herself with the demon-
people? And last night—had she
drugged him, perhaps to make sure he
wouldn’t interfere with the abduction?
It was a horrible indictment against the
woman. He was unwilling to believe
it.

  “There’s one other thing, Barry.'’
Tyson spoke slowly. “Helene—was
taken too!”

  Carver shook. For a moment he stood
stiffly, conquering a wild rage. Then lie
motioned to the laboratory. They de-
scended to it. On the roof lay the bod-
ies of the slain guards, bloodily torn as
though by some internal bomb. Tyson
explained, from what he had heard, that
the demon-people’s weapon was a tele-
kinetic disrupting force.
PRISON OF TIME

  Down below, they found a group of
bewildered guards conversing. The lab-
oratory was a ruin, obviously blasted by
the force-weapon. Not one scrap of
Val Marmax’s scientific labors on the
Spot-penetration was left. The guards’
story was the same as that of Proxides.
No one had bothered to watch who or
what came out of Queen Elsha’s ship,
in the darkness of the roof. Suddenly
they had heard noises, screams. By the
time they had arrived, from their vari-
ous posts, the ship was gone, the dam-
age done.

“IT’S all plain,” muttered Tyson.

 ^ “Queen Elsha led them below. They
worked fast, secretly. And now the
demon-people have Val Marmax in
their hands. They’ll force the Spot se-
cret from him—invade Earth!”

  “Come on!” cried Carver. “We’re
going to see Queen Elsha about this.”
“If she’s there,” said Tyson. “She
may have gone along with them—”

  But they found her in her apartment,
weeping loudly. Even her tear-strained
face was incredibly beautiful. On the
floor lay her servant, in a pool of blood
from his own shattered skull.

  “I know something terrible has hap-
pened!” she sobbed. “An hour ago the
demon-people came here and took my
ship. They killed my servant, tied me.”
She pointed to strips of silk on the floor.
“I just worked free. What did they do
with my ship?” She stared at them
with innocent apprehension.

  The two men looked at one another.
If it was acting, it was magnificent. Ty-
son’s lips writhed.

  “Pretty thin alibi. Queen Elsha,” he
snapped. “You know very well that
Val Marmax and Helene Ward were
abducted, guards killed. You were
there!”

  The woman gasped, as though the
news stunned her. Then she rose with
outraged dignity. “Dog! How dare

you! ” she spat at Tyson. “Did you see
me there? Did anyone see me there?
How can you make such unfounded ac-
cusations!”

  Tyson growled. “Yes, some of the
guards saw you!”

  Carver waited to see the effect of the
bluff, for any guards that might have
seen her were dead. For himself, he
was in a quandary. He had seen no
sign as yet of guilt in her words or at-
titude. She might be the picture of in-
nocence she presented.

  Queen Elsha tilted her face haughtily,
ignoring Tyson. She turned the full
power of her glorious eyes on Carver.
“Barry, this boy is insulting me. But
you aren’t suspicious of me, are you?”
She held out her arms. “You haven’t
forgotten last night—kiss me, Barry!”
Carver made no move, except to
shake his head. “Last night—what a
fool I was!” he murmured.

  For the first time, the woman’s eyes
showed perturbation. “But you love
me!” she declared.

  “No,” denied Carver. “I don’t know
what kind of drug you gave me last
night, but I know that the effects have
worn off. I—”

  He was interrupted by a sharp cry
from Queen Elsha. Her hand went to
her mouth and she fell back a step.
Some violent emotion worked within her
—disappointment, frustration, then
hysterical rage.

  “They tricked me!” she raved.
“They told me it would last for years—
forever!” She was sobbing again—
genuinely, Carver sensed—and rapidly
going to pieces.

  Carver leaped forward, his own fare
working. He grasped her by the shoul-
ders and shook her. “Who’s they—
the demon-people? Out with it, wom-
an, or I’ll—” He raised his hand
threateningly, determined to get the
truth out of her.

  She didn’t wince at the gesture.
40

Something else forced her to speak,
within herself. “Yes, the demon-peo-
ple! Oh, what have I done?” Her
tones were almost a shriek.

  Carver forced her back on the couch
and slapped her face lightly. “No
hysterics,” he ground out. “Why did
you do it?”

  Composing .herself with an effort, she
looked up at him.

  “For you!” she murmured unhappily.
“And for my—kingdom! I wanted you
from the first, Barry. No man, in
twelve thousand years, has ever stirred
me more. And your resistance, your
scorn, drove me—mad! ”

CHE swallowed and went on, in a dry
defeated voice. “They came to me
in astral forms. I made a bargain with
them—for a love-philtre! The demon-
people have a strange science, almost a
sorcery. The philtre would give me
your love. And in return I would help
them abduct Val Marmax. Also, I was
to help them conquer—Shorraine!
Among the men who man Shorraine’s
defenses, I have many devoted—
friends. They would do my bidding,
let the demon-people’s ship past, to at-
tack the city. In return for that, after
the conquest, I would be made Queen
of Shorraine. Even later, of part of
Earth!”

  Carver listened with incredulous
amazement. Monstrous bargain! Yet
dimly he could understand. It had
rankled in her mind for twelve thou-
sand years that she had once been a
queen. And she had never before been
balked in love, most likely. In a mad
moment, she had seen the chance to at-
tain both her desires, bargained with the
enemy, sold out her people with cold-
blooded indifference.

  “Good God, woman!” groaned Car-
ver. “Do you realize what a horrible
thing you’ve done? I don’t know much
about the demon-people, but you’ve

given them the chance to invade Earth.
If they worm the Spot secret out of Val
Marmax and then kill him, we won’t
even have a chance to warn the outside
jvorld!”

  The proud Queen of ancient Mu hung
her head. “It was madness!” she
moaned. “If I could only undo it!”
“Too late now,” growled Tyson. His
eyes reviled her. He turned to Carver.
“Something has to be done.”

  Carver was pacing the thick rug,
frowning in thought. “There’s only one
thing I can see. Attack the demon-
people—now! Stop them from going
on. Destroy them completely if pos-
sible!”

  Tyson shook his head. “Afraid it
wouldn’t be so easy, Barry. They’re
well armed, the city fortified. Shor-
raine has had battles with them before,
trying to fescue the poor souls they’ve
enslaved, arriving through their Spot.”
“But surely the science of Shorraine
is superior to theirs?”

  “They have their own weapon and
ours!” returned Tyson gloomily.
“Through the centuries, they’ve man-
aged to steal scientific secrets, with their
damned astral spying. They even have
robot machinery, modeled after ours. In
a drawn-out war, they’d have the su-
periority of numbers, too. We might
win, though, even against those odds.”
He shrugged fatalistically. “I suppose
it’s the only course left.”

  “Wait!”

  Carver whirled on the Queen of Mu.
“When are they supposed to attack
Shorraine?”

  The woman looked up spiritlessly.
“Tomorrow.”

  “And they don’t know—” Carver
suddenly jerked out his high-frequency
pistol. A black, shapeless shadow had
slithered into the room. It puffed away
with its peculiar telepathic scream as
the wave-gun hissed.
PRISON OF TIME

41

  ‘ They must be suspicious,” resumed
Carver. ‘‘But they don’t know that
(V-.-'-en Elsha has told her story. Shor-
raine will meet them tomorrow with full
force. Let them wear down their forces
a little, attacking. Then Shorraine can
attack.” He went on rapidly. “In the
meantime, you and 1 will go to the
demon-people’s city!”

'T'YSON stared. “We’ll be killed or
^ captured. What—”

  “Queen Elsha will take us,” Carver
said tersely. “As converts, friends to
their cause, or something. Anything,
just so we get into their city safely. We
have to try rescuing Val Marmax, and
Helene!”

  It was a wild scheme, Carver knew,
but every moment that Val Marmax
was in their hands counted against
Shorraine—and Earth. And Helene—
he wouldn’t have a moment’s peace till
he saw her again, stood at her side, no
matter under what circumstances.
“I’m game,” Tyson said simply.
“Will you do it, Queen Elsha?”
queried Carver. “Get us into their
city on some pretext?”

  She started as though coming out of
a worried dream. “Anything you say,
Barry,” she agreed tonelessly. “Any-
thing to—atone!”

  Before the Five, a short time later,
Carver gave the full details in brief
phrases. The alarm had rung through
the city, over the abduction, but none
had known the full story. The Five
looked with terrible scorn at Queen
Elsha and she shrank visibly.

  “Elsha.” said the spokesman, “you
have done an incalculable harm. Five
hundred years ago you fomented a
minor revolution among your—friends.
You gave a promise afterward never to
again raise trouble, which you’ve
broken now. Your punishment—”
“Never mind that!” snapped Carver.
“Now that it’s done, the important

thing is stopping the enemy. She has
to take us into their city. We’ll do what
we can to rescue Val Marmax. In the
meantime, protect Shorraine from their
attack tomorrow. And then attack
them—whether we come back or not!”

  The Atlantide nodded. “We will
have the Council place us on an imme-
diate wartime footing.” He glanced at
Carver. “You are a brave man, Barry
Carver. We wish you luck, for your
own sake as well as for the good of
Shorraine—and Earth!”

  A few minutes later the craft bear-
ing the three soared up and darted over
the spires of Shorraine. Wild looking
land, unearthlike in aspect, flew be-
neath them. Strange slinking monsters
crept in the shadows of mushrooming
vegetation. Far in the distance, once,
they saw the hulking shape of some
earthly dinosaur. Carver shuddered.
Shorr was a forbidding, depressing
world. Small wonder that the immor-
tals of Shorraine would eagerly leave
it, at the price of death.

  Phoryx, the city of the demon-peo-
ple, climbed over the horizon like a
black, cubistic monster. Copied partly
from Shorraine’s slim grace, it was a
twisted parody, as though insane minds
had been the architects. The building
material was all of blacks and hideous
blues and purples. The demon-people
likely saw lighter colors only as greys.

  When they had approached within a
mile, Tyson brought the ship to a halt,
hovering on its anti-gravity plane.

  “We’re liable to get shot down if we
go any closer without being expected,”
he explained.

  Carver saw a black astral shape ma-
terialize over their heads. Queen El-
sha shook her head as he was about to
draw his wave-gun. She was more com-
posed now, and wailed calmly as the
mysterious thing settled about her head,
like an intangible vampire.

  She seemed to listen for a moment
42

DYNAMSC Science Stories

and then spoke aloud. “I wish to see
Sha-tahn. It is important.” Again a
pause. “They are friends of mine—and
of Phoryx. I have a plan, relating to
them, for Sha-tahn to hear.”

'TTIE astral body hovered for another

*	moment and then darted up from
her head. It floated to the prow of the
ship and moved forward, as though
guiding the way.

  “Follow it,” the Queen of Mu saitl
to Tyson. “It is well so far. We will
have an audience with Sha-tahn. ruler
of all the demon-people. I’ll contrive to
find out from him where Val Marmax
is kept prisoner.”

  “And Helene,” added Carver. He
looked at her grimly. “We’re taking a
big chance with you, Queen Elsha. I f
you try to betray us—” He patted the
heat-gun in his bell suggestively.

  Tyson took a breath and moved his
levers to follow the astral guide. It led
them slanting down to an immense
building facing a great gate of dull
metal. The other Spot! Through it,
if they had the chance, the denizens of
Shorr would swarm, toward Earth.

  They landed on the roof. Carver no-
ticed with a wry grin that the building’s
several towers all leaned. Poor struc-
tural engineers. Their ghostly guide led
them into the gloomy interior. The
halls were so dimly lit that they could
barely see their way. The demon-peo-
ple hated light, Carver conjectured. He
saw several dark forms, solid ones, but
couldn’t make out their shape. He
hadn't as yet seen one of the enemy and
wondered what they’d be like.

  They finally brought up against a
corrosion-stained metal door. The
astral being went through but the visi-
tors had to wait till it opened. The
chamber beyond was more lighted and
Carver strode in, with the feeling of
walking into a lion’s den.

  He stopped short after a few steps,

his lower jaw dropping. He stared at
the creatures gathered in a little semi-
circle. They were satyrs! The satyrs
of mythology, with furred bestial
bodies, hind hooves, arched tails. From
the waist up they were faintly human,
with manlike arms, hands and shoul-
ders. The faces were satanic—pointed
ears, flaring noses, protruding jaws and
lips, and tiny horns at the temples. Re-
pulsive, alien, inimical.

  Carver would have been less sur-
prised to see creatures with five legs or
two heads. But satyrs, out of the pages
of mythology—coincidence or not? He
felt himself at the verge of a blinding
revelation.

  He tore his eyes away from their gar-
goyle countenances, to look around.
His heart leaped as he saw Helene, at
the side, held firmly by the arms. She
called his name, but he had to ignore
her, playing his part. He tried to tell
her with his eyes that he was supposed
to be a renegade helper of Queen Mu in
the plot against Shorraine.

  Queen Elsha, playing her part, spoke:
“These are two men who have griev-
ances and will help fight against Shor-
raine.”

  One of the black-skinned satyrs, set
off from his fellows by a mitre-like hat,
leaned forward in a carven seat, rolling
his redly gleaming eyes over them. He
smiled slowly. It was evil incarnate.

  “You lie!” he stated, in hissing Eng-
lish. “I read your mind, before, with
my astral projection. We are masters
in such things. The big man is Barry
Carver, here in the attempt to rescue
Val ]\farmax!”

CO suddenly and completely exposed,
^ Carver’s instinctive reaction was to
jerk out his heat-gun. But two of the
demon-beings had already leaped like
deer and wrested it out of his hand.
Then they held his arms in viselike
grips. Tyson was similarly disarmed,
PRISON OF TIME

43

beside hiiy.

  Queen Elsha stood in mute dismay.
Carver saw that now, clearly, she un-
derstood how she had been duped and
led on by the enemy, to her own undo-
ing.

  The leader of the satyrs thrust his
brutal face forward.

  “I am Sha-tahn,” he announced,
“ruler of Phoryx. These are my lieu-
tenants”—he pointed down the line—
“Zoroaster, Belial, Beelzebub, Python,
Asmodeus, Merizim, Apollyon, Asto-
roth, Mammon. You have heard the
names before, Earthman?”

  Carver gasped. Those were the
names of all the evil “gods” in man’s re-
ligious history. And Sha-tahn—was
that Satan! What mad riddle was this,
more baffling than anything else in
Shorr?

  The satyr ruler answered, in part.
“We have been able to project our as-
tral images into Earth—by a psychic
science you would not understand—
and in some manner sway the lives of
men, in the past. But soon we will
sway them completely. You, Barry
Carver, have made it possible, with the
secret of.magnetism. Look!”

  He swept an arm and some of the
satyrs stepped back. Beyond them, as
Carver peered closely in the dim light-
ing, he saw Val Marmax for the first
time. He reclined on a couch, eyes
closed, breathing slow. Around his
head, almost obscuring it, was an astral-
shadow, pulsating like a mental leech
feeding. And it was! Nearby, scrib-
bling busily on thick slates, a dozen
satyrs recorded the telepathic messages
from the astral prober.

  Carver lurched forward angrily, but
the satyrs held him back. He realized
what they were extracting from Val
Marmax’s mind—the secret of Spot-
penetration!

  Suddenly the satyrs stopped writing.
The astral shadow vanished as one of

them punched a switch on a panel. Val
Marmax sat up, dazed. Agony leaped
into his eyes, mental agony. He spied
Carver, started, and then shook his
head.

  “They have the secret, Barry!” he
groaned. “I tried to resist—” He be-
gan sobbing brokenly.

  “Yes, and from the girl we have al-
ready extracted another secret,” spoke
Sha-tahn, “relating to the Earth war—
that a Japanese army marches to the
Indian sea!”

  Carver jerked. Did these devils—
literal devils!—plan to help the Dicta-
torship Coalition?

  Partly reading his thoughts again,
Sha-tahn nodded.

  “When we have penetrated the Spot,
we will smash all opposition to that
army. We will bring victory to their
side, helping in other campaigns. It
will be an easier way to gain dominance
of Earth—our long-awaited aim. We
will bargain with the Dictators and be-
come Earth's new—religion!”

  He was leaving much unsaid, Carver
sensed. Something unspeakably horri-
ble lay behind his matter-of-fact plans.
Rage shook Carver. “You have no
right to meddle in Earth’s affairs!” he
shouted. “You don't belong in Earth! "
Sha-tahn grinned evilly. “We have
had more to do with Earth’s affairs than
you know. Have you ever heard of a
man possessed of the devil? Possessed
of our astral projection! Many of your
conquerors of past history were guided
by us, in that way. But they always
fail, at the last. This time, they won’t!”
He waved his arm to another dark
corner of the chamber. Carver saw a
line of men, humans, standing stiffly.
Their eyes were wide, unblinking^ lips
straight, features emotionless. A word
flashed in Carver’s mind—zombies!
Mindless, dominated creatures—pos-
sessed of the devil! Poor unfortunates
who had staggered through the Spot
44

DYNAMiC Science Stories

from Earth into evil Phoryx.

/'"'’ARVER'S eyes flicked down the
line and then stopped on one figure.
Angular face, lick of hair over the fore-
head. small mustache—Hitler! No, he
must be wrong, mad to think so! He
looked again and knew he could not be
mistaken. Carver staggered in the re-
alization. The demigod whose assassi-
nation had precipitated the great con-
flict on Earth—alive here in Phoryx!
Madness!

  Then Carver remembered the pecu-
liar circumstances surrounding the for-
mer dictator’s assassination. His plane,
flying over the Sahara on a visit to
newly gained African colonies, had
been attacked, shot down, in a deep-laid
assassination plot. But when the wreck
of his plane had been located the next
day, all bodies were accounted for ex-
cept his! Obviously, he had survived
the crash, staggered away and reached
Shorr, exactly as Carver had.

  “You see?” said Sha-tahn. “I have
military Earth minds for leadership in
the campaign, to bring about a smash-
ing victory for Dictatorship. Beside
the man you know stands Genghis
Kahn, from the past, who, unknown to
your history, was exiled to the desert
and reached Shorr. And those others
—generals and conquerors all. They
will rule Earth, and we of Phoryx will
be its—religion! ”

  Carver's mind rebelled. It was all
such a frightful maze, involving Earth’s
past, present and future. Phoryx, a lit-
eral hell, whose spawn of evil would
soon burst out over Earth like a poison-
ous tide!

  And, in the final analysis, Carver
himself was to blame.

  “But enough!” barked Sha-tahn.
“Take the prisoners away. We will
check the Spot-penetration data. If it
works, they will be killed. We will
have no more need lor them. They are

dangerous alive.” He turned. “As for
you, Queen Elsha—”

  “You deceived me!” she shrilled.
“You told me the love philtre would
give me his devotion till the end of time.
Its effects were over the next morning.
That is why I betrayed you!”

  Carver had to admire her sudden de-
fiance, in the face of a probable death
sentence.

  “Rash creature!” said Sha-tahn
calmly. “I wanted to test you. I can
make the philtre to last longer—weeks,
years. I will give you another chance,
Queen Elsha. Go back to Shorraine
and reduce its defenses. It must still
be destroyed.”

  The queen’s manner changed in-
stantly, from fear to wild hope. “And
Barry Carver will then be left alive—
for me?” she demanded.

  The being known as Sha-tahn hesi-
tated and then nodded, but with a hid-
den mockery in his eyes that Carver
saw. He thought of warning the queen
against trusting a—devil. But he
shrugged. He knew the queen’s treach-
erous nature wouldn’t listen to reason.
Besides, it wouldn't make any differ-
ence to him, in any case.

  The Queen of Mu looked at Carver,
with a rapt, eager gaze. Then she
whirled, on her way back to further be-
trayal of Shorraine.

  “Witch of hell!” hissed Carver.
Queen Elsha stopped, glanced at him
once, then went on, leaving the room.

  Carver looked around. Was it hope-
less to think of escape from these
fiends? He caught Tyson’s eyes, saw
the question in them and the spirit or
daring. They had come in the attempt
to rescue Val Marmax, against odds.
Why not try it now? Carver winked
slightly.

A S their captors pulled at their arms,
to conduct them away, Carver
braced his feet and jerked free. Tyson
PRISON OF TIME

45

did the same and the two launched
themselves at the guards holding Helene
and Val Marmax. Carver jabbed at
the nearest satyr’s ugly face, evading
his clutching hands, and was grimly
satisfied to see him rock on his heels.
Then he swung from the floor and
knocked him cleanly off his feet—or
hooves.

  “Take that, you black—” The crack
of Tyson’s hard fist on an unprotected
chin supplied the rest. Tyson continued
to revile them, punctuating his words
with lightning jabs.

  The satyrs fought back clumsily,
crowding around. They were inordi-
nately light, despite their bull-like build,
and knew nothing of the art of fist-
fighting. Squealing and shouting, they
milled about, exposing themselves to
stiff-arm punches that made their necks
snap back.

  Carver felt a grim pleasure as his
powerful blows found their marks. Hu-
man brawn was decidedly superior to
the demon-people’s futile efforts. With
their sudden, unexpected onslaught, the
two Earthmen were able to clear the
space around Val Marmax and Helene.

  “Come on!” panted Carver. “To
that side door—” He grabbed the
girl’s arm and leaped in that direction.

  “Look out—guns!” screamed Hel-
ene.

  Some of the satyrs had drawn wicked
looking tubular weapons and were aim-
ing them. Then Sha-tahn’s bull-voice
roared out:

  “No! Take them alive!”

  Carver had not stopped running.
Just as he had figured, they would be
safe from weapons. Sha-tahn would
not kill them before he was sure the
Spot-penetration had been solved.

  The four Earth-people reached the
wide, open doorway and dashed through
into the corridor beyond. Carver had
no idea where it led to, but they must
keep their freedom and hope for a

break. When they were half way down
the hall, figures came at them from
ahead. But human figures!

  Dull-eyed, moving stiffly, they
blocked the passage. And from behind
came the sound of hooves beating
against the hard floor, in pursuit.
Caught!

  Carver peered narrowly at the men
blocking the way. Slaves of the demon-
people, they were. But they were hu-
mans behind it all. “You men!” he
barked at them. “Help us!”

  They did not answer, hardly seemed
to hear. They had the look of hypno-
tized automatons. They made no move
to clear the way. In fact, they crouched
forward menacingly.

  “Sorely you’d help us rather than
your masters!” raged Carver, but they
stared stupidly, uncomprehendingly.

  “No use!” cried Val Marmax.
“Their minds are enslaved!”

  “Then here we go through them—”
Carver lowered his head and charged,
Tyson following promptly. There were
six of them but they offered little com-
petition to .the two berserk fighters. By
the time the satyrs had come up from
the rear, their party was through.

  “Poor devils!” panted Tyson. “Hated
to hit them. Like striking dumb ani-
mals.”

  They ran fleetly down the dim hall,
with the satyrs close on their heels. A
large circular chamber opened before
them, with several cross corridors lead-
ing out again.

  A satyr stood at the wall, speaking
into one of a series of small horns set
among numerous studs and switches.
From the several corridors, at the same
time, came more of the mind-dominated
human slaves. Carver's mind, sharp-
ened by the danger they were in, clicked
with lightning inspiration. He leaped
at the lone satyr, who turned with a
snarl, and rammed his fist against his
chin with all the power of his shoulders.
46

DYNAMIC Science Stories

The satyr slumped against the wall and
sagged like a stuffed dummy, his head
lolling from a broken neck.

rT"’HEN Carver thrust his face before
the same horn into which the satyr
had been speaking. “Stop!” he yelled.
“Do not harm the Earth-people! ” Ex-
ultantly, he saw, out of the corncr of
his eye, that the men rushing at them
had obediently stopped. They were un-
der his control, through an amazing in-
strument that somehow ruled their
minds!

  Thus, when the satyrs came up, they
were met by their own slaves, in battle,
as Carver rapidly gave orders through
the horn. Tyson yelped in pure joy.
“That’s holding the fort, Barry! Now,
if we can find a way—”

  He stopped and choked.

  Carver whirled and saw something
black and tenuous around his head. One
of the astral shadows! Then three
more darted down from the roof. Car-
ver reached for a wave-gun that wasn’t
there in his belt, and then tried to beat
off the shadow that crouched down on
his head. His hands passed through the
astral shape, unhindered.

  And then he felt his brain on fire as
something dug into it with mental fin-
gers. Helene and Val Marmax stared
at him in hopelessness. They could not
fight off that which had no physical be-
ing, nor could they shake their minds
free. Carver tried, with all the will at
his command, till the sweat started out
on his brow. But the weird psychic
force threw a suffocating cloud over his
mind. He relaxed, numbly.

  Sha-tahn’s voice came to them,
through the astral contact, with the
sheer clarity of telepathy. “You have
amused me in your efforts to escape.
I’ve used the astral force as a last re-
sort. You will not escape Phoryx. Go
now. to your prison.”

  Under the dominance of the astral

force, which firmly gripped their cen-
ters otf will and locomotion, the four
captives stepped into one of the corri-
dors. Like robots they marched along,
with the black shadows perched over
their heads like incubi. Carver felt the
bitterness of defeat. He tried to step
close to Helene, touch her hand com-
fortingly, but even that was denied him.
Thoryx, he realized, was truly a—hell.

  Imprisoned together the four hu-
mans looked at one another in despair.
Val Marmax sat with his head bowed.
Tyson strode up and down, cursing un-
der his breath. Helene shuddered in
Carver’s arms. He mechanically patted
her back, but his mind was elsewhere.
It seethed tortuously with the incredi-
ble revelations of Phoryx, city of hell.

  “I can’t believe it!” he muttered.
“Have these demons been behind all the
devil-worship and mal-practice in hu-
man affairs since history began?”

  Val Marmax nodded.

  “Their science has delved deeply into
mental phenomena—telepathy, teleki-
nesis, astral projection, clairvoyance.
They were able to reach men’s minds,
even through the Spot, and play havoc
at times. The Babylonian devil-cults,
pagan religions, Medieval supernatural-
ism, your own Salem witchcraft debacle
—all were manifestations of their in-
trusion into Earth’s affairs by their psy-
chic science. The alchemists, astrol-
ogers and other pseudo-scientists often
worked under their domination. The
love-philtre, with which they bribed
Queen Elsha, is a strange formula of
theirs somehow able to upset human
emotions. Evil by nature, they can only
think of creating evil on Earth.”

“IT’S a sort of scientific explanation,”
1 mused Carver, “for all the unex-
plainable things in human history.” He
thought of something. “They’re per-
fect satyrs ox Greek mythology. What’s
PRISON OF TIME

47

the connection there?”

  “They once invaded Earth directly,”
the Atlantide admitted. “Some un-
known genius of theirs penetrated the
Spot, about three thousand years ago.
Some hundreds of them went through.
We of Shorraine attacked, blew up the
machine and its inventor with it. Those
in Earth tried to build up a great pagan
religion, but it died when they died, and
survived only as mythology.

  “But no bones of their have ever been
found,” objected Carver.

  “Their bones don’t ossify,” returned
the scientist simply. He went on. “All
other tales of vampires, ghosts, gnomes,
specters, demons, genii, and various
supernatural monsters are a result of
their astral projections roaming earth,
in strange shapes and forms.”

  “But what has been their purpose?”
puzzled Carver, trying to rationalize.
“It seems rather—pointless.”

  “Pointless?” echoed Val Marmax.
His eyes went bleak. “Shorr is a poor
world. Earth is rich. They have been
trying, all that time, to find some way
of making the astral projections gain
substance and live on Earth. Earth
alchemists and so-called necromancers
were unwittingly helping them all the
time. It follows closely some of the
actual Earth literature about demons
in another dimension. Incantations and
exorcising were an attempt to gain the
Earth dimension through strange psy-
chic-laws our science doesn’t reveal.
Luckily, it was not so easy to give their
astral projections actual Earth life. The
closest they came to it was from absorb-
ing freshly split human blood. Hence
their instigation of wars—and the in-
stitution of human sacrifice in pagan re-
ligions!”

  Carver felt stunned, nauseated.

  The Atlantide resumed. “But the
few astral projections who did gain sub-
stance died quickly, or were killed.
Here in Shorr, their method of repro-

duction is of that type—totally non-
sexual. They send out astral forms.
These wander over Shorr, absorbing the
blood of newly slain animals. Years
later they are ‘matured’—have sub-
stance. But on Earth, they have al-
ways failed, since their astral projec-
tions through the Snot were weakened.
Yet they want Earth. They would even
accept its death-cycle, because they
could increase their numbers limitlesslv
—at the expense of human lives.”

  “So our penetration of the Spot by
magnetic means falls right in line with
their plans,” muttered Carver. “They
will invade Earth—in person. They’ll
multiply, murder off humans—” He
stopped, appalled at the stark picture.

  He shook his head. “Good God! I
brought all this about! Why didn’t I
die out there on the desert—”

  “Barry!” Helene’s cool, soothing
voice cut off his half fevered recrim-
inations. “Certainly you can't be
blamed. If it’s anyone’s fault, blame
Queen Elsha!” She shuddered. “I’ll
never forget her blazing eyes, there at
the laboratory, with the demon-people
at her back. She said rather than kill
me on the spot, for stealing your love
from her, she’d let me be a slave in
Phoryx!”

  Val Marmax ground his teeth, com-
ing out of his apathetic stupor. “She’s
more evil,” he pronounced, “than Sha-
tahn himself, for betraying a whole
world!”

  “And now she’s gone back to Shor-
raine,” Tyson hissed. “In one way or
another she’ll weaken its defenses. The
demon-forces will attack. With Shor-
raine out of the way, they’ll be free to
conquer Earth. Then, with their pup-
pet dictators in power, they'll gradually
wipe out the human race! And all be-
cause of a woman!”

/^ARVER said nothing. What could
one say of a beauteous creature
48

who dared all for love? Helen of Troy,
Cleopatra, Madame DuBarry, all
faded into insignificance beside her.
History repeating itself, in the rise and
fall of empires. Only this time it might
be the final chapter in human history.
She had destroyed the most.

   But Carver couldn't forget her final
glance at him, there before the satyrs.
Nor could he interpret it. It had been
a strange mixture of yearning, promise,
even remorse.

  They felt themselves close to mad-
ness in their dark prison. It was a
dank, stone-walled room, lighted dimly
by what seemed to be cold phosphor-
escence in a ceiling globe. In its feeble
rays Carver could see that there was no
opening save the door—a solid block of
metal. He pushed against it futilely.
Barred outside.

  “We might as well be at the bottom
of a mountain,” shrugged Tyson hope-
lessly.

  Hours passed, as they waited for
death. As soon as the demon-people
had made a successful Spot-penetra-
tion, they would come to kill them.
Carver too, despite Sha-tahn’s mock-
ing promise to Queen Elsha. Carver
laughed hollowly at the thought. What
a joke on her!

  A sound came from the other side
of the metal door. They were here
now, to kill them! But strangely, the
sound was a dull hiss, like the bite of
a heat-beam. A spot in the metal door
glowed cherry red and finally broke
through. Lock mechanisms jangled
apart.

  Carver sprang forward and shoved
at the ponderous door. It swung open
and in it was framed—Queen Elsha!
Back of her, in the corridor, lay two
satyrs, guards whose gaping wounds
still smoked.

   With the opening of the door, a rush
of sound had filled the sealed room.

Sounds from outside and above—dull
boomings and the crackle of unleashed
forces.

  “Battle!” shouted Tyson. “Above
the city—”

  “Yes, battle!” cried the Queen of
Mu, above the bedlam. “Shorraine has
attacked. You can escape, in the ex-
citement. Follow me—to my ship!”

  Quickly, she handed them each a
beam-pistol. Carver stared at her a
moment, wonderingly, then took the
lead. A black figure appeared at the
end of the corridor. Carver fired.
Though he had tried the pistols before,
in practice, he was amazed at the pow-
erful charge of infra-heat that blasted
into the satyr, charring half his body.

  Obviously, excitement reigned in
Phoryx. Black figures darted down the
corridors, not even noticing them.
Those that did, and turned, met the
harsh blast of heat from Carver’s ready
gun.

  “Up these stairs!” shrilled Queen
Elsha. At the head, Carver felt the
sinister hum of telekinetic forces past
his ear. He rayed a demoniac black
face, but another appeared, aiming
straight at him with his tubular weapon.
A soft hiss from Helene’s gun, at his
side, charred the black hand that
threatened Carver. Tyson’s gun spoke
from the rear, as a satyr charged up
from that direction.

  They had gained the roof, then.
Three satyrs, peering in the sky, had
no chance as five beam-guns belched at
once. Queen Elsha’s ship lay close by
and they ran for it.

1 OOKING up, Carver wondered how
■*—1 they would get free of the ele-
mental furies being hurled about there.
A hundred flat-decked ships of Shor-
raine, widely separated, were pouring
down a hell of withering rays whose
touch turned metal to water. Atomic-
bombs, plummeted down, blasting
PRISON OF TIME

49

buildings and filling the crooked streets
with jagged debris.

  Up from the city, in turn, stabbed
equally powerful heat-beams and the
humming, invisible telekinetic forces.
The surprise of the attack was over.
Ship after ship blossomed into flame, or
ripped apart and dropped like a stone.
It was vicious aerial warfare such as
Carver had never seen on Earth.

  “Hurry!” screeched Queen Elsha.
She grabbed Helene’s hand and pulled
h?r to the deck. Carver lifted Val Mar-
max bodily as the portly scientist stum-
bled.

  Tyson was already at the controls.
As the ship rose, three satyrs rushed
from below, firing. A section of the
deck-rail next to Carver splintered and
whirled off. Carver, aiming deliberate-
ly, picked off two. The third crumpled
as the gun in Queen Elsha’s hand spoke.

  Tyson yelled a warning to hang on
and the ship rocketed up in a wide,
weaving arc. Guns roared below them.
How many times a heat-beam or tele-
kinetic blast slashed near them they did
not know. But at last they were high
out of range. Below, the few remaining
Shorraine ships kept up their grim at-
tack. Black, round ships now arose
from another part of the city, to give
chase, but Tyson grinned in derision as
he set a straight, swift course for Shor-
raine. They had enough of a head start
to be safe.

  “Saved!” breathed Helene. Phoryx,
city of demons, dwindled rapidly. They
had all crowded together behind the
wind-breaker at the prow.

  “I guess that’s the word,” agreed
Carver, looking at Queen Elsha. “And
I think we have you to thank, Elsha!”

  The Queen of Mu seemed suddenly
drained of strength. She leaned weak-
ly against the bulwark, her face pale
and wan behind its rich olive tint.
Carver put an arm around her shoul-
ders, steadying her. He could feel her

tremble at the touch.

  “I have in part—atoned!” she said.
Her dark, lidded eyes reflected a calm
joy. “I fooled Sha-tahn. Back there
in his chamber, when he offered me an-
other chance, I took it. But only as a
chance to save you, Barry, and Val
Marmax!”

  Carver knew now what her final
glance to him had said—“Trust me!”
He felt shame inside of him, for having
doubted her.

  The Queen of Mu went on. “Back
in Shorraine, I went immediately to the
Five, told them the story. They
thought it another trick at first, but I
convinced them. A fleet of a hundred
armed ships, Shorraine’s standing force,
was sent to the attack. But I went
first, ahead of them.

  “My plan worked. I landed and
gave Sha-tahn the ‘warning’ that Shor-
raine was attacking, still playing the
part of his ally. He did not think to use
an astral-prober, in the excitement.
Thus, as they set about hurriedly U»
prepare defenses against the surprise at-
tack, they did not watch me. When the
battle started, I made my way to your
prison—the rest you know.”

CHE drew her breath in a half sob.

   betraying the strain she had been
under when any false move would have
meant failure, and death.

  “Suicide squad!” murmured Carver,
thinking of the brave men going to cer-
tain doom. He looked searchingly at
the queen. “And you, Elsha—regard-
less of what you did before, you risked
your life to save ours—”

  “It wasn’t just your lives!” she cried,
a little angrily. “I was thinking of
Earth. With Val Marmax in their
hands, the demon-people had the secret
of Spot-penetration for themselves.
They could invade Earth, with Shor-
raine helpless to interfere. That was
the issue at stake, burning in my mind
50

—” Then suddenly her voice changed.
“Oh, Barry, I did it just for you—to

save you! ”

  She looked up into his face, standing
close. “Kiss me, Barry!” she de-
manded.

  Carver stared, startled. Was she still
playing a game, serving her own de-
sires? Hoping to win him by what she
had done? Confused, he glanced at
Helene and was more perplexed to see
her nodding slowly, almost command-
ingly. He had not seen the glances be-
tween the women, nor would he, a man,
have understood the signal exchanged.

  He bent to kiss the Queen of Mu.
Her lips touched his burningly. For a
moment they stood together, the man
and woman of ages twelve thousand
years apart. Then she broke away.
“Our first kiss,” she murmured, “and
last!”

  She moved back. Carver did not
realize what she was up to till she
stood at the edge of the deck where the
railing was torn out. Her raven hair
blowing in the head wind, she looked
at them all, smiling quietly. Then she
leaned backward.

  Carver sprang forward with a hoarse
cry, but it was too late. Her white-
robed body tumbled from the ship,
turning over and over as it plunged to
the ground, three thousand feet below.
Carver turned away, sickened.

  A gasp of horror had come from the
others. “It was the only thing she could
do,” said Val Marmax then. “Death
with honor. Her sentence later, for her
original crime of betrayal, would have
been death anyway.”

  Tyson grunted. “She had nerve, if
nothing else.”

  Helene was weeping softly. “Bar-
ry,” she whispered, “let’s think kindly
of her. She loved—and lost!”

  Carver nodded slowly. His memory
of her would be kind. She seemed puri-
fied by her last act. For one hour she

had been noble, sincere, self-sacrificing,
so that he could forget what she had
been for twelve thousand years. They
were all silent for the rest of the jour-
ney, thinking of the Queen of ancient
Mu.

  The slim graceful spires of Shorraine
brought a surge of joy to Carver’s
pulses after the oppressive sojourn in
dark, evil Phoryx. A hum of activity
rose from the great city, as it prepared
for the coming struggle with its age-old
enemy. On factory roof-tops, men
swarmed about rows of ships, outfitting
them for wartime pursuits. Along the
city wall’s broad lip, giant anti-aircraft
guns were being wheeled into position,
against the event of attack.

  Carver went directly to the Five,
with his party. They were in a large
room outfitted with hundreds of flash-
ing television screens, directing the citv-
wide preparations. But they came for-
ward with eager smiles of greeting.

  “You have succeeded in bringing
back Val Marmax,” said the spokes-
man. “Barry Carver, you have done
Shorraine—and Earth—a great serv-
ice!”

  “But only with the help of Queen El-
sha,” Carver went on to give the details,
briefly.

' I 'HE Atlantides bowed their heads si-

 *	lently for a moment, at news of her
death. “It is not for us to judge her.”
murmured one. He looked up. “But
now, other problems confront us.”

  “Yes,” said Carver grimly. “If the
demon-people have the right Spot-pene-
tration data, they’ll apply it as quickly
as they can. Earth is menaced. How-
soon can we attack in full force?”

  “Our facilities have been geared to
full capacity,” responded the Atlantide.
“Turning out guns and mounting them
on all ships available. All of Shorraine
works on the project, with a will. One-
third of our forces will be ready tomor-
PRISON OF TIME

51

row, one-third the next, and the next.”

  “Then we’ll attack tomorrow,” de-
clared Carver. He hesitated. “Who
will lead Shorraine’s forces?”

  “You, of course,” said the Atlantide
matter-of-factly. “We had already de-
cided that, if you returned, after we had
looked over your plans for a fleet to en-
ter the Earth warfare. You and Tyson
are most versed in aerial battle. Tyson
will be your second-in-command. Do
you accept?”

  The two young men looked at each
other. “We do!” Tyson tried to say
casually, but it was close to a shout.

  Carver turned to Val Marmax. “In
the meantime, you will work out the
Spot-penetrator units and have the fac-
tories turn them out, as we originally
planned.” Despite the coming war
within Shorraine, Carver still thought of
the outside war, and the Jap army he
hoped yet to stop. The Earth war was
larger in scope, more slow. The war in
Shorraine promised to be swift, and
deadly.

  “I’ll have some of the units ready in
a few days, and will equip all the ships
within two weeks,” promised Val Mar-
max.

  “One other thing,” said Carver.
‘‘Have a ship sent out to pick up Queen
Elsha’s body. She ought to be given a
decent burial.”

  The Atlantide nodded. “It will be
done. Her people of Mu will give her
burial in their ancient ceremonial man-
ner.”

  The next morning, as dawn cast a
crimson glow over the dark lands of
Shorr, the first fleet of Shorraine
hummed into the sky, bound on its grim
mission.

  The flagship rode at the van of 4,000
ships, in rows of ten. Carver looked
back at the mighty armada. Concen-
trated destruction was at his command,
more than any other leader in history
had ever had. He thrilled at the

thought. But the enemy was strong.
How strong he had yet to find out.

  But how queer to think of the men in
back of him—men from all times and
lands united in this venture. There
were Egyptians who had fought wild
barbarians before Europe was civilized;
Indians and Chinese whose dynasties
had once been supreme; Persians who
had quailed before Alexander’s con-
quest; Romans who had stood in their
solid phalanxes; knights who had once
jousted and shivered lances; merce-
naries who had marched in Napoleon's
Grande Amice. All alive here, by the .
queer timelessness of Shorr, to fight to-
gether now with the superweapons of
Atlantean science.

  Did he have a unified fighting force,
so important in warfare? Carver was
sure he had. He had addressed them
all before the departure. They had
cheered lustily. Regardless of origins
and times, the demon-people were a
common enemy. Satan, and all his dark
astral forces, had plagued mankind
from the beginning. And now, when
they might soon ravage out into th<*
world, they must be stopped. Carver
knew this burning thought was in every
man’s breast. They would fight as
they had never fought before.

“ETROM what I’ve heard,” said Ty-

 *	son, also sweeping his eyes over the
fleet enthusiastically, “this war to the
finish, with Phoryx, has been building
up for all the twelve thousand years of
Shorraine’s existence. It just needed an
event like the Spot-penetration to light
the spark. Barry, this is history!”

  Carver’s lips tightened as the dark
outline of Phoryx climbed the horizon.
The enemy did not send out a fleet,
though they must know of the attack,
through scouts. Strategy, perhaps—
letting the city’s defenses protect itself
and saving the fleet for later, when
Shorraine’s forces were weakened. All
52

DYNAMIC Science Stories

right, thought Carver, it would work
both ways. The sooner the city was de-
stroyed, the better.

   Two miles in the air, just as the edge
of the sprawling mass, Carver barked
into his microphone. Radio carried his
commands to all the ships. The fleet
spread out in a long, curving formation,
ten deep, and dived for the city. The
anti - aircraft guns below suddenly
awoke. Flame belched into the sky.
One ship’s prow sagged and then the
metal burned like paper. Another ship
split in half as the ravening telekinetic
force blew a hole through it.

  The battle was on!

   Carver’s fleet, at his orders, blasted
out with their heat-beams at the bottom
of a sweeping trajectory, raking over
the nearest line of towers. The hellish
force of atomic-energy toppled three of
them. Molten metal dripped to the
streets. The last line of ships, bombers,
dropped their deadly loads. With ter-
rific roars that seemed to shake the
whole universe, the atomic-bombs con-
verted their targets to twisted, smoking
ruins. Titanic destruction!

  Yet at the top of their swooping
climb, when the fleet reorganized its
formation. Carver looked below and
saw that the damage was tiny compared
to the city’s extent. And he had lost six
ships. It would be a long, costly
job. . . .

  The fleet of Shorraine dived, again—
and again. Hours passed while holo-
caustic energies were hurled between
the belligerents. At times, tired of just
watching, Carver took the place of one
of his ship’s gunners. He took satisfac-
tion in running a heat-beam down the
face of a building and splitting it open
like a pod. Now and then he saw tiny
satyr figures running about madly,
though most of the buildings had prob-
ably been evacuated.

  When night fell, Carver called a
halt. He looked below. A charred

wedge had been added to the darksome
city, but how much remained to be
done! And he had lost 500 ships.

  “They won’t surrender, of course,”
Tyson said. “We’ll just have to batter
the whole city down—if we last!”
“Yes, I’m wondering myself,” Carver
muttered. “But it’s all we can do. This
is a war of extermination!”

  On the second and third days, Barry
Carver led out successively greater
fleets. He smashed at Phoryx from five
different points, working inward. The
black cancer of their annihilation crept
steadily forward.

  “They haven’t sent one ship up
against us,” Carver mused thoughtfully
at the end of the third day. “That
means they are confident of Spot-pene-
tration and don’t care about the city.
They are saving their ships for—Earth!
I don’t think we can destroy the city
fast enough to stop them. We’ve got to
get control of their Spot!”

  “And that’s just where they’ll have
their main forces concentrated,” Tyson
returned dubiously.

  “We’ll have to try,” Carver ground
out.

I_IE sought out Val Marmax. The

  *	scientist, with a staff of helpers,
was busily adjusting a battery of robot
machinery.

  “How soon will you have the first
units ready?” Carver demanded.

  “In two days.”

  “No sooner?” grunted Carver. “W^
must gain control of their Spot, on bT./i
sides. When our first ships go out, we
can send them to the Earth-side of their
Spot—bottle them up. In the mean-
time, we’ll try blocking them on this
side.”

  The attack the next day, concen-
trated at Phoryx’s city-gates, ran into
full resistance from the enemy, true to
Tyson’s prediction. Anti-aircraft guns
sent up a terrific barrage that downed
PRISON OF TIME

53

Shorraine’s ships like falling leaves.
And for the first time, the demon-peo-
ple’s black, circular ships rose to battle.

  Obviously, the enemy was deter-
mined to hold its Spot. Just as deter-
minedly, Carver hurled his forces at
them relentlessly, hoping to smash
through. He didn’t.

  And late in the day, when the aerial
battle had been carried high, he saw a
line of ships sail low and straight for
the Spot.

  “They’re going through!” gasped

Tyson.

  The first ship had faded suddenly,
entering the area of the Spot enclosed
by the great gates. It became a dim
shadow and then winked out entirely, as
though it had been swallowed up in thin
air. One after another, the rest fol-
lowed. Carver counted more than a
hundred.

  Tyson looked around soberly. “They
beat us to it, Barry. They had a day’s
start on Val Marmax, since he had to
start all over devising the unit, on pa-
per, when he got back to Shorraine.
They have the same robot machinery.
They beat us to it!”

  Carver groaned. “And tomorrow—”

  When they sent out their first test
ship through the Spot, the next day, it
came back hurriedly, with half its prow
shattered. The enemy waited out there.

  “They have us bottled up!” muttered
Tyson. “We can send out only one
ship at a time. Suicide!”

  “The battle has to be finished here
in Shorr!” Val Marmax stated sol-
emnly. He went on croakingly. “And
they will outlast us. They are stronger
numerically. They can draw recruits
from outlying settlements of theirs. We
of Shorraine—are limited!”

  Gloom settled over them at this in-
escapable fact. Carver’s mind strove
for a way out. It was the old axiom of
warfare, in a dragged out struggle—

manpower was the deciding factor.
Lacking that, what could Shorraine do
to swing the tide? They had already
lost two thousand ships and twenty
thousand men. In another week, their
drained manpower would leave Shor-
raine easy prey to attack. The shadow
of doom lay over them like a blight.

  Carver turned to Tyson and suddenly
asked a queer question. “Have you
still got your old flying togs?”

  “Yes,” Tyson said, surprised. “I put
them away carefully when I came to
Shorraine. Sentimental, I guess. Why?”

“V/’OU’RE going to wear them,”
*■ stated Carver, eyes narrowed.
“And I am going to wear mine. To-
night a ship is going to secretly land
us outside Phoryx’s gates. Tomorrow
morning, we’ll enter Phoryx—as wan-
derers from Earth!”

  “I see!” gasped Tyson, at the daring
plan. “But what can we do—”

  “WTiat any other spy or sabotage
agent does in the enemy’s camp,” said
Carver grimly. “Work for their down-
fall.” He whirled on Val Marmax.
“That apparatus with the speaking
tubes, that we saw—do you think it
might control all the enslaved Eartli-
people in Phoryx?”

  “It likely does!” cried the scientist,
a flash of understanding in his eyes.
“It would correspond to a telepathic
central switchboard. There are about
20,000 human souls in Phoryx, under
that domination. If they were freed—”
“BarryI’V'”.Ielene threw her arms
around Carver’s neck. “You can’t go
back there. I can’t let you. I can’t!”
She clung to him tightly.

  Carver spoke gently. “This may
hurt, dear, but suppose your father were
one of them. He was lost in the desert,
too. I have a chance to free these peo-
ple and help Shorraine at the same time,
don’t you see?”

  The girl fell back, her face wild.
54

DYNAMIC Science Stories

Then she gripped herself and nodded.
“Go, Barry!” she breathed.

  Shivering in the cold night breeze,
Carver and Tyson watched as a crimson
dawn splashed over the wild terrain of
Shorr. They crouched beneath Phoryx’s
great gates, where they had been landed
an hour previously by a silent, dark
ship. In their Earthly uniforms of air-
men, they looked the part of men who
had just wandered into the Spot from
the Sahara Desert. Their faces had
been disguised, by skilled touches of
cosmetics.

  “We’ll have to wait at least two
hours,” whispered Carver. “We’re
supposed to have seen Phoryx as a
mirage, and mirages don’t appear too
early in the morning.”

  Tyson nodded, his teeth chattering,
though not from fright. Both of them
were calm. It was a desperate game
they were playing, but it offered one
chance of bursting the prison bars of
doom around themselves and all Shor-
raine.

  They heard the busy hum of the city,
this evil, powerful city which would
soon be master of two worlds if fate so
willed. Along the curve of the wall,
they could see pacing sentries, black
satyrs whose hooves clattered loudly on
stone. At times they saw scurrying hu-
man figures, carrying burdens, doing the
bidding of their cruel masters. Carver
dug his nails into his own palm. Such
would be the lot of all humans if the
demon-people won.

  High overhead a black ship circled,
watching for attack from Shorraine. It
would come soon. Carver had arranged
for the attack at about that time. The
subsequent excitement in Phoryx would
increase the two men’s chances of ac-
complishing something without being
too closely watched.

   But before Shorraine’s forces arrived,
the huge gates suddenly swung wide.

Carver could peer in at an angle. A
line of ships darted from the large build-
ing which was Sha-tahn’s central head-
quarters. Carver gasped. Standing
stiffly at the deck of the first ship was
that familiar figure, with the lick of
black hair over his forehead, and the
small mustache. Beside him stood the
short, squat yellow man, cheek scarred,
lips cruel. Hitler and Genghis Kahn,
two of history’s most ruthless conquer-
ers, and under the domination of a yet
more evil nature—Sha-tahn!

' I 'HE ship winked out before their
eyes, as it entered the area of the
Spot. It continued as a ghostly shadow,
on into the Earth dimension. One by
one, the others followed.

  “Another hundred!” hissed Tyson.
“And evidently these are being sent out
into the world already. Sha-tahn is
confident of victory here in Shorr!”
“Let’s go!” said Carver.

  They straightened up, hugged the
wall till they came to the Spot area,
and then boldly walked through it, into
Phoryx. They simulated attitudes of
astonishment and fearful wonder, twist-
ing their heads around.

  A satyr came running up. “You are
from the Sahara Desert?” he asked in
perfect English.

  Carver and Tyson nodded word-
lessly, as though too astounded to
speak. They tried to show as much of
stark fear as they could, putting them-
selves in the place of men who saw all
this for the first time.

  “You are in Phoryx, city of Shorr,
which is another world,” explained the
satyr briefly. “You cannot escape. You
will not lie harmed if you do as we say.
Come with me!”

  The two Earthmen stepped forward,
as though too mentally numbed to re-
monstrate. The satyr walked at their
side, watchfully, with a hand on the
butt of his gun. It was evidently the
PRISON OF TIME

55

usual method of introducing newcom-
ers to Phoryx, terse and abrupt, with-
out giving them time to think or object.
Carver was grimly satisfied to note that
they were heading for the great, tow-
ered building just opposite the gate,
which he knew from the last time to be
Sha-tahn’s headquarters.

  The satyr motioned toward a door
and herded them down the dim-lit cor-
ridors. What were they being led to?
Carver tried to orient himself in the
building. Vaguely, he knew that the
telepathy-control room was off the
ground level and toward the rear. Some-
how or other they must get there.

  Finally they were taken into a large
room. Against one wall stood a large
apparatus of indefinable purpose. Two
other satyrs looked up, spoke a few
words with their captor, and then
turned to the machine. Moving levers
brought it to humming life. The first
satyr motioned to a flat wide bench that
lay under a frosty globe.

  “One of you will lie down there,” he
commanded.

  “What do you mean to do?” asked
Carver, in false terror, playing his part.
At the same time he did want to know
what the machine was for. “What is
this all about? What—” He stopped,
swallowing.

  The satyr leered evilly, obviously
taking their bewildered discomfiture as
real, and enjoying it.

  “You will be in Phoryx a long time,”
he promised, licking his lips as though
he relished telling this. “But as
slaves! You cannot escape it. Be
warned that this gun I have”—he drew
it—“can blast you to instant death, if
you resist. Under the machine, an
astral-force will penetrate your brain
and lodge in the cortex, center of will,
suppressing it. After that you will
obey all commands, by word or tel-
epathy, without the slightest power to
resist. Now you, the big one, get on

that bench. Or if you choose to die,
attack me. We are not so much in need
of slaves anymore, as soon we will have
all Earth to pick from. Well?”

  Carver glanced at Tyson. Once un-
der the apparatus, they were lost. They
would be mindless, bereft of will, flesh
and blood robots. But on the other
hand, they were menaced by a gun
whose telekinetic forces they knew
only too well as a blasting death.

  Carver tensed. It was do or die. The
satyr brought up his gun sharply.

CUDDENLY a loud bell clanged in
^ the corridor, and echoed from sev-
eral other directions. Carver knew it
must be the general alarm, that Shor-
raine’s forces were attacking. At the
sound of the bell, the satyrs had invol-
untarily looked around. And at that
moment, the two Earthmen leaped.

  Carver caught the satyr with the gun
in a flying tackle that knocked him off
his feet and sent his weapon clattering
against the wall. The Satyr struggled
wildly, kicking with his hard hooves
and curling his prehensile tail around
Carver’s waist. Carver wasted as little
time as possible. He grasped the crea-
ture’s neck and banged his head against
the floor with all the force of his earthly
muscles. The satyr went limp, his skull
crushed.

  Carver sprang np, whirling. Tyson,
cursing, was battering away with his
fists at one satyr. The other was leap-
ing for the door. Carver grabbed up
the weapon in the corner and stabbed at
the side button. The gun gave a little
kick. The satyr, with a choked scream,
went down. The telekinetic charge
had torn his throat out. Tysen
knocked his adversary with a final up-
percut.

  Carver stepped to the door and
looked cautiously down the hall. Al-
though several satyrs passed in various
cross passages, none seemed to notice
56

DYNAMIC Science Stories

what had occurred in the room.

  “The attack came just in time, for
us,” panted Tyson.

  “Now’s our chance, in all this hub-
bub,” said Carver rapidly. “If we can
find that telepathy room. Let’s go. We
can walk along the halls as though we
were human slaves of theirs, on some
errand.” He stuck the gun in his belt.

  It seemed hours that they wandered
through the huge building, though they
knew it was only minutes. Minutes
that were tense, nerve-wracking. At
any moment they might be challenged,
apprehended. But luckily because of
the bustle of the attack, the satyrs who
passed barely glanced at them. The
two Earthmen shuffled along with heads
half bowed, like the mind-slaves of Pho-
ryx.

  They ascended steps and worked
their way upward. Somewhere up here
must be their destination. Tyson
grunted suddenly. “This looks famil-
iar. Yes, this is the hall leading to Sha-
tahn’s chamber! The next cross cor-
ridor must lead to where we were
trapped last time—”

  “You’re right!” Carver headed
down the hall, knowing the way now.

  Soon they came within sight of the
central room with its many branching
corridors. From here, evidently,
groups of human slaves were assigned
to various duties, guided by telepathic
commands. Standing against the wall,
Carver could see five satyrs in the room,
giving their commands into the row of
horns.

  “Five—and all armed!” said Carver
grimly, moving forward with his gun in
hand.

  “Wait!” hissed Tyson. “Satyr com-
ing down the hall.”

  He hurried up, glancing at them, but
without suspicion. As he went by, Car-
ver deliberately aimed his weapon. The
humming charge cracked the side of his
head open. Almost before the body had

fallen, Carver jerked his gun from its
holster and handed it to Tyson.

  Then, tight-lipped, they crept to the
central room.

  One of the satyrs, turning, looked
them full in the face as they reached
the doorway. He shouted hoarsely,
pulling out his gun. He fell, his chest
torn, as Carver’s gun spat viciously.
The other four whirled, jerking at their
weapons. Two more went down, as the
Earthmen fired together. Carver
ducked, as a gun swung at him, but felt
his left arm go limp as the charge ripped
into his shoulder. His return shot was
more accurate, and the one remaining
satyr died with a strangled gasp as Ty-
son fired.

' I 'HEY had done it! Carver told

 *	himself that with a surge of tri-
umph. Now if only the rest would
work out as he hoped, and wanted. His
lips twisted with the pain of his shat-
tered shoulder, but that could wait.

  “Quick!” he barked to Tyson. “Close
the doors. Lock them if you can. Then
keep watch. Keep them out for the
next five minutes, come heaven or hell,
while I—”

  He stepped before the wall appara-
tus, looking it over with keen, search-
ing eyes. Under each horn was a series
of studs, some pressed down. That
must be the “on” position. Rapidly he
went down the rowr, shoving all the
studs down. A deep, rising hum came
from behind the panel. Telepathic
forces of some sort, broadcast through
all the city! Attuned in some intricate
way to the will-less minds of Phoryx’s
human slaves! Wild conjecture? No,
he must be right—he must!

  Carver stepped back, drawing a
breath. Then he yelled out:

  “Slaves, attention! You are free.
Arise against your hated masters.
Wherever you are, whatever you are
doing, arise—and kill your masters!”
PRISON OF TIME

57

  Carver stopped. “Tom,” he said fer-
vently, in lower tones, “if you ever
prayed before, pray now, that this
works! ”

  Carver repeated the message. Was
his voice, translated to telepathic im-
pulses by the machine, impinging in ev-
ery human slave-brain in Phoryx? Were
they straightened up, released from
a previous command—free and seeth-
ing with vengeance? Some of the peo-
ple must have been here thousands of
years. How strong must be their ha-
tred against the satyrs!

  Carver forced himself to think more
rationally. How much could they do
before the satyrs finally destroyed them
all? If just enough pandemonium and
chaos could be created to let the attack-
ing forces of Shorraine get a foothold,
a vantage—

  Carver barked out again, stentorian-
ly:

  “Slaves of Phoryx! Arise and kill
your masters. Take all weapons you
can. Those of you near anti-aircraft
guns, take them over. Do not shoot the
ships of Shorraine. Blast those of Pho-
rox. Those of you near the Spot area
converge on the defenses at that point.
Take over all guns and positions you
can. Shoot down the ships of Phorox.
Fight, slaves, fight—for freedom. And
for Earth!”

  “Here they come!” cried Tyson. The
doors which he had closed and locked
by a bolt mechanism rang with repe£tted
blows. Blasts of telekinetic force
ripped out gaping holes.

  Carver aimed his gun at the tele-
pathy-machine’s panel and swept its
charge down the line, Wasting out the
studs one by one. His last command
to the mind-slaves would be the last
they would hear for a time to come.
Back of the panel, the throbbing ceased
as connections broke.

  Then Carver turned, waiting calmly
for the demon-people to blast their way

  in. There was no chance of escape this
time. He only wished he could know,
before he went, whether success had re-
warded his efforts.

  Suddenly a wall screen spangled into
a television view. Sha-tahn’s dark, evil
face peered out at the two besieged
Earthmen. He leered satanically, as
Earth mythology represented his astral
alter ego.

  “As I thought,” he spoke, peering
sharply. “Barry Carver, despite the
disguise. You will die for what you
have done—horribly. Not by gun, no.”
He gave a command at the side, then
turned back. “No. You shall suffer
slowly, for weeks, perhaps months. A
little astral being will perch in your
brain and keep screaming, screaming,
till you go mad. But then it will keep
on!”

' I 'HE noises outside the door ceased.

 ■■■ And down from the ceiling darted
a black shadow. Carver knew there
was no use running. The shadow en-
veloped his head, probed with its psy-
chic forces, and a faint scream sound-
ed within Carver’s brain. It kept on
steadily. Carver knew it would drive
him mad, but before them he would—

  He gasped. He tried to raise his gun
to his own temple, but some force pre-
vented him. He could not will his own
death!

  “You see?” snarled Sha-tahn. “You
will suffer, and—”

  At that moment, shouts sounded.
Strange wild shouts that seemed to
come from all directions. Human
shouts! Sha-tahn’s face vanished from
the screen, with a startled look upon it.
At the same time, the astral tormenter
over Carver’s head disappeared.

  Tyson had sprung to the door, look-
ing out of a gaping rent.

“The slaves!” he shouted, joyfully.
“They’re out in the hall, fighting the
58

DYNAMIC Science Stories

satyrs. Barry, it worked—”

  Carver leaped for the door, opened
it. The satyrs were backed against the
wall, shooting it out with a party of men
swarming down the corridor. It was
over in a moment and with blood-
curdling screams of triumph the Earth-
people surged toward Sha-tahn’s room.

  “Let’s get in on that!” cried Carver.
He was only partially aware of the
blood dripping down his sleeve, from
his torn shoulder. He and Tyson were
with the party when it swarmed into
Sha-tahn’s presence. A withering bar-
rage of gun-fire met them. But the rest
crowded forward eagerly, madly,
screaming revenge. Carver realized
that very few of them were sane. He
had loosed a pack of demented mon-
sters among the demon-people, who
had made them so. Somehow, it was
divine justice.

  Sha-tahn’s party retreated. Then
piercing cries from the back of them
and they were trapped between two
fires. In desperation, they made a
break for it, past Carver’s party. Some-
how, Sha-tahn was there across sights.
He pressed, and watched the ruler of
Phoryx fall, a corpse.

  Carver was in a daze. His shoidder
pained agonizingly. Was it possible
that he had just killed the monster who
for thousands of years had worked his
way into Earth history as—Satan?
Was this all a mad dream? He was so
confused, and so weak. It couldn’t be
true. It was all a terrible, impossible
dream. And then a tidal wave of dark-
ness swept him off his feet. . . .

DARRY CARVER stood at the prow
of the sleek ship as it rose grace-
fully over Shorraine. He had one arm
around Helene. The other was in a
sling. His shoulder wound had nearly
healed.

  They had told him later of the full
destruction of Phoryx, after his delir-

  ium and fever were gone. How the up-
rising Earth slaves, obeying his tele-
pathic commands to the letter, had de-
moralized Phoryx’s fighting forces.
They had stormed every position,
wrested away guns, shot down the
demon-people’s ships. Shorraine’s aer-
ial forces had been able to land within
the city and take over more guns. Be-
fore the end of that day, the.enemy was
isolated in various sections, besieged.
Most of their great fleet was destroyed.

  In three more days, the city had been
practically leveled. Those of the satyrs
still alive had raced to the dark lands.
Their power was broken.

/'"'’ARVER’S ship, piloted by Tom
^— Tyson, maneuvered into the Spot.
At its nose, a magnetic machine
thrummed powerfully. They felt a
slight wrench, no more. The bluish
light around them gradually faded into
a soft yellow glare. It brightened to
tropical harshness as the sands of the
Sahara spread to all directions.

  Earth! Carver took a deep, satisfied
breath.

  He looked back. One after one,
ships followed. The line began to
stretch out like a string of beads, over
the hot desert. Five thousands ships
were his to command. Armed ships, su-
perior to any fighting force of Earth.
Carver thought of the Jap army and
gripned slowly, in anticipation.

  He looked further back, at the danc-
ing, shimmering image of a ghostly city
suspended over the rolling sands. Shor-
raine—City of the Mirage! It had been
the scene of incredible adventure, fan-
tastic from start to finish. He would
never forget a minute of it. Nor would
time mist his memory of the enigmatic,
lovely creature who, unwittingly, had
assured the destruction of Phoryx.

  The ship sailed on, into the wide
skies of Earth. On its prow was
the legend: “Elsha—Queen of Mu.”

worth only its little weight in gold. It
wouldn’t get me a job, and I wanted a
job—and Marjorie.

  Just the thought of Marjorie made
me feel all moonlighty and spiritual in-
stead of two hundred pounds an'd red-
headed and blocky-jawed. With her in
my mind, I could forget that I owed a
60

DYNAMIC Science Stories

year’s tuition, and that Coach Lou Little
had told me for three autumns straight
that I was the most exasperating var-
sity tackle he’d ever failed to teach
football rudiments, and that I’d have
to wear a cap and gown in tomorrow’s
heat, and that I was only Sam Sterrett
of the truck-driving Sterretts, and that
Marjorie’s dad—J. Barton Cannon of
the Wall Street Cannons—had prom-
ised to skin me alive if I didn’t leave
his daughter alone. I almost forgot my
invention, the one thing I had to show
for four years of hard grubbing at elec-
tro-physics.

DUT I couldn’t forget that, because
it lay on the dressing table in my
little room in John Jay Hall. Or, rather,
they lay, because there were two of
them. Two little bits of clear glass,
about the shape and size of acorn cups.
Not perfect, I knew, but a step in a new
direction.

  The idea—I’d better explain in the
beginning—came to me in high school.
I saw how glass could modify and mix
light; a prism broke it up into the spec-
trum, a lens focussed it to a point of
heat, a mirror flashed it back at an an-
gle, a flaw distorted it, and so on. That
year, for the first time I’d read under-
standing^ about X-rays. I began to
dream, then to plan, something that
would do away with all the mechanical
fuss and cumber—a simple glass modi-
fier, that would absorb instead of giv-
ing off the rays, would be a lens instead
of a reflector, would, in short, achieve
the transparency without use of power,
artificial light or a shopful of accesso-
ries.

  And now, after four years at the uni-
versity, I had this to show, this pair
of crystal shells that came to the prob-
lem’s fringe but no closer.

  I picked up one. I had made it like
those little spectacle-things that fit right
over the eyeball. Though almost as

thin as paper, it contained five distinct
layers. Between two of these was a tiny
vacuum chamber, with microscopic X-
ray devices—cathode, anode and anti-
cathode—but made, I say, to absorb
and not to produce. No induction coil,
but certain metals that, fused properly
in the glass, supplied power enough . . .
never mind which metals, that’s my se-
cret. ... I dipped the shell into a cru-
cible of boric acid solution, then spread
apart the lids of my right eye and let it
snick into place there. Colorless, snug,
it would be almost completely unnotice-
able. Then I dipped the other shell and
fitted it to my left eye.

  This was my first try of the complete
lenses and, though my early experi-
ments had prepared me pretty well, I
gloomed all over again. When I looked
at my fingers, they were just fingers—
healthy, meaty, freckled—not a shad-
owy rind with bones showing through,
as in a real X-ray. The device was only
half effective, couldn’t see through liv-
ing organic tissue, only thin layers of
inanimate non-minerals.

  Gazing at a cardboard box on the
dresser, I felt a little better. Through
the lid I could make out my shirt studs,
my cuff links, and the medal 1 won for
winning the discus throw. I had
achieved the beginnings of success,
maybe enough to build on for perfec-
tion. Meanwhile, I’d better hustle over
to Riverside Drive. This was the after-
noon that Marjorie had promised to slip
away from her swagger college upstate
and see me. That college was run like
a girl’s reformatory, but in the last
month we’d been able to meet twice,
through the help of Miss Wheatland,
a new substitute instructor. She’d
helped Marjorie to slip away. I thanked
heaven that one teacher, at least, had
a heart. So I left John Jay, still wear-
ing my lenses; I planned to amuse the
ladies by counting the coins in their
purses and so on.
INSIGHT

61

  Heading for Grant’s Tomb, where
Marjorie would be waiting, I treed to
figure some profit out of the gadgets.
My best chance would be a sort of
mind-reading stunt in a theater, and I’d
never dare try—I’m not the mental type
as far as looks go, and I’m prone to get
stage fright, anyway. All wrapped up
in thoughts like that, I took no notice
of anybody or anything. I was almost
run over by cars, buses, people. At last
I reached the Tomb, and Marjorie
came around the corner of it toward
me.

  Of course, I always look at Marjorie.
So I looked, hard, and I was within an
inch of fainting.

  There she stood smiling, my dream
girl, the one I yearned to marry, with-
out a stitch, on! Every curve of her,
every pink inch, from her fluffy blonde
pate to her manicured toes was revealed
to me! And she was saying, calmly
and cheerfully: “Hello, Sam, you’re on
time to the dot. Why, what’s the mat-
ter? I declare, you’re blushing!”

A BOUT that time, my poor simple

  *	one-track brain had the answer.
The eye-pieces, of course, they’d X-
rayed Marjorie’s clothes. I hadn’t
thought of that, simply because I never
think of more than*one thing at a time.
Embarrassed? The word’s not one-
tenth strong enough. I managed to
mumble: “I was thinking, dear, how
beautiful you are.”

  “How do you like my new dress?”
she demanded, and when I said I
guessed it was okay—it was only slight-
ly visible, like a wisp of smoke—she
laughed like a peal of bells. “You don’t
sound very convincing, Sam darling. If
I hadn’t mentioned it, you wouldn’t
even have noticed my dress at all.”

  By then my face was so red that I
doubt if my freckles showed. I wanted
desperately to get those infernal things
out of my eyes, but I didn’t dare, not

with Marjorie looking on. She’d want
to know what they were, and I’d have
to tell her. Then—gee, maybe she’d
never speak to me again. That was too
awful to imagine.

  But she didn’t know, and she was
saying: “Miss Wheatland helped me
slip away, as usual. I’m expecting her
to come along any moment—oh, here
she is now. You remember Miss Wheat-
land, of course?”

  I’d met Marjorie’s teacher friend
twice already. “How do you do?” I
began to say, turning to greet her, and
gazing into that stern, spectacled face
that so belied a heart made apparently
of pure gold.

  And then I saw the rest of Miss
Wheatland, without benefit of the prim
dress she usually wore, and I was worse
shocked still.

  For that maiden-lady face I knew
was set upon the body of a man—
brawny shoulders, hairy chest, a blotch
of tattoo on one corded arm—and on
the left side, under the muscle-ridged
armpit, lurked something to scare even
a football lummox with half-baked sci-
entific ambitions.

  SHE—OR HE—was carrying a huge
automatic pistol, blue and shiny and
lethal looking. I hadn’t expected to
diagnose anything like that with my
X-ray!

  “How do you do, Mr. Sterrett,” said
the voice that I recognized as Miss
Wheatland’s. “I hope that I find you
well, young man. I’m going to take you
and Marjorie to tea.”

  “To tea?” I repeated foolishly, as
though I’d never dreamed of such a
thing. I was trying to add everything
up. Miss Wheatland was in reality a
man, disguised as a woman teacher—
that meant mystery. He was carrying
a gun, a whacking big one—that meant
outlawry, violence, crime. He was deep-
ly interested in Marjorie, pretending to
62

DYNAMIC Science Stories

be her best friend—golly, that meant
desperate danger to the girl I loved. . . .

   “Yes, to tea,” replied the casual voice
of the Wheatland impersonator. “A
friend of mine has given me the key
to her apartment, quite near here on
Riverside Drive. Come along, it’s a
lovely place—so restful—”

  “Let’s be going,” chimed in Marjorie,
and burrowed her little hand in under
my elbow.

  “Wait a moment,” I began to say,
then changed my mind. “All right,
ladies. Let’s go and have tea, by all
means.”

  Because I realized that I couldn’t
back out. This Wheatland creature was
after Marjorie for something. My X-
ray lenses could penetrate his disguise,
but not his plan. I had to tag along,
protect Marjorie, foil the whole thing.

  How?

  We walked for several blocks, and I
studied desperately every step of the
way. I only half noticed that the grass
was green or the sky blue, or that Mar-
jorie was chattering happily, or that the
Wheatland faker was pretending to be
pleasantly philosophical, or that all the
crowds of people along the Drive looked
to my lenses like a nudist parade. I was
full of the knowledge that I had to do
something about this mess, and do it
mighty quick.

' I ‘HERE was a cop on one corner—
a fine big Irishman, with a faint
tinge of blue to the cloudy film that
was his uniform, and a badge and night-
stick quite plain to view. I almost
yelled to him, but did not. What would
I be saying? That this quiet-looking
old maid was really a gunman, and that
I knew because 1 could see through his
clothes? That would settle everything,
but then Marjorie would know about
the X-ray glasses. And goodbye ro-
mance.

  We reached the apartment building,

went in and then up in an automatic
elevator. Marjorie, standing close to
me and all unaware that she looked to
me like a very unadorned Greek stat-
ue, said: “Do you feel all right. Sam?
Your eyes look glassy.” I smiled and
shook my humming head, but I guess
my eyes would have looked glassy even
without those lenses. No, they wouldn't,
because without the lenses I’d never
have known—oh, skip it. I’m a rotten
story teller.

  We rode up to the top floor, and the
Wheatland bandit conducted us down
a hall and into a swank apartment. The
foyer alone was as big as my room at
John Jay. Marjorie bounced on
through and sank down on a divan in
the parlor, but I paused on the inner
threshold. For, at the far end of that
drawing room, in a shadowy little nook,
crouched a squat, burly man.

  He was the greatest shock I’d had
yet.

  He was nude to my X-ray eyes, of
course, but that was no longer a nov-
elty. He held a gun ready in his hand,
but I had already spied and dared the
gun under the armpit of that Wheat-
land hoodlum. It was his face that
made me shiver and turn cold. I kn.nv
that face, as anyone must know it who
ever picked up a photo paper. Bald
head, heavy black brows, short upper
lip, lantern jaw—it was Dillard Harpe.

  Right, the one and only Dillard
Harpe, for whom J. Edgar Hoover and
his G-men were ransacking the coun-
try; Dillard Harpe, jailbreaker, killer,
kidnapper—there I had it! The whole
thing made sense on the instant. Harpe
and this WTieatland yegg were out to
kidnap Marjorie and hold her for ran-
som . . . maybe kill her. . . .

  “What’s the matter?” It was the
mock-prim Wheatland voice in my ear.
“Is there anything wrong, young man?”

 “Why—why—”

  “Oh, you’re admiring the hanging
INSIGHT

63

yonder. Yes, it’s a beautiful piece of
Oriental silk print, isn’t it?”

  That was the first realization I had
that the nook was hidden by a curtain
of some sort, and that Dillard Harpe
was ambushed behind it; or that he
would be ambushed if I hadn’t come
equipped with those X-ray peepers. So
I gulped, and managed to agree that
the hanging was a perfect triumph of
design. The Wheatland phoney didn't
tumble, but he did put a chair for me
in the corner farthest from Dillard
Harpe's hiding place.

  Then he touched a button on a desk,
and a bell rang. In from the kitchen
came an Oriental servant with a tea-
cart. He was the ugliest Mongol I had
ever seen outside of a war-scare car-
toon. and the muscles of his body, re-
vealed to my cloth-penetrating vision,
looked tough and wiry and jiujitsuv.
He wasn’t carrying a gun, only a long
wavy-edged knife, stuck under a belt
of which I could make out only the iron
buckle. So there were three in the kid-
nap gang, all armed, and I began to
know a new all-time high of being
scared. Three gangsters with guns and
knives can put plenty of chill into one
science student with X-ray lenses.

  The teacups were visible, all right,
and I could handle mine; but the sand-
wiches, being organic and lifeless,
looked like a heap of thin fleecy cloud
on the plate. I had to refuse with
thanks. Wheatland—at last I was think-
ing of him as a man, not an old witch
who had magically changed sex—was
keeping up a conversation of fashions
and bridge-playing and such woman-
topics, and Marjorie, tucked up at one
end of her divan, was laughing and
chiming in. I didn’t say much, and
what I did say must have sounded
hoarse and absent-minded.

OUT yourself in my place—sitting in
the corner of a strange, swanky

apartment, balancing a teacup on my
knee; slantwise across the room, my
girl, perching unconcernedly and hap-
pily, with nothing on but a shadow of
gray; two men with guns, watching
like hawks; and Fu Manchu’s homely
brother lurking in the kitchen with a
skinning-knife about two feet long. It
was the sort of situation that rises in a
movie serial, just when the screen
flashes out the words: End of Episode
8. How Will Captain Jack Tunible-
water Outu*it the Pirate Horde and
Rescue Lady Clarissa From a Fate
Worse than Death? Retjirn to this

HOBOKEN HAMSTRINGERS. The
big difference was that I couldn’t wait
a week for the showdown. Something
was due to break loose any second, and
I’d be in the thick of it.

   Wheatland finished his tea, and
turned to the desk. He picked up a pen
and looked across at me. “Will you do
a favor for us? . . .” It was still the
voice of the old-maid school teacher,
austere but loveable, who was bring-
ing two young sweethearts together,
and who was entitled to ask favors. I
had to say, “Why, of course, Miss
Wheatland,” and Marjorie beamed at
me for being a nice, polite boy.

   “I’m going to write a little note,”
went on the wolf in teacher’s clothing.
“I was just wondering if I could impose
on you to take it out and mail it.” A
grin at both of us, meant to look kindly.
“As a matter of fact, Marjorie, my
dear, this is to your father. It is to as-
sure him that I am taking splendid care
of you.”

   “I see,” nodded Marjorie. “Thank
you so much, Miss Wheatland.”

   “I see,” was my echo, and I did see.
This was to be the ransom note, and
Wheatland was telling about it going to
Marjorie’s father to explain the name
J. Barton Cannon on the envelope. My
mind went X-ray, too, for a moment,
64

and I seemed to have a vision of what
the letter would read like—something
on this order:

  Mr. Cannon:

    We are holding your daughter
  prisoner. Don’t try to find her or
  tell the police, if you want to see
  her alive again. Draw $100,000
  from the bank, in old bills, and
  wait for word from our repre-
  sentative.

  I let my eyes wander toward the
nook where Dillard Harpe, America’s
Public Enemy Number i-A, thought he
was hidden from view. He was all re-
laxed now, standing up straight with
his arms folded on his chest and the
gun dangling by its trigger-guard from
one forefinger. I suppose my size had
given him a little start at first, but by
now he had me pegged down for a dumb
college jasper who, instead of being
dangerous, was about to oblige by run-
ning an errand.

  Wheatland had apparently finished
the note and was folding it. He did
something else, with a sliding motion—
that would be to put the letter into an
envelope. Then he lifted his hands to
his mouth, licking the flap I couldn't
see and stuck it down. He opened a
drawer of the desk and fumbled in it.

  “Here’s a stamp,” he announced.
“Now, Mr. Sterrett, will you please
mail this? There’s a post-box just out-
side this building, on the corner.

  “Of course I will, Miss Wheatland,”
I said, getting up and coming to the
desk. “Where’s the letter?”

  “Why, here it is, right before your
eyes.” And I was able to perceive, in
his outstretched hand, a pale oblong
blur that must be the envelope. “What’s
come over you, young man? Some-
thing troubling your mind?”

pOR the first time, there was a deadly

*	note in that voice so carefully
pitched in old-maid timbre. Wheat-

land was suspecting me at last. It was
Marjorie who saved me for the mo-
ment.

  “Oh, you must forgive Sam,” she
laughed from the divan. “He’s a sci-
ence student, you know, and very seri-
ous. Probably he’s turning over some
new scientific formula-problem in his
mind.”

  “Yes, yes,” I made haste to agree.
“That’s it, a new formula.”

  “Indeed?” Wheatland still sounded
as if he was on the point of reaching for
his hidden gun. “And what, may I ask,
is this new formula?”

  “Oh, a—a new type of magnetic at-
traction,” I replied on inspiration. “I
was reminded by—this.”

  I put out my hand and picked up
from the top of the desk a round,
gleaming paperweight, the size of a ten-
nis ball.

  “That can’t be magnetized,” de-
murred Wheatland at once. “It’s made
of brass.”

  He knew the rudiments of science,
did that disguised torpedo, but he
didn’t know the inspiration that had
come and was now growing in my
brain. Already I was six jumps ahead
of that obvious objection.

  “This is quite new and startling,
Miss Wheatland,” 1 babbled as plausi-
bly as I could manage. “We’ve been
experimenting in secret at the univer-
sity. Brass can be magnetized to an
amazing degree—any heavy object has,
of course, certain forces of gravity to
be developed and multiplied within it.
Our new power, which involves the
contact of living flesh, attracts masses
of like substance to each other, even at
considerable distance.” By now I had
spied, in front of the arty-looking fire-
place, two big brazen andirons. “Let
me show you ladies one of our experi-
ments.”

  Wheatland’s suspicions were allayed
by now, but he didn’t want to see any
INSIGHT

65

marvels of science. He wanted me to
c;»rry that letter to the post-box, and
leave him and his fellowrats alone with
Marjorie. “Later, perhaps,” he put me
off. “Wait until you’ve mailed this—”
“But it will take only a few seconds,”
I pleaded, and Marjorie leaned for-
ward to add, “Yes, I want to see what
he’s going to do.”

  “All right, all right,” agreed Wheat-
land, not very graciously. “Go ahead
and show us. How does it work?”
“First of all,” I said, imitating the
lecture-manner of my stuffiest profes-
sor, “I shall shut off the magnetic influ-
ences from this paperweight.” I fished
out my handkerchief and knotted the
brass lump inside, then laid it on the
desk once more. “Next, Miss Wheat-
land, I shall ask you to help me.”

 “Help you? How?”

  “I want you to hold this.” Turning
to the fireplace, I picked up one of the
andirons. It was wrought all over with
cute modern designs, but it was big and
heavy. “Let’s have you sit where I was.
That will give us the length of the room
to show off the experiment in.”

  “This is exciting,” squealed Mar-
jorie. Wheatland took the andiron I
forced on him, and went and sat in my
chair in the far corner.

  “What next?” he prompted me.
“Hold your hands at opposite ends
of the andiron,” I directed, very im-
pressively. “Yes, like that. Now, knead
the two ends in your palms. Hard.
That’s it. Keep doing it.”

  “What’s this for?” he wanted to
know.

  “We don’t quite understand as yet,”
1 replied glibly. “I said that this is a
very recent type of experiment, and the
power is rather mysterious. Some of
the professors think it’s the human life-
fovce, which in some ways seems
closely related to electricity, communi-
cating itself to the brass. Others say
that there is a sort of sub-atomic affin-

ity between flesh and an alloy of cop-
per and zinc—”

  “Young man,” interrupted Wheat-
land icily, as he rubbed at the chunk of
metal, “I begin to suspect that you arc
having a rather feeble joke at my ex-
pense. Let me warn you that I am a
woman who is not used to being joked
with.”

  “Oh, but I wouldn’t dream of joking
with you,” I made haste to say. “We’re
ready to start now. Keep kneading the
ends of the andiron. Faster, Miss
Wheatland. Now—”

I PICKED up the paperweight in the

*	handkerchief and walked to where,
in the curtained nook, stood Dillard
Harpe. concealed from every eye but
mine. He had come forward against his
hanging, as if to peep through a hole
and see what I was up to. 1 turned
around with my back to him and faced
the room. Harpe was so close to me
that he could have reached out and
grabbed me.

  “Now,’' I repeated, “I shall demon-
strate this new magnetic force. I shall
release this bit of brass from its wrap-
pings, and you ladies will see it float
like a bubble, clear across the room. It
won’t stop until it touches that andiron
in Miss Wheatland’s lap. Are you both
ready?”

  “Ready,” grumbled Wheatland, and
“Ready,” cried Marjorie. I smiled as
disarmingly as I could, and held out
the weight in the handkerchief, so that
it dangled at arm’s length in fVont of
me.

  Then I spun around, as hard and
quick as 1 could. The brass weight
swung like a blackjack. It struck the
hanging, and rang like a bell-clapper on
the skull just behind. Harpe gave a sort
of moan and began to collapse.

  But 1 didn't wait to see him finish
the fall. 1 let the spin carry me clear
around, facing the room again. Mai

jorie was shrinking back on the settee,
her mouth open as if she was trying to
scream. Wheatland was half out of the
chair, throwing the heavy andiron from
his lap.

  I dropped the handkerchief and pa-
perweight, and made two striding
leaps. At the end of the second, I had
my head well down and my arms out.
I left the ground in a flying, diving
tackle.

  If Coach Lou Little had been there,
he’d have been critical. It’s illegal—in
football—to tackle with both feet off
the ground.. But it worked beautifully.

  My right shoulder smacked just
above Wheatland’s knees, and back he
tumbled, into the chair. The chair
went over, so hard did we hit it, and
broke into a dozen pieces of kindling.
Wheatland struck the floor beyond,
with the flat of his shoulders, and for a
moment I was standing almost on my
head above him. Then I twisted out of
what might have been a somersault,
and dropped on his belly. I remember
wishing that my two hundred pounds
was two thousand.

  It was working out as I hadn’t dare
hope. He’d had to scoop that andiron
out of his lap before drawing his gun,
and so I’d won the moment of time I
needed. Wheatland was groggy but
game, thrashing around and digging for
the pistol, but I kept on top and
clutched his right forearm. His left fist
smashed up at my face, and I felt my
e3’es blur as my head snapped back
and th«se X-ray lenses flew free to land
on the carpet beside us. But I hung
onto his gun arm, even when he hit me
a second and third time. With my left
hand I tore open his blouse—now that
the lenses were gone, I could see his
clothing, very prim and old-maidish—
and grabbed the gun myself.

  1 rose to my knees. Wheatland tried
to grapple, but I brought down the
gun-barrel across his temple. He melted

down like a snow man in a heavy thaw.
There was a mouthful of Oriental ex-
pletives from the kitchen and the serv-
ant rushed from there, his knife whip-
ping out from beneath his white coat.
I pointed the captured pistol.

  “Drop that toad-sticker!” I yelled.
“Quick!” And it tinkled on the floor.
“Get your hands up and stand with
your face in that corner.”

  He did as I told him. Now I could
spare a glance for his two pals. Dillard
Harpe was lying motionless, half out
of sight. His head and shoulders were
twisted up in the hanging he’d pulled
down, and his gun had bounced well
out of his reach. Wheatland lay crum-
pled at my feet, breathing heavily and
fluttering his eyelids.

that new dress of hers, about $500
worth of beautifully cut gray silk.
“Sam,” she was quavering, “what’s
happening.”

  “It’s aLl happened,” I reassured her.
“These three merry men thought they
were going to carry you off to their lair
—Look out!” I warned as she came
closer. “Don’t step on those things,
they’re valuable!”

  I bent quickly and snatched up the
two curved pieces of glass from in front
of her approaching slippers. “Thank
heaven, they aren’t broken,” I mum-
bled to myself. “Not even chipped.”
Marjorie was staring. “What are
they, Sam?”

  “Nothing,” I made haste to reply.
“Nothing at all, Marjorie—just a—a
pair of good luck pieces. Now be a
good girl and telephone the police while
I hold this gun on our friends.”

  Ninety minutes later I was sitting in
the office of the New York chfef of
detcctives. I was smoking a big cigar
that I didn’t particularly want, but J.

Burton Cannon had given it to me.
He’d also said what I'd never hoped
to hear—that he would be proud to
have me as a son-in-law, and he hoped
Marjorie and I would have at least
eight sons just like me, and that I must
be one of the brigade of vice-presidents
at his bank.

  The chief leaned across the desk
toward me. He had to speak loudly,
for in the end of the room a G-man
was telephoning to Washington, trying
to convince somebody he called “boss”
that the Dillard Harpe gang had just
been captured by a lone, college boy.

  “There was a ten thousand dollar
reward out for Harpe,” said the chief
of detectives, “and five thousand each
for Wheatland and that yellow boy
with the knife. Considerable potatoes.
Mr. Sterrett, and I hear that you can
take a banking job if you want it.”

  “I don’t intend to,” I assured him.
“I hoped you’d say that!” he crowed,
and grabbed my hand. “Look here, Mr.
Sterrett, we need young men like you
in my department. So if you’ll—”
“Thank you, sir,” I said, “but I’m
going to set up my own office with that
reward money. I’m going to be an in-
dependent investigator.”

  He broke off and sank back in his
chair. “I still don’t see how you man-

aged it. That gang had planned the
whole snatch to the last detail. W'heat-
land’s disguise was so good that he even
fooled the other teachers; Harpe was
completely hidden, and had his gun in
hand; the Oriental semed to be only
a servant. Yet you found them out,
captured them, and turned them over
with full convicting evidence in the
form of Wheatland's kidnap letter.
What’s your method, anyway?”

  My hand crept into my side-pocket,
and touched two little shells of glass.
“It would be hard to explain,” I hesi-
tated.

  “All I can call it is insight,” nodded
the chief of detectives.

  “Yes, sir. Insight.”

  In my mind I began to plan my work.
I’d keep the secret for a while, use it
to detect crime and build up a reputa-
tion. I’d have a laboratory, to develop
this X-ray gadget and other things.
Some day, maybe when I retired, I’d
tell the world. . . .

  A knock sounded at the door, and a
clerk stuck his head in.

  “Mr. Sterrett,” he called, “Mr. Can-
non and his daughter want to know
when you’ll be ready to go to dinner
with them.”

  Gee! How would I ever tell Marjorie
about the X-ray eyes?

Dear Joe:

   Here’s your blasted article; hope it’s in
 time for the April issue of your mag. It
 is, if you don’t ask me another re-write,
 which I’m damned if I’ll give you. I’ve
 been handing out this line longer than you
 have, and I ought to know what that class
 of readers wants.

   Think “Ananias” would be a good title,
but you won’t, of course. You’ve changed
the title of every article I’ve sent you. As
one editor to another, is that nice?

  When arc you going to send that article
you promised for my Sunday page? I
don’t want to have to fill the holes with
more stories about 2-headed chickens!

  Give me a ring next tithe you get down

to New York. So long,

ANANIAS

 by L. SPRAGUE DE CAMP

Are powerful machines of scientific destruction the greatest strength of a
country at war? Or is there a more sinister instrument, known as subtle

 propaganda?

By Walter

TRUTH, like a gem, has many
faces; you do not know it until
you have looked at them all.
More and still more books on the late
war between the Confederacy and the
Alliance roll from the presses; if I pre-
sume to add further printed matter to
this vast and growing pile, it is in the
hope of providing one more facet,
unique if small, to the gem of truth.

  The hope is, I think, reasonable: my
position as science editor of the New
York Times-Tribune afforded me both

a behind-the-scenes entree and a bird’s-
eye view of the technical developments
of the war. Much of my time is spent
burrowing in dusty library files, search-
ing out facts available to all but known
to few; again, much is spent in inter-
views, extracting the facts of tomorrow
from the vital minds of today.

A NOTHER big war was foreseen as

   *	far back as the Thirties, and the
nations had set about grimly preparing
for it. The expensiveness of the prepa-

ration may have been responsible for
postponing it more than thirty years.
The generals would go around to a gov-
ernment and say, “We’re in danger of
being attacked by countries A, B, and
C. Therefore we need such-and-such
an armament. You just give us the
money, and in three years we’ll be
ready for any eventuality.” The gov-
ernment would groan and say, “Mon
Dieu, that’ll ruin us!” and then give in.
The military measures would be taken,
and then they’d find that all their neigh-
bors had done likewise, so that they
were relatively no better off than they
had been before. So the whole business
would begin over again.

  The ideal solution for any one nation
would have been to have a greater ar-
mament than all the rest of the world
combined, but no nation was in a posi-
tion to do that—especially since China
had ceased to be one nation, and was
divided into eastern and western halves,
under the Japanese heel and in Russian
leading-strings respectively.

  In due course two of the future com-
batants found themselves “ready” at
once, and the necessary insignificant
excuse was found, and the war was on.
Within a year we were in it, despite
our good resolutions—or were they
good? Since we shall never know what
would have happened if we had stayed
out, there is no scientific way of set-
tling the question.

  I was hired by the Army Intelligence
Service as a part-time civilian em-
ployee: an employee because modern
Intelligence work consists of, besides
active espionage, an enormous amount
of study and comparison of public or
semi-public documents, such as gov-
ernmental reports, yearbooks, patent-
uffice publications,, etc., by which valu-
able information can be pieced together
out of unintentional hints; a civilian,
because my work was to be known only
to my employers; part-time, because

Intelligence valued my contacts with
sources of news that didn’t always pass
through the Military Censor’s hands. I
had had plenty of practice at this kind
of work in private life.

  On the evening of May 4, 1971, Ad-
miral Dahlgren called at my apartment.,
which was as usual knee-deep in papers
—though of course I kept no confiden-
tial ones there. After we had talked
of this and that, he said: “Young man,
your technical friends are driving us
nuts again. It was bad enough when
they pushed airplane speeds up into
the four hundreds and upset all our
calculations; but we knew the compres-
sibility-burble point put a Ceiling on
that and that they couldn’t get very far
over five hundred. Now they’ve begun
putting these auxiliary rocket-tube3 on
bombers to enable them to spring away
from pursuit-’planes, and compressibil-
ity-burble doesn’t matter; so God
knows what they’ll do to our figures
now. They may go up over a thousand.
Hmp. Damn it, where’s my pipe?”

  “They have,” I said.

  “What?”

URE. Haven’t you Navy people
heard about it? It’s a new Arado
that flies on its tubes alone except in
taking off and landing, and it’s said to
do around twelve hundred miles an
hour. It’s for photography only, be-
cause at that speed yOu can’t hit any-
thing much smaller than Manhattan
with a bomb. Doesn’t even carry a
gun, bccause things go by too fast to
aim at them.”

  “Hmp. If your boys know about it,
ours probably do too, only they didn’t
bother to tell me. Nobody ever tells
me anything,” he complained. “Damn
it, what did I do with those matches.
I suppose those dumbunny designers
of ours got caught flatfooted, as usual.
Hmp. Have to put the screws 011 them.
They’ve been promising us an effective
ANANIAS

71

rocket-ship for six months, damn it.
Ah-h!” The Admiral had found his

matches.

  “You know, Hasbrook,” he went on,
“The more I look at this war, the pho-
nier the ostensible reasons for it seem.
The idea that the members of the Alli-
ance are fighting for needed natural
resources has been worn pretty thin by
our modern advances in chemistry,
agronomy, and so forth. You don’t need
much resources to support your people
nowadays. On our side we talk about
saving democracy, but I notice that our
line-up includes some very peculiar-
looking democracies—the regime of the
Argentine cattle-barons, for instance. I
suppose, though, that you can’t be too
fussy about your friends or you won’t
have any.

  “If I were to try to put in words my
own feelings, I’d say that we were after
tangible things, such as food, clothes,
shelter, and entertainment for our folks.
We may not know just how to get them,
but at least there are such things. The
other side seems to be fighting for
things that either don’t exist such as
the purity of their race, or whose ex-
istence can’t be proved, such as the
divinity of their ruler.

  “They’re also after their national
honor, which as nearly as I can make
out is the kind of prestige you get by
inflicting insult and injury on another
and getting away with it. So every so
often they have to injure or humiliate
their neighbors as a matter of princi-
ple, previous promises to the contrary
notwithstanding, hmp.

  “The Hell of it is that you can get
people fighting over these imaginary
abstractions, such as honor, if anything
more easily than over real objectives,
and the Alliance knows it—at least that
devil Raiberti knows it.” Here my
crusty friend exhausted his stock of
four-letter words on the Alliance’s Chief
of Public Enlightenment. “And with

everybody carrying a radio the size of
a watch we can’t stop him. We can’t
even blanket these wave-crest modu-
lated sets without smothering all our
own stuff at the same time. If your
technical friends—”

  Just then the world outside was lit
up as by a noon sun. Then came a
sound—the sort you feel rather than
hear; but I should describe it as a vast
grunt.

T CAME to lying in a corner of the

  room. I couldn’t have been out more
than a second or two, because through
my now gaping window came a long-
drawn-out roar, made, I later learned,
by tons of steel and masonry showering
on lower Manhattan.

  The Admiral was already up, swear-
ing in six languages. The lights slowly
came on again. The roar died, to be
replaced by official sirens and gongs.
To the South, over the hedge of sky-
scrapers. a red glow lighted the belly
of an immense smoke-cloud. We tried
the telephone, but at first it didn’t work,
and when it did all the numbers we
called for information were busy.

  As I' stepped back to the window, a
piece of paper the size of a playing-
card fluttered in. Across the top, in
24-point bold-face, were the words
“Don’t Be a Sucker, Buddy!”, and be-
low it one of the cleverly-worded ap-
peals of Raiberti’s gang proving that
the Alliance really thought the world
of us, but that we were misled by our
scheming politicians.

  There was no mystery about it. The
Alliance had sent a radio-controlled
rocket a couple of hundred feet long,
with a mighty charge of explosive in its
nose, across the Atlantic from the Alps.
When it was almost over New York, a
number of little auxiliary rockets full
of these love-notes had been released to
scatter their load, while the big one
dove into the financial district.
72

DYNAMIC Science Stories

  The next day I got a pass to the
scene of the explosion. Where the City
Bank Farmers Trust Building had been
was now a large hole, pafrtlf filled with
steel beams twisted into pretzel shapes.
The skeletons of the surrounding sky-
scrapers were mostly still standing, but
all the masonry had been blown away.
Because of the financial district’s
sparse night population, there had been
less loss of life there than was caused
by the fall of debris elsewhere. Some
of it fell as far north as Times Square.

  I was out at Fort Montauk the night
the second—and last—of these visitors
came. A battery of new guns had been
put up so hurriedly that there were
footprints in the emplacements where
the crews had walked before the con-
crete was dry. The guns themselves
looked incredibly large, but that was
because of the water-jackets six feet in
diameter (including the cooling-fins)
around their barrels. A cooling-unit the
size of a box-car, full of blowers and
radiators, was required to dissipate the
heat developed by their thirty-rounds-
a-minute fire.

  I descended into the fire-control
room, which was full of men uncon-
cernedly smoking while looking at in-
dicators and oscillographs and pushing
buttons and turning knobs. The main
view-plate was a four-foot glass square,
black except for a grid of green lines.
The adjutant explained this and that
to me, and a buzzer sounded. The op-
erator in front of the main plate said
over his shoulder, “Here she comes!”
I saw the men tense themselves.

A T the top of the plate a white dot
appeared and moved slowly down
the glass, leaving a thread of purple
light behind it. 1 held my breath, but
you can’t do that for ten minutes, and
the rocket was still far out of range.
The minutes crawled by, the silence
complete except for the breathing of

the men and the tiny noises of their
instruments.

  The dot reached a line a little heavier
than the others, and I knew that the
rocket was fifty miles out and angling
down from the stratosphere. The oper-
ator pressed another buzzer. Through
the concrete, the firing of the guns came
to us as a tattoo of thurfips. I was glad
I wasn’t outside: of all guns, the six-
inch is hardest on eardrums, but the
eight-inch, which these were, is not far
behind it.

  Little dots of red appeared on the
plate, closer and closer to the white dot
until they looked like a cluster of gems.
The white dot seemed to swerve slight-
ly, and turned red, meaning that it was
dropping out of the plane represented
by the plate. The operator spun a
handwheel and brought it back to white
again. He kept turning, turning, until
his altitude dial showed zero. The white
dot flickered and disappeared. Some-
where out on the Atlantic a column of
steam marked the end of the rocket.
It was all over. The defense had caught
up with the offense again.

  It had caught up elsewhere, too.
The main cities of Europe were buried
in sandbags and sheathed with explo-
sion-mats, and ringed with guns that
could in a twinkling blast out of the
sky any hostile aircraft, regardless of
its speed or the weather conditions. On
the battlefields, long lines of concealed
gun-emplacements peered at each other
from behind barbed-wire, concealed
pits, fences of railroad-irons stuck up-
right in the ground, land mines, and
every other defense that desperate men
could devise. No-man’s land was sprin-
kled with the remains of men and of
tanks that had tried to cross the space.
The gun-crews groped for each other
with sound-detettors, infra-red detec-
tors, and seismographic detectors and
fired. When a shot went home, the gun
and its crew were replaced, and the war
ANANIAS

73

went on.

 Our Turkish friends drove through
Thrace for a few miles, and were
stopped by the Balkan army under
Vacarescu. The Indians were slowly
pinched back into Begal by the vast
Japanese-officered Chinese armies of
the Alliance, with the help of a few
Siamese divisions. Things went against
us in Uruguay.

  As the battlefields became more lit-
tered and shell-pitted, and as the con-
testants dug themselves in deeper, the
snail-like pace of the war asymptoti-
cally approached a dead stop. But in
the minds of men another kind of war
was being fought. You bought a pack
of cigarettes; the third one that you
took out suddenly unrolled into a strip
of paper bearing a propaganda mes-
sage. You called the police, who ar-
rested the clerk, the delivery-man, the
dealer, and everybody at the cigarette-
factory through whose hands the
smoke might have passed. Their unan-
imous denial of knowing anything
stood up under the lie-detectors. You
couldn’t shoot them all in the hope of
getting the hostile agent; you’d have to
kill too large a proportion of the popu-
lation, and besides that was the sort of
barbarity practiced by the Alliance,
whereas our side was supposed to be
more humane.

V/’OU bought a head of lettuce, and

  *	the grocer made out your receipted
bill. The bill was normal enough when
he stuffed it in the paper bag of pro-
visions, but by the time you got home
it had changed into one of Raiberti’s
billetdoux. You had the grocer ar-
rested, again without result.

  Admiral Dahlgren, looking in civil-
ian clothcs more than ever like a
Minnesota farmer, was in my apart-
ment one evening when I turned on the
radio. I set it for a commercial station,
but when I threw the switch a hearty

voice said: . . statement by Senator
James. Now, folks, we don’t like to
doubt a senator’s word, but when you
consider that in 1956 he was held for
mental observation in the Des Moines
City Hospital, we think it should be
taken with a grain of salt. I’m afraid
you’re being taken for a little ride,
folks. If you want to know how he got
his dough, I’d suggest you look into the
matter of the Oregon timber leases of
1959, and compare that with f The
voice was drowned in a blare of dance-
music. The commercial station, no
doubt in response to frantic official
telephone calls, had changed their
wave-form to blanket the Alliance sta-
tion.

  “The swine!” barked the Admiral.
“I get a lot of inside dope, and I know
James had nothing to do with that
scandal. But they’re so damned clever
that their biggest lies are of a kind you
can’t absolutely disprove. Remember
the last time they pulled that insanity
gag? They said President McRae had
been in the looney-bin at White Plains.
Then it turned out that a small fire had
destroyed that hospital’s records, so
that no matter what McRae said there
was always a shade of doubt in people’s
minds. Hmp.”

  Another time he brought up an in-
dividual who looked like a neo-vorticist
poet, whom he introduced as Dr. Quen-
tin Hoyle, the psychologist. I was sur-
prised: I’d met many psychiatrists, but
most of them were men of conservative
appearance designed to give confidence
to their patients.

  The Admiral spoke gloomily of the
war. “Same old story, limp. Trouble
on the Ukrainian front. Trouble on the
Chinese front—morale. They had a lit-
tle mutiny in the Chinese Soviet’s 52nd
Division. Propaganda, of course. Any-
body who can beat the Communists at
that game is good. You probably
haven’t heard about it; the mutiny
74

DYNAMIC Science Stories

story should have been censored out
before it got to you.”

  “No,” I replied, “I haven’t, but I
have heard about our own morale trou-
bles in the South and the Midlands.
Raiberti’s song-and-dance has been
making headway in the Chicago area.”
The Admiral was going through his
usual motions of hunting for a match.
“Damn, damn, where’d I put them?
You know, Hasbrook, our technics
are easily as good as the Alliance’s, but
in this ‘public enlightenment’ business
they make our best advertising men
and psychologists—with due apologies,
Hoyle—look like children.”

' I ‘HE dreamy-looking Hoyle pulled
A his long hair, and said: “Repeat a
thing often enough, and it leaves an
indelible impression on a man’s mind,
whether he wants to believe it or not.
If either of you gentlemen are married
you’ll know what I mean.”

  “Hmp, hmp. I am; Hasbrook isn’t
that I know of. I get you, though, Doc.
It sort of wears a path through the
mind, doesn’t it?”

  Hoyle was silent for so long that
Dahlgren thought he hadn’t heard, and
started to repeat. But the psychologist,
still looking at nothing, raised his hand.
“Wears a path, yes. I suppose one
could describe it thus in popular terms.
I think you’ve said something, Ad-
miral. If you have, we may yet hoist
the Alliance with their own petard.”
“Hmp! What the Hell’s a petard?”
“Tsk, and you a military man! It’s
a kind of bomb used in the later mid-
dle ages for seige work, and ‘hoist’ in
that sense means ‘blow up.’ ” With
which Hoyle retired into his own rare-
fied mental atmosphere, refusing to
elaborate.

  It was a month before the Admiral
came around again; the Alliance was
giving our Naval Intelligence plenty of
overtime work. You wouldn’t have

guessed it from the censored newspa-
pers, but I knew that the morale of the
countries of the Confederacy was going
from bad to worse. In the United States
there was sabotage—not by spies, but
by disgruntled Americans in Milwau-
kee, an attempted peace-at-any-price
demonstration in Topeka, and a lynch-
ing of an Army officer in Georgia. In
other countries it was worse: Argen-
tina was practically out of the war, and
Australia was cracking.

  I didn’t wonder. Wherever you
turned, Raiberti’s propaganda got in
your hair. If the ceasless rain of half-
truths, insinuations, and lies got on my
nerves, I could imagine how it affected
the masses of people, who lacked my
inside knowledge. The usual spy-fever
was bad enough, but this was some-
thing undreamed of in the old days.

  The neatest trick that Raiberti’s
agents pulled was the doctoring of a
load of newsprint on its way to the
presses of my paper, so that three hours
after the papers were printed the orig-
inal print faded out and Raiberti’s
messages took its place—just about the
time the buyers of the papers were
reading them. Almost as good was their
placing a miniature phonograph in the
microphone that McRae was supposed
to use for a broadcast speech. When
the President started, we heard what
was apparently his voice, complete
with Philadelphia accent, go off on a
rambling tirade denouncing Congress,
the Army, the Navy, the farmers, the
workers, and everybody else in sight,
the talk being punctuated by frequent
hiccups. And all the time poor McRae
was making one of the best and most
reasonable speeches of his career! It
was hardly surprising that the rumors
that Raiberti had started concerning
the President’s sanity revived.

YY/HEN Dahlgren did come around
** again he brought a gang. There
ANANIAS

wa§ the poetic-looking Hoyle, and a
dark man who combined the outlines
and manner of an Iowa realtor with a
buttery Oxford accent; he was intro-
duced as Colonel Bosh of the Indian
Army. The last man, whose name the
Admiral said was Mr. Tsung, was an
obvious Eastern Asiatic. When I got a
good look at him something went
‘click;” I almost said “Phil!” but
stopped at the “ph.”

  “Tsung” simultaneously recognized
me and almost spoke, but checked him-
self. Then he laughed. “We might as
well own up, Walt. The Admiral knows
who I am, but he didn’t know that you
did.”

  Years before, I had gone to high-
school in California with a Japanese-
American boy named Philip Okuma.
He had—an incredible thing unless
you knew him—been elected student-
body president. But some local patri-
otic society became exercised and
forced a change in our so-called Con-
stitution, so that poor Phil was eu-
chered out of his job. The experience
hadn’t soured him.

  Now he mentioned that he was doing
Intelligence work. “What else is there?”
he asked. “My people have been in
this country for three generations, but
a lot of good that does me, when every
Jap is supposed to be a spy, a saboteur,
an emperor-worshiper, and a lot of
other things. And in Japan I’d be con-
sidered a foreigner who had been ex-
posed to the wicked and impious ideas
of the Western barbarians.” He
laughed again.

  The Admiral called the meeting to
order. Hoyle handed him a little black
cylinder, about the size of the eraser
in the end of an ordinary pencil.

  “Colonel Bosh.” Dahlgren said,
“Your job is this: your agents are to
introduce these—these things into the
electrical communications of the
enemy in Burma, without getting

caught. You have, I know, pulled risk-
ier jobs before. I’m having the techni-
cal details typed and photo-offset;
you’ll get them tomorrow. Tsung here
—Okuma, that is—is to get the first
ones installed in Japan. I’m sorry we
had to deprive you of a good molar,
Okuma, but I think you’ll find that the
fake one we gave you to hold the—
hmp—capsule works well. The capsule,
once installed, cannot be removed
without setting off a minute charge of
thermite in it that will destroy it. I
can’t tell you how it works, not even
you, Hasbrook, but you can take my
word that it does. When it and, we
hope, several thousand more like it
have been given a chance to work, your
general staff will be given the necessary
information.”

  Bosh, who was, I knew, a much more
dangerous man than one would have
suspected from his aggressively harm-
less exterior, made a fatuous little
speech about doing one’s duty for one’s
paw people, Sir. We talked of this and
that, and they went.

IN about a month, my sources began
*■ to turn up incredible reports. A Jap-
anese cruiser squadron was caught and
wiped out off the Kuriles by a superior
Russo-American force. Their com-
mander, fished out of the water and
forcibly prevented from committing
suicide, babbled that his rear admiral,
had said to go ahead because the whole
battlefleet was right behind him, when
we knew that there were no Japanese
battleships within hundreds of miles.

  In Lithuania, General Czarnewicz*
was court-martialed and shot by the
Alliance high command for saying that
all was quiet on his front, when actu-
ally the Russians had broken bis line,
and he was just about to jump in his
car and flee to avoid being run over by
his own retreating troops.

^Pronounced char-wyay-vitch
76

DYNAMIC Science Stories

  Dictators von Frey gang and Botor-
ovic weren’t on speaking terms, each
swearing that the other had baldly lied
to him at their last meeting.

  In Bengal, Field Marshall Sato
started an offensive with one day’s am-
munition, after assuring his Supply
Service that he had enough for a
month. When his Chinese troops ran
out of shells and cartridges and the In-
dians counter-attacked, the results
were pitiful. The Indians almost got
across Burma into Siam before they
were effectively opposed, and their ad-
vance was stopped more by the clog-
ging of their supply lines with hun-
dreds of thousands of prisoners than by
the frantic efforts of the Alliance
armies. I suspected that somehow our
buttery friend Bosh was at the bottom
of the debacle.

  Then one afternoon the Admiral
paid me another visit, his last one dur-
ing the war. “That damn place is nois-
ier than a triple eighteen-inch turret,”
he said, referring to his office. “Every
three minutes somebody pops in with
a ‘Sir, what do I do with this now?’ or a
‘Sir, Commander Zilch sends his com-
pliments and wants to know some-
thing,’ and so on. I’ve got to get these
reports read, so I came up here. Listen,
Hasbrook, will you call up on that se-
cret ’phone of yours and arrange to
have any important intelligence
’phoned up? Big news is likely to break
any minute.”

  He settled down to his reports. Pres-
ently the bell rang, and in walked
Philip Okuma. To the Admiral’s and
my questions as to what in Hell he was
doing here, he replied that he’d just
been flown over from Siberia, and
hadn’t found Dahlgren in his office
when he went there to report.

  “For a while,” he said, “I had no
trouble installing the capsules, as I had
been given the rank of corporal in the
Imperial Army and was assigned to

headquarters as a stenographer. But
as a result of the operation of the cap-
sules there’d been some bad losses on
the Manchurian front, and the first
thing I knew I was shipped off to the
trenches, leaving my subordinates in
Intelligence to carry on the good work
with the capsules.

  “I soon found that morale wasn’t
very good in my outfit, the reason being
that people at headquarters had been
making so many statements that failed
to prove true.

NYWAY, last wreek we were or-
dered to advance across the Sun-
gari. The advance went fine, with am-
phibian tanks to support it—except
that our battalion was on the extreme
left of the brigade, and suddenly found
that the brigade next to us had simply
pulled out, for no apparent reason, and
gone home. Of course you never real-
ize just what’s going on on a battlefield,
but I was chief battalion runner and
got a better idea than most of the men.

  “With our flank in the air, the en-
emy—that is to say, the enemy of the
army in which I was ostensibly serv-
ing—wasted no time, and we had to fall
back on the Sungari. We dug in in
some marshy ground on the inside of a
bend in the river, and waited. Our
batallion had only four officers left, a
captain Ishii and three lieutenants. We
sat in the mud for three days, and ran
out of most of our ammunition and all
of our food.”

  The ’phone rang for the Admiral.
When he finished listening, he said with
a broad grin, “The Brazilian Army has
asked for an armistice. Told you some-
thing was going to pop. Go on, Oku-
ma.”

  “As I was saying, we sat there, with
Captain Ishii trying by radio to get
something done about our precarious
position. Finally Headquarters an-
nounced that they were sending some
ANANIAS

77

’planes over to drop supplies, and asked
our exact, location, which was given.

  “Pretty soon the airplanes appeared,
but instead of supplies a bomb came
whooshing down, and we scuttled for
our holes like a lot of prairie-dogs. The
’planes dropped three more before the
Captain, by frantically waving a Jap-
anese flag, got their attention.

  “I could guess what had happened:
a capsule had been influencing the op-
erator at headquarters, and he, when
given the position of our battalion, had
reported it as that of a group of the
enemy: The bombs hadn’t done much
damage because of the softness of the
ground, but I still felt that the capsules
were working a little too well for my
comfort. Having been brought up in
this country, I haven’t quite the fatal-
istic attitude about death that a true
Japanese possesses.

  “After the ’planes had gone, and
Captain Ishii had protested loudly into
his radio, an amphibian supply-carrier
appeared across the river, splashed into
it, and puttered over. It crawled out on
its tracks, and the driver hove out four
large boxes. ‘These, Sir,’ he said to
Ishii, ‘Are your food and ammunition.’

  “Ishii looked puzzled. ‘Why are the
boxes marked, “Woolen Mittens”?,’ he
asked.

  “The driver answered, ‘The Honor-
able Headquarters did not inform me,
Sir,’ and drove his machine back the
way it had come.

  “We hacked open the boxes in a hur-
ry, I can tell you. You can imagine the
feelings of those soldiers when the first
was full of—woolen mittens. The sec-
ond and third were likewise.

  “Captain Ishii said in a strangled
voice, ‘Open the remaining box!’ We
did, and it contained -woolen mittens.

  “Just then Captain Ishii spotted
Sergeant Wada reading one of the in-
numerable propaganda leaflets with
which the Russian ’planes had show-

ered us. ‘Sergeant!’ he barked, ‘I
thought I told you not to read those
again?’

  | 'HE sergeant just looked at him,
and said ‘Sure you did, but I didn’t
promise not to.’

  “Ishii looked as though he were go-
ing to have apoplexy. Not only was the
sergeant being insubordinate, but he
was using the forbidden Fourth In-
flexion. The Japanese language has
four inflections implying different de-
grees of politeness; ordinarily officers
use the contemptuous Fourth to en-
listed men, and enlisted men use the
respectful Second to officers. The ser-
geant’s use of the Fourth was a mortal
insult.

  “Sergeant Wada went on: ‘Further-
more, I’ll do as I damn please. You
and the rest of the officers have been
fooling us long enough. You’ve given
us every reason to believe that these
Russians’—here he waved the paper—
‘are right after all, when they say that
all this talk about the divinity of the
Emperor and the glory of the Empire
is just a racket. In war you expect
people in authority to lie, especially to
the enemy and to the masses on their
Own side. But the members of our High
Command lie not only to us, but to each
other as well. That bombing this morn-
ing, and these mittens, aren’t the first
of such happenings, but as far as I’m
concerned they’ll be the last. Nobody
in his right mind wants to fight for such
crazy people. Who’s with me?’

  “Ishii whipped out his big old samu-
rai sword and started for Wada, but a
big gun went off and the Captain fell
with his face in a puddle. We were as-
tonished to see that Lieutenant Tatsuta
had killed him. But then, these lieu-
tenants were all pretty fresh from the
ranks. The shortage of officers had
made it necessary to promote them in a
hurry, a id they couldn’t be expected to
78

DYNAMIC Science Stories

take the samurai code as seriously as
the military-academy products.

  “Tatsuta said to Wada, ‘I’m with
you; I think you’re right. How about
you, Kanzaki?’ speaking to one of the
other two lieutenants.

  “Kanzaki said, ‘The samurai code
leaves me but one course,’ and before
anybody could move he had pulled his
pistol and blown his brains out.

  “ ‘You, Ichikawa?’ said Tatsuta to
the remaining looey, a nervous little
rabbity man. Ichikawa answered,
‘We-ell, I suppose I really ought to kill
myself too. But a lot of queer things
have been happening, and if it should
turn out that Wada is right, and the sa-
murai code is actually the bunk, I’d
have killed myself for no good reason.
And if it transpires that Wada is
wrong, it will always be easy enough
to kill myself when that time comes. So
I think I’ll go with you boys for a while
and see what happens.’

  “We hoisted a white flag, and pretty
soon a tank rattled over the nearest rise
and up to the edge of the soft ground.
A man in a Russian uniform got out
and asked us in a strong Mongol accent
who was in command.

  | ’HAT was embarrassing, because
obviously Sergeant Wada was the
commander de facto, and Lieutenant
Tatsuta was the commander de jure.
They began arguing about it, bowing
and hissing politely through their teeth,
but the Mongol officer said to skip it,
and ordered us to fall in. As we start-
ed to march away, one little private
asked the Mongol if he was going to
have us killed. The officer just grinned,
and said ‘Why should we? You’ll all
be good Communists by the time we
get through with you!’ ”

  The ’phone rang again. When the
Admiral had finished listening this time,
he was fairly bursting. “Poland has
quit! In Italy they’ve set up something

called a co-operative republic, though
how co-operative and how repub-
lican it is remains to be seen. Von
Freygang has killed himself. The King
of the South Slavs fled from his palace
in his pajamas, and when last seen was
pulling his pants on in the cabin of his
private ’plane just before it took off.”
He paused for breath. While he was
getting it, I suggested getting our cele-
brating in early, before the streets be-
came packed. He said “Sure, sure! But
we’d better bring along the man who
really did this—you know, the brain
guy, Hoyle.” So he called the psycholo-
gist, and we picked up him and his wife
on our way to the hotel.

  The steak wasn’t up to my idea of a
celebration steak, but meat prices were
still astronomical as a result of war
rationing. We drank enough cocktails
so that all the food tasted pretty good
whether it was or not, and the Admiral
said to Hoyle: “Hasbrook here has been
asking me leading questions ever since
I had you up to his place, trying to find
how your capsule works. I guess it
wouldn’t hurt to tell him now, espe-
cially as he’s the most discreet man I
know, except maybe Okuma here, damn
it.”

  Hoyle brought his eyes slowly back
into focus. “Capsule?” he said vague-
ly. “Oh, yes, that’s what you call my
transmitter.” He gazed into space for
a moment.

  “Remember, Mr. Hasbrook, when
the Admiral spoke of wearing a path
through the mind? That gave me the
idea. Every thought, every mental im-
age, every sense-impression, consists es-
sentially of an electric discharge-pat-
tern between millions of neurons in the
cortex of the brain. The pattern is so
complicated that it is better described
as a ‘web’ than as a ‘path’.

  “But it’s a definite linkage between
definite cells, and the passage of electric
current quasi-permanently lowers the
ANANIAS

79

resistance of the synapses between the
neurons. Therefore one can re-create
the pattern at will; or rather, electrical-
ly re-activate a pattern already creat-
ed. This we call ‘remembering’.

  “In the setting up of one of these
patterns by the lowering of resistance
through certain synapses, many small
discharges are as effective as one large
one. Therefore an unnoticed sound
that one hears or a sight that one sees
daily becomes an integral part of one’s
personality.

“|\/TY transmitter was designed to be
placed in the regular transmitter
of any electrical communication sys-
tem, either wire or wireless, and con-
nected in parallel with the transmitter
circuit. It was so constructed that
when the circuit was activated, the little
transmitter would feed a sound-modu-
lated current of the same frequency as
that of the main circuit into it. The
added current would carry a simple
word-pattern urging the listener to lie.
For instance, the transmitters installed
in Germany said lEs ist gut zu liigen—
cs ist gut zu liigen’ over and over.

   “The listener would not actually hear
-THE

these words, because they were a mere
inaudible murmur superimposed on the
conversation of the speaker. But, if
he used the instrument often enough,
the minute neuronic impulses caused by
these sounds would in time wear the
necessary paths in his brain, and he’d
believe it was good to ‘liigen’. With
these devices installed in the telephones
and radios used by the dictators, minis-
ters, and general staffs of the Alliance
countries, the result was what we have
seen. In other words, we made patho-
logical liars out of them.”

   He paused again, and I could imagine
millions of resentful soldiers taking
their destinies into their own hands; of
their officers, some yelling, threatening,
and being contemptuously shot down,
others discreetly removing their insig-
nia and joining their men.

   “That’s what I meant by saying that
we’d hoist them with their own petard.
All these men have made such extensive
use of that never-obsolete weapon, the
lie, and they’re all such accomplished
liars anyway, that it didn’t take as
much of this form of suggestion to
achieve our object as it would have with
more truthful people.”

magnetizing the North Pole!

trawler Annisquatn harbor bound. His
thick, hairy hands gripped the wheel
tightly and his strong teeth were
clamped on the stem of his short pipe.
Behind thick-lensed spectacles his pale
eyes probed the darkness. From time
to time he screwed up his lips and spat
through the open window of the pilot
house into the phosphorescent sea.

Over the monotonous throb of the
engine came the sound of the crew talk-

ing lazily as they listened to one of
them playing melodious chords on a
harmonica. Hagart smiled to himself,
his weathered face aglow in the feeble
light of the binnacle. The day’s haul
had been good, the crew was in fine fet-
tle and the engine hitting well. The
sea was running comparatively calm,
with long ground swells. By force of
habit he thrust his head through the
window and glanced upwards at Polaris
UNDER THE NORTH POLE

for checking with the compass.

  Absently his eyes shuttled back to
the binnacle and in the next instant his
face became blank with astonishment
and his pipe sagged in his lips. Sven
Hagart gaped incredulously at the
rocking disc of the compass and then
his strong teeth were clamping on the
pipe stem with such power that it
snapped off. “Ar det mojligtl” he mur-
mured. “Has the stars gone crazy or
iss I asleep!”

  He blinked a couple of times, then
looked out again. Polaris was only half
a point off the starboard bow, shining
bright and clear. Again his troubled
eyes sought the compass and narrowed.
Quickly he becketted the wheel, re-
moved his spectacles and polished them
vigorously. Perhaps spray had warped
his vision . . . but he sensed differently
as he replaced the glasses, setting them
into their customary place.

  For the third time he stared at the
North Star and back at the binnacle
again. His face seemed to drain of all
color and jyith a throaty exclamation
of alarm and puzzlement he thrust his
head through the door and yelled:
“Eric! Nathan! Come quick! Some-
thing iss ... I don’t know what!”

INSTANTLY the harmonica silenced.
A There was a scramble of feet on deck.
Sven stood by the binnacle, pointing an
accusing finger at the compass. “It says
nor’east!” he burst out. “An’ the Star
is just off the starboard quarter. How
can we be goin’ nor’east an’ nor’-by-
west at the same time?”

  The seamen crowded about him and
stared. One of them rocked the binna-
cle and the compass rolled lazily past
the point it had been holding, farther
east. Tensely they watched, expecting
it to halt and swing back. But the disc
continued to move steadily in a. full cir-
cle!

  Alarmed, the men examined it. Noth-

ing seemed out of whack and there was
no metal near to throw it off. But the
disc kept on swinging aimlessly through
ninety degrees of arc as if immune to
the customary magnetic attraction.
Sven threw up his hands helplessly. “Iss
we crazy or iss it? Or iss the stars just
flying around like lightning bugs?”

  At exactly that moment all over the
northern hemisphere, men were staring
unbelievingly at compasses which re-
fused to make sense. The captains of
great liners flashed messages back and
forth asking bearings, afraid to believe
their time-tried indicators, and yet
afraid not to, puzzled by the strange
discrepancies between gyro-compasses
and magnetic compasses. Astronomers
found their telescopes off as much as
one hundred and eighty degrees—ac-
cording to stationary, exact compasses.
They radioed back and forth demand-
ing to know if the same thing were
happening at other observatories.

  Air-liner pilots suddenly found them-
selves flying two hundred miles per hour •
in exactly the opposite direction from
what they had been pursuing five min-
utes before. And even as they watched,
the maddening cylinders of their instru-
ments continued to swing about, now
registering east, now west, now north,
even south.

  For three hours the ether boiled with
frantic messages from men who were
lost at sea, or aimlessly cruising the
skies afraid to land, from lighthouse
keepers who thought their great, stone
towers were twisting on sinking bases.
The Naval Observatory spent a desper-
ate hour trying to solve the riddle, and
finally gave up and sat with folded
hands awaiting the answer.

  And after three hours the erratic
needles of half the world’s compasses
gradually moved back and took up the
positions ;hey had held for thousands
of years—due north. Once more the
82

stars agreed with the faithful, slender
needles of steel or the broad disks of
mariners’ compasses. Whatever it had
been the crisis was over.

                              •

  And in all the world there was onjy
one man who knew what was happen-
ing, and that man was too far away to
be of any help. Besides, George Kane
was having troubles of his own at that
moment. He stood—figuratively and
literally—on the brink of death.

  For three days after he was sepa-
rated from the rest of his party on
Prince of Wales of Ireland, tall, bony
young Kane struggled to find them.
There were six members of the expedi-
tion sent up by the Smithsonian Insti-
tute, and Kane was the youngest of
them. But after endless hours of wan-
dering about, he realized he was hope-
lessly lost.

  The young anthropologist, leader of
an expedition to investigate rumors of
a strange race in the Arctic—rumors
they had dispelled—was in the most
difficult spot of his life. He had no food,
no water.

p\ESPERATELY, he stumbled
ahead. His feet were so nearly
frozen that he couldn’t move his toes
inside the thick boots, nor could he flex
his fingers. He lost all consciousness
of time, and seemed to see nothing but
snow. All his senses were blended into
one great, empty feeling of being hope-
lessly lost. But the flame of hope is un-
quenchable in man; it kept him strug-
gling ahead long after his strength was
really used up.

  And then, after endless hours, George
Kane suddenly straightened up and lis-
tened. His drawn face took on a new
intensity. Frowning, he stared at the
ground. There was a peculiar pounding
beneath his feet. At first he thought
he had strayed onto ice and that it was
cracking, but soon he realized the sound

was different.

  It was steady, regular. It was like
an engine heard at a great distance,
only this was felt, instead of heard. For
a long time he stood and tried to figure
it out. Then he looked ahead.

  Through a sudden rift in the blizzard
he made out a tiny black objept like a
small tank. He shouted and struggled
ahead. When he had reached it he
stopped and went up to it. It was a
sort of chimney that came out of the
deep snow. The top of it was a trap
door with a large handle on it whereby
it could be opened, he found after scrap-
ing away the snow.

  Kane was in no condition to wonder
about it. He tore at the handle and
found he could swing it open. He threw
it back, and then stared down. It was
dark inside. He dug out a match and
struck it. By its light he saw an iron
ladder going down the cylindrical wall.
He dropped the match, and in the in-
stant before it went out he saw that the
ladder went down into dim obscurity.

  Now he swung into it, clumsily be-
cause of his bulky clothing, and started
down into blackness. For long minutes
he continued to descend the iron rungs.
After a long time he made out some
sort of illumination. Looking down, he
made out an opalescent glow.

  Hurriedly, for all his weakness, the
young scientist climbed on. So intent
was he on not missing any rungs, that
he was unprepared for it when abruptly
his feet hit a floor. He swung around.
He was in a sort of vestibule. The walls
were apparently of slick ice, and the
floor the same. Ten feet from him was
a doorway Cut in the thick ice. He stag-
gered through it.

  In the next moment he was standing
stock-still, his eyes big with wonder-
ment. The scene before him was like
a setting from some unearthly fantasy.
He stood at the entrance to a great cav-
ern of ice. The ceiling was twenty or
UNDER THE NORTH POLE

83

thirty feet above the floor, and cut like
a mighty dome. Polished, slender pil-
lars of ice climbed from floor to roof.
The walls were jagged and irregular,
curving from where he stood in great
semi-circles that met again two hundred
feet from him.

  The floor was of ice, too, but rough-
ened in a serrated pattern that rendered
it less slippery. There was no visible
lighting equipment, but walls, floor and
ceiling were luminous with a soft, blue
light.

  Against the ice wall at his left was a
monstrous black mass of machinery that
rumbled and shook the whole place.
It was apparent now where the strange
pounding effect had come from. The
machinery was compact and powerful
looking, and motionless except for a
huge flywheel that spun swiftly and si-
lently.

  At the other side of the cavern a
tremendous coil, like a great corkscrew,
wound from beneath the floor into the
ceiling. The six-feet-thick coil was of
some steely-green material that defied
Kane’s efforts to place it.

  Stunned with the magnitude of the
scene, and with finding signs of a mod-
ern civilization this far north, Kane
shuffled silently ahead. His weary body
threatened to fail him completely as this
new burden of amazement was put on
it. And then, over the rumble of the
machinery, a woman’s cry echoed down
the hall.

  “Uncle! Someone’s in the door!”

/“'* EORGE KANE’S eyes rushed to
the point from which the sound
had come. His mouth dropped open.
One more marvel had been revealed in
this room of miracles—the most beauti-
ful woman the young scientist had ever
seen.

  She stood only twenty feet away,
with her hand against her throat in an
attitude of startled surprise. She had

just stepped from behind a pillar of ice
which had kept her from seeing him
before. Her small, shapely form was
clothed in a close-fitting jacket of fine
white fur and a flaring skirt of the same
material, with short Eskimo boots on
her small feet. Against the soft white
fur her dark hair was framed in deep
waves.

  Her lips made a small, surprised “o”
and the blue eyes were opened wide.

  From a door behind the girl hurried
three men. One of them was tall and
broad-shouldered, with a short, clipped
beard. His face was white and intense,
but it was the eyes which drew Kane’s
gaze. They burned below his craggy
black brows like chips of green fire.
They were filled with hate and ven-
geance. Suddenly his hand slid be-
neath the gray smock he wore and
jerked a gun free.

  The shocked anthropologist was too
startled to move. Through his weary
body flowed a sudden flood of inertia,
and of the desire to give up. Three
days of fighting snow and ice and bliz-
zard, two days without food, had not
prepared him for the rapid-fire trend
events were taking.

  As if time had been slowed down, he
saw the black-bearded man’s finger
tighten on the trigger of the pistol. He
stood stoically awaiting the roar of the
gun and the smashing impact of a bul-
let. But the bullet was not fired. Be-
tween them a small, white form flew.
The girl screamed, “Stop! Maybe he’s
not—”

  Kane swayed a little. He saw the
hammer of the gun pull back, inexor-
ably. Then the great cavern seemed to
explode, and he was pitching down into
blue depths of glacial ice.. . .

CHAPTER II
Below the Pole

  A FTER a long time Kane’s mind
seemed to climb back to the
■*- things of reality. He had no de-
sire to open his eyes, for he was tired
clear through. When finally he looked
around him, he saw he had been moved.
The room he was in >yas small, but
carved from ice as the cavern had been.
He got one elbow beneath him and
forced himself up.

  “How do you feel?” someone asked
quietly. It was the soft, friendly voice
of the girl.

  He whirled to see her standing near
the head of the cot he lay on. There
was deep concern in the depths of her
dark eyes.

  Kane shook his head. “Weak,” he
muttered. “And hungry!” He said
the last with such emphasis that the
girl laughed.

  “I was expecting that,” she told him.
“If you think you can get into the next
room I’ll fix you all the ham and eggs
you can eat.”

  Ham and eggs! George Kane was
dragging himself from the bed in a sec-
ond, a steaming vision of the food be-
fore him. He strode after her into the
small dining room. In a few minutes
he was seated at a long table stuffing
himself with the warm, vitalizing food.
He war. too starved to wonder at these
delicacies as far north as this.

  While he ate, the three men he had
seen before—including the one who had
been intent on .killing him—came in
and sat near him, watching wordlessly.
Kane looked them over while he ate.
The first man seemed to have cooled
down considerably. His expression was
cold and hostile.

  The other men consisted of a long,
bony individual with a gaunt, white

face, and a short, stocky man with a
heavily bearded face and a completely
bald head.

  The scientist’s eyes kept coming back
to the thin, cruel face of the man who
was obviously the leader. There was a
familiar cast to the high cheek-bones
and the sunken, green eyes. And the
way the dark hair was bushy at the
sides and nearly flat on top struck a
responding chord in his memory.

  When at last he laid down his fork
and pushed back his chair, the other
spoke. “Be good enough to tell us who
you are,” he clipped.

  Kane shot him a hostile look. “I’m
George Kane,” he said shortly. “I got
separated from my party two days
ago, after an expedition to Prince of
Wales Island, and I was lucky enough
to stumble on this place. Now maybe
you’ll be good enough Jo tell me why I
was almost greeted with a bullet?”

  The other shrugged and a bleak smile
touched his lips. “We have enemies,”
he said simply. “In the surprise of see-
ing you here, I mistook you for one
of them. I must apologize for the rude
reception you received. But that is
finished.” He gestured at the two men
near him. “Villers and Cahill, my as-
sistants,” he introduced, without turn-
ing his head. “I am Henry Cameron,
and this is my niece, Sharon.”

  Henry Cameron! Kane caught his
breath. At last he remembered the man.
Henry Cameron had received the Nobel
Prize three years ago for his work in
steel. He had made the first revolu-
tionary discovery in years, the inven-
tion of a process by which steel and
iron could be magnetized to a point
almost unbelievable. His process had
outmoded, in a few months, the great
electromagnets used in stnel mills for
carrying great pieces of iron. A piece
of his metal one-tenth the size of for-
mer magnets could do the work of an
electromagnet, and obviate the neces-
UNDER THE NORTH POLE

85

sity for expensive current. Cameron had
made millions in two years.

/'"'■AMERON’S shrewd eyes caught
^ the recognition that lighted the
other's face. Quietly he said, “How
sOon can you leave?”

  “Uncle!” Sharon Cameron broke in.
“How can you ask that when Mr. Kane
has just recovered long enough to eat
one meal?”

  Cameron’s eyes avoided hers. After
a moment he shrugged, “Very well. I
think after two days you should be suf-
ficiently recovered to go on. The storm
will be over by then, and I’ll see that
you have food enough to carry you to
the settlement.” But there was a veiled
menace in his eyes that the younger
man did not miss. He nodded at the
girl. “I’m sure my niece will be glad
to show you around.”

  Followed by the other two men, the
tall Cahill and stocky Villers, he strode
out.

  Sharon tried to explain. “My uncle
is very—brusque to strangers,*” she
stammered. “I’m sure you’ll be wel-
come to stay as long as you like, after
he knows you better.”

  Kane^ot up and took 9 deep breath.
The strength seemed to come surging
back into his body as the warm food
brought a welcome glow to him. He
stood tall and erect, a rather lanky fig-
ure. His eyes were whimsical as he
said, “If he shoots at men when he’s
being brusque, I’d hate to get him
mad! He might not miss, next time.”

  A smile parted the girl’s rich lips.
Then, turning, she said, “Perhaps
you’d like to see more of this unearthly
place you’ve stumbled into. Come
along.”

  At her heels, George Kane stalked
out through a short hall into the im-
mense cavern.

  “Tell me one thing,” he said ear-
nestly, as he caught up with her. “Just

what and why is all this? Who built it,
or carved it, and what does it do?”
“To begin at the first question,”
Sharon smiled, “the caverns were cut
out by a tribe of Eskimos my uncle
brought here to do the work. I never
saw them, because I’ve only been here
a month myself. Uncle sent for me just
after it was finished. As to why this is
—it’s some big oil scheme he has on.
It seems he discovered an immense
pocket of oil up here, and he’s built his
own plant right over it. That’s the
pump over there,” she went on, indi-
cating the bulky mass of machinery.
“It’s— I don’t know how powerful, but
it dr£ws up oil from about eight miles
down.”

  “Eight miles!” Kane gasped.

  “Yes. The pump is especially built to
do the work.”

  “What’s the—coil, or whatever it
is?” Kane asked. “Some sort of still?”
Sharon smiled and walked over to
the Gargantuan coil of greenish steel or
whatever metal it was. It looked like
some monstrous enclosed circular stair-
case that wound down into the bowels
of the earth. “That’s the one thing I
can’t quite understand,” she told him.
“My uncle says it has something to do
with distilling the oil.”

  “It doesn’t look like any—”

  At that moment a step sounded be-
hind them. Villers stood close to Kane,
a crafty smile on his fleshy lips. His
squat, ugly body was relaxed in easy
self-confidence. “Miss Cameron is
right,” he said, “it is a special process
of Mr. Cameron’s for refining the
crude petroleum.”

A SUDDEN impulse came to the
other man to call him a liar. Ob-
viously there was something hidden
here Cameron didn’t want discussed.
He stifled the desire, and asked, “When
did Cameron become interested in oil?
I thought he was a steel man?”
86

DYNAMIC Science Stories

  “Did you?” Villers said, and left it
there. “I was afraid Miss Cameron
might forget to tell you one thing, so
I’ll let you know myself. You are at
liberty to go anywhere you like in the
upper part of the structure, but Mr.
Cameron prefers that you don’t go any
farther past the coil. The machinery
in the interior is rather complicated.
You might hurt something—or get hurt
yourself.” With that he strode off.

  Kane watched him go, frowning, and
then turned to the girl. “If you don’t
mind,” he said quickly, “I think I’ll
shave and clean up.”

  Sharon said quickly, “Forgive me for
not asking you. The room you’re to
use is the one we brought you to after
this morning. You’ll find everything
you need there.” With unconscious
nervousness, she brushed hastily at a
curl that strayed over her smooth fore-
head.

  Kane mumbled, “Thanks,” and left
her.

  Back in his room he took a long time
shaving, heating the water in a little al-
cohol stove. His mind puzzled over the
strange world into which he had
dropped. He was sure Cameron was
no more interested in oil than he was,
and yet there was little doubt that the
machinery in the ice hall was to pump
something from the ground. The
thought came to him that for a man
who had made the remarkable discov-
ery that he had in steel, he forgot it in
a hurry.

  A glimmer of suspicion came to him
that this might revolve about the
rumors he had heard not long ago that
the new metal was not working out so
well. After a year of use, the metal
seemed to lose its remarkable magnetic
power and require further processing
by Henry Cameron’s laboratories—at
Cameron’s own expense. But—they
were only rumors. They might be com-
pletely unfounded.

  At last, shrugging, he decided his im-
agination was carrying him away.
Cameron’s explanations were probably
true: He was here to drill oil, and nat-
urally jealous enough of his discovery
to be quick to challenge any stranger
who entered the caverns.

  Putting away his shaving things,
Kane prepared to explore the place fur-
ther. Perhaps a look around would jus-
tify him in thinking definitely one way
or the other. He found that the back
door of his room opened on a hall he
had not yet been in.

  Aimlessly, he wandered down it,
until he wasn’t quite sure where he
was. Seeing a door ajar, he shoved it
open and walked in. His mind was so
taken up with the mysteries around
him that he almost stumbled over
Sharon without seeing her. She was
huddled in a chair, her arm flung over
the back of it and her face pressed into
the hollow of her elbow. Her slim
shoulders shook with sobs. A soft sound
of crying, of miserable, heart-wrung
crying, came to Kane.

  He strode forward impulsively. He
was touched strangely by the girl’s
grief, more so than he would have im-
agined a girl’s crying could affect him
after so short an acquaintance.

  “Here, here!” he said warmly. “It
can’t be that bad!”

  Sharon started and jerked around in
the chair. Her face was white and tear-
stained, her lower lip quivering. “Oh!”
she gasped, in a muffled little voice. “I
—I—”

  Kane went closer to her. His face
looked young and rugged, and yet very
kindly, but there was a depth of feeling
in his expression that was not all pity.

  “If it’s none of my business,” he told
her, “just say so, but—if I can help, I
wish you’d let me.”

CHARON CAMERON looked away
^ and stood up. She went over to
UNDER THE NORTH POLE

87

where a small packing bag lay open.
For a long time she stared down at it,
and then suddenly she turned and
burst out helplessly, “I don’t know
what’s the matter. If I did, perhaps I
could do something about it. But—”
she shrugged despairingly, “I do know
my uncle isn’t here to drill for oil. It’s
something a lot bigger than that.”

  Kane grinned, “I’m glad there’s
somebody else who thinks there’s
something rotten in Franklin’s terri-
tory. I thought maybe it was nerves on
my part.” Then, more seriously, he
asked, “Tell me—just what do you
know about your uncle’s affair here?
Do you have any actual reason to fear
him, or merely intuitions?”

  Sharon glanced at the bag she had
been packing. “I’ve got enough intu-
itions, at least, to be ready to risk my
life getting away,” she said decidedly.
“I’ve stood all of this 'unofficial cap-
tive’ business I can. Just outside the
tunnel, in the snow. I’ve got enough
concentrated food tablets I stole from
the supply to last a month.”

  Kane nodded slowly, “If I may use
such language of your kinfolk, I think
Henry Cameroon is trying to pull the
well-known wool over our eyes.”

  “You certainly may,” Sharon came
back. “I never could understand his
wanting me to cOme here anyway.
Lately I’ve decided why he did it. He
probably decided he’d told me too
much abolit his affairs here, and
wanted to keep me from telling any
more by staying down in civilization.
He told me before that he was going to
Victoria Island, and now he keeps test-
ing me to find out if I told anyone else.
Unfortunately, I didn’t.”

  For a minute Kane looked thought-
fully at her. “Just where are we, any-
way?” he wanted to know at last.

  “Don’t you kndw?” the girl asked in
surprise. “W e ’ r e on—or under—
Boothia Peninsula.”

  “Boothia Peninsula!” gasped the
scientist. “But that means—we’re
under the magnetic North Pole!”

CHAPTER III
One Hundred Dead Men

“T KNOW,” Sharon shrugged. “But
!'J I’fti sure I don’t know what it
all means. The whole thing’s a
mystery to me.”

  Kane was silent. After a while he
said, “I’m thinking the only place we
can find the answer is in the part of the
cavern we’re not supposed to go into.
Which adds up to one thing—I’m going
in there right now and have a look for
myself!”

  “Oh, you mustn’t!” the girl cried,
laying her hand on his arm. Her azure
eyes earnestly probed the depths of his.
“If he caught you there, he might kill
you. There’s something—something
he’s guarding with his life in there.”
“Just the same,” Kane said finally,
“I’m convinced that it’s no less dan-
gerous to wait here than it would be to
go into the forbidden rooms. But f
want your promise that you won’t try
to escape before I get back. Then, if
I find Cameron is as crazy as I think he
is, we’ll go together.”

  With the girl’s promise still in his
ears, he threaded his way to the other
section of the cavern in the glacial ice.
He chose the narrowest and least used
halls to go by, anxious to avoid Cam-
eron or his assistants. Everywhere the
light seemed even and soft, leading
Kane to suspect some sort of phosphor-
escent material fused into the ice.

  Suddenly, he rounded a narrow turn
and came into a hall about half as large
as the first. The rounding ice walls
gleamed coldly about him. In the spa-
cious room there was a battery of shin-
88

DYNAMIC Science Stories

ing instrument panels down one wall,
another wall lined with faintly hum-
ming machinery, and a series of door-
ways on the other two walls.

  Kane shot a look about to make sure
he was alone, then slid into the room.
Swiftly he went to the instruments. He
found after a quick look that most of
them were unfamiliar to him, consist-
ing of pressure gauges and tachom-
eters.

  Then, down the wall, he discovered
a frosted glass panel like a scanning
screen, set flush with the ice wall. At
the lower corner of it was a small red
button. Kane hesitated, and then his
curiosity got the better of him. His fin-
ger went out and pressed against the
button.

  Instantly the board lighted up. Kane
recognized it as a detailed geologist’s
map. There were various colored
strata of ice, earth, oil, and other for-
mations. He bent closer, his lips light
against his teeth as he studied it. He
caught a breath.

  The labels were frequent—and in
the brief words the young scientist read
something that made his heart hammer
and his pulses throb in his ears. The
diagram was accurately scaled, so that
he could read it easily. About seven
miles down there was a thick layer la-
belled, “Magnetic Iron Deposit!”
Kane’s eyes flashed on down to the oil
strata. He found that the level of oil
in it was indicated by a movable black
line, and that certain marks denoted
the level on other days. By them, he
read that in the last six months the oil
had been reduced from a depth of one
mile to about a hundred feet!

  His mind raced. He saw how thin
the layers were between oil and mag-
netic iron deposits, and between oil
and the space below it—which seemed
to be merely a bottomless chasm! All
at once Kane stepped back and gasped,
“Magnetic—why didn’t I guess it!”

1170R the whole story was right there

*	on the scanning screen. If all of the
oil were drained from below the de-
posit of iron, the slightest jar would
send the two-mile thick layer crashing
down far into the bowels of the earth,
to come to rest perhaps twenty-five
miles below the surface. And unless he
was very much wrong, it was that layer
of magnetized iron that solved the age-
old riddle of why compasses point
north! The great body of iron would
exert a tremendous attraction as far
south as the equator, where some simi-
lar deposit must cause the Southern
Magnetic Pole attraction.

  Abruptly, George Kane whirled
from the glowing screen and started
across the floor. There was no time to
lose. He must now find Cameron and
the others and stop them somehow, be-
fore their disastrous plan could take ef-
fect.

  And then, right in the middle of the
floor, he jerked to a sudden stop. He
stared down at the ice floor with an ex-
pression of utter horror on his drawn
features.

  In the ice beneath he could see the
bodies of scores of men! Their fea-
tures were plain in the light suffusing
them. Pain, desperation were frozen
into their countenances. Staring eyes
struck up at him in a way that froze
him with horror, and wide open mouths
seemed about to shriek for help. There
were at least a hundred men in the ice
most of them clutching pickaxes or
other tools. All of them were Eskimos.

  Before Kane could recover from the
shock, a footstep grated in back of him.
Someone said icily, “You find the bodies
interesting, Mr. Kane?”

  The anthropologist whirled. “Cam-
eron!” he jerked. And then, in a flood
of anger, “So this is why you wanted
no one in here! You wanted nobody to
see what became of the poor victims
whom you hired to build your ice palace
UNDER THE NORTH POLE

—and then buried in the ice by flooding
■the chasm they were digging in!”

  Cameron’s face was a stolid mask.
The green eyes blazed under his shaggy
brows, the only touch of emotion in his
countenance.

  ‘‘You are very discerning,” he
breathed.

  “Yes—discerning enough to know
the insane scheme yon are trying to
work here!” Kane scourged. “You’re
planning to cause the great magnetic
iron deposit that you’ve discovered to
drop so deeply that it will be ineffectual.
But why in God’s name do you want to
do it, Cameron? Why should you want
to throw the compasses of the world
off, to ruin the most valuable means
that man has of guiding him in difficult
places?”

  “Because.” the steel man grated, “I
intend to recoup my losses of the last
year and sustain an income no one can
ever take from me. It has cost me a
fortune to recharge the metal I sold.
But since then I have found why it
failed. Now I’m going to be paid back.
I’ll be paid back for all eternity. Be-
cause while I am alive the worid will
have to pdy me to sustain a magnetic
pole, and after I am gone—the world
will have to learn to go by the stars once
more!

  “Their gyro compasses are useless in
most cases. So they will be completely
helpless without me. And all because
they don’t realize a small amount of
heat will sustain the metal for years.
A thousand degrees would charge it per-
manently. But they won’t know that
—because you’ll never live to tell it!”

  As the full import of the other’s
words struck him, George Kane sprang
forward and crashed against him. Both
men were carried onto the hard ice
floor. Kane’s fists clubbed into the
other's fafce as he sought to overpower
him. He felt hard blows rock his head
with dizzying pain.

IN the next moment something hard

*	shoved into the back of his neck.
Villers snarled. “One more trick and
I’ll fire!”

  The scientist relaxed and turned his
head, to see the stocky assistant’s glow-
ering face close to his. He got up slow-

ly-

  Cameron got to his feet and faced
him angrily. “That will earn you a
more horrible end than I had planned,”
he gritted. “For the present you can re-
flect on a slow death in a. block of ice—
with only a small hose leading to your
mouth to sustain life—until the ice
crushes you. Within a few hours, you
will have the doubtful pleasure of ex-
periencing it. But not before you see
something you can carry to your death
with you.” He gestured to Villers.
“Take him to the room.”

  Without a chance to raise a hand in
his own behalf, he was prodded out of
the room by his guard and led away.
“The room” proved to be a small cu-
bical space in the floor with a huge
chunk of ice for a door to it. Kane wrs
rudely shoved into it, and the door slid
back into place. He saw at a glance
that there would be no escaping this
dungeon. The walls were too slick for
him to ascend to the opening. In de-
spaiV, he watched, through thick ice, the
vague form of his jailer moving away.

CHAPTER IV
When the Ice Cracked

FOR two hours he was kept there,
while he tortured himself with
worries and fears. Bitterly he re-
gretted his foolhardy attempt to dis-
arm Cameron, for it had changed his
position from that of a tolerated fool to
a condemned enemy. The game had
been even more dangerous than he
90

DYNAMIC Science Stories

thought; one error had resulted in his
being thrown here in this freezing-cold
cubicle to await death.

  And while he shivered here in the
semi-gloom, Cameron and his aides
were preparing virtually to enslave a
world. Whatever his plan was, Kane
knew it was almost at the culmination
point. The other’s statement that he
would not die, until he had seen some-
thing he could remember as he died,
proved that.

  And yet, with a whole world about to
be plunged into slavery to Henry Cam-
eron, the young scientist found himself
worrying far more about Sharon than
he was about the world’s millions! He
conjured up her face and her trim little
fur-clad figure before him, and then
anxious fears would change the smiling
face to one of terror. What did Cam-
eron have in store for her? He was too
suspicious a man to risk letting her tell
all she knew about his work. Some
stray bit of knowledge she had picked
up might give away his secret, might
free men from the necessity of his pres-
ence in order to process the coil.

  Kane’s mind rebelled at thinking of
what might happen to her. He was far
more worried about the girl than he
was about himself; he found, during
those anxious hours in the dungeon,
that she had come to mean a very great
deal to him.

  After what seemed an eternity, Ca-
hill and Villers returned and swung the
block of ice from the trapdoor. They
lowered a rope to him and permitted
him to clamber out. Cahill stuck his
evil, bony face close to his and rasped,
“We’ve got a special treat for you
Kane. Cameron decided it would be
cruel to make you die alone. He’s go-
ing to let the girl go with you!”

  Kane’s heart swam in shock and ha-
tred. He clenched his fists and bit out
savagely, “If ever a cowardly, murder-
ous pack of rats lived—■”

  Villers’ fat paw slapped across his
mouth, cutting off the angry flood of
words. “Save your energy to fight the
ice block when it begins to crush you.”
Together they hauled him along.
Swiftly he was carried back to the
great hall in which the pump and coil
were stationed. Suddenly Kane real-
ized that the pump was no longer throb-
bing. He guessed the reason—that the
huge oil pocket was empty at last, leav-
ing space for the mass of iron to tumble
into the bowels of the earth. Cameron
was standing near the coil, by a black
box fixed in the wall. Sharon stood
near him. a small, frightened figure.

  Kane was shoved to her side. Im-
pulsively he reached out and grasped
her hand. Her answering squeeze
warmed his heart, and gave him the
courage to smile. His eyes promised
her hope that his lips could never have
uttered, for there was only despair in
his heart.

  Now Cameron strode before them,
his face triumphant and cruel. “One
small thing remains to be done,” he
smiled. “And when I press that switch
it will be finished. A charge of dyna-
mite now rests far down in our oil line.
When I send it off, the iron will drop
—forever.”	f

  Kane watched his white face, study-
ing the green eyes that burned coldly.
“I’m warning you,” he began, “that if
you go on—”

  “Condemned men are in no position
to give warnings,” Cameron snapped.
“In your position, one usually pleads.
But you two will not even have the sat-
isfaction of doing that. For I am going
to finish my work before your very eyes,
and then—then you will go to join those
Eskimos you were admiring.”

  Sharon’s eyes flashed to his. “What—
what does he mean?” she asked.

   EORGE KANE guessed that she
   had not been told what was in
UNDER THE NORTH POLE

91

store for them. He said: “Nothing that
will concern us. Not if he goes on with
his plans, at least. Cameron, if you
weren’t half crazy with ego, you’d real-
ize what you’re doing.”

  “I realize fully,” the other chilled.
“I haven’t spent a year laboring in this
hole without knowing what I was
about.” He broke off and strode to the
black box on the wall just beyond the
huge green coil. He raised his hand to
it. He flashed a bleak smile at the two
men who stood at either side of the
captives, their guns trained on them.
Slowly his fingers commenced pressing
the switch in.

  Kane lurched forward with a warn-
ing crowding his lips, to be brought up
by his two guards. “You fool!” he
shouted. “You’ll bring this whole place
crashing down if you go on. You’ll kill
yourself as well as the rest of us!”

  But Henry Cameron’s hand con-
tinued steadily to close the circuit that
would set off the charge of dynamite
miles below them. His lips parted
briefly to counter, “Your ravings are
useless, Kane. I know enough of geol-
ogy to be sure that the ice layer is far
too thick to crack.”

  The hissing breathing of Cahill was
sibilant in young Kane’s ears as the
bony aide hunched forward. His
chalky white face was ghastly in its
drawn intensity, making his eyes ap-
pear like hollow sockets. At his other
side Villers strained ahead, his fleshy
lips pursed. And then Cameron’s body
stiffened as he drove the knife switch
home.

  In the great cavern of ice not a sound
was heard. There was a faint crackling
as the current was closed, and then the
hall became as soundless as a cata-
comb. For seconds, the five who
waited hung motionless. Abruptly,
through the solid floor of ice, a faint
tremor was felt. The gigantic coil quiv-
ered a little, like a chiming spring that

has been struck. Then a low rumble
seemed to sound from walls and ceiling,
and the floor quivered slightly.

  Over Cameron’s face, pale now,
came a frown of puzzlement. His hand
came slowly away from the switch box.
His eyes sought those of the others, but
his tight lips uttered no sound.

  And then a wave of violent jerking
passed through the ice cavern. From
the ceiling came a fine mist of ice chips.
Long lines of cleavage shot, zig-zagging,
through the floor under their feet as the
miles-deep ice cracked. Shrill raspings
filled the hall as age-old ice was ripped
apart.

  The cavern in the ice was crashing
into ruins!

  The tension broke. Cameron shouted
something and darted to the coil,
braced his body against it as though to
stop its mad quivering. Cahill and Vil-
lers ran to his side. The three of them,
like children who seek to hold back a
breaking dam, threw their weight
against the tons of green steel that
shook and jerked.

  Kane turned to the girl, who was
frozen with fear. “We’ve got to get out
of here!” he shouted, over the thunder
of sliding ice. But within him he held
no hope that they would ever climb
from the crushing death that was clos-
ing in on them.

A CROSS the cavern’s floor a white
line shot, tracing a path between
the man and girl and the three who
fought the coil. Down its length a great
chasm opened up, ten feet wide. Kane
was left on the very edge of it, staring
like a sleepwalker into the blue depths
that yawned before him. His face
blanched as he gaped at the bottomless
wedge that slid down through miles of
ice. Then he whirled and grasped the
girl’s hand. “Come on!” he cried.
“We’ve got to make the tunnel before
we’re cut off 1”
92

DYNAMIC Science Stories

  He half dragged Sharon with him as
he crossed towards the entrance. But
even as they started ahead, a deafening
roar sounded close behind them. Kane
spun about to see what new peril
threatened them. His eyes widened as
he watched the scene across the chasm.

  The coil had torn loose from its base
two miles below, and with ominous ac-
celeration it was sinking down. The ice
screamed as it ripped through. Cam-
eron and the others reeled back from
the jagged hole that had been torn by
the coil. Cracks shot through the ice
all about them. As one man they turned
and ran back towards the others.

  Too late they saw the chasm between
them and the hope of safety. But there
was no other way out for them now.
Already the ceiling was raining large
chunks of ice down on them, and in a
few seconds the whole place would be
filled with jagged blocks of crushing
ice. With a desperate leap Henry Cam-
eron launched himself over the gaping
canyon. As one man, the others flung
themselves at the opposite side.

  Kane’s stomach felt cold and sick as
he saw them hurtle over the pit. Cam-
eron’s shoulders were hunched, his
arms bent, hands clawing, as he stared
down at the death miles below. Sud-
denly his feet struck the other side,
barely touching the edge. He tried to
take a step, twisted, bent backwards as
the slick ice failed to give him footing.
His hands clawed madly at the air as
his long body teetered back. And then,
in a moment, he was gone.

  From the cold depths a chilling
scream ricocheted up at them, filling the
cavern with mad echoes. Before the
sounds died, Cahill and Villers crashed
to their deaths behind him. Both men
were too frozen with fear to utter a
sound. Not a whisper came from the
dark void after the echoes of Camer-
on’s shriek faded away.

  With a violent jerk George Kane

shook off the cold fingers of horror that
clutched him. He whirled and swept up
the girl in his arms and dashed for the
tunnel, just as a thousand-pound block
of glacial ice crashed to the floor on the
spot where they had stood.

  Like a drunken man he stumbled and
reeled. The floor heaved beneath him,
threatening to throw him down. The
slender pillars snapped like icicles. A
rumbling sound gave evidence that the
oi! machinery had dropped through the
floor. Kane’s whole body was a tight
mass of bunched nerves. He fought the
terror that would slow his legs down
and doom them to a horrible death.

  The exit loomed up before him, then
he sprung through and was dashing for
the iron ladder. The walls were frosty
with spider-web lines that betrayed
their crumbling. It seemed minutes
that he struggled towards the black hole
that would mean salvation, though it
was only seconds. His ears rang with
the rumbling thunder all about.

  All at once the ladder was before
him. He set the girl down and some-
how got her started up it. Swiftly he
followed. The ladder seemed a thing
alive beneath his hands and feet.
Lurchings and shakings threatened to
dislodge both of them. But fear gave
strength to their muscles and carried
them on.

A FTER an eternity of climbing, the
trapdoor loomed before them and
Sharon’s hands thrust it upward. The
harsh Arctic light streamed in on them.
George Kane followed her out into the
snow. Absently he noted the little pile
of provisions the girl had brought out
early that day.

  The rumbling had almost stopped
now. Only faint undulations of the
ground evidenced the hell that had
taken place below. Kane’s legs were
weak as he turned to the girl. She was
crying softly with relief.
UNDER THE NORTH POLE

  Somehow the young scientist’s arms
stole about her shoulders and drew her
near him. “It’s all right now,” he mur-
mured. “The cave-in won’t come any
farther. It was just the ice that was
affected. With the food you brought
out this morning, we can get away from
this place and reach Spence Bay in two
days.”

  After a moment the girl’s voice, muf-
fled because her face was buried in the
hollow of his shoulder and neck, said:
“But what happened? I thought he
said the ice couldn’t slip?”

  “It wouldn’t have,” Kane said, “ex-
cept that he forgot something—the fric-
tion that would be produced by all that
slipping iron. The friction created tre-
mendous heat and melted the lower ice.
That brought the whole place down.
And when that happened—Henry Cam-
eron’s plans were spoiled. He failed in
what he was attempting.”

  “You mean—” Sharon’s face tipped
up to his querulously. “You mean the
pole hasn’t been destroyed?”

  “The original one was, all right. It’s
about twenty-five miles down, now, and
useless. But Cameron told me some-
thing before he imprisoned me. He
told me he’d discovered that all the
metal needs, in order to have the mag-
netism fixed, is to be heated up to about
a thousand degrees. Right now that
huge coil of his is slipping down and
heating itself far above that! In other
words, only a few hours will elapse be-
fore the magnetic North Pole is restored
for good.”

  Sharon was silent. After a moment
Kane said, with the first smile that
had touched his face for hours. “Per-
sonally, I wouldn’t mind standing like
this for the rest of my life, but I’m
afraid we’d freeze. We’d better start
for the settelment. We’ve a long walk
ahead of us.”

  The girl’s blue eyes smiled up at him,
with no trace of the horror that had
drenched them a short time ago. “At
le^st,” she said softly, “it will give us
plenty of time to get acquainted! ”

CEASELESS rain dripped from
the low-hanging clouds, only to
rise again in wisps of steam as it
struck the gleaming sidewalks. From
the fetid green Venusian jungles that
encircled the town, drifted brightly col-
ored spores, like bits of confetti, float-
ing lightly in the thick mist. Death to
anyone whose lungs they entered, for
the spores feasted on human tissue.
Multiplying with frightful rapidity,
they choked the lungs, the blood stream,
causing swift, sure death.

  Jim Weston, standing under the
overhang of a grey crystalloid building,
adjusted the spore-mask that covered

Quick-rooting Jetinis weeds sprouted
from between chinks in the sagging ma-
sonry, forced apart the massive stones
of the docks. A few crystalloid ware-
houses and grain elevators, a wet, scum-
covered administration building, several
slatternly, patched-plated tramps, lying
like huge grey slugs in the slimy mud of
the landing field. The only signs of life
about the space-port emanated, in the
form of tawdry multiphone music, from
a little cafe sandwiched between two
warehouses. Jim made his way toward
it, pushed open the door, stepped into
the cafe’s tiny spore-lock. After a five
minute soaking in germicide-laden air,

A space-trtp from Venus to Earth was what Jim Weston wanted — what he got was a
shanghaied trip on a Mars-bound rocket, as a member of Saturnian Slane's slave-erew. And
when they crashed on Mars' red desert, to be made captives of the torture-loving Vens,
this Earth-man showed a Saturnian bully that on any planet it's guts, not size, that makes

the man!

his mouth and nose, eyed the opaque
fog with a disconsolate shake of his
head. Venus in all its doubtful glory!
It made a man feel as though he had
been tossed into a giant’s cauldron of
stewing spinach. Jim’s hands touched
the heavy lead container strapped to his
belt. Twenty ounces of radium, his pay
as chief engineer on the Jovian aque-
duct job. Enough to take him to Earth
a hundred times over . . . and he was
forced to stay in this steaming hell-hole
until a terrestial-bound ship made port!
Which might be months, with the Venu-
sian grain trade so slack of late. Two
years fighting mud, gravity, and meth-
ane gas on the oozy surface of Jupiter,
the maddeningly long Jovian-Venus
space trip, and now the prospect of
months on this green hot-house planet.
Jim sighed dismally, set out in the di-
rection of the space port. Perhaps the
captain of one of those rusty freighters
now unloading at the docks might be
persuaded to make this trip to
Earth. . . .

  The space port was a desolate sight.

he slapped the dead spores from his
coat, stepped through the inner en-
trance.

  The tavern was worse, Jim thought,
than even the dives of Jupiter. Smoke
from a dozen strange narcotics dimmed
the light of the radite lamps; the too-
sweet odor of Venusian thole mingled
with the smell of Martian tong and Ter-
restrial whisky; pallid, overly made-up
women, all but nude in their sheer cel-
losilk dresses, sat hopefully at tables,
sipping apparently endless glasses of
thole. The men who lined the bar were
for the most part space-hands, tiny red-
skinned Martians, squat Jovians, and
nondescript waifs from the asteroids,
the moons of Saturn. Jim stepped up
to the rail, beckoned to the bartender.

  “Where can I get information on
those freighters outside?” he demanded.
“I want to ship out of this green hell.”

  Before the bartender could answer, a
heavy hand fell upon Jim’s shoulder.

  “Ship out?” a deep voice boomed.
“You’ve come to the right place lad. I’m
Slane, skipper of the Astric. As soon
96

DYNAMIC Science Stories

as I can muster up a crew from among
these rats, I’m leaving for Mars.”

  Jim glanced up at the owner of the
deep voice. The man was huge, nearly
seven feet tall and amazingly broad in
proportion. His arms were long, gor-
illa-like, and the sweat-soaked shirt,
clinging damply to his skin, revealed
great rippling muscles that spoke of in-
human strength. The giant was, to
judge from his narrow, reddish eyes,
his absolutely hairless head, a Saturn-
ian; his neck still bore the reddish chafe
of a Svenson helmet. Most significant
of all, his wrists were circled with wide
silvery scars, scars that could only have
been made by the tightly welded fetters
of the Saturnian prison colony. Clearly
the big man’s past had been a check-
ered one.

  “Well?” Slane’s coarse features
broke into an expansive grin. “Out-
ward appearances don’t hold for ships
nor men. You'll find the Astric a tidy
craft and me a thoughtful skipper.
Come, lad, I need men to replace those
of my crew who were knocked off by
these blasted Venusian spores. You’re
a bit scrawny” ... his gaze swept
Jim’s slender, wiry frame . . . “but
beggars can't be choosers. We’ll sign
articles, all fair and square, and you’ll
get fifty thacls when we land on Mars.”

TIM eyed the man narrowly. There

  was something in his tone, a cunning
persuasiveness, that did not ring quite
true.

  “Mars?” he shook his head. “Earth’s
my destination. And I didn’t figure on
working my way. Small difference be-
tween Mar’s red-hot deserts and this
fever-ridden pest hole. What I’ve been
dreaming of these three years is the cool
sweet fields of Earth.”

  “A passenger!” Slane’s red eyes be-
came mere slits. “That smacks of
money. Earth’s none too healthy for
me just now, my little friend, but per-

haps for a price. . . .” He picked up
his spore-mask from the bar, turned to-
ward the door. “Hardly a matter to
discuss in this thieves’ nest. Outside
on the decks we’ll have privacy. Come
along.”

   Jim hesitated, reached for his mask.
No harm in hearing the man’s proposal.
Nodding, he followed the Saturnian
through the doorway.

   The space port was still deserted, dis-
mal in the steady rain. Some twenty
yards from the little tavern Slane
paused.

  “Well?” Jim’s voicc was muffled by
the thin mask. “What’s the proposi-
tion?”

   “Just . . . this!” Slane’s huge fist
lashed upward with paralyzing force,
caught the earthman flush on the jaw.
Jim felt only the merest fraction of a
second’s pain before he lapsed into dark
unconsciousness.

   The first thing that Jim Weston saw,
on opening his eyes, was a rusty, rivet-
studded bulkhead. All at once he real-
ized that he was lying on a rude bunk,
that he was held there by some terrible,
invisible force. And then an explana-
tion surged through his cloudy brain.
He was on a space ship, pinned to his
bunk by the force of the vessel’s accel-
eration ! Jim lay back weakly, tried to
piece together the puzzle.

  It was perhaps ten minutes before
the ship’s speed became constant and
the force of acceleration slackened, died
away. Jim was just struggling into a
sitting position when a door slammed
and Slane entered the room.

   “Still lolling in bed?”' The giant’s
voice was harsh. “Bah! You earlh-
men are all weaklings! Up, and get to
work!” He seized Jim’s arm, dragged
him from the bunk.

  Weston stood for a moment, un-
steadily, shook his head in an attempt
to clear it. Suddenly he noticed a heavy
lead container strapped to Slane’s belt,
THE STRONGER

97

a container marked with the initials J.
W.

  “My radium!” he muttered. “You
. . . you’ve stolen. . . .”

  “Ugly word, stolen.” The Saturnian
laughed mockingly. “The radium’s my
fee for taking you to Mars. Of course,
you’ll have to work, with us short-
handed. A months chipping rust’ll
make a man of you.”

  Weston stared contemptuously at the
captain of the As trie.

  “Yes,” he said coldly. “Just what
I’d expect of you. A stupid Saturnian
bully, with the brains of a. . .

  Slane’s hand, open-palmed, smashed
across Jim’s lips, sent him spinning
across the room.

  “Maybe that'll showf you who’s boss
on this ship!” he bellowed. “Go for-
ward, you lily-livered terrestrial scum,
and report to the mate! Lively, now,
or I’ll break you like a matchstick!”

  He grinned, hooking his thumbs over
his belt, and shot a stream'of blue lecl
in the direction of the sandbox. Legs
planted wide, chin thrust forward bel-
ligerently, he glared at the earthman.

  “I’m strong, see,” he grated.
“Stronger than you or any of these rats
aboard! Just remember that!”

  Jim Weston looked the big man over,
broke into a sudden harsh laugh.

  “Sure,” he murmured. “Sure. The
stronger. . . Still laughing, he
turned, made his way forward.

  The weeks that followed were a cruel
delirium to the members of the As trie’s
crew. Rotting food, filthy quarters,
long hours of toil . . . and Slane.
More than anything else the presence
of the captain tortured them. Here a
half-starved wretch, pausing for a mo-
ment after hours of chipping in cramped
positions, would hear sudden oaths, feel
the Saturnian’s thorium- soled boot
crash against his skinny cbest. Here an
emaciated oiler, complaining to his
mates of the stinking food, the lousy,

dirt-encrusted bedding, would find him-
self lifted by herculean arms, shaken
until his teeth rattled. And as, whim-
pering, they begged for mercy, Slane
wsuld taunt them, call them cowards,
weaklings. Only once had there been
a show of resistance to his brutality; a
broad-shouldered Jovian engineer,
goaded into sudden fury, had turned on
him, brandishing a heavy slice-bar.
Ten minutes later the Jovian’s mangled
body, back broken, arms dislocated, had
been tossed from the air-lock. And
Slane, deliberately bending the slice-bar
into a hoop, walked scornfully from the
fo’ castle. Even in sleep the men feared
him, muttering brokenly in nightmares,
tossing restlessly about, half-awake, in
dread of his voice calling them to new.
sadistically conceived labors. Like some
huge demon, the captain roamed the
ship, distributing his oaths, his savage
blows with grim satisfaction.

DERHAPS it was because he knew
A Jim Weston to be superior to him
mentally that Slane singled the earth-
man out for special attention. The dir-
tiest jobs, the most killing toil fell to
Jim’s lot; and when Slane discovered
that he could not catch Weston resting
or grumbling, his hatred of the earth-
man mounted. Determined to break
Jim at all costs, he devised new- and im-
possible tasks. Cleaning the carbon
from the forward rocket tubes, the fir-
ing chambers; shifting portions of the
cargo back and forth at the captain’s
fancy; long hours in the near-zero cold
of the void, clad only in a light space-
suit. patching the plates of the Astric’s
hull. A terrible ordeal, yet somehow
Jim stood it.

   Just how he kept going, he was never
quite sure. His hands were raw with
blisters, his body bruised by Slane's
well-directed kicks, his every muscle
ached in weary protest. There were
times when he felt that he must lie
98

DYNAMIC Science Stories

down, rest, if it meant his death. Yet
always there was something that urged
him on, some hidden source of energy
that was more of the mind than of the
body. Through sheer force of will he
kept on.

  After what seemed an eternity of
grey days and nights, Mars appeared
below them, huge, red, ominous, its vast
stretches of desert laced by a network
of canals. Coasting in on a long slant,
the As trie sped toward Psidis . . .
called by earthmen Acherusia Palus
. . . at the junction of the Bactrus and
Acheron canals. Jim was polishing the
chromium of the control panel as the
ship raced toward the red planet. Slane,
at the T-bar, was grinning.

  “So,” he rumbled, “your cruise is al-
most over. You’ll admit, no doubt, that
the comforts of our little luxury liner
have made up for the high cost of the
passage. And if such a ragged scare-
crow as you should go to the Martian
authorities with tales of robbery and
kidnapping, they’d arrest you for
drunkenness. Besides, they’ll have the
word of honest Captain Slane that
you’re space-crazy.”

  Jim laughed. That laughter, how-
ever, seemed to infuriate the Saturnian
more than words.

  “By all space!” Slane roared. “None
of your impudence! ” Lashing out with
his huge fist, he caught Jim a glancing
blow on the jaw.

  Stunned, Weston staggered back-
wards, crashed into the control panel.
Under his weight it buckled, gave way
in a tangle of wires, of shattered glass.
Blue sparks shot between short-cir-
cuited lead-ins; under the fierce heat
delicate wires melted, ran.

  Like a living thing the ship bucked,
lurching crazily from side to side,
climbing momentarily, then falling,
sickeningly. Slane, his eyes bright with
fear, twisted the T-bar desperately. Re-
ceiving no response, he ran to the com-

panionway, shouted along it.

  “Emergency stations! Open forward
rockets, full! Quick, blast you! Lower
rockets! Full power!”

  Jim Weston, disentangling himself
from the wreckage of the controls,
peered out of the big glassite observa-
tion port. Psidis, the canals, were lost
in the distance. The Astric, whirling
about madly, was dropping like a plum-
met onto the red, sandy desert. Jim
watched the ground leap up to meet
them. One second, two seconds, three
seconds. . . .

  Suddenly the ship steadied herself as
the lower rockets burst into flame. For
a moment it seemed that there might
yet be a chance. The speed of the de-
scent, however, was too great. With a
splintering crash, the ship hurtled into
the hard-packed sand.

  A lump 011 his head the size of an
egg, Jim Weston clambered to his feet.
A miracle, it seemed, that he still lived;
the ship was a tangled, twisted mass of
wreckage, a confusion of bent beams,
shattered plates, and sputtering wires.
The pilot room, located on top of the
ship and well forward, was the least
damaged. Jim touched his head ginger-
ly, glanced about. A smothered curse
from the other end of the room reached
his ears. Slane! Buried beneath a
heap of wreckage!

  Picking his way across the control
room, Jim tore at the scraps of metal.
A moment later Slane was staring up at
him, helplessly.

  “Trapped!” he muttered. “Can’t
move!”

  Jim knelt beside the fallen giant.
The massive T-bar assembly was
wedged across Slane’s chest, pinning
him to the floor. Weston grinned,
harshly.

  “If I was one of your kind,” he said,
“I’d go on about my business, leave you
here. Might even kick you around a
bit before leaving.”
THE STRONGER

  “No!” Slane’s voice was a hoarse
whisper. “No, lad! You . . . you
can’t!”

  “No, I can’t,” Jim said slowly. “I’m
not your type! I’ll get a lever. . .

' I ‘URNING abruptly, he descended
*■ the companionway to the deck be-
low. The lower part of the ship was
smashed to flinders. Jim crawled over
and through a crumpled heap of metal
toward the engine room. Approaching
it. he became suddenly nauseated. The
room was a shambles, a slaughterhouse.
The other members of the crew, caught
below at the moment of the crash, had
been reduced to charred, unrecognize-
able bits of flesh by a bursting firing
chamber. Snatching up a long durium
bar, one of the compression plungers,
he started back to the control room. In
passing the remains of the storage com-
partments, Jim suddenly noticed that
the floor was wet. Frowning, he dropped
the plunger, followed the stream of wa-
ter through a maze of broken crockery,
sacks of space-biscuits, tins of meat.
All at once he saw its source and his
heart sank. The big water tank, tilted
at a precarious angle, was spouting wa-
ter from a crack in its lower side. Rum-
maging hastily among the debris, Jim
came up with two quart-sized metal
containers, filled them. By the time he
had found a third bottle, however, the
tank, low after the long weeks in space,
was empty. With a shake of his head
Jim picked up the two containers, the
metal bar, and made his way back to
the control room.

  Slane stirred at the sound of the
earthman’s approach.

  “So,” he muttered, “you’ve come
back. . . .”

  “Yes.” There was irony in Weston’s
voice; he slipped the rod under the T-
bar assembly and, using a bit of the
control panel for a fulcrum, raised the
weight.

    “Ah!” Slane wriggled free, stood up,
 once more his domineering boastful
 self. “Takes more than a wreck to kill
 a Saturnian! What of the others?”
 “Dead.”

   “Good riddance.” Slane chuckled
 hoarsely. “Weaklings, they were. But
 where are we?”

    Jim motioned toward the observation
 port. Before them stretched an infinity
 of flat red desert, baking beneath a hot
 yellow sky. No hill, no tree, no sign
 of life broke the straight horizon. Rust-
 colored sand, hard-packed clay . . .
 and nothing more.

    “Not pretty, is it?” Slane mopped his
 egg-like head. “Got any water? It’s
 hotter’n mercury.”

    Jim handed him one of the metal bot-
 tles.

   “Be careful,” he warned. “The
 tank’s empty. Only a quart apiece.”
 Slane drank deep.

   “Looks like we walk,” he grunted.
 “No chance of repairing the radio, call-
 for help. I’ll go below, rustle up some
 food to take with us.” He turned to
 the companionway.

   When he came back, Weston was
 making a rough attempt to shoot the
 ' sun. Noting down the results of his
 observation, he turned to Slane. The
 big Saturnian, in addition to two pack-
 ages, of concentrated food, had the
 heavy radium container strapped to his
 belt. Jim grinned, sardonically.

    “You’ll sweat,” he observed. “Come
 on.”

CHAPTER II

 THE sun beat down like a hammer
 of brass, pounding the two men,
 the endless stretches of waste-
 land. On all sides there was nothing but
 the faint black line of the horizon, an
 occasional cloud of flying sand swept
100

DYNAMIC Science Stories

up from the plain by sudden fierce
gusts of hot wind. Barren, desolate, in-
terminable ... a sight that tore re-
lentlessly at men’s nerves.

  Jim Weston, his face and arms
burned to the color of raw liver, his
eyes half blinded by the glare, the wind-
blown sand, plodded automatically for-
ward. Walking, always walking! Two
days, yet they seemed two centuries!
That terrible ache in his legs, that buzz-
in his head as though his brains were a-
boil. And the sun, the damned, merci-
less sun! He glanced at Slane. The
giant, accustomed to the cold ice-floes
of Saturn, was reeling slightly as he
walked. There was a nervous twitching
about his jaw and a wild glint in his
little red eyes.

  “How much further?” he gasped,
licking his swollen, cracked lips.

  “Another day. Maybe two.” Jim
laughed, a hoarse cackle. “What’s the
matter, strong man? Turning soft?
You’re all alike, you Saturnians. Spoiled
by your great strength, by always tak-
ing what you want by force. But when
it comes to endurance, to a fight against
something that’s stronger than you are,
you’re not even close to us Earthmen.
We’re accustomed to struggling against
hopeless odds; we’ve learned to use our
brains. Endurance comes from the
mind. Willpower, courage, guts . . .
the something that keeps you from ly-
ing down and quitting when the going
gets tough. And bullies like you are
yellow, whine when you begin to feel
pain!”

CLANE’S head snapped up at these
^ biting words, as Jim had hoped it
would, and he increased his stride. But
at the end of half an hour he com-
menced to reel drunkenly once more,
sucking in the thin, hot air with chok-
ing sobs. All at once he slumped to
one knee, gasping.

  “Water! Can’t go on without water!”

  Jim paused, eyed the shaking hulk
scornfully.

  “Serves you right. I warned you yes-
terday about swilling the entire bottle.
I’ve nearly a pint of mine left.”

  “A ... a pint!” Sudden despera-
tion shone' in Slane’s eyes. Lunging
forward, he bore Weston to the ground,
tore the water bottle from his pocket.

  “Ah!” His sun-scorched fingers fum-
bled clumsily with the cap. “You see
who’s boss now! You’ll die and rot here
in the desert, earthling. And I . . .
I’ll . . .”

  “I’ve been waiting for this.” Weston
leaned forward, his sunken eyes gleam-
ing intently. “Think a minute before
you drink, Slane. Do you know where
you are? Do you know which way the
Bactrus lies? Aboard the As trie you
called yourself captain, but I noticed
the mate did all the navigation. All
right, Captain Slane! Take the water,
go ahead! In an hour you’ll be walk-
ing in circles, lost! And in a day
maybe two, you’ll be face down on the
sand, begging your Saturnian gods to
strike you dead! You say you’re the
boss! Well, boss, find your way out of
this!”

  Slane hesitated, his eyes on the blaz-
ing red expanse of desert. In two days
he had seen no change, nothing to vary
the awful monotony of the plain. No
difference between the place where they
stood now and the places they had been
an hour before. It was as though they
were on a treadmill, walking, walking,
getting nowhere. And the sun prodding
them with its hot copper beams, and the
terrible loneliness, and the mirages that
drew you from your path, disappeared
as you ran toward them. . . . Water
splashed softly in the canteen as Slane’s
hand shook.

  “You . . . you’re sure you know the
way?” he muttered.

  “My first job was working on the
Martian canals.” Jim wiped his
THE STRONGER

101

gummed, rheumy eyes. “We had a
chance ... a slim chance of reaching
the Bactrus. Now . . .”

  Slane’s fingers tightened about the
canteen until they threatened to crush
it. So Weston knew the way out of this
fiery hell! He’d noticed the earthman
studying the stars, measuring the shad-
ow of a little stick, consulting his watch.
He, Slane, knew nothing of such mat-
ters. In space robot pilots charted your
course, noted your position. But here
. . . All at once the Saturnian dropped
the water bottle at Jim’s feet, turned
away.

  “Come on!” he croaked.

  Jim picked up the bottle, unscrewed
its cap, filled the tiny cup with water.

  “Here,” he said brusquely. “Meant
to split it with you anyhow. It’s going
to be a tough pull.”

  It was. Daylight faded into deep,
blue-black night and the red desert be-
came a shadowy purple. The fiery sun
gave way to the twin moons, two gleam-
ing scimitars, slashing the star-stud-
ded curtain of darkness. Refreshed by
the sudden coolness, the spacemen plod-
ded forward, weary robots, dimly con-
scious of their own existence. Not un-
til midnight did they pause for a swal-
low of water, then pushed on, afraid to
rest lest they lack the strength to get
up. to continue.

  With dawn came the last mouthful
of water. By noon Slane was delirious.
He complained of faces, horrible, sav-
age faces, swelling until they filled the
entire desert, then dwindling away to
grey nothingness. Babbling brokenly,
he clutched Jim’s arm. frightened as a
child with a fever. Head bent, eyes on
the eternal sand, Weston staggered on.
Hours passed. Now Slane was mum-
bling of green trees, flowers. Jim hung
tightly to the giant’s arm, did not look
up. The Saturnian was going fast. In
another hour they’d both be . . .

  Suddenly Slane began to shout, to

call for help. Breaking free of Wes-
ton’s grip, he capered about awk-
wardly, waved his arms. Jim glanced
up, caught his breath.

OACING toward them across the
A sun-swept wasteland was a cluster
of dark dots, sharply outlined against
the rose-colored sand. Closer and
closer the moving figures came, sweep-
ing across the plain with incredible
speed. Wiry, dark-skinned little men,
they were, clad in flapping white dust-
robes. Mounted on shaggy-coated
thacns, those ungainly, stumpy-legged
beasts of burden which are found only
on the Psidian deserts, the nomads
made fantastic nightmare figures. Jim
Weston, watching them, suddenly re-
called tales he had heard at the Ter-
restrial Club at Mercis . . . tales of the
desert men’s savagery, of their fierce-
ness in combat. Haunting the ruins of
ancient cities, they preyed upon trav-
ellers', fighting fearlessly with anti-
quated heat guns purchased from ca-
nal-boat traders. Even the Martian
Alien Legion, composed of the tough-
est fighting men of every planet, re-
spected the wild little nomads for their
reckless bravery. Jim remembered
snatches of half-forgotten conversa-
tions . . . how the desert men, the
Vens, had once captured mighty Mer-
cis, sacked it . . . how their cruelty
had made them hated by all other Mar-
tians . . . their curious customs, their
strange language, their inhuman lack
of emotion. And now . . .

  “You fool!” He turned to Slane an-
grily. “D’you know who you’ve called
to for help? The Vens, the aborigines
of Mars! Tqrture’s their main sport!”

  The Saturnian stared at him stupidly,
then turned his dull eyes to the desert
men once more. They were near now;
Jim could see the dust thrown up by
the thatens’ hoofs, the sunlight winking
on the Vens’ polished heat guns. The
102

DYNAMIC Science Stories

desert men called to one another exult-
antly, waved their webbed, lizard-like
hands. These membraneous fingers and
their green bulbous eyes were all that
remained to show that the Vens had
once been amphibious, part of the
mighty race that had ruled Mars be-
fore the drying up of the great seas and
marshes. Jim gazed at them helplessly.
No use in trying to fight. . . .

  With fierce shouts the Vens drew
rein, forming a semi-circle about the
two spacemen. Jim felt nauseated by
the overpowering stench of the unclean
thaens. For a long moment the desert
men studied them, fingering the heavy
guns that hung from their embossed
wo/a^-skin belts.

  “What . . . what do you suppose
they want?” Slane muttered. “Maybe
they got water . . .”

  One of the Vens, his unblinking eyes
cold, snapped a question in an unintelli-
gible dialect. Jim’s answer, mumbled
in halting Martian, brought no re-
sponse. Suddenly at a command from
their leader, two of the desert men
leaped to the ground, extended gourd-
like bottles.

  “Water!” Slane tilted the gourd to
his lips, drank avidly. “They’re
friendly! Gods of Saturn 1 I feel alive
again! Ask ’em if . .

  He got no further. A dozen of the
little Vens, springing from their mounts,
bore him to the ground. For a brief
moment Slane struggled, bowling the
nomads over with sweeping blows of his
fists. Exhaustion, however, and lack of
water, had taken their toll; the big Sat-
urnian disappeared under a squirming,
savage mass of flesh. Weston, leaping
forward to his aid, felt scaly, webbed
hands grip his arms, his throat, drag
him to the ground. An instant later the
spacemen were securely bound, lashed
hand and foot with stout rawhide
thongs. Grinning exultantly, the no-
mads threw their captives over the

backs of two of the thaens, sprang into
their saddles. A word from their leader
and the Vens were riding swiftly toward
the west.

  Neither Jim nor Slane remembered
much of that wild ride across the desert.
Dust from the thaens’ hoofs blinded
them, and the jogging motion made
their tired muscles ache. Intermina-
ble hours went by. The sun was just
sinking, a bubble of blood on the dark
horizon, when the troop of desert men
came to a halt, dismounted.

  The camp of the Vens filled Jim with
a species of awe. The vast and hoary
antiquity of the place, the solemn grand-
eur of the fallen columns, the crumbling
walls, were at once impressive and ter-
rifying. Even before the glory of the
Canal-Builders, this place had flour-
ished, a great desert shrine to some for-
gotten god. Among the ruins of the
outbuildings, the Vens had pitched their
black, dome-shaped tents, surrounding
the central structure, a huge, six-sided
pyramid. Its massive blocks of stone,
in spite of their great age, were firm,
geometrically precise, though worn and
pitted by the swirling, wind-blown sand.
About the base of the pyramid marched
half-obliterated bas-reliefs, grey gran-
ite ghosts, peering from the stone with
blind, evil eyes. Wild, distorted faces,
misshapen bodies, half beast, half hu-
man, worn by the sand to only faint
outlines. At each of the six corners of
the building crouched a hideous winged
slug, those legendary monsters which,
according to the ancients, once haunted
the lowlands of Psidis.

DESIDE these majestic, forbidding
■*-' ruins the encampment was incon-
gruous. Ragged black tents, flickering
camp fires, slinking molats, the tail-
less, six-legged Martian hounds . . .
a scene of squalor, of primitive sav-
agery. Jim, lying on the ground next to
Slane, watched little frog-like women
THE STRONGER

103

and children emerge from the tents,
gather about the warriors, laughing,
chattering, admiring their bravery. The
Saturnian’s huge bulk seemed above all
to impress them; they felt his muscles,
examined his teeth, as though he were
some strange animal. The triumphant
warriors, swaggering, poured down cups
of tong, bent over tiny braziers, inhal-
ing the smoke of burnt jale.

  All at once a barbaric beat of drums
issued from the great temple. At sound
of it a sudden hush fell over the crowd
of Vens, the women and children cov-
ering their heads, the men kneeling.
From the ruined entrance of the pyra-
mid a baroque figure emerged, blinking
his goggle eyes in the fading sunlight.
Tiny and withered, he was, and dressed
in brilliant feathered robes. A tall
headdress, bright with jewels, precious
metals, covered his hairless head; hu-
man teeth, hung in strings, adorned his
neck, his wrists. A high priest, Jim de-
cided, or perhaps a chief. Slane swore,
straining at his bonds.

  The priest glanced at the two cap-
tives, grinning, and spoke in a high,
quavering voice. Instantly the two
spacemen were seized by a score of
small, eager hands, dragged into the
pyramid.

   Inside, the great temple was dark, ex-
cept where fallen roof stones admitted
shafts of light. To Jim it was all a
weird, disjointed dream. The green-
eyed, scaly-skinned little Vens, the bi-
zarre, evil figure of the high priest, the
huge shadowy temple with its bloated,
obscene statues, its hideous bas-reliefs.
Beside him, Slane swore continually,
more to keep his courage up than for
any other reason.

  After perhaps ten minutes wander-
ing through long, dank corridors, they
found themselves in a vast hall, a place
of sacrifice in bygone years to judge
from the big altar, the grinning idols.
Before the altar were two cages, tall

and narrow; the sight of their tough
t/iaeti-hide bars filled Weston with de-
spair. The heavy strips of leather
would bend, certainly, but even Slane’s
mighty strength could not break them.
Disconsolately he stumbled forward,
was shoved bodily into the little cage.
When Slane had been forced into the
other pen, the Vens lashed the doors
into place.

  Muttering incoherently, the wrinkled
priest approached the cages, brandish-
ing a long, curiously-carved, ceremon-
ial spear. With a quick movement he
cut his prisoners’ bonds, thrust food,
gourds of water between the bars.

  “Good enough,” Slane chuckled.
“Kinda like being in the Solar System
Zoo back on Earth, but as long as we
eat and drink, I don’t care. Good food,
this.” Wolfing down the slabs of meat,
the water, he stretched lazily. “It’s
gonna be tough sleeping when you can’t
even sit down, but I’m tired enough to
sleep standing on my head.”

  Leaning against the wall of the nar-
row cage, Slane closed his eyes. As he
did so, the grinning little priest lunged
forward, jabbed his leg with the spear.
W'eston watched his companion
straighten up with a bellow of pain, and
his face went white.

  “Good God!” he whispered. “They
. . . they’re not going to let us sleep!”

CHAPTER III

JIM WESTON sagged against the
wall of the cage, his face gleaming
with sweat. He was fighting a
fierce inner battle against a weary body
that cried for sleep. His eyelids, it
seemed, weighed a thousand tons; only
by the most cruel efforts was he able to
keep them from drooping. Squatting
by the flickering altar fire, the withered
priest eyed him expectantly, his hand on
104

DYNAMIC Science Stories

the ever-ready spear. Through a gap-
ing hole in the roof of the temple Jim
could see the big green star that was
his home. Earth, with its green fields;
its great cities 1 Here in the deserts of
Mars it seemed only a dim dream . . .
a dream. . . He caught himself just in
time to keep from nodding off.

  The priest, however, had not noticed.
A howl of pain from the other cage told
that Slane had dozed off again. Jim
turned to look at the Saturnian. Slane
was shaking the bars in madness, offer-
ing the container of radium for a min-
ute’s sleep. Vaguely amused, the toed-
like Ven wiped the blood from the point
of his spear. Jim glanced at Slane’s
legs; they were gory, clotted masses of
flesh, marked by a hundred spear-
thrusts. The giant’s face was waxy in
the firelight and his red eyes held an in-
sane glitter.

  “Slane!” Jim called. “You’ve got to
stay awake! Got to! I’m trying to
work out a plan. . .

  “Plan?” Slane laughed hoarsely.
“What can we hope to do? Why doesn’t
he kill me . . . kill me before I go crazy!
Gods! I could break a dozen of these
little devils with my bare hands! But
this. . . ”

  “Show some guts. The strength you
were always boasting about on the
Astric. Try to act like an earthman
instead of a Saturnian bully. I’m going
to pretend to be asleep. If I can hold
still while he jabs my legs, make him go
higher, I’ll be able to grab the spear.
The carved handle of it is pointed.
Maybe. . . .”

  “You can’t.” Slane’s voice was a
whimper. “You can’t stay still while he
twists that spear in your legs! The
pain. . . .”

  Weston shut his eyes, lay back
against the wall of the cage. Chuckling
to himself the guard thrust at his legs.
A trickle of blood ran down his calf, but
Jim did not move. Again the spear

flashed through the bars, and again.
The muscles of Jim’s neck stood out
like whipcords. The little Ven nodded.
Real sport, he decided, was about to
commence. The red blade of the wea-
pon rose higher, cutting Jim’s thighs,
his waist. And still the earthman did
not budge, although his face was like
putty.

  Now the spearpoint was diging at the
tender flesh of his stomach. Weston’s
arm tensed, its muscles tightened. Sud-
denly, with the swiftness of a striking
molat, his hand gripped the spear, drew
it back for a crashing blow. The pointed
butt of the weapon, with all of Weston’s
wiry strength behind it. entered the
priest’s bulbous green eye, pierced his
brain.

  “Gods of Saturn!” Slane muttered.
“You. . . you’ve done it! Now if we
can get out of these cages. . .

  Jim. his face grey with pain, drew the
spear back, hacked the rawhide lashings
of the cage door. A moment later he
and Slane were running along the sha-
dowy corridors of the temple, groping
their way toward the entrance.

  “Quick! The thaens!” Jim gasped.
“The little devils’ll be awake in a min-
ute!”

  Already questioning shouts, cries of
alarm, were echoing through the en-
campment. Against the pale sand Jim
could see the squat silhouettes of the
thaens, tethered near the temple. The
two men ran toward them, unfastened
the tether ropes.

  “Hold these!” Weston extended two
bridles to Slane. “I’ll stampede the
rest!”

EPREED. the frightened thaens gal-
*■ loped off into the desert; the space-
men mounted the two remaining beasts,
smacked them sharply on the flanks.
Dim figures ran toward them and heat
guns lashed the air with red beams of
light.
THE STRONGER

105

  The red desert, the crumbling ruins
behind them were lurid in glare of the
heat guns. A patch of sand beside
Slane’s mount fused, ran. Jim, marvel-
ling at the shaggy beasts’ speed, glanced
at the stars.

  “Slane!” he called. “Keep going!
Fast! We’re almost out of dan . . .”
His words trailed off into nothingness.

  Slane glanced over his shoulder.
Weston lay sprawled on the ground,
very still. The thacn, its leg seared
away by a heat gun’s blast, rolled
about, kicking up the sand in agony.
Slane shook his head. No sense go-
ing back into that inferno of heat
rays for a man who was probably
dead. Besides, he had the chest of ra-
dium, and with Weston out of the way,
there’d be no question of ownership.
The Saturnian grinned. In a day or
two he’d reach Psidis and with a pocket
full of radium. Psidis with its tiny,
rose-skinned girls, its bottles of tong,
of thole, and he, Slane. . . .

  The big man turned once more,
glanced back. Weston lay still, sur-
rounded by a blazing red fury of heat
blasts. Slane frowned. Somehow he
seemed to be back in the narrow raw-
hide cage, listening to Jim’s quiet voice.
“Show some guts. Try to act like an
Earthman instead of a Saturnian
bully.” So the terrestrial thought he
was better, stronger, than a man of Sat-
urn! That he had more courage! Slane
wheeled the thacn about savagely.

  Bending low, he spurred the fright-
ened beast back into the hell of lam-
bent flame. Pencils of crimson light
grazed his arms, his legs, searing them.
It required all of his vast strength to
force the wild-eyed thaen forward now.
All at once he was beside the limp,
sprawling figure on the sand.

  “Slane!” Jim glanced up at him,
smiling. “I . . . I knew you’d come!”

  “Okay!” The Saturnian muttered
gruffly. Leaping from the thaen’s back,

he bent to pick up Weston. At that mo-
ment the thaen, mad with fear from the
stabbing rays, reared up on its hind
legs, raced off across the desert.

  Slane, the wounded man in his arms,
gazed after the fleeing animal, his face
beaded with sweat. Behind them the
heat guns had ceased abruptly. The
Vens, seeing an opportunity of captur-
ing the two spacemen alive, ran forward
across the desert, shouting exultantly.

  “Leave me!” Jim sought to free him-
self from the giant’s grip. “Run! Save
yourself!”

  Slane shook his head stubbornly,
staggered on. With each moment his
pursuers drew nearer. Glancing over
his shoulder, the Saturnian could see
their green icy eyes, gleaming lumin-
ously in the darkness, hear their hoarse,
eager voices. Now the desert men were
scarcely a hundred feet away, their
webbed feet padding softly on the sand.
Weston, slung over the big man’s shoul-
der, sighed hopelessly. There was no
escape ... in another minute, at the
most, two . . .

  And then it happened. Like a flam-
ing meteorite a sleek rocket plane
swooped down, its proton guns hissing.
Caught by the deadly blast, a score of
the Vens crumpled lifeless to the
ground; the others, panic-stricken, took
to their heels in wild, insane terror. The
plane landed lightly, its durium runners
gliding softly over the sand.

  “The Desert Patrol!” Jim watched
four men in the familiar green uniform
of the Martian Alien Legion climb from
the plane. “Thanks, Slane! You . . .
you saved me . . .”

  The giant’s deep laugh boomed tri-
umphantly across the desert

  “Better than a Saturnian, eh?” he
exclaimed. “Less guts than an Earth-
man? Huh! Like hell!”

  Still laughing, he dropped the chest
of radium into Weston’s pocket and
staggered toward the rocket plane.
ROUNDABOUT

id?_£_

   Let’s look back at today.

   7000 years from now, no more may
 be known of today than we know of
 almost legendary Troy, buried less
 than half that long', or of the Toltec
 and Pre-Dynastic Egyptian empires.
 Civilizations can not be reconstructed
 from archaeological data alone. And
 books are one with dust after 7000
 years.

   What then will they think of us in
 the great future that is to come? Not
 surely that each and every one of
 their scientific, fiction-like wonders
 had its origin and factual basis in
 OUR TODAY.

   Yet that is what we shall find in
 this first and subsequent Roundabout
 views of the present, while adven-
 turing in remote time to come.

 Punctually at five minutes to nine on
the 2nd of sol, in the year 9193, E.S.
Technician Jonz entered the main lec-
ture hall of Tellurian University and,
in the only chair with which thte aud-
itorium was equipped, seated himself
facing the vows of ground glass screens
that filled the huge room. His entrance
having served as a signal to the engin-
eers in the balcony control room, in a
moment the screens were glowing
brightly beneath the iridium number
plates that surrounded each. Immed-
iately the class began to assemble.

 The young Educational Science Tech-
nician, his plain but not unattractive
features set in their characteristic ser-
ious mold, composed himself to wait
while in their homes scattered across
the face of the globe the thousands of
his students bolted their breakfast tab-
lets to be before their televisors on the
stroke of the hour. Rapidly their life-
size images began to appear on the
numbered screens. Soon there were but
a score or two of screens still blank,
then a dozen, three, one—and still one.

   Frowing, the technician regarded

the uncompromising emptiness of the
ninteen - hundred - and - thirty - ninth
screen. Unprecedented! Twenty-three
seconds past the hour and—TIis frown
vanished as a girl’s face appeared with
startling abruptness on the screen.

  The face, as No. 1939 sat back trium-
phantly from suddenly mastering the
enigma of her televisor’s tuning dials,
revealed itself as that which a forgotten
age might have called lovely, giving
due heed to shadowed blue eyes and a
sweep of soft brown hair, and pert, tak-
ing into account an impish turn of lips
and a certain uptilt of nose. Young
E. S. Technician Jonz characterized it
rather as a harmonious combination of
plastic surfaces. And yet he felt the
description somehow inadequate. . . .

  Collecting himself with a start, the
Technician took the amplifier from its
hook and placed it on his head. It
rested there like the outlandish head-
pieces worn by the ancient kings be-
fore the age of Frankness, gleaming
points pressing into his scalp over the
principal brain centers. Without pre-
amble, then, he began his lecture, and
a stir passed through the class visible
in the television screens as his brain
potentials, led off by a maze of fine
wires that wound into a co-axial cable
and coiled across the floor to the trans-
formers in the control room, carried
his first thought directly into the minds
of his far-flung students.

  “In opening the humanities section
of the 1263rd session of the University,”
telepathcd E. S. Technician Jonz, “I
have but one preliminary observation
to make. It is at the insistance of the
Dean of Students that two-way televi-
sion has been installed. His belief is
that allowing everyone to see everyone
else—” the Technician gestured to the
silvered, wall behind him, mirroring to
each student the entire classroom—
“will promote a valuable cooperative
spirit. For my part 1 hope that the inno-
vation will not prove a distraction to
you in the serious pursuit of higher—”

  Somehow E. S. Technician Jonz’ eyes
had strayed to a certain screen. Strange,
how her eyes crinkled when—

  Quickly changing the direction of
his thoughts lie resumed with a sharp-
ness that widened the girl’s smile, “The
next tiling we know, they will be asking
us to come together in person, and use
our voices—” the Technician’s thoughts
waves were fairly surcharged with
emotional repulsion—“like our more
violently insane, or animals in pain!”
“Hmph! So I sound like a sick cow!”
The intruding thought impinged
lightly upon Technician Jonz’ mind, but
somehow he was certain it had origi-
nated with the girl in television screen
1939. Instinctively feeling a challenge,
he set out to meet it: “It is many thou-
sand years since man has forsaken brute
speech for mental communication. Un-
fortunately, the devasting wars of the
third millenium left few traces of such
civilization as may have existed pre-
viously. And true, the absence of
graven records, in conjunction with
archaelogical artifacts of considerable
engineering skill, such as airships, in-
dicates that man in the twentieth and
preceding centuries was but an illiter-
ate if gifted savage. But,” he con-
cluded triumphantly, “all authorities
agree that it is at least ten thousand
years since the voice has been used in
communication between human be-
ings!”	h

  He darted a glance at No. 1939.
Somewhat nettled to find her still smil-
ing in unreasonable amusement, he con-
tinued swiftly: “It is our object in this
first lecture to obtain a true historical
perspective. While man, according to
the findings of anthropologists, has ten-
anted the earth for about one million
years, he remained a primitive creature
until less than 7000 years ago! 1 can
conceive no better illustration of this
fact than one involving the very matter
of mental communication already
touched upon.”

  The Technician was on familiar
ground now. His thoughts fairly
crackled. “It is true, as I have informed
you, that long before the twentieth
century telepathy had become man’s
sole method of direct communication.
But in how crude a form it prevailed!
The proof is in an archaelogical dis-
covery in which I had the honor of

sharing while on the Third Brstd Mid-
Western Expedition, to the site of the
legendary city of Tchaikago.

  “Tchaikago—or Chicago—if you re-
call the story, was supposed to have
been utterly destroyed during the twen-
tieth century in a struggle between
Fascism and Democracy, which accord-
ing to some were rival esoteric philos-
ophies of that time Others would have
it that they are merely symbols of Good
and Evil, characterizing the opposing
forces of Capital and Labor in the Nine
Hundred Years War, that pitiful strug-
gle between two archaic and artificially
differentiated groups using the power
of science to'wrest from each other the
bounty it could have given both. In any
case, digging at a new location, we came
upon unmistakable signs of human
habitation. It was there, in the first
building unearthed, that we made the
discovery—a tall, narrow, closet-like
wooden box, on its door the nearly
obliterated cabalistic symbols: PUBL
TEL.

  “Later excavations and subsequent
investigations convinced us of the na-
ture of this object. It was an aid in
telepathic communication! So men-
tally impotent were the ancients of this
day that they found it necessary to seal
themselves in these coffin-like boxes—
mind you that they had no ventilation
—until temperature, pulse, and respira-
tion were violently increased, until per-
spiration exuded from every pore and a
condition of near-coma prevailed—and
only then were they able to communi-
cate with each other! . . .

  “May I offer a—an alternative ex-
planation?”

  There was no doubt, this time, that
the interjected thought had originated
with the girl visible in television screen
1939. Though surprised, the Technician
indulgently consented.

  The girl, the screen showing her
leaning forward in the chair before her
televisor, in whichever of a thousand
remote climes she might live, earnestly
began: “What you discovered had noth-
ing to do with telepathy. It was a
booth—a station—for using a mechan-
ical instrument called the telephone.

. . .” She hesitated. “Yes, we—they
used their voices to communicate then.
But,” she quickly added, “they weren’t
—weren’t mentally impotent. ...”
108

DYNAMIC Science Stories

  The echo of his own thought escaped
E. S. Technician Jonz—by virtue of his
engrossment in a physiological phen-
omenon. A disproportionate amount of
blood had come to the girl’s face, as if
she were—lie sought, and found, the
archaic term—blushing. Meanwhile
the girl swiftly continued.

  “They were well on their way to it,
however—telepathic communication, I
mean. Extra Sensory Perception they
called it then. Psychologists in univer-
sities w'ere studying it, to see how it
worked and how it could be developed.
Other scientists were trying to find out
what it was.

  “They discovered that the brain is a
storehouse of electric energy, released
in waves in thinking. They were begin-
ning to identify certain brain poten-
tials with particular states of conscious-
ness and emotion, and different wave
lengths with definite areas of the brain
and functions of the mind. And in their
experiments, they even put contrap-
tions on their subjects like the funny
thing on your head to carry the brain
potentials to transformers to be built
up, so—” the girl concluded with a toss
of her head that sent highlights rip-
pling down the sheer silic sleeveless
blouse that met trim silic shorts at an
even trimmer waist— “I guess there
isn’t anything now that the twentieth
century didn’t well start!”

  E. S. Technician Jonz’ frown van-
ished with a sudden inspiration. This,
heyond doubt, should prove a deadly
blow, particularly to a feminine antag-
onist. lie directed his inspired thought
to the class. “If there arc any t>f you
inclined to agree -with the young lady,
only regard her clothing. Like your
own it is, of course, the universal fab-
ric we call silic, after the Silica constit-
uent in the glass of which it is made.
It is soft and lustrous, yet it has a
greater tensile strength than steel; it is
both waterproof and non-inflammable.
Compare silica with the straw-like fab-
rics which the ancients made from
course animal hair or the secretion of
insect larve!”

  He stopped abruptly, feeling rather
well pleased with himself, but it seemed
he had hardly finished his thought, be-
fore the girl was replying. “That’s not
fair. They made synthetic fabrics—
rayon out of cellulose, and artificial

silk by forcing collodion through fine
apertures, just to begin. And what’s
more, they made silic!—even if they
didn’t call it that.”

  E. S. Technician Jonz’ complacency
had been slowly dwindling. Now it
vanished completely. His frown re-
appeared and with it a certain puzzle-
ment as the girl added, “1 don’t know
if the process was the same, but I’ll bet
the results were every bit as good. The
thread was made by breaking up glass
with steam under such terrific pressure
that a twelve ounce bottle would pro-
duce a single fiber five thousand miles in
length! You might have seen it—I
mean, one place where glass fabric and
clothing were made during the twen-
tieth century isn’t—wasn’t far from
Chicago—Owens, Illinois. ’ ’

  A pedant Technician Jonz might have
been, but not a fool. Beyond doubt
there was something strange about
this girl. He had not failed to note a
certain confusion about time in her
mind, alongside her remarkably de-
tailed, if accurate, knowledge of ancient
history. Moreover, no archaelogical
excavation had ever been made at any
place called Owens, Illinois.

  This last fact he imparted to the class,
sitting in his chair, his true feelings hid-
den to any but the most, intuitive ob-
server, then added, “Let us leave until
some later lecture, the details of our
superior achievements and conclude
briefly with a more general comparison
between today and the twentieth cen-
tury. I believe all will concede we have
made considerable social advances.

  “We escape all the crassness of that
former age, the luirly burly of large
assemblages, the psychic disturbances
of individual human contacts. Ours is
a more aesthetic life, one that is con-
ductive to creative effort. The power
of the cosmos floods into man on his
Olympian heights, and”—was there a
hint of bitterness in the Technician’s
glance at screen 1939?—“women is his
equal.

  “Formerly people came together in
groups for diversion, and in couples in
response to the animal mating instinct.
For our diversion today we need not stir
from our homes. The television screen,
for example, brings the theatre to us.
Or if I wish to relax over a game of
chess with one of my University col-

leagues, we play mentally, as I am com-
municating with you. As for perpetu-
ating the race, for twenty centuries
synthesized ova and chemical fertiliz-
ation have replaced that compulsion on
men and women to seek out each other,
sacrificing the splendid personal isola-
tion which is the superiority of our
social organization.”

  He concluded with a proud, little-boy
defiance and suddenly seemed very
much alone as, preparatory to dismis-
sing the class, he rose to his feet in the
great hall of numbered glass screens.
Perhaps that is why the girl smiled
now more with her eyes, grown lumi-
nous, than her lips. And perhaps that
is why she asked, “Haven’t you for-
gotten that mating isn’t all there is to
love? There’s companionship—”
“And aren’t you,” sharply inter-
rupted the Technician, “merely ration-
alizing with some romantic nonsense
tliis obvious inferiority in the social
organization of the century you have
chosen to defend?”

  The gii l ’s smile drained away. Green
flecks seemed to appear in her eyes.
“Oh, allright, then. Let’s see if you can
take it too. The twentieth century did
start chemical fertilization! In fact,
in the ninteenth century, sea urchins
were produced that way. Later, frogs
and rabbits. And finally, though they
were satisfied at the start to let it de-
velop only as far as the beginning of
cell division, a human ova was fertilized
artificially!”

  “The class,” telepathed E. S. Tech-
nician Jonz, “is dismissed!” and
snatched the amplifier from his head.
Until the television screens were blank
again he stood there. Though he may
have imagined it, he thought he saw
contrition 011 the face of the girl in
screen 1939 as her image disappeaued
on the fading glow. Then, feeling a
vague unrest, he strode out of the lec-
ture hall and left the University.

  It was the same peculiar dissatisfac-
tion which made him proceed homeward
on foot. From the corridor outside the
lecture ball he could have iwkcn the
pneumatic tube, which burrowed be-
neath the city, or the mono-gyro, whose
spider-web tracks hung from every
tower. No one ever walked. But at
no other time would the emptiness of
the streets have struck E. S. Technician

Jonz as undesirable. In a brown study
he trudged along until—

  “Hi! Professor.”

  Later, Technician Jonz would remem-
ber that it had happened exactly as he
came abreast Public Airport. 312, Dis-
trict. 32. But at the moment, there was
too much to which he had to adjust,
himself. Her peculiar salutation: it
meant notliing to him and yet it meant
everything, for though he did not know
the words, the intention was obviously
friendly. And she had spoken—or had
that been the pealing of a bell?

  “I am extremely pleased to meet you
—Miss 1939,” said Technician Jonz,
and was so astounded to find that his
own voice had a not unpleasant timbre
—or perhaps was so engrossed wit h blue
eyes and smiling lips—that he said
nothing more for a moment. Then, as if
announcing an amazing discovery, “I
had 110 idea you lived within a thou-
sand miles of here.”

  “Another disadvantage of television,
telepathy—and isolation.”

  Jonz smiled, and immediately became
a much more attractive young man.
“Perhaps you are right,” he agreed
amiably. “Are you going my way?”
“No!”

  It was a lie, and Technician .Jonz
knew it from the inrpish turn of her
lips. But his capitulation was complete.
“Then will you go my way?” he asked.
“Yes,” she replied, more softly.
Several squares later Technician
Jonz sighed and ventured to remark
that this was most pleasant.

  “Then you were lonely,” the girl
said. ‘ ‘ And you do see, don’t you, what
I meant by companionship. It’s not
primitive. It’s—”

  “Yes. But you’re lonely too. Where
are you from?”

  The girl hesitated.

  “Never mind,” Technician Jonz
said firmly. He was a different man
now. A man—as an earlier century
phrased it—with a maid. “At least
you’re a stranger here, so there is much
I can show you. This afternoon, the
energy plants. Tonight, Galaxy Park.”
“What’s that?”

  “An amusement park. You’ll see
plenty that was never dreamed of in t he
twentieth century.”

  “Sure?”

  “Well, maybe.”

  Thus once more is reaffirmed the
truly prophetic quality of science fic-
tion. But we need not look only, to a
distant realization of the wonder of
H. G. Wells’ ‘-When the Sleeper

Rapidly experiments are being pushed

MAGIC IN THE AIR

Dear Sir:

  Last summer, while driving through
Arizona, we saw a mirage which I
would like to have explained. We saw
a broad lake ahead. As we drove on, it
never came closer but suddenly van-
ished and appeared behind us.—L. G.,
New York City.

  It appears that this mirage involved
nothing more than a stratum of super-
heated air lying across the highway.
Shimmering so that at a distance it
seemed opaque from either side, the air
itself gave the appearance of water.
But ordinarily a mirage reflects, or in
some way alters, the image of some real
object. In such cases, armies are seen
marching through the air, ants return-
ing to their sand-heaps are cattle scal-
ing a rocky cliff, and a ship may divide
into two identical craft and sail away
in opposite directions!

  Reflected mirages occur when the su-
perimposition of two layers of air of un-
equal temperature and density causes
their common surface to act as a mirror.
While the Arizona mirage was un-
doubtedly startling — particularly to
anyone following the car, which would
have seemed to plunge into the lake and
submerge!—if it had been the reflected
variety the effect would have been still
more bewildering. The “lake” itself
would have mirrored the surrounding

countryside!

  The light rays thus reflected back to
earth may come from objects a few or a
hundred—even a thousand—miles dis-
tant. Thus Peary, in the Arctic, saw
mountain tops around the bend in the
earth. The “discovery” sent another
expedition out to explore—the mirage!

  Of this same variety was the mirage
of armies marching through the air,
seen in parts of the Scandinavian penin-
sula during the Franco-Prussian War.
Even the uniforms of the men fighting
hundreds of miles to the south could be
distinguished! Most striking mirage of
this type, observed recurrently in the
Strait of Messina and elsewhere in
southern Europe, is the famed Fata
Morgana—an image, formed in the air,
the water, or in both with one inverted,
of a harbour bustling with ships of ev-
ery flag, even water-front houses and
streets thronged with sailors of many
nations!

  While it may amuse us, as has been
reported from lower New York har-
bour, to see the Empire State Building
“stand on its own head,” mirages
formed in the sky are of course not de-
ceiving. But certain types of mirages
caused by irregular refraction of light
produce disconcerting effects. While
it causes no harm to the beholder to see
a ship apparently split in two, this same
lateral displacement of light forced one
aviator, when two mountains suddenly
loomed before his plane, to make a dis-
astrous choice between mirage and solid
rock!

  Similarly, a mirage which distorts
size, like that of the cattle which proved
to be ants magnified by the burning
desert air, can be discomforting. On
Long Island Sound, a huge ship sud-
denly loomed over a motor boat. Fran-
tically the small boat endeavored to
avoid being run down, but the levia-
than, its helmsman watching but not
seeing, bore swiftly down on it. Colli-
sion was imminent, when suddenly the
huge ship dwindled and receded to a
small cruiser miles away—as the mirage
ended!

too technical for a layman to prove, has
challenged me to offer convincing evi-
dence that light has motion. Will you
come to my aid—R. E., Chicago, 111.

  The simplest and yet a most effective
demonstration of the motion of light is
the original one used by Roemer, who
discovered the phenomenon. While it is
true that most scientific demontrations
demand advanced technical knowledge
and elaborate equipment, this one re-
quires only a watch and a pair of field
glasses.

  On clear nights, if the glasses are
turned on Jupiter, they will reveal the
planet’s four brightest moons, whose
frequent eclipses can not be mistaken.
The interval between successive eclipses
will be found to vary considerably in
observations made at different times of
the year. That is because the distance
between Earth and Jupiter has changed
—the distance, in bringing us the sight,
which light must travel.

  By this same method, even the veloc-
ity of light can be determined with the
sole addition to our equipment of an
almanac. Taking the observations when
Jupiter and Earth are at opposition and
then at conjunction, we find it takes
some sixteen minutes more for light to
cross the additional space between the
nearest and farther approaches of the
two planets. That difference in distance
is also known; it is of course the diame-
ter of the Earth’s orbit, approximately
186,000,000 miles. Divide it by the ac-
tual 998 second interval our watch has
registered, and we have for the speed of
light a figure slightly in excess of 186,-
000 miles per second.

  In other respects Jupiter’s moons
have long had a way of keeping in the
news. These same four used in measur-
ing the speed of light, served a far
greater end when discovered by Galileo
in 1610. They showed Jupiter as a min-
iature solar system; hanging in the sky,
to all eyes they were a working model
of the Copernican Heliocentric (sun-
center) system—and a death blow to
the Ptolemaic Geocentric (earth-center)
system which had long impeded the
progress of astronomy.

  Not until 1892 was Jupiter’s fifth sat-
elite discovered, but the decade after
1904 added four more to his growing
family. These were photographic dis-

overies and it was thought that now,
with the fifty short-period comets that
divide allegiance between Jupiter and
the Sun, the roster was filled. But a
few months ago, the powerful Mt. Wil-
son 100-inch telescope turned up two
new moons!

  The discovery of Jupiter’s tenth and
eleventh satelites is one to make us re-
member that the book of our knowledge
of our celestial neighbors is hardly be-
gun. Soon, the great 200-inch Califor-
nia telescope and then— What is the
mystery of the ‘‘canals’’ of dying
Mars? What lies beneath the shroud-
ing clouds of Venus, mature twin to
the Earth in age, size, and physical
constitution?

  And while we seek these answers, a
young giant, under the bright auspices
of eleven satelites, perhaps awaits the
day when all the other planets shall
be dead, barren—and Jupiter shall be
the home of man!

BURNING THOUGHTS

Dear Sir:

  Is artificial fever treatment generally con-
sidered safet—M. D. B., Lubbock, Texas.

  Artificial fever, induced by shortwave radi-
ation or incarceration in a hot box for from
two to ten hours, has been used successfully in
the treatment of arthritis. St. Vitus’ dance
and other pathologic conditions. It is not
known whether the extreme heat—tempera-
tures up to 107° T. are used—directly kills
germs or stimulates the body to produce sub-
stances that will. But if delirium is avoided
by drinking large amounts of salt water to re-
place the salts lost in sweat, no other ill effects
are suffered.

  More interesting in its possibilities is an en-
tirely different use for induced high fevers.
While they do not Injure the brain, they ap-
parently cause some change that INCREASES
INTELLIGENCE!

  Experiments with rats have clearly demon-
strated this fact. While it is not known
whether the increased intelligence is due to
stimulated circulation, sending more fresh
blood through the body and to the brain, or is
due to some other factor, there seems no rea-
son why this treatment should not be applied
to man!
