HIGK CARTER’S PROMISE;

OR,

Millions at JStiiliO.

By the Author of “NICK CARTER.”

CHAPTER I.
a'victim of a strange persecution.

  Marcus Astorel, millionaire, middle-
aged, corpulent, ruddy-faced, and anx-
ious-eyed, sat one forenoon in the recep-
tion-rooni of liis suite in the Palace Ho-
tel, San Francisco, impatiently drum-
ming his fingers on the little table in
front of him.

  He was expecting a visitor.

 The time was the latter part of
March.

  Ten o’clock arrived, and the visitor
presented himself.

  It was Nick Carter.

 He had arrived that morning from a
small town in the interior, where he had
succeeded, with Chick’s assistance, in un-
masking a fiend in human shape.

  The millionaire shook hands heartily
with the great detective.

  “I can’t tel] you how glad I am to see
you, Mr. Carter.”

  “You have urgent need of my services,
then?”

  “Yes. Before my arrival in California
two days ago, I thought the case a most
pressing one. To-day it has become a
matter of life and death with me.”

  Mr. Astorel’s lips twitched in nervous
fear, and he glanced uneasily at the door
opening into the corridor.

  Nick followed his eye, and interpreting
the glance, went to the door, opened it
and peered out.

  “There is no one there,” he said.
“Now, then, to business.

  “Two months ago,’’began the million-
aire, “ray wife was abducted.

  “The abductor demanded ten thousand
dollars for her safe return to San Fran-
cisco.

  “I paid the money in the manner stip-
ulated, and my wife arrived at our home
on Van Ness avenue, safe and sound.

  “Two weeks later my only daughter
Hester was abducted from Mills Semi-
nary in Alameda County', where she was
receiving the finishing touches to her ed-
ucation.
NICK CARTER AVEKKLY.

  “And to-night you must turn up fifty
thousand dollars more, or turn up your
toes. ’ ’

  Nick spoke half jestingly, but Astorel
shivered at the words.

  “Yes,” lie said, “I must be prepared
for the loss of more money or the loss of
my life, unless you are able to extricate
me from the terrible dilemma.”

  “I will do my best, and have the
faith to believe that Mr. Dellman will not
succeed in his purpose. ”

  “ You will have a man with the cun-
ning of old Satan to contend with.”

  “The odds then will be in my favor,
for Satan would never be in sheo'l but for
a little mistake he once made.”

  Nick’s air of confidence inspired Asto-
rel to remark, quietly:

  “I believe you will succeed in spite of
the evil ability of Dellman.”

  “I admit his ability. He must be able,
indeed, to have covered up his tracks so
well; to have so arranged his evil pro-
gramme, that although you know him to
be the man who has robbed you, yet you
have no evidence to produce that would
warrant his arrest.”

  “I never saw cunning and audacity so
queerly combined as they are in this
man,” said the broker.

  “He will show his audacity once too
often, Mr. Astorel,” Nick went on. “I
like this case. It attracts me.”

  The plan of campaign against the ene-
my was arranged, and when Astorel was
made acquainted with the line of attack
his astonishment thereat was equaled only
by 11 is admiration of the great detective’s
strategical intelligence.

  Some hours after they' had parted,
Nick went into the Cafe Royal, in Flood
Building.

  He was in search of Albert Dellman.
•He had not been seated more than five
minutes in one of the comfortable chairs
ranged alon^ the sides of the large hall,
when the object of his search entered.

  Tall, dark-featured, handsome, with
polished manners and a pleasant smile,
he was a man calculated to make a favor-
able impression wherever he went or in
what society he might be cast.

  Nick gazed at him long and steadily,
and noting certain lines about the
mouth, together with other character in-
dications, formed the correct conclusion
that Albert Dellman could commit a mur-
der with that smile of his, and never
suffer from a perturbed conscience.

  “Mentally he is as bright as a new
dollar,” thought Nick, “but morally he
is an idiot. ”

  An acquaintance at one of the tables
greeted Dellman effusively.

  “Glad to see you,” he exclaimed.
“Where have you been for the past
week? Missed you awfully at the club.
Must have you at the bull’s-head dinner
to-morrow at the Cliff. Now don’t say no,
old fellow, for without your assistance the
affair must be a failure. ”

  Dellman smiled in return, showing, as
he did so, a set of firm white teeth.

  “I can’t possibly oblige you,” lie an-
swered, “for to-morrow I shall be on my
way to Los Angeles.”

  “What! Have you struck a windfall?”
“Not yet”—composedly—“but before
I start I expect to be better off, finan-
cially, than I am to-day. ”

   “Glad of it, Mr. Dellman, for that tilt
of yours made the other day againt the
Associated Virginia must have cost you
a cool fifty thousand.”

  “Just that, my boy, to a dollar. But I
shall recoup to-night beyond the shadow
of a doubt. ”

  “W’l. you?” said Nick, to himself.
“Now, if I know anything about matters
and things connected with your case, Mr.
Albert Dellman, I should prophesy that
to-night will not help you out. Instead of
fift3’ thousand dollars in that old tree back
of Berkeley you will likely find a bottle
of soup. ”
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.	5

   Dellman was on his way to a seat, •when
 struck by a sudden recollection he
 paused, put liis hand to liis brow, then
 wheeled quickly, and started for the door.

   But before he reached it a smart young
 man—a news peddler—entered with a
 bundle of papers under his arm.

   “Here’s yer Bulletin, Post ’n Report,”
 he cried out. ‘■‘Latest news from Chili.
 Big jump in Associated Virginia-”

  “Here, boy, give me a Bulletin,” in-
 terrupted Dellman.

  After procuring a copy he made his
way to the open air.

  A big jump in Associated Virginia
meant that he had missed the chance of
his life.

  The other day when the stock went
down lie bad sold out at a great loss, fear-
ing that the bottom of the concern would
fall out entirely if he held on.

  He glanced at the list of the lucky
 ones in this new mining deal, and sighed.

  From the mining news he turned his
eye to the personals, as was his daily
habit.

   He started, turned pale, and then let
 fall a string of oaths when he read these

 lines:

  “Among the passengers by the Sum-
mer Queen, this afternoon for Honolulu,
was Marcus Astorel, Esq., the well-
known broker, who goes to the islands
for his health. ”

CHAPTER II.

  PREPARING FOR THE CAMPAIGN.

   The news peddler was Chick.

  As Albert Dellman, with the paper in
 hand, disappeared through the door,
 Chick looked at his superior, and
 grinned knowingly.

Nick approached and bought a paper.

  “Astorel got off, did he?” he asked,
 in a low voice.

“Yes.”

“Follow Dellman, find out where he

goes and what he does between now and
four o’clock, then report to me.”

  “Where shall I find you?”

  “At a sailors’ boarding-house on Clay
street near the water front. You’ll know
the place by the big woodeu eagle over
the entrance.’’

  “Very well. ”

  Chick was off without another word.
The great detective went to the door
and watched the shadowed and the sliad-
ower until they were out of sight.

  Then he hastened to the Palace Hotel,
where he remained an hour.

  At four o'clock he was at the sailors’
lodging-house on Clay street awaiting
the appearance of his brave and keen-
witted assistant.

  Chick was on time, his honest features
aglow with excitement.

  “Well?” said his chief.

  “Followed Mister Man to a French
restaurant on Dupont street. Fie went
into a private stall, I went info the one
adjoining. The partitions are low, and I
managed to look down on him without
his becoming aware of the fact.”

  “What did you see?” -
“I saw him open the paper he bought
of me and read the mining and personal
columns several times over.”

  “What was his manner?”

  “He was pale and nervous at first, but
when at last he put away the paper, his
face had regained its ordinary color and
expression, and he fell to on the raw oys-
ters he had ordered as cool as a cucum-
ber.”

  “What do you infer?”

  “That be has either ’dropped to our
game, or has discovered a new way to cor-
ral the fifty thousand lie was counting on
for this evening. ”

  “I don’t think he suspects trickery,”
observed Nick, after a pause.

  “Come to think of it, I don’t, either.”
“Then he has concocted some new
scheme. ”
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

  “Against whom?”

  “Mrs. Astorel and her daughter.”
“That ought to suit our arrangement. ”
“It does, for it is in the commission
of some new act of villainy that we must
hope to trap him and render him in fu-
ture powerless to work injury against
any one but himself. What did he do
after finishing his oysters?”

  “Paid for them and walked out of the
restaurant.”

  “Where did he go?”

  “To a saloon on Dupont street, fre-
quented by the sporting fraternity, ‘pugs,’
and their satellites principally. I fol-
lowed him, and saw him enter into earn-
est conversation with a Tar Flat bruiser,
a fellow who has done time in San Quen-
tin for robbery.”

  “Do I know him?”

  “I should think you did. It’s Flat-
Nosed Batson, who was run out of Chi-
cago by the police at the time of the an-
archist excitement.”

  “Yes, I do know him, and I owe him
one for a headache he gave me once when
I was working up a case for Chief Mc-
Caughrev on the Lake shore. Did you
overhear their conversation ?”

           #

  ‘‘Part of it. They spoke in whispers,
but I have an acute ear, and besides they
were not far from the lunch counter which
was my coign of vantage at the time.”
“Repeat what you heard. ”

  “ ‘Batson,’ said Dell man, ‘I want
to play a joke on a certain individual in
this city. This is no place to talk the
matter over, so meet me at seven o’clock
at my office< at the Merchants’ Ex-
change. ’ ’

   “Batson promised to be there, and they
separated. ’ ’

  “But you did not lose sight of Deli-
man ?”

  “Oh, no. From the saloon he went to
the Russ House, and in the reading-room
sat down at a-desk, and wrote a letter,

sealed, stamped it and put it in the letter-
box at the corner.”

  “ It’s a pity you could not have read
the address.”

  “I did read it.”

  “Chick, you’re comin on.”

  “Thank you. The address was ‘Miss
Hester Astorel, No. — Broadway, Oak-
land.’ ”

  “Good. We’ll know what it contains
before many hours.”

  “From the letter-box Dellman went to
his room in a Bush street lodging-house,
and is there yet for aught I know to the
contrary. ”

  The conversation above detailed had
taken place in a little up-stairs room in
the sailors’ lodging-house, hired for the
occasion by the great detective.

  When Chick had concluded his state-
ment, Nick wrote two letters, one to
Chief Crowley, with an iuclosure; the
other to Albert Dellman.

  “Go to the city hall first,” said the de-
tective to his assistant, “and have Chief
Crowley O. K. the newspaper copy which
I have inclosed. As for the other business
mentioned in my note, he can attend to
that without your assistance.”

  “What is the business?”

  “The arrest of Flat-Nosed Batson. He
is wanted in Denver for burglary.”

  “But Batson’s appointment with Dell-
man ? flow will you discover what Asto-
rel’s enemy wants of the man, or wants
done by some.rascal of Batson’s ilk?”
“Your questions, Chick, evidence your
appreciation of the situation. Batson’s
arrest will not interfere with the move-
ment Dellman proposes making, that is if
I know myself, that is if I know myself,
and about this hour in the afternoon I
think I do. ”

Nick spoke with the calm confidence
that was a part of his nature.

  “The other letter which you hold in
your hands, Chick, is addressed to Albert
Dellman, and is signed ‘James Batson.’ ”
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.	”

  ‘I see your game, sir, but--”

  “You are afraid Dellman may detect

the forgery, cli ?’ ’

  “Yes.”

  “No danger on that score, my good fel-
low, for I happen to know just what kind
of a fist our man * of tlie flat-nose writes.
It is in back-hand style, and is easily im-
itated.”

  “I might have known that you would
not make a miscue. ”

  “The letter states that the writer lias
been arrested, that there is no hope of es-
caping conviction, and recommends that
the business of playing a joke on some-
body, which Dellman desires transactedt
be intrusted to the writer’s pal, Nevada
Saul.”

  “Precisely, and Nevada Saul will be
Kick Carter. ”

  “Of course. And Batson, per Car.ter,
further conveys the information that Saul
may be found at this place at seven
o’clock this evening. Now hurry off,
Chick, and get that newspaper copy fixed
by the chief, for I want it to appear in
the last edition of the Bulletin this after-
noon. You’ll have time, I think.”

  Chick was off like a shot.

  An hour later Flat-Nosed Batson occu-
pied a cell in the city prison.

  The captain in charge received orders
to permit no visitors to see or talk with
the prisoner unless by order of Nick or
one of the superior judges.

  The six o’clock edition of the Bulletin
contained an additional number of perso-
nal items.

  One read as follows:

  “Col. Bentlv Henderson, of Missouri,
one of the inillionaire railroad builders of
that State, arrived in town this afternoon.
He is the uncle of Mrs. Astorel,. whose
husband is now on the ocean, bound for
Honolulu. He will remain in the State for
several weeks. ”

  Nick Carter read the item and smiled
in satisfaction.

  “That will catch him, I think,” he
said to himself.

  At seven o’clock, the detective, dis-
guised as Nevada Saul, received a visi-
tor at the little room in the sailors’
boarding-house.

  The visitor was Albert Dellman.

CHAPTER III.

A MURDEROUS SCHEME.

  Dellman bestowed a searching look on
the disguised detective as he entered the
room.

  “He’s satisfied,” thought Nick, as the
villian shifted his gaze to the side win-
dow, which overlooked a small, dirt}'
alley.

  Placing a chair close to this window,
Dellman sat down, and opened the con-
versation.

  “Were you expecting me?” he asked,
carelessly.

  “Yes, Flat-Nosed Batson said you’d
probably whirl in and gimme a job ef I
waited here for yer this evenin’.”

  “H’m! What do you know of Batson ?”
“I know he's a thurrerbred, an’ that
lie’s in a hole. ’ ’

“Were you ever a partner of his?”
“Was I a pardiier? I should ree-mark.
Some o’ tlier neatest jobs 011 the coast
war did over thar in Nevady when we
worked together.”

  “Batson probably told you that I
wanted his assistance in playing a joke 011
a friend of mine, didn’t he?”

  “Yes.”

  “Did he say anything more?”

  “Not a word. P’raps he might ha’ un-
loaded his mind, if he’d knowed anything
more ’bout tlier business.”

  Dellman took out his cigar case, selected
two cigars, and offered one to Nick.

  Soon the two men were puffing con-
tentedly away.

  “The joke, if played at all must be
8	NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

played to-night,” said Dellman, after a
pause.

  “I’ll do whatever Flat-Nosed Batson
would ha’ done, s’long’s there’s boodle
in prospect.”

  “ You shall be well paid for your ser-
vices. You can spar, I suppose?”

  “Spar! Now you shout. I kin spar for
anything, from a drink to a square
meal.”

  “You misunderstand me, perhaps,” re-
turned Dellman, quietly, with his cold
gray eyes intently fixed upon the false
Saul’s face, “for I spoke in a fistic sense.
For example,” and the speaker doubled
up his fists, assumed a pugilistic attitude,
and made several passes at an imaginary
opponent.

  Nick broke into a loud guffaw at this
exhibition.

  “Spar! That’s too fancy a word for
me, old boss. “Slugs’ tlier caper, see?”
and on the instant Nick executed a num-
ber of movements with such swiftness
and dexterity as to cause Dellman to nod
his head in delighted approval.

  “You’ll do, I fancy,” he remarked,
“and now for action. First, I will show
you the man on whom the joke is to be
played.”

  Dellman arose and opened the door,
and Nick passed out in a very curious
frame of mind.

  The villain had fallen into the trap too
read i 1 y.

  But the adventure had commenced and
the courageous detective was determined
to see it to the end.

  Up Clay street they went, past San-
some, and into Leidesdorff.

  The latter is a short, dark, narrow little
street, but little used at night by repu-
table people on account of the exceptional
facilities it offers for the commission of
robbery.

  Into Leidesdorff street Dellman turned,
Nick closely following.

  Under a lamp-postat the corner of Sac-

ramento street, the guide stopped and
looked at his watch.

  “Five minutes to eight,” he said.
“He’ll be herein five minutes.”

  The disguised detective waited in some
impatience for the man to appear, in or-
der that the next move in the peculiar
game that was being played might be
made.

  At eight o’clock a policeman slowly
sauntered up to the corner where the two
men were standing.

  He looked sharply into their faces and
then passed on.

  A thrill passed through Nick’s frame
as he met the searching gaze of the
guardian of the peace.

  “That’s the man,” said Dellman in a
whisper.

  “What!” Nick whispered back. “Is
their joke to be played on a copper?”
“Yes.”

  “What is ther style o’ the joke ?”
“This. Y7ou must follow him to Cali-
fornia street, and when you see him go
down some stairs into a basement, you
must be close 011 his heels, so that when
he turns you can play the joke.”

  “Suppose he does not turn round, but
waltzes into ther basement. ”

  “All the better, for it is not tenanted,
is in fact a large empty store-room, where
the tramps occasionally hang out. ”

“All right. Now about ther joke.”
“It is to be played with this joker.”
Dellman drew a sand-club from his
breast and handed it to the false Nevada
Saul.

  “Strike back of the ear, and strike
hard. Here’s five hundred dollars in ad-
vance. Five hundred more goes into your
hand when you’ve laid him out.”

  Nick shoved the notes which Dellman
held out into his pocket, and then asked:
‘'Where’ll I run across you to corral
the other five hundred?”

  “At the basement dooi. I’ll be on the
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.	'	9

spot so soon as you have completed the
job. ”

  “Null sed, and now to business, for
the copper is half way to California street

 now. ’ ’

  So savin" Nick liurried away and he
chuckled softly to himself as his feet
lightly brushed the cobblestones of the

 roadway.

  Tlie policeman was in the act of de-
scending the stairs to the unlighted base-
ment, in a silent and unlighted part of
the street, when Nick prepared to pounce

upon him.

  But the night guardian turned before
thesand-club could be raised, and with a
few quickly spoken words, allowed his
own club to come into play with the effect
of stretching the great detective at full
length at the toot of the stairs.

   He lay like a log, without motion.

  The policeman was bending over him
when an eager voice, the voice of Albert
Delhnau, caused him to look up with a
start.”

  “Have you fixed him?”

   “I reckon I have, captain.

  “Anyway, he declines to breathe, as
you may observe.”

   The villain rubbed his hands gleefully.

  “How well I played my little game,”
he chuckled. “Hoodwinked and laid out
the greatest detective in the United
States. Ha, ha! Sam, but this night has
been a good one for both of us, indeed.

  “How about the blunt?” queried the
policeman, coldly.

   “Yes, yes, you shall be paid. First I’ll
 go through Mr. Nick Carter’s clothes and
 hand you the five hundred dollars he
 thought he had picked up in the softest
 snap he had ever struck, and then I’ll add
 to it five hundred out of my own pocket.”

  Nick had placed the notes in his vest-
pocket, so the arcli-villain had no diffi-
culty in finding them.

  “A thousand dollars, Boston Sam, isn’t

bad for one clip over the head with a
club, eh?”

  “No.”

  “You’ve probably robbed drunks and
blackmailed Chinamen at much less profit
per night. ”

  “What I’ve done is none of your busi-
ness,” Boston Sam surlily returned.

  “No, I suppose not. I was only jok-
ing, yon know. This is my joking night.
I wanted to plaj' a joke on Nick Carter,
alul I’ve done it. But the joke is not en-
tirely played yet. We must get tnis body
into the basement and examine it for
signs of life. ”

  The door was unlocked, and the body
was carried in.

  In the middle of the room was a pile of
empty dry-goods boxes.

  Behind these the body was deposited.
Dellman then returned to the door, and
locked it with a key taken from his
pocket.

  Boston Sam produced his bull’s-eye
lantern and flashed the rays upon the de-
tective’s face.

  Nick’s eyes were closed, his cheeks
were pale as death.

  Delhnau knelt down and placed his
ear over the detective’s heart.

  “It beats faintly, ” he said. “He’s just
alive and that’s all. ”

  “Do you want him dead ?” asked the
murderous policeman.

  “Dead as a herring. Did you not un-
derstand me when I made the bargain
with you? Didn’t I tell you I wanted you
to knock him out for good and all?”
replied Dellman, angrily.

  “Oh, very well,” was the careless re-
sponse. “I’d as soon give him a second
crack as not. Want to see it done?”

  “Yes—no. I’ll step to the other side
of the boxes while you paste him. Give
him enough this time, for the fellow has
escaped death so often that it’s not policy
to take any chances with him now. ”

  The villain took himself from the sight
10	NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

of his cold-blooded tool, and tlie detective
victim.

  A number of heavy blows, each fol-
lowed by a sickening thud, satisfied the
listener that the murderous work was be-
ing; done by an expert at the business.

  “Now what do you think?” Boston
Sam hoarsely cried out.

  Dellman stepped from behind the
boxes, and by tlie lantern’s light beheld
a spectacle that made him shudder, case-
hardened though he was.

  The detective's face was covered with
blood, blood streamed from his ears and
nostrils, while his hair was matted with
gore.

  There was every indication that his
skull had been broken, and that his ca-
reer had been abruptly cut short.

  “What shall we do with it?” asked the
murderer, pointing to the ghastly sight.

  “Feed it to the rats. There’s a trap-
door opening into a still lower-room, a
former receptacle for smuggled goods.
There’s nothing there now but rats, hun-
dreds of them, and all hungry and
vicious. They won’t leave a scrap of
flesh on his bones. What do you think
of the scheme?”

  “It couldn’t be improved upon,
but--”

  “But what?1’

   “I’ll need a drink before I go any fur-
ther.

  “I’m as weak as a cat now. The air
down here is not suited to my constitu-
tion. ”

  “I’ll go out and get you a drink.”

  Dellman hurried away to return in five
minutes with a bottle of whisky.

  “There,” lie said, “drink that, and
then rush the business through. I want
to getaway from here, for I’ve other busi-
ness to attend to that can’t be post-
poned. ’ ’

  Boston Sam took the bottle, sat down
on a box, and took liis time in putting
down the “bracer.”

  When he returned the bottle to Dell-
man over half the contents had been
poured out.

  The lantern meanwhile had been rest-
ing on the floor with the light turned
from the spot where the detective’s body
had lain.

  “Well, let’s be going,” remarked the
policeman, as he smacked his lips, “for
the job’s done.”

 “What!”

  Dellman snatched up the lantern and
brought the light to bear 011 the place of
murder.

  Nick Carter’s body was 110 longer
there.

  Before the villain could open his mouth
to express his astonishment his murder-
ous tool coolly remarked :

   ‘‘ He’s gone to the rats. ’ ’

  Dellman rushed to the trap-door, lan-
tern in hand, opened it, and looked
down.

  He saw a legion of ravenous rats squeal-
ing and fighting over some tempting mor-
sel that had but recently fallen into their
den.

  And from the hole there arose the sick-
ening smell of raw, warm flesh.

  The villain closed the trap, and rose to
his feet as pale as death.

  “How came you to do this?” he asked,
gaspingly.

  “I heard footsteps outside, and fearing
tnat some fool might stagger in and ob-
lige me to commit another murder, I
rushed the stiff into the hole as quick as
you please. ’ ’

  “All right, all right. Now for to-mor-
row’s business. You are to go to Oakland
in the morning. See the chief, and get a
lay off for a couple of days. If lie kicks
any, resign from the force, for there’s
money enough in the work 011 hand to
keep you in idleness for the rest of your
life. ’ ’

  “I’m your tamate, captain.”
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.	11

   “You will rind me at the Galeudo Ho-
tel at nine o’clock. ”

   “I’ll be there on time.”

   “When I meet you there I will tell you
what I want done. ’ ’

   “Very well.”

   The two men parted at the California
street corner.

  Dellman took his way homeward in a
satisfied frame of mind.

  When he had passed from sight, Bos-
ton Sam walked slowly back to the
basement.

   He reached it just as a man was com-
ing out of the door.

  The man was Nick'Carter.

   “All serene, Chick?”

   “Yes,1' said Chick, alias Boston Sam,
“we’ve fooled him beautifully.”

  “You’ve fooled him, you mean, for
this night’s work goes to your credit,
Chick, not mine. ’ ’

CHAPTER IV.

PREPARING THE TRAP.

  Half an hour after the Leidesdorff
street adventure, the two detectives occu-
pied a private stall in a Market street

restaurant.

   While they refreshed themselves Chick
told his story.

   “After I left you in the afternoon,”
he began, “I went as directed to the city
hall and was fortunate enough to find
Chief Crowley in his office.

  ‘‘‘I am al ways happy to oblige my
friend Carter,’ said he, when he had read
the note, and within ten minutes there-
after two commissions had been executed
—an officer had been dispatched to arrest
Mat-Nosed Batson forthwith, and a mes-
senger had been sent to the Bulletin office
with the personal which the chief had
indorsed.

   "Col. Crowley wanted me to dine with
him, but I had to decline on account of

the important nature of the business that
engrossed my attention.

  ‘'After Batson had been brought in, I
hurried to Dellman’s lodgings, and here
again luck favored me. He was in, and I
gave the note into his hands, but was off
before he could read it.

   “I waited across the street, in a little
news-stand, until became out, and I shad-
owed him to the city hall.

  “In the belief that his steps would be
directed to the city prison, I took a cut
off to the place by way of Merchant
street, and was behind the door in Cap-
tain Lindheimer’s office, and concealed
from observation when he appeared and
asked to see the prisoner, Batson.

  “Captain Lindheimer, who had been
hurriedly posted by me as to the situation,
courteously complied with the arch-vil-
lain ’s request, and conducted him to the
cell where Batson was playing checkers
with his nose.

  “As soon as Captaj.il Lindheimer had
locked Dellman in he gave me the oppor-
tunity I wanted of overhearing the conver-
sation between the two men, by putting
me into the cell adjoining, which is pro-
vided with excellent eavesdropping facili-
ties.

  “The first question asked by Dellman
was • in refernce to the letter signed
‘Jair.es Batson. ’

   “ ‘Did you write that?’ he said.

  “Flat-Nose looked at it in amaze-
ment. ‘Not by a jugful, I didn’t,’ he
answered. ‘Who in blazes has been for-
gin’ my hand-write?’

  “ ‘I know the rooster,’ said Dellman,
emphatically. ‘Pie’s Nick Carter, the
shrewdest and most dangerous detective
on the American Continent.’

  “ ‘The deuce you say !’ and you ought
to have seen Batson’s expression when he
spoke. He was as white as a sheet, and
he looked as scared as if he had seen a
ghost.

  “ ‘My God !’ he went on. ‘Then I’m
12	NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

done for. If Nick Carter is in San Fran-
cisco, my arrest lies at liis door, and my
conviction will be certain. But how do
you know that it is Carter?’

  “ ‘How do I know? Never mind how
I obtain my information. But all tlie
same, the man who put you in quod is
Nick Carter. ’

  “Batson dropped his eyes to the floor,
and did not say anything for some time.

  “Every now and then, however, he
would sigh deeply.

  “At last he looked up and regarded
Dellman queerlv.

  “ ‘You wouldn’t have come to see me,’
he said, ‘if you hadn't a point to make.
What is it?’

  “ ‘I want to help you, at the same
time, help myself.’

  “ ‘Help me! Can you do it?’

  “He clasped his hands, the big duffer,
and looked entreatiugly at the cold, cal-
culating villain before him.

  “ ‘I can help you,.I think. Let me ask
one question first. If Nick Carter were
out of the way, would you have any
chance of escaping conviction on the
charge for which you have been ar-
rested ?’

  “ ‘Every chance in the world. The
case was put into Nick’s hands by the
Denver chief of police. The detective has
never reported what lie has found out
about the case. I know that, for I have a
pal in Colorado who is in a position to
keep me well posted. I know further that
Nick lias got me dead to rights, and that
he will pull the string that will let me
down into the mire, when he gets me be-
fore the Den ver court. ’

  “ ‘Good. I’ll lay Nick Carter out before

midnight. ’

  “ ‘You will? But how?’

  “ ‘Never mind how. Leave that busi-
ness to me. Now, for your assistance. Do
you know of anyone in San Francisco
who can be trusted to perform the work
for which I engaged your services?’

  “ ‘Yes. There’s one man, he’s a jim-
dandy— the finest fakir on the coast. He
has strength, nerve, and audacity, and
can be depended on to Work any kind of
a snap, from cracking a crib to slitting a
weaznnd, as long as there’s money in it.’
“ ‘Where can I find this paragon of
criminals ?’

   “ ‘On the police force. ’

  “ ‘What!’

  “ ‘On the police force, I tell von.’

  “ ‘Come now, Batson, I want 110 jest-
ing. This is a serious matter, serious for
you and serious for me.’

  il ‘I’m not jesting. Boston Sam is 011
the force, but only for this week. He’s a
sub, and got in through political influ-
ence. ’

  “ ‘Does Chief Crowley know his char-
acter and antecedents?

  “ ‘Not he. Boston Sam always hums
his bridges behind him. There isn’t a
man in the city who is on to him but
me. ’

  “ ‘Where shall I fhjd him ?’

  Batson named the beat, which included
Leidesdorff street.

  “Nothing more of importance was said
between them, and soon Dellman iook
his leave.

  “It was then five o’clock.

  “Captain Lindheimerinformed me that
Boston Sam would report for duty at six.

  “ ‘Do you know where he hangs out?’
I asked.

  “ ‘At the Red Retreat, 011 Stockton
street. ’

  “Fifteen minutes later I was in the re-
treat, a corner saloon with a snide grocery
attachment, and in conversation with
Boston Sam.

  “I gave him a note from Captain Lind-
lieimer, informing him that his services
would not be required that night.

  “A-fter he had read it, I told him I was
a Sacramento constable, and that I was
looking for a burglar who was supposed
to be in Sausalito. I gave a faked descrip-
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.	13

tion of my alleged quarry, and offered
Boston Sam twenty dollars if lie would
go over to Saueelito by the next boat and
make the am .-L for me.

   “He jumped at the offer like a pike for
a young sucker, and when I parted with
him at tlie cable ear which was to take
him to the water front, it was half-past
five.

  “I hud then just thirty minutes in
which to do a change and get to the city
hall. To prove that I have profiled by
your instructions, I will say that at six
o’clock precise!v, I was in Captain Lind-
heimer’s office and ready to go on duty
for the night as Iloston Sam.”

  “"Chick, you're a briek,” said Nick
with enthusiasm.

  “Don’t mention it. As I was on n.y
way down Merchant street toward Mont-
gomery, I nu t Dellman. He accosted me
as Boston Sam, gave me a note from
Flat-Nosed Batson, and invited me into a
saloon to have a chat.

  “That sort of business wouldn’t do at
all, you know, and so I informed him.
He then suggested that we slip into a hall-
way [on Commercial street and do our
talking. I consented to this, and was
soon put into possession of the details of
the fiendish plot that had been concocted
against you. “I knew )ou would recog-
nize me when I stopped at the Sacra-
mento street corner, and that you would
take a quick tumble to the little racket I
had entered upon. ”

  “You acted with consummate ingenuity
and skill, Chick, ” said the great detec-
tive, approvingly. “I couldn’t have done
better myself. ”

  This was great praise, but the faithful
assistant fully deserved it.

  “There was one thing, as you know,
that bothered me, and that was, how to
make Dellman believe that you had really
been cast into the hole to constitute a din-
ner for the rats. I had carried out the
other portions of my scheme of deception

well enough. I had faked blood with red
paint, an I had hit my boot, in lieu of
your head, with my club until my toes
and instep ache even now ; but I might
have slipped up on the most important
part of tlie programme, if I had not spied
a big black cat behind the boxes just as
Dellman was going out to get me tlie
drink of whisky.

  “That cat had never done me any
harm, but it had to be sacrificed all the
same, and the smell of raw warm flesh
which greeted the villain’s nostrils had
something feline but nothing human in its
nature. ”

  Chick’s story was told.

  And the telling not only demonstrated
the j-ouug detective’s courage and astute-
ness, but it also proved that Albert Dell-
man was a foe worthy of the great detec-
tive’s skill.

  Nick had never counted on the possi-
bility of the villain either penetrating his
disguise, or discovering his presence in
San Francisco.

  “That fellow must know me, that’s
certain,” mused the detective, “and yet
to save my life, I can’t place him. Who
can he really be, I wonder?

  “Chick,” said he, after a period of se-
rious reflection, “you must play Boston
Sam fot me one more day. You must
keep that Oakland appointment.”

  Further plans were discussed before
bedtime came.

  Nick, in a new disguise, that of a
smart appearing book canvasser, was a
passenger 011 the first boat for Oakland
which left the Market street slip the
next morning.

  Dellman was to meet the bogus Boston
Sam at nine o’clock, and Nick wanted to
transact a little business in the city of oaks
before giving his special attention to the
master villain.

  It was not yet eight o’clock, when he
knocked at the door of a neat cottage on
14	NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

Broadway, a few blocks from the old
post-office corner.

  The door was opened by a pert maid
in a white apron, and •with her sleeves
rolled up.

  “We don’t want any books,” she said,
brusquely, and would have shut the door
in his face, had not Nick uttered the one
word :

  “ Rondelle!”

  The girl turned pale, glanced quickly
over her shoulder, and then faltered out
an invitation to come in.

  “Can I speak with you on the quiet?”
said Nick, in a low voice.

  “Yes.”

   She led the way into the front parlor.

  Her hand trembled as she opened the
door for him to enter.

   Nick’s face wore a smile of satisfaction.

  He knew the girl having formed her
acquaintance some years before when she
was serving as maid for Rondelle, the
notorious confidence operator, who after-
ward came to grief in Sacramento.

  To find her in service at the Vane
House, where Mrs. Astorel and her
daughter were temporarily residing was a
suspicious circumstance, and before pro-
ceeding with the business that had
brought him to the house, the great de-
tective resolved to subject her to a little
judicious catechism.

  “Now, Miss Serena Dare, ” he said,
sternly, when lie had seated himself in a
comfortable arm-chair, “it will be good
policy on your part to answer truthfullv
/ «•
such questions as I may put to you touch -
ing your position in this house, and the
motive that brought you to it.”

  “Who are you?” she hoarsely, de-
manded, after a vain attempt to discover
his identity.

  “Did ybu ever hear of Chief Rogers of
Sacramento?”

  “Yes. ”

   She shivered as she uttered the word.

  “Now, it does notin the least matter

who I am,” Nick went on with grim
composure, “so long as I am in Chief
Rogers’ confidence, and know that for
the last six months a warrant has been
out for the arrest of a certain pretty panel
thief,who was known last 5-ear in New
York as ‘Pretty Jane, ’ but who was
christened Serena Dare when she was an
innocent babe, some twenty-six years
ago. ”

  The girl’s face flushed at this correct
statement of her age.

  She did not look more than sweet six-
teen.

  “I know you now,” she said as she
bit her lips in fear and wrath ; “you are
Nick Carter.”

  “Wrong.”

  “Then who are you, if not he?”
“Iam Chick, the Little Giant’s assis-
tant. ”

  “I’ve heard of you. But where is your
superior ?”

  “Don’t know. Maybe dead. Haven’t
seen him since yesterday afternoon.”
“Never mind him, then. What’s your
lay-? What do you want ?”

  The girl was recovering her self-pos-
session.

  “There is but one Nick Carter,” ran
her thoughts at this juncture “He is in-
deed a terror, but I’m not afraid of a doz-
en Chicks or Dicks or Toms or Harrys. ”
“What do I want?” said Nick. “In-
formation, nothing more and nothing
less. ”

   ‘ ‘About what ?”

  “About you.”

  “I’m nobody—just a plain servant-
girl ; wages, twelve dollars a month and
found. ”

  “Not wanting, I hope.”

  “Sir.”

  Miss Dare gave the false Chick a look
of lofty contempt.

  “See here, Serena, this won’t do, won’t
do at all. See?”
NICK CAKIER WEEKLY.	15

 “Can’t see for the dust in the room.
 Haven’t swept yet. ”

 “That ought to be an easy job for
 you.”

 “Why?”

 “You have such a sweeping manner.”

 Nick gave utterance to a low chuckle.

 Then he glanced at his watch.

 No time for chaffing. He must get
 down at once to bed rock business.

 The girl was turning her back on him,
 when he said abruptly and with more
 sternness than lie had hitherto assumed :

 “Sit down and answer my questions.
 Your fate is in my hands. If you refuse
 to obey me, I’ll have you in jail for that
 Sacramento job in less than half an
 hour. ”

 Miss Dare began to tremble again.

 She sat down and faced him.

 “Will you promise not to use your
 knowledge against me if T answer your
 questions to the best of my ability?”

 “I will not only make that promise,
 but I will give you the further assurance
 that yon shall never be prosecuted for the
 crime. ”

 “Ah!” with a sigh of intense relief,
 ‘‘then I am satisfied. Go ahead with
 your questions. ’ ’

 Nick had been quite eas\T in his mind
 when he made the promise.

 He neither run any risk in doing so,
 nor did he put any onerous task upon his
 shoulders.

 The man upon whom the panel game
 had been played had died the week before
 in Spokane.

 Nick had learned the fact before he had
 left San Francisco.

 It was evident from Miss Dare’s lack
 of knowledge on the point that she was
 not a very close reader of the daily pa-
 pers.

 I lie examination began in this wise:

 How long have you been in service
 here ?”

 “Since yesterday.”

  “Who engaged you?”

  “Mrs. Vane.”

  “Through an advertisement?”

  “No.”

  “At an employment office?”

  “No.”

  “How, then ?’ ’

  “I made a personal application for the
place.”

  “How did you know there was a va-
cancy?”

  “I did not know. ”

  “Then some one must have sent you
here?”

  “Some one did. ”

  “What is some one’s name?”

  “A gentleman I used to know in Sacra-
mento. ”

  “Don’t close up like an oyster at the
most important point, Serena. A gentle-
man from Sacramento is very indefinite.
I do not doubt but that there are several
gentlemen in Sacramento, and it may be
—it’s a bare possibility, Serena—that
your friend from the capital city may not
be a gentleman in the proper sense of the
term. I’ll write to Chief Rodgers for a list
of all the gentlemen in his bailiwick. If
his name appears thereon, I’ll call at the
jail, Serena, and let you pick it out. ”

  Her eyes snapped savagely, but she
made no answer.

  “Out with the name, Serena, or--”

  “His name is Albert Dellman.”

  “I thought so. ”

  “What do you know against him?
Nothing,, for he is one of the most re-
spected and popular residents of San
Francisco. ”

  “Is he? Then he doesn’t live in Sacra-
mento now?”

  “He never lived there. I met him
while he was up on a visit.”

   “Of pleasure ?’ ’

  “Pleasure and business.”

  “Strange that such a reputable gentle-
man should have become the friend of a
panel—but, no, Serena, I’ll not refer to
16	NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

 your past again. Now that you’ve turned
 over a new leaf, all shall be forgotten.”
 The girl looked at him and shut her
 lips tightly.

    ‘‘She could murder me with pleasure at
 this moment,” thought Nick.

    The examination was resumed.

    “Albert Dellman sent you here for a
 purpose. What was it?”

    “To keep him informed as to the go-
 - ings on in the house—who came, who
 went, what was said, and what was
 done. ”

   “Anything more?”

   “No.”

    “Other instructions to come later, I
 presume ?”

   “Presume what you like—I don’t
 know. ”

   “Where were you to meet him and
 make your report?”

   “At the Galendo Hotel, room-”

   “When?”

    “Every evening at eight o’clock, until
 further orders.”

   “Very good. Now then, Serena, you
 will not keep any of these appointments,
 nor will you see Mr. Dellman again, not
 even if he calls in person at the house
 and asks for you.”

   Miss Dare bowed her head in acqui-
 esence of the arrangement.

    A few more words in relation to her
 conduct while she remained under the
 Vane roof, and the detective curtly re-
 quested her to inform Miss Hester Astorel
 that he desired to see her at once on
 business of pressing importance.

    A few moments elapsed and the daugh-
 ter of the millionaire entered the parlor.

    She was a demi-brunefcte, with a low,
 broad brow, serious gray eyes, a face of
 rare loveliness, and a tall, symmetrical
 figure, and she carried herself with the
 grace and dignity of a duchess.

    Her face was grave when she entered
 the room, but when Serena Dare had
 closed the door behind her and she found

herself alone with the disguised detec-
tive, her eyes sparkled with pleasme, and
she came forward, and, offering him her
hand, spoke thus impulsively :

  “Oh, Mr. Carter, how glad I am that
you have come. I had every confidence
in you, of course, but I feared after what
papa said when he came home yesterday
that you might meet with some terrible
accident, and leave us defenseless.”

   “Accidentswill happen,” Nick replied,
“but then, if I failed to keep my engage-
ment, there was Chick, who could take
my place.”

  “Yes, yes, but I am glad that you
have come. ”

  “Are you certain that I am really
Nick Carter?” said the great detective,
laughingly. “We have met before, I am
in disguise, and yet you implicitly con-
fide in me as the genuine and only Nicho-
las C. ”

  “I trust to my intuition. It never
failed me yet,” she responded, quietly.

  “And may it never fail you,” said
Nick, earnestly. “Now to business, for
my time is short. Did you receive a let-
ter last night or tin's morning from Al-
bert Dellman?”

   “ Yes. ”

   “Will you allow me to read it?”

   “Certainly.”

  While she was gone from the room to
get the letter, Nick glanced at his watch.

   Half-past eight.

  An important move must be made be-
fore nine o'clock.

   He was prepared to make it.

CHAPTER V.

DANGER IN THE AIR.

   Hester Astorel was gone but a few mo-
ments.

   Nick took the letter which she placed
in his hands and read the following:

  “Miss Astorel:—A rumor has reached
my ears that yourself and your mother
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.	17

look upon me os the enemy whose evil
machinations against your father induced
his hurried flight to Honolulu. A de-
cent regard for my honor, my reputation,

hitherto n 11 assailed, demands that I
should at once offer such proof as must
convince you that the rumor is as base-
less as it is malicious and cowardly.

  “As an act of justice to myself will you
permit me to call upon you as soon as
possible? An immediate answer is earn-
estly request* d.

      “Most respectfully yours,

“Albert Dellman.”

  “A very cunning effusion,” said Nick,
when he had finished reading the letter,
“but luckily 110 one will be deceived by
it.”

  “Thanks to you, Mr. Carter.”

 “He knows very well that his name
has not yet been publicly connected with
your father’s departure,” the detective
went on, “and he also knows, or has
every reason to know, that Mr. Astorel
made 110 secret to his family of the knowl-
edge lie had gained relating to the villian
who had robbed him.

  “Therefore, Miss Astorel, the point he
aims to make is to clear his skirts with
you. What his object can be, 1 leave for
you to judge. ’*

 Nick gave her a look whose meaning
she was quick to interpret.

  “I have never met the man but once,”
she said, “and he has never pretended to
be an admirer. ’’

  “Perhaps he admires your fortune.”
“Perhaps he does, but his admiration
shall not profit him any.”

  “Vet I would advise you to answer the
letter, and grant his request. ”

  “Very well, Mr. Carter.”

  “You might make the appointment for
to-morrow evening, if convenient. ”

  “Yes, that will suit.”

  "If you should meet him anywhere to-
day do not speak to him.”

  “I do not think there is any likelihood
0f my meeting him to-day.”

  “Are you not going to the Warner Mil-
ler reception ?”

  “Yes.”

  “With your mother?”

  “Yes.”

  “Then if you do not see Albert Dell-
man there, he will have his eyes 011 you
beyond the shadow of a doubt. And I will
not be surprised if your humble servant
comes in for a large share of the villain’s
attention. ”

  “At the reception?”

  “Yes, for I shall be there in the guise
of your respected uncle, whose existence,
by the way, you never dreamed of until
you read the personal in the Bulletin.”

  After promising to see her again, Nick
hurried off to a cheap lodging-house
down the street, into which lie quickly
disappeared.

  Ten minutes later, just as the clock in
the little office struck nine, there emerged
from the establishment a stout, well-
dressed gentleman with a snowy white
hair and beard, and a noble bearing.

  He walked with an erect figure and a
military tread, using his heavy, gold-
mounted cane, not as an ornament, but
as a necessary aid to locomotion.

  The reception was to be held at the
court-house, and in the forenoon, for tlie
reason that the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce had arranged to honor the
gentleman from New York in the after-
noon.

  Mr. Miller had come to California as
the representative of the Nicaragua Canal
Company, and as the enterprise was one
in which the business men of the State
were vitally interested, he had been
everywhere received in the most cordial
manner.

  The Oakland reception had been ar-
ranged under the auspices of the Board of
Trade, and was not limited to gentlemen,
because there were ladies in Mr. Miller’s
party whose claims to the courteous con-
18	NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

sideration of the Californians could nut
consistently be overlooked.

  The ladies of Oakland had appropriated
the judges’ chambers, adjoinining the
large court-room as a coimnittee-room.

  Here, a short time before the opening
of the proceedings, sat Hester Astorel and
her mother; the latter a handsome, mid-
dle-aged lady, with a plump figure and a
comely and intelligent countenance.

  Her manner was serious and expectant,
and she kept her eyes fixed upon the
doorway.

  The entrance of the old gentleman
with the gold-mounted cane caused her
features to brighten with pleasure and
satisfaction.

  “My dear niece,” spoke the new-com-
er, as he came forward and took her two
hands in his and softly pressed them, “I
am pleased to meet you under these hap-
py circumstances. I saw your husband in
the East and counted on meeting him
here to-day. hut business is business and
he had to sail for the islands.”

  “He went for his health, ” said Mrs.
Astorel, with a smile, which the new-
comer returned. “He had met with some
reverses, and his health had given away
under them. ”

  “Pardon me, then, for having alluded
to the present circumstances as happy
ones. I am deeply grieved to find that

they are tinged with sadness, but--”

  “What can’t be cured must be en-
dured, eh?”

   'Phe ladies started at the voice, which
came from the doorway, and looking up
saw a policeman of the ‘flash” order
standing there with a grin upon his face.

  “Excuse me for interrupting you,” he
said, still grinning, “but I’m used ter
sorrer, and know it ain’t er bit er use
cr\’in’ over spilt milk. See?”

Nick Carter, alias Col. Bently Hender-
son, Mrs. Astorel’s uncle, now spoke up:
“Look here, my man,” he said, pom-
pously, “you may not know with whom
/

you are taking liberties. Another insult-
ing word from your coarse lips and old
as I am, I will arise and throw you into
the street, and there dance upon your
anatomy until you cry for quarter.”

  “Who are you, any how, old skeez-
icks ?”

  “There is my card, sir. ”

  The policeman picked up the piece of
pasteboard which Nick threw at him,
glanced at it coolly, and then as coolly
put it .in his vest-pocket.

  “Colonel, I apologize. I did not know
you were a Missourian. Ta-ta !”

  The policeman disppeared with a
broader grin than ever upon his counte-
nance.

  Outside he was greeted by' Albert Dell-
man.

   * * Well, ” queried the arch-villain, “how
is it, Sam ?”

  “It’s all right,” returped Chick, alias
Boston Sam, “for lie’s in there.”
“Who? The colonel ?”

  “Yes.”

  “Good. His appearance will cause me
to make a change in my programme, but
a change for the better. ”

  “What am I to do?”

  “When the reception is over, get him
into a corner alone.’1

  “I’ve got an excuse to do that. I in-
sulted him, and I’ve apologized, but my
conscience troubles me, and I want to
apologize again.”

  “When you’ve got him alone, tell him
that you are the everlasting friend of any
man who fought in a Missouri regiment;
that you are from Hannibal yourself,
and have often heard his name mentioned
in terms of praise,and admiration by the
people of that section of the State. Give
him a big fill about the chances of pick-
ing up fortunes in California.”

  “But will he listen to all this balder-
dash ?’ ’

  “Listen! He’ll suck it all in like
mothers’ milk. I know the stuff of which
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.	19

these pompous mil itary cusses are made.
They like flattery and they think they
know it all, whereas they are the easiest
people in the world to hoodwink.”

  “All right. I’ll do as you say.”

  “After you’ve got him interested, play
the gold-br ick racket on him. He’ll take
in all you say as gospel truth, 01 else I’m
mistaken in my man.”

  “Where shall I locate the brick?”

  “In the hills, a few miles from town,
oil the Martinez road. Tell him it’s not
far from Joaqui 11 M iller’s mountain home,
and that he can make a call 011 the poet
while he is tip there. ”

  “Well, what next ?”

  “Tell him if he wants to-see the brick,
he must go out with you this afternoon,
or right after the reception. That won’t
take long, for Miller is in a hurry to get
to San Francisco, and you can probably
start bj’ one o’clock.”

  “What am I to do when I get him in
the hills?”

  “Nothing. Just get him out of town,
and leave the rest to me.”

  The pseudo Boston Sam pretended to be
satisfied with the programme, and at once
proceeded to carry out liis part of it.

  Of course lie had no difficulty in per-
suading the false Col. Henderson to take
a ride with him after lunch.

  Nick was not a bit surprised when
Chick related his conversation with A1--
Bert Dellman.

  “Just what I expected, what I wanted
in fact,” he said. “I assumed the role
of the millionaire uncle in order to court
an abduction, and abducted I am going
to be.

  “Albert Dellman is in urgent need of
fifty thousand dollars, and as I have
spoiled his plan to make it out of Marcus
Astorel by sending the broker to Hono-
lulu, he will snap at the first chance that
offers itself to obtain the money by rob-
bing somebody else.

  ‘ After you finish your business in the

hills, Chick, you must drive back to town
and remain there, keeping a close watch
over the Vane residence, until I arrive.”

  “Trust me for that. ”

  “I do trust you, Chick. By the way,
what makes you fidget about so? Is it
pure nervousness from overwork, lack of
sleep, or what ?’ ’

  “I feel out of sorts, why, I don’t know.
Perhaps there is too much electricity in
the air.”

  And the brave fellow tried to laugh off
his nervous feeling, and partially suc-
ceeded.

  Their talk was interrupted by the en-
trance of a number of ladies who an-
nounced that the execrises were about to
begin.

  Nick did not remain to listen to the
speeches, but after a few words with Mrs.
Astorel and her daughter, went to the
Qaleiulo Hotel and registered as Col.
Henderson, of Missouri.

  While the great detective was away,
Chick was talking business with Dellman,
in one of the small back rooms of a Sev-
enth street hotel.

  At one o’clock in the afternoon the dis-
guised detectives, playing the parts of vil-
lain and dupe, respectively, left Oakland
in a spanking rig—a span of fast-stepping
nags, and a handsome phaeton.

  As they passed through the suburban
hamlet of Temescal they both caught a
fleeting glimpse of the face cf a man who
was supposed to be at that moment either
in San cel i to or San Francisco.

  It was that of the genuine Boston Sam,
and he had been sitting at an open win-
dow in the second story of a large build-
ing evidently a hotel or lodging-house,
when the team approached.

  He gave one glance at his counterpart,
and then rose hurriedly and took himself
out of sight.

  “Queer,” muttered Nick, “very queer
indeed.”
r

20	NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

  “I don’t understand it at all,” re-
marked Chick.

  “It’s certain that he did not intend
that we should see him.”

  “Yes, for he dodged back out of sight
the moment he clapped his eyes on me.
What’s up, do you think ?”

  ‘-Something that we had not counted
on, Chick. Dellman has made a discov-
ery of the cheat you have been practicing
on him. ”

  “Do you think, Nick, that he found
out I was not Boston Sam before he sent
me 011 this errand?”

  “No, he was a hoodwinked man up to
the moment we left the morgue.5’

  “But Boston Sam must have seen him,
else he would not be over here in Temes-
cal, close to the foothills, and 011 the
route mapped out for me b\' Dellman.”
“Undoubtedly.”

  The horses by this time had gone a few
blocks past the building.

  “Chick, we must checkmate this game,
if we can. ’ ’

  “Of course.”

  “I will go on with the team, while you
had best get out and interview Mr. Bos-
ton Sam.^t’s a ticklish job I’ve laid out
for you, my boy, but I’ll trust y'ou to car-
ry it through all right ”

  “I’ll do the best I can.”

  Without further words, Nick’s plucky
assistant got out of the phaeton and walked
hiuik to the hotel.

  Boston Sain met him at the foot of the
stairs as he was about to ascend to the
second story.

  The two men, habited alike, and re-
sembling each other so closely that an
intimate friend might have found it hard
work to tell which was the false and
which the true, stared at each other for a
moment without speaking;.

  Then the simon pure Boston Sam
opened his mouth. “I’ve been looking
for you, ” he said.

 “That’s lucky,” returned Chick,
coldly.

  “It’s the biggest kind of luck. Come s
up stairs, won’t you ?”

  Chick followed the reprobate police-
man to the room in which he had been
seen from the phaeton.

  The brave fellow vaguely felt as he
took a seat that there was danger in the
air.

CHAPTER VI.

 CHICK’S DESPERATE ENCOUNTER.

 Once seated in the room, Chick
staxted the ball by saying :

 “What do you want of me?”

  “I want your advice. ”

  “State your case.”

  “First let me explain. I went to Sau-
celito, and did not find your man, of
course. ’ ’

  “Why, of course?”

  “Because the man lives in the moon. I
  got back to San Francisco by the late
  boat last night, and learned from Flat-
  Nosed Batson that I had been monkeyed
  with by a detective.”

  Chick whistled.

  Here was news indeed.

  “Where did you see Batson?’ he asked,
  quickly.

  “At the Red Retreat.”

  “How did he get out of jail ?”

  “On an order from Nick Carter, the
  man who caused his arrest. ”

  “That was a queer proceeding, wasn’t
  it?”

 “No, for Chief Crowley was holding
 Batson subject to Nick Carter’s instruc-
 tions. Crowley would do anything to
 obligt: the New York detective. ”

  “Yes, I presume he would. And where
  is Carter now ?”

  “I have no idea. You ought to know,
  it seems to me. ”

 “Why ought I to know?”
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.	21

 “Because you’re his partner, that’s
 why.”

 “Am I? And how did you arrive at that
 extraordinary conclusion?”

 “By talking with Flat-Nosed Batson
 and afterward with Albert Dellman. We
 put two and two .together, and tumbled
 to the truth in no time. This morning
 I came over to Temescal at Dellman’s
 order. ’ ’

 “Why didn’t you go up into the hills
 with your companions in crime and have
 the settlement with the colonel and my-
 self occur at one and the same moment?”

 Boston Sum grinned.

 “I’d as soon tell you as not,” he said.
 “The boss thought the business might be
 managed better if the forces of both op-
 posing parties were divided.”

“By which you mean that he expects
to make as quick work of the colonel as
you will make of me.”

 “Precisely.”

 The cool audacity of the fuffian “rat-
 tled” Chick somewhat.

 “Well, then,” he said, sternly, as he
 rose to his feet, and put his hand on his
 trusty revolver, “suppose you start in
 now with y our little circus. You have
 been hired to lay me out. Proceed with
 the laying. ’ ’

Boston Sam stood up with a strange
smile on his face.

 He made 110 attempt to draw a revol-
 ver.

 Nor was his attitude an aggressive one.

 IHor one moment he looked at Chick,
 whose pistol was out, and cocked, and
 then suddenly threw up his hands.

On the instant something happened
that Nick Carter’s brave assistant had not

 calculated on.

 When he had entered the room he had
 unthinkingly taken the seat Boston Sam

 had indicated.

 It was directly under a sliding trap-
 door in the ceiling, put in probably for
 Purposes of ventilation.

  When he arose to his feet the door slid
back noiselessly and the face of a man
appeared at the aperture.

  The face belonged to Flat-Nosed Bat-
son.

  One of his hands clasped the handle of
a tailor’s goose weighing a dozen pounds
or more.

  His eyes, meanwhile, were fixed intent-
ly upon the person of Boston Sam.

  When the latter raised his bauds in air,
Flat-Nosed Batson acted.

  Down went the heavy iron in the direc-
tion of the unsuspecting Chick’s head.

  Only a miracle, it seemed, could in-
tervene to save his life.

  Chick could never explaiu why he
moved his position at that supremely crit-
ical moment.

  But he did move' forward a step, invol-
untarily, and the goose, instead of crush-
ing his skull, just grazed his right elbow.

  Striking the young detective’s “funny
bone,” it gave him such a queer sensa-
tion, as of partial paralysis, that he re-
laxed his grasp 011 his revolver and it fell
to the floor.

  He stooped quickly to pick it up, but
before lie could reach it, Boston Sam was
upon him.

  A terrific struggle ensued.

  Boston Sam, as he rushed forward, es-
sayed to throw his arms around the detec-
tive’s neck.

  Without raising his head Chick antici-
pated the movement.

  Before the ex-slugger’s hands touched
liis •'would-be victim’s shoulders, Chick
had him about the waist.

  The next instant the assistant of the
great Nick Carter gave a superb exhibi-
tion of his muscular strength.

  The burly body of Boston Sam rose
quickly in the air, and as quickly shot
backward and descended with crushing
force against the plastered partition.

  Panting from the terrific effort he had
put forth, Chick stood still for one 1110-
22	NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

liient and looked at the form of his par-
tially stunned adversary.

  Suddenly Boston Sam’s heavy should-
ers began to move.

   Chick gave a step forward with revol-
ver clubbed, when a noise at the door at-
tracted his attention.

   He turned liis head and-on the instant
Flat-Nosed Batson entered the room.

   With one bound, and regardless of the
weapon that confronted him, he was at
Chick’s side.

  Dodging the blow aimed at his head,
he raised his right hand which had been
elosed since his entrance, and threw some
powdery substance in the gallant young
detective’s face.

   It was red pepper, and partially filling
Chick’s eyes, nearly blinded him, at the
same time causing him the most excruci-
ating pain.

  Rut he did not meekly fold his hands
and give up the ship, though his situa-
tion was a most desperate one.

   With a yell like that of a wild beast he
sprang upon Batson, beat him to the
floor, stamped on him, then turned as he
saw Boston Sam coming-, and assailed
that fighting expert with the ferocity of
a demon.

   Chick’s blood was up.

  He could scarcely see, and he was
suffering agonies from his injured eyes,
and yet he felt possessed of the strength
of a dozen men.

  Boston Sam had his knife out—a huge
Chinese cleaver—but Chick caTed no
more for the weapon than if it had been
a toothpick.

  His onslaught was so furious that the
villain could do no more than give Chick
a slight prick in the arm.

  The smarting sensation caused by the
puncture of the flesh gave zest to the de-
tective’s ferocity.

  He pummeled Boston Sam until the ex-
slugger sank unconscious to the floor with

features indistinguishable by reason of
blood and bruised flesh.

  Flat-Nosed Batson had not moved since
Chick had laid him out.

  “There,” groaned the brave fellow, as
he groped his way to the door, »I think
they’re fixed for a few moments, long
enough for me to get down stairs to the
wash-room. ”

  He reached the door, opened it, and
passed into the corridor.

  He felt about the lock after he had
closed the door, found the key, turned it,
and then taking the key out put it in liis
pocket.

  At the top of the stairs he hesitated a
moment, for it seemed to be darker than
usual in that locality.

  Had his eyesight grown dimmer, or had
the hall been darkened since his entrance
into the house?

  But he had no time for speculation.

  He must do something at once to re-
lieve his eyes.

  With his hand on the balustrade, lie
prepared to descend the stairs.

  He took one step, and nothing hap-
pened.

  Two steps, and--

  His feet encountered space.

  A cry of terror involuntarily burst from
his lips as he went down, to strike with
a cruel crash among a heap of broken
boxes, old bottles, and dishes, and to feel
his senses leaving him.

  As he lay there under the stairway
without sense or motion Boston Sam
came noiselessly out of the room above,
and stopping at the head of the stairs
listened intently for a moment.

  Satisfied that the detective had fallen
into the trap set for his benefit in the
event of his escaping from the clutches
of his foes in the room, the ex-slugger
went back for his comrade in crime.

  But Flat-Nosed Batson was too sick to
move.

  He was a very sick man, indeed.
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.	23

 After trying in vain to arouse him Bos-
 ton Sam made up his mind to descend to

 his victim alone.

 He found Chick still insensible, and
 dragged his body from under the stair-
 way to a small room in the basement.

 After securing his ankles and wrists
 with stout cords he locked him in and
 departed.

 The room had 110 window, and was a
 veritable dark hole.

 An hour passed away before Chick
 came to his senses.

 His eyes no longer pained him, but
 because he could not penetrate the black
 darkness of the apartment he thought he
 had gone bli nd.

 But he gave no serious thought to his
 own situation.

 One subject alone engrossed his mind,
 and as a dire possibility presented itself,
 the cold perspiration started to his fore-
 head.

 “If Nick should fail, if he should be
 opposed by the whole force of the enemy
 and overcome or killed, a terrible thing
 might happen to Miss Astorel, for it is
 not her money alone that the villain Dell-
 nian seeks. ’ ’

 Gloomy, indeed, were the brave voting
 detective’s thoughts as the hours went
 by in that dark and stifling house, and no
 relief came.

CHAPTER VII.

IKVIRONED BY PERILS.

 Luck had favored Albert Dellman in
 his villainous crusade.

 After he had parted with the false Bos-
 ton Sam on the night of the Leidesdorff
 stieet adventure he had gone to his room
 ail(1 Put cm his thinking cap.

 Matters during the evening had pro-
 ceeded so smoothly that he began to sns-
 Pcct that there might be a screw loose

 somewhere.

 Heretofore his operations had been con-

 ducted with such skill and shrewdness
 that the possibility of detection and con-
 sequent punishment had been thoroughly
 guarded against.

  In fact, so well had he carried on his
game of robbery that he had had the un-
blushing effrontery to tell Marcus Astore'i
to his face on the street that he, Dellman,
was the man who had planned all the
abductions and had profited by them.

  “The cowardly miser,” said the vil-
lain to himself, as his mind reverted to his
bad performances of tlie past, “was afraid
to put his case in the hands of the local
detectives, for fear that I might tumble
to the game and come down on him for
it worse than ever. So he had to go to
New York and dig up this man, Carter.
A smart detective, none smarter in the
United States, but I’ve been a match for
him, all the same,” he chuckled, “and,
what’s more, old Astorel can’t put up any
trick to catch me that I won’t be able to
get away with. ”

  Then as he thought of what had slipped
from his grasp by the sudden departure of
the broker, his hands clinched in murder-
ous anger, and he cursed the day that saw
Nick Carter enter into the fight against
him.

  After a weight}' consideration of the
situation, he determined to have another
interview with Flat-Nosed Batson before
he went to bed.

  Perhaps that worthy might either ease
his mind or prove that he had really
been duped.

  When he reached the city prison a pa-
trolman, who was temporarily in charge
of the office, had just left his post to at-
tend to the agonizing call of one of the
female prisoners.

  Dellman stood by the railing so that he
could look upon the desk.

  An open note, probably but recently
taken from the envelope which lay be-
side it, gave him a serious start, for he
read the name at the bottom of it.
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

  The name was “Nick Carter.”

   Watching his chance while the officer’s
back was turned, he snatched up the note
and hastily read it.

   It was short and to the point.

  “On no account must you permit any
one from the outside, no matter if lie
were the governor himself, to see or talk
with Batson until I call or send a written
order.1 ’

  Dellman, after reading the note,
glanced quickly down the passage, and
to his unbounded relief saw that the offi-
cer was in the act of entering the cell
where the woman who had called to him
was confined.

  Realizing that moments were golden
he whipped out his pocketbook, found a
blank leaf, and with a pencil quickly cop-
ied the great detective’s signature.

  An expert at forgery, he made every
stroke of his pencil tell.

  His work done, he put the book in his
pocket, replaced the note 011 the desk,
and walked noiselessly out.

  As he was passing by the quarters set
apart for the newspaper reporters a
thought struck him, and he glanced in.

   No one was there.

  Dellman, without -a moment’s pause,
walked into the room, which was lighted
up, and sat down at a table, provided
w:th writing materials.

  He took out the pocketbook, tore out
the leaf with the imitation of Nick Car-
ter’s signature, and placed it before him
on the table.

   Then he found a half sheet of foolscap,
and soon produced the following letter:

   “It is necessary for the success of an
important movement against an Eastern
crook, lately arrived litre, that James
Batson should be released, temporarily,
from confinement. I am unable to come
to the prison in person. Mr. Dellman,
my friend, and with whom you are ac-
quainted, is empowered to take charge of

Batson upon his release. Let Flat-Nose
out 011 receipt of this, and oblige

                “Your friend,

                     “Nick Carter.”

   This he handed to the officer in charge
of the prison.

   Having read the false order the officer,
as a careful man, compared the signature
with that of the note he had received ear-
lier in the evening.

  They were apparently identical.

   “All right, Mr. Dellman,” he said, and
five .minutes later Flat-Nosed Batson and
his employer were outside and 011 their
way to an underground oyster saloon.

   Up to this time, though suspicious that
some of his plans had either miscarried
or were in danger of miscarrying, Dcll-
mau’s mind had not dwelt on the possi-
bility that Nick Carter might be alive.

  It was reserved for Boston Sam, who
joined the party soon after they came into
the eating house, to open the arch-vil-
lain’s eyes to the truth, and to show him
the awful precipice upon which he was
standing.

  Nick Carter alive meant his downfall,
for the forgery would be detected before
another day ended.

  If luck would, but favor him in just
one instance he might win his wicked
battle after all.

  If Nick Carter would only go to Oak-
land in the morning without calling at
the city prison and discovering the decep-
tion that had secured the release of Bat-
son, all would be well.

  It was extremely probable that the
great detective would take an early boat
for Oakland in order to attend to his busi-
ness with the Astorels, and it was not
likely that he would call at the city pii-
son before starting.

   So Dellman reasoned, and as the sequel
has shown he reasoned well.

  But to make sure, he was up before
daybreak next morning, and while Bos-
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.	26

ton Sam watched the city prison en-
trance, lie piped off the ferryboats.

 Arrangements for the clay’s programme
 had been made with his two hirelings

 the night before.

 He was therefore prepared to leave the
 city when lie saw Nick Carter in the
 guise of a hook canvasser step up to the
 ferryboat office and purchase his ticket.

 Dellman's power of penetration was
 phenomenal.

 It was well night impossible to deceive
 him when his senses were alert, and he
 was on a keen lookout for points. * -

 He knew Nick Carter the moment he
 saw liis face, and noted the peculiar poise
 of his finely shaped head, and thus know-
 ing lie set out to shadow him.

 Nick, as the reader knows, on arriving
 in Oakland went immediately to the Vane
 residence on Broadway.

 Dellman, in disguise, saw him enter
 the house, and rightly inferred that Miss
 Serena Dare would be subjected to a
 searching oral examination.

 When Nick came out he was shadowed
 to the lodging-house, where he became
 metamorphosed into Col. Bently Hender-
 son, of Missouri.

 The arch-villain saw his quarry enter
 the court-house, and then grinned like a
 fiend.

 He would have the shrewd detective

 where lie wanted him before he left Oak-
 land.

 It was with malevolent joy that Dell-
 man played Chick against Nick, and saw
 them enter a livery stable for the purpose
 of hiring a rig for the Martinez hills.

 Before they started however, the arch-
 villai 11 had gone on horseback to the hills

 ln advance.

 He stopped a few minutes at Temescal,
 where he had staked Boston Sam and Bat-
 son, gave them some further instructions,
 ar>d then rode on.

 He was up on the first rise in the range

when Nick Carter driving alone began the
ascent.

  The great detective had changed his
plan of procedure after parting with
Chick.

  In view of the momentous interests at
stake it would be the height of rashness
to risk an abduction while his faithful
ally was absent and engaged upon an un-
dertaking that might have a disastrous
result.

  Therefore, instead of permitting him-
self to be abducted, according to the orig-
inal programme, he intended to close in
on Dellman and bring him back to Oak-
land a prisoner.

  The attempt at murder in the Leides-
dorf street basement could easily be prov-
en against the villain, and once in San
Quentin, with a heavy sentence over him,
his persecution of the Astorel family
would cease.

  Nick felt sure that he would meet Dell-
man in the hills from the fact that Bos-
ton Sam had been left behind at Temes-
cal.

  In anticipation of an ambush the detec-
tive kept a wary lookout.

  He had nearly readied the summit
when he saw a man sitting on a small
culvert where the road made a bend.

  It was Albert Dellman.

  Nick drove up slowly, fearing 110 im-
mediate trouble, because he still enter-
tained the opinion that the villain knew
him only in his assumed character of the
Missouri colonel. -

  But when he came close enough to
catch Dellman’s eye he knew by its pecu-
liar glitter that his identity was known.

  And with this knowledge came the
startling suggestion that his death and
not his abduction was desired.

  But he must keep up his role of colonel
for the present, and not let the villain
suspect' lie was aware that his identity
had been discovered.
NICK CAIiTER WEEKLY.

  The horses were reined tip at a sign
from Dellman.

  “Why,” he exclaimed, in assumed as-
tonishment, as he looked into the phae-
ton, “I expected my partner. Why didn’t
he come ?’ ’

  “He had business in Teineseal which
detained him. But he will come out in an
hour or so. ’ ’

  Nick spoke in a matter-of-fact way,
though he could hardly keep a straight
face.

  A farce was being played by two excel-
lent comedians.

  But it might presently develop into a
tragedy.

  “The brick, Col. Henderson,” said
Dellman, respectfully, “is in yonder
cabin.”

  He pointed to a small wooden shanty
a few rods from the road at the openiing
of a small ravine.

  “Bring it here. I’ll wait for you.”
  “But it’s buried.”

  “Can’t you dig it up?”

  “Yes, but it is very heavy, and if I
brought it out here some one might come
along the road and notice it. ”

  “What of it? It’s yours, isn’t it?”
“Certainly it is mine, but I bought it
from a man who had stolen it from a
m iner. ’ ’

  “Ah !”

“But if you buy it—say at half price—
you can have it cut up, and dispose of it
in sections without running any risks.”
“I want to see the brick first. It may
be bogus for aught I know. ”

  “It is my desire that you should see it.
Hitch your team to a tree, and come to
the cabin with me. It is unoccupied.”
“I am a stranger, and you may not be
an honest man,” said Nick, bluntly.
“How do I knew that you do not intend
to rob me if you can?”

  “I will prove to you that I am acting
squarely, ” Dellman asserted, with feigned
earnestness and sincerty. “Here now. I’ll

lay my revolver and knife down here on
this rock,” indicating a flat bowlder by
the roadside. “You do the same with
your weapons, and we’ll enter the cabin
unarmed. ’ ’

  “That’s agreeable,” said Nick who
felt able physically to handle a quartette
of Dellinans.

  The arcli-villain, when the team had
been secured, walked toward the cabin,
Nick following.

  There was one small window on the
side.

  It was placed high up, and standing
011 tipfoe Dellman peered into the small
room, and then motioned to the disguised
detective to do the same.

 Nick, with one eye on the man of
crime, used the other to take in the de-
tails of the apartment.

  It was unfurnished save for a loug shal-
low box in one corner.

  “The brick is buried under that box,”
said Dellman. “Come, let’s go in.”

  Nick, not without some misgivings, fol-
lowed the villain into the room.

  But the moment the detective had taken
a step across the threshold Dellman gave
him a quick, powerful shove forward, and
the next instaut sprang out of the door,
and closed it.

  But the door was made of common red-
wood boards, and the detective felt 110
alarm, for he knew he could kick it down
before his enemy could return to the spot
with the revolvers.

  He had made a step toward the door
with the purpose of demolishing it, when
a peculiar hissing sound, which was
quickly succeeded by a dry, suggestive
rattle, rattle, rattle, made him start vio-
lently and then nervously turn to face the
terrible danger that now unexpectedly
menaced him.

  What he saw drove the blood from his
face.

  He was a brave man, but the sight he
beheld was one calculated to appall the
stoutest heart.

  From out the box in the corner there
had crawled five large rattlesnakes.

  Of the most active and venomous kind
—the deadly diamond back—they were
moving swiftly toward the man who had
been caged in the shanty, in order that
NICK CABTEli WEEKLY.

lie might fall a victim to their poisonous

fangs.

  It would be courting death to try to es-
cape by the door, for before he could hope
to smash it in the reptiles would he upon
him As for the window, there was no
way of reaching it in time to break
through and escape.

 And yet lie must do something;; he
must not stand still and accept the fear-
ful fate which that villain of villains,
Dellman, had meted out to him.

 One moment more—all the thoughts
that had ] issed through his brain had not
occupied more than a few seconds—and
the rattlers would be upon him.

 One—the largest—had coiled close to
his feet, and Nick’s fear-dilated eyes
seemed to pierce the veil which shrouded
the future and to see himself a swollen,
putrid cropse, and—when suddenly the
thought came to him like inspiration,
that all was not yet lost.

  He had been a traveler in India, where
the deadly cobra luxuriates, and he had
been the companion and confidant of some
of the noted fakirs and snake charmers of
the Hindoo land.

 He could now make practical use of
the curious knowledge he had gained from
them.

 A low, sibilant whistle, made with
closed teeth, arrested the motion of every
rattler in the room.

 flic one nearest, who was about to
strike drew back its head, slowly uncoiled
itself, and slunk quietly to the cover of
the box.

 The others followed until not a snake
could be seen.

Still the low hissing sound was kept up
until the detective had reached the door.

 He had his foot raised to break it
down, when the thought of Dellman
made him patise.

. The villain must suppose that his fiend-
ish scheme had succeeded.

 therefore he lowered his foot and lis-
tened with all his ears for any sounds of
the enemy’s return..

Soon a crackling of dry twigs outside

announced that some one was approach-
ing.

 Nick began to groan faintly as the
steps came nearer the door.

I he key turned, the door was thrown

open, and then the detective made a rush
and caught the oncomer by the throat.

  One swift glance told him that the man
was not Dellman.

  He was tall, angular, hook-nosed, and
was dressed like a hunter.

  But he had muscles like steel, and was
as active as a cat, as the great detective
soon discovered.

 The moment Nick’s fingers clutched
his throat, the man threw his long arms
around his assailant’s body, and gave him
a hug like that of a grizzly bear.

 Though expecting every moment that
his'ribs would crack under the terrible
pressure to which tl.ey were being sub-
jected, Nick . gripped his opponent
about the windpipe with desperate force.

  His own breath was leaving him, and
it did not seem possible for him to come
out victorious in the struggle.

 But at the moment when his fingers
were ready to relax, Nick’s unknown ad-
versary dropped his hands.

  This action was followed by a tighter,
more fearful pressure of the throat, for
with the stoppage of the hook-nosed man’s
efforts, Nick’s lungs expanded, and new
strength was infused into his muscles.

  Not even a second Samson could long
withstand the choking that the detec-
tive’s foe was receiving.

  His face became mottled, his eyes pro-
truded, until it seemed as if they would
burst from their sockets, and his tongue
lolled out like that of a dog heated from
fierce exertion.

  At last his knees began to give wav,
and he became as limp as a rag.

  At this stage, of the proceedings, Nick
suddenly withdrew his fingers from about
the man’s throat, and giving him a pow-
erful shove made him measure his length
on the ground.

  As he lay there, and while the detec-
tive was searching his person for weap-
ons, there came that sharp suggestive rat-
tle, which Nick had heard with a shud-
der of dread but a short time before.

  As he sprang to his feet, the rattler
struck.

  But the fangs werenever meant to work
harm to the great detective.

  They had sought a nearer, better defined
mark, the neck of the prostrate, uncon-
scious man.

NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

  Too late to arrest the dread catastro-
phe, Nick could only seize the reptile by
the tail, and beat its bead into a jelly
against the corner of the cabin.

  A look about him, when he had fin-
ished this savagely pleasurable operation,
showed him that the other rattlers—four
in number—had taken advantage of the
open door to escape from the cabin, and
that they •were now making off rapidly
for cover among the rocks and brush a
few rods away.

  A glance at the rattlesnake’s victim
showed that human aid would be useless.

  Struck in one of the most vulnerable
portions of the body, full in the jugular
vein, already the dark shadow of death
had overspread the man’s face.

  With a grave countenance, Nick
dragged the body into the cabin, and
closed and locked the door.

  He was deeply shocked and grieved at
the occurrence.

  But his grief would have been tem-
pered somewhat had lie known then,
what he afterward discovered, that the
dead man was an ex-convict, a notorious
law-breaker, had been concerned in more
than one murder, and that as Albert Dell-
man’s tool he had assisted in the abduc-
tion of the various members of the Asto-
tel family.

  In anticipation of the return of the
arch-villain, Nick concealed himself in a
clump of chemisal near the cabin and
waited.

  He was no longer unarmed, for upon
the person of the rattlesnake’s victim he
had found two revolvers and a large liunt-
ing-knife.

  Ten minutes elapsed and Dellman ap-
peared in sight. In his right hand'was a
cocked revolver.

  When within about ten paces of the
cabin door, he stopped and listened for
some sound from within.

  A faint moaning noise greeted his ears
as he bent his head forward.

  Satisfied that his foul scheme had suc-
ceeded, Dellman walked rapidly up to
the door.

  He was about to turn the key when
prudence suggested that lie first take a
look in at the window.

  As he stood on tiptoe peering in
through one of the panes, hj,s back was

toward Nick, who was not more than
ten feet away.

  Now was the great detective’s oppor-
tunity.

  With the quickness of a panther he
leaped forward and struck Deliman a
powerful blow behind the ear.

  The villain went down with such force
that his bead struck the ground with a
resounding thud, while his pistol went
flying out of his hand, and exploded in
the brush.

  Before he recovered his senses Xick
was astride of his body, and busily em-
ployed in securing his wrists and ankles
with cords which he had provided him-
self with before starting on his journey.

  “There.” he said to himself, as he pre-
pared to rise to his feet, liis work finished,
“that job is settled, and it is a good job,
too. ’ ’

  A rustling sound behind him made him
turn with a start, but too late to save
himself.

  He had time only to see the evil face
of Boston Sam, and then a heavy club
descended 011 his head and consciousness
left him.

CHAPTER VIII.

NICK COMES OUT AHEAD.

  It was close upon sundown when Nick
Carter opened his eyes and realized his
cond ition.

  He was lying in the cabin, bound hand
and foot, and within a few feet of the
body of the man who had died from the
bite of the rattlesnake.

  His enemies had departed—perhaps
gone to Oakland, or—he shivered, and
grew pale at the thought—they had gone
down the canyon to find more snakes to re-
place the ones which had escaped.

  He did not try to account for the pre-
sence of the poisonous reptiles in the
cabin when he had first entered it, for
his thoughts were directed into sterner
grooves.

  The dead man could have furnished the
explanation, for the snakes had been his
property, and had been captured for ship-
ment to the Smithsonian Institute.

  Nick’s head ached from the terrible
blow he. had received, and when his
mind reverted to his unaccomplished
work, the pain was intensified.
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

 It became mental as well as physical.

 The pre.v-.-nee of Boston Sam in the
 hills—\vh<> . i. ji id have been safe in the
 care of Chirk hud matters gone right—
 meant that s> •me* accident had happened
 to his faithful assistant.

 Perhaps Chirk had been taken by sur-
 prise, as he. Nick, had been, and was
 even now a prisoner, or worse still, dead
 in Temescal !

 The thought of such a dire misfortune
 was an agonizing one to the great detec-
 tive, for he believed if neither he nor
 Chick appeared in Oakland the next day,
 that some vile plot against Miss Astorel
 woulfl be successfully carried out.

 The great detective shut his eyes and
 groaned.

 At the same moment, in Teniescal,

 Chick, a prisoner also, was following his

 chief’s example.

 Could it be possible, thought Nick,
 that the cause of the wicked would be
 allowed to triumph.

 Had his luck at last deserted him ?

 He would not believe it, and he tugged
 and strained at his bonds until the blood
 streamed from the torn flesh, but to no
 purpose.

 The cords had been put on to stay.

 He rolled over and over on the floor in
 the nervousness of acute despair.

 Suddenly lie found himself in front of
 the box which had been the nest of the
 rattlesnakes, and gazing at it as if fasci-
 nated.

 Soon he began to tremble, not from
 fear, but from the suggestion of a blissful

  possibility.

 The box had a sheet-iron band, and
 this band had been broken neat tlie bot-
 tom, at one corner, leaving it jagged and
 sticking out.

 Nick propelled himself by means of his
 knees and elbows until he reached the
 box.

29

   He was moving toward the door,
 when he heard the key softly turn in the
 lock.

   The enemy had returned.

   Nick was unarmed, but he minded not
 this disadvantage.

    In his present state of mind he felt able
 to cope with an army.

   But though the door was unlocked no
 one entered.

   Nick wondered greatly at this circum-
 stance.

    And all was so silent without.

   What could it mean?

    While he stood still, debating what he
 should do, a woman’s shriek burst upon
 his ears.

    It was succeeded by a man’s brutal im-
 precation.

   As Nick threw the door open and
 rushed out the shriek was repeated.

   It came from the lips of a lovely
 woman not ten yards away.

   It was Hester Astorel, and she was
 struggling in the arms of Boston Sam.

   Nick was at the scene in two bounds,
 and it was not one blow that he gave the
 ex-slugger, but two, three, four—upon
 head, face, and neck.

   The assault resulted in a complete
 knockout.

   Boston Sam sought mother earth with
 a sprawd that was far from elegant, while
 Hester sobbed her thanks on the great de-
 tective’s manly shoulder.

 Another instant, and with the jagged

CHAPTER JX-

VICTORY FOR THE RIGHT.

 Boston Sam was handcuffed and lashed
 to a tree pending arrangements for his
 removal to the Oakland jail.

 He was thoroughly cowed, and now
 knew that the game was up as far as he
 was concerned.

 He told Nick that he had left Chick at
 Teniescal in charge of Flat-Nosed Batson,

sheet-iron band he was sawing away at the who though not strong enough to travel,

 cords about his wrists.

 Five minutes sufficed to do the work
 and place him on his feet a free man once
 more.

 Free! No, not entirely free, if action
 Were to be considered.

 He would not be free until he had
 passed the door and reached the open air.

 had yet enough physical ability and men-
 tal gumption left in him to guard a bound
 prisoner.

 Dellman, he said, had started for Oak-
 land immediately after Nick had been
 overcome and placed in the cabin.

 “How did he go? With the team, or
 on horseback, as he came?”
30

NICK CARTER WE KLY.

  “On horseback.”

  “And the livery rig—where is it?”

  “Back in the road, where you hitched
it. ”

  “Good,” said Nick, anc] with restored
confidence he fairly beamed on the pale-
faced young lady at his side.

  “I saw Mr. Dellman in Oakland before
I came out,” she said, “and I also over-
heard a conversation he had with Serena
Dare, Mrs. Vane’s maid-of-all-work. ”

  The detective showed the greatest in-
terest at this statement.

  “He came to Mrs. Vane’s, thinking I
was out, ” she went on. “I did go out to
make some purchases, but after traver-
sing a few blocks found that I had forgot-
ten my purse.

  “As I was returning to get it I saw Mr.
Dellman enter the front gate.

  “Suspecting that no good was meant
by this call, I waited until the maid had
admitted him, and then secretly entered
the house by the back way.

  “Serena showed him into the parlor,
and as my mother and my aunt had gone
out to a neighbor’s, the two, thinking
they were alone in the house, spoke in
ordinary tones, so that I could easily hear
everything that was said from my station
in the hall.

  “The maid told him of your visit early
in the morning, and of other matters
which it is not necessary now to speak of,
and in return he informed her of what
occurred in the hills and at Temescal.

  “When the villain announced that
your fate was sealed, and that the man-
ner of death had been left with Boston
Sam, I waited to hear 110 more, but hur-
riedly left the house, procured a saddle
horse at a livery stable, and galloped
swiftly to your assistance.”

  “Why didn’t you bring an officer with
you ?’ ’ asked Nick, as he gazed at her with
respectful adm^ation.

  “I went to the police office, but all the
officers were out. I did not even tell the
captain what was wanted, I was so greatly
excited. Minutes were precious to my
mind, for at any moment this Boston
Sam might take a notion to carry out his
fiendish employer’s order.”

  “It was well that you acted so promnt-
ly, ” Nick feelingly said, “for Boston

Sam was at the door of the cabin when
you came in sight of it.”

  “I know, and when I saw him I ran
forward with all my might.”

  “Were you armed?”

  “1 had this,” said Hester, with a slight
blush.

  She held out a pair of scissors.

  Nick could not repress a smile.

  “I could find nothing else, except a
carving knife, and that was too large and
clumsy. ”

  “You needed no weapon,” spoke the
detective, earnestly, “for your presence
alone was sufficient to save my life. I
shall never forget your courageous and
self-sacrificing action.”

  Again the young lady blushed, but this
time from pleasure, not shame.

  Tliev reached Temescal with Boston
Sam just after dark.

  Nick did not anticipate any trouble
with Flat-Nosed Batson.

  He expected to find the fellow half
drunk and so stiff and sore besides from
his bruises that he would not be likely
to make much of a resistance.

  And so it proved.

  Batson was found squatted in the front
of tlie room in the basement that held
Chick a prisoner, with a bottle of whisky
in his lap, and his head nodding drowsily.

  Nick gave him a cuff that sent him
sprawling on his back.

  It did not take long to reduce him to
utter subjection.

  Entering the room quickly the great
detective found Chick suffering more from
sore eyes than from the inconvenience of
his bonds.

  An hour later Chick was in Oakland
receiving medical treatment.

  He was well enough to accompany
Nick on .a certain expedition at mid-
night.

  It was determined that the arrest of
Albert Dellman should take place at once.

  He had made an appointment to call at
Mrs. Vane’s 011 the evening of the next
day, but it would not be policy to wait
until then before closing in on him.

  Boston Sam and Flat-Nosed Batson
were already in jail, and the former had
made a full confession, which had been
legally taken down and attested before a
notary public.
NICK CARTER WEEKLY.	31

  Acting upon information furnished by
the ex-slugger. Nick and Chick went to
a saloon on one of the main streets where
gambling was surreptitiously carried on
in a back room every night.

  Given the “open sesame” by Boston
Sam, the two detectives had no difficulty
in obtaining an entrance.

  The back room door was wide open,
and the players at the long oval table—
the game was faro—were in full view from
the bar-room.

  Albert Dellman sat facing the door,
but his eyes were glued upon a stack of
chips staked upon a card in front of him.

  Nick and Chick got out of liis line of
vision, and calling the bar-keeper aside
had a few earnest words with him.

  He was not a bad sort of fellow, and
kept what was known as a “respectable
joint.”

  No thugs, hoodlums, or tin-horn play-
ers were allowed to participate in the
games.

  When Dell man’s real character was
made known to him he promised bis
hearty co-operation in the detective’s
scheme to place him under arrest.

  As he sauntered into the card-room
Nick and Chick placed themselves just
out of sight, on opposite sides of the
doorway.

  The barkeeper -waited until the deal in
hand had been consummated and the bets
settled, and then he spoke thus to Dell-
man :

  “A gentleman of the name of Batson
wants to see you outside.”

  The arch-villain started and turned
pale.

  If Batson wanted him, then something
must have gone wrong.

  Perhaps Chick had escaped from Temes-
cal, and was even now in Oakland on his
trail.

  The bare possibility of a miscarriage of
his evil plans gave him the cold shivers.

  He rose quickly from the table, took
something from his vest-pocket, and held
it tightly in his hand as he walked to-
ward the door.

  Utterly unconscious of the nearness of
the danger, he stepped confidently across
the threshold, when--

  “I want you,” came with stern impres-

siveness from the lips of Nick Carter,
who at the same moment seized his quar-
ry by an arm.

  Chick, on the other side, grasped the
other arm.

   It was all done in an instant.

  Albert Dellman, in the grasp of two
powerful and determined men, knew it
would be a waste of time and energy to
struggle.

  He submitted to the handcuffing pro-
cess without making a single movement
in resistance.

  But when his white wrists had been or-
namented with Nick’s steel bracelets he
opened his mouth to speak.

  “You’ve got your points down fine on
me, Isuppose?” he said, sueeringly, to
Nick.

  The detective nodded his head.

  “Have you any objection to telling me
what the case against me is?”

  “None in the world.”

  And then Nick told him everything.
Dellman’s face was very grave at the
conclusion. “I ought to have kept in the
background,” he muttered.

  “As you did in /the abduction eases,
eh?-”

  “Yes. Batson and Sam worked those
snaps for me. ”

  They were about leaving the saloon
when Dellman complained of faintness,
and asked to be allowed to sit down for
a few moments.

  Nick saw no reason why the request
might not safely be complied with.

  But the moment Dellman sat down lie
raised his hands toward his face.

  The hand which had been closed since
his departure from the card-room now
opened quickly, and a small pellet was as
quickly transferred to his mouth.

  “Too late,” be cried out, in savage
triumph, “for I’ll be a dead man in twen-
ty seconds.”

  Nick hastily called for mustard and
salt, but before the barkeeper could fur-
nish the articles Albert Dellman had
ceased to breathe.

  The papers next morning had the big-
gest sensation of the year.

  The names of Nick Carter and his now
famous assistant were in everybody’s
mouth.

  A public ovation would have been
