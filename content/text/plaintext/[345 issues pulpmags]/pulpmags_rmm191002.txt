NAPOLEON a captive, Oil board the English ship Bellerophon, gazing out across the solemn sea
toward France, where he was once Emperor, realizing that his dream of Universal Empire is
at an end, yet unconscious that he is soon to be banished like an outcast a thousand miles
from shore to the lonely and barren rocks of St Helena, is one of the most profoundly touching
and tragic scenes in history This picture from Ridpatli’s History illustrates but one event out
of all the thousands which are fully described and illustrated in the world-famed publication

The Headlight of Genius

BY C F CARTER

                       I

RAILROAD history is not a dry affair of dates and names and dust-
covered happenings long since dead It is living, personal, real, and
most of it is recent Of course, the great events of railroad history
are fairly clear in the minds of most of us If they aren't, we can easily find
out what we want to know For example:

    When was the first railroad charter granted

    When was the first transcontinental road completed 

    Who invented the air-brake, and when

    The answers to these questions are at the command of nearly every one

     But what of the lesser things, that are still as full of human interest

    When was the first bell-cord used, and what is the story that hangs
from it

     Who was the first conductor to let a minister travel half fare, and why

     The answers to these and other similar questions are amusing

the Ministerial Half-Fare Ticket—Coming of the Ticket-
Punch, and Other Wonders

versal use for communication between
train and engine That humble cord
plays an important part in train opera-
tion It is absolutely necessary that the
conductor should have some means of
signaling, the engineer always within
reach

In early days, before there were auto-
matic air-brakes, the bell-cord was very
much more important even than it is
now In Europe, where passengers are
shut in little compartments where they
are unable to communicate directly with

 1 R R	1

AILROAD builders of the early
days were too impatient to
reap the benefits of a good
idea to wait for that idea
to take coherent form be-
fore they put it into oper-
ation Consequently, many trifling de-
tails of construction and operation had
to be evolved from the inner conscious-
ness of the men who were confronted
with the need of them

Take the bell-cord, for instance, the
forerunner of the air-signal now in uni-

trainmen, or even with other passengers,
the presence of the bell-cord has put an
end to the robberies, assaults, and mur-
ders to which passengers were formerly
liable

  The bell-cord was introduced by Con-
ductor Henry Ayers on the Erie Rail-
road, which, being the world’s first trunk
line, for that reason had to solve an un-
due proportion of the practical problems
of railroad building and operation

  In the spring of 1842, a few months
after the opening of the line to Goshen,
forty-six miles from the Hudson River,
there were no cabs on the engines, no
cabooses for the trainmen, no way of get-
ting over the cars, and no means of com-
munication between the train and the en-
gine

“ Poppy ” Invents the Bell-Cord

  There were no such things as train-,
orders, for the telegraph had not come
into use, nor even printed time - cards
The engineer ran the train to suit him-
self, the conductor being merely a col-
lector of fares

  Conductor Ayers, under the sobriquet
of “ Poppy,” later became one of the
most widely known and popular conduc-
tors in the history of railroading He
was witty and good-natured, and pos-
sessed in a remarkable degree the faculty
of getting 011 pleasantly with every one
with whom he came in contact

  Also, he possessed a waist - line that
could be inveigled through the narrow'
car-doors only by the exercise of a good
deal of finesse Poppy was permitted to
ride behind Engineer Jacob Hamel, a
German, and the first engineer employed
on the road Hamel had always looked
upon the genial Poppy with dark suspi-
cion

  When the latter suggested that there
should be some way for him to commu-
nicate with the engine so he could let
Hamel know when to stop to let off a
passenger, or for any other reason, sus-
picion became at once a certainty that the
conductor was seeking to usurp the pre-
rogatives of the engineer Hamel de-
cided to teach the presumptuous one his
place

  One day Poppy had an idea Pro-
curing a stout cord, he ran it from the

rear of the train to the framework of
the cabless engine He tied a stick of
wood on the end of the cord, and told
Hamel that when he jerked the stick up
and down, that he—Hamel—was to stop

  Hamel growled out something inar-
ticulate, and as soon as Poppy’s back
was turned he cut the stick of wood from
the cord and tied the latter to the frame
of the engine Next day the same per-
formance was repeated

  On the third day, Poppy rigged up the
stick of wood at Piermont, the terminus
of the road, and told Hamel that if he
cut the cord again, or ignored his efforts
to signal him, he would thrash him when
he got to Goshen

  When the train reached Goshen the
signal-stick was gone and the end of the
cord was trailing in the dirt Poppy
walked forward to the engine and, with-
out uttering a word, took off coat, vest,
and hat, loosened his ample collar, rolled
up his sleeves, took a reef in his belt,
yanked Hamel off the engine, and sailed
into him

  It was as pretty a set-to as the most
ardent -sport could wish to see Hamel
had all the dogged tenacity of his phleg-
matic race, while Poppy, in spite of his
bulk, was agile as a cat Neither knew
anything about boxing neither had any
idea of yielding

  One represented Prerogative the other
championed Progress For several min-
utes they puffed and mauled each other,
and tore up the earth to the delight of
several bystanders, until Progress tri-
umphed, as she always does

  That memorable victory on that balmy
May morning settled for all time the
question of who should run trains Also,
it introduced an exceedingly important
device Once the idea was hit upon, it
didn’t take long to replace the stick of
wood with a gong, and then the bell-
cord was fully launched upon its useful
career

Sending Umbrellas by Wire

  Poppy Ayers took a good deal of pride
in his invention, and made use of it on
every possible occasion One day, in
1849, when everybody was talking about
the telegraph, one of his passengers,
bound West from New York, was an old
THE HEADLIGHT OF GENIUS

countrywoman who had been to the city
on a visit for the first time in her life

  Soon after leaving Piermont, Poppy
found the old lady in a paroxysm of
tears and,sobs With difficulty he calmed
her sufficiently to learn that, in the ex-
citement of her first journey, she had
left her umbrella on the boat at Pier-
mont It was an umbrella that had been
in the family for
years, and could
never be replaced

  “Never mind,
mother,” said Pop-
py “ I’ll get your
umbrella for you by
telegraph”

  With this com-
forting assurance,

Poppy struck an
attitude, reached for
the bell-cord, wrig-
gled it a few times,
cocked his head as
if listening intent-
ly, wriggled the
cord again, a n d
said:

   “All right, moth-
er  your umbrella
will be here in a
few minutes”

  Then he went
forward to the bag-
gage-car, and came
back bearing the
missing umbrella
aloft triumphantly,
to the unspeakable
amazement of the
old lady

   “ Got it by wire,
madam,” said Pop

py-

   It was a rule that the porters were to
pick up all articles left in the cabins of
the boats by travelers and take them to
the baggage-cars, where they could be
claimed at any stage of their journey by
,the absent-minded ones Poppy knew
just where to look for the umbrella when
he telegraphed for it with the bell-cord

First Clerical Tickets

  To Poppy Ayers is also due the credit
of originating the custom of allowing

ministers of the gospel to travel for half
fare Early in the spring of 1843, Rev
Dr Robert McCartee, pastor of the
Presbyterian church at Goshen, who
made one or two trips to New York every
week, was a passenger on Poppy's train
bound for the city There had been an
exceptionally heavy rain the night be-
fore, and as the frost was just coming
out of the ground,
the track was cov-
ered with mud in
the cuts so deep
that the train was
delayed for hours

 The passen-
gers, as passengers
always have done
since the days of
the ark, uttered
maledictions on the
management for the
delay As the
hours wore on,
while the train
stood still some of
tlie more spirited
ones drew up a set
of resolutions cen-
suring the railroad
company in strong
language for its in-
competence in per-
mitting the delay

  The resolutions
were passed around
for signatures

  When Dr Mc-
Cartee was reached,
he said he would be
most happy to sign
the resolution if
the phraseology
were slightly changed Being asked to
suggest the changes he had in mind, he
wrote the following:

  “ Whereas, the rain has fallen / at a
time ill-suited to our pleasure and con-
venience, and without consulting us
and,

  “Whereas, Jack Frost, who has been
imprisoned in the ground some months,
has become tired of his bondage, and has
determined to break loose, and his head
may already be seen coming out there-
fore, be it

  “ Resolved, Thus and so”

  NEITHER KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT BOXING

  When the good Dr McCartee arose
and read these resolutions in his most
sonorous voice, there was a heart)- laugh,
and nothing more was heard about cen-
suring the management of the road
Poppy Ayers was so delighted over the
incident that he would never accept fare
from Dr McCartee thereafter

Birth of the Ticket-Punch

  Not being selfish, Dr McCartee sug-
gested, after enjoying his free transpor-
tation for a few weeks, that all minis-
ters be allowed to travel upon the same
terms as himself The company agreed,
and for a few weeks no minister paid
any fares to ride on the Erie Then an
order was issued that ministers were to
be charged half fare, and that order es-
tablished a precedent which was and is'
still universally observed

  The ticket-punch, too, was evolved on

the oldest trunk line When the Erie
began to carry passengers, in 1841:, there
were no station-agents Each conduc-
tor, when he started on his run was given
a tin box which contained a supply of
tickets and ten dollars in change Pas-
sengers bound for New York gave up
their tickets on the boats, for the Erie
terminal was at Piermont, twenty-four
miles up the Hudson

After station-agents were appointed,
the tickets for some years were of heavy
cardboard bearing the signature of the
general ticket-agent These were taken
up and returned to be sold over and over
again until they were too much soiled for
further use

 The public discovered a way to beat the
 company on these tickets A passenger
 bound for New York would buy a through
 ticket to the city, which he would show to
 the conductor, according to custom At
 the last station before reaching New
 York, he would get off and buy a
 ticket for the remainder of the trip
 Then he would put his through ticket
 in his pocket and surrender the short-
 distance ticket

On the return journey he would re-
peat the process, buying a ticket to desti-
nation, and then getting off at the last
' stop before reaching his home station
and buying a ticket to be surrendered
Then he would be in possession of tick-
ets for a round trip to New York, which
he could use as often as he chose by mere-
ly paying fare for a few miles at the end
of each trip

   It was a long time before the railroad
 company discovered the fraud Then a
 system of marking the tickets by lead-
 pencil was adopted but pencil-marks are
 easily erased, and the plan didn’t work
 The only mark which could not be tam-
 pered with was one which mutilated the
 ticket, and the necessity for some instru-
 ment that' would do this neatly led to
 the adoption of the ticket-punch

Train-Despatcher Appears

   The movement of trains by telegraph
was developed first on the Erie Railroad
in 1851 At the beginning of that year
the New York and Erie Telegraph Com-
pany’s lines were completed along the
railroad
THE HEADLIGHT OF GENIUS

  D H Conklin, a printer who had
learned to operate after a fashion, was
sent to Goshen by Charles Minot, the
superintendent of the road, to adjust a
battery which would not work Conk-
lin racked his brain over the matter for
two days, but at last he got the battery
straightened out

  Minot was so delighted to find a man
who could do anything at all with the
telegraph that he insisted upon Conklin
taking the position of operator at Pier-
mont He was the first telegraph-oper-
ator regularly employed on salary by a
railroad company

  At first he didn’t know what salary
he was to get In fact, the company was
so slow in adjusting the matter that he
was obliged to borrow money to pay his
living expenses but at last Superintend-
ent Minot decided that thirty dollars a
month would be about right, and Conk-
lin agreed with him

  After the telegraph line was ready for
business, they didn’t know what to do
with it beyond sending an
occasional unimportant
message beginning “ Dear
sir,” and ending with
“ Yours, respectfully” It
was left to Conklin to make
the first practical applica-
tion of the telegraph in
expediting r a j 1 r oa d busi-
ness

  Without the telegraph it
was, of course, not possible
to know what an incoming
train was bringing in the
way of live stock or other-
freight It was, therefore,
the custom to put off loading
the barges and boats by
which freight was trans-
ferred from the end of the
line to New York until after
the last train of the day had
arrived, so -that live stock
and perishable freight might
be moved with the least pos-
sible delay Under this ar-
rangement, the boats did not
get to the- city until late in
the morning

  One day it occurred to
Conklin to ask the operator
at Goshen to find out how

many cattle there were on the east-bound
train, and to telegraph the information
to him Having found out that the train
was on time, and that it was bringing a
certain number of cattle, he told the cap-
tain of the boat to go ahead and load,
leaving room for fifty-four head of cattle

  There was a grand powwow, in which
the captain, the agent, and about every-
body else around the pier took part, to
discuss this strange innovation Al-
though wholly incredulous, the majority
decided to go ahead and try it To the
amazement of every one, the train did ar-
rive on time, and it did have the pre-
cise number of cattle Conklin had pre-
dicted

  The boat was ready to leave as soon
as the cattle were driven aboard The
result was that when Superintendent
Minot reached his office in the morning
and inquired about the boat, he was
greatly astonished to learn that it had
arrived and unloaded hours ahead of
the usual time When he learned how

the feat had been made possible, he was
delighted

   Yet even with this strong hint, it took
 Superintendent Minot nine months to hit
 upon the idea of using the telegraph to
 control the movements of trains At that
 time trains were run simply by the time-
 card Trains going east had the right
 of way over west - bound trains of the
 same class

A Flagman on Foot

   If an east-bound train did not reach
its meeting-point on time, the west-bound
train, according to the rules, had to wait
one hour and then proceed under a flag
until the opposing train was met That
is, a flagman would be sent ahead on
foot, and twenty minutes later the train
would follow, moving about as fast as a
man could walk

   Under this interesting arrangement,
when a train which had the right of way
was several hours late, as often hap-,
pened, the opposing train would have to
flag for thirty or forty miles

On September 22, 1851, Superintend-

•	ent Minot was on Conductor W H
Stewart’s train, west bound They were
to meet the east-bound express at Tur-
ner’s As the east-bound train did not
show up on time, Minot told the oper-
ator to ask Goshen, fourteen miles west,
if it had arrived there On receiving a
negative answer, he wrote the world’s
first telegraphic train-orders, as follows:

   To Operator at Goshen :

   Hold east-bound train till further or-
   ders

Charles Minot, Superintendent

   Then he wrote another order, which
he handed to Conductor Stewart, read-
ing as follows:

   Conductor Stewart, Turner’s:

   Run to Goshen regardless of oppos-
   ing train

Charles Minot, Superintendent

   Conductor Stewart went forward to
Engineer Lewis and showed him the
order Lewis read it carefully twice-,
and handed it back to Stewart

   “ Do you take me for a darned fool ”
 snorted Lewis “ I’ll not run on that
 thing”

This being duly reported to Minot, he

went forward and tried to convince Lewis
that the order was all right Lewis re-
fused to pull out He wasn’t looking
for a chance to cross the Jordan that
morning, so he proposed to abide by the
rules in such cases made and provided

  Finding Lewis obdurate, Minot
climbed on the engine and took charge
of it Lewis jumped off and established
himself in the rear seat of the rear car,
leaving the door open so he could jump
when the crash came

  But nothing happened Minot trun-
dled along at a good clip until he
reached Goshen Finding on inquiry
that the opposing train had not reached
Middletown, he gave orders to hold it
at that point until his arrival, and pro-
ceeded He kept on moving under tele-
graph orders until Port Jervis was
reached, where the east-bound was met

   The account of the superintendent’s
conduct caused s great commotion on the
road The engineers in solemn conclave
agreed that they would not run trains on
any such crazy scheme

   But the revelation of the possibilities
of the telegraph in facilitating train
movements had settled the matter beyond
the possibility of change by all the de-
crees of all the engineers in the world
Superintendent Minot issued an order
that telegraphic orders must be obeyed

Testing Douglas

  But an important improvement re-
mained to be made Charles W Doug-
las, a printer, who had picked up a smat-
tering of telegraphy by stealth at night
in a telegraph-office in the same building
with the printing-office in which he
worked, was given a position as telegraph
operator at Addison, New York

  One day he wrote out a train-order
without consulting the tape In those
days all messages were printed in dots
and dashes on a paper tape The con-
ductor was horrified, and refused to ac-
cept the order until Douglas had spelled
it out from the tape

  He considered Douglas’s conduct so
dangerous that he reported the matter to
Superintendent of Telegraphs L G Til-
lotson, at Elmira Tillotson was as hor-
rified as the conductor had been He
summoned Douglas to Elmira forthwith,
THE HEADLIGHT OF GENIUS

and proceeded to give him a scathing
lecture upon his dangerous departure
from established usage

“ But,” said Douglas, “ if you can read

your own station-call by sound, why

can’t you read a whole

message the same

way ”

( (

can’t”

 “ But you can, and
 I’ll prove it”

   Thereupon Douglas
 proceeded to write
 down a message by
 sound which Tillotson
 verified from the tape

 But he was not con-
 vinced All the rest of
 the afternoon Doug-

	las was put through
 test after test

   He went through
 them all without a
 mistake Even then
 Tillotson was not con-
 vinced He sent Doug-
 las back to his post at
 Addison, and tested
 him again That test
 settled the matter, and
 numbered the days of
 the telegraph-tape

    The first shipment
 of milk by rail ever
 made in the world was
 made in the spring of
 1842, over the Erie
 Railroad to New York
 City As usual with
 all new departures,
 every one knew that-
 it couldn’t be done

 But Thomas Selleck,
 one of tlie two original station-agents on
 the Erie Railroad, thought it could be
 done successfully

    Selleck was appointed agent at Ches-
 ter in September, 1841 He was quick
 to notice the excellent quality of Orange
 County milk, for he had lived in New
 York City, where in those days the only
 milk available was from cows kept in
 stables in the city and fed on clops from
 breweries and distilleries

    He suggested to the farmers that they
 would do well to try shipping milk to

 the city by railroad, but they jeered at
 the idea of sending it such an unheard-of
 distance as fifty miles, subjected to the
 jarring and jolting of the trains Why,
 it would sour and be churned into but-

termilk before it had gone half-way The
idea was-preposterous!

  In those days dairying in Orange and
other interior counties consisted in ma-
king butter throughout the year and pack-,
ing it down to be taken by wagon to
Newburg, where the wagons were load-
ed on barges and taken down the river
to the city there every farmer would
drive to Washington Market and sell his
butter himself

  The second Tuesday in November was
the date of the great butter market The

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE 

farmers called it “ the day of the big
trip” The butter brought from twelve
and one-half to fifteen cents a pound

   Selleck finally decided to try shipping
milk himself He rented a store at 193
Reade Street, New York City, and an-
nounced that he would have fresh Orange
County milk for sale there on a certain
-May morning in 1842 He finally in-
duced four farmers to deliver a total of
two hundred and forty quarts of milk
in old-fashioned blue churns, which he
shipped to his city store He paid them
two cents a quart for the milk, and paid
freight at the rate of twenty cents a hun-
dred pounds

Icing the Milk

  The milk reached the store in good
condition, and sold at four cents a quart,
instead of the established rate of six
cents for swill-milk But there was not
enough to supply the demand Selleck
increased his shipments as fast as he
could, but he could not supply one-half
the demand

  Every morning there would be a line
of men, women, and children a block
long, waiting at the milk depot for the
arrival of the boat The farmers were
glad enough to sell their milk for two
cents a quart, for there was more money
in it at that price than in making butter
to sell at fifteen cents a pound

  When hot weather came, trouble ar-
rived with it The milk soured before it
reached New York The farmers had
been in the habit of delivering the milk
just as it came from the cows without
taking the trouble to cool it Finally,
Jacob Vail, of Goshen, procured a coil
of lead pipe, which he placed in a hogs-
head filled with ice

  He poured his shipment of milk
through the pipe It came out cold, and
arrived in the city in good condition

  Then another inventive genius discov-
ered that all this costly apparatus was
not necessary that the same result could
be obtained by merely setting the pails
of milk in a spring, or even a tub of
cold water, until the animal heat was
driven off

   Then the troubles of the milk business
were transferred from the farmers to
the railroad management, which had to

find a suitable car for transporting milk,
and then to meet the necessity for special
trains to collect it

  The second year of the milk trade by
rail produced a revenue of sixteen thou-
sand dollars for the railroad The third
year, 6,138,840 quarts were shipped by
the Erie, saving the consumers one hun-
dred and twenty thousand dollars by re-
ducing the old price of six cents for
swill-milk to four cents for real milk,
while at the same time the fanners re-
ceived forty-five thousand dollars more
than they would if they had converted
their milk into butter at fifteen cents a
pound

  Milk is now brought to the New York
market from Hornellsville, three hun-
dred and fifty miles away somewhat far-
ther than the fifty miles which the farm-
ers of Orange County once thought an
impossible distance Milk has built five
branch roads in Orange County at a cost
of four million dollars, and has returned
to the county fifty million dollars New
York now consumes 1,878,480 quarts of
milk every day, and every quart of it
comes by rail

Earliest Iron Bridge

  The first iron railroad bridges, three
in number, were built on the Erie Rail-
road in 1S49  but they were all replaced
by wooden bridges, because one of them,
over Westcolang Creek, near Mast Hope,
gave way under a train on July 31, 1849
When a freight and live stock train of
seventeen cars east bound on that date
struck Westcolang Creek bridge, Nat
Hatch, the engineer, heard a loud, crack-
ing sound

  He instantly pulled the throttle open,
with the result that the engine got over
safely but the tender and fifteen cars
went down, carrying with them Brake-
man Adam Tice George Randall, a
drover, and J L Clapp, his helper One
hundred cattle and a number of sheep
and hogs were in the cars Randall and
Tice were alive, but were penned in so
that they could not get out

  While efforts to extricate them were
being made, both were kicked and
crushed to death by a steer which lay
upon them Clapp died soon after being
taken out

hundred and fifty feet deep and nine
hundred feet wide A congress of engi-
neers was assembled to devise a span

  A wooden bridge of fifty-feet spans was
decided upon It required two years of
time and an outlay of $175,000 When it
was opened, on the 9th of August, 1852,
1,600,000 feet of lumber, the product of
three hundred acres of pine forest, had
gone into its structure

  But the science of iron bridge build-
ing was making progress  and when the
great wooden bridge burned in 1875, it
was replaced in forty-seven days with a
modern iron one

  It is a fact pretty generally overlooked
that the first successful fast trip ever
made by a locomotive was made by an
American engineer on an American road

first trip on it Allen was chief engineer
of the South Carolina Railroad, the first
railroad ever built which was designed
from the outset to be operated by loco-
motives He was afterward president
and chief engineer of the Erie Railroad,
engineer of High Bridge, New York, and
the inventor of paper car-wheels

  The story of this first locomotive trip
ever made was related by Mr Allen in an
address at a dinner at Dunkirk, May 15,
1851 celebrating the opening of the Erie:

  “ When was it Where was it And
who awakened its energies and directed
its movements On August 9, 1829, on
the banks of the Lackawaxen, at the
commencement of the railroad connect-
ing the canal of the Delaware and Hud-
son Canal Company with the coal-mines,

This was two months before the famous
trip by Stephenson’s Rocket, which is
generally credited with first honors The
engineer who made this historic trip was
Horatio Allen, who was born at Schenec-
tady, New York, on May 10, 1802

On January 28, 1828, Mr Allen was
sent to England to buy three locomotives
One arrived in New York early in 1829

It was sent to Honesdale, where it was
set up by Mr Allen, who also made the

and he who addresses you was the only
person on the locomotive

  “ The circumstances which led to my
being alone on the engine were these:
The road had been built in summer the
structure was of hemlock the rails were
timbers notched on caps placed far apart
The timber had cracked and warped from
exposure to the sun After about three
hundred feet of straight line, the road
crossed Lackawaxen Creek on a high
trestle about thirty feet above the water
on a curve of three hundred and fifty to
four hundred feet radius

  “ The impression was very general that
this iron monster would break down the
road, or that it would leave the track at
the curve and plunge into the creek My
reply to these apprehensions was that it
was too late to consider the probability
of such an occurrence that there was no
other course but to have a trial of the
strange animal which had been brought
there at great expense, but it was not
necessary that more than one should be
involved in the same fate that I would
like to take the first ride alone, and the
time would come when I should look
back to the incident with great interest

  “ As I placed my hand son the throt-
tle, I was undecided whether to go slow
or with a fair degree of speed but, hold-
ing that the road would prpve safe,and
preferring that, if we did go down, to go

handsomely and without any evidences
of timidity, I started with considerable
velocity, passed the curve over the creek
safely, and was soon out of hearing of
the cheers of the vast assemblage present
At the end of two or three miles I re-
versed and returned without accident to
the place of starting, having made the
first ' locomotive trip on the Western
Hemisphere”

  The first attempt at, train-wrecking
ever made took place in the last week of
November, 1852 A track-walker on a
section near Andover, New York, on the
Erie Railroad, found an obstruction on
the track that had evidently been placed
there with the intention of wrecking the
east-bound express A watch was set

  At 9 pm Friday, November 26, 1852,
a few minutes before the east-bound ex-
press was due, two men appeared on the
track carrying a log chain They went
to a wrecked gravel-car, and, taking from
it a pair of wheels, chained them to a
culvert where they could not be seen until
the train was close upon them

  The two were seized and taken to jail
at Angelica, where they were found to
be George Palmer, a cabinet-maker, aged
twenty-five, and Sam Allen, a black-
smith, aged twenty’One They were tried
and convicted of attempting to wreck a
train, and on February 3, 1853, were sen-
tenced to serve four years each in prison

THE ENGINE’S HYMN

     Written for The Railroad Man’s Magazine”

I LOVE to hear the whistle blow,

    !t sort of lets a person know
    That all is well that the engineer

Is watching to see that the way is clear

There’s something comforting in its
sound,

While on some journey you are
   bound

If you know its language you can
   tell

If there's something wrong or all is
    well

“All aboard!” Toot, toot! the defi-
    ant sound,

Is echoed and echoed for miles
   around

And ever as we speed along,

You catch the spirit of the song
Sometimes at night, when all is still,
I can not close my eye until
I’ve heard the call of the night express,
Thundering on to the Golden West
I can hear it whistle long before
It passes by the station door,

And I listen until the- sound grows
    dim—

And go to sleep to the engine's hymn

            Even the Ghost of His Grandfather Couldn’t
            Swerve Tim Grogan from His Calculations

“ | MM GROGAN,” remarked
raifailft the Old Switchman, filling
his pipe with the yard-
I	master’s tobacco and ab-

 niiilwi ' sently putting the pouch
 into his pocket The yard-
 master snapped his fingers and his com-
 panion eagerly returned the pouch

   “ To think I w’u’d forget such a thri-
 fle! ” said the Old Switchman sadly,
 “ and when I’d rather be srnokin’ soft
 coal than this stuff any day”

   The midnight freight clattered past
 over the crossings, and two other mem-

 bers of the yard crew entered the switch-
 shanty and put down their lanterns

  “ What about Tim Grogan ” demand-
ed the vardmaster sternly

  “ He was the lad for the higher arith-
metic,” answered the Old Switchman
musingly “high enough to go in for
asthronomy Subtractin’ was play to
him, and we used to call him superintind-
int av division—though his only job was
herdin’ cars with a lead-pencil in the
yards at Comeback”

  Removing the pipe, he gazed into the
bowl and lapsed into silence

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  “ Throw in a little more coal,” sug-
gested one of the switchmen from his
perch on the tool-box, and with an ex-
clamation of disgust the yardmaster
hurled his pouch at the Old Switchman,
who all but emptied it into his pipe and
pocket

  “ Though ’tis little use I can make av
it,” he complained, “ I am gettin’ ould
and wind-broken from overwurruk, and
can hardly get a draft through the pipe
—p’rhaps the flue is choked up a little
bit Wance I c’u’d draw like a suction-
pump—”

  The switchman on the tool-box reached
for a wad of oily waste with a look there
was no mistaking, and the ancient nar-
rator suddenly took up his story as if the
thread had remained unbroken from the
very first word:

  “ Whin there was nothin’ else to do,
which was from noon till 7 am, Tim
Grogan w’u’d sit on the station platform
at Comeback, and add up the car num-
bers for the iddication there was in it
Aftherward he w’u’d calculate the date
av your birth, which made him disliked
by the women, or the date av the super in-
tindint’s death, which made him popular
with the men, for he proved it was no
distant day Ivirything he did was the
raysult av careful calculatin’

  “ He knew the exact time it w’u’d take
the flier to come from the bridge to the
station, and w’u’d sthroll across the track
in front av it so close that the suction
w’u’d pull out hairs from his head and
scatter thim like sparks, for Tim’s head
was the color av a prairie-fire, the fric-
tion av figures kapin’ his skull at a red
heat

  “ Kitty Flannery, who was the chief
despatcher at Comeback, with no subor-
dinates, despised him for calculatin’,
though Tim had kept her company for
three years, eight hours, and wan min-
ute The eight hours bein’ the length
av his call the night before while Tim
was calculatin’ sh’u’d he ask her to
marry him, and the wan minute bein’ the
time it tuk Kitty to answer in the nega-
tive

  “ Nixt day Tim sat in the lunch-room
estimatin’ the number av chews it tuk to
reduce a sinker to food, whin Kitty came
in The two av thim nodded with cau-
tion, and afther a bit Tim asked:

    “ 1 Have ye calculated well on what I
 asked ye last night  ’	-

    “ ‘ I have,’ answered Kitty with great
 ent’usiasm 1 I have given eight hundred
 and fifteen cheers meself, actual count,
 for rayplyin’ as I did’

    “ ‘ Ye c’u’d give thim in two hours and
 five minutes,’ said Tim ‘have ye filled
 in the balance av the time by regrettin’
 me  ’

   “‘Regret ye’ she replied with a
 laugh and toss av her brown curls ‘ ye
 cold-blooded polthroon, who w’u’d cal
 culate on askin’ a lady to marry ye as ye
 w’u’d on buyin’ a horse! Niver will I
 regret ye’

   “ ‘ Raymimber, woman,’ said Tim,
 raisin’ his pencil, ‘ I have calculated the
 day ye were born ye are too old ivir to
 have that question raised again’

    “ Kitty, for all her blue eyes and pink
 cheeks, gave him a look as black as a
 witch ‘ Ye are a polthroon,’ she said
 wance more

   “ Tim felt this was a hard wurrud,
 which it was above the power av the
 highest arithmetic to ixplain He thought
 it over in a dark humor, feelin’ that she
 had raised a wall betwane thim

    “ 1 Yez answer last night was correct,’
 he tould her thin, as if it had been a-sum
 in figgers ‘will ye let me join in the
 cheerin’’ With this he raytrated cau-
 tiously through the door, cornin’ back for
 his hat whin he heard the station-call in
 the telygraph office

    “ Afther a while he went into the sta-
 tion - room and stood around prisintly
 the ingineer av the switch-ingine came in,
 too and Kitty, who had pretended not
 to notice who was there, stopped behint
 the counter av the telygraph office

    “ She smiled at the ingineer, who came
 up to the windy and stood sideways, with
 wan eye glarin’ at Tim and the other
 winkin’ at Kitty, till the fireman rang the
 bell for him Tim took his place before
 the counter, but she paid no attintion till
 he had called her twice

    “ ‘ I am not to blame,’ he said ‘ Kitty,

  “ ‘ Beware, woman it is the pride av

this was out av ear-shot, for he didn’t
want her to be warned av his relative

  “ All that afthernoon he attracted un-

  “ When he got through upbraidin’ his
ancistor for bein’ a spendthrift av the
family courage, it was time fur the
through flier and, afther a calculation
which w’u’d have humbled ashthronomy
to the dust, he strolled across the track
with Kitty watchin’ him from the windy

  “ This time the draft av the train not

head by the roots, and left him spinnin’
like a top in the cinter av the track behint
the train When he c’u’d walk ag’in with-
out feelin’ that he was on a turn-table,
Tim looked in at the telygraph office,
where Kitty lay across the table in a
faint

  “ ‘Ye are losin’ color from worryin’
over that answer,’ said Tim

  “ ‘ Ye are a fool,’ whispered Kitty,
white as a ghost

  “ ‘ It is the raysult av calculation,’
rayplied he

   “ ‘ Not so it is the raysult av nature,’
said Kitty, and, as her face from bein’
very white began to grow very black, Tim
went away quickly to curse the ancistor
who had left his descendants to shiver
with fear

  “ That evenin’ the ingineer walked
home with Kitty and later, when Tim
passed the house, he saw him makin’ a
call, for Kitty had placed him so the
lamp w’u’d throw his shadow on the
windv-curtain

  “ ‘ That is a big, strong shadow,’ said
Tim, ‘ but I w’u’d stand up against it, if
the owner w’u’d raymain quiet’

  “ Thin he went to Flannagan’s, the
flagman, who had a library av his own

  “‘What is polthroon’ asked Tim

   “ ‘ I will tell ye,’ says Flannagan 1 I
have “ polthroon ” at me tongue’s end
Bridget, where is the dictionary’

  “ ‘ Sure, I traded it for two magazines
av fashion,’ answered Mrs Flannagan,
who had wore a polky-dot calico, and
an osthritch-feather with an elbow in it,
for three years

  “ ‘ Ye are a peacock, who w’u’d feed
on book-worms,’ said Flannagan, woild
at the thought ‘ Where is the other book
av the library  ’

   “ ‘ I used it for currul-papers we have
wurrds enough in the house already’

  “ ‘ I will go to the beer-garden,’ said
Flannagan in a threatenin’ voice

   “ ‘ It is an invitation,’ said she, put-
tin’ on her hat and so Tim and Flanna-
gan stayed at home and played pinochle
till they quarreled, and the two av thim
thrust Tim outdoors

  “ He went past Kitty’s house again
The ingineer was still callin’, and Tim
calculated the width av his shoulders on
the curtain before undoublin’ his fists and
walkin' on softly

  “ But next mornin’ Tim went to take
the car numbers, wonderin’ why the sun
didn’t rise As he came back toward the
depot through the yards, it got so dark
that the caves below Killarney w’u’d

The Inside of the Freight
Department

BY T S DAYTON '

WHEN a boy gets a watch he always wants to examine the works When
he gets older he doesn’t care, but he still carries with him the passion
for looking at the inside of things to find out how they work This
curiosity is the secret of achievement This article is for the young men who
have that wide-awake curiosity If you read it you will not find your curiosity
satisfied, but only more excited Then you will get in and do something That
is what we want

How a Great Railroad Organizes Its Chief Revenue-Producing Traffic
a Glimpse of the Big and Little Men Who Do the
Work, and How They Do It

,HE traffic-manager of a rail-
way is usually one of the
highest salaried men on the
official list His post is
close—if not next—in real
importance to that of the
president, even if a few vice-presidents
may outrank him On many of the large
systems, however, the traffic-manager is
one of the vice-presidents

  Although he has charge of passenger
traffic as well as freight, it is with freight
affairs that he is most especially con-
cerned, even though he has as his chief
lieutenant a highly qualified general
freight-agent The freight earnings of

a railroad are about three times as much
as the passenger earnings, and seventy-
five per cent of the road’s total receipts

  Twenty years ago the average salary of
a good traffic-manager was ten thousand
dollars a year, and of a general freight-
agent a little over half that sum Exact
wage statistics of this sort are hard to get
at, but it is safe to say that to-day there
are several traffic-managers who are draw-
ing more than twenty thousand dollars
annually, and a fair number of general
freight-agents who get ten thousand and
over

  What must a man know in order to
fill either of these high places with credit

to himself and with profit to his com-
pany Let us first take up the traffic-
manager’s qualifications and duties, and
then work down through the list of his
subordinates, on whom he depends—those
who head his various sub-departments—
clear through to the station-agent out on
the firing-line, for among these or their
employees are the traffic - managers and
general freight-agents of to-morrow

The Busiest Man

  One of the traffic-manager’s principal
duties is rate-making—a task that, owing
to the ever-changing adjustments of trade,
is never finished These rates cover prin-
cipally the transportation of goods Up-
on his skill in fixing them so as to leave
a reasonable profit for the road and at
the same time stimulate business depends
to a great extent the prosperity of his
company

  Every civilized human being has an
influence on the ebb and flow of the
freight business The adjustments of
trade to-day may be obsolete to-morrow
That is why the traffic-manager’s task of
rate-making is never finished

  Even the president himself does not
keep as minute watch of the company’s
total receipts and expenditures as does the
traffic-manager, who also scrutinizes con-
tinually the total volume of traffic—how
it is made up, how it fluctuates and what
its ever-changing and peculiar needs are

  He keeps in close touch with the head
of the operating department in regard
to the number and time of trains He
conducts the difficult negotiations with
the traffic-managers of other roads rela-
tive to through rates, what percentage of
the revenue each road shall receive, and
all other questions in regard to the inter-
change of traffic He must know the
conditions of every business and of all
markets, and must work continually to
increase the traffic of his road

Traffic-Manager’s Right Arm

   To do all this, the traffic-manager must
be a man of mature judgment, he must
have clearness of perception, firmness,
consistency of purpose, practical experi-
ence and a perfect familiarity with the
resources of the company If he is in-

competent no one can lose so much money
for a railroad in so little time

  It is the traffic-manager’s first lieuten-
ant, the general freight-agent—his un-
derstudy, in fact—on whom his success
depends to a considerable extent In cases
of necessity, this official temporarily as-
sumes all the duties of the traffic-man-
ager in making rates and directing the
flow of traffic	

  The general freight-agent’s first duty,
however, personally and through his
subordinates, is to get business for the
road and keep his competitors from ta-
king it away It has to be hunted out
and solicited precisely as other goods
are sold The competing sellers of
freight transportation, however, have a
little more handicap than the sellers of
merchandise, for their prices are all the
same, and they have>to depend on per-
sonality and service to get the business

A Man of Leisure

  In brief, the principal routine duties
of the general freight-agent, outside of
getting business, are as follows He issues
regulations governing the transportation
of freight and the disposition of perish-
able property and high-class freight
He has to keep an eye out to see that there
is no laxity in the weighing and inspec-
tion of freight in transit over his line that
the cars are not overloaded so as to go
limping to the repair-shop in unusual
numbers

  He prescribes what classes of freight
shall and shall not be loaded together,
how it shall be placed in or upon cars,
how it shall be handled while in transit
and when it arrives at destination, and
the disposition to be made of claims, for
delay, overcharge, loss and damage Fi-
nally he has to see that measures are rig-
idly enforced to insure-getting the freight
to its destination in the shortest possible
time after the railroad receives it from the
shipper

  Issuing regulations and seeing that
they are enforced are parts of the gen-
eral freight-agent’s work that the pub-
lic sees little of To the many people
who call on him in the course of a day,
he seems to be a man of abundant leis-
ure in which to discuss affairs

  The general freight-agent climbs up
20

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

to his place through a long list of sub-
ordinate offices He knows about the
weight and bulk of freight—perhaps, be-
cause he long has handled it at some sta-
tion He is familiar through long ex-
perience with every fine point of the
freight classification

  He understands thoroughly the re-
sources of the country that is tributary
to the hundreds or thousands of miles
through which his road passes The strife
for business at junction or other com-
petitive points makes it imperative that
he shall know what his rivals are doing,
so that none of them shall catch him
napping

Men Who Get the Freight

  Connected with the general freight of-
fice, when it is located in a large city,
are a number of freight solicitors who
report either directly to that office or to
the heads of the branch offices which are
located at various strategic points
throughout the town These men are like
the city salesmen of a large mercantile
house Wherever there is a possibility
of getting business they go after it

  If the newspapers mention the letting
of a big contract which will involve the
transportation of large quantities of ma-
terial, they are at the contractor’s office
in the morning awaiting his arrival so
as to present the advantages of haying
the business transported over their line

  They have a wide acquaintance, and
their work brings them in touch with
every class of industry and with all sorts
of people As all the competing railroads
are practically on an even basis as far as
rates are concerned, the successful solic-
itor must be a man of pleasing per-
sonal it}'

  He must know how to interpret the
freight classification correctly and must
also be familiar not only with the rates
which it governs, but also with a vast
number of commodity and special rates
Like the commercial salesman he must
have a thorough- knowledge of the goods
he is selling, and must make no mistakes
when quoting prices

  The salaries of these freight solicitors
vary according to their experience, ac-
quaintance, and efficiency A beginner
would not receive over $40 a month He

would be sent out at first to answer re-
quests for rates on specific classes of ship-
ments, with th!e information carefully
prepared in advance, and with instruc-
tions to refer any new inquiry to the of-
fice for further instructions

  By the time he had learned his job
thoroughly and was able to be trusted
to “ run alone,” his salary would be
double that If he rose to be one of the
crack business getters in his department,
he could doubtless command $125 a
month

  There are cases where freight solicitors
are paid as high as $175 a month, but
they are men of exceptional talents in
that line, and they generally become divi-
sion freight-agents when they are able
to command that salary

  A boy or a young man who wishes to
enter this branch of the freight depart-
ment—and by many it is considered one
of the best in which to acquire a knowl-
edge and experience that will be of great
service in securing future advancement—
should make his application to the divi-
sion freight-agent in the district in which
he is located The general freight-agent,
except on very large systems where the
departments are minutely subdivided, has
the hiring of the freight solicitors who
cover the city or section of the country
in which the general offices are located
These men report direct to his office Ap-
plication for this employment should be
made by letter or in person to that official

The Inside Force

  But the soliciting end of a freight de-
partment, while extremely important, is
no more so than the great office forces—
the men who by letter and by record-book
carry on the work that the solicitors have
begun It is only a part of the detail to
secure the business Once obtained it
must be looked after most carefully, and
for this the railroad needs not only a large
but an able and energetic clerical force

  Each freight department of a large
railroad, though individual lines differ in
their planning, is divided, as regards-its
inside workings, into approximately these
sub-departments: The- Freight Tariff
Bureau or Rate Department, the Freight
Claim Department, the Tracing Depart-
ment, and the Overcharge Department
THE INSIDE OF THE FREIGHT DEPARTMENT

21

Closely allied with these, though not a
part of the Freight Department itself is
the car accountant’s office—a part of the
Accounting Department—which keeps
track of where the cars are

  How large these sub-departments are,
may be realized from the records of one
of the large Eastern railroads that has in
its main office twenty-five clerks in its
Overcharge Department alone, forty
clerks in its Rate Department, sixty to
seventy-five clerks in its Freight Claim
Department, and fifteen in its Tracing
Department—about one hundred and
fifty in all

Makers of Rates

  The titles of these departments are
largely self-explanatory Each is pre-
sided over by a highly qualified executive
clerk, and the Claim Department is gen-
erally so important that its head has his
name in the list of officials under the title
of freight claim-agent

  The Freight Tariff or Rate Bureau
has in direct charge the making up of all
the freight rates—those based on-the clas-
sification, commodity rates, special rates,
local and through rates In the matter
of through rates, however, they furnish
only the data whicl is necessary for the
heads of the Traffic Department to de-
termine the basis on which they shall ad-
just the through charges and the propor-
tions thereof with the connecting lines
who participate in hauling the merchan-
dise

  Whenever changes in through rates oc-
cur—and  that is always happening in
some part of the country—the Rate De-
partment sees that its tariffs are adjusted
as quickly as possible to meet the changed
conditions The schedules of freight
rates that continually come from this of-
fice are passed upon by the general
freight-agent and by the traffic-mauager
before they are issued for use

  This department is in charge of a chief
clerk, who is generally a member of the
freight tariff committees throughout the
country, and has to keep in close touch
with them personally and by correspond-
ence Rate making in the freight depart-
ment of a railroad is a science by itself
that takes the ablest man a number of
years to be classed as an expert

  It is a common saying that no one
ever learns it thoroughly The experts,
however, are among the best-paid men
iii the clerical force of the Traffic De-
partment It is rare for them, however,
to rise to the higher executive positions

  The Freight Tariff Bureau’s head, on
an important line, will receive on the av-
erage $200 a month salary His chief
assistants will draw from $100 to $150 a
month Those who do the routine work
will get the usual scale of clerical labor,
according to their knowledge and effi-
ciency, from $40 to $75 or a little over

  If mistakes and accidents never hap-
pened, the Freight Claim Department
would not exist But where there are
millions of individual shipments each year
—as there are on each of the great rail-
way systems—there must be a certain
proportion of errors, out of which claims
arise The classes of freight claims are:
loss, damage, and overcharge

  The number and amount of claims are
very great on even the best organized
line Each one has to be carefully in-
vestigated, which takes endless time and
patience

  Shippers put in claims hastily in many
cases The consignee of a few pieces
of household goods, for instance, does not
receive them as promptly as he thinks he
should He concludes that they are lost
and writes the railroad company that
such is the case, usually claiming a value
on the goods that is far in excess of what
they are worth

Most Interesting Department

  The Claim Department puts a number
on his letter and replies asking for the
original bill of lading so they can make
investigation Meantime the goods have
arrived, and nothing more is heard
about it

  Nevertheless, on many roads this is
numbered and listed as a claim This
partly explains why the number of claims
per year on a large system will often pass
the hundred-thousand mark

  At best the adjustment of claims is
one of the most vexatious branches of
the service It is to the road’s interest
to make prompt and full settlement of
every just claim But every claim must
be examined carefully before it is passed
22

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  In a case such as that of the house-
hold goods, if they had been really lost,
or were received in a damaged condition,
the railroad company would have to fol-
low up the matter step by step, a'nd ascer-
tain every particular as to where they
were lost and why or how much they
were damaged This investigation is nec-
essary in order to prevent the road from
being imposed upon, and it is also neces-
sary to ascertain the cause of the mishap,
for upon that may hinge something im-
portant concerning the efficiency of the
service

Making of Mail

  If the claim is for local traffic, its
adjustment is comparatively simple, but
if several other roads have handled the
merchandise before it was lost or de-
livered in a damaged condition to the
consignee, it becomes a complex matter
to fix the blame, and the result is seem-
ingly endless correspondence caused by
the making of innumerable inquiries
Occasionally a single claim-file will con-
tain no less than two thousand separate
letters and documents before it is finally
settled

  Paid or rejected it must be, however,
as quickly as the methodical investiga-
tion is finished, and the efforts of most
railroads are in the direction of investi-
gating claims to their conclusion with the
utmost despatch Otherwise their busi-
ness is likely to suffer

  In the Freight Claim Department,
where the Overcharge Department is a
distinct organization, the chief’s job is
worth from $200 to $250 as a general
thing His assistant will draw from $150
to $200 There will be a few employees
at $100, but the most of them will get
from $40 up for the clerical work

The Simple Side of It

  Overcharge claims are more easily ad-
justed than those for loss and damage
They outnumber the loss and damage
claims many times

  These overcharge claims arise in this
way There is an enormous number of
rates that an agent, even at the smallest
station, has to try to master

  If he charges too low a rate on the
way-bill it is the custom of some roads

to recharge the difference between that
and the right rate back on the unfortunate
agent If he is not able to collect this
undercharge from the shipper or con-
signee he has to pay it out of his own
pocket

   Therefore, in order to obviate this, the
agent takes the safe side and charges the
highest rate that he thinks the traffic will
bear, and an overcharge results If the
receiving agent does not detect it—and
he has so much to do that he generally
does not—the error is caught, usually,
when the copy of the way-bill is revised
in the general office

  Frequently the consignee receives no-
tice that there is money due him on ac-
count of an overcharge in rate before
he knows it himself Large customers of
the railways, however, usually keep a
rate clerk of their own and send in their
claims as quickly as the errors are found

  The Overcharge Department’s scale of
salaries is not quite so high as the Freight
Claim Department’s because it handles al-
most solely questions of fact and not
those involving long investigation, nice-
ties of judgment, or discretion The chief
of this division receives about $150 a
month and has a number of expert rate
clerks who draw from $75 to $100 a
month each The lesser salaries run
about the same as those in the claim office

Sherlock Holmes Bureau

  When a shipper thinks his goods are
slow in reaching destination he writes
or calls up the Freight Department on the
telephone and asks them to start a tracer
after them The Tracing Department
forthwith proceeds to do so by first as-
certaining the number of the car in which
the shipment was made and other details,
and then writing or wiring each division
point between point of origin and des-
tination The car numbers are checked
at each point and the receiving agent is
also communicated with

  If, in the case of less than car-load
shipments, the car in which the goods
were shipped reaches the destination of
the merchandise being traced minus the
goods, several things may have happened
to account for the loss The goods may
have been stolen—which is rare—or they
may have been hastily unloaded with
THE INSIDE OF 1 HE FREIGHT DEPARTMENT

23

 other goods bearing marks that resembled
 theirs in the lantern light Again, they
 may have been overlooked and carried
 l'ar beyond their destination, thus becom-
 ing astray freight

    It is the business of the Tracing De-
 partment to find out what became of the
 goods, if possible If it cannot, and the
 goods have disappeared, then its file be-
 comes the basis of settlement in the
 Freight Claim Department in the regular
 order of things

   Frequently, where one or more car-
 loads of perishable or much needed
 freight is being hurried through, the ship-
 per requests the railway to “trace by wire,”
 The Tracing Department thereupon re-
 ceives reports from all the division points
 of the passage of the car or cars, and
 keeps the' consignee and consignor ad-
 vised of their progress, if it is so desired
 This obviates the cars being delayed in
 transit except by extraordinary causes

   The Tracing Department’s chief execu-
 tive is on about the same salary basis
 as the head of the Overcharge Depart-
 ment Aside from his principal assist-
 ant, however, the average of salaries in
 ' this department is between $40 and $50
 a month The principal qualification is
 care and exactness in keeping the multi-
 tude of records straight

The Man of Figures

   The car accountant’s office is the
 one upon which the Freight Department
 depends for essential information regard-
 ing the movement of its merchandise and
 the location of the supply of empty cars
 The car accountant is advised daily by
 agents and conductors of' the location
 and use of each car on the line, whether
 it is loaded or empty, in good or bad
 order

   His work is one of immense routine
 and requires the utmost exactitude on
 the part of every member of his large
 staff of clerks Without the car ac-
 countant’s aid the Freight Department,
 especially, would be almost helpless

   The car accountant is paid $200 to
 $250 a month, and even more on a big
 system His principal aides get prob-
 ably $1-75 and $150 a month

    The bulk of the work is purely clerical,
 the entering up in great books of endless

car numbers, the going over of thousands
of reports each day It is the kind of
drudgery that work of that sort cannot
escape being, and there are more salaries
of $40 and $50 a month paid in this de-
partment than those over $65

  Away from the general office of the
railway, in almost every large city, on its
own line, and in practically every city
in-the United States from which it may
hope to draw freight traffic for a greater
or less proportion of the through haul,
are its district or division freight-agents
Each of these keeps informed of the
traffic conditions at each point in his
territory

The Feelers of the Service

  Fie has to know the producers and
merchants of each town in his district,
the kind and quantity of the merchandise
shipped and received by them He watches
the fluctuations in shipments to see wheth-
er a decrease in their amount is caused
by decreased demand, ill-adjusted rates,
inadequate facilities for reaching mar-
kets, or whether they are being diverted
over competing lines	'

  The division freight-agent located on
the line of his own road keeps in close
touch with the station-agents on his divi-
sion He advises the general freight-
agent of traffic situation in his particular
district, and of any need for rate adjust-
ments to meet changing conditions

  These district or division agents, ac-
cording to the importance of the terri-
tory in which they are situated, have a
clerical staff and force of solicitors to
drum up business for the road They
are of great importance to the Freight
Department and their ranks are most
frequently recruited from the most able
of the freight solicitors, or from the large
number of station-agents on the line

  A position of this sort pays from $175
a month up, according to the importance
of the territory that has to be looked
after

  The boy or man who wishes to secure
a place in any of these divisions of the
General Freight Department should or-
dinarily apply to the head of the division,
either personally or by letter,- in either
case stating his qualifications and refer-
ences as briefly as possible

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  If he is a stenographer, the chances
for quick employment and more rapid
advancement are much increased For
the applicant who is inexperienced there
is nothing to do except to begin among
the bottom rounds of the ladder, to master
his own duties first and then to learn
all he can of what the work is that is
going on about him

The Open Door

  A youth of eighteen or twenty is re-
garded as the most desirable timber in
these minor places, for if he has the right
stuff in him he learns quickly and is
ready for promotion when it offers The
rule in all railroads is to fill vacancies
by promotion from positions next in line
—providing, of course, the man next be-
low is competent

  The aspirant for a place in the general
freight office itself should address him-
self to the head of that department The
run of salaries there, for ordinary labor,
is about the same as it is in the subor-
dinate divisions The general freight-
agent’s chief clerk will receive $125 to
$150 a month

  There are, of course, one or more as-
sistant general freight-agents whose sal-
aries run from $250 a month up, but
these high positions, naturally, are filled
by men of long years of service and wide
experience

  If an application is made personally,
the applicant will doubtless be asked to
write a letter detailing his qualifications,
so that it may be placed on file It is
often the belief that this request is but
a convenient excuse for getting rid of
him

Importance of the Agent

  This is not so These letters of ap-
plication are carefully classified as they
are filed, and whenever a vacancy occurs
that cannot be filled from the staff in the
office they are taken out and gone over
most scrupulously Vacancies of this sort
do not occur every day, therefore the
applicant may hear nothing of -his letter
for weeks or months before he is asked
to call

  Every station-agent on a railway is an
indirect employee of the Freight Depart-

ment—one of its great mainstays, in
fact He gets small pay usually, but at
the smaller competitive points especially,
where the road has no other representa-
tive, he can do much toward increasing
his line’s business

  If he is a better hustler than his com-
petitor, the volume of freight from his
station steadily increases until some day
there is a vacancy at a more important
station or in a higher post in another
department, and he is promoted

  Most station-agents start in as tele-
graph operators In fact it is the rule
that at small stations the agent shall know
telegraphy A station of this sort, where
one man does all the work, pays $40
a month on the average

  At larger stations where there are day
and night operators, a car clerk, etc, the
pay will run from $60 to $100 a month
The latter figure is well up toward the
top of the scale

The Road to Fame

  As has been said, a knowledge of tel-
egraphy is one of the most frequent step-
ping-stones to the station-agent’s place
There are many schools that teach tel-
egraphy, and it can also be studied at
home The superintendent of telegraph
is frequently called upon to send men to
fill these minor agencies

  An operator desiring to become a sta-
tion-agent would do well to file his appli-
cation with that official, and also with the
general superintendent, or whichever of
his assistants in the Operating Depart-
ment lias charge of appointing agents
The custom varies on different roads

  Aspirants—young men especially—
who have had no experience and desire
to enter the railway service by this door,
should apply to the station-agent in their
own town, if he has an office force The
smallest position is usually that of station-
messenger, which will pay perhaps $15
or $20 a month

  But there is always an opportunity for
the youth who wishes to learn to become
familiar with the station routine and with
telegraphy as well It will be encour-
aging for him to remember that probably
more railway officials, from presidents
down, started in as station-agents and
operators than as anything else

CHAPTER XV

Good-By

        T mattered little where the Swede
           went It matters little, as a
           rule, where a picked-up sailor
           wants to go Higgs wanted
           to proceed to Colon, while
           Miss Harding wished to re-
           turn to New York as soon as possible

  Naturally, Philip Sand being master,
Miss Harding’s wish was law Presently
the Chameleon headed in a northwesterly
direction

  The captain briefly told his story It
was merely an amplification of what the
mate had related Pearce, however, was
of the opinion that some one was behind
the cable of the shipping-agents, ordering
a search for the survivors of the Re-
vuelan

  “ I don’t know who it was,” said Pearce,
“ unless it was the owner of the Chame-
leon”

  “ Who is he, by the way f’ asked
Philip, with assumed indifference “I
have forgotten for the moment”

  The captain looked curiously at him
for a moment, then he said:

  “ The original owner was a Mr Plard-
ing—Frederick Harding I sailed this
yacht before, Mr Sand In fact, it just
so happened that you turned up to char-
ter her just as all hands were about to be
paid off Most of them were, in fact”

  “ Harding ” mused Philip

  “ Yes,” said Pearce, laughing “ I’ll tell
you something more This Miss Harding
whom you brought aboard with you is—is

a relation of the owner Perhaps that’s
why there were prompt searching orders”

  “ M-m-m-m! ” hummed Philip

  Pie thought he began to understand
He remembered that when Miss Harding
said she knew the Chameleon, and that
she had sailed on her as a guest of Mer-
ton Scragg, he had been filled with the
conviction that Scragg was not the own-
er’s name, but that the real name had a
familiar sound, though he could not re-
call it Harding! Of course! It was,
and should have been, familiar

  But where did Merton Scragg come
in Miss Harding had said that she had
sailed on the Chameleon “ as a guest of
Merton Scragg” She could hardly sail
as a guest of her relative, Frederick
Harding Where did Merton Scragg
come in

  Then a light dawned on Philip’s mind
The yacht had been given up just when
he chartered it Miss Harding had dis-
tinctly stated that Scragg was the owner
of it The ghost of Miss Sharpe’s warn-
ing voice came up in the conversation
There was something here which was not
to be discussed, but Philip thought he un-
derstood

  Miss Harding's father had fallen into
the hands of the skinflint Scragg Scragg
was the owner of the yacht—by a mort-
gage, perhaps, just as he was owner of
Philip Sand, body and soul Yet-Miss
Harding had distinctly stated that her
father was rich!

  However, the matter was of too deli-
cate a nature for discussion with Captain
Pearce Philip gave the order for the
run to New York, saying that the mat-

ter of further orders would be discussed
later

  “ How about the treasure, Mr Sand”

  “ I’m tired of treasure,” said Philip
wearily

  And, indeed, a new mood had come
upon him It seemed that the adventure
was over, and that no future adventure
could be as pleasant or as sweet Now
that Miss Harding was safe and was
about to be restored to her proper envi-
ronment, the bottom had fallen out of so
many things that Philip was quite dis-
heartened

  Nevertheless, despite his determination
to freeze her back into her shell of re-
serve, he spent many hours of the pre-
cious three days with her One day he
kept away from her altogether, but after
dinner'in the evening he could stand it
no longer He sought her out where she
sat abaft the funnel He sank into a
chair by her side and was silent

  “ Philip,” she said suddenly It was
the first time she had called him by his
Christian name since coming off in the
boat from the island “ Philip, after you
leave me at New York, what are you go-
ing to do ”

  For a moment he was dumb The
question had come so abruptly It was
so terse and pointed It covered the
whole problem over which his heart and
mind had been battling

  “When I leave you at New York”
he echoed

  “Yes,” she said quietly

  He was, somehow, disappointed at her
quiet acceptance of the necessity But it
was necessity

  “ What am I going to do  ”

  “ Yes You are going to do something,
of course”

  Her tone jarred him- It was so unlike
her

   “ Does it really interest you to know ”
he asked

  “ Philip—you know it does” And he
was sorry on the instant

  “ Well, I chartered this yacht to hunt
treasure,” he said Having found the
treasure and having time to kill, before
time kills me, I suppose I shall have to
find other mischief for my idle hands
to do”

  “What like”

  “ Trade, for instance Take cargoes

and deliver them, and get more cargoes
and amass money and give it to the sail-
ors to spend I might have a string-
orchestra aboard to liven the men as they
load up with coconuts or logwood
There’s lots of things I can and will do”
“ Philip,” she said gravely, “ you are
in a very bad frame of mind I under-
stand and sympathize thoroughly But,
listen to me I want you to do something
—to do something for me”

  He sat up, turned around, and caught
her hand

  “ Verina,” he said hoarsely, “ you know
that there is nothing I would not do for
you Tell me what to do for you, and
I will indeed have something to do—
something it will be a joy to do”

  “ It is a very simple thing, Philip I
want you to say good-by to me at New
York, believing that all may yet be well
—for you Then I want you to sail
right out to the open sea and stay there
You once spoke of filibustering and tra-
ding, and you said something just now
about cargoes Go and do these things,
Philip Forget your illness Forget
everything—

  “ Well, if it will help you, think of me
sometimes, and know that my prayer is
that you may grow strong and well That
is all I want, Philip Will you do this
for me ”

  “I will, Verina,” said he “but what
good will it do ”

  “ I think it will do lots of good Re-
member I saw you when you came aboard
the Revuelan You did not know that I
saw you , but I did, and I have thought
of it since—since you told me you were
ill I remember now that you looked just
a little bit pale and languid But you are
not that now You look brown and sin-
ewy and strong and—and—” She sud-
denly bent forward and took one of his
hands in both of hers “ Philip,” she
whispered tensely, “ I don’t want you to
die You mustn’t die You must fight to
live, because it means much to me”

  “ I understand, he said “ Thank
you—and God bless you ! ”

  He lay back in his chair, quite happy
for the moment Then the lean fantom
of Merton Scragg arose before him
Merton Scragg! Even if he did get well,
there was the mortgage

  Then his heart leaped Everything in
TREASURE OF THE WORLD

his body responded to the fighting call
He would get well He would make
money to buy back his life He had less
than eleven months To make twenty
thousand dollars, plus interest, in that
time was no small task for a man with
110 particular or special ability But he
had the yacht, and he had optimism and
determination  and there was a prize to
be his if he won health and twenty thou-
sand dollars—Verina!

  “And after that” he said

  “ After that ” she echoed very softly
“ Let us speak of that—then You will
come to me—come to see me, for I must
know if my doctoring is better than my
cooking and I am sure it is You will
come to me at the end of the year and
tell me how it has gone with you Philip,

I will be waiting to look into your face
and know that you are well and strong”
He understood all that she did not say
His eyes'were filled with tears and his
throat thick with tenderness He took
one of her hands gently and almost rev-
erentially kissed the finger-tips

  “ I will try—I will try so hard I
will fight! ”

  “ Good! ” she said bravely, and the
little fingers closed tightly over his hand
“To-morrow, then, I shall be in New
York I will leave you my address You
are not to leave the yacht As soon as
you have said—good-by to me—I know
my way home, surely—you will about-
ship, as you salt-water people say, and
heave away 611 the raging main Good
night, Philip You have been very good
—better than any man I ever knew You
know that I feel that, don’t you”

  “ Verina,” he said, “ I know every word
that you would say, and you know what
is in my heart Good night, dear! ”

  “You may come in! ” cried Verina
Philip entered the cabin She stood in
the middle of the little room, and the
sunlight shone through the port Out-
side, tugboats shrieked and big liners
growled Close by, a ferry - house bell
clanged, and a great river castle slid
slowly out across the stream

  Verina was dressed in the height of
fashion The yacht had been but an
hour in port, but in that time a young
woman had come aboard with two suit-
cases and a bandbox And now Verina

Harding was again arrayed as a sweet
American girl in summer costume

  As Philip entered, she held out a card
to him

  “ Put that away safely until the time
comes when you want to find me,” she
said

  He took the card mechanically He
was looking at her with the eyes of love’s
worship She laughed happily

  “ Do I look like a castaway on a des-
ert island  ” she inquired archly

  “ You are the dearest woman in the
world—and the best loved ! ” said he

  “Philip,” she said reproachfully, “we
mustn’t go as far as that” He noticed
the “ we” It was advice, not reproach

  “ I suppose you are right You are
right,” he said

  Then there was silence

  “ I am ready now, she said at last
There was a little quiver in her words
“ Good-by, Philip”

  “ Good - by,” he said brokenly He
stood away from her, with his hands
hanging helplessly at his side

  For a moment she looked, then her eyes
filled with tears In another moment she
was in his arms

  “ Philip! Philip ! ” she whispered
“ What fools we are not to say what is
in our hearts! You are the best and no-
blest thing in my life Don’t think I am
sending you away I want to make you
well and strong again, so that we can be
happy always And—Philip—if it is not
to be, remember this: I love you, and I
will wait—oh, I will be patient and so
must you, because we must pay for our
happiness”

  He drew her close to him

  “ Yes, perhaps we have been foolish,”
he said “ Now, you have made me hap-
py I love you, dear—love you the more
because I cannot have you But I will
go away and fight—oh, I shall fight so
hard, for it is not my happiness only It
is yours now I must win! ”

  “You shall,” she whispered, drawing
away from him

  He opened the door for her She
reached out her hand and pushed it back
again It was then, as she stood looking
her last upon him, that he noticed a
string of pearls around her neck

   “ My fishing-line,” he said huskily

  “ Yes Kiss me    Good-by”
28

  He would have followed her to the
deck, but she said “ No” Then the door
closed, and he was alone He looked out
of the port-hole The sun-ray was slant-
ing across the cabin The air breathed
of her late presence A fresh red rose lay
upon the pillow where she had slept He
took it up tenderly and touched his lips
with it

   “ I must find a way back to life,” he
said to the rose

     CHAPTER XVI
     The Doctor’s Sentence

A LITTLE less than eleven months
after Philip Sand said good-by to
Verina Harding, the yacht Chameleon
steamed into New York Harbor

   Philip himself stood on the bridge be-
side Captain Pearce, and looked eagerly
at the tall buildings and the shipping and
the palisades ahead

  Verina’s advice had been good At
least, it had been well meant and, of
•course, she had not known of that other
complication Philip had obeyed her in-
junction to the letter He had manfully
fought for life He had been a trader
among the Caribbean Islands He had
been a filibuster around the Honduran
ports He had been a smuggler between
Curasao, Margarita, and Venezuela He
had steadfastly refused to think of his
misfortune

  He had dreamed night and day He
had allowed himself to think that all
things were possible, and especially he
had taken for accomplished the paying
oft' of the mortgage on his life and his
marriage to Verina Harding

   Dreaming hard is half the battle in
life Dreaming hard is optimism refined
—the belief that a-thing shall be Some
people say that half the efficacy of prayer
is the desire of good—the recording of
wishes with the belief that they will be
fulfilled

   In Philip’s case, dreaming hard seemed
to have achieved much Any man who
saw him immediately thought: “ What
a fine physique! ” And, indeed, he looked
the embodiment of health, strength, and
vigor

   He had little fear, however, of Lauris-
ton’s verdict His mind was filled with

that other difficulty—Merton Scragg and
the twenty thousand dollars For Philip
was a man of honor He had played his
cards and if he had lost, he was not go-
ing to cry mercy of his opponent

   But there was a bitter pill—the bitter
pill of many a man’s life He had had
the twenty thousand dollars—the neces-
sary amount to buy his life back—and he
had lost it At first, he had traded in
any old thing—logwood, coconuts, ba-
nanas, and other island produce He had
run the gantlet with firearms disguised
as “ bedsteads and lima - beans” He
had entered into anything and everything
that promised life and interest in life

   And because he cared little and rushed
into things with a gambler’s spirit, he
had won He had made money

  Then came-that last and greatest risk
—when he had invested his earned twenty
thousand dollars in a venture—and lost!

   To the treasure in the channel he had
paid no attention He had had enough
of the treasure Perhaps some of the su-
perstitious talk which he had hurled at
the heads of Howells and his men had
rebounded upon his own senses Perhaps
his dream of what happened to all who
had owned that treasure—and what, to
his own knowledge, had happened to its
last owners—jhad deterred, or driven from
his mind, the idea of raising it

   His first thought had been to win back
that treasure, against which all treasures
of the world are as dross—life! To keep
in the open air, to buoy his own interest
in life, to forget the why and wherefore
of his struggle, and just live-—these con-
stituted the commandments of his creed

  And as money began to pour into his
coffers, he had realized chucklingly that
taking care of his life meant taking care
of its wherewithal Thereafter he had
thought even less of Scragg and the mort-
gage The first thing was health Per-
haps he had won that, or very nearly, as
he had won back the twenty thousand
dollars—or very nearly

   But “ very nearly ” in this case meant
not at all He had lost his money and,
whether he had gained health or not, to-
morrow must see him dead, unless some
unforeseen thing happened to show him
a way out of his difficulty '

   Not for a moment did he think of cry-
ing off his bargain, although the sweet
TREASURE OF THE WORLD

29

ties of life were beckoning him from the
path of honor It would be easy enough
to say to Scragg :

  “ I am well, and you can do your worst
No court would uphold your infamous
stipulation

  Yet no stipulation had been made He
remembered that distinctly He remem-
bered Merton Scragg’s words when he
sought to specify the stipulation himself

  “ Mr Sand,” Merton Scragg had said,
“ I think we have said enough”

  It was understood, and it was as clear-
ly part of the contract as if it had been
set 011 paper, signed and sealed by both
parties in the presence of witnesses And
no part of the transaction was on paper,
save that Philip had willed Scragg his
entire property, which at the present mo-
ment consisted of a few hundred dollars,
some old books, fifty thousand dollars in
insurance, and a faded red rose

  Yet Philip had not given up hope He
believed that Scragg was a human being,
at least and he had heard stories of the
man’s private life which, although
strangely at variance vt’ith the popular
idea of the man, might be true

  It should be understood, however, that
Philip had no intention of going to
Scragg and crying mercy of the bargain
He was not of that sort He had made
the bargain with his eyes open He had
taken and enjoyed the man’s money—and
he had enjoyed it Now, being a gentle-
man, a sportsman, and a man of refined
honor, he was not going to cry peccavi

  But he would go to Merton Scragg and
tell him of the treasure At least, he
would ascertain Scragg’s attitude, and it
was just possible that thirty days’ grace
might be forthcoming If so, what might
he not do in thirty days  He might raise
the golden ingots and pay off the twenty
thousand dollars, with interest

  But, of course, everything depended
upon Lauriston’s verdict If he was not
cured of the disease, there would be little
use in clutching at a straw to prolong
life He had enjoyed his year He had
tasted love, life, travel, and adventure
If the end were merely to be deferred,
then—why not now Why not fulfil his
bargain with honor and a smile

  There were a thousand possibilities
One thought which recurred, despite his
hatred of it, was the fact that Verina

Harding loved him and that she was
rich If he married her—• He put the
thought away repeatedly, yet it had a
peculiarly insistent way of coming back
again and again

  A man of less refined instincts and a
less rigid code of morals would have lin-
gered, at least, over the thought of mar-
rying her and borrowing twenty thou-
sand dollars He decided to think 110
more of anything until he had seen Lau-
riston

  A11 hour later he was at the physician’s
office The waiting-room was filled, and
Philip had to wait for some time There
was a secretary—a pretty young woman—
whose business was to note the patients
as they entered, and this young woman
kept the physician in his inner sanctum
duly notified of the arrivals Most of
them she knew by name but Philip
seemed a stranger to her, although he
nodded as he entered and addressed her
by name

  As he sat there in the waiting-room,
reading a magazine six months old, he
was conscious that the secretary was
studying him She had seen him before,
but— He might be a stranger, and
strangers were not encouraged unless they
came by appointment Finally she arose
and came over to him

  “ You are Mr—”

  “ Sand—Philip Sand Have you for-
gotten me, Miss Armstrong ”

  “ Why, Mr Sand, I confess I had
You have been away—so long and—you
are looking so—changed”

  A moment later she was whispering
into the telephone Presently in walked
Lauriston The next patient arose to
take precedence, but Lauriston smiled
and said:

  “ Excuse me Miss Hollis I have an
urgent appointment with a gentleman
here whom I overlooked yesterday I am
sure you won't mind waiting a few min-
utes

  All the time his eyes were upon Philip,
and his face expressed astonishment

  “ Come this way, Mr Sand,” he said

  The physician presently closed the in-
ner door of the sanctum behind him For
once the reserved, gloomy doctor was al-
most human

  “ Upon my word ! Sand, you are mar-
velous But, there ! ” he warned “ Don’t

get your hopes up in the air You never
can tell Peel off your clothes I want
to listen”

  Philip smilingly stripped Lauriston
watched him curiously — noted the full
expanse of chest and the sun-tanned col-
lar above the breast-bones There was a
queer light in the physician’s eyes as he
came toward the patient with the stetho-
scope dangling from the back of his ears

  For a moment he looked down into the
clear eyes of the man whom he had prac-
tically condemned to death Then he
grunted and adjusted the Y-shaped tubes

  “ Take a long breath,” said he “ Say
‘Ah!’ Now' whisper ' ninety-nine’ ”

  There was silence after Philip Obeyed
the instructions Presently Lugubrious
Larry took the stethoscope from his ears,
laid them on the table, and walked up
and down the room for a half-minute
Then he faced Philip with an unbeliev-
ing light in his eyes

  “ Sand,” said he, “ if I did not know
to the contrary, and any man told me
that you had ever had anything the mat-
ter with your lungs,-I should say that he
was a blatant ass You are as sound as
a bell!”

  Philip took the physician’s outstretched
hand mechanically His heart was beat-
ing fiercely, joyously, rapidly He was
thinking of Verina Harding and the fu-
ture Then, like a fantom, arose the
specter of Shylock!

CHAPTER XVII

A Woman’s Claim

 N hour later, history, as if repeating
itself, brought Philip Sand to the
park  and once more he found himself
seated on a bench, watching the tame
ducks sailing about the pond, the chil-
dren feeding them with broken crackers,
and the self-conscious policeman twirling
his locust on his wrist-thong

  A year had passed—a year all but a
day—and the year was like the day that
it wanted So many things had happened
while the trees had lost their foliage,
while the ducks had squawked in their
winter quarters, while the pond had
frozen over

  He put his right hand into his left
breast-pocket and slowly drew forth a

card Should he see her No, he should
not Yet, while his conscience was tell-
ing him what was best for him and for
her, his heart was anticipating the meet-
ing

  To see her again! All he had to do
was to start now, and in half an hour he
would be facing her—Verina Harding—
looking into her eyes—into the eyes of
Verina Harding He must not go yet
already he was going

  “ There must be some way out, he
said to himself “ Perhaps I should have
told her that, even if I got better, I had
to reckon with Scragg but I never
dreamed that I would be as sound as a
bell That’s pretty sound and there is
no reason on earth, save one, why I
shouldn’t live a long, honorable, hon-
ored, and prosperous life Only — by
noon to-morrow I must either be dead or
ready with twenty thousand dollars, plus
interest”

  He tried to figure out just how much
interest was due, and it came to him sud-
denly that there had been no interest
spoken of Or, to be strict about the
matter, the interest was to be one hundred
and fifty per cent Merton Scragg was
to get fifty thousand dollars in return
for his loaned twenty thousand dollars
Of course, the old skinflint had not reck-
oned 011 getting a man’s life on top of
that but, if Scragg was really a Siy-
lock, he would demand his money or his
life The latter alternative meant life
first and money afterward

  “ Well,” said Philip, with a sudden
glowing of his blood, “ maybe Verina can
tell me I’m going to see her just for
that reason, to tell her all about it—to
ask her advice” Then he added to him-
self in a still, small voice: “ Philip, you
are a liar! You are going to see her be-
cause you must!”

  The address took him to a quiet part
of the unromantic Bronx The house was
an old Colonial thing, half hidden among
trees Around its environs brick tene-
ments—very new ones—were squeezing
up It was typical of the Bronx—yes-
terday and to-morrow hugging each other

  There was a broken-down wall, with
a wooden gate set in the middle of it
The gate whined as'Philip swung it open
and advanced up a grass - grown path
Before the old house there was a stump


TREASURE OF THE WORLD

of what must have been at one time a
magnificent tree Around this stump was
a bench, and on the bench sat Verina,
sewing

  She lifted her eyes as he came up Her
face turned pale Then she stood up and
awaited him with a glorious expression
about her mouth He took off his hat
and walked in the air toward her, his
eyes never leaving her face

  “ I am here,” said he quietly He had
not known how his feelings would greet
her

  She held out her hand

  “ And I was right—” she began, her
speech breaking off as if there was some-
thing which she wished to add, but was
afraid to

  “ Were you going to call me 1 Mr
Sand ’ ’’ he asked

  » No—Philip”

  “ Thank you ! Shall we talk here ”

  “ No,” she said, still with her eyes on
his face, his brow, his neck, his shoulders
—roaming over him “ Come in”

  As in a dream, she turned and walked
up the rickety old steps He followed,
only conscious that it was she—Verina!
His eyes were enchanted by the beautiful
figure, the dear, familiar head and hair,
and the sudden reality of her face

  She entered a dim hall, he close at her
heels She turned and shut the door, in
which were two panels of crimson glass
The light fell rich and ruddy upon her
as she faced him

  “ Philip! ” she whispered, and her eyes
filled

  “ My beloved! ” he said

  Then he remembered—that is, present-
ly She took him into a big, old-fash-
ioned drawing-room and drew him down
to a seat beside her

  “ Now, what is the story”

  “ Verina,” he said slowly and earnest-
ly, “ I think I am worse off than ever
You see, I did not tell you everything
I—”

  “ First, tell me,” she cried, “ what did
the doctor say  ”

  “ Pie says I’m—I’m—as sound as a
bell” said Philip, wondering how he was
tc come to the point without hurting her

  “ Then nothing matters! ” she whis-
pered jubilantly

  “ No—that makes my position worse,”
he said “ I have a confession to make

I never thought that this was possible,
or—”

  Then he told her At first her face
expressed amusement, then amazement,
then alarm, then terror

  “ But—but ”—she stammered—“ this
is—absurd ! I never heard of anything
so absurd You are not going to die
How are you to die between now and to-
morrow noon if—if God doesn’t will it
so

  Philip groaned “ But I took his
money,” he managed to say

  “ Pay it back,” she said sharply

   “ I can’t,” said he lamely “ I couldn’t
pay back a tenth of it I lost every-
thing”

  “ Then let me lend it to you I have
plenty”

  Philip shook his head emphatically

  “ Then ”—and her words camc very
slowly, very searehingly—“ what are you
going to do—as a man of honor”

  Philip was silent lie dared not look
at her, let alone speak He knew that
she understood Presently she got up
and walked about the room

  “ Philip,” she said softly and thought-
fully, “ I do not think this is a time for
pretense You know that I love you, and
I have never doubted your love Is not
your love big enough to surmount petty
things ”

  “ I do not understand you,” he said

  “ Loving one another, was it not un-
derstood, as love is always understood,
that when obstacles were cleared away we
should marry  ”

  “ This is worse than the treasure I
couldn’t enjoy,” said Philip

  She stopped in front of him Her
hands were lightly clasped before her
Her eyes were slightly downcast, and her
face crimson but she had decided the
question, and she meant to be brave about
the matter

  “ Philip, will you marry me—to-day ”
she said	' ,

  For a moment the room seemed to whirl
about his head He only saw her, beauti-
ful and womanly in her confusion of bra-
very He longed to take her in his arms
and hold her close—very close

  Presently he understood, but his heart
was torn between the natural demand of
the life-loving creature and the so-called
honor of ethic-bound custom

  “ Verina,” he almost moaned, “ don’t
tempt me”

  “ I am not tempting you I am not
trying — altogether trying to solve your
difficulty I am fighting for myself,
Philip—fighting for my love Your life
is not your own—not since that night on
the island I don’t think any man’s life
is ever quite his own Somebody loves
him I love you, Philip, and our lives
are as one If you take your own life, it'
is murdering me”

  “ I cannot take your money to—to save
myself I could never be happy”

  She began to walk about, rapidly and
nervously She toyed with papers, orna-
ments, and other things in an absent kind
of way Then she turned to something
else that momentarily attracted her whirl-
ing mind She understood his horror of
marrying her that he might pay off the
Shylock She honored him, too, for his
reluctance But she herself had some
views on the subject

   “ Philip,” she said, with her face avert-
ed, “ I am not good at expressing what
is in my heart—in my mind Perhaps it
is because I am so much in earnest But
listen, dear”

   “ I am listening, Verina,” he said husk-
ily

  “ I gave you my happiness—I gave it
into your keeping when I let you know
that I cared Perhaps I should not have
let you know Perhaps you should not
have let me know But it was my fault

I loved you, and I don’t know how it
camq about I forgot for a moment that
the woman should wait But—I forgot
—and you were so brave and—I loved
you so much”

  “Never mind that, dear,” said Philip

“ I was weak and— But we were hap-
py,” he added, lifting a haggard face to
hers

  “ Yes, we were happy I have been
happy all the year—waiting Philip, I
prayed — morning and night — for you
It was just a foolish little prayer but it
was all I could make up, perhaps be-
cause I was so much in earnest I said
often and often—in the street here, in the
garden, anywhere — ‘ God, maka Philip
Well again’ That was all, and I felt that
He would! And you see He did”

  There was silence in the room Philip
could not speak, and she was trying to

find once more the lost thread of her
argument

  “ I gave you my happiness—my life—
when I gave you my hpart, Philip Hu-
man beings—especially, I think, a man
and a woman when they love one another
—are peculiarly bound up together I
can understand why you did what you
did—a year ago that is, if you thought
you were going to die

  “ But you see how things have turned
out You are not going to die But you
owe a man twenty thousand dollars just
because you promised that you would be
dead

   “ But since then, Philip, you have made
a graver mistake You have given me
your life—your love Perhaps you had
no right to do it but perhaps I stole it,
and so stole your life

   “ It won’t do us any help to talk about
that, Philip,” she went on “ We can’t
understand these things, but it justshows
you that you have no right to barter that
which is in the hands of Fate The
wrong was in bartering even a shattered
life for money”

   “ I wouldn’t have met you if I hadn’t,”
said Philip, without looking up

  “That was Fate,” said Verina “ We
can’t alter decrees of Fate, Philip but
sometimes we can right what we have
done wrong Most of the acts of human
hands can be undone by human hands
Why can’t we undo this”

  “ I can’t take your money,” he reit-
erated “ I could no more sell myself
to you than buy you, Verina”

  She stamped her foot “ Who speaks
of buying and selling” she cried angri-
ly “ Look at me, Philip ! ”

  He lifted his head as she had com-
manded She was standing erect, with
her chin slightly lifted Her lips were
quivering, and two tears were perilously
near the corners of her eyes

   “ Verina! ” he said helplessly

   “ I know you didn’t mean it,” she said
“ but listen to me If there is talk about
buying and selling, let me say something
about taking and stealing and defraud-
ing If you pursue this foolish—no, I
shall not say foolish, for I understand
your position—but if you refuse to let me
rescue you, what will be the result Is
your life not mine

  “ Does my happiness count for noth-
TREASURE OF THE WORLD

33

ing Are you going to place the ficti-
tious value of so - called honor in the
scales with my love, my life, and my hap-
piness Don’t you understand me”

  “ But how am I to do this consistently
with honor — so-called or fictitious”
asked Philip “ Remember, it is the only
honor I have, and—I took and spent the
man’s money”

  “ I can write a check for twenty thou-
sand dollars and never miss it! ” she
cried “ and I could not let you go out
of my life quite as easily”

  He winced—for two reasons He knew
that her direct statement was only uttered
because it was no time for pretense He
knew that she was talking the sheerest
kind of common sense, but her writing
that check— He winced

  “ I cannot do it,” he said doggedly

  “ Philip! ” she cried, and her strong
attitude seemed to melt like wax She
dropped on her knees at his feet and
clung to him Fler voice came to him in
incoherent pleadings

  “ I cannot do it that way,” he said
“ but you mustn’t give up yet, little
woman I recognize with you that this
thing must be adjusted somehow There
must be a way Put your way aside,
dear, and let us think of something else”
In a little while she got up and sat be-
side him

  “ Well,” she said, “ what do you wish
to say—what is your plan”

  “ Listen,” he said “ There is one
chance I took this man’s money If I
had nothing to offer him but a plea for
mercy, I should not go near him  but I
believe I have something to offer him
If he would give me thirty days’ grace,
I might get that treasure”

  “He will!” cried Verina “I am
sure he will Oh, Philip, if you could—
Go to him—to-day—at once If he is a
human being at all, he will understand
Tell him about me Tell him I have
money, but you won’t take it Let me
come with you If I ask him—”

  “ Wait a minute,” said Philip, smiling
at her eagerness “The trouble is the
man If he is a human being at all, he
will, as you say, agree but it has always
been a question whether Merton Scragg
is a human being or not”

  “Who” she exclaimed

  “ Merton Scragg”

   3	RR

  “ Is that the man who—” She had
arisen to her feet and was staring down
at him, his face white and agitated

  “ Why, yes,” said Philip, puzzled
“ Merton Scragg—- He’s the man”

  “ Mer-ton Scragg,” she said, hardly
above a tense, agonized whisper

  For a moment she seemed like a woman
turned to cold marble Then she dropped
upon her knees and buried her face in hei
hands

       CHAPTER XVIII
       His Pound of Flesh

13HILIP let her be He sat near her,
staring and wondering Was it pos-
sible there were two Merton Scraggs—
one the skinflint Shylock, who was willing
-to trade even upon a man’s life, who
never -spent a penny on luxury, who
grudged seventeen minutes for his lunch-
eon of coffee and buns, who hoarded
every dollar like a miser the other a
man who owned a private yacht and put
to sea at intervals with guests of the class
and refinement to which Verina Harding
undoubtedly belonged 

  The suspicion was growing in Philip’s
mind that the Merton Scragg of Verina’s
acquaintance was identical with the Mer-
ton Scragg of his own And her present
behavior suggested that perhaps there
were two sides to this Merton Scragg
Although Philip was positive that Scragg
was not the name of the owner of the
Chameleon—or, at least, that it was not
the name as he had learned it from the
agents and from Captain Pearce, he could
not drive from his mind the fact that
Verina herself had positively declared
that it was “ Mr Merton Scragg’s yacht”

  She had recognized the Chameleon,
too, when it sailed into the cave at Caicos
Island And Philip remembered, also,
the peculiar recognition between Captain
Pearce and Verina Harding when the
party came off from the island

   Of course, nothing of all this proved
the identity of one Merton Scragg with
another But Pearce had said that the
owner’s name was Frederick Harding, as
the agents had, Philip remembered Ve-
rina had said it was Merton Scragg And
now, at the mention of the man’s, name,
she had sunk by the sofa, and her quiver-

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

ing shoulders were betraying some strange
inward emotional struggle There was
a tangle here

  What had this beautiful, refined woman
to do with the lean, hungry-jawed Shy-
lock of Wall Street Philip had some-
times wondered He had often regretted
that he had not asked her directly But
his policy had been to discourage inti-
macy between her and himself, so that
the forgetting—the seemingly mandatory
forgetting—might be the easier when the
seemingly inevitable time came

  But, as Verina had said, the time for
pretense was past They two were hope-
lessly bound up in each other The
crisis had come, and her present behavior
could not be passed over unexplained

  “ Verina,” he said, “ tell me one thing
Who is your Merton Scragg, and what is
he to you  ”

  A few minutes passed in silence She
arose to her feet and stood by the window
with her back to him Presently she
turned her face to him In her eyes was
an expression of bright hope, despite her
tears and her pallor

  “ Philip,” she said, “ I believe Fate—
or God—is being good to us in a mys-
terious way I cannot tell you every-
thing but Merton Scragg is my father’s
closest—I will not say dearest—friend
Merton Scragg is a peculiar man—a man
whom few people understand He is a
hard man in business—a merciless man

  “ But my father is his best friend, al-
though my father is under obligation to
him It might be that in a case of this
sort my father’s influence would have no
effect upon Mr Scragg But I am going
to try what my father and I can do to in-
fluence him He is, I think, very fond of
me—I mean Merton Scragg I believe
I am the only person in the world that
he truly loves”

  Philip’s heart grew heavy again It
seemed that his life lay in the hands of
Verina Harding He thought he saw the
position Her father was under Scragg’s
thumb, probably more securely than the
daughter dreamed It might even be that
the spider made playthings of the father
and daughter, who fondly imagined that
they had some influence over the old
tiger Yes    She had been on
the Chameleon as a guest of Merton
Scragg

  Her pleasure was the pleasure of the
man of steel In time he might tire of
it Now would be a test of the genuine-
ness of his affection—if he really had any
—for the Flardings

  “ Well  ” said Philip monotonously
He had little hope or cheer in his heart

  “ I know what you are thinking,” she
said “ You are remembering what the
world thinks of Mr Scragg You have
heard that he is mean, mercenary, and
merciless But there is another side to
that man, Philip, and I have seen it Per-
haps you will see it, too

  “ It is now one o’clock, Philip You
have time to go to his office in Wall
Street Put the case clearly before him
You need not speak of me if you do not
wish to Tell him about the treasure
You have the ruby pin, and I will give
you the string of pearls Ask him to
give you time

  “Talk business to him, and then come
back to me— Come to-morrow morning
You have done much to-day—and so have
I Whatever the result is, think well to-
night and come to me to-morrow morn-
ing”

  “ I see,” he said “ You are determined
to save me some way or other I am to
owe you my life”

  “ I am fighting for my own, she reit-
erated “I am trying to rouse in you
that sense of honor of which you are so
proud”

  “ Very well,” said Philip, “ but before
I let you make a sacrifice for me, I wish
to help myself Will you promise that
you will not speak to your father or com-
municate with Merton Scragg—at least,
until I have seen him and received his
answer ”

  “ I promise,” she said, holding out her
hand “ Good-by just now, Philip Go
quickly, for time is precious”

  A few minutes later he was going down-
town As he went, he puzzled much  but
mainly over the fact that Verina had been
very cool in her parting with him She
was a strange woman in some ways, he
reflected He remembered how cold-
blooded she had seemed aboard the Cha-
meleon when she had said: “ Wihat are
you going to do after I leave you at New
York”

  And now— But perhaps her seeming
cold-bloodedness was merely cool-blood-

edness in emergency Some women are
like that

  Merton Seragg’s chief clerk looked
curiously at Philip as the visiting-card
recalled the young man’s identity He
hurried into his employer’s private office
and as hurriedly came out again

   “ Mr Scragg says, will you step in at
once, sir ” said the chief clerk

  The iron-faced, rigid man received
Philip with a repelling stare

  “ Be seated, Mr 'Sand 1 am groping
in my mind for the reason of this unex-
pected visit,” said he coldly

  “ I have not come to ask any favor,”
Philip said, a little warmly “ I merely
wish to put you in possession of certain
facts which might bring you regret if you
discovered them after—”

  “ Exactly,” said Merton Scragg “ You
find that your bargain was a rash one
You have found life of more importance
than money, Mr Sand You have come
to put me in possession of certain facts
which may carry so much responsibility
that the burden of the affair will rest
upon me”

  “ I will not permit you, Mr Scragg—”
began Philip hotly but the lean, raw-
boned financier waved his hand impa-
tiently

  “ One moment! ” he snapped “ I have
not finished If you object to what I may
say in my own office, you have the right
to leave it I bear no ill feeling toward
you, sir but I wish to freshen your mem-
ory

  “ A year ago you came to me and bor-
rowed twenty thousand dollars upon your
insurance policies, assuring me that the
best specialist in the city had given you
only a year to live I expressly asked
you—three times I think—what security
'would be mine against the contingency of
your not dying We did not go into pain-
ful details, but you assured me that yoli
would be dead I warned you Mr Sand,
that life was sweet—even to an old man
like myself—neither blessed with youth,
great health, or popularity

   “ After consideration, I loaned you the
money, for I understood tli“e position in
which you were placed To me it was a
perfectly legitimate transaction More
than that, I perceived that I might be
doing some good in making the last year
of your life pleasant

  “ You will recall that it was I who
objected to your placing the understood
stipulation upon paper not because, as I
perhaps led you to think, that I realized
the incriminating nature of such a doc-
ument, but because I foresaw that, if by
any chance you regained your health or
tired of your bargain, you would come
begging at the end of three hundred and
sixty-five days—as you have done! ”

  “ You are quite in error, Mr Scragg,”
said Philip, his coolness regained, al-
though his heart was like molten lead
“ My honor has suffered none at the pros-
pect of death to-morrow I—”

  “ That is what I supposed at the time
—that you were a man of strict honor—
as your father was before you,” said
Scragg but his eyes were fixed curiously
on the young man’s face, and he was
thinking of Philip’s last words So the
voung man contemplated suicide, after
all!

  “ Had I come to the end of the allotted
days, with no hope of continued life,”
said Philip, “ or without the means or
any prospect of paying back to you the
money which I borrowed on my life, I
should, not be here As it is, I am here
to make a proposition which you are at
liberty to accept or decline, without any
further discussion of it”

  “You overlook one point, Mr Sand,”
said Scragg with forbidding iciness “ I
must’ either accept any proposition you
may make, or take upon my shoulders the
guilt of what a moral world might call
by an ugly name—murder, Mr Sand”
Philip knew that this was a truth He
hung his head, and there was silence,
broken only by the tapping of Merton
Scragg’s lean fingers on the clesk-top

  “ But,” said the miser, “ you may pro-
ceed, Mr Sand, for possibly your prop-
osition may be such that I may be able to
accept it I assure you that, no matter
what you may know or think of my char-
acter, I should be very pleased to dodge
a painful issue All I want is—my pound
of flesh, Mr Sand” The man smiled, al-
most pathetically “ You see,” he added,
“ I have a reputation to sustain in Wall
Street Now let me hear what you have
to propose”

  “ I ask for thirty days’ grace,” said
Philip, “ and for an extension of one
month in my charter of the yacht Chame-
36

leon, which, I have every reason to be-
lieve, is your property”

  Merton Scragg glanced quickly at the
younger man, but he betrayed nothing of
the effect the remark may have had upon
him When he spoke his tone was as
icily severe and quite as businesslike as
ever

  “ There is nothing to warrant your rea-
son or belief that I am thfe owner of the
Chameleon,” he stated “ I am, however,
a personal friend of her owner, Mr
Harding—Mr Frederick Harding, to
whom, I believe, you are indebted for
your rescue But for my acquaintance
with Mr Harding I should find it rather
difficult to understand what you are talk-
ing about A chameleon, I believe, is a
lizard that changes color with circum-
stances There are human chameleons,
Mr Sand,” he added, with the ghost of a
smile

  Philip hardly heard the sarcasm He
was thinking over that matter of the
yacht’s ownership He began to see
light Verina’s father, he remembered,
was “ under obligation ” to Mr Scragg
Plarding was probably the owner, but
only in name

  The Chameleon, and perhaps all of
Harding’s worldly goods, were mortgaged
to Merton Scragg The skinflint admit-
ted an acquaintance The fact that Ve-
rina had been a “ guest ” of Scragg did
not necessarily mean that the Wall Street
Shylock had ever been the host in bodily
presence Yes, it was Verina’s way of
expressing a bitter truth, and — Miss
Sharpe had uttered her warning, “ Ve-
rina! ”	<

  “ Why don’t you marry the girl ? ” was
Scragg’s way of breaking the stillness that
had fallen in the skinflint’s office

  For a moment the silence seemed inten-
sified Philip could hardly believe his
ears What had the man just said

  “ Why don’t I marry the girl  ” he
echoed “Marry—what girl”

  For a moment the disloyal thought came
to him that Verina had—perhaps out of
sheer desperation and the desire to save
him—broken her promise

  “ Harding’s daughter,” said Scragg,
looking at him keenly “ She has plenty
of money To marry her would seem
poetic justice after the romance of the
island There is some poetry in my life,

Mr Sand Also, it would be a solution
of your difficulties”

  “ I have no intention of making use of
any woman’s love, or any woman’s money,
as a way out of my obligations,” said
Philip coldly “ How did you know—
of all this ”

  Merton Scragg picked up an afternoon
newspaper In bold liead-lines on the
front page Philip saw the words:

REVUELAN—FOUNDERED—
SURVIVORS!

  “ Pearce has leaked — as usual,” was
Philip’s inward reflection “Well” he
said to Scragg

  For a moment Shylock regarded the
younger man searchingly

  “ The world expects it, of course,” said
he incisively “Why not”

  “ Mr Scragg,” said Philip loftily, “ I
have nothing to say on the subject, ex-
cept what I have already said, that I
cannot consider taking the advantage of-
fered me”

  “ Docs the girl fancy you” inquired
Scragg bluntly—almost coarsely

  “ That,” said Philip sharply, “ is none
of your business, and I shall trouble you
to keep the matter off your mercenary
tongue”

  Scragg merely smiled “ Very well,”
said he, “ you will not blame me if I de-
mand a pound of flesh from your own re-
sources when you so carelessly flout what
Providence offers you What was your
proposition ”

  “ My proposition,” said Philip, “ en-
tails a revisal of that story” He indi-
cated the newspaper article, and proceed-
ed to tell the tale of the wreck, the
landing, the treasure, and all that fol-
lowed

  Scragg listened with an impassive face
although once, when Philip spoke of the
retreat from the golden hut, his eyes
brightened and he looked at Sand

  “ You gave up a fabulous treasure for
the sake of—a woman  ” he queried curi-
ously

  Philip ignored the remark and contin-
ued his tale “ The treasure,” he con-
cluded, “ lies in that channel I could
almost mark off the spot on a chart All
I need is thirty days, the yacht, and a
diver or two”
TREASURE OF THE WORLD

    “ I see, said Scragg finally “ You do
  not wish to die, Mr Sand

    For the life of him, Philip could not
  make out whether the man was uttering
  a sarcasm or not The financier’s face
  was immobile Only his eyes glowed with
  a peculiar flame

    “ I do not,” confessed Philip  “ not
  because I am afraid to die although I
  would prefer that I could die naturally
  But life has taken a new meaning from
  circumstances Will you grant my re-
  quest ”

   Merton Scragg tapped on the table
' with his fingers and lookell keenly
through the window at the tops of the
city’s buildings Presently he said :

    “ I will be frank with you, Mr Sand
  I put no faith in treasure schemes I
  have never heard of a treasure expedition
  which found treasure, except in cheap lit-
  erature Also, I cannot give you the
  yacht You had better see Mr Frederick
  Harding on that point

    “If he consents, then—I will consider
 the matter In fact, you have placed me
 in such a position that I dare not with-
 hold my consent I feared that it would
 come to this You—”

    “ One moment, Mr Scragg,” protested
 Philip “ I will not listen to any such
 talk I have not come to beg If your
 common sense—if your decency does not
 urge you to see the wisdom of my course,
 then I can leave this office now, and the
 rest—remains with me”

    “ Then go,” said Scragg coolly “ You
 should not have come to me It is none
 of my business but you have until noon
 to-morrow You can do as you please,
 because I have no power over you, thanks
 to myself

    “ You can obtain the yacht and sail in
  defiance of me and what is due me But
  I am loath to be responsible for your
  death—directly responsible, when it is in
  my power to present you with your life
  at a cos£ of twenty thousand dollars to
  myself I have worked hard, Mr Sand,
  for every penny I have

    “ I value my rights They are all a
 man has in a world that cannot, or will
 not live without money battle” He
 stopped abruptly Presently he waved his
 hand

    “ Go now, young man You have until
 noon to-morrow But before you do any-

thing rash—call me on the telephone It
might be that I may yet agree to be
robbed”

       CHAPTER XIX
       The Debt Is Paid

TDHILIP awoke next morning with a
A headache Strictly speaking, he did
not awake He merely opened his eyes,
looked at his watch, and decided that the
day had sufficiently advanced for him to
get up and run the last lap of human af-
fairs

  He had not slept His mind had trav-
eled down the oiled groove of the line of
least resistance—the descent of which is
so easy, and so uncontrollable once the
mind has been launched upon it

  And it was so easy The solution of
the difficulty was so broad and simple and
inviting, and the point of honor involved
so delicate, so thin, so imperceptible to
all but the finer sort of soul

  All night he had dreamed of Merton
Scragg’s own words—as if Shylock were
the tempting devil himself:

  “ You can do as you please, because I
have no power over you, thanks to my-
self You can obtain the yacht and sail
in defiance of me and what is due me”

  It was a strong temptation — just to
take French leave for thirty days, regain
the treasure, pay Scragg his twenty thou-
sand dollars, plus a liberal interest and
probably in the end the skinflint would
be better pleased At present Scragg only
feared for his money—his investment

  And that was just where the blood of
old Philander Sand arose in rebellion
The house of Sand had made its quon-
dam fortune by methods unquestionable
The name of Philander Sand on paper
made that paper as a bond

  The pride of Sand arose in arms against
any subterfuge in the payment of a note
fallen due True, it was for everybody’s
best interest that thirty days’ grace should
be granted But the holder of that fig-
urative note wanted his money, and the
principle of Philander Sand whispered in
Philip’s heart-blood:

  “ You backed the note, my son You
must pay the fiddler”

  He dressed — wearily His eyelids
seemed to be filled with grittiness His
38

lips were sticky, as if he had been drink-
ing sweet wines the night before His
temples were hot and his senses were
strangely dulled

  He could think no more He cared no
more He was just sorry—sorry for him-
self, sorry that he had ever visited Mer-
ton Scragg, sorry for Verina, but too tired
of mental debating to feel any great pang

  To-day was — the day of execution
This was the three hundred and sixty-
fifth day At noon the matter must be
settled for good and all There was no
doubt in his mind that it would, be set-
tled—one way or another If it was not
settled one way, it would be settled—
the other way

  He looked at his watch It was eight
o’clock The watch was ticking with mo-
notonous regularity So many ticks, and
it would be nine—ten—eleven—noon!
Then it would be all over and—the watch
would still be ticking, whether the little
timekeeper in his own breast was still or
not

  He had three hopes left, and surely one
of them would save the situation Scragg
might relent of his own volition—Philip
was determined that he should not again
apply for extension Verina might de-
vise some scheme, even if he himself did
not accept her money as a thirty days’
loan—his mind revolted even at that And
the third chance was the one which is
ever present in the most precarious of sit-
uations—the something which may turn
up

  One queer idea came into his head It
did not seem queer at first—indeed, it
seemed perfectly feasible and sensible
He might go to some acquaintance—and
he had a few who were moneyed men—
and tell him the story of the treasure,
borrowing twenty thousand dollars, plus
interest, on the enterprise, which would
see the gold raised and converted into
cash But who would believe his tale of
the mortgage on his life, even if he told
it And he felt that he had no right to
reveal that which was Merton Scragg’s
secret as well as his own

  Merton Scragg had served him while
serving himself It would be dishonor-
able to tell of the transaction just because
he himself was sorry for his side of the
bargain

  And if he did not reveal the reason for

haste, it was hardly likely that in a few
hours he could convince even an intimate
acquaintance that the treasure story was
true and get twenty thousand dollars on
its vague promise

  When lie was ready for the street
Philip paused a moment to plan his ac-
tions First, he must see Verina and tell
her of his interview with Merton Scragg
Then he must see Verina’s father and
ask him for the loan of his yacht If he
got it, lie must then telephone Merton
Scragg and— Perhaps the miser would
agree

  But Scragg would probably yield He
had said' that he would be loath to be re-
sponsible for Philip’s death He had
said that he might agree to be robbed
Philip’s pride was struggling within him
He was questioning his right to place
Scragg in the position of “ permitting
himself to be robbed ”—and that was how
Scragg felt about it The only other
course was to fulfil his bargain and—be-
fore noon

  “ Anyhow, I have four hours,” said
Philip to himself in the glass He looked
a little pale, but far from being a suitable
subject for an undertaker “ I will see
Verina I owe it to her, and I promised

  The truth that was knocking at his
heart was this:

  “ I am a drowning man I love life
I am weak If she offers me a straw,
though I may not clutch at it, I would
like to feel that it is within my reach”

  When he arrived at the house in the
Bronx he was a little disappointed that
Verina did not at once see him The
housekeeper, an elderly woman with an
aggrieved face, said that she was dress-
ing, adding the gratuitous remark that it
was still very early in the day

  Philip was hurt There were some
things about Verina he could not under-
stand Wras she so selfish that she could
not appreciate how precious every minute
of that forenoon must be to Philip, if not
to her Was it possible that her men-
tality was of that sort which moves
around only one thing at one time, the
kind that weeps at the tragedy and for-
gets at the curtain

  She kept him fully half an hour Then
she came into the room with her hand
outstretched in a formal welcome

  “ I pray you will accept my apology
TREASURE OF THE WORLD

39

for this untimely call,” said Philip, with
just a tinge of reproach and bitterness

   “ I had ftot expected you so earl)',” she
said coolly “ Well, what did Mr Scragg
say ”

  Her tone was so cool and indifferent
that Philip felt wounded to his very soul

  “ Are you—are you really interested
to know  ” he asked laboriously

   “ Philip,” she said, with a smile, “ you
are a very foolish boy Perhaps you will
soon know just how much interested I am
and have been in your behalf”

  “ You have not spoken to your father
or to Merton Scragg”

  “To Mr Scragg—no I promised you
I would not When my father came to
dinner last night I said I wished to have
a long talk with him in the study I told
him”

  “ And—”

  “ He is at home to-day, and I think it
would be better if you and he talked it
over together Fie is very sympathetic,
Philip”

   “ I am glad of that,” said Philip dazed-
ly “ I need some help—from a man I
would like to talk to him”

  “ But what of Scragg ”

  “ Scragg I am afraid the man is im-
possible There is not a grain of senti-
ment in his composition I made matters
worse by going to him He treated me as
if I were a beggar I will admit that he
left the matter open for consideration
but his decision, even at its favorable best,
will be a hard nut for me to swallow Fie
told me that your father, Verina, owned
the Chameleon, and that— By the way,
you told me Merton Scragg owned it”

  “ My father owns it,” said Verina sim-
ply

  There came a sound of footsteps creak-
ing on an old wooden staircase over the
hall The door of the drawing-room pres-
ently opened and Merton Scragg stood in
the portal

  “ Philip,” said Verina tremulously,'
“ this is my father Do you see now how
good God has been to us”

  Philip sat down on a chair and stared
at the figure in the doorway

  “ Mr Scragg,” said he, although the
face of the man was cast in a softer, more
human mold than that of the tiger of
Wall Street He might have been
Scragg’s twin brother

  “ No, Mr Sand,” said the old man gen-
tly, “ my name is Frederick Harding—
here! ”

  It took a few seconds for the last word
to sink into Philip’s dazed intelligence
Then it all came back to him in a vivid
flashlight panorama Merton Scragg was
Frederick Harding Frederick Flarding
was Merton Scragg Yet the two men
were as different as cheese and chocolate

  There was some one kneeling by Phil-
ip’s side A little warm hand was trem-
bling in his and a little voice was whis-
pering :

  “ Philip — Philip It’s all right
Everything’s all right Don’t you under-
stand ”

  Philip did—partly But he could say
nothing He was trying to identify the
white-haired, thin-faced old gentleman in
the doorway with the gaunt, iron-jawed
Shylock of the Wall Street office

  “ Philip Sand,” said Frederick Hard-
ing “ This is my house, and when a
guest is introduced to his host I believe
custom requires that he stand up, even if
he does not shake hands Shake hands,
my boy”

  Philip got up He was conscious that
he was being led forward by some one
who held his left hand FI is right hand
he extended mechanically, still with his
eyes fixed on the kind eyes of Verina’s
father

  “ Listen to me, young man,” said Hard-
ing in a paternal way “ You needn’t
think your wits have deserted you You
are not seeing ghosts I am Merton
Scragg, right enough, but not here I
am taking a holiday to-day—the first I
have taken in years, barring Sundays

  “ You are one of the few men who
know my secret Down there ” — he
frowned—“ I am what I am—a man of
business, fighting for the peace and hap-
piness which I keep locked up here Up
here I am Frederick Harding—Merton
Scragg is the only amusement I ever per-
mitted myself in business—and my little
girl ail'd I are very happy together”

  “A kind of Jekyll and Hyde” stam-
mered Philip

  “ Not exactly,” laughed the old gen-
tleman “ But 1 think I know what you
mean Everybody is more or less of a
Jekyll and Hyde or a Harding rfnd
Scragg The only difference in my case
40

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

is that I am a creature of pronounced
views

  “ My business is my business, and I am
what my business has compelled many a
man to be — a hardened fighter, with
mercy to none and asking no quarter
My private life is what I think a man’s
private life should be—something devoid
of the miseries of the outside world

  “ Sit down, my boy,” said he, smiling
still “ Miss' Harding,” he added with
mock severity, •“ I did not ask you to sit
down beside him”

  There was a long pause The old man
was regarding the young people with a
sad but happy smile

  “ I am very pleased with you two
Philip, my little girl told me last night
that she loved you very much I know
that you love her I knew it yesterday in
my—in Mr Scragg’s office You see, I
had been reading the newspapers Be-
sides that, I heard your story eleven
months ago when my little girl was re-
stored to me And so,” he said curious-
ly, “ you let the blackguards take away a
million in gold for the sake of — a
woman ”

  Philip started a little It was as if he
was in Scragg’s office again, only the
Scragg who stood before him was very
strangely transformed Now he under-
stood it all

  “ But T owe you twenty thousand dol-
lars,” said Philip stupidly

  “ No, you don’t,” said Frederick Hard-
ing quietly “ Your debts are paid in
full I did not bargain for your life, my
boy I bargained for your money All
you have in the world is fifty thousand
dollars in insurance, and I believe that
by your will it belongs to me

  “ I have given that will to my daugh-
ter, to whom I presume it would naturally
be your intention to leave your earthly
possessions You see, young man, I in-
sist upon your marrying my daughter
Propriety demands it”

  Philip stared at the old man Then
his eyes slowly filled with tears He
could not utter a word, but the little hand
stole back into his and nestled there as-
suringly Harding, knowing that which
takes the iron out of a man’s self-control,
went on talking tactfully:

  “ I admire your pride, Philip I ad-

(The

mire still more your manhood and your
sense of honor I could have found it in
my heart to tell you everything in the
office yesterday when you told me to keep
the matter of your love-affair off my mer-
cenary tongue My heart was made hap-
py right there The man who could re-
sist a beautiful woman and her money
when his life was at stake is—the kind of
man I would like to see my little girl’s
husband

   “ The yacht, by the way, is Mr Hard-
ing’s and, as you have his permission to
use it, perhaps you might go treasure-
hunting around that island You can’t
have too-much money in this world, my
boy but nobody knows better than'you
that it isn’t everything Verina tells me
that she would like to go back and get
the breadfruit out of the fire”

   For a moment Philip was at a loss to
interpret this queer speech, but suddenly
it dawned upon him The yacht was his
Shylock was satisfied His life was his
Verina was his Plealth was his' Now
he was to go treasure-hunting again with
Verina to help him find it, with Verina to
help him roast breadfruit on that partic-
ular hilltop

   He held out his hand in silence He
was too happy to utter a word Through
a haze he saw Shylock with an amused,
contented smile on his rugged face, and
heard his voice say:

  “ Now I must get down-town All
play and no work makes a fool of Jack”

  Ten minutes later Merton Scragg was
traveling down-town in the street-car line
which he owned The conductor, taking
the fares, passed by the man, who picked
up a castaway newspaper and became im-
mersed in it

   Back in the old Colonial house, which
was hedged in by new tenements, Philip
Sand was staring before him There was
a woman on her knees before him, and
her face was buried in his hands Pres-
ently an old grandfather’s clock in some
other part of the house began to dole out
the long-drawn strokes of the noon-hour
Philip Sand started

   “ Verina! ” he exclaimed

   “ Philip,” she whispered, and her arms
stole up around his shoulders “ Kiss
me—but don’t say anything for a little
while”

A Woman at the Key

BY EVA M RICHARDS

WE find women in every phase of commercial life nowadays—even in
railroading But Miss Richards, who spent some time as operating
express-agent, and in other capacities, in a little way-station out
West, advises women to keep out of that part of the game, and she gives
some pretty good reasons why When she started in she was satisfied to be
a mere cog in a great system, but she made herself more useful than orna-
mental, and soon became a Lady Pooh-Bah in her little sphere

Thrilling Experiences of a Young Woman Who Did Most Everything,
from Feeding a Wrecked Crew to Chasing Boes
Down the

fT had always been my wish to be
part of the great wheel of
business I had studied tel-
egraphy a short time, and had
► had a short experience in sta-
tion work, but when I was
offered the position of station-agent and
telegraph-operator at a small station on
the Chicago and North-Western Railway,
I promptly accepted

No queen on her throne was ever hap-
pier than I when I first wrote my name
as agent for the company And I pity
him who has never felt the exhilaration
of responsibility

Doing business over one’s own signa-
ture is quite a different matter from doing
it over another’s But strength and cour-
age are generally near us when we are
in need of them, and they have never
failed me

Except the clerical work in the general
offices there is no branch of railroad work
for which a woman is physically fitted
The reasons are numerous The long,
uncertain hours, exposure to climatic
changes, strain on the nervous system,
and the necessity of always being ready
to stand one’s ground in the face of un-
expected and most difficult circumstances

  “ Ready for an emergency,” “ Prepared
for the unexpected,” should be brand-
ed on every would-be railway employee
Hardly a day passes that does not bring
some unthought-of proposition, when one
acts without hesitation

  The station in which I was installed as
agent and operator was in a small town,
but being the shipping-point for a rich
stock and agricultural district it was a
busy point, and I soon became well ac-
quainted

Multitudinous Duties

  When it was possible, I hired a man or
boy to attend to the outside work, but
more often this was impossible Then I
surely did the work of a man

  In the years I associated with railway
men they treated me with the greatest re-
spect, and I can truly say of them that
they are a class of men with big hearts,
and always ready to do a kindness

  I was also postmistress and express-
agent, so had my fingers on the keys of
the town’s government, express, and rail-
way business At seven in the morning
I was due at the office, when I sent
my first report to the division train-des-
patcher and from then until the last train
at night, no-matter how late, my work was
before me

   An agent of such a station cannot be the
steel figure of the city Pie must not only
be polite, but neighborly with the towns-
people and those from the country Every
newcomer must be gracefully welcomed
and every old one honored

  The admonition of the photographed to
“ look pleasant ” is always needed by the
agent One old lady, who took the train
quite frequently at this station, often
asked me to make a cup of tea for her
She usually arrived at the station at least
five hours before train-time and, when
she was not drinking my tea and eating
crackers, she was knitting socks and smo-
king an extremely odoriferous corn-cob
pipe

Private Secretary to Farmers

  After the telephones were installed
throughout the country, I acted as private
secretary to most every shipper in that
country I was often called upon t<=» write

an order for harness or similar articles for
a farmer These orders usually came just
about train - time The shippers appre-
ciated this assistance because there was no
charge They appreciated my efforts for
them, though they never deluged me with
storms of gratitude

  Of all the mail which I handled, I
think the following “ forward,” as the
writer called it, merits a place in English
literature I was asked -by the writer to
“ look it over,” hence my knowledge of
the contents:

    My der gurl this fur all rite seems
  a age sence i see yer be back sun as pus-
  ible yer own lover A1 rite more nex
  time so gud-by little blue ies and pink
  teth—you no what that lin is A1 agin.

  I presume the line stood for an affec-
tionate demonstration of his ardent af-
fections, and “ A1 agin ” meant that he
was still A1 and not an alligator

  Shipping a first consignment has been
to some people their Waterloo I dis-
tinctly remember a horse that was brought
to the station for shipment The con-
signer had never shipped an ounce of
freight in his life, and was duly excited
about the performance

Milk for the Crew

  The box car was not right in front of
the stock-chute, so I told him to push it
there with the aid of the pinch-bar This
he refused to do, and insisted upon load-
ing from the depot He improvised a
bridge by laying boards from the platform
to the car, then led the horse up the steps
into the car, I going before, coaxing the
animal with an ear of corn

  It has often been necessary for me to
stand on boxes in order to seal cars, and
I have moved empty cars with the aid of
the pinch-bar There is little work about
a station that I have not done, even to
dodging hoboes

  One evening the freight was coming
down the line, running on a smooth stretch
of track, when, without any apparent
cause, three of the loaded cars were off
the track, lying on their sides. These
cars were loaded with shelled corn, so the
spill may be easily pictured

  The conductor and brakemen were in
the “ lookout ” at the time, and graphic-

HIS BARK AND GROWL COMPENSATED FOR HIS LACK OF SIZE

ally told me they found themselves at the
other end of the caboose on their faces,
but expected to be in paradise

  The crew came to the station to report,
and asked if I could furnish them supper
My sister said we could; but, when she
went to the ice-chest to see if there was
sufficient milk and cream, she found the
same condition that confronted Mother
Hubbard

A 1 x 2 Dog

  Seeing a herd of cows grazing by the
roadside, I called a boy to get us the nec-
essary supply He did his best for us;
but found it difficult, as it was fly-time,
and I think he did most of the milking
walking about the lane with the cows
After supper the crew went back to work,
and I sat at my desk, taking and sending
orders until the next day My sister kept
me company, occupying an improvised
couch of empty egg-cases

  All the time I was in this office I had a
most ardent admirer and protector in
Jack, my one-by-two dog. His bark and
growl compensated for his lack of size,
and he frightened more than one Weary
Willie by attaching himself to a trouser-
leg

  One Willie came into the office and,
with a savage cast of face, said : “ That
dog bit me, and now I will have cholera-
morbus rabies”

  Jack was very fond of the trains and
crews, much to my discomfort, until an
engineer sent a great cloud of steam at
him and a conductor pulled his tail

  From that time, if he was lying on the
platform and heard a whistle five miles
away, he would run for his life into the
office Many is the way-bill he has torn
into bits for me, one in particular, which
covered a shipment from La Crosse Go-
ing into the office, I found the little fellow
sitting in the ticket-windovv, having a fine
time throwing bits of pink paper about
Not an inch of the bill was left

  I wrote to the agent at La Crosse, ask-
ing for a duplicate, and when I received
it, across its face in bold letters was writ-
ten : “ Either tie up your dog or give him
to a circus”

One Lantern—Two Globes.

  The passing of a circus through our

office, consequently 1 had no sema-
phores or other devices with which to
give signals, save one lantern and two
globes, one red and one white. But
these did the work satisfactorily

  Very few persons realize the respon-
sibility that is connected with the opera-
tion of trains They enjoy the excellence
of the service from the ballast road-bed
to the electric-lighted padded berth They
frequently notice the whistling of the en-
gine and the stopping of the train, but

enough to express the tortures through
which I passed when I received my first
train order Had it not been for the
kindness of that conductor I too might
have piped my swan song I have the
original yet, which reads:

 Baraboo—To C. & E., No. 125 N.:

   No One hundred twenty-five (125),
  Murphey, can have until eleven forty,
  11:40 am, to go to Ipswich, against
  No one hundred twenty (120), Reales.
  No 120 gets this at Ipswich, 12.

THERE NEVER WAS A COUNTY FAIR WITHOUT THEM

what this means they do not know But
the men at the telegraph key and the
throttle know

  A small sheet of yellow tissue paper
is an insignificant looking article, but
Upon it depends the safety of lives as they
span rivers, cross prairies, and crawl up
mountainsides This yellow sheet con-
tains the train orders which govern the
movement of a train, and which is the
young operator’s test of ability and
courage—and often his swan song.

  A rule appears simple until we at-
tempt to harness and put it into use
So it is with learning about train orders
and the delivery of such

  I have never found words strong

  After the delivery of that order I
 felt that I would succumb to nervous
 prostration

 During these five minutes my wires
were silent, and looking up the track we
could see the motionless passenger-train
which had just left the station I do
not remember seeing a smile on the face
of a_railroad man during that sad week
My Chicago daily paper reached me at
eight in the morning, and every morn-
ing of that week I read it aloud to the
section men and neighbors as they gath-
ered in the depot, and every day we grew
sadder and sadder

Off for a Picnic

   If one has never seen a crowd of peo-
ple board a train for the county fair, he
has missed one of the best bits of human
comedy The crowd gathers from all
parts of the country—old men and wom-
en, young mothers carrying little bundles
of life carefully wrapped in shawls,
youthful lovers and their girls on their
first trip away from home; the little
girl with a rubber cutting her little throat
in order to keep her hat on the back of
her head; the growing boy with the
small felt hat turned up to give a good
view of his freckles, and old young men,
known as sports, who are regular attend-
ants at every fair

   These old chaps usually wear a bright

tie, a rubber collar large enough for
two necks, a stiff hat on the side of the
head, and a ring bearing a stone the size
of a quarter-of-a-dollar Their clothes
are of goodly proportions and fit the
frame as if thrown at it Their shoes
are of a perfect dust color

   These captains of leisure usually carry
either a cane or whip There was never
a county fair without them

  When they come straggling from the

It's Work We Love

  To one unaccustomed to the clocklike
routine of railroad work, the charm
which attends it is unknown But to
one who has received a “ G N,” or relief
from duty, who tunes his ear to the
heavy whistle of an approaching train or
the resounding clang of the bell, feels
the irresistibility of the charm

  There is nothing more welcome than
a delayed train, one for which one has
waited hours The trains on the divi-
sion on which I was employed were
more often late than 011 time during the
winter Despite the snow-fences which
hugged, the right-of-way, the snow would
persist in filling the numerous cuts, mak-
ing progress slow, sometimes impossible
until the plows and dangers would make
their missionary visits

  At such times, the most welcome thing
on the face of the earth was the train,
and I held its engine in deep esteem, as
it came puffing in, its light piercing
the gloaming, its long black plume of
smoke waving in the keen air, its back
blanketed with snow and its flanks
fringed with icicles

  When it stopped it seemed to breathe
heavily and then to sigh Then with re-
newed strength, with its drivers silhou-
etted in the red light of the open furnace,
it snorted and moved on

  Then I banked my fire for the night,
reported the train, received “ G N,” cut
out the wire, locked the door and hurried
home, tired and happy, until the dawn of
another dav
THE SONG OF THE WIRES

         BY OTIS M SISSON

       Written for “The Railroad Man’s Magazine”

         HERE’S a message of death on the wires to-

    I	night,

         For they ceaselessly throb and moan

         P For they ceaselessly mourn like a soul that is
                    lost

    In a quavering, minor tone

      Far off in the darkness T hear it come

         Faint and soft it sounds

      Nearer it speeds with the pulsing beat
         Of a wrought heart’s leaps and bounds

    It comes like a shriek from the depths of space,

        A quivering, anguished cry—

      Oh! surely some soul is forever lost,

        And forever alone must fly

      It goes like the sigh of a parting breeze

        And dies, like a sigh, away

      But to return in the rising gusts
         The saddest of sad chords- play

      There’s a message of death on the wires to-night—
         Hark! how they sob and moan

      And a soul somewhere in the farthest space
         Is winging its way—alone
DUGAN’S PAL GOES DIPPY

                                  (“E Florence”)

          The Book-Agent Tries To Get in a Few Words
          During the Recital of Archie’s Love - Affair

Igr Y friend,” said the book-
agent to Dugan, “ I
I irW « would like to interest
LJVwl you in a work that
should be in the hands
of every thinker A
work that will raise your standard of
efficiency, no matter what your calling
may be”

  “ Say, sport,” replied Dugan, “ no
doubt you have sincere convictions as to
the value of your indispensable work, for
the brooklike flow of your language
would lead me to infer that you have, at
least, mastered your circular letter of in-
structions but when you speak of stand-
ard of efficiency, I would like to inform
you that old man Hinchman looks out
for that and the man that can’t keep
the gage prognosticating a plethora of
steam gets ample time for the rigors of
social requirement”

  “True,” replied the book-agent “but
do you never aspire for a more exalted
position than the one you are now fill-
ing Ambition should be implanted in
every human breast, and every man
should endeavor to prepare himself for
advancement”

  “ Right you are, assented Dugan
“ but you don’t for the infinitesimal sub-
division of the unit of time imagine that
I don’t know anything but coal-heaving

  “ Why, man, it’s not knowledge, but
opportunity, that I am laying for It’s
true I’m feeding fuel to a mogul now,
but I’m ready to tackle any job along
the line—clean up to the presidency of
the road”

“ Are there never times when you wish
to refresh your memory on matters of a

technical nature” inquired the book-
agent “ The composition of the coal
you handle, the expansive power of steam,
the mechanical construction of the steam-
gage, or even the principle of the balance
escapement of your watch, are all sub-
jects of absorbing interest”

  “ Speaking of watches,” said Dugan,
“ reminds me of Archie Bruxton and so
long as you show a predilection for tell-
ing me all you know, I am going to re-
late this yarn to you It may not be of
material benefit to you, but its recital
may, in a sense, compensate you for the
loss of an order

  “ Archie gravitated to railroading by
divine instinct back in the eighties, at
which time I was swinging the scoop on
the Pennsy He was an innocent-looking
chap, with a caffy-o-lay complexion and
an unalloyed confidence in mankind

  “ He was unsoiled by contact with the
world, and was preeminently a child of
nature

  “ I cottoned to him at the start, on ac-
count of his unsophisticatedness, and in-
troduced him to the Medusa who ran the
Waldorf where I kept my steamer-trunk”
“ By reference to Medusa in this sub-
lime work,” interrupted the book-agent,
“ you will learn that the name was ap-
plied to Mary, Queen of Scots — 1 The
Gentle Medusa’ ”

  “Yes,” commented Dugan “but this
Medusa was ‘ Queen of the Micks’ Like-
wise, not gentle Well, to continue—one
evening Archie went out for a stroll, and
when he returned he proudly exhibited a
pawn-ticket for a watch, which he said he
had bought from a stranded railroad en-
gineer

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZIT'TE

  “ I uttered mental maledictions when
he told me the story, which is as old as
the hills, and cussed myself for letting
him loose in the night air without a nurse
Instinctively, I knew that some one had
handed him a prize specimen of the citrus
vulgaris

  “ He said he thought that a watch
which was good enough for a railroad
engineer must be a pretty good article at
timekeeping, and that’s just what the
party of the second part expected him to
think but you couldn’t expect Archie to
be wise to the wiles of the pawnbroker’s
runner”

  “ Are you aware of the origin of the
pawnbroker’s insignia” again inter-
rupted the book-agent “ By reference
to the proper subject in this mine of in-
formation, you will learn that the three
balls are the arms of the Medici family,
and refer to the exploit of Averardo de’
Medici, a commander under Charle-
magne, who slew the giant Mugello,
whose mace was fitted with three iron
balls”

  “ Sport,” replied Dugan, “ you may be
long on medieval history, but the accept-
ed interpretation of the sign of the three
brass balls is that it was the emblem of
the first pawnbroker—he who traveled in
the wake of the Crusaders, advancing
loans on their watches and scarf-pins,
and whose motto was ‘ In hock signo
vinces’ ”

  The book-agent attempted to dispute
this explanation of the erudite fireman,
but Dugan threw the gab-throttle over
and shot ahead

    Now, see here, pardner,” he cau-
tioned,  if you’re going to throw a switch
every few minutes, and run this fiction
limited onto a siding, we’ll never finish
on schedule

“Well, to get back on the main line,
Archie redeemed the watch the next day
by separating himself from eight forty
He showed it to me, that night, in the
cy of our boudoir

' It was one of those Swiss movement
affairs, reposing in a gold-filled round-
house, highly ornamented with bizarre
engravings As I sprung open the lid,
I was surprised to see the picture of a
handsome heroine, gazing soulfully at me

  “ ‘ Say, boy,’ I asked, 1 who’s vour lady
friend5

  “ Archie blushed like a girl caught in
the act of concealing her age

  “ ‘ The picture was in the watch when
I got it,’ he replied

  “ ‘ She’s a beauty, all right,’ I com-
mented ‘ I wonder who she is’

  “ 1 Wish I knew,’ said Archie soulfully

  “ 1 See here, kid,’ I cautioned, 1 don’t
you go getting spongy on a fictitious fe-
male You are too young to indulge in
affinities or soul-mates’ ”

  “ The article on affinities in this mag-
nificent work,” interrupted the book-
agent, “ abound in reference to the cele-
brated affinities of history—”

  “ Hold on,” protested Dugan “ I
ain't interested I ain’t no blooming
monastic Abelard nor no pugilistic Paris
When a man does his love-making in the
spotlight, you can bet your sesterces that
the divorce court is getting ready for ex-
ecutive session

  “ I warned Archie to be ,careful in
diagnosing his symptoms Told him that
the symptoms of love and a predispo-
sition to hepatic disturbance were often
confounded He protested that he was
heart whole, but, like the lad)-, he did
protest too much  and I realized that he
was squarely hit

  “ During the days ihat followed, I
caught him frequently gazing at the
photo of his inamorata as though it was
a twenty-dollar gold piece

  “ One day he came home and told me
that he had run across the buccaneer who
had sold him the ticket This time he
happened to be a stranded sailor, who
had smuggled in some diamonds which
he wanted to,sell

  “ Archie chided him for leaving the
honorable calling of railroad engineer
and taking up with dissolute sailors
When the fellow professed ignorance of
the railroad business, Archie showed him
the watch and asked him whether he
didn't remember selling him the ticket
for it

  “ Then, suddenly, this Jekyll - Hyde
character remembered all about the watch
incident When Archie questioned him
as to the identity of the woman in the
case, lie laughed, and explained how the
game was worked Then he examined
the watch, and told Archie that it was
of a make that had been handled by a
mail-order house in Chicago exclusively
DUGAN’S PAL

       

  “ He suggested that Archie write them,
giving the number of the case and also of
the works, and possibly they could inform
him as to whom it had been sold Archie
thought it was a capital idea

  “ I tried to dissuade him from acting
recklessly, but I hadn’t stopped to con-
sider that the foolish flier always travels
on a clear track Archie was traveling on
the matrimonial limited, and he ignored
my signals and tore ahead on down grade
to destruction

  “He sent off his inquiry, and in due
time the answer came that the watch had
been sold to one Antoine Picard, at South
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania”

  “ You may not be aware,” commented
the book-agent, “ that the name Beth-,
lehem has been given to upward of one
hundred towns and villages By refer-
ence to this vade viecinn of information,
you may—”

  “ Hold on, sport Put on the air,”
cautioned Dugan “ From the way you
interfere, one might imagine you was
playing talk-back in a football game
When you started to run wild, I was try-
ing to impart the information that Archie
got busy and indited an epistle to the
Bethlehemite with the Quartier Latin
name, and asked him whether he had ever
owned the watch

  “ He got an answer stating that the
watch had been stolen from him about a
year back, and offered Archie a reward
for its return

  “ The answer transported Archie to
the haven of happiness, and he squan-
dered some more real money for postage
to inform that Gallic Bethlehemite that
he wouldreturn the watch in return for
some definite information about the orig-
inal of the photo in the case

  “ Picard came back with a proposition
that Archie take a trip to Bethlehem, meet
the original in person, and get his infor-
mation at close range

  “ I realized that there was no use try-
ing to restrain that bally brakeman when
the hymeneal hawser was pulling him
Bethlehemward

  “ The following Sunday, arrayed in his
gladsome garments, lie journeyed to the
burg with a biblical name I did not see
him until Monday night

   “ ‘ Well, boy,’ I inquired, ‘ did you see
your divinity’

  “ ‘ Sure thing,’ he replied

  “ ‘ What’s her name ’ I asked

  “ ‘ Marie Heloise Clothilde Jeannette
Louise Antoinette Picard,’ he answered

  “‘Great Scott!’ I ejaculated ‘Isn’t
that a rather voluminous name for a sin-
gle female ’

  “ ‘ But she isn’t a single female,’ an-
swered Archie

  “ 1 Married, eh ’ I commented ‘ Well,
it serves you right for getting dippy over
an unknown’

  “‘Well, no,’ replied Archie ‘she’s
only partly married’

  “ ‘ See here, boy,’ I said, ‘ just loosen
up, and let me have some details’

  “ ‘ It’s like this,’ replied Archie ‘ The
original of the picture happens to be the
sisters of Antoine Yes, I said sisters
There’s six of them When Antoine
wanted to put their picture in his watch,
he found that he couldn’t get six photos
into it, so he conceived the brilliant idea
of making a composite photograph of the
six and carrying that in his chronometer
The result was satisfying to Antoine but
untrue to thexiriginals Dugan, old boy,
you ought to see them’

  “ ‘ No, you don’t,’ I replied ‘ You’re
not going to drag me into a mesalliance
with any disintegrated portion of that
composite chromo’

  “ ‘ There’s two of them married,’ re-
plied Archie ‘ and when I make up my
mind which of the remaining four is to
be Mrs Bruxton, I’ll give you an invite
to the wedding’

  “ Well, I got the invite, all right, but
it didn’t happen to be one of the com-
posite coquettes that landed the suscep-
tible Archie for, while he was puzzling
over the problem of plural possibilities,
he succumbed to the wiles of a fat Ger-
man girl whom it would have been im-
possible to photograph except with a view
camera

  “ Say, how are those composite photo-
graphs made, pardner”

  “In this superb work which I am ot
ing you,” replied the book-agent, ‘ Lhe
article on photography goes into full de-
tail as to the modus operandi of com-
posite photography and, in fact, there is
hardly any subject that is not covered
If you will place your name here on the

WE like to be as useful to our readers as we can but, because of the great popularity
of this department, we are forced to impose certain restrictions In future, we
shall be compelled to limit its scope to the answering of questions of an inform-
ative, technical, or historical nature only

    We receive dozens of queries in regard to the right person to apply to for certain
classes of employment If the writers will pause for a moment to consider, the title of
the proper official will readily occur to them, and in any case the information can be
obtained by application to the headquarters of the company involved, much more quickly
than we can publish it

    If a reader, after following these directions, still finds himself lacking in information,
and will write us, giving his full name and postal address, we will try to satisfy him
through the mail, but we cannot answer any letter in which it is not made clear that
some real difficulty exists

SOME time ago I had occasion, while
handling air on trains from the rear
with the tail-pipe, to back an engine
with one heavy coach from the depot to the
yard I placed my tail-hose, or “ gun,” as
we say, on the rear end, tried my air and
set the brakes, the excess pressure, of
ourse, releasing them

  I gave whistle sfgnal to back up and we
jroceeded to the yard, where another en-
gine was standing I applied the air slowly,
until we were about 400 feet away from this
engine, but it had no effect to reduce speed,
so I threw valve in emergency, letting air
out of train-pipe When the air escaped I
could tell it had no force

  We were going about five miles an hour
and struck this engine which I mentioned,
but fortunately with 110 damage This has
happened several times lately, and we have
a dispute about it

 What caused this to occur Was it my

  fault, the brakes, or the fault of the engi-
neer—J W W, Chicago, Illinois

  Without knowing all of the conditions im-
plied in your interesting query, we could not
say positively what the exact cause was, but,
judging from the manner in which the appli-
cation of the brakes was made, the back-up
hose was open, or at least partially This re-
duced the brake-pipe pressure somewhat,
and caused the feed-valve to open wide at
the brake-valve, thus supplying the air to
the brake-pipe as fast as it was being re-
duced at the rear

  No doubt the brake had also been applied
partially in service, thereby reducing the pos-
sibility of obtaining quick action, even if the
brake-pipe was wide open Without having
made a partial service application, however,
the same difficulty in obtaining the quick ac-

tion would be liable to occur for the reason
that the feed-valve would be supplying air
to the brake-pipe very rapidly, thus prevent-
ing the rapid drop in brake-pipe pressure
necessary to obtain quick action, or even a
quick service application of the brake In
other words, the condition necessary to pro-
duce quick action had probably not been
obtained

JS, Fall River, Massachusetts—We have

•	intimated many times in this depart-
-ment that we cannot pass on the merits or
demerits of any school or institution adver-
tising a course in firing locomotives This
attitude is due principally to the fact that we
know nothing about any of them other than
the information which may be gained from
a perusal of their advertising matter, which
you can secure 011 application, and because
we have never known or talked with one of
their graduates

  It would appear from the literature men-
tioned, that, so far as the theoretical knowl-
edge which may be gained is concerned, the
courses taught are no doubt of value We
know that many good firemen are wofully
weak in this end of it Furthermore, we
know that the time is fast coming, in fact
is here, when a man will have to pass a very
good examination on the theory of combus-
tion and many other things heretofore dis-
regarded, before he will be allowed to run
an engine

   We do not believe that the actual work of
handling the scoop, and the art of keeping
the fire in good condition at all times and un-
der diverse conditions, can be learned any-
where except on the footplate We havemo
knowledge whatever of the ability of the
school you mention to secure positions for
its graduates

   They are, of course, in touch with various
master mechanics, and keep the latter ad-
vised of their available men The long and
short of it would be solely whether the mas-
ter mechanic, or employing official, would

prefer to take the new men this way, rather
than through personal acquaintance with
them Your size and weight indicate that
you are physically qualified to perform the
work of a fireman, but, as you are under age,

was fully described in the December Lantern
Department It is 110 doubt as long as you
mention, that is, from the extreme point of
the pilot to the extreme rear portion of the

this particular dimension

(4)	More work is naturally required to
maintain the fire in proper condition in en-
gines having extensive grate area than in
those with small fire-boxes, so far as the
actual physical effort is concerned It has
been our experience that more skill is re-
quired to fire the small engine properly The

majority of the big fellows steam so freely
that the work becomes merely a question of
the endurance available for baling the coal
into them The others have to be humored,
and the coal has to go just where the fire-
man wants it, and in quantities 110 more

IN what position are the eccentrics on the
axle in relation to the crank-pin of a
locomotive

  (2)	How much steam pressure is there
011 the slide-valve of a locomotive, and is the
pressure on the valve the same as the pres-
sure around it

  (3)	What is the difference between a
slide-valve, a balance-valve, and a piston-
valve, as used 011 a locomotive—G N S,
Friedens, Pennsylvania

  (1)	Depends entirely on whether the
valve motion of your engine is what is called
direct, or indirect Direct motion engines
may be considered as those in which the
slide valve is driven by the eccentric and
rod without the interposition of a rocker
arm

  A rocker arm, which is a pivoted device,
naturally reverses the motion imparted by
the eccentric rod and necessitates a different
arrangement of the eccentrics on the shaft
The large majority of locomotives have the
indirect motion, which cannot be avoided,
owing to the height of the valve on its face
above the center line of motion, or the line
drawn through the centers of all axles

  In such cases the forward motion eccen-
tric is placed with its throw above the crank-
pin, when the latter is 011 the center, or “ fol-
lowing ” the crank-pin, in shop parlance
The back-motion eccentric, with the crank-
pin in the position above defined, would be
in a corresponding position below the crank-
pin

  If the slide or piston-valve had 110 lap or
had no lead, the center of the eccentric
throw would be set at right angles with the
crank-pin, the forward at right angle above
and the back at right angle below All
valves, however, have some outside lap, and
as a rule, some lead, therefore it becomes
necessary to advance the eccentric toward
the pin a distance equal to the sum of the
lap and the lead

  A handy rule for this, in the instance of
the locomotive, would set the center of the
throw of the forward-motion eccentric at
the third spoke in the driving wheel, above
the crank that is, reckoning from the posi-
BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN

53

tion of the wheel with the crank-pin on the
center Logically, therefore, the center of
the throw of the back-motion eccentric
would be at the third spoke below the
crank-pin

  (2)	If the packing strips are tight, there
is practically no pressure on the top of a
balanced slide-valve, with which the large
majority of locomotives are equipped, ex-
cept from what steam may leak over the
packing strips, due to poor fit or wear, and
this leakage is provided for through a small
hole in the center of the valve, which allows
whatever leakage may ensue to pass into
the exhaust cavity of the valve and thence
into the stack

  The pressure in the steam-chest, around
the slide-valve, is generally reckoned at 85
per cent of boiler pressure, it being com-
puted that 15 per cent is lost between the
throttle-valve and steam-chest through wire-
drawing radiation, and condensation

  (3)	A balanced slide-valve is protected
with packing strips, or rings, arranged to
make a steam-tight joint on a true plate
above the valve This relieves it of tre-
mendous pressure, to which it would be
subjected, secures corresponding ease of
movement, and not least, a minimum of wear
to the seat 011 which the valve travels

  A plain slide-valve, of which few exam-
ples remain in locomotive design of the pres-
ent day, lias no packing strips or rings, and
has equal steam pressure 011 sides and top
The objections to this type, and which re-
sulted in its retirement, were difficulty in
securing proper lubrication, in handling the
reverse lever under steam, and the rapid
wear of both valve and seat

  A piston-valve, of which many examples
are now standard in this country, is simply,
as its name implies, two pistons representing
the edges of the slide-valve, and connected
by a rod, this rod forming the valve-stem
When outside admission, the space between
the two pistons becomes the exhaust cavity
when inside admission, the space between the
pistons contains the live steam for admis-
sion to the cylinders

  I11 either instance the valve is nicely bal-
anced, this latter being the advantage
claimed for it Its weak point is in the lia-
bility to breakage of the packing rings which
encircle the pistons to make them steam
tight in the valve chamber Although so
many piston-valves are now in use, it can
scarcely be claimed that they have yet passed
from the experimental stage

  It needs but a reference to the reports is-
sued by the various locomotive building con-
cerns to show that many new engines are
still specified to be built with the regular
balanced slide-valve Undoubtedly skepti-

cism still prevails to a marked degree in re-
gard to the utility of thg much-exploited

     F B, Shreveport, Louisiana—The
question of the first automatic cylin-
der lubricator for locomotive use is some-
what obscure, but its invention is generally
credited to Nicholas  Siebert, a California
engineer, who in 1869 applied his idea to
engines in service and with considerable
success

  The first  up drop ” lubricator was invent-
ed in 1873 by John Gates, of Portland, Ore-
gon All succeeding lubricators, up to and
including the elaborate affairs of the pres-
ent day, are but developments or modifica-
tions of Gates's idea YVe have never heard,
or can find no record of the invention of
the lubricator assigned as you mention in

PLEASE tell me whether or not an engine
is considered as a train—C L S, Nor-
folk, Virginia

  An engine running alone, if displaying sig-
nals, or carrying markers, is always regard-
ed as a train This does not apply to engines
running in yards or within yard limits

RULE No 12 says: “Trains will not
leave the following stations without
train order or clearance card: ‘ A,’
1 S,' and ‘ Z: ” Conductor, engine 1697, re-
ceives an order at “ A ” to run extra to “ S,”
and accept caution card on work extras, 18,
28 and 37, working between “ B ” and “ D”
Operator at “ A ” gives conductor a caution
card The conductor refuses a clearance
card, saying he does not need one, as he has
his orders and a caution card Who is right,
the operator or the conductor—E V P,
Schenectady, New York

  As you have quoted the rule which makes
a train order or a clearance equally effective,
and conductor had orders, it would appear
that the clearance card was not necessary
There is no reason, however, why he should
refuse to accept a card, except on the techni-
cality which the rule implies

WHY is the high-pressure cylinder on a
compound locomotive so called, when
it is smaller than the low-pressure
cylinder

  (2)	Where will I get a book explaining
valve setting and going into machinery in
detail—G F H„ Maricopa, California

  (1)	Because it first receives the steam
from the boiler and uses it at that pressure,
minus 15 per cent due to condensation, radia-
tion, etc, before exhausting it into the larger
cylinder This latter is termed the low-
pressure cylinder, because it is supplied
solely by the exhaust steam from the high-
pressure cylinder, and the reason that it is

made of much larger diameter than the other
is because the steam which it receives is
much reduced in pressure, and in order to
partially offset this loss it is spread over a
greater piston area

FW F, Chicago, Illinois—A second
• man is always carried 011 electric loco-
motives, practically in the same capacity as
was a fireman when these roads were for-
merly operated by steam The proposition
was made to dispense with the second man
in the interests of economy, but the matter
was taken up by the labor organizations and
two men were conceded with scarcely an ar-
gument against it

  The duty of the second man is to assist
the operator where required to observe and
call the signals, and anything of a similar
nature which would naturally be suggested
Electric railroading, 011 the largest scale, is
at present carried on by the New York Cen-
tral and Hudson River Railroad, out of
New York City, and by the New York, New
Haven and Hartford Railroad, between New
York and Stamford, Connecticut, about thir-
ty-seven miles

  This latter road will shortly extend its
electric zone from Stamford to New Haven,
Connecticut, making a total electric division
of seventy-five miles It should not be lost
sight of that the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-
road was practically the pioneer in this form
of transportation on a generous scale, as
back in 1893 they began hauling their trains,
both freight and passenger, from Camden
station, Baltimore, Maryland, through the
Belt Line tunnel to the northern outskirts
of the city The fact that these original
Baltimore and Ohio motors were just as
efficient in their day as the ones now in use,
forms almost a convincing argument that the
development of the electric engine is not all
which might be reasonably looked for

  If railroads were generally electrified,
there would probably be no better time made
than at present The time 011 the New Ha-
ven from Stamford to New York was made
with ease by steam, and from all we can
learn it is made no easier now

PLEASE describe the  Mother Hubbard 
type of locomotive Are there any in
use now—T J, San Jose, California

  This term applies to engines equipped
with the Wooten or extended fire-box
They came into prominence about 1877, at
which time this form of fire-box was patent-
ed It was a radical departure from the
existing type of eight-wheel, or American
locomotive, inasmuch that the fire-box was
extended completely across the gage of
the track, and over the driving wheels, thus
permitting a vastly increased grate area

  This extension resulted in the cab being
placed ahead of it, or about in the center of
the boiler, as if located in the usual place
on the end of the boiler it would take up
the clearances along the permanent way
All engines having the cab so located are
broadly termed “ Mother Hubbards,” and
there are hundreds, if not thousands, run-
ning in this country

  They are almost the standard engine on
the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and the Erie,
and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western
have a large number of them in service

   There is a prejudice against them, as the
engineer and fireman are quite remote in
performing their duties This is so strong
in some sections that this type cannot run in
certain States, we think Ohio and Indiana,
and they are gradually dropping out They
have always been regarded with favor by
motive-power management, as with their
tremendous grate area they are able to get
along with very inferior fuel, in fact, the
idea of Mr Wooten, when he first took out
his patent, was for an engine with a fire-box
so designed that it would burn satisfactorily
the culm from mines

Jt

GW V, Douglas, Arizona—It is said

•	that while an engine is in tow of an-
other that the injectors on the dead engine
will fill the boiler by proceeding as follows:
Place reverse lever in back motion and open
main throttle, cylinder cocks, and injector
steam ram

   The idea is that the pistons of the engine
being towed will act as pumps, and the ten-
dency thereby being to rid the boiler of air
a vacuum would be created within the boiler,
or at least a vacuum sufficient to raise the

   check-valves from their seats1 and allow the
water to flow in through the tank hose, feed-
pipe injector, and branch, pipe Theoret-
ically, this should be so, but we have person-
ally never had a practical connection with
the experiment No doubt this will meet the
eye of many of our older readers among
the engineers, who can cite a case of fact

HOW would you proceed if a valve yoke
broke 011 the road, with a plain slide-
valve engine with balanced valves

J H, Baltimore, Maryland

   A valve yoke usually breaks off at the neck
of the valve-stem It will be readily dis-
covered at the exhaust by a tremendous
blow If the valve is pushed far enough
ahead it will blow if not it is often mis-
taken for a slipped eccentric, so would sug-
gest that the eccentrics be examined first

  It may be discovered in this way: Place
the crank-pin 011 top or bottom quarter and
reverse engine If the steam continues to
come -out of the back cylinder-cock, you
may depend it is usually the yoke A great
diversity of opinion exists regarding the
best remedy for this kind of break The
time-honored and safest way is to raise the
chest cover and block the ports central, re-
place the cover, remove the valve-rod and
main rod and block the cross-head at the
back end

  But this remedy requires much time and
labor, and as time is a very important con-
sideration 011 the road, and there appears
to be 110 mechanical objection to the other
methods, provided that the cross-head is
securely fastened, we will state them Dis-
connect the valve-rod, and push the valve
clear ahead, remove the stem, if it
would blow out, and use a gasket back of
the gland, or hold the valve-stem intact with
a valve-stem clamp Block the cross-head at
the front end and proceed The pressure
will hold the valve forward, and if the valve
should move it will do 110 harm, provided
the cross-head be securely blocked Another
way is to remove the release-valve push
the valve clear back, fit a block into the
release-valve long enough to hold the valve
back, then block cross-head at back end
Still another way is to push the valve-stem
forward and clamp it by cocking the gland,
then block cross-head at the front end

  If the yoke is only broken at one side
of the valve it will affect only one exhaust
When the yoke pushes the valve forward,
the valves will sound all right, but when it
pulls the valve back, the engine will be lame
With careful handling you may finish your
trip Work engine in full gear with a light
throttle

  “ There you go again,” he growled,

  I assured him that such were my in-

“ Got any life insurance” he drawled

  “ Lemme tell you of a funny wrestle

  “Go on bust yourself,” I
snapped at him, “ but don’t

Spike rolled himself another
paper pipe, and after blowing
a few smoke - rings at the
ceiling broke into a reminiscent
chuckle

  “ Which this here episode is

  “Our path was narrow, but not straight

left behind would have made a snake

Billy seemed to be having the time of his

  “ All of a sudden the car stopped dead,

while yours truly made what was called

belly-whopper dive over the pilot and
onto the right of way

  “ ‘ Now, what the mischief caused that

on, Floratio, but the next time you do any
braking, you make a light application and
leave that big hole strictly alone When
I get out hereafter, I may get out on my
feet, not my face—sabe’ but all the an-
swer I got was a growl, and we were off
on our career of glory again

  “ We rounded a corner, and ran plumb
into a Salvation Army meeting Meet-
ing was dismissed right away When we
had cleared the mess, I found that the
big bass drum had careened into the back
of the auto, and, rescuing it, I began to
play a tom-tom on it to add my bit to the
excitement

  “ By this time I was really beginning
to enjoy it We were making quite a hit

  “ The next turn brought us into Cen-
ter Avenue, the bright and busy Broad-
way of Alberquerque We were going
by and large, high, wide, and handsome,
Billy emitting joyous whoops like unto a
Sioux buck on the war-path, and little me
beating a tom-tom accompaniment on the
big bass drum

  “To help out the effect, the auto was
doing its best to give fine portrayals of
a big red Moki buck Indian pulling off
the famous snake-dance of his tribe She
sure was glorious Add to this a large
and ever-growing string of interested
spectators, who strove earnestly to over-

take us, and you have some glimmering
of the sensation we produced

   “ Business was suspended for the day
when we passed The sidewalks were
miraculously deserted on our approach
Still, we did manage to pull off a few
stunts, by way of variety The auto
swooped into a peanut-stand on one loop,
and then went right across the street and
took a market-basket out of a deaf wom-
an’s hand We left her the hysterics, by
way of recompense, however

   “ As we neared the railroad tracks I
begin to see our finish, and a large, scar-
let finish it was There was a crowd
there The police had a rope stretched
across the road to stop us

   “ ‘ Whoa, Billy! ’ I yelled at him
1 Look at the reception committee they’ve
got spread out there for us Better stop’

   “ He turned his face to me and yelled,
‘ Stop, blazes ! I can’t stop ! That brake
won’t work! ’

  “ ‘ Oh, Lord! ’ I groaned from the
depths of my heart

   “ A bevy of the blue-coated minions
of the law awaited us with outstretched
arms, but not of welcome

   “ Billy saw them, too, and tried to take
the corner, but the auto had other designs,
and plowed across the street and into a
druggist’s window

   “ Here the beast gave an expiring groan
and ceased activity in one gorgeous burst
of orange-colored flame and a rank odor
But we went on into the store I lit be-
hind the soda-fountain, from which the
clerk promptly skedaddled, while Billy
went on and demolished the cigar-case be-
fore he toppled the cashier’s stand over on
that outraged young lady

  “ I remembered thinking before the
darkness descended that we was plumb
lucky to light where we did, medical at-
tendance being so handy and nice

   “ Murmuring, 1 Send for the wrecker,’
I went peacefully to sleep

   “ Afterward, in the convalescent ward,
Billy remarks to me that we finished our
ride with ‘ eclaw ’—whatever the blazes
that is When I disagreed with him, and
stood out that our finish was the drug-
store, he was inclined to agree until the
consequences burst in upon our inner
senses, and then we decided that our finish
was yet to come

  “By George! My cards and certifi-
cates are in another pocket Maybe you
will tell me, anyway—about what are the
average monthly earnings of this office ”
“ From twenty to twenty-five thousand
dollars,” said the chief clerk, thumbing
over a bunch of correspondence and never
raising an eye

  “ That’s about five times as much busi-
ness as they do at the passenger-station,
is it not ”

  “ Anyway, that much more”

  “ When your business is so much more
than the passenger - station’s, why don’t
they have flower-beds around, and have
a few gables, and some dormer windows,
and tile roofing, and gimcrack eaves—”

  “ Flow long have you been out ” asked
the clerk

  “ Ornaments — decorations—curlicues
—harmony — esthetic equilibrium — the
freight-house beautiful! ”

  “ We ought to find some way to no-
tify his folks,” put in another clerk

  But just then a big, redfaced dray-
man elbowed me away from the coun-
ter, and I stepped outside and surveyed
the rakish-looking structure that an-
swered for a freight-house

  Low, flat, soiled, and begrimed, un-
sought and unknown by the people gen-
erally, it had the merit to the company
of bringing in five dollars to every one
taken in at the passenger-station, with all
the latter’s spectacular flubdubbery

  There are no frills about the freight
business to catch the public eye It
creates no public interest If a road puts
on two additional passenger-trains, it is
an event of keen interest to every one liv-
ing along the line It can put on a half-
dozen new freight-trains, and no one
knows or cares about it beyond the em-
ployees

  “ What bureau or association do you
represent  ” asked the chief clerk with
a sort of weary indifference, when I re-
appeared at the counter “ We- have an
inspector of some sort for every working
hour of the day,” he went on, without
waiting for me to reply “ Let me see,
we had the car-service inspector here at
nine o’clock We had the Inspector for
the Bureau of Weights and Measures at
ten We had the Joint Rate Commission
man at eleven

  “ We have representatives of the State
Railroad Commission, the Interstate
Commission, the Live Stock Inspector,
the Nursery Stock Inspector, and the
Pure Food Law man

  “ The State Fertilizer Inspector ought
to be here some time to-day, and in be-
tween we have a few special agents of
our own to look after cars, buildings, in-
surance, real estate, right-of-way, and
other things My dear sir, there isn’t
any angle of our business that isn’t pro-
vided for, either by the government or
the railroad Maybe you are the In-
spector of Ventilation Don’t think he
has called 011 us yet”

  I grasped at the straw, and bestowed
011 the clerk one of my sickly, ingratia-
ting smiles

  “ That’s it! That’s me! ” I exclaimed
triumphantly “ I’m the Hot Air Man!
Sorry I haven’t a card But never mind
that! I want to write up the freight-
house and the force I want to make a
story for other railroads of the strange,
sensational, and amusing events that oc-
cur in a local freight-office”

  The clerk eyed me with a Peary-to-
Cook gaze

  “ My deluded friend,” said he, “ no
one cares for us No one sees us Al>
we do is to get the business and take in
the money Nothing ever happens with-
in these dismal walls Do not waste your
efforts on us Go out and see the yard-

   “ I notice the clerk over at the cabinet
muttering to himself,” said I softly to the
chief clerk “ When he crossed the room
a moment ago he moved with a halting,
jerky step He isn’t disconnected on one
side, is he ”

  “That is the rate-clerk Judge him

  “ We have recommended a change of

for him to get up and go out into the
freight-house, stand in the door, and look
out over the vacant lot adjoining, shifting
the vision leisurely to the ice-house and
then to the row of cpal-sheds that lie in
the offing

  “ Then he should engage the freight-
house man in light, blithesome conversa-
tion as he loads his truck with green hides,
at the same time harking to the melliflu-
ous chant of the slaughter-house team-
ster who has just mashed a thumb, then
back to the desk For in the meantime
another batch of tariffs and supplements
has arrived”

  Almost every freight-office is provided
with a back door or window view

  Whenever there is a lull, a clerk stands
and gazes out pensively It may over-
look a vacant lot, some dingy cars, a
straggling tree or two, or merely the city
garbage dump

  No matter

  Many times a day a clerk looks out
on it and dreams Then he saunters back
to his desk, and another clerk looks out
and dreams

  However gloomy the perspective or un-
inviting the view, in some way over the
routine it casts roseate reflections It cre-
ates a longing for the open and mental
mirages of fields and lakes, autos and
steam-yachts

  “ See here, John,” said the chief clerk,
“ you have looked out of the window ten
times a day for three years, and now, after
ten thousand inspections, it is safe to say
you cannot write a description of that
big tree that stands in the foreground
that will enable any one to identify it”

  John tried it with a bravado flourish,
but failed He could not say if it was
elm, oak, or maple, the kind of leaf, nor
the number or direction of its principal
branches

  “ What’s the odds ” retorted John de-
fiantly “ That’s got nothing to do with
booking freight-bills”

  Strangely enough, none of the others
could describe the most prominent ob-
jects

  That is the way we learned they were

not looking—only dreaming The peep
of the open contained nothing within it-
self, only the subtle suggestion of the
boundless beyond

  It is a dead, dull life, indeed, to the
man who works all the time within nar-
row walls, if there are not some dreams,
some hope concealed in the far-off years
to be unfolded

  Credit Shakespeare with this:

  True hope is swift, and flies with swal-
    low’s wings

  Kings it makes gods, and meaner crea-
    tures kings

  “ Pardon me,” said 1 to the chief clerk
“ The voluminous document you now
hold in your hand, bearing the large let-
ters ‘ Special,’ and which you are about
to enclose in an envelope marked with a
register stamp, has aroused my curiosity
May I ask the purport of it  ”

  “ You may,” replied the chief clerk
blandly, at the same time unfolding and

smoothing out the papers “ This is a
freight claim”

  “Indeed!” I exclaimed “Does it
involve some fundamental right of the
road—some vital privilege—some—”

  “ You judge by the bulk The truth is
it is for three dollars and sixty cents,” the
chief clerk explained, “ and no constitu-
tional question raised This is for dam-s
age on a shipment of drain tile, and some
of them were broken These papers seek
to find the cause of the damage and fix
the responsibility”

  “ That is an easy matter, is it not  ” I
asked, with childlike innocence

  The chief clerk bestowed a pitying
glance

  “ We have here,” he went on, thumb-
ing the papers one by one, “ a car that
was handled by three conductors and
went through two yards We have state-
ments from every man who handled the
car to this effect: ‘ No rough handling in

tractions and expansions, brought on by
variations of the temperature, have

  “ Isn’t it possible that some of those
statements are incorrect  ”

  “ Why should we doubt Why should
we question the word of our fellow work-,
ers Did you ever stop to think what
a horrible thing it is to lose faith in man
I have looked over claims for ten years,
and I have seen that statement ten thou-
sand times: ‘No rough handling in my
charge’

  “ And now, sir, I know, by undisputed
testimony, first hand, that no two cars
ever came together with greater force
than is employed in smacking the lips of
a fair lady”

  I watched him seal up the papers

  “ May I ask why you lick the envel-
ope twice”

  “ Sh-sh—” he replied, with an admon-
ishing wave of the hand and bending to-
ward me “ It is an office secret It is
a large part of our food-supply, and
comes to us gratis Never breathe it If
it were known, the company would spread

the mucilage thinner on the envelope-
flap”

  “ What document have you there” I
asked of the bill-clerk

  “ A tracer,” he replied “ There’s
thousands of them in circulation, sir
They are put out as recklessly as clearing-
house certificates during a panic
You see, when a shipment don’t
arrive the day before it’s
shipped, we have to put a
tracer after it

  “ People have great faith in
tracers When a patron kicks of
delay, we tell him we’ll put a
tracer after it He does not
know just what a tracer is, but
he has a misty sort of an idea
that it lets out a few hoarse,
bloodhound barks, gets its nose
to the rail, picks up the scent,
and runs down the loitering
shipments with amazing speed
and certainty It’s a sort of
opiate we give our kicking pa-
trons Quiets them for the time
It’s all a fake, sir

  “ A tracer is a printed blank
whereon one agent informs an-
other that he has forwarded, on
such a date and waybill, one
crate of cabbage Has it been
delivered What date, and to
whom  In time, unless it ac-
cidentally falls into the waste-
basket or office-stove, the receiving-agent
returns' the tracer with the necessary in-
formation Now, if the crate should ar-
rive about the time the tracer is put out,
it gets the credit for turning the trick

  “ There seems to be a general impres-
sion that ‘ putting a tracer after it ’ is
the same as placing the lever at high-
speed notch The real fact is, it hurries
matters about as much as writing ‘ Rush ’
011 a letter before dropping it in the post-
office

  “ There isn’t much excitement about a
freight-office,” the chief clerk ventured,
after a while “ The draymen line up to
the counter every day for their bills, and
some one from the factories comes over
with the daily billing There is no rustle
of silk and nod of ostrich plumes, and
happy vacation faces, like they have even-
hour over at the passenger-station All
our joys come by telephone”

  They take sides in the post-season

is being waged on the diamond, every de-
tail of the contest is gone over and over
within the office walls, and there is wild-
eyed victory and galling defeat a hun-
dred miles away from the sniff of the
real powder

  All this fills “ Big Sam ” with disgust

  “ Big Sam ” is the warehouse man I
went out on the loading platform and sat
down on a barrel

  He stopped before me and leaned
heavily on his truck and took a chew of
tobacco No mincy, dudish tidbit, but
a quantity like unto the raise to the barn-
loft on the hay-fork

  “ What do them fellers know about
sport, anyway” said Sam, jabbing his
thumb toward the freight-office with a
gesture of disgust

  “ They talk about baseball, and cro-
quet and tiddledywinks, and- ‘ Whose
got the button’ but they ain’t any of
’em been within a thousand miles of real
sport

  “ They make me tired I’ve seen real
Spanish torerros down at Laredo Why,

two horses killed, and one matador laid

  “ Then I was down at Vicksburg, Mis-
sissippi, when old John L, the greatest

about sport! They ain’t anything like
that in these days

  “ Why, them young fellers ain’t never
seen anything more exciting than open-
ing a bottle of pop But to hear ’em
talk, you’d think they had actually stayed
out some night until after nine o’clock! ”
Sam sneered with contempt, and con-
tinued : “ I see by the papers this morn-
ing that the scrap-between Joe Halligan
and Jim Hackey came out just as I said
it would, only -I didn’t expect Hackey to

ain’t in the same class with Halligan

  “ Halligan just let him prance around
until he thought the audience had got its
money’s worth, then he handed him one
of them upper-cut slumber coaxers, and
that was the same to Hackey as takin’

  Sam seized the truck, and marched off
as triumphantly as if he were Halligan’s

kind” I asked of the rate-clerk

  “ I'll tell you on the quiet he has,” re-

IN spite of endless failures, the blind seekers of a force without a law have
gone on and on, encouraged by the seeming successes of certain plausible
or ingenious impostors Some of these men have hoodwinked a credu-
lous world all without achieving the slightest good with their sensational
inventions By the combined work of these apparently successful fakers not
an industrial wheel was ever turned, not a moment saved, not a labor light-

trickery

No 2—Orffyreus, Prince of Perpetual Motion Sharps, Deceived Princes,
Dukes, and Even Scientific Men, Until His Nerve
Gave Way on the Eve of Exposure

MYSTERY that will never
be'solved was the perpet-
ual - motion machine of
Jean Ernest Elie-Bessler
Orffyreus For a century
after his death, in 1745,
there were hundreds of students of the
search for self-motive power who were
convinced that he had really solved the
great problem 

  Probably there are believers in him
even to this day Many and many a me-
chanic has been drawn into the centuries-
old search for the impossible solely
through his belief in Orffvreus’s success

  He was the prince of impostors of his
time He fooled half the rulers of Europe
with his mysterious wheel, and it raised
him from a poor, wandering showman,
sometimes hooted and scoffed at by village
crowds, to fame and high position

  There was no promise of what was go-
ing to happen connected with his machine

Flis was a wheel that really revolved It
not only revolved, but raised heavy
weights What was the source of its power

Bean In the January R a il r o a d Man's Magazine Single copies, 10 cente

                                                                   <39

 is as much of a riddle to-day as it was in
 his own time Men who really believe in
 the possibility of perpetual motion are
 likely to maintain that there was no fraud
 about it, and that it was the greatest in-
 vention of all time

   Try to'couvince a perpetual motion in-
 ventor of the fallacy of his idea, and he
 will point to this man Orffyreus and tell
 you the great secret was found two hun-
 dred years ago, and lost Whatever the
 secret of that famous wheel was, it was
 destroyed by the inventor himself for
 with his own hands he smashed the ma-
 chine to fragments and never made an-
 other

The Master Mystifier

   During the year 1712, Orffyreus ap-
 peared in several villages in Saxony,
 where he exhibited to street crowds a
 swiftly revolving wheel which he declared
 would never stop unless interfered with
 Sometimes the crowds looked upon him
 as a great genius, sometimes they stoned
 him
70

THE RAILROAD MAM’S MAGAZINE

  Before long, news of the wheel had
spread about through Europe, and Mau-
rice William, Duke of Saxony, showed
a lively interest in it In 1715, Orffyreus
exhibited his invention before a commis-
sion selected by the duke, on which were
the ducal secretary and other high state
officials, and Frederick Hoffman, a dis-
tinguished physician The commission
was convinced that perpetual motion had
at last been discovered

Royal Indorsement

  A few days later, on November 26, the
duke himself came to see the wheel He
ordered the doors and windows of the
room in which it was running to be closed
and sealed, and a guard was left outside

  On the 4th of the following January
the duke came again The seals on doors
and windows were removed, and the room
was thrown open The wheel was run-
ning as fast as ever!

   This surprising discovery carried abso-
lute conviction to the mind of the duke
He pledged himself under his name and
seal that the construction of the machine
was not such that it required winding up

  The inventor’s fame spread rapidly
after this test The Emperor of Austria,
hearing of his achievement, offered to give
Herr Schluter, a celebrated engineer, thir-
ty thousand rubles if lie would construct
a perpetual-motion machine

  Herr Schluter tried and failed, and
died of a broken heart His son took up
the attempt, but the thirty thousand ru-
bles remained unwon

  Andreas Gartner, Court Model-Master
of the King of Poland, denounced Orffy-
reus as a fraud, but declared that he him-
self could make a perpetual-motion ma-
chine The king gave him an order to
construct such a machine, and he set to
work upon it He made a machine in
which a ball was seen to run up and down
on a wheel, and thereby raise weights

A Shift of Patrons

   The king, his ministers, architects, and
mechanics, brought Gartner into great no-
tice, and a special patent was granted to
him for the protection of his invention

   In the meantime Prince Lord Charles,
Landgrave of Hesse, had become the pa-

tron of Orffyreus The inventor had been
attacked from many quarters in Saxony,
and for some unexplained reason the
duke’s suspicions had been aroused against
him

  The landgrave installed Orffyreus in
his Castle of Weissenstein, near Cassel
There the wheel was set up and exhibited,
and it so pleased the landgrave that,
eventually, he made its inventor High
Hessian Councilor of Commerce

  Orffyreus explained his source of power
in these words:

  “ The inward structure of the wheel is
of a nature according to the laws of me-
chanical perpetual motion, so arranged
that by disposed weights once in rotation
they gain force from their own swinging,
and must continue their movement as long
as their structure does not lose its posi-
tion and arrangement They are so ar-
ranged one against another that they can
never obtain equilibrium or the punctual
quietus which they unceasingly seek in
their wondrous speedy flight One or
other of them must apply its weight ver-
tically to the axis, which in its turn'will
also move”

A Scientist's Approval

  Surely there must have been something
wonderfully ingenious about this wheel,
for when Baron Fischer, architect to the
emperor, came to Cassel to inspect it, he
could find no trace of any deception He
saw a wheel twelve feet in diameter re-
volving twenty-six times a minute A
cord was then tied to the axle to turn an
Archimedean screw to raise water, and the
wheel then revolved twenty times a min-
ute

  “ I then stopped the wheel with much
difficulty,” wrote the baron, “ holding on
the circumference with both hands An
attempt to stop it suddenly would raise a
man from the ground

  “ Having stopped it in this manner, it
remained stationary (And here, sir is
the greatest proof of a perpetual motion)
I commenced the movements very gently
to see if it would of itself regain its for-
mer rapidity, which I doubted, believing,
as they had said in London, that it only
preserved for a long time the impetus of
the impulse first communicated

  “ But to my great astonishment, I ob-
PERPETUAL MOTION—THE GREATEST OF DELUSIONS 71

served that the rapidity of the wheel aug-
mented little by little until it had made
two turns, and then it regained its former
speed I examined well the axles of this
wheel to see if there was any hidden ar-
tifice, but I was unable to see anything
more than the two small axles on which
the wheel was suspended by the center

  “ His highness, who is a perfect mathe-
matician, assured me that the machine is
so simple that a carpenter’s boy could un-
derstand and make it after having seen the
exterior”

Unproven Doubts

  A woman servant declared to some in-
vestigators who had been invited to the
castle by the landgrave to inspect the ma-
chine, that she had been hired by Orft'y-
reus to turn the wheel from an adjoining
room, but Baron Fischer said this would
have leen impossible So said other dis-
tinguished men who had examined it

  They declared they had found not the
slightest trace of any communication with
the adjoining room The servant, how-
ever, after announcing that Orffyreus had
threatened to strangle her if she disclosed
the secret, disappeared, and the inventor
himself, apparently roused to fury by the
suspicions directed against him, smashed
the machine into small pieces Although
he lived for many years afterward, he
never furnished the world with any more
clues to the mystery’s solution

  Europe was full of perpetual - motion
impostors for a century after Orffvreus’s
death There was a dramatic exposure
of one of them at Frankfort in 1817 J
Geiser had been exhibiting in that city a
pendulum clock which he declared pos-
sessed self-motive power

•	Another Fake

  A trifling accident happened to the
clock while it was on exhibition, and the
inventor set about to repair the damage
He fell dead while he was tinkering with
the works While he was lying there,
some mechanics investigated the interior
of his machine and discovered a concealed
winding apparatus

  In 1812, Charles Readhefer, of Phila-
delphia, came near getting a grant of
funds from the legislature of Pennsyl-

vania to back his perpetual-motion pro-
ject Such firm faith did the legislators
have in his revolving wheel that they ap-
pointed a committee to investigate it

  Readhefer had set his wheel up in a
small building in Philadelphia, on the
banks of the Schuylkill River When the
legislative committee arrived there, they
found the doors and windows lacked

  One of the members of the committee
was Nathan Sellers He had brought
with him his son, Coleman, a boy Cole-
man Sellers climbed up to one of the
barred windows and looked in It was
this boy’s sharp eyes and sharp wits that
saved the State of Pennsylvania from ma-
king itself ridiculous

   “ I can see the machine,” cried the boy,
“ and it’s a fraud”

•	He called his father to the window and
pointed out what he had seen that result-
ed later in Readhefer’s exposure The
machine had a set of teeth in the periphery
of the rotating table which geared into an-
other wheel whose axle was supposed to
transmit the power to some other point
where work was to be done

A Child Leads Them

   The boy had noticed that the faces of
the teeth on the two wheels were pol-
ished by wear on the wrong sides The
boy explained that if the machine were
driven as Readhefer declared it was, it
would be the other sides of the teeth that
would show the wear, and that the power
must come from some concealed mechan-
ism in the base

  This argument failed to convince the
committee, but it led to an investigation
that resulted, some time afterward, in the
discovery of concealed clockwork Read-
hefer, who had induced many persons to
invest large sums of money in his scheme,
left the State in a hurry

   “ I shall soon revolutionize the indus-
trial world,” declared John Paine when,
in 1875 he exhibited his electro-magnetic
engine in Newark, New Jersey He in-
vited several well-known scientists to
come and see his machine work They
came and watched the contrivance driving
lathes and sawing wood, and went away
bewildered

  Paine organized a company and sold
stock The shares were quickly gobbled

up, and he was growing rich when, one
day, a committee of stockholders waited
upon him to inspect the inner workings of
the machine with the assistance of an ex-
pert

  Under pretext of getting a drink, the
inventor went out He never came back
It was discovered, during his absence, that
a belt ran from the axle of the machine
to steam power in the room below

  Scores of such swindlers there have
been in this country since that time Most
of them have been exposed, and some are
in prison

Keely ihe Plausible

  None of them, however, ranked with
that marvel of impostors, John Ernest
Worrell Keely He it was who kept some
of the world’s greatest scientists a guess-
ing, and millions of money sprang to the
assistance of his motor project during its
quarter of a century existence

  An overpowering personality was his
He possessed a phraseology as incompre-
hensible as it was beguiling He talked
of “ molecular vibration,” “ oscillation of
the atom,” “ sympathetic equilibrium,”
and “ quadruple negative harmonics ” un-
til the average mind found its receptive
powers unequal to the occasion Nobody
knew just what he was driving at but al-
most everybody who came under the spell
of his bewildering conversation believed
in him

  With a series of tuning-forks he de-
clared that he could disintegrate air and
release an etheric force rivaling a cyclone
in strength A pint of water would work
wonders Before the eyes of the spectators
in his laboratory, great ropes were torn
apart, iron bars broken or twisted, and
bullets discharged through twelve-inch
planks

The De-Polar Force

  With one quart of water he would be
able to send a train from Philadelphia to
San Francisco with a gallon he would
propel a steamship from New York to
Liverpool and back

  Keely declared he had discovered that
there existed polar and de-polar waves of
force “If we take the compass,” said his
lawyer, in explaining the wonderful mo-

tor, “ and put it near the machine, the
needle will cease to be controlled by the
force that otherwise makes it point toward
the north, and will turn toward the ma-
chine

  “ Suppose you have two tuning-forks
pitched in precisely the same tone, and
both giving absolutely the same sound
vibration Put one 011 a table in one room,
put the other 011 a table in another room

  “ Strike one and immediately the other
will take the tone and vibrate in harmony
with it The cosmic force that carries that
vibration from one fork to the other and
makes them vibrate in harmony is the
force that Keely has discovered That
force has now been harnessed”

  Set up in his laboratory in Philadelphia,
the motor was a very impressive piece of
machinery It was composed of the mo-
tor proper and the transmitter The ma-
chine rested on aheavy brass base Also,
there was a heavy brass sphere

Musical Motive-Power

  Between the engine and the transmitter
ran a series of wires, and along the base of
the transmitter an array of steel rods bris-
tled like so many fixed bayonets These
steel rods were responsive to the touch,
and compared to an ordinary musical
scale, which is subject to the tuning-fork

  The interior of the globe almost defied
description, but out of the complex mass
brass tubes and adhesive plates stood
prominently This was the shifting reso-
nator, as Keely termed it The tubes and
plates took up the vibratory sound and
carried it along with rapidity Of these
vibrations there were seven distinct kinds,
said Keely, each of the seven capable of
infinitesimal division

  The motor itself consisted of a heavy
iron hoop placed firmly on the plate
Within this hoop ran a drum with eight
spokes When it was once in operation,
the movements of the drum were very
rapid The harmonics were supposed to
start the machinery by “ etheric force”

Exposed, but Still Puzzling

  To the day of his death, when he had
kept up the deception for a quarter of a
century, his stockholders held their faith
in him It was not until several weeks
PERPETUAL MOTION—THE GREATEST OF DELUSIONS 73

afterward, when, late on a winter’s night
in 1899, the walls and flooring of his lab-
oratory were ripped up and secret tubes
discovered, that they realized the colossal
fraud

   Even to this day nobody is quite sure
 whether it was compressed air or some
 other force that Keely brought through
 those tubes

  In even greater numbers than the
frauds are the tragedies that mark the
long road to this unattainable goal In
1890 a distinguished-looking old man,
John Kreyezich, a cabinetmaker by trade,
went to live in a poor little room at No
50 Fourteenth Street, Hoboken

   He paid one dollar and fifty cents a
week for his room, and not only slept and
prepared his own meals in it, but used it
as a work-shop His food was of the
poorest sort, and his clothes were thread-
bare' All day and until late into the night
he could be heard sawing and hammering
at his carpenter’s bench

Tragedies of Futility

   “ Some day,” he told his landlady, “ I
 shall make millions 1 shall make heat,
 light, and cold I shall drive steamships
 and railroad trains I shall revolutionize
 industry My machine on which I am
 working will run without fuel, and will
 never stop”

   He never allowed anybody in his room
 He was afraid, he explained, that his
 great invention would be stolen

  Seven long years lie hammered and
sawed, and then, one day two strangers,
said to be rich promoters from Boston,
called on him After that, every week for
one year they sent him ten dollars, and he
bought a new suit of clothes and ate a lit-
tle more regularly Then the remittances
stopped

“ They got tired,” he told his landlady

 “ They wanted their millions too quickly
 Ah they’ll have nothing now! ”

  Three more years went by One eve-
ning it occurred to the landlady that she
had not seen the old man for several days
She went to his door and knocked There
was no reply She tried to open it It
was locked

   Then she called in a policeman, and the
 door was broken open I-ying against a
 great wheel surmounting a mass of ma-

 chinery was the old man, dead, his stif-
 fened fingers gripping a tangle of wires

   The big wheel hung on a steel axle, with
 which the wires had seemed to have some
 important connection Fastened to the
 wheel’s circumference, at regular dis-
 tances apart, were a number of buckets,
 and at the base of the wheel was a tub of
 water

   Nobody knew where the old inventor
had come from, and they buried him in
Potter’s Field

A Railroad Man’s Ruin

   Charles Heiner was a machinist em-
ployed in the roundhouse of the New York
Central Railroad at Mott Haven, and
lived with his wife in a flat at No 693
East One Hundred and Forty-Fifth
Street, New York For twenty-five years
he had spent most of his spare time work-
ing on a machine that he expected would
give perpetual motion Every night after
dinner he would go to his room and tinker
with his array of wheels and cogs and
chains

   “ I shall be rich and famous some day,”
 he told his wife

   She had unbounded faith in him, and
encouraged him when sometimes his
spirits flagged One day in 1893 he lost
his position He gave his bank deposit
of a few hundred dollars to his wife and
went to work with desperate energy on his
machine He must solve the great prob-
lem before his savings were spent

   The months went by, and thfc bank ac-
count was almost exhausted But still the
wheels would not go

   After dinner one day he said to his
wife: “ I’m tired out, and sha’n’t do any
work to-night” He carefully covered up
his wheels and chains and went to bed

   In the morning she found him hanging
dead from a rope tied to the apex of his
machine When some machinists who had
known him investigated the contrivance
on which he had toiled for so many years,
they found that evidently the whole com-
plex arrangement was based on the idea
of the overbalancing wheel

  The Despair of Weariness

In Cleveland, in 1908 B F Eibler
was found one morning dead in his work-

shop with poison beside him For two
years he had been working night and day
over a mysterious machine He had never
explained to anybody what it was going
to be but just before taking the poison,
he wrote a letter in which lie told of a
fruitless struggle to invent an attachment
for electric automobiles in which the elec-
tricity used in running the motor-car
would be replaced with power generated
by the car itself

  In 1901, a handsome young Syrian was
among the students who were taking the
course in mechanical engineering at Co-
lumbia University He was Basile Saheb,
who had come to this country three years
before, and had been living at No 131
West One Hundred and Eleventh Street
There he had fitted up a little laboratory,
where he worked every evening until mid-
night on a perpetual-motion machine

  One morning a shot rang out from the
laboratory, and there was the sound of a
heavy fall on the floor Some of the
startled lodgers in the house rushed to the
student’s door and found him lying dead
against the bed Strewn across the floor
was a mass of pulleys, valves, levers, cog-
wheels and chains He had smashed his
machine to pieces

An Old Man’s Awakening

  In the summer of the same year, Will-
iam Herford, an old carpenter in Will-
iamsburg, committed suicide in his work-,
shop at No 265 Ellery Street For thirty
years he fiad tried to find perpetual mo-
tion Two weeks before his death he told
his wife that he realized at last that his
long search had been hopeless, and that
he had wasted his life on a delusion

  All his money he had spent on his ma-
chine, and left scarce enough to bury him
It was a most complex contrivance that
he left behind him, so complex, in fact,
that nobody could understand on what
lines he had been working

  As pathetic as any of these tragedies
was the story of Adolf Schaap, an old
Hungarian He came to America from
his native country when a young man, and
became a thrifty ironworker He married
and had children, and his home was a
happy and prosperous one

And then, somehow, the delusion of

(The

perpetual motion got into his brain and
drove him on to ruin He gave up his
job as an ironworker, and spent all his
time constructing a machine to carry out
his ambition

   Before long the family treasury ran
empty, and there was no food in the house
Yet he could not be persuaded to leave his
machine

Worst Form of the Mania

  “Never mind!” he cried “We can
starve for a while We’ll soon have money
enough  we’ll have millions”

  Before another week had passed his
wife had left him, taking the children
with her The landlord put him out of
his home, for the rent was long overdue
Schaap picked, up his few belongings and
his machine and went to live in a room
at No 346 East Fifty-Fourth Street

   There he stayed and worked on his ma-
chine for years Sometimes he found an
odd job, and made enough money to tide
him along, but most of the time he was
hammering, away in his room

   Very carefully he guarded his secret,
for nobody was ever allowed within his
door The fear that some one might steal
his invention always worried him

   One day in 1903, the landlady of the
place, who had noticed that the old man
had been growing very thin and white,
and had gone out very seldom for weeks,
went to his room to offer him some food
Receiving no answer to her knock, she
pushed the door open and caught a
glimpse of him in his big armchair, ga-
zing abstractedly at a machine that was
racing about his room

Weak Guardian of Nothing

  The next moment he caught sight of
her and, jumping to his feet and pointing
to the door, he shouted angrily, “ Go! ”

   But the kind-hearted landlady felt sure
that her lodger had not eaten for days,
and she appealed in his behalf to the Char-
ity Organization Society It was found
that the old man was sick and unable to
walk, and he was taken to Bellevue Hos-
pital He did not live very long after=
ward, and he died a pauper; but to his
last hour he held faith in his machine,
end)
|U,W 'A UR fifteen days the sidings
             at Bareen had been filling
             with all manner of cars
             The yards had become a
             sink into which all man-
             ner of freight drifted and
             stayed It was a real blockade

  Henderson, the yardmaster, whose duty
it was to keep the traffic moving, had
looked on the forming blockade with the
same feeling that another man might have
watched flames eating upon his fortunes
He knew that when a blockade becomes
absolute, a railroad quits the business of
transportation and goes to chopping off
heads and cleaning house His head was
on the block

  To make matters worse, Henderson had
no more to do with that blockade than you
or I Patterson, division superintendent
at Bareen, son-in-law to Old MacReady,
the general manager of the G and T ;
Patterson, whose only knowledge of his
position consisted in the fact that he had
authority and was the author of the
tangle

  Now, everybody in the employ of the
G and T knew that MacReady, who was
hard as flint, would have dared the hand
of God for the sake of Patterson And
Patterson had a habit of snatching up the

75

laurels from the brows of those below
and replacing them with the dunce-caps
that he himself had earned That was the
situation

  If Henderson had been a hereditary
yardmaster, as Patterson had been a he-
reditary superintendent, it wouldn’t have
made any difference That would simply
have been a ease of dog eat dog, and the
best one win, with perhaps the rare good
luck of both of them being eaten

  But Henderson had begun railroading
as a section-hand, and, having worked like
a horse for six years, he had won the pro-
motion of foreman Six more years, and
they made him a track inspector At that
rate, he would have been a thousand years
old before he got anywhere

  Of course, that shouldn't have made
any difference Henderson was only Hen-
derson Even if he had forgotten more
about railroading in any five minutes of
his railroad career than the average super-
intendent ever knew or ever would know ;
though he had a good brain, a good, brave
heart, and the will to lay down his life in
the day’s work, it should have satisfied
him to maul rail-spikes through all the
years of his prime, and then wind up his
days as a bridge-tender or a crossing flag-
man

THE BAREEN
BLOCKADE

BY J R STAFFORD

A Real Man Goes Through the Fire
Before He Is Admitted to Be Pure Gold
76

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  A man ought to be contented and keep
out of trouble But Henderson had not
been contented Having mastered the de-
tails of ever)' job of which he could learn
anything, lie had spent years wondering
why the deuce ignoramuses of twenty
years’ inexperience got to be heads of de-
partments

   At last the day arrived, as it always will,
when his knowledge came to his hand like
forgotten money in a cast-off suit of
clothes He rectified an error of Patter-
son’s that would have cost the G and '1'
the loss of two fast trains and damage-
suits for no telling how many human lives
Wherefore, on the day he was forty, he
had become yardmaster at Bareen

  What that promotion meant to Hen-
derson is not given all men to realize His
father was a cripple, and his mother old
and worn out, and he loved a woman who
returned his love and waited for him

  Of course, that was all nonsense He
could have sent the old people olT to the
poorhouse, and he and the woman could
have lived handsomely on a track inspec-
tor’s pay Or he could have been an op-
timist and married, and the whole family
could have got along swimmingly on his
forty dollars a month, unless something
happened to' him, when all of them could
have gone to the county farm

  As yardmaster, he was to draw better
than a hundred a month Was to draw,
because as yet he had not drawn pay on
the new job

  The blockade began the day after he
had assumed his new duties Now it was
all swept away He would be a dead dog
the minute Old MacReady arrived

  Pie would be dead everywhere, too for
the newspapers had made a sensation of
the blockade, and had featured it with
photographs and interviews with Patter-
son When the whole business was ended
on the G and T, his career as a rail-
roader would be finished

  Whenever Henderson thought of the
injustice of it he wanted to take a claw-
bar and beat the superintendent to deatli

  On the evening of the fifteenth day,
Old MacReady got down from a high-
speed engine in front of the switch shan-
ty and began giving impossible orders

  “ Take out those fruit-cars on siding
twenty-four, and send them back east
local”

  Siding twenty - four was a switch of
twenty-three, and twenty-three was full
clear up to twenty-two

  “ You mean,” Henderson corrected,
“ to take out the junk in twenty other
sidin’s first, so’s to git to twenty-four
What the deuce is to be done with them
thousand-odd cars that’s first got to be
moved  ”

  MacReady knew that well enough, any-
how Henderson should have bowed to
the position and kept his mouth shut to
the man Positions are to be respected

  He got proof positive of it next morn-
ing When he went up to the despatch-
er’s office for orders, he received his dis-
charge instead And while this was being
handed out to him he heard MacReady
dictating an interview for the papers
which would show that the blockade was
the fault of the yardmaster alone

  Henderson walked down the alley be-
tween two lines of cars reeling like a
drunken man There are poisons that in-
toxicate more terribly than whisky, and of
these he had drunk because he had been
forced to drink

  Coming to a certain point, he crawled
under many lines of cars, and came out on
the edge of the yards opposite a little cot-
tage that lay just beyond the right of way
It was his home that was not paid for
Now it would soon be some one else’s

  He looked beyond the cottage, up the
long slope on which Bareen the city stood
Bareen would be his no more, either He
went in, and his father asked him : “ What
will ye do now ”

  Yes, what would he do Hepderson
knew that when a man of forty loses his
trade, he goes either to the scrap-heap of
common labor or the dumps of crime

  Of course, that should not necessarily
be true A man should look on the bright
side of misfortune Bur he knew that he
was deserving, and that he had been com-
pelled to bear the stigma of another man’s
incompetence

  He knew that the good men who go
down under the ignorance of fools in
authority are numberless The point of
it pricked him to madness He got his
pistol and went back to the despatcher’s
office Patterson, white-faced and sneak-
ing, met him at the door x

  “ I’ve come to square things with ye,”
Henderson declared
THE BAREEN BLOCKADE

77

  MacReady jumped from his seat at the
despatcher's elbow and ran in between
“Square things!” he shouted “You’ve
tied the line, and now you threaten I’ll
have you locked up”

  “ I never tied the line The man that
says I did is a liar! ” And
Henderson shook his fist in
the general manager's face

  Now MacReady, for all
he had the stubbornness of a
mule, knew the difference be-
tween a bluff and a chal-
lenge So he made a show of
interest by asking, “ Then
who did do it ”

  “ You! ” the answer came
like a shot “You done it!

You put this dub in here
when you knowed what he
was You knowed he
wouldn’t do He made me
shunt through freight to the
back sidin’s the first day
and he kep’ it up

  “ You knowed he was a
fool who wanted all the
authority coming to him,
even to sayin’ how the
switchmen should trim and
set the lamps But that’s
neither here nor there

  “ It’s nothin’ to me that
he tied up the line I
couldn’t help it That was
your fault, and more yourn
than his But lemme tell ye,
it is his fault that he’s laid
the blame on me He’s a
low-lived cur, and you that
back him is no better”

  As he choked out the last
words, Henderson jerked his
pistol and fired pointblank at
Patterson’s head The shot
went wild, but the fist of fighting Old
MacReady went home on the point of
Henderson's jaw

  “ I’ll have you in the penitentiary for
this!” the general manager bellowed
“ Johnson, call the police! ”

  Now Johnson, the despatches knew a
great many things This was his answer:
“ Mr MacReady,if you arrest him, there’ll
have to be a trial If there’s a trial, the
facts will have to come out The facts
wHl hurt Patterson has ruined this fel-

low, and nothing else can be made of it
I’d have to swear to that”

  Being mundane, the affairs of men con-
sists in artions and corresponding reac-
tions Half the business of life with many
people consists in keeping one set of facts

in the spot-light and the other set clear off
the stage

  MacReady let go his hold on Hender-
son’s arm and collar, disarmed him, and
told him to make himself scarce In ex-
actly the same spirit the would-be slayer
slunk down the stairs and down the
gloomy alley of the cars toward home
He went into the house and, stumbling
into his own room, flung himself down on
his bed like a maimed dog come home to
his kennel to die
78

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  For a quarter of an hour he gazed dully
at the wall, and thought of nothing but
the cracking in the back of his head and
the clutch of the unseen hands upon his
throat Presently the quavering voice of
his father, repeatedly calling, aroused him
There was intensity in the old man’s voice

  He listened for
the words, and
caught, “The
yards are all
afire! ” With a
kind of grim hope
he jumped up
and ran out The
yards were hid-
den under black
clouds of rolling
smoke

  A gust swept
the murk toward
him, and his eyes
smarted from the
fumes He
smiled, for it was
pleasing to think
that MacReady
would have to an-
swer for a thou-
sand cars all
turned to scrap
and smoke Then
the gust steadied
to a blast, and
the paint on the
porch pillar at his
side blistered and
crinkled in the
driven heat

  He dashed into
the house, and
catching up his
father, carried him to the street that led
up the slope toward town His mother
followed him They had not gone half a
block when they looked back and saw the
roof smoke and then burst into flame

  A fire-engine dashed past, going whence
they had come It was followed by dense
crowds But Henderson had not made
two blocks when the same rabbl-e came
running back, and he heard them crying,
“ Bareen will be burned to 'the ground”

  The thought of it caught and held his
attention Bareen, the town he had loved
all his life, like him, was to be made a
sacrifice to the folly of the fools who ran

the G and T As he hesitated, a city fire-
man came running by Henderson
grabbed him by the arm and - demanded,
“ What are ye runnin’ for ”

   “ It’s a deatji-trap,” the man under the
helmet answered, “ an’ I hain’t a goin’ to
stay to git burned up The railroad com-

p’ny’s in a row
with their switch-
in’ help, and they
can’t git a wheel
turned to move
them cars The
town’s a burnin’
on this side It’s
sure death to stay
between” And
he d es e r t e r
 renclied himself
free -and dashed
away

 Henderson
looked back
where the smoke-
clouds, lifting for
a moment, dis-
closed that only
the cars of the
first siding were
on fire He beck-
oned a passing
townsman and
said to him:

  “ Mister, I’m a
goin’ back to bust
that blockade
Will ye see that
my ole daddy an’
my mother are
kept out of the
av a y of the
crowds an’ the
fire If I don’t make it back, they’ll be
some life-insurance coinin’ to ’em on me
I ask ye as one man to another’ll, to see
they git it” Before the other could an-
swer, he was gone

  Back he sped through the surging
crowds, and on past those devoted firemen
who would run not Fie saw that their
playing streams burst into steam-clouds
before they touched the walls, and he
knew that the heat before him was yet
more terrific	 -

  He dreAv a deep breath and plunged on
Fie stumbled blindly through his own
gate to the right of way, and he thought

of it as the gate to Hades He bounded
down a burning alleyway that would save
a quarter of a mile on the eternal way to
the roundhouse, and came out at last with
his clothing on fire

  Down the lee side of the inferno he
raced like an Olympic runner in the first
lap But at the end of his course, where 1
he should have received the cheers of
switchmen, he got nothing but the mock-
ery of locked doors and silence The
roundhouse was deserted

  Another man might have laid down
What could one man alone do He could
handle one engine and one string of cars,
and while he was doing that six other
strings of cars would be catching fire

  But Henderson had fought for six years
to become a section-foreman, and a man
who will do that lies down to no task the
issue of which is to be had in half an
hour He caught up a coupling-pin and
beat the padlock from the door of the first
stall

  Inside, 011 the ribs of the fan-shaped
floor, stood six engines, with fires all
banked and steam in the boilers running
low He opened drafts, started injectors,
shoveled coal, and then, taking a coal
hammer, went outside and smashed more
locks By the time the last door swung
open, the roundhouse was a pandemonium
of screeching safety-valves

  One by one, he ran the moguls out onto
the main track Coupling them together,
he shot down to the switch which opened
off to siding one The cars on that line
had by this time been burning for so long
a time that their beams and sills had
sagged clear down to the rails That
string could never be moved, and he knew
better than to waste time trying it

  He bumped onto the next switch, and
looked down the windrow of fire There
was no use trying that one either He was
now well into the breath of the conflagra-
tion  yet he knew he must penetrate more
deeply, and that the work, after he got
there, would be work for more than man

   But he steamed 011 down to siding three,
and, groping in the smudge, saw that the
sills of the cars on that string were as yet
intact, though all the woodwork above
was in a blaze He cut off his head en-
gine, ran down the main line, and then
backed up against the end of the burning
car

  The skin of his hands and the hair of
his head were gone when he finished that
coupling He got that string under way,
and then opened his throttle to the last
notch and jumped to the ground That
siding full of box cars went out of there
like a snake on fire

  Henderson grinned as it went by, and
bumped 011 down to siding four That
string was easier, for as yet the cars near
the end had not begun to burn As before,
he coupled up, made a big head of steam,
and when he had the mogul under way,
opened the throttle to the last notch, and,
jumping off, watched that section of the
conflagration speed off in the wake of the
first

  After that, his breath came easier, for
siding four was the last to open directly
to the main line Siding five opened from
four, six from five, and so on all the way
to twenty

  However, what had been done before
was boy's play to what must now be done
It was necessary to run far back into the
zone of the first of the fire, where the em-
ber-spewing debris of sidings one and two
threw out tremendous heat

  Now, when he backed his third engine
down to couple in on the string on five, he
knew there was no use trying it But he
hooked up and of course, stuck He got
down, and saw that half the sills were al-
ready sagging to the ties

  Then a draw-head pulled loose, and he
came bucking out with two cars Two
cars would not let him back to six He
slowed up and went back No coupling
could be made at all

  Now it was that Henderson yielded to
the last frenzy of his purpose He cut
loose, went back to the main line, and
hitched onto the other three engines
Having run them out onto the main line
beyond the switch to siding four, he went
back and set the other switches so that the
main line ran direct to five

  Then he got aboard, and ran down the
track for a quarter of a mile or more
There he stopped, and built such fires un-
der those boilers as would make steam
faster than any safety-valve could let it
off

  This done, he crawled up into the cab
of the head engine, reversed it, opened
the throttle to the last notch, and then, as
the giant went plunging back, he jumped
80

back and got to the next mogul behind
There he did the same thing Then he
made his way to the next one, and the
next and by the time he had reached the
last one, the four moguls in tandem were
sweeping back at forty miles an hour, and
every boiler straining at its rivet-heads

  Henderson sat in the head of his batter-
ing-ram, and pulled his throttle-lever to
the bracket to give her a little more steam
He was going to sweep that siding of its
gutted cars

  Of course, only fools court death in
such a fashion But once in a while a
fool jumps up, and the world for ten gen-
erations afterward wonders at him The
head tender crumpled the cab in which
Henderson sat, but siding five started and
went out, half of it dragging on the rails

  As for Henderson, some timber or
something struck and flipped him back
onto the coal Old MacReady and John-
son, sitting at the despatcher’s window,
looked out and saw him lying there as
the roaring skid of wreck toiled by them

  The two fell over each other going
down the stairs, and raced like a pair of
hounds till they caught the pilot of the
last of the toiling moguls Then they got
aboard and shut down

  By the time they had the last engine
under control, Henderson had regained
consciousness By that time, too, all the
switchmen who had refused to go out un-
der the boss appointed that morning had
gathered around

  MacReady yelled at them : “ Take these
engines and clean out those yards It’s
easy now”

  But even if it was easy, not a man
stirred until Henderson gave the order

  Nowadays, if you go anywhere on the
G and T, anybody can tell you all about
Henderson and the Bareen blockade
They cannot tell you much about Patter-
son, however, for small men, like small
coins, are soon spent and forgotten If
you will go to Bareen you will either find
Henderson in the superintendent’s' office,
which he now fills, or elseat his home

N Y CENTRAL’S NEW PENSION SCHEME

PRESIDENT W € BROWN, of the
New York Central and Hudson River
Railroad, lately announced that three of
the railroads in the Central system would
begin paying pensions to their retiring em-
ployees from the first day of this year

  The pension plan will affect about 100,000
of the employees of the Central and affiliated
lines It will involve the payment of about
$500,000 a year Employees of- the New
York Central and Hudson River Railroad
Company, the Lake Shore and Michigan
Southern Railroad Company, and the Michi-
gan Central Railroad Company, will1 be eligi-
ble under certain conditions for the pen-
sions under the present plan

  Employees of the Pittsburgh and Lake
Erie and the other lines of the Central
system will not be eligible

  Under the plan, as adopted, employees on
reaching the age of seventy years are re-
tired If they have been continuously in
the service of the company for at least ten
years immediately preceding their retire-
ment they will be entitled to a pension

  An employee who has been at least twenty
years in continuous service and has become
unfit for duty may be retired with a pension,
although he has not reached the age of
seventy years

  The amount of the pension, as explained,
is one per cent for each continuous year of
service of the employee’s average annual
wage during the ten years before his retire-
ment

  A conductor who has been earning $1,500
during the ten years before his retirement,
and who has been in the company's employ
for twenty consecutive years, would thus re-
ceive twenty per cent of his annual $1,500
salary, or $300 a year, for the rest of his
life If the same conductor had been thirty
years in the service he would get $450 a
year if he had been forty years in the com-
pany’s service he would get $600

  A brakeman who had been earning $900 a
year for ten years, and who had been twenty
years in the service, would get $180 a >ear
for the rest of his life

 A trainman who had reached the age of
seventy years, and who had been ten con-
secutive years in the service, would get
ten per cent of the average annual wage
which he had been receiving during that--
time

  The pension system will reach from the
lowest to the highest employee throughout
the Central system On January 1, 1,735
men were scheduled to receive old-age pen-
sions according to the plan

CHAPTER XIV
The Other Half

IN the happy silence his lips met
hers His arms held her close

  “ Oh, I am so glad! ” she
  whispered “ So glad ! ”

    And Jack could only kiss
her lips again But even in
her happiness she could not long forget
her errand Hastily she told him what
had happened—the decision to blow up
the sluices, her fruitless effort to keep
the men back

  “ And then I went to the stable and
got Freia and rode down to tell you,”
she ended

   Jack, by the light of the unbroken lan-
tern, glanced at the leathery flanks of
the mare He observed, for the first
time, that there was no saddle Fie made
no comment She had done no more
than he, knowing her, would have ex-
pected, but he shuddered as he thought
of the risks she must have run, and he
thanked God silently that she had come
through safely

  A light was bobbing down the bridle-
path Larry and Mary were coming
They stopped, amazed, a few feet away,
looking from the steaming horse to the
picture of a strange girl, with golden hair,
whose head lay 011 Jack’s shoulder

  “ Larry—Mary,” said Jack, “ this is
Tbekla Wist, who is to be my wife”

   Thekla raised her head She was neither
timid nor embarrassed — just frankly
happy Jack briefly told the story that
she had come to tell

   “ You mustn’t blame them too much,”
said Thekla earnestly “ They don’t un-
derstand”

   “ 1 don’t blame them at all,” replied
Larry “ I blame the persons who have
lied to them”

   Flis face looked very gray Fie and
Jack could understand now the full
subtlety of Briggs’s treachery No such
clumsy device as a strike was solely to
be relied upon to make the work fail
The purpose of the strike was merely to
get the workmen out of the way, in order
that a foul blowmight be aimed at the
dam itself

   They both felt as though they should
have guessed as much In the case of a
strike, with three days of leeway left to
them, Briggs would know that they might
pick enough men to finish the job 011
time Of course, he would have some
surer trick in his pocket, and it would be
impossible to prove any connection be-
tween Thomas Briggs, the Denver capi-
talist, and the mad suspicion of a group
of Norwegian farmers

  The end seemed to have come What
could they do to keep the men of the
valley from the dam To try to hold
them back with revolvers would be futile
and absurd Two men could not guard
all the sluices that dark night, and the
Norwegians were not the kind to be
easily frightened

  To reason with them What good
would that do They had already shown
that,they were not amenable to reason
Yet, to meet them as they came, and to
attempt to parley with them, was, after
all, the only plan that could be followed,

and, with no hope of success, that is
what they decided to do

  Presently they heard the distant rum-
ble of the wagons Louder and louder
it became, and Larry and Jack smiled at
each other, and at Thekla and Mary, in
a last grim effort at reassurance Jack
took out his broken shilling

  “ If there is such a thing as luck,” he
said, “ we’re goint to need it now”

  “ Hold on to it tight,” said Mary

  “ What is it, Jack” asked Thekla

  “ Just a lucky piece Do you want to
go to the shack, out of view, before the
wagons come”

  “ I want to stay here, near you, Jack”
  He kissed her, without shame

  So the wagons came rattling around
the nearest curve, and at sight of the bar-
rier and the two men and two women
who stood before it the driver reined in
his teams

  “Let me start things,” said Jack to
Larry “but be ready to get into the
game if I make any breaks”

  Tack, therefore, stepped forward and
called: “Mr Wist!”

  The Norwegians were already getting
to the ground, and at the sound of Jack’s
voice, Peter Wist shouldered his way to
the front His glance fell angrily on
Jack Then he saw Thekla advancing
to Jack’s side, and he started

  “ Thekla! ” he muttered

  “ Yes, father! ” she answered bravely
“ Wait, dear! ” Jack whispered Then
he addressed himself again to the lower-
ing man before him

  “ Mr Wist,” he began quietly, “ we
know why you have come There are
not enough men in the camp to oppose
you But before you do what you have
planned to do, I want to tell you some-
thing I want you to hear the real rea-
son why you have been made to believe
that our company meant to injure you
That’s a fair request, isn't it”

  Peter Wist did not answer at once
Outraged by what he considered his
daughter’s treachery, bewildered by the
fact of her presence, he hardly heard
Tack’s words How had Thekla, whom
he had left at the house, managed to
get to the dam ahead of the wagons

  Then Freia whinnied, somewhere in
the darkness near by and Peter Wist un-
derstood He realized that the girl had

 ridden the mare through the night, slip-
 ping by the wagons somewhere along the
 road, and had come at the risk of her
 own- life to warn her lover against her
 father

   He realized that his victory over Jack
 Marly that afternoon in the field—was
 it only a day ago—had been a sorry
 victory after ail He even realized that
 from now 011 Thekla was committed by
 her own act to consider her lover first,
 her father second The pain of these
 revelations was sharp in him

   The men were beginning to murmur
 “Will you listen to me Jack re-
 peated

   “ To the dam! ” shouted Ole Knudsen
 hoarsely His dull eyes had flamed with
 rage at the sight of Thekla

   Others among the Norwegians took up
 - the cry: “To the dam! To the’dam! ”
 Peter Wist had felt no change in his
 resolution He had himself been at the
 point of ignoring Jack and Larry, ignor-
 ing his daughter, and pushing on to the
 sluices but unruliness among his fol-
 lowers was something that he would not
 brook As they surged around him,
 threatening to hurry on without authority,
 he turned to them and ordered them back

   ‘‘ Be silent!” lie cried “There is
 time enough We will hear what this
 man has to say”

   “ Don’t listen to him! ” yelled Ole
 Knudsen rushing forward “ Thekla
 lias bewitched him ! Come on, men! ”
 Peter Wist did not hesitate One step,
 and his huge fist caught the oncoming
 rebel squarely 011 the mouth and sent him
 staggering back

   “ There! ” shouted Wist, stamping
 with rage “ Will you disobey me Be
 silent, all of you!” He glared at his
 men Two' of them were holding Ole
 Knudsen Then he turned again to
 Jack

   “ Say what you have to say, but say
 it quickly,” he ordered

   “ Mr Smith and I ”—Jack indicated
 Larry by a nod—“ own, between us, a
 half interest in this property The other
 half is owned by Aaron Garth Do you
 know Aaron Garth, Mr Wist”

   “ Yes, I know him”

   “ Do vou know that he is a hard
 man”

   “ Yes 1 know that”
THE DAM-BUILDERS

  “ To get the money to build the dam,”
Jack went on, “ we had to mortgage this
property to a friend of Aaron Garth’s
We knew that we should not be able to
pay the mortgage when it fell due, and
he said that he would renew it, if—” he
paused, to make his facts impressive—
“ if we would have all our work done by
the date when the mortgage comes due
That date is one week from to-day”

  “ This has nothing to do with us,” ex-
claimed Wist

  “Wait! We have found that the man
who holds our mortgage is a bad man
He wanted us to think that he would
renew the mortgage He talked fair, but
really he wants us to fail, so that he can
foreclose the mortgage, and thus get pos-
session of our property for a great deal
less than it is worth

  “ He has secretly interfered with our
work We have reason to 'think that he
bribed our contractor to slow down just
when we needed to hurry We have rea-
son to think that he hired a labor leader
to come here and persuade the workmen
to strike To-night we are without la-
borers, and unless the dam is finished by
next Saturday, Mr Smith and 1 are
ruined

  “Now, there is one other thing: we
have reason to think that the rumor that
we planned to flood your valley was start-
ed by our enemy, just to make you angry,
so that you would do what you intended
to do to-night If you destroy the sluices,
you will be doing his work”

  “ Is that all” asked Wist He seemed
to be unmoved

  “ Not quite! Mr Wist, your daughter
Thekla is going to be my wife Do you
think that 1, bound to you by such a tie
loving her who loves you—do you think
that I would stand for the flooding of
your farm”	

  Wist shrugged his shoulder

  “ If you help to ruin us, our enemy
will have possession of the dam You
will find him a worse man to deal with
than we are”

  Wist made an impatient movement

“ You have said enough ! ” he exclaimed

“ What we know, we know You are the
robbers and destroyers, not we Come,
men! ”

  They surged up about their leader,
these vikings of the modern age They

were hot and eager The flames of their
rage burned brightly Jack, disheart-
ened, stood back He had done all that
he could do Even Larry, who had kept
himself in the background, realized that
no more could wisely be said

  But Thekla, with exalted courage,
moved forward to bar the way Jack
drew her back “ Don’t,” he whispered
“ It’s no use Let them go”

  “ Oh, they must not—they must' not! ”
she sobbed “ For their own sake, too,
they must not! ”

  Jack smiled sadly “Luck is against
us, dear,” lie said “ I had thought that
there might be something in luck for us
See what 1 have held in my hand all the
time” He showed the broken shilling in
his left palm “ It did no good Now,
I will throw it away”

  His motion was arrested Thekla had
clutched his wrist With staring eyes,
she bent over the broken coin “Father!”
she cried “Father! Quick!”

  Peter Wist involuntarily halted and
looked His daughter had snatched
something from Jack Marly’s hand She
was holding it up between her thumb and
finger Her eyes were wild with excite-
ment

  “ The other half of the shilling! ” she
cried “ The other half of the shilling! ”
With a hoarse cry, Wist seized the coin
and dropped to his knees beside a lantern
Presently he began plucking at his throat
He got hold of a string, and drew from
its place of concealment under his Shirt
a small leather bag, polished smooth by
years of contact with his skin

  Tremblingly he opened it zfiid took
out a bit of tarnished silver Jack, bend-
ing down, saw that it was a fragment of
a coin

  The two pieces lay together in the
Norwegian’s palm He pushed them
together The broken edges fitted, to
form one perfect circle

  Wist, closing his hand on the shilling,
got slowly to his feet His face was
working strangely, and he fixed his burn-
ing eyes on Jack’s

  “Where did it come from” he de-
manded “ How7 did it get to your
hands”

  “ I found it”

  “ But where did you find it Who
lost it”

THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE

  Jack dreaded to speak If the coin
were an old token of friendship between
Peter Wist and Thomas Briggs, the situa-
tion might be the worse for its discovery
Wist might realize, from what he had al-
ready heard, that to injure the dam would
be to help the man to whom the other
half of the coin had belonged

  Hesitating, Jack looked at Thekla It
would be a simple thing to say that he
did not know who had lost the coin Wist
would not know that he really knew
Thekla would not know But he could
not look into her blue eyes and tell the
lie harmless though it seemed

  “Where did you get it” Wist whis-
pered The man was tense with emo-
tions which he was struggling to control

  “ I saw a man drop it, and I picked
it up and kept it”

  “ Who was the man Who was he
“ The man was the holder of the mort-
gage on this property—my enemy”

  “ His name! His name! ”

  “ Thomas Briggs”

  Peter Wist exclaimed aloud, and raised
his shaking hand

  “ Your enemy! ” he cried “ Your en-
emy, and nunc! ”

CHAPTER XV
The Turn of the Tide

T T IS hand grasped Jack's arm “ Your
enemy—and mine ' he repeated
“ My son, I believe you now! 1 believe
you now! Back, men! We will not
touch the dam! This man has spoken
truth to us He has proved it! ”

  His excited authority, his unusual ve-
hemence, drove the Norwegians to won-
der They clustered around him cu-
riously—among them Ole Knudsen, who
evidently had accepted the leader’s disci-
pline, though from the row of his yellow
teeth one was missing, where Wist's
knuckle had struck They muttered ex-
citedly in Norse, for many of them had
known the history of the token that hung
about Peter Wist’s neek

  Several minutes of confusion passed
before Thekla was able to get her father’s
attention At last, however, she pointed
out to him that Jack did not know the
meaning of this sudden change of heart
Then, tensely Peter Wist told the story

in his clean, straight English, without
faltering once

  “ When I was your age,” lie said to
Jack “ 1 came to tiie Western mountains
to hunt for a fortune I met another lad
—a sharp-faced, wiry lad—named Thom-
as Briggs We became friends and part-
ners

  “ Each of us had saved a few hundred
dollars, and, putting the money all to-
gether, we went to a new mining-camp
and opened a restaurant We made much
money—more than the majority of the
seekers after gold At the end of a year
we had six thousand dollars hidden safely
away

  “ Thomas Briggs was an English boy
He had a shilling which he carried for
luck When we became partners, he
broke the shilling into two pieces and
gave me one, and we swore to keep them
as tokens that we would be faithful to
each other I made this leather bag, and
put my half of the shilling in it Ever
since have I worn it

  “ Then the camp began to play out
The gold-hunters were drifting away
So we made less money, and at last we
decided to stop our restaurant and go to
another place

  “ Then, when I woke up one morning
Thomas Briggs was gone 1 went to the
place where we had hid our money The
money was gone, too”

  He stopped, and for some time busied
himself with his own grim thoughts

  “ I have trusted no man since,” he
added at last “ I have always worn mv
token to remind me that I must trust no
man Many years later, I found Thomas
Briggs in Denver He was rich

  “ When I went to his house and asked
him for the money he had stolen, he
laughed He said I could not prove that
lie had stolen it So 1 struck him He
had his servants throw me out of the door

  “After that I wanted to kill him but
that would not do, and I tried to forget
everything except that no man could be
trusted I went back to Minnesota, and
manv years later I came here That is
all

uncommon, perhaps but in the slow rev-
olutions of the vlieel of Fate justice
eventually is done

CHAPTER XVI
On the Dam

'T'HEKLA had drawn her father
aside They were talking in low
tones—she, all eagerness, while he ap-
parently listened at first with doubt and
reluctance, and gradually began to nod
his agreement with what she was saying

   She called to Jack and when he had
stepped over to where she and her father
stood, she said: “ The men of the valley
will finish the dam for you, Jack”

  “Can they do it” Jack was amazed
at this turn of the situation

  “ We know how to mix cement and
build walls,” said Peter Wist “ If you
will tell us where to lay the stones, we
will place them as you wish”

   Larry was summoned His face light-
ed up when the news was given to him,
but he shook his head disappointedly as
he made a rapid count of the men avail-
able “ Thirty-five only,” he muttered

“ It would take fifty men five days”

“ I can get more men,” said Wist

“ These can remain here—all except one
Him I must send back to the valley to
look after matters there You can give
us the tents where your men have slept,
and to-morrow morning we can begin
work I myself will go to my people at
Larkin City, and they will help”

   Thus it was ordered Ole Knudsen was
sent back to the valley The other men
took up the quarters which the strikers
had left vacant They were at first in-
clined to grumble, but the promise of
high pay made them quiet

   Late into the night Larry talked with
Peter Wist He showed him the maps
and charts ' Without great difficulty,
now that suspicion had been killed, he
made it plain that the farms of the Nor-
wegians were not to be endangered

  Meantime, Thekla and Jack wandered
together up and down the lower road
The heavy clouds had been blown away
by a wind, and the stars gave them light
enough to see the gladness in each other’s 1
eyes as they said sweet words over and
over again

   It was late when he took her up to the
shack and gave her over to Mary Nev-
ertheless, he returned alone to the lower
road, and for an hour retraced the steps
he had taken with her

  In the morning the work began The
sturdy Northmen, adapting themselves to
the more or less unfamiliar labor, went
at it with a vim that raised the hopes of
Larry Jack had insisted on taking his
place among them Larry oversaw the
work, with the help of Jones and Armsby
and Ives, who had returned

   In the afternoon Peter Wist came back
from Larkin City with the wagons loaded
down with forty more Norwegians—all
eager for the double pay O’Neill had
tried to stop them, but they would not
listen to him

   So the work fared 011 through the early
days of the week The engines puffed,
the great derricks swung their burdens
into the air, and hammer and trowel
clinked merrily

  On Monday Bill Murdock appeared,
threatening trouble because Larry was
using his camp outfit and his tools Larry
drove him off with a threat of a thrash-
ing

  On Tuesday morning came Aaron
Garth, with uneasy protests against the
way things were going The hint of a
suit for conspiracy sent him hurrying
back to town

  The same afternoon came O’Neill At
Peter Wist’s command, half a-dozen Nor-
wegians left their work long enough to
throw him into the stream, whence he
emerged much sobered, to make his wet
way down the canon

   Meantime, course after course was laid
on the dam, until when work stopped
Wednesday night Larry announced that
half a day would see all done

  Thekla and Mary had found plenty to
do On Monday Thekla had ridden up
to the valley to get her medicine-case and
her surgical instruments Where many
men are at work, accidents will happen,
and she found considerable use for her
rolls of bandages

  Mary supervised the camp kitchen, in
which Wing Fal} showed himself general
and army in one Indeed, there were no
idlers in the camp

  Thursday morning the men streamed
up to their work with evidences of the
86

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

excitement they felt The spirit of the
battle against time had penetrated them,
and they were a unit in their interest and
enthusiasm

  Overnight Larry had had the sluices
closed, and the water was beginning to
collect behind the dam but even the
widening lake between them and the val-
ley did not arouse the dead suspicions of
the Northmen They were keyed to their
fight to get the work done

  Stone by stone the last course was laid
The derricks creaked and groaned The
men grunted and panted Stone by
stone! And ever the lake behind the dam
grew longer

  The sky was clear, the sun was hot, the
sweat rolled down the faces of the toiling
men, but they ran to and fro with ex-
hausting eagerness Three hours longer
—two hours—one hour—

  At half past eleven the last stone was
ready to be dropped into its position
Larry — a relieved smile on his face —
raised his hand

  “ Jack! ” he called

  All wet and grimy Jack came forward
“ This is your job,” said Larry “ You
must lay the last stone”

  Jack shook his head “ That’s for you
old man I’m only a private”

  “ But I insist”

  “ Then let Mary do it”

  “If you say Mary and Thekla I will
agree,” replied Larry

  Mary and Thekla therefore, spread
the mortar As the stone sank into place,
thej7 stepped upon it, and the men broke
into a loud cheer

  The dam was finished

  Jack and Larry threw their arms
around each other They had won
Thekla and Mary came to them, tears of
joy in their eyes

  Half a mile down the canon a dusty
buggy was coming at a rapid speed A
large, uneasy man, a bunch of a beard on
his chin, was urging tlie horse on with
constant flicks of the whip Aaron Garth
never spared a horse—or a man, if he
had the chance to drive him

  The man beside him sat with com-
pressed lips His hatchet-face was-gray,
as though he had slept poorly of late

  “ What is that noise ” he asked 

  “ They are cheering”

  “Oh! ”

  “ It looks as though they’d done us
Briggs

  Briggs did not answer

  “ I never knew luck to fail so Gid-
dap there! We got those farmers all
excited They came down to blow things
up they remained to finish the work”

  “ And those that came to scoff re-
mained to pray'” muttered Briggs

  “ What’s that ”

  “ Nothing”

“ What are you going to do, Briggs”
“How do 1 know” Briggs sighed
faintly “ I’m not used to being beaten
Perhaps they have overlooked some-
thing”

  “ Guess we can’t depend on that
Briggs Giddap, there ! We might have
something smashed before Saturday”

  “ It wouldn’t do us any good if the
work is already completed”

  “ I hope you don’t think we haven't
been doing what we could at our end ol
the line”

  “ I think you were up against some
better men Garth Oh, there might be
ways of beating them yet I could trick
them on their bond issue, perhaps, but
I don’t believe it’s worth while”

  “ What’s that”

  “Never mind! The last time I was
here I lost something that I had carried
with me for years”

  “Valuable Giddap there!”

  “Not intrinsically! But—” He be-
came silent

  Garth jerked the foaming horse to a
stand at the gate of the corral, but Mad-
den had gone up to the dam and Garth
had to hitch the animal himself Then
the two men went slowly on, afoot They
could see the workmen standing in groups
011 the broad top of the great gray wall

  “ Who are the two women, do you
suppose” asked Briggs

  “ Larry Smith’s wife, for one, the
other T can’t guess Some friend of
hers I suppose Smith and Marly are
with ’em”

  As the newcomers got to the top of
the dam, Jack caught sight of them He
seized Larry’s elbow and wheeled him
around “Great Heavens!” he ex-
claimed “ Look! ”

  Larry started “ Wist mustn’t see
him” he whispered, as he and Jack
moved forward

  “ How do you dor Mr Smith—and
Mr Marly ” Briggs was cold and pre-
cise as ever “ I see that you have fin-
ished the dam”

  “ Yes,” replied Larry coldly

  “ I—I congratulate you,” said Briggs
“ You have done a big thing 1 shall be
glad to have you go in with me on my
Utah enterprise”

  Larry did not reply The significance
of his silence, however, was not lost

  'A faint, ironic smile appeared on the
capitalist’s face, and he said:

  “ May I ask how you managed to
convert the lions into lambs How you
induced the men who came to destroy
your work to remain and finish it”

  “ When you were here before, Mr
Briggs,” said Jack, “you lost some-
thing”

  “Yes” said Briggs, wondering

  “ A piece of a shilling, Mr Briggs”
  1,1 Yes Did you find it”

  “ A lucky piece of a lucky shilling! ”

  “ Yes I have missed it”

  “ Well, Mr Briggs, see if this ex-
plains anything to you : The leader of
the lions who came to destroy our work
is the man who for thirty-five years has
carried the other half of that shilling”
“ Peter ! ” gasped Briggs

  “ Yes, Peter Wist,” said Jack sternly
“ And if you value your life, you will not
let him see you”

  “Where is he” asked Briggs

  “ He is back there with his daughter”
Swiftly Briggs darted away, straight
toward his enemy Larry and Jack fol-
lowed on the run They expected noth-
ing short of murder Briggs hurried to
the place where Wist was standing
“Peter!” he called

  The Norwegian turned like a flash
He towered above Briggs, and the em-
bers of old rage blazed in his face

  “ I have searched for you for years,
Peter,” said Briggs “ That night when
I had you put out of my house—I wish
you had come back”

  “What do you mean” Wist's voice
was only a strangled whisper,

  “ I mean that then, when you had
gone, I realized for the first time that
things would never be right with me,
until 1 had made things right with you”
“ You are my enemy,” exclaimed Wist,
shaking free as Thekla grasped his arm

  “ No, Peter, I am my own” There
was no question of Briggs’s earnestness
PI is hands were shaking his voice was
uncertain “ Believe me or not, you are
the one man I ever cared for When I
wronged you, it'hurt me worse than it
ever hurt you, but not until you had
been put out of my house that night,
did I begin to understand

   “ Not until then, and I set aside the
money I had taken from you It has
been growing all these years at compound
interest It is yours, Peter I have done
many things that were not worth while,
but they all trace back to the wrong I
did to you”

   Peter Wist studied the face of his old
partner Long he gazed

   “ I guess it is so,” he said at last “ I
have been happier than you, Tom—and I
will be happier now if—if I forgive
you”

   Future biographers of Thomas Briggs,
the money-captain, may not record it,
but when he heard those words from the
lips of Peter Wist, his eyes became wet

  That evening, while the afterglow
still tinged the sky, a formal, precise
capitalist sat in long converse with a
Norwegian farmer And at the doer of
their shack Larry and Marv, well con-
tent, gazed musingly down at the sturdy
wall of masonry which stood for more
victories than one

  “ See Jack and Thekla down there,
walking arm in arm,” laughed Larry
“What children they are!”

  “Dear,” she whispered, “are we not
ourselves children of that kind”

  And Larry’s answer was to draw her
closer to him

luck I managed to read them all Then
I would buckle down to the typewriter

own T F had a brass bed in his state-
room and 1 had a big room all to my-
self—that is, when he wasn’t calling me
out of it Nobody around to bother us 
once in a while T F would talk about
places he had been, and tell stories about
the road

   I’ve been out with him a-couple of times
since then, and am beginning to get used
to it Connolly told me that T F 'Said
I was a pretty good stenographer

   I don’t wonder people like him, dad
Pie's a man, all the way through True,
he cusses a great deal, but he doesn’t mean
cussing for anything bad  it’s just his way
of expressing his feelings

   People would come out 011 the line

JIM TO THE OLD MAN

         EAR DAD : Since I wrote you
            last there has been lots do-
            ing Bigby, T F’s secre-
            tary, was taken ill some
            time ago and had to go
            home He developed a case
            of typhoid-fever, and was laid up for over
            two months

  In the meantime, T F had to go out
on the line, and you can imagine how
surprised I was when Connolly told me
I was to go out with him Pleased! If
f had had a couple of feathers in my
bonnet I believe I would have floated
away

  We went out for three days the first
time And say, dad, you talk about
work! When I wasn’t busy working, I
was busy hunting up some work to do
When I wasn’t busy hunting for work,
it was because I was too busy working

  T F would give me dictation at the
rate of a' mile a minute while we were
on the road It’s hard enough having to
write at a desk in an office at that speed,
and it was kind of piling on the agony
having to write thirty to fifty letters in
LETTERS OF AN OLD RAILROAD MAN AND HIS SON 89

there’s a surprise coming for you, dad
They’ve raised my salary! You know I
started in on sixty-five dollars Well,
when Bigby came back, they put my sal-
ary to seventy dollars

  I commenced to thank Connolly for it,
but lie told me to shut up I wasn’t get-
ting paid for anything more than I had
done, and the road had done it, not he

  That’s what I like about Connolly He
looks at things differently from most peo-
ple Some other man would have talked
about me working harder, now that he had
shown his confidence in me, and try to
show him by my work that 1 deserved
the raise, and a whole lot of stuff like

was coming to me in order to pacify me
All this because some chief clerk had
talked as if he had done the whole thing

  You hear so much stuff like that here,
dad Up in the car service department,
particularly

  There is a fellow up there named Max-
well lie worked for about ten years |it
a salary of about seventy-five dollars a
month One day lie got a raise of five
dollars He almost fainted

  After he could think without his head
going around, lie went up to Claire, his
chief clerk, and commenced to thank him
for it, getting wilder each minute until
he almost flopped on his knees When

go back to the office, even though it was
hard work out on the line It somehow-
felt different, although really it wasn't
But when you are alone with the general
manager, you think he sees you can do
good work, and you try hard to do bet-
ter work than you usually do, so lie will
notice it

  I’ve settled down again now But

that—trying to make me feel it was due
to him that I had been raised—and I
would have gone away feeling that he
was lying, and that I got it because I de-
served it

  Then, after a while, 1 would begin to
think that the reason I got a raise was
because they wanted me to stay with the
road, and that they gave me part of what

he got through, Claire commenced to talk
to him about how he had recognized his
ability by giving him the raise, and that
he hoped he would repay his confidence
in him by doing much better work than
he had done

  He talked to Maxwell for about fifteen
minutes in that strain, until Maxwell be-
gan to feel angry because Claire took all
the credit to himself When he got
through, Maxwell turned on him

  “ Mr Claire,” he said, “ God has been
mighty good to me in putting a man like
you in this office I used to think we had
a superintendent of car service here, but
now I see that I was mistaken”

  “What do you mean” asked Claire,
feeling proud at the compliment

  “ I mean this,” said Maxwell “ I
made an ass of myself slopping over to
you that way I thought 3'ou would see
it was merely the surplus gratitude run-
ning over, and that it was intended for
the road, not yourself”

  Claire was at first astonished, and then
he began to get angry

  “ You are confounded impudent, young
man,” he yelled “ I guess you don’t
need that money, anyhow Come to,think
of it, you’d better write out your resigna-
tion, and I’ll accept it”

  Maxwell grinned “ ICs worth it,
Claire I’ve found out I’m a man, at
last”

  When Connolly told T F about it,
T F’s eyes twinkled I was banging
away on the typewriter, and they didn’t
know I heard what they said

  “ Good for the boy,” said T F “He’ll
make his mark now”

  “ Will you take him back  ” asked
Connolly

  “ Certainly not In the first place,
that’s up to the auditor: if I did, it would
make bad feeling”

  Connolly nodded “ I know Lots of
men in that department are like that, but
they can’t speak up as Maxwell did be-
cause they have families to support”

  “ We only live this life once,” said
T F “ Some of us try to make the best
of it, but others try to change it to suit
themselves No man need put himself
in that position if he looks at life through
the right kind of glasses”

  I have been saving up a little since I
came here Got one hundred and twenty

dollars in bank now going some, isn’t
it And yet, when I see so many young
fellows right in the B and D, who are
holding down big jobs because they’ve
got pull, somehow it doesn’t seem fair
to me

  When one of these fellows born with’
a golden spoon in his mouth comes along
and takes precedence over everybody ill
the neighborhood, there’s a feeling that
the other fellows aren’t treated right, and
somehow they aren’t as enthusiastic as
they might be with their work, and are
apt to find fault with the road they are
working for

  It’s only human nature

THE OLD MAN TO JIM

T~EAR JIM : You don’t remember John
Right, of course He was way be-
fore your time John’s father was a farm-
er, who brought up his son farming John
never did like it, so one day he ran away
from home

  I didn’t see him again for five years,
when he turned up again in pretty bad
shape He had tried almost everything,
but was too honest with himself to stick
at it He told me he was going to search
until lie found the kind of work he want-
ed to do

  I laughed at John then for I figured
if a man had a job, it was better to hold
011 to it, and make up his mind he want-
ed it, than to give it up and try for some-
thing he didn’t know anything about

  Well, anyway, John drifted off again
I11 the meantime, I had gone with the
B and D, and was in charge of the
roundhouse at Cumberland One day I
was up in Chicago 011 a vacation, when
I plumped into John on the street He
was looking pretty prosperous, and, after
we had talked a while, I asked him what
he was doing

  He said that he had at last got some-
thing to do that he liked He was a re-
porter on a newspaper He’d been with
the paper for two months but the way he
talked about the newspaper business made
me feel as if I ought to take off my hat
whenever I bought one

  He had me believing before he got
through that it was the holiest kind of an -
enterprise that had ever been set up in
LETTERS OF AN OLE) RAILROAD MAN AND HIS SON 91

the public market-place, and was the voice
of alfree people speaking out when every-
thing else on earth was deaf, dumb, and
blind And just about ten minutes before
I met John I was cussing them for being
the yellowest, meanest bunch of liars that
ever hit the pike

  Well, anyway, 1 was mighty glad to
hear that John had landed at last, and 1
got him to take me up to his
office It was a big room, with
a row of desks around the wall,
and typewriters scattered
about

  There was a bunch of young
fellows in it, smoking and wri-
ting, and John made me sit
down in a corner of the room
with him and talk over old
times While we was sitting
there, somebody in another of-
fice hollered something, and
John jumped up and rushed
away In a minute he came
back

  “ I’ve got an assignment,

Billy,” he says “ Come along
with me and see how a re-
porter gets a story”

  1 had a little time on my
hands, and thought I might
as well use it up that way as
any I hadn’t yet got over my
surprise to see John doing that
kind of work

  Well, at any rate, we mo-,
seyed around, and John talked
to several people about some-
thing or other, and they sent
him to other people, who
talked about it another way,
and finally I went back to the office, and
he pecked away at a typewriter for a little
while and turned in his story

  We were sitting, chatting, in a corner
of the room when a man came out of an
inner office He had a piece of paper in
his hand

  “Where’s Right” he bawled Then
he saw him “ Look here Right,” he
said, “ what do you call this

  John got red, but stood up “ What's
the matter, Mr Martin” he asked

  “Matter!” yelled Martin “What's
this stuff you wrote here Do you call
that a news story” He shook the piece
of paper in his hand at John

  “ I don’t see anything wrong with this,
Mr Martin,” said John

  “ Of course you don’t! ” yelled Mar-
tin “What you ought to do is to go
back to the farm, instead of working for
a newspaper”

  Well, sir that would have made any
man mad 1 know I clenched my fist my-
self and wondered whether it wouldn’t

WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO IS
TO CO BACK TO THE FARM”

be a good idea to give him a punch for
luck John walked to the door and flung
back his head

  “ I’ll tell you this much, Martin,” he
said “ I’ll be managing editor of this
newspaper when you will have to go to
work on a farm yourself to make a liv-
ing”

  That was piling it on strong, wasn’t it
Chicago was a mighty big place, and
John was a mighty small ant in it But
John had enthusiasm Fie loved his
work He wasn’t in it for money as much
as for the liking he had for it

  He stayed with that paper until the
week was out then he went with another
92

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

newspaper He worked with them for
about two years, and finally began to turn
in Work that was the real thing

  Then a reorganization of the paper
came, and John was made city editor
He held that job about four years, and
went on another paper in a higher posi-
tion, stayed with them for a while, and
finally darned if he didn’t get the offer
of managing editor of his first paper!

  In the meanwhile, Martin had gone on
another paper, and also had been made
managing editor of that but just about
the time John got his big job, Martin’s
paper changed hands, tod Martin was
thrown out of work

 I was in Chicago again then, and
dropped in John’s office at the time it
happened John had dictated this letter
to Martin when I came in:

   My Dear Martin—Fifteen years ago
  you told me that I ought to go back to
  work on the farm, instead of working
  for a newspaper I now beg to inform
  you that I am owner of a farm in
  southern Illinois-which is in good shape,
  and well kept

    As you are no doubt looking for work,

  I offer you the position of superintend-
  ent of it You should be able to make
  a fairly good living from it, if you are
  competent enough Please let me hear
  from you promptly Sincerely, John
  Right, Managing Editor

  I didn’t see John until about a year
after Then he told me that Martin had
got furious when he received the letter,
and had sat down and wrote a note to
the owner of John’s paper, who was a
personal friend of his, enclosing the let-
ter, and requesting that John be fired
The proprietor of the paper simply re-
ferred the note to John, and it ended
there

  The beauty of this is that it’s true
And the particular point I want to bring
out is tliat enthusiasm got John the posi-
tion of managing editor True, he had
to have something besides enthusiasm
He had to know the business But he
would never have known it if he hadn’t
had the enthusiasm

  There were probably three thousand
other young reporters like him in that
city, some with influence, some without,
but the majority of them with a better
education than he had It was simply a

case of a man finding the work he liked
best, and making good in it

  To-day, John Right is managing editor
of one of the cleanest newspapers in the
country in a city not two hundred miles
from Chicago, known from one end of
the country to the other, and one of the
most popular men in his city

  You say that that’s not railroad work
All right, then I’ll tell you about an-
other John This John was named Dick-
erson Pat Niff, in your office, knows
him well for Pat was holding down the
wire at Martinsburg when Dickerson was
superintendent of the I and F Central
division

  In those days the B and D was being
managed by a bunch of men who knew as
much about railroading as a cat knows
about singing They had rolling-stock
out on the line, standing on sidings
months at a time

  Engines w'ere tied up on branch lines,
freight-cars were getting lost and wan-
dering away, and, altogether, the old B
and D was in about as bad a position as
any road could be and not go in the re-
ceiver’s hands Finally it got so bad it
did go in the receiver’s hands

  The man who managed it then was
named Murray His initials are O G
As soon as he was appointed receiver, he
sent a tel gram to John Dickerson, of the
I and F, to report for duty at Baltimore

  Dickerson had a mighty good job at
the time, for he was one of the best all-
round men 111 the country He declined
to come That must have go(t the Old
Man’s dander up, for he sat down and
wrote this to John Dickerson:

  Me John Dickerson:

    I wired you the position of general
  manager of the B & D ten days ago,
  and you have declined it I now offer
  you the position at double the salary
  previously offered, payable in advance
  Do you want it Answer qufek—

  O G M

  Now, John Dickerson was a pretty
shrewd man He had been watching the
B and D for a long while, and saw that
the real fault with the road was that the
higher officials had tried to meddle too
much in the actual running of it, and
there had been a good deal of “ favorite
sons ” placed in fat jobs without regard
LETTERS OF AN OLD RAILROAD MAN AND HIS SON 93

HE LEFT JOHN DICKERSON TO RUN IT, AND JOHN RAN IT

to their ability to run it So back came
this wire to the Old Man:

    If you will place me in entire control
  of the road, with authority to discharge
  and appoint whom I may see fit, without
  any one being given power to cancel my
  orders, I will accept

  It took O G M about three minutes
to answer that And all he said was,
“ Come” Well, John came'

  The first thing he did, he fired the
general superintendent of the eastern
division, the general superintendent of the
middle division, four superintendents, six
trainmasters, two yardmasters and about
fifteen other officials

  But there was a Man in the receiver's
chair He just kept on going after
money to finance the road, and left John
Dickerson to run it And John ran it
He sent to Pittsburgh and got two of his
old men there, got three more from the
Pennsy, and gathered about two more in
The rest of the positions he had open
he filled by promotion

  And then the rolling-stock began In

move John was up and down the line,
night and day He left a trail of enthu-
siasm behind him wherever he went En-
gines began to move Passengers began
to come Freight began to pour into the
terminals John was everywhere, and his
men worked with him like all get-out

  The Old Man, up in New York, fight-
ing hard to get money to keep the road
alive,’ began to find things getting easier
From being known as the worst road in
the country, the B and D began to be
known as “ not so bad, after all” It
was hard to live down the reputation that
had been put on her—in fact, to this day,
it’s a joke in Pittsburgh that if you want
to leave there the worst way, you must
take the B and D—but she fought up,
and pretty soon began to show her head
once more and perk up

  John fairly made things hum If a
man worked hard, good He was right
in line for promotion, and got it too
If he wasn’t able to work hard, out with
him

  John Dickerson put life into the old
road when it was fairly at Us last gasp
94

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  He did what any other railroad man
in the country would have declared im-
possible He did it because he was en-
thusiastic He knew the B and D was
the natural outlet for one of the best sec-
tions of coal and grain country in the
United States The rails were there, and
the rolling-stock was there

  Well, sir, the annual directors’ meet-
ing came around It was just a year that
John had been with the road, and in that
time he had set it on its feet again True,
it was still a trifle unsteady but before
he came, it was ready to have prayers said

  So the board of directors, in solemn
conclave assembled, decided that John
Dickerson should be written a letter com-
mending him for his excellent manage-
ment They composed a letter that read
like the Declaration of Independence
Each man signed it, and it was mailed

  John was out on the line, as usual,
when his mail came in They brought
him the big letter with its red seal, and

John tore it open Fid read it over care-
fully, laid it down on the table, picked

  “ Aw, what’s hurting you How much
of this train-licl have you bought
Storrs asked gruffly

  “ We’re a crowdin’ the lady,” Bellows
whispered as lie snuggled closer to Frank

  Instantly Storrs gave up the room he
had been contesting and cultivated a dan-
gerous intimacy with the edge of the box-
car roof then stretched his neck to see
across the back of his very near neighbor

  “ The lady ” was lying flat on her
stomach, just as the men were, her feet
toward the middle of the car and her

head raised as she looked out across the
brown and red of the prairie

  She was the only woman who had
dared to mount to the car-top when the
inside of that and all the other cars re-
fused to hold another person A look of
admiration passed between the two men
It was a tribute to her nerve

  The train bumped along the newlv
made track, which had been laid to ac-
commodate the home-seekers who were
making the run to secure possession of
the claims in the territory the government
was opening up for settlement For a
month, wagons and horses, carts and
burros had been coming to the border
of the new country and stopping there to
await the signal for the scramble for-
claims

  But the woman on the top of the car

me

  Yet, here she was and the two men
who made room for her liked her all the
better for looking like that and having
the courage to shin up the side of a box
car and take' chances

  “You’re makin’ the run” Bellows
  asked by way of opening up
  conversation

  “ I’m letting the railroad
  do it for me,” she answered as
  she stretched a little to absorb
  the extra space the men had
  given her

  “ They ain’t goin’ to do
  more’n a half-way job, you
  know,” Storrs volunteered

   “ Yes, you’ll have to finish
on your own—uni” Bellows
swallowed the word he had in-
tended to say with the exaggerated
punctiliousness of the frontiersman
when he talks to a woman he thinks is
 real ” one

“ I wish they were wheels I’d stand
a better show,” the girl said, smiling
a little at the embarrassment of the big
man beside her

“ It’ll be a grand scrimmage when
the train stops and we all light out, for
sure! ” Storrs observed, not wanting
the sociability to come to an end-
“Which way you goin’” Bellows
asked after he had rescued himself
from the depths into which his awk-
wardness of speech had precipitated
him

“ I haven’t decided,” the girl said
with such brevity that Storrs thought
she was offended

Silence fell, if it can be called si-
lence when a heavily laden train is
pounding along protestingly

Finally Storrs found his

   “ I don’t want to be cuttin’

in and
I know

   The girl turned her head, so that she
 faced him with sucli a sudden, eager
 movement that Storrs stopped in sur-
 prise

   “ Well, I do ask you ! 1 ask you to
 tell me what to do I’m anxious—”
 And both of the men turned their eyes
 away and looked along the rolling
 horizon line as tears gathered, and her

was an unexpected development, even in
this time and place of the unexpected
She was pretty, too, with sweet lips and
calm, soft eyes, the kind of girl who
would have looked in place sitting on a
veranda embroidering a doily

lips trembled and stiffened as she tried to
control them

  “ I’m so anxious to get a good claim
We haven’t any home and I’ve paid
almost every cent we have to register, and
if—if—if 1 should be crowded out, or
not -get a claim, or—or anything I’d—”

  “ Well, you won’t be crowded out or
not get anything You jes’ run our way
We’ll start you right,” said Storrs

  He and Bellows had hunted through
the Indian Territory and the Panhandle,
had traded with the Indians and ridden
in the round-ups till the country was an
open book to them They knew just the
claims they meant to stake

  They would lose no time, but go
straight as the crow flies to the land they
had decided to get and settle on A
home loomed large in the minds of both
They had knocked about till the edges
that they had bumped into began to make
them a bit sore and cause them to long
for quiet and certainty

  Both felt for the little woman beside
them She was out after the same good
thing Just a little woman, quiet and
sweet and weak, making the run that
would probably test even their strength
and endurance Each of them registered
a vow to help her win

  With a great grumbling of wheels and
a shrilling whistle that was like a com-
mand to get off, the train began to slow
down

  Moved by the impulse to get a good
start, the whole sardine-like arrangement
of men swung about till their feet shuf-
fled and felt about the edge of the car
roof over which their eager faces had
stretched a moment before

  The little woman was turned about
with the mass of humanity Lighter than
the others and less muscular, she could
not keep herself safely poised on the flat
roof Before Bellows could get himself
adjusted and look to her, she was pushed
over, and, grabbing frantically at any-
thing that promised to arrest her fall, she
seized his big-booted foot

  “Hang on!” he yelled, realizing the
predicament after the first jerk as her
weight nearly dragged him from the car

  He followed his own instructions As -v
he slid off he seized Storrs’s legs

  Storrs, surprised by the maneuver,
hurled, an indignant protest at his captor

    7 R R

  “Turn me loose, you coy'ote!”

  But the coyote was dangling uncer-
tainly in space, hitched firmly at one end
by the desperate clasp of the nervy little
lady and anchored with a finality that
left Storrs no choice to the pair of boots
above him-

  Storrs felt himself going or the edge
Seizing a pair of legs that offered a last
chance, he too, swung down from the
car-top, feeling the outraged kicks of his
victim subside as he got busy with the
top end of himself and sought the same
leg route to safety

  Down from the car - top the human
chain depended The men crowded on
the iron ladder at the end of the car,
yelled and cheered The little lady
looked down She swung a short dis-
tance only from the ground Bellows
felt the weight on his legs removed She
landed lightly and safely on the soft dirt
along the track side

  The train was stopping Bellows let
go The little woman saw a dozen eager
legs adjusting themselves to spring to the
ground and set off in the race

  “Which way shall I run” she cried,
shaking Bellows’s arm in her excitement

  “ That way,” he pointed “ Run like
the—the dickens! ”

  Her soft eyes, looking up into his with
perfect trust, made him gulp again at his
linguistic extravagance

  “ How’ll I know when—” she began

  “ I’ll yell Git! ” he commanded

  The loyalty that had made him cling
to Storrs, and Storrs tohim, through
greaser fights and empty cupboard days
caused him to wait till the dragging chain
of men had brought his friend to safe
dropping distance

  As soon as a point was- reached where
Storrs could cut loose from his hold on
the upper man’s legs without running the
risk of breaking his own, Bellows sang
out:

  “ Leggo, you Indian! You’re on
terry f enny! ”

  He ran ahead to where Storrs landed
Together the two swung about and
paused for an instant to get their bear-
ings Poised on the top of a ridge of
dirt thrown up along the railroad track
was the little lady She waved her hand
to them

  They plunged forward toward the

ridge She shot down the other side
When they reached the top and had a
chance to look beyond, she was scudding
over the prairie like a big brown rabbit

  “Jumping jehu, look at her go!”
Bellows cried in a burst of admiration

   “ Follow the leader! ” Storrs yelled as
he stretched his long legs and set off

  The train had come to a dead stand-
still The mob had poured out of the
doors to fall under and over the drop-
ping load from the tops of the cars
Screams of fright, of anger, of derision,
made the prairie that had never known
more than the shouts of the cowboys and
the bark of the coyotes a pandemonium
of human noises

   Bellows, glancing back, saw the ridge
of earth change to a pyramid of people
The race was on! Out the crowd
streamed, covering the brown plain with
a motley lot of plunging, puffing, swear-
ing, sweating creatures who made the
prairie-dogs scud into their holes and lay
low

   The flying feet ripped the brown skin
of grass from the red soil till it looked
as if the whole land bled under the lac-
erating heels

  Out ahead, skimming as lightly along
as if she had borrowed wings from the
sweeping wind, ran the little lady On
she went, till her brown figure became
a sort of focus for the eyes that stared
toward the promised land

  Bellows and Storrs pelted along in
something like proximity but she flitted
before them at a distance, and so the di-
recting yell that was to tell her where to
stop was lost in the racket and roll of
the voices behind

  Suddenly a barrier appeared to leap
out of the ground Some far-seeing cat-
tleman had set up a barbed-wire fence
that seemed to her eyes to stretch from
chaos on one side into eternity on the
other

  She glanced over her shoulder The
pounding mob was coming Fleetness of
foot was her only advantage She would
lose the benefit of that if she stopped to
find an opening through the fence, and
the lowest wire was too close to the
ground for her to roll under

  Gathering her short skirt as tightly
about her as she could, she dashed at the
fence

   “ Good guns, she’s going to climb it! ”
Bellows cried, with a sickening memory
of the torn sides of horses, the bleeding
flanks of cows that had come in contact
with the wire octopus

   Already she was putting her foot on
the lowest wire She had climbed up the
freight-car this looked comparatively
easy, as her modesty could not make her
shrink for the feat when the crowd was
so far behind

   She felt the cold prick of a barb in
her hand and sought a more satisfactory
hold She had managed to get to the top
of the six - wire fence Shaking and
swinging on her uncertain footing, and
obliged to disregard the prongs that were
gouging into her hands and body as she
pulled herself up, she reached a place
where jumping was her only resource

   Lbiable to take any notice of her skirts
with her hands and feet so fully occupied,
she lifted herself to spring The fourth
wire, on which she stood, vibrated cra-
zily The fifth wire bit and dug at her
knees and the top wire, by which she
tried to steady herself before jumping,
wabbled up and down under the uncer-
tain pressure of her hands

   Just as she prepared to spring, a shout
from the rear assailed her ears It had
the effect of sending her forward desper-
ately She scrambled frantically to re-
gain her balance The effort entirely
killed the little momentum she had She
turned a half hand-spring, and landed in
a heaped-up tangle of skirts and loosened
hair on all the barbs in her immediate
neighborhood '

   Madly she tried to drag herself loose
She dropped her whole weight, hoping to
tear herself down from the wires Blood
streamed from her torn hands and, by
the merest chance, she kept her face from
being scratched by the trembling top
wire

   One who has never had an experience
with a barbed - wire fence can scarcely
picture the tenacity of the hold with which
the wire demon clutched her

   The big hope that had buoyed her in
overcoming difficulties died as she hung
there The horde behind would sweep
by her All the land would be grabbed
She would be left, a bit of driftwood on
the sea of the prairie that every one but
herself would have some claim upon
BARBED-WIRE CHIVALRY

  The thought of the two men to whose
kindness she had owed her comfort on
the car roof, and especially of the one
whose good left leg had saved her from
a bad fall, came to her now If only
they would come to pick her off this ter-
rible trap!

  The two men were coming, running
with renewed vigor as they saw her ar-
rested, a captive of the barbed-wire fence

  Then the little lady began to wonder if
they would extricate her They, too, were
running for a home They had entered
the race to win They were quite justi-
fied in looking on her as an obstacle in
their way removed—or, rather, held up,
by fate for their benefit

  Would they loosen her from the tor-
turing fence And if they did, what
show would she stand when the great
croAvd swept down upon her Tears of
discouragement ran down her cheeks

  Bellows was wasting his breath, swear-
ing with every step he took

  “ It’s that white-livered half-breed’s
done this! Thinks lie’ll turn the pack off
the scent of the good land beyond, so he
can wiggle his dirty carcass onto it! ” he
growled

  “ Shut up your steam-box and run! ”
Storrs ordered, showing the worth of his
advice by leaping ahead of his comrade

  He dashed on toward the fence An-
other minute and he was working with
might and main to free the dress, the
hair, the flying ends that seemed to have
grown all over her

  “You—you mustn’t let me loose!”
she sobbed hysterically I—I might get
the very land you want I might take
your claim”

  “ Guess they’s enough to go round—
the whole passel's got to,” he added, as
lie saw the mob sweeping down toward
the fence

  Bellows came up to the other side just
as Storrs gave up trying to work through
the wires and climbed over Between
them they pulled and tore the little lady
free

  Storrs’s bleeding hands bore testimony
to his efforts  but the little lady lifted
her soft eyes—the tears making them
softer still—to Bellows’s face and thanked
him

  “ I ain't done nothin’,” he disclaimed,
with a gratified flush showing through
his bronzed skin

THE RACE WAS ON ! OUT THE CROWD STREAMED, COVERING THE BROWN PLAIN
100

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  The rage of the crowd rose in a roar
as they came on the formidable fence
A few of the hardier ones tried to climb,
but most of the land-seekers knew barbed-
wire fences and respected them The
race swung about as the crowd scurried
like a huge herd of giant jack-rabbits
along the wires, seeking an opening

  “ Look at ’em! Scared cats! We’ve
got it our own way! ” Bellows gloated

  And they had Only a meager few
had managed to get up and over the
fence with much satisfaction to them-
selves  and now they were running out
toward the land that was obviously richer
and better

  “ Go it! ” Bellows shouted to the girl
as the advance runners came closer
“ Go it good! We’ll give you a handi-
cap—er—won’t we, Bill”

  Storrs nodded

  “ Oh, no! 1 couldn’t let you! You’ve
been so good It’s not fair! ” the little
lady objected, standing on ceremony in
tl tattered remnants of what had been
a very neat and serviceable brown dress

  “ Light out! Don’t be a—lady! ” Bel-
lows shouted, his eyes on the foremost of
the claim-seekers

  Storrs shuddered at the temerity of his
friend He spoke as if the little lady
were just an ordinary woman And, to
his relief, the little lady seemed rather
pleased than otherwise

  Off she shot as if Bellows’s command
had been a key to set the mechanism of
her body in motion

  “ Hurrah ! Leg it! Leg it! ” Bellows
yelled, with forgetful but genuine en-
thusiasm

  “ Shut up, you eejut! ” Storrs warned

   At the instant a long-legged, air-split-
ting figure shot by them, the head of the
fence-climbers

  “ Hike! ” Bellows shouted to Storrs

  The race now had narrowed down to
themselves and the sandpiper whose
marvelous strides measured off space with
clockwork regularity Bellows hated the
man and his red goatee before he had
run a half dozen yards abreast of him

  The pine pegs that marked the corners
of the quarter sections showed now and
then a bit more freshly yellow than the
drying grass

  Bellows was wrathy at the man who
ran him just a little better, making with

each stride a slightly perceptible advance
Storrs looked ahead at the little lady

  She had come to a place where a
fringe of stunted willows and a few
mesquit trees indicated the bed of a dry
creek'

  “ Stop ! Hold up ! ” Storrs sang out,
making a megaphone with his bony
hands

   On she flew, quite too intent to realize
that she had reached a good place

  “ Hi! ” Bellows shouted

  The red-bearded man diverted his thin
body for an instant from its straight line
of procedure and planted a jab with his
sharp elbow in the neighborhood of Bel-
lows’s fifth rib

  “ Mind your business! ” he said

  “ You—•” Bellows snorted, as he
squared off to return the compliment to
advantage

  “ Aw, cut it! ” said the red-bearded
runner, as he made prompt use of the
slight advantage Bellows’s pause gave
him and struck out at a quicker pace

  Bellows was too mad to think of a
claim He set off after the man with a
purpose that gave wings to his feet But
the kangaroo-creature had incentive, too,
the kind he carried always in large quan-
tities—self-interest His eyes were fixed
on the small, brown figure that had
stopped at Bellows’s call just as quickly
as it had set off at his command

  His shrewd sense that smelled out
everything to his own interest told him
that there was a good reason for Bel-
lows’s warning cry He glanced about
at the prairie and saw the greener grass,
the fresher foliage that indicated the
presence of water at a more recent period
than most of the land he had run over
had enjoyed His running mate evident-
ly knew the lay of the land, and was
giving the little woman the benefit of
his knowledge

  Gathering himself together for a su-
preme effort, the man hurtled forward
with a speed that dropped Bellows be-
hind after two leaps

  Bellows, losing ground, and Storrs
still further behind, saw him come up to
tne little lady They could see that he
was waving a dictatorial forefinger, and
that she was shaking her head decidedly

  Then, from the angry motions and the
wildly waving red goatee, they could
BARBED-WIRE CHIVALRY-

101

tell that the red-bearded man was saying
a good deal Bellows imagined that he
saw the nervy little woman shrink He
veiled to Storrs:

  “ Chase! ”

  Both men dragged the fresh air into
their lungs and rushed forward at top
speed

  The little lady turned to them eagerly
They stopped, panting, beside her

  The woman sent a glance that would
have shriveled any but the atrophied
pride of the man she faced

  “ I’m not your wife, Ezra Innes,” she
asserted

  “ You ain’t got your decree Mirandy,”
th3 man gloated “ I guess these here
gentlemen ain’t so perlite that they'll try
to run yer husband off his wife’s land”

 “Oh! You—you—” The wrath of

 he's trying to make me give up”

  What’s up” Bellows demanded

  “ He’s trying to make me give up,” she
answered, the tears coming

  “ You skunk! ” Bellows cried, facing
the tyrant “ This here land’s hern We
seen her on it before you’d come within
bearin’, didn’t we, Storrs h

  “ You bet! ” Storrs seconded

  “ You’d better make tracks,” Bellows
advised

  The red goatee quivered, as the owner
of it laughed

  “ You two air some kind This here
is my wife, an’ I guess I kin stand to let
her git this claim—if you insist”

  If Storrs lfad not been too busy with
his own amazement, he would have de-
scribed Bellows as completely flabber-
gasted Staring from the man to the
little lady, Bellows was speechless

the little lady ended in a burst of tears

  She flung herself down on the ground
and gave way to a spasm of grief and
anger that reduced the two astounded
frontiersmen to even more complete si-
lence

  Bellows looked down at her with anger
and pity struggling in his face Storrs
clenched and unclenched his hands Both
felt utterly helpless in the face of the
situation

  “ It’s always been like this,” the little
lady finally found voice to say “ He
always comes along and takes everything
away from me He done it ever since I
married him And lie’s going to keep
on doing it”

  Bellows and Storrs looked at Mr Innes
to see how this accusation affected him
But it slipped from his leather-like hide
102

THIS IS MY SISTER S DECREE ! YOU CAN-GIT

as lightly as the wind capered across the
plains

  “ Ef you two want to git the kind
uv land that suits you, you better run
erlong,” he suggested comfortably

  Bellows and Storrs looked at each
other, then at the approaching runners,
and last at the little lady

  She looked pitifully up at them, her
face stained by her tears and the red
earth She lifted her shbulders and
made a gesture with her little, bloody
hands that seemed to say she recognized
the uselessness of protest

  “ Go on ! Get your claims! Don't
let them cheat you out of yours, too, she
urged

  Bellows and Storrs turned away There
seemed to be nothing for them to do but
look to their own interest, which they did
by making quick progress across the creek-
bed to land that they knew to be first-
class

  Within an hour the prairie was peo-
pled Five and six claimants on each
quarter-section laid the foundation for a
legal war that went merrily on, while
others bought off and “ swopped ” to
save themselves lawyers’ fees

  Water sold for a dollar a glass, and

Mr Innes, again scenting his own ad-
vantage, went into the business and
reaped a rich harvest from the puddle
that nestled on his side of the creek-bed

  During the second day of their occu-
pancy, Bellows and Storrs, neither of
them daring to leave the land they had
taken, were carrying on a long-range
conversation, when a rattling old sulky
and horse came along

  A young man, whose cheeks burned
with a suspicious redness, drove the queer
turnout The presence of canned goods
was evident by the gunny-sack that dan-
gled from the back of the seat

  “Spare any fodder” Bellows asked
as he drew up

  “ Nope Takin’ it to my sister,” the
young fellowr responded pleasantly “This
is great, ain’t it  ”

  He filled his cramped lung cavity with
the ozone and lifted eyes exactly like the
little lady’s to the big blue sky

  “Whose your sister” Storrs asked
quickly, as he saw the color and soft
glow of the eyes

  “ Mrs Innes, that was, praise be,” the
boy replied

  Bellows came up to the sulky and laid
his hand on the uncertain wheel
BARBED-WIRE CHIVALRY

103

  “ Great old trap, ain’t it  Best we
could afford She came down 011 the
train—to get in good, you know And
I jogged along with this bunch of bones
They told me back yonder that along
here’s where the train-load got to going
I’m looking for—”

  Bellows interrupted

  “ She’s over the creek with her hus-
band”

  The young fellow shot up from the
rickety seat and stood on the wabbly
foot-rest his face one big interrogation
“ What  ”

  “Sure! Her an’ Mr Innes got that
claim over yonder”

  “That monster ain’t here” the boy
asserted and asked at once He’s hound-
ed her till she’s desperate I’ll kill him
the second I £ight him”

  He had ptdled a pistol -from his
pocket, and the intensity of his anger
had sent the red flying into his cheeks

  “'We’ve raked and gcraped all we
could to get down here—me for my
health, and her to get shut of him And
he’s here”

  The same helpless acceptance of the
ubiquitous Mr Innes that had seemed to
take possession of the little lady threat-
ened to overwhelm her brother Evi-
dently the husband was an octopus when
once his tentacles clutched

  “ He’s there, all right! ” Bellows
growled “ He’s sellin’ puddle-water fur
a dollar a dipper, gettin’ ready to live on
Easy Street when they lay out the town—
on his land, I reckon He’s got the kind
uv luck you can’t kill”

   “ Yer sister got the claim fust,” Storrs
added “ But he come along an’ took
possession, ’cause she was his wife”

  Trembling with nervous excitement,
the boy was fishing in the opening of his
flannel shirt for something that showed
the outline of sharp corners He pulled
out a thick letter in an official envelope

  “ I guess he won’t browbeat her any-
more That’s her decree It came just
after she left”

  He stood waving the envelope in one
hand, while his other still clutched the
pistol

  Bellows snatched the envelope

  “ When’d you say you got it ” he de-
manded

  “ Day before yesterday,” the brother

  answered, staring with some displeasure
at the excited man

  “ Then she wasn’t his wife when she
got the claim We kin prove she got
there fust It's her’n—it’s her’n ! ” Bel-
lows shouted

  Swept by the enthusiasm that took pos-
session of them, the three men made quick
time to the Innes claim

  Storrs and Bellows swallowed hard
when they saw the little lady fling her-
self into her brother’s arms

  “ Archie! Archie! ”

  Quickly, treading on the very heels of
her joy, her grief found expression in
the brief but sufficient, “ Ezra’s here! ”

  “ He ain’t going to stay,” the brother
asserted, looking over his sister’s shoul-
der at Mr -Innes, who came from his
shack

  “ This is my sister’s decree! You can
—git! ” he cried, waving the envelope in
the husband’s face

  “ You mean you and her kin git! ” that
individual answered coolly “ This is
my claim”

  “I reckon not!” Bellows said, with
decision “ That there decree was grant-
ed before yesterday, so you wasn’t her
husband An’ we kin swear that she was
here fust—so this ain’t your claim! ”

  Mr Innes looked at Bellows as if he
thought of protesting, but that look evi-
dently gave him cause to reconsider He
turned, with a fair amount of self-pos-
session, and started to go Storrs met him

  “ You can leave the money for that
muddy water you got out of this lady’s
crick,” he said mildly, but with his pistol
for emphasis

  And Mr Innes, with a recognition that
he was beaten, handed over the money

  “ It’s—it’s all because you picked me
off the barb-wire fence,” Mrs Innes said,
as she lifted her gentle eyes to Bellows

  Bellows and Storrs swallowed hard, but
for different reasons

  But the best part of the stoty is,
though it’s only reality, not romance, that
the friendship between the two men never
wavered while they both courted the lit-
tle lady and it grew insoluble in the
comfort of their miserable confidences
when the storekeeper from the town in
Missouri where she had lived cams down
and married the little lady whose first
sweetheart he had been

Those letters stand for an interesting profession—Tracer of Lost
Freight-Cars If you were a tracer, there is no telling where you would have
to go on this great northern continent while running down a missing car
Mr Blakeley had a number of interesting experiences while he was a tracer—
quite as exciting as if he were a detective in search of an elusive robber

     But—thanks to a wonderful system and well-kept records—there are not
so many missing freight-cars as one would imagine And the fact, as Mr
Blakeley says, that his calling is followed by less than a dozen persons, shows
how well our great railroad companies keep tab on their wandering rolling-
stock	_

In a Forgotten Land, Two Cars Might Have

TRUE STORY, NUMBER FORTY-ONE

OR upward of twenty years
I was a tracer of lost
freight-cars It is a unique
calling, and is followed by
less than a dozen persons
To those unacquainted with
the intricacies of car-counting, it might
seem easy to keep track of the rolling-
stock : but when it is considered that, no
matter how small the road owning it a car
may be sent from the Atlantic to the Pa-
cific, and be handled by a dozen different
train-crews and perhaps as many switch-
ing - crews at all hours of the day and
night, there is plenty of room for mistakes

  Passenger, express, and : siggage-cars
are rarely lost, but the freighi-car depart-
ment is less fortunate and every road of
any importance has its lost-car agent, who
is always on the wing, hunting up stray
cars

  His trips frequently cover thousands of
miles, and take him into all sections of
the country, from the busy yards in the
large cities to some out-of-the-way switch
in a desolate region, where the railroad
station stands alone

  While I was lost-car agent for the Ala-
bama Great Southern, I had some queer

car 873, a telegram reached me at Aber-
deen, Mississippi, that, as soon as my re-
port was turned in regarding its where-
abouts, I was to go to Terre Haute,
Indiana, in search of gondola 13,781

  This car had been sent to Indianapolis
with a load of machinery for the Nordyke
Marmon Machine Company from Tusca-
loosa, Alabama and, having arrived and
been unloaded, instead of being sent home,
it had been loaded with car-trucks and
sent to Terre Haute via Vandalia, they
being short of cars, and it being the un-
written rule to use anything in sight when
a car must be had

  From Terre Haute it was sent to Brazil
for a load of coal It was the plan to
load it there and send it on the way home
as far as Indianapolis with block coal On
its arrival at Brazil, the mines’were closed,
owing to a strike, and the car was side-
tracked on a C and E I spur, owned
jointly by the latter road and the Van-
dalia Here the car dropped out of exist-
ence, no further trace being obtainable

  The books of the agents and switching-
crews showed its arrival, but no trace of
its departure On my arrival at Brazil,
I carefully inspected every side-track and
coal-switch in the town, but no sign of
13,781 Many other cars of other roads,
built at the same shops, and of the same
description as the lost car, were there, but
no A G S, 13,781

  I was about to give up the hunt there
and try some other near-by town to see if
it might not have been shoved out there
for want of room at Brazil, when I
chanced to go down the Chicago and
Eastern Illinois tracks toward the station
north of the roundhouse

  A game of ball in a park had attracted
my attention Being a lover of the sport,
I found, on consulting my watch, that I
had nearly an hour till the first train Go-
ing over to where the two nines were play-
ing, I sat down on a convenient knoll, and
was soon oblivious to all but the game

club, and many muffs of his allowed the

THE USEFULNESS OF THE BACK-STOP DREW
MY ATTENTION

tally of the other side to run up, nothing
but a back-stop preventing the ball from
landing in a pool of water

  The usefulness of the back-stop, which
was both high and heavy, drew my atten-
tion to it It looked strangely familiar,
and I drew closer and soon recognized it
to be the sideboards of a gondola nailed
to upright posts

  This fact interested me more, and go-
ing around to the rear, my astonished
vision was greeted with the sight of the
letters “ A G S,” in white, but nearly
effaced, and on the end of the boards,
“ 13781”

  In a few minutes, I learned that the
boards had been purloined by enthusiastic
lovers of baseball from an old, demolished
car Getting my informant to accompany
me, I went to the spot, and found that
from the spur track another spur had been
built, at one time, to a coal-shaft, now
abandoned and full of water

  By questioning the track foreman, I
found that the old shaft had caved in one
night, taking with it several rods of the
switch The hole was filled with water
some twenty feet deep, and was perhaps a
hundred feet in diameter

  Close inquiry elicited the fact that the
track had been filled with cars, though
none had gone down, as was thought,
when the end sank in the cave-in Think-
ing differently, I secured a pump from a
near-by mill, and, connecting it with their
steam plant, started the work of empty-
ing the cave-in, as such ponds are called

  After three days of steady pumping the
bottom began to show, and soon the draw-
bar and timbers of a gondola-car were vis-
ible When the water had been sufficient-
ly lowered, it was quickly recognized as
our lost car 13,781, though badly broken
up, and in a terrible plight from lying in
the mud and water for nearly two years

  A derrick was rigged up, the wreck-
ing-car of the Chicago and Eastern Illi-
nois was called into use, and the remains
of the gondola were brought to solid
ground again Temporary rails soon got
it back on the track The back-stop was
reinstalled in its original position, the car
was temporarily repaired and sent home
for overhauling, the mystery was solved,
and my work was done

  A few months after this I was sent to
St Louis to locate car 3,002, A G S It

was a box car that had left Selma, Ala-
bama, for San Francisco, loaded with
oakum for ship-calking From San Fran-
cisco, where it had been unloaded, it was
sent over to Oakland, and from there to
Coronado Beach, California, with a con-
signment of furniture

  From there, after unloading, it had
gone, empty, to Encinitos, where a gigan-
tic powder-works is located Here it was
loaded with powder and billed to Litch-
field, Illinois, the consigners being a coal
company

  It had been despatched via the Santa
Fe route in connection with the Southern
Pacific and Missouri Pacific, and it was
traced to East St Louis with but little
trouble Here it dropped out of exist-
ence while it was being made up in the
Big Four yards—at least, so far as the
official record of it was concerned

  Persistent inquiry failed to locate it,
and I went to Litchfield There the books
of the agent showed that the powder had
been received, but in a Canada Southern
car, No 300, and that the car had been
emptied and despatched to Port Pluron,
Michigan, as standing orders were to re-
turn to that point all empty cars of that
line

  The name and number being somewhat
similar, I concluded to go to Port Huron
Arriving there, I found the car had been
sent to Shingleton, Michigan, just a few
days before, where it was to load with
shingles

  Taking the first train there I found a
sawmill and lumber-yard in the midst of
a forest I hastened to the single side-
track, and I inspected the cars, half a
dozen in number, half loaded with shin-
gles I found C S car 300, as expected

  A close inspection, however, revealed
that on the trucks and other iron-work
underneath was our company’s name, as
nearly all companies do mark their cars
It was easy to see that the sides of the car
had been newly made and painted The
ends, however, were badly scorched, and
the original boards had been repainted
The sills of the car were badly smoked
This was evidently our car

  In reply to a telegram, it was ascer-
tained that at the time of the great oil
refinery fire in the yards in East St Louis,
in the previous fall, a number of cars were
burned, some being totally consumed, and

others damaged Our car
had been injured, and in
the process of repairing
it had been lettered in-
correctly

  After the usual rou-
tine of correspondence,
the car was turned over
to us by the Canada
Southern people, along
with a bill for thirty-
six dollars and eighty
cents, which they had
paid for repairs and
the mystery of 3,002
was solved

  Perhaps none of the
many spectators and
railroad men knew how
near they had been to
death when that car,
loaded with enough
powder to wipe out the
city, had been in the
midst of them with the
woodwork on fire

  Another interesting
experience in tracing
lost cars fell to me in 1897 While in
an Eastern city, I received orders to go
at once to Gila Bend, Arizona, and see if
I could locate box car 2,172 of the Mis-
sissippi Central, a leased branch line of
the Alabama Great Southern This car
had been the subject of a great deal of
correspondence before it had even been
traced so far

  It had been in Texas, and from the
Houston and Texas Central had been
traced to the Toledo, St Louis and Kan-
sas City Railroad, thence to St Louis
again, and from there it had gone west to
Nevada, where it had been loaded with
silver ore

  Thence it had been back to Argentine,
Kansas, to the smelter, where it had re-
mained a month before being unloaded 
and then, by a yardmaster’s error, had
been billed to Yuma, Arizona, in place of
Selma, Alabama

  It had broken down at Gila Bend, Ari-
zona, cn route, and had been set off on an
abandoned spur-track almost overgrown
with cactus and sage-brush The spur, at
one time, led to a quarry of quartz some
three miles back, but had been aban-
doned

SEE WHO WOULD BE FOOL
TO LOCATE THERE

  The locality was as desolate as a fier-s
mit could desire, not an inhabitant being
within miles, and a name was given to it
only because, occasionally, a stockman
flagged the train South of the bend was
a sand waste—an arid desert

  Dropping off the train at this place, I
was lonesome in a minute and the only
consolation I could get out of the situation
was that the west-bound train would be
along in three hours, and I could get back
into civilization at Mineral Point, a vil-
lage some sixty miles away

  Taking the track or spur switch which
left the main line at the bend of the road,
I walked along the ties The rails had
been removed, except for a few lengths
near the track I wandered along for half
a mile through the cactus, watching for
Gila monsters, rattlesnakes, and other
pleasant sojourners whom I might intrude
upon to my sorrow I at last came upon
what appeared to be the end of the grade

  The track disappeared at the edge of a
high sandhill, evidently a formation of
some wind-storm for which the desert Is
noted Why, I do not know  but curios-
ity prompted me to climb this hill, which
was some thirty or forty feet in height,

and covering an acre or more I was re-
warded only by a stretch of sand-plains
covered here and there with sage-brush

  Seeing nothing of interest, and anxious
to get away from the lonesome spot, I was
about to return, when from behind a little
sand-knoll a quarter of a mile away I saw
a curl of smoke arising Thoughtless of
possible danger in this haven for outlaws
and renegade Indians, I struck out to see
who would be fool enough to locate there

  In what had formerly been the old
quartz quarry stood a dilapidated box car,
out of which came smoke while half a
dozen Piute children and an assortment
of native dogs lolled in the sun No In-
dians being on the war-path, I made bold
to venture farther An old squaw was
tanning some kind of hide, while an old
buck was stretched out asleep inside a rug
of wolf-hides

  Unable to converse in their language,
I confined mysglf to a survey of the prem-
ises and, while the trucks and running
gear of the car were buried in sand, one
side showed plainly that it was what was
left of Mississippi Central 2,172 The
lettering and paint had completely van-,
ished from the side exposed to the wind
An explanation from the Indians being
unobtainable, I left, under the scrutiny of
the squaw and the barking dogs

TRAIN HELD U

LITTLE did the passengers of the train
going to Kingville realize that a chick-
en hawk was the cause of their train being
delayed for something like two and a half
hours, says the Rock Hill, South Carolina,
Herald Some time before the train was due
at Lesslie Station, a citizen discovered that
a hawk was after his chickens

  He got his gun, but before he could get a
chance to shoot, it had escaped with one of
the chickens He followed the bird, which
was floating along through the air like an
aeroplane until it discovered one of the big
steel towers of the Southern Power Com-
pany, near the railroad

  The hawk had its prey in its claws, seeking
some spot where it could enjoy its breakfast
Without hesitation, it flew straight to the
tower, alighting upon one of the wires, which
was charged with a voltage of 22,000, still

in the shifting sand, I was on hand at the
spot where the train stopped when flagged
At Yuma, I wired headquarters full par-
ticulars about finding 2,172, and the im-
possibility of ever getting it back

  Orders came at once to burn it, and, if
possible, carry away the trucks and iron
As there was not a team within forty
miles, the latter was out of the question,
and I wired back to that effect Nettled
by this reply, the officials sent orders to
burn it anyhow This I did, aided by six
stalwart section-men It was only our
show of superior force, and our help in
removing the effects of the family, that
we succeeded in avoiding a fight, as Scar-
faced John, the buck, was ready to defend
his home

, Investigation solved the problem as to
how the car got there, ft is likely that,
after the car was side-tracked, some one
released the brake and it ran down the
grade, which was sufficiently steep to
carry it near to, if not into, the quarry
Then the ever-shifting sands soon cov-
ered up the track, the quarry was aban-
doned, and the spur closed

  The country was abandoned to the
roaming Piutes, sage-hens, and the ever-
dreaded Gila monsters It became a part
of the Forgotten Country, and little won-
der that even a freight-car should get lost
there

clinging to the chicken and with the owner
close behind

  But the hawk did not last long, for no
sooner had its feet touched the wire when
some part of its body or the bodj of the
chicken touched the steel tower, which
caused instant death, forming a short cir-
cuit which caused the heavy charged wire
to burn in two

  In falling it landed on the railroad track
at the crossing, which is a little way below
Lesslie Station When the train reached
Lesslie Station, Captain McGuire, who was
in charge, was informed of the danger that
lay ahead, and after stopping the train lie
secured Preston Lesslie’s auto and came to
Rock Hill and phoned to the power plant to
cut off the “juice” In a short while the
train, which had been delayed for nearly
three hours, went speeding on its way
WHY BAYARD STAYED

       BY ROBERT FULKERSON HOFFMAN

          An Engineer Declares Against High Heroics
          Then Calmly Breaks the Wise Rule He Makes

LL right! Have it your way I
  wouldn’t make bad friends
  with you about it”

  Hutton, the front brake-
man, spoke in tones of
broad compassion for
hopeless ignorance His was the voice of
a regret that yields much because of an
encounter with an adversary that is so very
wrong

  “ And I’ll tell you why,” he added,
unexpectedly losing hold of his pacific
intentions, in a sudden revulsion of cer-
tainty and renewed aggression

  “ Neither you nor any other man
knows what he’d do in that kind of a
squeeze until he’s square up against it
And a lot of them don’t know, then, till
it’s all over and the pieces have quit fall-
ing”

  “Aw, what you talking about” de-
manded Sunny Acre, the fireman “ You
talk as though a man had no more sense
than a rabbit Nor as much, for a rabbit
knows enough to hop before he’s grabbed
both back and front, don’t he”

  “ Now, that’s just where your flag’s
faded,” declared Hutton “ He’s just as
likely to set still till lie’s grabbed, as he
is to hop off And if you was a little
older at the business, you’d know it”

  “ What business” laughed Acre from
under the vizor of his close-drawn cap
“ Rabbit-hunting ”

  “ I’m wasting sleep 011 you,” replied
Hutton in high disdain

  Without further contention, he lounged

down upon the ballast and sunk his face
in the crook of his arm

  “ What are you young coddymoddies
squawking about” demanded Bayard,
the engineer, in good-natured drawl, as
he sat up, with slow deliberation, beside
them in the gloom “ Are you too strong
to sleep when you get a ten - minute
chance at it ”

  “ Oh, Hutton, here, thinks he is edu-
cating me some,” replied Acre

  “ Say, Bayard, if you were to be in a
head-ender right now—to-night—where
you could-see the other fellow coming at
us in time, what would you d<5 after you
had shut off and set the brakes Hop
right then, or stay on and fiddle with the
lever”

  Sunny-’s eyes were very bright, his face
was very young and brave-looking, his
blouse and overalls were stiff and new—
hardly smudged, in fact—and so, while
they had lain waiting in the silence of
the mountain - top, under the brilliant
studding of the stars and a low quar-
ter-moon, he had fallen into Hutton’s
old, pet discussion

  Meanwhile, Bayard, with his head
upon a tie-end and his weary body
stretched upon the stone ballast of the
road-bed, had slept—briefly, but well—
beside them, in the deep shadow of his
silent engine

  Bayard, forty-eight years old by the
calendar, and twenty years old at engine-
running, was a man of slow speech and
reputed wisdom For all of the twenty
110

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

years he had deliberately avoided giving
the answer to that question of staying or
jumping, although each new fireman—
arid nearly every new brakeman — had
asked it in turn

  And now he did not answer it as pro-
pounded by Sunny Acre Instead, he
arose leisurely and, after a wide-spread
yawn, with his face to the sparkling sky,
shook himself fully back to the joy of
living

  He walked, slipped, and stumbled
agilely down the slight bank of loose
sandstone ballast, then climbed a pace or
two, until he stood before the clear rill
of mountain water that fell in cool drip-
pings from the near-by rocks He drank
his fill from the half shell of a coconut,
and laid it carefully, edge downward, in
its accustomed niche of rock

  Then he looked at the pair of deeper
shadows that marked the now reclining
and silent orators in the shadow of the
engine  listened to the far, faint murmur
of the first section of opposing freight
laboring up from somewhere down in
the pass looked up again at the wide,
star-lit expanse of summer sky, and knew
that he was going to 'answer Sunny
Acre’s question squarely, then, and from
the depths of his soul

  For the world that he knew best—that
great, silent, starlit world—was good to
live in, and he would answer accord-
ingly

  “What would I do” he repeated at
length in deep and measured tones across
the short intervening space

  The shadowy figures of Hutton and
Acre at once sat bolt upright by the en-
gine

  “ I’ve side-stepped that question long
enough to give every man on this divi-
sion that wants it a chance to hold up the
traditions of the high heroic And
now I’m going to answer it for my
own account,” Bayard continued without
prompting

  “ If I was to be in a head-ender to-
night, or to-morrow,' or any other night
or day, I’d shut off, set the brakes, re-
verse on general principles—and climb
off

  “ I’d jump as far clear of the engine
as I could and keep on end, run as fast
as I could, and keep on running until I
got arrested for violating the speed limit,

got knocked down, or until kindling quit
flying

  “ And,” he added with much delibera-
tion, “ if I had time, I’d surely advise
you fellows to do the same But I
wouldn’t wait a second longer to see
whether you were coming with me

  “ Now, if you will write that on the
roundhouse call - board, first time she’s
clear, I’ll sign it Or you can tell Windy
Lou, the wanderer, and that will have
the same effect of publicity

  “ But don’t you get any wrong idea
from that Always do what you can be-
fore you unload—but unload quick when
you need to”

  That was the sum total of Bayard’s
unexpected declaration, and, resisting all
enticements held out by the promptly re-
newed wrangle of Hutton and Acre, he
bared his well-thatched gray head to the
cool of the night and withdrew into his
habitual silence as precipitately as he had
emerged from it

  No specious plea against that final
precious help that may possibly be drawn
from careful reversing at the last, even
though the brakes be fully set no clever
application of the theory of increased co-
efficients of friction at slower speeds, as
Acre had newly coined it no begging of
the question as to whether it is the run-
ning of the first twenty, or the last
twenty feet, after brakes are set, that
causes the slaughter in collision, served
to incite Bayard to further discussion

  His position was clear and final

  Do what you can for others, for your
train, and for yourself Shut off, warn,
jump, run, and keep on running!

  It did not sound at all heroic barely
civil, in fact But Bayard, quite com-
posed and quietly happy in his work and
his surroundings, climbed aboard in due
time, after the meeting and passing of
the first freight section was accomplished,
read his latest order once' more, for cer-
tainty’s sake, arid started for the bottom
of the pass, with a clear conscience and
a track supposed lo be equally clear

  He caught the top buttons of his cor-
duroy coat into place as the night breeze
grew keener with moderately increased
motion — corduroy was the one visible
foible of Bayard—and he lifted his stout
corduroyed leg to his favorite position,
astride the nicely balanced reverse-lever,

and settled comfortably to the business
of running down the curving grades

  Hutton and Acre, hunched up together
on Acre’s seat-box, were still debating
with unflagging zeal They had not ar-
rived at a conclusion when the engine
reached the bottom of the pass and
struck into the rather sharp left curve,
around the base of the mountain

  On Acre’s side of the engine the verti-
cal rock-wall continued close to the cab-
window On Bayard’s side the first fun-
nel of the valley lay wide and smooth
with range-grass There they met the
second section of freight, without note or
notice, coming to them at a spanking
pace on the single track

  It is of no present consequence how
they got there, perhaps, except that
Bayard was running correctly on his or-
der and the other crew had misread the
meeting - point And so the meeting-
point having been suddenly transposed
without notice, while Hutton and Acre
were busy with their own opinions on
the obstructed side of the engine-view, it
was Bayard who first caught the rocking
gleam of the coming headlight and
voiced a brief warning

  “ J ump ! This side ! ” he shouted, and
that was all, except one short bark from
the whistle, which the other engine in-
stantly echoed, in kind

   For the rest of it he thrust the throttle
shut upon the thread of steam which he
had been using, toward the level, swept
the brake-valve to its fullest duty, as his
hand fell from the throttle and, with
his feet still astride of the quadrant, and
one of them resting upon the strong steel
footrest which projected from the side of
the quadrant, he pulled the lever back
sharply, released the latch and, attempt-
ing to get to his feet, lunged half out of
the window, intending to swing his feet
up and leap clear

  Instead of leaping, however, he turned
hastily back, after one longing, straining
glance at Hutton and Acre fleeing safely
under the quarter moon, across the range
grass, and then he attacked the reverse
lever fiercely, in the effort to reset it
elsewhere in the quadrant

  That was the last fleeting view Hutton
and Acre had of him, struggling in wri-
thing outline, against the dim cab-lights,
until after all was over

  They stood watching, with shortened
breath, as the great, shadowy hulks of
the engines bore down resistlessly upon
each other, while little jets of fire spurt-
ed from the grinding brake-shoes upon
the wheels all along the cars crowding
up darkly from the rear

  Sunny Acre’s arms were unconsciously
stiffened in grotesque arcs like those of a
frog’s front legs in poise for leaping, and
his outspread fingers were set wide and
separately as extended claws

  Hutton, close beside him, ankle-deep
in the brown grass, leaned forward, open-
mouthed, in that last moment when the
senses of the onlooker undergo a sort of
palsy, and colliding engines deceptively
seem to halt just before striking

  Then, with a brakeman’s last resort
when all else had failed, he let go a pier-
cing, quavering yell that was swallowed
up in the crash of the impact, leaped
once, straight up from the ground, and
started racing back toward the grinding
and smoking jumble in the half darkness
011 the tracks

  All of it was very briefly done The
opposing pilots thrust their steel-shod
noses together, crunched and crumpled
headlight glasses fell shattered and clink-
ing upon the crushed forward decks the
muffled roar of collapsed front-ends fol-
lowed, and the front-ends lifted from
the trucks, a little space, like belligerent
goats in their first preliminary of battle,
then settled, jerkily, down

  The dull rumble of the suddenly
stayed trains quickly subsided in both
directions, and these things were about all
that marked the occasion in the usual
way, except that the erring freight-crew
had leaped and run, and had joined Hut-
ton and Acre, at a safe distance, before
the broken glass had ceased falling

  Bayard was the one unaccountable
unit of the whole transaction When the
four fugitives had come hurrying back
and climbed upon Bayard’s engine, they
found him standing bolt upright, in al-
most military severity, except that his
feet were astride of the quadrant and his
hand was upon the top end of the reverse
lever He was chewing a stub of match
stem and looking, with a faded sort of
smile, out into the dimly lighted valley

  “ Matter, Bayard Did it get you”
asked one of them, in kindly concern,
 112

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

while yet clambering up the distorted
engine-step

  “ Nope,” replied Bayard serenely

  “ Then, why in Cain didn’t you un-
load  ” demanded the same voice

  “ We’re in bad enough No use
scaring the souls out of the rest of the
gang, is there”

  “ Say,” exclaimed Bayard, with sud-
den testiness of speech, “ I wouldn’t
worry any about that, if I were you
I’m on my beat, all right, ain’t I 

  “I was ‘ staying by her,’ understand
‘Brave engineer stayed at his post,’ eh

  “ Now, you fellows had better climb
your own engine, and we’ll see if we can
back ’em apart Then you can begin to
figure out how you got here on my time”

  Through it all, Bayard stood firmly
erect He maintained his clutch upon
the reverse lever and his clinch upon the
match stem, until the others had depart-
ed, and only Sunny Acre was left in the
cab with him

  Then Bayard’s heroic pose underwent
a sudden change It gave place to fever-
ish activity

  “ Sunny,” he commanded in quick, in-
sistent undertone, “ grab hold of this re-
verse lever, and help me throw it over
forward!

  “ The left leg of these cursed cordu-
roys is caught and jammed between the
lever and the quadrant, and I could
neither tear loose nor throw her”

  A lusty pull or two from Sunny, with
his back to the boiler-head and his foot
upon the end of the seat-box, added to
Bayard’s earnest but cramped efforts, did
it, and Bayard stood free, examining his
traitor garment

  “ That’s why I stayed, Sunny And,
if you ever tell it, you’re no friend of
mine

  “ I tried hard enough to get away, but
this stuff I’m wearing is too good for
the job”

  With that, Bayard rolled both legs of
his overalls up above the knees, searched
out his pocket-knife, and carefully ampu-
tated both corduroy trouser - legs, just
below the knees He was anything but
a heroic figure as he kicked the severed
partsfree of his feet, and rolled his over-
alls down to place

  Sunny, thawed out of his fright, apd
well into the reaction, clung weakly to
the throttle fulcrum and laughed while
he wept

  Before Bayard added his efforts to
those of the other engine-crew in backing
clear of the tangle, he opened the fire-
box door, tossed the discarded sections
of torn corduroy into the still flourishing
fire, and quickly latched the door upon
them

  This is the how and the why of Bay-
ard’s staying at his post That is to say,
staying longer than to others seemed
necessary Yet, Bayard is quite as good
as the best men who ever ran locomotives,
and he never shirked a duty 'because of
danger

 It' may also show why, when he made
his next trip out on the road, and there-
after, Bayard wore anything that suited
his fancy, except corduroy And, if
Sunny Acre had not shamelessly broken
the embargo of secrecy, which Bayard
placed upon him, BayarcKs real reason
for staying might never have found its
way here
Riding the Rail from Coast

BY GILSON WILLETS,

Special Traveling Correspondent of “The Railroad Man's Magazine”

                          •

ONE of the many readers of The Railroad Man's Magazine recently

station, some shops, an engine-house, and
a coal-bin, the number of railroaders in
the place was some considerable

   And it came to pass that one day late
in the year 1880, one of the “ adjuncts,”
namely, the coal-bin, bore a newly posted
sign, reading:

A meeting of tiie locomotive firemen
of this division will take place in this hall
this evening, for the purpose of initiating'
a new member Firemen who believe in
sticking together will please note that
the starting time is seven o'clock

   Within the “ hall” amid the black dia-
monds and the dust thereof, about a
dozen men in overalls and jumpers put
in an appearance at the appointed hour

They took their seats on cracker-boxes,
barrels, and whatever else came handy,

C P Huntington had planted a sufficient
number of railroad adjuncts in Tucson
to cause the town to be regarded, through-
out southeastern Arizona, as truly metro-
politan

  It was only natural, then, that this
Arizona metropolis should be the first
town in Ihe Southwest to form a lodge
of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Fire-
men

  After Mr Huntington gave the town

and then with great solemnity the cere-
monies opened with remarks from the
master, who said:

  “ Gents, the thirteenth member of this
lodge is now to !>c received into our fold,
and our brand put onto him The ser-
geant-at-arms will kindly bring in Frank
Sargent, commonly known on this divi-
sion as ‘ Vermont’

  And that’s how, where, and when
Frank Sargent joined the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Firemen You all know the
name, because Frank Sargent, within live
years of his initiation at Tucson, became
grand master of the brotherhood, and
later, Commissioner-General of Immigra-
tion of the United States, holding that
post when he died in September 1908

“ Vermont ” Gets His Start

  About six months previous to that night
when the brand was put onto Frank Sar-
gent in the coal-bin at Tucson, a man of
twenty-six summers walked into the yard-
master’s shanty at Tucson and asked
Yardmaster Mant for a job

  “ Well, son, what do ynu know about
railroadin'” asked Mant

  “ Nothing at all, sir I’ve just spent
five years tendin’ stock and shooting
Apaches, about harf and harf, sir”

  “ Harf and harf eh Not half and
half You from ’way down East”

  “Yes, sir—Vermont”

  “ Well, Vermont, what as have you
been tendin’ stock and shootin’ ’Paches
Cowpuncher  ”

  “ No sir United States cavalryman,
at thirteen dollars a month”

  “ Well, Vermont, if you allow you can
begin at the bottom here, you can stam-
pede yourself over to our engine-house
and wrestle with cotton-waste in the way
of wipin’ engines, at forty dollars a
month”

  And that’s how, when, and where
Frank Sargent became a railroad man
beginning as engine-wiper at Tucson He
was so quick in learning everything about
a locomotive that in six months he became
a fireman and a member of the local lodge
of the brotherhood

  And Frank Sargent became grand
master of the brotherhood after only five
years’ experience as a railroad man That
is easilv understood, however, if vou listen

to stories they tell at Tucson of how Sar-
gent, or “ Vermont,” as he was known
down there, acquired the popularity
among firemen that led to his election,
in such short order, to the highest office
within the gift of the brotherhood

  The Tucson men will tell you that very
soon after Sargent quit wiping to fire an
engine, a man named Snelling loomed up
in Tucson, riding the rods, and was ac-
costed by “Vermont” thus:

  “ What’s the sense of being an outcast
Snelling, a fine fellow like you, when you
can be a real man among men The
job of wiper in the engine-house is vacant
here and now, and if you say the word
you can have a chance to make a man of
yourself”

  Snelling took the job, became ultimate-
ly a fireman—and throughout his life
would have given his heart for voung
“ Vermont”

  Once a fireman named Garner chucked
up his job and mounted a horse to ride
away into the desert

   “ I'm tired of railroadin’,” Garner said
to “ Vermont” “ I’m going to hit the
trail for Globe”

   “ Oh, you’ll come back, all right” said
“ Vermont ” with conviction in his voice
“ You’ll want your job back, same as
soldiers always went to reenlist I’ve
heard many a bunkie say at the expira-
tion of his enlistment, that he would not
come back But they always came back,
all the same

Garner Came Back

  “ Now I’m going to arrange with
Yardmaster Mant for you to come back
on your own job and your own run, any
time within four months I’ll tell Mant
you’re hitting the trail as a sorter vaca-
tion—see I reckon two months’ vaca-
tion will be your limit, Garner

  “ And say I want you to do something
for me up at Globe There’s a widow
up there'named Halpin She’s one of the
bravest women in Arizona She’s got
three sons, and all three of ’em, together
with the widow, arecrack shoFs

  “ Many a time, after they had been
besieged by Apaches at their cabin in
Superstition Mountain, I’ve ridden up
there with others of my troop, to clean
out the enemv only to find that the wid-
1

ow and her sons had been standing oft'
the Apaches for days and made the In-
juns think that about two dozen sharp-
shooters were in garrison in that cabin

  “ Well now Garner, two of those
sons have married and settled in Globe,
and the widow is living there, too But
the third son is still scot-free of petti-
coats Fie used often to say to me that
he wanted to hike out to Tucson and
get a job on the railroad just as soon
as his shootin’-irons were no longer need-
ed to protect his mother

  “ So I want you to bring that third son
back here with you, and I’ll get Mant
to put him on the Espee pay-roll It’ll
make a man of him in a new way And
I’ll tell Mant you’re off on recruiting
service—for we need men here”

Wheeler presently got to dabbling in cop-
per-mines, leaving Mrs Wheeler in town
to run the shop

  The bride gamely took up the work,
drummed up trade, sold trappings to the
teamsters who hauled oxe-wagons to and
from the mines, and even invented and
patented a new kind of hame and col-

A MAN NAMED SNEILING LOOMED UP IN TUCSON

  Two months later, just the time named
in “Vermont’s” prediction, Garner rode
back into Tuscon, and with him came
the third son of the Widow Halpin Gar-
ner got his own job and his own run
back, just as “ Vermont ” had promised,
and young Flalpin was put to wiping in
the engine-house at forty a month

  This made two more friends for “ Ver-
mont” And it is with no end of stories
of this kind that the men of Tucson
illustrate for you how “ Vermont ” Sar-
gent gained the popularity that put him
at the head of the Brotherhood of Loco-
motive Firemen after he had been rail-
roading only five years

Mrs Wheeler’s Store

  Thirteen years ago a man from Roch-
ester, New York, and his young bride
—Mr and Mrs Abram Wheeler—came
to Tucson and opened a harness-shop

lar for teams of six horses or more haul-
ing ore

  “ That there is a plucky little woman,”
said Foreman Joe Harrington, formerly
of the engine-house, but now of the shops

  “ She deserves to succeed, and what I
allow is that it is sad and sorrowful
that us railroaders don’t need harness
and so make business for the little
woman”

  Soon after that a boss teamster from
the mines drove into Tucson with an
eight-horse team hitched to an ore-wag-
on the harness on the outfit being in
shreds and tied together with ropes in
a makeshift fashion

  “ Had a accident with these pestif-
erous horses,” announced the boss team-
ster, Ash Fork Pete “ And now I’m
goin’ to telegraph to El Paso for new
harness, waitin’ here till the same comes
up on the train”

  Harrington and the boys who heard
11(3

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

this looked at one another significantly—
and forthwith went into executive ses-
sion with the following result:

  When Ash Fork Pete stepped into the
telegraph office at the station to send
his wire to El Paso, some twenty of the
Tucson railroad men headed by Har-
rington, advanced upon the telegraph1
office in a body, and their leader stepped
tip to the teamster and said :

And “ Ash Fork ” Bought

  “ Ash Fork, we have decided that
home industry is worthy of the patronage
of all outfits headquartering along this
railroad For those who gallivant round
this metropolis of Tucson in particular,
we recommend a certain harness - shop
as is attended to capable by Mrs
Wheeler

  “ And what we have come to con-
cerning this matter is, that folks that
send needless to El Paso for harness
trappings is like to find this metropolis
some malarious hereinafter

   “ You sees, we don’t have no call for
sich harness, we being railroad men But
when we finds others as do need it we
proposes to steer ’em on the trail of Mrs
Wheeler she has hames and collars good
as any from El Paso, and they can be
had without sending her no telegram

  “But I don’t want no home-made
hames and collars, gents, speaks up
Ash Fork Pete

  “Yes, you do, Ash Fork! Twenty
guns were flashed into sight Surrounded
by those twenty guns, Ash Fork was
marched to the harness - shop of Mrs
Wheeler, and not permitted to issue forth
until he had purchased what he needed

In the Greasewood

   In its flight across Arizona, my train
was held up twice The first was at a
tank station in the desert, and there we
stood for three hours, all because of some-
thing unheard of in the East, but com-
mon in the Southwest

  There was not a drop of water in the
tank That would have been nothing
serious, had there been any gasoline with
which to pump water For the lack of
a spoonful of oil we could not budge

  The second involuntary pause was in

the greasewood, miles from nowhere, be-
tween Mescal and Benson, and a wreck
ahead was the cause Here we stood for
seven hours

   I was glad of both these delays and
the chance to roam around in the grease-
wood, because in these periods of train
idleness I had long talks with Old Man
Streamer, old-time cowboy and railroad-
er He was one of the excursionists in
the special train behind us, which, when
we stopped, poked her nose right into
the platform of our observation-car

   The special was carrying a large num-
ber of Southwesterners to Mexico City,
a one-way fare for the round trip With
the stopping of the trains, the passen-
gers from the two trains commingled, to
pass the time away with rambles on the
desert

   “ I shore am enjoying the big delight
at meeting you,” said Old Man Streamer,
in greeting “ I’m traveling this away
now as a towerist, I being out for a holi-
day 011 that towerists’ train yonder, bound
for Mexico City But days I’ve traveled
Ini away, though,” and he indicated the
men in the caboose of a freight that was'
stalled near our own trains

Old Streamer Chews the Fat

   “ Yes, son, after 1 quit cow-punchin' I
went to railroadin’, and stayed at it till
I got some sixty-three wrinkles on my
horns I saved the money instead of
straddling it over the Territories like
those yere softhorns 'you see around on
railroads, and by savin’ that away I’m
rble now to travel as a towerist and see
things leisure-like before I close my lids
for the life everlastin’”

   During that stop in the greasewood I
strolled around with Old Man Streamer,
listening to his endless chain of tales,
until he finally said:

   “ Let’s camp right yere, son,” seating
himself on the ’dobe and lighting his cob
pipe “And I’ll tell you, before I forgit
it, about my friend Frank Baker and
how he come to be a bull-fighter

   “ Frank’s a engineer on the Colorado
Midland I was traveling on his train
only a few days ago—out of New Mex-
ico, and going up Buena Vista way—
when Frank allowed the time had come
when lie ought to turn toreador
RIDING THE RAIL FROM COAST TO COAST

117

   “ It was this a way All of a sudden
 ' the train stopped, and we-all got out to
 see what’s' ailin’ Frank Whatever do
 you think was ailin’ of him Why,
 nothin’ less than a mad bull which was
 facin’ the pilot with planted horns and
 boldin’ us up for fair, right in the middle
 of the rails

   “ ‘ That son of a sea-cook gored a
 track-walker down a piece,’ says Frank
 ‘ I saw the gorin’, I did, and now here
 he is standin’ us off’ With that Frank
 ups and heaves some coal at the toro, but
 the toro acts like he enjoys the festivities,
 and swishes his tail and snorts like lie’s
 saying as how he’d like to chew some-
 body’s mane

In the Matador Business

   “ ‘ I’ll fix that cow,’ swears Frank,
 jumping off his cab and advancing on
 the mad bovine with his fireman’s shovel
 in his hand

   “ ‘ That ain’t no cow,’ says Alf Hogan,
 the fireman ‘ That’s an infuriated male
 head of cattle’

   “ ‘ I know it,’ says Frank ‘an I in-
 tend to turn this yere desert into a bull-
 ring’

   “ Frank charges the bull just like the
 matador in the ring, using the shovel for
 a sword Also the bull charges Frank
 —with results and consequences mighty
 painful to Frank That bull pushes his
 horns into Frank enthusiastic, as if he
 meant to feed and bed down on engi-
 neers the rest of his life Hut that hope
 was cut short by a shot from a gun in
 the hands of Hogan, the fireman

   “ We picked Frank up, decernin’ that
 he was -some unnatural from the gorin’
 he’d had Hut I’m a Mex if Frank

 surrounded by twenty guns, ash fork

 weren’t game, all the same 1 Lift me
 onto my cab,’ says he instanter, minute
 he come to

  “ Afid hanged if he didn’t seize hold
of the throttle and set out to run that
train to Buena Vista! But soon he falls
off his box in a dead faint from loss of
blood, and the fireman has to take the
train in

  “ We carried Frank to his teepee on a
nice little reservation that he had staked
out for to live on, and we thought he
was sure to come abreast of the bright
and shinin’ gates before night

  “ All the same, he did have a hard
pull for life And I allow that the next
time his train is stood up by a mad bull,
with the blood hunger, Frank Baker will
remain in his cab instead of goin’ forth
to play matador”

“ Highpocket’s ” Rattler

  “ 'Nother friend of mine,” continued
Old Man Streamer, while still “ camped ”
on the ’dobe, “ is a Santa Fe engineer out
of Lamv, New Mexico He’s a rattle-
snake fancier, he is His name is High-
pocket Smith

  “ One day, while lolling 011 a lonely
sidin’, Highpocket sees a wounded rat-
tler, and out of sheer good nacher to-

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

ward wild animals, Highpocket picks up
the rattler and carries him home and
nurses him back to health and long life

  “ And it's Gospel I’m tellin’ you, son
as any railroader in New Mexico will
tell you that Highpocket never had to
say, ‘ How sharper than an infant’s
tooth it is to have an ungrateful serpent'
That rattler showed his gratitude—he
did

  “ One night Highpocket awoke out of

  “ The plan was this: Looping him-
self around Jerry’s bedpost, the rattler
put his head in the --watch-pocket of
Jerry’s vest, and the minute six o’clock
ticked the rattler rattled his rattles till
Jerry woke Yes, son, you just arsk
Jerry He’ll tell you-he’s got the cheap-
est and best alarm-clock on the whole
Santa Fe system”

  The Old Man remained silent awhile,
during which time I neither spoke nor

a sound sleep to hear rattlers rattling
right beside his bedside He jumps up,
follows the windings and twistings of
the rattler’s body through the house till
he comes down to the dining-room, where
he sees the snake’s body coiled round the
body of a burglar, boldin’ th’ burglar
hard and fast so’s Highpocket could nab
him

And Jerry Woke Up!

  “ And then there was Jerry Muskovitz,
rodman on the Santa Fe, working at
Helen, New Mexico Jerry was a snake
lover too, just like Highpocket, and he,
too rescued a rattler in distress The
snake followed Jerry home, and lived
with him a whole lot And that time
when Jerry got jacked up for not show in’
up for work early enough of mornin’s
the rattler got to thinkin’ how he could
help his benefactor, and at last hit onto
a plan

barely breathed, for my experience has
taught me never to ask an oldster a
single question After a while, as I had
banked he would do, the Old Man cleared
his speaking-valves and opened up again :

  “ But serious, son, have you ever
heard of Black Jake, the train-robber
Sure you have I knowed it Well
Black Jake was the only man in the
Southwest that ever induced me to quit
my job voluntarily and take a vacation

  “ He made me lose a lot of pay, Black
lake did: and when I think of the
money I might have saved while taking
that vacation in his behalf, it makes me
nauseated

At Third-Drink Time

  “ Black Jake was for awhile the terror
of all trainmen in these Territories He
robbed trains right and l'eft, first on the
Santa Fe, then on the Espee, and we
never knowed where he’d show up next
RIDING THE RAIL FROM COAST TO COAST	119

ne’d ride into a cow town at first-drink
time in the evenin', take a swig of nose-
paint, then go out arid stand up a train
and return to the joint in time for a bit
of nose-paint at third-drink time

  “ He was absolute fearless Black
Jake Was, and he swore he’d never be
taken alive, him bein’ one of those gun-
men that could shopt off the hip

   “ Well, I had a friend, a pardner he
sure was to me, who was express mes-
senger on the Santa Fe His name were
Will yum Klaber, and he was as absolute
fearless as Black Jake or auy other ban-
dit known to us boys

  “ So when, one night in June, some
eleven or twelve years gone now, when
Black Jake and his gang held up the
Santa Fe Overland train west of Gallup,
New Mexico, and ordered Willyum Kla-
ber to fork over the sack of gold and
currency that was there present, Will-
yum Klaber whips out his gun and be-
gins lettin’ fly permisc’us

  “ The next time I saw Willyum he
was dead, of course For Black Jake
attended to him instanter on the occasion
when Willyum refused to obey the ban-
dit’s-orders Black Jake 011 that occa-
sion also dynamited the express-car and
got the sack of gold and currency

Lure for Bandit-Trailers

   “ Immediate, the Santa Fe posted five
thousand dollars reward for Black Jake,
dead or alive Well, son, that reward
brought more bandit-trailers and profes-
sional takers of train-robbers to New
Mexico and Arizona than we ever sees in
these Territories before or since I reckon
there was fully a hundred men, working
independent and in posses, try in’ to run
down Black Jake, dead or alive

   “ It was then that I myself knocked
off work on the line, and allowed I’d de-
vote a vacation to takin’ Black Jake and
earnin’ that five thousand Black Jake
had killed my bosom partner, Willyum
Klaber I would avenge Willyum, and
scoop in the reward shore, too

   “ So I outfits and sets off on a mus-
lang gallivantin’ round the uninhabited
regions of Arizona along the line of the
Arizona and New Mexico Railw’ay that
runs up to Clifton, Arizona, where it was
said Black Jake and his gang retired

after standin’ up the Overland that time
at Gallup

   “ I cavorts around, bushwackin’ in and
 out of cow towns at first, second, and
 third drink times, but never a smell of
 Black Jake do I get Finally I hears that
 he has been trailed to some place mighty
 near to Clifton I had been on the trail
 and off it for some six weeks then, and
 I was dead sick of the job of avengin’
 Willyum and tryin’ to earn that reward
 But 1 decided that I’d make one more
 try up Clifton way to get Black Jake

Cornered at Last!

    “ After three days ift the saddle, I rides
 into Clifton, red-hot on the very heels of
 Black Jake—only to hear one of the hun-
 dred professional bandit-takers employed
 by the Santa Fe say':

   “ ‘ Good news, Mr Streamer Black
 Take is in that prison at Clifton that’s
 hewed out of the solid rock, and is one
 of the most unique prisons in this or any
 other country 1 presume, Mr Streamer,
 that congratulations are in order from
 you, you bein’ particular friend to Will-
 yum Klaber, the same havin’ been slaugh-
 tered by Black Jake—since 1 am the one
 who landed Jake prompt in the stone
  wickiup’

   “ Oh, yes, son I congratulated that
 feller, you believe The hour bein’ sec-
 ond-drink time, I allowed it was in order
 to proceed to the joint in the Red Light
 and there clink the crystal in token of
 his glad news We clinked, and then I
 hiked back to the rails, resolved never
 again to quit wages to avenge some
 friend, not even if I found another Will-
 yum Klaber

   “ Concernin’ of that same prison that’s
 ' hewn in the solid rocks at Clifton, I'll
 come again, and then I guess I’ll get
 back to my fellow towerists, which has
 arsked me to set in a game of poker

The Clifton Bastile

   “ Before proceedin’ with what I’m now
 opening up on, I must paint you a pic-
 ture of that prison It is composed of
 three big cells forming the letter ‘ T,’ the
 same having been blasted out original by
 a mining company for the incarceratin’
 of miners that were needin’ punishment
120

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  “ The prison has for entrance a 'dobe
hut that stands not ten feet from the
tracks of the Arizona and New Mexico
Railway The tracks of the railway run
along there between the entrance to thfe
prison on one side and the San Francisco
River on the other

  “ Close to the 'dobe hut that forms the
entry to the prison there is a switchman’s
hut, and another hut where the prison

the spring of 1891 the San Francisco
River cut loose and flooded things per-
misc’us It riz ancT it riz, till it reached
the ’dobe huts at the entrance to the
prison It riz—that is so quick-like—
that it carried off the guard and all but
drowned the switchman

   “ I think it pretty safe to say that in all
my born days I never see a river that riz
as high as that one

   “ In the mornin’, while
the flood was still ragin’,
the switchman, he bein’
perched on top of the ’dobe
hut at the entrance to the
prison, became aware that
some men of the town of
Clifton, on the opposite
bank of the river, was try-
in’ to attract his attention

  “ The switchman watch-
ed, and presently he sees a
big sign—a board—raised
'-on high, bearing these
words writ with charcoal
by the Sheriff of Clinton:
“ ‘ Get Friday out of the
Balliwax’-

  “ Friday, son, was the
lone and only prisoner
then in the jail, he bein’
in durance vile for seek-
in’ to make his fortune by
standin’ up a train of the
Arizona and New Mexico
Railroad

  “ The switchman, ac-
cordin’, now swims down
track to dry land, and tells
the miners there what the
sign across the river says
The miners then takes
dynamite and jumps up to
the rock prison and sets to
work to blast out the pris-
oner, Friday

   “ They puts a charge into that cooler
that would have blown up a town, making
a hole big enough to crawl through

But Friday Came Not

   “ ‘ Come out of the Balliwax, Friday’
the miners and the switchman cry in
chorus But Friday came not, neither
did he show up to take advantage of his
blessed liberty

THE SWITCHMAN

guard lives—that guard’s principal work
bein’ to pass food through the bars of the
prison window — bars fastened in the
rock on the face of the cliff—to the pris-
oners

  “ On the prison side of the river is
mostly the prison and the mines On
the other side of the river is the town

fixed in your mind

  “ 1 f so, I may proceed to state that in

  “ So inwards step the miners and the
switchman, to find Friday, wounded and
unable to move, all on account of the
flying-stone effect resultin’ from the blast

  “ ‘ Look here, you-all,’ moans Friday
‘ what do you mean by trying to kill a
man in order to save his life ’

  “ And now, son, did L say that would
be about all Well, this here poker-
game I’m scheduled to set into has re-
minded me of just one more And as
the trains give 110 sign nor signal smoke
of breaking camp, 1 allow there’s time
for me to frame up this supplement

  “ The poker-game reminds me of the
hand Marshal Moore drew up at Phoenix,
recent One of the railroad boys up there
phoned Moore to come to the station on
a run, and capture a lunatic that was
bucking and prancing around loose, and
was frightening away possible patrons of
the Maricopa and Phcenix Railway

  “ Moore hikes down to the depot, and
the boys there put him next to a Mexican
known in the town as Miguel Ceres
Miguel now looked tame enough to eat
out of the hand of almost anybody, and,
in reply to all Moore’s questions, he an-
swered rational-like and sane

Dotty Dialogues

  “ ‘ This yere ain’t no lunatic,’ says
Moore contemptuous, addressing the boys

  “And Moore turns to go Just then
up springs Miguel and tags after Moore,
shouting: ‘What did you dowith all
those women-’

  “ ‘ What women  ’ arsks Moore

  “ 1 Why, all those ladies you sent up
in a balloon from this depot larst night ’
“ Well, son, Moore annexed that Mexi-
can prompt But before he could get
away from the depot, one of the boys out
of the ticket-office came runnin’ up to
him, sayin’:

  “ ‘ Marshal, some one wants you 011 the
telephone’

  “ Moore goes to the wire and hears
some one arsk him to come at once to a
certain teepee in Phcenix and take posses-
sion by right of eminent domain of a
crazy man The marshal thereby pinches
himself to make sure he’s not in a dream
or sufferin’ from the treemers

  “ Decidin’ that all’s w-ell with him to
date,-he takes the lunatic Miguel in tow

and perambulates the nearest route to the
teepee at the street number mentioned on
the wire He enters the teepee and finds
a Mexican lying on a cot and other Mex-
icans standin’ round, cryin’:

  “ ‘ Take him prisoner, marshal This
is Antonio Flores, and he’s got a fire in
his stomach’

Accordin’ to Hoyle

  “ Moore questioned Antonio, and An-
tonio answered accordin’ to Hoyle

   “ 1 This ain’t 110 crazy man,’ announced
Moore resultin’ly, turnin’ to depart

  “ But just then the Mexican 011 the
cot cried out:

  “ ‘ Oh, this fire in my stomach I am
only a stove and some one has lighted a
fire inside of me’

   “ ‘ Are you a fire-eater ’ arsked Moore
“ ‘ No, sc nor, but I’m the fire-box of
a locomotive and soft eoal is making a

  After the seven - hour wait in the
greasewood, we pulled on eastward
through Benson, Cochise and Boxvie in
Arizona, then to Lordsburg, New Mex-
ico, where passengers connected with the

tioned by Old Man Streamer—that road
running up to Clifton, Arizona

A Dead Sheep

  By the time I had passed through
the New Mexico town of Deming and
began running over the tail-end of the
division into El Paso, I was in posses-
sion of many stories of railroad life in
the last of the Territories—of which the
following are given here as the most in-
teresting:

  On the Santa Fe Railroad south of
Santa Fe, a train having Engineer
Reardon at the throttle was nearing the
Arroyo C’hamez It was late in the af-
122

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

ternoon of July 15, 1908 As he rushecl
northward toward the arroyo, Reardon
saw a dead sheep lying on the right of
way

   Looks like he’d been drowned,”
Reardon shouted to his fireman

  “Yes! Think the arroyo is spilling
over,” replied the fireman

  Pretty soon they passed another dead
sheep, and then a third

   There was more than one animal in
that arroyo when the spill came,” said
Reardon, slowing down They passed
two more dead sheep, and then Reardon
stopped dead, remarking that a little in-
vestigation was in order

Sixty Cents a Sheep

  Reardon hated to stop his train, for
he knew that every such stop cost his
company sixty cents, that being the esti-
mated expense of bringing a train to a
full stop and of accelerating the speed
again to normal Multiply sixty cents
by every dead sheep you pass and it
•will amount to many dollars in time
Nevertheless, Reardon decided that so
many carcasses were nothing less than a
warning of something unusual going on
at the Arroyo Chamez

  “ What I want to know is, how did
these carcasses get here” he said

   “ It’s mighty wet hereabouts,” said the
fireman “ Looks like the arroyo had
been sending a gush of water down the
line”

  And as the two men advanced on foot
to investigate, lo! a wall of water was
seen approaching—a sight that made
them scamper back to their cab The
water rushed by, flooding the floor of
the cab and putting out the fire in the
engine

  The water subsided quickly, however,
and when Reardon and others of the
train crew walked up track again to in-
vestigate, they found hundreds of dead
sheep Moreover, they found that some
three hundred feet of track had been
washed away this side of the arroyo, also
that the trestle over the arroyo was gone

   Cloudburst! ” announced a track-
walker “ It’ll take twenty-four hours
to relay track and reopen communica-
tion by rail with Santa Fe, so you fellows
might as well hit the hay”

  “It’s good I didn’t mind spending
sixty cents to take a peek,” said Rear-
don, with a self-satisfied smile

A Terrific Tank

  The most novel load ever hauled by
rail was under the direction of Emmett
Stansel, foreman of bridges and build-
ings, with the assistance of engine 0155,
Engineer Weedon, and Conductor Mike

calls up the sheriff’s office aW says:—

Murphy, all of the New Mexico divi-
sion of the Santa Fe

  The novelty of the load lay in the
height and width of the thing hauled
It was as high as eight ordinary men
It was as high as that four-and-a-half-
story office building in Albuquerque It
was as wide as a city lot It weighed
60000 pounds

    It was one of our standard steel
tanks,” said my informant “ Now, if
you want something clumsy to wrestle
with in the freight-traffic way, justyou
attempt to move that fcind of a tank four
miles over two curves with an elevation
of five inches—for that’s the distance
we moved that big tank and such were
the conditions of the same

  “ Our foreman, Emmett Stansel, sure
knew his business He first lifted that
tank off its foundation Then he raised
it up with jacks, till it was high enough
in the air for us to back two steel flat
cars under it When the tank was all
braced and fastened down, an engine
was hitched on and the novel moving

years ago Nothing could get bv the
train pulling that tank, you bet, ’cause
we occupied abotft all the right of way
there was, our load being some twenty-
four feet wide, the diameter of the tank,
and forty-three feet in the air It was
the clumsiest package of freight the

had to carry”

Meeting Sherlock

  Before coming to Williams, Frank
Sherlock had for eight years served as
deputy sheriff of Mojave County, cap-

lock put the stranger to work under his
own eye

  In two weeks, however, Sherlock dis-
charged the new hand—for good rea-
sons Two days later the stranger was
seen holding whispered converse with
one of the youngest of the Arizona
Rangers, named Woods On the third
day Woods rode up to where Frank
Sherlock was directing the operations
of his men, pushed a pistol into Sher-
lock’s abdomen and exclaimed:

  “You’re under arrest—Charlie Bly ! ”

  “ No necessity for the shootin’-irons,”
said Sherlock, or Blv, quietly “ That
discharged skunk has been talking to you,
that’s easy to see I guess you’ve got
me, kid”

  The next day, Conductor Osgood, on

his train on a tick-

and again found
Captain Christman,
who this time held
two tickets, each
reading: “From
Williams to Santa

man was Frank

 “Good Lord!”
exclaimed Osgood

“ You don’t mean
that your prisoner is that contractor at
Williams! ”

“Sure thing! ” replied the captain

  “ This man that you respect as Frank
Sherlock is Charlie Ely, who rode away
from the pen in our Territory eleven years
ago on the warden’s horse

  “ An ex-convict from the same prison

SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS

ROLAND BURKE is a young boy sightseeing in San Francisco during a visit to his
uncle, Richard Engle, a famous explorer While standing on the dock- he is
alarmed by a crowd of struggling men rushing down the street, evidently pursued by the
police, and in his astonishment is hustled into the boat for which they are making One
of the men, who is struggling with the others, is kidnaped onto a vessel, and Roland,
though unobserved, is also unable to escape The ship puts out, defying the forts On
the boat he is discovered by Ruth Holland, who also seems to be there against her will,
and who seems quite familiar with Richard Engle, though there seems to be some mis-
understanding between them In her cabin Ruth is annoyed by a man named Welch, who
seems to have some power among the cutthroats Engle interferes

    Captain Hawson interferes against the persecution of Engle by Welch, and Welch
shows his power by deposing the captain and making him a prisoner The captain joins
forces with Engle, the boy, and Miss Holland They attempt to recover the ship

    They are captured again, but the captain manages to communicate with a United
States cruiser by means of a wireless apparatus in a secret alcove in his cabin He then
puzzles the mutineers by hiding Miss Holland in the alcove

CHAPTER XIV	evidently trying to do something to post-

pone the torture

When the spokesman returned, Welch
left him to guard me, and went in to see
Captain Hawson

“ Will you tell me what you have done
with the woman he asked

“ I will not”

“ Then we’ll torture the boy until he
tells”

“You 'cowardly cur!” the captain
screamed “ Let the boy alone Try to
torture it out of me”

“ I think the boy will be easier,” Welch
said, laughing

“ You have no right to torture the
bov,” the captain said

“If you insist, we’ll torture you first,”
Welch replied angrily

“ It will do you no good,” the captain
said

“ We’ll see,” Welch cried “ There is
nothing in the law ~to prevent me tor-
turing you You have given us enough
trouble Why did you cut that hole in

        WAY hurried the man
           Welch closed the door
           and sat down on one of
           the heavy chairs near it

                  “ Go back to the bunk,” ,
                he ordered me

  That order pleased me most The re-
volver Captain Hawson had taken from
the captured guard was in the bunk, be-
neath the blanket

  1 lay down, and pretended to sob
Welch seemed sick and weak, and once
he arose and opened the door and glanced
down the passage to see whether the man
was coming back As he did so, I slipped
the revolver from beneath the blanket,
and put it in my hip-pocket

  In the next cabin Captain Hawson was
cursing and trying to get free of the men
who guarded him He had heard Welch
threaten to torture me, of course, and was

the cabin wall What have you done
with the woman  ”

  “Are there any more questions” de-
manded the captain, laughing mockingly

  Welch cursed, and ordered the men to
seize him When they had him in the
passage, taking him to the temple-room,
where the great aitu sat on his throne,
the spokesman left me and went out and
locked the door

  Welch was so intent upon the torture
that he forgot one thing—he had left the
door of the captain’s cabin open, think-
ing -no one was in there, and the hole was
still in the wall

  Captain Hawson fought them all the
way down the jjassage As soon as they
had gone some distance I crept to the
hole and peered through There was no
one in the captain’s cabin, and 1 crawled
into it, and ran to the door and looked
out There was but one man in the pas-
sage and, as 1 watched, Welch called to
him and he-went into the temple-room

  I ran back to the panel “ Miss
Ruth!” 1 whispered

  “ Is that you, Roland ”

  “ Yes”

-	“What are they doing”

  “ They are trying to make Captain
Hawson tell where you are”

  “ You must let me out,” she said
“ Enough have suffered for my sake al-
ready”

  “ I cannot do that,” I answered

  “ Let me out, Roland please They
must not torture him”

  “ I cannot let you out, Miss Holland,”
1 replied “ They will kill you at sun-
rise if I do”

  “ But we must not let them torture the
captain to save me,” she said

  “ The captain would blame me if I let
you out,” I said' “And Uncle Dick
would always blame me”

  “ But we must try to do something,”
she said

  “ Wait! ” I implored

  I ran to the door and looked into the
passage again All the men were in the
temple-room I went out quietly, and
hurried in the other direction until I
came to the third cabin There I knocked
softly on the door

  “Who is there” my uncle’s voice
asked

  “It is Roland, Uncle Dick Can you

break out They are torturing Captain
Hawson to make him tell where he has
hidden Miss Holland I have a revolver,
and there is no one in the passage”

   “ Stand to one side,” he directed

  I stepped to one side, and heard him
walking around in the cabin Then there
was a crash as he hurled himself against
the door, a second crash, and the lock
snapped and the door burst outward
Uncle Dick stood beside me

  The noise of the breaking door had
been heard by those in the temple-room,
and now they came pouring into the pas-
sage to see what it meant With Uncle
Dick at my heels, I dashed into the cap-
tain’s cabin, and together we slammed
the door shut and threw the table and
heavy chair against it

  “ Quick! ” I cried to Uncle Dick

  I ran to the panel and opened it
“ Quick ! Get in with Miss Holland ! ”
I whispered “ That will puzzle them
more You cannot fight out here”

  1 half pushed him into the alcove
“Dick!” I heard Ruth Holland say,
and 1 saw him take her in his arms just
as I closed the panel

  The men were hammering at the door,
forcing it open I ran to the hole in
the wall, crawled through, and threw my-
self on the bunk Just as I did so, the
door of my cabin opened, and the spokes-
man hurried in He looked at me made
a peculiar noise in his throat, then went
out again I heard him calling for Welch

  As I lay upon the bunk I heard the
men jabbering in the captain’s cabin
Welch’s voice was raised in anger Pres-
ently he came in to me

  “ You helped your uncle to get out of
his cabin,” he said

  “ What if I did” I retorted

  “ Where did you put him ”

   “ He is not in here”

  “ He is somewhere near The men saw
you enter the captain’s cabin He’s with
Miss Holland Where are they”

  “ I have said they are not in this
cabin” I said

  “ Will vou tell me where they are ”

  “ No!”

  He called two of the men, and they
led me down the passage toward the tem-
ple-room There seemed no help for it
now Torture awaited me, unless there
was a chance for me to use the revolver
THE DAUGHTER OF THE IDOL

127

  The men left the captain’s cabin, all
except one left behind as guard, and fol-
lowed us I was not used kindly as we
made that short journey down the pas-
sage Welch grasped my injured arm
tightly, so that the pain almost made me
cry out  but I did not give him the sat-
isfaction of hearing me do so

  Captain Hawson was standing just in-
side the temple - room door, a man on
either side of him They stood me near
him, facing the aitu

  “ Will you tell what you have done
with your uncle and the woman ” Welch
demanded again

  I saw Captain Hawson’s face light up
when Welch mentioned my uncle

  “ They are together,” I replied, to tell
the captain what had happened He
flashed me a look of commendation

  “Tell me where they are!” Welch
cried “ I have done with your nonsense
I’ll take your life-blood from you, drop
by drop, unless you tell! ”

  “ I will not tell,” I replied

  Welch turned to one of the men who
was working at the foot of the steps
“ Get the hot iron! ” he commanded

  My uninjured arm was free I reached
to my hip quickly, and got a grip on the
revolver The man started toward me
with the iron, a wicked-looking instru-
ment, white-hot

  My hand came up quickly, the revolver
in it I fired, not at any one of them,
but into the roof of the cabin

  The shot had the desired effect The
men guarding us, astonished at the shot,
stepped aside for a moment That mo-
ment was all we needed I found the
captain beside me in the door, found that
he was grasping the revolver, tearing it
from my hand

  “ Back to the cabin! ” he cried

  I took him at his word, and, turning
into the passage, raced back toward the
cabin He came after me, firing once
more as the first head showed at the tem-
ple-room door

  But we ran into more trouble as we
reached the cabin, for the man left be-
hind as guard rushed at us Captain
Hawson fired again, this time with effect
The guard toppled over in the passage,
and the captain grasped his revolver and
ran on

  The others were coming down the

passage now, uttering cries of rage, urged
on by Welch’s screams and curses We
dashed into the cabin and slammed the
door The captain handed me my re-
volver, and retained the one he bad taken
from the guard he had wounded

  “ Into the alcove! ” he commanded

  The door swung back ! We sprang in,
and the panel closed again We heard
the others crash into the cabin, shrieking
wildly, and we heard their exclamations
of consternation when they did not
find us

  “ Keep quiet,” the captain whispered
to us “ This is a mystery that will cause
them some annoyance”

  I felt some one’s arm go around my
shoulders, felt some one’s lips brush my
cheek, and heard Ruth’s voice say:

  “Boy! Boy!”

  And then a stronger arm was thrown
around me—Uncle Dick’s: And in the
position we were standing it must have
been around Ruth Holland, too

      CHAPTER XV
      We Capture Welch

'VIT’E heard Welch come into the cabin

“ Where are they ” he demanded

  “ They are gone, master,” the spokes-
man replied

  “ Gone where ”

  “I do not know When we entered
the cabin they were gone We saw them
run in here”

  “ Search the cabins! ” Welch com-
manded

  We heard them rushing about, opening
and closing doors, running back and
forth through the passage, and to the
deck After a time all of them returned

  “ We cannot find them, master,” the
spokesman said “ They are gone  they
have vanished We do not like this sort
of business”

  The men were muttering among them-
selves

  “ Silence! ” Welch commanded “ What
do you fear  They came into this cabin,
and therefore they are some place aboard
the steamer There is no mystery about
it at all They simply have some hiding-
place that we have not discovered Search
again”

  We heard Welch tell the spokesman
123	THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

to leave a guard on the cabins, and that
he would have the ship searched from
one end to the other The men went
away, and there was deep silence But
Uncle Dick whispered to me to remain
absolutely silent, for one of the men
might be inside the cabin listening

  The alcove was very small, and we
began to grow weary The air was get-
ting foul too It was daylight outside
now, and the sea had calmed, for the
steamer did not roll and pitch as for-
merly

  While we huddled there in the alcove
there was a tiny flash behind us, and that
half-distinct crashing which I had heard
before when Captain Hawson worked at
the wireless Now he uttered an excla-
mation under his breath

  “ What is it ” Uncle Dick whispered
“ It is the cruiser calling,” the captaiii
said “ I gave them a private signal
when I was talking”

  “ Are you going to answer ” Ruth
asked

  “ It is risky business”

  “ But they may have something im-
portant to communicate,” Uncle Dick
put in

“ I'll run the risk,” the captain said
We changed positions as noiselessly as
we could, so that he could get to the
keyboard Then he reached for the key
and answered the call

  His answer was acknowledged, and the
message came He whispered it to Ruth
and I, for Uncle Dick could read it for
himself:

  Captain Hawson,

     On Board Steamer Faraway:
  Cruiser will make island as rapidly as
  possible, and land marines to protect
  you if you are already prisoners ashore
  When do you expect to arrive at
  island 

  Captain Hawson reached for the key
and replied:

Faraway should reach island within
forty-eight hours How near are you 

    We cannot reach island for at least
  three days

  The captain tapped in reply:

    Make it as soon as possible Two of
  us are doomed to execution as soon as
  we are landed, but we’ll try to detain
  them

  “ O K” wired the cruiser, and then
the communication was broken

  No sooner had the message been’fin-
'ished than we heard Welch’s voice in the
cabin again

  “ What was it” he was asking

   “ Some peculiar noise, master, so thi
guard says,” the spokesman replied “ He
was standing in the center of the cabin
when he heard it It seemed to come
from the wall”

   “ What sort of a noise ”

   “ He said it sounded like tapping, yet
not exactly lik« that either He is be-
coming afraid All of the men are
becoming afraid These things must be
explained soon, master, or there will be
trouble If the men begin to fear—”

  “ There is no cause for fear,” Welch
said “We are still searching the ship
They are somewhere on board”

   “ But what is to be done, master ”

  “ (jo up and take command of the
ship My wound weakens me,” Welch
said, “and I'll remain here on guard”

  “ You want a man with you”

   “ Leave one man,” he instructed

  We heard the spokesman go away,
heard Welch talking to the one man left
behind He was trying to convince the
man, Captain Hawson whispered to me,
that our disappearance was not due to
any supernatural power

  Another hour passed, an hour in that
stuffy hole, with its foul air and its dis-
tressing heat We were huddled so close
together that we could scarcely move

  “If weonly had more room,” Captain
Hawson said once, “ I’d try another little
trick”

  “Cannot one of us leave” Uncle
Dick asked

   “ Not Miss Holland, for she is doomed
to die as soon as they find her,” the cap-
tain replied “ The boy cannot go, for
they will torture him They will torture
me, too, and you, Mr Engle I fail to
see how any of us can leave in safety”

   “ What is the little trick you want to
play  ” Uncle Dick asked

   “ I want' to capture Welch,” the cap-
tain answered

  “And frighten the men to death”
Miss Holland asked “ Is that your
idea”

   “ Yes”

  “ But how will we gain anything by
THE DAUGHTER OF THE IDOL

129

doing that” she asked “They would
only hurry to the island all the faster”

   “ When superstitious men are frenzied
by queer happenings, they make mis-
takes,” the captain said “ A little mis-
take, made at the right time, may save
us If we could only remain in the
alcove until the cruiser arrives—”

   “ That is impossible,” said Uncle Dick
“It will be three days, and we’ll have
to get out of here within the hour The
air is foul already”

   “ We’ll have to fight for it, then,” the
captain said

  “ Then we’ll fight for it,” my uncle
replied

  “But what can we do” the captain
demanded “ If we could slip from the
alcove without any one seeing us and let
Miss Holland remain here, with your
nephew, all would be well We don’t
want to betray Miss Holland’s hiding-
place”

  They ceased speaking, for Welch was
tapping on the panel It was evident
that he had either heard us whispering,
-or had suspected the secret alcove His
investigation seemed to tell him nothing,
however, for we heard him leave the wall
and go back to the chair

   “ I-am growing faint,” he said to the
guard “ (Jo to the medicine-chest and
get me liquor”

  The man hurried away “ Now is your
chance,” my uncle whispered to the cap-
tain

  Captain Hawson' touched the spring,
and the panel slid back noiselessly In
a flash he and Uncle Dick were upon
Welch’s back, and, while Captain Haw-
son bound him, Uncle Dick inserted a
gag in his mouth

CHAPTER XVI

We Receive a Surprise

D EFORE any of us could make reply,
we heard the guard hurrying along
the corridor I’ll never forget the look
on his face as he entered the cabin and
saw the four of us sitting against the wall
under the port-hole

He had a bottle of liquor in his hand 
and, when he caught sight of us and saw
that Welch was missing, he dropped the
bottle on the floor Then, with an ear-
9 R R

splitting scream that would have done
credit to an Indian on the war-path, he
fled up the passage

  We waited in silence, while a chorus
of cries on the deck above warned us
that the guard had aroused all the crew
They came pouring down into the pas-
sage, with the spokesman at their head
He came to a stop just inside the door,
the others grouped about him His eyes
bulged his hands shook

  “You have come back” he gasped
None of us made reply

  “Where were you What has hap-
pened Where is the master”

  He shouted the questions at us as swift-
ly as his lips could form the words And
none of us made reply

  “ Why don’t you speak ” he screamed
“Are you human beings, or ghosts”

  It was an unlucky word for him to
speak The men behind him looked once,
screamed once, then fled up the passage
again, shrieking at each other

  “ Come back! Come back! ” the
spokesman shouted at them in English
Then, realizing that they could not un-
derstand, he shouted at them in his own
language, and they came back, one at a
time, silently, staring at us with fearful
eyes

  “Where did you come from” the
spokesman demanded of the captain

  “ We’ve been in the cabin all the time,”
the captain answered

  “ Where is Mr Welch ”

  “ I am not keeping track of Mr
Welch,” replied the captain “ Perhaps
he is on deck”

  “He is not on deck — he was here
watching the cabin”

  “ Is that so” the captain asked, smi-
ling

  The spokesman took another step into
the cabin “ However, now that you are
here, we'll attend to business,” he said
“ There is a certain duty to perform, and
it is already an hour past rise of sun”

  “ You mean the execution of this young
lady” the captain asked

  “ Yes”

  “ Then there will be no execution
Miss Holland has reconsidered She is
ready to apologize before the great aitu,
and to go on with the ceremony Some-
thing displeased her before—that is why
she refused to be betrothed”
130

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  The man’s face lit up What his peo-
ple most desired, he knew, was the mar-
riage of Welch to Miss Holland

  “ What you say gives me great joy,”
he said “ The ceremony shall be com-
pleted at once I will have you escorted
to the temple-room, and will send a man
to search for the master Perhaps he
was taken ill and retired to his cabin

  So we were taken down the passage
and to the Temple-room again and there
Uncle Dick, Captain Hawson, and my-
self stood against the wall as before,
while Ruth went to the front of the steps
and stood ready and waiting

  The man returned with the intelligence
that Welch was not in his cabin and
could not be found Another man was
despatched and he too, returned to say
that Welch had strangely disappeared

  The spokesman seemed puzzled “ Why
do you not go on with the ceremony”
the captain asked him “ The great aitu
will be displeased if you postpone it
again”

  “ The great aitu must have mercy,” the
spokesman muttered “ There can be no
ceremony until the master is here to do
his part”

  “ Then let us go on deck and get fresh
air,” the captain said “ Send your
guards along The troubles of the night
have left us worn out Miss Holland
must have fresh air and rest, or she will
not be able to continue the ceremony
when your master is found The wound
on her arm made by the hot iron, has
sickened her Do you want her to be ill
when the island is reached ”

  His words seemed to bother the fanatic,
for he ordered the men to take us on
deck and to serve us breakfast there
Then the search for Welch began again

  We really enjoyed those two hours on
deck, after being confined below in the
alcove, and I never relished a meal as
I did that breakfast We talked of or-
dinary things, for the guards were al-
ways near us  and, after we had finished
eating, we sat back near the wheel and
watched the sunshine play upon the sea

  At the end of the two hours the spokes-
man came to us, and addressed Captain
Hawson

  “ Did you see anything of the master
Where were you hiding Why did you
show yourself again”

  “ I haven’t time to answer questions
which do not concern me,” the captain
replied  Are you going to continue the

ceremony  ”

  “ We cannot until the master is found”
“ Then you'd better hurry up and find
him The great aitu will be angry”

  The spokesman hurried away, crying
out his orders to the others Another
hour passed and the guards, squatting
on the deck near us, prevented conversa-
tion except on ordinary topics Finally,
however, when some of them were called
away to attend to other duties, we found
that we could talk without being over-
heard

  “ What is to be our next move ” Un-
cle Dick asked

  “If we could get control of the ship—”
the captain began

  “ You cannot,” Uncle Dick replied
“ Even if we conquer the men on deck,
the engine-room force will learn of it
and will not obey your orders”

  “ But we may be able to delay the
ship, to give the cruiser a chance to over-
take us,” the captain said

  “If we could do that—” began Uncle
Dick

  “ We can try,” said Captain Hawson
  “Have you a plan”

  “ We have two revolvers Mine has
five cartridges in it How many has
yours, Roland  ”

   “ Two, sir,” I replied

  “ And we failed to get the one on
Welch,” the captain said “ That is what
comes of being in a hurry”

  Ruth Holland smiled at us “ I was
not in such a hurry,” she said “ I have
Welch’s revolver I took it while you
were putting him in the alcove Pie was
trying to hide it”

  “ Good girl! ” the captain cried

  “ There are six cartridges in it,” she
said

  “ That makes thirteen shots in all, an
unlucky number,” the captain put in

  “ Unlucky, but perhaps not for us,”
said Uncle Dick “Now what is your
plan  ”

  “ Let Miss Holland hand you the re-
volver she has when none of them are
looking,” he replied “ We’ll have to
make a fight for it They’ll be careful
not to harm Miss Holland, but the rest
of us will have to take our chances”
THE DAUGHTER OF THE IDOL

131

  He explained his plan at length, and
'then we arose and started forward, as
though we were ready to go below again
The guard got up lazily to follow us
Two other men moved toward us across
the deck

  “ Wait,” the spokesman cried when he
saw us “ I am not ready for you to go
below yet”

  So we walked on toward the forecas-
tle, for it suited our plans Presently we
found ourselves forward of them all,
with nothing between us and our old
barricade near the bowsprit

  “ Now! ” Captain Hawson cried, and
we made a dash for it

  Those on deck realized our purpose
instantly Before we had gained secur-
ity the bullets were flying about us but
none of them found a human target We
got down behind the barricade without
firing one of our precious shots

  The spokesman came running across
the deck toward us

  “What do you mean” he cried
“ What are you doing up there  I am
ready for you to go below now”

  “ We don’t care to go below, thank
you,” the captain said “ We prefer it
up here”

  “I’ll send my men for you!”

  “ You’ll send your men below, and
go with them, and remain there,” the
captain said sternly “ Do so at once,
or we open fire! ”

  “ You have no weapons,” the spokes-
man cried

  “ You see one,” replied the captain,
holding up his revolver

  “ If you don’t come down I’ll send
the men after you! ”

  “ Send them! ” retorted the captain
The fanatic cried out an order, and
the men swarmed toward us It looked
like the old battle over again When the
nearest man reached the barrier, the
captain fired, and the man fell The
others retreated, but secured places of
safety, and from their new positions
rained shots at us

  “ Down, all of you,” the captain or-
dered “ Let them waste their ammuni-
tion”

  In a few minutes the firing ceased, and
we looked over the barrier to see what
was taking place

  “ I give you one more chance to come

down ! ” the leader cried “ The great
aitu commands it! Death is to be pre-
ferred to dishonor, and dishonor will
be my lot unless you are conquered So
come down, or I’ll burn you out—burn
the ship with you—go out' with you to
meet the great aitu in eternity! ”

  He held a firebrand in his hand, and
as he spoke he waved it above his head

  “Will you come down” he cried

  “No!” Captain Hawson answered

  “ Then I’ll burn you out! ”

  “ You’ll never live to apply the
torch ! ” the captain cried

  He stood up, and leveled his revolver
at the spokesman, meanwhile watching
the others One of them fired, and the
bullet whistled past the captain’s head

  He dodged behind the barrier

  And at the moment he dodged the
spokesman gave a scream and ran for-
ward with the burning brand in his hand
I saw it tossed above his head, saw it
fall at the bottom of the mass of rope
and sail-cloth The flames sprang out,
caught the cloth, and began to eat their
way toward us

  Then some one staggered forward
from the stern

  “Fools! Fools!” he screamed “Put
out the fire ! ”

  It was Welch

  Whipped into action by his words, the
men sprang forward to obey They threw
the burning cloth into the sea, threw
the rope after it, stamped out the flames
And while they did so we watched with-
out offering violence, glad that we had
again been saved from death, and won-
dering at the appearance of Welch on
the deck

  We did not have to wonder long, for
he was a natural boaster

  “ The next time you put a man in an
alcove,” he said, “ be sure that there is
nothing there on which he can saw his
bonds in two and be sure the panel is
so strong that even a wounded man can-
not crash through it! ”

CHAPTER XVII
Fair Speech and False Action

AT first the full significance of what
Welch’s escape meant did not
strike us It was the spokesman who,
132

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

running across the deck eagerly, his face
lit up with a smile, anxious to correct
himself in the eyes of the man he called
master for having set the fire, first
brought to us a realization of what it
meant

  “ Master, master,” he cried, “ the
woman will go on with the ceremony,
low that you have returned to us! ”

   Ruth gave a little cry when she heard
him speak, and I heard Captain Hawson
curse softly to himself

   “ Now there’ll be a lot more trouble,”
Uncle Dick said “This will be the
fight of fights”

  Welch was talking to the spokesman,
but we could not hear what he was say-
ing Captain Hawson decided „to take
the initiative, and standing up behind
the barricade he called to those below

  “ Miss Holland absolutely refuses to
go on with the ceremony, which is re-
pugnant to her,” the captain said

   “ Then she must die immediately,” the
spokesman answered

  “ There are three of us here, well
armed,” continued the captain, “ who
will fight to the death to protect Miss
Holland I serve notice upon you now,
that if we are molested we shall shoot
Moreover, we are going to make an at-
tempt to get control of the ship again,
and after one minute has passed we’ll
fire on any one within range who tries
to oppose us”

  Welch turned to the spokesman and
talked rapidly in the man’s own lan-
guage Then they both went aft, and we
saw no more of them for some time
The steamer continued on her way, rush-
ing through the golden sea, carrying
us to the strange land where there was
nothing to expect but death

  “ What do you think they will try to
do” Ruth Holland asked of Uncle
Dick

  “ It is hard to tell” he answered
“ Welch will try some bit of strategy,
that is certain”

  “ Yes,” the captain said “ But you
forget some things While Welch is
angry enough to try any cruelty, and
 though he wants to keep in the good
graces of the fanatics by pretending to
honor the laws of the great aitu,_ yet
he does not wish to see Miss Holland
executed If he conquers us now, and

we are captured, he will have no excuse
for not ordering her executed immedi-
ately”

  “ You think we’ll not be molested,
then” my uncle asked

  “ I think we’ll be allowed freedom un-
til the island is reached We ought to
reach the island by to-morrow morning,
and it is now almost noon”

  Another hour passed, and then Welch
appeared again, carrying a white cloth
fastened to a stick He stopped directly
beneath us

  “What do you want ” Uncle Dick
asked

  “ To talk with you May I come up ”

  “ Talk from where you are”

  “ I don't want every one to hear,” he
said

  “ Then one of us will come down,”
the captain said “ But see that you try
no tricks, for if you do you’ll never get
aft alive”

   “ I’ll try no tricks,”- Welch said

  Uncle Dick looked at the captain

  “ You go,” he said

  Captain Hawson left the barricade
and went to the deck below, and stood
within a few feet of Welch while he
talked Uncle Dick held his revolver
ready to use in case of treachery Al-
though they spoke in low tones, the wind
carried their words to us

  “ Will you go to your cabins ” Welch
asked

  “And be captured” the captain de-
manded

  “ I’ll see that you are not molested
until the island is reached”

  “ I’m sorry, but I cannot rely 011 your
word,” replied the captain

  “ Certainly you know,” said Welch,
“ that I do not seek MissHoIland’s death,
and will do anything to prevent her exe-
cution before the island is reached I
have consulted the aitu before the men,
and have told them that it is better to
let matters rest until we are at the island
and the high priest can judge you all
The men have agreed to that”

  “ How do we know it is not a trick ”
the captain asked

  “ You’ll have to take my word for it
If you’ll go to your cabins as prisoners,
you’ll be treated with every courtesy
until the island is reached There the
high priest will judge you”
THE DAUGHTER OF THE IDOL

133

  “ You expect us to give ourselves up
to death without a struggle”

  “ There is no way for you to escape,”
Welch replied “ From what possible
source could help come ”

  “ Perhaps even now it is very near,”
the captain said

  “ I’d advise you to go to your cabins
You’ll not be harmed while on board
ship We will leave everything to the
high priest”

  “We may retain our weapons” the
captain asked

  “ Of course I cannot allow that”

  “ Then we cannot think of returning
to the cabins,” the captain said firmly

  “ With weapons you may make an at-
tempt to regain the ship”

  “ And without them we would be at
your mercy absolutely- I think we’ll re-
main where we are”

  “Just as you please,” Welch said
“ You’ll not be molested until we reach
the island, anyway If you think jou’ll
be more comfortable up there—”

  “ We’ll feel safer at any rate,” laughed
the captain

  “ I’ll send food to you in an hour
or so”

  “ Thank you,” replied the captain, with
mock courtesy “ And the food, 1 pre-
sume, may be eaten without any ill after-
effects”

  “ You think I’d poison it ” Welch de-
manded

  “ My dear sir,” said the captain, “ I
think you’d do anything on earth to
gain your personal ends This interview
should be terminated here, I believe
Why prolong it ”

  “As you please,” Welch said again
“ But you’ll be hungry before the island
is reached”

  “ We had a very good breakfast”

  “ But we’ll not reach the island until
noon to-morrow”

  “ Then you are not sailing the ship
right,” the captain said “ You should
be off the island at break of day”

  “ If you are afraid 1 will poison the
food, perhaps you will be willing to go
yourself to the galley and pick it out,”
said Welch “ There is a young lady in
your party It is not kind to her to make
her suffer from lack of food”

  “ You expect me to walk into a trap ”
the captain asked

  “ Certainly not,” he answered “ I
give you my word of honor that you'll
not be molested”

  “Your word of honor” laughed the
captain

  “ I have tried to do the right thing at
this juncture,” Welch said “ You'll not
accept the food I offer to send, and you’ll
not go for it yourself”

  Captain Hawson turned and looked
up at us, then faced Welch again

  “ Will you clear the deck,” he asked,
“ and allow us to go to the galley as we
please to get this food Will you send
all of the men below and go yourself,
and let one of us guard the companion-
way while another reaches the galley
from the outside ”

  “ Yes” Welch answered

  “ Very well Then, do so”

  Welch turned back to speak to the men
aft, and the captain returned to us and
told his plans When the men had gone
below Welch called to us, and remained
standing near the mast

  “ Mr Engle, 1 think it better for you
to remain here and protect Miss Hol-
land,” the captain said “ I’ll take Ro-
land with me”

  “Do you not fear a trick” Uncle
Dick asked

  “ I think we can take care of our-
selves,” the captain answered “ At the
first sign of treachery I’ll send a bullet
through Welch, and this time it will be
the last wound he’ll ever receive”

  “ Very well” said Uncle Dick

  The captain started down, and I fol-
lowed him, each of us holding a revolver
Welch awaited us near the mast, and
when we approached him he turned and
led the way aft, to show us that his in-
tentions were good

  At the head of the companionway he
stopped for a moment

  “ Go below, and into one of the cab-
ins,” the captain directed “ At the first
sign of treachery there will be trouble”
Welch did not reply, but went below
I stood guard as the captain directed,
watching to see that none of the men
came up Captain Hawson went to the
man at the wheel, and searched him for
weapons Finding none, he went on to
the galley

  Once or twice I looked forward, but
there was no one on the deck There
134

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

was only the one way the men could
reach the deck forward, and with Uncle
Dick watching there it was not likely
that any of them would try it

  Just once I looked toward the stern
The man at the wheel had his eyes on the
open sea, and so I turned from him and
watched the companiomvay, wishing that
the captain would hurry, for I did not
feel at all comfortable

  Flow many minutes passed I do not
know But suddenly I heard the cap-
tain’s shout: “ Look out, boy ! ”

  1 whirled toward him The man at
the wheel had lashed it, and had crept
upon me As I turned he sprang, hands
outstretched, straight at my throat

  As Captain Hawson rushed toward me
across the dack, fearing to shoot because
his bullet might strike me, I threw my
revolver up before me and fired

  The man crashed to the deck at my
feet Captain Hawson reached my side at
the same instant From below, and from
forward, came a chorus of screams and
cries I heard Uncle Dick’s revolver
speak, saw the fanatics swarming onto
the deck forward and charging at the
barricade behind which my uncle and
Ruth Holland were entrenched

  And then I became aware that the cap-
tain was screaming something at me, and
that more of the men were charging to-
ward us up the companionway

  “ With me, Roland! It was a trick,
after all! ” the captain cried

  We each fired one shot into the midst
of the swarm of men rushing up toward
us, and then we started to flee aft If
we could reach the stern, and drop down
the side and into the galley through a
port-hole, we would be safe for a time,
and could at least make a defense

  Several bullets flew by us as we ran
But by dodging from place to place we
escaped harm We dropped over the
side safely, the captain leading the way
He reached up to help me, and we got
through the port-hole and into the after-
cabin A short run through the aft-
passage, and we would be in the galley
They would have a hard time dislodging
us there

  But we were not able to reach the
galley Some of the men were still in
the passage, and seeing who we were they
opened fire Welch had evidently told

them that the great aitu would be pleased
if the captain and myself were slain It
was only Uncle Dick, because he was
doomed to execution, and Ruth Hol-
land, because they wanted her to wed a
priest, that were exempt from present
death

  There was jio time, then, to reach the
galley, and we dare not remain in the
passage The captain dashed before me
and fired, and the nearest man dropped
without a sound The others held back

  “The first door!” Captain Hawson
cried

  He fired again to cover our advance,
and I crept through the passage at his
heels, looking back to watch the com-
panionway We reached the door in
safety, and turned from the passage into
the cabin The captain threw the door
shut

  “ Bolt the door! ” I screamed

  “ There is no lock on this door,” he
replied “ We are in their temple-room”

  He struck a match, and by its light, we
beheld the priest on guard before the
aitu creeping upon us Captain Hawson
covered him with the revolver, and he
held out his hands to show us that he
could do no harm

  “Up the steps!” the captain cried
to me

  Once more I found myself at the foot
of the idol, behind the draperies Cap-
tain Hawson remained at the bottom of
the steps, holding the priest before him
In the passage outside the cabin arose a
bedlam of voices Some one threw open
the door and showed a light

  “Back!” the captain cried “When
the first man enters I kill your priest! ”

CHAPTER XVIII
A Battle in the Temple-Room

“'Vr OUR uncle cannot hold out long,”
the captain said “ He has only
the one revolver and no extra ammuni-
tion”

  “ And we have only two shots left, sir,”
I said

  “ You are wrong there,” he said
“ When I went to the galley I did not
look for food, but for ammunition My
pockets are filled with cartridges”

  He handed some of them to me, and
THE DAUGHTER OF THE IDOL

135

 I filled the cylinder of my revolver, and
 put the remainder in my pockets

   A few minutes passed, and then we
 heard the spokesman in the passage out-
 side

   “Will you come out and surrender”
 he demanded

   “ No,” the captain cried

   “ Then we’ll come in and take you”

   “ If you open that door, I’ll kill your
 priest,” the captain cried “ I’ll kill him
 at the feet of the aitu ! ”

   Screams and curses answered the cap-
 tain’s speech, for the spokesman trans-
 lated it to the others There was silence
 for a time, and then the leader spoke
 again

   “ Miss Holland and Mr Engle are in
 our hands Unless you release the priest
 and come into the passage immediately,
 they shall die! ”

   “ I do not believe you,” the captain
 said

   “ You do not hear any more firing on
 deck, do you I say they have been con-
 quered and are in our power Will you
 -come out”

   “ No!”

   “ Then your friends shall lose their
 lives”

   “ Very well,” the captain replied

   “ You still doubt that they are in our
 hands I’ll convince you,” thespokes-
 man said

   He gave a command in his native
 tongue, and the captain whispered to me
 that he had told some of the men to
 bring my uncle and Ruth Plolland to the
 passage It was true,, then  they had
 been taken

   The captain seized the priest again, and
 put his revolver at the man’s head to
 prevent him crying out Then we bound
 him with ropes and gagged him, and car-
 ried him up the flight of steps and laid
 him across the aitu’s great wide lap He
 made a peculiar noise in his throat

   “ He is begging the aitu to save him,”
 the captain said

   “ What are we going to do” I asked

   I did not relish the idea of my uncle
 and pretty Ruth Holland being slain be-
 cause of the captain’s stubbornness

   “ Keep your eyes open, and follow
 me,” the captain said

   We went to the top of the flight of
 steps, crawled around the narrow ledge

of the pedestal upon which the aitu sat,
and dropped down behind in the dark-
ness Then I saw that there was a hol-
low space beneath the steps, and that
from the front of it we could peer out
and see the entire interior of the cabin
between the aitu and the door It was
a small space, but large enough to fire
through And the steps served as a for-
midable barricade

  “ Wait, and make no noise,” the cap-
tain said

  In a short time there were steps in the
passage, and the words of the spokesman
came to us again

  “ Will you come out” he cried

  We did not answer “ I have your
friends here, to convince you that I have
not been speaking untruly,” he went on
“ They shall speak to you”

  We heard him command my uncle to
speak, and there was no answer My
uncle was not the man to give himself
readily to the work of a decoy

  “You speak to them, woman,” we
heard the spokesman say

  Still no voice came to us Then one
of them must have seized her in an effort
to make her cry out, for we heard her
scream and it cut into our hearts like a
knife And at the same time we heard
my uncle’s cry of rage, the sound of
quick fighting, of blows The door was
burst open, and the mass of fighting,
twisting men streamed into the temple-
room

  “Don’t fire! You may kill your un-
cle ! ” the captain whispered

  Some one brought a light and held it
high, showing the scene of combat Ruth
had run to the bottom of the steps, and
was standing there, watching the fray,
sobbing In the center of the room my
uncle fought like a madman with the fa-
natics, having some advantage because of
the smallness of the room

  But he was conquered in time, and
held against the wall “ Seize the wom-
an,” the spokesman commanded “ Now,
get the others”

  Two of them seized Ruth and placed
her against the wall beside Uncle Dick

  “Where are the others, master” one
of the men asked in his tongue, and the
captain translated it to me

  “ They are here find them,” was the
answer
136

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  We heard some of them start up the
steps, heard their cries as they discovered
the priest, bound and gagged The
spokesman ran up to them, and fell back
with them, too, for none of them dared
touch the aitu He sent one of the men
for Welch

  Welch was not long in coming

  “What is it he asked

  The spokesman explained quickly
“None may touch the aitu save you,
master,” he said “ We are not priests”
Welch made his way up the steps and
helped the priest down, and unbound him
and took the gag from his mouth We
heard the priest jabbering

  “He says the man and the boy went
beneath the aitu,” Welch told the spokes-
man

  “ Then we have them in a trap”

  “ Get them out,” Welch ordered
“ When you have them, see that all four
are placed in separate cabin's under a
strong guard VVe must have no more
nonsenseuntil we reach the island”
Welch went across the cabin and
stopped in front of Ruth Holland and
Uncle Dick

   “ I promise you,” he said to my uncle,
“ that you’ll have a short time to live
when we get to the island”

   “ Perhaps,” my uncle said

   “ And I promise you,” he said to Ruth,
“ that I’ll not forget your part in this
affair, and that you’ll be made to suffer
for it”

  Uncle Dick struggled to reach him,
but the men held him back Then the
captain and I had our own business to
attend to, for the men were trying to
reach us from behind We opened fire
upon them One dropped down, badly
wounded and the captain secured his
revolver and filled it with cartridges, and
held it ready

  “ We cannot get to them, master,”
they reported “ They can kill us, one
by one”

   Welch turned toward the aitu

   “ Captain Hawson,” he cried, “ unless
you and the boy come out and give your-
selves up, I’ll take matters in my own
hands here and forget that these friends
of yours are entitled to courtesy”

  The captain made no answer Welch
bade the men carry Ruth to the other

(To be c

end of the cabin, and then he had Uncle
Dick placed with his back against the
door

   “ I’ll give you one minute,” he cried

  “ You dare not kill a man in the pres-
ence of the aitu,” the captain replied

  “ I can kill him in the passage,” Welch
answered

  He motioned the men to take Uncle
Dick outside Ruth gave a scream and
tried to get to him, but they would not
permit her

  “Will you come out” Welch cried
again

  “ Yes,” the captain answered

  Again he made me follow close behind
him and be on my guard We backed
out from beneath the steps, and with
difficulty reached the ledge of the pedes-
tal Then we crept around the aitu

  “ They were touching the aitu,” the
spokesman cried

  And as he spoke the captain opened fire
with both revolvers, shouting into the
midst of them, sending a hail of bullets
down the steps

  “ Shoot, Roland ! ” he screamed to me

  I joined in the fray The men burst
out the door, fleeing Welch and the
spokesman were gone We dashed down
the steps, where Ruth Holland was lean-
ing against the wall, almost at the point
of swooning

  The captain did not stop there but
ran to the door, filling his revolvers as
he did so His continual firing unnerved
the men, for they did not know we had
extra ammunition

  They were fleeing up the passage to-
ward the companionway We ran after
them, keeping up the firing They fired
some shots in reply, but none of them
took effect

  When the last one had gone on deck
we ran back again and got Ruth, and the
captain led us forward the way we had
gone that other time, and so to the deck
There were men forward, but when we
emerged and began firing at them they
ran aft quickly

  It was only the work of a minute to
get to our old position of security near
the bowsprit But there were only three
of us safe and secure

fanatics,

  a few miles of road in England and is
  not thoroughly established as yet The
  difficulties encountered have been chiefly
  with the weather conditions, necessitating
  the use of steam heat to melt the ice and
  snow at the points of contact between
  the engine and the signal arrangements
  on the track

    With Lacroix’s system a third rail is
  used, and there is only such inconvenience
  as is caused by ice on a third rail any-
  where and that is not too great to obviate,
  as shown by the success of third-rail sys-
  tems in the open country

cities so that a traveler

from a speeding coach
as if in his own office is
one of the striking features of a three
in one invention which Fred Lacroix,
a young railroad man of twenty-four,
has just placed in successful operation
on twelve miles of the Erie Railroad
in New Jersey The two other parts to
the combination are a cab signaling sys-
tem and an automatic stop, and the whole
proved its efficiency before half the signal
engineers and many financiers of New
York

  The inventor is staking his success
on the practical working of the safety
appliances, but the appeal to the gen-
eral imagination is in the telephone For
though the public at large does not know
when it travels whether the road is au-
tomatically controlled or operated by
hand signals, it can see a telephone and
feel a thrill of wonder when it is pos-
sible to sit in a car and talk with some
one a thousand miles away while the
train is whirling over the country

  As to safety, Lacroix’s system has
138

new in signaling, and has immediately
commended itself as a time saver It
provides a quick and direct means of
communication between engineer and op-
erator and permits the issuing of orders
to trains on the move at a distance from a
station

Stopped from Outside

  A light third rail does the work It
conveys the signals, applies the brakes
when necessary, and acts as a telephone
wire The mechanism is on the engine,
where it is brought into the roundhouse
for inspection, and all that can get out
of order along ' the track is the track
circuit, containing a battery and a track
relay If anything should happen to
these the train will be brought to a full
stop

  The engineer receives his information
as to the condition of the track ahead
from a green light, which shows in his
cab as long as the right of way is clear
Directly under it is an electromagnet,
which derives its magnetic powers from a
shunt-wound dynamo driven by steam
pressure from the engine When it has
its full energy it is sufficiently power-
ful to hold up a heavy iron arm, which,
when in contact with the magnet, does
not affect the air-brake valve

  If anything happens to the current
so that the magnet loses its power, the
heavy iron arm falls, opening the valve
and setting every brake in the train
And, as the air escapes, it passes through
a whistle, which it blows in warning As
the current also supplies the light, it goes
out simultaneously with the dropping of
the arm

  In the same circuit with the light and
the magnet is a shoe of steel brushes,
made to scrape the third rail and com-
municate an electric current to its sur-
face As long as the third rail is in a
closed track circuit not broken by the
presence of another train, the current
which is local to the engine flows out
through the third rail, making a com-
plete circuit of the track wires and re-
turning through the wheels and body
of the engine

  If there is another train on the track
and the circuit is not closed, the engine
circuit is abruptly broken by the same

opening in the track circuit which inter-
rupted the track current, the magnet
loses its power, the arm drops, the brakes
are set, and the train stops

  The whole mechanism of the signal
system in the engine is so constructed
as to respond promptly to the indica-
tions it receives from the third rail To
make it effective it is merely necessary
to have the track circuit closed if the
track is clear and open if it is occupied

  In doing this, the principles of the
ordinary automatic block system are ap-
plied The wiring is different, in order
to bring the third rail into the track cir-
cuit, but there is no essential change For
this, as for all automatic sems, the
track is divided into blocks or sections,
each of which is entirely separated from
the rest for signaling purposes

Failure Made Safe

  A current of electricity generated at
one end passes down a rail to the other,
where it goes through a relay contain-
ing an electromagnet, which must remain
energized in order to keep the circuit
closed In other automatic systems, the
current then passes to the other rail and
returns to the battery, but in the La-
croix system a slightly more complicated
arrangement is necessary in order to per-
mit it to pass through the short sec-
tions of third rail at both ends of the
track and include, them within the block
In both, the track circuit depends upon
the magnet in the relay remaining ener-
gized, but this it will only do while the
full current is passing through it

  As soon as an engine runs into the
block, the wheels and axles form a short
path for the electricity, and only a small
amount of it passes through the relay,
not enough to hold the armature and
keep the circuit closed

Points of Difference

  On the ordinary automatic system, the
opening of the'circuit, whether from the
presence of a train, a broken rail, or a
landslide, sends the signal on the sema-
phore to danger The working of the
Lacroix system is quite different

  When a block is occujtied or in trouble
the approaching train first learns of it
SIGNALING WITHOUT SEMAPHORES

139

when the shoe strikes the third rail at
the end of the block Previous to that
time, while the-train was passing over a
clear track, whenever the shoe struck a
section of the third rail the engine cur-
rent passed out through it to the track
circuit, then through the track relay,
which was closed, back to the track and
home through the wheels and body of the
engine

  But as soon as it strikes a block where
the track current has been short-circuited
by the presence of a train or by other
trouble, the current cannot make a com-
plete run through the track circuit on
account of the opening in the relay
caused by the lack of power in the
magnet

Improvements to Come

  The action is instantaneous The cur-
rent does not- leap from the shoe to
the third rail, because it cannot return
The effect is to break the circuit in the
engine, which results in extinguishing
the green light, setting the brakes, and
blowing the whistle

  Each block is connected with the
third-rail sections at both ends of the
block, so that trains can never approach
each other nearer than the length of
the block plus the lengths of the two
third-rail sections

  On single tracks, such as the Erie
branch on which it has been installed,
the blocks overlap both ways, so that
trains will not collide head on at the
end of a block At public demonstra-
tions it has been shown that head-on col-
lisions could not happen

  Two engines-racing toward each other,
with the throttles wide open and the en-
gineers leaning from the cab windows,
were stopped at the ends of a block
which they both approached from oppo-
site sides As soon as each struck the
third-rail section, the air-brakes were
set and both engines were brought to a
standstill within a few hundred feet, al-
though the engines were still puffing
away with the throttles wide open

  The entire possibilities of the inven-
tion are not shown as yet because the
third rails are not continuous The sec-
tions are only long enough to give the
air-brakes a chance to stop the train

before the brushes have passed off, which
is five hundred feet 011 the Erie While
the train is passing from one third-rail
section to another, it is entirely cut off
from communication

  There is however, nothing to hinder
the third rails from being continuous
with only short breaks between blocks,
and it will be a necessity if the telepho-
ning possibilities are used

  There is at present no provision giving
the engineer warning of the danger
ahead until suddenly the air-brakes are
opened and the train is brought to a
stop by an emergency measure This
can be remedied, however, by more ex-
tensive wiring and the use of distant
signals, not unlike those in the automatic
semaphore system

  Through them the engineer is in-
formed several blocks in advance of the
condition of the blocks he is approach-
ing At present the same electric cur-
rent which operates the signals also ap-
plies the brakes, and, before he can grasp
the throttle, the train is being stopped
automatically, the amount of jarring the
train -receives depending 011 the brakes

A Switch for Telephone

  There is as yet only one current gen-
erated in the engine and this must be
used for both the signaling apparatus
and the telephone Obviously it can-
not be used for both at once This is
recognized by the inventor, and he has
prepared a switch to be thrown whenever
the telephone is in use> But this en-
tails the consequence that while the tele-
phone is in operation the signaling sys-
tem is dead To be running blindly ahead
wit'll 110 signals to guide, would be
suicide, as even the automatic stop is
out of commission

  A single current is feasible, however,
if the telephone is to be used for sig-
naling purposes only, as the telephone
is only called into requisition when an
'engineer receives information as to the
track, but, when it becomes a conve-
nience for travelers, the telephone will
need a current all to itself This can
be taken care of by providing an al-
ternate current which can be used over
the same rails and wires without in-
terfering

BY CHARLES BATTELL LOOMIS

Something Might Have Happened If They Hadn’t
Put on the Binders While He Was Cutting the Fat

H,	yes, Uncle Jabez is the
  most romantic of men
  Why surely I’ve told you
  of the time that he put a
  new piano in Stella Wyn-
  grave’s hen-house as a
  wedding-present to her ”

  I assured Mrs Dorkins that that par-
ticular manifestation of her Uncle
Jabez’s ultra romanticism had never be-
fore been told me

  “ Why, yes You see, Stella and her
husband had gone into the poultry busi-
ness just after they married, and she
had given up her
music Uncle Ja-
bez hadn’t given her
any wedding - pres-
ent and she felt a
little hurt, but one
night when she went
out to the hen-house
to lock up, she found
in the big scratching
pen a brand - new
piano with the legs
lying beside it and
a card, ‘ From Un-
cle Tabe’ ”

  “ I should think
that it might have
scratched the piano
somewhat”

  “It did, and it
gave them no end of
trouble to get it into
the house, but that
was Uncle Jabez’s
romantic way, and
so I say I never
know what he’s go-
ing to do next, and

now that we’ve heard he’s- at last struck
it rich out in the Klondike, there’s no tell-
ing how he’ll come back or when he’ll
turn up

  “ We’ve always been friendly with him,
and we sort of hope that if he does come
back East, he’ll take a fancy to Marietta
Ethella and give her a musical edu-
cation”

  I was occupying a room and board-
ing with the Dorkinses while pursuing
my medical studies They did not keep
a boarding-house, but took me in because
my father and Mr Dorkins had been boys
together and Mrs
Dorkins thought it
“ so romantic ” for
me, the second gen-
eration, to be in the
way of having kind-
nesses s h o w n me
just because my
father and Lester
Dorkins had learned
swimming in the
same swimming
hole

  Mrs Iolanthe
Dorkins had a nose
for the romantic
that I have never
seen excelled Her
own marriage to Mr
Dorkins was in the
highest degree ro-
mantic, because she
had gone to buy a
pair of shoes in the
store where Mr
Dorkins was a clerk
and he had had the
hardihood to tell her

141

she pinched her feet She had admired his
manliness in telling her what she con-
fessed was the truth, and she had ordered
the next size larger and had fallen in love
with him at the same time

  Mr Dorkins had a vein of the roman-
tic in him which took the form of ad-
miring his wife’s appreciation of things
removed from life's humdrum, and Mari-
etta Ethella lived in a dream of ro-
mance where every passer-by was a
potential prince and the grocer’s boy was
a kidnaped crown prince of the house
of Ruritania

  Knowing them as I did, and being of
an age to enjoy a bit of practical joking,
I set to work to devise some scheme by
which I could provide a little innocent
pleasure for myself and a bit of mys-
tification for them

  It was not long before 1 had decided
on a plan rich in promise I would get
some tramp to play the returned uncle,
he should make a fat thing out of it in
the way of rich food and cigars, and
when all was over I would confess my
complicity in the affair, pay all damages,
and take the whole family to some “ Ru-
pert of Hentzau ” sort of a play

   It so fell out that the following Sat-
urday lent itself to my plan quite as if
the day had been prepared for me Mr
Dorkins being detained at home by a
slight cold, I having the whole day free,
and Mrs Dorkins beginning to wonder
when Uncle Jabez would return to his
home in the East

  I had kept him to the front as a
topic of conversation and had brought
out recitals of his many “ romantic ”
actions, and the time was ripe for the
entry of Jabez Patchen, Romanticist

  The suburban villa of the Dorkinses
covered a half acre, and was mostly lawn
and old-fashioned “ romantic ” flowers,
with one peach-tree which Mrs Dorkins
treasured as the apple of her eye because
the pit from which it sprang had been
given to her by a favorite nephew, who
died next day of indigestion brought on
by eating the peach, which was not fully
ripe

   This tree had never borne fruit before,
but now was loaded with Morris Whites,
which promised to be delicious when they
should have become ripe

   The house itself was one of the Swiss

chalet order for obvious reasons, and
while the furniture was not costly nor
the decorations rich, the amount of bric-
a-brac with romantic associations fes-
tooned around it was remarkable Knick-
knacks from mary lands fairly littered
center-table, piano, mantel, and writing-
desk in the old-fashioned parlor

  It was to this home that I purposed
leading some fun-loving tramp who was
at the same time honest, and that is why
I set out right after breakfast to search
for him

  Mrs Dorkins was preparing to do up
plums, Mr Dorkins was nursing his cold
in a red wrapper covered with white roses
(a gift from his wife), and Marietta
Ethella was in a hammock on the ve-
randa, reading, “ How Prince Florizel
Came to His Own”

  A walk of half a dozen blocks brought
me on a tramp, but he was so villainous
looking, so destitute of any hint of re-
finement that I passed him by But two
blocks farther on I caught sight of a
trampish fellow looking at a map in the
window of a little real-estate office
perched on a knoll that commanded a view
of “ highly improved ” property

  The fellow wore a frock coat whose
better days must have been coeval with
the closing years of the Civil War, and
his hat looked older yet He had a red
handkerchief in place of a collar and his
shoes had not at any time been mates

  His trousers had surely first been worn
at an afternoon tea, for they were of a
light material and of what had once
been a fashionable cut, but they were
too tight for the sturdy legs that were
now within them

  Here was the tramp I wanted—if
he had a sense of humor I hailed him
“ Good morning! Quite a boom in real
estate, isn’t there  ”

  “ Yes,” said he, turning and looking
at me with an insolent but whimsical
eye “ I was thinkin’ of buyin’ a lot or
two an’ makin’ it over into a restricted
park”

  Mrs Dorkins would have believed his
statement, but I was delighted at his
chaffing power A tip or two, and he
would play the part to perfection

  He looked to be about forty-five his
beard, grizzled and wiry, had been al-
lowed to seek the outer air for five days
142

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

at least, and his hair had not known
the caressing touch of a comb in many
a day His hands were fairly clean and
he did not look like a drinking man
“ Made to order”

  “ I’m sorry I can’t sell you a block,”
said I, “ but I got rid of my last holding
a few days ago But, say, I’d like to have
a little talk with you if you have time”
He rubbed his musical beard, knotted
his eyebrows, and said, “ 1 have an ap-
pointment with a capitalist, but it will
keep”

  Then, without telling him who he was
supposed to be impersonating, I told him
what I wanted him to do to make him-
self perfectly at home if Mrs Dor-
kins should invite him in, and to throw
himself on her hospitality fervidly

  He hesitated Perhaps he was think-
ing of parlor carpets and his rough shoes

 He gave me a keen, half-suspicious look
 Then I explained that I was a medical
 student, bent on having some fun with
 friends of mine showed him a

COMPJiwv

I WAS thinkin' of buyin’ a lot or two

five-dollar bill that should be his if he
played his part well, cautioned him
against any malicious mischief, and,
pausing for his reply, got a poke in the
shoulder that nearly toppled me over,
as with a gusty laugh he said, “ You
have picked a winner, Doc—what  ”

   “ Good, just be easy and natural, you
know They’re a little bit dotty on
tramps Plelp yourself to cigars—I’ll
make it good to them afterward, you
understand—”

   “ I don’t giye a whoop in Ohio wheth-
er you do or not, but I’m the man for
the round trip and I want to say right
now that it appeals to me”

  Here he fetched me a good-humored
slap in the ribs that brought me to
the verge of the gutter, and I had to
ask him to restrain his exuberance

  But I liked my tramp There was
no Harvard reserve about him He
was human

   I explained to him that my friends
were long on romanticism and short
im humor, and that 1 felt a little
good-natured practical joke at their
expense was perfectly legitimate

   “ Yes, and mild for a medical stu-
dent,” he said

  “ Well, I’ll hurry back to the
house and you come on in about half
an hour”

   I was turning away when he said,
“ Say, w’ere is this joint ”

  “To be sure” I gave him clear
directions and went on my way, re-
turning by another street so that
Dork ins would not connect me with
the advent of the tramp

   I had been at the house a little
over half an hour before my tramp
appeared, and he seemed about to
pass the house, looking beyond as if
he had misunderstood my instruc-
tions

  I coughed significantly, and he
looked up, shrugged his shoulders
and shambled around to the side
gate Mrs Doxkins has what she
calls romantic palings enclosing the
place—“ as they used to be in the
old story books”

  In a few moments, I heard a whisper-
ed call in the hall, “ Father, Marietta
Ethella, Mr Tompkins!” and I knew
that the curtain had risen

  Marietta Efhella tumbled out of the
Hammock, dropping the book I rose
from the rustic chair, and Mr Dorkins
came down from his room in his fancy
wrapper

  “Oh!” said Mrs Dorkins, breathing
heavily, “ there’s a tramp in the kitchen,
and while I’m not sure I can almost
was reminded of your uncle He looked
test us What shall I do”

  “ Did he just come down the side
street  ” I asked

  “ Yes—

  “ Why, the minute I saw that man I
was reminded of your Uncle He looked
sort of amateur theatrical I’ll bet a
hat he is

  “ Just dress him up in your Sunday
clothes, Mrs Dorkins, kill a fatted calf
or two, and give him the time of his
life Open a can of sardines and a keg
of beer and an oyster or two You won’t
regret it

  She bit beautifully, and if she had any
doubts of her uncle’s identity they were
now removed We all went into the
kitchen and on the way in I was sud-
denly inspired

  The tramp, a born actor, was stand-
ing in a very humble attitude drinking
a glass of milk which Mrs Dorkins had
poured out for him

  His back was to us, but his pose was
one to win sympathy, for he reminded
one of a peasant of the Millet variety—
down-trodden and cloddish

  The world had been hard on the poor
fellow, and I gave the Dorkins’s credit
for a feeling of real sympathy for tramps
in general—their very wanderings must
appeal to the good lady as somewhat “ ro-
mantic”

  My inspiration was to make it easier
for the Dorkinses to do a rather unusual
thing by suggesting it to them on the
plea of the obligations of universal
brotherhood

  “ Hallo, my poor fellow,” said I,
“ aren’t you the man I was talking to
down the street a while ago”

you're a beast, that's

  WHAT YOU ARE !

  Lie turned, his face lighted up and he
said in broken tones, “ Thank you kind-
ly, sir, yes, I am You said the first kin’
words I’d heard in a week If all the
world was like you—”

  I held up my hand to stop his flow
of praise and said, “ Mrs Dorkins, here
is a man and a brother He is as good
as we are, but he’s never had a chance
Why not let him have one”

  Mrs Dorkins gave me a grateful look
I was making her action natural “ Why
not indeed ” said she, and I’ll do her the
justice to say that I think she was sin-
cere and perhaps forgot for a moment
that she supposed that this preposterous
looking fellow with the insolent eyes was
really her uncle

  As for me, one can imagine my joy
I foresaw to what lengths this senti-
mental couple would go to make it easy
for this modern Kit Sly

  “ Won’t you have something moreto
eat” asked Mrs Dorkins

  With what 1 considered a touch of
genius, the fellow said, “No, thanks
I had something to eat bright an’ early
an’ on’y for walkin’ so far I wouldn’
need this I’m not a great eater”

  He felt that such sincerity on his part
would appeal to this kindly lady she
felt that “ uncle ” was acting his’ part
well, and I felt that he was in his way
an artist

  While Mr Dorkins went up-stairs to
see if he could find a suit of clothes that
would do for the poor fellow and Mrs
Dorkins returned for the time being to
her plums, Marietta Ethella showed the
tramp into the parlor and suffered him
to pat her head in a fatherly fashion
that made my gorge rise

  I was glad to see her leave him and go
out to her book I was also astonished
to see him slyly slip a little silver orna-
ment into his tail pocket I saw this
through the crack of the door and has-
tened into the parlor

  1-Ie stepped over to a box of cigars
and transferred at least thirty to his
breast pocket, winking at me and saying,
“Quite a graft, my boy I owe you
something for this These folks are soft
enough for cushions Here’s where I
lay down on ’em for all I’m worth”

  I did not mind the cigars, but the
silver trinket was one that Mrs Dorkins

had obtained in one of her romantic
ways and I knew it was endeared to her
by associations, so I said:

  “ Cigars are all right, but I didn’t
mean you to help yourself to bric-a-brac”
This with a significant glance at his tail
pocket

  He laughed impudently “ Graft is
graft, young feller, and when I play a
game I go the whole hog”

  As he spoke he went to the mantel
and helped himself to two silver candle-
sticks which his capacious pockets con-
cealed in short order

  Quite forgetting that I had fostered
Mrs Dorkins’s idea that this man was
her uncle, I went out to the kitchen and
said, “ Mrs Dorkins, you’d better call
your husband and show this man to the
door He’s a thief He’s helping him-
self to bric-a-brac”

  She laughed a silvery laugh “ Why
not” said she “The dear soul! You
leave him alone When it comes time
for him to disclose his identity he will
take all those things out of his pockets
and we’ll have a good laugh over it”

  “ But,” said I “ he isn’t your uncle”
She looked at me coldly “ I don’t
know what you mean”

  I didn’t know what I meant myself
I didn’t know what I could have meant
to bring a disgusting old rounder into
a respectable house and give him a
chance to loot the place

  Of course I’d have to make good, and
I’d rather make good than confess to
these kindly people that I had put up
a senseless job on them It didn’t look
funny to me any longer

  I went back into the parlor The
tramp was not there A little silver
traveling clock was also missing

  I hurried out onto the veranda and
saw, to my horror, the tramp fondling
the hair of the innocent child who, sup-
posing it was her great-urcle, let him
do it, although 1 could see she shrank
from the greasy coat

  “ Come here! ” said I, in peremptory
tones, and with mock contrition he lum-
bered up to me

  “ Aren’t you ashamed of yourself ”
“ Shame died in me in me third year,
young feller I regretted the loss, but I
didn’ go into mournin’”

  His pockets were positively bulging,
A PINK-TEA BO

145

and every bulge meant several dollars
out of my pocket unless 1 could get him
to disgorge

  “ Nice location, this, he said, look-
ing out over the rolling country to a
branch of the Hackensack in the dis-
tance “ And early peaches, too Say,
cull, what’s the matter with us havin’
some fruit Fruit in the mornin’—what’s
the sayin’

  “ Then don’t butt in, Lorenzo The
lady of the house ” — he broke into a
laugh— the lady of the house is doin’
up plums How can I show her me
gratitude W’y, I can pick her peaches
for her to do up Unripe for eatin’—-
just right for cannin’”

  He started down the steps that led
to the garden Marietta said, “ Unc-er-
Mr Man, please don’t pick those

WE ALL WENT INTO THE KITCHEN

  “ You leave that fruit alone,” I
growled “ It isn't ripe and Mrs Dor-
kins sets great store by it”

  u When a feller tramps as I do, said
he blandly, “ his digestion laughs at a
little thing like unripe fruit I like
peaches and I’m go’n’ to help myself
Have some, Flossy”

  “ No, thank, you, sir,” she said,-trying
to control a tendency to giggle

  “Will you keep out” 1 asked earn-
estly

  “ Do you own this fruitery” said he,
mimicking my tones

  “ No”

peaches My mama is keeping them for
papa’s birthday week after next”

  “ Flossy,”- said the horrible man,
“ what if some one broke in here in the
night and stole those peaches—then where
would your pa’s birthday treat be I
will pick them now and they can be made
into brandied peaches for his birthday!”
Lightly lie ran down the steps and
over to the tree with its bushels of fruit
As for me, I went into the house and
called Mr Dorkins, but he was up in
the attic and did not answer I went to
the kitchen Mrs Dorkins was not there,
but I heard her in the cellar
146

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  Down to the cellar I went, and said to
her, “ Mrs Dorkins, that man is out pick-
ing your peaches”

  She shook her head calmly “ Uncle
Tabez wouldn’t do that even in joke”

  “ But how do you know this is uncle ”
“ Because he acts like him—because
his disguise is so splendid It’s just the
way he would act, and he’d be sure to
make up so that I couldn’t see any re-
semblance to him”

  I left her hurriedly and ran out of
doors, determined to appeal to the tramp’s
finer feelings

  But he had none When I reached
him he had actually half stripped the
tree, putting the peaches into a basket
he had found there by cursed luck

  “ Look here, you’re a beast, that’s what
you are ! You’re a vandal! What kind
of return is this for these people”

  He looked -at me insolently “ The'
glass of milk, and the cigars—not for-
gettin’ the bric-a-brac”

  As he spoke he went on picking the
Morris Whites — peaches that were the
apples of Mrs Dorkins’s eyes Suddenly
I heard a hoarse laugh at Mr Dorkins’s
bedroom window We looked up He
was watching us and yet, thanks to his
fatuous belief in the identity of this
tramp with his wife’s uncle, he was mere-
ly amused at this act of rapine

  I yelled up to him, filled with shame
and contrition and ready to eat dust in
my humiliation “ Mr Dorkins, I must
apologize to you for this Hold me per-
sonally responsible I put up a joke on
you This man is a tramp”

  “ Yes, he looks the part, but,” wheezed
Mr Dorkins, his sore throat preventing
fuller tones, “ I think that he will ad-
mit that he is my good wife’s uncle and
he knows that when he comes back we’re
only too glad to let him do what he wants
with our things I can’t find that suit,
Uncle Jabez, but now that the cat’s out
of the bag it doesn’t matter”

  “Great Scott!” said I, running un-
der the bedroom window, “ I tell you
that this fellow is my tramp! I hired

him to come here and take all that was
coming to him, and he’s turned out a
thief He’ll go to jail for this! ”

  The noise of my voice had brought
Mrs Dorkins out and Marietta Ethella
had again dropped her book and was-
leaning over the veranda-rail, all eyes

  The tramp sunk his teeth into a Morris
White and then ejected the unripe fiber
on the ground lie also gave the basket
a kick Beast!

  But nothing would shake the faith of
these people in the man they had be-
friended and I saw that I would have
to pretend to give up and go away, after
which I would telephone for an officer

  I felt sure the fellow had audacity
enough to stay there over at least one
meal Perhaps he would again fawn over
that innocent if sentimental child

  Suddenly the fellow straightened him-
self, threw his hat on the path, ran his
hands through his tangled hair a few
times, reducing it to order in a remark-
able manner Then in tones that be-
spoke gentility he said:

  “ Young man, you would have had
more fun if you had picked out a real
tramp, but he couldn’t have had half as
much fun with you as I’ve had”

  He took out of his pocket a clock, a
paper-cutter, and a candlestick

  “ These go back where they belong,”
said lie, “ also the rest of the things I
picked up The peaches, unfortunately,
I can’t restore, but I’ll set out a young
orchard this fall if Iolanthe will let me

  “ 1 told you, young manyou’d picked
a winner, and you have I won enough
the last year in the Klondike to make all
of us happy—and if you’ll forgive me
I’ll let you come in”

  I looked at the Dorkinses Mrs Dor-
kins was hugging herself at the roman-
ticism of the morning Mr Dorkins was
looking ruefully at the peaches

  From a waistcoat pocket the tramp
took a card-case, out of which he ex-
tracted a card which he handed to me
It read, “Jabez Patchen”

  The joke was on me

Even a yard engine needs steam Don’t forget the grub-bucket—

 OLD-TIMER TALES

 With the First Vanderbilt

BY C P GRENEKER

THE old-timers are the most appealing, the most romantic, the most
interesting section of the railroad community Men who have helped
to make history which we are living upon will always have a charm
for the popular mind that cannot be described, and is held by no other set of
men Here we are presenting the first of a series of Old-Timer Tales which
we feel pretty sure will be one of the hits of our career Turn to the Editorial
Carpet and see what else we have to say about this feature

     There is still alive and active a man who was in the employ of the late
Commodore Vanderbilt's first railroad He was a railroad man even before
the famous commodore came on the scene, and for four years he was one of
the magnate’s right-hand men

     The stories that he tells of the old days are not tragic, nor are they of
great historical value There is not much mystery or romance concealed in
them, but they do show one thing that is sometimes too much neglected in
the little stories of the great—the human side of the founders and guardians
of great industries and colossal fortunes, their faults and virtues that make
them kin to the rest of us

     It is for the sake of the light that they shed on the purely human quali-
ties of the first Vanderbilt that these stories are related

The Old Freight-Agent on the Harlem Tells Stories of the Early Days
When Commodore Vanderbilt Was Rising to Power
in the Railroad World

ing was comparatively new to him he
had just got hold of the Harlem road
but he had a faculty of asking questions,
and it was with this object in view that
he sent for me to discuss freight-rates

  “ I was ushered into his bedroom The
old commodore pulled himself up and
began firing queries at me

  “ ' What does it cost to ship a ton of
coal from here to White Plains’ he
asked, pointing his index finger first to
the right and then to the left He had
a habit of doing that when he talked

was ten o’clock of a Sunday
morning in June, 1S63 The
place was the bedroom of Com
modore Vanderbilt, the new
president of the Harlem Rail-
road The speakers were Com-
modore Vanderbilt, still in bed, and I
D Barton, his first freight-agent, for-
merly a Harlem Railroad conductor The
story is told in Barton’s words

  “ Tlie commodore had a habit of lying
in bed late Sundays, although he was an
early riser week-day mornings Railroad-
148'

THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE

  “ I told him

  “‘Umph! Huh,’ he sort of groaned,
and, after a pause: ‘ And how much for
a horse and buggy’

  “ Again 1 gave him the amount

  “There was another pause Finally:
‘ And how much fer a barrel of flour to
White Plains  ’ I told him the rate
Without hesitation the old commodore,
now in a sitting posture, said gruffly:

  “ ‘ Put your rates down on flour and
oal poor people use those things but
anybody that can afford to have a horse
and buggy can afford to pay high freight-
rates Put your rate up on horses and
buggies’

  “ That ended the ‘ freight meeting,’ ”
commented Barton, “ and the next day I
had a new tariff When I read of this
teapot tempest which is being raised over
rate legislation, I often wish that the old
commodore, with his common sense, were
here to spread oil on the troubled waters
Horse sense is what he had, and a heart
as big as this sofa”

Vanderbilt’s First Pensioner

  We were seated on a plush-covered
divan of tremendous proportions, in one
corner of which half reposed the figure
of the commodore’s first freight-agent, a
man now seventy-six years of age, who
has seen service on several roads as gen-
eral superintendent His last position,
which was given up on account of ad-
vanced years, was in charge of operation
of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit

  “ Yes, he had the kindest disposition of
any man I ever knew,” continued the
veteran “ One day we were standing
near the ticket window at the Twenty-
Sixth Street station—that was' at Fourth
Avenue—when a woman with four or five
children came up and asked for tickets to
Chatham She lacked one dollar of hav-
ing enough money

  “ The commodore never missed any-
thing He overheard the woman’s con-
versation with the ticket - agent, and,
calling me aside, told me to pay the dif-
ference and charge it to ‘ profit and loss’
Before carrying out his wish, I ventured
to ask the woman why she wanted so
many tickets, and the cause of her finan-
cial embarrassment

  “ She replied that her husband could

not get work in New York, or, at least,
I should say she began to tell me that
when the commodore, who I thought was
some distance away, broke in with:

  “‘What Can’t get work in New
York Your husband must be a fine
specimen,’ he thundered He had fol-
lowed me up to hear what I said

  “ ‘ No, yure rivirince,’ explained the
woman  1 it was this way’ And with
that she led up from around the comer
of the station a one-legged man, who was
her husband ‘ He wure run over by er
train on this very road’ The man
nodded, as though to confirm his wife’s
story

  “‘When’ demanded the commodore
with some passion He had just taken
possession of the road

  “ ‘ Some years ago,’ answered the wom-
an ‘ And he niver got a cint’

  “ ‘ Theji he’ll be my first pensioner,’
said the commodore ‘ and,’ he added
thoughtfully,  I trust my last’

  “ Yes, indeed,” commented Barton,
heaving a great sigh, “ those were great
days Dick Croker, Tammany’s old boss,
was a machinist in the Harlem shops at
Thirty-Second Street his brother George
drove a horse-car on the Fourth Avenue
line, and another brother, Ed, was an
engineer on the Harlem

  “ In those days, just after the commo-
dore got hold of the road, his son, W H
Vanderbilt, was' farming over on Staten
Island—a regular country farmer—and
he used to sell hay to the Harlem road
for the horses that pulled our trains
from Tryon Row

Dropping Mule-Power

  “ I can’t just recollect the year, but
the commodore got tired of mule-power
through the tunnel, and ordered me to
run the trains from Twenty-Sixth Street
up with engines Yes, I was general
freight-agent at the time, and I was also
assistant superintendent, but for both jobs
I got only'seventy-five dollars a month

   “ I did as I was told, and soon the city
authorities were after us, as all of the
property-owners objected to the smoke
and noise from the engines This tunnel
was the one under Fourth Avenue, and
both sides of the avenue were lined with
fine dwellings
WITH THE FIRST VANDERBILT

149

  “ The commodore defied the authori-
ties until at last a squad of policemen was
sent to capture any engine that went
through the tunnel pulling a train The
commodore saw to it that I was on that
engine There were about ten police-
men, and they started for us at Twenty-
Sixth Street  Four or five were daring
enough to climb on the tender, and I
tell you we gave them the ride of their
lives, and a free bath from the tender
tank into the bargain When we reached
Forty-Second Street, there wasn’t one of
them left to tell the tale

—i‘- At the end of the tunnel the com-
modore was waiting for us I jumped
off, and the train went on Presently the
police squad came charging through the
tunnel with an Irish sergeant in com-
mand He was one of the four whom we
had first drenched and then discarded
He was a sorry spectacle

  “ There the commodore was, in white
stove-pipe hat and long black frock coat
A most commanding figure he was At
the sight of him the policemen halted
Before the sergeant had time to say any-
thing, the commodore turned upon them
with:

  “ 1 What do you impertinent rascals
mean by trespassing in this tunnel ’

  “ 1 Trespassing, do ye call it ’ snorted
the Irishman ‘ A dum foine naime it be
for murther’

  “ The remark so amused the commo-
dore that he laughed until I thought he
would burst The bedraggled appear-
ance of the drenched policemen helped
matters along, and soon the sergeant,
realizing how he had been Worsted, join-
ed in the laughter- The situation sud-
denly dawned upon the Irishman He
walked up close to the commodore, and
in a whispered tone said:

  “ 1 Ye won’t mintion it, will ye, yure •
honore—between two gintlemen’

The Question of Salary

  “ The latter remark I thought would
result fatally with the commodore—he
laughed so long and heartily But ‘ be-
tween two gintlemen,’ enough had been
said, and the incident was closed The
secret was not divulged

  “ I was saying I got seventy-live dol-
lars a month I was handed down, as it

were, when the commodore bought the
Harlem road, for I had served under five
presidents of the same company before
Cornele—that’s what we sometimes called
the commodore—got hold of it He
never thought to inquire as to my salary

  “ The road was making money—you
remember, a year after the commodore
was elected president of the New York
Central he declared a stock dividend of
eighty per cent—and one day, while out
driving with him, he asked, somewhat
abruptly: ‘What salary are you getting,
young man’

   “ I told him ‘ seventy-five dollars ’ as
meekly as I possibly could ‘ More than
you’re worth ’ was his curt reply But
at next pay-day, I think it was less than
a week off I found that my salary had
been doubled

A Ride with Cornele

  “ I shall never forget this particular
ride I took with Cornele I think it was
a Sunday morning At any rate, we were
going up to One Hundred and Third
Street to look at the new stock-yards I
got in the buggy at Twenty-Sixth Street,
and before we started the commodore
says to me: ‘Young man, they tell me
that tunnel leaks’

  “ I knew it only too well, but I
wouldn’t admit it So I thought by giv-
ing an evasive answer he would forget

  “ ‘ I think I’ll drive through and see
for myself,’ said he

  “ I remonstrated with him, not that I
cared so much about the leaks, but on ac-
count of the danger of driving a blooded
pair and a light runabout through the
tunnel He appeared not to hear me

  “ Whipping up his horses, we started
bumping over the ties Did he find any
leaks If you had known the''commo-
dore you wouldn’t ask As I said, the
leaks were there, and he found them

  “ After emerging from the tunnel at
Forty-Second Street, the commodore
turned into Fifth Avenue It was then
a dirt road above Forty-Second Street,
and the thoroughfare was lined with
boulders He drove‘around them so-reck-
lessly I feared that we would meet with
an accident, but he simply laughed when
I told him to be careful They were very
fine horses, that team, and I compliment-
150

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

ed the commodore on owning such fine
stock

  “ ‘ By George! ’ he replied, ‘ I
wouldn’t swap them for the whole Long
Island Railroad’ At that time I don’t
know that the commodore was putting
too high a valuation on his horses”

Money in Milk

   I asked Barton to give me some of the
Harlem freight - rates “ We changed
them so often,” he replied, “ that I can’t
remember a single rate It was a long
time ago, you know Our biggest traffic,
however, for a long time, was the trans-
portation of cattle and milk

   “ In the early sixties the Harlem road
handled as much as three thousand dol-
lars’ worth of milk—I mean in rates—
a day We charged, I think, a cent and
a half a quart, and we collected every
nickel before the milk was loaded We
had agents for that purpose

   “ I believe it was the milk and cattle
business that attracted the commodore to
the Harlem Railroad I first met him
when I was a passenger conductor on the
Harlem in 1854, and 1 believe that the
trips he used to make on my train had a
great deal to do with his purchasing the
line

   “ He always drove to the station, and
had me take the wheels from his buggy
and load it in the baggage-car Then I’d
place chairs for him in the baggage end
of the coach That’s the way he would
ride to Chatham He always carried his
lunch and a bottle of cider with him

  “ After I had made my collection the
commodore would ply me with questions
about the Harlem road How many gal-
lons of milk did we haul a day How
many engines had we Were they good
Did the farmers patronize the road  And
a hundred and one similar questions I
never realized what he was after until I
learned he had bought the road

  “In my opinion, the Harlem Railroad
—the New York and Harlem, it’s called
—is the greatest asset of the Vanderbilt
fortune to-day It is the key to the New
York Central situation While the Van-
derbilts have sold thousands and thou-
sands of shares of New York Central
stock, they could, even were they to dis-
pose of all their holdings, still dominate

the New York Central, on account of the
Harlem road

   “It is the very necessary tail to the
dog and the New York Central pays well
for the lease of the tail”

   Going back as far as 1854 led me to ask
Barton in what year he began railroading
He said that he became agent of the
Harlem road at Mott Haven in 1852, and
six months later resigned to take a freight
run on the same road Russell Sage, he
told me, was then running a general store
“ up State ” and frequently rode with
him

Stealing a Freight-Train

   “ I recall back in the fifties,” he con-
tinued, “ when five hundred people seized
one of our trains and compelled the crew
to bring them to New York There was
a famous prize-fight at Boston Corners
one night—the place gets its name from
the fact that three States, New York,
Connecticut, and Massachusetts, meet
there—and we carried up the noisiest and
rowdiest lot of passengers I have ever
seen

   “ W7e felt very much relieved when we
put them off at Boston Corners, and wired
headquarters not to stop the incoming
night express at that place The ‘ sports !
had intended catching, this train back to
the city

  “ When the fighters and sports found
themselves high and dry at the Corners,
with no place to sleep, they marched on
Millerton and after drinking all our
milk and roasting five or six pigs which
belonged to our agent, they compelled the
crew of the Millerton local to fire up

   “ There were five cars, but the gang,
determined to get revenge, made the crew
couple on all of the freight-cars at Mil-
lerton Poor old John Birchall was the
conductor It was nearly four o’clock in
the morning when he finally got his train
made up, and he brought those five hun-
dred people to the city without collecting
a cent

Blowing Them Off

   “ It was at Boston Corners, you know,
that the treacherous ‘blow hole’ was lo-
cated It was nothing more than a bre ’
in the cliffs, but the rocks were so situate
WITH THE FIRST VANDERBILT

151

that the winch-used to blow through the
gap with terrible force They had a
saying that the winds from the three
States met at the ‘ hole’

   “ They evidently did, one day in 1855,
when Tom Hyers came along with a train
of six'coaches As soon as the train got
opposite the ‘ hole ’ the rush of wind
blew all the coaches into the river
Everything left the track except the en-
gine It was a miracle that everybody
was not killed, but I believe only one life
was lost

  “ Hyers always swore that the only
thing that saved the engine from toppling
over was the fact that the engineer carried
a huge jack-knife, one of the blades of
which he had magnetized by slipping it
in the rail joints	®

   “ The most peculiar railroading in my
experience was out in Ohio, on the At-
lantic and Great Western Railroad,
which ran from Meadville to’ Salamanca
and thence to Cleveland and Cincinnati
It is now a part of the Erie I was gen-
eral manager of the United States Roll-
ing Stock Company, an English concern,
when General George B McClellan, the
father of New York’s present mayor, was
president The general was also presi-
dent of the Great Western

  “ In 1871 the general called me into
his office one morning, and told me that
he wanted me in Meadville next morning
to take charge of the Great Western
There was nothing to do but go

A Three-Gage Road

   “ I found the road a six-foot gage, and,
to further add to my horror and burden,
the connecting lines were either narrow
gage or standard This was the case all
through the Mahoning Valley There-
fore, in order to handle traffic—we didn’t
use the Ramsey transfer—we had three
rails, and every switch, of course, was
double ‘ j’inted’

   “ The Irish section-boss who, after be-
ing warned about his verbose accident re-
ports, wired, after a derailment, ‘ Off
ag’in, on ag’in, gone ag’in, Finnegin’
must have been a switchman on the Great
Western at some time There were so
many derailments that the splintered and
broken ties made the track look like a
corduroy wagon-road

  “ I have seen a six-foot-gage engine
pulling twenty-five cars, half of which
were of one gage and half of another
This, of course, required four couplings
for every car Then on some stretches of
track where we had three gages I have
seen a narrow-gage engine hauling stand-
ard six-foot-gage and narrow-gage cars
Imagine trying to switch a train made up
of different gage cars

   “ The most apt comparison I can think
of is the old drop hook link motion en-
gines When you pulled the throttle of
one of these engines you never knew
whether she was going ahead or back
So, when one of these trains struck a
switch there was such a difference of
opinion between the cars that some would
go one way and some another

      —	Held Up by Friends

   “ One day the division superintendent
at Meadville got this wire from a freight
conductor who had tried to run his train
into a siding west of Meadville: 1 Five
cars off on narrow-gage track  ten off on
six-foot eight off on standard Unable
yet to determine location of engine What
shall I do  ’ Back went the wire:

1 Sending ton of dynamite’

  “ I had a funny experience one night
with General McClellan We Were
bound for Cincinnati, and our train was
held up about two o’clock in the morn-
ing—I thought at first by train-robbers

1 got a good scare

   “ ‘ Little Mac,’ as the old ‘ vets ’ called
the general, dropped into Meadville one
afternoon and told me to get my car
ready, as he wanted to go west on number
three, which left Meadville at nine
o’clock at night There was no one on
the car except the general, myself, and
the colored porter We talked until
about midnight and then turned in I
was riding forward and the general oc-
cupied a stateroom in the rear of the car

  “ Suddenly 1 was awakened by some
one pounding on my door I demanded
to know the cause of the knocking, and
the train conductor, evidently agitated,
as I could judge from his voice, said:

   “ ‘ We’re held up, and they won’t let
us proceed They’re on the engine, and
iii front of us’

   “ ‘ By the great boot! ’ I yelled, get=

ting into my tilings, ‘ Shoot ’em ! Shoot
’em down! 1

   “ 1 It’s not that at all' explained the
conductor ‘ They’re a lot of old soldiers
in uniforms, and with banners, flags, and
torches, who demand a speech from Gen-
eral McClellan’

  “ ‘ This is certainly a pretty mess,’ I
mused As soon as 1 had dressed 1 went
forward to explain that ‘ Little Mac ’
was undressed and in bed That didn’t
make a particle of difference to the vet-
erans They had heard, early in the
night, that the general was on the regular
Cincinnati express, and their presence was
due to love for the war hero, and more-
over they were there to stay Finally I
told them that it would be impossible

  “ ‘ Then you’ll spend the night here,’
shouted a dozen old fighters

  “ I realized that they meant it and
went back to arouse the general I must
confess he wasn’t pleased, at first, but
after he got a glimpse of the great crowd
of soldiers and citizens—there must have
been four hundred—he relented When
he had dressed, I ran up to the engine
and told the soldiers, who were on the
track, that if they would step aside I
would have the train pulled up until the
private car, which was on the end of the
train, came up to them

  “ 1 Go wan, ye rebel! ’ yelled a man
with a torch ‘ Ye can’t trap us as aisy
as ye think We’ull go back to the caar,
but a body-guarrd will stick to tlr’ en-
gine’

Early Days on Long Island

  “ I had to submit to the arrangement,
in spite of the implied treachery The
general made a brief speech from the rear
platform, and at the conclusion of his re-
marks I signaled the conductor to go
ahead But we were again held up The
Irishman and his companions, who had
doubted my sincerity, refused to let the
engineer start until he and his friends
had shaken hands with General McClel-
lan”

  Barton told me that he had served on
the Long Island Railroad at three differ-
ent times, always as general superintend-

ent The first time was in 1866, when
Oliver Sharlock was president Again
in 1875 he took the general superintend-
ency of the old North Shore Railroad,
and in 1881, when Austin Corbin got
control of the road, Barton was placed
in charge of operation

  “ When I first went to the Long Is-
land Railroad under Sharlock,” contin-
ued Barton, “ the road ran from Hunter’s
Point, now Long Island City, to Green-
port I spent a week walking over every
foot of the track, and every step I took
I couldn’t help thinking of old Commo-
dore Vanderbilt’s remark about swap-
ping his horses for the Long Island Rail-
road

The Lost Rails

  “ I never in my life saw worse track
Accidents were so frequent that no one
depended on the railroad, and yet the
Long Island is one of the oldest steam
roads in this part of the country

  “ After I had finished my inspection
tour I surprised Sharlock by announcing
the immediate need of twenty thousand
ties and ten tons of rails On hearing
my demand, he all but expired

  “  Then, what in the name of heaven
has become of our rails’ he dramatic-
ally and excitedly cried (The rails had
been in use since about 1835)

  “ ‘ Y'ou can’t prove it by me,’ I replied

‘ I’ve been out on the line for nearly two_
weeks, and I haven’t found any rails’

  “ ‘ Then, what are our trains running
on ’ he asked in an injured manner

  “ ‘ On the sod,’ I answered

  “ And it was a fact The earth had
risen over the rails and had been packed
so firmly and so hard that the wheels of
the cars made, grooves in the sod, and
they were running on this more than on
the rails

  “ I say rails, but I never saw them
until Sharlock bought the ten toils I
wanted When I had laid the new rails,
Sharlock says to me:

  “ ‘ Well, Barton, I give you the credit
for having built the first railroad on
Long Island What we had before was
a hole in the ground’ ”

   The next Old-Timer Tale will tell of the Jarratt-Palmer special, which was a sensa-
tion in 1876, when it made a record-run from New York to San Francisco
 Recent Railroad Patents

BY FORREST G SMITH

The Vast Network of Railroad Efficiency and Railroad Equipment Has
Been Built up by Eighty Years of Such
Efforts as These

    We have decided to slightly change the form of our monthly article on Railroad
Patents, and to add another feature For a long time we have been receiving queries from
readers seeking advice about patent procedure, and heretofore Mr Smith has answered these
queries by mail In future we shall run these queries and the answers to them as an appendix to
the monthly article Every reader who has a problem of this nature is welcome to the services
of the department, and a letter addressed to Mr Forrest G Smith, or to the editor, will re-
ceive attention as early as possible

TORPEDOES—Ordinarily railroad tor-
pedoes are highly efficient as signals, but in
rainy or snowy weather the explosive mix-
ture which they contain becomes damp, even
after a few moments’ exposure, so that the
proper signal will not be given An ex-
tremely simple but very effectual remedy
for this evil is shown in a patent No 938,-
465, November 2, 1909, issued to Frank
Dutcher, of Versailles, Pennsylvania Mr
Dutcher provides a torpedo in which the
explosive-containing portion is sealed with a
water-proof substance

J

CONVENIENT BRAKE—It is now

customary for trainmen in setting the
brakes on a car or a train of cars, while they
are at a standstill, to climb onto the car
platform in order to set the brakes, but a
device patented by Henry C Ostermann of
Chicago, Illinois (No 939,076, November 2,
1909), obviates this necessity when the car
or cars are at a standstill The device is
embodied in an ordinary brake-mast, such
as now has mounted at its upper end the
usual hand-wheel, but in this device the
wheel-mast is swiveled so that it may be
swung down to extend behind the car and
be turned by means of the wheel, while

the brakeman is standing on the ground In
other words, the brake may be applied 011
any car, whether the brakeman is standing
on the ground or is on the car

SPRING JOURNAL LID—Spring

controlled journal-box lids have often
been suggested, but nearly all of them pos-
sess the disadvantage of being liable to seat
improperly, leaving a space for dust to enter
To prevent this, Thomas H Symington, of
Baltimore, Maryland, has patented, No 938,-
523 November 2, 1909, a journal-box lid
which is held in place by means of a heavy
spring, which, while it is arranged in the
usual manner, cooperates with a cam mem-
ber 011 the hinge of the box and lid, so as
to guide the lid to its seat and insure a close
fit between the parts

AUTOMATIC STOP—An entirely
automatic system for controlling trains is
disclosed in Patent No 941,233, November
23, 1909 issued to William G Daring, of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania His system is de-
signed to prevent the entrance of a train
into a block occupied by another train

  It is embodied in automatic means carried

tracks The system is so arranged that the
air-brakes will be applied on any train
entering a block occupied by another train
After stopping the train on which the mech-
anism is arranged, the actuating device for
the brakes is automatically reset

LUMBER-LOADER—Ordinarily,
lumber is loaded into cars by the aid of a
man in the car A device, shown in Patent
No 939,452 November 9, 1909 however, is-
sued to Edgar L Stocking, of Buffalo, New
York, makes it possible for lumber to be
loaded without this help

  The device consists merely of a bar struc-
ture, which is so constructed as to be ar-
ranged within the doorway of any car, and
which supports a roller which is of such
breadth that lumber may be readily shoved
over it and into the car The support for
the roller is moreover swiveled so that the
lumber may be guided into the car toward
either end and disposed according to the
wishes of the operator of the device

NEW RAIL PROCESS—As the or-
dinary form of rail is rolled, the strata
of the steel in the tread of the rail is posi-
tioned in layers parallel to the strata in the
web of the rail In other words, the grain
of the rail, if it were of wood, would run
the same in the head of the tread as in the
web of the rail

  As a result, rails soon become worn in
their tread surfaces, and have to be replaced
by new ones To overcome this disadvan-
tage, Norman Randleman, of Knoxville,
Pennsylvania, has devised a method of man-
ufacture, which is simple in the extreme,
but which will result in the rail manufac-
tured by the process having the grain of its
head run at right angles to the grain of its
web

  As a result, the life of the rail is pro-
longed and it will not pee! as does the ordi-
nary rail after a short period of use

RAIL-BENDER — A novel form of
rail-bending tool is disclosed in Patent
No 940,325, November 16 1909, issued to
Tames R James, of Ridley Park, Pennsyl-
vania Usually such devices are not adjust-
able to every size of rail, and are conse-
quently limited in their usefulness

  The device disclosed by Mr James, how-
ever, includes a bracket member, which is
adapted to be applied to a rail, and has
mounted upon it an arm, which is adjustable

so as to bring the rail engaging and bending
members into proper engagement with the
rail As a result, a rail may be bent by
means of this device at any desired angle,
regardless of its size

CONTROLLED HEADLIGHT

—Numerous devices have been proposed
for the purpose of keeping the headlights
of locomotives in alinement with the tracks,
but such devices have usually included mech-
anism connected with the trucks of the car
to which they are applied

  A device patented, No 940,446, November
16, 1909, by Silas W Pomery, of Big Run,
Pennsylvania, discloses an extremely simple
idea, which is adapted to this use, and
which includes 110 mechanism of this char-
acter The device is embodied merely in a
reflector, for the usual headlight, which is
pivotally mounted and is controlled solely
by means of weights so arranged as to
direct the rays of light from the reflector to
the tracks, regardless of curves, and inclines

STREET-CAR DOORS—As Pay-

as-you-enter cars are at present construct-
ed, the conductors are exposed to the cold,
or where the doors are so arranged’ as to
be normally closed to enclose the rear
platform, they must be manually opened by
the conductor at each stop

  Mr Harold Rowntree, of Chicago, Illi-
nois, has conceived the idea of providing
means operable from the movement of a
crank-handle at the inner end of the bar
behind which the conductor stands, for auto-
matically swinging the entrance door in-
wardly and the exit door outwardly The
patent disclosing this device, No 937,8/0,
October 26, 1909 has been assigned to one
of the principal manufacturers of this class
of cars

GRAIN-DOOR ESCAPE-It is de-
sirable that grain-car doors be so con-
structed that they may be partly opened so
as to allow the escape of a greater or less
quantity of grain before the entire door is
opened or removed Ordinarily, a small
door is arranged in the main door for this
purpose, but such doors permit the dis-
charge of grain in too great a volume-Tind
over too large an area to be satisfactory

  Richard R Reaveley, of Fort William,
Canada, has secured a patent No 93S7S9,
November 2, 1909, on a car door of this type,
consisting of three sections, two of which,
when arranged in closed position in the
door opening, leave a V-shaped opening,
which is closed by the third section This

latter section may be opened to a greater
or less degree, as may be desired, so as to
allow the discharge of a small stream of
grain through the V-shaped opening at the
narrow end thereof

A STRONGER FROG—A railway

track frog naturally receives considerable
thrust, which is usually transmitted to the
rails leading from the frog rails, causing
abnormal creeping of the rails This creep-
ing is overcome by a means disclosed in
Patent No 940,440, November 16 1909, is-
sued to William H Dotter and Raphael S
Hays, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and as-
signed to a large switch-manufacturing con-
cern of Pennsylvania

  The frog shown in this patent is formed
with pairs of spaced reinforcing ribs between
which seat the usual braces provided for
securing the frog to the ties Not only do
the ribs reenforce the frog rails, but they
also cooperate with the braces to hold the
frog against creeping

BETTER RAILS—A novel process in
treating railway rails so as lo prevent peel-
ing and render them practically proof against
shocks and wear, except after lengthy use
is disclosed in a patent No 941,134 Novem-
ber 23, 1909, issued to Fred H Daniels, of
Worcester Massachusetts In this method,
the blanks are first heated to a high degree
and then suddenly cooled so as to impart a
very fine crystalline structure to them

  They are then heated again and cooled
gradually, so as to eliminate internal strain,
after which they are cold rolled so as to
lengthen and flatten the crystals throughout
the entire exterior surface By this method,
a kind of fiber is formed at and near the
exterior surface of the rail, rendering it
tenacious, so to speak, and calculated to ma-
terially prolong the life of the rail

•

HOSE-COUPLING—N u merous

automatic air and steam couplings have been
devised for railway cars, but nearly all of
them have lacked the one thing which will
render their adoption really practicable That
is, they nearly all are rigidly mounted so
that a slight difference in elevation between
the cars to be coupled will be liable to result

in leaks or imperfect engagement of the
couplings

  To obviate this disadvantage, Joseph V
Robinson, of Salem, Oregon, has patented
(-No 937961 October 26 1909) a coupling
of this class, which will be effectual whether
the cars to be coupled are in or out of direct
alinement as regards their couplings

  The coupling employed may be of the
ordinary form, which includes centering
wings, to bring the terminals of the pipes to
be coupled in mutual engagement, but,
whereas such devices have before been rig-
idly supported, the heads of this coupling
are held in position solely by stout springs,
which serve to support the same from the
main air and steam-supply pipes

  These springs will, of course, yield when
the heads upon two cars contact so as to
insure of proper mutual engagement

ANSWERS TO PATENT PROB-
LEMS

HD L, Tacoma, Washington—Has any
• patented nut lock been adopted for
actual, use

  Only in an experimental way on short
lines of track Even the simpler forms,
patents on which have long expired, have
not met with favor

RM S, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—Is
• the idea of wireless communication
between moving trains patentable

 The idea itself is old and would not be,
even if new but the novel features of such
a system would be considered the proper
subject-matter for a patent

RT B Cincinnati, Ohio—Are spark-ar-

•	resters now in general use on loco-
motives 

  2 Can patents still be secured on such
devices 

  1	But few are in general use, and such
as are are chiefly those on which the pat-
ents have expired, and which are, as a rule,
much similar in construction than those
which have been recently proposed and
patented

  2	There is 110 art which has been ex-
hausted and patent may be secured 011 any

                                          Through a sleeping countryside

Under a moonless, starlit sky

                                        Where the whirling winds have died

                        From my place in the swelling foot-hills

                      Far out toward the rim of night,

                      I know that the Mail is straining
                      In leash, with a wondrous might

SONG OF THE NIGHT MAIL

                     From my seat, in the swelling foot-hills
                     I can hear a muffled throb,

                     Like the march of a distant army,

                      Or a restless, seething mob

                                      I know that the Mail is coming
                                      Ere 1 see the light at the head

                                       For the muffled throb is the mighty wheels
                                       As they spurn each silver thread

                    Then from the edge of darkness
                    Comes a steady speck of light

                    The throb becomes a muffled roar
                    Far out in the eastern night

                                        Now I see the distant flashes

                                     From beneath the swaying hood,

                                     As a sweating, heaving pygmy

                                    Crams the monster's maw with food

                    And then with a roar like thunder
                    The Midnight Mail goes by

                      The strips of steel scarce touch the wheel,

                       It fairly seems to fly!

                    The furnace door like a glimpse of hell—

                    And the Midnight Mail is by

 Being a Boomer Brakeman

BY HORACE HERR

THE improvident boomer of the In and Out System having managed to
get together, at one time, as much as one dollar in United States coin,
flew the coop and hotfooted it to Mexico, where he had some esca-
pades which were so hot that a Chile con carne factory would be an ice-house
in comparison

    It seems as if every railroad man wants to have a fling at Mexico, and
if the experiences of any who have emigrated there are at all like those of
Mr Herr's hero, we don't wonder that it's better to keep this side of the
gringo-belt

    Our boomer has hustled back to his native heath—lie has gone home to
help father milk the cows and wean the pigs Thus ends a brief but varied
railroad career We are not sorry having read about it—are you

are forty men for every job, and a card
isn’t good for a look-in at a square meal
I went down there thinking I would catch
on as manager of the Southwestern, or
some other easy money, but there was a
nothing-doing sign hanging over the en-
tire place

  I	went onto the G H and S A extra
board, but you couldn’t get a trip down
there for love nor money Those fellows
get a job and never leave it until they are
ready for the Soldiers’ Home

  Then I went to shuffling cars in the
yard The first string they cut off on me
when I was in the field ran down and
hit the rear end of a switch-engine, put
the tank over the smokestack, and it was
me for the time-check and out of the job
again, a private in the great army of the
unemployed

  One week more and I was looking for

          ID you ever notice how inde-
pendent a fellow gets when
he has a dollar in his
pocket He will rise up in
his dignity and tell a rail-
road to go to the under-

in the belief that that one dollar will
buy the sun, moon, and stars When the
last penny is gone and he hasn’t any-
thing in his pocket that will make a rat-
tle, he’s mighty glad of the chance to
fight the cinders 011 the head end and
lug chains in order to get back on the
pay-roll

  I flew the job on the In and Out, and
decided that I would quit railroading for
some other occupation a little less strenu-
ous I might have kept the resolve, if I
hadn’t drifted into El Paso, Texas

a hand-out, looking hard with a magni-
fying-glass, and there was still nothing
doing Every one appeared to be on the
side or running light, and I had to flag
the meal-stops until I got so thin that I
looked like the imported living skeleton
in a side-show

  Then I began to cast longing glances
across the Rio Grande to the land of the
“ quien sabe ”

Land of Lead Dollars

  Mexico for me, where the lead dollars
come easy and go twice as fast where
the last summer's clothes are plenty good
enough and a sandal-foot peon is the only
one you have to look out for Without
the price of the toll-bridge, I got over
to Juarez, out-talked a conductor on a
south-bound drag, and climbed aboard,
bound some place, I didn’t know where,
but content to feel that I was on my way

  I woke up in Chihuahua, a beautiful
village, with a popula-
tion of two hundred	'
thousand—counting the
dogs — but there was
nothing doing there,
not even a free lunch

It was back to the dog-
house for me, and the
next stop was Torreon

At Torreo n things
looked better

  I heard that there
was a chance down at
Jimulco, and that night
I rode the sky-side of a
water-car into Jimulco

The next day I walked
into the trainmaster’s
office and asked for a
job running a train

  No more stinger stunts
for me What’s the use
of being modest  I
knew that I could handle
the bills and sign the
orders, and 1 couldn’t
see the use of working
for eight Mex when I
could pull down two
hundre cl and work
less

  Nothing doing as a
conductor, so I took

the next best thing, and woke up to
find that I was again the proud possessor
of one of those brass keys and a badge
When I climbed onto Vernon’s caboose
I’ll admit that I heaved a sigh of relief,
even though my braking pardner was a
greaser, for I saw square meals looming
up again, and I was more than anxious
to see if the corners would really hurt me

  Now, I’ll say a few things about rail-
roading in Mexico You can pick up
most any old newspaper and see start-
ling accounts of how the entire crew of
some train has been taken to jail for
somp trivial offense The blood-and-
thunder stories which come out of the
South would fill several volumes

Fine Jail Service

  Take it from me straight that there

the same brand in the United States, but
the way they have of administering their
legal medicine is something fierce

  In the outlying and isolated districts,
petty judges are so ignorant that they
couldn’t read a law-book, even though it
was printed in words of one syllable and
illustrated with signs They never saw
a law-book, and never want to Their
personal feeling is the only law they
recognize, and a gringo [American] is
legitimate prey	_

  In the United States about the first
thing a conductor buys is a good watch—
in Mexico his first purchase is generally
a forty-four revolver All you want the
gun for is a bluff, for nine-tenths of the
gringoes wouldn’t use the gun if they
had a chance

  You see, it’s something like this: The
road says that it will hold you responsi-
ble for the merchandise-cars They put
them right next the caboose, where you
can watch them : and if some thieving
son of Mexico gets busy and steals some
of the imported silk, you have to answer
for it to the company

  Suppose you catch the fellow in the
act and take a shot at him and get him
then you are up against the Mexican
law as it is, and a gringo never gets any
of the best of it in court

Chile Coal and Poor Water

  Braking in Mexico isn’t just like a
Sunday - school picnic by a great deal
About fifty per cent of the trunk-line
traffic is in ores They have the big en-
gines down there now, just as they have
in the United States and Chile coal and
poor water make the hog-head’s life a
burden

   In the first place, the fireman can’t put
the coal-dust into the fire-box fast enough
to keep her hot and when he does get a
fire just about the place he wants it, he
has to open the fire-door and put in the
rake By the time he has the fire-bed
raked, the cold air has reached the flues,
and they are leaking a steady stream

  Water goes to working through the
stack, and if it’s not one thing, it’s an-
other If ever a train—a freight-train,
at least—made running-time in Mexico,
it is not recorded on the books of national
history

  If it happens that an engine is in con-
dition to permit of its making the run-
ning-time the conductor won’t let the
engineer speed it, for fear he will heat the
boxes A real brass is almost a stranger
down there

A “ Good ” Job

  Every ore-car is equipped with shell
brasses, and as soon as the babbitt has
melted you know what happens If you
find it before the journal drops, you’re
mighty lucky It’s easy during the night-
time, for every time you hit a curve you
can look along the string and if you
see one blazing, you can pull the air and
go over and cool it ofF

  During the day you have to depend on
your sense of smell, or stop every twenty
kilometers and go feel them over My
first trip out of Jimulco was south to
La Colorado, and it took just thirty-two
hours to make the two hundred and ten
kilometers

  On that trip I put on one new air-
hose, one Gould knuckle, chained up
twice, packed fourteen hot boxes, and put
in three new brasses When I got in on
that run the pay looked mighty poor—
eighty Mexican “ dobies ” a month for
such work as that but my Mexican
pardner said that it was a good job
Perhaps it was for him, but I never did
think much of his tastes

  Then the men began to tell me a few
of those choice little stories of the men
who had gone the route There are tw-o
dreaded routes in Mexico One is the
wreck route, the other is via the little
adobe with the barred door, sometimes
called the jail, the “ hoosgau,” or any-
thing else you want to call it

Into the Canyon

  There was Skinny Farris, who had his
little experience with the Mexican law,
and Tim Lee, of Denver, who was then
over at Zacatecas doing time for the Za-
catecas wreck, in which sixty Mexicans
were killed He was a steady patron at
the national boarding - house for over
thirteen months without a trial, and then
they turned him out because it was so
expensive to keep him

After I had finished my time braking
BEING A BOOMER BRAKEMAN

161

and had been set up to running a train,
I was one of the boys who carried Tim
over the pike to the,border at El Paso
When he came out of that town he was a
wreck, physically and mentally, and here
is the straight of how he went there:

  Lee was an engineer running between
Zacatecas and La Colorado One eve-
ning he coupled onto a passenger-train
coming out of Zacatecas and when the
conductor brought the orders over for his

  When he hit the first bend on that
mountain, and gave them about five
pounds to settle them on the rails before
taking the curve, he found that his train
line, which commands the brakes, was
cut off He called for hand-brakes, but
what could a few haild-brakes do after
a train had such a start

  He took the next curve all right, but
the third one — well, they shot out into
a canon like a greased rocket

signature he brought a message from the
despatches asking if lie could make up
fifteen minutes 011 the running-time from
Zacatecas to Calero

  Tim’s reply was: “ If they stay 011 the
rails, I can make it”

  From Zacatecas to Calero is down the
side of the famous Zacatecas Mountain,
and five coaches need a lot of air to
hold them when they are dropping down
a heavy mountain grade Mexican car
repairers and inspectors are supposed to
look over every train which pulls out of
Zacatecas, and when they gave Lee the
high sign he supposed that his train was
all right

    11 RR

  Engine, tender, baggage-car, and two
coaches went along Sixty Mexicans
didn’t get home to their beans that night,
and Lee was picked up from the bottom
of the pile of scrap-iron, leg and arm
broken and badly scalded, and hurried
off to jail He never came to trial, and
he was 110 more to blame for the accident
than was I or any one else who was a
thousand miles away

What One Woman Did

Colorado He had one American brake-
man on his crew, who was a mighty good
man One evening they came to Ji-
mulco, and when they stepped off the ca-
boose a flossy little greaser policeman,
wearing the authority of the law and a
saber, led them over to an 8x10 jail, the
dirtiest little hole you were ever in

  There they stayed for seventy-two
hours, with nothing to eat except the
grub which the rest of us were able to
slip through the bars, while his -royal
nibs, the “ hombrey ” with the saber, was
down at the corner cantina accumulating
a train - load of tequila Finally they
brought them into court to try them

  Some woman had complained that the
two of them had put her off a freight-
train when she was endeavoring to bum
her way to town to buy some supplies
They had never seen the woman before,
and the evidence showed conclusively
that they were not guilty, and that the
woman had jumped off a moving train
and broken a leg

  “ Not guilt}',” was the verdict, and
then the judge fined them sixty-four dol-
lars That’s going some now, isn’t it
Can you beat it If they had been guilty
of that heinous crime, they would have
been digging in the salt-mines still

  After that, 1 decided that if I ever
caught up with trouble before trouble
caught up with me I would make the big
hike for the line, without the formality
of kissing my Mexican friends good-by,
and never take a chance with Mexican
justice outside the City of Mexico

  I am awful glad I decided that way,
for it was just a month after that when
I got into it Never mind what it was
I didn’t take my bills down to the office
when I got in that trip I had the brake-
raan register in for me

  He was a Mexican, and the Mexican

(The

 law isn’t made for the native—it’s made
 for the gringo He took the bills, and I
 took the second section of a passenger-
 train which happened to be pulling out
 for the States

   I climbed into the baggage-car and hid
 underneath a big pile of burlap for
 eighteen hours until my friends, the bag-
 gage-master and the conductor, came over
 and dug me out, and pointed through the
 open door to where I could see Old
 Glory waving from the flagpole of P'ort
 Bliss, near El Paso

    Half an hour later I was over the line,
 making naughty faces at Mexico, and
 vowing that 1 would never visit that
 beautiful country again One trip was
 enough — especially under the circum-
 stances—and I hardly believe that, even
 in time, I would ever get used to eating
 beans and tortillas three times a day

   So far, I have kept that vow I wait-
 ed around El Paso until the pay - car
 came over the line, some twenty days
 later, drew my Mexican pesos, had them
 changed into real money, and then, while
 I had the coin, I bought a ticket back to
 the dear old East, and went prospecting
 for a job—not a railroad job, but a place
 where you are home every night, and
 as long as you -work and duck the street-
 cars, you are reasonably sure of meeting
 yourself at the supper-table every evening

   While I have the greatest respect for
 the men who follow the railroad game,
 a grae full of more danger and real ro-
 mance than any other calling in the
 world, oiill I would rather lie on the out-
 side looking in than on the inside where
 you can’t see at all And I guess a fel-
 low will reach that stage soon enough
 where all the friends pass by and say
 “ How natural he looks! ” without tempt-
 ing fate by hanging around a Baldwin
 hog or a dog-house

 The Death of “ Dread 107”

BY RALPH C MULLIGAN

THIS is the story of the most unfortunate locomotive that ever turned
a wheel—'1 Dread 107 ”—cursed by every man who ever had anything
to do with her We have never heard of a locomotive history to equal
hers If so—if any of our readers can tell a more remarkable story of wreck
and ruin—we want to see it and we cordially invite them to submit it for
our consideration

    It seems strange, almost uncanny, that one disaster after another, ac-
companied by loss of life, should have followed with such regularity
Is it a wonder that engineers absolutely refused to take her out

After Twenty Years of Appalling Disaster, the Old Man-Killer of the
Rockies, Whose Name Was a Byword, Adorns
a Scrap-Heap

READ 107,” the fiend-driven
locomotive which has
launched into eternity a
dozen of her train crews
and has been in twice that
many fatal wrecks the
locomotive which superstitious firemen
and engineers swear was haunted by ffie
fantom spirits of her victims who could
be seen at night, awful in aspect, sitting
in the engine cab or gliding up over the
pilot, is in the scrap-heap  dead, after
twenty years of terrible service

  Hearts of railroad men on the Denver
and Rio Grande beat slower, for all
along the line she-was known as a man-
killer Death sat at her throttle

  After her last fatal wreck, eight years
ago she was virtually abandoned with

a death roll of seven engineers, six fire-
men, and almost two scorc of passengers

  She earned her name during the first
two years she was in service, when one
disaster after another occurred in rapid
succession, always fatal to the engine
crew, and frequently to the passengers
Railroad men soon believed the 107 was
hoodooed and it became increasingly dif-
ficult to persuade an engineer to run her
She was 'transferred from one division
to another, leaving destruction in her
wake and bearing such an ominous his-
tory that among the more superstitious
ii was like getting a death-warrant to
be called to take her out

  “ Dread 107 ” was one of three
anthracite burners, the first of such type
to lie used in the Rocky Mountain coun-

try, sent out in 1888, and put on the
passenger run between Gunnison and
Grand Junction in western Colorado

  It was a narrow-gage line, which had
been built in 1883, and followed a
treacherous, tortuous path-through moun-
tain gorges and across deep canons—the
only route through the Rockies at this
point until the tunneling of Marshall's
Pass, a year later

  On the night in early spring when 107
left Grand Junction on her first trip
over the division, Bill Duncan, who was
the first man to pull a train over the
Continental Divide, was at the throttle,
and Josh Zoogley was firing

  They were well on their way toward
Gunnison, the new locomotive running
without a hitch Duncan opened her
up on a straight stretch down Black
Eagle Canon

  He did not know that part of the
bridge had been carried away Without
warning, the train plunged into the river,
bearing the engineer and fireman to their
death To this day the exact number
of passengers who lost their lives is not
known

  “ Dread 107 ” lay at the bottom of the
canon until late in the summer, when the
river receded and she could be raised
She was taken to the yards at Salida
and put in condition She went back
to her run again in November, and for
two months -nothing happened

Bill Godfrey’s End

  Bill Godfrey was the next engineer
to whom she was assigned With a fire-
man named Bell, who was making his
first run on the division, Godfrey left
Gunnison on Christmas Eve, both train
crew and passengers eagerly anticipating
their arrival at Grand Junction to spend
the holiday

  It was bright moonlight, but just
around Blindman’s Curve, between Esca-
lanta and Domingues, a ten-ton boulder,
which had loosened and fallen, obstruct-
ed the path of the train It was going
at a high rate of speed and the impact
of the collision was terrible Godfrey
and Bell were instantly killed, and several
passengers were added to the list of fa-
talities

  It took nearly two months to repair

the engine, and she was not put in service
again until early in March, 1889 Al-
ready old engineers were fighting shy of
her, and Frank Bratt, a new man on the
road, offered to take the run

  Pie made only two round trips On
another bright moonlight night, the 11th
of March, “ Dread 107 ” and Bratt left
Gunnison, passed Blindman’s Curve
where Godfrey and Bell had but recent-
ly been killed, and started down the
Black Eagle Canon, which had been the
scene of the first disaster

  Between Thapaniro and Currecanti,
one of the worst snowslides for many
a season was encountered When 107
struck it she turned turtle, and both en-
gineer and fireman were crushed to
death In this case the passengers es-
caped unscathed

Few Would Take Her Out

  After this accident the locomotive
had such a name that few men could
be persuaded to take her out For over
a year she lay in the yard at Grand Junc-
tion, and then an attempt was made to
put her back on her old run, but so firm-
ly implanted in the hearts of all the en-
gineers was the belief that 107 was hoo-
dooed that all sorts of excuses were made
for refusing to run her

  It was at this time that she was nick-
named “ Dread 107,” which has clung to
her even until to-day, when she lies a
mass of battered and rusty iron

  Uncanny stories were circulated about
her, tales of spirits that were seen at
night clambering in and out of the cab
as she lay in the roundhouse premoni-
tions, which all six of the crews who
were on her death roll were said to have
told them of their fate

  ,In despair at the reports from division
headquarters, the locomotive was ordered
transferred to Salt Lake City, to run
between that city and Ogden, a distance
of about eighty miles over prairie coun-
try

  At first there were only minor acci-
dents, two rear-end freight collisions in
which no one was hurt, and a derailment
that killed an unknown hobo who was
riding back of the tender

  “ Mad Ole ” Gleason was her engi-
neer and in the remembrance of the old-
             '

THE DEATH OF “ DREAD 107”	165

est railroader in the West, a more dare-
devil hand never held the throttle For
fifteen years “'Mad Ole ” had been in
an engine cab and in a half-score wrecks,
but never once had he been more than
scratched

  His friends said he had a charmed
life, and the old engineer believed it him-
self Within six months from the day
when he set foot inside “ Dread 107 ”
he was picked up a corpse

Into a Stock-Train

  It was a head-on collision with a
train of live stock The engine crew of
the freight jumped before 107, with
“ Mad Ole ” in the cab, piled on top
of them In all, five persons were killed
in this wreck The cause was never satis-
factorily explained People merely said,
“ she collided with 107”

  Although now only three years old,
107 was so battered up when she came
out of this collision that after she had
been repaired she was relegated to
freight service

   For over two years her history was un-
eventful, and many thought that the
hoodoo had been broken During that
time her name lost some of its former
terror, and then one night, lest her old
record be entirely forgotten, some un-
known hand carved in the woodwork of
the cab the names of the eight men who
had met their death there and the list
and dates of the various wrecks in which
she had figured

  From that time, although there were
still no new accidents, misfortune seemed
to follow all those connected with her
Sickness and death among the train crew
and their families, ill luck of various
kinds, which was all traced by the su-
perstitious victims to the old locomotive

When Flynn Went Crazy

  “ f)read 107 ” celebrated her sixth
anniversary in a startling way, which,
as told by old railroad men, is half fact
and half legend

  It was a Sunday morning, and she was
standing in the Ogden yards with steam
up ready for her eighty-mile haul En-
gineer Tom Flynn was in the cab and
liis brother was fireman Suddenly Flynn

opened the throttle, and the locomotive
sprang forward and was a hundred yards
down the track before the yardmaster
or anybody realized what had happened

   She did not stop until she rolled over
an embankment on a curve twelve miles
away Two trains which were in her
path were flagged, and got on sidings
without a second to spare

  Fireman Flynn was picked up uncon-
scious beside the track several miles frrm
where 107 engine had been ditched He
died next day as a result of internal in-
juries, but not until, half delirious, he
had told of a mad tussle with his brother
and how he was finally thrown backward
from the cab

  The engineer was found pinned be-
neath his overturned engine, a raving
lunatic As this story is told in smoky
cabooses on stormy nights, it is declared
that Flynn went mad while staring at
the death roll of the victims of 107

   If it had been difficult before, it was
impossible now to get an engineer to run
her She was once more transferred—
this time to Alamosa in southwestern
Colorado on the other side of the moun-
tains She was sent deadhead from Og-
den across the divide to her new home,
so unwilling were those who knew, her
history to ride in her cab

Her dumber Changed

  Before starting on her new run, she
underwent a thorough overhauling and
painting, the offensive death roll in the
cab was removed and, most important
of all, her number was changed to 100
in the hope of forever burying “ Dread
107 ” and all the superstition which sur-
rounded her

  During the next few years, little is
known of her history although, gradu-
ally, her former identity became known
and she was regarded with curious in-
terest Then came tales that fantoms
had been seen on moonlight nights riding
on the pilot as she puffed slowly up the
mountain grades, and these fantoms al-
ways had one hand upraised toward the
number, as if trying to change the  0 ”
to a “ 7”

   One spring, during the freshets, the old
locomotive once more rolled into a ditch,
scalding to death an engineer named

Peters and maiming her fireman But,
strangest of all, when she was brought
into Alamosa again there was her right-
ful number, “ 107,” back in its old place

  Who changed it It was the spooks,
some of the superstitious claimed But
after that she kept her number and her
old name, “ Dread 107”

  For the next five years she remained
in the Alamosa roundhouse, used only
on occasional emergencies, gradually
growing more antiquated, and dilapi-
dated, feared and hated by all, from the
oldest eagle-eye to the youngest call-boy

  Before making her last journey to
join her less famous sisters in the burial-
ground of scrap-iron at the Burnham
station, 107 was destined to be in an-
other wreck, more horrible in its conse-
quences than any in her evil history

  It was a long winter on the Alamosa
division—a hard winter, with wrecks,
snow-slides, and washouts that nearly par-
alyzed traffic During that winter, not
one fire was built beneath its boilers

  Then, one June morning, she steamed
out in the yard, in charge of Frank Mur-
phy, an engineer who, alone of all who

knew her record, scoffed at bad luck
Jenkins, his fireman, had just finished
eight weeks in the hospital The 107 was
to take a string of empty gravel-cars
to Mear’s Junction to load, and every
operator along the line shuddered with
dread as he sent the number

  That night Frank Murphy started on
the return trip to Alamosa with a heavy
train of gravel It was all' down grade,
and only two trains to meet Six miles
out of Mear’s Junction, on the worst
piece of track on the whole division,
Murphy suddenly realized that his train
was running away

  He shut off steam, applied the worn-
out air and whistled for hand-brakes

  No one lived to tell what- happened
At the foot of the mountain the runaway
crashed into a light mixed train, the
wreck caught fire, and Murphy, Jenkins,
and the conductor, the engineer and a
brakeman of the mixed train were killed

  “ Dread 107 ” never made another
run The man-killer locomotive, which
had more deaths ai d more wrecks to her
credit than any other in the intermoun-
tain country, was abandoned forever

WHY CASEY DOESN’T WORK

       BY RAY H HOLSINGER

        Written for “The Railroad Man’s Magazine”

 MY name is Jerry Flannigan, Oi
 work on siction three,

      Pat McCarty is the foreman,
 and a dacint man is he

 Oi’ve just wan fault to foind with
 him, Oi'm tellin’ you of it,

 In regard to Casey, his first man, who
 doesn’t work a bit

 Of all th’ lazy min Oi’ve saw, he is
 th’ limit yet,

 Us other bys have nicknamed him,
 “ Ould Pat McCarty’s pet”

 Whin we are puttin’ in th’ ties, or
 linin’ up th’ thrack,

 Instid of sweatin’ loike th’ rest, he
 sits upon th’ jack

 If it happens we are cuttin’ weeds,
 his dear back doesn’t bend

 It’s “ Casey, take the speeder and run
 over th’ east end”

 Oh it’s Casey this, and Casey that,
 and Casey, ile th’ car,

 And Casey mustn’t sile his hands on
 some ould tampin’ bar

 An' if they have a washout, down on
 th’ Wymore branch,

 We all must go but Casey, he can stay
 and run th’ ranch

 An' whin th’ pay-car comes along, ould
 Casey steps up spry

 An’ draws the same as all th' rest, an’
 nivir bats an eye

 Th' roadmaster has got a snap, th’
 siction foreman, too,

 But Casey’s job skins theirs because,
 he’s not a thing to do

 Oi'd like to own a railroad, but if
 sich a thing can’t be,

 That first man on th’ siction job is
 good enough for me

 If things don't change around this
 gang, Oi'll quit nixt pay-day sure,
 To have ould Casey for straw-boss, is
 more than Oi’ll endure

BY EDWARD HOLDEN

           A Smooth Game Is Checked by a Dupe
           Who Happened to Be Waiting for a Local

was 10 pm when the Toledo
train left Pittsburgh  Dis-
posing my baggage, I re-
moved my coat and opened
the window Then, with my
pipe for solace, 1 lay back in
the serene consciousness of having ar-
ranged for the comfort of the all-night
passenger in a day-coach Mine was the
third facing seat on the right of the car,
the first being occupied by two men who
seemed to have already traveled some
distance on the train Opposite them
were two railroad men, deadheading

  A few other yawning travelers were
scattered through the car behind me

  When we had made some fifteen miles,
I finished my smoke, and started to doze
But my time was not yet

  “ Smoke these on me,” I heard one of
the men on first seat right say, as he
tossed two cigars to the railroad men op-
posite He leaned over, and I saw his
face—lean even to sharpness, with thin
but overly loose lips

  “ Boys,” he went on to the two across,
“ two days ago I was flat on my back—
hadn’t even a feather for the aborigine’s
head on a red cent Now I’ve come into
something that’ll make the success of
Rockefeller and Carnegie look like that
negative virtue which is often referred
to as being the color of verdigris They
all thought I was good for nothing—the
folks in Toledo, 1 mean—but I’ll show
’em by agreeably making the fortunes of

 some forty or fifty relatives, giving ’em
 all jobs working for me

    “It sounds fishy, doesn’t it But it’s
 true I say, Gus,” turning to his com-
 panion, “ 1 can’t hardly believe in such
 good luck—that I’m really president of
 this new company we’re organizing
 Hoo! Hoo! Hoc! Hee! Hee!”

   Presently he and Gus got out pencil
 and paper and commenced figuring In
 the lull I dozed off

   Next thing I knew I was awakened
 by the words, “ I’ll give you two hun-
 dred a month and expenses,” and found
 the man of the financial bonanza in
 earnest converse with a man who occu-
 pied the seat in front of mine

   “ Rent an office and storeroom in
 Mansfield, your home town,” he contin-
 ued in tones husky with enthusiasm,
 “ and store white lead and oils by the
 ton”

   He came back and sat with the stran-
 ger in his desire to explain more fully

    “ Now, I'll furnish you with an auto-
 mobile—steam or electric—and you can
 equip your office to suit yourself as our
 manager Don’t stint Get good fur-
 niture—put a Brussels rug on the floor,
 if you want it Advertise freely And
 above all, get good men—and hold ’em”
 This he added with insistent emphasis,
 and went on:

   “ 1 f some other company pays its
painters and decorators five dollars a
day, pay yours five and a quarter, or
167
168

five and a half—but hold ’em, if you
have to pay six”

  1 began to throw my sound-receivers
wide open about this time—for a capital-
ist who is hiring men at high salaries for
a new concern has a most absorbing at-
traction for a clerk who, like myself, has
not yet reached the century mark in his
monthly stipend

  I began to cast about for a pretext to
talk to this man Maybe this stuff about
“ Opportunity once gone is lost forever,”
was no stuff, after all Here seemed to
be a chance for me to better myself If
I sat still and did nothing, I might never
see another—surely never a better Just
then the man who hired rose to return to
his own seat, and the stranger moved to a
seat across the car

  “ Don’t forget,' F H Andrews, 425
Victoria Building, Toledo, Ohio,” said
the former, injparting, “ and wire or come
to see me personally when you get things
in shape” And he and Gus returned to
their pencils and paper

  I must have dozed again, for when I
was next conscious we had stopped at
Alliance, and a man came through with
hot coffee and sandwiches The man who
hired bought some and set about demol-
ishing them

  It struck me as queer that one who had
fallen into sudden opulence should ride
all night in a smoker and lunch on coffee
and sandwiches but I concluded that
either he must be a man of hard demo-
cratic sense or had not as yet come into
possession of much ready money I ob-
served that the railroad men had moved
my traps to the left front seat, where was
a most promising field for stretching my
six feet one for slumberous purposes

  I hadn’t settled long before the man
who hired looked at me and whispered to
Gus Then he came across, and I was
glad I had not made first advances, for
now I was in a position of greater ad-
vantage

  “ Can I talk to you a little while ” he
began, and, at my acquiescence, dropped
beside me

  “ My name’s Andrews,” he com-
menced—“ F H Andrews, president of
the Andrews Decorating Company, of
Toledo”

  I felt a chill at the nearness of so great
a person, but the American in me rose

up — Diogenes, I believe, was the first
American—and I disclosed my name with
some sonority

  “ We’re just organizing,” said An-
drews—“ going to have branches in all
the large cities of the country Want
men—good men—every class What is
your business, and what does it pay”
he ended in crisp tones that admitted of
no application of the word inquisitive

  “ Bookkeeper Thousand a year,” I
Replied, with equal telegraphic direct-
ness

  “ We need you Give you twenty-four
hundred a year if you will act as our man-
ager Gus, turning to his companion,
who came across, “ shake hands with Mr
Nichols Mr, Nichols, Mr Wilson, my
brother-in-law Mr Wilson,” he went
on to me, “ has left a job that paid him
two hundred and a quarter, to help
me systematize my new company So,
Gus” he questioned and Gus nodded

  “ How do you want me to begin, and
where ” I inquired

  “ Rent a place—storeroom and office
—in Pittsburgh, your home town, he
replied, tapping my knee “ Store it with
white lead and oils Furnish your office
well Hire good painters and decora-
tors—good, mind you—at five and a half
or six a day, if necessary but don’t hesi-
tate to overbid other companies in wages
and underbid for work, in order to hold
your men and secure the contracts You
can refer all bills to me—F IT Andrews,
president, 425 Victoria Building, Toledo

  “ I’ll send you an automobile—steam
or electric—or you can come on through
with me to Toledo, and we’ll buy it now,
and you can take it back with you Think
it over, and tell me how you like the of-
fer” And he and Gus returned to their
pencils and paper

  Well, I want to tell you, the thoughts
whirled in and out upon me about then
Two hundred a month! A practically
independent position ! My own boss ! But
where was I to find credit to store white
lead and oils by the ton, to buy furniture,
or even pay the first month’s rent And
he had said- nothing about advancing
anything, nor offered to establish my
credit in Pittsburgh The matter began
to look to me like a newspaper advertise-
ment for managers with some capital to
invest
THE MAN WHO HIRED

160

  “Well, what do you think about it”
called Andrews across the car “ Will
you take it ”

  “ Don’t know whether I will or not,”
I replied “ I don’t know you, nor you
me, but I’ll think about it”

  “ Says he’ll think about it Hoo! IIoo!

cause the ravings of a harmless lunatic
were such

  Wilson looked back to see if Andrews
could see him, but he had gone through
the swinging-door into the second com-
partment of the smoker so Wilson came
over and sat by me

MEN

Hoo! Hee! Hee!” spurted the man who
hired, to Gus

  “ Why, man,” he went on, “ it’s a sur-e
thing Make your fortune We’ll buy
materials in such quantities that we can
underbid them all We’ll get the con-
tracts for all the great amusement parks
in the country — painting their scenery
and ornamentation

  “ Well, there’s time yet, and if you de-
cide later to accept, you have my address,
and can write me,” and he moved down
the car—to make more managers, 1 sup-
posed

  I was beginning to wonder why “ Gus ”
Wilson said so little, for to my mind he
looked as if he knew more than President
Andrews I was startled to hear the
man’s voice just then, speaking to me in
a low tone across the aisle

  “ Don’t mind him,” he said—“ he’s
crazy I’m taking him from Reading to
Toledo Asylum Easiest way to get him
there is to keep him in a good humor
with this rot of organizing a company

  Well, I just wilted You could have
knocked me out of the window as easy
as puffing a pipe The bubble was
bu’sted, and here was I, disappointed be-

  “ Yes, he’s crazy—but harmless if
kept in a good humor I wonder I’m not
as bad as lie is, considering I’ve hashed
over this rot of his since 4 pm yesterday
—almost twelve hours”

  We talked a while and he told me his
companion had paresis, the fruit of a
wild young life He was about thirty-
five now, he said I became mighty sor-
ry for the fellow, and more so for the
mother to whom he was going—Wilson
said she lived in Toledo

  Pretty soon he rose and gathered up
their traps, for, as he said, they hadn’t
long to ride now, and he might as well
go out where Andrews was, to keep an
eye on him

  For a few minutes 1 watched the
lessening blackness without, and knew
that dawn was not far off, although it
was still dark in the fields and along the
sky-line

  Andrews looked in at the door

  “ Better accept, Mr Nichols,” said he
“ We’ll have a booming concern in a year
from now”

  I was sorry for the poor fellow, and
humored him, assuring him I would ac-
cept : and then, with another of his

laughs and a good-by, he dramatically
departed, leaving me to sadly contem-
plate the misguided actions of a man yet
young, bereft of what was, in all proba-
bility, a bright and enterprising mind—
a mother doomed to bitter disappoint-
ment in the hope of her boy’s achieve-
ments

  The train stopped The brakeman
called Wagerstown, and I knew the next
stop was mine—Goonburg As we start-
ed again I was wondering how many in
the other car were enlisted as poor An-
drews’s managers, for he had talked to
every one in my part of the car The
swinging-door flew open, admitting a red-r
faced conductor

  “ Have any of you gentlemen lost
money or valuables” asked he un-
steadily

  With one accord we all began to feel
for watches, jewelry, and money I felt
in my right-hand pocket, where should
be fifty dollars and some odd silver It
was empty

  I felt in the left-hand pocket, and
found I still had forty dollars in bills,
having luckily divided the bulk between
the pockets

  Several others reported money gone,
and some both money and watches

  “ It’s those scoundrels that I thought
were a lunatic and his keeper,” yelled
the conductor “ They picked my pocket
of all the cash fares, and left the train a
minute ago at Wagerstown”

  He pulled the emergency cord, and
when the train stopped we ran the quar-
ter-mile back to the station in a body

  But, as might have been expected, there
was no trace of the rogues And I’d lost
a lot of sentimentality and pity on one
of the wretches—as well as fifty dollars
of TJ S Treasury output

  We piled sorrowfully back on the
train, and in a few minutes I alighted at
my destination—pro tern—two miles far-
ther on

  For 'fear some one should desire some
sort of description of Goonburg, I give
my own impressions 1 arrived at 330
am, and may possibly be inclined to
give too much of a gray-carbon tone to
the picture Goonburg is situated some-
where on the fag-end of nowhere, not-
withstanding its being a junction for two
railroads and having a respectable frame

station and baggage-room—joint, of
course

  The only water-tight surmise I could
conjure up, explaining the beginning of
Goonburg, was that perhaps there yet re-
mained some odd lumber after building
the station, and shelters were built to
house the male incumbents at such times
when each left his favorite roost on the
station-platform

  The waiting-room, as I saw on enter-
ing, was ell-shaped, with the office and
ticket-window on the inner angle Two
doors led from the extremes of the ell,
one giving out on the main-line platform,
the other on the branch-line track A
light—the only one save those in the of-
fice—burned at the corner of the office
wall, but on the P T and Q side by the
ticket-window, leaving the branch wait-
ing-room in comparative gloom

  I deposited my effects on a seat, mean-
ing to try for some sleep, for I knew
of no train to Freeport before eight

  “ What is the quickest way I can take
to get to Freeport” I asked, going to
the window

  The night-operator yawned, and ap-
peared to consider

  “ Walk, I guess,” he said, and grinned
“No train till eight, and you can't reach
any trolley lines from here”

  So I went back and tried to sleep,
stretched out on that bench It was no
go, and I lit my pipe and strolled out
into the night When I got tired of
this, I sat on a ladder that lay against
the front of my waiting-room

  I had been out about half an hour
when I heard voices coming from down
the track toward Wagerstown Present-
ly the forms of two men carrying satch-
els loomed dimly through the early
light, and passed on into the station by
the other door They had not seen me,
because of a window that bulged out
from the office, deepening the shadow
where I sat

  The windows were open—it was July
—and I heard them set down their bags,
and one of them struck up a conversation
with the operator The voice sounded
reminiscent

  “ Pretty lonesome, staying here all
night, isn’t it ” The voice was casual

  “ Oh, sometimes yes, and sometimes
no” came the answer “ I go on at

eleven, and I’m relieved at seven in the
morning Always some chore to do,
though—settin’ signals, answerin’ the
key, and so on When I get a half-hour
or so I cat-nap or read a magazine
story”

  I looked slantwise through the win-
dow’, being curious about the
stranger’s voice, and saw the
operator leaning on the win-
dow-shelf, one hand' under
his chin, supported by his
elbow, the other hanging
down inside The strangers
I couldn’t see, for the
agent’s body blocked the
window

  “ Excursion up to Cedar
Point to-morrow, isn’t
there” remarked the strain
ger—again casually

  “ Sure w ant tickets ”
asked the key-tapper and
ticket-seller combined

 “Not now We may go
up in the morning, though

Many going ”

  “ Yep sold a hundred
and five to-day Guess
there’ll be more sold before
train-time”

  Just then a Smith & Wes-
son appeared - through the
window, and the stranger
made another casual remark

  “ Better pass out that
coin for the hundred and five
tickets,” lie said, adding,

“ and any more you may
have that isn’t tacked down

Needn’t trouble about re-
fusing, for there’s another
Gatling covering you,” and he nodded to-
ward the door where the other stranger
appeared, leaning through the window

  I looked, too, and saw Gus Wilson,
the lunatic-keeper I had no doubt then
who the other was—the man with the
reminiscent voice

  I had no weapon, and was casting
about for some way to aid the operator
The loss of that fifty dollars and all that
pity and sentiment still rankled deep

  Suddenly the agent dodged, and, as his
arm shot up, there came a flash and re-
port, followed by two more that sounded
as one Gus fell with a thud that made

me think he was dead, and the operator
staggered back into a chair, his revolver
falling to the floor The other man—
Andrews—slipped in through the win-
dow, and was picking up the agent’s gun
as I crept softly around toward the other
door

  When I got there I heard no move-
ment from Gus, so I peeped carefully
around the jamb He was unconscious—
dead, maybe—and his gun lay a foot in-
side the door

  I secured it quietly, and made sure Gus
had 110 more weapons, in case he should
come to I could hear Andrews, presi-
dent of the Andrews Decorating Com-
pany,'ransacking the cash drawer, and
then he moved over to the open safe

  Lights began to move in the houses
down the road, so help in some form
would doubtless arrive soon I crept
along the office wall to the ticket-window,

then, rising suddenly, I leveled the gun
at Andrews’s back

  “ Mr Andrews,” I said, “ you are
abroad a trifle early However, I al-
ways admired early risers, and you ap-
pear to be engaged in catching the pro-
verbial worm”

bat he sprang toward me Cool, wasn’t
he Well, I was too hasty for him, and
fired as his hand was diving under the
shelf, boring an awful hole in his arm
and plowing up that, good yellow-pine
floor deep enough to plant a potato in

  He sprang back with a cry, then stood,

I WAS TOO HASTY FOR HIM
AND FIRED AS HIS HAND WAS
DIVING UNDER THE SHELF”

  He whirled around and eyed the muz-
zle of Gus’s thirty-eight—well, not ex-
actly with eagerness, but still with self-
possession

  “ Well, I’ll be gashdoodled, he re-
marked, “ if here isn’t one of those deco-
rating gulls on top, after all And with
Gus’s gun, too, so I suppose the poor boy
is down and out”

  His eyes dropped to a point just inside
and under the shelf, and quick as an eye-

coolly stripping up his sleeve and wrap-
ping a handkerchief around the hole

  “ Good shot,” he vouchsafed, knotting
the bandage tightly “ Much obliged
for sparing my head-piece”

  “It is personal inconvenience I am
eliminating,” I returned, reaching over
and securing the two guns from the
cash drawer beneath the shelf “ No ob-
ligation due on your part,” I continued
“ Your errors, in not making certain that

crack your etiquette again, for I only hit
twice out of three where I aim, and the
next one may go higher and a little to the
left”

  He did as I ordered, but seemed hurt
that a former dupe had got the upper
hand of him

  “ Throw up your hands, durn ye”

two farmers with leveled guns

rejoined, “ and open that door Your

THE RAILROADS

THAT there has been a decided change
in the attitude of the public, especially
in the West, toward the railroads and the
questions arising out of railroad operation,
is frequently made evident nowadays

  The radical intolerance which character-
ized public sentiment two or three years
ago, is giving place to a rational desire to
see the relations of public and railroads put
on a better basis There is recognition of
the interdependence of the agencies'of trans-
portation and the communities they serve, and
the corollary of that interdependence is that
fair treatment on both sides is necessary,
says the Minneapolis Journal

  Evidence of this changed attitude is usu-
ally apparent when some great railroad
builder, like James J Hill, appears on the
platform at a public gathering Mr Hill,
busy man though he is readily responds to
such calls, and is usually received with the
Utmost enthusiasm His plea that the farm-
ers of the West ought to remain good
neighbors with the railroads was enthusias-
tically received The incident would have
been almost impossible at any farmers’ gath-
ering four or five years ago, although Mr
Hill himself, by reason of his intelligent
interest in farming and far-sighted under-
standing of its needs, has always been a
welcome guest at farmers’ gatherings

  Nor has the change been entirely on the
part of the public The railroads them-
selves have moved over to a position that
has made the public's altitude possible

they did it, and soon the promoter of-
financial ventures that made Rockefeller
and Carnegie look green was under guard
and on the way to the calaboose The
plucky operator was shot through the
shoulder, but a dash of water wakened
him

  He wanted to know how they caught
the fellows, and looked astonished when
they pointed me out, having actually be-
lieved me to be one of them

  Well, I got that fifty dollars back, and
the conductor got his cash fares All
the other passengers who could be found
were reimbursed

  Gus was dead—the agent’s bullet
struck him right between the eyes And
1 was glad when my train came, for I
had to repeat the telling of that “ Daring
Attempt to Hold Up a Night-Operator 
at least forty-nine times

MORE FRIENDLY

 They have abandoned such ancient and
revered principles of rate-making as that
expressed by “ All the traffic will bear”
They have come to a realization of the fact
that, deriving their rights to act as common
carriers from the public, they are charged
with certain duties toward the public that
created them

  The more enlightened and practical rail-
road men are sparing no effort to establish
better relations with the public at all points
of contact Station 'agents and trainmen
are instructed to be polite and accommoda-
ting to patrons

  They >re to exert themselves to the utmost
in this direction, for the great managers
realize that on such little things is public
sentiment founded

  Mr Harriman himself, before his death,
completely changed his attitude toward the
public, and toward the public’s humble serv-
ants, the reporters This change sprang from
a realization that the success of his plans
were impossible if he permitted the hostility
and prejudice against him, which his reti-
cence no less than his policies had aroused,
to continue and to grow

  The great railroad problems are largely
unsolved as yet We are again approaching
their serious consideration in Congress The
President has outlined far-reaching, con-
structive legislation In the changed attitude
of public and railroads toward each other,
there is promise of solutions of these prob-
lems with justice to both sides

VE are still teasing the brains of our readers,
and having our own teased in return, by the
clever puzzles that continue to come in We
thought we had worked the puzzle ground
pretty dry, but we were wrong Puzzles are
still to be had but, on the other hand, don't think that we are
getting so many that we can do without that good one that you
know Send it along We want it

           This month we are indebted for a couple of good ones
      to Mr F Einsel, of- Struthers Ohio

           There are two given spots, one on the extreme base of a
       4-foot drive-wheel the other on the extreme base of a pony
       truck-wheel which is iVI feet

           How much farther will the spot on the drive-wheel travel
       in 50 miles than the spot on the pony truck-wheel 

            An engine with,3-foot drive-wheels, hauling a heavy train,
       runs over 14 grade crossings in 10 miles Seven of the grade
       crossings are 20 feet wide, and the other 7 are 30 feet wide

       crossings and 37 times over each of the 30-foot crossings

           For another of the teasing variety we owe our thanks to
       Mr A L Monroe Indianapolis Indiana:

            A belt conductor delivered a cut of cars to the Sanky yard
       Yardmaster McGuffin told him to leave half of the cars
       he had and half a car over in track 8, and leave half the cars
       he had left and a half a car over in track 7 then leave half the
       cars he had left and half a car over in track 5 and put the rest

A GOOD NAME

CHAMP CLARK, Representative from
Missouri, dearly loves a good story
at the expense of the State of Arkansas

  “ One day,” said Mr Clark, in the course
of a political conversation, and branching
off from the main subject, “as a train from
the East pulled up at the dinky little sta-
tion of a most depressing town in the fever
and ague district of Arkansas, a passen-
ger, thrusting his head out of the car-win-
dovv, demanded in bitter tones of a dejected
looking citizen who' was leaning against the
station door:

in a melancholy voice, ‘ let it go at that’ ”—

PERSISTENT GRATITUDE

SMITH, the railroad agent at a suburban
station, saved the life of a dignified
gentleman waiting for a train, by pulling

him from in front of a through train on
another track

  The dignified gentleman lost all his dig-
nity for the moment and was much con-
fused, but not so much as to forget that
something was due to the agent Follow-
ing a grateful impulse, lie thrust his hand
into his pocket, and, drawing it forth, ex-
claimed :

  “Man, you’ve saved my life here's half
a dollar”

  “ Oh, I never take payment for a thing
like that,” answered Smith, as he turned
to attend to the duties of the moment

life H«ive a cigar, anyway”—Harper's

NON-COMMITTAL

“T HAD always thought the public serv-
-I- ants of my own cit3r were the fresh-

a recent experience in Kansas City has led
to a revision of that notion

  “ One afternoon I dashed into a railway
station of that town with just half a min-
ute to buy my ticket and enter a train for
Chicago I dashed through the first gate,
and, pointing to a certain train, asked hur-
riedly of the gateman:

  “‘Is that my train’

exasperating deliberation ‘ May be it is,
but the cars have the company’s name on

SHORTLY after a new administration

A LINE OF TALK

ACCORDING to the Philadelphia Ledger,
- two telephone girls were talking over
the wire The subject was a lawn party,
which was to take place the next day Both
were discussing what they should wear, and
after five minutes had come to no decision

  In the midst of this important conversa-
tion a masculine voice interrupted, asking
humbly what number he had The lack of
any reply did not squelch the inquirer, for he
asked again for the number

  One of the girls became indignant, and
scornfully asked:

  “ What line do you think you are on,
anyhow  ”

  “Well,” said the man, “I am not sure,
but judging from what I have heard I should
say I was on a clothes-line”—Express Ga-

CAR AHEAD

ONE cold, winter morning a man of tall
and angular build was walking down
a steep hill at a quick pace A piece of ice
under the snow caused him to lose control
of 'his feet He began to slide and was
unable to stop

  At a crossing half-way down he encoun-
tered a large heavy woman The meeting
was sudden, and before either realized it
a collision ensued and both were sliding
down hill, the thin man underneath, the
fat woman on top

  When the bottom was reached and the
woman was trying to recover her breath
and her feet, these faint words were borne
to her ear:

  “ Pardon me, madam, but you will have

CLASSICAL PAINTINGS

“ A CLASSICAL education,” said the en-
gineer, who could read Latin when
lie was eight years old and had mastered

Hebrew before he was ten, “ should be
given to every boy, no matter what his sur-
roundings are

  “ For instance, a sign-painter should re-
ceive a classical education He has often
to do with subjects taken from the classics,
and if ignorant of classical history, then
his value is so much the less

  “ I was once connected with a railroad
company which had a number of barges
and the first one was named Ajax After
a short time we built another barge and
we decided to have it also named Ajax

  “ 1 sent for our painter and told him we
would have a series of these boats and
would give the same name to all

  “ ‘ Did you say you was going to have a
series of them Ajaxes’ he asked

   “ ‘ Yes’

  “ A few days after we went to look at the
barge and he had painted on it ‘ Bjax’ The
next vessel he named ‘ Cjax,’’ and then came
and asked us what the tom-fool words
meant”—San Francisco Call

DOGS AM DOGS

IKE FLANNERY, the express-agent
whose experience with pigs and the
multiplication table are recited in “ Pigs
Is Pigs,” is not the only humble agent to
become entangled in the complexities of
live-stock transportation

  The prosy reports of the Interstate Com-
merce Commission hint at a story with
somewhat similar possibilities:

  The agent of a shipper not knowing the
value of a dog to be sent by express, never-
theless named a valuation of $500 and the
resulting charges to destination amounted
to $45 The dog was actually worth $15,
and at this valuation the express charges
would have been $8 The consignee de-
clined to accept delivery and pay the
charges demanded Upon inquiry whether
charges may be collected 011 the basis of the
actual value of the dog it was held that the
shipper is responsible for the act of his
agent, and that the charges at the valuation
given must be collected

 What, we wonder, has become of the
dog during the time that this appeal has
been traveling to the Interstate Commerce
Commission 

 Has some humble Mike Flannery been
buying it biscuits out of his slender wages
And if the owner still refuses to pay $45
charges 011 a $15 dog, what will become
of the dog Under what account could
his up-keep be entered

  No struggling express company can af-
ford to keep a dog: that is a luxury, doubt-
less, its officers will decide to leave to

CHAPTER XXI
An Old Friend

OME fifteen minutes afterward
  the door of the back room
  opened and Mr Peter Marsh-
  field stalked into its reeking
  atmosphere The Wall Street
  magnate was in no good hu-
  mor, and his gaze traveled
  from his son to his son’s friend in cold
  displeasure

  “ There are four saloons on this cor-
ner,” he remarked “ I went to the other
three first, and I am not as fond of sa-
loons as you two seem to be”

  David laid his hand on the great man’s
shoulder with the confidence of a deep,
if reserved, affection “ 1 knew you
would come,” he said

  Marshfield’s answer was a scarcely
articulate grunt “ Of course I came
I’m your father, ain’t I Now, what’s
all this about” Striding over to a
table, he laid his stick on it and faced
us like a judge about to deliver sen-
tence “ So you’re here, Paget Still
hunting villains, or what”

  I had no answer ready for the rough
sneer The short space we had waited
for him I had employed in racing over
to my apartments David had been a
true prophet the black book I had
snatched from Cagno’s pocket, the key
to the Abyssinian papers, was gone

  There was no time to listen to the con-
fused explanations of the doorman The
book had been taken from my desk One
glance told me that, and then I dashed
back to the saloon Now I stood panting

 and silent, wondering how on earth old
 Marshfield was to help us David an-
 swered for me

   “ Run to earth,” said he, a note of
 triumph in the low voice “ Steve told
 you a story this morning you wouldn’t
 listen to, father It was true, just the
 same, and you’ve got to listen to me now”

   “ That’s what I came here for,” re-
 torted Marshfield “What is it”
 Leaning against the table, his hands
 behind his back, he heard his son through
 without a word or a gesture of surprise
 Only when I laid the map and the deeds
 before him did he move Then he took
 his glasses from his pocket, placed them
 deliberately on his nose, and leaned
 down to examine the booty Even then
 his face revealed nothing as he studied
 the papers one after the other When
 he had finished, he_straightened up, re-
 placed the glasses in his pocket, antf-
 turned to me

   “ All of us make mistakes,” he said

 “ I made one this morning I was busy,
 and you irritated me At the time, I re-
 member, I thought it was all moonshine
 Of course, I might have known that if
 Rocca had had the papers, he would have
 come up with them before Still, they
 are not much good without the key, and
 Rocca’s got that, you say”

   “Confound the key!” I broke out

 “ He’s got Miss Bigontina! ”

   “ So I understand” Old Marshfield
 raised his hand'to stroke his mustache
 with a hesitation that sat strangely on
 him “ I suppose you are in love with
 her, and you don’t like the idea We
 might try a trade—the papers for the

girl I dare say you’d think it a good
one”

  David shot one quick glance at me

  “ How do you propose to find the man
to make the trade with ” he asked “ We
can’t take the police to the house with-
out killing Miss Bigontina How are
you going to see Rocca”

  His father reached behind him for his
stick “ By sending in my card,” he an-
swered “ That’s one way of seeing peo-
ple  and if I do see him, I’ll get the girl
•—but I’m not so sure he will get these
papers”

  I was too amazed to question how
Truly I had not known David’s father
well The man who would not even lis-
ten to me when I intruded upon him in
his office was now, of his own accord,
about to venture alone where no other
man in the city, knowing what he knew,
would have dared to go

  It was quite true that he was safer
than any other man would have been
Peter Marshfield was too big a figure in
America to be attacked with impunity,
and in this case he was Rocca’s last hope
for the wealth he had snatched at But
it takes nerve to remember such things
when one is defenseless in the castle of
one’s enemies

  Unbounded admiration for the stern
fighter in front of me was the one defi-
nite thought in my brain as we roiled
away from the saloon in the cab The
cabman had agreed to take us as near as
he dared to the house From there the
banker would have to trust to his own
resources They had never failed him
yet as my gaze drank in the strength
of the jaw and mouth, the heavy fore-
head, -and deep-set eyes, I did not be-
lieve that they would fail him now

  The cab rolled down Fifth Avenue
and into Washington Square under the
white arch When I first passed it that
day, on my way to Maria, the morning sun
had been high above it Now the white
marble was bathed in the glory of the
flaming west already the memorial cross
had sprung into light over the bare trees
and crowded pavements The day was
dying, the longest I have ever lived
With unspoken thankfulness that it was
over at last, I leaned forward to see its
farewell

  The cab stopped with an abruptness

that flung me onto the knees of the
startled banker The door was wrenched
open, a man shot in upon us, slammed
the door behind him, and cried out to the
driver : “ Go on ! Go on ! ” The next
instant David and I held him, gagged
and helpless, at our feet

  “ What the deuce—” my friend began
when I knocked his hand from the fel-
low’s mouth It was the violinist of the
Auvergne, and he was struggling hard
to speak

  “ I have come back,” he spluttered in
breathless, foreign English, as I helped
him to the few inches by my side on the
narrow forward seat “ I have come
back to help you I ran before, but I
am no coward- I will fight”

  “Good for you, and how” David
spoke in light-hearted joy of battle as
he faced our unexpected ally “ Whom
are you going to fight, my friend”

  “ I fight them all They have been
worse to me than to you Why should
I leave you to fight, then”

  “ Search me,” returned young Marsh-
field “ But you didn’t come in here as
if you were spoiling for a fight”

   The violinist spoke with inborn dignit)'
“ I fight, sir,” he said  “ but I fight
with my head as well as' my hands I
wish to aid Mr Paget, who has much
befriended me, not betray him There-
fore, I waste no time where spies may
watch”

  “ You are wise as well as brave,” I put
in, in haste to intercept whatever ill-
judged jest David may have meditated
“ But what brings you back You told
me that you were a doomed man in New
York”

  “ I met Rosa,” he answered “ I met
her as I went to take my train I knew
her years ago, when we were both young

  “ We talked, and she told me things
that I did not know—that it was the Si-
gnorina Bigontina that they pursue, that
Rocca himself may be here, that now is
my time to strike for the daughter of the
dead Signor Bigontina, the man who
helped me, to strike at the man who mur-
dered my brother I come to fight, sir”
“ Well, you’ve come to the right
shop!” cried David, startled out of his
humor by the intensity of the man’s emo-
tion 11 At least you have, if this cab-
man is telling the truth”

  “ Where are you going”

  The violinist leaned forward, his eyes
bright with the fire I had seen in them
when music carried him beyond himself

  “To Jefferson Street—149 Jefferson
Street at least, my father is We’re—
now what's the matter  ”

  “ It is the house—I have heard them
talk of it Ah, do you think I sang with
my eyes and ears shut in the Auvergne
all these years—I, who knew their devil-
try They did not know me—only
Ghedina—and him I never thought to
see again So I watched and listened and
learned”

  “ What did you learn”'

  Old Marshfield spoke as he might have
spoken to a clerk in his office He was
going to risk his life in that house, but
there was no quaver of fear in the per-
emptory demand for information

  “It is their most secret place, sir
They have several in'the city, but this is
their most secret I have known of many
who went there, but never of any who
came away”

  “ You will know of one soon,” re-
turned Mr Marshfield as he settled back
into his seat “ Is that all ”

  “ No, sir I have investigated myself
—quietly, you understand—for always I
have dreamed of my revenge It is not
all The house is on the heights, the
water is below : but from the house to
the water there is an alley running down
to a dock”

  He paused for a second, as though to
give due weight to his next words

  “ A few days ago a steamer came to
that dock It is a fruit steamer, the
Cavour, from Palermo It is one of
Rocca’s There are lumber and coal-
yards near that dock  the Cavour is sup-
posed to carry fruit Why is she there ”
“ Lemons,” grunted David “ By
Jove, more lemons! ” But his father and
I sat silent

  “It is quite plain,” Marshfield spoke
at length with cold precision “ Lie in-
tends to take the girl away on the
steamer We could have the house and
the boat searched We might find some-
thing but it would not please you, Ste-
phen, if you really care for her I will
try him with these papers There is the
chance that lie will bite if he does not,
we will try something else”

  He put the cigar back in his mouth
as though the last word had been said,
smoking steadily on as we drove toward
the bridge There were a thousand ques-
tions we might have asked, a thousand
things that I would have been eager to
learn at another time Now, with all
my life staked on one wild throw, I had
no interest in the shape of the dice

  The violinist’s long fingers twined
nervously together, and his lean face wa
blazing with the thirst for vengeance
but he said nothing In absolute silence
the four of us, crowded in the cab, jolt-
ed onward through the swarming streets

  Only when we were high above the
river, in the center of the bridge, the
musician's hand closed on my arm
“Look!” he breathed “It is the Ca-
vour”

  His arm pointed downward, through
the open window of the cab, to the
Brooklyn water-front A tramp steamer
lay at a pier below us, a thin trail of
smoke rising from her funnel into the
softness of the coming night On the
heights above, clear against the evening
sky, stretched a row of commonplace
brownstone houses In one of them, or
in that steamer, was Maria Bigontina
The cab rolled on over the bridge as we
peered through the narrbw window until
houses and steamer were shut from our
sight

  A minute later we came to a halt, and
the driver appeared at the window

  “ This is near enough,” he said “Any-
body can show you how to get to Jeffer-
son Street I'm not going there, I can
tell, you”

  Peter Marshfield stepped heavily down
to the sidewalk For a brief second he
stood motionless, then turned with out-
stretched hand:

  “ Good-by, Dave,” he said “ Good-
by, Steve I’ll do the best I can for
you” He started across the street, and
a passing trolley-car hid him from our
sight

CHAPTER XXII
In an Hour or Not at All

“ CO now you comprehend, gentlemen,
 why every foe of Rocca’s is a
friend of mine” The musician’s story
180

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

was ended—a story of cold-blooded vil-
lainy, persecution, and suffering into
which it is not necessary to enter again
He had told it to us in the cheap res-
taurant outside of which the cabman had
stopped

  Nothing short of that tragedy of blood
could have held our attention as we sat
there, waiting, hearing in every sound the
heavy tread of the banker, hoping for
his return before he had even had the
time to meet his peril But the musi-
cian had held us Fortune had brought
him and his brother, years before, to Pa-
lermo, to be befriended there by the dead
Luigi Bigontina For a while the fates
smiled, and then came the crash

  Somehow, his brother had permitted
himself to be swept into the net of the
Mafia—there was at times something to
be said in its favor, but not as Rocca
ruled it, and Rocca ruled it absolutely
When the boy learned what was expect-
ed of him, he mutinied And to mutiny
against the Mafia there is but one end

  In trying to save his brother, the vio-
linist had drawn on his own head the
same doom He had escaped, it is true,
but for the moment only At the Au-
vergne, with his soul eaten with ungrati-
fied vengeance, he had fiddled and lis-
tened

  “ I was as safe there as anywhere,”
he said  “ and a man must live, gentle-
men I had only my violin”

  The coming of Ghedina had thrown
him into a panic, only too well justified,
but his conversation with Rosa, the old
servant of the Bigontinas, had fired all
his lust for revenge As he told us in
the cab, he had come back to fight

  So Rocca was head of the Mafia, and
it was the Mafia we had been fighting
It was hardly a surprise, but it was none
the less appalling I knew something of
Sicily, and how helplessly it lay in the
grasp of its secret tyrant Even if
Marshfield returned in triumph with
Maria Bigontina herself, it would not be
victory The shadow would be upon our
lives until the end, as it was upon the
musician—and the end was almost in-
evitable It was he who voiced my
thought:

  “ If Rocca gets back to Sicily, we are
as good as dead No one can touch him
there”

  “ He won’t get back,” growled David
between clinched teeth, and at that
moment the door of the restaurant
opened Peter Marshfield had returned
—and returned alone He walked stead-
ily up to us and sat down, his face as
rigid as a bronze cast

  “ Get me something to drink,” he or-
dered “ I think I need it”

  “ Where—” I broke out but Marsh-
field waved his hand impatiently

  “ Wait You might as well hear this
from the beginning” And it was from
the beginning that he told it to us, omit-
ting nothing, dwelling on nothing, speak-
ing as though he were expounding a
problem of finance

   When he left us, he had found his way
without difficulty to Jefferson Street It
was_a quiet Brooklyn street, lined with
houses of the better sort, and 149 was
like its neighbors, substantial, unpreten-
tious, uninteresting He walked up the
steps of the stoop and rang He waited
for an answer

  There was no answer, and again he
rang Still there was no answer Then
Marshfield pressed his finger against the
button and held it there, while the bell
clamored its summons throughout the
house and out into the street

  As usual, Marshfield had calculated
accurately Visitors were unwelcome at
149 Jefferson Street but an obstinate
old gentleman attracting the attention of
the entire neighborhood by his persistent
demand for admission was more so In
an instant a key turned, the door was
opened on the chain, and a surly face
peered out

  “What you want” demanded its in-
hospitable owner

  “ I want to see Mr Rocca,” returned
Marshfield

  “ Not here,” and the man attempted
to slam the door He succeeded only in
closing it upon the broad sole of Marsh-
field’s shoe

   “ Yes, he is,” said that gentleman “ I
-know better Give him this pard Look
sharp now,” for the fellow was hesita-
ting, perplexed by the visitor’s assurance
“ Look sharp, or it will be the worse for
you when Rocca hears of it”

  I suppose it was the air which years
of unquestioned authority bestow that
overawed the man Muttering something

about inquiring within, he departed with
the card, leaving Marshfield with his
foot in the crack of the door, the victor
in the first skirmish In a minute or two
the man returned, transformed into an
obsequious servant

   “ Will the gentleman please to enter ”
he asked, swinging wide the guardian
door	

   He escorted Marshfield across the hall
to a small reception-room, flung open the
door for him, and departed In the cen-
ter of the room, his hands behind his
back and a forbidding smile on his heavy
lips, was Signor Rocca

  “ Good evening, Mr Marshfield I
had hardly expected this honor”

   “ I had hardly expected to pay it,” re-
turned Marshfield, unruffled  “ but busi-
ness is business, Mr Rocca”

   “ Quite so, and how did you know that
I was here”

  “It is my business to know many
things, for instance ”—Marshfield delib-
erately drew up a chair and sat down—
“ for instance, I know why you did not
produce the evidence I demanded”

   Rocca’s lips tightened and his eyes nar-
rowed “ Indeed, and why was that ”

  “ For the good reason that you did
not have it I have” Rocca stepped
between Marshfield and the door, but the
banker merely followed him with his
eyes “ I didn’t bring it with me, Mr
Rocca I was not born yesterday”

  The Italian laughed shortly: “You
seem rather suspicious, Mr Marshfield
Are you in the habit of doing business
with pickpockets”

  “ Sometimes,” answered Marshfield,
and I can picture the figure of the grim
old man sitting quietly in the chair, ga-
zing straight into the scoundrel’s eyes

  Rocca’s face darkened at the thrust,
and he frowned down on his visitor

“ Did you come here to insult me, Mr
Marshfield That is likely to be a dan-
gerous amusement Also, I may remind
you that you do not own this evidence
of which you speak”

   “ Bosh ! ” The banker crossed his legs,
settling back comfortably in his chair as
though for a prolonged session “ Bosh!
You don’t own it, either The differ-
ence is that I have it and you haven’t
That’s the difference the question is,
what are we going to do”

  “ I see,” Rocca’s face cleared “You
come to propose what you call a deal”

  “ I did not come for the pleasure of
your society,” retorted Marshfield, and
for a while there was silence in the lit-
tle reception-room

   “ Well,” said Rocca at length, and he
walked carelessly away from the door,
“what do you propose You have seen
the evidence is it satisfactory”

  “ Quite There :s only one thing
lacking”

   “ Ah, and what is that  ”

  “ The key”

  “ Oh! ” Rocca’s face was fairly
wreathed in smiles as he beamed down
on his visitor “ Oh, you have found
that out The papers aren’t much with-
out that, are they”

   “ No Just a little more than the key
without the papers” For a minute the
two men eyed each other before the bank-
er went calmly on: “ Under the circum-
stances, I think we might as well go back
to where we began

   “ You see, we really have to give this
man Paget something He knows too
much not to I don’t care about giving
him money, so we had better give him
the girl”

  The assured impudence of the sugges-
tion was too much even for Rocca’s com-
posure He started forward with an ugly
scowl and raised voice:

  “What girl What talk is this
Paget—” He controlled himself with
an effort in front of the chair where
the banker sat impassive “You are
crazy, Mr Marshfield,” he ended with
a belated attempt at a sneer

   “ Oh, no, merely prudent As you re-,
marked, neither you nor I own these pa-
pers, and Paget knows it It would be
awkward if he talked Give him the girl
and he won’t It’s all quite simple, if
you would scowl less and think more”
Rocca’s face was black, and his fists
clenched, but the outbreak did not come
Instead, he glared impotently at his vis-
itor in a tumult of indecision that choked
his rage Gold was the god he wor-
shiped, and Marshfield held it out to
him But, on the other hand, there was
Maria Surely there was some way to
win and keep both—only, at the minute,
he could not see it

  Peter Marshfield read the man as

plainly as he might have the newspaper
head-lines that told of his latest finan-
cial coup, but he said nothing Only he
swung his foot idly and waited, his gray
eyes relentlessly tearing the mask from
the scoundrel before him

  The Italian made up his mind at last
With a forced laugh, he turned away
from the banker to lean with outstretched
hand against the wall, close to the door

  “ You are crazy,” he sneered “ I
know of no girl”

  “Nor I of any papers” Marshfield
rose quickly to his feet in stern com-
mand “ Don’t ring that bell, Mr Roc-
ca You don’t dare touch me”

  And Rocca did not His audacious
eyes met Marshfield’s unflinchingly, but
his hand did not press the hidden signal
whose existence the banker had divined
It still lingered there, however, when he
snarled: “And why not”

  “ It wouldn’t pay,” said Marshfield
quietly “ You would lose your Abys-
sinian mine, and you would get the whole
United States at your heels Stephen
Paget is an unknown newspaper man,
Mr Rocca He may-disappear with
every girl he ever knew, and it is no one’s
business But I—well, there are men
who know where I have gone, and I am
Peter Marshfield”

  Rocca’s hand crept slowly downward
to his side It was perfectly true If
he had touched Marshfield, he would
have been a hunted man all the rest of
his life It was not worth it The bank-
er nodded his head in satisfaction as he
watched '

  “ That is better now, do you think
you could find this girl if I should sud-
denly discover the papers After that,
we might continue the negotiations you
were kind enough to begin with me a
few days ago”

  “ You take a deal of interest in this
girl” replied the Italian “ What is it
to you where she is”

  “ I thought I had told you once,” said
Marshfield wearily “ Paget is not to
talk Now, are you going to give her
to me or not”

  Rocca did not answer at once He
was thinking hard, his keen mind striving
to wrench some advantage from this new
situation Involuntarily, he stepped
across the room to a side window and

looked out Marshfield's tireless, per-
sistent eyes followed, looking out too

  Beneath the window the ground fell
abruptly away, a steep hill tumbling
down to the yards of the river-front
Through the dusk shone the lights of a
steamer, and a smudge of rising smoke
was dimly outlined against the sky

  Rocca turned sharply on his heel “ In
an hour,” he said, “ if you bring me the
papers, I will give you Maria Bigontina
She is not here, but doubtless my friends
will oblige me by bringing her But
they will bring her nowhere but here
therefore, you must bring the papers
here”

  “ I am here already,” answered Marsh-
field “ One hour is as good as another
Give me the girl You have the key al-
ready the rest you can have for the ask-
ing at my office”

  The Italian shook his head “ Pos-
sibly  I run no chances Bring me the
papers in an hour, and come alone Be-
sides, Marie is not here”

  “ Oh, rot! ” began Marshfield  but
Rocca interrupted him with a loud call:
“ Giuseppe, the door for this gentleman
In an hour, Mr Marshfield, or not at all
—it is my last word”

  The burly figure of the doorkeeper
loomed beside my friend’s father His
errand was over Rocca bowed farewell
to him, and the door of 149 Jefferson
Street was locked behind him’

CHAPTER XXIII
Drawing the Net

AS he finished his narrative, Mr

      Marshfield reached across the table
of the little restaurant “ Give me those
papers, Steve,” he said The map and
the deed were in his hands before I
grasped the meaning of his request

  “You’re not going back!” I gasped
“ There’s no faith in the man If you
had had these things the other time, you
would never have got away”

  Old Marshfield smiled grimly “ Quite
right, Stephen, I never would have
Nevertheless, I am going back Excuse
me a minute” He stalked to the rear
of the room, and we saw him busy in a
telephone-booth

  “ He’s got something up his sleeve,”
THE SPIDER OF PALERMO

muttered David, as we watched the gray
head bending over the instrument “ I
wonder what the dickens it is”

  “ There’s no faith in Rocca,” I re-
peated “ We can’t let him go back We
oughtn’t to have let him go at all

  “ Don’t worry about the governor,”
retorted Dave “ He knows what he’s
up against I wish we knew as well”
His father may have known, but he
was in no hurry to inform us When he
returned he seated himself again at the
table, laying his watch before him with-
out a word Once I opened my mouth
to speak, but closed it again The least
I could do in gratitude was to respect his
silence

  The strain told, however It seemed
as though I could not keep my seat, could
not maintain that horrible silence another
second, when the door of the restaurant
opened to admit three men They were
all big, inclined to corpulence, but still
strong and active and endowed with ob-
vious aggressiveness After one quick
glance about the room, one of them
stepped up to us

  “ This is very strange, Mr Marsh-
field,” he began, but the banker cut him
short

  “ You ought to be used to strange
things, inspector We have been wait-
ing for you”

  “ I came quickly enough,” said the
other, and I recognized the gruff tones
at once as those of Inspector McCor-
mick, the head of the detective bu-
reau “ Lucky I was in my office It’s
not every policeman who would chase
over the city for a telephone message”
“ It wasn’t every policeman I was tele-
phoning to,” retorted Marshfield “ Did
you do as I asked  ”

  “Of course,” snapped the other “ I
know my job But what are we up to
now  ”

  “ Waiting, answered Marshfield “If
you have those guns I asked for, you
might -iiand them over to my son and
Mr Paget here”

  McCormick regarded us doubtfully
“ This is very unusual, Mr Marshfield,
he said “ What is this affair ”

  “ Ours,” said the banker curtly “ I
don’t ask many favors, McCormick, but
I ask this You wait here half an hour
If I'm not back by then, go round to 149

Jefferson Street and break the place
open Until then, it is our affair after
that, do what you like You know me
will you do it  ”

   “ I don’t like it, Mr Marshfield—”

   “ Neither do I,” interrupted the bank-
er, rising to his feet “ but it’s got to be
done Come along, you three”

   Clutching the revolvers the policeman
reluctantly handed to us, we followed
him to the street in a daze There he
halted to give us our instructions:

  “ You three go down to the pier by
the steamer, and wait in the alley this
fellow told us of in the cab If anybody
comes along, stop him I fancy myself
it will be Rocca, and in a hurry If it
is, make him take you to the girl The
police will be round in the neighborhood
somewhere if you need them but I pre-
fer to trust you Somebody may have to
think, you know Good-by”

  He was a rod or two up the street
when David sprang after him and
grasped him by the sleeve

  “ By Heaven, you sha’n’t go! ” he
cried hoarsely “ Give me those papers,
and let me take them”

  Wrenching himself free, Peter Marsh-
field wheeled roughly upon his son
“ Do as you’re told,” he growled “ Go
fight with your hands, and let me fight
with my head”

  Turning his back upon us, he strode
up the street I heard David give a
choking little gasp, and there was a
queer lump in my own throat but it was
the violinist who spoke:

  “ He is a brave gentleman Come, I
will show you the alley”

  By a labyrinth of devious byways, he
brought us out at length upon the river,
close to the uncovered dock where lay
the fruit steamer It was quite dark
now, and, as far as we could tell, there
was no one about to observe us as we
clung to the shadow of a high fence

  Far above us many lights marked the
row of quiet houses on the heights Be-
tween their solid respectability and this
obscure section of the city’s water-front,
there seemed no possible connection Yet
there was one The fence on our left
stopped suddenly, to begin again a pace
or two beyond

  The gap between was the mouth of the
alley which the musician had discovered
184

THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE

in his midnight prowlings about the for-
tress of his unsuspecting enemies We
dived into it, and were swallowed at once
in the dense shadow

  It was too dark to do more than inch
our way slowly forward We felt the
ground rise sharply under our feet, and
knew that we were climbing toward the
house, but of what lay on either side
we could form no idea The alley was
narrow, however When we halted well
up the slope, there was no chance for any
one to pass us One exit from 149 Jef-
ferson Street was effectually barred

  But what was happening at the en-
trance In the darkness I still saw Peter
Marshfield’s broad back as he swung
away from us to he knew not what
There was no faith in Rocca and now
he had the papers with him There was
no faidi in Rocca! How many times I
said that to myself I do not know I
was still repeating it when the words
were driven from my head

  Through the blackness above a man
was coming down to us—-coming as fast
as the steep slope and slippery path per-
mitted We heard his heavy footsteps,
and then a dark form shot in front of
us I dived at his knees as he came,
struck them with my shoulder, and,
with my arms twined about his legs,
brought him to the ground, a helpless
mass While I clung to him, blindly
obeying old Marshfield’s instructions to
stop whoever came from the house, David
struck a match in the shelter of his
hands

  “ By all that’s holy, it is Rocca! ” he
cried, holding the little flame close to
the fallen man’s face “ Get up, you! ”

  Grasping the Italian by the collar, he
dragged him to his feet, still dazed by
the violence of his fall “ Where is
she” he snarled “Speak, or I’ll—”
The threat was the more significant for
its not being finished, but Rocca could
only gasp for breath

  “ She’s on the steamer,” I breathed in
his ear, my very hope warning me to
caution “ Your father guessed it Roc-
ca’s got the papers, and he’s trying to
get off himself”

  “You’re right But what then”

  “ This” The time had come for the
last chance, the last charge of the old
guard that would win or lose it all I

slipped my arm part way through Roc-
ca’s, and the muzzle of Inspector Mc-
Cormick’s revolver pressed agaTnst the
villain’s side “ You feel that, Mr
Rocca That’s a pistol March!”

  The Italian did not hesitate He had
seen too many men killed in his life to
count on my possible reluctance to shoot
down a man in cold blood And my
blood was not cold At that moment I
believe I-would have killed him with as
clear a conscience as ever a soldier
fought the battles of his country For
tunately for my future peace of mind, it
was not necessary

  We emerged from the alley, a little

•	knot of men shutting in our captive, the
revolver pressed with convincing force
against his side Straight across the
street, to the pier, and up the gangplank
we walked to the deck of the steamer
There we stopped to confront as bewil-
dered a gang of seafaring ruffians as it
has ever been my fortune to behold

   “ Order her up,” I whispered, and the
revolver forced its way still farther into
the folds of his coat

   On the face he turned to me was writ-
ten all the black evil of the man
“ You,” he began, but the steel was
jammed against his side and he was si-
lent

  “Order her up!” I repeated “And
before I count five One—two—three—”

  “ Bring the signorina on deck” The
voice was thin and broken, like the ring
of cracked crockery It was a different
man that David and I held between us
from the suave, self-confident host who
had entertained us at luncheon ’that
morning

  Changed though he was, the man’s
power was still unbroken At the order,
one of the least ruffianly of the crew be-
fore us disappeared in the companion-
way the others remained staring at us
in undisguised astonishment

   They could not see the revolver, they
did not know who we were, and they
must long since have grown accustomed
to the unexpected but certainly they had
been prepared for no such scene as this
Standing by the other side of Rocca,
David took advantage of the pause to
slip his hand unobtrusively into the
scoundrel's pocket He drew out a bun-
dle of papers and stuffed them into his

own coat Then we stood, motionless,
waiting

  She came at last At sight of the frail
face, even whiter now and more drawn
than when it had first glorified the chill
desolation of Washington Square, the re-
volver in my hand shook It was Rocca
who had done this, and his life was mine,
to take or give I sometimes wonder how
it was that my finger lay quiet on the
trigger

  For a second she stood bewildered at
the change of scene  then, catching sight
of the four men who watched her, she
sprang back:

  “ No, no! ” And her hands were flung
out as though to blot us from her sight
“ Not you again ! ”

  The cry struck into my heart In the
joy of battle, for her sake I had for-
gotten that it was as Rocca’s friend she
had last seen me, that it was as Rocca’s
friend she now saw me standing by his
side on the deck of his steamer Even
with death before his eyes, the keen Ital-
ian grasped something of the situation
The mud-bespattered visage he turned
to me bore a hideous leer

  “ You see your welcome,” he jeered,
but the next instant his face blanched at
the sudden stab of the revolver It was
not now as it had been in Eleventh Street
I must play the brute a minute longer
then the nightmare w'ould be at an end

  “ Come here,” I cried out harshly to
the girl “ Come here, or Pietro dies! ”
Her hands dropped, and she stared at
me with wide, terror-stricken eyes She
could not reason that it was an empty
threat Horror had been heaped too
heavily upon her for her to question
new disaster

  Slowly, reluctantly, as though drawn
by an irresistible magnet, she crept across
the deck Nearer and nearer she came,
until my breath stopped in the suspense
of the final moment

  My eye measured the distance she
was within my reach The revolver was
still against Rocca’s side, when my left
arm shot out and grasped her

  “ Move, and you’re dead, Rocca! ”

  My shout of triumph rang through
the night as I sprang backward toward
the gangplank, Maria Bigontina within
the circle of my arm The wavering aim
of my weapon mattered nothing planted

like a rock before us stood David Marsh-
field, his leveled revolver steady in front
of him

  How we staggered down that gang-
plank I do not know—nor did I ever
know Only I remember that, as I stood
upon the dock, I saw David backing
slowly down, and the light from the
lamps of the deck shone upon the steel
in his hand

   From the darkness of the alley behind
us came the shrill whistle of a police
signal, the sound of running men, and
the roar of Inspector McCormick’s com-
mand : “On the steamer, men! They’re
on the steamer ! ”

  Then chaos was let loose Above the
inferno of Italian shouts and oaths rose
Rocca’s order: “Down with that gang-
plank! Cast off! Full speed ahead! ”

  The gangplank crashed down by our
feet, the end of a heavy hawser splashed
into the water the steamer had started
on her way to Sicily and safety But,
while only a foot or two separated her
from the dock, the figure of a slender
man shot abruptly into the center of the
ring about Rocca The light fell full
upon his face, and we saw that it was
Ghedina

   “ Who are you,” he screamed, “ to give
us orders Clumsy fool! You betray
us but once ! ”

  He flung himself straight at his de-
feated chief There was the flash of
steel and the dark form of a man falling
The police found Rocca afterward—
flat on his back on the deck of his fruit-
steamer, his unseeing eyes turned up to
the stars, a knife thrust downward
through his throat, under the protruding,
sensual jaw

   So die many of the chiefs of the Mafia,
I am told Unquestioned despots while
they reign, death is the penalty they {)ay
for failure

  Ghedina’s triumph was short - lived
While we stood aghast at the tragedy be-
fore the Cavour could gather way, a po-
lice-boat dashed out from the shadows
of the neighboring pier There was a
sharp command, the crack of a pistol,
and then we saw men swarming over the
low sides of the fruiter Old Peter
Marshfield had fought with his head to
good purpose
186

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  The pier was filled with policemen
now, but I did not notice them A hand
fell on my shoulder, and I turned to find
him panting beside me

  “ Thank Heaven ! ” I gasped “ You’re
safe! ” But not even to shake hands
with him would I release my arms from
the prize they clutched so fiercely

  “ Safe! Of course I’m safe They
grabbed the papers and gagged me—
that’s what I expected You got her, I
see : and now I suppose you will think
yourself happy”

  “ I suppose so—I—you—I want to
thank—” The silly words stuck in my
throat as I looked from the gray-haired
banker who had wrought this miracle
into eyes that glowed up at me from
a white face “ Will I  ” 1 asked ab-
ruptly

  For a second my eyes held hers, bla-
zing with a light I could not read She
did not answer the question instead, she
lay quiet and inert upon the arm that
pressed her to me She had offered no
resistance as I carried her down the gang-
plank  she offered none now but the
fire flaming in her dark eyes burned its
way into my soul and seemed to lay it
bare before her

  “Will I” I asked again, for still she
had not answered

  “What do you want” she breathed
“ Why have you done it ”

  “ Want! ” My voice rang through
the noise-filled pier, above the commands
of policemen and the shouts of excited,
angry men “ Want! I want you—and
I have you now”

   With a fierce instinct of protection, my
arm tightened about her but this time
she did not yield Her slender hands
pushed hard against my breast, all her
helpless strength fought me, and for
very shame iny arm dropped to my side
I could fight for her—1 could not fight
against ’her

  She fell away from me, her gaze roam-
ing without comprehension over the sud-
den tumult The pier was thronged
with shouting men between the dock
and the steamer was open water on the
deck of the Cavour the clubs of the men
from the police - launch were making
short work of the crew demoralized by
the death of their mas'ter and the mu-

(The

 tiny of his lieutenant We had won, and
 she was free—but she knew nothing of it

   Suddenly she drew herself erect in
 tense courage She could not reach the
 steamer—one glance had told her that
 She was a prisoner in my hands, and she
 faced me fearlessly

  “You betrayed me to Rocca Now
you have taken me from him, and you
have killed my brother”

   The blank wonder in the voice was
 that of one who has outlived hope In
 that loud chaos of battle and victory she
 stood alone and undaunted, facing the
 end

   “ Your brother is safe with Mrs
 Noyes I never betrayed you”

   I did not recognize the words as my
 own—I hardly knew that I had spoken
 In my head was the conviction that it
 was all a dream, that some time we
 would awake and I would find her sit-
 ting before the fire as she had sat that
 first afternoon

   “ My brother, Pietro ! He is safe! ”
 The cry brought me sharply to myself
 “-But it is impossible”

    Signorina, your brother is in the
 house from which you fled In half an
 hour you will be with him and free”

   She stood motionless upon the dock,
 her eyes searching mine and slowly I
 saw a new glory arise from their depths

   “ I almost believe you,” she mur-
 mured “ And, oh, if I could ! ”

   One step forward and my arms were
 about her “ He is safe,” I breathed in
 her ear, and then with the blessed awa-
 kening Marshfield’s last words came to
 me “ Am I to be happy ” I asked

   The long black lashes closed softly
 down upon her cheek “ I do not under-
 stand it all,” whispered Maria Bigon-
 tina, “ but I know that I am very happy
 I do not think I ever quite believed it”
 For the second time that evening the
 heavy hand of Peter Marshfield fell on
 my shoulder The banker was still
 standing by my side : but he was not look-
 ing at us, and his eyes blinked strangely
 when he turned them at last from the
 lights in the sky-scrapers of Manhattan'

   “If you are going to marry her, Pa-
 get,” he muttered gruffly, “ you’ll manage
 her property How much will you take
 for that Abyssinian stuff  ”

ON THE EDITORIAL CARPET

      Side-Talks With the Man Who Sits in the Cab of
      the Magazine and Is Commonly Called an Editor

JUST completed our March time-card
Therefore, we feel that we can load our
think-tank with pride, lay back, light the
pipe and chew the fat like a bake-head who
has spent half his life on an old wood-
burner

  But any motive-power that can pull along
a train of a few hundred thousand cars, such
as we pull every month, isn't much like the
woodburners we remember

  We hold all long-distance and tonnage
records, and the length of time we keep out
of the repair shops would, we think, delight
the heart of any master mechanic

  But one thing we must say—it isn’t any
cinch We do it because we are always
overhauling and oiling and cleaning and
adjusting, and because we use nothing but
the finest oil and the best fuel Might as
well quit cold as try to make a limited
schedule on lignite or some kind of grease
that looks like molasses and smells like a
hot box long neglected

  We have just given this February number
the high ball and sent it on its way If any
of the crew deserves a brownie, the captain
who sits back here and does the heavy think-
ing wants to know about it—and as quickly
as possible And its up to you, boys

  We want particularly to assure you on
these points this month, because three of our
splendid serials come to an end in this
number

  Maybe you think we talk like a pinhead
who has just been made private secretary
to the G P A If so, call us down

  In March we shall start on the trans-conti-
nental run a railroad novel, “ Without
Lights” It is the story of a young railroad
man's fight in the dark and it is hot every-
where except at the journals It’s author is
J Aubrey Tyson

  To take the place of another serial, and
by way of a little variety, we are going to
run a complete long story about a bear fight
in a Western railroad town It is by C W
Beels, and it is full of the stuff that makes
your mental rails curl up

  In the matter of short fiction we have not
closed the throttle a notch over the Febru-

ary speed, and this we consider one of the
fastest fiction numbers we have sent out

  We have not neglected humor, as you will
admit between laughs when you read “ The
Man from Texas,” by James Francis Dwy-
er, and “The Rebate,” by Frank Packard,
but we have four tense, dramatic stories
—one by Robert Fulkerson Hoffman, one by
Harry Bedwell, and the others are by new
writers—Robert T Creel and Earl C Wight

  Riding the Rail from Coast to Coast”
slides onto its last rail length next month
and comes to a stop We dislike to state
that the board is placed against this bully
series, but we have another series by Mr
Willets ready to couple onto the train of
his popularity, which will haul it over the
steel at the same old gait Look out for it

  A clever new series that we hinted at a
month or two ago, “The Evolution of Al-
most,” by Horace Herr will also start out
in March Did you ever see a dog carrying
a dinner-pail That's how proud we are
Almost!

  E L Bacon will tell how a record-break-
ing special is put on for a long run when
some millionaire suddenly decides that he
must cover the ground quickly

  Arno Dosch will tell of the conquest of
New York by the Pennsylvania Railroad’s
new entrance to the metropolis A big,
gripping article told in a big way

  We have one of the niftiest yarns for the
True Stories Series you ever read It is
called “ ’Neath the Shade of the Old Water
Tank” It’s a bully tale, too

  Robert H Rogers, one of the most inter-
esting writers on railroad subjects that ever
steamed into our depot, will have a special
011 the nerve of the Eagle-Eye

  We think that our Old-Timer Tales are
going to hit the boys just right The second
one will tell about the famous run of the
Jarratt-Palmer special back in 1S76, when
most of us youngsters were playing with tin
engines tied to strings	—

  But that isn't all It's time for us to
throw the jolly switch and get 011 another
track

  Our March number will be like the new

ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH

SOME time ago a reader asked us to re-
print the poem “Asleep at the Switch,”
and another reader has since asked us for
the name of the author We are indebted to
a lady reader for the following copy The
name of the author is George H6ey, as we
stated in this department in the October
number

The first thing I remember was Carlo tugging
    away,

With the sleeve of my coat fast in his teeth,
    pulling, as much as to say:

“ Come, master, awake, and tend to the
switch—lives now depend upon you,

“ Think of the souls in the coining train,
    and the graves you’re sending them to

“ Think of the mother, and babe at her breast,
    Think of the father and son,

“ Think of the lover, and loved one, too,
think of them, doomed every one—

“To fall, as it were, by your very hand, into
    yon fathomless ditch,

“ Murdered by one who should guard them
    from harm, who now lies asleep at the
    switch”

I sprang up amazed, scarce knew where I
stood, sleep had o’ermastered me so

I could hear the winds hollowly howling, and
    the deep river dashing below

I could hear the forest leaves rustling, as the
trees by the tempest were fanned,

But what was that noise at a distance  That
    I could not understand!

I heard it at first indistinctly, like the rolling
     of some muffled drum,

Then nearer and nearer it came to me, and
    made my very ears hum

What is this light that surrounds me and
    seems to set fire to my brain

What whistle’s that yelling so shrilly Oh,
God ! I know now—it’s the train !

We often stand facing some danger, and
seem to take root to the place

So I stood with this demon before me, its
heated breath scorching my face

Its headlight made day of the darkness, and
glared like the eyes of some witch

The train was almost upon me before I re-
    membered the switch

The switch resisted my efforts, some devil
    seemed holding it back

I sprang to it seizing it wildly, the train dash-
     ing fast down the track

On, on came the fiery-eyed monster, and
    shot by my face like a flash!

I swooned to the earth the next moment, and
    knew nothing after the crash!

How long I laid there unconscious is im-
    possible for me to tell

My stupor was almost a heaven, my waking
    almost a hell

For I then heard the piteous moaning and

shrieking of husbands and wives,

And I thought of the day we all shrink from,
when I must account for their lives
Mothers rushed by me like maniacs, their
eyes staring madly and wild 

Fathers, losing their courage, gave way to
    their grief like a child

Children searching for parents, I noticed, as
     by me they sped,

And lips that could form naught but “ Ma-
    ma ” were calling for one perhaps dead

My mind was made up in a second—the river
    should hide me away

When, under the still burning rafters, I sud-
denly noticed there lay
A little white hand—she who owned it was
doubtless an object of love
To one whom her loss would drive frantic,
tho’ she guarded him now from above

I tenderly lifted the rafters and quietly laid
     them one side

How little she thought of her journey when
she left for this last fatal ride

I lifted the last log from off her, and while
searching for some spark of life
Turned her little face up in the starlight, and
recognized—Maggie, my wife!

Oh, Lord! Thy scourge is a hard one! At
a blow Thou hast shattered my pride!
My life will be one endless night-time with
Maggie away from my side

How often we’ve sat down and pictured the
    scenes in our long happy life

How I'd strive through all my lifetime to
    build up a home for my wife

How people would envy us always in our
    cozy and neat little nest,

When I would do all of the labor and Maggie
     should all the day rest

How one of God's blessings might cheer us
    when some day I perhaps should be
    rich—

But all of my dreams have been shattered
    while I lay there asleep at the switch

I fancied I stood on my trial the jury and
     judge I could see,

And every eye in the court-room was stead-
    fastly fixed upon me

And fingers were pointed in scorn, till I felt
     my face blushing blood-red

And the next thing I heard were the words

“ Hung by the neck—until dead”

Then I felt myself pulled once again, and my
hand caught tight hold of a dress

And J heard “What’s the matter, dear Jim

     You’ve had a bad nightmare, I guess,”
And there stood Maggie, my wife, with never
a scar from the ditch—

I’d been taking a nap in my bed, and had not
     been asleep at the switch

BOUQUETS

WHILE we heartily believe in that good
American motto, “ Every knock is a
boost,” we regret this month that we have
ON THE EDITORIAL CARPET	189

no knocks from our readers to liven up this
little part of The Carpet They are all bou-
quets, and they- are pretty fragrant to us
Here are what some of the boys say:

  H	Stielson, Durham, Concord, Cali-
fornia—I have intended writing you for
some time to express my appreciation of the
value of The Railroad Man's Magazine
I have been a reader since your first issue,
and always watch the news-stands impatient-
ly for its appearance

  C L Baxter, Cleveland, Ohio—Though
I am not a railroad man I like your maga-
zine very much, and get it regularly from
the news-stands

  J P Smith, Reading, Pennsylvania—
I have been a constant reader of The Rail-
road Man’s Magazine, for more than two
years It is the best and most classy maga-
zine ever published, and contains everything
of interest to railroad men Being a tele-
graph operator, I find it very interesting
while on duty at night ___

  B	C Parkfr, Colton, California—I have
never missed a copy of your magazine since
it came out and if it continues as interesting
in the future as in the past, I never will

  C	L Miller, Tampa, Florida—I think
The Railroad Man’s Magazine is nearly
perfect and improves with each issue

  P S Meacham, Duluth, Minnesota—
My sister and I had a scrap about The Rail-
road Man’s Magazine this month, and the
little kids cry every time we take it away
from them It is the one magazine that can-
not be kicked, and the person who makes a
kick about it must have a severe attack of
brainstorm The tonnage it carries is up to
the standard

  George F Babb, Shreveport, Louisiana—
•While I am not expert at throwing bouquets,
I think we should “ toss a few buds ” to “Ye
Editor,” when we have received so many
from him I have been a regular reader of
The Railroad Man’s Magazine from the
first issue, and I can say that it has filled a
long-looked-for link in railroad literature

  While I have not guided a hog for over
eight years, I sure do appreciate The Rail-
road Man’s Magazine, for it is railroad
from cover to cover

  While some one-sided readers occasionally
“ set your packing out ” for you I surely
get the worth of my money While it may
not be as good as the one-sided reader could
do, it is better than I could do, so I get even
by sitting up late to read my copy

  Let the good work go on I remain a satis-
fied jreader of The Railroad Man’s Maga-
zine

  F II Cirnns Melrose, New Mexico —
I have been reading your magazine for the
last three years I think it is chock-full of

human nature The contents of each num-
ber are like what the Irishman said about
the whisky, It is all good and some better”

  Bert Smith, Tombstone, Arizona—I am
a constant reader of your magazine, and
think it the best

  Percy Neister, Richmond, Virginia—
Been a constant reader of your magazine,
and now let me register a kick I want it
every week—or twice a month, anyhow—as
oncc per is so long to wait May your maga-
zine run for many more years to come Don't
try to improve it any more, as it is O Iv
Just give it to us oftener

HAULING NITROGLYCERIN

HERE is an interesting and important
letter from a man who evidently is
in a position to know just what he is talking
about If, as he suggests, any of our read-
ers want his assistance to further hisidea,
we will be pleased to furnish his name and
address 011 application :

Editor The Railroad Man’s Magazine:

  1 have been engaged in the manufacturing
and shooting of nitroglycerin for oil-well
purposes for a number of years, so I do not
expect recognition from your very popular
railroaders, except where human life and
property are at stake

  Now I have been a very eager patron at
the news-stands on the tenth of every month
for a year and a half to get T i'i Railroad
Man’s Magazine, as I consider t the most
interesting publication ever put out In your
December number I find an article entitled,
“The Dynamite Division,” by D A Stovall,
and it recalls a good many similar cases that
have happened in the Eastern States, some
of which have been mentioned by writers in
your magazine

  As I am a great lover of fair play, I be-
lieve those train crews have enough risks
to take without having to handle cars of
dynamite packed as they are There are
plenty of men in their line who would be
willing to show up the cause of these ex-
plosions but who hold back with the fear of
being known as a “ butter-in”

  Now, if facts will be the means of stopping
this useless slaughtering of innocent lives, I
am willing to accept the above title, and
more if need be

  The only cause for those explosions is seep-
age of the nitroglycerin from the absor-
bent, caused by too Vvarm a temperature being
kept in the car, or by the carelessness of the
employees of powder companies in not get-
ting the nitroglycerin equally distributed
with (he absorbent, or by the compression of
the sticks, forcing or squeezing out the gly-
ccrin, which comes in contact with the nail-
heads on the boxes or any other iron plates or
holt-heads on the inside of the box cars
190	THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

  This seepage can be stopped by placing
light tin pans 011 the inside of each case of
dynamite, and which should have a depth of
at least one-third that of the case This pre-
caution will hold the seepage from coming
in contact with hard substances The top
of each case should be plainly marked  This
Side Up”

  Having taken into consideration that some-
times these cases are smashed open and even
the car upset, the danger is almost entirely
eliminated by the glycerin being in its proper
place at the time of the shock The railway
companies or the government could make
the demand for this precaution and get it

  I do not care for notoriety, but if any of
your boys should become interested in this
and wish a detailed description of the nature
of this explosive, they may get my address
through you and write me Personally, I as-
sure them that I will do all in my power to
help their cause	X Y

 MORE VERSE FROM ATLANTA

JAMES A CROWELL, the railroad bard
of Atlanta, author of “ Oh, You Ham”
(First Section), is again in our midst—as
the real country editor would say He con-
tributes one more heart-touching poem to the
Carpet, a gentle tribute and plaintive psean to
that much-written, much-mooted person, the
poor old bo

CONTENTED

Up on the top, ’mid the sleet and snow

Of an east-bound freight lay a poor old bo
His legs were numb, his clothes were old,
And he could hardly keep his hold

He thought about the birds and bees,

And back beneath the maple trees,

When he sat with Katie by the brook—

The sunshine glowed in every nook

He called her “ Pet, she called him “ Dear,”
And they were married in a year

The biscuits that his Katie made
He thought of, too, as there he laid
Upon the train, so wan and bare,

And then thanked Heaven that he was there

ANOTHER OLD-TIMER

OUR good friend, E F Jackson, sends
us a pleasant letter from his home in
Florence, Minnesota, in which he refers to
William G King, an old-timer, mentioned
in our December number Mr King began
by braking on the Northern Central out of
Baltimore in 1869

  “ I can go him six years better,” writes
Mr Jackson, “ having commenced as a mes-
senger boy in 1863 at Appleton, Wisconsin
I have worn the railroad harness ever since,

filling positions as messenger, operator, sta-
tion-agent, track-despatcher and chief des-
patcher

  “ When I commenced, a sound operator
was a rarity We all worked the old regis-
ter The engines were wood burners, with
the old petticoat smoke-stacks keyed on ec-
centrics, and slipping out of place In some
places the track was made of 4x4 wood
with strap iron and snake heads Twelve
to fourteen cars was a big train, and a
20,000-capacity car was ‘ a large one’ ”

  Now, who can go farther back than
Brother Jackson

BALLADS IN DEMAND

A DISTINCTIVE thing about railroad-
ing a distinction which it does not
share with any other business 011 land, but
in which it resembles the free life of the
seafarer, is the way the day’s work and the
day’s play lends itself to song There are,
considering the comparatively short time
that railroads have occupied the attention of
poets and singers, perhaps more songs deal-
ing with the rail than there are dealing with
the sea

  This department has proved that there
is an unending demand for railroad songs,
and that there is an unending supply of
them One friend has written asking that
some reader will supply the song, “ The
Train That Never Rolled In” It begins:

  I was speeding on the train

  That would bring me back again

To the girl I loved in Sunny Tennessee

  Another reader would like to be supplied
with the words of “ Life is Like a Mountain
Railroad” We also have a request for a

song which begins

On a Sunday morning it began to rain,
Around a mountain came a passengpr-train

  Still another reader has asked us fota
poem written by a brakeman who was dis-
charged from the Southern Railway at
Knoxville, Tennessee, several years ago It
begins:

Tell me not in box-car numbers
Life is but ail empty dream

  Two bold gentlemen with weird tastes
inform us that they have long been looking
for songs entitled respectively, “ The Hell-
Bound Train,” and “When Billy Higgins
Used to Wiggle His Ears” If anybody has
seen any of these ballads in the course of

his wanderings, and can remember enough
of them to make readable lines when set
down on paper, we shall be glad if he will
take his stub of pencil and a scrap of paper
and send them on

THE IDENTITY OF DUGAN

DUGAN has owned up We labored with
him long before he would confess in
public He pleaded modesty, shame, poor
relations, and the police—but, as we pointed
out to him, what is sorrow compared with
the applause of posterity

  He decided to take the applause and can
the sorrow, comforting himself with the
hope that perhaps somebody who owed him
money, seeing that he was reduced to wri-
ting for a living, would repent and send him
a remittance

  With this frank explanation, we beg to
announce that, in future, the author of the
jolly Dugan stories will leave the euphoni-
ous shelter of his notn de plume, “ E Flor-
ence,” and come out under his real name—
Augustus Wittfeld He is too good a story-
teller to remain unknown

  Tf you will turn to the story, “ Dugan’s
Pal Goes Dippy,” in this number, you will
see that we speak the truth In the letter he
sent us admitting his identity, he says:

There are Dugans at work on every road—
  Dugans with yarns worth while

And I trust that the Dugan I write about
  Will cause the many to smile

His mission on earth is a mission of fun,
  May he never be known as a bore

For his object in life is to make two grow
  Where only one smile grew before

CARPETED AGAIN 1

Editor, The Railroad Man’s Magazine:

1 NOTICED in the December number of
The-Railroad Man’s Magazine, in an
article entitled “ Making the Lightning Hus-
tle, that the average speed of an operator
is nine words a minute

  I greatly differ with you on this subject
I am an operator myself, and would consider
nine words to the minute very slow for the
average telegraph operator

  Most any ham can copy twenty words with
ease, and a good operator generally takes
from thirty-five to forty words to the min-
ute Surely, this must have been a misprint

  I am a regular reader of The Railroad
Man's Magazine, and think it simply great
I am not a subscriber, but always get a copy
of it each month

  I may be mistaken in my charges, but I
know a great many operators, and am almost
positive that nine words a minute is far
below the average Yours truly,

“ Railroad Hank”

AS TO OUR MONACHER

WE have had a great many serious and
puzzling problems put up to us at
various times, but here is one that taxes our
gray matter so that the gage is way beyond
the limit

  A reader, who evidently has better inten-
tions, wants to know why we write Young
Men’s Christian Association and The Rail-
road Man's Magazine In our editorial
capacity we have done most everything, from
telling a tallow-pot how to propose to solv-
ing the modulus of elasticity in steel springs
We have forgotten a good deal about gram-
mar, especially that part which relates to the
construction of plurals and possessives and
suchwthings

  So far as we know—men's or man's—it
is simply a matter of choice We could have
called it The Railroad Men’s Magazine had
we wanted to but it is our belief that a great
many noted authorities, such as Goold-
Brown and Edgar Allan Poe, always held
that the singular was the most forcible and
effective

  However, as living examples, we refer to
our esteemed sisters, The Ladies’ Home
Journal and the Woman’s Home Companion

OH, YOU HAM!

(Second Section)

THE ham is the most popular man on a
railroad—not In the December num-
ber we published a fine poetic tribute to this
most expert of ear-pounders, written by Mr
James A Crowell That poem met with
approval It inspired the muse of another
gentleman, Mr E Logsden, of Shawnee,
Oklahoma, who evidently has bitter proof
that the only thing a ham can hit is the hay
—except when he is hitting the pike looking
for another job The result of the inspira-
tion was Section Two of the ham sandwich,
which runs along thusly:

This ham he got another job
  On the grand old B & O,

And the way that he OS'd the trains
  Was something fierce to know

But as the night passed onward,

  From midnight unto dawn,

This ham got very sleepy
  And soon began to yawn
192	THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE

And soon 'twas dear old Slumberland,

That he had drifted to,

And how he dreamed, and dreamed, and
dreamed
From twelve midnight till two

He thought he’d been promoted,

•In an awfully short time,

And now he was despatching
On the B & O’s main line

He dreamed that he’d been boosted
In another, shorter time

And now he was superintendent
Of the B & O’s main line

And so he still lay dreaming
As the fast express pulled in

The despatcher he was calling—

Calling that ham like sin

Still he dreamed that he was standing
Midst a mighty throng of men,

And a big white-headed gent said,

“ I guess we’ll promote you again”

And just as they were drinking
To the health of this king-pin,

Old Humpy, boomer brakeman,

Poked him hard upon the chin

He awoke in awful panic,

And he looked around with fright,

And he heard the C D calling
With all his main and might

Our poor ham is now a looking
For a job—I know you’ll weep—

But I think he’ll soon be G M

Of that good old railroad, Sleep

THEIR WOES IN VERSE

OH, ye Casting Buffer! Shades of ye
Main Crank Pin! Hail! Glorious
Injector Steam-Valve—and all the other
Muses! But the manner in which every
railroad man, from captain to end-shack, is
breaking into poetry is enough to make any
man in an editorial cab yell for the binders

Just as we were drawing the fires and
locking the old steamer up for the night,
just as we were picking up our dinner-
pail and starting home, along came a bunch
of letters from the boys, telling us about
their troubles, and—Holy Headlamp !—tell-
ing them in verse

We began reading them We wish we
might print them all, but we have only space
for one here on the last page The author
is W C Deuel, of Birmingham, Alabama
He says:

“They started us out the other am,
with a little old engine, leaking and in very
poor condition to tackle the day ahead of us
We were disgusted when she came to the
cab-track

“The engineer, the brakeman, the fireman
and myself gave voice to some of the state-

ments in the following verses, in which the
meter changes without notice and the rime,
at will, but they express our opinion of the
machine we had to do business with that day

 “Your November number eulogizes the
 “ Tallow-pot, in a well-written piece of poet-
 ry The engineer suggested I write up the
 113 and send the result to you So this crime
 is as much 011 him as 011 any one else, and
 we know you will picture that deal we were
 up against that day, as probably your experi-
 ence has thrown you in a like dilemma

 We respectfully submit our 113 to you:

 THE 113

 “ What engine have you  ” the operator
     sked,	

 As we rolled into C S

 “ My boy, you must have been in the hay,
 Or you’d have heard N B O S”

 “The engine we have is a la-la, my lad

 She’s the pride of the hills and dales

 But the poor old girl has seen better nights
 And weathered many hard north gales”

 They built her 'way back “ befo’ de war,”
 She has served them' faithfully, too!

 The men that have run her and filled her
      with coal

 Would number far more than a few

 I recall the day, in my box career
 When she was mentioned as “ big”

 She was a real consolidator—

 Sometimes, we called her, a “pig”

 But that day has floated into the past
 And will come this way no more,

 Engines like her are now counted out,
 With a tag for the beautiful shore

 She’ll pull her tonnage down any old hill
 And pop like a fiend ’gainst her blower
 She o’ertook a snail—’twas dead, they aver,
 So say the “ Old Heads,” that know ’er

 She bucks like a broncho, kicks like a mule

 The head brakey won’t stay inside her

 I	never saw anything quite so tough
 As this flat-wheeled Rough Rider!

 Baldwin built her and a bald one she is

 Likewise a Tartar, a pippin—

 She’ll delay the game pulling a sand-pit

 If she ain’t blowin’ up, she’s slippin’

 She is so antiquated and useless now
 That whenever I discuss her,

 Well, I accent that last syllable
 So hard that it ought to bust her

 But enough of this airy, fairy talk,

 I’ve got her and I’ve got to go
 Over, and benevolently assimilate
 The coke ovens at D O

 Tell that third “X” to fix ’er,

 Give us a green “ 19,”

 And may some enemy of mine
 Catch the little old “ 113 ! ”

The greatest home charm

Make your home - coming
as late as you please from
party, ball, or theatre and
you will find your boudoir
or bed-chamber delightfully
warm and “comfy’’ to talk
things over with your guest
if the home is Steam or

Common hospitality demands a warm home

Heart confidences—“the pearls of friendship”—are born only where
there is warmth and coziness IDEAL Boilers and AMERICAN
Radiators help so greatly to give a home its greatest charm—perfect
freedom day and night to enjoy every nook and comer of it, no matter
how blizzardy the weather IDEAL Boilers circulate their soft
warmth for hours after the fire in the boiler has been banked for the
night, and the house is kept cozy for the rising time and breakfast hour
on the single charge of coal put in the evening before

ADVANTAGE 10: Burning coal liberates certain gases which burn readily and
make intense heat if permitted to “take fire” The chambers (and the flues opening

out of these'spaces) are so arranged in IDEAL Boilers that
they bring in the exact amount of air required
for completely burning these gases as fast as
freed from the coal There can be no “undi-
gested” coal—every ounce of fuel is made to
yield its utmost heat—none of its heat-making
power is wasted up the chimney

 Are YOU Condemned to

           What is life going to mean to you Is it going to mean
           comfort and prosperity, or is lack of training going to
           condemn you to hard labor for the rest of your days 

         You are facing a serious problem — one that affords absolutely no compro-
     mise To earn enough to command the comforts of life you must have special
     training, or else be content to fall in line with the huge army of the untrained, the
     poorly-paid, the dissatisfied, the crowd in the rut

         For you, there is a way to success—a true way — an easy way—a short way

     make you an expert in your chosen line of work, in your spare time, and without your

The Coupon Means

  When I was sixteen years of age I purchased a Course in
Interior Wiring At that time I was an apprentice at the
plumber’s trade, getting a small salary

   When I reached the age of seventeen years I started in the
business myself as an Electrical Contractor To-day I am not
quite eighteen years of age, with an increased income of $310
per day over what I received when I enrolled

  I owe all my progress to the International Correspondence
Schools

                     WILLIAM G METTIN,

P O Box 49, South River, N J

   I have increased my salary 50 per cent I had no experience
in Window Trimming before enrolling in the I C S Shortly
after enrolling I got a position with Reid & Congers, largest
department store in Clinton, Iowa, as Trimmer I held the
position with said firm for 14 months and then got a better
position with T R Glanville «fc Son, Mason City, Iowa, with an
increase in salary of 40 per cent

                    JOHN AHRENHOLZ Jr

Mason City, Iowa

   At the age of sixteen, while employed by a doctor as driver,
I enrolled in the Electric Lighting and Railways Course of the
I C S After a year’s study, in which I nearly completed my
course, I secured a position through my application by mail in
the power house of the Ottumwa Ry & Lt Co , of Ottumwa,
Iowa At the age of nineteen I was promoted to Operating
Engineer, which position I have held for the last two years

   When I landed in this country on the 5th day of December,
1903, I did not know a word of the English language, and conse-
quently was forced by circumstances to hard work for $10 a
month

   About three years later I heard about the I C S, and the
same day, in June, 1907, I enrolled with you for the short Coal
Mining Course, and in May last I received my Diploma

  Last November I took the complete Coal Mining Course
Recently I successfully passed the examination for mine fore-
man Now I am getting $4 a day and only eight hours work

Holstein Milk

For Both Mother and Baby

If you have a new baby, of course you will nurse it, for
'•Remember, there is nothing as good for the baby as
mother's milk

If you will drink the milk of the large, vigorous Holstein
Cow, you cannot help imparting vitality to baby as well as
gaining strength yourself This seems a simple way to
get strong Try if It cosls little and you will find your-
self gaining rapidly, as well as your baby

If you do not nurse your baby, drink Holstein Milk
yourself and get your physician to tell you how to modify
it for baby If baby is well and strong the milk will
probably not need modifying Nearly all milk supply
stations, laboratories, sanitariums, hospitals, etc, use
Holstein Milk exclusively, for infant and invalid feeding
Many of them have their own herds of Holsteins

Our little book, The Story of Holstein Milk has a
fund of information in it, and we are pleased to send it
upon request

What is Navy Training Worth to You

 IN learning to care for and operate the scores of battleships, cruis-
 ers and torpedo boats of the Navy, the bluejackets undergo
 systematic training, which results in promotion and increased pay So
 perfect has this system been made that only a few each year out of
 44000 enlisted men fail to advance Much of the training is techni-
 cal and makes men proficient in the trades—more proficient than the
 average man gets to be in a large plant ashore, in the same period-
 four years

   Even the routine duties have been planned as far as possible to fit
 the bluejackets for more difficult and more important work

   The Navy does not want the bluejacket to leave the Service at the
 end of four years because he has become proficient Last year 6j per
 cent, who were entitled to re-enlist returned to the Service Doesn't
 this prove that the bluejacket's training is worth a lot to himself, and
 that the Navy appeals to him as a good proposition

   Look for the address of the Navy Recruiting Office in the want columns
 of your Sunday papers If you don't find it, write for illustrated booklet
 describing duties, pay, privileges, etc, and learn how and where to apply

A LIVING FROM POULTRY

$1,50000 FROM 60 HENS IN TEN MONTHS
ON

TO the average poultry-
nian that would seem
impossible and when we
tell you that we have
actually done a $1,500
poultry business with 60
liens 011 a corner in the
city garden 40 feet wide
by 40 feet long we are
simply stating facts It
would not be possible to
get such returns by any
one of the systems of
poultry keeping recom-
mended and practiced by
the American people,
still it is an easy matter
when the new

PHILO
SYSTEM

is adopted

THE PHILO SYSTEM IS UNLIKE ALL OTHER
WAYS OF KEEPINC POULTRY,

and in many respects just the reverse, accomplishing things in poul-
try work that have always been considered impossible, and getting
unheard-of results that are hard to believe without seeing

THE NEW SYSTEM COVERS ALL BRANCHES
OF THE WORK NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS

from selecting the breeders lo marketing- the product It tells how
to get eggs that will hatch, how to hatch nearly every egg and how
to raise nearly all the chicks hatched It gives complete plans in
detail how to make everything necessary to run the business and at
less than half the cost required to handle the poultry business in any
other manner

TWO POUND BROILERS IN EIGHT WEEKS

are raised in a space of less than a square foot to the broiler almost
without any loss, and the broilers are of the very best quality, bring-
ing here three cents per pound above the highest market price

OUR SIX-MONTHS-OLD PULLETS ARE LAYING
AT THE RATE OF 24 EGGS EACH PER MONTH

in a space of two square feet for each bird No green cut bone of
any description is ted and the food used is inexpensive as compared
with food others are using

 Our new bctok, the Philo System of Poultry Keeping, gives
full particulars regarding these wonderful discoveries, with simple,
easy-to-unaerstand directions that are right to the point, and 15 pages
of illustrations showing all branches ot the work from_start to finish

DON’T LET THE CHICKS DIE IN THE SHELL

  One of our secrets of success is to save all the chickens that are
fully developed at hatching time, whether they can crack the shell
or not It is a simple trick and believed to be the secret of the
ancient Egyptians and Chinese which enabled them to sell the
chicks at 10 cents a dozen

CHICKEN FEED AT 15 CENTS A BUSHEL

Our book tells how to make the best green food with but little
trouble and have a good supply, any day in the year, winter or sum-
mer It is just as impossible to get a large egg yield without green
food as it is to keep a cow without hay or fodder

OUR NEW BROODER SAVES 2 CENTS ON
EACH CHICKEN

No lamp required No danger of chilling, overheating or burn-
ing up the chickens as with brooders using lamps or any kind of
fire They also keep all the lice off the chickens automatically or
kill any that may be on them when placed in the brooder Our
book gives full plans and the right to make and use them One
can easily be made in an hour at a cost of 25 to 50 cents

TESTIMONIALS

Bellefontaine, Ohio, June 7, 1909
Mr E R Philo, Elmira, N Y

    Dear Sir:—I just want to tell you of the success I have had
with the Philo system In January 1909, I purchased one of your
Philo System books and I commenced to hatch chickens On the
third day of February, 1909, I succeeded in hatching ten chicks I
put them in one of your fireless brooders and we had zero weather
We succeeded in bringing through nine  one got killed by accident
On Tune 1, one of the pullets laid her first egg, and the most re-
markable thing is she has laid every day since up to the_present

Yours truly,

 S LaRue

E R PHILO, PUBLISHER,

                           Valley Falls, N Y Sept 101909
My dear Mr Philo:—I want to tell you how pleased I am with my
use of the Philo System during the past year The fowls laid
exceptionally well in the New Economy Coop, much better in pro-
portion than those in my old style house The fireless brooder has
solved the problem for me of raising extra early chicks I am going
into your methods more extensively this coming vear Wishing you
success, I am, sincerely yours,	(Rev) E B Templer

Mr F R Philo, Elmira, N Y	South Bri'ai, Conn, April 14, 1909

    Dear Sir—I have followed your system as close as I could the result is a complete
success If there can be any Improvement on nature, your brooder is it The first
experience I had with your System was last December I hatched 17 chicks under
two hens, put them as soon as hatched in one of your brooders out of doors and at
the age of three months I soid them at 35c a pound They then averaged 2 1-2 lbs
each, and the man I sold them to said they were the finest he ever saw, and he wants
ail I can spare this season	Yours truly	A E Nelson

Mr F R Philo, Elmira, N Y	Elmira, N Y„ Oct 30 1909

    Dear Sir:—No doubt you will be interested to learn of our success m keeping
pou try by the Philo System Our first year’s work is now nearly completed It has
given us an income of over $50000 from six pedigree hens and one cockerel Had
we understood the work as well as we now do after a year's experience, we could easily
have made $100000 from the six hens In addition to the profits from the sale of
pedigree chicks we have cleared over 96000 running our Hatchery plant consisting
of 56 Cycle Hatchers We are pleased with the results, and expect to do better the
coming year With best wishes,’we are, very truly yours, (Mrs) C P Goodrich

Send $ioo direct to the publisher and a copy of the latest
revised edition of the book will be sent you by return mail
