A CAVE
WOMAN’S
DIARY

      JANUARY 1.—There are times when I wish
      I’d been shingled before ever I met George
      or else that he’d grabbed a loose lock. This
      morning he swore that the ichtyosaurus egg I
      gave him was stale, but what does he expect when
      it’s been laid about a million years ? Things won’t
      keep for ever even in the Ice Age.

He says he never gets anything now like his
mother used to make, but I’d like to see myself
serving up a lump of raw frozen aurochs as she
used to. The old lady knew nothing of our Up-to-
date Methods in the Home, and never cooked over
in her day.

a fire in her life, because fires hadn’t been invented
I knew George had got up the wrong side when
my pretty ickle woolly-haired rhinoceros tried to
jump on his knee, and he kicked it in the Quarter-
nary Period.

It all commenced a month ago, when I was try-
ing to invent the first xylophone, and I wanted the
thigh-bone of the man next door for an A flat. It
appeared to be just the length, but after George
had taken one good look at the club the other fel-
low was carrying, he said that he couldn’t afford
it. He’s getting mean.

                        I wept, of course, and he tried to comfort me
                      with a lump of Old Red Sandstone, but it didn’t
                      leave a mark. He doesn’t love me any more.

                       And to think that this is the wretch whom I
       promised to love, honour, and obey. He was so
       nervous at the wedding that he dropped his axe,
       and his hand shook so much that if I han’t butted
       int oit myself I should still have been single.

It was for him I filted Herbert, whose ancestors
FOLLIES

came over m Miocene times when George’s lot
were barred by the Immigration authorities be-
cause they’d bitten their tails off to make them-
selves look like men. But I was stunned by the
way George threw his wealth about. It weighed
half-a-hundredweight.

January 6th.—The landlord called to-day. Must
make a note that we needn’t get any food in for
the sabre-toothed tiger for a week.

January 23rd.—Had my dancing lesson from
the cave-bear, and learnt a new step called the

Neck Wriggle. At least, I was told it was a new
step, but it seems just like the old Shoulder
Squirm. I shall have another when that collar-
bone knits together again.

   February 14th.—What do you think? Trixie is
engaged. She showed me the bump. It’s a beauty,
larger than the one I had. She is a bit long in the
tooth, and I expect when her fiance first caught
sight of her, he took her for a pterodactyle, and
welted her one. Anyhow, he’s compromised her,
and she’s safe.

   She tells me she’s looking forward to her hon-
eymoon trip. I never said anything, but I hope it
keeps fine for her. It took me weeks to get rid of
the gravel rash on the back of my neck.

March 22nd.—There’s a fizzy feeling in the air
to-day, like boiling snow, and George says it’s
spring. I caught him chipping something on a
rock.

There was a picture of a slice of melon with
clouds round it, and a man pulling a lady’s hair.

He said it was poetry. Poetry—I ask you ? And
it was for this he said that he was too busy to help
me beat the rushes. He went very red when I
spoke about it, and threw it on the floor.

I picked it up, and he kicked up an awful fuss.

Said he wasn’t going to have anybody in the end

           of the cave where he works, disarranging all his
           things.

          But I’ve got no time to talk to him. Every-
'i	things filthy. There’s the walls to be scraped,

i ^	and I’m going to make him knock a hole in the

          roof to let the smoke out. A man came to the
FOLLIES

If

door this morning, while the tiger was asleep, and
I gave him a handful of George’s old bones for a
little tree in a pot. You ought to have heard
George when he found out.

March 28th.—I believe the dinosaurus has got
distemper. It sneezed a big hole in the side of the
cave to-day, but I don’t mind that. I never had

            enough cupboards in which to put all my things.
            But it wouldn’t touch its saucer of milk. George
            hates it, because it put its paw through the bars
            after George’s plesiasaurus.

               The plesiosaurus does sing a lot. I tried to alter
             its loud speaker with the axe once while George
             was out, but it ate the axe and cried for more.

March .31st.—George is chipping a letter on the
back of my best bedroom suite. He says he is the
first man to hear the cuckoo this spring. It was
really a dodo with hiccups, but I dare not tell him
so.

April 1st.—Been busy all day burying things
for posterity, including the picture george drew
of the time he caught a fish as large as a mam-
moth, but it got away from him. I shudder when
I think of the artistic quality of that picture, and
I feel sorry for posterity.

April 11th. —George came home to-day and told
me he’d got promotion. He brought it with him.
It’s a thing you call a spear, and you stick it in
things. It works, because George tried it on the
man who invented it. I sometimes think these
modern business methods are too ruthless, and
the agitators who tell us we ought to share out
everything everybody else has got are right.

   After all, George isn’t such a bad old sort, and
when he merely had a job at the bench chipping
flints he worked hard, so that I don’t think his
new executive post is likely to get up in his head.

   When I was a girl I used to dream of having a
handsome husband I could look up to, say about
seven feet high, and who wouldn’t chase me
round the cave in a perfunctory manner every
morning before he started for business.

Still, George is better than nothing. I must
speak to him about taking a furnished cave at the
FOLLIES

seaside this summer for the children. We ought
to get possession easily enough with that , spear
as a reference. The only trouble is that I’ve got
simply nothing to wear.

  The shortage of caves is a scandal, and even
the causalties in the struggle for existence don’t
?ase matters much. It’s my belief the world is
overpopulated. George said he had to queue up
for his turn with the corn mill yesterday. Society,
according to him, is going to the Megarithiums.
people are beginning to work. He does nothing
but sigh for the good old times.

  April 27th.—Made a great discovery to-day. I
found some red earth, and rubbed it on my lips,
and it stayed there. I rushed off to our best mir-
ror—the pond where George shoots the remnants
of his political opponents—and I look ten years
younger. I’ll show that cat next door something.

May 10th.—My birthday, and the brute never
said a word about it. When I reminded him, he
looked guilty, and said he’d been saving some-
thing for me for a long time. I got it after sup-
per, but I think I must be getting older. These
trifles hurt more than they used to.

June 3rd.—George came home breathing very
heavily, and looking very tired. He said he’d
stepped on a volcano, but I know better. I found
out afterwards that he’d put three bones on what
he said was a horse. It turned out to be a creature
about the size of a cat, with three toes on each
foot, so that I’m not surprised that it lost.

  He wants me to make him a thing he calls a
shirt to-morrow, which he can put on a dead snip
he knows of. But if the snip is dead, what does he
want to put a shirt on it for? Why doesn’t he
bring it home so that we can eat it?

June 9th.—This servant problem is getting
fierce. We’ve lost our girl again. The family from
whom George got her discovered where she was,
and got her back again, in the usual way. When
George is able to move again, we shall have to look
for another.

June 15th.—Took George to a mannequin show
to-day in the woods, and saw some perfectly love-
FOLLIES

ly gowns. Furs always look best on their original
owners. He grumbled, as usual, but finally he got
me a polecat evening frock and a beaver after-
noon gown.

  September 24th.—I’m getting sick to death of
the dull daily round of housework, and the way
those brats of ours put their knees and elbows

through their clothes is sinful. George came home
to-day with a long thin bone sharpened at one end
and with a hole in the other, which he said was a
needle. I don’t like it. It’s like all these labour-
saving devices. It means more work for the pro-
letariat, meaning me.

  November 3rd.—That hateful creature with the
red hair next door asked me to go in this after-
noon and talk to her, and after I’d got the kids to
sleep with George’s niblick, I went.

She also showed me a beautiful thing for cook-
ing. It’s a skull, and you fill it with water and
hold it over the fire. I must get George to bring
me one home next time he meets a stranger. But
the things that woman said about everybody else
made my ears flap.

             November 15th.—Down at the lake to-day the
           red-haired fright next door said that we women
           ought to get up and strike a blow for ourselves.

           I agree with her. Why should we stop at home
           and slave, while the men do everything interest-
           ing?

             December 25th.—I don’t know what the weath-
           er is coming to nowadays. It’s actually so warm
           that all the ice is melting. We never get a good
           old-fashioned winter such as they had years ago.

   /CA

December 28th.—I’ve finished with the brute
f "X for good. For some time he’s been pulling his
y/[b\ whiskers out by the roots with the end of a flint,

\y\ and to-day I wanted to write to mother.

V\	The chisel was a little blunt, so I took George’s

y ) hair-extracting flint to sharpen it, and when he
//f found out he used language that made the alli-

VaA. gators blush.
F 0 L L I E S

  December 29th.—Poor George. He always was
a bull on cave bears, in spite of my warnings. He
intended to bring one home for supper, but the
market went against him, and the bear got the
supper. I shall never get another husband like
George, and I don’t intend to marry again, ever.
My heart is broken.

  December 30th.—Such a handsome stranger
followed me home to-day. He’s got lovely side
whiskers, like a mammoth.

  December 31st.—Something tells me that some-
thing is going to happen to me to-day. I must put
some of that red earth on my lips, and find out
what became of those headache powders.

pretty and slim, was an instant
success before the camel a and wan

  Molly was a great girl and ev-

Her slimness vanished almost
overnight. The studio refused to

eased her when she sat down.

  Molly was brave and earnest,
but to this day she has been un-

slim figure, which was once her
greatest charm, has been restored.
So Molly has been out of work ; out

Pan had displayed so proudly in

  Q. I have written 49(5 scenarios
that I am sure are good. For some
reason none of them has been ac
cepted and I cannot explain this
unless the scenario editors are con-
spiiing to keep new talent out of
the field. What would you sug-
gest to get me what I deserve?

  A. Chloroform.

  Q. I am a young girl 18 years
old and have a boy friend just
two years older. We love each oth-
ei very much, but my parents will
not permit us to marry because
he plays the saxophone in a jazz
orchestra. What can I do?

  Ans. A jazz orchestra is no
place to find a husband, but if you
must take a chance, a man who
plays the saxophone is better than
one who plays the flute. Person-
ally, we wouldn’t trust even the
drummer.

  Q. My boy friend told me last
night that I reminded him of a
Hollywood virgin. What is a
Hollywood virgin?

  Ans. A fern,ale child living in
Hollywood and not over ten years
of age.

  Q. 1 am 20 years old and have
been consumed with a desire to
enter the movies. I live in a small
town and my friends tell me I am

ifornia bathing beauties. I have
saved up car fare to Hollywood.
What would you advise me to do7
A. If you are sure of your las'
two statements send your tele-
phone number and, do nothing un-
til you hear from me.

  Q. I am a young girl graduate
of a school of motion picture act-
ing and have played in several pic-
tures as an extra. Can you advise
me how to secure a regular part?
I want to become a star in the

  A. Well, it might be done that
way. It depends on yourself.

am eneacred polled his handker-
chief out of his pocket while he
was visiting me the other night

was a sleeve band and then what
could you say?

Babies
 in holy, holy Hollywood

EVERY gal in Hollywood wants
to have a baby, the light to
complete their womanhood. Talk
about it out loud, too, at parties—
the more gin the louder—while the
men stand around and try to look
unconcerned. Anyhow, if you’re a
gel, and don’t want to have a baby,
you don’t belong in Hollywood.
But how are they going to do u
—these gals? Time was, and not
so long ago, when motherhood was
the last thing of their thoughts.
Marriage was bad enough from a
professional viewpoint, and moth-
erhood would simply wreck their
careers!

  Marriage appears to be the chief
drawback to the gels in the movies
who are so freely dissertating on
their desires to have babies and
to complete their womanhood.
Marriage in the movies is not al-

  ways so good. It happens, though,
  sometimes openly and sometimes
  secretly, and nobody can be quite
  sin e who is married in Hollywood

THE TALES
OF The
CORKSCREW

ONCE upon a time there was
an all-round sport who was
i'll, sick, off his feed and on the
blink.

  And being sick he was doubly
a rogue. And into the sick room
of the old sport dropped a friend.
Ihe friend was of the cheerful
exceeding cheerful type. His mot-
to was, “look on the bright side
and scatter sunshine wherever you
go.” So he entered the sick-cham
ber in his breezy, altruistic way
and shouted, “Why, Old Sport,
bow fine you are looking!”

  “I don’t feel that way,” growled
the sick man.

  “Oh, come now, really I never
saw you looking so well.”

  “Liar and lickspittle,” said tn*>
sick man, “I’m in bad shape.”
“You have .just overworked a
little.”

  “Idiot!”

  “You will be at the ball game
Saturday.”

  “Pimire!”

  “Your eyes are bright.”
  “Pollywog!”

  “Your tongue is not coated!”
  “Horse-thief!”

  “You have no fever.”

  “Shitepoke!”

  “It is only a slight attack of in-

<

digestion.”

  “Mutt!”

  “Your complexion is perfect.”

  “Mollycoddle.”

  “And, anyway, your vocabulary
is all right.”

  “Sunovabych!”

  “It is only a matter of nerves!”

  “Enough of that!” hoarsely
whispered the man on the bed.
“I’m a dam sick man, I tell you!”

 “Nonsense!” exclaimed the
agent of the Sunshine Society,
“all foolishness. Why, you will be
out tomorrow.”

  “You are a liar, I say,” breathed
the sick man laboriously. “I am
near cashing in. The doctor was
here an hour ago and said if I
turned over I would be a dead man
in less than ten minutes.”

 “What do the doctors know
FOLLIES

about it?”

  “I’ll bet you five to one that my
doctor is right.”

  “I’ll take it,” smiled the visitor.
With much pain the old sport
pulled a roll of bills from under
the pillow, peeled off a five and
pushed it over on a stand at the
head of the bed.

  The friend laughed, fished a
cart-wheel dollar out of his pants
and laid it on the five on the stand
with the medicine bottles.

 “I’ll show you, you g’dam,
cheerful, mouse-colored ass,” said
the sport. And with that the sick
man rolled over on his right side.
In three minutes he was dead —

dead as a salt mackerel. But as
he gave his last gasp his lips mov-
ed as trying to say, “What did I
tell you!!” And a half-smile of
triumph came to his glazed eyes,
and his hand moved convulsively
toward the six dollars on the table.
Then all was still.

  They buried him next day with
the half-smile of success still on
his face. Instead of a bouquet in
his hand they placed the six dol-
lars on his breast, the silver dol-
lar on top of the five. The under-
taker exchanged the six dollars for
a confederate ten-dollar bill just
before he screwed down the lid.

  Sandy (addressing caddie): “Are

  Caddie: “Aye!”

  Sandy: “Then find one the noo

  A man and his wife, who lived in
Ayr, had a boy whom they believed
to be a mute, for up to his tenth
year he had never spoken.

  One day his father and he were
at work in the field, and, getting
thirsty, they made their way to-
ward a jug of cold tea. The father
took the jug and began to drink.
As he gulped down the tea slowly
the thirsty boy said :

  “Hurry up!”

  Whereupon the father put down
the jug in astonishment.

  “Why,” he said, you’re talkin’!
Why didn’t ye never speak be-
fore?”

  “Naught to say,” replied the
child.

  The new chaplain of a Scotch
asylum was complimented one day
by an inmate who said, “We like
you better than any other chaplain
we have ever had.”

  “I’m pleased to hear it,” said the
minister. “May I inquire what it
is that has made me preferred by
you above my predecessors?”
“Weel, ye see,” replied the in-
mate, “we think ye mair like oor-
sels than ony o’ the ithers.”

   One of the worst stories we have
read for a long time is as follows:
Jones was asked about Smith.

Jones was asked about Smith.
“He’s a Scotsman,” replied Jones,
“and that’s enough.” He was asked
how he knew Smith was a Scots-
man and Jones said: “Because
every time he is invited out to a
place where he knows he is going
to get a drink he eats salted pea-
nuts on the way out.” The story
is ridiculous. Who ever heard of a
Scot spending a nickel for salted
peanuts ?

  The other day a Scot walked into
Woolworth’s and asked a clerk
where the furniture department
was Another Scot was fond of his
nickels and he sqeezed one of
them so hard the Indian came

He Had Experience

  A red-headed boy applied for a
job in a delicatessen shop.

  “What can you do,” the boss
asked him.

  “Anything,” he replied. “How
much will you give me ?”

  “Three dollars a week, starting
right now. What can you do to
make yourself useful?

  “Most anything.”

  “Well, be specific. Can you dress
a chicken?”

  “Not on three dollars a week,”
said the boy.

  A man who takes considerable
pride in the fact that he has “a
way with children was passing
through a sleeping car when he
heard a child in one of the berths
wailing lustily. He noticed a small
foot peeping through the curtains
and thinking to help some worried
mother pinched the toes gently one
by one and repeating the old nur-
sery rhyme:

  “This little pig went to market,
  This little pig stayed at home,
  This little pig got bread and

milk,

  This little pig got none,

  This little nig said—”

  But he didn’t finish the rhyme.
An irate mother peered through
the curtains, remarking that there
was one big big pig who was going
to get his face slapped if he didn’t
let her foot alone.

“strong drink” and broken homes.

  “No, you’re quite wrong,” said

ruins so many homes.”

  “What is it, then?” querried the
other.

  “Why, thirst, of course,” said the
first man, as he turned to speak to
Bunty.

  “Love alone,” gurgled the comely
young heroine, the spot-light play-
ing on her upturned orbs, “love
alone is not enough!”

  “You’re right, miss,” cordially as-

A DELICATE COMMISSION

  An unwary youth who allows
himself to be inveigled into doing-
shopping for a lady is apt to find
his pathway beset with unsus-
pected difficulties. I found that
out one afternoon when Sally
begged me to do a little errand for
her down at Wanamaker’s. Sally
usually does forget something
vital. And the worst of it is that
she prides herself on her memory,
scorns to make a list of her re-
quirements and always forgets a
most important item.

  Sally is my sister. She is several
years older than I and inclined to
treat me like an infant—although
I graduated from Harvard last
year.

  We had just finished luncheon
when she began in a most ingrati-
ating tone, “Billy, darling.”

  I pretended not to hear.

  “Billy, darling,” she repeated,
changing her seat to the arm of
my chair, “I want you to do some-
thing for me.”

  “Well, what is it?” I asked ab-
ruptly, continuing my reading of
the NATIONAL BULLETIN.

  “I forgot something this morn-
ing—and I want you to get it for
me. Some people are coming in for
tea and I’ve got a heap of odds and
ends to do before then. Please be
a nice boy and go get it for me.”

  “I didn’t intend to go out today
—it’s too hot. Can’t it wait until
tomorrow?” I protested.

  “That would be too late. I must
have it for the dance tonight.”
“Send one of the maids.”
“They’re all too busy. Come on,
Billy, do be nice. Forget you are
my brother for once and don’t be
such a selfish pig.”

  I kept still for a moment.

  “Look here,” she bribed. “I’ll
tell you what I’ll do for you if you’ll

do this for me. I’ll telephone the
Caroll girls that we’ll drive around
for them tonight and pick them up
on our way to the club. Then you
can meet Estelle beforehand.”

  I was anxious to meet Estelle. 1
had admired her from a discreet
distance so far. She was a jolly
good sport and remarkably pretty.
I had been unsuccessful in meeting
her and now that my chance had
come I felt suddenly willing to do
anything Sally wanted.

  As the door closed behind me, I
heard her repeating, “One pair,
open pattern, ladies’ embroidered
—” I waited to hear no more. I
had already been told what to get
at least three times. Sally has a
habit of telling you what to get
three times and then impress upon
you what you are not to get several
times over. So I was somewhat
muddled when I started out.

  Whew! But it was hot! I en-
tered Wanamaker’s cool store
gratefully. Seating myself beside
a long counter whereon all sorts of
dainty lingerie was seductively dis-
played—a bit o flace, a few bows of
ribbon, and a little sheer silk—
scarcely more.

  A lady was trying to make up
her mind between pink and beige
lingerie. Having at last made her
purchase she collected her change,
a Pomerian pup, and her hand bag
and moved off. Now was my op-
portunity. The pretty young sales
person began to fold and replace
the various articles she had taken
out for her customer’s selection.
At length coming forward, she
said with a bewitching smile, “Any-
thing I can do for you, sir?”

  “Yes,” I began. “I want a pair
of open pattern, ladies’ embroid-
ered—” I found myself talking to
air. The sales girl had disappeared.
FOLLIES

  A conclave of assistants seemed
to be taking place at the far end of
the counter. Stray phrases caught
my ear. “No, did he really?” “He
never!” “What cheek!” floated
across to me. I was in no way in-
terested.

  After some minutes another
young lady approached me. “Are
you being waited on, sir?” she
asked sweetly.

  “I thought I was,” 1 replied.
“What I want is a pair of open pat-
tern, ladies' embroidered—Again
I was talking to air. The girl was
gone, her face and neck dyed with
a blush that would have shamed
a peony.

  “Is it a fact?” I heard one of the
girls say. “Did you ever!” while
they threw curious glances in my
direction. I began to feel embar-
rassed and most miserably self-
conscious. What was wrong? I
determined to find out. Perhaps my
necktie was crooked, or my face
dust-streaked.

  I felt I must see myself at any
price. I did not want to be too ob-
vious about it. There was a glass
just behind me, and as I got up to
look, I dropped my cane. Picking
it up, I sat down across the aisle
facing the mirror. I surveyed my-
self carefully—my hair was smooth,
my tie was straight, nothing was
undone or out of place. Now what
caused this apparent interest?

  I again turned my attention to
the girls. They kept giggling and
nudging each other, saying: “You
go” — No, you go” — Oh, I

couldn’t”—“I haven’t the face”—
and a lot of silly rubbish like that.

  Finally, a rather superior young
person detached herself from the
group and came toward me. With
a certain dignity she enquired,
“What may I do for you, sir?”

  I repeated my request. Before I
had time to finish she seized a box
of goods that was lying on the
counter, slammed it noisly into
place on the shelf behind her and
departed with more haste than dig-
nity.

  This was absurd! I was furious.
I decided to report the matter to
the head of the department. Just
then a floorwalker came in sight. I
strode up to him and demanded an
explanation of the way in which I
had been treated. “I have asked no
less than three of your girls what

I	want and they have left before I
finished my order.”

  He smiled apologetically, “I’m
sorry, sir. May I ask what it is
you want?”

  “I want a pair of ladies’ open pat-
tern, embroidered stockings.”

  “I fear there has been a slight
misunderstanding—you see you are
in the wrong department! Hos-
iery!” he said, “First aisle on the
right!”

  Never again will I be forced,
duped or cajoled into doing any
intimate shopping for a lady. But
it was worth it after all, for Sally
was as good as her word and intro-
duced me to the sweetest girl in
Philadelphia that evening.
