extra dimension,” ventured Astley.
“But still I don’t follow your rea-
soning-. You can’t exist in two places
at once. That’s impossible on the
face of it. Yet from what I gather
you can exist, you have existed,
in two separate and distinct times.
For instance, you’re a grown man
now but when you were a baby—”
“That’s the fourth dimension of
it,” I broke in. “The baby Leo
Thrasher was, in a way, only the
original tip of the fourth-di-
mensional me. At ten I was a cross-
section. Now I’m another, six feet
tall, eighteen inches wide, eight
inches thick—and quite some more
years deep.” I began to tinker with
my lights. “Do you see now?”

  “A little.” Astley had produced
his oldest and most odorous pipe.
“You mean that this present mani-
festation of you is a single corridor-
like object, reaching in time from the
place of your birth—Chicago, wasn’t
it?—to here in Florence.”

  “That’s something of the truth,”
I granted, my head deep in the great
box-like container that housed the
electrical part of the machine. “I
exist, therefore, only once in time.
But suppose this me is taken com-
pletely out of twentieth century
existence—dematerialized, recreated
in another epoch. That makes twice
in time, doesn’t it?”

AS I had many times before, I
thrilled to the possibility. It
was my father’s fault, all this labor
and dream. I had wanted to study
art, had wanted to be a painter,
and he had wanted me to be an engi-
neer. But he could not direct my
imagination. At the schools he se-
lected I found the wheels and belts
and motors all singing to me a song
both weird and compelling. The
Machine Age was not enough of a
barrier to me.

  I demanded of it other wonders—
miracles.

  “I've read Dunne's theory of cor-
ridors in time,” Astley was musing.

“And once I saw a play about them
—by J. B. Priestly, wasn’t it?
What’s your reaction to that stuff?”
“That’s one of the things I hope
to find out about,” I told him. “Of
course, I think that there’s only the
one corridor and I’m going to travel
down it—or duck out at one point,
I mean, and re-enter farther along.
What I’d like to do would be to re-
appear in Florence of another age,
Florence of the Renaissance.”
Astley nodded. He preferred the
French Gothic period because of the
swords and the ballads but he un-
derstood my enthusiasm for Renais-
sance Italy—to me, the age and
home of the greatest painters, poets,
philosophers of all times.

  “Then what,” he encouraged me,
gajjiing interest.

  “I’ll paint a picture—a good one,
I hope. A picture that will properly
grace a chapel or church or gallery,
a picture that will be kept for four
centuries or more. Preferably it
will be a mural that cannot be
plundered or destroyed without tear-
ing down a whole important build-
ing. When it’s finished, I'll come
back to this time, to this hour al-
most. Of course, I’ll have to build
myself a new time-reflector where
I am, because it will be impossible
to take this one with me.”

  “And we’ll go together to the
chapel or church or gallery and look
at your work of art?” asked Astley.
He lighted his pipe. “It will be your
footprint in the sands of another
time. Isn’t that what you mean?”
“Exactly. Evidence that I’ve been
twice in time.” I sighed with a feel-
ing of rapture, because for a
moment I fancied the adventure al-
ready accomplished. “If I’m not
able to do a picture,” I told him,
“I'll make my mark—initials or a
cross. Cut it in the plinth of a
statue, scratch it on the boards at
the back of the Mona Lisa or other
paintings that I know will survive.
It will be almost as good a proof.”
I smiled. “However, I daresay
TWICE IN TIME	15

they’ll let me paint. I have a gift
that way.”

  ‘‘Perhaps because you’re left-
handed.” Astley smiled at me
through the blue smoke. “But one
thing—in Renaissance Italy, won’t
your height and buttery hair be out
of place?”

  “Not among Fifteenth-Century
Tuscans,” I said confidently. “There
were many with yellow hair and
blue eyes. Look at the old Floren-
tine portraits in any art gallery.
Look at the streets of Florence to-
day. Not all of those big tawny
people are foreigners.”

  As I talked I was reassembling
my machinery that we had brought
with great care from my native
America to this spot that I had
long since chosen as the obvious
place for my experiment. The ap-
paratus took shape under my hands.
The open framework, six feet high,
as many feet long and a yard wide,
was of metal rods, painstakingly
milled to micrometric proportion in
Germany.

  At one end, on a succession of
racks, was arranged my ray-genera-
tor, with its light bulbs, specially
made with vanadium filaments in
America. My camera-like device
which concentrated the time-reflec-
tion power had been assembled from
parts made by English, German and
Swiss experts. And then there was
the lens of alum with its housing,
as big and heavy as a piece of
water-main, which I now lifted care-
fully and clamped into place at the
front of the camera.

  Astley stared, and drew on his
pipe. It was plain enough that he
looked tolerantly on all my labor as
well as my talk, and that he be-
lieved the whole experiment was
something of which I would quickly
tire. However, he had been com-
plaisant enough about coming with
me and lending what aid he could
to my secret experiment.

  “That business you’re setting up
there looks like the kind of thing

science fictionists write about,” he
said.

  “It’s exactly the kind of thing
they write about,” I assured him.
“As a matter of fact, science fiction
has given me plenty of inspira-
tion and more than a little infor-
mation while I’ve been making it.
But this is practical and material,
Astley, not imaginary.”

  He had not long to wait to witness
the truth of that, though his phleg-
matic nature could never have un-
derstood the tenseness that was-mak-
ing my nerves taut as a spring trap.
I knew, however, that nerve strain
was to be expected, for I was near-
ing the actuality of the experiment
to which I had long given my heart
and soul. I said nothing more be-
cause now, within the tick of
seconds, I would know whether my
dream could be reality or if, in fact,
that all I had toiled and anguished
for—was but a dream!

T AM not sure—how could I be cer-

*	tain ?—whether my hands were
steady when the great moment came.
I know vaguely that my hands did
reach out—

  I pressed a switch. At the other
end of the framework there sprang
into view a paper-thin sheet of
misty vapor, like a piece of fabric
stretched between the rectangle of
rods. I could be excused for the
theatricality of my gesture.

  “Behold the curtain!” I said.
“When I concentrate my rays upon
it, all is ready. I need only walk
through.” I stepped back. “Five
minutes for it to warm up and I’m
off into the past.”

  I began to take off my clothes,
folding them carefully—the tweed
suit, the necktie of wine-colored
silk. “I can be reflected through
time,” I said with a touch of whimsi-
cality, “but my new clothes must
stay here." And more seriously, “I
can’t count on molecules to approxi-
mate them at the other end of the
business.”
16

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

  “You can’t count on molecules to

approximate your body either,”
challenged Astley.

  I knew that he was not as stolid as
he was trying to appear, for his
pipe had gone out and. he was filling
it and I could see that his hands
shook a trifle. He was beginning to
wonder whether to take me seriously
or not. Unimaginative Astley!

  “All my diggings into old records
at the Biblioteca Nazionale, over in
town, have been to find those needed
molecules,” I told him. “Look at
those notes 011 the table beside you.”
He turned in. his big armchair—
it was none too big for him at that
—and pieked up the jumble of
papers that lay there. “You’ve
written a date at the top of this
one,” he said as he shuffled them.
“ ‘April thirtieth, Fourteen-seven-
ty.’ And below it you’ve jotted
down something I don't follow—
‘Mithraic ceremony—rain prayer—
ox 011 altar.’ ”

  “Which sums up everything,” I
said, pulling off my shoes. “Right
here—right at this inn, which I
hunted up for the purpose of my ex-
periment—a group of cultists
gathered on April thirtieth, Four-
teen-seventy. Just four hundred and
sixty-eight years ago today.” I
leaned over to look at the time gauge
on my camera. “I’m set for that
exactly.”

  “Cultists?” repeated Astley, whom
I knew of old as apt to clamp men-
tally upon a single word that inter-
ests him. “What sort of cultists?”
“Contemporaries called them
sorcerers and Satanists,” I told him.
“But probably they had some sort of
hand-me-down paganism from old
Roman days. Something like the
worship of Mithras.* At any rate,
they were sacrificing an ox on that
day, trying to bring rain down on
their vineyards.

  •	Charles Godfrey Leland, In his Important
work. "Aradia; or the Gospel of the Witches
of Italy,” traces connections between witch-
craft and. the elder pagan faiths of Rome.

  “1 have figured it out like this—

if they needed rain, then that par-
ticular April thirtieth must have
been bright and sunny, ideal for my
reflection apparatus. They had an ox
on the altar and from its substance
I can reassemble my own tissues
to house my personality again. The
original molecules must, of course,-
have been dissipated somewhere
along the route of the process in
time. Is that all clear?”

  Astley nodded slowly and I stood
up without a stitch of clothing. A
pier-glass gave me back a tall pink
image, lank but well muscled,
crowned with ruffled hair of tawny
gold.

  “Well, old man,” I said with what
nonchalance I could manage though
every nerve in me was tingling,
“the machinery’s humming. Here I
step into the past.”

MY COMPANION clamped his
pipe between his teeth but did
not light it again. I could still see
the disbelief in his eyes.

  “I hope you know what you’re
about and won’t do yourself much
damage with that thing.” he
grumbled. “Putting yourself into
such a position isn’t like experi-
menting with rats or guinea pigs,
you know.”

  “I haven’t experimented with rats
or guinea pigs,” I informed him and
stepped into the open framework.

  I turned on another switch and
through the lens of alum flowed an
ice-blue light, full of tiny flakes that
did not warm my naked skin.

  “As a matter of fact,” I said in
what I was sure was a parting mes-
sage, “I’ve never experimented with
anything. Astley, old boy, you are
about to see the first operation of
my time reflector upon any living
organism.”

  Astley leaned forward, concern at
last springing out all over his face.
“If anything happens,” he protested
quickly, “your family—”

  “I have no family. All dead.”
 With lifted hand I forestalled what
 else he was going to say. “Goodbye,
 Astley. Tomorrow, at this time, have
 a fresh veal carcass or a fat pig
 brought here. That’s for me to ma-
 terialize myself back.”

   And I stepped two paces forward
 —into and through the misty veil.

   At once I felt a helpless lightness,
 as though whisked off my feet by a
 great wave of the ocean. Glancing
 quickly behind me I momentarily
 saw the room and all in it, but some-
 how vague and transparent—the
 fading image of the walls, the win-
 dows, my openwork reflector-ap-
 paratus, Astley starting to his feet
 from the armchair. Then' all
 vanished into white light.

 rPHAT white light beat upon me
 -1 with an intensity that was sick-
 ening. I tasted pungency, my fibers
 vibrated to a humming, bruisjng
 rhythm.

   There, was a moment of hot pain,
 deafening noise, a glare of blinding
 radiance.

   Then peace, lassitude. Something
 seemed to materialize as a support
 under my feet. Again I saw the
 transparent ghost of a scene, this

17
18

time full of human figures. That
too thickened, and I heard many
voices, chattering excitedly. Then all
was color, life, reality.

  One voice dominated the others,
speaking in resonant Italian. "The
miracle has come!”

CHAPTER II

      V

    The First Half Hour

AT THOSE words, all fell silent
and gazed at me in awe. It
seemed unbelievable but all this was
happening to me in the back yard of
—yes, of Tomasulo’s tavern. It was
a changed back yard though, domi-
nated by a simpler newer building.

  I seemed to have trouble with my
memory. It lagged as though I had
been stunned. And the differences
helped to confuse me. Here were no
flagstones, no clutter of innkeeper’s
jetsam—only a level stretch of turf,
hedged around with some tall close
bushes of greenery. And my audi-
ence was grouped below rather than
before me. I seemed to be standing:
high on a platform or pedestal of
cut and mortared stone.

  The altar of the ox-sacrificine:
cult! I had made the journey back
through time from a Twentieth Cen-
tury that just now hung dim and
veiled in my mind, like something I
had known in childhood instead of
brief seconds ago.

  “Kneel,” intoned the same voice
that had hailed me as a miracle.

 At once the group before me
dropped humbly down. There were
a dozen or so of both sexes, most
of them shabbily dressed. The men
wore drab or faded blouses and
smocks with patched hose on their
legs. The women were untidily
tricked out in full skirts, bodices
and coifs or caps. Men and women
alike wore long hair and several
were as blond as myself.

  I was quite evidently taken for
some strange manifestation of the
god or spirit they worshiped. Realiz-
ing this, I felt that I had an ad-
vantage. I sprang lightly down from
the altar.

  “Do not be afraid,” I told them in
my best Italian. “Rise up. Which
is the chief among you?”

  They came to their feet, in a shy
group around me, and the tallest of
them moved forward. “I am master
of this coven,” he murmured re-
spectfully, fixing me with shrewd
calculating eyes. “What is your
will?”

  “First, lend me that red cloak of

yours.”

  He quickly unclasped it from
about his throat. I draped it over
my nakedness and felt more assured
before this mixed audience.

  “Now,” I continued, “hark you
all! Did you worship here because
you sought a miraculous gift from
heaven V*

  “Not from heaven exactly,” said
the man who had given me his cloak.

  He was the best clad of the entire
group, wearing plum-colored hose
and a black velvet surcoat that fell
to his knees. His narrow waist—he
was an inch taller than I and gaunt
as a rake—was clasped by a leather
belt with a round silver buckle.

  His sharp face was decorated by
a pointed beard of foxy red and
above this jutted a fine-cut long
nose. His eyes, so intent upon me.
were large and deep, the wisest eyes
I had ever seen. His broad brow,
from which the hair receded as
though beginning to wear away, was
high and domed.

  There was something- about him to
suggest Shakespeare — Shake-
speare’s face, that is, much more
alert and enigmatic than generally
pictured and set upon the body of
Ichabod Crane. I describe him thus
carefully because of the impression
he made upon me then and because
of the importance of the role he has
since played in my life and career.
TWICE IN TIME

19

  “Not from heaven,” he said again.
“Rather from our Father in the
Lowest.” He gestured downward
with a big but graceful hand. “Why
do you ask? Have you not been
sent by him?”

  This was a definite challenge and I
made haste to simulate a grasp of
the situation. With an effort I re-
membered the study I had made of
this very incident, the prayer of a
sorcerers’ cult for rain on April
30, 1470.

  “I am sent as your friend,” I an-
nounced. “This ox, which you have
offered—”

  I gestured behind me toward the
altar, then turned to look. The stones
were bare save for a slight, dark
moisture. I paused, thought quickly,
and went on.

  “This ox, which you have offered,
has been transmuted into me, so that
I may be your friend and guest.”
There was more truth in that than
my interrogator in the velvet sur-
coat thought, I told myself
triumphantly. But I did not know
him yet. I also congratulated my-
self that there had been an entire
ox, for my time reflector seemed
to have left little of it after the
process of reassembling.

  “As to the rain,” I finished, “that
will come, doubt it not.” For I had
seen, on the horizon beyond the
lowest stretch of hedge, a lifting
bank of cloud.

  “Thank you, Oh messenger!”
breathed an elderly cultist at my
side. “Thank you, thank you!” came
prayerfully from the others.

  TTie lean spokesman bowed a little
but I could discern the hint of a
growing mockery in those deep
brilliant eyes.

  “Your visit is far more than we
poor worshipers had the presump-
tion to hope for,” he said silkily.
“Will you suffer these servants of
the true belief to depart? And will
you come with me to my poor dwell-
ing yonder?"

  I nodded permission and he spoke

briefly in dismissal of the others.
They retired through a gap in the
hedge, respectfully but without the
awe a miracle might be thought to
call forth. I was surprised, even a
little piqued. Then the rationaliza-
tion came to me.

  This was the Fifteenth Century
and the people were more naive,
more credulous. They had come to
this strange ceremony in expecta-
tion of a wonder. And when it
came—even when there was more
than they had hoped for, as my
volunteer host suggested—it did not
prostrate them with emotional
amazement. I was strange but I was
understandable.

WHEN the last had departed I
faced the gaunt man. I have
compared his body to that of Icha-
bod Crane but he was surer of his
long limbs than the schoolmaster of
Sleepy Hollow. Indeed he seemed
almost elegant with his feet planted
wide apart and one big hand
bracketed upon a bony hip.

  ‘‘How are you called?” I asked
him.

  “My name is Guaracco,” he said
readily. “The master, I say, of the
coven which has just done worship
here. But if you are truly a mes-
senger from him we delight to serve,
why do you know not these things
without my telling?”

  A sneer was in his voice and I
felt that I had best establish my
defenses.

  “Ser Guaracco,” I addressed him
bleakly, “you will do well to show
courtesy to me. I did not come here
to be doubted.”

  “Assuredly you did not,” he
agreed with a sort of triumphant
good humor that yet made me un-
easy. “And now, once more, will
you come with me into my home?”
He made another of his graceful
gestures, this time toward the back
door of the stone house that I knew
for Tomasulo’s inn—at least for
what would one day be Tomasulo’s
20

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

inn. I nodded agreement and we
walked together across the turf to
the door.

  That thought of mine—for what
would one day be Tomasulo’s inn.
It behooved me to learn a new pro-
cession of thought, one that came
two ways to the present. I must
remember not only from the past
but from that future, four centuries
off.

  I clarified the puzzle by calling to
mind a fragment of conversation in
Through the Looking-Glass. It read
like this, I remembered: “It’s a poor
sort of memory that only works
backwards.” The White Queen had
said that and, later, “Sometimes
I’ve believed as many as six im-
possible things before breakfast.”
I had never before realized the deep
scientific philosophy of that delight-
ful story. Meanwhile it might help
clear the fog that hung so per-
sistently in some chambers of my
mind.

  My new acquaintance tapped
softly on the door, which opened at
once. Upon the threshold stood a
tiny male creature in a dark gown-
like garment. He was no larger
than a child of nine and the bright
face upturned to us might have
seemed sweet if it had not reminded
me of Guaracco’s.

  “Is this your son?” I asked my
host.

  He laughed quietly.

  “Yes, Ambassador of the Powers
Below. In some degree this is my
son.”

  The little figure stood courteously
aside and let us step into a dark nar-
row corridor. Guaracco’s hand
touched my arm through the folds
of the borrowed cloak and I allowed
myself to be guided down the pas-
sageway into a room beyond.

  Here were dark decent hangings,
a thick carpet, chairs, a settee and a
table, on which lay some bulky and
ancient-looking books. A single fat
candle in a bronze sconce illuminated
the room, for there was no window

—only a barred air-hole at the top.
Guaracco invited me to sit down
with a sweep of his hand toward
the settee.

  “I will offer you refreshment,”
he announced and clapped his hands.

  From behind the hangings, evi-
dently from a shadowed compart-
ment beyond, darted a figure as
small as the one that had admitted
us to the house. But this one was
hunched and misshapen with a
pinched and aged-looking face set in
the loose high collar of its gown.

  In its long, knob-knuckled hands
was held a tray with a silver flagon
and two goblets of blue glass. This
tray was set upon the table, then the
small figure made a quick exit with-
out looking back. I had been unable
to judge sex or age in the brief
moment of the small one’s presence.

  Guaracco carefully poured red
wine from the flagon. “You do not
ask,” he commented smoothly, “if
that was another of my sons.”

  I made no comment for I could
think of none. Instead of growing
clear my memory was becoming
more scrambled and it worried me.
There was also a definite taste of
menace in the atmosphere. Guaracco
lifted one of the goblets and held
it toward me.

  “He was as much my son as the
other,” he said. “Take this one, Am-
bassador. I daresay you will never
drink another draught like it.”

  I took the goblet and he lifted
the other.

  “I give you a toast,” he said, in a
voice that suddenly rang with fierce
mockery. “Sir, your immediate
transportation to the floor of hell—
the very place from which you ly-
ingly claim to be sent!”

  It was too much. I rose quickly
and set down the goblet on the table.
My left hand, with which I am
quickest and handiest, doubled into
a fist.

  “Ser Guaracco,” I said harshly,
“I have had enough of your dis-
courtesy. You doubt my being of an-.
TWICE IN TIME

21

other world, even though you saw
me appear from the very substance
of the ox upon the altar, so—”
“Enough of that falsehood,” he in-
terrupted.

  Quickly but delicately he set his

razor. They closed quickly in upon
me, their eyes glittering cruelly.

  Guaracco laughed calmly, the
laugh of one who makes the final
move in a winning game. “Before
my familiars cut you into ounces,”

I constructed a really workable distillery in my prison celt (CHAP. XVI)

goblet down beside mine. Again he
struck his palms together twice.

  From the entrance to the passage
darted the pretty little keeper of the
doorway. From the opening behind
the hangings sprang the withered-
looking bringer of wine. Each held
a long, thin blade, curved like a
scimitar and plainly as keen as a

he said, “you had best make con-
fession of your motives.”

  “Confession?” I echoed, amazed.

  “Exactly. Oh, miracles have hap-
pened upon that altar before this—
but it was I, Guaracco, who taxed
my brain and my machine-shop to
prepare them. Now you come with-
out my knowledge or leave. I do not
22	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

allow rivals for my power, not even
where it concerns those few foolish
witch-worshipers. Out with your
story, impostor—and at once!”

CHAPTER III
The Service of Guaracco

I CANNOT but be ashamed of the
way I broke down. I might have
faced out the surprise—I might have
defied the danger. Together they
overwhelmed me. Then and there,
with Guaracco leering at me through
his red beard, with the two dwarfs,
who no longer seemed like little
children, standing with swords
ready to slash me to death, I told
the truth, as briefly and simply as
possible.

  Guaracco heard me out, interrupt-
ing only to ask questions—most in-
telligent questions. When I had
finished he nodded slowly and sagely.

  “I know that you will refuse to
believe—” I began but he inter-
rupted.

  “But I do believe,” he assured me
in a tone surprisingly gentle. “I be-
lieve, lad, and in part I understand.
My understanding will be made per-
fect as we discuss things more fully.”

  He snapped his big fingers at the
dwarfs. They lowered their swords
and with a jerk of his head he dis-
missed them through their respec-
tive doors. Immediately there was
less menace in the atmosphere. I
felt relieved and thirsty. But when

I put out my hand for the goblet
Guaracco moved more quickly than
I and spilled the wine out upon the
carpet.

  “That draught was poisoned,” he
informed me. “I meant to destroy
you, as a spy or rival. But fill again
and we shall drink to our better un-
derstanding.”

 I poured wine and we touched
goblets and drank. His eyes above

the brim were as knowing as Satan's
own and for the first time I was sure
of their color—deep violet-blue, al-
most as dark as ripe grapes.

  “This is better,” I said and smiled
—but Guaracco did not smile back.

  “Do not think,” he returned in a
level tone of warning, “that I can-
not kill you later if such a course
recommends itself to me. Those
little entities you saw, frail though
they appear, are half-parcels of fate.
They can handle their blades like
bravos, they can scale the tallest
towers or wriggle between the
closest bars to deal death at my will.
The skulls of their victims, destroyed
in my service, would pave all the
streets of Florence, yonder. Nor” —
and his voice grew colder still—
“are they my only weapons.”

  He stepped suddenly close, so that
his proud lean nose was within an
inch of mine. “In fact, your life
could have been taken in two dozen
ways between the yard and here, to
say nothing of the poison and the
steel I have seen fit to show you. Sit
down, lad, and hear my plans for
you.” e

  I sat down, with an unheroic show
of acquiescence. He felt himself my
master for his teeth flashed in a
relished grin.

  “Hark you, I seek power,” he told
me. “Much power I have already.
I wield it through the coven of de-
luded witches you have seen and
others like them, through my spies
and creatures in the guilds and com-
panies and councils, through my in-
fluence on many individual persons,
base and noble, here and elsewhere.
But I want more power still. One
day I shall not fear”—his narrow
chest expanded a bit—“to give my
orders to Lorenzo himself.”

  “Lorenzo il Magnifico!” I mur-
mured. “He rules in Florence of
course.”

  “Yes, he rules, prince in all but
name—for the nonce. His time, I
dare predict, will be short.” He
strode across the room, hands be-
TWICE IN TIME

23

hind his velvet back, then turned
and stood over me. “Hark you, man
from the future. Your world, what
you tell me of it, is not so strange
nor so great as I would have ex-
pected. Yet you have many sciences
and devices to show me. Ma-
chines, organization, foreknowledge
of myriad kinds. For them I spare
your life. You will be yet another
of the chief agents in my service.”

  He told me that with flat assur-
ance and I did not have the resolu-
tion to question his decision. All I
could manage was something about
my surprise that a sorcerer would
be so interested in honest science.

  “But sorcerers are scientists," he
fairly snapped. “We offer our learn-
ing to the simple and they gape as
at a miracle of demons. For effect's
sake we mouth spells and flurry ges-
tures but the miracle is science, sane
and practical. If I am a sorcerer, so
was Albertus Magnus. So was Roger
Bacon, the English monk who gave
us gunpowder. Well, if I escape the
noose or the stake I may be as great
as they. Greater.”

AS HE spoke I pondered how his-
tory was showing him wise and
truthful. Magic always foreran
science. From alchemy’s hokus-
pokus had risen the boons of
chemistry, physics and medicine. The
quibblings of astrologers had made
astronomy a great and exact field of
scientific study. Also, could not
psychoanalysis look back to the an-

cient Chaldean magicians who inter-
preted Nebuchadnezzar’s dreams?

  But now I was dealing with things
in the future from which I had
stepped, things that had happened
in that future. Again I attempted
and almost achieved the feat of
rationalizing the memory of things
to come. If I could do it, I felt, the
clouds would leave my mind.

  “This traveling in time that you
have accomplished is of deep inter-
est to me,” Guaracco continued, pac-
ing back and forth. “I feel that we
may attempt it again together. I
would dearly love to see that world
of which you speak, four centuries
and more ahead of us. But these
things are not more wonderful than
others you mention. Tell me some-
thing about weapons of war.”

  Slowly and vaguely I ventured a
description of the magazine rifle,
then of the machinegun. My ex-
planations were faulty and imper-
fect, yet he was deeply interested
and brought forth tablets and a red-
leaded pencil with which to make
sketches.

  He drew crudely and I took the
pencil from him to improve his
representations.

  “By Mercurius, the god of thieves,
you depict things well!” he praised
me. “Your left hand is surer than
my right. Perhaps you have studied
the arts? Yes? I thought so.” He
squinted at me knowingly, tweak-
ing the point of his foxy beard. “I

am inspired concerning you.”

  “How is that?” I asked.
“Tomorrow we go into the city of
Florence,” he decreed. “I shall in-
troduce you there as a kinsman of
mine, newly from the country, who
seeks to enroll in the ancient and
honorable guild of Florentine
painters. I know a fitting teacher
—Andrea del Verrocchio. I shall pay
his fee to enter you in his bottega
as a student.”

  “I am to serve you there?”
“Serve me there or through there
in other places. Verrocchio is well
known and well liked. Lorenzo and
the other great nobles patronize him.
I have not yet a proper agent among
the arts. You will suit nicely in that
position.”

  Again I agreed—because there
was nothing else to do. He chuckled
in triumph and actually patted my
shoulder, saying that we would
get along famously as adopted
cousins. Then he led me to another
room, in which were a bed and a
cupboard.

  “You will rest here tonight,” he
informed me. “Here”—he opened
the cupboard—“may be some cloth-
ing that will furnish you. We are
of a height, you and I, and not too
dissimilar in girth.”

  But despite Guaracco’s confidence
in this last matter his hose stretched
drum-tight upon my more muscular
legs and his doublet proved too nar-
row in shoulder and hip.

  “We shall have that altered,” he
decided and, going to the door, raised
his voice. “Lisar

  “My lord?” replied a soft, appre-
hensive voice from another room.

  “Come here at once, child, and
bring your sewing tackle.” He
turned back to me. “You shall now
see my greatest treasure, Ser—Leo,
I think you called yourself ? That is
the name of the lion and it matches
well with that tawny mane of
yours.”

  Into the doorway stepped a girl.

  In her way, she was nearly as

impressive as Guaracco had been.
Not tall, of a full but fine figure, as
graceful as a dancer, she paused on
the threshold as though timid at
sight of a stranger. Her face was
finely oval, with large soft eyes of
midnight blue and a shy close-held
little mouth that was so darkly red
as to be purple. These spots of
color glowed the more vividly be-
cause of the smooth ivory pallor of
her skin.

  Her hair was thick and sooty
black, combed neatly straight under
a coif as snug as a helmet. She wore
a chemise of sober brown with a
black bodice over it and a black
woolen skirt so full and long as to
hide her feet.

  In her thin steady hands she held
a flat iron box, the sewing kit
Guaracco had commanded.

  Have I described a beautiful
woman? She was that and nobly
modest as well. And so I call her
impressive.

  “Lisa, I present to you Ser Leo,
a new servant of my will,” said
Guaracco to her. “He is to be of
value to me, therefore be courteous
to him. Begin by altering this
doublet to his measure. Rip the
seams here and here and sew them
together again in a fuller manner.”

  He turned to address me. “Ser
Leo, this girl Lisa is for you a model
of obedience and single-hearted
helpfulness.” He raked her with
his eyes, not contemptuously but
with a dispassionate pride, as though
she were a fine piece of furniture.

  “I bought her, my friend, of her
beggarly parents, eighteen years
gone. She was no more than six
months old. I have been father and
mother and teacher to her. She has
known no other lord than myself,
no other motive than mine.”

  The girl bowed her head as if to
hide her confusion at being thus
lectured upon and busied herself
with scissors and needle. I pulled
Guaracco’s red cloak around my
naked shoulders. My self-appointed

master smiled a trifle.

  “That flaming mantle becomes you
well. Take it as a present from me.
But to return to Lisa—I trust her
as I trust few. She and the two
•imps you have seen are the closest
to me of my unorthodox household.
She cooks for me, sews for me, keeps
this house for me. I, in turn, shelter
and instruct her.

  “Some day, if it will profit me
greatly, I may let her go to a new
master—some great lord who will
thank me for a handsome submissive
present. She will cherish that great
lord and learn his secrets for me.
Is that not so, Lisa?”

  She bowed her head the lower and
the ivory of her cheeks showed pink,
like the sky at the first touch of
morning. I shared her embarrass-
ment but Guaracco chuckled quietly
and poured himself a half-goblet of
wine.

   This he drank slowly, without in-
viting me to join him.

   In a surprisingly short time Lisa
had finished broadening the doublet
for me and it fitted my torso like
wax. Guaracco was moved to another
of his suave compliments on the ap-
pearance I made.

YJJ7TTH evening drawing near the
▼V three of us took a meal. It was
served in the hedge yard where
Guaracco’s dupes had prayed to in-
fernal powers for rain. Whether
by prayer or by coincidence, the rain
did arrive not long after we had
finished the bread, chicken and salad
that Lisa set before us. As the first
drops fell we went indoors and took
wine and fresh peaches and honey
by way of dessert in a great front
room that was luxuriously furnished
with gilded couches, tables and
tapestries.

  After the supper, Guaracco con-
ducted me to his workshop, a great
flag-floored cellar. Here was a bench,
with lamps, retorts and labeled flasks
for experimentation in chemistry
and in this branch of science I was

to find my host—or captor—amaz-
ingly learned.

  The greater part of the space,
however, was filled with tools and
odds and ends of machinery, both
of wood and metal.

  At Guaracco’s command, I busied
myself among these. But my strange
memory-fault—I was beginning to
think of it as partial amnesia—came
to muddle me again. I could make
only the most slovenly demonstra-
tions and when I sought to explain
I found myself failing wretchedly.

  “You cannot be blamed for these
vaguenesses,” Guaracco said, almost
comfortingly. “A drop backward
through time, four hundred years
and more, must of necessity shock
one’s sensibility. The most delicate
tissues are naturally in the brain.”
“I hope to recover my faculties
later,” I apologized. “Just now I
progress in generalities only.”
“Even so, you are better grounded
in these things than any man of this
present age,” he encouraged me.
“Your talk of that astounding power,
electricity, amazed me. Perhaps
things can be harnessed with it.
Steam, too. I think I can see in my
mind’s eye how it can be put to
work, like wind in a sail or water
flowing over a mill-wheel.” His eyes
brightened suddenly. “Wait, Ser
Leo. I have an inspiration.”
“Inspiration?” I echoed.

  I watched while he opened a small
casket on the bench and fetched out
a little purselike bag of dark velvet.
From this tumbled a great rosy
pearl the size of a hazelnut and
glowing as with its own light. Upon
his palm he caught it and thrust it
under my nose.

  “Look!” he commanded and I
looked.

  To be sure, it must be a valuable
jewel to be as full of rose-and-silver
radiance as a sunset sky. It capti-
vated my soul with the sudden im-
pact of its beauty.

  “Look,” repeated Guaracco and I
gazed as though my eyes were bound
TWICE IN TIME

27

in their focus. The pearl grew big-
ger, brighter.

  “Look," he said, yet again as from
a distance and, though I suspected at
last his motive, I could not take my
eyes away.

  The light faded, consciousness
dropped slackly from me like a gar-
ment. I knew a black silence, as of
deep sleep, then a return to blurred
awareness. T shook myself and
yawned.

  A chuckle sounded near by. and 1
opened my drowsy eves to find
Guaracco’s foxy face close to mine.

  “You are awake now?” he asked,
with a false gentleness.

  “How long did I sleep?” I asked
but he did not reply.

  He polished the pearl upon his
sleeve and slid it carefully into its
velvet bag.

  “I think that some, if not all, of
the forgotten things are buried in
your mind,” he observed. “With you
I tried a certain way that fools call
black magic.”

  Hypnotism, that was it. Guaracco
had hypnotized me. Had he, in
reality, found in my subconscious
mind those technical matters that I
seemed to have almost forgotten?

  “Every minute of your company,”
he was continuing, “convinces me
that I did well to spare your life and
enlist you in my service. Now draw
for me again.”

  I obeyed and he watched. Once
again he praised me and swore that
I should be placed as a student with
Andrea del Verrocchio. It had grown
late by now and he escorted me to
my bedchamber, bidding me good-
night in most cordial terms.

  But when the door closed behind
him I heard the key turn in the
heavy bronze lock.

       CHAPTER IV
       Apprenticeship

ON THE following day fell the
torrents of rain that had been
praved for in such occult fashion
and the trip to Florence was post
ponrd. To my chagrin my memories
of various details that had been so
clear during my twentieth century
existence were even cloudier, so
much more so that I spent the morn-
ing making notes of what little I
remembered.

  These notes Guaracco appropri-
ated with as cordial a speech oi
thanks as though I had done them
expressly for him. I might have pro-
tested but near at hand loitered the
uglier of his two dwarfs—and there
might have been even a greater dan-
ger at the window behind me or
hidden among the tapestry folds at
my elbow.

  So I gave over writing and went
to talk to Lisa, the sober but lovely
young girl to whom he had intro-
duced me the night before. I found
her still shyly friendly, possessed of
unfailing good manners and charm.
She had needlework to do and I sat
talking and listening, fascinated by
the play of her deft white fingers.
While we were together I, at least,
felt less the sense of being a prisoner
and an underling.

  But the rain had ceased by sunset
and early the next morning Guaracco
knocked at my door to call out that
we would go to Florence immediately
after breakfast. We ate quickly and
went out into the fine early sunlight.
Servants—Guaracco had several in
a nearby cottage, peculiar fellows
but deeply devoted to him—brought
around horses, a fine white stallion
for Guaracco and an ordinary bay
for me. I mounted, being glad that
I had not forgotten how to ride, and
we cantered off along a clay-hard-

ened highway with a groom on a
patient mule behind us.

  We had not far to ride to Florence.
I found the valley of the Arno much
the same as I had known it in my
former existence, green and bounded
by hills, sprinkled with villas, clus-
ters of peasant huts and suburbs,
with the town in the middle.

FLORENCE itself was smaller,
newer, more beautiful. The town
lay secure amid high battlemented
walls of stone, with the river run-
ning through. I saw the swell of the
Duomo, second cathedral of all
Christendom, great and round and
pale, like the Moon descended to
Earth—and around it, the towers of
many white houses and palaces, the
cool green of garden trees.

  The gate we entered was perhaps
twenty-five feet wide by fifteen high
and the tall lintel of gray-brown
stone bore a bas-relief of St. Mark’s
lion, complete with wings and book.
Also several female figures which
appeared to have tails.

  Within the walls the town I had
known as grubbily ancient in the
twentieth century shone all new and
fresh. By the clean whiteness of the
houses and by their style of archi-
tecture I judged that all or nearly
all of the older Florence had been
razed to allow this new Renaissance
capital of the Medici its full glory.

  The streets were for the most part
smoothly paved or at least had good
gutters and cobbles. Some of them,
the side ways, were too narrow even
for one-way traffic, were darRly close
with the upper stories of the houses
projecting. In many places these
upper stories jutted out so far as to
make a covered way for pedestrians
at either side. Here and there stood
the enclosed mansions and gardens
of nobles or wealthy merchants and
at many crossings were wide
squares, adorned occasionally with
the statue of a saint or hero.

  Many folk were afoot or on horse-
back though there were few wains

and these of the most primitive. Most
of the transport was done by donkey
pannier or in baskets on the brawny
shoulders of porters. The people
seemed prosperous and in most cases
happy. Later I was to be reminded
that the Florentines then enjoyed a
unique freedom and were wont to
boast about it to less-favored Mila-
nese or Venetians.

  At last, at Guaracco’s signal, we
reined our animals before a tall
barnlike structure of drab stone,
fronting away from the brink of the
green Arno. It was several stories
high, pierced with many barred win-
dows and furnished with a double
do6r of iron grillwork.

  “This is Verrocchio’s bottega,”
said my guide and we dismounted,
leaving our bridle-ends in the hands
of the silent groom.

  I moved toward the door but
Guaracco’s big hand touched my el-
bow. I turned inquiringly.

  “Before you enter here, I have a
thought to burn into you,” he said
in a cold, hushed voice.

  With his deep, penetrating eyes,
his red beard and suddenly sinister
face, he might have sat for a tradi-
tional portrait of Judas. I knew,
more fiercely than ever, a dislike and
distrust of him.

  “You wish to exact a vow of fealty
from me?” I suggested. “Vows be-
gin, Ser Guaracco, only when hope is
dead.”

  He shook his head and under his .
beard his mouth wriggled like a
snake in singed grass. “No,” he re-
plied. “I exact no vow. I say simply
that if you betray me in word or
deed, if you seek ever to hurt or to
hinder me—if, in short, you do not
adhere to the services I have set you
then will I see that you die by the
foulest death ever invented.”

  “I am not afraid of you,” I said
to him, striving in my heart to make
this the truth.

  “Nor do I seek your fear,” was his
quick rejoinder. “Only your under-
standing. Shall we go in?”
TWICE IN TIME

THE great front room of the
academy was as large as a riding
hall, with high musty beams on the
ceiling and whitewashed walls, not
as light as one might wish to paint
by but with the windows all set
toward clear open ground. The cor-
ners of the room were cluttered with
art materials, plaster molds, half-
finished paintings on planks, broken
chairs, pots of paint, sheafs of
brushes, rolled parchments and can-
vases.

 Three or four young men in
shabby smocks stopped their various
tasks to gaze curiously at me—stu-
dents, I supposed them to be. And
from behind a counterlike bench at
the door a man greeted Guaracco.

  “Good morrow, Ser Andrea,” said
my patron. “I said once that I would

watch out for a likely pupil for you.

Here is one—my own Cousin Leo.”
The master of the bottega came
from behind his bench. He was a
spidery little fellow of forty or there-
abouts, clad in a long gown of dark
wool like a priest’s, with ill-fitting
worn slippers on his flat feet. His
face was beardless, white and puffy
and he wore spectacles low upon his
snub nose. His hair, already gray,
had begun to grow thin on top. His
finest features were his big, wise
eyes and his slender delicate hands.*
Guaracco praised me highly and
finally produced my drawings. An-
drea Verrocchio carried them into
the light and looked at them narrow-
ly with pursed lips. Finally he
turned his spectacles upon me.

  “You draw well, boy,” he com-
mented. “Drawing is the father of
all the arts. Would you learn to
paint?”

  I told him quite truthfully that it
was my ambition.

  “If you study with me,” he ad-
monished, “you must work entirely
as I devise.”

  “To devise is the work of the
master,” I said, respectfully. “To
execute is the work of the appren-
tice."

  “Well worded.” He nodded, and
smiled a trifle. “Come here—look at
this picture.”

  He beckoned us across the room.
Against the rear wall hung a size-
able sheet of wood, held in place on
a sort of scaffold with cords and pins.
Upon this had been painted but not
finished an oil of the baptism of
Jesus. Some of the figures were exe-
cuted with spirit and intelligence
but over one of them, a kneeling
angel, I could not but shake my head,

  “You see the fault,” murmured
Andrea Verrocchio beside me. “The
draperies, Ser Leo, are not properly
done.”

  “They are not, sir,” I agreed after
a careful examination.

  He smiled slowly. The students too
had gathered with us. I had a sense
of their critical suspicion. Perhaps
they had worked at the thing and
failed.

  “Peradventure, boy, you can
better it,” suggested Verrocchio in
a tone that was full of superior
doubt.

  “May I use these paints?” I in-
quired, stooping to some pots and
brushes at the foot of the frame-
work.

  As I did so I caught a glimpse of
Guaracco’s face, set in an easy smile.
For all his strange menacing nature
he at least trusted my skill.

  “Drapery is a science worth close
study,” I lectured the group as I
mixed some colors upon a rectangu-
lar palette board. “The part of the
fold which is furthest from the ends
where it is confined”—I pointed with
my brush at the fringe of the angel’s
robe—“will return most closely to
its original extended condition.”

  One student snickered at- my
words. “Show us what you mean by
these words,” Verrocchio said.

  “With your leave I shall try.” I
accepted his challenge and began to
dash on my paint. Here was another
old skill I had not lost. “Everything
naturally desires to remain in its
own state,” I elaborated. “Drapery
desires to lie flat. If it is caught into
folds or pleats thus”—and I exe-
cuted a crumpled crease upon the
knee of the angel—“it is forced to
quit this .condition of flatness and
obeys the law of this force in that
part where it is most constrained.”
I progressed to the hem.

  “The part furthest away from
such constraint,” I went on, “you
will find returns most nearly to its
original state—that is to say, lying
extended and full.”

  “You say truth, Ser Leo, and you
paint truth too.” Verrocchio com-
mended me warmly and turned
quickly to Guaracco. “Your kinsman
stays here as my pupil and helper. Go
forward with that drapery, young
sir. When you are finished, the pic-
ture can have no further improve-
ment.”*

I WORKED away, caring little for
the jealous staring of my fellow
students. Meanwhile, Guaracco’s
groom brought in a bundle of cloth-
ing for me and Guaracco himself
gave me a bag of clinking coins.

  “I have paid the charge for your
education, Cousin,” he said to me.
“Stay here, live and work here, and
do me credit. Do not forget what I
require from you according to our
recent conversations. I shall keep an
eye and ear upon you. I may even
take a house to be near you. Again I
say—do not forget.”

  And with this equivocal farewell
he strolled out, the very picture of a
kindly and helpful kinsman.

 *A painting that fits this description, and that
might be the same, exists today in Florence. It
is certain that the draperie* of the kneeling angel
are done more skilfully than those of the other
figures.
TWICE IN TIME

31

  So 1 became a pupil of Andrea del
Verrocchio, the finest, teacher of arts
in Florence. I made the acquaintance
of my fellow students and found
them not at all bad fellows, some in-
deed quite adept at their work. I had
a cell-like room with pallet bed nnd
table and chest of art materials. I
listened dutifully to the Drecepts of
our instructor and und°r his tutelage
did many kinds of work.

  Verrocchio’s aptitude and taste
were for sculpture °r»d though I
thought this less intellectual than
painting, for it cannot represent
transparent or yielding things, I did
not rebel.

  My first p;ece of finished work, a
gold ornament for the King of Portu-
gal, was called splendid by Verroc-
chio. He let me help him with the
great bronze busts he was fashioning
for the palace of the Medici, later
let me execute alone a series of orna-
mental shields of painted wrood for a
wealthy merchant.

  In the evenings and sometimes in
the daytime wrhen work was slack, I
was permitted to go with my felloAV
students through the streets. I could
never weary myself with the sights
and sounds and smells of Florence.

  I loved the pageantry of the main
thoroughfares—laden beasts, pro-
cessions of armed men going from
one sentry post to another, occa-
sional rich coaches of the great or
wealthy, cavaliers on prancing
horses, veiled ladies in mule-litters.
Rougher but still picturesque guilds-
men, artisans, beggars, burghers.
An occasional captain of merce-
naries, a condottiero, slashed and
swaggering, his long sword sheath
hoisting up the hem of his mantle.
Criers loudly acclaiming their wares
of fruit, fish, wine or whatnot.

  On the poorer narrower streets
there were hucksters and small
tradesmen with baskets and trays—
and bevies of bright-eyed girls on
the lookout for romantic adventure.
There were palaces to see in the
wider spaces and the great sculp-

tured bridges across the Arno. Too
there were pleasant cheap taverns,
where young men might get good
wine and plenty for copper coins.

  So it went for the month of May.
Twice during that time Guaracco
called to talk to me in honeyed pro-
testations of concern over the wel-
fare of his supposed cousin. But be-
tween the plea.^an^ lines of his con-
versation my inner ear could dis-
tinguish the warning and insistence
of his power over me.

  Once he remarked that Lisa—
“You remember our little Lisa!”—
had sent me her warm regards. I
found mvself heartilv grateful for
that brief mesrage from one who
had treated me fairly and kindly.

  The first of June dawned bright
and sultry hot. I was up betimes,
putting the last touches to an im-
provement on the scaffolding which
served Verrocchio as an easel for
extra-large pictures. I fitted its cords
to pulleys and winches so that the
artist, instead of moving from one
place to another, could hold a certain
position with advantageous lights
and viewpoints while he lowered the
picture itself or lifted it or moved it
from side to side at his will.

  In the midst of my work a boy
came in from the street. He ap-
proached and said very softly that he
had a message.

  “A message?” I demanded, turn-
ing. “For whom?”

  The little fellowr bowed. “For you,
Ser Leo. I am ordered to conduct you
to a place in the next street.”

  “How do you know my name?” I
asked, and looked sharply at him.
Then I saw that it was no boy but the
dwarf wrho had once opened Guarac-
co’s door to me and whom I had then
mistaken for a handsome child.

  “Come,” he persisted. “You are
awaited.”

  Turning from my work I asked
Verrocchio if I might be excused for
a few moments. He glanced up from
the bench where he and two other
students were studying the plans of
32	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

a chapel and nodded his permission.

  “Is it Guaracco who waits to see
me?” I asked the dwarf as we
emerged from the bottega into the
sticky sunlight—but he smiled mys-
teriously and shook his little head.

WE WALKED along the street,
my guide trotting in front, and
turned a corner. There at the brink
of the river was a small dwelling
house surrounded by a green garden.

  “Go in,’Ser Leo,” the dwarf bade
me and ran around to the back with
the nimble suddenness of a dog.

  Left alone, I knocked at the door.
There was no answer and I pushed
down the latch and went in.

  I found myself in a cool, dark hall,
paneled in wood. On a leather-cush-
ioned sofa sat Lisa, the ward of
Guaracco. Her feet were pressed
close together under the hem of her
wide skirt and her hands were
clasped in her lap. About her whole
attitude there was an air of tense
embarrassed expectancy. She looked
up as I came in, then quickly dropped
her gaze, making no answer to my
surprised greeting.

  As I came farther into the room,
approaching the girl, a pale oblong
caught my eye—a folded paper, ly-
ing on a little round center table.
Upon it were written three large
letters: LEO

  “Is this for me?” I asked Lisa,
who only bowed her head the lower.
I began to catch something of her
embarrassment. “Your pardon for
a moment,” I requested and opened
the paper. The letter was brief and
to the point. It read:

  My dear adopted Kinsman,

  You have thus far pleased me
much and I have high hopes of
great advantage from your acquaint-
ance and endeavor. It occurs to me
to make you a present.

  In the short time you were my
guest, you saw my ward, Lisa. She
likes you and you are not averse to
her society. Take her, therefore, and

I wish you joy of each other.

              From

                   Guaracco

CHAPTER V
The Gift of Guaracco

THE first sentence of the letter
astonished me beyond measure.
The last had two effects, overwhelm-
ing and sudden in succession, like the
reports of a double-barreled gun.

  For my primary impulse was to
rejoice, to be glad and thankful.
Why had I never realized that I loved
Lisa? Thinking of her now, how
could I help but love her? But my
second reaction was one of horrified
knowledge of what Guaracco meant
by such a gift.

  “Lisa, fair mistress,” I said, “this
letter—you know what it says?”

  She nodded, and the living rose
touched her ivory skin.

“It cannot be,” I told her soberly.

  “Cannot?” she repeated, no louder
than a sigh. It might have been a
protest, it might have been an agree-
ment.

  I overcame an impulse to fall on
one knee before her like any melo-
dramatic courtier of that unre-
strained age and land.

  “Lisa,” I said again, desperately
choosing my words, “first of all let
me say that I am deeply moved by
the mere thought of winning you.
Guaracco appears to mean what he
says and you appear ready to con-
sent.” Watching her I saw the trem-
bling of her lips. “But I cannot take
you at his hands, Lisa.”

  At last she looked me full in the
face. She too began to comprehend.

  “That subtle wizard, Guaracco,”
I went on, growing warm to the out-
rage he would wreak, “tries to rule
us both by fear. He sees that he is
not successful. We yield slowly, bid-
ing our time, for orders are orders
TWICE IN TIME	33

 until there comes strength for dis-
 obedience. And so he seeks to rule
 us by happiness. Confess it. Lisa.
 For a moment you too would have
 wanted love between us !”

    She gave me her sweet little smile
 with unparted lips, but shyness and
 restraint covered her again and she
 did not answer me.

   “We cannot Lisa,” I said earnest-
 , ly. “It might be sweet and for me at
 least it would be the easiest course
 in the world. But Guaracco’s touch
 upon our love—-heaven forefend that
 we be obligated to him!”

   “Eloquently said, Leo, my kins-
 man !”

   It was the voice of Guaracco. I
 spun quickly around, ready to strike
 out at him. But he was not there.
 Only his laughter, like the whinny-
 ing of a very cunning and wicked
 horse, was there, combing the empty
 air of the room.

   “Do not strive against nothing-
 ness, young hero,” his words admon-
 ished me out of nowhere, “and do
 not anguish me by spurning my poor
 tender ward. She loves you, Leo,
 and you have just shown that you
 love her.”

   Such words made it impossible for
 me to look at Lisa and therefore I
 looked the harder for Guaracco. In
 the midst of his mockery I located
 the direction of the sound. He spoke
 from the room's very center and I
 moved in that direction.

   At once he fell silent but I had
 come to a pause beneath the point
 where the final syllable still echoed,
 almost in my ear. I glared around
 me, down and upward.

    A cluster of lamps hung just above
 my head, held by several twisted
 cords to the ceiling. Among the
 cupped sconces I spied what I sus-
 pected—a little open cone of metal
 like a funnel. I am afraid that I
 swore aloud, even in Lisa’s presence,
 when I saw and knew the fashion of
 Guaracco’s ghostly speaking. But I
 also acted. With a single lunge and
 grasp I leapt to grasp the lamps and

pulled with ail my strength.

  They came away and fell crashing,
but not they alone. For with them
came a copper tube that had been
suspended from cords and concealed
there. I tore it from its place in the
ceiling. Beyond that ceiling, I knew,
another tube went to the lips of Gua-
racco, in hiding. I cast the double
handful of lamps upon the planks
of the floor.

  Once again Guaracco laughed but
this time from behind me in the room
itself. Again I turned. A panel of
the woodwork had swung outward
and the man himself stepped
through, all black velvet and flaming
beard and sneering smile.

  “You are a quick one,” he re-
marked. “I have fooled many a wise
old grandfather with that trick.”

  I gathered myself to spring.
“Nay, Leo,’’ he warned me quickly.
“Do nothing violent, nothing that
you would not have set down as your
last act on earth.” His hand lifted
and in it w^as leveled a pistol, mas-
sively but knowingly made. I stared
for a moment, forgetting my rage
and protest at his villainous match-
making. Surely pistols were not in-
vented so early.

  “It is of my own manufacture,”
he informed me as though he read
my mind. “Though short, it throws
a ball as hard and as deep as the
longest arquebus in Christendom.
Do not force me to shoot you, kins-
man.” His lips writhed scornfully
over the irony of our pretended re-
lationship.

  “Shoot if you will,” I bade him.
“I have said to Lisa and I also say to
you that I shall not be led by love
into your deeper hateful service.”
He shook his rufous head with a
great show of melancholy. “Alas,
young Cousin! You do great and un-
deserved w'rong to Lisa and to me.
Only this morning she was disposed
to thank me for the thought, to scan
by way of rehearsal the marriage
service. Ah, I have it!” He laughed
aloud.
34	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

  “You do not think that a poor art
student like yourself can support a
wife and household." He held out
his free hand, as warmly smiling as
any indulgent father. “Take no fur-
ther thought of it. I myself shall
provide a suitable dowry for the
bride.”

EVEN poor wretched Lisa ex-
claimed in disgust at his evil
humor and I started forward sud-
denly, coming so close to Guaracco
that I found the hard muzzle of his
pistol digging into the pit of my
stomach.

  “Back,” he commanded, with quiet
menace. “Back, I say, at once! That
is better. What fantastic objection
have you to raise this time?”

  “You add money to beauty and
love in the effort to buy me!” I cried
thoroughly disgusted. “Dowry! A
bribe to marriage! Oh, you are in-
famous ! Surely we are living in the
last days of the world!” I flung wide
my arms, as though in invitation of
a shot. “Kill me, Guaracco! You
said once that you would kill me if
I disobeyed you. Well, I disobey, and
with my last breath I do name you
a sorry scoundrel!”

 He shook his head and moved
back. “No,” he demurred gently.
“Perhaps, after all, the fault was
mine. I was too abrupt for your
dainty nature, Leo.” He turned his
eyes but not his head toward the un-
happy Lisa, where she sat in mute
and woeful confusion. “Forgive this
ungallant fellow, my child. Perhaps
another time—”

  “There shall be no other time,” I
said flatly. “I refuse once and for
all.”

  “Then go,” Guaracco bade me and
he simulated a bored yawn. “You
have disappointed me and shamed
Lisa. Return to your labors among
the arts and when your heart is
cooler we shall talk again. Go.”

  I went and my nature was more
fiery hot than the waxing sun over-
head.

  Guaracco had spoken this much
truth. I had brought shame to Lisa.
Apparently she had been ready to
accept me as a mate and whether
this was at Guaracco’s hypnotic sug-
gestion or not made little difference
in the way my reaction must have
affected her. She had come to meet
me, hoping to hear my praises and
pledges, to stand with me before a
priest.

  Undoubtedly she understood my
refusal to be her lover but could I
not have been more kindljr toward
her? Could I not have said, paren-
thetically, that it was in reality Gua-
racco I refused, that on some happier
occasion . . . Like many a man leav-
ing a stormy center I was aware of
fully a score of things I should have
said and done.

  I was also aware that I loved
Lisa. There was no getting away
from that even when I tried to say
that it was all Guaracco’s adroit sug-
gestion, that he might have hypno-
tized me as well as Lisa from the
first day he had introduced us to
each other.

  Conjectures about it were only
the more disturbing. Finally I gave
up the struggle against my new
realization. I loved Lisa and prob-
ably I had lost her. There was noth-
ing I could do about it, I told myself,
as I drew near to the bottega, turned
my footsteps to enter at the door.

  A final glow of rage swelled all
through me. I yearned wildly for an
opportunity to catch Guaracco off
guard, to strike and throttle him. A
mood, rare in me, made my heart
and body thirst for violent action.

  As Fate would have it, violent ac-
tion was about to be provided for
my needs.

  A horseman came cantering along
the street. His horse, a handsome
gray, spurned a loose stone from its
place among the cobbles. Another
moment and the beast had stumbled
and fallen, throwing its rider head-
long.

  A crowd of strolling pedestrians
TWICE IN TIME	35

within view of the mishap all hur-
ried close, myself among- them. My
hand went out to lift the sprawling
man but with a grunt and an oath
he had scrambled to his feet and was
tugging at the bridle of his horse.
It would not rise.

   “The beast is hurt,” I suggested.

  “Not this devil-begotten nag,”
growled the rider. He dragged on
the bridle again, then kicked the ani-
mal’s gray ribs with his sharp-toed
boot.

  Harshness to animals has never
pleased me and, as I have said, my
anger was ready to rise at anything.
I shouted immediate and strong pro-
test. The man turned upon me. He
was tall and sturdy with a forked
black beard and two square front
teeth showing under a short upper
lip. He wore a long sword under his
cloak of brown silk and had the look
of a tough customer.

  “Do not meddle between me and
my horseflesh,” he snapped and once
more heaved at the bridle.

  The injured horse struggled up
at last, driving the little crowd back
on all sides, and the master laughed
shortly. “Did I not say he was un-
hurt? Belly of Bacchus, it was his
careless foot that threw us—curse it
and him!”

  He clutched the bit of the poor
beast, and struck it across the face
with his riding whip.

  “Stop that!” I shouted and caught
his arm. He tried to pull loose but
I was as strong as he. A moment
later he had released the horse,
which a passerby seized by the reins,
and cut at me with the whip. My
left hand lashed out, as quick as im-
pulse. It smote solidly on those two
front teeth and the man-at-arms
staggered back with a roar.

  I would have struck again, per-
haps stretching him on the cobbles,
had not Andrea del Verrocchio him-
self, running from his door, thrown
his arms around me. Meanwhile the
black-bearded man had whipped out
his sword and, swearing in a blood-

curdling manner, was struggling to
throw off two voluble peacemakers
and get at me.

  “Have you gone mad, boy?” Ver-
rocchio panted in my ear. “That is
Gido, the first swordsman of Lor-
enzo’s palace guard!”

CHAPTER VI
Swords Beside the River

WHEN I say that I did not flinch
at Verrocchio’s warning I do not
call myself brave—only possessed by
a white heat of anger. For a moment
I made as if to rush fairly upon the
point of Gido’s sword. But a saving
ounce of wit returned to me.

  My eye caught a gleam at the hip
of one of the growing throng of
watchers. I made a long leaping
stride at the fellow and before he
knew I was there I had clutched and
plucked away his long straight blade.

  “Thank you, friend,” I said to him
hastily. “I will return this steel when

I have settled accounts with Ser Gido
the ruffier.”

  Gido was roaring like a profane
bull. He cursed me by every holy
Christian name and some that
smacked of the classic Greek and
Roman. But by now I had recovered
my own self-possession sufficiently
to make me recognize my danger and
face it. I thrust away Verrocchio’s
pleading hands and interrupted Gido
in the middle of a sulphurous rodo-
montade.

  “You talk too loudly for a fighting
man,” I told him. “Come, I am no
burgher. Let him go, you good peo-
ple. He needs blood-letting to ease
his hot temper.”

  “There shall be blood-letting
enough and to spare!” the palace
guardsman promised me balefully.

  Verrocchio pleaded that there be
no brawl outside his house but Gido
loudly claimed that there must be a
WONDER STORY ANNUAL

back courtyard where we could have
quiet for our work. And, with the
crowd clamoring and pushing after
us, to that back courtyard we went
through a little gate at the side of
the bottega.

  There was a level space flagged
with stones at the grassy brink of
the Arno. All the spectators jammed
close to the walls of the house and
its paling at the sides while my ad-
versary and myself stood free near
the water.

  Gido gave me a quick businesslike
scrutiny that had something in it of
relish—the sort of gaze that a carver
might bestow upon a roast. With a
quick flirt of his left arm he wound
his brown cloak around his elbow to
serve as buckler.

  “I will teach you to defy your
betters, Master Paint-smearer!” he
promised.

  “Teach on!” I urged him. “I may
be a good enough pupil to outshine
my teacher.”

  All this time I was telling myself
to be calm, ruthless and wide-awake,
that I must not fear the raw point.
I had done some fencing in prep
school and at my university and it
was another thing that I remem-
bered fairly well, with my hand if
not my head. I felt that I had a cer-
tain advantage too in being left-
handed.

  We moved toward each other by
common consent, gingerly taking the
stylized paper-doll pose of fencers.
As my left hand advanced my sword,
Gido saw that he would have trouble
shielding himself with that wadded
cloak.

  “Fortune favors the right,” he
muttered and his square front teeth
gleamed with pleasure at his own
pun.

  For answer I made a quick simple
attack. It was no more than a feel-
ing thrust and he swept it aside with
an easy shifting of his straight
blade. At once I made a recovery,
ready to parry his riposte.

  The riposte did not come. Instead

this crack swordsman of the Medici
tried to beat down my weapon and
so clear the way for a stab at my
breast. I yielded a little before his
pressure, disengaged, parried in
turn, dropped back. Another of his
slashing assaults I only half-broke
with my edge and felt the delicate
st.ing of his edge upon my left fore-
arm.

  “First blood!” yelled one of the
watchers and a little cheer went up
for my enemy. The Florentines were
enjoying the sport.

  But I was not injured as far as
my activity was concerned. As Gido
rushed to follow his advantage I was
able to parry cleanly. Immediately,
while he was yet extended in his
forward lunge and well within reach,
I sped my riposte. It caught him un-
prepared and he barely flung up his
cloak-swaddled left arm in time.

  Through half a dozen thicknesses
of brown cloth my edge bit its way.
Gido swore as his blood sprang out
to dye the fabric a deep red.

  “He who bleeds last bleeds long-
est,” I paraphrased and made a
sweeping slash on my own account.

  Gido had to spring all the way
back to escape and upon his face
dawned an expression of perplexed
concern.

  Was this the best swordsman that
the Medici could send against a raw
student of the arts? I felt a little
perplexity on my own account. Gido
had the look and, with Verrocchio at
least, the reputation of a seasoned
fighter. Yet he was doing no more
than enough to hold his own against
my sword. He had missed a chance
to riposte at my first attack and a
moment later he had been foolishly
open to my own riposte.

AS OUR blades grated together
again I found the answer in my
own semi-obscured memory. Riposte,
that was it—or rather the lack of
riposte. The movement, the counter-
attack made when your opponent's
thrust has been parried and he has-

not yet recovered, is in great meas-
ure instinctive. But in these Renais-
sance times it was not rationalized,
was not yet made a definite pseudo-
reflex of swordplay.* I, knowing the
formal science of it, had a great ad-
vantage. I could win by it.

  “Fight, you knave!” I taunted
Gido as my steel pressed against his.
'Til cut you into flitches like a pig.”

  Again he thrust wildly in his
angry terror and again I warded.
Then, with a quick straightening of
my arm, I touched him before he
could recover. My point snagged his
bearded cheek and a great thread of
gore showed. This time the onlookers
cheered for me.

  Gido retreated once more, two
paces this time. His face frankly
showed terror. “He is a devil,” he
choked out. “He knows a seeret

thrust. Unfair!”

  “I will show my secret, drive it
to your heart,” I growled back,
pressing forward after him. “Fight,
man, or I will butcher you!”

  He tried for a moment to oppose
me, then fled again from my menac-
ing point. Now that his nerve was
gone he could barely hold up his
sword.

  “I cannot stand against you,” he
mumbled wretchedly.

  “Show him mercy,” called Ver-
rocchio to me and I half lowered my
weapon.

  Gido saw and struck. Only a quick
recovery of my guard saved my life.
I roared wordlessly and sprang upon
him. My first sweeping slash he par-
ried, the second almost cut away
his left arm. He staggered back and
tried unsuccessfully to hold off my
long point thrust but I got home
deep between his ribs. Pulling away

he ran like a boy caught stealing
fruit and I ran after him.

  He gained the gate that led to the
street, leaning for a moment upon
it. Half a dozen of the onlookers
rushed to bar my way, pleading that
I was already the winner, but my
rage was up again. I struggled
through their arms and after Gido.

  He had gone through the gate,
fallen through it. As I came into
the street with the throng at my
he§ls I almost trod upon my ad-
versary. He lay sprawled across the
curb and into the gutter, his sword
under him, blood gushing from his
mouth and drenching his black
beard. He had only life enough to
grope in his pierced bosom, pull
forth a crucifix of silver and try to
kiss it.

  The fight and the fury went out
of me as I watched him die, for it
was the first violent death I had ever
witnessed. I looked around at the
staring scared faces, saw among
them that of the man whose sword
I had snatched.

  “Take back your weapon,” I said
to him but he drew fearfully away
from me.

  Hoofs were thundering on the
cobblestones. The knot of people
pressed back to the front of the
bottega and let a little cloud of horse-
men approach. A voice shouted com-
mandingly and there was a quick or-
derly dismounting. One of the ar-
mored men stopped to gaze at the
body.

  “Gido!" he grunted. “Slain!”

  “What?” demanded a voice from
behind. “Gido, you say? Who slew
him?”

  Two menj richly dressed, had re-
mained upon their superb horses.
One of them ^reined in almost above
me. He was a handsome dark young-
ster, no older than I, with abundant
curls descending from under his
plumed velvet cap to the shoulders
of his plum-colored howppelande or
gownlike outer garment. His belt,
gloves and boots were embroidered

with massy gold. He stared at the
body of Gido, at me, at the bloody
sword I still held.

  It was the other, sitting his steed
just beyond, who had spoken. He
was also young, tall and rugged with
harpies blazoned richly upon the
breast of his surcoat. His strong
face, framed between sweeps of
straight black hair, had broad fierce-
ly-ugly features. Above the right
corner of his mouth grew a wart.
To me his appearance suggested
something of my former life—a
painting or statue.

  “Gido,” he said again. “My own
peerless Gido—slain!”

  Here upon me had ridden Lorenzo
the Magnificent, absolute ruler of
the city of Florence!*

  And now, the eyes of this great
despot, prince in all but name, had
fastened upon me. Bright deadly
intent flared from them, like fire
from black flint.

  “Is that the assassin?” he de-
manded. “Seize him. some of you.”
I turned toward him. “I am no
assassin, Your Magnificence,” I pro-
tested. “It was a fair fight and this
guardsman of yours forced—”

  But as I began to speak two of the
men in mail and leather moved
swiftly to my right elbow and my
left. The iron gauntlet of one
snatched away my sword and the
other man roughly caught my shoul-
der.

  “Silence!” he growled in my ear.
“Speak when you are spoken to.”
Others of the party were busy
questioning witnesses, who were
many and unfriendly. Lorenzo de
Medici, after favoring me with
another long searching look, turned
away. “Bring that fellow,” he or-
dered my captors.

  “Can you ride?” I was asked and
when I nodded the gray horse of
Gido, the same over which we had
quarreled, was led forward. I

mounted and one of the men-at-arms
caught the bridle reins in the crook
of his arm. The other sidled his
horse against me.

  “Come," he said. “You are going
to prison. If you try to escape, if
you but move as though to leave us”
—his voice grew harder still—“my
sword will shed your tripes upon the
street.”

CHAPTER VII
Lorenzo the Magnificent

LORENZO and his handsome com-
panion had ridden on. Behind
him rode his retinue, one of them
with Gido’s limp body across his
saddlebow. I myself, on the gray,
brought up the rear with the two
guards.

  As we departed I glanced back at
the bottega. The crowd was moving
and murmuring and in its midst
stood Andrea de Verrocchio, staring
after me through his spectacles.

 We had not ridden much more
than two miles and had made few
turns before our little procession en-
tered a great paved yard before a
white stone palace. A groom ap-
peared to lead away the horses of
Lorenzo and his companion while
the soldiers rode around to a guard-
house at the rear, leading me with
them.

  Through a small barred door I was
ushered into the palace building,
then through a hallway in which
stood a sentry in breastplate and
steel cap. Finally I was escorted
into a small room, finished in great
rough stones and with a single iron-
latticed window. It had one stool,
no carpet and no table.

  “Await here your punishment,”
one of my captors bade me and I was
locked in.

  I waited. There was nothing to
do but think, nothing to think but

doleful thoughts. My victory over
the bully swordsman, mingled as it
was with luck and knowledge from
another century, had brought me not
fame but disaster. Lorenzo de Medici
himself had seen fit to notice me—
and with anger. I knew well that this
scion of a great and unscrupulous
race had the power of life and death
in Florence and that in my case the
power of death was more apt to be
exercised than the power of life.

  To be sure I had been drawn on
first, had fought only in self-defense.
But what judge would hear me?
Lorenzo, who through me had lost
a valued servant. What jury would
ponder my case? No jury. I might
not be allowed to speak in my own
defense even. A nod, a word—and I
would be condemned to death with
nobody to question or to mourn.

  Nobody? What about Lisa? But
I had to put her from my mind.

  Thus I mused in the blackest of
humors until a faint stirring sound
at the window made me lift my eyes.
A small childlike face hung there—
the face of the deceptively handsome
dwarf of Guaracco.

  He cautioned me to silence with a
tiny finger on his lips, then, with the
utmost suppleness and skill, thrust
his wisp of a body between the iron
bars. How even so small a creature
could-do it I have no idea—but in
two seconds he stood in front of me,
smoothing out the wrinkles of his
little surcoat.

  “What do you here ?” I demanded.

  “It was easy.” He chuckled. “By
a vine I swung from the street and
over the wall. In a tuft of brambles
I lurked until the sentry walked by.
I am here with a message from Ser
Guaracco, your master and mine.”

  “Well?” I prompted, a faint hope
wakening in me. Guaracco had
claimed some influence. Perhaps he
was bestirring himself on my be-
half.

  “The message,” said the dwarf,
“is this—hanging is an easy death
and a swift one.”
40

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

  “Hanging?” I echoed. “I am to be
hanged ?”

  “Perhaps.” The little head wagged
wisely. “That is the punishment for
brawlers and killers in hot blood.
But there are other punishments.”
He smiled up impudently. “A witch,
a devil’s apostle, for instance, may
be burned at the stake. By compari-
son a sorry end.”

  I grew ironic myself. “Your rid-
dles become easy to read, imp,” I
said. “Ser Guaracco is anxious that
I make no claims of coming to him
miraculously—that I say nothing of
being nourished and ordered to as-
sist him in his intrigues.”

  “They breed quick minds where
you come from,” said the dwarf.

  “Go back,” I told him, “and say
that I know his selfish reason but
that his advice is good. I will not in-
volve him in my ruin. Better to hang
than to burn.”

THE little fellow nodded quickly,
turned and wriggled out between
the bars like a lizard. Time wore on,
and I felt weary and hungry. Final-
ly, pushing my stool back so that I
could lean in the corner, I dozed off.
A rough voice awakened me.

  “God’s wounds, knave, you do
slumber at the very lip of death!
Rise and come with me. Lorenzo the
Magnificent has sent for you.”

  I got to my feet and rubbed my
eyes. Night had come and I walked
out of my dark cell toward the light
held at the open door. Two men in
steel-mounted leather waited, a
bristle-bearded captain and a lanky
swordsman with a -scarred cheek.

  Between them I walked away into
a long hall, around a corner, across
an open courtyard—it was a clear
starrv night overhead—and into a
building bevond. A sentry chal-
lenged us in the arras-hung vestibule
we entered. At an explanatory word
from the bearded captain he waved
us on through a curtained doorway.

  The room in which we came to a
halt was not spacious but lofty,

lighted by no less than eight lamps
on tables and brackets or hung by
chains from the groined ceiling. The
walls were frescoed with scenes and
figures of Grecian mythology and
the floor was richly carpeted.

  At a table of polished ebony with
inlaid borders and figures of ivory
sat Lorenzo de Medici in a magnifi-
cent dove-gray houppelande with
furred neck and wrists. His ugly
face was toward us. Beside him was
stationed a scribe or secretary in the
hooded gown of a monk, busy with
pen and ink.

  But. standing before the table
with back toward us was a long,
spare man with a red pate. He
could be none but Guaracco. And he
was speaking as we entered in the
gentle, plausible manner he could
affect so well. “Magnificence,” he
was saying smoothly, “if to be re-
lated to the young man is a crime I
must plead guilty. It is true that I
arranged for his education, as Ser
Andrea Verrocchio testified before
you just now. But concerning this
butchery of your poor servant I must
say that I have no reaction save
surprise and sorrow.”

  He was clearing his skirts of me
then.

  Lorenzo leaned back in his chair
of state. It was a square-made arm-
chair of massive carved wood.

  “I wonder, I wonder,” the ruler of
Florence almost crooned. His eyes
probed Guaracco like sharp points
and if anything could unsettle the
sorcerer-scientist’s aplomb it would
be such a regard. “It is possible,”
continued Lorenzo, “that you as-
sirmed him to the task of murdering
Gido? But here is the young man
himself. His story may be reveal-
ing.”

  The captain who had brought me
now thrust me forward with a push
of thick knuckles in my back. Loren-
zo’s eves met mine and I returned
him as level a stare as possible.

  “Stand aside, Guaracco,” com-
manded Lorenzo. “Now, young man,
TWICE IN TIME

your name?”

  “Leo Thrasher,” I replied.

  “Leo—what?” Lorenzo shook his
head over my surname, which all
Italians have found difficult. The
clerk, pen in hand, asked me how to
spell it.

  “A barbarous cognomen, which
bespeaks the barbarous fellow," re-
marked Lorenzo sententiously.
“What defense have you to offer?”
“Only that I did not murder your
guardsman but killed him in a fair
fight.” I made respectful reply.

GUARACCO, standing against the
wall, gave me a little nod of ap-
proval and drew in his lips as though
to council prudence.

  Lorenzo turned and took several
sheets of writing from his monkish
companion. “According to the testi-
mony of others you were the aggres-
sor,” said he. “You interfered and
struck him after he had fallen from
his horse.”

  “He flogged the beast cruelly,” I
protested. “I used my bare fist upon
him and he drew his sword. I say
I but defended myself.”

  “Do not contradict His Magnifi-
cence,” the middle-aged clerk cau-
tioned me bleakly.

  “And do not traduce the name of
poor dead Gido,” added Lorenzo. His
eyes still raked me. “I have lost a
good servant in him.”

  “Perhaps,” I said, on sudden in-
spiration, “I can make good his
loss.”

  “How?” exclaimed Lorenzo, and
his black eyes narrowed. “As a
swordsman in my guard? But Gido
had conquered hundreds.”

  “I conquered Gido,” I reminded
him despite the fact that Guaracco
was signaling again for prudence.
Lorenzo saw those signals and
turned in his chair.

  “Ha, Guaracco, by the bones of the
saints! I do begin to understand it.
You’ll have planned that this crea-
ture of yours might rise on the dead
shoulders of his victim and be taken

into my service as an invincible
blade. Then, being near me and my-
self unguarded—,r

  “As heaven is my judge, this is
not my doing!” exclaimed Guarac-
co, unstrung at last.

  I spoke again, to save myself and
him too. “If I cannot be trusted
to guard Your Magnificence I have
other worthy gifts.” I thought a
moment, marshaling what latter-day
science my memory still retained.
“I can build bridges. I can make
war machines of various kinds. I
can show you how to destroy
fortresses.”

  “Indeed?” broke in Lorenzo.
“How came you by all this knowl-
edge? More of Guaracco’s doing, I
make no doubt. He is whispered to
be a sorcerer.” Another of his darted
sidelong looks made the tall man
shake violently. “You too, young
man? Death is the severe penalty
for black magic.”

  I recognized defeat and shrugged
my shoulders in exasperation. “I
shall not weary you with further
pleas, Your Magnificence,” I said.
“Call me wizard as well as mur-
derer. I am neither but all are de-
termined to destroy me. As well be
hanged for a sheep as for a lamb.”
The captain at my elbow made a
motion as though to drag me away
but Lorenzo lifted one long white
hand with a many-jeweled ring upon
the forefinger. “Wait! Tell me—
what was that you said?”

  “I said, as well be hanged for a
sheep as for a lamb.”

  “Hanged for a sheep as for a—” A
grin came slowly, as if it did not well
know the way to that rugged face. It
made Lorenzo strangely handsome.
“Neatly said, by Bacchus!” He spoke
to the clerk. “Write that down. Here
we have one gift that was never
won from yonder dull Guaracco.”

  I was stunned at the zest with
which he repeated the cliche. “Why,
Your Magnificence!” I said, wonder -
ingly. “It is but a saying, a hand-
ful of old words.”
42

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

  “Yet the thought is new, a new
thing under the sun. Say on, Leo
the Witty. If you are an assassin
set to kill me your tongue is as
tempered as your sword.”

  He called the phrase new and of
course it was.

  The fifteenth century had never
heard of it before. Every cliche
must have been devastating in its
time.

I GROPED in my mind for an-
other and the works of William
Shakespeare, a good century in the
future, came to my rescue.

  “Since I am graciously permitted
to plead my case once more,” I said,
“let me but remind Your Magnifi-
cence that the quality of mercy is
not strained. It drops as the gentle
rain from heaven upon the earth be-
neath—”

  “Excellent!” applauded Lorenzo.
“Clerk, have you written it all?” He
smiled upon me the more widely and
winningly. “You go free, young sir.
Swordsmen I can buy at a ducat a
dozen but men of good wit and ready
tongue are scarce in these decayed
times. Tomorrow then you shall have
a further audience with me.”

  I bowed myself away, scarce
crediting my good fortune. But as
I walked down the palace stens and
through the gate Guaracco fell into
step beside me.

  Under his half-draped black cloak
I caught the outline of that pistol he
had invented.

  “I have nothing to say to you,” I
growled. “I have washed my hands
of you. And you washed your hands
of me yonder when my life hung by
a thread.”

  “I never pledged myself to you,”
he reminded. “Nor did I demand a
pledge of you—only obedience. In-
stead of death you win favor from
the Medici. When you go back to-
morrow you go under new orders
from me.”

  And thus I was deeper than ever
in his strong wicked clutch.

CHAPTER VIII
The Court of Lorenzo

PERHAPS it is odd and yet not so
odd that I remember no more of
that particular walk, of my warm
disgust at Guaracco’s confident leer,
of his insistence on my aid to him.
It is my fixed belief that during our
conversation he found and took the
opportunity to throw upon me his
hypnotic spell. He could do that al-
most as well as the best twentieth-
century psychologists.

  Walking together thus on the way
to Verrocchio’s bottega, I entranced
and somnambulistic, he alert and
studied, there must have been strong
talking by Guaracco and receptive
listening by me. He must have
planted in my dream-bound mind
that I was his friend and debtor,
that I must share Lorenzo’s favor
with him, Guaracco.

  What' I do remember is the next
afternoon and an equerry from the
palace presenting himself before an
impressed Verrocchio with a mes-
sage summoning me to his master. 1
went, clad in my simple best—the
decent doublet and hose which Gua-
racco had given me on my first
evening at his house, my red mantle
and a flat velvet cap with a long
drooping feather. With a little shock
of pleased astonishment I saw that
the equerry had brought me a horse
—the same fine gray over which I
had fallen out with the late lamented
Gido.

  “The beast is a pi-esent from the
Magnificent,” I was informed as I
mounted.

  To the palace we rode and there,
while my horse was cared for by the
equerry, I was conducted through a
great courtyard to a rich garden
among high hedges of yew, trimmed
to a blocky evenness with nichelike
hollows for stone seats or white
TWICE IN TIME

statues of Grecian style.

  There were roses, both on bushes
and climbing briars, flowering
shrubs in clumps and ordered rows,
a perfectly round little pool with
water lilies—all luxurious and
lovely though perhaps a bit too for-
mally ordered. In the center of this,
under a striped awning, lounged
Lorenzo and his friends on cushioned
seats of gilded wood and leather.

  To the four other guests I was
introduced as Ser Leo. His Magnif-
icence still shied at pronouncing my
barbarous surname. And I bowed
to each as his name was spoken.
First there was Lorenzo’s younger
brother and co-despot, Guiliano, the
same cavalier who had ridden with
Lorenzo upon me at the moment
of Gido’s death. He was one of the
handsomest men I have ever seen,
even as Lorenzo was one of the
ugliest.

  Almost as highly honored was an
elderly churchman with a fine merry
face and plain but rich vestments—
Mariotto Arlotta, the aristocratic
abbot of the woodland monastery
of Camaldoli. His repute, I found,
was that his repartee was the
sharpest and readiest in all the state
of Tuscany and indeed he jested in
a lively though ecclesiastical fashion.

  Close beside him stood a plump
courteous young man in his middle
twenties, Sandro Botticelli, the ris-
ing court painter.* Him I found
friendly though moody.

  The last man of the group and the
youngest was an adolescent poet,
Agnolo Poliziano. Uglier even than
Lorenzo, he was wry-necked,
crooked-mouthed, beak-nosed and
bandy-legged.** Yet for all his
sorry person and ungrown youth, he
was eloquent and thoroughly edu-
cated. From him I was to learn in

  •	Botticelli’s most famous paintings are those
of Glullano's sweetheart, Simonetta Vespucci. He
was a favorite of Florentine society, and a loyal
friend of the Medicls.

  ** Poliziano, in later life, was a tutor to the
children of Lorenzo, and remained In the Medici
household until the death of his patron.

after days much of what a man must
know to shine as cultured in Fif-
teenth-Century Florence.

  “A young sparkle-wit, friends,”
Lorenzo told the others in presenting
me. “He was thrown my way, I noth-
ing doubt, with the thought that he
might assassinate me. Yet am I
drawn to him by the lustrant wis-
dom of his speech. ‘As well hang for
a sheep as for a lamb,’ he defied me
yesterday.”

  He paused while the saying went
around the delighted group from
mouth to merry mouth.

  “If he is dangerous, yet shall I
keep him as I keep the lions at the
Piazza del Signoria. Guard me, all
of you, from any weapon save his
tongue.” Once more he turned to me.
“What of that sorcerer cousin of
yours, Guaracco?”

  To my own surprise I found my-
self pleading earnestly and elo-
quently for Guaracco. It was as if
I had been rehearsed in the task and
indeed I probably was by Guaracco
himself. Hypnotists, I say again,
can do such things. In the end
Lorenzo smiled and seemed far less
ugly.

  “By the mass, I wish my own kins-
men spoke so well on my behalf,”
he said to the others. “Ser Leo,
your eloquence saved you yesterday
and today it recommends Guaracco.
He is dull, I have thought, but he
knows something of science. I am
minded to send for him for all he is
a wizard.”

  “Sorcery cannot prevail against
pure hearts,” contributed the Abbot
Mariotto at which all laughed
heartily.

rpHE equerry who had conducted
A me was dispatched to search for
and bring Guaracco. Meanwhile I
was served with wine by a bold-eyed
maidservant in tight blue silk and
entreated to join the conversation.
It was turning just then on the sub-
ject of a new alliance of the Italian
44	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

powers against possible Turkish in-
vasion.

  “The threat of the infidel comes
at an opportune time,” Lorenzo
pointed out. “Taunted and menaced,
we Christians forget our differences
and draw together for our common
safety. The Sultan dares not attack
us, we dare not quarrel among our-
selves and peace reigns.”*

  “Your Magnificence does not like
war then?” I ventured.

  He shook his ugly crag of a head.
“Not a whit. It is expensive.”
“And vulgar,” added Botticelli.
“Aye, and dangerous,” chimed in
the poet Poliziano.

  “And in defiance of heaven’s will,”
sighed the abbot as though to crown
the matter.

  “And yet,” Lorenzo resumed, “I
bethink me that it is well for a
state to prepare for war that others
may fear and be content to keep
peace. I have it in mind, Ser Leo.
that you spoke yesterday of war en-
gines.”

  “I did,” was my reply, but even as
I spoke I was aware how poorly my
scrambled memory might serve me.
“For instance, I might design a
gun that shoots many times.”

  “Ha, some of Guaracco’s witch-
craft!” exclaimed Lorenzo at once.

  “Not in the least,” I made haste to
say. “Nothing but honest science
and mechanics, may it please Your
Magnificence.”

  In my mind the form and principle
of machine-gunnery became only
half clear. I wished that I had men-
tioned something else.

  But Lorenzo would not be dis-
suaded from knowing all about my
oft-shooting gun. He sent Poliziano
for paper and pencils and ordered
me to draw plans. I made shift in
some fashion to do a picture of a
gun-carriage with wheels, a tail and
a mounting of not one barrel but a
whole row, ten or more.

  •	Lrtirenzo was later able to tiring alw>ut this
alliance both for peace among the Italian powers
and safety from the Moslem raiders.

  “It is nothing of particular bril-
liance,” objected the poet. “A rank
of arquebusiers would serve as well.”
“Aye, but if we have not overmany
ranks of arquebusiers?” countered
Lorenzo and gave me a most gener-
ous smile. “A single man, I think,
could serve and aim and fire this
row of guns. Ten such machines
could offer a full hundred shot. Well
aimed and rightly discharged that
hundred shot might decide a great
battle.”

  Encouraged, I offered a variation
of the idea, a larger and wider gun
emplacement with not small'barrels
but regular cannon placed in a row
and slightly slanted tow'ard the
center. These, I suggested, could be
so trained as to center their fire on
a single point. The bank of cannon,
wheeled into position and the fuses
lighted in quick succession, could
throw a shower of heavy shot
against a single small area upon a
rampart or wall, battering it open.

  “Eight you are!” applauded
Lorenzo. “It would outshine the
greatest battering-ram in all Chris-
tendom.”

  “It may be improved,” I continued,
“by explosive shot in the cannon.”
“Explosive shot?” Guiliano re-
peated in sharp protest. “How, Ser
Leo? Is not all shot solid? Can lead
and iron explode?”

  “Yes, with powder and a fuse in-
side,” I said at once though none
too surely.

  “Nay, nay,” he argued. “What
would prevent sjvch a shot from ex-
ploding in the very mouth of the
cannon, belike splitting its barrel
and doing injury to our own
soldiers?”

  I had to shake my head, saying
that I could not answer definitely
just then.

  “Then answer another time,” said
Lorenzo kindly. “In the meanwhile”
—he picked up my two drawings—
“these will go to my armorers for
models to be made. Ser Leo can
draw us other things as well.”
  WHERE DID IT COME FROM? HOW DID IT GET HERE?

World!

HOWARD HAWKS’

MOVIE!

  “He draws notably,” contributed
Botticelli.

 Evening had drawn on, lamps
were lighted and we had supper in
the garden, a richer and spicier
meal than I care for. There was
plenty of wine and all drank freely
of it, not excepting the abbot. Finally
some fruits and ice-cooled sherbet
were brought and as this dessert
was being served we were joined by
five or six ladies.

 Most beautiful and arresting
among these was the famous
Simonetta Vespucci, the reigning
toast of Florence. She was no more
than eighteen years old, as I judged,
but mature in body and manner, a
tall, slenderly elegant lady, a little
sloping in the shoulders but other-
wise beyond criticism in the perfec-
tion of her figure. Her abundant
hair gleamed golden and her proud
face was at once warmly and purely
handsome.

45

  All the men were her frank and
devoted admirers. I have heard that
the very shopkeepers and artisans
who saw her pass on the street were
wont to roll their eyes in awe
at her loveliness, even to fight jeal-
ously over this noble creature they
dared not address.

  Of those present she appeared to
prefer the dark dashing Giuliano
de Medici.

  “I fear that it will be a hot sum-
mer,” she mourned as she finished
her sherbet. “There will be little ice
left in the storehouses, even now.”
“Nay then,” I made haste to say.
“Ice may be kept through the hottest
months if it is placed in houses
banked with earth.” I quickly
sketched such a half-buried shed.
“And also let the ice be covered deep
with sawdust and chaff.”

  “How?” demanded the painter,
Botticelli. “I have known chaff to
be placed over fruit in a shop and so
46

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

keep it from freezing. If chaff
keeps fruit warm, will it also make
ice cold?”

I WAS on the point of launching
into a discussion of refrigeration
and insulation but prudently stopped
short. “It does indeed bring cold-
ness,” I assured him. “Or rather it
keeps the coldness that is there al-
ready.”

  “Black magic,” muttered Abbot
Mariotto, crossing himself with a
beringed hand.

  “Nay, white magic,” decided
Lorenzo, “for it does good on earth,
does it not, and no harm to any
creature? Ser Leo, do you guaran-
tee that ice will thus remain through
the summer and not perish?” He
turned to a servant. “Go you,” he
ordered, “and summon a secretary.”
And then to me, “He shall make
notes of what you say, young sir, and
tomorrow shall see the building of
such a house. Therein my ice shall
lie with good store of chaff to in-
sure its cold.”

  “This strange young man is a
learned doctor,” said the silvery
voice of a lady, who toyed with a
goblet of jeweled gold.

  “Does he not know of more exalted
things than chaff and houses buried
in the earth?” asked Simonetta Ves-
pucci, deigning to smile upon me.
“Ser Leo—for so you seem to be
called—can you not tell us a tale of
these stars, which now wink out in
the sky and float above our earth?”
Her eyes and her smile dazzled
me, understandably, along with any
man on whom they turned. Perhaps
that is why I ventured to dazzle
her in turn.

  “Madonna Simonetta,” I said,
“permit me to say that those stars
are worlds, greater than ours.”
“Greater than ours?” she cried
and laughed most musically. “But
they are no more than twinklets,
full of spikes and beams, like little
shining burrs.”

  “They are far away, Madonna,” I

said. “A man, if only at the dis-
tance of a hundred paces, appears
so small that he can be contained
within the eye of a needle held close
before you. So with these bodies,
which are like the sun—”

  “The sun!” she interrupted. “The
sun, Ser Leo, is round, not full of
points like a star.”

  There was applause at her lively
protest from all the men and most of
the women. For answer, I took up a
sheet of the paper on which I had
been sketching, and asked for the
loan of a pin. One of the ladies had
a silver bodkin in her cap and of-
fered it. With this I pierced a hole
in the paper.

  “Madonna”—I addressed Simo-
netta—“hold this hole to your eye
and look through it. The smallness of
the opening will shut away the
glitter . . . So, you do it correctly.
Now”—I pointed to where, in the
evening sky, hung shimmering Jupi-
ter—“look yonder. Is that star, seen
through the hole in your paper, a
burr or a small round body?”

  “This is marvelous,” she ex-
claimed. “It is indeed round, like
a gold coin seen from a distance.”
The others cried out in equal
astonishment and each must needs
look through the hole in the paper
at Jupiter. I turned over in my
mind the possibilities of explaining
a telescope but decided not to offer
another foggy theory that I could
not support with exact plans or
models. I contented myself with at-
tempting to lecture on astronomy.

  “Gentlemen and fair ladies,” I
said as impressively as I could man-
age, “these stars look so small that
nothing appears less, yet there are a
great many that are far larger than
our own Earth. Think then how
trivial our own star would appear
if—”

  “Faith, Cousin,” called out a voice
I knew, “you seek to belittle the
world and Florence and Lorenzo
the Magnificent!”

  It was Guaracco, absolutely over-
TWICE IN TIME	47

whelming in green and gold, who
strode forward and paid fulsomely
cordial respects all around.

 “Forgive my young kinsman,
Your Magnificence, if he has been
impertinent," he pleaded eloquently.
Then, turning to me, “Will you step
aside, Leo? I have a message for
you from Lisa.”

  At the mention of that name a
little murmur of laughing con-
gratulation went up to the effect
that I must have a sweetheart. In-
deed I felt a quickening of my pulse
as Guaracco and I walked a little
away through the garden, out of the
range of the lamplight.

  “What is the message from her?”
I asked him.

  “That was but an excuse to get
you alone,” he growled. “I warn
you, Leo, say no more of these
matters of the stars.”

 “But why not?” I demanded,
surprised.

  “The stars in their courses are
a specific knowledge of sorcerers. I
overheard your teaching just now
that—”

  “I was teaching truth,” I broke in,
warm to defend myself.

  “I know it,” he said. “I do not
think this little mote, our planet, is
the center of'all things. But the
old belief is part of my trade. I
frighten or reward or guide men by
horoscopes and prophecies—from
the stars. Do you not show me a
liar, else I may smooth your way to
destruction.”

  I glared at him but in my mind
was more wonder than rage. Once
again he had revealed himself, for
he hid his knowledge and fostered
error for profit. Only some great
evil wish dictated such action. I
need not be too ashamed, I feel, to
say that he made me afraid.

CHAPTER IX
The End of the Evening

GUARACCO did his best to be the
lion of the occasion. Not that he
did not merit attention. He could
charm and astound and inform.
Lorenzo publicly and good-
humoredly withdrew his previous
opinion that Guaracco was dull and
bade him talk on any subject he
would. Strange philosophy-crammed
conversation intrigued Lorenzo, as
the jokes of a jester or the gambols
of jugglers might intrigue a more
shallow ruler.

  And Guaracco obliged with im-
provements upon my discussion of
war machines. To my multiple-fire
device he added a suggestion where-
by the crossbows of Lorenzo’s guard
might be improved—a quick simple
lever to draw and set the string in-
stead of the slower and moi*e cum-
bersome moulinet or crank.

  The company praised and ap-
proved the idea, and Guaracco
beamed. He liked it less when Bot-
ticelli suggested and Lorenzo agreed
that I make clearer his rough sketch
of the lever action.

  “I perceive” — Guaracco smiled
satirically—“that you also admire
my kinsman’s drawing. Has he told
you of that other talent he hopes-
to develop? Flying?”

  “Flying?” repeated the beautiful
Simonetta, her eyes shining.

 “Aye, that. With a machine
called an ‘airplane.’ ”

  He used the Twentieth-Century
English word, and I must have
started visibly. How did he know
that name and invention? I did not
remember telling him about air-
planes. But Simonetta was already
laughing incredulously.

  “Belike this young man seeks to
soar with wings and reach those
great worlds and suns he pretends
48

WONDER STOKY ANNUAL

to see in the sky,” she suggested
merrily, a twinkle in her eyes.

  “It sounds like sacrilege.”
Guiliano garnished his sweetheart’s
apparent effort to embarrass me.
“Flight is contrary to man’s proper
nature.”

  I was a little angry. “How con-
trary?” I demanded. “Is it more
contrary or sacrilegious than to ride
comfortably and swiftly on the back
of a horse?”

  The abbot came to my support.
“The young man says sooth,” he
pronounced. “Holy writ sings of the
righteous—‘They shall mount up
with wings as eagles’—and again, in
the words of the Psalmist himself—
‘0, that I had wings like a dove!’
Surely such flight would not be un-
godly unless it were accomplished by
the aid of black magic.”

  “Well, Ser Leo?” Lorenzo
prompted me.

  He leaned back in his cushioned
chair of state, crossing one long
nobby leg over the other. His com-
panions grouped themselves grace-
fully if sycophantically around him.
All were awaiting my reply to the
abbot’s last suggestion.

  “Your Magnificence, there is no
such thing as black magic,” I said,
“either in my devices or elsewhere.”
Every eye widened and Guaracco
stiffened as though I had prodded
him with a dagger. I remembered
that he had come close to frightening
*me not an hour before and deter-
mined to make some amends to my
own self-respect.

   “Of all human discourses,” I elab-
orated warmly, watching him, “the
most foolish is that w’hich affirms a
belief in necromancy.” Guaracco
glared but I did not hesitate. “If
this necromancy or black magic did
truly exist, he who controlled it
would be lord of all nations and no
human skill could resist him.

  “Buried treasure and the jewels
of Earth’s heart would lie manifest
to him. No lock, no fortress, could
remain shut against his will. He

could remain shut up or travel the
uttermost parts of the Universe.
But why do I go oil adding instance
to instance? W’hat could not be
brought to pass by such a mechani-
cian?”

  As I finished there was a sigh, a
mutter and finally Lorenzo struck
his hands together in applause.
“Well said, Ser Leo!” he cried. “Do
you not think so, Guaracco? Does
this not prove that there are no
sorcerers ?”

  “It proves, at least, my innocence
of the charge of sorcery.” Guaracco
smiled and bowed to give the reply
strength. “If I could do such things,
would I be so humble and dependent
a servant of Your Magnificence9
Surely”—his eyes found mine once
more—“nothing is impossible to a
true necromancer.”

  “Nothing,” I agreed, “except ref-
uge from death.”

  His smile vanished.

  Lorenzo lolled more easily in his
chair. “This bethinks me,” he re-
marked. “One matter has not been
settled. Ser Leo is a boy, a student
of the arts, yet he conquered with
ease my nonpareil swordsman. That
smacks of enchantment.”

  I spread my hands in one of the
free Florentine gestures I was be-
ginning to use. “I make bold to deny
that it was aught but skill.”

  “We must make trial.”

  His Magnificence permitted him-
self another faint grin. I must have
shown an expression of worry, foi
Giuliano burst out into confident
laughter and sprang forward, hand
on hilt.

  “Let me do the trying,” he cried,
his gay handsome face thrusting
at me in the white light of the
lamps.

SIMONETTA’S silvery chuckle ap-
plauded her cavalier. The abbot
also called for this unecclesiastical
performance to take place without
delay. Before I well knew what was
happening, the chairs, benches and
TWICE IN TIME

49

other furniture had been thrust
back, the lamps trimmed to give
more light and I faced Giuliano in
the center of the cleared space.
Poliziano had run to fetch something
and he came close to me.

  “Here, young sir,” he said. “De-
fend yourself.” And he thrust a
hard object into my hand.

  Giuliano had already drawn his
sword and wadded his cloak into a
protection on his free arm. I trans-
ferred my own weapon to my left
arm and at sight of it my heart
sank. It was a mere cane of wood,
hard and round and of a sword’s
length, such as Florentine lads used
for fencing practise. Giuliano, on
the other hand, fell en garde with a
blade that was one of the finest and
sharpest I ever saw. Plainly I was
to furnish sport for this gallant and
his friends and all advantages were
denied me.

  Because I must I lifted the cudgel
to cross his steel. Lorenzo grunted.

  “Your cousin is sinister-handed,
Guaracco,” he observed. “Belike that
is the secret of his skill.”

  “I fear not,” said Giuliano with
unmalicious zest and he disengaged
and thrust at me.

  Apparently he meant business,
for the point would have nicked my
breast had I not shortened my own
arm and beat it aside. Cheers went
up from the ladies—then slid into
dismayed screams. For, extending
my parry to its conclusion as a
riposte, I smote Giuliano smartly on
the inside of the elbow.

  He wheezed in pain and sprang
back out of reach. Had I followed
and struck again he might have been
forced to drop the sword. But I
realized that I had to do with the
second greatest man in Florence
and only stood my ground.

  Giuliano laughed again. “God’s
wounds, what a tingler!” He praised
me. “I’ll ward it another time.”

  Forward he came again, right foot
advanced, his cloaked left arm
brought well up. Again I awaited

his thrust, parried it and drove it
out of line, then riposted as before.
He, as good as his promise, inter-
posed the folds of the cloak, taking
a muffled tap on his left forearm.
But that hurt him somewhat and he
retreated. This time I followed him,
avoided an engagement and half-
struck at his head.

  But I stopped in time, fearing to
injure him and make dangerous
enemies. Instead I diverted the
course of the stroke into a sweeping
moulinet, passing over his weapon
to my right and his left, and termi-
nated it in a resounding thwack on
Giuliano’s velvet-sleeved sword
arm.

  Absolute silence fell, then a mur-
mur of consternation from the on-
lookers. For Giuliano’s smile had
vanished and his eyes flashed fire.
Plainly the contest had ceased to be
sport with him—my thumps had
made him angry. He snapped out a
soft blasphemy, advanced quickly
and sped a slashing cut—not at me
but at my stick. The edge of his
steel, keen as a razor, shored
through the tough wood without ef-
fort and I was left with a mere
baton in my hand, a truncated billet
no more than fifteen inches long.

  “No, no, Giuliano, spare him!!”
called out Lorenzo—but too late to
balk his brother’s murderous stab
at my throat.

  I managed to parry with the short
length of wood remaining to me,
causing his point to shoot upward
and over my left shoulder. At once
I stepped forward, well within his
lunge. Before he could retreat or
recover, my free right hand caught
the crossguard of his weapon and
wrenched. His own right arm,
bruised twice in the previous en-
gagements, had lost some of its
strength and in a trice I tore the
sword away from him.

  At once I dropped my severed
stick, fell back and whipped the
captured hilt into my left hand.

  “By your leave, my lord,” I
50	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

panted, “I will continue the matter
with this more suitable equipment.”

  But then Lorenzo, Poliziano and
Guaracco had sprung forward and
between us. The sorcerer caught me
in his arms and wrestled me farther
back, his red beard rasping my ear
as he hissed out a warning to take
care. Lorenzo the Magnificent was
lecturing Giuliano in the manner of
big brothers in every land and
generation. And Giuliano recovered
his lost temper.

  “Hark you, Ser Leo, I did amiss,"
he called out to me, laughing. “I had
no lust to hurt you at the beginning.
I meant only fun. And then—” He
broke off, still grinning, and rubbed
his injured arm. “I forgot myself.
It is not many who can teach me
either swordplay or manners—but,
by Saint Michael of the Sword, you
have done both!”

IT WAS handsomely said and 1
gladly gave him back his weapon,
assuring him that I bore no ill-will.
At that, he embraced me in the im-
pulsive Latin manner, swearing that
he would stand my friend forever.
The company subsided to chairs
again, happy that no harm had be-
fallen either of us.

  “We wander from the path of our
earlier discourse,” reminded Abbot
Mariotto tactfully. “Ser Leo was
speaking of a flying machine. Where
is it, my son?”

  “It is not yet constructed. Holy
Father,” I replied.

  As with so many other things the
principle of flying a heavier-than-air
machine was caught only vaguely in
the back of my head. I could visual-
ize roughly the form, a thin body
with a rudder for tail and outspread
wings—and something to stir the
air.

  “Belike you would strap wings to
your arms,” suggested Giuliano.

  “Impossible,” spoke up Poliziano.
“Are not man’s arms too weak for
flight? Would they not need great
muscles, at least as strong as those

of the legs?”

  I had an inspiration and an an-
swer. “The muscles of our legs are
many times stronger than needful
to support the weight of our bodies,”
I told him.

  Lorenzo, eager as always for new
philosophic diversion, challenged me
to prove it. I asked him to get me a
long tough plank and servants were
sent scurrying after it. While I
waited I chose a strong straight
chair and sat upon it. A cushion I
took and laid upon my knees. When
the plank arrived 1 balanced it upon
this cushion.

  “Now, come, all of you,” I in-
vited, “and rest yourselves upon this
plank.”

  Lorenzo did so at once and then
his brother. The others followed
laughingly, not excepting the abbot
and Madonna Simonetta—ten in all.
supported upon my knees. Only
Guaracco stood aloof.

  “Your long shanks support many
hundredweight, stout cousin,” he
said, “but what does this prove?”
“It proves his argument and the
fallacy of mine.” handsomely re-
plied Poliziano for me as he rose
from his seat at one end of the plank.
“His legs have tenfold strength and
his arms may be strong in propor-
tion, enough to flap wings and waft
upward his entire weight.”

  “Then let me see it done,” pro-
nounced Lorenzo with a grand
finality that made my heart sink.
“I am ambitious, Ser Leo, to watch
you ‘mount up with wings as eagles.’
And I do not forget the other ar-
rangement, by which you will make
solid shot to explode.”

  This last labor, which I had been
glad to slight in conversation, now
seemed actually the easier.

  But Simonetta and the other ladies
professed themselves weary of cold
science, be it ever so important in
a masculine world, and demanded
music. Poliziano, whose voice was
as sweet as his appearance was un-
gainly, immediately snatched up a
silver lute and picked out a lively
tune. The song he rendered was
saucy and merry and not a little
shocking—but the holy abbot led the
loud applause.

  “More! More!” cried Simonetta.

  Poliziano, bowing low to her, sang
to a more measured and dignified
tune, an offering that had all the
earmarks of impromptu versification
inasmuch as it mentioned the beauty
of Simonetta. the magnificence of
Lorenzo, the churchlv dignity of
Abbot Mariotto and, finally, the
enigmatic quality of my own dis-
course.

 “And will not Ser Leo sing?”
asked one of the ladies when
Poliziano had nmde an end. “His
conversation and talents are so
varied—war. science, debate, flying
h'ke a bird—”

  “Let us hear your voice, young
s'r.” Lorenzo commanded me.

  Thus urged, I took Poliziano’s lute,
altering the pitch and harmony of
its four strings until I could strum
upon it in a hit-or-miss fashion,
evoking chords to accompany my-
self. The song I managed to im-
provise and sing to Poliziano’s tune
was on the subject of stars, so edify-
ing to my new friends and so dis-
tasteful to Guaracco. Since Lorenzo
and the others commended it highly,
it may not be amiss to set it down
here.

  You think I am a spark—I am a
     star.

      am great.

CHAPTER X
The Bombs and the Wings

SILENT as we departed from the
gathering together, Guaracco
soon spoke.

  '‘I know very little, after all, of
how you live,” he said, “but per-
haps I can arrange how and when
you die. That song was meant to
reproach me. ”

  “Just as you like,” I rejoined, for
my fear of him had quite departed.
Too, I was arraying my spirit
against further imposition of his
will. “Your masterful ways become
burdensome, Guaracco. I defy you.”
And I paused near the palace
gates, my fists clenched.

  “No violence,” he warned me. “I
carry a sword as well as that short
gun you saw yesterday. And my
dwarfs are never far away. You,
on the other hand, have not yet as-
sumed our Florentine fashion of
carrying arms.” His beard stirred
in the gloom and I knew that he
smiled. “But I shall not kill you.
Leo, unless you force me. All these
defiances stand me in good stead.”
“In good stead?” I repeated, for
after my temporary semi-hypnotized
slavishness nothing had been further
from my wish than to aid Guaracco.

  “Aye, that. In scorning magic and
upholding science you have taught
me a lesson and few can boast of
teaching me anything of worth. It
Is time for me to forget my scorcery
pretenses, at least where it concerns
my relationship to Lorenzo. Science
shall be my way with him hereafter
—but not too much science. You and

I shall work wonders for him, the
two of us.'*

  “Am I to help you?” I sneered.
He shook his head, laughing. “It
is I who shall help you. For in-
stance, that matter of exploding
shot. I saw, as Lorenzo did not, that
you were perplexed. But it happens
that I may help you to fashion such
a thing. Again, is it not true that
you wish to return some day to your
own century?”

  Useless to deny that and I said so.
“And have you not forgotten
many details of your time-reflecting
machine?”

  Equally useless to deny that.

  “For instance,” went on Guaracco,
“you have forgotten certain ways to
use this strange new power which
you named to me as electricity. It
gives light but how?”

  I could not tell him.

  “I shall refresh your lost memory.
Is there not a certain bottle or
globe, exhausted of air—and a wire
of some substance set glowing with-
in—”

  I clutched his arm, so suddenly
fierce that he broke off and swore in
startled pain.

  “How do you know that?” I de-
manded. “Yes, I had forgotten en-
tirely. But you knew, and about
airplanes as well!”

 “Let me go,” he commanded.
“Here come Lorenzo’s grooms with
our horses.”

  We accepted our mounts and rode
away side by side.

  “Now,” said Guaracco, as we en-
tered a dim street, lighted only by
the lanterns of a watch patrol, “you
will remember that I showed you a
pearl, a beautiful jewel? And it put
you to sleep?”

  “You mean that in my trance I re-
membered ...”

  I could see how possible that was.
Meanwhile, I braced my spirit lest
he try some other occult trick. But
he only nodded as if to check the
point.

  “I learned things about your sci-
TWICE IN TIME

53

ence which you yourself cannot
grasp when awake. You shall look
into the pearl again, Leo, and more
knowledge will creep forth. We shall
produce wonders for Lorenzo, win-
ning great favor and possessions,
and also build your time reflector.
Nay our time reflector—for perhaps
I shall make the journey through the
ages with you.”

  He was swavin? me very strongly
but still I resented his absorb1'ng
mastery of every situation. He
seemed to read my mind.

  “Let us not be lord and servant
any more,” he offered, “but col-
leagues and friends. Lorenzo is dis-
posed to grant us money for a shop
of our own. Stay on with Verrocchio
lest others become suspicious.' But
your spare time can be applied to
our own profit." His voice became
sly. “Lisa asks after you, lad. She
would be pleased to see you again.
And, for all your last words to her.
I think you would be pleased, too.
Is it not so?"

  Finally I agreed to a truce and a
partnership. After all it was the
only way to escape from the Renais-
sance. And Guaracco’s concessions
seemed handsome at the time.

ON THE following day I skimped
my work with Verrocchio, and
called on Guaracco at the little house
where once he had tried to bestow
Lisa upon me. Lisa was there, shy
but apparently glad to see me. How
had I been able to admire Simonetta
Vespucci so greatly, only twelve
hours before, I could not understand.
But'I did my best to conceal my
feelings. Guaracco must not bring
that influence to bear upon me a
second time.

  As at his house in the country,
Guaracco had fitted up the cellar for
laboratory and workshop. At once
we began work on the “explosive
shot" which Lorenzo had demanded.

  At my recommendation we made
it cylindrical instead of round, a
good eighteen inches long and six

in diameter. Bronze, being light,
strong and workable, was our choice
for the outer shell of this bomb and
I cut deep cross-lines in the outer
surface so that it might the more
easily explode and fly in pieces. The
inside we filled strategically with
lumps of lead, with spaces between
for powder.

  Guaracco. though helpful, was as
puzzled as Giuliano de Medici about
the delay in explosion. To be cer-
tain of that delay, I mixed a slow-
burning powder, with charcoal of
willow wood only lightly burnt. The
completed mixture was no more than
dark brown in color, and a noticeable
interval of time was needed for its
ignition. Of this slow-burning pow-
der I made a fuse or match, which
led through a hole in the rear part
of the bomb.

  “The discharge from the cannon
will ignite the match," I explained,
“and the explosion will come in as
short a space as you would take to
say an Ave Maria”

  “Say an Ave Maria for the souls
of those it strikes.” Guaracco
laughed with cruel relish.

  We also made a more elaborate
bomb, its curved sides pierced with
muzzles from which bullets could
be thrown by the explosion. When
both were finished—we took only a
morning and an afternoon—Guarac-
co recommended that we wait before
presenting them to Lorenzo.

  “I take a parable from the con-
struction itself," he admonished me.
“Delay the explosion of this wonder.
It will be the more effective with His
Magnificence. Remember also that
when you have given him the ex-
plosive shot, he will demand at once
the flying machine."

  That was excellent advice for I
was still muddled in my plan to build
man-lifting wings and Guaracco
could not—or would not—help me.

  I therefore went into the trading
centers of Florence to shop for ma-
terials. My teacher, Andrea del Ver-
rocchio, who had heard little of my
54	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

problem, suggested as framework
the wood of Spanish yew, which was
employed by the archers of England
for their superb longbows and was
undoubtedly the strongest and light-
est wood to be had. I purchased a
bundle of such staves, which I
thinned and shaped by careful whit-
tling, and procured strong silk cloth
for the fabric.

  My best model, it seemed to me,
would be the wing of a bat. I went
so far as to snare and kill several
birds—sorrowfully, for I love ani-
mals— and, by manipulating their
wings and bodies, I found out certain
principles of flight. These I demon-
strated by small-scale models, to be
hung on threads and made to simu-
late flying by a strong blast of air
from a bellows. A new problem
added itself to that of the wings—
the construction and manipulation
of the tail as a rudder. I sketched
a design like a fan, which I hoped
to control by pressure and motion
of the feet.

  Guaracco professed a great deal of
interest in this work of mine, which
took up all my spare time for several
days. His interest seemed to partake
a little of superior amusement, as
though he foresaw failure. But Lisa
was kindly and admiring and even
helped in the sewing of the fabric,
which needed a woman’s skill. I
joined the ribs of the wings and tail
myself, with looped pieces of leather
at the junctures and my thread for
sewing and binding was new raw
silk.

  It was late in the summer of 1470
—the.last of August, I think—when
I had the trial of my machine.

  For greater privacy we returned
to Guaracco’s country house, the
scene of my first appearance in this
age. Guaracco led the way on his
fine white stallion—I rode the gray
that had belonged to my hapless ad-
versary Gido, which was later given
me by Lorenzo.

  Lisa had a pretty little mule and
two grooms carried the unwieldy

bundles that held my wings and rud-
der. How and when Guaracco’s
dwarfs made the journey, I do not
know. We left them behind in Flor-
ence but they were waiting for us
when we dismounted at the country
house. Servants like that pleased
Guaracco immensely.

AFTER a light noon repast of cold
meat, bread and some white wine
I went to a shed at the back of the
house. Scrambling up, I donned my
pinions.

  They measured almost thirty feet
from tip to tip and were fastened
to me with light strong straps under
the armpits, around my biceps and
between elbow and wrist. There
were springy grips for my hands
and, by relaxing or applying squeeze-
pressure. I could spread or fold the
umbrellalike ribs that supnorted the
fabric. The tail was similarly fixed
to mv legs, which I could straddle to
extend the fan or hold close to fold it.

  I gazed down to the ground. It
seemed a long way off. Beneath me
stood Lisa, her face full of apprehen-
sive interest—and at an upper rear
window of the house Guaracco thrust
his red-bearded head forth to watch.

  “Ready.” I said to myself. “Go!”

  I sprang. As I did so I spread and
beat the wings, extended the tail
downward to prive me direction in
soaring. A sickening airy moment.
My face turned up into the sunlight.
I seemed to feel the world grow
small beneath me. Another longer
moment with the touch of triumph,
another beating thrash of the wings.
Then I whirled helplessly in the air
and fell.

  I suppose I was stunned. There
was a galvanizing shock and dark-
ness, then, from far away, laughter
—the delighted laughter of Guarac-
co. Blending with it came a second
voice, softer, gentler. Lisa was pat-
tering a prayer for my safety.

  Struggling with my close-clamped
eyelids, I managed to gaze up. Lisa’s
face was close above mine, all white
TWICE IN TIME

55

except for the dark worried eyes.
She had taken my head in her lap.

  “You are not dead, Leo?” she
asked.

  “Not I,” I assured her and sat up.
It was difficult, for I was bruised in
all my limbs and the laboriously-
fashioned wings and rudder were
broken to bits.

  Guaracco descended from his post
at the window and came out into the
yard. “Not Icarus himself plunged
so tragically from heaven.” he jibed.

  I rose to my feet, unstrapping the
tangled wreckage. “For a moment I
flew,” I defended myself. “The next
time—”

  “Must there be a next time?” in-
terposed Lisa, who still trembled.
“Pray heaven you do not seek to fly
again.”

  “She pleads most prettily,” Gua-
racco observed, strokinsr his beard.
“Are you not content to remain on
the ground with h°r, Leo? Will you
not leave flight to the birds, its prop-
er masters?” *

  But I shook my head stubbornly.
“Not 1. A bird is no more than an
instrument, working according to
mathematical law. It is within the
capacity of man to duplicate that
instrument and its working. I shall
try again and 1 shall succeed.”

  “See that I am present to watch,”
said Guaracco, chuckling.

  But he wras more helpful when, in
the house, I stripped off my doublet
and showed bruised ribs and shoul-
ders. His many skills included that
of mixing salves and ointments and
the sticky stuff he applied to my
hurts helped them swiftly and great-
ly.

  In any case we had the bombs to
offer Lorenzo.

CHAPTER XI
Hopes of Escape

BOMBS were a curiosity but ours
pleased Lorenzo greatly when
Guaracco and 1 returned to Florence
with them. He gave us an audience,
and later entertainment on the ter-
race of his villa in the pleasant green
suburb of Fiesole.

  “These things would do us credit
in any battle,” he was gracious
enough to say. “Yet it is my hope to
profit by some more peaceable ma -
vel of yours. What, for example, of
that flying machine?”

  “1 make progress.”

  I attempted to put him off and
Guaracco also labored to change the
subject. We discussed the summer
heat and the threatened drying up
of wells.

  “May it please Your Magnifi-
cence,” I made bold to say, “an irri-
gation plan might be drawn up. The
waters of the Arno could supply
the town in driest season and water
the fields as well.”

  “That would benefit the people of
my beautiful Florence,” said the des-
pot, with one of his softening smiles
at play on that arrestingly ugly
face.

  “Again,” I pursued, ”does it not
seem well to widen the streets of the
town? A street should be as wide as
the houses are high.”

  “Make haste slowly,” he bade me.
“Finish the flying machine before
you turn Florence into a paradise.”
But an early autumn with real
Tuscany frost enabled me to ask for
time and a brighter day. As winter
came on I lived in Florence, working
under Verrocchio at paintings, stat-
ues, metalwork and my own devices.
In the evenings I had plenty of diver-
sion, for the artist Sandro Botticelli
showed himself willing to become my
56

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

friend and sponsor in artistic so-
ciety.

  I was often entertained at great
mansions. One or two times I was
present at informal dinners and dis-
cussions at Lorenzo's palace and
once at the house of Simonetta Ves-
pucci herself. There I met her kins-
man, Amerigo Vespucci, who had
won fame as a geographer and map-
maker. Visiting him was a tall roan-
haired young man from Genoa, a
sailor and adventurer.

  “Cristoforo Colombo.” Vespucci
introduced him to Botticelli and my-
self as we stood warming ourselves
before an open fire of aromatic wood.

  "Colombo?” I repeated. The name
did things to my maddeningly dis-
torted recollections. “Colombo? Hark
you, sir, you intend to follow the sea
for all your days?”

  The roan-haired visitor nodded
and smiled. “Aye, that. I have vis-
ited the infidel princes to the east
and Spain and even England. I hope
to go further some day.”

  “Go further?” I exclaimed excited-
ly. “I should think you will go fur-
ther!” In my earnestness I laid a
hand on his shoulder. “Ser Cristo-
foro,” I said, “much of the world re-
mains unclaimed, undreamed of.
There are whole continents besides
these we know—whole oceans and
shoals of islands. It is fated for you
to sail westward, to find a new
world!”

  “How, a new world ?” he asked me,
a little puzzled.

  “This earth is round,” I informed
him weightily. “It is shaped like a
ball with oceans and lands at every
quarter of it. In circumference it is
nearly twenty-five thousand miles.”

HE BURST into laughter at that,
laughter so hearty that Botticel-
li and some others looked up to see
the reason.

  “I see it now, Ser Leo!” cried
Cristoforo Colombo. “You have been
reading that strange book by the
Englishman.”

 “What strange book?” I de-
manded, puzzled in my turn.

  “John Mandeville was the Eng-
lishman’s name and he wrote his tale
of wondrous travels a good hundred
years ago. I bethink me he even said
that the circumference of the Earth
is something near your measure-
ment, above twenty thousand Eng-
lish miles.* But to my mind it is
smaller than that, with India’s most
eastern spice islands not too many
days’ sailing out from the Azores.”

  “You tell us nothing new, young
sir,” Amerigo Vespucci said to me.
“Surely only the simple country folk
think that Earth is other than round
and without end. The journey of
the Sun and stars, the dropping
down of a vessel’s hull at the line
of sky and sea, these prove the
roundness of the Earth.”

 “And so I might have demon-
strated by a voyage had some prince
given me ships,” rejoined Colombo
wistfully.

  I could not help but assure him
that this gift would come to him in
the year 1492 from the ruler of
Spain.

  “By your leave, my friend, I shall
wait until that happy day dawns,”
he said with a bow.

  That incident cured me of making
prophecies.

  Yet I was successful in fashion-
ing many devices, which served to
appease Lorenzo, though I was so
long in perfecting my flying ma-
chine. The most popular, to peas-
ants and porters as well as to my
companions in higher social scale,
was the wheelbarrow.

  As to my studies in art I was
able to contribute many suggestions
which Verrocchio accepted grate-
fully, among them the rather ob-
vious one that a painter or sculp-
tor of the living figure should study

  •	"The Travels of Sir John Mandeville, Knight,"
existed In manuscript form as early as 1371. The
theory of Earth’s roundness, common among in-
telligent geographers In the fifteenth century, ie
set out at length by Mandeville, who describes a
reputed voyage nearly around the world in his
own time.

anatomy. Such study was most dif-
ficult in Florence, for religious law
frowned upon the godless cutting
up of bodies that should have Chris-
tian burial.

  However, Lorenzo once again
showed himself ready to assist me
and I was enabled to visit the
morgue, to study and even dissect
bodies of paupers. Some of my
sketches Verrocchio posted on the
walls of his botteqa as ideal studies,
and we also assembled on a pedestal
the complete skeleton of a horse, to
be observed in making equestrian
paintings and studies.

  At the end of winter, Lorenzo en-
tertained Galleazc Maria Sforza, the
duke of Milan, in lavish manner. An-
drea del Verrocchio was pageant
master during those glittering days
and I helped him to plan processions
of horsemen and costumed figures,
routs, balls, receptions and miracle
plays, even a warlike afternoon of
jousting in one of the public squares.

  Here banks of seats were erected
all around a cleared space, so that
the square resembled a stadium or
hippodrome, and various Florentine
cavaliers tilted against the followers
of the Milanese ruler. Lorenzo
offered, in what he must have
thought a kindly mood, to provide
me with armor, a lance and a war-
horse. that I might take part in the
activity. When I declined he
thought 1 was being only modest.

  “You are an artist and scientist,”
he argued, “and therefore, among
free Florentines at least, a gentle-
man and the peer of any. Do not be
afraid of lords with their lances.”

  But I managed to beg ofF, though
the sport was not as dangerous as I
had surmised. For one thing, the
opposing cavaliers did not dash full
upon each other. They rode on op-
posite sides of a paling, endeavoring
to strike or push across it with lance-
point against shield or helmet.

  For another thing professional
soldiers were barred, as apt to for-
get themselves. Giuliano de Medici,

handsome and dashing, wore a knot
of ribbon tied upon his mail-clad

arm by the beautiful Simonetta and
overthrew two opponents. Other-
wise the jousting struck me as
rather tame.

IORENZO took special pride in
1 showing his art treasures to
Sforza, who, as Poliziano later told
me, cried out that mere gold and
silver could not approximate such
riches of the soul. And when the
Milanese departed they were too
greatly impressed to hide their ad-
miration—which was what Lorenzo
had hoped.

  It had been Guaracco’s earnest
ambition to make a friend of Gal-
leazo Sforza but after a carefully
contrived interview on the final day
of the visit he sought me out at Ver-
rocchio’s botteqa, shaking his head.

  “Sforza is too absolute a tyrant
among his Milanese/’ he complained.

  “Is money not something?” I sug-
gested tepsingly, for in those days
we were on terms of something re-
sembling good fellowship.

  He shook his foxy red head.
“Money is little to me—I want
power. 1 want wills to be bowed to
mine, cities to rise or fall at my
lifted hand, great men to go on mis-
sions here and there with my words
and wishes upon their lips. I want
the oceans to shake with the pas-
sage of my ships, the continents to
vibrate under the marching feet of
my armies. I want to rule!”

  “Money rules,” I reminded. “Look
at Lorenzo. The founder of his house
was a druggist, a simple maker of
pills. Yet, by the accumulation and
wise use of gold—”

  “Gold!” snorted Guaracco. “It
buys food, clothes, women, wine,
music—but of what value is it, save
to attract thieves? It was powerful
with the Medici only through genera-
tions of careful planning and I can-
not wait so long. Cold steel is the
better metal if held by a brave man
and ruled by a wise one.”
58

I BEGAN to appreciate something
of the ambition that stirred this
charlatan-genius.

  “I followed sorcery from boy-
hood,” Guaracco went on, “because,
at first, I believed in it. As you your-
self once put it, a true sorcerer could
travel winds, chain lightnings, know
and rule the Universe. Even when I
found that supposed enchantments
were but a fraud I remained a stu-
dent and practitioner of the false
art—and I have won some rewards.

  •“You saw my coven of deluded
witch-worshippers. They serve me
in many ways—through fear or awe
or fascination—that they would
never dare if I offered them only
gold. Too, a great many nobles and
merchants respect and fear me be-
cause I seem to foretell events, can
cast horoscopes and apparently sum-
mon devils. One or two are well
within my power. I gave a certain
man poison, for instance, to serve a
certain other man. That certain
other man owes me both gratitude
for the vengeance and fear I
betray him.”

  “But now you follow true science,”
I said. “You told me so.”

  “Science—and sorcery of a kind.”
I shook my head. “There is no
such thing as sorcery.”

  “Is there not? Come with me.”
Once again I accompanied him to
his house nearby. The front room
was changed in that there was a
massive square table with a thick
velvet covering extending to the floor
on all sides. In its center stood a
great bowl of silvercoated glass.

  Guaracco drew the heavy curtains,
so that it was quite dark in the
room, and lighted a candle. Then,
at the clap of his hands, the two
dwarfs entered with a great ewer of
water between them. From this Gua-
racco filled the bowl to the brim.

  “Look into it, Leo,” he bade me,
as the dwarfs departed.

  I did so. “What then?” I chal-
lenged him. “Here is a simple basin
of water.”

  “You are sure of that?” he per-
sisted. “Thrust in your hands and
convince yourself.”

  Again I obeyed him. It was water,
sure enough, and beneath it the sur-
face of the bowl was smooth and
normal.

  “I see no wonder,” I said to Gua-
racco.

  “What did you expect to find in
that bowl—the face of Lisa?” He
laughed. “Favor me, kinsman, by
blowing out the candle.”

  I blew it out. The room fell dark
all at once. No, not entirely, for a
faint filtered glow came up from the
bowl of water.

  “A chemical trick,” I pronounced
immediately. “You have put phos-
phorus in there.”

  “Did you not see the water poured
from pitchers?” he asked. “But I
make no argument. Look into the
bowl again.”

  As he spoke he put in his own
hand and stirred the liquid into
ripples. I saw nothing but a dis-
turbed surface, like a tiny ocean in
a gale, with light beneath. Then the
ripples grew less, slowed, finally de-
parted. I gazed deep into the radiant
water.

  From its bottom a face looked up
at me.

  Lisa!

  I think I spoke her name aloud
and put forth a hand to touch her
forehead. But my finger only dipped
into water and Guaracco laughed his
familiar mocking peal.

  “You were deceived for all your
assurance,” he taunted me. Quickly
he moved to uncurtain the windows,
letting in light. “See, it was simple.
I arranged it an hour ago to mystify
one of the Milanese. A hole in the
table, a glass bottom in the bowl—
and under the velvet a couch where-
on Lisa lay with a light close beside
her—”

  He lifted a corner of the cloth and
Lisa slowly emerged.

  “It was as if you looked upon her
through a window,” Guaracco
TWICE

summed up. He saw that I gazed
reproachfully at the girl and laughed
once again.

   “Nay, Leo, she did not deceive you
of herself. I put her to sleep as you
know I can do—with this.”

  He held it up in his fingers—the
glowing pearl that more than once
before had drawn forth my wits.
Staring at it unguardedly I felt my-
self ensnarled before I could set up
my defense. He caught my elbow
with his other hand, easing me into
a chair as mists closed about me.

  When I awoke Guaracco sat at the
velvet-covered table, scribbling
hastily upon a tablet of white paper.

   “You will rejoice," he said, seeing
my eyes open. “I took opportunity
to open again that closed memory
of yours.”

  “What this time?”

  “Details of the machine you for-
got. The time reflector.”

  At once I lost my resentment of
his sly assertion of power of my
senses. “Full details?” I cried.

   “Enough. I think, to build the ma-
chine itself.”

   And then I saw Lisa’s eyes, turned
mournfully upon me, as though al-
ready she bade me goodbye.

CHAPTER XII
The New Reflector

EVEN if I could I do not think I
would set down exact details of
a machine so apt to cause trouble
as the one Guaracco had retrieved in
theory from the waste places of my
mind. The fact is, he kept the plans
to himself and questioned me only
now and then, sometimes hypnotiz-
ing me for the questions, sometimes
not. And there were bits of science
which even he could not digest.

  “These exact measurements of the
steel frame parts—how can we
achieve them?” he would ask. “You

IN TIME	59

 tell me in your sleep’ of micrometers,
 yet how can we design a microm-
 eter? How even knowing its prin-
 ciple can we make it without proper
 tools ? How was the first micrometer '
 made?”

   Automatic lathes, alloy charts and
 welding torches were equally unob-
 tainable. Guaracco did the next best
 thing. He sought out a master
 swordsmith and in some adroit way
 —I think his witch-cult helped him
 —bound the fellow to his service by
 terror and awe. This craftsman,
 with all his tools and materials, he
 transported to the country estate
 and there set him to work pains-
 takingly shaping the metal skeleton
 of the reflector mechanism.

   Electrical engineering Guaracco
 learned from the ground up. Here
 once again I must needs be hypno-
 tized and my subconscious mind
 probed. My partner began with
 sticks of sealing wax and glass rods,
 rubbing them with fur or silk and
 studying the effects of the static
 charges.

   Frcmi that he progressed to what
 I was able to remember as a Leyden
 jar, contrived by his own cunning

*	hands after several unsuccessful
 trials. Finally came simple batteries
 but here he kept back from me the.
 knowledge he had mined from my
 own inhibited memory. He refused
 to tell me the acids and metals in-
 volved.

   When I insisted interruption came
 —a messenger from Lorenzo, asking
 how I progressed with the flying
 machine.

   “You reminded him,” I accused
 Guaracco in private.

   “How ungrateful vou are, Leo!”
 He snickered unabashedly, fingering
 his red beard. “Go to Florence and
 make your report. I shall work here
 in our laboratory and promise you
 that I will have progress to show
 when you return.”

   To Florence, perforce, I went.
 Lorenzo received me with some im-
 patience in his frescoed audience
WONDER STORY ANNUAL

chamber at the palace.

  “Well, young sir, what of the
wings you were making?" he de-
manded. “I gave you and Guaracco
money for your experiments and it
is high time you made me some re-
turn.”

  I exhibited my small models, all
that I had to show since the breaking
of my first wings. He was interested
but not completely satisfied and I
regretted having mentioned aviation
to him. Yet I knew men could fly. I
remembered seeing them in that age
whence I came and which itself was
yet to come—men flying singly or in
parties with the aid of great spread-
pinioned contrivances.

  Meanwhile, Lorenzo was giving
me orders. “I shall see this device
take shape under my own eyes. At
my villa in Fiesole is a great guest
house. Go you thither, set up your
shop and have sent to you all that
you need. Work where I can watch.”

  I bowed acceptance, and went to
Fiesole. There messengers brought
me the remains of my wings and
rudder, also more leather, silk and
staves, while Lisa came at my urgent
plea to help with the sewing. She
made a considerable impression on
the various guests who thronged
Lorenzo’s villa.

  Botticelli wanted to paint her,
Poliziano wrote six sonnets about
her, Giuliano spoke so gallantly to
her that Simonetta’s eyes took on a
green glow. To a certain captain of
mercenaries, a Spaniard named Her-
nando Villareal, I was even forced
to voice a warning.

  “The young lady is working on my
machine,” I told him, “at my wish
and under my protection. She does
not welcome your pressing atten-
tions.”

  “By God’s blood I” he sneered. We
were walking in a grove of poplars
to which I had drawn him for pri-
vacy. “I think, Ser Leo, that it is
you who finds the situation unwel-
come.”

  “I do not like it either if that will

content you.”

  He caressed his long moustache of
black silk. “Nay, it does not content
me a whit. I shall say to her what-
ever I please whenever I please.”
“Few words are best,” I made re-
ply. “If you speak to her again I
shall deprive your company of its
captain.” And I turned and walked
away.

  He was in a towering rage and
made haste in search of a friend to
bear me a formal defiance. The first
he met was Giuliano, who had not
forgotten the cudgeling I had given
him and the friendship he had sworn.
Giuliano informed the Spaniard that
I was the most dangerous antagonist
in Christendom, in whose hands a
wand was worse than a sword and a
sword itself a finger of Fate. Where-
at Captain Hernando Villareal left
Fiesole the same day, indeed left
Florence and I never heard speak of
him again.

WHEN my wings were completely
repaired and improved I made
a second attempt, springing from the
eaves of the guest house while Lor-
enzo and his friends watched. Again
I failed badly, tumbling aslant
through the air—but this time I
managed to land upright on my feet,
only spraining my ankle. My wings
and other harness remained un-
damaged and I was not distressed
by Guaracco’s ironic laughter.

  “I count myself lucky ” I said and
Giuliano ran out to support my limp-
ing steps. “My ankle will mend of
itself. But my wings, being broken,
would take much more labor and
time.”

  “You have not a complete loss of
labor to show,” Lorenzo was con-
siderate enough to say. “You came
to ground a good ten paces beyond
the house, farther than you might
have leaped unaided.”

  “And had you leaped without
wings you would have hurt worse
than vour ankle,” added Giuliano,
though he had first disputed my
TWICE IN TIME

61

theory of man’s ability to fly. “For
those two moments you were above
ground, methought I saw your fabric
hold you aloft. It fully broke your
fall at least.”

  This encouragement heartened
me. “I shall yet succeed,” I made
bold to say while a physician plucked
the shoe from my injured foot. “It
is not the fault of my theory, nor
the weakness of my arms. I must
learn as a fledgling bird learns.”

  But my sprained ankle kept me for
days at Fiesole, where I could prac-
tise no art save lute playing and
repartee among those silken cour-
tiers. Lisa insisted on remaining
with me, most prettily concerned
over my injury. After a day or so
Guaracco appeared with some of his
healing salves, to care for me with
the apparent solicitude of a kinsman,
to bow and utter compliments to the
ladies, to discuss poetry with Poli-
ziano, weapons with Giuliano, sci-
ence and government with Lorenzo.

  “I submit that my young Cousin
Leo makes progress with his flying,”
he told the company. “Who can hold
these first failures against him ? Can
he learn as a science in a few days
the behavior that has been a born
instinct of birds since the Creation ?”

  With more such talk Guaracco
helped to convince Lorenzo that I
should continue my labors in the
field of aviation. I came to realize
it was to Guaracco’s interest that I
do so. He wanted me to stay out
of his way. He was carefully arrang-
ing that I not relearn too much of
the science I remembered only when
in trance.

  The rest of that summer I was
able to put off a third experiment
with my wings—not that I did not
want to fly but I dreaded failing and
falling agam before the eves of my
patron. During the winter I achieved
several substitute offerings.

  These included a plan for drain-
ing some nearby swamps, which Lor-
enzo approved but did not act upon
at once—a brief written outline of

a new system of swordplay for the
palace guardsmen, which Lorenzo in
high good humor caused me to
demonstrate upon two very sur-
prised and glum fencing-masters—
and a suggestion, rather vague,
about the use jir i purpose of anti-
septics, at whi'.i Lorenzo laughed
and which I couJd not demonstrate
at all.

  I made several attempts at fash-
ioning both a microscope and a
telescope but I did not understand
the accurate grinding of lenses and
nobody was skillful enough to show
me. Also, even when I secured from
Andrea del Verrocchio’s spectacle
maker a pair of indifferent lenses
that would serve, I could not bring
them into proper relationship in a
tube.

  One thing I remembered well from
mv century, or rather from the one
before it. was Mark Twa'n’s pleasant
novel- A Connecticut Yankee in King
Arthur’s Court. I was failing sig-
nally to duplicate the exnloits of
that hard-headed and blithe hero.
Perhaps the Yankee, being an adroit
and impassioned mechanic, knew the
principles of all things from the
ground up.

  Mv science, first of all, had been
sketchy and too derived. Second, I
had been too interested in art, so art
had been set above my less-loved
studies in chemistry, engineering
and physics and they had been
shoved too far back in that now-
clouded brain of mine. Without Gua-
racco’s hypnotism hardlv anything
of real complex practicality could be
evoked. And with Guaracco’s hyp-
notism I was unable to see or appre-
ciate the very things I was caused
to remember.

  Poor Andrea del Verrocchio, who
had honed for so much from my
drawing, dared to shake his untidy
head over these scientific gropings
of mine.

  “His Magnificence will ruin a
master painter to make a convenient
philosopher,” he mourned. And it
62	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

was true that I had little or no op-
portunity that winter to paint the
picture I had once visioned as my
footprint in the sands of Renais-
sance time.

  As for the time reflector, which
Guaracco worked on with phenom-
enal energy and understanding, it
took form and power as the cold
weather passed us by. Among the
things it lacked was a piece of alum
large enough to make a lens but the
most notable alum mines of our
knowledge were not far away—fifty
miles to the southwest in the ancient
town of Volterra.

  At that time, however, the Volter-
rans chose to refuse any trade or
tribute to Lorenzo—even to defy
him. It began to look as if the only
alum we could get must be secured
by theft or force.

CHAPTER XIII
The Fate of Volterra

HERE was, indeed, what seemed
a full stop to our hopes for com-
pleting the mechanism. I could think
of nowhere to get alum in a large
enough portion but in a mine. True,
crystals may be built or fed but I %
did not know how—and the only'
available mine was at Volterra.

  That defiant city was a small one
but plucky and proud with splendid
defenses. As I mused, into my mind
drifted a few lines of a poem I had
heard often in my other existence:

 . . . lordly Volterra
 Where stands the far-famed hold,
 Piled high by hands of giants
 For god-like kings of old.*

  Whether Volterra’s defenses were
giant-built and God-begun I cannot
say—but they were tremendously
old and strong, walls of rough-cut

Bridge.” by Thomas Bablngton Macaulay. The

alum mines referred to are still workable.

stone that were said to go back to
ancient Etruscan times. The city
thus enclosed stood upon a huge
olive-clad height, from which the
sea was visible a score of miles dis-
tant. Near at hand opened the dark
mouths of the alum mines which
were so suddenly forbidden to us.
In fact the Volterrans forcibly
ejected certain Florentine commis-
sioners who claimed a tribute for
Lorenzo.

  His Magnificence undoubtedly
meant what he had once told me
about wishing to avoid war as costly,
dangerous and ignoble. But this was
too loud a challenge for even his
considerable patience. In tHe spring
of 1472 he called a meeting of the
Signoria—the lot-chosen body of
citizens who acted as public council
—for discussion of the problem. It
so happened that Guaracco himself,
a Florentine resident by virtue of
that house near Verrocchio’s bot-
tega, was a member of this jury-like
group of governors and was present
at the meeting.

  I too would have liked to attend
but it was impossible. Lorenzo had
called for a secret session—proof of
his concern over the matter. All I
knew was that one of the Signoria,
a conservative old fellow by the
name of Tomasco Soderino, was in-
tending to speak strongly for con-
ciliation and peace. Perhaps he
could restore friendship with the
Volterrans, make it possible for me
to secure my alum.

  I wished Lisa were there to talk
serenely and pleasantly to me. But
with Guaracco’s permission she was
visiting a friend, the abbess of a
convent near Venice.

  The meeting lasted all morning
and all afternoon—and at the end
of it Guaracco came to seek me at
Verrocchio’s. “It is all settled,” he
informed me, grinning triumphant-
ly.

  “Settled ?” I repeated. “Peace,
you mean?”

  “War,” he replied. “We take your
TWICE IN TIME

63

needful alum by force.”

   I felt a little shocked. “But Soder-
ino was going: to—”

  “Aye, and he did.” Guaracco an-
ticipated the end of the sentence.
“Bleated about soft answers to turn
away Volterran wrath, bleated for
hours. I had an answer ready. I
told Lorenzo that we could not make
your flying machine without alum
and plenty of it.”

  “Alum is riot for the flying ma-
chine,” I protested, “but for the
time reflector.”

  He gestured idly with a big hand.
“Do you not think I know, boy?
But we need alum and what matter
under which pretext we get it? Lor-
enzo is obsessed with desire to see
men fly. My word was the final
ounce in the balance to make him
decide for war.”

  After that things moved fast in
Florence because word arrived that
the town of Volterra had employed
a round thousand tough mercenaries
to defend her ancient walls. Lorenzo
immediately gathered four times
that number of troops and as their
commander engaged Federigo d’Ur-
bino, one of the most noteworthy
soldiers of the Italian peninsula.*
He did not deign to take command
himself and forcibly restrained the
younger and more fiery Giuliano
from volunteering to lead the
mounted lancers. But the brothers
did lead the force in procession
through the chief streets of the city.

TO ME that glittering spectacle
was somehow ironic. The cavalry
was for the most part French and
Navarrese, the pike-trailing in-
fantry largely Swiss and Swabian,
the crossbow companies from Sicily,
the artillery and siege train Spanish.
The whole cosmopolitan host was

  *	This famous general of mercenaries later com-
manded an army that fought against Lorenzo.
War, to these soldiers of fortune, was a game
and a business. There was no more lasting
enmity between such mercenaries than there is
today between lawyers who may have opposed
each other in lawsuits.

sprinkled here and there with Scots,
Hungarians, Englishmen and Moors.

  If any element was missing it was
Florentine.

  Yet that was the way the city-
states of Italy fought—not with
their own blood but with profes-
sional adventurers. Perhaps some-
thing can be said for the system.
Battles lacked the extreme ferocity
of deadly enmity, for opposing gen-
erals Were often old friends and com-
rades in arms, willing to win or lose,
so to speak, on points. At any rate
the Florentine shopkeepers and ar-
tisans seemed pleased and cheered
those foreign soldiers as loudly as
though a force of native Tuscans
was marching away to war.

  Guaracco, as leader of the party
that advocated strife, went to the
palace for permission to accompany
the mercenaries. I was with him as
he found Lorenzo, writing busily at
his desk in the audience chamber.

  “Go if you will,” the ruler told
Guaracco without raising his eyes
from the page. “I trust that this
campaign is final.”

  “You mean, destruction of Vol-
terra?” prompted Guaracco like a
lawyer wrenching an admission
from a witness.

  Lorenzo seemed to hear him only
by half. “That physician is often
most cruel,” he murmured as he re-
sumed writing what looked to be a
verse, perhaps a sonnet, “who ap-
pears most compassionate.”

  To this moment I am sure that
what he said was being fitted into
his poem and had nothing to do with
the campaign. Even if I am wrong
it was a most equivocal answer. But
Guaracco bowed as though he had
received specific and welcome orders.
Then he hurried away.

  Perhaps I should have gone with
him then but I had no stomach for
battle. I felt some uneasy guilt be-
cause, with Federigo d’Urbino’s
train of siege ordnance, went my
multiple-cannon arrangement for
battering down walls and many of
64	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

the crossbowmen carried weapons
with Guaracco’s lever improvement
which I had clarified in a sketch.

  A day I lingered in the town,
which buzzed with excitement about
the campaign. A whole night I lay
wakeful in the cell-like room I still
kept at Verrocchio’s bottega. Some-
thing indefinable made me woefully
nervous. Dawn had barely become
bright before I dressed, drew on
thigh-boots and leather riding-coat,
girded myself with a sword and hur-
ried to where my gray horse was
stabled.

  It was as if a voice called me to
Volterra.

  Yet for all my strangely-risen
anxiety I could not ride my poor
horse to death. I did no more than
thirty-five miles the first day, stop-
ping the night at a peasant’s hut.
When in the morning I continued,
before I had ridden an hour, I met
another horseman, galloping in the
direction of Florence. He was a
half-armored French lancer with
the velvet-edged sleeves of an under
officer. Also he wras three-quarters
drunk and waved a grubby wine
bottle at me.

  “Way! Way!” he bawled. “I bear
messages to Lorenzo!”

  But I spurred forward and man-
aged to seize his bridle. “Tell me,”
I said earnestly. “How goes the
fighting at Volterra?”

  He started to laugh, and finished
by hiccoughing. “Fighting?” he
echoed scornfully. “There was no
fighting/’

  “How’s that?” I persisted.

  “We marched under the walls of
the town and bade them surrender.
And”—he broke off to swig wine—
“and they did!” More gulping laugh-
ter over something he deemed a joke.
“Now let me ride on with my dis-
patches, young sir.”

  “One word more,” I begged but
he struck at me with the bottle.

  It was of stone, and heavy, but I
flung up my forearm to save my
head and sustained only a musty

drenching. With a prick of the spur
I forced my gray horse close against
his mount, shifting my hand from
his bridle to his collar, and with the
other hand I wrenched the bottle
away from him.

  “Why is the army not returning?”
I demanded and shook him hard.

  He lost his fierceness but not his
joy over what had happened.

 “You cannot guess?” he flung
back, with a soldier’s contempt for
one who does not understand mili-
tary routine. “The lads are plunder-
ing. What else? So should I be
plundering if—”

  I pushed the wine bottle back into
his fist and let him go. With whip
and spur I sped on my way. But
when I arrived I was too late, even
if I had had the power and knowl-
edge to divert that misdeed.

VOLTERRA gushed flame from
within her walls. Around the
town capered the victorious troops,
some of them drunker than the cour-
ier I had met, others staggering un-
der burdens of loot. Even from afar
I heard yells and laughter. The
camp, a great field of tents beneath
the hill that supported the town,
was to the eye almost deserted and
into it I spurred. By chance I came
almost immediately to the com-
mander’s pavilion and there I found
Federigo d’Urbino, sitting alone.

  He slouched forward on his fold-
ing chair, his long black-tufted chin
clutched in a hard hand. His face
was as somber as his armor was
bright. He glared up as I swung out
of the saddle.

  “You come with dispatches from
Florence, I make no doubt,” he
growled. “Ride back and tell that
blood-drinker, Lorenzo, that I will
never draw sword for him again, not
if he seek to buy me with all the
treasure of Croesus.”

  “What is this drivel?” I snapped
back. “Is not this atrocity your
bidding?” In my revulsion I forgot
that I was calling to account the
TWICE IN TIME	65

foremost soldier of the peninsula.
But he only shook his head.

  “Not my bidding—Lorenzo’s. I
have a reputation as a gentleman
and a merciful Christian.”

  “To be sure it was Lorenzo’s bid-
ding,” said a voice behind me, a
voice that often had a way of break-
ing in on conversations. “You, my
dear young Cousin, heard Lorenzo
speak to. me, give me a message.”

  I whirled upon Guaracco, thrust-
ing my angry face into his. “You
dared order this pillage and destruc-
tion as though you were Lorenzo’s
agent?”

  “Aye, that I did,” he admitted
with the utmost good cheer. “You
can bear me witness before Ser
Federigo. His Magnificence was
plain—‘That physician is often most
cruel—’ ”

  “So you interpreted his thought-
less speech, you murdering dog!”
I almost choked and out of my scab-
bard I swept my blade. “Draw be-
fore I cut you down and rid Earth
of your eternal deviltry!”

  The red beard rustled in his old
smile of mockery. “I have no sword.
Leo,” he said as though in chiding
reminder. “I bear only—this.”
From under the fringe of his
mantle his hand stole into view, with
his self-invented pistol ready cocked.
Even at that, I might have fallen
upon him and forced him to shoot,
perhaps killing me, but Federigo
d’Urbino, who did not recognize tjiat
deadly little weapon for what it was,
sprang up and caught my arm.

  “Do not add one more murder to
this massacre, young sir,” he begged
me. “It is possible that Ser Guarac-
co truly misunderstood. Yet—” He
turned away. “Somehow I must stop
these fiends at their hell’s work.”
Left alone with me Guaracco
stepped warily out of my reach,
pistol still leveled. “It is true that
I urged Lorenzo’s words upon the
army and it was none too loath to
sack the town. I have even taken a
piece of loot myself. Come and see.”

  At some time during that speech
he had brought his other hand into
view. Something gleamed softly and
slyly between thumb and finger—
his great lustrous pearl, full of
spells.

  I fought against its power as
against a crushing weight and in-
deed I did not lose my wits. But
I grew tremulous and vague of
thought and let him coax me to
sheathe my sword.

  “Come and see,” he repeated and
I went with him, slowly and a little
drunkenly, to a tent not far from
the commander’s.

  And there he showed me what he
had seized from some Volt err an shop
or warehouse. A great soapy block
of alum, reflecting subdued gray
and blue lights, lay upon a length of
canvas. It was almost exactly cubi-
cal and a good yard along the edge.

  “I knew that I must get hold of
this piece,” Guaracco told me, “and
sp I passed on Lorenzo’s orders. You
must not blame me, Leo, if I show
scientific zeal.”

  Some worse motive had really
caused him to start the cruelties
but I gazed at the greasy-looking
crystal and its light seemed to drive
out some of his spell. In it I saw
even a gleam of hope. It would help
me to a completion of the time re-
flector. Then I would be quit of the
Renaissance, its frustrations and
fantasies. Above all, I would be quit
of the abominable Guaracco.

CHAPTER XIV
Almost

NOW if ever can I offer proof that
    this is not fiction. If it were and

I were the hero, I would have tried
to slaughter Guaracco there in the
camp before sacked Volterra despite
his triumphant exhibition of the
mammoth alum-crystal, despite his
66	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

ready explanations, despite the pistol
he kept ready in his hand. That
would have been the honorable, the
courageous, the dramatic course.

  But it happens that the story is
true and that I was and am of hu-
man clay. For two years Guaracco
had alternately intimidated and ca-
joled me with judicious applications
of hypnotic influence. My ultimate
emotion was only one of hopeful re-
lief. If this be shameful so be it.

  We left the camp together, almost
like friends, with some peasant at-
tendants and a two-wheeled cart to
carry the piece of alum. We did not
go directly to Florence but sought
a rather rough road that took us
around and then to Guaracco’s house.
There we placed the alum, with in-
finite care and numerous helping
hands, in the cellar workshop.

  Guaracco assuredly knew more
about grinding lenses than I did.
Probably it was oqgmore twentieth-
century science he had developed
from his hypnotic interviews with
my subsconcious self. Too, the alum
was a larger and softer piece of
raw material than the fragments
of glass I had worked with. In one
day he roughed it into shape and in
two more, with the help of the
swordsmith, he made of it a perfect
double-convex lens.

  This, two feet in diameter, was a
gray-gleaming discus that dealt
weirdly with light.

AT LENGTH the time came for
the machine to be assembled. We
took our place in the same upstairs
chamber from which, in that twen-
tieth century which would now re-
claim me, I had vanished—the same
where my friend Astley waited at
my direction, prepared for my re-
turn.

  I helped to bolt the rods into a
framework and lifted into place Gua-
racco’s battery, a massive but ade-
quate thing inside a bronze case
worked over in strange bas-reliefs.

  I think that case came from the

Orient. It was to do the work I had
done with many smaller batteries
in my first reflector. Into sockets
were fitted his electric light globes,
most cunningly wrought—again by
Guaracco, in secret.

  “They are not the best," he said.
“I understand”—and he smiled
wispily, as always when he referred
to his findings through hypnosis—
‘‘that an element called vanadium is
the best for the filaments inside."

  “It is more than the best—it is
necessary,” I pronounced. That much
stuck in my mind.

  He shook his head. “I have used
manganese. That, I have come to
believe"—again his wispy smile—
“is almost as good. Obtainable too,
as vanadium is not." He cocked his
lustrous eyes upward. “Did you not
once predict, my dear adopted cous-
in, that a Genoese friend of the Ves-
pucci family—Colombo—would dis-
cover a new world in the west?”

   “I did."

  “And is not vanadium to be mined
in those latitudes? . . . Just so. But
not elsewhere. We must make this
substance serve."

  He studied the camera apparatus,
slipped the lens of alum into place
and secured it with clamps. Then he
set the time gauge.

  “May first, nineteen thirty-nine,"
he said aloud. “And so much allow-
ance for the coming change in calen-
dar which you predict. It was on
May first, nineteen thirty-nine that
your friend was to bring in a car-
cass from which your structure
would be reapproximated, eh?” He
straightened up from his tinkering.
“Now, Leo, do you wish to say good-
by to Lisa?"

  I had not forgotten her. Rather I
had fought against thinking too
much of this sweet restrained girl
whom I had refused as a gift from
Guaracco but to whom my heart
turned in spite of all. His speaking
her name wakened certain resolu-
tions I had made. I left the room
immediately.
TWICE IN TIME	67

SHE was lingering in the upper
hall just outside the door, dressed
in a girdled gown of blue and a
bonnetlike headdress. Her dark
eyes gleamed with tears—like stars.

  “Lisa!” I called her in a voice I
could not keep steady. “Lisa, child,
I have come to say—to say—”

  “Farewell?” she tried to finish for
me and her face drooped down into
her hands. I could not but catch her
in my arms and kiss her wet cheeks.

  “Don’t cry,” I begged her. “Don’t,
my dear. Listen, while I swear to
come back, to hurry back—”

  “We shall not meet again,” Lisa
sobbed.

  “I will come back,” I insisted.
“Since this second machine remains
here it will take us eventually into
the age from whence 1 came and
then—”

  “Us,” she repeated, trying to un-
derstand.

  “I will rescue you from this cen-
tury and this fantastic world and
chain of sorrows,’'* I promised.

  Guaracco cleared his throat. We
looked up, and moved apart, for his
head was thrusting itself around the
edge of the door.

  “Lisa,” he said, “I leave certain
preparations in your hands. At this
time tomorrow you will bring into
the room with a machine a slaught-
ered calf—”

  Turning from the girl, as Guarac-
co continued to talk I hurried into
the room and closed the door behind
me. I saw that the power of the
machine was turned on, the light
gleaming blue-gray through the lens,
the misty screen sprung up in the
framework. Once passed it was 1939
beyond. . . .

  And then I saw that Guaracco was
removing the last of his clothes.

  “What does this mean ?” I de-
manded of him.

  He confronted me, a naked figure
of baskety leanness. “I have decided
to make the journey through time
instead of you.”

  “But I—” The words broke on

my astonished lips.

  “No arguments,” said Guaracco.
“It is too late.” And he sprang into
the midst of the framework and
through the veil of fog.

  For a moment I saw him beyond
in the room, as fragile as a man of
soap-bubbles, less than a ghost. 'I
gazed, waiting for him to fade away
completely. But his substance thick-
ened again, took back its color. I
saw the pink of his skin, the red of
his beard, the gleam of his abashed
eyes. He staggered on the floor as
on the deck of a ship. He was still
in his own age. The reflector was a
failure.

  I laughed triumphantly, almost
jauntily, and half sprang at him. But
he slumped down on a chair, still
naked. So much gloom had fallen
around and upon him that part of
my anger left me. My clenched fists
relaxed, my denunciation stuck in
my throat. He had tried to trick
me, to shove himself into my own
age at my expense—but it had not
worked. I only paraphrased Robert
Burns.

“The best-laid plans of mice and
men,” I taunted, “go oft astray.”
He looked up and stared at me for
a full minute—yes, at least sixty
seconds—before making any reply.

  “I can understand your feelings,”
he muttered then, as humbly as a
child caught in a jam closet. “Once
more, I thought, I had tricked my
way ahead of you. But I reap the
reward of my sinful vanity.”

  I was amazed. This was nothing
like Guaracco. “Do not tell me,” I
jeered, “that you repent.”

  His hand wrung the point of his
beard. “Is it not permitted the
proudest and foulest wrongdoer to
say that he has done ill?” His head
bowed almost upon his bare scrawny
knees. “Leo, let me make my poor
excuses. My heart was full of zeal
for what I should behold and learn
five centuries in the future. It would
be to me what heaven is to the true
churchman. And now, without even
68

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

a glimpse—”

  At last he rose. He held out a
trembling hand. He seemed suddenly
grown old and frail. “Do not laugh
or reproach. I have been deceitful
but let me make amends. We shall be
true scientists and philosophers to-
gether. Will you not forgive and
take me as your friend?”

  I could not exult over so patently
broken an adversary and his manner
of earnest humility disarmed me. I
took his hand. At once he straight-
ened up and his voice and bearing
captured some of the old sprightli-
ness.

  “That is better, Cousin Leo—for
we are kinsmen in taste and direc-
tion at least. What wonders shall
we not work together! The word
will hear of us!”

  As he spoke a commotion and the
sound of an excited voice came from
down below us.

  I being dressed, ran down in
place of Guaracco.

  Botticelli stood facing Lisa. He
was mud-spattered and panting as
from swift riding and his plump
pleasant face was full of grave con-
cern.

  “Leo,” he said at once, “I risk my
career, perhaps my life, in warning
you. Fly and at once!”

  “At once?” I echoed, scowling
amazement. “WThy?”

  He gestured excitedly. “Do not
bandy words, man,” he scolded me.
“Begone, I say! Lorenzo has signed
a writ for your arrest. You are a
doomed man.”

  My mouth fe1! oit seemed to
me, a good twelve inches.

  “It is because r>f what happened at
Volterra,” Botticelli plunged on.
“That town was sacked because of
you. Lorenzo wanted alum for your
flying machine.”

  “Aye and I got alum—”

  “But you did not make a Avine:
machine with it. Criticism has
flamed up over the treatment of the
Volterrans and Lorenzo needs a
scapegoat. When Guaracco informed

  him that you had used it deceitfully
for another purpose—”

  “Guaracco!” I roared.

  I saw his plan now, to usurp my
place at the time reflector, leaving
me to imprisonment, perhaps death,
on a trumped-up charge. I took a
step toward the stairs for I wanted
that scoundrel’s blood.

  But Botticelli came hurrying after
me and caught my arm. “I hear gal-
loping hoofs, Leo! The officers are
coming. Run, I tell you! Run!”

  At that moment the door burst
open and two officers rushed in.

      CHAPTER XV
      Santi Pelagrini

ELIBERATELY I gazed at the
men who had entered so uncere-
moniously. “You are officers?” I de-
manded. “You fire to arrest me?
Where is your warrant?”

  “Here it is.”

  The chief of them drew his sword.
I was unarmed, having laid aside
even my dagger for the attempt to
pass through time. Resistance was
useless and I spoke only to save poor
Botticelli from possible punishment
for riding to warn me.

  “You will get no reward after all,”

I addressed him with simulated
spitefulness. “These gentlemen will
take me to Lorenzo, not you. It’s well
for you that they came. Your effort
to arrest me misfit have wound up
in your getting hurt. I advise you
to stick to paint daubing, Ser.
Sandro, and not to play catch-poll
again.”

  He stared at me in pained sur-
prise, then in grateful understand-
ing. I walked out, closely guarded
by the patrol, and was mounted upon
a spare horse. Then we started—
but away from Florence.

  “Did not the Magnificent send you
to seize me?” I demanded of the
TWICE IN TIME	69

leader. “Take me before him that
my case be heard.”

  They did not reply to that or to
other demands. We went southeast
mile after mile, leaving the good
main road for shorter and rougher
stretches. Once again I asked where
we were going and what my fate
would be and once again I was un-
answered. We stopped that night at
a little house where a grape grower
gave us bread and cheese and wine
and subsequently shelter. I slept
in front of the fireplace with the
men standing watch over me in turn.

  By mid-morning of the next day
we rode into the seaport of Rimini
and straight to the stone wharfs.
The leader of our party sent a mes-
senger to call ashore the captain of
a small lateen-rigged ship riding
close in at anchor. He talked aside
with this captain, and gave him an
official-looking document. Then I
was taken from my horse and led
forward.

  “Go with this ship master,” or-
dered the chief officer.

  I	protested loudly and one of the
officers gave me a rough shove. Next
instant I had knocked him down and
the instant after that the others had
swarmed upon me, throwing me to
the stones of the wharf and pinion-
ing me.

  Before I was put into a skiff to go
to the vessel irons were procured—
broad heavy cuffs, connected by a
single link and fastened with coarse
locks— and clamped upon my wrists.
There was no further sense in resist-
ance. I wras rowed out, hoisted to
the half-deck and placed in a closet-
like compartment off the captain’s
cabin. We sailed at noon.

  The captain did deign to tell me
a little of what was to befall. “You
are ordered to imprisonment, sir,”
he said, “at the Fortaleza degli Santi

  *	This Fortress of the Holy Pilgrims must have
been located off the coast of Albania, which
country was almost entirely overrun by invading
Turks during the fifteenth eentury, though no
record of It seems to exist nor any concerning the
Order of the Holy Pilgrims.

Pelagrini—the Fortress of the Holy
Pilgrims.”*

  I	had never heard of it and said
so.

  .“It is a great grace and service to
heaven,” the captain elaborated.
“Holy men built it two good centu-
ries gone for an abbey. But the
heathen Turk, who flouts true belief
and seeks to conquer us all, has taken
the coastline, all save this fortress
alone. Because we would hold our
own, even in the teeth of Islam, it is
garrisoned by the Holy Pilgrims.”

  He told me about the Order of the
Holy Pilgrims, as well. They were
military monks, not powerful or
highborn, like the Templars of the
Knights of St. John, but simple
monks, armed and trained to fight.
As he described them, they had been
originally a band of common soldiers
who, reaching Jerusalem at the high
tide of the Crusades, forsook the
world and entered the church. After
the ousting of the Christians from
the Holy Land they had survived and
fought on, and now stubbornly de-
fended the island on which their
fortress-priory stood.

AND they were to be my jailers. It
did me no good to protest my in-
nocence and my right to justice. Lo-
renzo’s anger, stimulated by the lies
of Guaracco, had caused him to doom
me thus to imprisonment and forget-
fulness without benefit of trial. He
or any other ruler of the time was
able to do so, putting away a man as
easily as he might put away a book
or a suit of clothes. I could be thank-
ful that he had not executed me. Or
could I?

  Five days we sailed before a
light breeze, south and slightly east-
ward over the waters of the Adri-
atic. I was not permitted to go on
deck but there was a latticed port
and I saw as quickly as any lookout
the two rakish galleys with crescent-
blazoned banners that gave us chase
on the fifth day.

  For awhile it was a close race and
70	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

I thought I might soon exchange my
enforced idleness in the little cabin
for labor at a galley oar. Then guns
spoke to our front, a cheer went up
from our sailors and we drew nigh to
the defending shores of the island,
where stood the fortress of the Holy
Pilgrims.

  I was allowed on deck at last. I
saw the island as a rocky protuber-
ance from the blue ocean, its flattish
top green with growth and but a
single landing place—an arm of the
sea, extending almost to the foot of
the great square-towered castle of
gray stone that dominated all points
of the rock. A boat was put off with
myself, the captain and some sailors
to row us. I could see, afar off, the
sullen Turkish galleys.

WE CAME to the mouth of the
inlet and found that it bore
two great lumpish towers of ma-
sonry. one at either brink, for the
stretching of a ch'un if an enemy
were to be held off.* A skiff came
forward to meet us, rowed by two
tanned shaven-headed men in black
serge robes. A third stood upright
with his foot on the thwart, a cross-
bow in his hands. Its cord was
drawn, a bolt ready in the groove.

  “Who ai*e you?” he called in a
clear challenging voice.

  “Christian vessel with a message
and a prisoner for vou,” renh'ed our
captain. A ierk of thp crossbowman’s
shaven skull granted us leave to en-
ter the inlet. I could see that the
monks of the fortress wore each a
symbol on his breast—a black cross,
outlined in white, with a white
cockle-shell at the center, emblematic
of church and pilgrimage. The two
boats rowed inland to a dock of mas-
sive mortared stones, where we
landed.

  One of the monk oarsmen went
swiftly ahead with the papers the

  *	Till? chain defense for a harbor or landing
was long a favorite with fortresses. As late as
the American Revolutionary War the British were
prevented from cominsr up the Hudson by a chain
stretched across at West Point.

captain had brought, while the rest
of us mounted more leisurely the
paved slope that led to the great
gate of the castle. I looked linger-
ingly upon the outdoors, which I
might well be leaving for a term
of years if not forever.

  There were some goats in a little
herd—a series of rock-bordered
fields where monks with looped-up
gowns were hoeing crops, apparently
of beans and barley—an arbor of
rra"e":nes. At the few spots where
the steep shores relented enough to
allow one to reach the seaside,
parties of fishermen seined for sar-
dines or speared for mullet.

 The big gateway of colossal
timbers, fastened with ancient
copper bolts, stood open and allowed
us to pass through a courtvard. In-
side stood a row of black-robed men.
a-ned w'th spears, apparently tak-
ing p?rt in a most unpriestly mili-
tary drill. They were all tanned,
l^an, and hard-fa^ed and handled
their nikes with +be precis;on and
d;sci>i’ne of trained soldiers, which
indeed they were. Into the castle hall
we went, then down a corridor to a
pla’n windowless cell, lighted by a
candle.

  “Father Augustine!” respectfully
called the monk who had conducted

us.

  Someone moved from behind the
plain table of deal nlanks and stood
up to greet us. He was a gaunt
fierce man, who wore a robe and
symbol in no way differing from the
others, yet I knew at once that here
was the master of the priory.

  His shoulders rose high and broad,
so that he seemed a great black capi-
tal Y of a man, and his face, dark
as a Moor’s, was seamed and cross-
hatched with scars. His nose had
been smashed flat by some heavy
blow, the right corner of his mouth
was so notched that a tooth gleamed
through and his left eyelid lay flat
over an empty socket. The sole re-
maining eye quested over us with
stern appraisal.
TWICE IN TIME

71

THE monk stood at attention, and
offered the letter that the captain
had brought. Father Augustine
opened and read it quickly, then
spoke in the deep voice of practised
command.

  “Go, Brother Pietro, and fetch
Giacopo the clerk. He shall write to
Lorenzo de Medici that this prisoner
will be held here as he desires.”
The monk made a gesture similar
to a salute, and departed as briskly
as a well trained orderly. Father
Augustine faced the captain. “Will
you partake of our humble hospi-
tality, my son?”

  “Gladly, Holy Father,” was the
captain’s reply. “I dare not leave my
anchorage under your guns until
yonder dog galleys of Mahound de-
part in any case.”

  The notched mouth spread in a
smile. “Nay, they shall depart with-
in the hour. Our own warcraft will
see to that. We have two armed
boats of our own and not a Holy Pil-
grim of us but is worth three of the
best of the Turkish pirates, whose
feet have fast hold of hell. I shall
order a party out to battle.”

  He came forth from the cell that
did duty as his office. I noticed that
he limped slightly, that around his
lean middle, outside the gown, was
belted a crosshilt sword.

  “Is this the prisoner?” he asked,
turning to me. “Prisoner, I call upon
you to repent your sin.”

  “I do freely repent all sins that
lie upon my soul, Father Augustine,”
I replied at once. “Of the sin with
which I stand charged before you I
cannot repent, since of it I am en-
tirely innocent. The guilty are those
who falsely procured my imprison-
ment.”

  “He is a lying dog,” grumbled the
captain but I thought that the scar-
chopped face and single eye of the
prior lit up as though he approved
my boldness.

  Then another monk arrived with
a sword at his hip and a half-pike
upon his shoulder. At Father Au-

gustine’s order he marched me away
upstairs and along a gallery above.

  We came into a corridor lined
on either side with locked doors and
full of a musty sweaty prison smell.
A porter, burly and black-gowned,
unlocked a heavy door of planking
for me and pushed me inside.

  My cell was some six feet by ten
with a wooden cot at the inner end.
Above this was a window, not more
than a foot square and blocked by
two crossbars. The walls were all
of uneven cut stones, the mortar
scraped away around each for the
depth of a full inch—the work of
many an idle prisoner. There were
a stool, a jug for water, a wooden
refuse bucket. The door that
clanged shut behind nje had a
wooden sliding panel through which
food could be given me or slops
poured forth into a gutter.

 When I stretched my hands
reached up to the ceiling overhead.
And when I knelt on my straw
mattress I saw that my window was
only a tunnel through seven feet of
wall. I looked out upon a sandy
shelf, beyond that to the sea.

  This was my home for heaven
and Lorenzo de Medici knew how
long.

CHAPTER XVI
Captivity

FOR one reason alone I pass over
the next six years in a few words.
That is because those six years were
empty—heartbreakingly empty.

I was not released from my cell
except for the reason I shall relate.

I knew no passage of time except
by the shifting of the sunlight patch
on my wall opposite the little window
and by the arrival, each noon, of
coarse food in a wooden plate and
water in a leather mug. This was
the same fare, I make no doubt, as
72

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

that of the monks who were my
jailers.

  On Sundays came a cup of wine
and I could hear the intoning of a
mass. Then I would make a mark
to denote a week’s passing under
the date which I had scratched in the
biggest stone. These weekly marks
added into months, the months into
years.

  I found myself pacing up and
down, up and down like a beast in
a cage. To break myself of that
frantic habit I spent hours at
calisthenic exercises, which served
to keep me fairly fit, and at sketching
with bits of burnt wood or
scratching pictures on the wall with
the tongue of my belt-buckle.

  My best effort was a Madonna,
amusing her haloed Son with a
flowery twig. As I worked thus I
wondered if the picture would ever
be seen by other eyes than mine. I
decided that probably it would. The
fortress was old and might last for
centuries. I might die in the cell and
another captive replace me, a cap-
tive who would look at the work of
my hands and muse idly about the
predecessor who had wrought thus.

  Nobody spoke to me, not. even the
monk who thrust in my daily ration.
And nobody watched me. In the
summer of 1474, my second in the
cell, I decided that escape was not
impossible.

  First I detached a leg of my bed-
stead and with this as a lever
wrorried the crossbars out of my win-
dow. They had been set in mortar
and had sharp points. Stealthily I
began to widen the narrow aperture,
working each night and restoring
the bars by day lest someone look
in from the outside and bring my
labors to naught.

  After a month I decided my dig-
gings adequate—but they wrere not.
Trying to wriggle through I became
jammed in the window tunnel and
there I was forced to stick until a
goat-keeper, chasing his charges
around the walls, happened to spy

my protruding head. It took two
muscular friends to drag me back
into my cell and I was marched be-
tween them to Father Augustine.

  The prior spoke sadly upon my
prideful and rebellious nature, urged
me to pray for forgiveness and a
softer heart, then sentenced me to a
term of bread and water—and a
flogging. When an attendant came
with a knotted bundle of thongs and
laid them like burning wires upon
my bared back, rage swallowed my
reason.

  A sudden jerk freed my wrists
from those who gripped them and I
tackled my flogger, threw him
heavily and clutched his throat with
both hands. Half a dozen of the
Holy Pilgrims, as ready to do battle
as to pray, dragged me free before
I could damage the whip-wielder.

  Father Augustine had watched
the incident with an appraising light
in his single eye. “You refuse to
be corrected,” pronounced he, very
coldly.

  “Keep your lash for slaves!” I
retorted passionately. “I will die be-
fore I submit!”

  To my considerable surprise he
nodded understandingly. His eye
danced a trifle and his wide lips
smiled, revealing other lean white
teeth than the one which showed
through the notch.

  “Be it so,” he granted in a more
humane tone. “I remit the flogging.
But you must be closer penned.
Brethren, put him in the cell below
his old one.”

THEY didso. The new prison was
smaller and for bed had only a
shelf under the window, spread with
musty straw. The window itself
was crossbarred and looked out upon
a face of hewn rock. This part of the
fortress was below ground and a
foot-wide trench was all that gave
me air and light.

  Gloom and closeness were new
burdens upon my soul but I had
gained one advantage—the stem ap-
TWICE IN TIME

73

proval of the prior. To him I sent
request for a lamp and pen and
paper. These were given me and I
had surcease from ineffable ennui
in writing and drawing. Among
other things I set down in outline
most of the story told here in full.
That outline is spread before me as
I write these words and is a check
against my irritably failing memory.

  I kept up my exercises too,
shadow-boxed on occasion and in-
cised more pictures upon the wall.
Even so I had many hours in which
to meditate upon the injustice of
Lorenzo’s decree concerning me and
upon the things I would do to
Guaracco if ever I came within
reach of him. Of Lisa I tried not
to think.

  In the fall of 1474 and again two
years later, attacks were made upon
the fortress. There was a cannonad-
ing from the stronghold and in re-
ply from ships. Once an effort was
made to storm us. I heard commo-
tion, fierce yells, the clash of steel.
In the end I could hear that the
austere soldiers of the church had
repulsed their assailants and for a
day the castle rang with chanted
paeans of praise.

  I grew to have a philosophic sym-
pathy with my jailers. They had
acted upon agreement with Lorenzo
in imprisoning me. They confined
me closely only because they must.
If my food was plain, my bed hard,
so w'ere theirs. For the rest they
were sincere worshipers and fierce
fighters. The world was full of worse
people.

  Thus I reasoned but still it was a
desperate struggle to' remain con-
tented and sane. I tried to remember
The Prisoner of Chillon, which had
one or two stanzas to comfort me,
the captive, but it would not come
to mind. In any case Lord Byron
would not write it for a good three
hundred and forty years.

  The spring of 1477 saw yet an-
other attack by enemies, a strong
and more stubborn effort to carry

the fortress of the Holy Pilgrims. I
could hear the battering of a wall
close to me and the overthrow of
part of it. So hot was the fight, so
narrowly balanced for an hour, that
the very jailer monk rushed from
the corridor outside my cell to help
defend the ramparts. During his
absence I had time to do a thing I
had long planned to do.

  The lamp that lighted me was an
iron saucer with a central clip to
hold aloft the wick. I ignited the
straw of my bed and, holding one
edge of the lamp saucer in a fold of
my jerkin, contrived to heat the op-
posite edge red hot. Then, with a
loose stone for a hammer and' the
bed shelf for an anvil, 1 pounded,
reheated and pounded again until
I beat that rim into a knifelike edge.
After the battle the jailer returned
but he had not heard my noisy
labors. And I began to whittle at
my wooden door.

  The planks were thick and sea-
soned almost as hard as iron. But
I persevered all that stifling sum-
mer. I counted myself lucky when,
between one dawn and the next, I
shaved away as much as a handful
of splinters. Boresome it was and
eventually heart-breaking, for my
first burrowing brought me to metal.
I dug at another place, hoping to
avoid such a barrier, but found more
—more, that is, of the same sheet.

  Eventually I had removed almost
all the door’s inner surface and
found myself confronted with a
copper plate, a central layer,
probably with as much wood outside
as I had already disposed of. My
tappings and proddings convinced
me that it was solidly massy except
for the small slide-covered opening
for food.

  I am afraid I both cursed and
sulked. I had no cutting tools. The
blunt-edged piece of glass I used
for an occasional shave was far
from adequate. Even if I had had
tools—file, chisel or drill—I would
not have dared use them for the
74

noise would attract guards. What
then?

  Acid came to mind—sulphuric
acid. But where to get it? The
stones of my cell were volcanic,
might contain sulphides. But how
could I burn or distill them? Even if
I got the acid, would not its strong
odor bring investigation? I ap-
proached the problem from another
viewpoint, considering not the best
acid but the most available.

  Chilly fall was upon us and the
sharp strong wine was served daily
instead of on Sunday only. Once
again I was inspired.

WHEN my next food was brought
I pleaded for a little vinegar to
medicine a chest ailment. It was
brought me in a saucer and I steeped
in it some shavings whittled from
my door. When they seemed sour
enough, I placed them at the bottom
of my wooden bucket.

  Into this, day after day, I slowly
trickled my ration of wine. It pro-
duced a greater quantity of excellent
vinegar—at least for metal-destroy-
ing purposes—and after tasting it
I felt sure of my acid. Acetic acid,
perhaps eight or ten percent at the
most.

  Painfully scrabbling with a spoon
in the trench outside my window, I
gained enough clay earth to mix with
water and fashion into clumsy
basins and jars. These I cautiously
hardened in another fire, and em-
ployed to hold my supply of vinegar
as I increased it, also for other
things.

  For instance I constructed a really
workable distillery—a narrow-
mouthed vase or bottle, suspended
above a fire which T fed with chips
from the door and furniture and
straw from my bed. As winter
came on I heated vinegrar in this
and the vapor passed through a hol-
low reed which I cooled with b’ts of
ice from just outside my barred
window. The condensed drops I
caught in my cup* They were not

pure acetic acid but a liquid with a
high content.

  These labors lasted for months. I
speak of them briefly, saying noth-
ing of the trial and error, the
ludicrous failures and the chance
successes that finally made my skill
and product adequate. At length,
well after Christmas of 1477, I be-
gan my attack upon the copper
plate that barred me from freedom.

  At the height of my forehead and
again at the height of my knee I
constructed clay troughs against the
metal. These I filled and kept filled
with the acid. When the action
proved slight I hit upon the device
of adding salt, procured by soaking
my preserved meat and then
evaporating the brine, to the liquid.

  Thus I got a crude form of hydro-
chloric acid which made an ap-
preciable impression. I constantly
scraped awav the weakened particles
of metal and replenished my supply
of salted acid. I wrought for months
and was finally rewarded when the
last of the copper along those two
narrow lines was eaten away.

  The perpendicular acidulation was
more difficult but I managed it by
fashioning two clay tubes at the
edges of the door, open at the top.
rather like the covered tunnels built
by tropical ants. These I filled again
and aora:n. sometimes pulling them
down to nrv out the digested copper,
then building them afresh for new
attacks.

  Here too 1 was successful and one
day in February I was able to pry
awav the whole rectangle of metal
within the comnass of my four acid-
cut. channels. There was more wood
beyond but. heartened by my tri-
umph, I scraned and chiseled until
the door was almost as thin as paste-
board. To the outside view it might
apnear as strong as ever.

  At middav of April 16. 1478, I
made mv b*d for escape.

  The attendant came to my door,
pushed back the slide and stooped
to thrust in my food. I had been
TWICE IN TIME	75

waiting for an hour, tense and
ready. As I heard him outside I
sprang, bursting through the thin
wood like a clown through a paper
hoop.

  Landing on the monk’s unsuspect-
ing back I whipped an arm beneath
his chin, shutting off his breath. He
could not cry out, and his struggles
availed nothing. I choked him until
his limbs grew slack, then stripped
off his robe. I donned this and
pushed him, senseless, through the
smashed door into my cell.

  Then I headed down the corridor,
cowl over my face, his keys in my
hand. I unlocked the door at the
end, mounted steps and came to an
upper level. Another corridor I
traversed with measured tread, as
though deep in meditation, and none
challenged me.

  I came into the main hall, saw the
doorway to the courtyard. Beyond
would be the open, the beach, a boat.
I would row away, they would think
that a brother had gone fishing.
After that I would seek land, even
among the Turks, But a voice spoke
at my elbow.

  “You pass me without saluting,
brother.”

  Father Augustine! He had fallen
into step beside me. I lifted a hand
to my hooded brow and his single
eye fastened upon it.

  “How white your flesh, brother. I
thought that every monk of our
order was tanned brown by God’s
sunlight. Who are you?”

THERE was nothing for it but
battle. I sprang at him.

  Surprise was on my side. I tripped
him and fell heavily upon him. But
that old priest-soldier, lame and
half-blind, was as strong as I, as
fierce. I clutched and pressed his
throat but he caught my two little
fingers in his hands, bent them pain-
fully backward until I quit the grip.

  His thumbs drove into the inner
sides of my biceps, torturing nerves
between the muscles, and I rolled

free of him. We came up to our feet.
I struck him heavily on the jaw and
his one eye blinked but he did not
stagger or flinch.

  Strongly grappling me around the
waist, he rushed me back against a
wall and so held me, despite my
pummeling fists in his face, while
a dozen monks, swords and axes in
hand, rushed in from all directions.
In an instant I was secured and
Father Augustine stepped clear of
me, dabbing at a trickle of blood
from his scarred nose. He panted
and grinned as if he had enjoyed
the scrimmage.

  “Here’s a stout sinner,” he
growled. “Never did the blessed
angel clip Father Jacob more
strongly. Thank you for the bout,
my son. Put him in my office.”

  There I was kept under close
guard while the chief stumped away
to investigate.

  He returned after half an hour
and dismissed the guards but kept
his dagger drawn lest I attack him.

  “I am amazed at the cunning and
courage and labor of your attempt,”
he began. “How did you manage to
cut through the door, copper and
all?”

  I described my method and he lis-
tened with interest. Several times
he asked me to amplify my remarks.
At length he smiled. “You have
science and inspiration. How great
would be your works if they were
turned to honest godly uses!”

  “Being held prisoner I can turn
them only to an effort at escape,” I
replied.

  “Aye, that. Your months of toil,
so brilliantly planned and so wearily
carried out, came to naught within
short minutes. A tragedy.” Father
Augustine paused and meditated.
Then, “My son, what if I gave you
freedom?”

  “Freedom!” I echoed him hope-
fully.

  “Within limits, of course. I could
take you from that cell and let you
live among us. You could work more
76

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

science, with true materials to aid
you instead of such makeshifts as
you fashioned in prison.” He gazed
at me encouragingly. “Say but the
word—swear that you will not seek
to flee from this island—”

  “I am sorry,” I broke in, “but I
cannot so doom myself.”

  “Doom yourself? But you are now
held by iron bars and guards.”
“And by a false charge, brought
against me by a vile rascal,” I
finished for him. “I thank you, good
Father, for your offer but I live
only to escape and to avenge myself.
I cannot give you a parole.”

  He shook his scarred head sadly.
Going to the door he called his
monks. “Hither, some of you,” he
commanded. “We must find this
fellow a straiter prison still.”

  A new figure pushed through the
circle of black gowns, a man in the
dress of the world, all parti-colored
hose and plum-purole mantle, with
a gay beard and curling locks.
Plainly he was a visitor from some
Italian city.

  “Surely,” quoth he, “this is Ser
Leo. the artist and scientist, who is
held captive bv order of Lorenzo
the Magnificent.”

  “Aye, that.” Father Augustine
nodded. “You know him?”

  “I know him,” was the reply.
“Where doth he go now?”

  “To an oubliette, I fear. From
there he will need winprs to rise.”
Two of the armed brothers had
torn away my disp-uis’ng robe and
now marched me down steps, more
steps, to a level of natural rock
where no light shone save a torch.
One of them hoisted a great iron
trap-door. I looked into a bottle-
shaped pit, that was at least twelve
feet deep.

  At that moment the upper levels
of the castle wakened to noise—a
blown trumpet, a chorus of yells.
The two monks turned to look. I
tightened my sinew's for a desperate
fight against them before I might be
hurled into that tomblike prison. A

flying figure came downstairs.

  “The infidel Turks! Their galleys
blacken the seas! Come to the de-
fense !”

  “As soon as we lower this captive
into—” began one of my guards.

  “No!” A bearded face looked over
the black-clad shoulder of the news-
bringer. It was the visitor who had
recognized me. “Bring him along.
He will help fight!”

  “Well thought of!” came the deep
voice of Father Augustine, higher
on the stairs. “Free every captive
who can bear arms! Let them fight
for life!”

  We all raced up the steps to-
gether.

CHAPTER XVII
Defense of the Fortress

MOUNTING to battlements
around the upper wall of the
castle we saw that the sea was in-
deed full of craft. There were gal-
leys, a full dozen, many smaller
feluccas and open rowboats, swarm-
ing thick as a school of mullet.
Drums resounded from the larger
ships—and horns. Our own bugles
braved back defiance.

  Father Augustine was rasping
orders like any seasoned captain.
“Man and load each gun,” he com-
manded. “Line the walls—keep
lookout for where thev may land.”
His eye found me. “Ha, wrestler!
Canst use a sword?” He motioned
to an aide, who thrust a hilt into my
hand. “You have fought vour fellow
Christians overlong. Fight now
against infidels!”

  I shifted .the w'eapon to my left
fist, trying its balance. At an op-
posite rampart stood the man who
had recommended my joining the de-
fense and to him I made my way.

  “I do not know you, sir, though
you know me,” I said. “Thanks
TWICE IN TIME

77

for saving me from that spider’s
hole into which they would have
thrown me.”

  “We will speak more of it anon.”
He pointed to where, inside the little
harbor, lay a trim sailing vessel
among the boats of the Holy Pil-
grims. “Yonder is my craft and up-
on it a fair lady who must not set
foot on this monk-owned island. I
pray heaven naught befalls either
of them.”

  But I showed him where some of
our men strung a heavy chain at the
mouth of the inlet. That would pre-
vent the approach of enemy boats,
which in any case sought to storm
us from the other side.

  At that point the wall dropped
straight to the sea and had 4 been
badly damaged not long before—per-
haps in the fight a spring ago when
I had heard crumbling of stones.
The brothers had built it up roughly
with broken masonry and spaded
earth, faced it with timbers and
logs, but it was still the weak spot
of the defenses.

  Even the stone flooring at the
top had collapsed and was replaced
with planking—while instead of an
adequate parapet a work of earth-
filled goatskins had been laid in and
topped by a great log, nearly a hun-
dred feet long.* From this log ran
back crosspieces, lashed on as slant-
ing supports.

  Here the fire from the galleys was
concentrated. Round shot tore holes
in the goatskins and let out cas-
cades of the heaped earth, while a
blizzard of arrows and slings picked
off such of the brothers as manned
the log-topped parapet. The others
crouched low.

  “They will seek to carry this
quarter,” announced Father Augus-
tine sagely, limping across to the
log.

  His gown, looped up to kilt length,
showed great steel greaves upon his

  *	A log of this length was by no means rare in
the Fifteenth Century, well before the deforesta-
tion of Italy.

shins and he had thrown back his
cowl to don a plumeless helmet. A
bolt from a crossbow struck his
shoulder, then glanced away. He
must have been wearing a steel
cuirass under his robe.

  “Aye,” he called, “here they come,
a hell’s spawn of boats, under their
fellows’ fire! Keep down, brethren,
until they mount our wall. Then the
fire must slacken and we will meet
the unbelievers with an argument
they will understand.”

  Drawing his sword, he spat be-
tween big hand and worn hilt.

  I dared look over the log. A shoal
of boats swept swiftly toward us
from the galleys, boats filled with
gesticulating and howling Turks. I
saw the glitter of their mail, the
curves of their flourished scimitars,
the upward jut of helmet spikes
from their turbans. A moment later
a jagged little stone sang upward
and against my forehead—slung
like David’s pebble from a sling.
Like Goliath I fell sprawling on my
back, half dazed and almost drop-
ping my sword.

  Father Augustine leaned farther
from his point of vantage, careless
of the rain of missiles.

  “They raise ladders!” he cried.
“Here they mount!” He turned to
his followers. “Strike, brethren, for
the true faith!”

  I made shift to rise, a little
shakily, and watched as a line of
blaek-robes came swiftly forward
over the planked-in floor, swords and
axes and halberds at the ready. The
sound of firing had ceased from gal-
leyward as Father Augustine had
predicted. A 'moment later, a
yodeling cry rose from below.

  ‘ ‘ Ululululallahuakbar !”

  One prolonged bellow of challenge
and of profession. Then the outer
side of our log was lined with tur-
baned bearded heads.

  The storming party was upon us,
eager for trouble: Nor could they
have come to a better place to find
it.
78

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

  The Holy Pilgrims hurled them-
selves upon the attackers, calling
upon the name of every saint in the
calendar, hewing and thrusting like
fiends instead of clergymen. At their
head and in the hottest press nimbly
hobbled Father Augustine, his
straight sword playing like a strik-
ing adder against a whole forest of
scimitars.

  Something impelled me in his di-
rection and in good time for him.
While his point was wedged in the
neck-bone of one adversary another
charged close and, catching him by a
fold of his gown, slashed a scimitar
viciously at his head.

  The blow was turned by Father
Augustine’s helm but its force stag-
gered him and a second effort beat
him to his knees. With a whoop the
Turk lifted his blade for a third
and finishing cut but at that moment
I hurled myself between, my own
steel forestalling his.

  He was a deep-chested fellow,
brown as chocolate, with mad foam
on his black beard.

  “Ya NazaHni!” he snarled. “Ya
’bn kalbf”*

  And he fell furiously upon me.
But for all his fierceness I was more
than his match. First my slicing
lunge laid open his face, my second
bit into the side of his neck. He
collapsed, bleeding from nose to
mouth, to die even as I turned away.

  The surviving Turks were reeling
back, whipped along by the savage
garrison. They tumbled down their
ladders and rowed hurriedly away
in their boats under a new curtain
of shot and arrows.

  Father Augustine was up again,
glancing around to estimate the
situation.

  “We suffered sorely but they
suffered worse,” he commented.
“What says Holy Writ? ‘Blessed be
the Lord my strength, who teacheth
my hands to war and my fingers to
fight.’ ” He turned his eye on me.

 •Arabic: "Oh. Christian! Oh, son of a dog'!”
 Perhaps spoken by a Saracen rover.

“Thanks for the rescue, my son.
Yet I make no doubt that with
heaven’s help I could have risen and
overthrown him. Whence will come
the next assault?”

 FOUND out soon enough.
Three great galleys moved
against the mouth of our inlet. Our
gun crews toiled madly but could
not batter them back. When the
galleys had drawn close a great
throng of little black figures dived
overside and began to swim for the
inlet.

  “By heaven, I see that they carry
axes!” spoke up mjr friend, the
bearded visitor. “They will attack
the c^ain! If it is cut they will come
in and seize our ships!”

  “A sortie! A sortie!” yelled Father
Augustine. “Out, brethren, and meet
them in the water!”

  He led the rush downward him-
self, leaving only the armed
prisoners and a dozen black-robes to
hold the upper ramparts. We
watched, fascinated, from above as
the monks burst from the great
gate, hurried down to the water’s
edge. Some of them were shot by
crossbows on the galleys but the
greater part reached the water and
swam forward to meet the Turks.
There was a fierce clumsy melee in
the waves that lapped along either
side of the chain.

  “The brethren triumph!” pointed
out a monk at my side. “Look, the
forgotten of God are retreating,
swimming away.”

  “They do so more readily than I
had hoped,” I replied, thinking of
the previous stubborn assault. My
own words gave me a new disturb-
ing wonder. “What,” I demanded,
“if it were a false attack to with-
draw us from our own defense?”
Even as I spoke I saw that the
galleys were pulling,away with all
their oars, skirting the rocks nar-
rowly and speeding around to the
point from which the earth-mended
wall had once been stormed.
TWICE IN TIME

79

  “Rally! Rally!” I shouted and led
the rush across to the rampart of
earth-bags and log.

  It was as I had been inspired to
guess. The sea w-as full of boats
again, scores of them, rowing swiftly
forward to the attack. A spatter of
shafts and shot made the few of us
who were left put our heads down.

  “What is to be done?” demanded
a wide-eyed brother with a smear
of gore on his chin. “See, their
whole force comes to this side, more
than the first time! Their rush will
beat us back and our comrades out-
side, returning from the chain, will
not arrive in time to hold the castle!”

  “Stand to the rampart, hurl down
their ladders!” stoutly shouted an
armed captive.

  As he leaned forward to suit ac-
tion to word a crossbow bolt
whacked into him and he crumpled
across the log, dead. The rest of us
crouched low, swords in hand, de-
termined to die hard.

  I found myself kneeling beside
one of the lashed crosspieces that
propped the great log which was our
temporary coping. It was none too
firm, that crosspiece, I judged. And
again I was inspired.

  “Hark ye, all!” I cried at the top
of my voice. “We can save ourselves!
Form in parties by these cross-
pieces! Clutch them in your arms!
If we bear with all our strength at
once, it will force the great log for-
ward and outward!”

  “To what good-?” demanded an-
other.

  “To overthrow the ladders as we
cannot with such a fire against us.
Do not argue, friends, but do as I
say!”

  There was no time or hope other-
wise. In a trice we formed in half a
dozen knots, all crouching or kneel-
ing, our weapons flung down and
our arms wrapped around the cross-
timbers.

  Whoops and execrations rang
from beneath us, where the ladders
were being reared from the boat

bottoms to give access to our
fortress. I felt my heart race like a
drum-roll but kept my eyes steadily
on the parapet, where the spiked
ends of the ladders showed.

  “Allahuakbar!” thundered the
enemy and again a row of heads shot
up into view.

  “Now!” I shouted my loudest and
taxed all my muscles to drag for-
ward on the crosspiece I clutched.

  There was a concerted grunt from
every defender as we bore mightily
against the log. And, as I had dared
hope, so it was. The mass of timber
slid gratingly forward, as a drawer
slides from a bureau. With it swrayed
the storming ladders, so precariously
balanced. They toppled. A single
concerted shriek assailed heaven
from the many throats of those who
were suddenly hurled back down
among the boats and into the surf.

  Dragging back our timber defense
we cheered each other in wild and
thankful joy.

  That unexpected reverse gave the
Moslems pause—a blessed, blessed
pause—enough for the return and
remarshaling of the swimming
sortie led by Father Augustine. He
clapped my shoulder with a hard
hand.

  “You have saved this holy place,”
he told me, “and if it were in my
power to free you—”

  He turned away to thunder new
orders. I stood alone for the moment,
then a hand clutched my sleeve. I
turned, to see the bearded man,
whose name I did not know but who
knew me, the man whose boat was
in the little harbor below.

  “Come,” he said softly. “If he
cannot give you liberty, I can."

  “How?” I demanded, hope pound-
ing in my breast.

  He did not pause to reply but drew
me with him to the stairs and down.
We went unchallenged through the
lower part of the castle and came
to the gate. He unfastened it and
we stepped outside.

  “See,” he bade me. “The Turkish
80

WONDER STORY ANNLal

boats have all gone around to the
other side, hoping to make good that
assault which you foiled. Now is
my time to flee. I have too fast a
ship for them to catch and I will
take you along.”

  I was too amazed and thankful
to speak. A moment later we had
hurried down, sprung abroad his
half-decked sailing vessel and were
headed out for that quarter of the
sea just now unguarded by either
Holy Pilgrim or infidel Turk—the
sea beyond which lay the Italy from
which I had been carried captive
six years before.

CHAPTER XVIII
Return to Florence

JUST as soon as my feet were on
deck my enigmatic friend hustled
me into the cabin, where he left me
alone. I heard his shouted orders on
deck, felt the ship move. We sailed
out, unchallenged and unchecked,
and headed northwest. I heard the
muffled noise of a fresh attack on
the fortress but we were not pur-
sued.

  After some time the master of the
vessel appeared. He offered me a
razor, with which I thankfully took
my first decent shave. A mirror
showed me my face smooth again
but no longer fresh and boyish. My
brow Avas cleft with a brown mark,
my nose and chin had hardened and
my eyes blazed with challenge and
truculence. Over one temple rose a
purple bump, where the Turkish
stinger had struck me. Not a pretty
face.

  My rescuer was offering me new
clothes. I pulled on dark green hose
and a velvet doublet, then looked in
surprise at the cloak he offered—a
cloak of Florentine scarlet.

  “Why, it—it is mine!” I cried.
It was given me by—”

  “By Guaracco," he supplied. “Yes.
From him I took it.”

  “But Guaracco caused my im-
prisonment,” I protested.

  “He now causes your release,”
was the answer. “He knew through
spies that the Turks would attack.
He arranged that I come to the
fortress in good time for that event,
with instructions to help you escape.
It took but a word to draw you out
of your cell and into the ranks of the
defenders. After that— But you
will know all anon. Stay in this
cabin for it would be ill for any
sailor to see you and gabble in port.”

  I stayed, perforce, all that day
and for some days following. We
talked no more about my strange
rescue, and I could learn nothing
at all of the reason for it. At last,
on the morning of April 25th, we
docked. Peeping through a porthole,
I watched the mariners tie us up to
the pilings.

  I raked the shore with my eyes, on
the lookout for Guaracco. I won-
dered what I would find to say to
him.

  In the midst of this my companion
entered. “Here is a fellow-passenger
of yours, whom I at last show you,”
he said.

  With him was a slender figure,
cloaked and masked as at a carni-
val. Saying nothing this figure
handed me a folded and sealed
parchment. On the outside was the
address, written in the fashion of
the time:

THIS TO THE HAND OF MY
KINSMAN. LEO,

QUICKLY,

QUICKLY,

QUICKLYf

  Wondering, I broke the seals and
read:

  My dear cousin and, partner.

  Do not think me neglectful if I
have left you, like a dagger in a
sheath, until the time was ripe to
use you. For the ill you have known
TWICE IN TIME	81

at my hands, I now make full
amends. 1 have prospered in Flor-
ence and power shall be mine and
yours. Come and aid me as I shall
aid you.

Guaracco

  I looked up again, with an ex-
clamation. The figure had unmasked
and dropped the cloak. It was Lisa.
Her deep dark eyes looked into mine.

  “I have come to take you back to
Florence,” she said mechanically.

  I stared at her and my eyes must
have been like those of a frog. “What
is the matter, Lisa?” I asked.

  Because something was the
matter. She seemed to move and
talk in a dream.

  “I have come to take you back to
Florence,” she said again.

  Guaracco had done it—had put
his spell upon her and sent her here.
Nay, he had sent her all the way to
the perilous fortress to assure my
own obedience to his call. I gazed
at the letter, crumpled it in my hand.
It was baleful, foreshadowing tricks
and traps.

  “Will you come?” Lisa asked.

  She spoke in the measured tone
she might have used when purchas-
ing meat from a butcher. Her eyes
were upon me, drawing my gaze to
them, but they only half knew me.

  I could not refuse. Guaracco had
known as much when he had sent her
after me in this state. I felt fear
and rage and mystification but I
could not send her back alone.

  “Come,” I said and flung my red
mantle around me.

  We went ashore. Another fa-
miliar figure was on the dock—a
tiny figure. Guaracco's uglier dwarf.

  “Welcome.” He greeted me softly.
“Our horses are ready at yonder
hostler's.” He silenced my question
with a finger on his twisted lip.
“Guaracco will tell you all. Trust
him.”

  Trust Guaracco? I did not know
whether to laugh or curse.

  We rode swiftly away in the

brightening morning, Lisa and the
dwarf and I.

THE horses were good and I found
mine easy to manage, for all I had
not put foot in stirrup for six years.
Lisa must have worn men’s clothes
beneath her long cloak, for she rode
cross-saddle and she neither spoke
to me nor looked at me. The dwarf
led the way, hunched over his mount
like a trained monkey.

  We took the road that once I had
galloped with Lorenzo's officers.
This time we paused once, at an
inn where fresh horses awaited us.
We changed to them and took a cup
of wine and some bread and goat’s
cheese as we sat in our saddles.
Eventually, as sunset came, we rode
into the valley of the Arno and in
the dying daylight I saw Florence
yet again, a white city caught mid-
way on the silver cord of the river
with green fields all around.

  But as we came near a gun
sounded and the dwarf grumbled
that a watch would be set at the
gates. For my sake, he said, we
must not enter there. I might be
recognized for all the change in my
appearance.

   We turned therefore into the yard
of a waterside house above the city,
where our hideous little guard whis-
pered to certain acquaintances of
his. We left our horses and boarded
a small barge. It dropped downriver
with us, drifted stealthily within the
walls and under the bridges, came at
last to a wharf where we disem-
barked.

  Almost immediately at hand was a
house I knew, the house where
Guaracco had once offered me the
hand of Lisa, where we had experi-
mented and quarreled together,
where he must now be waiting for
me. We walked along the street that
led to the front door and there at
the door we paused. Still Lisa did
not speak.

  “Knock,” the dwarf bade me.

   As I did so, I divined the presence
82

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

within of a watcher. But there was
no response, no audible movement
even. It was only when Lisa,
prompted like me by our companion,
spoke her name aloud that we heard
a clang of bars and the door opened
a trifle to show a face.

  It was Guaracco’s other dwarf,
the handsome one who acted as
porter. The uglv little man came
close to my side. Both of them held
drawn swords and their eyes. turn-
ing up to me. were bright and hard.

  “Come in,” whispered the one who
acted as porter. “They wait for
you.”

  I started to speak to Lisa bu+ she
was walking around the side of the
house. I entered the front hall to
learn what lav in store for me.

  There stood a sizeable oblong
table, littered with papers, and men
sat in chairs along its sides, seven
of them. Guaracco alone I knew and
he stood up at the be^d of tbp board
his face toward pip. He did pot
changed in so r'lich as a red hair of
his beard or a gaunt line of his
figure. At sight of me he cried out
as if in joy and bustled around the
table to me. Before I could move he
caught me in his arms most affec-
tionately.

  “My cousin! Mil cousin!” he was
saying and bis grin was T,,;thin six
inches of my face. “Yon ’ nve come
as T begged to help me in my great
triumph!”

  His right arm, clasping me around
the body, had slid under my loosened
mantle. Now it pressed something
against the middle of mv back—
something round and iron-hard, the
muzzle of a gun. If I moved quickly
or denied him I would die on the
instant.

  With that pistol-bearing hand
urging me forward, as though he
still embraced me. he led me to the
head of the table and there kept me
beside him.

  “This is my kinsman Leo, gentle-
men.” He introduced me to thie com-
pany. “He is the man I told you of,

whose wonders you have heard me
speak of in times past. He has more
scientific miracles at his fingertips
than all the saints in the calendar.”
“I know him,” said a fragile
shift.v-eved man in black and crim-
son. “He was once pointed out to
me at the palace and it was said
that Lorenzo set great store by him.”
“Are you then satisfied?” Guarac-
co asked the company. “With him as
our helper thereafter, can we fail?”
“If he is true to us—” offered
another.

  “I vouch for that,” promised Gua-
raceo. his gun prodding me.

  Their silence ga're him consent
and Ne went on. “All is agreed then.
Bv +his t’TPP tomorrow night we
shall be in full possession of Flor-
ence, in a position to dictate to Tus-
canv as a whole. The oppressors
will have shod thoir last drop of
blood. the magistrates will sneak and
act only as wp see fit to bid them.”
His emb~a^e relaxed, his pistol
c^sed to di^ :nfo my bad-bone, but
I knew thaf it was still at the ready
in his hand.

  “The people ?” asked a thickset
man in a leather doublet. His eyes
burned from under black brows the
w’id+h of a thumb.

  “The people will offer no trouble
even if we cannot rouse them,” Gua-
racco returned. “Was it not you,
Captain Montesecco, who have had
charge of gathering: two thousand
hired soldiers outside the walls?”

  “I had charge and I have done so,”
replied the man addressed as Cap-
tain Montesecco. “It is well we strike
at once ere so many armed men
cause suspicion. Yet Florentines are
many and valiant—”

 “We can count on many sup-
porters in the city,” interrupted the
fragile man in black and crimson.
“We Pazzi have servants and de-
pendents to the amount of several
hundred. Our houses are close to-
gether in one quarter and a rising
of our household would mean the
rising of all that part of Florence.”

AS HE mentioned his family name
I was able to identify him as
Francesco de Pazzi. He was one of
the family of Florentine bankers
not as rich or powerful as the Medici
but as ambitious.

  “All of us stand ready,” he was
continuing, “with influence, men and
arms—all, that is, but my cousin
Guglielmo. You, fi*r Guaracco. ad-
vised against telling him of our
plan.”

  Guaracco’s rufous head nodded.
“He is married to Lorenzo*s sister.
Later, with his brother-in-law and
the rest out of the way. Gugl’-e’mo
will be glad to join us. But not now.
Your uncle, Giacopo, the head of the
Pazzi—what is his temper tonight?”
“Of course, I did not bring him
here,” said Francesco de Pazzi. “for
he has archaic ideas about fair play.
Howbeit he knows that there is to
be an arising against the Medici,
whom he has ever hated as upstarts
and thieves. He will lead the muster
of our men.”

  Another of the group about the
table gave a little nod of approval.
'Te was tall and high-shouldered, a
scraggy-necked fellow in a purple
houppelande, and he had a shallow
pinched jaw like a trowel.

  “What is my task?” he inquired
eagerly as thou<rh concerned lest
all the blood be spilt by other hands.

  “A task worthy of Francesco Sal-
viati of Pisa.” Guaracco flattered
him. “I rely upon your eloquence
and courage. Either may suffice—
both will be invincible.”

  “You intend,” said Pazzi, “to as-
sign him to the palace?”

  Guaracco nodded. “I shall put
some of my best blades in your
charge, Salviati,” he announced. “At
the appointed time go to the Palazzo
Publico, where the magistrates live
and sit in judgment. I will draw a
diagram.”

  Dipping pen in ink he began to
sketch on a white sheet for all to
see, “Once up the stairs,” he in-
structed, “you come into a hall.

There ask the guard to summon the
magistrate of the day. While he is
gone let your men pass through
this door which you will see upon
your left hand.

  “It leads to an antechamber large
enough for them all to wait. The
magistrate will arrive and you will
tell him that liberty is at hand for
Florence. If he will he can join us.
If not call forth your band to make
him see wisdom.”

  “And my assignment?” prompted
another, one of three who sat to-
gether at the right hand of Guarac-
co. He was a youngish hook-nosed
fellow in good clothes with a look
about Mm of fine breed'rig gone to
seed. “1 have a sure hand with a
dagger.”

  “I mind it well, Ser Bernardo,”
Guaracco said, and smiled. “You and
Ser Francesco de Pazzi will strike
down Giuliano and see that he does
not rise again. Have I your approval
Bernardo Bandini?” It was plain
that he had it and he turned his
smile toward Captain Montesecco.
“Our friend the captain promises to
deal Lorer > his death.”

  “An’ I miss stroke, may my sword
arm wither!” vowed the sturdy sol-
dier.

 “Meanwhile”—Guaracco’s eyes
slid toward me—“we have with us a
fighter the nonpareil of any. Leo, my
kinsman, known as Luca, the ad-
miral for freebooters who has lashed
the Moslems to their kennels for six
years. He is famed, admired and
knows more about warfare than any
man living. I will place him as our
general!”

      CHAPTER XIX
       The Conspiracy

QUITE well I knew now why
Guaracco had thought to drag
me into his scheme. He would serve
84

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

himself with my brains and skill as
so often before. It was one more
item that made his plot complete.
Even I, within minutes, saw how the
rebellion would succeed.

  The conspiracy was not for a
single blow but several, all accom-
plished at the same moment. Lo-
renzo and Giuliano, the heads of the
Medici, were to be assassinated. The
Palazzo Publico would be seized and
the officers there taken into custody
by armed men.

  The adherents of the plotters
would rise in an impressive manner,
swaying the unsuspecting and per-
haps dissatisfied citizenry by their
cries and promises. And to guard
against the forming of a violent
resistance two thousand merce-
naries were ready to march into the
city.

  It could not fail. With the fall of
Lorenzo’s power my exile and dan-
ger would be past. Yet my para-
mount impulse was to cry out against
so ruthless a measure.

  But if I spoke so my life would
be forfeit. I would not live to get
out of the room. I remained silent
while Captain Montesecco asked
when and where the Medici brothers
were to be struck down.

  “Tomorrow morning,” said Gua-
racco. “At church.”

  “Church?” repeated the captain.

  “Aye. Tomorrow is Sunday, you
will remember. We cannot be sure
of getting them together at any
other time. Cardinal Riario* is to
say mass at the cathedral, which
will insure their attendance. We
will be ready for them, each nearest
his man. At the moment when the
hose is elevated and all attention
directed thither—”

  “Nay!” The leather-clad figure
started from the chair. Montesecco’s
black brows lifted into horrified

  •	Cardinal Riario was a nephew of Sixtus IV,
then Pope of Rome. Some have tried to connect
him with the Pazzi conspiracy but the great mass
of evidence shows that he had no other connection
than that a cardinal’s presence at the cathedral
would insure the presence of the two brothers
Medici.

arches. “I cannot draw swords at
that holy moment. God would be
watching me!”

GUARACCO chuckled and so did
Francesco Salviati, the trowel-
jawed man in purple. But Monte-
secco was not to be laughed out of
his impulse.

  “I have sworn to help,” he ad-
mitted, “and I shall do so or my
name is not Giovanni Battista Mon-
tesecco. I will command the merce-
naries, raid the palace, help to rouse
the city—but I cannot and will not
do murder in the cathedral!”

  “The man of blood shows_ himself
blood-drawn,” sneered Pazzi.

  “Say you so?” gritted the captain.
“If you will take a sword in hand,
Messer Francesco, you will end up
more blood-drawn than I.”

  But Guaracco caught Montesecco’s
leather-clad shoulder in a big, placat-
ing hand. “None call you coward,
Ser Giovanni,” he assured the mer-
cenary. “Withdraw this part of it
if you will—none will blame you—
and we can use your talents else-
where. Bernardo Bandini, you are
still ready to deal with Giuliano?”
Guaracco’s wise glance shifted to
the two men who had not yet spoken.
Both were clad in black and their
faces were somber to match.

  “What do you say, Antonio Maf-
fei? Methinks you lived once in
Volterra, which Lorenzo saw fit to
sack and destroy?”

  My mind leaped back to Volterra.
Guaracco had managed its destruc-
tion primarily so as to get a crystal
of alum for our unsuccessful time
reflector, but he must have made
other plans in connection with that
apparently senseless cruelty. For
one, he had discredited me when I
might have been a stumbling block.

  He was able now also to use the
incident against Lorenzo. For An-
tonio Maffei was saying with growl-
ing relish that the scent of Lorenzo
de Medici’s blood would smell sweet
to the saints in heaven.
TWICE IN TIME

  “He is a devil,” he garnished the
conceit, “and merits urging to hell.”
“Your gossip, Stefano da Bagnone
there, will help you?” asked Guarac-
co. “You make a sign of assent,
Stefano, as I take it. And I may
provide a third for your dagger
party.” Again he glanced sidelong
at me. “We need not speak further
tonight, gentlemen. Let us meet early
on the morrow, and then to work.”

HE LET them out by a rear door.
Of the group he detained Fran-
cesco de Pazzi for a moment, advis-
ing him strongly to keep an eye on
Captain Montesecco, who had turned
strangely squeamish for a profes-
sional killer. Then, when all were
gone. Tie wheeled upon me with a
sultry grin of welcome.

  “Welcome- home, lad,” he cried.
“Fine things are to be our doing
within the twenty-four hours.”
“Murder, you mean?” I flung at
him. “Anarchy? Riot?” I walked
close to him. “Lisa, under your
power of will, brought me hither. I
demand that you free her and at
once. She and I will depart before
another hour is passed.”

  “I think not,” he said in his fa-
miliar easy manner of a master but
I snarled in scorn.

  “I am vastly different from the
man you lyingly accused to Lorenzo.
I am a killer! Bring on your dwarfs
and see if they frighten me. I came
here only to take Lisa away and by
the Saints I shall do so.”

  “Lisa?” he repeated. “Where is
she?”

  And I realized that I did not know.
“I was beforehand with you,” he
continued. “I hold her hostage for
your good will and support. Yet
all may be well.” He waved toward
a chair. “Sit down.”

  I did so and he talked. The Pazzi,
he said, powerful and extravagant,
were on the verge of bankruptcy.
They slavishly sought to work under
him for overthrow of the Medici,
forgetting that when the overthrow-

ing was complete Guaracco would
rule through them and could, in good
time, overthrow them also.

  “Florence is as good as mine to-
night,” he said. “After Florence
other states. All Italy.” He beck-
oned. “Come.”

 , He led the way down some rough
stairs to the cellar where we had
once wrorked together. It seemed
stacked with firewood until he kin-
dled a lantern. Then I saw the stacks
were of weapons.

  There w^ere rifles and bayonets,
boxes of grenades, machine guns,
canisters that must hold high ex-
plosives and many another baleful
thing. Toward Guaracco I turned
a wondering face and he laughed the
old superior laugh.

  “I quarried these .weapons or the
knowledge to make them from that
bemused mind of yours, Leo. I had
two years to delve into your trances,
six more to forge and fashion. What
ordinary army could stand against
me?”

  “You have soldiers?” I asked him.
“When first you came you saw the
worshipers I governed by tricks of
deviltry. Those and more like them
will rally at my call to use these
arms. After that—but, Leo, you
cannot demur longer. You and I
cannot succeed without each other.”
Again he plunged ahead with the
wild sketch of his plans. After the
subjugation of Italy, the subjuga-
tion of France and Spain—a united
and submissive Europe would toil
for Guaracco, its lord of lords.
Cristoforo Colombo would be sought
out, given his fleet and sent to
America to win its wealth.

  “Once you fancied such an em-
pire,” he reminded me. “Am I not
the true master sorcerer, with whom
all things come to pass?”

  “Not all things,” I demurred. “I
remember that I foretold the defeat
for such a master—death. It will
come to you.”

  His eyes turned frigid. “Seek not
to kill me unless you want to lose
88

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

Lisa. Join me and she is yours.
Otherwise I may give her to Bernar-
do Bandini for stabbing Giuliano.
Or I might use her to persuade that
overgodly mercenary, Montesecco.
You can have her only if you are my
devoted lieutenant.”

  “Lisa loves me,” I said stoutly.

  “Only af my bidding. My will
commands her.”

  I gazed at him as though I had
never seen him before. Not that I
had not known him from the first
day as a dangerous scoundrel. Not
that I had not always hated and
feared him. But at last I knew that
I must not delay. He must die for
the sake of Lisa and myself and
all the world.

  In one motion I bared my sword
and darted it at £iim. He reeled back
with a cry but no blood came. My
point had turned against a concealed
shirt of mail. He extended his arm,
dangling the lantern above an open
cask.

  “There is powder inside,” he
warned. “Attack and—”

T HESITATED only a second, then

  turned at the sound of pattering
feet. His two dwarfs were at me,
ducking under the sweep of my
sword to close in. But I brought
down the pommel of my weapon
upon the head of the hunchback even
as he shortened his own blade to
thrust. Down he fell and I sprang
across him and darted upstairs.

  “Lisa! Lisa!” I cried. Only the
roared curses of Guaracco answered
me. He was pursuing, a rifle in his
hands.

  “You cannot catch me!” I yelled
on inspiration. “I go back to my
prison!”

  I gained the front door and ran
out. Away I fled, past Verroc-
chio's bottega, around a corner to a
broader street and toward the heart
of Florence. For I had only pre-
tended that I was fleeing the city.

  What now? Seek Lorenzo and
warn him? Dared I show my face

to him? Ahead of me loomed the
Palazzo Publico, destined for a stir-
ring scene of tomorrow’s uprising.
I had a sudden hope and plan.

  Unbuckling my sword I hid it in a
bush. Boldly I went to a side door
and knocked. A porter opened to me.

  “I am the locksmith,” I said. “I
come to fix the antechamber door.”

  “I heard no orders,” he temporized
but allowed me to enter and mount
the stairs to the upper floor.

  Here were a reception hall and a
door opening to the left. Guaracco
had designated it as an ambush for
the bravos who would follow Fran-
cesco Salviati. I examined its heavy
lock and with my dagger made shift
to drag it partially from the door.
Still watched by the suspicious
porter, I tinkered with its inner
works.

  “Now it will serve,” I told him
and went my way.

  To all appearances I left the lock
as it had been. But I had bent a
spring and pried out a rivet. Any
man or men, going into that room
and closing the door behind, could
not get out again without the aid
of even a better locksmith than I.

  After that I sought a livery stable
and with the few coins that were
left in my pouch hired a horse.
Somehow I wheedled my way past
the watch at a gate and made the
best time darkness would allow to
the old familiar country house
which Guaracco still kept.

  A single caretaker opened to my
thunderous knocking. Without cere-
mony I drew my sword and swore
to cut out his liver if he forestalled
me by word or deed. He tremblingly
made submission and I locked him
in a closet. Then I took a lamp down
to the cellar workshop, where Gua-
racco had tested my scientific knowl-
edge on our first day of acquaint-
ance.

  It was in a dusty turmoil but in
a corner, among odds and ends of
machinery, was what I had hoped to
find—the remains of our unsuccess-
TWICE IN TIME

ful time reflector. I checked the bat-
tery, found it in bad shape, but
materials were at hand to freshen
it. When I had restored it to power
I procured salt from the kitchen
and mixed a great basin of brine.
Finally I attached two wires to the
terminals of the battery and thrust
their ends into the liquid.

  I watched carefully. Electrolysis
commenced. The bubbles that rose
at the negative wire would be liber-
ated hydrogen. Those at the positive
end were what I wanted. From a
bench I brought a glass bottle, hold-
ing more than half a gallon, filled it
with brine and inverted it above
the stream of bubbles.

  Steadily the gas crowded out the
salt water, showing greenish yellow.
I stoppered the bottle as it filled,
then charged a second and a third.
Finally I drew the wires out. The
bottles had earlike rings at their
necks, and I strung them on a girdle
under my cloak.

  They were now a weapon for me
that Guaracco had not dreamed of—
for I had produced chlorine gas, such
as had poisoned armies in the first
World War, the war that was still
centuries ahead of me.

  As I finished the work Sunday
dawned grayly. I released the fright-
ened caretaker and rode once more
to Florence.

CHAPTER XX
Turmoil

Undoubtedly, as i have said,

  - II Duomo—Saint Mary's of the
Flower—was the second cathedral
in all Christendom. I was there, gas-
bottles and all, the next morning be-
fore Cardinal Riario began to say
mass.

  I tried to lose myself among the
throngs of worshipers who strolled
most informally among the banks of

seats in the octagonal choir space
beneath the great open dome.

  For once I was glad of the natural
darkness that clung in the cathedral,
lighted only by the ornate upper
windows.

  At the high altar the cardinal,
young and handsome for all his high
dignity, was intoning the service.
I found a shadow beside a carved
wooden screen and tried to shrink
my he'ght by bowing my shoulders
und'M* my mantle.

  More worshipers appeared and
more, brave in all the colors and
fabrics of Sabbath costume. A tall
ruddy head and beard showed among
them—Guaracco, I saw at once. In
my heart I prayed that he would
fail to see me and he did. He was
looking for other things and perhaps
he believed that I had indeed fled
Florence.

  Then on the other side of the choir
a flash of blue velvet, a smiling hand-
some face. It was Giuliano de Me-
dici* and his arm was linked with
that of Francesco de Pazzi as
though with a close friend. On the
other side of Giuliano and a little
to the rear walked Bernardo Ban-
dini, the dissolute young gentleman
on whom Guaracco threatened to be-
stow Lisa.

  And then someone strolled past
me—Lorenzo—-a gorgeous figure in
a crimson houppelande, sword at
side, chatting with a crooked, smil-
ing young man—Agnolo Poliziano,
the poet. Behind them, tense and
pale, slunk two dark-clad figures,
the assassins Maffei and Bagnone.

  I took a step toward the ruler of
Florence. I drew in my breath to
shout a warning in the midst of the
holy service. I saw Guaracco ap-
proaching beyond some chairs.

  It was then that the host was ele-
vated at the altar. The young car-
dinal’s voice rang out the prayerful
words that, all unknowing, would

88

signal for violence:

  “Ite, missa est!”

  Maffei, the vengeful Volterran,
who was closer to me than Bagnone,
stepped suddenly forward, clutching
at Lorenzo. His dagger twinkled in

air.

  I seemed to move of an involun-
tary stimulus. Had I been a true
Florentine, I would have paused to
draw sword and would have been
too late to save Lorenzo. Being an
American and from the Twentieth
Century, I struck with my fist.
Maffei staggered under the blow, his
thrust went awry. It glanced along
Lorenzo’s neck.

  “Beware, Your Magnificence!” I
cried and struck Maffei again, a
roundhouse blow.

  He turned halfway toward me
catching my knuckles on the point
of his chin. Down he floundered in
a flurry of black robes and I set my
foot on his dagger hand. The weap-
on clanked on the floor, and I kicked
it away.

  All had become howiing confusion.
My gas, I saw, would not affect only
Guaracco’s party, but the whole con-
gregation. I dared not release it.
At last I thought to draw my sword.

  Across the octagonal space chairs
were overturning and horrified peo-
ple were scurrying and gesticulating.
For a moment I saw Giuliano’s blue
velvet form struggling on the floor
while Francesco de Pazzi, with his
knee on Giuliano’s breast, struck
viciously with his dagger. Other
swords were out on all sides.

  “Down with the Medici oppres-
sors!” I heard Guaracco trumpet-
ing.

A CHEER answered him for the
service had been liberally at-
tended by members of the conspira-
cy. The cardinal, his young eyes
wide with horror, was drawing back
from the altar and a priest in black
robes was trying to lead him away.
Maffei had risen and was running
before my sword-point. I turned to

see what was happening to Lorenzo.

  He had drawn his own sword and
was parrying the wild dagger
thrusts of Bagnone but his wound
streamed blood and the terrified
Poliziano hampered him by clinging

to him.	*

  I hurried to them and thrust hard
at Bagnone but my stroke was
turned, for as Guaracco had done the
night before this conspirator wore
mail under his gown. Yet the dig-
ging jab drove him back. I gestured
Poliziano toward a doorway with my
weapon.

“Is that the sacristy?” I shouted.
“Get him in there and bolt the door!”

  “Giuliano!” Lorenzo was shouting
back. “Is Giuliano safe?”

  But I gave him an unceremonious
shove and a moment later Poliziano
had dragged him to the threshold.

  “Down with the Medici!” yelled
Guaracco again.

  His voice was near and I faced
upon him and half a dozen of his
supporters, who were rushing to cut
Lorenzo off. I threw myself in their
way, quickly wadding my cloak into
a shield, and engaged several blades
at once. I heard the clang of the
door behind me and the shooting of
the bolts.

  “Medici! Medici!” I roared, fend-
ing off my assailants. “Murder!
Help, honest men, murder is being
done!”

“Medici!” someone echoed and
never have I heard a sweeter voice.

  A robust cavalier in plum-purple
hurried to my side. He too had a
sword and struck manfully at the
conspirators. His example fired
others. In a trice the entire floor of
the choir was a melee of jabbering
voices and clashing steel.

  Several armored guardsmen made
their appearance. I saw Guaracco
fleeing. I followed suit, for I re-
membered that Lorenzo, whose life
I had just saved, had doomed me.

  The public square outside the
cathedral was swiftly jamming with
people, some armed and angry,
TWICE IN TIME

89

others frightened and mystified. All
were talking at once, and nearly all
were shouting “Medici! Medici!” In
this quarter at least the people were
for their ruler.

  A fellow in a jerkin of faiding,
with gray hair and a cast in his eye,
stopped me with a fierce clutch even
as I emerged from the cathedral.

  “Is it true that Ser Giuliano de
Medici is slain?” he asked.

  “I fear so,” I replied. “I saw him
struck down.”

  The gray head shook dolefully but
the one good eye lighted up. “Come
to the Palazzo Publico, young sir,”
the man urged me. “There is good
sport there.”

  “What sport?” I asked, panting
from the excitement.

  “Salviati and some cutthroats
went up to seize the magistrates.
But the bulk of them Were trapped
in a room. The door had a spring
lock.”

  Joy surged into me. My device had
worked. “How then?” I cried.

  “Some guards and friends of the
Medici came and seized the lot,” he
replied with relish. “Even now' they
are being hanged from the windows
like hams on a rafter.”

FIERCE as it sounded the news
came gladly to my ears. Guarac-
co’s conspiracy had failed in part at
the cathedral, had failed utterly at
the palace. But I had no time for
rejoicing. Elsewhere in the city
fresh danger was rising.

  “Nay, come with me,” I bade my
new friend. “I know of better sport
still.” I raised my voice. “Hark, all
true Florentines and servants of the
Magnificent! Who will fight for
the Medici?”

  “//” stoutly called a youth, bran-
dishing a cudgel. “And I!” came
another volunteer. “I! I! I” chorused
others. Half a score offered them-
selves in as many seconds.

  “Then follow,” I said and set off
at a trot for the Pazzi quarter. I
now held a bottle of chlorine gas in

each hand. The fellows set up a
shout of enthusiasm or excitement
and ran at my heels.

  We had not far to run. Out of a
narrow side street rode a man on
horseback—a square-faced man,
bright of eye and straight of back
for all the whiteness of his hair. He
wore gold-filigreed armor on chest
and legs, and waved a sword. Armed
footmen came at his heels. “Liberty!
Liberty!” he was shouting. “Over-
throw the oppressors !’*

  He had to bp Giacopo de Pazzi, the
aged but sturdy head of the rebel-
lious family. Behind him were mar-
shaled the retainers of his house, a
good hundred—and dangerous look-
ing. And masses of citizenry pressed
from other streets to stare, perhaps
to join.

  There was nothin*? for it but au-
dacity. “Medici!” I thundered in re-
turn to the Pazzi slogan and flour-
ished one of the gas-bottles as though
it were a battle flag. “Forward, loyal
Florentines! Smite the assassins!”

  My own following set up a shout
and pressed forward with me. I had
more adherents than I had thought
at first. Doubtless we had been re-
enforced by others as we passed
along the street. But Giacopo de
Pazzi was not the man to be daunted.
He had come out looking for trouble
and seemed glad to find it. Yelling
a war-cry, he came toward us at a
trot.

  His horse alone would scatter my
band for we were all afoot. I made
a decision and hurled my first gas
bottle. It burst on the pavement
several yards ahead of the old man
and he checked and stared. I ran
ahead and threw the second.

  It smashed even closer to him.
The cloud of gas, rising and mixing
with the air, must have been -driven
sharply into his eyes and nose as
well as into the nostrils of his horse.
The poor beast snorted and reared.
Giacopo de Pazzi kept his seat with
difficulty. Coughing, he dropped his
sword and clutched at his throat
90

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

with his hand. A moment later his
frightened steed, out of control, had
sidled into the foremost of his own
men, throwing them into disorder.

  The onlookers knew less of what
had happened than Giacopo de Pazzi
but he had lost command of the
situation and the balance of approval
tilted from him. Hoots and jeers
rang in the air.

  “Medici!” I screamed again.

  “Medici! Medici!” echoed back
from all sides.

  I hurried almost into the midst of
the Pazzi party. From my belt I
tore my third and last bottle bomb
and threw it. It broke only a few
feet from me and the fumes blinded
and strangled me as well as others.
I retreated as best I might, cough-
ing and dabbing at my tear-filled
eyes. But though I could not see
that final dose of irritating gas must
have completed the job of halting
the rush to dominate the city.

  I heard an increasing hubbub of
loud shouts for the Medici, and
when my vision cleared at last I saw
a flash of armor. Guardsmen were
making their appearance, threaten-
ing the parade with swords and
pikes. I saw the foremost armed
servants of the Pazzi faltering and
drawing back, crumpling the head
of the column. Some darted to right
and left, losing themselves in the
crowd.

  Giacopo de Pazzi had recovered
somewhat from his taste of chlorine.
He was no coward but hfe knew when
he was beaten. He spurred quickly
around a corner and away before
we could reach him and drag him
from the saddle.

  I thought that he might reach the
gates and escape and did not be-
grudge him that boon. To me he
seemed the least grisly of all that
group of rascally plotters.*

  *	Giacopo de Pazzi was a simple and decent
man, who might not have approved of the entire
conspiracy. He was later captured, and his
mutilated body tossed into the Arno. Another
conspirator, Bandini, was a fugitive for months,
but was Anally haled back to Florence and hanged
from the Palazzo Publico.

  An officer of the guard passed
close to me, and I hailed him. “How
goes it at the palace?” I asked.

  “The rebels are all taken or slain,”
he answered. “His Magnificence is
safe and has spoken from a balcony,
begging that there be no more
butchery and asking that the sur-
vivors be delivered to fair trial. He
urges peace even while his tears
stream for his dead brother.”

  “It is not over yet,” I admonished
him. “Keep watch on the gates.
Some mercenaries have been
gathered there to help the con-
spiracy.”

  “They will never enter this city,”
he assured me.

  I turned from him toward the
Arno.

  There was one more thing to do
and its doing lay with me to do it.

      CHAPTER XXI
      The Christening

CLOSE to the riverside Guaracco’s
house never looked so quiet and
yet so forbidding. I ran to the door
and tried it. From within a voice
challenged me quietly, cautiously.

  “I am from Guaracco!” I called at
once. “All is lost in the city.”

  There was a rattling of chains
as if the barrier were being lowered
and I did not wait for the door to
open. With my shoulder I bore
strongly against it and it creaked
back.

  A cry of profane execration
greeted me. One of the dwarfs, the
ugly one I had stunned the night
before, swung up his curved sword.
But my own point was quickly in
this one’s throat and he crumpled
on the threshold, his oaths dying
into a blood-choked gurgle. I hur-
ried inside without waiting for him
to cease struggling.

  “Lisa!” I shouted as I ran through
TWICE IN TIME

91

room after room. “Lisa, where are
you?”

  “Leo!”

  It was muffled, little louder than a-
whisper, but I. having come into the
kitchen, traced the direction of her
voice. She was beneath me. In the
floor show'ed a threat cleated hatch-
way. She must be in the cellar amid
Guaracco’s stacked weapons. Seiz-
ing the iron ring that served as
handle for the door I heaved it up.
Light gleamed from below'.

  There was no ladder or other wav
down but I swung myself irM the
hole, landing unright on the earthen
cellar floor. She was there, seated
like a stone figure upon a great chest
that must have been full of ammuni-
tion. Beyond were the stairs that
led to the front of the house. Her
eyes sought mme in the lantern
light.

“Leo,” she murmured, as softW as
a sigh of wind. “You’ve come back.”
“Fly away from here!” I gasped
at her. “These devil’s machines and
weapons shall be destroyed within
the minute. And we are leaving
Florence forever—before Guaracco
finds us. Or Lorenzo does either.”
“But I must stay,” she protested,
as though she reminded me of the
obvious. “I was told to wfait.”
“Told by Guaracco!” I cried hotly,
for it now was manifest to me that
he had bound her to her r»laco by
hypnotism, stronger than shackles.

  “Guaracco, yes.” Her dark head
dipped a little in agreement. “He
said that all would be well. A new
Florence would be built with no op-
pression.”

  “Lies, lies!” I cried passionately.
“He tried to form himself a devil’s
kingdom here, erected on spilt blood
and corpses.” I caught her hand.
“Come, Lisa!”

  I got her to her feet but it wras
like lifting a straw dummy.

  “I was told to wait, Leo,” she said.
My hands seized her shoulders
and I tried to shake her into con-
sciousness.

  “Lisa, do you love me? Or is
that only an illusion too, turned on
and off by Guaracco like the spigot
of a wine cask?”

  “Love you, yes.” She was definite
enough.

  “Then come, I say.” I backed
toward the stairs, drawing her along
with me. She looked ahead and saw
something. Her eves widened, her
mouth opened to cry out.

  “T ,eo—danger!”

  She tore from my grasp and scur-
ried around me so that she was be-
tween pn(j the stairs I turned on
my heel only swiftly enough to see
what she had seen.

  Gurracco had descended upon me
and his hand was lifted, holding
something that gleamed. I heard
the bark of an explosion, saw a sud-
den ghostly puff of smoke. And
Lisa sagged against me, into my
arms. Her eyes were suddenly
bright and wakeful again, and her
mouth tremblingly smiled. I eased
her slackening body to the floor. I
knew that she was dead.

  “Do not move, Leo!” warned Gua-
racco hastily. Still at the foot of
the stairs, he leveled his weapon at
me pointblank. “This fires six shots!
It is one of the guns I made accord-
ing to the science I gleaned from
you.”

  It was indeed a revolver. His
thumb had drawn up the hammer
and the muzzle stared me between
the eyes. I gathered for a spring but
paused. I did not fear to die but I
feared that Guaracco might live.

  “You have failed,” were the first
words I spoke to him.

  “Failed?”

. His eyes flickered down toward
Lisa. With his rebellion crumpled
around his head he could still smile
in triumph.

  “Failed,” I said again. “Lisa was
under your spell but she broke it to
save my life. She loved me. Her
love was more than your dirty con-
juring tricks.”

  “True, true,” he admitted smooth-
92

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

ly. “And I am glad after all that
she did save your life. Leo, there
is still time and opportunity for us
to help each other.”

  I curled my lip in contempt but
he went on: “Many have died today.
Why should we? If you do not un-
derstand, Leo, look at what else I
bring.”

  His free left hand extended to-
ward me and between thumb and
finger flashed a globule of rosy-silver
light. “It is a pearl,” he intoned in
a new voice. “The pearl of sleep,
Leo. Look upon it!”

T LOOKED. I felt my senses sway
but held them firm. It was only
a pearl. The light did not wax or
blur or brighten. I was resisting
his spell. It was only a pearl that
Guaracco held, trying to spellbind
me with it. But I stared and would
not let it have power over me.

  “You are going to sleep, Leo,”
Guaracco was intoning. “To sleep—
and all is well between us.”

  I gazed, my mind at work. A way
opened to revenge and victory if I
were cunning. Slowly, stiffly, simu-
lating trance, I took a step toward
him. He thought himself the win-
ner.

  “Leo, Leo—I am your friend,” he
dinned into me. “I am Guaracco,
who adopted you as his cousin, who
made you great and wealthy. And
you will be grateful and help Gua-
racco. You will tell Lorenzo de
Medici that Guaracco too fought to
put down this conspiracy. Those
who can testify otherwise are dead.”
It would have worked had he been
able truly to impose his will. I let
him deceive himself, and took an-
other step. We were almost within
arm’s reach of each other. The
leveled revolver was bigger than and
brighter than the pearl to my gaze.
I kept my face gravenly rapt, my
eyes staring, but I was awake and
resolute. Would he suspect?

  “Once we are believed we can still
work together, Leo,” Guaracco was

insisting. “Plan again, and better.
We may yet rule the world!”

  I threw myself upon him.

  He pulled the trigger but my
right hand was upon the revolver.
Pain bit my thumb, that I had
thrust between breech and hammer,
and the firing pin drove deep into
the base of the nail. A moment more
and I wrenched it away and flung it
behind me. It exploded with the
shock, and the bullet sang into the
beam overhead. A moment later we
had both drawn swords.

  “You triple traitor!” growled
Guaracco, parrying my first lunge.
“Come then if you will have death
this way!”

  I made no reply but deflected his
riposte—the trick he had learned
from me. His chest was exposed to
a return riposte but I knew the mail
that defended it and swept my blade
in a quick arc. He got his brow out
of the way with millimeters to
spare.

  Falling back he tried to clutch at
another pistol, one of a heap in an
open box, but I nicked at his out-
flung hand and got home. He whim-
pered. Two of his fingers soared
away and blood fountained forth.

  “Wait, Leo!” He changed his tune
at once. “I must not die if you ex-
pect to live and —”

  I did not expect to live and made
him no answer. His sword was up
and I beat it momentarily aside and
slashed at his face. Quickly he par-
ried but only half broke the force of
the blow. His cheek was laid open
and his beard suddenly gleamed a
deeper red.

  “The time reflector,” he yam-
mered at me, on sudden inspiration.
“Only I can show you how to rebuild,
improve, get back to your own age!”
He should have saved his breath,
for he was panting and choking.
His thrusts were unsteady, easy to
foil. My digging lunge at his belly,
while it did not pierce the chain
mail, drove most of the wind out of
him. It drove out the fight, too. He
TWICE IN TIME	93

tried to retreat to the stairs but
misjudged and brought up against
the plank-faced wall. He threw
down his sword and lifted his hands.

  “Mercy!” he begged. “I sur-
render! Leo!”

  His unwounded right palm spread
itself against a stout timber. I dart**!
my point at it, all my weight behind.
A tremulous, unmanned howl from
'Guaracco—his hand was spiked to
the wood by my blade like a big pale
spider on a bodkin.

  Then I let go my hilt and stepped
back. I spared no eye to my enemy’s
plight nor ear to his prayers.

  Lisa lay still and misty pale but
there was no blood on her calm face.
I closed her eyes, straightened her
body and folded her hands upon her
quiet breast. In her last instant of
life her mouth had fallen into the
littie close-lipped smile I had known.
Kneeling almost to earth I kissed
her once and her face was still warm.

  “Leo, Leo!” sobbed Guaracco in
shameless entreaty. “What will you
do?”

  He was trying to seize my sword
and wrench it away but the point
was tightly wedged into the wood
and his free left hand, shorn half in
two by my previous stroke, could
not grip the hilt.

  I let my actions answer him. From
its peg I snatched the lantern. With
my foot I stirred some straw and
rubbish into a mass against the foot
of a barrel. He saw what I intended.

  “There is gunpowder in that
barrel!” he shrieked.

  I knew it but still I spoke him no
word. With all my strength I dashed
the lantern down. The glass shat-
tered, the straw blazed up. And
then I raced away up the steps.
Behind me fire gushed luridly.

AT THE door of the house I almost
trampled upon Guaracco’s re-
maining dwarf, the handsome one.
He stared at me in mute horror,
then at the glow behind me. He
seemed to read in my face what had

happened, for he scuttled past and
dived into that flaming cellar.

  “Master! Master!” he screamed.
I gained the street, ran along it
for more than a score of paces be-
fore the whole world seemed to turn
into thunder and lightning. _I was
flung to my face, skinning my cheek
on the pavement, but I i*ose and ran
on. That was the end of Guaracco’s
house—his weapons—his dwarf—
himself—Lisa. Nothing remained
for me to do save to go and give
myself up to Lorenzo. . . .

  In the evening I stood in the
groined, frescoed chamber where
first the ruler of Florence had given
me audience. Lorenzo de Medici
was seated opposite in his chair of
state, across the ebony and ivory
table. His collar hung loose over
his neck bandage but otherwise he
was the same Lorenzo as ever—
alert, self-contained, far-thinking.

  “I am driven to believe all points
of your strange story,” he said
gently. “And no one can deny that
you have saved Florence and me.
Poliziano says so and so do the offi-
cers of the guard. I gi'ant you full
pardon and I ask you to pardon me.
It seems that I drove you away once
by my mis judgment. It shall not
happen again.”

  I bowed thanks but I could think
only of Lisa. He read that tragic
thought.

  “Sorrow touches you, my friend,
as it has touched me. My brother
died today as did your sweetheart.
But perhaps work will comfort us
both and Florence hath need of my
rule and your science.”

  “You are right, Magnificence.”
“Yours will be a great labora-
tory,” he promised. “Aye, and a
studio of your own in the gardens of
San Marco. Above all, honor and
safety. But one chief change must
be made in you.”

  “And that?”

  “This matter of your strange
journey from another age, which
though I believe I do not begin to
94

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

understand. It must remain a sec-
ret. Since the death of Guaracco
and your lady Lisa, you and I alone
know it. Others might think you a
devil’s apostle, and urge that you be
borne to the stake.”

  He paused, pursed his lips, as if
completing some decision. “There-
fore it is expedient that we provide
you with an ordinary birth and fam-
ily among us—a father and all the
rest.”

  “A father?” I echoed him, not
comprehending.

  “Aye, that. I know the very man
—an attorney who is in my confi-
dence and who has several children
already. If I ask it he will gladly
own you as yet another son. The
records can be arranged in various
offices to make it believable. Forget
that barbarous unpronounceable sur-
name of yours. The name of the
attorney, your new father, is Piero
da Vinci.”

  “Da Vinci!”

  I sank back into my chair, impli-

cations rushing upon me with be-
wildering shock and speed.

  “Leave all arrangements to me,”
said Lorenzo. “It is my peculiar
talent to make perfect all such little
things.” His bitterly ugly face grew
suddenly beautiful with that warm
smile of his. “From this day for-
ward you are Leo—no, Leonardo da
Vinci.”

  And I knew the rich life given me
to lead, as crown of the age and in-
spiration for ages to come. My
science gropings will show the way
to doctors, to master engineers. My
paintings will dazzle nations. Michel-
angelo will hate me too much and
Raphael admire me too much but
both will be the better for my ex-
amples.

  One greatest picture I shall cre-
ate, with La Gioconda as model to
be sure but preserving the smile and
spirit of Lisa, Mona Lisa. And I
shall die old and great with kings
weeping for me.

  I am Leonardo da Vinci.

Do We Have to Die?

  Thirty-nine years ago in forbidden Tibet, be-
hind the highest mountains in the world, a
young Englishman named Edwin J. Dingle
found the answer to this question. A great mys-
tic opened his eyes. A great change came over
him. He realized the strange power that knowl-
edge gives.

  That Power, he says, can transform the life
of anyone. Questions, whatever they are, can be
answered. The problems of health, death, pov-
erty and wrong can be solved.

  In his own case, he was brought back to
splendid health. He acquired wealth, too, as well
as world-wide professional recognition. Thirty-
nine years ago he was sick as a man could be
and live. Once his coffin was bought. Years of
almost continuous tropical fevers, broken bones,
near blindness, privation and danger had made
a human wreck of him, physically and mentally.

  He was about to be sent back to England to
die, when a strange message came — “They are
waiting for you in Tibet.” He wants to tell the
whole world what he learned there., under the

guidance of the greatest mystic he ever encoun-
tered during his 21 years in the Far East. He
wants everyone to experience the greater health
and the Power, which there came to him.

  Within ten years, he was able to retire to this
country with a fortune. He had been honored
by fellowships in the world’s leading geographi-
cal societies, for his work as a geographer. And
today, 39 years later, he is still so athletic, capa-
ble of so much work, so young in appearance, it
is hard to believe he has lived so long.

  As a first step in their progress toward the
Power that Knowledge gives, Mr. Dingle wants
to send to readers of this paper a 9,000-word
treatise. He says the time is here for it to be
released to the Western World, and offers to
send it, free of cost or obligation, to sincere
readers of this notice. For your free copy, ad-
dress The Institute of Mentalphysics, 213 South

THE LOST HOUR

Bv Alexander Samalmaii

ONE day in March, 1980,
Earth’s scientists discovered
that the world had lost one
hour of time.

  Beneath the globe's surface a mol-
ten mass of matter, which for a cen-
tury had bubbled and boiled as if
stirred by the fires of hell, subsided
in its mad upward surge.

  Concurrently fissures on the crust
of the Earth closed. There was a
change in the eternal rhythm of
Earth’s contraction and expansion

95

and a consequent lowering of its
surface.

  Local disturbances were reported
—however, as the severest shocks
were felt at the North and South
Poles and under the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans, no general cataclysm
took place.

  The occurrence was the subject of
a lengthy statement by Professor
Aldous Grant, world-renowned
physicist.

  Professor Grant was quoted as
96

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

follows in the Daily Record for
March 10, 1980:

    These phenomena which we are wit-
  nessing are not unfamiliar to scien-
  tists, although they have never been as
  marked as at present. Because of in-
  ternal disturbances our sphere’s rate
  of rotation or the length of the ter-
  restrial day is undergoing a change.

    As early as 1880 astronomers no-
  ticed certain irregularities in the mo-
  tion of the Moon. These were inex-
  plicable and in a strict sense are in-
  explicable to the present day.

    Irregularities in the motion of the
  Sun were also observed. Checking
  these against the irregularities of the
  Moon it was discovered that they
  coincided. This left no alternative
  other than the assumption that the
  true change is in the speed of the
  Earth and not in the speed of either
  Sun or Moon. At various times in
  the past, notably in 1790, in 1897, in
  1917 and in 1950, the Earth’s speed
  was subjected to sudden changes.

    These changes have been attributed
  to contraction and expansion of the
  Earth’s crust due to altered tempera-
  tures within the molten layers. In
  the nineteenth century the effect of
  these erratic pulsations was the
  lengthening of the year by one second.

  In 1950 it was observed that an op-
  posite effect was obtained—the ap-
  parent length of the year becoming
  shorter by almost a full minute.

    The present disturbances, however,
  bid fair to break all records. We have
  been losing time at an unbelievably
  swift rate. Nothing has as yet been
  done to adjust ourselves to this ac-
  celeration. Nevertheless it is doubt-
  ful whether—

IN A dark prison cell, a man
was preparing- to die. Praying
fervently he sought to make peace
with his God.

 Ralph Frazier knew he was in-
nocent but the circumstantial evi-
dence was all against him. And so
he had to die.

 The sentence was definite, left no
room for doubt. He was in a strange
land and thus far nobody had come
to his defense.

 The words echoed in his tortured
mind—“To be hung by the neck un-
til dead on the morning of March
eleventh, nineteen hundred eighty,
at or before five o’clock—”

  It was shortly before the fatal
hour when they called for Ralph
Frazier and marched him into t'
prison yard. He looked up at the s
for what he thought would be t
last time—and suddenly he gasped.
The Sun was high in the heavens.

  “Look, padre,” he said to the dig-
nified figure at his side. “It is past
dawn.”

  The guards gaped their astonish-
ment. In the prison yard stood an
ancient sundial. Ralph Frazier
pointed to it. “It is six o’clock ac-
cording to that sundial over there.”
It was true. Although every clock
in the vicinity proclaimed the hour
of five the evidence of the sundial
could not be denied.

  “Our clocks must be out of gear,”
said the warden. “But it makes no
difference. Let us go ahead.”

  “Ah, no,” spoke the padre. “The
young man must not be executed for
God has wrought a miracle on his
behalf. You must grant him the
privilege of a re-trial, according
to the laws of this community.”
Benevolently, the padre patted
Ralph Frazier’s head. ”My son,” he
said, “thank the Lord for this pre-
cious chance that has come to you to
prove your innocence.”

  Ralph Frazier was conducted back
to his cell, where he flung himself
upon the stone floor and wept in
prayer and gratitude.

T\ R. JAMES HOSKINS was
roused from his sleep by the in-
sistent ringing of the telephone. He
looked out of the window and saw
that it was dawn. The voice over
the wire was anxious and grief-
stricken.

  “We waited until day came,” the
mother spoke nervously, “but the
baby’s condition hasn’t improved.
He is very feverish now. Oh, Doc-
tor, we don’t know what to do and if
you can hurry—”

  It meant a long trip across ex-
tremely bad roads in the heart of the
woods. Dr. Hoskins sighed as he
THE LOST HOUR	97

dressed. Life wasn’t easy.

  When he arrived at the baby’s bed-
side he took one look at the flushed
face of the tossing infant, rolled up
his sleeves and set to work.

  “He’ll pull through, all right,” he
said comfortingly. “But if you’d
waited another ten minutes before
calling me it would have been too
late.”

THE dictator of a large empire was
giving his final instructions to his
espionage chief. “You hold the fate
of Esthinia in your hands,” he said
gravely. “My people there are ready
to overthrow the government—but
they need your guidance. Your pres-
ence would electrify them, spur them
into action.”

  “But I can’t reach Esthinia,” said
the spy. “Not if, as you say, the mis-
sion is so secret that I can’t use a
plane. The route is heavily guarded
and there’s a price on my head in
the intervening territory.”

  “Under cover of night you can
work your way through,” the dicta-
tor advised. “I order you to go now
—and you will be there in time. You
must not use a conveyance of any
kind, for your preparations would
be observed and there's no one I can
trust. This is of the utmost impor-
tance.”

 As he made his way through
forest and field in the darkness the
spy realized the vast significance of
his mission. Once he presented him-
self in Esthinia the spark would be
put to the powder keg. Revolution
would flame! There would be war
and conquest, glory and widespread
disaster! But—the Esthinians would
not act without him.

  The dictator wanted revolt—it
would establish him as the ruler,
the man of destiny over a much
larger emoire than that he now con-
trolled. If, however, the spy were
stopped before reaching his destina-
tion the threatened uprising would
peter out.

  Nearer and nearer he came to the

border. The darkness and his own
cleverness in avoiding detection were
serving him well.

  Suddenly he looked up and was
startled out of his wits. Had the
night passed so quickly? The fingers
of dawn were painting the sky.

  Now the spy became frantic, has-
tened toward his goal. It was a mad
fipht against time. Scratched and
bnrsed he tried to run through
bramble and bush, vainly pounded
against obstructing trees.

  It was no use. Lighter and lighter
it grew and he could no longer hide
himself while traveling. If only
he had another hour’s time! He
crouched under the outspread
branches of a protective tree and it
was then a sentry saw and recog-
nized him.

  As he was led away to a place of
detention the spy trembled at the
thought of the dictator’s mighty
wrath.

  Today was the day to strike—and
he had failed and another dream of
world domination was shattered.

  The report of the learned Pro-
fessor Grant went on.

  It is doubtful whether the current ac-
celeration of the Earth will have any
noticeable influence on the Earth’s popula-
tion. Perhaps the majority of individ-
uals will be completely unaware of what
has happened. Only the most astute will
understand the cosmic occurrence—and
even they will be at a loss to explain the
amazingly swift terrific contraction and
consequent acceleration of the Earth.

  I predict that though we shall have
lost an entire hour by tomorrow, March
eleventh, life will go on in much the same
way and people will devote their energies
to quite the usual pursuits. Granted, of
course, that present calculations are not
upset by unforeseen eruptions.

  Though of immense significance from a
scientific viewpoint this phenomenon will
pass almost utterly unmarked by and be
of no importance whatever to the hurry-
ing and scurrying beings who make up the
ma.ior population of this globe.

  They will soon become accustomed to
the changed time cycle and after official
action is taken will accept it with the
same nonchalance with which they accept
Daylight Saving schedules.

-CHAPTER I

The Great Change

STUPENDOUS things have hap-
pened in this world, but noth-
ing as stupendous as the Great
Change that came over Earth in
1938. At first it was just a subtle
change, hardly noticeable. Conti-
nents did not sink nor did tidal
waves engulf cities. Nothing visible
or tangible occurred at all. Never-
theless it was different.

  Manifestations were numerous,
yet hard to define. First of all a
greedy little nation, dreaming the
dreams that Caesar and Napoleon
had also once dreamed, suddenly
and inexplicably withdrew her
powerful navy from the Hawaiian
Islands, thus taking away the threat

of war between herself and another
great power.

  At the same time she demobilized
from the Siberian front, when it was
expected that within a month she
would have swept into the wheat
fields of the north, robbing them
from a frantic European nation.
Not long after these two enemies
signed an everlasting peace treaty.

  That was the first major indica-
tion of the Great Change. It was
not long after that the big powers
of Europe, so delicately balanced on
the verge of a disastrous war, de-
mobilized from opposing frontiers
almost all at once. And in another
few months a dozen short and honest

Professor Thode thought he had stumbled
upon something new in his psycho-phone—
only to discover that it teas old stuff to
the aliens who actually controlled Earth!
100	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

treaties made war remote and un-
thinkable. Before a decade had
passed all Europe united to form a
commonwealth for the betterment of
all concerned—a union not in name
only but in fact.

  These astounding results in the
international field were matched by
equally amazing changes in the gen-
eral everyday life of mankind. Peo-
ple began to grow kinder toward one
another. A feeling of brotherhood
sprang up and waxed stronger day
by day.

  It is safe to say that a person
taken from the twentieth century
prior to July, 1938, and transported
suddenly to July of 1939, would have
sworn he was on some other world
than that he had known because of
the difference in human relationship
occasioned by the Change.

  For instance, up in the hills of
Kentucky two lanky bearded drawl-
ing backwoodsmen, armed with
rifles, faced one another shyly and
finally shook hands. That was in
September of 1938. A few months
before those two would have shot
it out between them for their feud
went back a hundred years. And so
on and on.

  It was as though the human race
had labored for countless centuries
under an incubus of evil which had
suddenly, in July of 1938, been
wrenched away from Earth and
flung into the nethermost voids of
space . . .

THE two experimenters stood be-
fore a sprawling apparatus on the
workbench, whose various unortho-
dox parts were connected with
strands of silvery-looking wire but
paler in color. A modest fortune in
beryllium lay there and its many
lines were to carry a new type of
energy—a leaping sizzling kind of
energy that would have burned
copper to vapor and would have
caused even silver to weaken and
soften. Some of the coils of
beryllium were immersed in vats of

liquid air to preserve them from a
like fate.

  A dialed panel reposed at the
center of the maze with a series
of button switches and illumined
indicators over its surface. Hardly
breathing, the two men watched
the meters as the professor slowly
twisted one dial after another. Up
above, hung from the ceiling and
connected to the panel by a single
wire, was a triangle of delicate wir-
ing, again beryllium.

  It was the aerial for psycho-
waves.

  Suddenly there was sound and the
two men stiffened attentively. Yet
it was not sound! Nothing came
through the air from the apparatus
to their ears, yet they seemed to
hear voices—voices that went di-
rectly to their brains without pass-
ing through their auditory organs.

  They were simply thought-waves,
vastly amplified by the psycho-re-
ceiver and so powerful that they im-
pinged directly on the auditory seat
of the brain.

  In awe and wonder they looked
at each other’s toil-lined faces as
they heard the cacophonous voices of
a million different people. They were
hopelessly entangled, like a radio re-
ceiver attuned to the entire wave-
band at once.

  “The voice of the world!” whis-
pered Professor Thode almost rev-
erently. “The constant flow of
thought that whirls about our heads
and is never heard except in a few
instances. Every human on Earth
must always be thinking something
but the thoughts can never be de-
tected except bv super-sensitive
minds and then only under excep-
tional circumstances—those care-
fully arranged experiments in telep-
athy.

  “With this sort of receiver and
amplifier one can be in touch with
all the world’s thoughts at once.
Listen now while I turn the selector
dial.” His face wore a rapt expres-
sion.
THE CHESSBOARD OF MARS	101

  The scientist twisted the dial and
clutched at his chest as a dry cough
bent him almost double. He would
have fallen except that Fred Bilte,
his assistant, caught him in strong
arms and helped him to a chair.

  “Success, Fred! Success!” cried
the old scientist weakly when his
coughing had subsided.

  That ecstasy of achievement had
cost them ten years of painstaking
research and most of the professor’s
fortune. Ten years before Professor
Boris Thode, retired from the indus-
trial boom that had enriched him,
had said—

  “The mystery of thought! How is
it born? How does it manifest it-
self? Regardless of the contempt
that science shows toward telep-
athy I truly believe in it. I believe
that thought can be transmitted as
readily as voice, as light, as elec-
tricity—if only we knew the means!”

AT THE time it seemed to Fred
Bilte that they had completely
lost themselves in a maze of pseudo-
science. They pursued research that
was only half science, the other
half something beyond.

  They had combed the entire ether
spectrum in the search for thought-
waves. Cosmic rays, gamma rays,
X-rays had been the first three steps.
Then had come the examination of
several octaves only slightly explored
by others. The ultra-violet, visible
light and infra-red had been dis-
sected for their purpose. Another
little known gap in the scale next,
then the radio waves, finally the
alternating current waves.

  Each of these had been suspected
in turn of being the range of psycho-
waves but what they had sought
had not been found.

  They had gone further. Above the
scale they explored waves that were
possibly the answer to the condensa-
tion of nebulae but were not in any
way related to thought radiation.

  Then, below the cosmic rays, they
came across radiations, half electro-

magnetic, half something else, that
were closely related to gravitation.
These had proved to be a sort of
transition product between ether
emanations and waves that had no
measurable velocity. Just as the
Archaeopteryx was a transition be-
tween reptiles and birds in prehis-
toric times.

  The Z-rays, they were tentatively
named. They had a shorter wave-
length than the cosmic rays and a
still more terrific penetrative power.
They were apparently the next step
above the gravitation rays, which
were undoubtedly infinitely penetra-
tive. In common with the latter
these Z-rays had an almost infinite
velocity in that mysterious sub-ether
beyond the electro-magnetic ether.

  It was only a year before that
the professor had said eagerly,
tensely, “All electro-magnetic waves
have a constant speed, something
over one-hundred-eightv-six-thou-
sand miles a second. These new
Z-rays below the cosmic, of a dif-
ferent order, must have a far higher
speed, possibly beyond measurement.
And the penetration of thought,
though figurative, i s proverbial!
Come on! There’s work ahead and
hope!”

  A month after they succeeded in
first absorbing thought-waves out
of the air they had completed a pair
of miniature psycho-receivers
modeled after the big set, with which
they planned to carry out tests of
range and selectivity. These were
contained in small flat wooden cases
that fitted easily into their pockets.
The energy supply was a tiny bat-
terylike cylinder of cellophane con-
taining delicate coils of gossamer
beryllium.

  “It’s simple,” explained the pro-
fessor at the doubt that was still
in Bilte’s face. “Supnose we are
separated now by a distance of a
hundred miles. I send my thoughts
out. Your receiver picks them up
instantaneously and amplifies them.”

  “But what amplifies them?” in-
102

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

sisted Bilte.

  “Your own thought emanations!1"
The old scientist smiled. He was
again a jump ahead of his assistant.
“Your own psycho-waves, constantly
contacting the receiver-coils in your
pocket, induce a psycho-current
which amplifies the far weaker
waves coming from me.

  “There is an analogy in radio
transmission. Very weak stations
are sometimes caught up in the car-
rier wave of a powerful station and
are thereby greatly amplified. The
carrier wave of your psycho-waves
will similarly pick up and strengthen
my incoming emanations.”

   “But then I will be receiving both
sets of thoughts.”

  “Well, I hope”—the professor
grinned—“that you can distinguish
your own thoughts from mine!”
Bilte grinned sheepishly in return.
“Then as long as these test receivers
are done let’s try them out.”

  “All right. You have a sister in
Los Angeles, Fred, whom you
haven’t visited for some time?”
“Not for three years.”

  “Then take a trip down there and
we’ll see if these psycho-phones, as
we may call them, will give us an un-
broken connection. Each hour dur-
ing the day, on the hour, we will con-
nect up and transmit to one another
short sentences of any kind, which
each of us will record in writing at
both ends. Then, on your return,
we’ll compare notes. Now pack up
and go—but be back in two weeks.”

CHAPTER II
Mass Psychology

BILTE returned from Los Angeles
on July first, 1938. That date
meant nothing in particular to the
two experimenters but to the world
it was to signify that three weeks
later would come the Great Change.

  A comparison of notes indicated
that their connection had been com-
plete and perfect at all times. It
struck a sort of wonder in their
minds to think that two humans,
separated by hundreds of miles,
could converse freely with but a
slight mental effort.

  Radio was much the same but re-
quired ponderous apparatus and
much attention. With the psycho-
phones communication was magi-
cally simple.

  Professor Thode was elated at the
success in this first step toward ap-
plied telepathy but Bilte noticed be-
fore he had been back long that the
elderly scientist seemed preoccupied.
Even while comparing notes and
commenting on the different phases
of the experiment the professor's at-
tention wandered erratically.

  “What is it, professor?” Bilte
asked finally, pushing the written
pages aside.

  Professor Thode started, then
motioned toward the laboratory.
Striding to the set with which they
had first received outside thought
waves he snapped the on-switch. He
made no motion to alter the tuning.

  Suddenly it came, a loud “voice”
—yet it was not a voice as their
other thought pickups had been. It
seemed to be more of an emotion that
had somehow been converted into a
psycho-wave. No actual word-
thoughts were distinguishable, yet
the general meaning of the message
became clearer as the amplified
emanations continued to radiate
from the set.

  Bilte looked in amazement at the
professor as he felt his heart pump
faster and his muscles unconsciously
tighten. “Just what is it?” he asked,
perplexed. “It isn’t really a definite
message. It seems more like a—an
emotion! As if we had tuned in the
incoherent thoughts of an enraged
man!”

  “Whatever it is,” murmured the
professor, “it comes in from at least
a hundred different psycho-wave
THE CHESSBOARD OF MARS	103

lengths like a chain-station! And
there’s something ominous; threaten-
ing about it.”

  They stared at each other silently
for a moment.

 “Just what do you think it
means?” whispered Bilte.

  Withholding an answer the pro-
fessor pointed to the panel board.
A fine needle, delicately balanced on
a sharp agate pivot, reposed there
in a hollow formed by a group of
beryllium coils.

  “I’ve constructed a psycho-sensi-
tive unit,” explained the professor,
“which will point to the source of
any psycho-wave when connected to
the big set. Watch.”

  As Soon as the mysterious mes-
sage began again to emanate from
the set the sensitized needle flicked
back and forth in wide gyrations.
When it gradually subsided it
pointed out the window across the
blue of the Pacific.

 “Which means,” said the old
scientist, “that the source of the
radiation lies somewhere out in the
Pacific—or across it in Asia. By the
power with which it comes in, sup-
posing it to be at least a thousand
miles away, the source must be a
greatly energized one. Obviously no
single human mind could produce
such a powerful thought-emanation
without some sort of amplification.”
“You mean,” gasped Bilte, “that
someone else ha s—accomplished
what we have and—”

ROFESSOR Thode nodded re-
luctantly. “Either that or it may
be the combined mass radiation of a
group of people.” His eyes narrowed
strangely. “Mass psychology di-
rected toward one goal—almost mass
hypnotism.

  “This psycho-message that we re-
ceive so powerfully and on so many
different wpve-lengths may be the
fighting spirit of a nation, feeding
and constantly renewing itself on
military propaganda! You will no-
tice that the needle pointed directly

west—toward Japan!”

  Then he stirred himself under
Bilte’s incredulous stare. “Yes, far-
fetched I know, Fred. Either of the
two possibilities has me intrigued. I
couldn’t rest without knowing the
true answer. Therefore we’ll track
down the source of this super-power-
ful psycho-radiation!”

  Aboard an ocean liner speeding
toward Japan, the two experi-
menters became daily more excited
as the needle never failed to point
westward to the land of flowers and
sloe-eyed people. It was a half day
before docking that they made a
final test. They watched the swing-
ing needle come to a rigid halt.

  The professor uttered a surprised
exclamation and bent lower over
the needle. “Good Lord! It isn’t
pointing to Japan now, at least not
to Japan proper. It lines up”—he
hastily unfolded a map of the Jap-
anese archipelago—“with the first
of the Kurile Islands!”

  He sat dowrn weakly. “That then
precludes my theory.”

  Bilte fidgeted uneasily. “Well, if
it isn’t the mass mind-delusion of
a great number of people and since
it can’t be the emanation of one
single mind it must be a mechanical-
ly amplified psycho-radiation.” He
shuddered a bit. “The nearer we
draw to the source the more I feel
a sort of involuntary animosity—a
dissatisfaction with lots of things.”
Professor Thode nodded. “I feel
it too—rolling waves beating at our
subconscious minds, stirring our
fighting blood like fanfares of mar-
tial music! Foreign correspondents
have mentioned that strange feeling
of restlessness and militarism as
though all the nation were bathed
in the fiery breath of Mars, god of
war—as in Central Europe in nine-
teen hundred and fourteen. The
breath of Mars—”

  The professor’s voice suddenly
hardened. “Suppose a Japanese
scientist stumbled on psycho-phe-
nomena in his research and pro-
104	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

gressed with it as far or farther than
we—to the point where amplification
of psycho-waves is possible.

  “Suppose he decided to conceal his
discovery from the world and in-
stead pervert it to evil use—to the
purpose of stirring his people to
conquest. That man could have set
up to the north, where our needle
points, a powerful thought amplifier
with which to accomplish his pur-
pose !”

  “Very possible,” agreed Bilte
gloomily. “But how could he—this
hypothetical Machiavelli—c o n t r o 1
his emanations so that only the Jap-
anese people were subject to their in-
fluence?”

  “He wouldn’t have to control
them. The most direct and powerful
of them would saturate Japan and
the east coast of Asia, which is un-
der Japanese dominance anyway. To
the north and east and south the
radiations would go a long way be-
fore impinging upon large groups
of other races. In fact, it may be
those tailings of the original radia-
tions that have so stirred Europe
today and placed it upon the brink
of another fearful internal war.”

  It was at this point that the two
men began to realize that they had
stumbled onto something of major
political importance.

  “Fred,” said the old scientist later
in a fierce low voice of determina-
tion, “regardless of the consequences
you and I are going to trace down
this mysterious psycho-emanation!”

THEY landed in Tokyo and im-
mediately embarked again on a
coastal steamer for Nemuro on the
island of Yeddo. Some seventy miles
to the northeast lay the first of the
Kurile Islands and the needle pointed
rigidly in its direction. There was
two days’ delay at Nemuro before
much argument and bribery con-
vinced the Japanese port officials
that the two American tourists were
not spies.

  In calm clear weather Professor

Thode and his assistant, chauffeured
by a taciturn native, motored their
way in a launch to the island at
which their needle pointed a damn-
ing finger.

  By judicious use of a compass and
their combined sense of direction
they were able to determine, three
hours later, that they had reached
the approximate point where the
needle’s line of extension intersected
the coast. They landed at a stretch
of weed-grown sandiness. Standing
on the shore Bilte hesitated.

  “We’re absolutely unarmed, pro-
fessor, and we don’t know what
we’re walking into.”

  But the old scientist had already
set the needle apparatus on the
sand and again closed the switch.
The quivering needle swung in a
lightning quarter circle and fastened
rigidly to the northwest, without the
least hesitant swinging back and
forth as formerly.

  The two men looked at each other
significantly.

  “It must be very close!” whispered
Bilte hoarsely.

  Professor Thode was already mak-
ing his way toward a fringe of
gnarled bushy growths further down
the shore, beyond Which nothing
could be distinguished. Almost like
a robot he strode along and Bilte
felt it would be better to check him
before he ran into something un-
expected. But as he was about to
call he saw from the corner of his
eye that the pilot was tugging at
the launch to shove off. To the un-
knowing pilot the place seemed be-
witched with ghostlike voices.

  With a shout Bilte turned back
and pulled him away before he
could get the nose of the launch off
the „ sand. And when Bilte next
turned around the professor was
nowhere in sight!

  He stood a moment, undecided.
Then he heaved at the launch with
all his strength, pulling it as far up
on the sand as he could. Thereupon
he left the beach, reasonably certain
THE CHESSBOARD OF MARS	105

that the pilot, with his slighter
strength, could not drag the launch
clear by himself.

   At a trot, he made for the thickets
and snapped on his pocket psycho-
phone while he ran, hoping to con-
tact the professor in that way. But
it was a vain hope as the very
strength of the projector’s emana-
tions was sufficient to drown out any
lesser psycho-waves.

  Reaching the thickets, Bilte
crashed through the bushy growths,
unmindful of clinging tendrils and
barbs that scratched his skin. Soon
he came out upon clear land that
sloped gently upward for a hundred
feet, then abruptly veered off into a
large depression. The professor was
still nowhere to be seen and a wor-
ried frown came to Bilte’s forehead.

  He ran forward toward the closer
edge of the large depression ahead.
When he had struggled up the short
slope the whole of the little valley
suddenly swung into his line of vi-
sion and he stopped frozen, dumb-
founded in utter amazement.

AT THE exact center of the huge
depression was an apparatus
whose top did not rise above the gen-
eral ground level. Set on a wide
spreading tripod it consisted of
nothing more than a colossal metal
globe whose one surface—that fac-
ing southwest toward Japan—was
punctured by a flanged aperture as
though from it something was meant
to pour.

  Evidently that was the “projec-
tor” whose existence on the island
he and the professor had suspected.
But the other thing his eyes saw he
was not to understand until later.

  Back of the projector was another
spherical globe of metal but this did
not seem to be a permanent part of
the apparatus since it was suspended
a few feet off the ground. That in
itself was astounding—a large
spheroid of metal hanging in the air
like a feather.

  At the same time Bilte saw the

projector and the suspended globe
he saw the professor—and a hoarse
cry burst from his throat. He had
no time to shout again or to rush to
his chief’s assistance. The suspended
spheroid suddenly leaped through
the air, right over the cringing pro-
fessor, who had evidently, been ex-
amining the projector.

  A hole yawned in its under-sur-
face and—Bilte gasped in disbelief—
the professor, without any voluntary
motion on his part, *rose and was
catapulted into the hole as though
an invisible giant’s hand had yanked
him off the ground.

  Then the hole in the spheroid
closed and without a sound the amaz-
ing object levitated itself from the
ground and gradually disappeared
into the blue sky.

   Bilte crouched at the depression’s
edge for a full minute, unab’e to
collect his scattered senses. Then
he staggered in a daze back to the
stretch of beach. Scratched and
bleeding, enervated by the shock of
what he had seen. Bilte hardly no-
ticed at first that the pilot was fran-
tically tugging at the launch and had
almost succeeded in shoving it clear.
Bilte broke into a stumbling run,
shouting madly, and arrived just
in time to climb into the boat with
the pilot.

  Hours later Bilte awoke from a
mental lethargy to notice the quays
and docks of Nemuro rapidly ap-
proaching. Utterly deflated in spirit
he went directly to his hotel room.
All that afternoon and evening he
paced to and fro, trying to think
coherently. What had the spherical
vessel been ? Where was the profes-
sor now ? What was to be his fate ?
What should he. Fred Bilte, do now?
What could he do!

  That same evening, dinnerless and
sleepless, Bilte began to think he was
going mad. He imagined he was
hearing the professor calling his
name. More than once he half turned,
ready to swear the professor must
be there. Suddenly he gasped and
106	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

with trembling fingers pulled out
his pocket psycho-phone, cursing
himself aloud for having neglected
his sole direct means of communica-
tion.

  Immediately at the snap of the
switch the professor’s psycho-voice
reverberated in Bilte’s mind, calling
his name over and over.

“Professor!” Bilte half-shouted.
“Fred! Thank God you’ve finally
closed our contact. I’ve been trying
to connect with you for hours.”
“Professor, are you safe? Where
are you ? What—”

  “Fred, stop! Listen to me. There
is no time to lose. I can't tell you
much because I haven't found out
much. But you’ve got to get away
from Japan and back to the States—
back to our laboratory. I’ve been
locked into a little room in this sh ip
without seeing anybody but I know
it has been moving all the time, its
speed constantly accelerating, and
must be going somewhere.

  “That somewhere must be the
hideout or headquarters of these
people who have made the projector.
The one thing in our favor is that
apparently they don’t know you were
with me on that island. That means
I can relay what I learn to you.

  “But it will take the big set back
home to do that if this ship goes
much further. I will begin contact-
ing you again in five days, whether
or not you give me a return call.
If I'm out of range of your psvcho-
phone I wrill have no way of knowing
whether you are listening or not but
it’s all we can do.

  “If only our big set could transmit
as well as receive! Anyway I'm going
to see the finish of this and pass
what I find out alone: to you. Now
get out of Japan and hurry!”
Perhaps the two servants in Pro-
fessor Thode's laboratory-home were
surprised at Bilte’s orders when he
returned from their foreign trip.
A couch was installed in the experi-
ment room beside the big psycho-
receiver and meals were brought in

regularly. He ordered them to leave
him strictly alone at all times, told
them not to worry about Professor
Thode—that he had gone to China
and would be back some time in the
future.

CHAPTER III
The Voice from the Ether

IT WAS during the evening of July
17, 1938, that Professor Thode’s
psycho-voice first came over the big
set.

  “Fred, are you listening?” it be-
gan. “How useless for me to ask a
question whose answer I may never
know! I have just found out several
things, one of which makes it im-
possible for you ever to contact me
with the psycho-phone.

  “Fred! I told you the ship was ac-
celerating. That puzzled me and
probably you too. Only one type of
ship would do that—a spaceship.
Well, I'm on a spaceship!”

  Bilte bit his tongue. Drops of
blood fell unnoticed from his lips.
The psycho-voice went on.

  “Yes, Fred. I’m on a spaceship.
Just an hour ago the door of my
prison opened and before me stood
a creature—well, a creature. I will
not attempt to describe him. You
can believe that I was thoroughly
frightened and thought I was mad,
especially when the creature spoke
to me—in English—and addressed
me as ‘Earthman/

  “To make it short he informed me
that I was aboard a spaceship bound
for the planet Mars—and that he
was a Martian. My skepticism must
have shown itself in my face for the
creature then took me by the hand
and led me up corridors and pas-
sageways in this amazing vessel and
finally brought me before a window.

 “And there it was—Earth—a
green-grey ball, hanging in space!
THE CHESSBOARD OF MARS	107

  “You can’t imagine the shock of
it, Fred, nor the wonder and glory
of it—seeing the heavens from a
space-ship. The amazing blackness
of space, the steely stars, the im-
pression of tremendous depth, the
shuddering awe of its immensity.
And then Earth—but a ball, a mote,
hanging in the nothingness, its sur-
face indistinct with a gauzy halo
over it.

  “I wonder how long I just stood
there and stared! Finally I turned
to my guide. He seemed amused by
my awe.

  “ ‘Earthman,’ he said, ‘does your
mind reel at these things? I see it
does. Naturally it would. I forget
that the undeveloped intelligence of
Earth has thought of space travel
as remote and in the main improb-
able—if not actually impossible/

  “ ‘Sir,’ I said, not knowing how
else to address him, ‘this is like a
miracle!’

  “The creature—or Martian, I
should say—laughed insolently.
Fred, from that moment on I hated
him! It would be hard to explain
why. Perhaps if his acid laugh and
the peculiar tones of his voice rang
in your ears you too would promptly
hate him—this creature.

  “His whole demeanor was conde-
scending and arrogant—oh, ten
times more arrogant and contemptu-
ous than the most conceited ruler of
Rome could ever have been. He made
me feel, during those few minutes
we were together, that I was a
crawling worm that had to get out
of his path before being stepped
upon.

  “I am back in my little room—my
prison—now. They have been feed-
ing me regularly, a liquid food, very
sweet but satisfying. The room I’m
in has a higher air-pressure than
outside and seems to be equipped es-
pecially for an Earthman. I wonder
what that means?

  “Of course a thousand and one
other speculations have been tortur-
ing me. What were this Martian

and his companions doing on Earth?
What is their connection with the
projection of the psycho-wave that
is inundating Japan with its insidi-
ous influence? Why am I being taken
to Mars?

  “At times I feel I have gone mad
or that this is a horrible nightmare.
And yet it seems to be real. Fred,
tell me, am I—”

THE incoming psycho-voice was
jumbled for a moment. Bilte
crushed his knuckles against the
hard bench top till the skin cracked.

  Then, came from the void, “I shall
have to remember I am a scientist,
Fred, and as such must keep my
wits. I’ve figured that I have been
aboard now over six Earth days and
we can’t be more than halfway, if
that.

  “I suppose you have already added
a hexa-bank amplifier to the set.
Probably you’ll have to add another
to be able to catch my waves when
and if I arrive on Mars. Thank
heaven psycho-waves have such a
great penetrating power and—oh!”

  Bilte started and turned pale at
the agonized gasp that registered
from the professor. Then his voice
came again, broken. “Accelerating—
tremendously—tons of weight—”

  That was all and Bilte staggered
to a chair, mopping a feverish brow.
For twenty-four hours there was
utter silence from the psycho-ether
tuned to Professor Thode’s wave-
length and Bilte grew haggard in
anxiety.

  In the early morning of July 19th,
the suspense ended. Thereafter the
Professor radiated messages three
separate times—a lost soul crying
from a spatial wilderness. Only Fred
Bilte was ever to know the full de-
tails of Professor Thode’s three mes-
sages from the planet Mars.

July 19, 2 A. M.

  The ship has landed on Mars,
Fred. When I last contacted you a
full day ago our connection was
broken when I was hurled against
108

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

the wall by a terrific surge of the
ship. Soon after I lost consciousness
and when next I opened my eyes I
could see through a window that we
were no longer in space but on a
solid surface. In short, on Mars!

  If I could somehow transmit to
you psycho-television, then perhaps
you might then gain some idea of
this Martian city that spreads be-
fore me. Imagine spires and towers
a mile high—bulbous dwelling places
suspended at any and all heights—
majestic edifices that could house a
hundred of Earth’s ocean liners—
columnar decorations glinting with
inlaid jewels and burnished metals—
all intertwined and connected with
conduits and tunnels and such.

  This is a city of Mars I’m in,
Fred, the only city!

  I’ve found out many things. The
duration of intelligent life on Mars
goes back a half million years. It was
then that the Martians developed
their speech and writing and first
beginnings of science.

  Their early history—when, Earth
was but a primeval jungle—is curi-
ously parallel to our own recorded
story—a series of wars, famines,
pestilences, revolutions and mass mi-
grations. They had seas then and
continents and islands, just as on
Earth.

  It was a hundred thousand years
after their first written records that
spatial navigation became possible
to their science—and the Martians
swarmed all over the Solar System.
No life was found on any of the
outer planets nor on their satellites
by reason of their remoteness from
the life-giving Sun. Mercury sup-
ported a hardy silicic form of unin-
telligent life. Venus and Earth were
steamy pots, of struggling evolution-
ary forms of life and man was yet
unborn on our world.

  Thus the Martians were sole
rulers and masters of the Solar Sys-
tem. For the next hundred thousand
years the most precious and useful
products of all the different planets

were brought to Mars to further and
make great Martian civilization.

BUT the next hundred-thousand-
year period was a period of
breaking down rather than building
up. With the immense strides of
their science deadly and horrible
weapons of destruction were de-
veloped and the various classes and
races fell on one another and waged
war. These periodic wars gradually
became more and more catastrophic
and disastrous and the once teeming
and thriving population dwindled.

  It his hard to believe but my Mar-
tian mentor—his name is Sokon—in-
timated that for a long time the sole
ambition, thought, and endeavor of
all Mars was toward warfare and
military dominion. First one race
and then another gained ascendancy
in endless cycles that might have
gone on forever.

  Truly, Fred, from what I’ve
learned this planet was rightfully,
even if accidentally, named after the
god of war—Mars!

  But it could not go on indefinitely
because of the rapidity with which
the population dwindled. About fifty
thousand years ago all the planet lay
wasted and war-torn and its deni-
zens numbered but a few millions,
scattered all over the planet in proud
little isolated communities, each a
deadly enemy of the others.

  You can surmise that while the
long series of wars went on scientific
advancement was hampered and the
peaceful trade fell almost to nothing.
I am beginning to think, Fred, that
warfare on Earth is a small thing
compared to what it must be in such
an advanced superscientific world.

  But just when it seemed that their
civilization was doomed to suicide—
the few millions left would not feed
their weapons more than another
century—salvation came to them.

  That, Fred, is all I know of the
story of Mars. For some strange—
and I fear awful—reason my mentor
would tell me no more on the sub-
THE CHESSBOARD OF MARS	Iffl

ject. How the unity of the warlike
Martians was achieved, I shall tell
you when I find out.

  Someone is coming into my room
now, Fred! Goodby! You’ll hear
from me—if Providence wills it—as
soon as I can manage it in secrecy as
I fear to transmit in the presence of
Sokon.

July 20, 4 A. M.

  I have finally got the chance to
transmit to you again, Fred, but you
will never know what torture I went
through for awhile before I could
bring myself to contact you once
more. Perhaps it would be better
that you should never hear what I
have learned in the past day here on
Mars.

  But I have made the decision to
tell you all, Fred, and if it plunges
your mind into a fog such as mine,
heaven forgive me for the act!

  Some hours ago Sokon took me to
the roof of this giant building and
into an airship. In this vehicle we
darted over the immense mazes of
this city to its outskirts. There the
ship dropped to what must be the
largest building on Mars. I estimate
it at a mile square, yet it is not high.

  Not a word did Sokon speak all
this time. But after landing on the
roof of this Cyclopean structure he
faced me with a strange and dread-
ful smile.

  “Earthman,” he said, “now you
shall find the answers to all your
questions. Look around”—he waved
an arm to include the conglomeration
of strange apparatuses spread all
over the roof near the landing field—
‘‘and know that from here is con-
trolled the superficial destiny of
Earth!”

  Of Earth! The thought rocketed
through my brain and made me
weak. What could he mean? I was
soon to know.

  The apparatus, I might explain,
seemed to my wavering mind a hope-
less maze of geared machinery, all
covered with some transparent pro-
tective material from which pro-

truded hundreds of long thin spouts,
or nozzles. Meaningless for the mo-
ment—but later they came to have a
frightful significance.

  Sokon then took me down an ele-
vator, down into the building itself.
I wish I could picture for you the
scene that met my unbelieving eyes
as the elevator door opened and I
was led out upon a balcony from
which could be viewed the entire in-
terior, which was one immense room.

  All around me was the gigantic
columned interior. Evenly spaced
across the floor were hundreds of
rows of apparatuses something like
organ consoles, in each of which sat
a Martian.

   Close scrutiny of one of the affairs
just below me revealed it as a circu-
lar button board in the center of
which sat the operator. As I watched
his long arm with its sensitive fin-
gers flicked buttons with marvelous
rapidity, causing little pilot lights
to flash. About his head was a maze
of wires and tubes connected to the
control board by several strands of
heavy wire.

  But of what use to describe to you
something whose immensity and
alien quality you could never grasp,
except that it relieves my tired mind
to tell of these common details. I
will go on, as Sokon went on when
I had recovered from astonishment
and wonder.

  Sokon returned to the previous
day’s talk and picked up the thread
of the story he had left unfinished.
The Martians, faced with self-in-
flicted extinction, decided at last that
it was foolish to fight among them-
selves when they could satiate their
battle lust in a w^ay not at all harm-
ful to their persons.

  Earth had been explored, and on
its surface had been found a form
of life with rational intelligence, in-
habiting forests and caves—Paleo-
lithic Man. A diabolical plan was
conceived and with a hue and a cry
the Martians adopted it in bound-
less enthusiasm.
110	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

  With their marvelous science and
their full and complete understand-
ing of psycho-phenomena they built
psycho-transmitters capable of pro-
jecting psycho-beams all the way to
Earth, which would give the Mar-
tians practical control of the activity
of mankind on the young world!

CHAPTER IV
The Chessboard op Mars

I CAN see you now, Fred, trem-
bling and pale, not daring to be-
lieve. Yet it is God’s truth!

  These control boards, at each of
which sits a Martian like a gloating
tyrant, are psycho - transmitters
which project to Earth, at the will
of the operator, any sort of psycho-
emotion or actual direct thought.

  You will understand that the Mar-
tians have refined and improved
their apparatus beyond our under-
standing, so that they can either
fasten like a leech to one certain
mind of Earth, to a group or to a
whole nation—and pour their insidi-
ous psycho-emotions forth like a foul
wave of slime.

  And the sole purpose and aim of
each Martian is to wreak as much
bloodshed and harm as he can on
Earth!

  So all through the ages, while
aboriginal man gradually arose from
ignorance and darkness to the glim-
merings of intelligence, the Martians
have been holding mankind back, in-
stigating wars, tribal battles, per-
sonal fights and internecine revolu-
tions, satisfying their bloodthirsty,
warlike natures in playing warlord

  Earth! Like an evil entity in the
heavens, the Martians have been
strewing the pages of Earth history
with blood and gore and hatred and
discontent.

  It has always been the wonder and
surprise of most intelligent people

of our time, Fred, why mankind had
wars at all, why there was constant
bickering and battling when things
could be settled so easily in more
peaceful ways.

  “The beast in us” it was called but
actually it was the beast being put
into us! And God only knows how
far ahead the world might be on the
road to true civilization if it weren’t
in the fatal bloody grip of Mars.

  All through the ages then our
superficial destiny has been guided
from Mars by beings who, not will-
ing to battle themselves, have in-
stead caused battles and bloodshed
on another world. Sokon tediously
traced Earth history for me, with
which naturally all Martians are
smugly familiar. He showed me all
the innumerable incidents which we
thought to be the course of fate but
which were really the results of the
Martians’ psycho-waves—a vicari-
ous means of satiating their lust for
battle.

  Just to give a few instances. Alex-
ander the Great, world conqueror,
was started on his bloody career by
a Martian psycho-beam that from
babyhood on stirred his fighting
and ruling nature. The psycho-emo-
tion goaded him and tormented him
till he had to obey its call.

  Partly under its guidance and
partly due to the conditions under
which he lived, he swept out from
Macedonia and poured blood on
dozens of battlefields. Alexander's
whole army was constantly under
the influence of a psycho-beam from
Mars, which made them so vicious
and fighting mad that they swept all
before them, including the Persian
hosts of Darius.

  Then Attila, the Hun. His inva-
sions were first conceived in a Mar-
tian brain and then forced on him so
that he became one of the bloodiest
and most vicious scourges in Earth’s
history. His little slant-eyed troops
were bathed in a psycho-beam so
powerful that some of the worst
atrocities of all time were the result.
THE CHESSBOARD OF MARS	111

  Then Napoleon, the little corporal
who as a youth dreamed of a great
France. His dreams were not his
own—they came hurtling across
millions of miles of space and were
implanted in his sensitive and keen
mind. He arose, lashed by the ham-
mering psycho-beams and swept all
Europe, wallowing in blood, sacrific-
ing human lives without pity.

  Yet it was not Napoleon himself
who cared so little for human life
and suffering. It was the Martians
across space who chuckled in glee
when vast armies swept together
and decimated one another.

  Then, in the modern world that
we know—the fearful carnage of the
World War when mankind had ad-
vanced enough scientifically to pro-
duce terrible weapons that reminded
the Martians of their own disbarred
ones. In telling of this last Earth
war let me mention again the build-
ing and its psycho-control boards.

  The boards are divided among all
the different nations that were for-
merly represented on Mars before
their union. Each group, still as
proud and hateful as of yore when
they battled with guns instead of
psycho-waves, concentrates itself on
a certain warlike project on Earth.
For instance, in the World War, the
Martians decided to make it a grand
and glorious game between two and
only two sides.

  Accordingly half the boards were
then relegated to control the Allies,
the other half the Central Powers.

  I will never be able to erase from
my mind, Fred, the unutterable look
of glee on Sokon’s face as he told
me that never in all their fifty thou-
sand years of playing had the Mar-
tians had so much “fun” as during
the World War! It had been a
grand game which had occasioned
intense rivalry and they had been
sorry when it finally ended!

THINK of it, Fred! All Earth,
every section and corner of it,
constantly under the evil influence

which darts from Mars at instan-
taneous velocity and submerges it in
psycho-waves that have as much to
do with the destiny of Earth’s peo-
ples as their owrn hampered efforts to
rise above brutality and bloodshed.

  The chief occupation of the Mar-
tians in the past ages of their civili-
zation was warfare. Now their chief
occupation is playing on this gigantic
chessboard of Mars, moving humans
in paths of fate as the chess player
moves his pawns and pieces!

  And, Fred, the Martians got so
much enjoyment out of the last
World War that they have again de-
cided to play such a two-sided game.
Japan is to be the nucleus of one
warrior group, Russia the nucleus
of the other. They plan, so Sokon
tells me, to draw into this war all the
nations of Earth in a grand melee
which they plan to make a dozen
times more horrible than the last
holocaust!

  Furthermore Sokon informed me
that the projector set up on that
Kurile island, which we first thought
to be the work of an Earth madman,
is part of a secret plot of his to beat
the other side. One of the “rules”
of the game is that neither side shall
set up concentration projectors on
Earth itself, as this would give it
too much opportunity to incite
Earth and destroy it completely.

  Sokon and several of his arch-
plotters secretly went to Earth a
year ago and set up the projector.
This will incite the Japanese much
faster than the enemy and cause
them to arm more quickly and fight
more viciously.

  This reveals to me the true de-
cadence and evil of Martian nature
in general. Whatever was the initial
cause the Martians grew up with a
far greater heritage of warlikeness
than—I am sure—ever reposed in
Earth-people’s basic natures.

  If only there were something I
could do! If only there were some
way I could destroy them!

  Goodby, Fred! Perhaps goodby
112	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

for good. Sokon is waiting for my
reeling mind to break down. He does
this now and then with Earthmen,
delighting to watch them fall to
pieces when knowing the truth. In
case there is anything more I should
want to transmit wait for me a full
Earth day. If I do not call by then
you will know that I am dead.

IN SILENCE that seemed to echo
with the satanic leers of other-
world demons, Fred Bilte moved
about the laboratory with a sort of
aimless purpose. He rummaged in
the cabinet, taking from it papers
covered with scrawled formulae.

  Hours later he took the sizeable
batch he had collected and burned
them wholesale on the tile floor,
opening a window to let the acrid
smoke out. He stared until the last
flame went out. The secret of psycho-
detection would not leave the labora-
tory.

  Then he went to his couch. His
eyes glinting with a bleakness like
that of frigid space itself, he
stretched himself out stiffly. His face
was like a graven wax mask. He
waited, not caring to sleep. He re-
fused entrance to the manservant
with a tray of food and in the early
hours of July 21st the professor’s
voice came again.

  Fred! Fred! Are you there? Pray
God you are. Sokon had not tor-
tured me enough so he again dragged
me to the chessboard of human life
not many hours after the first time
—and went into vivid detail more
horrible than I dare to relate to you.

  Suddenly an enormous thought
struck me—a mad thought. Yet it
may have been a sublime thought. I
will soon know.

  Sokon, whom I will curse in my
dying breath above all other Mar-
tians as the master fiend of them
all, took me into the section whose
psycho-boards are on the enemy side
—Russia’s side, you know, in this
titanic Earth war they are investi-
gating. One of that side’s members

threw a taunt to Sokon, which he
returned with interest. The taunting
grew and became a quarrel between
the two Martians.

  It was then the thought struck me.
I obeyed my sudden inclination to
carry it through and dashed away
from the two bickering Martians
and ran further into the section
whose members are opposed to So-
kon in the war game.

  I betrayed Sokon at the top of my
voice and told his opponents of the
illegal projector which had been set
up on Earth. Head after head stirred
from the boards and jerked up,

  Then Sokon came bearing down on
me, having heard a little and sur-
mised the rest. He fastened his bale-
ful speckled eyes on me and my
voice died in my throat. I uttered a
brief prayer and waited for death.

  But it did not come!

  I opened my eyes a moment later
to find a dozen Martians, all enemies
of Sokon, protecting me from him.
Furthermore they were demanding
something from him and I could
easily guess what.

  I know little or nothing of just
what was done then. I was led by
the hand to a little cupola of trans-
parent material which overhangs the
entire interior of the building. In it
are strange instruments that I sur-
mise to be deadly weapons. This
cupola seems to be a sort of policing
center to insure peace in the as-
sembly. The guns are on swivel
mounts and can rake any part of the
building.

1AM here in that cupola above the
chessboards now, Fred. I have
not been fed for several hours. My
throat is parched and dry. I am
numb from mental agony. Yet a
faint spark of hope has been born
within me. Not hope for myself—no.
What does my life mean? But hope
for Earth! Perhaps the investiga-
tion will result in the removal of the
projector on Earth.

  That there is an investigation in
THE CHESSBOARD OF MARS	113

progress, I know. One of the fellows
up here in the cupola—there are
dozens of them, equally divided in
allegiance—casually told me that as
soon as the right part of Earth’s sur-
face turns in the direction of Mars
their powerful telescopes will ex-
amine the Kurile Islands for that
outlawed projector. I asked wrhat
would be the result when it was
found. He made a shrugging ges-
ture but his hand unconsciously
caressed the gun near him.

  There is nothing more to say,
Fred, except that there is unrest in
the very atmosphere around here. I
can almost feel the hatred and sus-
picion welling up between the two
sides. What the outcome of my ac-
tion in betraying Sokon will be. I
don’t know. But almost all my suffer-
ing at that devil’s hands is repaid
at the thought that at least I’ve put
him in a troublesome predicament.

  The voice ceased. Later it burst
forth again, excitedly.

  A message, Fred! A message cor-
roborating my story—the telescopes
sawr the projector! Also they saw
something more—a spaceship land-
ing beside it and blowing it to drift-
ing dust. Sokon had sent a space-
ship post-haste to Earth to destroy
the incriminating evidence of his
treachery—but too late!

  I hardly know what to say about
things here now. Excitement is run-
ning high. Many Martians have left
their boards and are gathering in
little groups. There is much shout-
ing back and forth. The very air
is electrified with wrath and hatred.
Sokon is down there, conferring with
his henchmen. His opponents are
glaring angrily in his direction for
he has been a leader of the other side.

  The fellow's up in this gun-cage
are very nervous and fidgety. They
have in their hands the power to
wipe out all below them. The sym-
pathizers of Sokon in the cupola are
sitting at their guns. The others are
watching the scene below.

  Something’s beginning now!

  A group from Sokon’s opposition
is running at him, shouting, Sokon
faces about in fear—it is the begin-
ning of a riot! They near him . . .
several Martians tumble in the rush
. . . Lord! . . . Sokon gunners just
fired a livid bolt of something that
whiffed a dozen Martians to dust!
Now the opposing gunners retaliate
with a bolt to the other side!

  It is a battle royal now! Without
restraint the gunners are shooting
down rioting Martians! Hundreds
have been converted to puffs of va-
por. Good! This in a small measure
repays Earth for the sacrifice of her
murdered peoples. This thing is
getting bigger and bigger—perhaps
it will become . . .

  Yes! Part of the roof has been dis-
integrated. At its edges appear Mar-
tians from the city with weapons
that they rapidly install like ma-
chine-guns . . . the disintegrating
bolts are becoming thick . . . the
battling and rioting is turning into
an actual war. I can see centuries
of repression swelling into a terrific
bloodlust. I see a giant airship ... it
hovers above the roof . . . the roof
puffs away ... a searching ray
springs from the ship ... it is sweep-
ing in circles and in its path nothing
remains... death for the Martians
. . . my heart sings!

  The gunners here are busy wiping
out their fellowmen in absolute war
madness. It is awful, the look in
their eyes. Now is my chance. I am
stealing over to the giant chessboard
psycho-transmitter. A few twists of
several different levers and I am
ready to start.

  I’m wiping out the entire bloody
planet, Fred ... I’m concentrating
on the thought that every Martian
kill his neighbor, kill himself . . .
Never before have the psycho-waves
been used at such short range . . .
The psycho-transmitter is now fo-
cused to envelop all Mars with its
waves of hate . . . I’m. not leaving
this machine until I have destroyed
every Martian, one by one . . .

A Novelet by JACK WILLIAMSON

CHAPTER I

The Mountain of the Moon

BEFORE me, not half a mile
away, rase the nearest ram-
parts of the Mountain of the
Moon. It was after noon and the red
sun blazed down on the bare un-
dulating sandy waste with fearful
intensity.

  The air was still and intolerably
hot. Heat waves danced ceaselessly
over the uneven sand.

  I felt the utter loneliness, the wild
mystery and overwhelming power
of the desert. The black cliffs rose
cold and solid in the east—a barrier
of dark menace. Pillars of black
basalt, of dark hornblende, of black
obsidian rose in a precipitous wall of
sharp and jagged peaks that curved
back to meet the horizon.

  Needle-like spires rose a thousand
feet and nowhere was the escarp-
ment less than half that high. It was
with mingled awe and incipient fear
that I first looked upon the Moun-
tain of the Moon.

  It was a year since I had left
medical college in America to begin
practise in Perth, Australia. There
I had an uncle who was my sole sur-
viving relative. My companion on

the voyage had been Dr. Horace
Austen, the well-known radiologist,
archeologist and explorer. He had
been my dearest friend. That he
was thirty years my senior had
never interfered with our comrade-
ship. It was he who had paid most
of my expenses in school.

  He had left me at Perth and gone
on to investigate some curious
ruined columns that a traveler had
reported in the western part of the
Great Victoria Desert. There Austen
had simply vanished. He had left
Kanowna and the desert had swal-
lowed him up. But it was his way,
when working on a problem, to go
into utter seclusion for months at
a time.

  My uncle was an ardent radio en-
thusiast and it was over one of his
experimental short wave sets that
we picked up the remarkable mes-
sage from my lost friend that led
me to abandon my practise and,
heeding the call of adventure that
has always been strong in those of
my blood, to seek the half mythical
Mountain of the Moon in the heart
of the unexplored region of the

Great Victoria Desert of Western
Australia.

T^HE message was tantalizingly

  brief and hard to interpret. We
picked it up five times over a period
of two weeks, always just after
sunset. Evidently, it was sent by
one who had not recently practised
his knowledge of code and it seemed
that the sender was always in a
great hurry or under considerable
nervous tension, for minor errors
and omissions were frequent. The
words were invariably the same. I
copy them from an old notebook.

  To Winfield Fowler, physician,
Perth, Australia—/. Horace Austen,
am lost in an unknown new world,
where alien terrors reign. It lies in
a crater in the Mountain -of the
Moon. I implore you to come to my
aid, for the sake of mankind.

  Bring arms and my equipment—
and Roentgen tubes and coils, and
the spectrometer. Ascend ladder at
west pinnacle. Find my friend Mel-
var, maiden of the crystal city, whom
I left beyond the Silver Lake. Come
for the sake of civilization and may
whoever hears this forward it with
all dispatch.

   My uncle was inclined to suspect
a hoax. But after the message had
come over twice I received telegrams
from several other radio amateurs
who had heard it, and were for-
warding it to me. We took the di-
rection of the third call and had
amateurs in Adelaide do the same.
The lines intersected in the Great
Victoria Desert, at a point very
near that at which Wellington lo-
cated the Mountain of the Moon

human as a man but grave and
serious as a scientist, it was impos-
sible for me to take the message as
a practical joke, as my uncle—derid-
ing the possibility of my friend’s be-
ing imprisoned in “an unknown new

world”—insisted it was.

  It was equally impossible for one
of my impetuous and adventurous
disposition to devote himself to any
prosaic business when so attractive
a mystery was beckoning. Then I
would never in any case have hesi-
tated to go to Austen's aid.

  I got together the apparatus he
had mentioned—it was some equip-
ment he had left with me when he
went on—as well as my emergency
medicine kit, a heavy rifle, two .45
Colt automatics and a good supply
of ammunition. Then I waited for
more explicit signals. But the calls
had not come regularly and after
the fifth no more were heard.

  Having waited another irksome
week I bade my uncle farewell and
got on the train. I left the rail-
way at Kanowna, and bought three
ponies. I rode one, packed pro-
visions, equipment and water
bottles on the other two. Nothing
need be said of the perils of the jour-
ney. Three weeks later I came in
sight of the mountain.

  Wellington had christened it as he
did because of an apparent simi-
larity to the strange cliff-rimmed
craters of the Moon and the appel-
lation was an apt one. The crags
rose almost perpendicularly from
the sand to the jagged rim. To
climb them was out of the question.

  The rock was polished slick by
wind-blown sands for many feet but
was rough and sharp above. To my
left, at the extreme west point of
the great curve, was a dark needle
spire that towered three hundred
feet above its fellows. I knew that
it must be Austen’s “west pinnacle.”
What sort of ladder I was to ascend
1 had little idea.

  As the Sun sank back of the roll-
ing sea of sand dark purple shadows
rose about the barrier and I was
struck with deep forebodings of the
evil mystery that lay beyond it. The
fold of the desert changed to silver
gray and the gray faded swiftly
while the deep purple mantle swept
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE

up the peaks, displacing even the
deep red crowns that lay like splashes
of blood upon the summits. Still I
felt, or fancied, a strange spirit of
terror that lurked behind the moun-
tain, even in the night.

  Quickly I made camp. Just two of
the ponies were left and they were
near death. (I have passed over the
hardships of my trip.) I hobbled
them on a little patch of grass and

far away, and up, I thought, over
the cliffs. Then the cloth of the tent
was lighted by a faint red glow
thrown on it from above. I shivered
and the strange spell of the moun-
tain and the desert fell heavier upon
me.

  I wanted to go out and investigate
but unfamiliar terror held me
powerless.

 I gripped my automatic and

REDIT for discovery of the first “lost world” must go, of
course, to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s bearded and explosive
Professor Challenger, who first found the isolated South American
plateau where the dinosaurs still range in a volume published in
London in 1912.

  Thus, as major science-fiction themes go, the lost-world idea
is a comparatively new one—perhaps because the Darwinian
theory of evolution was not acceptable to readers of popular fic-
tion until the Edwardian era had tempered the whalebone rigidity
of Victorian conformity.

  At any rate, it arrived some centuries later than the space
voyage, the time machine, the android and other stf staples.

  But once arrived it quickly established itself as a basic theme and has yet to show
signs of waning popularity. There is something inherently fascinating in the pale-
ontological absurdity of little man pitted against the reptilian monsters of the past
that holds the attention not only of its devotees but of motion picture producers and—
yes, even editors.

  For a sterling example of the genre, written and first published more than twenty-
one years ago, you can scarcely do better than read Mr. Williamson’s novelet, THE
ALIEN INTELLIGENCE. •	—The Editor.

brush that grew where water had
run from the cliff, pitched my little
tent and found brush to start a tiny
fire.

  I ate supper with but a scanty
cup of water. Then, oppressed by
the vast mysterious peaks that
loomed portentously in the east,
shutting out the starlight, I went in
the tent and sought my blanket.
Then came the first of those terrible
and inexplicable occurrences that led
up to the great adventure.

FIRST I heard a faint whispering
sound, or rather a hiss, infinitely

waited tensely. The scarlet radiance
shone ever brighter through the
cloth. The sound turned to a hissing
scream. It was deafening and it
plunged straight down. It seemed to
pause, to hover overhead. The red
glare was almost blinding.

 Abruptly the tent was blown
down by a sudden tempest of wind.
For perhaps a minute the terror
hung about me. I lay there in a
strange paralysis of fear while a
hurricane of wind tore at the canvas
upon me. I heard upon the tempest
above that awful whistling, a wild
mad laugh that rang against the
118	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

cliff, weirdly appalling. It was
utterly inhuman, not even the laugh
of a madman. Just once it rang out
and afterward I imagined it had
been my fancy.

  Then the light and the sound
swept up and away. With belated
courage I tore my way from under
the cloth. The stars were like
jewels in the westward sky, where
the zodiacal light was still visible.
The ominous blackness of the moun-
tain blotted out the eastern stars
and the peaks were lighted by a
vague and flickering radiance of
scarlet, like the reflection of un-
pleasant fires beyond.

  Strange pulsing fingers of red
seemed to thrust themselves up
from behind the cliff. Somehow they
gave me the feeling that an in-
credibly great, incredibly evil per-
sonality lurked beyond. The crimson
light shone weirdly on the wild sum-
mits of the mountain as if they were
smeared with blood.

  I threw more brush on the fire,
and crouched over it, feeling uncom-
fortably alone and terrified. When
the flames had flared up I looked
about for the ponies, seeking com-
panionship even in them. They were
gone! At first I thought they had
broken their hobbles and run off but
I could neither see nor hear them
and they had been in no condition
to run far.

  I walked about a little to look for
them, then went back to the fire. I
sat there and watched the eerie un-
wholesome glare that shone over the
mountain. No longer did I doubt
the existence of Austen’s “world
where alien terrors reign.” I knew,
even as I had felt when I first saw
the mountain, that strange life and
power lurked beyond it.

  Presently I stretched the tent
again, and lay down but I did not
sleep.

  At dawn I got up and went to
look for the ponies. I climbed one of
the low dunes and gazed over the
gray infinity of sand but not a sign

of them rewarded my look. I tried
to trail them. I found where they
had been hobbled and followed the
tracks of each to a place where their
hoofs had cut deep in the sandy
turf. Beyond there was no trace.
Then I was certain of what I had
already known, that the Thing had
carried them away.

THEN I found something stranger
still—the prints of bare human
feet, half erased by the wind that
had blown while the terror hung
there. That unearthly laugh and the
footprints—was there a land of
madmen behind the mountain?
And what was the thing that had
come and gone in the night? Those
were questions I could not answer
but daylight dulled my wondering
fear.

  The Sun would not rise on my side
of the mountain until nearly noon
and the cold dark shadow of the cliff
was upon me when the desert all
about was a shimmering white in
the heat of the sun. Austen’s call
had mentioned a ladder. I set out to
find it. Just north of the peak I
came upon it, running straight up
like a silver ribbon to the top of the
cliff.

  It was not the clumsy affair of
ropes that I expected. In fact I
at once abandoned any idea that
Austen had made it at all. It was
an odd looking white metal and it
seemed very old although it was
corroded but little. The rungs were
short white bars, riveted to long
straps which were fastened to the
rock by spikes of the same silvery
metal.

  I have said that the mountain rises
straight from the sand. And the
ladder goes on into the ground. That
suggests that the sand has piled in
on the base of the mountain since
the ladder was put there. At any
rate I am sure that it is incredibly
old.

  I went back to camp, packed to-
gether my guns, a little food and
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE

119

Austen’s equipment—and started
up the ladder. Although it was no
more than six hundred feet to the
top, heavily laden as I was I got
very tired before I reached it. I
stopped several times to rest.

  Once, looking down on the illimi-
table sea of rolling sand, with the
tiny tent and the sharp shadow of
the mountain its only definite fea-
tures, I had a terrible attack of
vertigo. My fears of the night re-
turned until I almost wished I had
never started up the ladder. But I
knew that if I were suddenly back in
Perth again I w^ould be more eager
than ever to set out upon the ad-
venture.

  At last I reached the top and
crawled up in the mouth of a narrow
canyon with black stone walls ris-
ing straight to the peaks on either
side. Down the crevice was a smooth
curving pathway, very much worn,
it seemed, more by time than human
feet.

  It was not yet noon. I waited a
few minutes to rest, then walked up
the path with keen curiosity as to
where it led. It grew so deep that
the sky overhead was but a dark
blue ribbon in which I saw Venus
gleaming whitely. It widened. I
walked out on a broad stone plat-
form. And below me lay—the abyss.

  I stood on the brink of a great
chasm whose bottom must have been
miles below sea level. The farther
walls of the circular pit—they must
have been forty miles away—were
still black in the shadow of the morn-
ing. Clouds of red and purple mist
hung in the infinities of space the
chasm contained and completely hid
the farther half of the floor.

  Beneath me, so far away that it
might have been on another world,
was a deep red shelf, a scarlet plain
as weird as the deserts of Mars. To
what it owed its color I could not
tell. In the midst of the red, rose
a mountain whose summit was a
strange crown of scintillating fire.
It looked as though it were capped

not with snow but with an immense
heap of precious jewels, set on fire
with the glory of the sun and blazing
with a splendorous shifting flame
of prismatic light.

  And the crimson upland sloped
down—to the “Silver Lake.” It was
a lake shaped like a crescent moon,
its horns reaching to the mountains
on the north and the south. In the
hollow of the crescent beyond, low
hills rose, impenetrable banks of
purple mist lying back of them to the
dark wall in the distance.

  The lake gleamed like quicksilver
and light waves ran upon it, reflect-
ing the sunlight in cold blue fire. It
seemed that faint purple vapors
were floating up from the surface.
Set like a picture in the dark red
landscape with the black cliffs about,
the argent lake was very white,
very bright.

CHAPTER II
Down the Silver Ladder

FOR a long, time I gazed into the
abyss, lost in the wonder and the
mystery of it. Meanwhile the sun
climbed over and lit the farther rim,
which still was black or dully red,
because of the dark colors of the
volcanic rocks of which it is com-
posed. The scene was so vast, so
strange, so wildly beautiful and un-
earthly that it seemed almost a
dream instead of an ominous reality.

  It was hard to realize that some-
where upon the red plain or along
the shores of the Silver Lake or per-
haps beneath the banks of mist be-
yond, Austen was—or had been—
alone and in distress. I wondered too
from what part of this strange world
had come the thing of the whistling
sound and the red light, which had
taken the ponies.

  It was well after noon before I
ate a little lunch and took thought
120	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

of the matter of descent. I saw that
a second ladder led down in a fine
thread of silver until it disappeared
above the crimson upland, miles be-
low. I climbed over the brink and
started down.

  Descending was easier than climb-
ing had been but I had infinitely
farther to go. The soles of my shoes
were cut through and my hands be-
came red and blistered on the rungs.
Sometimes, when I was too tired to
go on, I slung myself to the ladder
with a piece of rope from my pack
and rested.

  Steadily the black walls rose
higher before me. The red plateau
beneath, the mountain with its
crown of flaming gems, the strange
white lake beyond, came nearer and
nearer. I was still half a mile above
the scarlet plain when the shadow
of the western wall was flung fast
over the valley floor and the light
purple mists beyond the argent lake
deepened their hue to a dark and
ominous purple-red.

  But the Silver Lake did not
darken. It seemed luminous. It
gleamed with a bright metallic
silvery luster, even when the shadow
had fallen upon it. Whenever I
rested I searched keenly the whole
visible floor of the abyss but no-
where was any life or motion to be
seen.

  With growing apprehension I real-
ized that I would not have time to
reach the ground before dark. I
had no desire to be stuck like a fly to
the face of the cliff when the Thing
that had made the red light was mov-
ing about.

  Disregarding my fatigue and pain,
I clambered down as fast as I could
force my wearied limbs to move.
The process of motion had become
almost automatic. Hands and feet
moved regularly, rhythmically, with-
out orders from the brain. But
sometimes they fumbled or slipped.
Then I had to grasp in frenzy at the
rungs to save my life.

  Night fell like a black curtain

rolled quickly over the top of the
pit but the half-moon of the Silver
Lake still shone with its white
metallic light. And strange moving
shapes of red appeared in the mist in
the hollow of the crescent. The light
that fell upon the rock was faint but
enough to help and still I hurried—
forcing hands and feet to follow
down and find the rungs. Fearfully
I looked over my shoulder at the
bank of mist.

  Suddenly a long pale finger of
red—a delicate rosy ray—shot high
out of it. Up the vague pathway it
sped, a long slender pencil of crim-
son light—a narrow sharp-tipped
scarlet shape—high into the night,
and over and around in a long arch-
ing curve. Down it plunged and back
into the mist.

  Presently I heard its sound—that
strange whistling sigh that rolled
majestically and rose and fell, vast
as the roar of an erupting volcano.
Other things sprang out of the
purple bank, slender searching
needles of brilliant scarlet, sweeping
over the valley and high into the
starlit sky above.

  Following paths that were smooth
and arched with incredible speed
they swept about like a swarm of
strange insects, always with amaz-
ing ease and always shooting back
into the cloud, leaving faint purple
tracks behind them. And the great
rushing sounds rose and fell. Those
lights were incredible entities, in-
telligent—and evil.

  They flew more often than any-
where else over the crown of lights
upon the hill—the gems still shone
with a faint beautiful glow of
mingled colors. Whenever one
swept near the mountain a pale blue
ray shot toward it from the cap of
jewels. And the red things fled
from the ray.

  More and more the flying things
of crimson were drawn to the moun-
taintop, wheeling swiftly and cease-
lessly, ever evading the feeble beams
of blue. Their persistence was in-
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE	121

human—and terrible. They were
like insects wheeling about a light.

ALL the while I climbed down as
fast as I could, driving my worn-
out limbs beyond the limit of en-
durance, while I prayed that the
things might not observe me. Then
one passed within a half mile, with
a deep awful whistling roar, fling-
ing ahead its dusky red pathway and
hurtling along with a velocity that
is inconceivable.

  I saw that it was a great red bodv,
a cylinder with tapering ends, with
a bright green light shining on the
forward part. It did not pause but
swept on along its comet-like path,
and down behind the Silver Lake.
Behind it was left a vague purple
phosphorescent track, like the path
of a meteor, that lasted several
minutes.

  After it was gone I hurried on
for a few minutes, breathing easier.
Then another went by, so close that
a hot wind, laden with the purple
mist of its track, blew against my
face.

  I was gripped with unutterable
terror. I let myself down in the
haste of desperation. Then the third
one came. As it approached it
paused in its path and drifted slowly
and deliberately toward me. The
very cliff trembled with the roaring
blast of its sound. The green light
in the forward end stared at me
like a terrible evil eye.

  Exactly how it happened I never
knew. I suppose my foot slipped or
my bleeding hands failed to grasp
a rung. I have a vague recollection
of the nightmare sensation of fall-
ing headlong, of the air whistling
briefly about my ears, of the dark
earth looming up below. I think I
fell on my back and that my head
struck a rock.

  The next I knew it was day and
the Sun was shining in my eyes. I
struggled awkwardly and painfully
to my feet. My whole body was
bruised and sore and the back of my

head was caked with dried blood.
My exhausted muscles had stiffened
during the night and to stand upon
my cut and blistered feet was tor-
turing. But I had something to be
thankful for—I had been within a
few feet of the ground when I fell
—and the red thing had departed
and left me lying there, perhaps
thinking me dead.

  I leaned against the base of the
metal ladder and looked about. I
had fallen into a thicket of low red
bushes. All around grew low thick
brush, covering the slightly rolling
plain. The plants were scarcely
knee-high, bearing narrow feathered
leaves of red.

  Their delicate fern-like sprays of
crimson rippled in the breeze like
waves on a sea of blood. The leaves
had a peculiar bright and greasy
appearance and a strange pungent
odor. The shrubs bore innumerable
tiny snow-white flowers that
gleamed like stars against the deep
red background.

  I think that the red vegetation
must have evolved from a species
of cycad. Undoubtedly the greater
crater had been isolated from the
outer world when the great tree-
ferns were reigning throughout the
earth. And, as I was presently to
find, the order of evolution in the
deep warm pit had been vastly dif-
ferent from that which had pro-
duced man as its highest form of life.

  Presently I was to meet far
stranger and njore amazing things
than the red bush. I am inclined to
believe that the extraordinary color
may have been due to the quality
of the atmosphere, perhaps to the
high pressure or to the purple vapors
that ever rose from the region be-
yond the Silver Lake.

  Nowhere did I see any living thing
nor did I hear any sound of life.
In fact one of the strange things
of the place was the complete ab-
sence of the lower forms of life,
even of the smaller insects. The
silence hung oppressively. It grew
121	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

intolerably monotonous—madden-
ing.

  Far away to the right and left the
walls of the pit rose straight and
black toward the azure infinity that
arched the top. To my left, five or
six miles away, towered the gem-
covered hill, its summit a blaze of
ever-changing polychromatic flame.
Beyond it, all along the east, the red
plateau fell away to the Silver Lake,
which lay like a curved scimitar of
polished steel, the faint bank of
purple mist shrouding the low red
hills that rose inside the curve be-
yond. The Sun was just above the
eastern peaks, shining purple
through the mist.

  After a time I limped slowly down
the nearest of the little valleys. As
I went my roving eye caught the
bright glitter of brass on the ground
at my feet. Searching in the red
shrubs I picked up three fired
cartridges from a .45 calibre auto-
matic.

  I held them in my hand and gazed
over the weird scene before me, lost
in wonder. They were concrete
proof that Austen had passed this
way, had here fought off some
danger. He must yet be somewhere
in this strange crater. But wThere
was I to find “Melvar, maiden of
the crystal city”—and what was she
to do for me?

  Presently I went on. I wanted
water to bathe my cuts and bruises.
I was very thirsty as well as hun-
gry. My pack was an irksome
burden but I did not discard it and
I carried the heavy rifle ready in my
hand. I was still feeling very weak.
After a painful half mile I came to a
tiny pool in a thicket of the red
scrub. I lay down and drank the cool
clear water until I was half sick. I
threw away the remnants of my
shoes and bathed my feet.

SUDDENLY my attention was ar-
rested by a crystal clashing
sound. There was a marching
rhythm in it and the clatter of

weapons. 1 crouched down the
shrubbery and peered fearfully
about. I saw a line of men, queerly
equipped soldiers, marching in single
file over the nearest knoll.

  They seemed to be wearing a
closely fitting chain mail of silvery
metal and they had helmets, breast-
plates and shields that threw off
the sunlight in scintillant flashes of
red, as if made of rubies. Their long
swords flashed like diamonds. Their
crystal armor tinkled as they came,
in time to their marching feet.

  ' One, whom I took to be the leader,
boomed out an order in a hearty
mellow voice. They passed straight
by within fifty yards of me. I saw
that they were tall men of magnifi-
cent physique, white-skinned with
blond hair and blue eyes. On they
went in the direction of the fire-
topped mountain until they passed
out of sight in a slight declivity
and their music died away.

  It is needless to say that I was ex-
cited as by nothing that I had seen
before. A race of fair-haired men
in an Australian valley—what a
sensational discovery! I supposed
that they had built the metal ladder
and come down it into the valley—
but from whence had they come? Or
was the Mountain of the Moon itself
the cradle of humanity, the Garden
of Eden?

  Then the weapons of the soldiery
suggested that they used some trans-
parent crystalline substance in lieu
of metal, that the iridescent crown
upon the mountain might be the city
of the race. Was it Austen’s “Crys-
tal City?” That would suggest a high
civilization but I saw no sign of the
mechanical devices that are the out-
standing features of our own civi-
lized achievement. Certainly the
soldiers had carried no modern arms.

  Then I thought of the footprints
and the eerie laugh. I wondered
what contact Austen had had with
these people. Had they been friends
or foes? I wondered if it had been
the men of the Crystal City who had
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE

123

  paid me a visit outside the cliffs.
  If so the red torpedo-shapes of the
  night must be aircraft and they must
  have advanced the art of aerial
  navigation to a very high and sig-
  _ nificant degree.

    I determined first of all to do
  some spying to find out as much as
  possible about the strange race be-
  fore I revealed my presence. I was
  not in a very good trim for battle
  and I had taken much pains for con-
  cealment when the men passed. But
  I had little doubt that my guns
  were so far superior to their crystal
  swords that I could fight them at any
  odds if they should prove to be un-
  friendly.

    So presently I bound my feet with
  bandages from my medicine kit, at-
  tended as best I could to the wound
  on the back of my head and walked
  slowly on in the direction of the
  mountain, keeping in the cover of
  the valleys as much as possible. Al-
  though I could limp nainfully along,
  the red vegetation offered no serious
  impediment to my progress.

  THE low bushes crushed easily un-
  derfoot, burdening the air with
  their unfamiliar pungent odor. The
  country was rolling, the low hills and
  level valleys all covered crimson
  with the scrub, gigantic boulders
  scattered here and there.

    The Silver Lake shimmered in the
  distance—a bright white metallic
  sheet.

    The gem-capped mountain rose be-
  fore me until I saw that the gaunt
  black sides rose a full thousand
  feet to the crown of blazing crystal.
  And as I drew nearer I saw that

  *	indeed the gems were buildings of
  a massive, fantastic architecture.

    A city of crystal! Prismatic fires
  of emerald-green and ruby-red and
  sapphire-blue poured out in a
  mingled flood of iridescence from its
  slender spires and great towers, its
  central ruby dome and the circling
  battlements of a hundred flashing
  hues.

CHAPTER III
Melvar of Astran

JUST before noon I staggered into
a little dell that was covered with
unusually profuse growths of the
crimson plants. Along a little trick-
ling stream of water they were waist
high, bearing abundantly the star-
shaped flowers and small golden-
brown fruits.

  Suddenly there was a rustling in
the thicket and the head and shoul-
ders of a young woman rose abruptly
out of the red brush. In her hand
she held a woven basket, half full
of the fruits. In my alarm I had
thrown up the rifle. But I soon
lowered it and grinned in confusion
when I realized that it was a girl,
by far the most beautiful I had ever
seen.

  I	have always been awkward in
the presence of a beautiful woman
and for a few minutes I did noth-
ing but stand and stare at her while
her quizzical dark blue eyes in-
scrutably returned my look.

  She was clad in a slight garment,
green in color, that seemed to be
woven of a fine-spun metal. Her
hair was long and golden, fastened
behind her shapely head with a cir-
clet—a thin band cut evidently from
a single monster ruby. Her features
were fine and delicate and she had a
surpassing grace of figure.

  That her slender arms were
stained to the elbows with the red
juice of the plants—she had been
picking the golden fruits—did not
detract from her beauty. I was
struck—and, I admit, conquered—by
her face. For a little time she stood
very erect, looking at me with an
odd expression and then she spoke,
enunciating the words very care-
fully, in a rich golden voice.

  The language was English!

  She said, “Are you—American ?M
124	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

  "At your service,” I told her,
“Winfield Fowler of White Deer,
Texas, and New York City, not to
mention other points. But I own
to some surprise at finding a knowl-
edge of the idiom in a denizen of so
remote a locality.”

  “I can understand,” she smiled.
“But I think you could talk—more
simply. So you are Winfield, who
came with Austen across the great
—ocean from America?”

  “You guessed it,” I said, trying
to keep my growing excitement in
hand while I marveled at her beauty.
“Is mind reading common in these
parts?”

  “Doctor Austen—the American—
told me about you, his friend. And
he gave me two books—Tennyson’s
poems and—‘The Pathfinder.’ ”

  “So you have seen Austen?” I
cried in real astonishment. “Are
you Melvar? Are you the ‘maiden
of the crystal city?’ ”

  “I am Melvar,” she told me. “And
Austen stopped in Astran one sutar
—that is thirty-six days.”

  “Where is he now?” I eagerly de-
manded.

  “He was a strange man,” the
golden voice replied. “He did not
fear the Krimlu, as do the men of
Astran. He walked off toward the
pass in the north that leads around
—around the Silver Lake, he called
it. He had been watching the Krimlu
as they came at night and doing
strange things with some stuff he
took from the Silver Lake.

  “While he was here the hunters
brought in one of the”—again she
hesitated, at a loss for a word—
“the Purple Ones,” she concluded.
“He took that to examine it.”

  “What are the Krimlu?” I ex-
claimed. “What—or who—are the
urple Ones? What is the Silver
ake?”

  “You are a man of many ques-
tions,” she laughed. For a moment
she hesitated, her blue eyes rest-
ing on my face.

  “The Krimlu, so say the old men

of Astran, are the spirits of the
dead who come back from the land
beyond the Silver Lake to watch
the living and to carry off the evil
for their food. So the priests taught
us and so I believed until Austen
came and told me of the world that
is beyond.

  “He told the Elders of the outer
world but they put upon him the
curse of the Sun and drove him
away. And indeed it is well that he
was ready to go so willingly beyond
the Silver Lake, for Jorak would
have offered him to the Purple Sun
had he been in the city another
night.”

  Suddenly she must have become
conscious of the intensity of my un-
thinking gaze, for she abruptly
dropped her eyes and flushed a little.

  “Go on,” I urged. “What about
the Purple Ones and the Silver
Lake? Your account is certainly en-
tertaining, if somewhat more mysti-
fying than illuminating. At this
rate you will have me a raving
maniac in an hour but the process is
not unpleasant. Proceed.”

SHE looked up at me, smiled, looked
off to the side, then let her eyes
return to mine with curious specula-
tion in them. “What is the Silver
Lake?” she went on. “You know as
well as I, though Austen tried to find
its secret. The touch of its water
is death—a death that is terrible.

  “And the Purple Ones—you will
see them soon enough! They are
strange beings who come, no one
knows whence, into the land of
Astran. The priests tell us that they
are the avengers of the Purple Sun
—but did you come down the ladder
as Austen did?”

  “Most of the way in the same
manner,” I told her. “I finished the
descent rather faster than he did, I
imagine.”

  “Is there really,” she asked, “a
forests that are green and seas of
clear blue water and a sun that is
broad world beyond with fields and
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE	12S

not purple but white? Such Austen
told me but the Elders say that the
ladder is the path to the Purple
Sun and that beyond is nothing.

  “Is it true that there is a great
nation of the men of your race, a
nation of men who know the art of
fire that Austen showed us and
greater arts—who can travel in
ships over water and through the
air like the Krimlu?”

  “Yes,” I said, “the world is that
and more—but in all of it I have
never seen a girl as beautiful as
you."

  It is not my habit to make such
speeches to ladies but I was feeling
a bit light-headed that morning as
a reaction from my terrible adven-
ture—and I was rather intoxicated
by her charm.

  She smiled, evidently not dis-
pleased, and looked away again,
composing her expression with dif-
ficulty. There was a suspicious
twinkle in her dark blue eyes.

  “Tell me why you have come into
this land,” she asked abruptly.

  “Austen sent for me to come to
his aid,” I replied.

  “You and Austen are not like the
men of Astran,” she mused. “Not
one of them ever went out to face
the Krimlu or even the Purple Ones
of his own free will. You must be
brave.”

  “Say ignorant,” I said. “Since I
have seen the ‘Krimlu,’ as you call
the flying lights, I am about ready
to give up courage of any kind.”

  Then, because my exhausted con-
dition had robbed me of my ordi-
nary sense of responsibility, I did
such a thing as I had never dared
before. The giii was standing close
before me, matchlessly beautiful,
infinitely desirable. Her eyes were
bright, and the sunlight glistened
in her golden hair.

  And—well, I admit that I did not
try very hard to resist the tempta-
tion to kiss her. I felt her arm at
my back, a sudden quick thrust
of her lithe body. The next I knew

I was lying on my back and she was
bending over me with tears in her
eyes.

  “Oh!” she cried. “I didn’t know.
Your head! It is bleeding. And your
hands and feet! I didn't notice!”

  So I was compelled to lie there
while the beautiful stranger very
tenderly dressed apd bandaged the
cut on my head. In truth I doubt
that I would have been able to get
up immediately. The touch of her
cool fingers was very light and deft;.
Once her golden hair brushed
against my cheek. Her nearness was
very pleasant. I knew that I loved
her completely though I had never
taken much stock in love at first
sight.

  Presently she had finished. Then
she said, “When Austen gave me the
books he left a letter for any man
of the outside who might happen
to come to Astran. You might come
with me to the city to get it—and
to rest until you can walk without
limping so painfully.

  “Then, if you will, you can find
Austen. But the Krimlu are mighty.
No man of Astran has ever dared
oppose them. No man who has ever
gone into that accursed region has
ever been seen again.”

CHAPTER IV
Astran, the Crystal City

THE sun dropped beneath the rim
and the purple dusk began to
thicken and creep over the valley
floor. I took up my precious equip-
ment and Melvar and I walked off
through the red brush in the direc-
tion of the mountain. The vast
strange buildings of the city of gems
were still glowing with soft color
and the cold bright surface of the
Silver Lake flashed often into sight
beyond the rolling eminences.

  Presently we came to a well-worn
126	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

path through the crimson scrub but
I saw nothing to indicate that any-
one had thought of paving or im-
proving it. The Astranians did not
seem to have much energy for any
kind of public work. Their material
civilization appeared to be on a
rather low scale. In fact they sup-
plied their wants in the way of food
entirely with the abundant fruit of
the red bushes.

  As I had guessed from the girl’s
remarks they did not have even the
use of fire. Indeed the great physi-
cal and mental development of the
race and the splendid city in which
it lived were strangely contrasted
with their absolute lack of scientif-
ic knowledge.

 Our pace was hastened b y
thoughts of the terrors the night
would bring. Perhaps because of
them we walked nearer to one an-
other and presently we were hurry-
ing along hand in hand. About us
the purple night deepened and be-
yond the argent brilliance of the
Silver Sea the strange evil of the
darkness gathered itself for the
attack.

  At last we came to the narrow
path that wound up the side of the
mountain to the splendid palaces
that crowned it. We hurried, came
to a great arched gate in the emerald
wall, and entered. The huge and in-
credibly magnificent buildings were
scattered irregularly about the sum-
mit with broad spaces between them.

  Here and there were paved courts
of the silvery metal, which must
have been an aluminum bronze, but
the open ground was for the most
part grown up in rank thickets of
the red brush. The great buildings
showed the wear and breakage of
ages. Here and there were great
heaps of gleaming crystal, where
wonderful edifices had fallen with
the brush grown up around them.

  Incredible as it may seem I think
the old civilization of Astran had
possessed a science that was able to
synthesize diamonds and other pre-

cious stones in quantities sufficient
even for use as building stones.
Later I had opportunity to examine
bits of the fallen masonry.

  Towering above all, on the very
peak of the mountain, was a great
ruby dome, vast as the dome of St.
Peter’s. Mounted upon the center of
the top was a huge machine that re-
sembled nothing so much as a great
naval gun though it was made of
crystal and white metal.

  A little group of men were
gathered about it and as I watched
they swung the great tube about
and a narrow ray of pale blue light
poured out of it. Down on the plain
below, where the practise beam had
struck, a great boulder flashed into
sudden incandescence.

  In their exploration of the ultra-
violet spectrum our own scientists
have found rays that are strangely
destructive to life and considerable
progress has been made in the de-
velopment of a destructive beam of
wireless energy. But later I was to
meet a far more terrible ray weapon
than that slender blue beam.

  “With that,” said Melvar, “our
people fight off the Krimlu at night.
But the Krimlu are so many that
sometimes they are able to land
and take our people. If only we
had more of the beams!

  “But there is no man in all Astran
who knows how the light is made—
or anything save that the blue light
shines out to destroy when rock of a
certain kind is put into the tube.
Austen wished to examine it and
spoke of something he called ‘radium
ore’ but the priests forbade. Indeed,
his curiosity is one of the reasons
Jorak had for driving him away.”

  Standing about the ill-kept streets
were a few of the people of the
crystal city. All were of magnificent
physique and intelligent looking,
white-skinned and fair haired. All
wore garments that seemed of spun
metal and bore gleaming crystal
weapons.

  Most of them were hurrying along,
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE

127

intent on affairs of their own, but
a few gathered around us almost as
soon as we stepped in the gate. I felt
that they were hostile to me. They
questioned Melvar in a tongue that
was strange to my ears—then be-
came engaged in a noisy debate
among themselves. Their glances
toward me were furtive and sullen
and their eyes had the look of men
crazed by fear.

MELVAR was saying something
in a conciliatory tone and I was
swinging my rifle into position for
use when there was a sudden shout
from the gate of the city and. the
clashing of crystal weapons. The
interruption was most welcome to
me. The crowd turned eagerly to
the new arrivals.

  I saw that they were a band of
soldiers, possibly the same that had
passed me in the morning. Slung to
a pole carried between the foremost
two was a strange thing. Weirdly
colored and fearfully mutilated as
it was I saw that it was the naked
body of a human being.

  The head was cut half off and
dangling at a grotesque angle. The
hair was very long and very white,
flying in loose disorder. The features
were withered and wrinkled, indeed
the whole form was incredibly ema-
ciated. It was the corpse of a woman.
The flesh was deep purple!

  As I stood staring at the thing in
horror there was laughter and cheer-
ing in the crowd and a little child
ran up to stab at the thing with a
miniature diamond sword. Melvar
touched my arm.

  “Come quickly/’ she whispered.
“The people do not like your coming.
They did not like the things Austen
told of the world outside, for the
priests teach that there is no such
world. It is well that the hunters
came when they did with the Purple
One. And let us hope that the priests
of the Purple Sun do not hear of
you.”

  As she spoke she steered me rapid-

ly away through a tangle of the red
brush and through a colonnade of
polished sapphire. Then she quickly
led the way along a deserted alley,
across another patch of the red
shrubbery and down a short flight
of steps into a chamber that was
dark.

  “Wait here,” she commanded. “I
must leave you. I think that Jorak
has had spies upon me and if I were
too long absent he might grow sus-
picious. He was the enemy of mv
father and some day my brother will
slay him. Sometimes I am afraid of
the way he looks at me.

  “However there is no danger now.
If the priests hear, I will somehow
get you out of Astran. I think they
will not seek you here, whatever may
happen. My brother will bring the
message from Austen and food and
drink. May you rest well and have
faith in me!”

  She ran up the steps and left me
standing in the darkness in a state
of uncomfortable indecision. I did
not like the turn that affairs had
taken.

  It is never pleasant to be alone
in the dark in a strange and dan-
gerous place.

  I would have much preferred to
take my chances out on the open
plain with nothing but the moving
lights to fear, terrible as they were,
than here in this strange city, full
of ill-disposed savages.

  A diamond knife will kill a man
just as effectively and completely
as the weirdest death that ever
roamed the night.

   For a time I stood waiting tensely,
my rifle in my hand, but I was very
tired and weak. Presently I got out
my flashlight and examined the
place. It was a little cell, apparently
hewn in the living rock of the moun-
tain. There was nothing in the way
of furniture except a sort of padded
shelf or bed at the back. I sat down
upon it and presently went to sleep
there, though I had no intention of
doing so.
128	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

THE next I knew someone was
shaking my arm and shouting
strange words in my ear. I opened
my eyes. Standing before me was a
young man. In one hand he held a
crystal globe, filled with a glowing
phosphorescent stuff, faintly light-
ing the little apartment. I sat up
slowly, for my limbs were stiff. The
gun was still in my hand.

  Without saying anything more the
young fellow pointed to a tray that
he had set by me on the shelf. It
contained a crystal pitcher of aro-
matic liquid and a dash of the yellow
fruit. I gulped down some of the
drink and ate a few of the fruits,
feeling refreshed almost immediate-
ly.

  Then the boy—he was not more
than sixteen years of age—thrust
into my hand an envelope addressed
in the familiar handwriting of
Austen. He handed me the light and
walked up the stone stairs.

  With feeling that well may be
imagined I tore open the envelope
and read, in the faint light of the
glowing bulb, the words of my old
friend.

  To whomsoever of my own race
this may be delivered—

  Since you must so far have trav-
eled the mysterious dangers of this
strange world it is needless for me
to dwell upon them. I write this brief
missive for the information of any-
one who shall happen to find the
way here in the future and, in order
that the riddle of my own disappear-
ance may some time be cleared up
if I fail to return. For I intend to
explore the region beyond this lake—
I call it the Silver Lake—or to lose
my life in the attempt.'

  My name is Horace Austen. I came
to the Great Victoria Desert to in-
vestigate the sculptured columns re-
ported by Hamilton, far to the west
of here. I found the ruins and in-
credibly ancient they are. They must
date from fifty thousand years ago
at the latest.

  Among them was an amazing pic-
tographical record of a race'of men,
driven by the drying up of their
country to emigrate to the crater of
a great mountain nearby. There was
no mistaking the meaning. I was, of
course, intensely interested, for
nothing of the kind had ever been
reported in Australia and certainly
the people depicted were not Bush-
men.

  It happened that I remembered
Wellington’s account of the Moun-
tain of the Moon, whose northern
cliff was followed for a few miles
by his route of 1887. That appeared
to be the best chance for the great
crater described on the columns. It
was but natural for me to decide
to investigate it. There is no use for
me to dwell upon my hardships but.
the last of my water was drunk when
I found the ladder, which was lo-
cated just as the inscriptions indi-
cated.

  I reached the red plain without
accident and found the fruit of the
strange vegetation a palatable and
nourishing food. So far I have
escaped the red lights that haunt
the night and it is their mystery
that I am determined to solve. I
went down to the metallic lake and
investigated it.

  I confess myself quite unable to
account either for the nature or for
the incredible origin of the fluid.
With proper precaution it can be
studied without great difficulty but
since I am almost entirely without
apparatus I have learned little
enough about it.

  I had been in the crater a week
when I decided to approach the city
of jewels on the mountain. I have
been in Astran over a month but on
account of the savagery and igno-
rance of the people and the oppres-
sive rule of the priesthood I have not
been on very friendly relations with
Melvar, who seems far above the
others of her race and who has been
my friend from the first,
them—with, the exception of the girl,
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE	129

  I have been able to learn but little
from them, although I have acquired
a fair knowledge of the language.
My instructor, the beautiful Melvar,
is showing a keen desire to learn
English, of which she is gaining
command with remarkable speed.

  She is developing as well an in-
satiable curiosity about the outer
world.

  The sentiment against me has been
ever running higher and tomorrow
1 shall leave the crystal city and, en-
deavor to round.I the sea in the north
and to reach the mist-veiled land
beyond. My only regret in leaving is
that I shall see Melvar no more. I
wish there were some way to secure
for her the advantages of a civilized
education.

  These may be. my last words to
the world, if indeed they ever come
into the hands of a civilized man.
But I know that sooner or later the
crater will be discovered and, en-
tered. My chief purpose in writing
this, aside from the satisfaction of
leaving an account of my own do-
ings, is to state my firm belief, I may
say my certain knowledge, that the
strange things that may be observed
here, supernatural or incredible as
they may appear, result from per-
fectly natural forces in the control
of a civilized power that may not be
much above our own advancements.

               Horace Austen.

CHAPTER V
Fowler Recovers

T READ it in the faint glow of the
A phosphorescent globe, then read
it again. So Austen was beyond the
crescent if he had been able to carry
out his plan. The date of the letter
was ten months back. Then the radio
message had probably come from
the other side. And why had it been
sent?

  Austen was not one to appeal for
aid for himself alone. Had he feared
some general danger to the human
race? I thought of his phrase “for
the sake of mankind" and shuddered
at a picture of the red lights sweeps
ing like destroying angels over a
great city like New York, decimat-
ing the terrorized population.

  I tried to think what was best for
me to do if ever I got out of Astran
alive. I supposed that Austen had
been able to round the Silver Lake in
the north. I should be ab!e to follow
him. Clearly there was nothing for
me to do but to find out as much
about this strange world as possible
and to get the equipment to him as
soon as I could do so.

  I stayed in the cellar-like home for
a week. Twice each day the young
chap came to bring food and drink.
He knew but a few words of English
and during the hour or so he stayed
each time I had him try teaching me
the language of Astran. But my
progress was slow, and I never
learned more than a few score
words. The language seemed much
more complex than English, with
bewildering rules of inflection.

  But I developed quite a liking for
the boy. He had a simple straight-
forward manner and a good sense of
humor. His name was Naro. He was
the brother of Melvar and was two
years younger. Their father, it
seemed, had been carried off several
years before when the flying lights
made a great raid and the mother
had soon after fallen a victim to th e
sacrificial rites of the hated Jorak.

  The boy himself bore the scars of
wounds he had suffered a few
months earlier in a terrific battle
with one of the Purple Ones, as
those monsters were called, which so
mystified me then and with which I
had such terrible experiences later.

  On the second day Melvar came.
She brought a great flask of aro-
matic oil that she poured over my
wounds. It must have been remark-
ably healing for in a few days I
130	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

found myself entirely recovered. Be-
fore she left she told me that the
priests had heard of my arrival and
that it was whispered among the
people that I was a supernatural
being, sent as an omen of an attack
by the Krimlu.

  She told me too that there was
talk of a sacrifice soon to be offered
at the altar of the Purple Sun to
appease the angry Spirits of the
dead. Sweet and innocent child, she
seemed to have no fear that she,
who had brought me into the city,
would be the sacrifice. I did nothing
to let her know my misgivings al-
though I did propose that we leave
the city together as soon as possible.
How I hated to see her leave the
apartment!

  During the following days I
questioned Naro constantly as to the
doings of his sister and of the As-
tranians. But I was able to elicit
no very satisfactory information ex-
cept that none of the Krimlu had
been seen for several days and that
the headmen of the nation were be-
ginning to expect a raid in force.

  Also I persuaded him to keep a
very close watch on the movements
of Melvar and to come to me at once
if Jorak made any attempt to get
her into his power or if the sacrificial
ceremony was begun with the vic-
tim unselected.

  During the interminable periods
when I was alone I was driven al-
most insane by the monotony and
anxiety of my existence. But I had
my scientific equipment and I had
the boy bring me a few assorted
fragments of the crystal building
stones, which I tested and found to
be real gems of several varieties.
Many gems are simple enough in
chemical formula and composed of
the most common elements, so the
synthesis of them by scientific means
is not unreasonable.

  For example it is a well-known
fact that diamond is just a crystal
form of carbon, which element oc-
curs in three allotropic forms. Those

three forms are diamond, graphite—
which also crystallizes—and amor-
phous carbon, of which charcoal is
a form. Since carbon occurs in the
air in carbon dioxide it is not im-
possible that latterday science should
be able to manufacture diamonds
from the air.

  Sapphires are aluminum oxide or
alumina, colored with a little cobalt,
and rubies are composed of the same
oxide with a trace of chromium, to
which the color is due. A clay-bed
would supply an inexhaustible
amount of the elements needed for
the synthesis of these gems and I
think the people of old Astran had
been able to accomplish it.

  I examined the little glow-lamp too
and found it to be simply a crystal
bottle filled with the moist crushed
leaves of the red plants, which
formed a culture of some kind of
luminous bacteria.

ON THE seventh night, when the
pale ray of daylight that filtered
down into my hiding place was
dimmed, Naro burst into the cham-
ber, panting and wild-eyed with ter-
ror. His crystal sword was gone,
his metallic mangle was torn and
blood was falling drop by drop from
a deep scratch on his arm.

  He thrust into my hand a tattered
scrap of paper, evidently the flyleaf
of a book. On it, in an ink that I
took at first to be blood although
it was probably the juice of the red
plants, the following words were
formed in hastily drawn printing
characters—

  Winfield, There is no hope. The
priests will offer a gift to the Purple
Sun. I am the victim. Already I
am in the hands of Jorak. I am
sorry, f or I loved you. It may be that
I can give this to Naro, who will take
it to you.

  The Krimlu are coming tonight.
Already their lights flicker above the
mist. In the morning my brother
will take you to the gate and you
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE	131

may escape. If only it had been one
night later ive might have all been
away together. Farewell.

                      Melvar.

  No time was to be lost. I had been
anticipating something of the kind.
My guns were cleaned and loaded.
My pack was soon ready. Naro took
a part of my equipment. I followed
the boy up the stair with the phrase
“for I loved you” ringing in my
heart.

  We reached the top and walked out
into the red brush. Beneath the pur-
ple starlight the vast fantastic col-
umned halls of Astran were gleam-
ing faintly. I caught a brief blue
flicker from the great machine on
the ruby dome.

  Suddenly, with a sharp thrill of
terror that made me catch my
breath, I heard a distant whining
sigh that grew until it rolled and
reverberated through the heavens
and the air seemed alive with its
deep intensity. Above the emerald
wall I glimpsed the green-tipped
needle of crimson that made the
sound.

  It was sweeping through the sky,
meteor-swift, while the pale blue
beam stabbed out at it ineffectually.
It passed in an instant but others
came and soon the sky was lighted
with the weird red radiance. The
very mountaintop vibrated with the
whistling roars. The things swept
around and around in a mad confu-
sion of darting flames. They were
like moths about a candle. *

  We passed an amber palace and
came suddenly upon a great metal-
floored court. Marching across it
were a half-score of the Astranian
men-at-arms, their accoutrements
gleaming weirdly in the light of the
strange things above. They saw us
at once, and charged upon us with a *
shout.

  I dropped to my knees. Once my
rifle spoke and I rejoiced at its heavy
thrust against my shoulder and the
acrid odor of the smoke. I felt a

man again. And the leader of the
soldiers fell upon his face.

  Naro gripped my shoulder and
pointed upward. One of the red
things was plunging down like a
great red Zeppelin with a great
green light at its forward end, its
purple phosphorescent track swirl-
ing up behind it. The soldiers forgot
us and scattered in mad terror. Naro
jerked my arm and we tumbled into
a copse of the red brush.

  For a moment the bloody radiance
was thrown upon us in an intense
flood and the screaming roar was
deafening. A few moments more and
the thing had flashed up and away.
A breath of hot purple mist passed
over us. When we got to our feet
and crept out of the thicket the sol-
diers were gone.

  Swiftly Naro led me on. keeping
in the shadows of the buildings or
in the cover of the thickets. Once a
man sprang suddenly at us from be-
hind a sapphire pillar, diamond
sword drawn. My pistol exploded in
his face and blew his head half off.

  Naro possessed himself of the dead
man’s weapons and we went breath-
lessly on. Three times in other parts
of the city we saw the red shapes
drop to the ground briefly, then dart
up again while ever the blue ray
played back and forth upon them.

AT LAST we passed between vast
ruby columns and stood beneath
the huge red dome. Before us lay
a great space, fairly lit with a rosy
light from the crystal walls. Around
the farther side were seated, tier
upon tier, thousands of the brilliant-
ly clad people of Astran.

  In the center of the great floor,
resting upon a pedestal, was a globe
of shining purple—a sphere of cor-
uscating flame—itself immense, per-
haps forty feet in diameter, but in-
significant in that colossal hall.
Standing at rigid attention in regu-
lar rows about the pedestal were a
few score bright-armed soldiers and
as many other erect men in long
132

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

 purple robes. All eyes were fixed on
 a point in front of the gigantic globe
 hidden from where we stood.

   We hurried silently across the
 smooth metal floor, our footsteps
 drowned in the rushing sounds of
 the flying things above. We ran
 around the great purple sun-sphere
 of crystal and came abruptly upon a
 dramatically terrible scene. Beneath
 the sphere was an altar of glowing
 red with the priests and soldiery all
 grouped about it.

   By the altar, kneeling and silent,
 clad in a filmy green robe, was the
 beautiful form of Melvar. Just be-
 hind her stood a tall hawk-like man,
 in his hands a great transparent
 crystal vessel full of a liquid that
 gleamed like molten silver.

   As we came around the sphere he
 was holding up the vessel and re-
 peating a strange chant in a monot-
 onous monotone. At sight of us he
 dropped into alarmed silence, with
 an ugly scowl of hate and fear dis-
 torting his harsh features. For a
 moment he stood as if paralyzed,
 then he rushed toward the silent girl
 as though to empty the contents of
 the crystal pitcher upon her.

   I fired on the instant and had the
 luck to shatter the vessel, splashing
 the shining silvery fluid all over his
 person. The effect of it was instan-
 taneous and terrible. His purple robe
 was eaten away and set on fire by
 the stuff. His flesh was dyed a deep
 purple and partially consumed. He
 tottered and fell to the floor in a
 writhing flaming heap.

   In the confusion and dazed silence
 that fell upon the vast assemblage
 at sight of that horrible thing Mel-
 var, aroused from her resignation
 of despair by the report of the pistol,
 sprang to her feet in incredulous
 surprise. For a moment she looked
 / wonderingly at us. Then she turned
 and shouted a few strange and im-
 pressive words at the priests. Her
 white arms swept up in a curious
 gesture.

   She turned and sped toward us.

We started running back the way we
had come. The dramatic fall of
Jorak and the evident terror that
Melvar’s courageous and timely
words, whatever they were, had in-
spired served to hold the Astranians
motionless until we had traversed
the better part of the distance to
the columns.

  But then they started after us en
masse. I dropped to my knees by the
columns and began firing steadily
with the rifle. They.fell, sometimes
two or three at a shot, but still they
charged on and their number was
overwhelming.

  Then, outside, there was a sudden
louder shrieking roar. A flood of
red light poured through the col-
umns and there was a terrific crash
upon the dome. Dense clouds of hot
purple vapor poured into the vast
room. One of the flying: lights had
landed upon the roof. The charging
throng behind us stopped and ran
about in confusion.

  We darted out through the purple
clouds and ran for the shadow of
the nearest building. We kept close
by the mighty walls until we reached
the gate. Daring the terrors of the
night we ran out and down the nar-
row trail. By dawn we were several
miles from Astran in the direction
of the shining lake.

CHAPTER VI
The Silver Lake

AT THE coming of day we were
walking over a gently rolling
scarlet plain, scattered with gigantic
solitary boulders that sloped gradu-
ally down to the Silver Lake. The
lake lay flat and argent white, clad
in all the ominous mystery of that
strange world, calling, beckoning us
on, challenging us to learn the secret
of the farthest bank of purple fog
with a grim warning of the doom
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE	123

that might await us.

  The red fern-like sprays waved
gently in the breeze and the vivid
tiny white flowers seemed to sparkle
with a million glancing rays like
frost in the sunshine. But the deep
intensity of the red color lent a weird
and unpleasant suggestion of blood.
Beyond the Silver Lake low hills
rose, faint and mysterious in the
purple haze.

  Melvar walked beside me when
the way was smooth enough. She
was talking vivaciously. She had a
keen sense of humor and a lively wit.
She seemed to have an almost child-
ishly perfect faith in my power and
that of my guns—but I was far from
feeling confident.

  At sunrise we stopped by a little
pool of clear water.

  We drank and made a meal of the
abundant yellow fruit. Astran, with
the scintillating fires kindled again
in its jeweled towers by the rising
Sun, lay far behind and above us.
When we had finished eating Melvar
stood looking for a long moment at
its glorious sparkling light. She mur-
mured a few words beneath her
breath in the Astranian tongue and
turned again toward the Silver Lake.

  In two hours we came to the shore
of the great lake. The red scrub
grew up to the brink of a bluff a
dozen feet high. Below was a broad
bare sandy beach with the gleaming
waves, quicksilver white, rolling on
it two hundred yards away.

  For a few minutes we stood at
the edge of the cliff in the fringe of
crimson brush and let our eyes wan-
der over the vast flat desert of flow-
ing argent fire. We peered at the
misty red hills beyond, trying to
penetrate their mysteries and to
read what lay behind them. Then
we scrambled down on the hard
white sand. Naro grasped his weap-
on and looked up and down the
beach.

  “It is along the shore of the Silver
Lake,” Melvar said, “that the Purple
One's are most frequently found.”

  “The Purple Ones, again!” I cried.
“What are they—decorated rattle-
snakes?” Then, with a sickening sen-
sation of terror, I remembered the
horrible half-human purple corpse
that I had seen the soldiers bring-
ing into Astran. “Are the Purple
Ones men?”

  “In form they are men and wom-
en,” Melvar said, “but they dwell
alone in the thickets like beasts. All
of them are old and hideous. They
are savage and they each have the
strength of many men. Our soldiers
must always hunt them and fight
them to the death.

 “A single man, even though
armed, could do nothing against one
of them for they are terribly strong
and they fight like demons. Their
country is not known and no children
of their kind are ever found. The
priests say that they are of a race
of dwarfs that dwell beneath the
Silver Lake.”

  Here was another of the baffling
mysteries of this strange world. In
fact I was coming upon unpleasant
mysteries much faster than I could
comfortably stomach them. Lone
purple savage animals, in the form
of emaciated humans, who prowled
the country like wolves and like
wolves were hunted down by the
Astran ians!

  Again I shuddered at the memory
of the limp purple corpse the sol-
diers had carried and with a strange
chill of the heart, I remembered the
human footprints that had been left
where my ponies were taken in the
desert and the eerie insane laughter
that I had heard, or thought I heard,
above the whistling roar.

  My thoughts ended with the con-
struction of a mad hypothesis of a
race of purple folk who lived beyond
the Silver Lake, who were accus-
tomed to make slave raids on the
whites in torpedo-shaped airships
and who made a practise of releasing
or turning out the superannuated
ones of their kind to prey on the
people of the crystal city.
134

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

  It seemed, in fact, quite plausible
at the time but I was far from the
hideous truth. I could see no reason,
if one race could attain a civiliza-
tion high enough to synthesize dia-
monds for building - stone, why
another might not be able to build
ships as marvelous as the red tor-
pedoes. But my reason rebelled at
the acceptance of the ideas of de-
monic and supernatural horrors my
emotional self tried to force upon
it.

■QRESENTLY I roused myself and

 led the way down the white
waves. My companions held back
nervously and warned me not to
touch them lest I die as Jorak had.
But I succeeded in filling a test tube
with the stuff. It was not trans-
parent. It was white, gleaming,
metallic, like mercury or molten sil-
ver.

  I carried it back up to the bluff
and set about examining it while
Naro stood guard and Melvar
watched me. She asked innumerable
questions, concerning not only the
operation in hand but on such sub-
jects as the appearance of a cat and
Fifth Avenue styles of ladies’ gar-
ments. Upon which latter, however,
I was lamentably ignorant.

  So often did I pause to answer her
questions, to laugh at the naive
quaintness of her phrases or to let
my eyes rest on her charming face,
that the attempted analysis of the
metal did not progress with any re-
markable celerity.

  The silver liquid was very mobile
and very light, having a specific
gravity of only .25 or not even four
times that of liquid hydrogen, which
is .07. It was extremely corrosive.
Tiny bits of wood or paper were en-
tirely consumed on contact with it
with the liberation, apparently, of
carbon dioxide and water vapor and
a dense purple gas that I could not
identify.

That suggested, of course, that the
stuff contained oxygen but as to how

much or in what combination I had
no idea. A drop of it on a larger
piece of paper set it afire. I found
too, when testing the electrolytic
qualities of the liquid, that when I
introduced into it a copper and a
silver coin, electrically connected,
the stuff was rapidly decomposed
into the purple vapor with the gen-
eration of a powerful current.

  But the metal seemed not affected
at all. That was another puzzling
result. My experiments, of course,
were comparatively crude and when
I had gone as far as I could I really
knew little more about the silver
liquid than in the beginning.

  Despite Melvar’s warning and my
own precautions I snlashed a drop
of it on my arm. She cried out in
horror and I saw that a splotch of
purple was spreading like a thin film
over the skin. There was no pain
but the muscles of the arm were
seized with sudden uncontrollable
convulsions. Melvar tried to wash
the stain off with water from my
canteen. In an hour the color had
faded though the limb was still sore
and painful.

  By that time the purple disc of the
Sun was sinking low and we took
thought of how to spend the night.
Naro climbed up on the plain to
gather a few of the fruits for our
supper and we found a little cave
in the bluff that seemed a good place
of shelter. I gathered an armful of
the red brush and made a fire.

  The leaves burned fiercely, crack-
ling as if they contained oil. The
fire produced a great volume of acrid
black smoke. Combustion was great-
ly accelerated on account of the in-
creased atmospheric pressure here,
many thousand feet below sea level.
Melvar and Naro were intensely in-
terested in the performance although
they had seen Austen light a fire
while he was in the city.

  Melvar slept in the cavern and
Naro and I took turns standing
guard at the entrance. The darting
pencils of crimson were abroad again
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE	135

but they passed far overhead and
we heard the sounds of their pas-
sage only as vast and distant sighs.

  In the morning we rose early, and
clambered back up the cliffs. I was
in rather a puzzling situation. Clear-
ly my duty was to get Austen’s
equipment to him as quickly as pos-
sible but I liked neither to desert
Melvar and her brother nor to let
them accompany me into the un-
known perils of the region beyond.
But the latter course seemed the
best and they were ready enough to
go with me anywhere.

HAVING retraced our course of
the day before for perhaps a
mile in order to get upon the upland,
we set out for the north. The Sun
was just rising above the black rim
when Naro shouted and pointed at
the mist-clad red hills beyond the
Silver Lake. At first I looked in
vain. Then I caught a faint flicker of
amber light, pulsing up through the
purple air.

  Abruptly a vast mellow golden
beam sprang from behind the distant
scarlet hills and spread up toward
the zenith in a deep yellow flood. It
seemed to vibrate, to throb with in-
credibly rapid fluctuations. Sud-
denly, bright swift-changing form-
less shapes of green and red flared
up within it, shot up the beam and
vanished. The radiance dimmed and
died.

  I could see nothing but somehow
I felt that an invisible beam of vi-
brant force was still pouring up into
the sky. Here was another manifes-
tation of the unknown power beyond
the sea. The beam had come. So far
as visibility was concerned it was
gone. What had been its meaning,
its purpose?

  Beyond the Silver Lake low cliffs
rose above a broad sandy beach,
faintly veiled by the purple mist.
The red hills were fainter still above
them and the thicker pall of purple
haze that hung over the hidden place
beyond stood out distinctly against

the distant steep black wall that
threw its jagged crags to the sky
so far above. Out of that vale of
mystery the ray had leapt—and died.
Or had it merely faded to be now
invisible—but pulsing still?

  All seemed as it had been before
but from the attitude of my com-
panions I knew there was more to
come. They were gazing up into the
Sun-bright void above and waiting
expectantly.

  Then I saw, far, far above, grow-
ing gradually brighter against the
sky as if it were being projected
there by a great magic lantern be-
hind the hills, an upright bar of sil-
ver haze.

  Slowly it grew brighter and its
outlines sharper until it looked like
a vertical bar of silver metal in the
sky—inconceivably huge. The
length of the bar must have been
miles, its diameter many hundreds
of yards. It hung still in the heavens,
neither rising nor falling. Here was
a display indeed of alien science and
power!

  Presently I recovered from my
first wonder and became conscious
that the blue eyes of Melvar were
upon me quite as much as on the
astonishing thing in the sky.

  “Melvar, have you seen it before?"
I asked. “Is it real—natural? Is it
made by man?” I found to my sur-
prise that my voice was odd and
quavery. I had not realized the in-
tensity of my nervous strain. I
waited eagerly for the reassurance
that she could not give.

  “It comes often,” she replied.
“Every day for many months of the
year. The priests say that it is the
evil goddess of the under-earth, who
loves the Purple Sun and flies to
the sky to meet him. But the Sun
goes on unheeding and the goddess
cries silver tears until her Lord is
gone from the sky. But there is yet
more to see.”

  I looked up again and saw that a
faint colored mist was gathering
about the bar. It grew brighter,
136

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

condensed, seemed drawn into swirl-
ing rings by a sort of magnetic at-
traction. And the iridescent mist-
rings swam about the bar, moved
ever faster until they were whirling
madly.

  Their coruscating shanes grew
brighter, plainer, until they were
vivid, spinning flames of color in
the sunshine. I noticed that the red
was about the center of the silver
bar and that the bands of color
above and below ran regularly to
the other end of the spectrum, with
rings of violet at the bottom and at
the top. During all this time I heard
no sound. It was as still as death.

  Still the color-rings spun and
changed, growing ever brighter and
sharper edged. The red band grew
larger about the center until its
diameter was the length of the cyl-
inder. It gleamed with a lurid scarlet
light. Below and above were spin-
ning burning circles of orange, yel-
low, green and blue, each thinner
than the one next nearer the center
and of smaller diameter. The violet
rings had shrunk to great globes of
violet fire, shining with painful in-
tensity.

INDEED, as Melvar had said, there
was more to see. The phenomenon
was so utterly strange, so utterly in-
explicable, that I was grasped in a
paralvsis of unfamiliar terror. My
breath was choked and my heart
beat wild with fear as I stared
straight at it. It was so definitely
directed by intelligence that I felt it
must spring from a weird and awful
mind.

  Indeed it seemed that I felt the
power of a vast and alien will steal-
ing: over me, seizing command of me,
making me the slave of itself. I
struggled against it. I clenched my
hands and knotted my muscles with
the intensity of my resistance to the
spell. Wheeling sparks of red fire
swam before my eyes.

  Then my efforts weakened. I could
hold out no longer. The alien will

had won. Reason and feeling and
love flowed away and left me as cold
and cruel as a rock in a stormy
wintry coast—a savage inhuman
animal. Care had left me. My soul
had lost her throne. I laughed. A
wild unearthly sound it was, like
that I had heard as I lay beneath
the tent beyond the barrier.

  I whirled around fiercely but a
firm arresting hand was laid on my
shoulder. From afar off deep blue
eyes looked into mine—eyes that
were cool and sane and brave. They
shone through the red curtains of
insanity in my brain. They broke
the spell of fear.

  Suddenly I was weak and trem-
bling and sick. Melvar’s lithe arms
were close about me. Her throbbing
heart was close to mine. And in her
dark warm blue eyes, so close to
mine, were sympathy and tender-
ness and love. She was human—she
was real. I knew that her love would
shield me from these terrors. I
smiled at her, and sank down weakly
in the red brush. But she had saved
my mind. I had wandered on the
brink of the fearful insanity of
terror and she had brought me back.

  I looked from her sweet face, so
full of anxious concern, to the thing
in the sky. But now it seemed re-
mote, unreal, and I gazed at it with
indifference. Presently I saw that
the whole thing was beginning to
sink as though a weight were being
accumulated upon it. Suddenly an
immense gleaming globule of silver
fell from the lower violet globe and
dropped straight for the Silver Lake
while the weird form of lights that
had made it floated back to its for-
mer elevation. The great shining
sphere fell and struck the white lake
with a deafening roar, sending out
great concentric waves in all direc-
tions.

  The amazing phenomenon sank
again, released a second huge drop
and rose. The process was repeated
again and again, the interval being
about 3 minutes, 15.2 seconds by my
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE

137

watch. All day it went on, the great
waves washing against the bluffs
above the beach. By nightfall the
level of the Silver Lake stood per-
ceptibly higher.

  Here was the mystery of the ori-
gin of the Silver Lake explained but
by a phenomenon more inexplicable
than the sea itself. In vain I tried
to account for it in some rational
way or to assign some natural cause
for the thing. My mind could hardly
grasp it. It was almost unbelievable
even as I looked upon it. My reason
would not admit that such a thing
could be in a rational world.

CHAPTER VII
Stalked by the Purple Beast

SO WEAK was I after that terrible
experience that it was noon be-
fore I felt able to go on. The phe-
nomenon, as I have said, continued
to stand in the sky all day and drop
regularly its burden ofjgilver liquid.
But presently I became accustomed
to it and realized that it threatened
us with no immediate danger.

  After a light lunch of the yellow
fruit and a deep draught of water
from a little stream that ran almost
parallel to our route of march for
a mile or two, we retired to the
higher ground where the scrub was
not so dense as in the bottom of the
valley and set out for the north
again. Still I was feeling mentally
limp—dully indifferent to what was
passing about—and physically ex-
hausted as well. I was not as much
on my guard against the weird perils
surrounding us as I should have
been.

  Several times Naro stopped and
listened, declaring that something
was following us, keeping in the
cover of waist-high brush in the
bottom of the little valley along the
side of which we were traveling.

But I could hear nothing.

  Melvar, for once, had ceased her
eager interrogation and was enter-
taining me with the legendary ac-
count of the past great heroes of
Astran. She sang me a few pas-
sages from the epic in her native
tongue. Her voice was clear and
pure and very beautiful.

  And though the words were
strange to me, their sound was noble
and suggestive, and there was a
powerful compelling rhythm in the
lines. She translated the story into
English. It was about such an epic
poem as might have been expected,
dealing with the adventures of an
immortal hero, who had once con-
quered the Purple Ones, set up the
vast palaces of Astran and at last
lost his life on an expedition across
the Silver Lake to battle the Krimlu.

  Suddenly her sweet voice was in-
terrupted by a low cry from Naro,
who had fiercely gripped my arm. I
turned in time to see a weird figure,
gnarled and stooped and with long
white' hair, slink swiftly and fur-
tively from a great rock to the shel-
ter of the red brush. Squat and bent
as it was there was no mistaking
that it was human in shape and that
the skin was purple.

  In the dull apathy in which I was
sunken I could not realize the dan-
ger. “I guess a rifle bullet will fix
it,” I said.

  “The Purple Ones have more pow-
er than you know,” cried Melvar.
“Let us try to get on more open
ground before it attacks.. Then it
will have to leave its cover.”

  So we turned and ran away from
the stream to a rocky hillside, where
the red scrub grew low and scant.
As we ran I heard a crashing behind
us. Once I turned quickly and raised
my rifle. The strange figure darted
abruptly into view and I fired on the
iilfetant.

  I think I hit it, for it spun-around
quickly, and fell to the ground. But
in a moment it was up and running
toward us with an agility that was
138

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

  incredible, springing over the red
  brush in great bounds with a motion
  more like that of a monstrous hop-
  ping insect than of a human being.

    His white hair was flying in wild
  disorder, his shrunken limbs plainly
  flashing purple. And a terrible sound
  came from it as it bounded along—
  not a scream of rage or of pain but
  a weird uncanny laugh that rang
  strangely over the red plain and
  made us pause in our race and
  tremble with alien terror.

    But we broke the icy fingers of
  fear that gripped our hearts and
  ran on until we reached a great flat
  rock that lay at the upper edge o'f the
  bare space, in the rim of the thickets.

, I lifted Melvar in my arms until she
  could reach the top and scramble up.
  When I looked back I saw the purple
  man leaping across the clearing with
  incredible speed, not two hundred
  yards away.

  T^EN Naro and I got up on that
  rock—I have never been able to
  remember just how we did it. 1
  dronned to my knees, seized the rifle
  that I had pushed up before me and
  began to pumn lead at the beast as
  fast as I could work the bolt.

    The recoils of the gun seemed al-
  most a steady thrust. I heard the
  bullets thud into the purple bodv.
  I saw it checked or driven back bv
  the impacts. One bullet took it off
  its balance and it fell. But in a
  moment it was racing on again, em-
  powered by superhuman energy.

    When my rifle was empty it was
  not twenty fe*»t away. One arm was
  gone. One side of the body was
  fearfully torn. The purple face was
  a hideous mangrled thing. It did not
  biped but the wounds were covered
  with a purple viscous slime. One of
  the eves was P’one and the other
  glared at us with a wild red light.
  Anything of ordinary life must long
  since have been dead. But it gathered
  itself and leapt for the top of the
  boulder.

    On the day before I had showed

Melvar how to use my guns, merely
by way of proof that there was
nothing supernatural in the working
of the weapon that had slain so many
of the Astranians in the temple. Now
I pushed One of the pistols toward
her. She was standing there motion-
less. There was no panic in her face
and I knew that she would have the
courage to use'the weapon to save
herself from the terrible brute if
things came to the worst. She smiled
at me even as she picked up the
gun. Then, looking at the safety, she
gripped it in a businesslike way.

  As the purple monster sprang
upon the boulder I emptied my auto-
matic into it. Great wounds were
torn in the dark flesh and half the
face was shot away but the thing
seemed immune to death by ordinary
means. As the last shot was fired it
stood before us on the rock, a ter-
rible mangled thing, its one red eye
blazing with demonic inhumanity.

  Naro sprang out before me, his
crystal sword raised high. As the
beast sprang at him he cut at it
with a mighty sweep of the razor-
edged weapon. But the stroke, which
would have decapitated an ordinary
human, was parried by a terrific
blow of the claw-like hand of the
thing and the boy was sent spinning
back against me. We fell together
on the rock.

  Then it hurled itself toward Mel-
var. It all happened in the briefest
of moments before I could even be-
gin to rise. She swung up the auto-
matic with a quick graceful move-
ment. She was like a beautiful god-
dess of battle, blue eyes shining
brightly, golden hair gleaming in the
sun.

  Again that mad laugh was ringing
out with a choking sob in it, for the
thing’s vocal organs were injured.
It leapt at her, its lacerated limbs
working like machinery. Calmly she
stood, with automatic raised. The
muzzle of the gun was not an inch
from the throat of the beast when
she fired.
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE	139

  The strange head was blown com-
pletely off the body, and fell rolling
and bouncing to the red brush below.
The body collapsed, writhing and
convulsed. It was not quiet for many
minutes.

  The girl dropped the gun, sudden-
ly trembling, and threw herself into
my arms, sobbing uncontrollably.
Her courage and coolness had saved
us all and I admit that I was quite
as much unstrung as she after the
danger had passed. What a wonder-
ful being she was!

IT WAS so late in the day and we
were so completely exhausted that
we decided to go no farther. Naro
was not hurt save for a few scratches
and I suppose he was Hie least ex-
cited of the three. In a few minutes
he threw the quivering purple body
off the boulder and carried it and
the head back across the clearing
to dispose of them.

  When he returned we found an
overhanging shelf on the north side
of the boulder that would afford
some shelter from the flying lights.
We gathered some of the yellow fruit
for supper, cleaned and reloaded the
weapons and prepared to spend the
night there.

  Naro called me aside and showed
me a curious much-worn silver
bracelet with a singular design upon
it. He told me in his imperfect Eng-
lish that it had belonged to his fa-
ther, who had been taken by the fly-
ing lights many years before. This
was a curious development. It
showed that there was some connec-
tion between the dreaded Purple
Ones and the terrible pillaging red
lights. But the full significance of
it did not dawn upon me until later.

  By that time I was in a measure
accustomed to the passage of the
whistling needles of crimson fire and
during the first part of the night I
was able to sleep while Naro sat up
to keep watch. At midnight he
awakened me, and we changed
places.

  The sky was crossed and recrossed
by the faint and flickering tracks of
red and the night was weirdly lit
by the torpedo-shades of scarlet
flame that sped upon them. With a
fatuous sense of security I was lean-
ing back against the boulder, smok-
ing my pipe and caressing the cold
metal of the rifle in my hand, dream-
ing of what Melvar and I might do
if ever we were to emerge into the
world alive.

  The red thing was upon me before
I knew it. The light of my pipe
must have been visible to it. In my
accursed thoughtlessness that dan-
ger had never occurred to me. The
thing came plunging down, flooding
the landscape with its lurid crimson
radiance while the earth vibrated
to its whistling, hissing scream.

  There was no need to waken my
companions for they sprang to their
feet in alarm. We all cowered back
against the rock in the hope of escap-
ing observation. But the thing had
already seen us. I put my arm about
the warm, throbbing body of Melvar
and drew her close to my breast. Her
cool white hand grasped mine as
silently we waited.

  The red object came down swiftly,
paused just above the crimson
thickets before us, then settled de-
liberately to earth. It was the first
opportunity I had had for a close
examination of these things. Their
shape was plainly cylindrical, taper-
ing toward the ends. It was perhaps
ten feet in diameter and a hundred
long. Set on the forward end was
a bright green globe, some three feet
in diameter.

  A clump of brush about the end
of the cylinder burst into flame. As
the bright crimson hue began to dull
I suddenly grasped the fact that the
red color was due to the red heat
generated by friction with the air,
which was very great at the meteor
pace the thing attained.

  It lay there not fifty yards away,
with the fire blazing and crackling
about the end of our right, eating
140

WONDER STORY ANNUAL

its way into the thickets. The green
sphere on the other end seemed to
stare at us like a great intent eye.
The red color slowly faded. Sud-
denly Melvar gripped my arm.

  “Why wait?” she whispered. “Per-
haps it does not see us after all. Let’s
slip around the boulder.”

  But the instant we moved a great
oval space swung out of the side of
the cylinder. We saw that the door
and walls were of a bluish white
metal and were very thick. It was
very dark inside. A blood-congealing
eerie laugh sounded out of that
darkness and I shuddered. Quickly
five human-like figures leaped one by
one out of the oval doorway.

  With heart-chilling fear I saw by
the flickering light of the burning
thicket that long white hair hung
about faces wrinkled and hideously
aged, faces with toothless mouths,
red glaring eyes and skin that was
purple. Without a moment’s hesi-
tation the five naked monsters
rushed down upon us.

  The fire was fast blazing higher,
burning rapidly into the brush be-
tween us and the cylinder, and we
could see the purple boasts quite
plainly in its light. And they were
hideous to look upon. They came
toward us with monstrous springing
bounds, actuated by some extraor-
dinary force.

  Their muscles must have been far
stronger than those of men, perhaps
as strong as those of insects. Or,
since muscular force depends on the
intensity of nerve currents, perhaps
their nerves were extraordinarily
excited. And there was something
insect-like in the way life had lin-
gered in the body of the one we had
killed when it had already many
wounds that should have been mor-
tal.

  I leveled my rifle, drew a bead on
the neck of the foremost one and
fired. I must have had the luck to
shatter the bones for the head
dropped limplv to the side. The thing
stopped abruptly, groping blindly

about with its talon-like fingers. It
seemed very strange that it did not
fall.

   In an instant one of the others ran
close by it. The crippled monster
sprang savagely at the other and in
a moment they were writhing and
struggling in the brush, tearing at
one another with tiger-like ferocity.
The others passed by them for a
moment while I finished emptying
the rifle, without visible results.

BY THAT time the crackle of the
swiftly spreading fire had grown
to a dull roar. It swept fast across
the brush, red flames flaring high
and dense smoke rolling up into the
night. The purple beasts did not ap-
pear to see it. They made no effort
to avoid the flames. Were they in-
vulnerable to fire? Or was fire mere-
ly unknown to them as to the people
-of Astran?

  The three rushed straight on
toward us, disregarding the rushing
wall of flame not a dozen yards to
the right of them. I kept firing
madly. The leg of one went limp, but
he leapt on with scarcely diminished
speed, laughing terribly, white hair
flying about his awful face while
his purple limbs moved frenziedly.
The flames rushed over the fallen
two and hid them. In another instant
the curtain of fire rolled over the
others and even the ship was hidden
from our view.

  Suddenly I realized that we were
in quite as much danger from the
fire as from the monsters. Already
we were shrinking from the hot
wind that blew before the flames,
half choked by the acrid fumes. For
the second time we made a mad re-
treat to the top of the boulder and
lay flat.

  I heard a terrible laugh from the
flames and one of the things dashed
out. His hair was gone, his nurple
flesh burnt black. I shot as it showed
itself and it fell. In another instant
the flames had raced over it again.
None of the others appeared.
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE	141

  We lay on the rock for several
minutes, gasping in the cooler air
that lingered near its surface. For
a time the heat was stifling but the
scanty vegetation burned off quickly
and soon a cool breeze came up from
the south and lifted the smoke.

  We saw that the cylinder still lay
where it had been although the
heavy body was closed. The green
light still shone in the forward end.
About it the earth lay black and
smoking and a low line of flame lay
below the pall of smoke in a great
ring all about us. Between us and
the ship I saw in the darkness the
black shadows that were the five
dead man-beasts.

  I was just beginning to wonder if
all the crew of the ship were dead
so that we might enter and examine
it when the great oval door in the
side swung open again and some-
thing sprang out of it into the night.
I heard a strange hissing and a
clatter of metal.

  In the semi-darkness I could see
nothing plainly but there was a float-
ing shape of greenish mist with a
vague form beneath. I strained my
eyes to try to distinguish its shape
while it stood motionless.

  Abruptly a narrow intensely-
bright beam of orange light shot out
of it and impinged upon the rock.
There was a dull thud from the rock
and the ray was dead in a moment.
But the granite where it had struck
was cut away—obliterated! The
beam had shone straight through the
boulder, carrying away or resolving
into primary electrons the matter
on which it had struck! The smooth
edges of the cut were glowing with
a soft violet radiance.

  My rifle was at hand and on re-
covering from my surprise I fired. I
aimed just below the greenish patch.
Something must have been exploded
by the bullet, for there was a vivid
flash of white fire and a loud sharp
report. The spot of green was visible
no longer and we saw no motion
about the cylinder.

  At the time I had no idea what
it was that I had shot. I supposed
that it had been another of the
purple beasts, armed with a strange
ray-weapon. I imagined that the
bullet had struck the weapon and
caused the explosion.

CHAPTER VIII
The Battle in the Mist

FOR perhaps an hour we sat there
on the rock. As soon as the
smoke cleared we could see the crim-
son needles flying high upon their
vague red tracks. We watched them
with a sort of hypnotic fascination,
dreading the moment when one of
them would land to investigate the
fate of the ship that lay silent and
presumably empty before us.

  The ground was still too hot for us
to walk upon and we felt the use-
lessness of attempting to escape on
foot, even if it had already cooled.
With a feeling of resigned and hope-
less horror we saw one of the crim-
son pencils circle lower about the
place, then disappear in the direc-
tion of its lair beyond the Silver
Lake.

  Even as the whistling roar of its
passage was rolling down upon us
Melvar spoke. How I admire the
courage and indomitable resource-
fulness of the girl. While I was
hopelessly lost in despair, feeling all
the desolation of this region and the
infinite remoteness of the world of
men, her pure rich voice and the
warm living touch of her hand
brought new courage to me.

  “The Krimlu are coming,” she
cried. “There is no use to try to
fight them or to try to outrun them.
But that ship must be empty. The
walls are metal and strong. Per-
haps they could not open it.”

  While several things about the
proposition were not very attractive
142	WONDER STORY ANNUAL,

it seemed our best resource. Be-
sides, I had a keen desire to see the
interior. We gathered up our equip-
ment, climbed off the boulder, hur-
ried over to the cylinder.

  I was possessed by a haunting
fear that we would find something:
hideous awaiting us but the bright
pencil of light from my pocket lamp
revealed no living being in the long
interior. Nor could I find even a
trace of the green patch that had
blown up in front of the door. We
scrambled through the opening
without difficulty and I turned a
handle that swung the heavy door
shut and evidently locked it.

  Then I set about examining the
mechanism for I had an intense
curiosity about the propulsive force
that enabled the vessel to attain a
speed that must have reached thou-
sands of miles per hour. In one end
were rows of long cylinders of a
transparent substance, evidently
filled with the metallic fluid from
the Silver Lake.

  Pipes ran from them to a complex
mechanism in the rear end of the
ship, from which heavy conduits ran
all over the inside of the metal hull.
While my understanding of it was
far from complete I was able to
verify a previous idea—that the
strange vessels were driven by use
of the rocket principle.

  It seems that the silver fluid was
decomposed in the machine and that
the purple gas it formed at a very
high temperature was forced out
through the various tubes at a ter-
rific velocity, propelling the ship by
its reaction. The whistling roar of
the things in motion was, of course,
the sound of the escaping gas. The
red-purple tracks were merely the
expelled gas hanging in the air.

  The green globe in the forward
end may have been the objective
lens for a marvelous periscope. At
any rate the walls of the forward
part of the shell seemed trans-
parent. And the periscope must
have utilized infra-red rays, for the

scene about us seemed much
brighter than it was in reality. We
could see very plainly the burned
plain and the granite rock, and once,
through a rift in the clouds of smoke
that were rising about, I caught a
glimpse of the gleaming city of
Astran, high above us in the west.

  I noticed a slender lever with a
corrugated disc at the top, rising
out of the floor in the bow of the
ship. It occurred to me that it was
the control lever. I took hold of it
and gingerly pushed it back. Great
jets of purple gas rushed past the
transparent walls about us and the
ship slid backward on the ground.
The sensation of motion was most
alarming.

  The illusion of the transparency
of the bow of the ship was so per-
fect that it seemed almost as if we
were hanging in space a few feet in
the front of the mouth of an open
tube. It was impossible for me to
realize that I was surrounded by
solid walls of metal until I touched
them.

  I think the wonderful telescope
worked on much the same principle
as television—that is, the rays of
light were picked up, converted into
electrical impulses, amplified and
then projected on the metal wall,
which served as a screen.

I RETURNED to my experiments
with the leiver. The control was
relatively simple. The vessel was
propelled forward when the lever
was pushed forward, reversed when
the lever was pulled back. Slipping
the little disc up or down raised or
lowered the prow and twisting it
accomplished the steering in the
horizontal plane.

  By the time my cautious experi-
ments revealed all this Melvar had
pointed out three slender crimson
craft, wheeling low about us and
evidently preparing to land. I pulled
the knob up and pushed it forward
all the way. A pale red beam shot
ahead. The black landscape dropped
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE	143

away from us and we hurtled
through the air of the night.

  I was amazed at the lack of any
great sensation of motion, that the
jets of gas, for all their appalling
roar without, were barely audible
within the cylinder. Still the fore-
part of the ship was transparent
from within, so that we had the
oddest sensation of floating'free in
space.

  I saw that the three ships had
fallen in a line behind us, and were
following at the same terrific pace.
When we had reached an altitude of
perhaps a mile I twisted the knob
to bring the helm about. We shot
over the Silver Lake, which lay like
a white desert of moonlit sand be-
neath us, standing out sharply
against the dark plain around it.

  In a moment we had gone over it
and over the low hills beyond into
the bank of purple mist. I had
hoped to have time to land and have
the vessel on the ground below but
I looked back and saw that our pur-
suers were gaining swiftly. Slender
twisting rays of bright orange and
green were darting toward us from
the hurtling arrow-like ships of red.

  In the darkness and the mist we
could see nothing of the ground be-
low. The only visible things were
a few mist-veiled stars above and
the bright scarlet torpedoes that
shot after us. Quickly I circled and
raised t’ie helm. I was almost in-
toxicated with excitement and the
indescribable sensations of our swift
and lofty flight.

  I felt released from all the weak-
ness of the body—I had conquered
the force that holds all men to earth.
I felt a new wonderful sensation of
freedom and power. I had but to
move the little piece of metal in my
hand to go where I pleased with
almost the speed of light. But still
the line of ships behind us came out
at an incredible pace, stabbing at
us with the green and orange rays.

  Then, high above the others, I
brought the ship around in a hair-

pin turn and plunged directly at
them. They tried to turn aside
while their rays shot thickly toward
us but our speed was too great. The
foremost suddenly turned broadside
toward us, attempting to get out of
our path. I held our bow directly
at it, raised it a trifle at the last
instant. The keel of our vessel
struck the other amidships. The
terrific crash of the collision hurled
us to the floor.

  When I regained my feet we were
falling in a crazy twisting path, our
ship altogether out of control. No
sooner was I on my feet than the
floor tilted up again and I fell back
to my hands and knees. I saw that
the one we had struck was broken
in two and plunging toward the
earth far behind us while the other
two were circling far overhead.

  The mist about us grew thicker
until the other ships and the frag-
ments of the wrecked one were
strangely colored purple—thicker
still, until they vanished. We floated
in a world of purple fog.

  I seized the control lever as soon
as our wild gyrations enabled me to
reach it but my unskilled efforts
only resulted in making us roll and
twist more wildly. So long as we
had been on an even keel the pilot-
ing had been easy enough, although
I imagine my success in ramming
the other ship had been largely due
to luck. But the blow against us
had been broadside, setting the ship
to spinning like a top. It seemed
that we fell an interminable time.
Whenever the stern pointed down-
ward for a moment I pushed the
lever forward to check our fall as
much as possible.

  Through the mist I suddenly
caught a glimpse of the dark ground
below. In another instant the ves-
sel had struck heavily, throwing us
against the floor again.

  Day was beginning to break at
last and we could see that we had
fallen on a bare gravelled hilltop.
The clear space was only an acre or
144	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

so in extent. We were shut in on
all sides by a dense dark forest of
gigantic trees that rose threaten-
ingly, seeming to grasp us, to close
in on us. The purple mist hung in
a sombre curtain overhead.

NARO and I strapped on our packs,
picked up our weapons and
opened the door. The three of us
stepped out to face the perils of
another world. What they might
be we did not know. I had no idea
what part of the country was in-
habited by the Krimlu. But Austen
had not let himself be conquered by
the mere strangeness of the place.
I still hoped to be able to find him
although a search in such a jungle
as that about us seemed hopeless.

  The walls of the rocket-ship were
still glowing dull red with the heat
of its passage through the air and
we hurried away over the gravel for
fifty yards to get beyond the fierce
heat it radiated. The patch of sky
above was a dull dusky luminescent
purple.

  All about us towered the forest.
As the light grew better we could
see that the trees were red. They
bore the same feathery fronds, the
same starlike flowers of brilliant
white, the same golden-brown fruits
as the plants of the plain about
Astran. But they were immensely
greater—they towered up hundreds
of feet.

  It was like a forest of the tree-
ferns of the Carboniferous period,
save for the deep bloody scarlet of
the leaves.

  The ground all about the knoll
was low and marshy and the air was
heavy with the odors of rotting
vegetation. There was no wind and
the air, under the great atmospheric
pressure, was heavy, moist and hot.
It was oppressive. It hung like a
weight upon our chests. And the
crimson jungle seemed to possess a
terrible life and spirit of its own.
It did not belong to our world.

  The undergrowth was very thick.

The higher branches were dimmed
by the purple mist. They seemed
almost to reach the heavy dull pur-
ple sky. It appeared useless to try
to penetrate it. It was an evil be-
ing, waiting to seize us.

  I got out my compass and we de-
cided to try to make our way toward
the north in the direction of the
pass by which we supposed Austen
to have rounded the Silver Lake. As
I had last noted our position above
the mist, with reference to the lake
and the crater walls, we had been
roughly fiften miles south of the
pass. I hoped, by taking a course
in that direction, to come across
some trace of Austen.

  As we approached the north side
of the clearing I made a startling
discovery. In the side of the hill
was a deposit of iron pyrites. Not
that there was anything remarkable
about that. But the thing that
struck me was that the vein had
been recently worked!

  I sprang down in the pit and
found on the rock traces of copper
that had evidently come from soft
copper tools. I knew that Austen
would have needed minerals, that,
indeed, if he had set up a wireless
outfit in here, he must have been
compelled to do an immense amount
of work in collecting and refining
the needed materials.

  I had little doubt that he had been
there but it had been evidently weeks
or months earlier. Any trail that
he might have made through the
forest would have already grown up.

  I thought the situation over for
awhile but there still seemed noth-
ing better to do than to follow our
original plan of exploring the jungle
to the north. We plunged into the
crimson gloom. Without the com-
pass we would have been quickly
lost. Even with it it was hard
enough to keep in the same direc-
tion, walking over the marshy
ground and breaking a path through
the heavy undergrowth. We were
soon covered with mud and dyed red
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE	145

with the stain of the vegetation.

  For many hours we struggled
through a wilderness of endless
sameness—a dank morass, a crim-
son jungle, with the dusky purple
sky hanging heavily in the treetops.

  At first the forest had been quiet
with a silence that was dead and
depressing, for there were no living
things about us. No birds, no in-
sects—not even a bright moth or
butterfly. It was a wilderness of
death. But presently we heard, far
ahead of us, a dull constant roar,
that grew louder as we went on.

  At last it grew so loud that we
had to shout when we wished one
another to hear our words. I was
glad of the roar for it drowned the
sound of our progress through the
jungle. But the forest was so dense
that there seemed little danger of
our capture unless we stumbled on
the habitation of the Krimlu.

  Abruptly the jungle ended and we
stepped out on a bare ledge of stone.
Before us was one of the most mag-
nificent spectacles that I have be-
held. To the west a great black cliff
rose perhaps a thousand feet—until
it was almost lost against the lower-
ing smoky purple of the sky. Over
it plunged a vast sheet of the glow-
ing white liquid of the Silver Lake,
falling in a gigantic unbroken arch
to the immense pool beneath us,
where, it broke with a deafening
roar into a gleaming bank of soft
silver haze.

  Surrounding the black rock rims
of the pool the gloomy crimson of
the forest closed in. The pool it-
self was a thousand feet across.
The whole scene was colossal. It
was awe-inspiring and impressive.

  There was no visible outlet for the
silver liquid. So I knew that it must
find its way off underground. I
sensed that we must be far below
the level of the Silver Lake and the
plain beyond. That fact may have
accounted for the more luxuriant
growth of the red vegetation.

  Suddenly Naro reported the dis-

covery of the comparatively fresh
print of a hob-nailed boot in a little
patch of mould on the rock. That
set us to looking again for traces of
Austen and presently we found a
well-defined trail that led east.

  We followed it eagerly. When we
had gone perhaps a mile we came to
an outcropping seam of coal. There
I found the plain marks of a copper
pick. Evidently a good deal of coal
had been dug up and carried off
down the trail.

CHAPTER IX
Austen’s Retreat

PERHAPS two hundred yards
further we came upon the camp.
It was atop a little hill below a giant
tree. By the trunk was a mud-
daubed hut with an open shed in
front of it. By the shed was a rude
clap furnace with piles of coal, some
strange ore and large lumps of na-
tive copper lying by it.

  Beneath the shed was what ap-
peared to be a small steam turbine
with a kettle-like boiler of ham-
mered copper. Connected with it
was a dynamo of crude but ingeni-
ous construction. Also there were
a rude forge and hammers, anvils,
saws and drills, all of copper or
bronze and a device that I supposed
had been used for drawing wire.

  Simple as it seemed that camp of
Austen’s was perhaps the most re-
markable thing I came across in the
crater. Austen was a wonderful
man. Having not only an exhaustive
knowledge of a half dozen fields of
science—and he had not mere theo-
ries but a practical working knowl-
edge—he had also courage and de-
termination, patience, manual skill,
resourcefulness and invention.

  While the average man would
hardly have been able to keep alive
in the jungle Austen was able to do
146	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

such things as smelt and refine ore
and set up complicated and work-
able electrical machinery. Of course
he was fortunate in finding himself
in a place where practically no effort
was needed to satisfy his physical
needs and where he could find vari-
ous natural resources in available
and easily accessible form. But I
shall never cease to wonder at his
accomplishments in less than a year.

  I was struck by a sudden fear
that we had come too late, that
something had happened to him.
“Austen!” I shouted, “Austen, are
you here?"

  For answer an old man, whom I
recognized joyfully as the scientist,
appeared in the rude doorway of the
hut. His clothing was tattered be-
yond description and he looked very
worn and thin. There were lines of
age about his wrinkled face.

  But his hair was neatly brushed
and he had just been shaving for his
safety razor was in his hand. A
smile of astonishment and incredu-
lous joy sprang over his face. For
a moment he was speechless. Then
the old familiar voice called out un-
certainly, almost sobbing with joy.

  “Winfield! Melvar! Naro! Can it
really be you? At last!"

  Then, as if he were a little
ashamed of the feeling he had
shown, he pulled out his pipe and
began to try to fill it, his fingers
trembling with emotion. But Melvar
sprang to him and threw her arms
about him in a way that gave me a
momentary pang of jealousy. He
stuck the pipe back in his pocket,
grinning awkwardly in a way that
tightened the strings of my heart.

  “I forgot,” he said. “My tobacco
was all gone a week ago.”

  I shook his hand and it clung to
mine for a moment as if he were
seeking support. Then Naro placed
his palm upon Austen’s shoulder in
the customary greeting of Astran.

  “I’d almost given up,” the old man
said. “The world is so far away
that it seems almost unreal. After

I had sent the wireless call a few
times the devilish rustling in the
sky got too close for comfort and I
decided that the hissing red lights,
whatever they are, were about to
locate me by the signals. So I quit
that. But how did you come over?”
I told him briefly about our ad-
venture with the red ship.

  “Yes, I knew that the things were
ships of some kind,” he said when I
had finished. “I have been working
on the quicksilver stuff and making
a few exploring trips. I have dis-
covered several things. I had to
work—work endlessly—to keep go-
ing. Sometimes I got to feeling
pretty low.

  “Then I would shave and try to
clean up like a civilized man. And
I kept repeating all the poetry I
knew—that helped a lot. But Lord
—you haven’t any idea how glad I
am to see you! By the way, did you
bring the spectroscope and tubes?”
By way of reply I took off the
pack that contained them. He began
to open it with as much enthusiasm
as a small boy investigating a
Christmas present. Suddenly he
looked at us. “But you don’t look as
if you’ve had any holiday your-
selves. What happened to you?”
“Two or three things,” I told him.
“It hasn’t been a holiday at all. Do
you happen to have any coffee left?
I left mine in the tent outside the
cliffs.”

  “And how about a little hot Mulli-
gan stew to go with it?” He grinned,
beckoning the way inside.

SO WE went into the cabin. Most
of the room seemed to be devoted
to his crude laboratory equipment.
On one of his benches were several
roughly modeled pottery jars, filled
with the liquid from the Silver Sea.

  In a few minutes he had the cof-
feepot boiling over a charcoal bra-
zier. I believe its aroma was about
the most pleasant that ever reached
my nostrils.

  When the coffee was done Austen
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE	147

served a meal consisting' of a great
pot of steaming soup made of the
yellow fruits, cooked with the tender
roots of the red plants. That stands
out in my memory as one of the
truly magnificent repasts that have
ever been laid before me.

  Finished, Melvar retired to Aus-
ten’s bunk and Naro and I lay down
on a blanket on the laboratory floor.
I went to sleep at once and, if I may
credit the word of our host, slept
for thirty-seven and a half hours.
Although I am inclined to believe
that is an exaggeration.

  At any rate, when I got up I felt
a new man. Austen had set up the
apparatus we brought. He had a
test tube full of the silver liquid in
a beam of X-rays. The spectroscope
was in position to examine the dense
purple gas that was rising from the
stuff.

  “How’s it coming?” I asked him.

  He shook his head sadly. “I don’t
know,” he said. “I have a theory
but it doesn’t seem to work out
right. The key is in sight but it
always eludes me. There is energy
stored in the silver liquid. It may
be that that amazing thing in the
sky stores the energy of sunlight in
the stuff.

  “You know that the energy in
sunlight amounts to something over
one horsepower for each square yard
on which it falls. Or perhaps the
atomic energy of the gases in the
air is released. It seems impossible
to find the key although I have been
able to analyze the stuff pretty ac-
curately. If I had it I could make
the silver stuff go off like ten times
its weight of T.N.T.”

  “Do you think,” I asked him ea-
gerly, “that you could set off some
of it and wipe out the Krimlu?”

  “Winfield,” the old scientist sober-
ly replied, “even if you could, would
you wipe out a whole civilization—
a science as high as that which made
the Silver Lake—a culture equal to,
if not above, that of our own
world?”

  “If you had seen those purple
things—men and women, old and
hideous and fearfully strong and
malignant—you couldn’t move too
quickly to blot them off the earth,”
I cried.

  “I have seen,” he said seriously.
“I have seen the purple monsters
and they are terrible enough. But
they are not the masters. They are
but the servants or perhaps I should
say the machines of a higher power.

  “There is another form of intelli-
gence here, Winfield. A form of life
unrelated to humanity, without any
sympathy for mankind or any share
of human feelings. Perhaps it is a
danger to the human race. These
beings would not hesitate, I suppose,
to use all humanity as they have
used the people of Astran.

  “But that does not solve the prob-
lem. Would it be right to wipe them
out ? Perhaps it would be better for
mankind to go under. Perhaps they
are superior to us. The purposes of
the creation of intelligent life might
be better met by these things than
by man. I have given it a great deal
of thought and I can’t decide.”

  He fell silent and presently I said,
“You say there is another form of
life here. What is it like?”

  “You will know soon enough. I
wish I had never seen. It is not a
good thing to talk about. There is
no use for me to tell you.”

HE WOULD tell me no more.
Presently I left him and went
down to bathe in the stream that
flowed back of the camp. The water
was sluggish and tepid, certainly not
invigorating, but it was cleansing.
When I got back Melvar and Naro
were up. The girl seemed very glad
to see Austen again. She was talk-
ing with him, very vivacious and
very beautiful. When I saw her I
loved her more than ever.

  As soon as we had eaten Austen
began to dismount the spectrometer
and other equipment and pack them.
“I can go no farther with the experi-
148	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

  ments here/’ he said. “I am going
  to take the outfit to a place where
  we can see one of the engines of the
  Krimlu, where the silver liquid is
  broken up. There I may be able to
  get the clue I need.”

    In an hour we were ready to de-
  part. Austen led the way, silent
  and preoccupied with the details of
  his work. We went down a narrow
  trail through the stagnating
  marshes in the eldritch gloom of the
  weird red jungle under the dull pur-
  ple mist. For many hours we were
  on the way until the purple dusk
  began to thicken and a distant sigh-
  ing whistle told us that night had
  fallen and the evil masters were
  abroad again.

    Suddenly Austen called out in a
  guarded tone for us to halt. We
  crept forward cautiously until we
  could see over the brink of a vast
  circular chasm. Sheer black walls,
  ringed by the red jungle, fell for a
  thousand feet. The round floor was
  a half mile across.

    Upon it was the most gigantic and
  amazing mechanical device I have
  ever seen. It was incredibly huge
  and throbbing with strange energy.
  It made little sound but the air all
  about us seemed vibrant with power.

    In the center of the pit was a
  titanic shining green cylinder, per-,
  haps a hundred feet in diameter and
  five hundred in length. A river of
  - gleaming Silver fluid ran from an
  opening in the rock through a great
  open aqueduct and poured into the
  cylinder in the middle of the upper-
  side.

    At each end of the colossal cylin-
  der rose a metal tower. At the top
  of each tower was a fifty-foot globe
  of blue crystal, slowly turning. Be-
  tween and above the spheres arched
  a high-flung span of white fire—a
  great pulsing sheet of milky opales-
  cent light—that roared and crackled
  like a powerful electric discharge
  and lit the chasm with an unearthly
  radiance.

    Toward the farther side of the

floor was a second enormous ma-
chine, apparently unconnected with
the first, resembling a vast tele-
scope. The white metal tube was a
full two hundred feet in length,
mounted on massive metal supports.
It did not seem to be in action. The
barrel of it was pointing at the sky.

  Then I saw a row of openings low
down in the side of the vast green
cylinder with shafts of bright green
light pouring from them. And I
saw tiny human figures working
feverishly about them. They had
escaped my observation at first, so
far away was the floor of the pit.
Now I saw that they were taking
great blocks of a luminous green
substance from the doors in the
cylinder and carrying them to the
tube that was pointing at the sky.

  I saw now that the bodies of the
toilers were purple. There was
something in their motion that re-
minded me of ants. I was amazed
at their strength and agility, at
their ceaseless machine-like activity.

  I remembered the time I had
splashed the white fluid on my arm,
turning it purple, and the strange
excitement of my nerves. At once
I linked up the raids on Astran, the
bracelet that Naro had found on the
dead purple beast and what Austen
had told me of superior beings who
enslaved the purple things. I knew
that I looked upon the captured men
and women of Astran, converted to
machines in this strange place!

  Perhaps they were already dead.
Certainly they moved not by their
own volition but by a stronger me-
chanical power. They must have
been under the absolute hypnotic
control of the higher intelligences,
who treated their unfortunate cap-
tives, perhaps with the argent liquid,
to convert them into unearthly ma-
chines of superhuman strength.

  We turned away into the night
that had fallen on the red jungle
while we watched. I was sick with
horror. Austen’s face was white
and his hands were trembling.
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE	149

  Now I knew, in spite of what he
had said, that were the opportunity
given him he would not hesitate to
wipe out the masters of the purple
slaves. He said nothing but his
hands worked spasmodically, he
muttered under his breath and his
dark eyes snapped with angry de-
termination.

  In a little while we set about pre-
paring the apparatus for the work
of the night. The spectroscope was
set up with telescopic condensers to
collect and analyze the radiation of
the arch of crackling milky flame.
We took care to screen ourselves in
the jungle fringe and to expose no
more of the equipment to the sight
of the beings below than necessary.

  Austen had his drawing board set
up in a convenient place behind our
shelter and he alternately peered
through the telescope at the spec-
trum and turned to make intricate
calculations by the light of a shaded
flashlight. We worked till dawn.

  All night long the white flame
played between the spinning blue
crystal spheres above the vast green
cylinder, filling the air with its
ghostly crackle and whisper. All
night long the tireless purple human
machines toiled in the pit, carrying
the great green blocks and evidently
stacking them in the vast cannon-
like tube at the side.

  Whenever Austen did not need me
with the analysis I spent my time
searching that amazing scene. But
not once did I catch a glimpse of
anything that might have been the
directing intelligence of all that
marvelous activity,

  Melvar was very tired and I had
contrived a hammock for her from
a great sheet of fibrous bark torn
from the trunk of one of the red
trees. She spent the night asleep
in that while Austen and I carried
on the work. Naro, not having
scientific inclinations, contented
himself with a couch composed of a
few feathery branches torn from
the undergrowth.

CHAPTER X
What the Analysis Showed

JUST before daylight Austen com-
pleted his calculations and stated
the result. He was very tired, and
his eyes were red. He had worked
for a day and two nights since we
had found him.

  “You know,” he said, “that there
are several rare gases in the air in
addition to oxygen and nitrogen.
The inert gas argon comprises near-
ly one percent of the atmosphere
and there are, in addition, smaller
quantities of helium, neon, xenon
and krypton, not to mention carbon
dioxide and water vapor. Those
gases are monatomic and do not or-
dinarily enter into any compounds.

  “You know that lightning in the
air causes a union of nitrogen and
oxygen, to form nitrous and nitric
acids, which may later release their
energy in the explosion of gun-
powder or nitroglycerine. In much
the same way the force that forms
the silver fluid utilizes the photo-
chemical effect of sunlight to build
up a complex molecule containing
oxygen, nitrogen and the inert gases
of helium group.

  “It is very unstable and may be
disrupted with the release of a great
amount of energy. I was able to de-
tect the characteristic lines of most
of the gases in the luminous spec-
trum of the purple gas—but not un-
til I had analyzed the light of the
opalescent flame and made my de-
ductions from that was I able to de-
rive the equations and arrive at the
precise structural formula and at
the exact wavelength necessary to
break down the molecule.”

  He proceeded to launch into a de-
tailed technical discussion of the
process of analysis he had used and
of the methods of inductive reason-
ing by which he had arrived at his
150	WONDER STORY ANNUAL

conclusion. It was rather deep for
me and I am afraid some of the
salient points have already slipped
my mind.

  Something more important was
on my mind. “Have you found out
enough?” I asked. “Can you blow
up the stuff ? Can you wipe out the
Krimlu?”

  “I am not sure,” he said, “but I
think, if I could get at that machine
with a little of my equipment, I
could manipulate it to make it go
off like a thousand tons of dynamite.
The silver stuff runs into the cylin-
der and is converted into pure vi-
brant energy. If I could just speed
up the process a bit!

  “The Krimlu seem to live under-
ground like ants. A month ago I
found an opening into their world
near the cliff south of the falls.
There are the shafts where their
ships come out, ventilator tubes and
funnels for the purple smoke from
their engines. I will go down one
of the shafts and see what can be
done.”

  “You mean we will go,” I told
him. “You don’t think—”

  “There is *.o need for you to risk
your life,” he said in a voice pur-
posely brusque to hide his emotion.
“I can do as much by myself. Then
there is Melvar. We must get her
out of here if we can. I think a
great deal of her. If we both should
go—and not come back . . .

  “No, I want you to stay on top.
I know I can trust you to treat her
fairly. If I can blast down the earth
on their underground world we
might be able to make it back
around the Silver Sea and eventu-
ally to the outside.”

  “You can trust me, sir, to care
for her to the best of my ability,”
I told him, trying without notable
success to keep my voice even and
casual.

  “Really!” He cried, looking at me
intensely. “Do you love her?”

  I admitted that I did.

  “I had hoped so,” Austen said.

“She and you are the ones dearest
to me in the world. If you were out
and safe I could—go—in peace.”

  The rude hammock in which Mel-
var had been lying sprang into vio-
lent motion and erupted her slender
beautiful figure. She came running
toward me. “I am sorry,” she gasped.
“No, I mean I am glad. I was awake,
Winfield. I heard you—” Her later
statements were not particularly co-
herent, since she was kissing me and
I was holding her in my arms and
returning the embrace. I gathered
on the whole that my feelings for
her were well reciprocated. Some
minutes later, when I came back to
earth, I observed that Austen was
taking the equipment down and that
Naro was standing and looking at us
with an expression of extreme and
comical disgust on his face.

BY THAT time it was light and
soon, by the brightening of the
purple haze above, we knew the sun
was rising. I saw that Austen was
looking into the pit. Melvar and I
walked to the edge. The great metal
tube, which the purple beings had
been all night in loading with the
green bars, was being swung slowly
about upon its mounting until pres-
ently it was pointing at the sky.

  For a moment nothing happened.
Then a low humming drone reached
our ears, coming apparently from
the complex machinery at the base
of the tube. Steadily the sound rose
in pitch, until it was an intolerably
high and painful scream. Suddenly
the high rhythm bf it had be-
come unsupportable and we ceased
to hear it. But I knew that it had
merely passed up the scale beyond
the range of our ears.

  Abruptly the colossal tube seemed
to flash into green incandescence
and a broad beam of yellow light,
blindingly brilliant and pulsing with
strange energy, poured up into the
dusky purple sky. Then I knew that
it was this machine which made the
amazing thing above the Silver Sea
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE

151

from which the white liquid fell.

  As we watched bright patches of
red and green shot up the beam.
Slowly the bright yellow faded from
the ray but still the green luminosity
clung about the tube and still I felt
that the flood of radiant purposeful
energy was flowing up into the sky.

  It was not long before I heard, far
above us in the distant west beyond
the red-clad hill, the splash of the
first great drop of silver into the ar-
gent lake. Below us the white tor-
rent was still pouring into the vast
green cylinder, the white fire was
still arching between the crystal
globes and the purple slaves were
still rushing about the pit with fe-
verish machine-like energy.

  We turned away from the place
and wralked back into the terrible
and weird semi-darkness of the scar-
let jungle, still beneath the shadow
of the evil intelligence that ruled
the crater.

  We reached the camp long before
night and Austen and I went to
sleep. The old scientist was up again
at daylight. I was amazed at his
energy and vitality. He got ready
the equipment he intended to take
and we were soon ready to set out
for the entrance of the underworld.

  Austen insisted that we leave Mel-
var and Naro behind. There was no
use, he said, in exposing them to the
hardships and dangers of the jour-
ney and it seemed that no harm
would be likely to come to them at
the cabin.

  I did not like to leave Melvar but
she was very courageous about it,
smiling through her tears. It always
takes more courage for those who
stay behind and wait than for those
who have the lure of mystery and
adventure to beckon them on.

  Melvar walked with me to the
edge of the clearing and there we
left her, taking a dim trail that led
through the dense jungle to the
south. Austen was saying nothing.
He was lost in meditation. But I
knew that when the time came he

would be ready for action.

  But how could I guess the noble
thoughts that were passing in his
mind? How could I realize that he
was marching willingly to his doom?
For my part I was thinking of the
wonderful girl I had left at the
cabin. I thought too of the horror
of the lights that haunted Astran
and of the horror that would come
if the lights ever went beyond the
rim—into the outer world.

  After several hours Austen
stopped. “It is not a half-mile to the
shafts,” he said. “We shall have to
make a rope. I have made cords from
the tough bark of the red trees. They
do very well. I want to reach the
bottom of the pit before night.

  “But I have reason to think that
the things are active in their under-
world at all hours of the day, emerg-
ing at night only because the mag-
netic vibration of sunlight interferes
with the operation of the delicate
machinery of their bodies.”

  We began to weave a rope of strips
of leather-like bark torn from the
mighty red trees. We kept at it until
we had many hundred feet of the
tough strands. As we worked Austen
began to talk a little, in a voice that
was very low and a little husky, of
his boyhood on a Western farm and
of the bright spots of his life.

  He told a few stories of his school
and college days, of the girl he had
loved and lost. But when the rope
was finished and coiled, he fell silent
again, and grimly examined his
automatic. He adjusted his pack, got
out his pipe and filled it with my
tobacco, and grinned. Then he said
soberly, “We are here. We are ready
to play our hand, to win or to lose.
And if we lose . . .”

  He thrust out his hand. I shook it.
and we walked on silently. We had
not gone more than a hundred yards
when the scarlet forest thinned and
we walked out on a level stretch of
bare white sand.

  Along the western side rose a dark
precipitous cliff like that over which
the silver fall plunged with a line of
red brush along the top. At its foot
was a great sloping bank of talus,
scattered with gigantic boulders.
The cliff and the lofty crimson forest
that rimmed the open space on the
other three sides seemed to reach
into the dusky purple of obscurity
of the low-hanging sky.

  Spaced irregularly about the
center of the flat were perhaps a
dozen low circular metal structures
—evidently the mouths of great
white metal tubes projecting from
the earth. From five of them dense
clouds of purple vapor were pouring.

WE LEFT the shelter of the
jungle and quickly approached
the nearest of the wells. The metal
curbing was about four feet high
around a circular pit some 20 feet in
diameter. We leaned over and looked
into it. The tube was lit faintly for
a few feet down the walls but we saw
no light toward the bottom.

  A faint humming sound came up
out of the darkness and I felt a
strong current of air flowing down
the tube. It was altogether stranger
and more terrible than I had an-
ticipated. I doubt that I could have
found the courage to descend. *‘Is
the rope long enough?” I whispered.

  “Yes,” he replied. “On the day I
discovered this place I dropped a
pebble in the well and timed its fall
with my watch. The depth is just
over five hundred feet.”

  I put the end of the cord over the
metal rim and paid it out until only
enough was left to hitch around my
body. With a smile of forced cheer-
fulness Austen looked to his pack,
knocked out the pipe and put it in
his pocket.

  “Winfield, my boy, I hope to see
you soon again,” he said. “It may
take only an hour or two to lay my
mine and return to the shaft.

  “You wait and hold the rope and
if I need to send you any message
I will jerk it three times and you
can pull it up. The note will tell
when to put it down again for me
to climb out. Good-by, my boy.
You—”

  He started to say something more

but his voice broke and he turned
abruptly to the well. I braced myself
against the curbing as he climbed
over and started down. I looked over
and watched him. In a few moments
his head and shoulders had shrunk
to a little blot against the darkness
of the well. Soon he was out of my
sight although for a long time I felt
the tugging of the rope.

  Suddenly the tension relaxed. He
had reached the bottom or—fearful
thought—he had lost his grip on
the rope and was hurtling downward
through the darkness. I listened in
an agony of suspense. It was several
minutes before I was reassured to
feel three twitches of the cord. I
pulled it up. On the end was tied a
piece of paper, with these words pen-
ciled upon it—

  Dear Winfield,—I hate to leave us
thus without warning you as I in-
tend, to do. But I could not tell you.
Go back, get Melvar and travel as
far as you can from this accursed
-place. May you and she survive and
lead a happy life together in here if
you cannot reach the world beyond.

  / will give you twenty hours. In'
that time you can go far north of
the,silver falls. I am sure that with
the equipment 1 now have I can ex-
plode one of the engines and send
all this part of the valley skyward—
if I live to carry out my plan. Good-
by,

                       Austen.

  Then I saw that he had been plan-
ning all along to give up his life.
The note had been written some time
before he left. I cursed the stupidity
that had kept me from perceiving
his intention. Dear old Austen! The
truest friend I ever had! His
smiling face, his kind blue eyes, his
low familiar voice, are gone forever!

CHAPTER XI
The Forest Aflame

1HAVE a very confused recollec-
tion of what happened immedi-
ately afterward. My own actions
 seem a vague disordered dream. My
 bitter grief at Austen’s self-sacrifice
 was the only thing real to me. I be-
 lieve I began carrying rocks from
 the boulder-strewn slope at the foot
 of the cliff with the idea of securing
 the rope to them so that I could go
 down in search for him.

   The first thing I remember clear-
 ly is that I was staggering back to
 the shaft with a heavy rock in my
 arms when I caught a whiff of acrid
 smoke and awoke to the realization
 that the purple sky was darkened
 with drifting clouds, the air already
 heavy with the suffocating pungent
 odor of burning red vegetation.

  I knew that, had the red-hot
 rocket-ship in which we had crossed
 the Silver Sea chanced to fall in the
 jungle instead of on the barren hill-
 top, a conflagration would have
 spread from it at once. Abruptly I
 remembered that the glowing frag-
 ments of the one we had wrecked
 had fallen in the northern forest.
 Austen’s cabin lay in that direction!
 I knew that the red vegetation was
 peculiarly inflammable, that the fire,
 fed on the oxygen of the heavy at-
 mosphere, would advance with ter-
 rible speed.

   For a moment, in a panic of in-
 decision, I listened. From the north
 I heard the crackling roar of a
 mighty conflagration. Then my mind
 was made up. Any attempt to find
 Austen and induce him to give up
 his plan of self-sacrifice would be
 terribly uncertain.

   Melvar was in immediate danger
 and I knew that Austen valued her
 life above his own. But even then I
 knew in my heart that it was too
 late, though I would not let myself
 believe it. Fire is a pitiless and re-
 morseless enemy.

   At a dead run I started up the
 trail by which we had entered the
 clearing. Even the smoke became
 thicker and more acrid while the
 crackling roar of the fire rang ever
 louder in my ears. I ran on through
 the ghastly gloom of the scarlet
 jungle in mad desperation even after
 hope was gone, until the hot suf-
 focating breath of the flames was

choking- me.

  The vast wall of flame swept for-
ward like a voracious demoniac
thing of crimson, implacable, ir-
resistible, overwhelming. It plunged
forward like a rushing tidal wave of
red. Already the fire had passed the
site of the cabin!

  I was suddenly hopeless and de-
spairing and very tired. The flames
rushed forward faster by far than a
human being could force a way
through the jungle. With the knowl-
edge that I had just lost the only
two beings that in all the world of
men ever mattered to me it hardly
seemed worth while to try to save
my own life.

  For a moment I stood there, about
to cast myself into the flames. But
it is not the nature of an animal to
die willingly no matter how slight
the promise of life may be.

HEN I could endure the heat no
longer, when the pain of my
blistered skin and the outcries of
my tortured lungs had grown un-
supportable, I turned and ran to-
ward the clearing again.

  My nostrils and lungs were seared
and smarting. The hot wind dried
my skin and left it scorched and
cracked. I was blinded by the smoke.
I longed to throw myself down and
seek the {emporary ecstasy of a
breath of clear air from near the
ground, of a cooling plunge into a
muddy pool. The red jungle reeled
about me but I fought my way on
like a man in a dream.

  At last I staggered into the open
space. The last of the giant trees
exploded into flames not a score of
yards behind me. Sparks rained
upon me. My clothing caught fire.
I ran on, fighting the flames with
my hands. The jungle back of me
roared deafeningly, an angry surg-
ing sea of lurid red flames.

  Heat radiation poured across
the clearing in a pitiless beam. I
struggled on across the white sand,
away from flames that tossed them-
selves up like volcano-ridden ranges
of scarlet alps, until I reached the
shelter of a great boulder on the
slope below the cliff.

  I flung myself down behind the
rock, gulping down the cool air and
rubbing out the fire in my clothing
with my blackened hands. For many
hours I lay there, tortured by thirst
and pain. At last I fell into a light
sleep of troubled dreams in which
huge winged green ants flew after
me through burning crimson forests
and in which I saw the dear form of
Melvar devoured again and again by
the flames.

  I was awakened after a time, I
know not how long, by a cool wind
that had sprung up from the north.
For a moment my mind was lost in
blank wonder, then came the deso-
late awareness that Melvar and
Austen were lost. In hopeless misery
I got weakly to my feet and walked
unsteadily around the boulder until
I could look across the clearing.

  As I leaned against the rock, gaz-
ing eastward, it was a strangely
altered and desolate scene that lay
before my eyes. The red forest was
gone. Below me was a region of
low rolling hills, black and grim be-
neath the lowering, smoky purple
sky.

  The white sand about me stood out
in sharp contrast to the charred and
gloomy waste beyond, from which a
few slender wisps of dark smoke
were still rising. All life was gone.
It was a dead world. But still the
dense purple clouds poured out of
the shafts of the underworld, adding
their weight to the dismal sky.

  A great homesickness for the
world and my fellow men came over
me. Then I heard a strange hum-
ming behind me and a slight metallic
clatter. I turned around in apathetic
curiosity.

  I came face to face with a monster
so utterly strange and terrible that
the very shock of it almost unseated
my wandering reason.

  At first I looked on the thing with
a curious lack of interest, as the
soul of one newly dead might look
with numbed faculties on his new
habitation. But as I looked upon it
an icy current of fear stole over me
like the creeping cold of the north.
I had met so many horrors that I had
begun to think myself immune. But

I had met no such thing as that.

  I knew that it was intelligent, a
sentient being. But it was not
human, not a thing of flesh and blood
at all. It was a machine! Or rather
it was in a machine, for I felt more
of it than I saw—a will, a cold and
alien intellect, a being, malefic, in-
human, inscrutable.

  It was a thing that belonged not
in the present earth but in the tomb
of the unthinkable past or beyond
the wastes of interstellar space amid
the inconceivable horrors of un-
known spheres.

 There was a bright gleaming
globe, three feet in diameter, lit
with vivid flowing fires of violet and
green. A strange swirling mist of
brilliant points of many colored
lights danced madly about it—a
coruscating fog of iridescent fire—
moving, flickering, in an incredible
rhythm.

THAT unearthly thing rested up-
on a frame of metal. It was the
head of a metallic monster. It
was set on an oblong box of white
metal to which were attached six
long-jointed metal limbs. The being
stood nine feet high at least.

  It was standing on three of the
limbs and holding my rifle, which I
had left where I had been, lying,
turning it and feeling of it with a
cluster of slender fingerlike tentacles
on the end of the metal arm. It
was working the mechanism of the
gun and apparently looking at it
though it had no eyes that I could
see.

  Suddenly the gun went off, throw-
ing up sand between me and the
monster. With a grotesquely half-
human attitude of alarmed surprise,
the being dropped the gun and
sprang back like a gigantic spider.
The motion freed me from my
paralysis of horror and I started
backing cautiously around the
bolder, afraid to run.

  As I moved it sprang forward and
a slender tube of white metal in one
of the tentacled hands was suddenly
pointed toward me. When the mon-
ster moved there was a humming

sound and little jets of purple gas
hissed from holes in the sides of the
boxlike body.

   I drew my automatic and fired at
the metal tube. I must have made
an unusually fortunate shot for the
object was carried out of the metal
grasp and fell spinning to the sand.
On the instant I turned and ran to-
ward another great boulder, as large
as a railroad locomotive, that lay
fifty yards to the north. As I ran
I heard the clatter and shirring of
the mechanical being. I paused at
the edge of the rock and took a last
glimpse back.

   The monster was holding the little
tube in one of the limbs and ap-
parently adjusting it with another.
Then it suddenly extended the thing
toward me. I dived behind the rock.
A bright ray of orange light shot
past the boulder—a beam like that
which had come from the being in
the door of the rocketship. Then I
knew that here was an entity of the
same kind as the one I had de-
stroyed that night—one of the ruling
intelligences of the crater, the Krim-
lu.

  For long moments I crouched
behind the boulder, expecting the
terrible being to come striding
around after me at any instant. But
it did not come, so presently I be-
gan to think. Perhaps the things
were not so powerful or so extremely
intelligent after all.

   I had killed one, even if it had been
 just by a chance shot in the dark.
 This one had seemed surprised, even
 alarmed, when the rifle went off
 and I supposed that a being so in-
 telligent as I had at first thought it
 to be might have inferred the nature
 and use of the weapon from its ap-
 pearance.

  And I thought that it must be
afraid of me after my pistol bullet
had knocked its own weapon out
of its grip or it would have followed
me around the boulder. Then I be-
gan to wonder what it was going to
do.

   It evidently intended to strike me
with the ray weapon. Not only did it
respect me but it knew that I stood
in deathly fear of it. It knew that I
was trying to escape, so it might
reasonably expect me to leave the
unscalable cliff and attempt to break
against the open country.

   And if I were to do that I would
naturally keep in the shelter of my
own boulder as long as possible. If
the monster thought it out that way
the logical thing for it to do would
be to creep out of the upper side of
its rock, where I would inevitably
come into its sight by whatever di-
rection I left my breastwork.

  Of course there was a frightful
risk in taking any action on such a
hypothesis—a greater risk than I
realized at the time. If the monster
were less intelligent than I supposed
I might blunder on it. If it were
more so it mio-ht have anticipated
my p’an—mis;ht trap me.

   But I crawled out along the upper
side of my boulder and peered over
a smaller rock which would serve
me as a breastwork, my automatic
ready. I expected to see the creature
within my range, intent upon my
other lines of retreat. But it was
not there. I thought I was doomed
but the orange ray did not strike
and I was forced to the conclusion
that the monster was not in a posi-
tion for action at all.

FOR a moment I was tempted to-
ward precipitate flight across the
clearing but I knew that such a move
would put me at the mercy of the
ray. I decided that it might not
yet be too late to carry out my
original plan. I lay flat, my gun
trained on the spot where I expected
it to appear. For perhaps fifteen
minutes nothing happened.

  Then my hypothesis proved to be
justified. The weird being suddenly
sprang into view, the strange
weapon grasped in its glittering
arm. It seemed to be looking beyond
my boulder. I was lying ready with
the automatic leveled. It was
matter of the merest instant to aim
at the green sphere and pull the
trigger.

   The globe was shattered as if it
were made of glass. Glittering frag-
ments showered off the metal box.

 The whole mechanical body suddenly
 became very rigid and fell heavily
 to the side. A puff of coruscating
 green mist floated out of the globe
 as it broke and swiftly dissipated
 and the sparkling lights were about
 the thing no more. The monster was
 evidently dead.

   For a few moments I hesitated but
 I was sure the thing had been killed
 and my curiosity got the better of
 my fear. I cautiously approached
 it. For a moment I marveled at the
 wonderful workmanship of the ma-
 chine, at the cleverness of its desire.
 Then I saw something that made me
 forget all else. Something beside the
 crystal shell had fallen.

   The tissue of it was very delicate
 and it had been broken by the fall, so
 that the body juices were running
 from it. The brain cavity was very
 large—perhaps larger than that of
 a man—covered only with a thin
 chitinous shell. The limbs were but
 thin tentacles, almost altogether
 atrophied.

   In fact, the brain seemed to be
 three-fourths of the total bulk. The
 body was so badly smashed that I
 could tell little about it but the tiny
 limbs were covered with chitin and
 there were the rudimentary stumps
 of fine tissue-like wings. There were
 no visible traces of digestive organs
 or of mandibles.

   The thing was plainly an insect.
 From just what species it had
 sprung in the long process of evolu-
 tion in the crater it would be diffi-
 cult to say. For several reasons I
 believe it was an ant. At any rate
 it had reached just about the ulti-
 mate stage of evolution. Machines
 had altogether replaced bodies of
 flesh and blood. I believe the thing
 had been nourished by the sparkling
 green vapor, which must have cir-
 culated like blood through the pro-
 tecting crystal sphere.

   It seems incredible to find great
 intelligence in any form of life other
 than human—but science thinks that
 life and intelligence must rise and
 fall in recurring cycles, that the
 Earth has probably been ruled by
 many different forms of life, each of
 which has been blotted out by some
cataclysm. The Krimlu were a sur-
viving remnant of archaic ages.

CHAPTER XII
When Austen Struck

1L0ST little time in the examina-
tion of the dead creature. The
shafts from which it had come were
but a few hundred yards below and
the purple gas was still rolling out
of the funnels. I did not know when
a second monster might appear.

  My mind was too much upset by
grief and terror to be capable of
intelligent planning but I knew I
wanted to get away from here and
I think I had some notion of reaching
the northern pass, of getting back
to an unburned growth of the red
vegetation for I was weak with
thirst and hunger. But all that was
very vague.

  I walked around the wells, keep-
ing at a distance, and struck out
for the east as fast as my wearied
limbs could carry me. Soon the cliff
was out of sight. All about was the
desolate, rolling black landscape,
with the gloomy purple sky over-
head. My thoughts were as dark
and sere as the world.

  When I had gone perhaps three
hours from the cliff and had almost
lost my fear of pursuit I saw a great
cigar-shaped object of gleaming
white on a low hill before me. So
dulled were my perceptions that it
was many minutes before I realized
that it was the rocketship in which
we had come over the Silver Sea.

  Then, with a faint thrill of hope,
the thought came to me that it was
still probably in a condition to fly
and that, if I could succeed in con-
trolling it, it offered a possible ave-
nue of escape from the crater.

  I walked up to the thick metal
walls. They seemed undamaged by
the fire. Of course, they were used to
withstanding the far higher tem-
peratures developed during flight.
I walked around the ship and was

surprised to see that the heavy metal
door, which we had left open, had
been swung shut.

  Lying against it was the charred
skeleton of a man. About the bones
were woven metal garments and
crystal armor that'I recognized with
a shock as Naro’s. So, I thought, the
fellow had deserted his beautiful
sister to seek the shelter of the
rocketship and had fallen a victim
to the flames at the last moment.

  For a moment I stared grimly at
the remains. Then, animated by a
sudden ray of hope, I sprang to the
door, pulled it open and leaped into
the ship. There, lying on the floor,
was the lovely form of Melvar. Her
clothing was tattered and smeared
with stains of red and black from
the burning forest but she was un-
harmed.

  It was almost incredible to me to
find her restored. I was half afraid
that my mind had failed at last and
that she was but an illusion. I
dropped on my knees beside her and
kissed her warm red lips. She stirred
a little and, still but half awake, put
a trustful arm about my shoulder.

  “Winfield, I knew you would
come,” she whispered at last. “But
where are Naro and Austen?”

  “They will never come,” I said.

  She drew me fiercely toward her,
as if to use me for a shield against
the awful truth. It was some time
before she was able to talk; but
presently she told me how Naro had
seen the smoke and how she had
thought of seeking shelter from the
fire in the rocketship. They had run
down the trail we had made as we
left the ship.

  The fire had overtaken them just
as they reached it. The boy had
carried her the last few yards, had
put her through the door, had then
been unable to enter himself. But, a
hero to the last, a worthy warrior
of old Astran, he had swung the
door shut with his dying motion.

PRESENTLY I turned my atten-
tion to the ship. The marvelous
periscope still gave the illusion that
the bow was transparent. When I
moved the little control lever the jets
of purple gas rushed out again. After
a time I had the vessel worked loose
from its place in the earth. Then,
once again, I pulled up the little
metal knob and pushed it forward.

  The blackened terrain was colored
by the purple mist. It was dimmed,
blurred, blotted out. We shot through
the purple cloud and plunged
abruptly into clear air and blessed
sunshine. Melvar stood by me, her
arm upon my shoulder. She cried
out gladly as we came into the light.

  It was not quite noon and the Sun
was shining brightly into the crater.
The crescent Silver Lake was still
gleaming with the same argent
luster and Astran shone like a great
gem set in the dark red upland
beyond.

  Suddenly the clouds of purple mist
below were thrown up and scattered
in a thousand ragged streamers. A
great blaze of opalescence burst out
where it had been. A flood of fire
ran over the Silver Sea. It was a
white milky lig-ht like that we had
seen between the blue crystal globes
to the great machine in the chasm.

  In a moment the whole crater was
a torn and angry ocean of iridescent
flame. The red upland was blotted
out and Astran vanished forever.
White flames that were like the
tongues of burning hydrogen that
burst from exploding suns flared up
behind us.

  Then we heard the sound of the
cataclysm—a crashing roar like the

Who Want To Write

but can't get started

Do you have that constant urge to write
but fear that a beginner hasn’t a chance ?
Then listen to what the former editor of
Liberty said on this subject:

"There is more room Ior newcomers in the writing field
today than ever before. Some oi the greatest of writing
men and women have passed from the scene in recent
years. Who will take their places? Who will be the new
Robert W. Chambers, Edgar Wallace, Rudyard Kipling?
Fame, riches and the happiness of achievement await the
hew men and women of power.”

SELLS FOLK ARTICLES AT
BEGINNING OF COURSE

"Before I had finished the third as-
signment, 1 sold four articles that
have brought in over twice the cost
of the complete course. Had anyone
told me when I began the N.I.A.
Course, that I could do that, I would
have considered them crazy.”—Wal-
ter F. Roper, 95 Benedict Terrace,

explosion. From our ever-rising
craft we could see the desert spread
out around the mountain like a vast
yellow sea, rimmed on the south
by a steely blue line that was the
ocean.

  The white fire dulled, faded and
was gone as quickly as it had flared
up. The crater of the Mountain of
the Moon was left a wild black ruin
of jagged scattered masses of smok-
ing stone. Of the Silver Lake, of
the red vegetation upon the upland,
of brilliant Astran, not a trace was
left!

  The crater was left far behind in
the long arching flight of the rocket.
The white frozen brilliance of the
stars faded out, the untold glories
of the solar corona were dimmed and
blue was restored to the midnight
sky. We were plunging toward the
desert in the direction of Kanowa. I
pulled back the lever and used the
full force of the rockets to check our
meteor-like flight until the fuel was
exhausted. A moment afterward we
struck the earth.

  We climbed out and left the vessel
there on the sand. Just as the stars
were coming out that night we ar-
rived at the headquarters of a great
sheep ranch. People were very much
excited over the earthquake. The
shock of the explosion of the Silver
Lake, we learned had been regis-
tered at every seismographic station
in the world.

  The rancher and his wife cared
for us with great hospitality, if ill-
controlled curiosity. After we had
had a week of rest they took us by
automobile to Kanowna. There I
astounded them by rewarding their
generosity with a magnificent
emerald—I still had in my pack a
half pound or so of jewels that Naro
had brought me from Astran.

  Melvar ever surprised me with
her innocent beauty, her grace and
poise, with the ease with which she
learned to face new situations and
to meet people. I believe that no one
ever suspected that she had not had
a lifetime of training in the best of
society. We were married at
Kanowna and reached Perth a few
days later.

about this new way:

“For ten years my teeth wouldn’t stay
tight for more than two hours a day. I
tried powders, but nothing worked till
your new cream, Poli-Grip, came along.”
Mrs. T. W., Medfield, Mass.
“I like the cool taste of Poli-Grip and
the smooth way it holds my teeth. It is
easy to apply and holds tight for so long.”
Mrs. L. W. N., Ottumwa, Iowa
“I found your new cream, Poli-Grip, very
pleasant and mild-tasting and it held my
loose plates very tight, longer than any-
thing I’ve tried.”

    Mrs. H. D. M., Beadentown, Florida
“I like the wonderful holding strength
of your new cream better than anything
I’ve ever used. I like Poli-Grip’s refresh-
ing taste, too.”

          H. B. V., East Canaan, Conn.
“I definitely prefer Poli-Grip to other
products I’ve tried. It holds my plate
tightei a-5I feels comfortable longer. Poli-
Grip is cooling, soothing, never gritty.”

Turnabout

A Short Short Story

By WILL GARTH

FIVE of the men in the great room sat
quietly, staring apprehensively at the
metal cylinder resting on the chromium
table. The sixth man, old Harvey Harris,
stood by the window, his eyes shut, thought-
ful.

  Lean, gray-haired Dr. Samuels broke the
silence. “Gentlemen,” he began, his tones
crisp, “it has been two weeks since the dis-
appearance of our colleague, Hugo Stone.
Stone is the world’s greatest expert on
atomics and it is a certainty that without
him we can never complete our machine for
delving to the center of the Earth. And
they're asking a million dollars in radium
for his release—radium which we have but
which we need to drive our Borer!"

  As Dr. Samuels went on, discussing the
kidnaping, Harvey Harris scowled somber-
ly. Suppose it were he who had disap-
peared. Would his associates be as gravely
concerned ? He wondered, frowned. He was
only a mathematician and could easily be
replaced. He knew why he had been allowed
to work with the combine. They were sorry
for him. Five years ago a laboratory ex-
plosion had almost killed him. They had let
him stay on, sympathetic. But rarely had
they given him any work.

  Harris shrugged his frail frame. Yes, if
he had disappeared, the only one who would
miss him would he his faithful assistant,
Connors. Understanding Connors, who took
all his dictation, even read aloud to him
about the wonders of the heavens. For
astronomy was Harris’ hobby.

  Samuels was still speaking. “This cyl-
inder landed on Earth yesterday, its con-
tents a strip of movie filni which proves
that the efforts of the Interplanetary Po-
lice are in vain . . . that Stone is captive
on a space ship past Saturn. How the kid-
napers were able to get out that f«r in two
weeks, I don’t know. Pursuit is hopeless
for it would take our fastest ship about a
month to reach that vicinity. It’s bad news,
just when we had a tip that Stone was be-
ing held captive on Earth's Moon!”

  As Dr. Samuels motioned to an attend-
ant, the lights dimmed and a movie pro-
jector snapped on, its image cast on the
great white walls. First the men saw Earth
receding in space. Then the familiar firma-
ment.

  From the sound-track came the kid-
naper’s voice, his tones disguised.

  “We’re nearing Saturn . . _. You can see,
by the relative position of Jupiter as seen
from Titan, one of Saturn’s moons, that
we have your man somewhere around
here.” Then came a close-up of Stone, his
features imploring.

  “That’s right," cried Samuels. “You can
see several of Saturn’s moons sweeping
past to the right, like metal balls to a mag-
net. Rhea, Tethys, Hyperion, Phoebe—did
you see them all scoot by? Stone is out
there all right and we'd better pay up!”
But Harvey Harris interrupted. “I
wouldn’t advise doing so, Samuels,” he said
quietly. “The Police are probably right and
I wager they’ll find Stone on our own
Moon. Examine that movie film closely and
you’ll discover it’s a clever fake, manufac-
tured with miniature models. Those pictures
were never taken in space!”

  “What ? Didn’t we see the moons—”
“Yes,” continued old Harris. “But the
kidnapers made one mistake. You said you
saw all the moons speeding in one direction
past Titan. But any astronomer will tell
you that nine of Saturn’s moons revolve
one way—normally. But the tenth—Phoebe
—revolves in retrograde transit in the op-
posite direction from the others. Our kid-
napers forgot that simple little fact!” Say-
ing so Harris reached for the door. He
smiled wistfully to himself. Old, was he ?
Useless? Thank God he knew his astron-
omy.

  Dr. Samuels turned to the other mem-
bers of his staff. “Ironic, men, isn’t it,” he
said slowly, “that we who have eyes didn’t
se^ what Harris—blind since that explosion
—realized in a moment. Maybe we’ve been
blind for five years . .

The Mechanism of~Mind

WHY YOU ARE AS YOU ARE-

and What J/ou (2a.n *Po -Qltout Ut!

DID you ever stop to think why you do
the things you do? Have you often—
when alone—censored yourself for impul-
sive urges, for things said or done that did
not truly represent your real thoughts,
and which placed you at a disadvantage?
Most persons are creatures of sensa-
tion—they react to instinctive, impelling
influences which surge up within them and
which they do not understand—or know
how to control. Just as simple living
things involuntarily withdraw from irri-
tations, so likewise thousands of men and
women are content to be motivated by
their undirected thoughts which haphaz-
ardly rise up in their consciousness. Today
you must sell yourself to others—bring
forth your best abilities, manifest your
personality, if you wish to hold a position,

make friends, or impress others with your
capabilities. You must learn how to draw
upon your latent talents and powers, not
be bent like a reed in the wind. There are
simple, natural laws and principles which—
if you understand them—make all this
possible.

Fof centuries the Rosicrucians (not a religious or-
ganization), a worldwide movement of men and
women devoted to the study of life and its hidden
processes, have shown thousands how to probe these
mysteries of self. Renowned philosophers and scien-
tists have been Rosicrucians—today men and wo-
men in every walk of life owe their confidence and
ability to solve personal problems to the Rosicrucian
private, sensible method of self-development. Send
today for a copy of the book, “The Mastery of Life,”
which will be sent to you without obligation. It will
tell you of the Rosicrucians and what they can
do for you. Address: Scribe Y. B. J.

THREE husky and very choice stories fill
up the bulk of our annual anthology for
1951—and come close to blanketing the
entire field of science fiction. One of them—
our novel—TWICE IN TIME by Manly
Wade Wellman, is as its title reveals, a tale
of time-travel. Jack Williamson’s short novel,
THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE, is a lost-
world epic—while Eando Binder’s novelet,
THE CHESSMEN OF MARS, is a saga of
space-travel.

  Time travel—lost world—space travel—these are the very
warp and woof of which science fiction is manufactured. And
each is cut out of toploom fabric and woven cunningly and with
great style. Mr. Wellman’s novel, along with its fine science
fiction offering, gives the reader a further bonus in the form of a
vivid and learned picture of one of the most exciting eras in the
human past—the Italian Renaissance.

  Mr. Williamson had his imagination turned on full blast when
he composed THE ALIEN INTELLIGENCE—and the result
is a high-tension story whose color and clarity of description and
action make it horrifyingly real. And the Binders plotted their
novelet with all of the shrewdness and talent that kept them for
so many years up near the top of the science fiction totem pole.

  Rather than run a miscellany of shorter stories of varying
quality we have decided to publish these three longer stories
unabridged, as they are just about the best in their particular
fields of science fiction. WONDER STORY ANNUAL, we are
glad to say, is ready to take its proper place, where quality is con-
cerned, in line with its three older companions, THRILLING
WONDER STORIES, STARTLING STORIES and FAN-
TASTIC STORY MAGAZINE.

  We wish you good reading in all of them.

TIME travel stories
are probably as
old as science fic-
tion itself—which
means they go back
approximately to the
ark. In their more
primitive forms the
protagonist or hero is
usually sent into the
future, there to fore-
tell what lies ahead,
both for himself and the reader.

  The desire to know whether war will or
will not come next week, whether that
nag will cop the sixth at Hialeah or what
Amalgamated Zinc is going to do on tlie
market is a human universal.

  However, in its more sophisticated pat-
tern the time-travel tale usually denies
such acquisitive yearnings by moving into
the far more intricate and exciting pattern
of the past. Here a number of questions
must be faced and answered which give
pause to all but the ablest of story
weavers.

  For instance, if the past has happened,
how can its pattern be changed without
alteration of past and present alike? What
occurs when a time-traveler encounters
his younger self or his parents and an-
cestors? And, lastly, if any persons have
traveled from the future into our his-
torical past—why don't we know about
it?

 In one way or another—always cred-
ibly, always with that apparent easy fluid-
ity which is the invariable sign of the fine
professional—Mr. Wellman meets all the
above challenges in what is, to us, just
about the most stirring storv of its type we
have ever read—TWICE IN TIME! This
is one story of time-travel that, instead of
being limited by its gadgetrv, achieves
the full-bodied richness of the Renaissance
itself.	—The Editor.

hope of helping- war sufferers if his
aid should be needed. But since Italy
remained neutral, he sent back most
of his luggage to America by a
friend.

   Later he sent an urgent letter, ask-
ing that this manuscript be exam-
ined and published if possible. It
came, Father Sutton said, from the
strongroom of an immemorial theo-
logical library in Florence and was
in the original casket that had ap-
parently contained it for a long
period of time.

  The priest’s friend brought -us
both Father Sutton’s letter and the
casket with the manuscript. This
casket is of tarnished silver, elabo-
rately worked in the Renaissance
manner. A plate on the lid bears
this legend, in Italian, French and
Latin:

  Let no man open or dispose of this
casket, on peril of his soul, before the
year 1939.

  Father Sutton’s New York friends
insist that if he actually wrote the
letter and sent the casket they may
be taken at face value. If it is a hoax
perpetrated in his name it is both
elaborate and senseless. In any ease
it is worth the study of those who
love the curious.

  Therefore, while neither aifirming
nor denying the truth of what ap-
pears, herewith is given in full the
purported statement of the vanished
Leo Thrasher.

CHAPTER I

Tomasulo’s Inn

THIS story, as unvarnished as I
can make it, must begin where my
twentieth-century life ends in the
sitting room of the suite taken by
George Astley and myself at Toma-

12
sulo’s inn, on a hill above the Arno.
It is the clearest of all my clouded
memories of that time. April was
the month, still chilly for Tuscany,
and we had a charcoal fire in the
grate. I knelt among my dismantled
machinery, before the charcoal fire,
testing the connections here and
there.

  “So that’s your time-traveler,
Thrasher?” said Astley. “Like the
one H. G. Wells wrote about?”

  “Not in the least like the one H. G.
Wells wrote about,” I said spiritedly
and not pel’haps without a certain
resentful pride. “He described a
sort of century-hurdling mechanical
horse. In its saddle you rode for-
ward into the Judgment Day or
back to the beginning. This thing
of mine will work but as a reflector.”

T PEERED into the great cylindri-

*	cal housing that held my lens, a
carefully polished crystal of alum
more than two feet in diameter. I
smiled with satisfaction.

  “It won’t carry me into time,” I
assured. “It’ll throw me.”

  George leaned back in the easy
chair that was too small for him.
“I don’t understand, Leo,” he con-
fessed. “Tell me about it.”

  “All right—if 1 must,” I said. I
had told him so often before. It
was a bore to have to repeat what a
man seemed incapable of under-
standing. “The operation is com-
parable to that of a burning-glass,”

I	explained patiently, “which in-
volves a point of light and transfers
its powers through space to another
position. Here”—I waved toward
the mass of mechanism—“is a de-
vice that will involve an object and
transfer or rather relate it to an-
other epoch in time.”

least enough to think of time as an
