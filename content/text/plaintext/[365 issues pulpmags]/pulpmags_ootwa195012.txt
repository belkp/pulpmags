CHAPTER I—The Incurables of Ceres

ATIMER stumbled
 heavily and fell from
 the ramp to the
 frozen rocks. His
 hand went automati-
 cally to his belt. But
 the spacesuit he was
 wearing had no belt.

neither had it the holster and the pis-
tol that for so long had seemed part
of himself. Weaponless, Latimer lay
where he had fallen, snarled wordless-
ly at the guard whose farewell shove
had caused him to lose his balance, at
the vast bulk of Charon like some
dark tower blotting out the stars.
SOLAR FRONTIER

By A. BERTRAM CHANDLER

Only one group of defenders stood between Earth
and the black marauder from the depths of space
—and that was Alan Latimer's tiny planet of exiled
criminals, unarmed, despised and burning
for their own private vengeance.

  For long minutes he lay there. He
was aware that the airlock door in
Charon's side had shut, that the tele-
scopic ramp had retracted to its re-
cess in the shell plating, and knew
that it would not be long before the
main drive of the prison ship seared
the rocks that were his comfortless
couch with all-consuming fire. But

he did not care. To a man such as he
the merciful penal laws of his tim&
held little of mercy. Better, he told
himself, a quick, clean death than a
long lifetime lived out among the In-
curables of Ceres. He looked at the
stars and waited for what, at worst,
would be only a microsecond of
agony.

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

  Somebody's clumsy, gloved hands
were tugging at the sleeve of his suit.
Somebody was trying to pull him to
his feet. He did not shift his gaze
from the glittering stars, but he
spoke, his voice strange and tinny in
his own helmet phones.

  “Get away from here/* he said.
Then, more urgently: “Get away
from here, you fool! Don't you know
that the ship will be blasting off at
any moment?"

  The other made no reply, but the
insistent tugging continued. Ac-
tuated by rage rather than by any
urge towards self preservation Lati-
mer started to scramble to his feet.
Even to himself his motives were
not clear—but his hands in their
thick gloves tingled with anticipa-
tion of the stinging blows that would
send this meddler scurrying back to
the safety of the airlock under the
brow of the low cliff.

  Then the stranger spoke. It was a
low voice, softly husky, well modu-
lated—and even the inevitable dis-
tortions of the helmet phones could
not disguise its magical qualities.
Neither could they conceal the un-
dertones compounded of despair, and
misery, and resignation.

  “Perhaps you are right," Latimer
heard. “Perhaps you are wise. Per-
haps your action—our action—will
encourage others to follow suit when
Charon comes again. And then this
little world will be the poorer by so
many little, personal Hells. And that
will be good."

  It was a low voice, and a softly
husky voice, and it held within itself
a honeyed sweetness that had long
been lacking from the world of Alan
Latimer. Not that his world had been
in any way drab or dreary. It had
been a good world—harsh, perhaps,
but not lacking the bright color of
new faces, fresh scenes, the explosive
flares of excitement and danger.

  la his world as it had been it is
possible that such a voice, uncon-

sciously intimate, full of unspoken
promises, would have failed to stir
him. But within the narrow compass
of this new world, this world that he
had made for himself, or that the
peculiar, inimitable combination of
genes that came from his parents,
and from their parents, had made for
him, the voice promised a light, a
color, that must be sadly lacking
from the days to come. Or it could
have been that it brought back mem-
ories of a still older world, a plane
of existence in which there were
other realities than the harsh, turbu-
lent life of the frontiers, the flare of
rocket drive against the stars, and the
stars themselves, sharp, crystalline,
with no kindly atmospheric veil be-
tween their hard brilliance and his
eyes.

  “No!" he heard himself shouting.
“We're alive—and we stay that way!
Come on!"

  He was on his feet now. He rough-
ly disengaged himself from the
clumsy paw that was still clutching
the right sleeve of his armor, put out
his own gloved hands to grasp the
shoulders of the girl. He did not stop
to examine the face that he could
dimly see within the transparent
bubble of the helmet. He swung her
so that she was facing away from
him and then, clumsy in his haste,
rushed her towards the safety of the
low cliff and the airlock. He hoped
desperately that the officers of
Charon would be looking down from
Control, that they would see that the
field was not yet clear for blasting
off.

THEY were still a score of yards
from the shelter when Charon*s
pilot depressed his firing key. Had
Ceres possessed an external atmos-
phere the roar of the blast might
well have deafened them for life. As
it was their senses registered a
blinding, intolerable light that
seemed to strike clear through their
RAIDERS OF THE SOLAR FRONTIER

skulls to the retina. The ground be-
neath them shook, and the wave of
incandescent gases that was volatil-
ized rock lifted them and cast them
from it. In spite of the insulation of
their suits they felt the scorching
fury of the blast. Had it not been for
the insulation they would have been
burned to a crisp. And the force with
which they were flung to the ground
stunned them.

  Alan Latimer was first to recover.
He staggered to his feet, putting one
hand out to the cliff face for support.
Blood tasted salt in his mouth and
there was a warm trickle from his
nostrils. He disregarded it—attired
as he was there was nothing else that
he could do—and blinked to clear his
befogged eyes. He looked up, saw
Charon, a fast waning star among
the stars, another spot of light among
the countless millions.

  For a while he watched her, his
heart going out with her, revisiting
in memory all the ports and cities
that he would never again see. It was
not until the girl stirred, striking
feebly with her arm against his
booted foot, that he bethought him-
self of her and her safety. He
stooped, then, awkward in the stiff
articulations of his armor, and picked
her up. He strode the few short paces
to the airlock, dull silver against the
rugged black of the cliff. With little
of evident tenderness he lowered her
to the rocks, fumbled for the controls
to the right of the entrance. When
the outer door opened he dragged
the girl into the little compartment.
Already he was beginning to resent
the fact that, wittingly or unwitting-
ly, she had balked his plans for a
swift, clean suicide.

  Pressures equalized, the inner door
opened, and he passed through into
the ante-chamber beyond. Dimly, he
heard the rattle of armor as he let
the girl fall from a semi-sitting pos-
ture to one that was lifelessly supine.
He snapped open the visor of his

helmet, took his first breath of the
air of the notorious prison world of
Ceres.

“OO YOU made it after all,” re-

  O	marked the little man behind the
big desk, disinterestedly. “You
wouldn’t V been the first. There’s
many a poor sap gone out that way
-—an’ thought that he was bein’ hell-
ish clever.”

 “So you knew?" demanded Lati-
mer.

 Big, menacing, he regarded the
grey, clerkish keeper of the gate. He
was ready to resent the fact that
these people had known of his at-
tempted suicide, had made no effort
to prevent it. Then he remembered
that it had been an inhabitant of
Ceres who had pulled him back into
the world of the living—and that she
had received scant thanks for so do-
ing. The dangerous flare died in his
pale eyes, the hard lines of his deep-
ly tanned face softened. With clumsy
haste he dropped to his knees, flung
open the visor of his rescuer’s hel-
met.

  “And she knew, too,” chuckled the
little clerk. “If I hadn’t let her see
the advance copy of Charon's passen-
ger list she’d never ’a’ gone outside.
But as soon as all the passengers
were tallied in but one—an’ that one
Lieutenant Alan Latimer—nothin*
nor nobody could stop her. . . .”

  All this Latimer half heard as he
stripped the clumsy armor from the
body of the girl. The clerk rattled
on, then almost fell over backwards
in panic as Latimer rose to his feet,
reached out with one big hand. But
it was only the gaudy silk handker-
chief protruding from the little man’s
pocket that he was wanting. And
when he had it he returned at once
to the unconscious girl, began wip-
ing away the trickle of blood that
was still oozing from the corner of
her mouth, that had gushed in a
stream from her nostrils. Then—
8

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

 “Fetch some cold water I" he
barked.

 The other hastened to obey. His
grumbling monotone as he did so was
faintly audible, irritating.

 “Don't know why she bothered.
Don't know why he's bothering.
We're free on Ceres. If folks want
to die, we let 'em, . . .”

 “You! What’s your name?"

  “Marcus." Then, reluctantly, “sir."

 “And what are you here for?"

  The little clerk's voice was sullen.

 “Forgery. Embezzlement.”

 “And you know what I'm here for.
So, keep quiet unless you’re spoken
to."

 And in the silence that followed
Latimer completed his superficial ex-
amination of the girl. He worked
deftly, mechanically, assured himself
that no bones were broken, and all
the time the conscious part of his
mind was bitterly regretting that
he had not held her there with him
to die in the blast of Charon's jets.
The voice had stirred faint chords
in his memory, but he had assured
himself that it was imagination. Now
that he could see the woman herself,
shocked disbelief had rapidly given
place to shocked credulity. The
figure, true, was fuller, with more
than a hint of blowsiness. But the
crudest change had been that in the
face. Nobody could deny that Laur-
anne Towers was still beautiful. But
the mouth that had always been a
little too large, too full-lipped, was
now frankly sensual. The fresh
charm that he had known so long
ago in Port Gregory was now the
dangerous allure of the unashamed
wanton.

 Latimer dipped the handkerchief
afresh into the cold water that Mar-
cus had brought. Again he bathed the
pallid face of the woman. She moaned
and stirred. Slowly the heavy-lidded
eyes opened, stared darkly at the
anxious face of the ex-lieutenant.

  “Alan. I couldn’t believe it when I

saw your name on the passenger list.
I couldn't believe it, until I saw you
sprawled on the rocks, waiting for
Charon to blast off. . . ."

  “I’m afraid it’s true, Laurie. . . .”

  “My dear. I don't know whether
to be glad or sorry. It would have
been nice to have died with you out
there. ... It can still mean some-
thing to us if we live together. . . ."

  “We can go outside and open the
visors of our helmets," whispered
Latimer bitterly. “It would be best
that way. Otherwise, for you, a mur-
derer. For me. . . ."

  “Alan! Don't!"

 “We can go outside. Where we
have been, you and I, since those days
in Port Gregory the devil alone
knows. But we can share the jour-
ney’s end. » . ."

  “I’m not stopping you!" cackled
Marcus. “You’re free, Lieutenant.
You’re on Ceres. The only laws are
the laws you make yourself!”

  “And here’s one that I’m making
now. And that is, get out of our sight
at once!”

  “You can’t. . . ."

  “I’ve killed two men, one with my
bare hands. Better men than you.
So. ..."

WHEN Marcus had gone Laur-
anne rose unsteadily to her
feet. She sat in the chair behind the
desk that the little forger had va-
cated. From a pocket in her dress
she produced a mirror and a compact,
and with a hand that hardly trembled
began to repair the ravages wrought
upon her complexion by the events
of the past half hour. When she had
finished she opened the top drawer
of the desk, brought out a bottle, two
glasses, a box of cigarettes.

 Latimer was grateful for the
smoke, for the stiff slug of good
whiskey. But, sitting on the desk, he
did not like what he saw as he looked
down at Lauranne. He did not like
the way in which she tossed down her
RAIDERS OF THE SOLAR FRONTIER

drink, refilled her glass immediately.
He looked down, and the look on his
harsh face could not be mistaken for
anything else but disapproval.

 “Cheer up, Alan darling. We’re
here, both of us. For life. So—better
make the best of it.”

  “Yes. And well start like this.”

 He reached down, snatched the
glass from the girl’s hand, hurled it
and its contents against the further
wall. It did not break but fell down
the metal surface with almost ludi-
crous slowness. The trickle of whis-
key reached the floor only a second
after what had been its container.
And the sombre, chastened mood that
had been driven away from the girl
by the warmth of the spirits re-
turned. She got up slowly from the
chair, the utmost dejection in every
10

OUT OF THIS WORtD ADVENTURES

drooping line of her figure. With
slow, dragging steps she walked to-
ward the airlock door.

  “Where are you going ?”

  “What does it matter? Outside.”
Latimer waited until her hand went
out to the controls of the inner door,
then jumped down from his seat. Two
long strides—almost leaps in the
feeble gravitational field of Ceres—
carried him to Lauranne. As before
his hands went out to grasp her
shoulders, but this time it was - to
turn her to him. And the pale, blond
head of the man went down to that
of the woman, was enveloped in the
blacl? mist of her hair. For long sec-
onds they stood thus and then, gen-
tly, Latimer led Lauranne back to the
desk, seated her in the chair behind
the massive piece of furniture. He
himself remained standing.

  “You were right the first time,” he
admitted at last. “We must live, I
don’t know why, but in each other
we have something. ...”

  “Something,” whispered the girl,
raising her tear-stained face. “Some-
thing. A pale shadow of our former
lives. Don't lie to me Alan—for you,
I can never replace the surge of an
accelerating ship, the flare of rocket
drive against the stars, the ordered
routine of your little world of grey
paint and burnished metal. For you,
more than for me, this is the end of
the trip. This is that last haven of
which Swinburne sang:

*■ "There go the loves that wither,

  The old loves with wearier wings;

   And alt dead years draw thither,

   And all disastro'us things;

  Dead dreams of days forsaken,

   Blind buds that snows have shaken.

   Wild leaves that winds have taken,

   Red strays of ruined springs. ..."

  Latimer pulled thoughtfully at his
cigarette. Thoughtfully he watched
the smoke, watched it as though its
spirals and convolutions held the
6ecret of the Universe, The girl

looked up at him, her face yearning,
hurt that she should be ignored.

 At last Latimer looked down, his
lips beginning to move. If he had
been given the time to speak, his
words must inevitably have been
drowned by the trampling of heavy-
booted feet along the corridor out-
side. His hand was a rapid blur as it
flashed towards the holster that no
longer hung at his side. Then, moving
fast, he bundled Lauranne off the
chair behind the desk, picked it up
so that it could, if need be, be used
as a weapon.

  The door crashed open.

CHAPTER II
Boss of the Exile World

YOU make your own laws,”

 O	said Kimball. He leaned well
back in the chair that was almost a
throne, picked his teeth thought-
fully with a wooden toothpick from
the little vase on the table by his
right hand. Latimer, watching him
intently, was repelled by the man’s
grossness, his untidy, slovenly attire,
but was impressed by the aura of
very real power that surrounded the
Boss of Ceres.

 Kimball spat the little chewed
fragments of wood falling in a fine
spray around the cuspidor at his feet.

  “So our little friend Marcus told
you that we were all anarchists,” he
sneered.

  “I never said so.” Latimer’s voice
was firm, uncompromising.

 “I know you didn’t. But I know
Marcus. They allow me to have a few
little machines to play with, Latimer.
I've got a lie detector. But I never
trouble to use it on people like you.
I know your type, you won’t talk
until you feel like it And then you’ll
tell the truth. Maybe not the whole
truth, but, nevertheless, nothing but
the truth. And I can use men like
you. I can trust men like you.”
JtAlDERS OF THE SOLAR FRONTIER

  “Thank you. And the alternative?"

  “Nothing too bad. You become an
ordinary citizen of Ceres. Which
means that you have a sufficiency of
fresh air and food and artificial sun-
light. Which means that you will be
allowed to potter around with any of
the footling arts and crafts that are
encouraged here. Which means that
you’re liable to be beaten up at any
time that my police see fit."

  The room, with its luxurious ap-
pointments, blurred before Latimer's
eyes. Fists clenched, he started for-
ward. On either side of him a guard
clutched his arm, another struck him
across the mouth with a hard hand.
Faint and far away he heard the
voice of Lauranne. “Don’t,” she was
saying. “Don’t be a fool, Alan!”

  And the words served only to stir
him to fury. His right arm lifted,
lifting with it the man who was cling-
ing to it. It swung across his body in
a swift arc and the guard at his left
hand was felled by the club that the
other’s body had become. The guard
who had struck him went down, the
lower half of his face bloody and
curiously blurred. It was not until
later that Latimer felt the pain in his
broken knuckles.

  But there were too many of the
guards. They fell upon him from all
corners of the room, they bore him
down with the weight of their bodies.
And there was the sharp clicking of
steel on steel, and the kiss of cold
metallic bands on Latimer’s feet and
ankles, and when they pulled him to
his feet he tottered there, unable to
move.

  There followed seconds of useless
straining at the handcuffs, the leg-
irons. Then the bloody haze before
Latimer’s eyes slowly faded, and
through the thinning mists he saw
the flabby, paradoxically strong face
of the Boss. Kimball had one fat
hand upraised in a demand for si-
lence.

 “Hear me out," he was saying

almost plaintively. “You, of all per-
sons, must know the heed for dis-
cipline. If what I hear of you is true
your crimes were no more than strict
enforcement of discipline. And yet
you seek to hamper my poor efforts
to bring law and order to this law-
less little world.

  “Think well, Latimer. What would
Ceres be were it not for some or-
ganized body to enforce certain
standards of law and decency? Per-
haps my rule is not democratic—but,
I ask you, have we the raw materials
of democracy here? I will be frank
with you. Back on Earth I wanted
too much power, and I wasn’t overly
particular in the methods I used to
get it. I was apprehended once, psy-
choed and warned. But they couldn’t
change me. I was apprehended a sec-
ond time—one of my underlings was
both jealous and ambitious. And this
time I was classified as an Incurable.

  “And here, on Ceres, I still want
power. And still I'm not particular
about the methods I use to get it."

  “So I see."

  “Now you are being foolish. What
would have happened to you if you
had been brought before one of your
Admirals and attempted to assault
him? And they rule only squadrons
of ships. I rule a world."

  Latimer forebore to make unkind
comparisons between the size and the
striking power of those same squad-
rons and that of Kimball's domain.
He only said shortly:

  “All right, I'll play ball. What's
in it for me if I come in with you?"

  “Membership in my police force—
with prospects of promotion. This
carries the right to first choice of
the comforts and luxuries brought by
Charon. The right to marry whom
you please.”

  “Marry?"

 When Latimer heard Lauranne's
little gasp—-more of hurt than indig-
nation—he was sorry that he had not
been able to keep the amused in-
12

credulity out of his voice. But Kim-
ball, his tone unchanged, continued:
“Yes, marry. We are a very moral
people, Latimer. There are those, of
course, who are not moral, but unless
they offend against public decency
no action is taken against them. But
as one of the governing class you
will be expected to respect the laws
that you, yourself, will enforce.”
“Law and order,” said Latimer
musingly. “Here, on Ceres. Take off
these damned irons, Kimball, and I'll
sign your articles or whatever you
call them.”

  Kimball motioned to the guards,
one of whom produced a key.

  “And, in future, call me ‘Boss/ ” he
warned. “And you, Constable Mer-
rick, rustle up a copy of the contract
so that Constable Latimer can sign.
While you’re about it bring along a
marriage license. We’ll tie this fel-
low up in more ways than one!”

THERE was something wrong
with the park. It was not the
grass, neither was it the gorgeous
flowers; their equal would have been
hard to find anywhere on any of the
inhabited worlds. It was not the cav-
ern roof that arched far overhead—
that was lost in a dim blue haze from
which streamed the health-giving
rays of the big sun lamps. It could
almost have been the sky of Earth
in misty mood.

 Constable Alan Latimer stared
about him, barely conscious of the
light pressure on his arm that was
Lauranne Latimer's hand. But she,
ever conscious of him, read his
thoughts.

  “No children,” she said. “That is
what is wrong.”

  And the man looked about him at
the wide expanse of green lawn, at
the sedately strolling couples, young,
middle-aged, old, and saw that she
was right. It was all too orderly,
unnaturally quiet. He realized with
a sudden pang that, in all proba-

bility, the only happy man was the
bent, grey gardener who was work-
ing with slow and loving patience in
a bright flower bed near by.

  Gently he disengaged his arm from
his wife’s light grasp, raised it so
that it fitted about her waist. They
strolled on, enjoying the feel of the
smooth, velvety grass under their
bare feet, listening to the songs of
the birds that were such a poor sub-
stitute for the joyous clamor of chil-
dren at play.

  “That has always seemed to me to
be crudest of all,” he mused. “The
sterilization law.”

 “But it’s kind, my dear. You
couldn’t bring up children in a penal
colony. Whether or not their hered-
ity was unsound they, themselves,
would grow up to be criminal types.
And if they were taken from us at
an early age and sent to Earth for
their upbringing, that would be
crueler still. For us.”

  “Perhaps you are right. But I know
Ceres better now. And it wouldn’t be
a bad world in which to rear chil-
dren. No worse than many another.”
“As it is now. But we are fortunate
in our Boss. Broderick, before him,
called himself King. And he was mad
and bad. Then there was a long pe-
riod of anarchy, which was worse
than ever the rule of King Broderick
had been. Kimball wants power and
is quite ruthless, but he uses his
power well. The man who follows
him—who can tell? He may be strong
and bad; he may be weak and good—
which will be worse.”

  The two walked on in silence.
“You know,” admitted Latimer,
“this is not bad. This world, I mean.
I have you. I was a fool, my dear,
ever to lose touch with you after I
sailed from Port Gregory. But I was
young then—and the Service was
wife and parents and children. But I
am glad that I have found you again.
If only it could have been some other
way. .. .”

  “What did happen? I've respected
the privacy of youf past, Alan, just
as you’ve respected mine. But. ... A
woman is always curious, I guess."

  “It will do no harm to tell you.
The first time was when I was second
in command of Pathfinder. We were
on a survey job, measuring, charting,
along with a spot of geology, in the
Belt. It was the other side of the Sun
from Ceres. Well, the charts we had
weren’t too accurate—and one day
we found ourselves in one of those
jams that it would be almost impos-
sible for the finest mathematician in
the System to duplicate on paper.
We were on a collision orbit with no
less than half a dozen hunks of as-
sorted cosmic debris, and there was
no way out. The automatic controls
just blew all their fuses and died.

  “Some didn’t get into their suits in
time, we never had a chance to get a
message away, and in the finish there
were five survivors in our number
two boat, with myself in charge.

 “The way things were, the best
policy was to put ourselves on the
Earth-Jupiter lane and wait until
Thunderqueen came along. It was a
long wait, and long before she was
due, long before we could raise her
on our lifeboat transmitter, tempers
were wearing very thin. And we were
hungry all the time—have you ever
tried to make a meal of food concen-
trates? The nourishment is there, the
protein and the calories and the vita-
mins. But there’s no bulk. You’re
always hungry. And the boat was
cramped, and we were all in each
other’s way, and we hated each
other.

  “And then, during my sleep period,
one of the technical ratings, a fellow
named Burton, tried to raid the food
locker. I woke up, and we fought. I
fought a little harder than was nec-
essary, but once I got my fingers
round his throat I couldn't let go.”

  “But that was only the first.”

  “Yes, that was only the first. I was

warned, . and psychoed, and dis-
charged as fit for duty. And so I was
until a barroom brawl in Port La-
salle. You know how I always used to
boast about my skill with side-arms,
about being quick on the draw. There
was this fellow in the bar, town mar-
shal, I think he was. I don't know
what he was like sober, but he was
most unpleasant drunk. Perhaps I
was, too. Anyhow, he pulled a gun on
me. And before it cleared his holster
I'd drilled him between the eyes.

  “And that was the finish for me.”

LAURANNE said nothing. Lati-
mer did not look at her face, but
he felt the warm waves of sympathy
that radiated from her. Only one
who, like himself, had come to this
sink-hole of the Solar System, could
possibly sympathize.

  They came to the grass verge. Au-
tomatically they stooped, put on the
sandals that they had been carrying.
They walked on over the smooth-
surfaced floor of the tunnel. It did
not matter to them that the artificial
sunlight of the park had been re-
placed by lamps that made no pre-
tense of being other than utilitarian
lighting fixtures. There was a warmth
between them, and a dim but steady
radiance that needed no assistance
frqm outside power supplies.

  Yet, as he walked, Latimer took
almost unconscious note of his sur-
roundings. He was in a part of Ceres
strange to him. The tunnel walls
were devoid of the usual doorways
and windows of residential apart-
ments. The floor was coated with a
fine dust. There were the tracks of
one of the little scooters to show that
somebody had come this way, and
recently, but that was the only sign
of traffic there was.

  Still they walked on, half in a
dream, welded to each other by the
seal of confession. The voice of the
sentry, harsh, commanding, came as
a sudden shock.
14

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

  “Halt! Who goes there?”

  “Friend,” replied Latimer auto-
matically.

  He looked up to see one of Kim-
ball’s police, smart in his uniform of
blue and silver. The metal-shod stave
was held threateningly, at the ready.

  “Advance, friend,” began the con-
stable, “and , . .”

  His eyes dropped to the little sil-
ver badge on the left breast of Lati-
mer’s civilian shirt, lifted to study
his face. And there was a light of
recognition, of the memory of past
intimacies, in his eyes as he shifted
his regard to the girl.

  “All right,” he said. “You’re the
new man, aren't you ? Latham or Lati-
mer or something. I suppose that
Lauranne is showing you the sights.”
The cold, hard flame leapt into
vicious life behind Latimer’s pale
eyes. He was often to wonder later
what he would have done, what would
have been the consequences of his ac-
tions, had not his wife taken charge.
He felt her grip on his arm, pain-
fully tight, and he heard her say:
“Alan, this is Philip Lane, an old
friend of mine. Philip, this is Alan
Latimer, my husband.”

  His hand went out, but only to grip
that of the other. Lane was talking
quickly, nervously, fully conscious
that the air was charged with hos-
tility.

  “Haven’t they shown you round
here yet? You’ll be getting your spell
of guard duty soon enough. . .

HE LED them down the tunnel,
around a bend. And the tunnel
was sealed with a bulkhead of gleam-
ing steel. In this was set a door, like
that of some huge safe or treasure
vault. The levers and wheels and
dials on its shining face would not
have looked out of place on the con-
trol panel of a Jovian Mail Liner.

  “And what’s behind all that?” de-
manded Latimer, his anger giving
place to curiosity.

  “That's what we'd all like to know.
But we never see behind that door.
Nobody does, not even the Boss. But
every year Charon brings a flock of
technicians from Earth, and they’re
escorted here by a regiment of armed
guards from the ship, and they pot-
ter around with the machinery and
we know that we’re all right for an-
other year.

  “There’s light in there, Latimer,
and heat, and the power that drives
the pumps. There’s Power in there,
and every Boss that we’ve ever had
in Ceres would have sold his soul to
lay his grubby paws on it. We have
men here, cracksmen, who could have
this door, and the other doors, open
in less time than it’d take you or me
to open a can of sardines. . . .”
“Then why don't {hey?”

  “Because there’s always at least
one of us here to stop ’em. Because
if they did we'd all find out if it’s
true what the technicians tell us.
Because if they did folks back on
Earth and Mars would see a first-
class nova right in their gardens.”
“You mean. . . .?”

“I mean that if anybody tries to get
through those doors, or tries to get
through to the vault in any other
way, up goes the atomic power sta-
tion that’s tucked away in there.”
“Oh," replied Latimer inadequate-
ly. “Thanks, Lane.” He looked at his
watch. “Time we were getting back
now. I have to be on duty at 2000.”
“A policeman’s lot is not a happy
one,” riposted the other. “But it
could be unhappier. Eh, Lauranne?”
“I wouldn’t know,” she replied
frigidly. “Come, Alan.”

  She felt that the muscles of his
arm, beneath the thin shirt, were
tensed. But now she felt that she was
barely able to control the monster
that had been called from the dark
abyss of her husband’s ancestry in
Pathfinder's lifeboat; that, once
called into being, had destroyed his
career.
^AIDERS OF THE SOLAR FRONTIER

“Come, Alan/* she said again.

: And when they were around the
bend of the tunnel he turned to her
and asked: “What is he to you?”
“He is nothing. And he was noth-
ing. Will you be content with that?”
“Yes,” he replied at last, slowly,
grudgingly. “I suppose so.”

CHAPTER III

The Ship from Outside

INSPECTOR Alan Latimer cursed
as the telephone, shrill, insistent,
interrupted his leisurely breakfast.

  It was Lauranne who answered it.
She was gone a long time. When she
returned Latimer looked at her with
more than a faint distaste, reflecting
that women such as she should never
slop around in dressing gowns.*

  “It's for you,” she said.

  “Oh. Who is it?”

  “The Boss.”

  “You were a long time talking to
him.”

  “Was I? Anyhow, it's important.”
Latimer gulped a mouthful of egg,
washed it down with coffee, rose
slowly to his feet.

  “In future,” he growled, “when
calls come for me—or calls that you
say are for me—don’t hang around
in the booth all morning answering
them.”

  “Aren’t you going? It was impor-
tant, I said.”

  “To you and who else?”
Nevertheless, Latimer went
through to the telephone booth, sat
down on the little seat before the in-
strument. From the screen Kimball's
flabby, pasty face glowered at him.

  “So you’re here at last, Latimer. I
thought you were never coming.”
“The message took long enough to
reach me.”

  “I don't care for your tone of voice,
Latimer, but let that pass. Come
round to my office at once.”

 “Why?”

  "J don't'have to answer questions.
Button up your jacket and wipe the
egg off your face, and hurry. That's
all.”

  The instrument went dead. Lati-
mer considered calling the Boss back,
thought better of it. But the taste of
the morning was bitter in his mouth
as he went back into the breakfast
room to finish his coffee. He drained
the cup, put it back into the saucer
with an unnecessary clatter. He went
into the little hall of the apartment.
He took his cap from its peg, clapped
it anyhow on to his head without
troubling to look into the mirror. He
did not kiss Lauranne good-bye.

  In Kimball's office he found the
Boss nervously pacing up and down.
Seated were two men, strangers.
They were in uniform. Latimer
stared. Charon was not due for two
months yet. He looked more closely.
The visitors wore the insignia of the
Jovian Mail Service: a five-pointed
star transfixed by a jagged, conven-
tional lightning bolt.

  “Latimer,” said Kimball abruptly,
pausing in his restless pacing, the in-
evitable toothpick working with a
speed that betrayed the depth of his
agitation, “these gentlemen are Cap-
tain Pemberthy and Commander
Wood of Thunder queen**

  “Thunderqueen, Boss? But. . . .”

 “Thunderqueen I said and Thun-
derqueen I mean. Captain, this is In-
spector Latimer of my police force,
Ex-Lieutenant Latimer of the regu-
lar navy. . . .”

  Latimer put out his hand. It was
ignored by Pemberthy. The inspector
flushed deeply and darkly under his
tan, and the cold light flared briefly
in his pale eyes. He looked fixedly at
the short, stout captain whose hat-
less head gleamed in the lamplight,
at the tall, angular commander. And
then anger was replaced by puzzle-
ment. Long and steadily he looked
at Commander Wood and did not find
that for which he was seeking.
16

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

  “We had to make a forced landing
on your world,” began Pemberthy
without preamble. “Our tube linings
are burnt out, and we don’t carry
spares. Our hull is strained and leak-
ing badly. We shall have to stay here
until help comes. . ,

  “So what?”

 “We’re being followed. Chased,
rather. By a big, black ship that
seemed to come from the direction
of Polaris—although that means
nothing. And she was no Earthly
ship. We approached her close when
our radar picked her up; thought at
first that she was some hitherto un-
discovered planetoid with an orbit at
right angles to the plane of the eclip-
tic. We were almost on top of her
before we saw what she was. And as
we were turning away she let fly with
some ray that burned away most of
our starboard fin and the venturis of
the starboard auxiliaries. We ran, of
course. She didn’t take any more
hostile action that we could see, al-
though, for all we know, she may
have used her ray again and missed.
One thing she did do—blanketed our
radio so that we could neither trans-
mit nor receive. . »

  “Kimball!” broke in Latimer, “I
suggest that you let these officers use
our station.”

 “A blinding glimpse of the ob-
vious!” snarled the Boss. “That was
the first thing they asked of me. Car-
ter went along with them. And this
blanketing effect of theirs obviously
covers us.”

 “So. Now, Captain, how do you
know that you’re being followed?”

  “I don’t know.” Pemberthy’s voice
was peculiarly flat, almost lifeless. “I
don’t know. But it seems reasonable
to suppose that any race sufficiently
advanced for interstellar travel will
be at least as far advanced as you in
the field of electronics. They’ll have
had their scanners on us ever since
the first contact. The mere fact that
the rajdio is dead indicates that.**

  “And I’m still to be convinced that
this marvelous big, black ship is
from Outside!” stormed the Boss. “It
could be pirates. And if it is, and if
they come here, I’m making a deal.
Ceres owes no loyalty to the Federa-
tion.

  “How did you know it was an alien
ship, anyhow?”

THE little, fat captain hesitated be-
fore making his reply. It was im-
possible to read his expression, there
was no expression to read. His face
was that of a carven Buddha. And his
tall, thin executive officer sat wood-
enly in his chair. Like a cigar store
Indian, Latimer was thinking.

  “It was her shape,” said Pemberthy
at last. “And her hull wasn’t smooth,
but covered with all kinds of projec-
tions*. jWeapons they might have been,
or part of her interstellar drive. And
she had her name in big white char-
acters on her bow. And they belonged
to no Earthly alphabet. . . .”

  “Could have been Arabic or Chi-
nese. Anyhow, a ship capable of com-
ing here from Alpha Centauri or
Sirius, or wherever she's supposed to
have come from, could have made
rings round your decrepit old
wagon.”

  “No. She would not be using her
interstellar drive in the vicinity of a
planetary system. And it is reason-
able to suppose that, even using her
reaction motors, she would approach
such a system with caution. . . .”

  “And so you brought her here. . .

  “It was the nearest port of refuge,”
replied Pemberthy simply.

  “And do I organize the defense of
Ceres?” demanded Latimer sharply.

  “Yes. Of course.” The Boss seemed
mildly surprised that the question
had been asked.

 “What with?”

  Kimball glared at him. He began
to say something, then thought bet-
ter of it. His tone, when at last he
did speak, was placatory.
KAiOERS OF THE SOLAR FRONTIER

  “You're the professional fighting
man in this outfit,” he said. “I leave
that entirely in your hands. And I
am sure that these gentlemen will do
all that they can to help you.”
“First,” stated Latimer, “I shall
want access to your engine room,
Captain Pemberthy. I think that with
your tools, your workshops, and with

  The captain was silent. But the tall
commander stirred and spoke. “Regu-
lations,” he said simply, and that was
all. But it was the cue that Pemberthy
needed.

  “Yes. Regulations. You know what
happened when your people got con-
trol of Thunderbird. That must not
happen again.”

It was a living,

held in his hand

prisoned in glass.

your converter to manufacture ex-
plosives, I shall be able to turn out
some Hamilton torpedoes. Don’t
know how much use they’ll be against
a race that plays around with death
rays, but unless they know enough
to degauss their ships they should be
fairly effective. And I shall want any
arms that you, your passengers, or
crew have in your possession.”

  “Any arms we have, we keep,” said
Pemberthy flatly. “And I regret to
have to say that you will not be
allowed to set foot aboard my ship.”
“Great Galaxy!” exploded the in-
spector. “This is no time to be petty.
Don’t you realize that the fate of this
world, of the System, of Man himself,
may depend upon your co-opera-
tion?”

 It was Kimball who found a way
out of the impasse.

  “Why,” he asked, “shouldn’t you
give these gentlemen details of what-
ever it is you want made? Then all
that will concern you will be the fin-
ished article.”

  And that was how it was finally
arranged. And the Hamilton torpe-
does were to remain aboard Thun-
derqueen until such time as the black
ship of the aliens chose to appear.
And with that Latimer had to be con-
tent.

  He found it especially humiliating
that, with their own little world well-
guarded, inviolate, the passengers
and crew of the Jovian liner were
made free of all Ceres.
18

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

  But even that had its compensa-
tions.

FOR long years, ever since the first
primitive story-teller soared on
the wings of his imagination to the
stars, the invasion from Outside had
been an ever recurrent theme of man-
kind’s fiction. At first the tide of con-
quest was to come sweeping in from
the Moon or the sister planets, but
the instruments of the astronomers
had shown the improbabilities inher-
ent in such a plot even before the
spaceship slipped, with disconcerting
ease, from the realm of fancy into
that of fact. Thereafter the invaders
were to come from the stars. From
which particular star nobody was
ever quite sure—but surely among all
the glittering hosts of heaven there
was one with planets to spawn a race
to rival or surpass the technological
progress of Man.

  But the very idea had been a pure-
ly fictional concept for so long that
the Ceresians, even if they did ac-
cept it intellectually, could never do
so with their emotions. Perhaps the
only man in the little world to whom
this raid from interstellar space was
probable, possible, was Alan Latimer.
But he had taken part in the Navy’s
war games, those fleet maneuvers in
which half Earth’s forces fought, in
theory, to the last man and the last
gun, in which the other half played
the part of Centaurians or Rigellians
or whatever the fancy of the Com-
mander-in-Chief might dictate.

  As for the rest, the Boss had said
that Thunderqueen had been attacked
by pirates of humble Terran origin.
And the Boss, as always, was right.
It was true that the captain and offi-
cers of the liner stuck to their story
of an alien ship, but it was obvious
that they were lying as a matter of
policy. As long as they could con-
vince the Ceresians that they were
about to fight a common enemy an
alliance was possible. But that enemy

had to be alien. Captain Pemberthy
knew full well that his hosts would
far prefer to throw in their lot with
the raiders, if they were human, than
with himself. It was all so obvious.

  Meanwhile, if Inspector Alan Lati-
mer chose to believe the cock-and-
bull story of his fellow spacemen,
there was more good than harm done.
The plans made for the defense of
the little world, the organizing, the
drilling, were admitted to be neces-
sary. When the pirates came in their
black ship any kind of organized re-
sistance would be a most useful bar-
gaining counter. So would the
weapons that were being made
aboard Thunderqueen to Latimer’s
specifications.

 And the strangers who roamed
without let or hindrance through the
caves and tunnels made a very wel-
come break in the monotony of life
in the prison asteroid. They were not
molested; there would be time
enough for that when the pirates
came. Besides, in spite of Pember-
thy’s refusal to surrender his arms to
Latimer, it was quite obvious that he
had enough and to spare of weapons
for his own people. They did not
wear them ostentatiously, but neither
did they go to any great pains to con-
ceal them. And one of the parks had
been set aside for their use as a shoot-
ing range. Both men and women
showed a proficiency that was an
effective deterrent to any of the In-
curables who might get ideas.

 An ex-officer himself, Latimer
could not blame the captain. If he
had been master of a passenger liner
he would not have allowed his
charges to wander unprotected about
a penal colony. But he would not
have allowed shore leave. But per-
haps the hull was leaking badly (if
so, why not make some attempt to
patch it?) and, quite probably, the
first that would be known of the ap-
proach of the alien would be the sud-
den destruction of Thunderqueen.
RAIDERS OF THE SOLAR FRONTIER

19

THE police force had all been
warned to be on the alert for the
first signs of internal trouble. But
Ceres could well have been some
fashionable pleasure resort. Well-
dressed men and women strolled the
parkways, mingled without snobbery
or embarrassment with the colonists.
The theatres played always to full
houses. Even allowing for the excel-
lence of the talent this was mildly
surprising, until one remembered
that, with the mysterious blanket still
thick over all radio transmission and
reception, no Terran entertainment
was available.

  And as the purely arbitrary days
rolled on without the merest hint of
Thunderqueen’s black ship there
were those who wished heartily that
the raiders or pirates would come or,
even better, that the Jovian liner and
all her people would go. The officers
and passengers of the big ship were
becoming altogether too ubiquitous.
There is little enough privacy, at the
best of times, in a world such as
Ceres. And the four hundred odd
people who were Thunderqueen’s
personnel seemed, to a certain grow-
ing minority, to have the nuisance
value of ten times their number.

  Alan Latimer was not of this mi-
nority. To him the days were packed
with interest, and with the sense of
urgency, of working against time.
And Lauranne saw little of him in
the brief periods he allowed himself
for relaxation. She heard stories,
stories that at first met with incre-
dulity, that at last forced a grudging
belief upon her. Always these stories
featured the name of Ailsa Rae.
Lauranne remembered having seen
the girL Slight she was, and red-
headed, with high cheekbones and
eyes that were green. And she moved
with a lithe grace that Lauranne her-
self could never hope to recapture.
And while she knew in her heart that
Alan was hers, yet she knew, with a
dreadful certainty, that the coming

battle with the aliens meant for her
husband the slim chance of pardon,
of a new life that she was not in-
tended to share.

  These thoughts had crossed Lati-
mer's mind. In his more optimistic
moments he had allowed himself to
dream dreams. And he had hated him-
self that his wife was not part of
these same dreams, but the dreams
remained unchanged. But in these
latter days the thought whose urg-
ency crowded all else from his mind
was that he was not ready. An antic
fate had made him Earth's champion
in the first battle between men and
aliens, and both armor and armament
were sadly lacking. He decided that
he would force a showdown between
himself and Pemberthy, would de-
mand to be allowed to inspect the
progress made in the manufacture of
the torpedoes, the arming of Thun-
derqueen.

  He said as much to Ailsa Rae, with
whom he was walking in one of the
parks.

  “But it is all right, Alan,” she in-
sisted. “I’ve been down to the engine-
room and the workshops. I know
nothing about these things, but I saw
row upon row of plastic cylinders,
each with its fins and jets at the tail.
And they’re setting up launching
cradles in all the airlocks. It will be
all right, I tell you."

  “Perhaps, my dear. But I want to
see for myself. And I want to have
at least one round for each of my
own projectors. If this black ship of
Pemberthy’s drops on us without
warning and blasts Thunderqueen, I
have no weapons to fight back.”

  “But. . . . Oh, I can see it’s no use
arguing with you. You’ll see the Old
Man, and you’ll have a first-class row,
same as you did before, and you’ll
get nowhere. And. . . .”

 “Shut up!” ordered Latimer. He
enforced his order by pressing his
mouth on hers. And as she went limp
in his arms he felt his resolve to
20

have it out with Captain Pemberthy
weaken. He was doing enough. He
was doing more than his share. Let
the Boss dicker with Thunderqueen’s
Master—he was the politician.

CHAPTER IV

Cold-Blooded Murder

HOW long this mood would have
lasted had it not been for the in-
tervention of chance it is impossible
to say. But it was the hard pressure
of Ailsa’s shoulder holster against
his chest that aroused resentment,
pulled him up from the pit into which
he was fast falling. This girl, this
woman that was his for the taking,
was armed and he was not. It was an
affront to his pride as a fighting man.
It was unthinkable that a foolish
merchant skipper should have the
effrontery to provide his female pas-
sengers with weapons, and deny
those same weapons to those to whom
was entrusted the defense of a world,
and more than a world.

  He let his arms fall to his sides.
The girl, taken unawares, staggered.
And in her green eyes when she
looked up at him was puzzlement and
hurt, and a strange light that was
neither.

  “Where do I find the Captain?” de-
manded Latimer harshly.

  “You should know,” she replied sul-
lenly. “He and Commander Wood are
usually with your Boss at this time.”

  “Then I’m going there now. And
Kimball had better back me up.
Or

“Or what?” The voice was mocking.

 “Never you mind,” he laughed,
matching her mood of light raillery.
He clasped her to him and kissed her
heartily. And thought that if this had
been Lauranne the little scene would
have been followed by an atmosphere
of dull resentment that would have
lasted for hours.

Somehow, as he strode across the

velvety grass, his spirits were light.
He looked with appreciation at a tall,
blonde girl, one of the liner's pas-
sengers. And he was not too sur-
prised when he saw, a few minutes
later, the same girl again. It couldn’t
possibly be the same girl, he told him-
self. She must be twins . . . And
thought nothing more of it.

  He returned the salute of the sentry
at the entrance to Kimball’s apart-
ments with a snap that surprised even
himself. As he strode along the cor-
ridor he found that he was rehears-
ing what he would say to Pemberthy.
He repeated the most telling phrases,
turning them over and over in his
mind with relish.

  It was not until he had almost
reached the office that the sound of
angry voices aroused him from his
pleasant daydream. Angry voices? He
listened intently. There was only one
angry voice, and that was Kimball’s.
Pemberthy was speaking in his usual
expressionless tones. And Wood ap-
peared not to be speaking at all.

  Latimer started to hurry. As he
reached the door he heard Kimball
shout: “I know! I know what . . .”
And there was a peculiarly soft ex-
plosion, and a scream, and, when
Latimer flung open the door, the sick-
ening stench of burned flesh.

  On the floor, in front of his desk,
lay Kimball. Where his protuberant
belly had been was a charred, gaping
hole. The coils of the intestines, laid
bare, seemed to have a life of their
own, seemed to be writhing slowly
andslimily. Latimer gulped. He turned
away quickly. But not before he had
seen the smoking gun in Wood’s hand,
the ugly weapon that Pemberthy was
pointing straight at him.

 When he looked back both Wood
and Pemberthy were covering him
with their weapons. They were, he
saw, standard .5 service automatics,
fitted with silencers, firing an explo-
sive slug. And the hands that held
them wavered not one fraction.
RAIDERS OF THE SOLAR FRONTIER

  Latimer was not unarmed. He had
his stout, metal-tipped stave, and the
short dirk at his belt. Against two
nervous inexperienced gunmen he
would have stood a fighting chance.
But these gunmen were not nervous.
Such sangfroid might have been ex-
pected from two officers of his own
late service, but hardly from those
whose whole training emphasized the
safe delivery of passengers and cargo,
the safety of their ships. He, Latimer,
had killed his men in hot blood. The
only hot blood in evidence in this
killing had been Kimball’s. The two
merchant officers were no more than
cold-blooded murderers.

PEMBERTHY was speaking. “I am
sorry that this had to happen,** he
said.

  “You will be when you’re sent out
here to become a permanent guest,**
cracked Latimer.

  “Let me finish. Your Boss, Kimball,
was planning to seize our ship, to hand
her over to the invaders that he will
—would—insist on regarding as Ter-
ran pirates. We quarreled. He drew a
knife. Commander Wood was obliged
to fire in self-defense.”

  “What did Kimball know?" de-
manded the Inspector.

  There was a little silence. Then
Wood permitted himself the luxury
of a mirthless smile.

  “He thought that he knew that the
ship that attacked us was manned by
Terran pirates . . .’*

  “Another thing, you’ve said that
you could not spare us arms. But
even your women are packing guns.”
“We should, perhaps, have been
more frank. Put yourself in our place,
Latimer. As far as we are concerned
this place may be more dangerous than
the jungles of Venus. Are we to de-
prive ourselves and our charges of all
protection?”

  “No,” admitted Latimer slowly.
“But the alliance between us—if you
can call it such—has been far too one-

sided. You and your people have been
given the freedom of our world. And
what have we got in return? Nothing
but vague promises.

  “Worse, you are supposed to be the
law abiding citizens, we the criminals.
Yet . . .” He pointed mutely to Kim-
ball’s body.

  Pemberthy was silent. It was not,
strangely enough, an embarrassed or a
guilty silence. This the Inspector
fou id strange indeed. He was willing
to believe that the master of a pas-
senger liner might well find a lack
of frankness, a certain disingenuous-
ness, very essential in the execution
of his professional duties, might even,
in time, become an accomplished pre-
varicator. But it is not so much the
act of lying, of equivocation, that
brings moral discomfort in its wake.
It is being found out. But this was as
nothing to the fact that Kimball’s
killers, men of peace, could view the
body of the man they had butchered
without the slightest trace of emo-
tion.

  “Let him see the ship,” suggested
Wood, his voice expressionless as al-
ways. “Let him see the ship, and con-
vince himself that we are making his
weapons. But first, sir, it will be as
well to dispose of the body.”

  “Commander Wood is right,” agreed
the Captain. “Nobody need know that
Kimball is dead. At a time of crisis
such as this it will be as well if no-
body ever does know that Kimball is
dead. You, of course, will carry on
as you have been doing; ever since
our arrival you have been the real
Boss. Kimball has been only a figure-
head.”

 Latimer wanted to argue. He
wanted to press the stud under the
desk that would bring the guards
pouring into the room. And, above all,
he wanted to do violence to the two
who stood there and to whom the body
on the floor was just so much refuse
to be unceremoniously dumped.

  But . . . They held the guns.
22

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

  Had it not been for the fact that
there was nobody else on Ceres to
whom the military command could be
entrusted, that he, Alan Latimer, was,
even though Earth did not know,
might never know entrusted with the
defense of the Solar System, he would
never have let himself be overawed by
the threat of the heavy pistols, would
have allowed the tides of fury to
sweep aside all prudence, all con-
sidered action.

  But Ceres had wrought its changes.
So, too, had the heavy responsibility
with which he had been saddled. And
he held himself on a tight rein, and
the red haze never quite obscured his
vision, and the drumming of the blood
in his ears was never loud enough to
drown what the others were saying.

  “Well?” demanded Pemberthy.

  “I still think that you’re murderers.
I still have to be convinced of the
truth of your story. But . .

  “Yes?”

  “You give me no choice.”

WOOD had found the cunningly
concealed button in the paneling.
He pressed it, and a circular section
of the floor slid to one side. Latimer
wondered how the strangers knew of
the existence of the chute that ran
down to the big fertilizer tanks.
Probably Kimball had told them in a
moment of drunken confidence. He
had always been proud of this uncon-
ventional office fitting. But during his
*eign it had never, until now, been
used for bodies. Bitterly Latimer re-
flected on hpw much better the Boss
had been than his bad and mad
predecessors, experienced a sense of
very real loss; of hatred for his
murderers.

 Wood dragged the gross body to
the edge of the round hole, gave it a
last shove with his foot. It teetered
for a second or so, then vanished.
From very far away came the sound
of a splash. Kimball had always been
proud of Ceres’ parks and gardens.

And in death he would serve them
no less faithfully than he had done
during his life.

  Pemberthy waited until his execu-
tive officer had removed, with a piece
of rag, all traces of blood from the
polished floor, sent the hideously
stained cloth to follow the body.
Then, with his gun, he gestured to-
wards the door.

  “And tell the guards,” he said,
“that the Boss is working hard, must
not be disturbed. You can arrange to
have food sent in at intervals.”

  You fools, thought Latimer. Who-
ever brings the food will see st once
that there is something amiss . . . But
wefre playing the game your way. All
I have to do is to keep my jets clear.

  The two officers returned their
guns to their side pockets. The In-
spector could sense rather than see
that he was still covered, that the
slightest hostile move on his part
would be the last move that he would
make. They closed in on either side
of him as they walked along the cor-
ridor to the outside passages. So close
were they that he found it difficult to
return the salutes of the guards.

  At the last door there was another
constable talking to the one on duty.
When he saw Latimer he stiffened to
attention, brought his hand to the
brim of his helmet. The most meticu-
lously Prussian military officer would
have found it hard to lay his finger on
anything wrong with the salute, but
in it there was something of what, in
all services and all ages, has been
called “dumb insolence.”

  The man was Lane.

  “Mrs. Latimer’s compliments, sir/*
he said stiffly, “and will you come
round to your apartment at once?”
Alan Latimer did not want to go.
The memory of the girl Ailsa was too
fresh in his mind, dreams of a future
in which she played a prominent part
were not lacking.

  “That can wait,* said Pemberthy*
  “Oh, I don’t know . . ,H
RAIDERS OF THE SOLAR FRONTIER

23

  “Of course it can wait/'

  And who the hell are you to give
me orders affecting my private life?
Come to think of it—you and your
long, lanky sidekick are ruddy anx-
ious to get me aboard your damned
ship. There's a catch in it somewhere.
But I don't want to be bumped off the
same as Kimball. All the same, I'd
better play ball, my way. Up to a
point. Can’t afford to split brass-rags
when the alien ship may be on top of
us at any moment . . .

  But he said: “I think I’d better go,
Captain.” He n_anaged a mirthless
grin. “You know what women are.”
“I think you’d better come with
us,” Wood stated flatly. No trace of
emotion was evident in his voice, in
his eyes, but Latimer knew that the
index finger of the Commander’s right
hand had tightened about the trigger
of his gun.

  Latimer glanced about him. There
were too many witnesses for a mur-
der. In addition to Lane and the con-
stable on duty there were three more
policemen just coming out of the
administration offices. And there were
a half dozen of Thunderqueen's pas-
sengers, men and women, coming
along the wide corridor.

  It should have been reassuring, yet
he had the feeling that Wood would
as soon shoot him down in front of
all Ceres as in private.

  “No,” he said. “My wife wants me,
and I’d better go. But that matter we
talked over in Kimball’s office, you
have my word that I’m in favor . .

  The dull, expressionless eyes stared
into his. Then, “We have your
word?”

  “Haven’t I just told you?”

  “Good. And as for your visit to the
ship, some other time, perhaps.”
That's what you think, thought
Latimer. He gave the two merchant
officers a perfunctory salute, strode
down the corridor with steps that he
tried to make not too hurried. And the
uneasy feeling in the small of his

back persisted until he had put a
bend of the passage between himself
and Pemberthy and Wood.

HE HAD every intention of going
straight to his apartment. He
was curious as to the reason for Laur-
anne’s summons, and he was grate-
ful to her for having extricated him
from what he felt to have been an
awkward situation. Awkward? It was
more than that. He became aware that
his underclothing was clammy with
perspiration, knew that he had ex-
perienced a fear altogether beyond
even the most unpleasant and terrify-
ing events of his past life. He told
himself that this was because this
was the first time that he had forced
himself to stand up to a real emer-
gency in cold blood. During his serv-
ice career a recklessness, an unthink-
ing bravery, had stood him in good
stead—until the black day that this
same recklessness spelled the ruin
of his career and all his hopes. That’s
what it was, he told himself. But the
explanation wasn’t convincing.

 He was deep in thought as he
turned the corner into the corridor
on which his apartment was situated.
Unseeing, blind and deaf to all else
but the problem in his brain, he let
his feet carry him around the fa-
miliar curve. And when he cannoned
into something firm, yet soft, some-
thing that said: “Well! Really!” he
was taken by surprise and off bal-
ance, staggered and almost fell. If
Ailsa Rae had not caught his arm he
would have fallen.

 “Wrapped in thought and clothed
in haste,” she said mockingly. “And
hurrying home like a good hus-
band ...”

 “Why, yes. But not too good, I’m
afraid . .

The girl fell in step beside him.
Latimer was walking more slowly
now, matching his pace to hers. He
was telling her his troubles, his wor-

'Jud, behind you' ' the girl screamed.

           When Jud Lee carried that helpless heiress into a
           Martian ruin, he thought he was saving her life
           from the Red Planet’s vengeance. He never suspected
           that he was only carrying her across the thresh-
           hold to a lost world a hundred times more deadly!

  The last great empire of Mars, a series
■of fertile islands in the heart cf a shallow
toarshlike sea near the equator, came
abruptly to an end sometime in the Darb
Ages of Earth. Less than a thousand Mar-
tian years have passed since the Med sands
swallowed the Sea of Raba and its several
score doomed cities and towns. . . .

  It was in the last years of the empire
that science reached its peak. During the
reign of Raba Dagan, the Wise, scientists
shook off the shackles of gravitation and
voyaged in huge metal ships to the moons,
and to Venus and Earth. The trading ships
of Raba exploited the savage tribes exist-
ing at either pole, and her miners reopened
long-abandoned mines rimming the dead
tea bottoms.

  Then, with the death of Raba Dagan,
came the 6rst of a series of plundering

24

Voldurians, better known as Toads, gray-
fleshed, lumpy, four-foot entities from
outer space. And almost overnight the Sea
of Raba vanished. The hungry red sands,
unchecked now, swallowed the ravaged
islands and buried the domes.

  To the north and to the south fled the
survivors, there to battle and mingle their
blood with the dwindling savage descend-
ants of earlier civilizations. Yet the memory
of their vanished fertile homeland persisted
in their legends and was woven into the
intricate structure of their theism.

  The dune-buried islands and dead cities
became a lost paradise that was to be
eventually restored to its pristine culture
and fertility. . . .

‘UD LEE ran stubby
brown fingers through
ihis snowy hair before
he let the pressure
helmet drop back in
place. Despite the
laboring pressure
pumps the air in the leaky cabin of
the prospecting helicopter was un-
comfortably thin. For the last three
days he had lived, eaten, and slept al-
most exclusively in his pressure suit.

  “Lopez!” he called as he snapped
on the ship-to-ship audiophone.

  The receivers in his helmet rattled
in response. Have to check for loose
connections or use the spare helmet,
he decided. He bumped the trans-
parent face-plate with a hooded wrist
and the voice cleared.

   **. . . speaking.”

  “Almost in the heart of Raba De-

pression,” he said, his eyes continu-
ing their endless sweep of the deso-
late dunes and ridged hollows. “No
sign of water or desert growth. Two
ruined cities off to the north. One
just ahead.”

  “No luck here either.” Vincent
Lopez’s voice was unsteady. “We
have but a week remaining, my
friend.”

  “If we could only blast the Toads
out of the northern canals, we'd have
water in plenty. Ten cruisers from
Earth would do the trick. But we do
nothing. Let them force us off Mars
or use all our profits buying water!”
“Si” agreed Lopez bitterly, “but
the Rhett Peace Pact says no. For
no longer raiding Venus and Earth,
we give the northland of Mars to the
invaders.”

  “South Mars Limited maybe had a

25
26

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

finger in the pie. Their polar water-
ways are free of grafting Voldurians.”
Lopez grunted assent. “Reminds
me—seen anything of that SML pas-
senger liner reported missing yes-
terday ?”

  “Nope. Uh, wait a minute. Some-
thing down here. Outcrop of rock
maybe, or a building. . . .

  “Dropping down to a hundred feet.
. . . Uh, oh! It’s the ship all right.
Half buried in a dune and shattered.
Must have exploded.”

  “What’s your position, Jud?” Lee
snapped back the readings, easing the
heli down toward the base of the
marching dune.

  “Stepping out to look her over,
Lopez. Stand by.”

  “Heading for you. Visibility almost
zero. Sandstorm kicking up.” Lopez
snapped out something in disgusted
Spanish.

  “Not bad. here. Better climb above
it. So long.”

  Lee took his featherweight sand
spade and left the heli’s cabin on the
side opposite the stiff southern
breeze. He swung to the left, around
the swirling turtle-paced toe of the
marching hillock of ruddy sand. Here
it was more sheltered and in a dozen
paces he had reached the twisted
debris of the half-covered wreck.

  He cleared away the sand swiftly.
In two minutes he had wriggled
through the burst-open cabin’s wall.
He gulped at what he saw.

 A minute later he was calling
Lopez. “Five passengers and three
crew members. All dead.”
“Emergency call made it six pas-
sengers, one female.”

  “All men.” Lee frowned at the slow-
ly advancing wall of sand particles.
The breeze was growing in power.
“She may have been thrown free.
Cabin split open like a nut.”

 “We’ll radio from the base.”
Lopez’s voice was strained. “Getting
really knotty here, Jud. Better take
off before it gets you.”

  The transmitter of the little Mexi-
can partner of Jud Lee clicked off.
The water prospectors and mineralo-
gists of Northern Mars Incorporated
always worked in pairs. And Jtiever at
greater distances than forty miles
from one another. So the desert storm
would soon be upon Lee.

  He took off, the sudden blast of thin
air as he topped the dunes almost
smashing him downward again. He
climbed as fast as the sky prop’s
blades permitted. And his hands froze
on the controls.

  A pinpoint of light blossomed in
the growing dusk of swirling dust
clouds and endured for brief seconds
—an emergency flare. Less than a
quarter mile to the north it was. He
headed toward it and finally spotted
a pressure-suited shape kneeling in
the shelter of a minor dune.

 Somehow he landed less than a
dozen feet beyond the woman. She
came crawling through the blast of
the sky prop and he yanked her into
the cabin. He sent the ship lurching
skyward, and, once clear of the sand,
locked its controls for 500 feet.

  The helmet slid from the woman’s
dusty head. He saw a tear-stained face
and long reddish-brown hair. Her
eyes were, big, blue and staring with
the terror she had known. Lee took
in the flabby cheeks and the pouting
lips and did not like what he saw.

  “I’m thirsty,” she said. “Give me
some water.”

  Lee held a water flask for her and
pushed her hands away after the first
swallows. “Uh, uh,” he said.

“Give me that water, Grandpa,” she
snarled weakly at him. “My father’ll
put you back at mining if you don’t.”
“Your father will?” Lee laughed.
“And who’s he?”

 “Commander Banton, you fool!
Now give me that drink.”

  Lee stuffed the flask into his pres-
sure suit’s zippered belly pouch. He
snapped on the transmitter, calling
Lopez again. Between call* for his
UNDER MARTIAN SANDS

27

comrade he studied his unwelcome
passenger.

 “So you’re ‘Louse’ Banton,” he
mused. “Worst spoiled brat on Mars.
And from South Mars, tool”

  “My name is Lois!” the girl fairly
screamed, “and I am not a brat!”

  “Shut up,” ordered Lee abruptly.
“Yeah, this’s Lee. You okay, Lopez?
Great. . . .

  “Got the girl. Jet-happy little dame
left the wreck and started off on foot!
Honest. . . . Banton’s daughter. . .

  Lois slapped at Lee’s tough pres-
sure mask and he held her off with
one hand, grinning sourly at her
gasping rage.

  “Meet you at base,” he concluded,
“in an hour or so.”

HALF AN HOUR later he was not
so sure he’d make the base. He
was making no headway against the
raging torrent of sand-laden atmos-
phere ; in fact he guessed he was los-
ing the battle, and the battered heli's
cabin was slowly wrenching apart at
its welded seams.

  Once he’d climbed to four thou-
sand feet, to find the wind yet more
turbulent there. Cross currents of air
had tossed the little mapping ship
about and forced him groundward.
And the power of the hurricane had
kept growing.

  Both he and the Banton girl were
strapped into their seats as the heli
slammed about crazily. Abruptly the
controls went lifeless in his hands.
Something had given way. Helpless-
ly, they were carried before the storm.
The instruments were crazy, here in
the Raba Depression they were far
below the arbitrary sea level as it was,
and now they could not be read cor-
rectly.

 “May crash any minute, Lopez!”
Lee shouted through his throat mike.

  Uselessly, Lopez’s faint voice was
requesting his position, but before
Lee could answer, the crash came. A
freakish swirl of the sand-laden air

slowed the ship momentarily, and it
dropped like a rock. There was a
brutal snapping impact, and then a
blackness the storm could not equal.

 After a time Lee was conscious
of the cutting blast of air that probed
through a great split in the top of
the cabin. Only now the roof was in
front of him. There was the taste of
salty blood in his mouth. And he was
no longer strapped in the control
chair.

  Clumsily he groped to the locker
where the protective sand masks were
stored and took out two of them. One
he slipped over his pressure helmet
and the other he took to the girl’s
sprawled body.

. “Keep your filthy paws off me,” she
snarled savagely. His audiophones rat-
tled. Her breath gurgled unevenly.

  She clawed at his hands, but he
persisted in his task of strapping on
the mask, and an extra belt of water
flasks and oxygen cylinders. She was
only semi-conscious, and he was
forced to carry her toward the gap-
ing rent. Only then did complete
understanding return to her.

 “What—where are we going?” she
demanded pettishly.

  “Have to start off on foot, look for
a deserted city or other shelter.”

  Lois Banton laughed nastily. “Hah!
You laughed at my ignorance in leav-
ing the wrecked flyer. And now you
do the same.”

  Lee shrugged. “Sure. You crashed
in comparatively decent weather. The
wreckage remained exposed. But in
five minutes, ten feet of sand may
bury the heli. The dunes build swiftly
in such a hurricane.”

  The girl gazed fearfully at the ris-
ing level of sifting sand over what
had been the control panels. She fairly
flung herself at the opening. Lee
caught her sand boots just in time
and pulled her back. Calmly he
snapped a ringed ten-foot line of
tough nylon into her belt and into his
own. Then he checked his sand spade,
28

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

pouched solar torch, and pressure-
proof zippered holster where his com-
pact machine-gun lay.

  “We could anchor ourselves to the
ship by a hundred-foot line,” he told
her calmly as he set the transmitter
for thirty-second intervals of auto-
matic signals, “but we’d soon be
buried too. Only chance is drifting
before the wind.”

  Lois’s eyes were streaming tears.
“But there's no water out there/’
she quavered, “and our oxygen will
run out.”

  “Then we'll use the hand pumps on
our suits.” Lee was angry, suddenly.
“As for water there is little loss, per-
haps a pint escapes in a day from
these suits.”

  He pushed her out the opening and
followed swiftly, the blast of the
storm hurrying them along. He caught
a glimpse of the heli and a building
ridge of red dust behind it.

THEY stumbled through a ruddy
darkness that rustled and chewed
at their tough pressure envelopes.
They leaned back against the wind,
their sand boots slogging mechani-
cally along. The surge of the storm
currents threatened to send them
hurtling skyward, chiplike. Even the
shifting ridges of the dunes offered
little protection, and a moment's halt
buried them to the knees.

  The curved solidity of a wall jarred
Lee back into realization of his sur-
roundings. Time had lost all mean-
ing and weariness had dulled his
senses. He was astonished to discover
Lois yet on her feet, her body flat-
tened against the obstruction.

 “Domed city!” he croaked, his
throat thick.

 The girl's teeth showed whitely
through the begrimed faceplates of
her sand mask and helmet. She was
trying to speak but he heard nothing,
the communication cables linking
them had broken or his audiophone
receiver had finally quit.

  He inched along the slow curve
of the vast dome toward the left, and
perhaps a hundred feet further along
found a ragged crevice in the semi-
opaque shell roofing the dead city’s
dust-choked ruins. He squeezed
through to a catwalk of spidery look-
ing, but enduring, metal, and drew
Lois in beside him.

  Only five feet below them, the high-
est of the ancient towers and flat-
roofed dwellings sprouted from the
sand. Lee knew that their bases might
be a hundred feet further down, per-
haps more. Eventually the outer level
cf sand and the inner level would co-
incide. That this dome must have been
less badly shattered by the raiding in-
vaders of a thousand years before,
he could well believe. Most of the
dead towns were completely buried.

  They moved to the right until the
spurting spray of sand through the
wide slit in the dome could no longer
reach them. Lee discovered the phone
cable was unlinked and reclipped the
contacts.

  “I’m going outside again,” he told
the girl, taking out his solar torch,
“to mark our entrance. Then we’ll
hunt for shelter in the ruins.”

  He lengthened the nylon cord with
another ten foot length, before bat-
tling outward again, and then, above
his head, he burned a sooty broad
arrow into the dome’s crystalline
surface. To the left of this he burned:
LEE, in two-foot letters. And on the
opposite side of the crevice he put
another, longer, arrow.

  This done he re-entered the huge
dome and lay, exhausted, upon the
hard metallic ribs of the catwalk. Lois
was sprawled there too, mouth slack,
sleeping. The effort to stand again
was too great. He closed his eyes.

T EE WAS smothering, his lungs
gasping for air. He struggled to
an elbow and opened his eyes to a
dust-swirling twilight. The storm had
not eased while he slept.

  The oxygen cylinder was exhaust-
ed. Stale air sickened him, and his
temples were throbbing as he
switched over to the spare tank. When
that was gone they'd have to rely on
the emergency hand pumps to fill
them again with compressed air.

  He breathed deeply and switched
on the girl’s extra tank. She stirred
and sat up too. He grinned wryly at
her, contorted features.

  “Hard bed," he said. “Even sand is
better/’

  Lois squirmed uncomfortably,
stretching her cramped legs and arms.
She stood up, looking out over the
mile-wide extent of the dome’s foggy
disc. “Now what?” She yawned. “Any
chance of rescue soon?”

  Lee shook his head. “Not until the
storm’s over. May be a day, may be a
week. Our exit’s blown shut too, I see.”
The crevice by which they had en-
tered was sealed again, and a rounded
ramp of sand led down to the dome’s
uneven floor. Lee led the way to this
and slid and stumbled down it, the
girl trailing.

  “Might as well hole up in the
ruins,” he advised. “Maybe we can
seal out some of the dust so our hand
pumps will not clog so fast.”

  Lois did not reply. She had with-
drawn an arm from her suit’s inflated
right sleeve and was munching at an
oval bar that looked like candy. Lee
jerked at her other arm, making her
drop the remaining fragment.

  “That’s emergency ration,” he said
sternly, “food for a week. You’re
going to be sorry.”

  "Yah!” spat out the girl, grimacing
angrily at him.

  Suddenly she doubled over, her face
paling and yellowing to a hideous
green hue. For several minutes she
was violently sick, the cramped con-
fines of her helmet and pressure suit
but multiplying the discomforts of a
cramping disgorging stomach.

  After a time she was better, and Le*
smothered a smile as she glared at

him. He headed again toward the oval
doorway of a rounded tower of seam-
less yellowed plastic, the same mate-
rial of which the enormously thick
skin of the dome was constructed.

  Inside, a vast, high-ceilinged cham-
ber opened. And here the light seemed
to have brightened, perhaps because
the dust cloud was thinned. Lee un-
capped his solar torch, cutting its
radiance to less than normal noontime
illumination.

  Vast murals, their colors bright and
fresh and the glistening protective
coating of diamond-hard transparency
unmarred by the centuries, covered
the inner walls. Lee blinked his eyes,
startled, as he saw familiar animals
and vegetation, not of Mars, but of
Earth! And then he recalled the leg-
ends of the savage natives of the
polar waterways, stories of great ships
crossing to Earth and Venus.

  One wall depicted scenes of Earth;
jungles, seas, and cultivated country-
sides with hilltop castles and thatched
huts of stone. One figure was that
of a mailclad warrior astride a masked
and hooded horse. Here was that
proof that Martians had visited Earth
during the Middle Ages, this and the
relief maps just below the murals.

  The other wall represented scenes
on Venus, recognizable to Lee, al-
though he had never been there. Frog-
like natives, Butrads, he saw, and the
ever-present aquatic growth of thidin
vines. The paintings were as lifelike
and colorful as three-dimensional
photographs.

 “This must have been old Raba
Dagan’s headquarters, Lois,” he said,
turning to the pale-faced girl.

  They were now near the further end
of the lofty hall, where twin oval
ports stood invitingly open. The right
hand door opened into a smaller room,
its walls also decorated with pictures.
Lois stepped inside and Lee followed.

  Sudden emptiness opened in the pit
of Lee’s stomach; it was like a long-
continued drop into a mine-shaft. The
30

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

oyal opening into the outer chamber
gave way to a blurring succession of
rock strata and black galleries.

  Lois so far forgot her dislike for
Lee that she clung to his arm in ter-
ror. “We’re falling!” she screamed.
“Stop us! Stop us!”

  “Don’t worry/’ he told her, “this
is probably an automatic elevator of
some sort.”

  As though to confirm his words the
“room” slowed and stopped opposite
another oval doorway. They stepped
out into a dreary cavern of a room
that was lightless save for Lee's solar
torch. For another ten seconds or so
the platform remained opposite and
then it sank away smoothly into the
depths.

  Only a faintly luminous mistiness,
smokily brown and falling steadily,
was to be seen in the square shaft.

  “Now what, vac brain?” demanded
the girl. “We’re stuck here maybe a
mile below the surface.”

  “The other shaft should have a cur-
rent of this same inert gas rising up-
ward/’ Lee suggested. “Let’s see.”

  They took the four steps neces-
sary to reach the other opening, look-
ing down into a vacancy like that they
had just quitted. Lois laughed jeer-
ingly. Apparently her stomach was
returning to normal, and she was
again her usual disagreeable sel£.

 “Disappointed, Grandpa?” she
asked.

 Lois was possibly nineteen or
twenty and Lee was twenty-five. It
was his prematurely snow-white hair
that earned this nickname, a freakish
result of a glancing bullet in one of
the unending affrays between miners
of SML and his own company. He
grinned. After all he’d called her
Louse, first.

  “Nup. Be another platform along
soon.”

  A minute passed. Lois sniffed tri-
umphantly. And then a bulky some-
thing came sliding softly up from be-
low and came to rest in the shaft. Its

oblong entrance almost exactly
matched that of the mysterious bar-
ren chamber.

  “Going up, Miss Banton?” asked
Lee. “No charge.”

  Lois shook her head violently. “No!
Let’s keep going down and see what’s
there. We might find a treasure or
mines.”

  There was new respect in Lee’s
voice as he agreed. It took a certain
amount of courage, or bravado, to
go downward into the unknown when
a way to the surface was waiting.
Despite her words her voice had qua-
vered a trifle at the end.

  A moment later they were aboard
a platform in the other shaft and
dropping steadily downward.

THE PLATFORM cage glided to a
stop again, its seventh, and a
well-lighted corridor lay beyoi\d the
oval port. Lois wept swiftly out of
the unmoving compartment with Lee
at her side. And for the first time he
noticed how their pressure suits
wrinkled and flapped about their
bodies.

  He tested tho outer pressure by
cracking the helmet valve. There was
no escape of oxygen. Gingerly he
sniffed, sniffed again more deeply—
and tugged at his helmet until it
loosened and hung back on his shoul-
der hinges.

  “Clean air,” he cried. “Air with the
smell of flowers and green growing
things in it! Moist air!”

  Lois followed suit. For several long
sobbing breaths they were content to
stand there and suck in the heady
fragrance of the thick air. It made
them dizzy after a time, forced them
to breathe more shallowly as they
peeled off their cumbersome pressure
gear.

  “How deep would we be,” demand-
ed Lois, “before air pressure equaled
Earth Normal?”

  “Plenty deep, Lois. And the air is
moist!”
UNDER MARTIAN SANDS

31

 "So what? Our domes in South
Mars are the same.”

 Lee muttered something uncom-
plimentary about “Toad Lovers" and
started down the corridor. For sev-
eral hundred feet it extended straight
as an arrow, a softly glowing tube
of perhaps twenty feet in diameter.
The girl hurried after Lee.

 Their now useless pressure suits
and helmets, as well as the useless
sand gear, they left behind. Finally
Lee spoke:

  “Moisture means water, possibly an
underground lake or sea. North Mars
Incorporated wouldn’t have to close
its mines. We’ve been in the red for
the past two years buying all our
water from the Toads!’’

  “I’m glad they’re not in our hemi-
sphere,” agreed Lois.

 “Yeah.” Cynicism dripped from
the word. His lips uncurled. “Sorry.
Forget you’re just a brat. Shouldn’t
be taking out my dislike for SML
on you.”

  “I’m nineteen,” the girl cried, “and
no brat! But most of us do feel sorry
for your people in the north—the
women and children, that is.”
“Thought you’d qualify it.”
Suddenly Lee halted and his right
hand went down to the gas-powered
pocket gun holstered at his hip. It
contained a clip of a thousand biaton-
tipped needles—each needle an ex-
plosive miniature grenade. Because
the needles were expelled, rather than
fired, the common term of expoder
was ■given them.

 A forty-foot section of corridor
had lost its glowing coating, it lay
jumbled and dull on the floor, and
the slimy darkness of water puddled
there as well. On the left a branch-
ing corridor, also in darkness, opened.
And there Lee thought he had de-
tected movement.

 His hand fell away. He laughed
at himself. How could there be life
here in this long-deserted necropolis?
Of course the weird elevator shafts

yet functioned and there was the mys-
terious light, but in other abandoned
cities Earthmen had discovered vast
atom-powered machines purring un-
tended after thousands of years. At
Port Bemis, his homedome, all the
power they needed for lights and
heat came from a single Martian.
power plant.

  Carefully he picked his way over
the debris by the dim light from be-
yond. He passed the intersecting
emptiness, a smaller unlighted way,
and then a scrabbling sound came to
him. Probably Lois. He started to
turn.

  “Jud, behind you!” the girl’s voice
screamed.

  His leisurely movements changed.
He flung himself forward and spun
about, dropping to his knees with the
expoder jutting from his fist. He saw
three dwarfish squatty shapes, heavy
clubs upraised, almost upon him.
They must have come from the un-
lighted passage.

  And then the hand gun sewed its
needles across their torsos, those
missing the targets exploding against
the corridor’s wall. A miniature series
of thunderclaps boomed along the
way. But even as the echoes died away
the last of his attackers fell.

  Lee came forward warily, his solar
torch at plus sunlight searching into
the other tunnel for other foes. It
was empty to a depth of perhaps a
hundred feet, but it curved to the
right and therefore he could see no
further.

  He turned again to the fallen men,
discovering them to be dwarfed hu-
manoid creatures, thick-shouldered
and hairy, their teeth yellowed fangs,
and with foreheads little higher than
their bulging frontal sinuses. Two of
the naked beast-men were dark-
haired, and the other covered with
matted, straw-colored hair. Yet among
the native Martians of the polar
regions, black hair was almost un-
known ; reddish-blond hair, coarse
32

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

and thick as fur, being their natural
covering.

  And the size of their chests, when
compared with the vast lung cavities
of the polar natives, was pitifully in-
adequate. They were warped, bow-
legged, and gnarled, with the filthy
skin under their coarse-haired cover-
ing whiter than that of Lois.

  He returned to the girl.

  “Better go back, hadn’t we?” he
asked.

  She bit her sagging lip and her
damp eyes grew hot. Her body
straightened defiantly. Stooping over
a dead savage she found his club, a
knotted cudgel longer than a man’s
forearm, and lifted it. She moved past
Lee. “Come on, Grandpa,” she chal-
lenged, leading the way.

  Lee moved up beside her, his hand
gun in his fingers, and his eyes alert.
Together they strode down the seem-
ingly unending length of the huge
tube. Foolhardy it was, perhaps, but
the water-hunger that only a native-
born Martian knows, burned hot in
both their hearts.

  Something of the man’s excitement
and flaming hope had touched the
girl. In her eyes was the same over-
powering lust for water, and more
water, that rivaled mankind’s earlier
madness for gold.

LESS THAN HALF a mile the gal-
lery extended into the misty
glow of its inner walls. Then they
came out on a wide ledge of stone,
its outer wall of living granite waist-
high, and realized that they perched
near the roof of a vast subterranean
abyss. On either side the ledge ex-
tended unbroken, an observation plat-
form for the long-vanished citizens
of the Raba Depression.

  “This must have been a zoological
garden, a living museum of Earth/'
whispered Lois softly.

  The cavern floor, a thousand feet
below, was almost five miles in length
and half as wide. And three-fourths

of its area was island-rimmed water!

 Directly beneath them a grassy
miniature tableland sprouted oddly
familiar structures of stone—castles
and crazily constructed little huddles
of thatched huts. The castles, foUr
in all, were in ruins, but about the
last of them to the right, two-legged
figures were moving. There, too, were
a few patches of tilled ground with
rowed dottings of cultivated green.

  And rimming the lake, basking in
the all-pervading glow of light simi-
lar to that of the corridor, lifted a
mighty tangled forest of familiar, and
unfamiliar, trees.

  “Those wild men were Earthmen!"
Lee moved slightly away from the
girl’s too-obvious nearness. “I thought
their structure was decidedly unMar-
tian, too-slight lung capacity."

  “Must be old King Raba Dagan had
quite a zoo." Lois lolled on the rocky
parapet’s flat top and studied the
scene below. “Suppose there's another
cave like this for Venusian fauna
and stuff?”

  Lee massaged a knuckle thought-
fully. He nodded. “Ufa huh. Those
murals, those paintings, were adver-
tising the wonders of the strange life
imprisoned here.

  “This is a paradise, though. All this
water. Means NMI won’t have to close
down after all."

  Lois’s laugh was nasty. “If we can
get topside, yes. Don’t forget the sand
has covered the opening and your sig-
nal is buried. We may be trapped here
forever."

  “I hope not. Probably by now Lopez
is starting to hunt for us. Or soon
will be. And the crack in the dome
may be uncovered again."

  “Isn't it thrilling, though, Gramp?"
giggled Lois. “We’re like castaways
—Adam and Eve in a garden—Har-
veth and Elise on Luna."

  “Martian hill-dog and a desert cat
in a bag more likely," said Lee dryly.
“And we’re not alone, either. Look,
coming."

  She turned to look in the direction
his hand gun indicated, to the left.
They saw a tall, broad-shouldered
man, his thick black beard like a mane
down across his hairy chest, and an
ancient explosive-type rifle in his
hand. His only garment was a rough,
but effective, swathing of animal hide
about his hips. He was less than
twenty feet from them and the small
black eye of the rifle was upon them.

  Behind the savage-apj>earing crea-
ture clustered a dozen of the twisted
dwarfs, more beasts than men, that
they had already encountered.

FOR A LONG moment they front-
ed one another, unmoving, before
the stranger’s weapon dropped away
and his beard split to reveal uneven
white teeth. His voice was deep and
unsteady, the words blurred by alien
pronunciation.

  “Good day, sirs,” he said, apparent-
ly mistaking Lois’s golden slacks and
brown jacket for a masculine outfit.

 “Greetings, Thug,” chirped Lois.
She grinned at Lee’s warning frown.
In an undertone she demanded, “Isn’t
that a perfectly good caveman title?”

  Lee grunted something about fools
and their heads ending in two sepa-
rate sectors of space.

  “Hello,” he said quietly. “Earth-
man?”

 “Indeed I am,” said the bearded
giant, advancing. “We are all Earth-
men.” His arm indicated the motley
knot of little monsters at his heels.

  “But you are more recently arrived,
eh?”

 The big man grimaced his under-
standing. “Thirty years ago my father
found this horrible place. He came
from the desert after his ship was
crushed in landing.”

  Lee’s eyes were shining. “The first
spacers landed about then. What is
your father’s name?”

 “Grant Ashley. He is dead now.”
He pulled an ancient pocket-watch of
worn soft gold from a pouch beneath

his great beard. “One hundred twenty
days and—almost an hour from now

—ago.”

  Lois bowed her head over it. “I
see,” she laughed, “how you knew
thirty years have passed. You couldn’t
miss seeing this.

  “But you don’t look to be that old.”
The big man’s eyes were fixed on
the girl. He took a step toward her,
hands clawed in a horrible, hungry
sort of way, and then another. A
ghastly bubbling cry of misery and
unbelieving joy wrung from his lips.

 “A woman—an Earth woman,”
he mumbled. “Always they told me I
must mate with the ugly little shes.
But now G’Ash has a woman.”

  Lois backed away uncertainly,- get-
ting behind Lee. Lee grimaced with
distate, but held his ground.

  “My woman,” he said. “Sorry.”
“Then I must fight you for her.”
The big savage dropped his rifle and
bared his teeth. Then, in imitation of
Lee, “sorry.”

  Lee shook his head. “The little hes
may fight so over their women. Not
so real Earthmen. They let the woman
choose.”

 The bearded man scratched his
shaggy head. His beard again covered
his teeth. He grunted grudging as-
sent, but he continued to regard Lois
hungrily. Lee knew the truce would
not last.

  “My father married a little she,”
he told Lee and the girl. He pointed
down into the cavern valley toward
the castle with the cultivated fields.
“Mine,” he added proudly, “you come
there, please?”

 “How many of the dwarf-men are
there?” Lee wanted to know as they
studied the valley.

  G’Ash fiddled with his huge splayed
fingers, his lips moving as he counted
laboriously and silently.

 “Maybe sixty-one, sixty-two or
three, perhaps. Some have rebelled
and hide in the forests or In the val-
ley of the Frog People.”
34

OUf OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

 Lee nodded. “The Venusians.
Where does it open off this valley?"

  G’Ash indicated the dark opening
at the left-hand end of the valley.
“There,” he said savagely. “Some day
I will lead my people into it again/'
“Are there other valleys, more
lakes?”

 The bearded man grunted. “At
other end of the cavern. But all is
water there, and the light is bad, al-
most gone. Also huge swimming
things fill the water.”

  Lee looked at Lois, and then, mean-
ingly, down into the cavern. She
shook her head slightly. He turned
to G’Ash.

  “We must return to our friends,”
he said, extending his hand, “but we
will return again soon.”

  The big man scowled, but he took
Lee’s hand. Suddenly he jerked the
flyer toward him and his other fist
crunched into Lee’s jaw. A second
blow landed on his temple and he
felt his legs crumpling under him.
Feebly he struggled to strike back,
to reach his expoder.

  He heard Lois screaming, and he
saw the pipestem crooked legs of the
degenerate warriors about him, with
the last fading senses. Then cool stone
was crushing his lips and nose and
he knew no more.

HE WAS PENNED in a time-
weathered dungeon, light seep-
ing through yard-thick walls of
masonry, and silvering the cobwebs
festooning the falls and ceilings. His
bed was a heap of mildewed weeds
and reeds on a low stone platform,
and in the cell’s center a tiny spring
bubbled up. From this a tiny rill
crossed the rocky floor and vanished
into a gaping cavity wider than a
man’s skull.

  Lee went to the narrow slit of the
single window, standing on a heap of
debris to do so. He looked out over
the weedy patches of cultivated
ground, and saw the willow-grown

border of the lake. In the garden plots
misshapen little women worked, their
naked flesh a hideous, fish-belly white.
And grotesque little dogs played with
unsmiling tiny children upon the un-
cut grass between the gardens.

  The inbred, simple-minded inhabit-
ants of this hidden Eden beneath
the ruddy desert, never laughed, and
Lee, only once, heard their unin-
telligible speech raised in a broken
sort of song. The proud knights and
their humble serfs, brought here from
Earth, had fallen far from their early
estate.

  Lee tested the walls, searching for
loose masonry that could be removed.
He tried the warped metal door, and
found it to be strengthened by a sec-
ond sturdy gate of interlocked logs
and branches. Last of all he examined
the ceiling, a dozen feet overhead,
and found it had suffered least of all
in the passing years.

  His only hope of escape seemed to
be through the opening cut into the
walls by the spring’s overflow, and
toward this he started to move. But
a sound of shuffling feet in the corri-
dor beyond arrested his steps and he
faced the doorway. The overlooked
clip of needles was worthless as a
weapon.

  G’Ash stood in the doorway, a fire-
blackened lump of flesh, its white-
jointed bone protruding, in his left
hand. In his other fist was Lee’s
needle-expelling hand gun. He tossed
the hunk of meat at Lee.

 “Your woman fled from me,” he
complained, his forehead wrinkled.
“She hides in the forest beside the
lake with the rebellious people.”
“Good for her,” said Lee. “I told
you we Earthlings allow the women
to choose.”

 “You must summon her,” ordered
G’Ash. “Then When she is close I can
capture her.”

  “Go in a vacuum,” Lee told him. He
gnawed at a huge mouthful of the
underdone meat.
UNDER MARTIAN SANDS

35

  “You refuse?” G*Ash took a threat-
ening step forward.

  Lee gave the bone and most of the
meat back to the bearded giant—in
the teeth! He followed the hurled
missile with his fists and the weight
of his tough sand boots. But the big
man weathered the storm easily. One
big hand seized Lee and hurled him,
stunned, against the further wall of
the dungeon.

  He paused only to pick up the mis-
used joint of meat.

 “When you grow hungry,” he
roared, “you will be glad to call your
woman for me.”

  Lee felt the numbness leaving his
battered flesh. He made no sign he
knew G’Ash was about. Instead he
began masticating the mouthful of
meat he had retained.

 The bearded savage growled and
lunged off along the corridor beyond.
And as his footsteps grew inaudible
Lee came to his hands and knees and
crawled over to the spring to drink.
Then, despite the pain that every
movement brought, he lowered him-
self into the water-slimed cavity
where the little rill disappeared.

  His feet found a footing on a nar-
row ledge; then his elbows locked him
in the narrowness of the crooked
channel as he slowly descended. Once
he stuck fast and for perhaps twenty
minutes hung there with the falling
water saturating and chilling his
coveralls and the garments beneath.

  Then cloth ripped along his back
and he was precipitated suddenly
downward about eight feet into a
thigh-deep pool with a slimy mud
bottom. He groped about in the icy
depths, his solar torch gone along
with his hand gun, and came up a
gradual slope of possibly twenty feet
in all, to a waterless expanse of rock.

  The echoes, hollow and booming,
of his boots on the rocky floor, in-
formed him that he was inside a lower
cavity of considerable area. He groped
along the edge of the pool, found

where it overflowed, and followed the
escaping thread of water.

  He squeezed through narrow slits
in the rocky walls and traversed vast
chambers where a faint rippling play
of electricity revealed inky pools and
lakes. He heard splashings that only
living things could make, and he
armed himself as best he could with
a keen-edged splinter of rock twice
as large as his palm. In the depths,
darting trails of pale light marked
the passage of the watery denizens.

  Three times he 6lept, his cramped
limbs and aching muscles awakening
him before he was rested. He was
hungry, his stomach crying out for
the food that successfully evaded his
attempts to scoop it from the growing
bitterness of the cavern pools.

 Then came the moment when he
wriggled upward through a narrow-
ing slot of dank rock above the gur-
gling rush of piled-up water. And
saw light ahead!

  Once beyond the narrowing of the
walls he hobbled along a widening
ledge for a hundred yards—and
emerged through a trailing curtain of
Venusian thidin vines, and lacy, crim-
son-hued swamp air, into a watery
valley yet larger than that of the
Earthmen.

  Floating islands of thidin dotted
the foggy surface of the steaming
lake, and along the narrow shoreline
the fruit-heavy bushes of the nik-nik
clustered. Their orange^hued husks
were specked scarlet.

  Lee ate the ripe fruit, the faded
globes of brown with the enlarged
splotches of red, as slowly as his
hunger permitted. Nor did he have
his fill of the crisp salmon-hued pulp
and its thumb-sized black seeds when
he reluctantly pushed off into the pale
jungle.

HE SLEPT once before he discov-
ered the linking passageway
with the Earth cavern. It was near
the mile-high arch of the cavern’s
36

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

roof and led upward. A well-worn
trail had grooved the stubborn sur-
face of rock to a depth of an inch.

  In the Venusian cavern he had only
once seen a noseless, gray-hued Frog.
And that lop-eared aborigine had been
paddling a living raft of thidin out
in the lake. Of the Earthmen reputed
to have taken refuge in the lower val-
ley he saw not a sign.

  He emerged, hours later, into a tree-
roofed tunnel piercing the forest. He
had taken but a dozen steps along
this narrow way, when a tangle of
vines and braided ropes of hide and
grass, fell about him.

 He struggled despairingly, his
keen-edged stone slashing madly. Yet
for every strand he severed., two or
three more nooses fell about him. At
last he lay helpless.

  Three of the crooked beast-men of
the lost cavern gathered about him,
prancing proudly, and thumbing the
points of their rusty dagger-like
knives suggestively. And then a
pleased gurgle of laughter made him
turn his head in the other direction.

  Lois Banton bent over him and be-
gan loosing the cocoon of ropes. She
had changed greatly in the short time
they had been apart, and Lee won-
dered if perhaps more than four or
five days by Martian reckoning, had
passed. For under her flapping ragged
garments the muscles moved lithely,
and the superfluous flesh had melted
from her face.

  ‘‘Have you loose in a minute,” she
said. “O’Lar, you and K’Tton help
me. B’Ron can keep watch."

  “Glad you’re still free,” grunted
Lee. And was amazed to discover that
he really meant it.

  “We’ve been trying to locate you/*
said Lois. “But this eternal dayshine
is bad. Only at the sleeping hour did
we dare venture from the forests.”

  The last of the ropes fell away and
Lee stood up. He saw now that Lois
had an ancient-looking, cross-hilted
sword in a clumsy scabbard of dried

black leather, and that two of the
squatty, club-armed hunters wore
floppy sleeveless jerkins of battered
chain mail.

  “Found the armory of one castle,”
explained Lois, noting his curious
gaze. “Never did get to rescue you,
though. Our friend with the beard
kept a guard posted.” She cocked an
eyebrow. “How’d you do it?”

 Lee explained his escape. She
nodded.

  “I’ve been in the other cavern once.
Frogs aren’t friendly any more since
O'Lar”—she indicated the largest of
the three renegade dwarfs—“refused
to let them eat his woman.”

 “They understand English then
and speak it!"

  Lois grinned in a superior fashion.
“Naturally. Ashley tried to teach
them modern English among other
things. He was horribly crippled,
often lay helpless for weeks. Result
of spacer’s crash. So his brief attempts
at schooling them accomplished
little.”

  Lee dug into his inner pockets,
his hand emerging at last with the
useless clip of biaton needles for his
captured hand gun. He showed them
to the girl.

  “If you’ll let me have that dagger,”
he said, pointing to the blade she
carried thrust through her sword-belt,
“I’ll try manufacturing a bomb.”
Lois handed it over reluctantly.
“Needles are dangerous to tinker
with, aren’t they?” she demanded.

  “Uh huh. But we can't cut our way
through to the dome-lifts with just
clubs and a sword. Not against an ex-
poder and a high-powered rifle.”

  Lee seated himself beside the trail,
and, motioning the others away, set
to work on the delicate task of ex-
posing the metal-encased pinpoint of
explosive biaton at the tip of three
needles. In his hand gun the razor-
edged trimmer key armed the needles
only as they were expelled, to ex-
plode upon contact with anything

more substantial than air. But this
way he was holding in his hands a
death more susceptible than nitro*
glycerin to sudden jolts.

 With sticky gum from a bruised
tree he gingerly sealed all the needles
into their clip, leaving the three
armed needles projecting further.
Then he looped a slender strip of hide
about the deadly thing and ran the
thong up and over a low limb, secur-
ing the other end with a loosely
driven peg.

  Directly beneath the clip of explo-
sive needles lay a barely exposed reef
of greenish-gray rock where only
lichens and moss could root. Last
of all he knotted another thin strand
of hide about the peg and -ran it,
knee-high, across the trail where he
quickly and properly secured it to
another limb.

  His death trap, clumsy though it
was, was complete. Now he must lure
the childish bearded giant into it.

  Even as he plotted the man’s de-
struction he could not but feel pity
for the poor brute. Had the man been
unarmed or alone he would have
risked capturing him with snares, or
even attempted to escape from the
cavern without further conflict.

  But he could take no chances on
the bearded giant recapturing or kill-
ing them. News of this plentiful sup-
ply of the fluid life-blood of Mars
must be carried outside whatever the
cost.

  G’Ash must die.

  Lee started down the trail toward
the castles and then retraced his
steps. He tore the cord from the limb
and knotted other lengths to it. The
blank-faced beast-men and the girl
regarded him curiously.

  At a distance of a hundred yards,
well inside the tunnel toward the
Venusian cavern, he posted Lois with
the looped end of the cord in her
grip.

  “We must be sure it is their leader,”
he said. “A wandering animal or

dwarf might set off the bomb. Can you
do it?”

  The girl’s lips tightened, but her
grave eyes were steady on Lee’s.

  “Certainly,” she said simply.

TWICE Jud Lee showed himself
briefly, he could not be too ob-
vious, before G’Ash and ten of his
brute-men came charging out of the
ruined castle after him.

  At first he ran easily, allowing
G’Ash to gain on him, and then he
was sprinting desperately to keep
safely in advance. The prodigious
bounds of G'Ash put him far in ad-
vance of his hairy followers.

 He passed the ledge of exposed
stone but a dozen paces in advance of
the bearded savage, a lead that was
swiftly being whittled down, and
then flung himself to the left behind
a sheltering inky black boulder.

  There was a terrible explosion.

  He stood up at last, ears ringing,
and looked back toward the shallow
pit in the trail. He saw G’Ash weapon-
less and broken, his eyes and fore-
head a bloody mass of ripped flesh,
crawling sightlessly toward him!

  Lois had given the rope too late
a tuS» probably waiting for him to
reach shelter, and G'Ash was beyond
its full fury.

  He ran around the blinded man to
where the satiny metal of his hand
gun shone and sent a burst of explo-
sive needles over the cowering heads
of the hairy men. They broke before
this new menace, raced back along the
way they had come.

 Then he turned back toward the
crawling bloody mass of flesh that
was G’Ash, reluctant to destroy him,
yet knowing that the man was better
dead. In all the Earth cavern only
G’Ash might lead an attack against
them.

  But the bearded savage had disap-
peared. Nor did a half hour of search-
ing uncover his trail.

  “I’m glad he escaped,” said Lois.

as they climbed the winding ramps
to the upper gallery and the lifts.
“We have the guns now. In a few
minutes we’ll be in the dome,”

  “I feel the same/’ admitted Lee. “He
couldn't stop us now."

  They hurried along the shining cor-
ridor, the three rebellious beast men
accompanying them, and Lee had time
to consider the future. The storm
would be long over now. He could
tunnel out through the sand and burn
outsized symbols on the dome. Then
they could return to the depths until
help arrived.

  They passed the unlighted strip of
tunnel, where the clean-stripped
bones of the two beast men lay, and
came to the lift.

  Lee halted, his throat constricting,
and the girl squeezed his arm sym-
pathetically.

  The huddle of equipment, pressure
suits, helmets, sand spade, and spare
belts, was gone! The dusty floor of
the passage was empty. Where it had
lain, the imprint of splayed naked
feet was yet visible. G’Ash and his
warriors had carried them off and
they might never be found again.

 In fact the curiosity of G’Ash
might impel him to tear the suits and
pumps apart, to ruin them hopelessly.

  He looked at Lois, and her eyes
were steady and calm. Like him she
must have been digesting the knowl-
edge that they were trapped here now
for a long time. For he doubted his
ability to contrive a workable pres-
sure suit and pumps out of the crude
materials at hand.

  The thought of enduring her con-
stant companionship was not unpleas-
ant, now that privation and danger
had revealed the real character that
years of self-indulgence had failed
to destroy. They’d quarrel, and she
would insult him and bully him un-
mercifully at times, he knew.

  She must have sensed what he was
thinking. Wordlessly she came closer
and lifted her face toward his.

 “Break it up,” a muffled voice
sounded behind them. They turned.

 “Lopez!” cried Lee. “How’d you
find us?”

  Lopez finished removing his hel-
met, revealing a trim moustache and
handsome features. His smile was
dazzling and all for the girl.

  “This fortune-hunter making trou-
ble?” he inquired maliciously.

  Lee shook his partner’s shoulders.
“How?” he demanded.

  Lopez waved an airy hand. “That?
Nothing! Plotted direction of storm’s
path and your last position. Discov-
ered dome, explored same, and here
I am.”

 He turned again to the amused
girl.

  “Now,” he said warmly, “you are
safe at last, Miss Banton. I, Vincent
Lopez, will see that no harm befalls
you. There is nothing to fear. . , .”

  “Except you,” supplied Lee, grin-
ning* “Come along, Lois. Let’s show
our friend what paradise looks like.”

  Lois came to him, her eyes smil-
ing, and they led the way again to
the stone balcony overlooking the
valley.

            Had she betrayed humanity's last stronghold to

  By J. HARVEY HAGGARD

ERA! YOU SPACE
gypsy! You’ve be-
trayed us, here in the
Dante’s Ridges of Ur-
anus—the last out-
post of man—”

  I’ll not forget her
soon, standing there in the green rays
of the twin moons, while above us,
the blue ships of the Jovians, like
giant malignant crystals, edged over
the jagged escarpments and began
descending.

  “They’re looking for me/’ she had
said simply. “I was to meet them
here.”

  She didn’t lock like a traitress. For
that matter, she didn’t seem to “be-
long” in the hidden chem-laboratories,
though that was where her cunning
little mind had wrought seeming mir-
acles. Her face was oval, sweet and
enchanting like that of a sprite, with

large blue eyes that melted my heart
away every time she so much as
looked at me. Even in the rugged garb
of a fighting scout, her slender figure
possessed an allure that was astonish-
ing. For those same garments, on
others, looked worn and ugly. A short
kilt, a high breast vestment, with red
celluline space boots.

  I said, “Mera, you’re crazy. Your
brain’s got the whirling orbits. You’re
coming away with me, whether you
like it or not.” I seized her bodily
then, but she struggled, and her blue
eyes looked into mine, and her tiny
ruby lips brushed my own. “My dar-
ling,” I breathed, but she protested.
My muscles went to water—but I
kissed her. Yes, there with the Jov-
ians wheeling down li'ke ravenous
buzzards searching for carrion, I
thrilled to the embrace of those soft,
small arms.

 “Not now, Jan. The Jovians are
coming. Later perhaps, when that blue
demon they call their Napoleon of
space has ceased to plague the uni-
verse with his existence."

  I looked away, following her gaze.
She was staring at the towering
heights far away, capped with eternal
snows of frozen air. There were the
last remnants of our people. Survivors
of Earth! Last warriors of the human
race, who had been driven here by the
blue hordes of Jove. Their armada
of fighting-crystals had swept down
across the solar system in a seemingly
endless array. Jnu Latha, their giant
blue leader, had become a terrible leg-
end among Earthmen. It was said that,
having the strength born of a might-
ier planet, he had once met ten Earth-
men barehanded, and had slain them.
Jnu Latha, it was said, was immortal.
And it was the fearful, hating Earth-
men who had dubbed him the “Napo-
leon of Space."

  “He's driven us from planet to plan-
et, Jan," said Mera. “We’re lost if we
keep on fighting, the way we have
done. And besides, I’m not betraying
you. Just disobeying orders, remem-
ber—"

  And there, with the crystal-raiders
of Jove hurtling down like tangible
thunderbolts, I did remember. Three
days before she had come from the
makeshift cave laboratories with an
impossible scheme.

  “Even a Napoleon cannot win for-
ever,” she’d explained. “We might
take a lesson from Terrestrial his-
tory."

  “We’re outnumbered, yes," I had
retorted through gritting teeth, “but
Jnu Latha can be killed. I know he
can."

  “It was indicated,’’ continued Mera,
“at the autopsy of Napoleon Bona-
parte, or so the ancient histories go,
that 'his later battles were lost because
of a failing pituitary gland. As its
functioning lessened, lethargy and
fat-headedness resulted."

  “Then lets hope Jnu Latha's blue
neck begins to shrivel!" I had explod-
ed contemptuously. “Then three more
wishes, cross your fingers in a magical
symbol, and spit over your left—"

 “But you can do the same thing
with rays," she had protested. “I’ve
done it in the lab, and I can do it
again with a tiny portable lamp that
can be hidden in my clothing. Its
invisible waves will spray out and
destroy the vital glands slowly—•"

  “And you propose to enter the camp
of the enemy, train your rays on his
glands, and wait until he becomes too
lethargic to command his troops! Ab-
surd. Before you do that I will have
sliced his head from his shoulders
with my sword. Don't even talk of
such a thing."

  She hadn't, but her little lips had
set tightly, and now on the next scout-
ing expedition she told me how she
had communicated with the Jovians
on an ionic-beam, promising to meet
them and betray the Earthmen’s
whereabouts.

  I	whipped a dagger from a sheath,
a wavering sliver of gleaming metal.

  “You win!" I exclaimed dubiously.
“But take care of yourself, Mera.
Keep this for your own protection.
You can keep it hidden. When you
pin this blade in your garment the
jeweled haft looks like an ornament."

  She shrugged helplessly as I slid
the blade into her harness vestment,
leaving only the hilt visible, a scin-
tillating crescent of precious stones.
As a lethal weapon for protection it
was now perfectly hidden. None would
guess that it was anything but
jewelry.

  Then I turned and ran up a tortuous
channel between high buttes. I might
have remained, might have died fight-
ing in vain. As the ogreish figures
leaped in, I might have taken many
blue savages of a distant planet to
the hell-limbo they call Kzku, but I
would most certainly have been slain
in the end. I am not afraid of death,
JUPITER NAPOLEON

but somehow I couldn't think of it
as long as Mera Thraddock was alive,
a virtual prisoner among the myrmi-
dons of Jove.

TWO KECALDES. The retrograde
Ariel had circled the planet three
times in its satellite orbit. That was
the Jovian means of measurement for
the passing time. Long tormenting
weeks, as measured by Terrestrial
clocks. The Jovians were encamped in
the fertile floor of a huge extinct
crater, while we of Earth were en-
trenched in mountainous grottoes, liv-
ing on glue-bugs and those creeping
monstrosities we managed to trap in
the caves. Skirmishes were frequent
during that time, but indecisive. The
Earth Commandant gave the order to
attack under the third saffron moon's
wan rays during the late hours of
night.

  It was a slim chance, but we were
becoming desperate. That night ten
thousand rugged Terrestrial ghosts
rose over the edge of the crater's maw
and leaped silently downward. Fate
smiled. The Jovian tribes had been
overconfident; only the dominance of
Jnu Latha had served to hold con-
flicting creeds together. There were
but few sentinels, and these were so
unwary that we overcame them with
little noise. Then we were down
among the fibre shelter-spreads,
raygats snarling forth paeans of
death."

 We were like demons risen from
the grave of the past. Madness surged
within our breasts; we fought like
supermen. History marks that day. No
use to repeat an accounting of that.
The blue Jovians, leaderless and un-
organized, were slain like the cattle

they are as they fled in cowardly
panic. But they did not escape our
avenging beams. I led a detachment
up an escarpment that teemed with
blue warriors, and with those Earth-
ly hellions at my back, we left a
shambles along the terrace below the
rich Jovian tent-furnishings of the
warlord.

  In the inner chamber I found Mera.
She stood before a curtained hanging,
and looking past, I could see Jnu
Latha, the Napoleon of space, who
seemed to be sleeping.

^ “Mera Thraddock!" I exclaimed
jubilantly. “You glorious little space-
minx. Blazing Universes! That wild
plot paid off at a thousand to one.
You’re all right, Mera?" She nodded.

  “Even as Napoleon," she said, draw-
ing the gossamer curtain aside.

  “History repeats itself," I ac-
claimed. “It was indicated that a
great Terrestrial general lost his lead-
ership qualities because a gland
failed—and now—and now—” It was
hard to think of Jnu Latha, who had
been so dynamic and ruthless, as a
sluggard, a mold of human flesh, or
sub-human as it were, held captive by
internal secretions. But Mera was
shaking her head.

  I	frowned, strode into the farther
chamber.

  The Jovian was nof sleeping. His
repose was more fixed than that. Upon
his naked blue breast glistened a curi-
ous little ornament, a crescent of glit-
tering jewels, nestled like a sting-
ing bee.

  A drop of green blood formed, dim-
ming the sparkling hilt as it fell down
upon the bare knees of the Napoleon
of Space, whose darkening blue flesh
was becoming cold as clay.
THE CITY OF

Burkeson and the men from America figured the interplanetary
expedition in search of an invincible weapon was going to be
a cinch. There was nothing to stop them—just a lot of silly
Martian music boxes floating in the air . . . until Burkeson
blundered on the key that unlocked the symphony from HelL

  Hopkins, all of them
  ^ Jkm.	gone. Burkeson sat in

the rocket * shadow and thought
about them; and, hearing the rapid
change in the city’s symphonic voice.
Burkeson knew that soon he would go,
and then the rocket would go. And

after that—

  His laughter was shrill in the thin
Martian night, echoing against the
rocket’s skin, and drifting off across
the red desert. In his laugh was a
crazy climbing note of lonely fear.

  That mounting thunderous destruc-
tion in the music of the city—what
an awful difference, he thought wild-
ly and stared info the shadows of dis-
tant city spires. It’s all through the
music now, the corruption and hate,
and it's growing and growing, and
we taught them—

 The symphony's theme was
changed, forever, to the horror that
never existed here before the rocket
came. Harmonies and sustained notes
in the Minor were creeping in. The
sombreness of the key of G, the brutal
sinister and gloom dramatic violence
of C, and the sad agitation of E.

  He wondered how long before it
changed enough to be able to destroy
him, too, with its hate.

  It was funny, he thought, but that

42

first night, when we landed, none of
us, except Clevenger, knew why we
were here, but they sensed the pur-
pose. And at first, no one knew what
to do, and no one was aware of the
music. . . .

FIRST, the necessary routine stuff.
The testing of atmosphere, and
the observation of surrounding ter-
rain from the safety of the rocket's
interior. There was the familiar Canal,
the distant city, the barren moun-
tains, dead sea-bottoms. And that was
all. No eight-legged beasts or giant
birds under the double moons.

  Then they got out and stretched
and breathed the clean crisp air, and
looked at each other as though not
quite sure they actually had arrived
and were on the Martian desert, or
whether they were merely ghosts of
an idea.

  They were spared the excitement
of surprise at finding the canals and
the city, for that had been observed
and charted through the Palomar eye.
Burkeson felt the music at once, but
remained silent as he tried to analyze
it. The others didn't seem to hear it.
His hyper-sensitive and musically
trained inner ear registered the
sounds that were apparently inaudi-
ble to the others. A delicious alien
sensation seemed to swim through
him with his throbbing blood.

  Captain Ballance, a blond, neatly
SINGING CUBES

uniformed giant, stood and looked at
the distant spires of the gleaming
city.

  “The big question is,” he said,
“—life.” And the others were obvious-
ly thinking of that too. Burkeson’a
head was cocked to one side, puzzled
wonderment in his eyes. No one no-
ticed his odd reaction. Burkeson was
an oddity anyway, a dreamer, an un-
realistic sort, except in his specialized
field of audio engineering, and elec-
tronics.

  Ferrell, the atomics man, was sift-
ing sand through his fingers and no-
ticing that it felt much like any other
sand would feel anywhere, on Man-
hattan or Long Beach. Lt. Dobson
was breaking out a case of rations for
a little celebration, though no one

seemed festive. Ferrell walked over
beside Burkeson and Ballance. He
also looked at the distant city. Its
softly shifting pastel harmonies flick-
ered in the moonlight.

  “Beautiful,” Burkeson whispered.
Ferrell said. “The question is, how
alien is life here likely to be?” His
small fat body shivered, and he
folded his arms. “Maybe we can't get
along with ’em. Maybe they’ll be su-
per-intelligent, or savages. In either
case, maybe they’ll be so different,
we'll never be able to get anyplace
with ’em.”

  Capt. Ballance’s cold hard face
turned to the big neutron cannon
mounted between the rocket's two
skin casings. His voice was grimly
final, “We’re not worried, Ferrell.”

43
44

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

  Burkeson said softly. “But where
would we want to get with them?
That’s the thing I want to know.
There hasn’t been any enthusiasm
here like you’d expect on a first flight
to Mars. It’s all too grim! I want to
know what we’re doing here?”

 “Why do humans do anything?”
Ballance said. “Might as well ask that.
Why did western culture expand, and
murder primitives by the millions just
to expand? Who the devil knows?
Economics, instinct, geography, a
complexity of causes. There may not
be any general reason we’re on Mars
now, except that it’s just a way-sta-
tion to keep on expanding.”

  Clevenger came up with a bottle of
beer in his white hand and a thin
smile on his sardonic face. Clevenger,
the North American Defense Federa-
tion Representative, whose presence
lowered Ballance’s title of captain to
only a name. As a representative of
the NADF, Clevenger was part owner
of half the world, and his words di-
rectly affected the private and gen-
eral lives of billions.

  Clevenger said. “You spoke with
broad generality, Captain. Now that
we’re here, and not just because our
aesthetic comrade, Burkeson, has spe-
cifically asked for it, I think we
should all know why we’re here. Get
any romantic nonsense out of your
heads, men. This is business.” He
looked at the city. Hungrily, Burke-
son thought.

  “We’re here to see if there’s any-
thing we can use,” Clevenger said
softly. “Especially in the way of—
weapons.”

BURKESON was sick. For a sec-
ond, he forgot the strange music
from the city. All this planning, and
expense, and the dreams man had al-
ways had of going to the stars—the
great black mystery of space, broken
—and for what? A better weapon!

  Oh Lord, he thought, what could
be more horrible than that, more of

an indictment! He noticed that none
of the others seemed to care about
Clevenger’s disclosure. A lifetime of
militarized regimentation had dulled
their imaginative faculties. This thing
was routine to them! It was incred-
ible to Burkeson, sickening.

  He said. “It seems very quiet and
peaceful, but it isn’t. Can any of you
hear anything? There’s music, very
muted and slow and much of it lost
to our hearing because of frequency,
but it fills the air.”

 He leaned toward the city. The
others stopped whatever they were
doing and listened. Perhaps they still
didn’t notice as strongly as did
Burkeson, but as they listened, they
began to hear shades of what Burke-
son had been hearing.

  For a while no one said anything,
then Clevenger smiled thinly and
arrogantly, and said:

  “Probably got a big band out to
welcome us. Probably terrified at our
landing, might even think we’re gods
or something. I’d suggest that we
break out weapons from the arms
locker, Captain, and trek over to the
city and see what’s what. The city
actually might support some kind of
life that knows we’ve landed, and are
preparing a little surprise welcome
for us!”

  Burkeson closed his eyes. Oh, Lord.
A band/ ‘His compatriots didn’t un-
derstand at all. They haven’t any
idea what it is, this music, nor what
kind of highly evolved aesthetics are
necessary to create such glorious
sound.

  Ballance nodded the necessary or-
ders. Two men remained to guard
the rocket. The rest moved on to the
city, armc<3 with neutron rifles and
revolvers, and one man carrying a
compression gun firing atomic war-
head shells.

  As they approached the city, the
music seemed to swell until Burkeson
felt that he was breathing it. Ecstasy
trembled through him so that he
THE CITY OF SINGING CUBES

45

could hardly force himself to walk
on toward the heart of the sound.

  He knew now that he never really
had heard music before, but only the
most awkward ignorant primitive at-
tempts to create it. He had a vague
and magnificent hint now of what
music was.

  But—it was too perfect, too big and
too beautiful for human senses. He
grabbed Ballance’s arm so that the
captain stopped and consequently the
group stopped.

  “I don't think we should go any
further, Sir.”

  “What'6 that, Burkeson?”

 “I don't think it’s safe. That
sound’s the result of highly special-
ized development, Sir. It’s a kind of
perfection that maybe the rest of you
haven't sensed as easily as I have. I’m
trained for sound. I’ve a faint idea
what mastery of audio engineering is
necessary to produce a symphony like
this. It means they’re way ahead of
us in sonic science, which could mean
they’re away ahead of us, period. They
might be hostile, and unwilling to
waste time in getting acquainted. I’d
suggest that we wait and try to figure
out exactly what we’re really up
against.”

  Clevenger laughed. Hatred for him
and his egotistical laughter hit Burke-
son, hard.

  “What kind of so-called logical
reasoning is that, Burkeson? If you’re
afraid, admit it. But we can’t afford
to. If there’s any intelligent life here,
we’ve got to impress them with our
lack of fear, our superiority. And
we’ve got to maintain that impression
even if we have to put on a demon-
stration of force!”

  Several voices shouted agreement,
All the voices joined in with a roar
of agreement, except Burkeson. Some-
one sneered at him.

  They walked on toward the city,
though more slowly now. The volume
of delicate yet voluminous sound
swelled. And inside Burkeson the

  ecstasy grew with it And also a hint
of fear.

T\ELICATE RIBBONS of blue
pastel highway curved into the
city. There were no gates, no walls
around it. There weren’t any cannon
on the parapets, nor any sign of
armed men on guard. There is just a
city, Burkeson thought, and the mu-
sic.

  “No trouble here,” Clevenger said
triumphantly. “If there are people
here, I’ve an idea they'll be malleable.
It’s obvious they’re not set up for
any kind of defense. Probably in some
stage of decadence. Civilized and
progressive peoples are always set up
to defend themselves against any at-
tack.”

 The words grated in Burkeson's
mind.

  Then they stood in the center of a
curving avenue in the moonlight and
looked and listened and wondered.
Spontaneous unease filtered among
them. Ballance stared into the soft
architectural beauty of the city, and
had his rifle pointing into the purple
shadows. Clevenger was analyzing
what he could through his eyes alone,
ignoring the music which was mean-
ingless to him and the others.

  He said. “I don't see any signs of
life. Just that longhair noise! Maybe
there isn't anything alive, and some-
thing's been playing this highbrow
racket mechanically for centuries!”

  Ballance said. “Whoever built this
city was advanced all right, like
Burkeson said. I hope there isn't any
life here. Make it easier for us, I
guess, to get what we need and get
out.”

  Clevenger said. “They must have
developed some pretty good weapons
too. Any highly civilized race has
terrific weapons. We’ll find such
weapons, whether there's any life
around or not!”

 Something moved past them. It
moved noiselessly, gliding over the
46

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

  gently curving walkway and into the
purple shadows. Ballance crouched.
Every man stood with weapon ready,
tensed and waiting. Very coolly, Clev-
enger said:

 “It was a cube, about half my
height, wasn’t it? It looked like metal
or some kind of shiny plastic, same
as the buildings. Wait, we won’t fol-
low it up yet. Take it easy. If they
show us any signs of trouble, blast!
Psychologically, we’ve got to show
them their place from the start.”

  Burkeson gagged. He stared past
Clevenger after the disappearing
cube. As it moved past, the cube had
glowed and pulsed with ever chang-
ing monochromatic light harmonies
which, Burkeson thought, would cor-
respond to the sound it was giving off
in the form of music.

 Burkeson knew that part of the
great orchestration rising from the
city came from this cube. It was an
instrument. He felt that it was alive,
that it was Martian life. He felt
strange because he seemed to know.
He didn’t see how he could know.

  He thought of a cube blasted with
neutron rifles, that instrumental per-
fection exploding, and the coloration
fading to corpse gray and freezing
there while the vast orchestration
over the city lost part of its com-
pleteness.

  Weapons! Always looking for bet-
ter and bigger weapons. Clevenger
represented North American Defense
Federation. The other half of the
world, the Asian Defense Union,
hadn’t been quite fast enough, and
NADF was on Mars first. Advanced
weapons that would break the bal-
ance-of-power deadlock between the
defense zones was sought.

  Bitter hate hit Burkeson again and
again as he listened to the swelling
music around him, the peaceful sta-
bility of the city. He felt like a beast
stalking into a patio, dripping bloody
saliva over a garden.

 Burkeson had never thoroughly

  conformed to regimentation. And he
had always expressed, in any small
individual way he knew, his intense
hatred for the prison militarism had
made of the world. All-out defensive
militarization had made people fit into
the machine, regardless of their nat-
ural abilities. Burkeson was an audio
engineer, an electronics man, and he
had been a composer until the big
draft. Since then, very little devotion
to music. He knew he hadn’t been ad-
justing any too well to his frustra-
tions.

 Everyone lived always with but
one thought: wait and prepare be-
cause someday they’ll attack. We
must be ready. And the other half of
the world lived always with but one
thought: wait and prepare because
someday they* 11 attack. We must be
ready.

  It didn’t make any sense of course,
Burkeson knew, because someday, no
one had any idea when, the delicate
balance of fear would topple one way
or the other and—poof! But no one
ever thought about that much any
more.

  It was always: invent a weapon a
little more horrible and gigantic than
they've got, so they'll be afraid to
attack us. And so the weapons got
bigger and more horrible on both
sides. The only thing was, there be-
gan to be a limit on what innovations
could be dragged up by physicists
and biochemists and biologists and
the fear-making psychologists. The
point was reached where there was
the search for one final weapon, cap-
able of completely wiping out the
others, without also destroying the
entire earth and everything on it.

  So come clear to Mars to find it,
Burkeson thought. And he smiled, his
mouth stretching taut like fine dark
wire. And if we don’t find the super
super weapon here, go on and on,
and explore the stars clear to Cen-
taur us. Find something more super
than anyone on Earth can create.
THE CITY OF SINGING CUBES

  So they looked for the super super
weapon.

  And the only thing they could find
was—music.

TtHE CUBES seemed to ignore
-L them, or else didn't sense their
presence at all. Communication with
the cubes was attempted, and aban-
doned. Everyone but Burkeson de-
cided they weren't alive. But no one
paid any attention to Burkeson, for
a while. His aesthetic philosophy was
too unrealistic and introverted, they
thought. But he did know his field
very well, sonics. And they finally
realized that if anything was to be
found out about the city, Burkeson
was the only one qualified to do it.

  They moved into a large beauti-
fully constructed hall in the heart of
the city, with plenty of equipment,
setting up headquarters for explora-
tion, for testing or attempting to test
the unknown elements of which the
city was built. And always trying to
figure whether the cubistic things
that moved silently over the floors and
along the shaded streets were intelli-
gent, whether they were alive, or or-
ganic, inorganic, or semi-organic, col-
loidal. Or what.

 They glowed with ever-changing
co-lor. And music came out of them,
always. For miles around and beyond
the city the giant orchestrations
could be heard. And in the city itself
the sound became something taken
for granted and almost unnoticed.
Except for Burkeson. He sat hour
upon hour, eyes closed, listening, his
mind reeling in clouds of magnificent
sound.

  Ballance called him in the next
afternoon. And Clevenger was there
to ask questions and demand answers.
Clevenger sat with his feet propped
up on a glowing cube that was con-
veniently not moving at the moment.
As Burkeson came in and saluted,
Clevenger deliberately ground his
cigarette out on the side of the cube.

  A piercing pain hit Burkeson as
though he had felt the burning coals.
The cube's coloration flickered with
momentary ugliness.

  Burkeson gasped. He leaned over
and almost grabbed Clevenger's arm.
Clevenger grinned.

  “It’s alive!" Burkeson whispered.
“I've told all of you that. These cubes
make the music we hear. This is their
city."

  Ballance said. “That isn't the ques-
tion, Burkeson."

  Clevenger said. “We need your ad-
vice. Looks as though this city is
geared strictly for sound. That's your
department. You mentioned that these
people—you call them that—are mas-
ters of sound. Could you elaborate?"

  Ballance said. “You mentioned to
Ferrell about communicating with
them."

 “I don't know," Burkeson said
stiffly. “Given time, I think we could.
I believe they're of a much higher in-
telligence than we'll ever be."

  Clevenger started, flushed slightly,
and his fingers started drumming on
the cube. “Matter of opinion of
course. I’m a little too proud of being
human to admit that. All I want to
know is, how do they function? Alive
or not, I’m sure no human will ever
find any emphatic response to them,
whatever they are."

  “Maybe not," Burkeson said. “But
it seems to me it should be obvious
that they’re intelligent, that this is
their city. I think we could recognize
them as being entitled to our respect.
They didn’t invite us here. This is
their planet, their city. They’ve found
a kind of ultimate peace and beauty
we’ll never be able to find."

  Ballance coughed. “We're not in-
terested in sociological problems
now, Burkeson. We've taken plenty
of photographic reels, and sound
tracks. But we’ve found no machin-
ery, no power plants. No evidence of
atomic or electrical power. We be-
lieve the cubes contain the secret, but
48

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

so far we’ve hesitated about tearing
one down to see what makes it tick.
You suggested ultrasonics—”

  Clevenger leaned toward Burkeson.
“I know a little about audio engineer-
ing. I know our scientists have been
working in that field for years, look-
ing for weapons. Ultrasonics in sol-
ids. I believe these cubes are ani-
mated machines. My idea is that
they’re machines that can keep them-
selves going by hidden sonic power.
That they’re robotics of some kind,
left by a dead civilization. What do
you think of that possibility, Burke-
son?”

  Tear one of them down. Music like
this—out of a machine—tear. . . .

 Somehow, Burkeson remained
calm, and underneath, he wanted to
kill. His hand shook, and he felt per-
spiration crawling down his face.

  “I’ve told you my opinion, Sir. I
think they’re alive and highly intelli-
gent. And so far above us that they
may not even realize yet we’re here.
They’re masters of ultra- and super-
sonics. City and individual life here
is supported by it. I think they com-
municate with each other by music,
a small part of which is audible to us.”

HE GOT UP then and stood so
that the cube was between him
and Clevenger. The individual in-
strumental music from the cube
seemed to envelope him in a separate
cloud of sound.

  He said. “They’ve developed along
much different lines than we have.
My idea is that now that we’ve started
exploring space, we can’t keep on
looking down on everything that’s
different than we are. Maybe these
cubes are partly mechanical in struc-
ture. This whole city is structured
for a vast communal interrelated ul-
trasonic life. I can explain something
about what controlled and focused
vibration can do to solids, what ultra-
sonic potentials are.

  “But I’m afraid you would find it

rather technical. For example, the
acoustic material of this city has been
chosen and built so as to make the
reverberation time the same for all
frequencies, resulting in the loudness
of all frequencies decaying at the
same rate. The acoustic material
shows a variation of absorption coef-
ficients. In other words, they’ve done
what our scientists could scarcely im-
agine. This city and the cubes are in
tune, you might say.

  “I think each cube is living and
intelligent, and is also a part of a
vast ultrasonic social culture, all
working in complete vibratory har-
mony to create and sustain their own
existence, to create music that’s lit-
erally an endless joyous sensual life
for them. It’s beauty that our senses
can’t imagine.

  "I’ve gotten an idea of what’s been
perfected here. These cubes can do
almost anything through their con-
trol of vibration, that’s the way I’ve
got it figured. You know yourselves
how we can use it for measuring, de-
tecting flaws, in processing foods,
drugs and chemicals, and as a catalyst
to speed up chemical reactions. You
know about the crystal type of ultra-
sonic unit that uses electrical energy
instead of air as a source of power,
and quartz crystals transform electri-
cal energy into mechanical vibrations.
Maybe these cubes operate on some-
what the same principle, infinitely
complicated. I don’t know.

  “I know about all that humans have
found out so far about ultrasonics.
Which is to say, practically nothing.
These cubes know everything about
it.

  “All I say is that I think these
cubes are alive, and that they’ve mas-
tered ultrasonics as well as the secret
of living in harmonious beauty.
Through extreme specialization, I
think they’ve completely mastered
their environment.”

  Clevenger said. "Very interesting
speculation. Except' that now we’re
THE CITY OF SINGING CUBES

49

part of their environment. Say, where
does all this humility come from,
Burkeson? Don't you like being hu-
man?”

  Burkeson didn't answer that. He
could have. He could have said that
during the last few hours, that ques-
tion had been bothering him. He was
uncertain.

 Ballance said. “Anything else,
Burkeson? About the cubes?”

  Burkeson shrugged. “My interest in
them is their complete mastery of
music. My interest, as you may re-
member,, was composing, before the
draft. I can tell you this to illustrate
their mastery of music, though this
is only a small part.

  “For example, to fairly represent
even the crudest kind of music, the
range of frequencies should be from
40 to 60, to 14,000 or 15,000 cycles.
And the acoustic power range above
the threshold of hearing should be
from 0 to 70 decibels without distor-
tion. Yet these people have gone 60
far beyond these ranges that my in-
struments are not worth anything.
And yet, I can understand something
of these people, and their culture.”
“But it's completely alien, isn't it,”
Clevenger smiled. “And there should
be no more hesitation about- tearing
these cubes down than in tearing
down a highly specialized ant-hill to
study it.”

  Burkeson felt his hands clench to
wet fists. “I’d rather try to work out
some means of communicating with
them, learn their secrets that way.
Maybe by subjective harmonics, and
non-linear response. If you want that
explained further—”

 “No! Forget explanations now."
Clevenger was on his feet. His face
was drum tight with anger. “This is
your specialty. We have only a few
more days here. And regardless of
your attitudes, we’re going to tear
down these cubes, Burkeson! And
you're ordered to oversee the job!”
He breathed deeply, then said. “If

they've developed this fantastic mas-
tery of ultrasonics that you say they
have, then certainly these cubes con-
tain the secret of some kind of ultra-
sonic weapon. And that would be ex-
actly what we need to finish the
Asians. There'd be no defense against
ultrasonics. Specific vibration could
destroy any defense. Our scientists
have been working on ultrasonics,
looking for a way to utilize sound
waves as a weapon, for a long time.
They haven’t gotten anyplace. Why is
that, Burkeson?”

BURKESON felt nauseous weak-
ness. He leaned against the desk.
He put out a hand and touched the
cube, and suddenly a strange thrilling
strength seemed to flow through him.

  He said. “The difficulty is in nar-
rowing the destructive vibration
waves down to concentrative focus.
Waves have a tendency to spread. If
a way could be found to funnel the
sound waves into concentrative focus,
anything could be shaken to pieces,
completely destroyed, by finding spe-
cific vibratory rates.”

  Clevenger said. “And these cubes
should have that secret shouldn't
they?”

  “I don't—know,” whispered Burke-
son.

  “Then,” Clevenger said, *1 think
you'd better start looking into the
cubes and finding out. The secret of
one of these cubes might very well
give us the drop on the Asians, enable
us to destroy them all, and all their
works. I'm afraid the NADF will hear
of your uncooperative attitudes,
Burkeson, unless you show a great
deal of change."

  Clevenger said to Ballance. “I'd
suggest that you put Burkeson in
charge, with Ferrell and Hopkins to
assist, at once. We’ll take several of
the cubes back to the ship and tear
them down. If the job seems too diffi-
cult, and looks like it might take too
long, we’ll take a cube or two with
50

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

us back to Earth. Whatever there is
to learn is in the cubes anyway.”

  Burkeson was dismissed. Ferrell
was sent to the ship after a small
power car to mantle and bring back
to the city for hauling cubes. Burke-
son went outside into the cool shaded
street. And he sat down beside a cube
to wait. He sat in the shade cast by
the cube, and buried his face in his
arms.

  Reality seemed slowly to fade. It
became as though he were swimming
in an endless sea of glorious sound,
and that he was Orpheus, or the angel
Israfel.

  He had felt without knowing how.
Now he knew. Their music was lan-
guage, and he understood its broadest
semantic meanings. He had always
thought that if man would find a uni-
versal language, it would be in the
realm of basic, vibratory harmonies
that even in their crudest form had
such profound and deep effects on
the senses.

  Chance didn’t move Beethoven to
select the key of E flat for the Heroic
Symphony, Burkeson thought, and
that of F for the Pastoral. It was in
obedience to that mysterious law
which assigns to each key a peculiar
aspect, a special color.

  There would be slight variations
according to temperament and condi-
tioned responses, but basically it was
a physical law of general reactions.
A certain vibration must inevitably
have specific effects on physical struc-
ture.

  Wrapped in that surrounding sym-
phony of sound, Burkeson began to
feel that he was in general contact
emotionally with the cubes’ mental
world. Not with any individual cube,
but with the whole interrelated sound
structure of each cube and the city
itself. And it seemed that as a result,
entire emotional messages impihged
on his nervous system, flooded his
brain with understanding. It was a
kind of ultimate method of compre-

hension, of evaluation, that one could
term semantic.

  And they were in touch with him,
and their music was a language that
he felt in great floods of understand-
ing. And they understood his own
anguished outpourings of feeling.

  He felt the resulting horror as they
absorbed his emotions. There was re-
treat, then more absorption, then
shock, then slow horrified comprehen-
sion. Burkeson clutched his head
suddenly, as if invisible hands were
poised to strike. His body began to
shake.

  He staggered to his feet, screaming
with pain and horror as their emo-
tional reaction poured back upon him.
He stood swaying, pressing his tem-
ples with shaking hands, his head
rocking.

  The pain slowly faded. He stood
with his eyes closed. And then he felt
the change begin in the music of the
city. Major chords began to mingle
and seek to establish themselves.

 The doleful anxiety of Ab. The
funereal and mysterious pathos of Bb
crept in, retreated, moved in slowly
to remain. G, sombre. C, brutal, sin-
ister. E, sadness and agitation. C,
gloomy, dramatic, violent. F-^hate,
hate, HATE! C and F. Hate, destruc-
tion, hate, destruction.

  Efa, profound sadness of realization.

  Then, C and F. Hate, hate, hate.
Destruction.

 KILL. KILL.

 Burkeson yelled hoarsely. He
turned and lurched back through the
arched doorway; he screamed at
Clevenger. He screamed at Ballance.

THEY straightened up quickly, and
Clevenger licked his lips slowly
as he saw Burkeson’s twisted face.
Burkeson started babbling. He
screamed at them, insults and threats,
but he wasn’t making much sense,
Clevenger thought. Ballance looked
meaningfully toward the two guards

WAR OF THE MARSH-MEN

           By W MALCOLM WHITE

EW Chicago had been destroyed over-
night! During the deep Venusian
darkness—which lasted for twenty hours
out of the strange planet’s day of forty—
great flares of crimson rocket trails had
been seen coming from the south. Then,
with terrible roaring and crashing, huge
rockets loaded with high explosives had
blown the small colonial city to pieces. The
few survivors were able to give the direc-
tion the rockets had come from—but that
was all they knew.

  We of the Interplanetary Patrol stationed
on Earth’s polar colonies on that cloudy hot
planet heard of it as soon as we had re*
turned from our latest mission. We had
been far up beyond the stratosphere cruis-
ing slowly over the huge and eternal cloud-
bank that covers the second planet. We
were looking for a missing pleasure-plane,
said to have been piloted by Verna Jenson,
daughter of Governor-General Jenson of
Earth’s colonies.

  Verna had left the day before to fly
across the equatorial clouds to the South
Pc le Station But she had never arrived. No
word had been heard from her—hut that
was not surprising, for radio waves do not
easily penetrate the electric static of the
Venusian atmosphere.

  We eased our little cruiser into port at
North Pole Base. When we got off, hoping
to have a rest, it was our Captain Birch
who came running back to us with the
news of the New Chicago disaster.

  "But who was it?” "Where did the
bombs come from?” "Why?” the members
of our small crew asked. But he did not
knoV'. Nobody knew. We were ordered to
take off at once. All the sky-cruisers of the
command stationed there were out, looking
for the unknown enemy.

  We hastily piled into our rocket ship
and again headed upwards over the clouds.
We would go south, towards the unknown
equatorial region, looking for the bomb-
senders.

  Venus is a planet of mystery. Covered
eternally with thick clouds. There are huge
sections of it that are utterly unknown.
Explorers can safely travel only on its ex-
treme northern and southern polar parts.
Because Venus is millions of miles closer

to the sun than the Earth, its middle re-
gions are far too hot and super-tropical. No
one can survive there for long. Even the
parts we live on, the polar regions where
New Chicago was situated, were like Deep-
est Africa on Earth. Yet they were con-
sidered "cool”!

  What strange beings may inhabit the
equator of Venus no one knew. On our
parts there were no natives, though there
were unusual animals in plenty. So we had
no idea of what we were looking for. It
was the opinion of us all that Venusians
did exist and evidently they were starting
now to destroy all Earth’s people on their
world.

  Our cruiser raced south over the- huge
sea of mist, our super-radar operating stead-
ily to show us what lay beneath the clouds.
Radar could show us some things—it
ihowed where land and rivers were, and
where the boiling oceans. But as you got
nearer the equator, land and water seemed
to merge and a vast belt of hot swamp-
land was believed to exist there. In that
mystery terrain, the radar could not dis-
tinguish details.

  Captain Birch was watching the radar
in the control room and shaking his head.
It had been the same in our search for
Verna Jenson’s ship yesterday—the farther
south you got, the less you could see. Now
we were over the vast marshes and our
instruments showed only an uninterrupted
flatness beneath the clouds.

  Then suddenly our alarm bells went
off. Captain Birch jumped to the window.
A huge robot-rocket was heading up out
of the clouds towards us! Birch shouted
an order. The man at the controls jammed
over the rocket levers and the ship jumped
wildly to one side. We held our breath—
and the mystery rocket grazed past us,
missing us by a matter of inches!

  Lieutenant Williams, at the rear gun,
managed to get his weapon working. A
steady stream of atomic bullets flew from
the muzzle of his wicked looking weapon.
I saw them hit the strange black painted
rocket, and explode. I was thrown from my
feet by the terrible shock that followed.

  We had hit the enemy rocket and it had
exploded, but it had been too close to us
when it went off. We were falling, out of
control, falling into the clouds, into the
marshes below!

  Captain Birch struggled to straighten the
ship. He fought with the controls as the
ship whirled and tossed in the air currents.
Still we fell. Down, down, through the
grey clouds, and then, at last we steadied,
rode down to the surface below, came to
a halt in the swampy marshes of unknown
Venus.

 The ship was somewhat damaged, it
could be repaired fast though . . . and
Birch ordered the men at it. Meanwhile we
would have to wait there for a little while.
Birch, Williams, and I opened the side
port and looked out.

 The ship was floating in a mass of
muddy, marshy stuff, pools of dirty oily
water, covered with green and yellow
growing things. Great bubbles of blackish
muck kept boiling up about us. Here and
there hummocks of mossy land stood out.
Great ugly looking trees stuck up in odd
places. It was truly a dismal sight.

  "Look!” cried Williams excitedly and
pointed into the distance. Our eyes fol-
lowed and we saw a huge six-legged mon-
ster leaping through the swamp towards
us. "There’s someone riding it!” shouted
Birch.

  Sure enough, perched on the ugly crea-
ture’s back was a slim, lightly clad figure.
We strained our eyes as the animal dashed
on in our direction. "It’s Verna!” shouted
Williams.

  We recognized the figure of the Gover-
nor-General’s daughter. Evidently she was
trying to reach our ship and now we
could see why—she was being pursued!

  Running after her, coming with great
jumps and leaps through the marsh, some-
times in the water, sometimes leaping from
hummock to hummock, were men—huge
greenish monster-men, ten, twelve feet tall,
horrible marshmen, the mystery inhabi-
tants of the planet.

  Verna’s weird animal seemed winning,
when one of the marshmen stopped, aimed
an odd pistol-shaped weapon at it and
fired. A burst of black smoke, and the
animal jumped, gave a hideous scream and
fell, almost at our ship’s door. Verna
scrambled off its back and we reached for
her, hauled her up into the ship’s en-
tranceway.

  The marshmen were right on her tracks
One leaped, went deep into the water and

managed to get a hold on her leg. Birch
shot him. Others were coming from all
directions. The ship rocket and I shot a
glance overhead. One marshman, horrible
and slimy green, had come up on us from
behind and was climbing over the ship.

  We rushed inside, slammed the steel door
just in time. Verna collapsed into a ham-
mock. Birch ran to the controls. Fortu-
nately the repairs had been mostly made,
an emergency system had been rigged up,
and we were able to take off before the
marshmen now swarming about could do
any damage.

  Up we shot into the steamy air above
the swamp. We dropped a bomb and had
the satisfaction of finishing off those fiends
who had been surrounding the spot we
had left.

  Verna recovered her strength enough to
rake her place beside Birch. "There, go
that way," she pointed a direction to us
and our ship followed her finger. There
was the city of the monsters.

  It rose from the swamps just a little be-
yond the spot we had been forced down.
It was a low sprawling city of ugly mush-
room-shaped houses, hidden in the marshes.
We could see several ugly rocket-launching
racks just outside it and many huge black
cylinders waiting to be fired at the rest of
our cities.

  Verna told us she had come down in the
marshes for a slight repair when her little
pleasure ship had trouble the day before.
She had come down by accident on the hid-
den city of the marshmen and they had
made her prisoner. They had long been
planning to attack us and now they de-
cided to attack at once. That very night
the dreadful rockets had gone out that had
destroyed New Chicago.

  Verna had taken advantage of their con-
fusion when our shots blew up the rocket
bomb they had last launched. She had
seized one of their domesticated animals—
the monster we had seen her riding—and
had ridden away towards where she had
heard our rocketship descending.

  "The marshmen could have destroyed
us all, colony by colony, and we would
never have been able to hit back,” Verna
said to us. But that was no longer to be,
for I heard Birch now on the radio-beam,
sending back to the North Pole Base the
directions that would enable our huge bat-
tleships of space to blast the marshmen out
of existence forever-

What was he—degenerate
or supermant

           Although other explorers had found Venus cold,
           forbidding, and lifeless, this adventurer found it a
           world of marvelous delight. What strange alchemy
           had transformed it on that one Earthling's behalf?

      By JOHN & DOROTHY de COURCY

IS ONLY an alien who can
really enjoy the exotic, but
the alien who has no con-
nection with the scene,
who has not even the
vaguest idea what will
come next, he truly experi-
ences an unusual and wonderful thing
for he smells strange smells, touches
strange textures, hears strange sounds
and the very air he breathes is some-
how different. And so it was with me,
lying on the ground, unfamiliar
ground with an odd, soft feel, pow-
dery to the touch yet not clinging as
earth dust would. Suddenly remem-
bering where I was, I sat up and
looked about me.

  When I had left the earth, I hadn't

known where to go first as there were
so many places to visit, so many ex-
citing and unusual sights to see and
an infinite variety to choose from; but
I had finally selected Venus, partly
because it would be a short hop but
mostly because exploration had re-
vealed so little about it. Those who
had gone there had found only a
waterless dust bowl with unending
dust storms which made any exten-
sive investigation next to impossible.

  Yesterday, very tired and in need
of sleep, I had landed and had climbed
out of my ship to find not a dust
storm but a curious crowd watching
me. I stood there dumbly, wondering
what to do, until one who seemed to
have authority took me with him into

83
84

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

their city. He seemed to know I was
tired for he left me in a compartment
barren of furniture yet seemingly
possessed with all the comforts. As-
suredly I had slept well for this soft,
springy ground had been my bed.

  As I gazed about me, I wondered if
it had been wise to leave my ship, but
so strange and foreign were my sur-
roundings, I soon forgot about it. I
walked through an archway which
led outside and discovered that most
of the dwellings about me were much
the same. There were neither doors
nor windows and there seemed to be
no streets. The houses could have
been made of earth for the walls were
the same color as the ground and
they were round, hexagonal and oc-
tagonal, generally.

  Beyond the houses in what ap-
peared to be approximately the city’s
center rose towers, high into the air.
They seemed somewhat triangular to
me and tended to come to a point al-
though the distance made seeing diffi-
cult. Then I heard the bell as its
sound rolled out across the city in a
great, ringing crash. I jumped and
looked in the direction of the towers.
Again that strange, rumbling clang
struck me like a physical blow. As
yet I saw not a soul in the spaces
between the domiciles and I thought
it incredible that anyone could sleep
through such a racket.

  For the final time, the voice in that
mighty bell rolled out, leaving a preg-
nant silence in its wake, a silence that
must soon give birth to new sounds
or it would surely burst asunder from
its own electric tension. I stood there
waiting, for what I did not know,
avidly drinking in each detail of a
new world. At that moment, my host
appeared.

PERHAPS it was the light of
morning or perhaps it was be-
cause I had drunk of the refreshing
cup of sleep but he seemed less form-
less and more concrete than when I

had last seen him. Actually, he could
have been a man, a rather large man
and not the least bit freakish. Hie
features were classic and his nose
was long enough to be distinguished
yet not so much as to be ridiculous.
His hair was pale and golden tinted
and his eyes were a bright blue. The
mark that would set him apart from
earth men was his skin, for it too
was blue.

  “Was he barbarian?” I wondered,
“or was his a philosophy too deep for
my mind to grasp.” His feet were
bare, yet what n«ed for shoes on such
resilient soil? He wore a short skirt
which for its color could have been
woven silver, yet by its weight and
flexibility must be cloth or perhaps
some plastic which we did not have.
There was no belt nor did he wear
adornments. Indeed, his smooth skin
with long powerful muscles flexing
beneath it had no need of ornamenta-
tion.

 He smiled then just as anyone
would smile. He had teeth, seemingly
like mine but more even and white,
perhaps because of the contrast of his
skin. He asked me a question in his
deep voice, making motions with his
flexible hands.

  I did not understand.

  He pointed to his mouth and made
chewing motions.

 This was clear and I nodded my
head. “I eat,” I said, then went
through the motions of lifting a fork
full of food to my mouth and masti-
cating it.

  He repeated the word. “Eat.”

 I moved my jaws and nodded my
head.

  “I,” he repeated flatly.

  I pointed a finger at myself and
said, “I,”

  He pointed his forefinger at me and
said, “I.”

  This time I shook my head violently
and grasping his firm hand, turned it
around so that he too pointed to him-
self. :
ALCHEMY

  He smiled again, pointed to him-
self and said, “bo—I.”

  I pointed to myself then and said
questioningly, “bo?”

  Gravely he nodded.

  We surmounted the “you” problem
in a moment. “You” appeared to be
“ti.”

  My host, believing, that he had
enough fundamentals said, “I eat, you
eat,” and then nodded his head.

  It was a rather rudimentary thing
but it gave me food for thought while
my tall host led me toward food for
the body. We went into the house
again through a different archway and
there I found what appeared to be a
board or piece of plastic about three
feet square on which rested little
pyramids of assorted food stuffs. My
friend seated himself or more ac-
curately, contorted himself, for he
folded his legs into the manner of a
statue of Buddha. This I tried and
found I could still do since at one
time I had practiced yoga for my
health.

  The food was certainly unique but
tasty. Not one familiar flavor was
represented although there was salt
in a small pyramid in the center of
the table. There was a pile of small,
green things which resembled rad-
ishes but which tasted vaguely like
cooked potatoes with a dash of pars-
nip added. There were many other
curious things but I cannot describe
them for there is nothing to compare
them with. All of them seemed to be
vegetables except the beverage. This
was served in small opalescent cups
slightly smaller than our own cups
and about the shape of a flower pot.
I should say, was already there, since
no one appeared to add food or take
any away.

  The liquid was sweet but had body
in the manner of coffee. It was quite
clear and had a distinct blue color.
My friend named each item of food
as he picked it up and I endeavored
to remember them.

  Again I asked myself the question,
“Are they barbarians or have they
passed beyond civilization?” When
all things needful are present, it
could indicate either the idyllic ex-
istence of a tropical island or the cul-
mination of millennia of progress.

WHEN the meal was finished, we
arose and I stretched my rather
cramped legs. My host made a circu-
lar motion toward the outside, smil-
ing broadly. I nodded and followed,
my legs still aching a bit. When we
were outside, I thought of my ship
and how maybe I should go back but
then I reasoned that I came here to
see the planet and not the ship. Cer-
tainly there had been no sign of hos-
tility so far and I felt somehow that
my rather battered craft would be
left alone.

  The light on Venus is peculiar.
There seems to be something in the
air which screens off most of the
sunlight, yet the day seemed as bright
as on earth when it is slightly over-
cast. I saw no shadows for light
seemed to be everywhere and then I
remembered that I had not seen any
artificial lighting of any kind in the
house. I looked back through the
archway we had just come through
and saw that it was just as light in-
side as it was outside, that same pe-
culiar bluish light which seemed to
be everywhere yet came from no-
where.

 The air was warm. The tempera-
ture appeared to be unvarying as I
remembered that the same warmth
had persisted throughout the night.
I wondered about these things and
wished desperately there were some
way I could ask questions.

  My friend waited patiently for me
whenever I stopped to look about.
We walked between innumerable
houses, all doorless. A number of
people were outside and I discovered
they were actually a beautiful people.
They were all blue although the
86

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

shade varied from a rather pale tint
to a pronounced purple 'hue. The
women were generally paler and were
clad the same as the men. The colors
of the short skirts varied through
the spectrum including colors that
we cannot as yet impress upon fab-
rics. Some noticed us, some called
greetings to my friend and some gave
us only a passing glance.

  We walked for a long time, several
hours, always in the general direction
of the towers. As we approached
them, I could see that there were
four of them spaced about a hundred
feet apart in a diamond shape. They
rose approximately six hundred feet
although I could be far wrong.

 My host allowed me to wander
around the base of the first tower and
scrutinize it. I thought at first it was
made of copper or a rose gold yet
when I touched it, it was not cold
like metal but rather neutral like a
plastic. There was an open archway
on the side facing the inward part
of the diamond and I could make out
another on the farthest tower.

  Again I had that intense desire to
ask questions, to make myself under-
stood. But how could I? Even if this
man could guess my questions, how
could he answer me so that I would
understand? Wondering, I looked at
my friend and he smiled. I studied
him for a moment, trying to decide
what lay behind that smile. Was it one
of understanding or just an automatic
response to what he thought ridicu-
lous? I couldn't tell.

  The smile faded gradually from his
face as he stared back at me. Then
he smiled again and said, “I eat/’

  I hadn’t noticed but I too was hun-
gry. It had been a long walk. I nodded
and he began walking toward the
nearest of the houses. I walked along
beside him, trying to keep in step
but it was almost impossible to
match those long, effortless strides.
We went through an archway and
found a woman within. Before her

was a triangular board, a little larger
than the one we had dined from in
the morning. She smiled at me re-
assuringly and behaved in every way
as though she had fully expected both
of us.

  I wondered how this could be, for
my friend had spoken to no one m
this vicinity and again the thought
occurred. “Primitive or beyond under*
standing?”

  The food was totally different from
what I had eaten earlier except for
the beverage. My friend chatted with
our hostess, smiling occasionally and
using gestures which could have
meant most anything. When the meal
was over, I smiled at the woman, try-
ing to convey the impression that I
had enjoyed the meal. Perhaps it was
wishful thinking on my part but she
seemed to understand.

MY FRIEND rose gracefully and
walked to the archway. I at-
tempted to do the same but my legs
were so stiff and sore from the long
walk and the cramped sitting posi-
tion that when I tried to straighten
up, I fell. So surprised was I at the
incredible softness and rubberlike
quality of the ground that I just lay
there for a moment. Then realizing
that I wasn’t the least bit hurt, I
pulled myself into a sitting position
and when I thought of my clumsiness,
I laughed. Once started, I couldn’t
stop and the tears rolled down my
face.

 My friend helped me to my feet
and it was then I noticed that he too
was laughing, only it was more like
a heavy rumble which came from his
throat. He bid our hostess goodbye
and we went outside.

  I looked at my friend questioning-
3y. He smiled and pointed to the
towers. I nodded and followed but
this time we walked straight through
Hie archway. Almost immediately I
saw why we were here, for leading
upward around the central well was
ALCHEMY

87

a spiral ramp. It was of a material as
soft and resilient as the ground.

  On an impulse, I sat down and re-
moved my shoes, heavy, cumbersome
things. I tucked my woolen socks in-
side the shoes and stood up and for
the first time I realized that the
ground was warm My tall friend
smiled, a seeming knowing smile, Yes,
it was obvious and had been, that I
needed no shoes here. We started up
the ramp and I found walking much
easier indeed.

  On the wall beside the ramp lay the
purpose of our visit, for painted or
impressed with a startling clarity
were figures, acting out a wordless
drama. I saw the way these people
were in the early beginning, learning
fire, learning to work stone though I
had not seen a stone since my arrival.

  Up the familiar climib toward civil-
ization, we walked. The higher we
ascended, the higher the civilization.
I stopped at each picture, studying
it carefully until there appeared
technology, a strange technology
which certainly no longer existed.
“Why had they slipped back?” I won-
dered. “Why the decline?” And then
I saw an all too familiar thing, war.

  For some reason, I was saddened.
They seemed such a peaceful people.
It was a shame that they had had to
taste of war, death and destruction.
Perhaps they were better off as they
were.

  We walked further and further up-
ward and I began to feel strange
things, vague stirrings in my mind.
At first, I thought it was the effect
of the alien pictures, pictures that
were too clear. But as we ascended,
I found it growing stronger. On and
on we went, passing by the panorama
of life and death, of man rising to
new peaks and falling to new depths
but this time it was man whose skin
was blue.

 And then we came upon another
series depicting war and I started as
I stood before a mushroom-shaped

cloud. So they had even had atomic
energy. It seemed incredible. Some-
thing surged inside of me, a strange
something and I thought perhaps it
was the horror I somehow knew
would be depicted soon, the ghastly
spectacle of suicidal atomic war. Yet
when it came, the feeling inside of
me grew, the surging became intense,
that something which eluded me
seemed almost within my grasp.
Here, pictured with unworldly vivid-
ness, was the end of a world.

  Yet I found it was not the end, for
many had survived and they began
rebuilding. Gradually, the shape of
the thing they were building became
plain. It was the towers or a group
like them, rising up into the heavens.
Here again was advancement. So the
end had not come in the hell of
atomic war. But where then? Where
had all of this knowledge gone?

  Onward and upward we walked and
now I saw space craft. They had
traversed the depths of space, even
to our earth. They had built cities
everywhere, had become a great and
mighty people. I marveled that so
much had been gained and was so
obviously lost But was it lost? It
seemed to be. I had seen nothing that
would indicate otherwise.

 Then came a series of pictures
which puzzled me for they showed
the blue-skinned people leaving their
great cities, reentering their space
ships and returning to their home
planet. There seemed to be no reason
for this exodus and I pondered each
picture for some time. The more I
thought, the more sure I became that
somewhere locked in my mind was
the answer to the puzzle. It was as
though I were trying to remember
something, something logic told me
I could not possibly know and yet it
was there, just on the rim of con-
sciousness.

  And then we came to the last pic-
ture. I felt as though I had been
shocked electrically. I know the
88

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

blood drained from my face as I
stared, unbelieving. How could it be?
Yet there it was, the final picture,
showing my friend standing just as
he was standing and myself just as I
was, even barefoot. How could they
have known? It was a perfect mirror
image in miniature. I moved a little
but the picture of me did not. It was
not a reflection. I continued to stare,
fascinated, and slowly I realized that
the picture was a familiar one to me.
I had seen it before but where? I
groped, sought frantically within my
mind for the explanation but it con-
tinually escaped me, remaining just
beyond my reach.

DAZED, I turned to my friend but
he only smiled. It was a smile
with the quality of all knowing wise-1
ness and suddenly, he too seemed
familiar to me, someone I had known
for a long time. He motioned me to
go onward through an archway but
I couldn’t move. I felt as though I
were half in and half out of my body.

  Gently but firmly, my friend took
my arm and guided me to the arch-
way. I paused on the threshold, fear
beginning to clutch at me, but my
friend urged me on. We entered to
face an aging man whose skin was
quite light though still blue. He mo-
tioned me to sit as he was, cross-
legged, and I did, hardly knowing
what I was doing and only vaguely
conscious that my friend had done
likewise. Then the old man reached
out, touched my forehead just above
my nose and I fainted.

  When I opened my eyes, I felt that
time had passed but there was no way
of knowing. My friend held me up-
right, my head resting against his
massive shoulders. Within myself I
felt peace, a quietness I had never
known and then all at once I realized
I knew. I lifted my head and looked
at the aged one who sat unmoving.
Yes, I knew! I understood these
people!

  “Are you feeling better now?” the
aged man asked.

  It was an alien language yet some-
how I understood. I knew many other
things, I felt many other things, but
all I could express was, “yes—yes—
I’m much better now.”

  Now I knew that here was perfec-
tion, that theirs was not a civilization
of the body but one of the soul, and
that somehow I was a part of them
and they were a part of me.

  “Yes,” the old man said aloud. “You
are one of us. You always have been.
If you were not—” He broke off but
I understood. I was a descendant of
those early pioneers who had come
to earth. This I knew. If it were not
so, I would have found nothing when
I landed for where I was now was in,
and yet not in the world, a place apart
and not visible to ordinary eyes.

  I looked into the eyes of the man
beside me and knew I would never
leave, would never want to leave. This
was my home, my real home and these
were my people, my people because
of a bond more powerful and ever-
lasting than one of flesh and blood
for I was one with myself, a truly
integrated being, and therefore one
with all men who were as I.

  Unbidden, I stepped through an-
other archway and found what I knew
would be there, a short skirt such as
all the people wore. I removed my
clothes quickly and drew on the little
garment, then turning, I looked into
the polished oval of metal, finer than
the finest mirror. Already my skin
was bluish and, smiling, I ran my
fingers through my hair, fluffing it.

  I prepared to leave then hesitated
a moment. I knew that waiting for
me was the man with whom I would
be forever, forever his as he would
be forever mine and yet I had one
tiny regret, a regret which quickly
changed into humor. When I finally
emerged from the little room, I was
laughing. I hadn’t 'brought my lip-
stick..

great deal of glory connected with
this first planet-landing in over £
century.

  The Executive Chief stood at the
gunwales of the gravity boat, just be-

was metallic. Each overtone in it re-

Ren worked the controls automati-

thing today—an emotion—a prescient
feeling without any logic or two-and-
two in it, and he had been feeling this
in his marrow ever since descending
to the surface of this new and un-
known planet.

  And, now, for some reason—part of
this queer emotion probably—he
turned to glance at Jana, who sat
along the gunwales with tht other

At that moment, a dc^en

scientists and with the men of the
Protec Guard. She saw him, and
smiled at him. He smiled back, and
felt a little better.

  Challon’s metallic voice cut in. "All
right, mister, let’s pay attention to
the controls.”

  Ren obeyed, but he felt a surge of
something—it seemed to start just be-
low his lungs and come up through the
sihell of his body. Another new emo-
tion. He kept his stare on the control
panel and threw his squarish brows

into a deep scowl. This was anger} he
felt. Anger was a primitive trait, and
forbidden—but it seemed to come so
easily on this world.

  The gravity car passed over a den-
sity fault and bumped. Ren corrected;
he kept the long, boatlike vehicle
skimming, following the contour of
Ismarus.

  Ismarus. They’d named it after
Ulysses’ first port of call—and they'd
been lucky, all right, to find it. The
scanners had picked it out of space
after analyzing only a few thousand
others. It met all the requirements:
it was of the. same mass as Earth, it
had an atmosphere, Earth’s tempera-
ture, one satellite and a similar ro-
tation and orbit period. It was a jack-
pot find, no question of it. Now the
Alpha had landed upon this planet,
92

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

and they had /taken the gravity boat
to explore in a wide radius from the
big spaceship. There would be long
days and nights of waiting while the
Alpha was re-massed—they would get
to know Ismarus better. Maybe too
well before it was all over.

  Ren glanced occasionally at the
iandscape all about them. He had
difficulty in seeing it as a pure sight
—his mind kept wandering into rea-
son and analysis. The people of the
Alpha, after all, were conditioned to
analyze and reason from birth; in this
they were probably superior even to
the revered Ancestors who had
launched the Alpha. Ren concentrated
so that he wouldn’t have to think so
hard.

  A queer place, Ismarus. In some
ways similar to the minifilm reader
pictures of Earth that every Alphan
child studied—but in other ways sub-
tly different. Very little vegetation
for one thing. Mostly rolling stretches
of hard-packed red and ochre sand,
lacerated here and there with rock.
Sharp rock, grey rock. The rocks be-
came more frequent as they neared
the mountain chain. Tortured, cac-
tuslike plants began to appear.

  “Spectro, please, Captain,” pinged
Challon’s voice. He was still behind
Ren’s shoulder.

  Ren ticked the scanner. The screen
glowed with white light, then flashed
and jiggled before it came to life.
Bands of color appeared and floated
until Ren stilled them by dialing.

  Challon leaned forward and studied
the image.

  Ren looked at Challoo’s profile.
Strong, handsome, confident face—as
befitted an Executive Chief. Immense
1. Q., superb physique and very low
Emotional Index. Naturally. No other
kind of man could hold the com-
munity together as the Alpha took
its warping path through the universe.
Science was the Supreme Being and
Challon was Its prophet. These days
you could hardly whisper “E equals

me square” without a slight feeling of
having committed blasphemy.

  Challon was reading the spectro off
the cuff. “Soil relatively fertile on
the slopes ahead. Some vegetation.
Might be inhabitants there.”

JANA rose and came forward. Ren
smiled to himself; he knew she
couldn’t sit still when she heard the
word inhabitants. Vitology, the study
of life on other planets, was her spe-
cialty, and in fact that was why she
had been brought along on this first
exploration trip. She came to Chal-
lon’s side, looked at the screen, too,
and said, “What about water? Are
there deposits, or is it underground?
That makes a difference in the form
life takes sometimes.”

  “Deposits, I dare say,” said Challon.
He looked at Jana flatly. “After all,
the atmosphere contains moisture.”
Ren glanced at Challon quickly.
There had been irritation in his an-
swer—but Challon, of all people, was
supposed to be the supreme intellect
who never became irritated, who had
practically no inconvenient emotions.
Was there something in the air of
this planet which was giving even
Challon primitive tendencies?

 And Jana—Ren saw sudden color
in her cheeks. He saw a faint tighten-
ing of her upper lip and a quick
movement of her grey eyes as she
returned Challon’s flat stare. Well,
one thing, she was even more beauti-
ful with her irritation showing like
this. Gave life to her face. At times
her ordinarily calm, cool mask had
made him uncomfortable—reminded
him that after all she was a privileged
scientist and he was only a Captain
of the Protecs.

  He looked at the instrument panel
again—at first in a routine, unsuspect-
ing way. Then abruptly his instinct
told him that the instruments weren’t
behaving correctly.

  He raised his brows. He swept his
gaze horizontally, studying every-
CELESTIAL LANDFALL

93

thing. The speedometer was wavering,
although the car certainly moved
along at a steady pace. The mass in-
dicator had dropped. And the spectro
showed bright flashes.

  Ren stared at the landscape again.
He wasn’t sure, but there did seem
to be a faint concavity to the land
here—as though there had once been
a crater perhaps a mile in diameter.
He raised himself in the seat to stare
some more—And the gravity boat
stopped with a sudden and quite un-
usual jolt.

  “Here! What’s this?” said Challon,
whirling toward Ren. The car’s pas-
sengers stirred and began to mutter
to each other.

  "Don't know,” said Ren. He exam-
ined the control panel again. "Can’t
figure it out.” He took the fiat mini-
film reader from his tunic pocket and
opened it quickly. He pressed the but-
ton and watched the moving images
flash by on the lens. The film in the
reader was a tech manual for the op-
eration of the vehicle, but, as he had
supposed, it told him nothing. The
standard atom symbol flashed at the
end of the film, and he was still no-
where.

  Lokar, the big, tawny-haired Protec
sergeant hauled his bulk forward and
touched Ren’s arm. “Sir, maybe we’d
better get the hell out of here. I don’t
like this spot. I don’t like the feeling
in my bones.”

  “We’ll decide that in a minute, Ser-
geant,” Ren said in a formal tone. The
formality was for the benefit of Chal-
lon’s ears. Meanwhile, Ren flicked a
significant glance at Challon and
Lokar understood. The sergeant went
back to his seat.

  Suddenly Jana’s voice cried out
sharply, I saw somethingV*

 “What? What’s that?” Challon
turned toward her.

  She was standing, pointing. She
was pointing at the face of a large
jagged rock ahead—an outcropping
the size of a cottage. “Something

over there—an animal—or a person.
Pm sure of it!”

  Ren stared in that direction. He
didn’t see anything, just the grey rock
and the yellow-red sand rising toward
it. It struck him then that in this
circular area there was no vegetation,
not even the twisted bushes or the
cactuslike plants.

  “It couldn’t, by any chance,” Chal-
lon said frigidly to Jana, “have been
a slight hallucination?”

  She shook her head quickly. “It was
an animal. Or a person.”

REN frowned to himself. An animal
or a person. He felt a queer, puls-
ing thrill. In his lifetime he had
never known a living thing outside of
the people aboard the spaceship, Al-
pha. Nor had the others of his gen-
eration. The need for a re-massing
stop came about once a century, and
it had been over a hundred centuries
since the Alpha left the legendary
place they all knew as Earth.

  The Alpha*s saga was, of course,
one of the first things children learned
when they became old enough to sit
in the hypno bays or operate their
own minifilm readers. And always the
importance of their destiny as AI-
phans was hammered into them. Their
entire culture was built around the
idea that eventually there would be
a Day of Arrival—the Alpha would
return to Earth.

  Later, when they began to study
relativity, they could understand how
it was that the Day of Arrival would
come not centuries after the depar-
ture—but within a few score years.
Earth years, at any rate. Aboard the
Alpha generations would experience
the passage of centuries, or seem to.
But since the Alpha was traversing
the entire curve of space it would
reach its starting point both in space
and time. The only period of time
difference would be a few score years
required for acceleration and deceler-
ation. Thus—it was the hope of those
94

, OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

who launched the Alpha that it would
return in their own lifetimes and en-
able them to meet their own many-
times-great-grandchildren.

  But the calculations were very in-
volved. The best thinkers among the
Ancestors differed in their predic-
tions of the Arrival date. Some by
many years, some by several or even
a dozen centuries.

  At any rate, Ren's world had always
been the corridors, cubicles and rec-
reation spaces of the mile-long space-
ship. The only other living things he
had ever known were those aboard it.
He knew that it was emotional—prim-
itive—for him to be excited like this,
but he didn’t care. Strange, ever since
setting foot on Ismarus he hadn’t
been particularly ashamed of any of
his emotions.

  “Force screen, Captain!” caime Chal-
lon’s pinging voice, snapping him out
of it.

  Ren punched the button that would
throw protective force around the
gravity boat. He expected the red in-
dicator to glow, but it didn’t. And
Challon was losing some of his cold
metal calm. “Don’t tell me that doesn’t
work, either!” he said. Definite anger
in his voice.

  Ren looked up and said, “Have you
noticed we’re in some sort of an old
crater here? Do you suppose that has
anything to do with it?”

  “Suppose,” said Challon, “we ex-
amine the facts first, and then draw
our conclusions.” He said it quite
icily.

  Ren shrugged. He had an enjoyable,
momentary dream. He pictured him-
self punching Challon’s handsome
face, and savored the idea. Then he
looked up again, toward the rock
and the small rise that skirted away
from it. He saw at least thirty human
figures come over the crest of the rise
and stand silhouetted against the yel-
low sky.

  “Prepare to repel attack, Captain!”
snapped Challon.

  The others stirred, buzzed, pointed,
drew sharp breaths.

  “Battle stations!” Ren called over
his shoulder.

 He heard the Protec guardsmen
shuffle about and take their places.
Jana moved to the bow of the gravity
boat, and pointed to the photoscope.
“Let’s have a close look at them.”

  Ren nodded, switched the gadget
on. He was pleasantly surprised to
find that it worked—it was one of the
few purely electronic devices in the
boat. He began to adjust focus, eleva-
tion and azimuth. An image of one of
the human figures appeared, became
sharp.

  “Definitely humanoid,” said Jana
softly. She was squinting at the im-
age ; she was in deepest concentration.
Ren saw her again—despite her good
looks and youthful features—as the
scientist; the gal with the head full
of serious thoughts, and no nonsense
about it.

 The Ismarian in the photoscope
screen was naked except for the grey-
furred skin of some animal wrapped
clumsily about his waist. His skin
was white in the Caucasian sense,
but deeply tanned by sun and weather.
He had matted brown hair across
his chest and shoulders, and a thick,
unkempt beard. His mouth was part-
ly open, as he stared at the gravity
boat, and Ren saw that his teeth were
yellow, broken, and mottled, although
not especially large. He carried a
metal-tipped spear in one hand, and
a club of stone lashed to a wooden
haft hung from a thong at ihis waist.

  “It’s—it’s incredible,” Jana said,
staring at the image.

  “What’s incredible?” asked Chal-
lon. He was moving about a bit nerv-
ously, as though undecided about the
next thing to do.

  Jana nodded at the screen. “They’re
not only humanoid, but their culture
is that of primitive Earthmen. The
law of averages would certainly in-
dicate some differences—*
CELESTIAL LANDFALL

95

  Challon spoke a little wearily*
“Jana, our science has achieved its
present state by one very basic atti-
tude—taking nothing for granted.
How do we know the law of averages
is valid in this particular place? And
further, to the scientific viewpoint,
nothing is incredible. You know that.*
Jana tossed a quick, sharp look at
the Executive Chief, but didn't an-
swer. Ren knew how sihe felt—there
was just no point to answering a man
like that. The fatuous dummy. For all
his I. Q.: the fatuous dummy.

THE RANK of Ismarians came to
a ragged halt. They were perhap©
seventy-five yards away now. They
began to gesture and parley among
themselves; Ren could hear -die sound
of their voices, but could make out no
words.

  “We’d better blast one just to let
them know what we can do,” said
Challcn.

 Ren started to nod, *and then
brought his head up. He gaped at
Challon. The man had given his order
so casually that its meaning hadn’t
struck Ren immediately. Ren said,
“Look, they haven’t tried to harm us
yet, what’s the use of blasting them?”
Challon’s eyes were very hard as he
turned them upon Ren. “Captain, I
didn’t say to blast them, I said to
blast one. Perhaps it’s unfortunate
we have to do that, but it’s the wisest
move at present. One sub-human life
isn’t going to make much difference
in the outcome of this thing.”

  “But, even so, if—”

  “I’m in command here, Captain.*
Ren shut his mouth hard. He didn’t
Bay anything.

  Challon kept the hard stare upon
him. “You’ll order one of your men
to blast the nearest Ismarian, now,
Captain.”

Ren said, "I'll be damned if I will."
Challon’s finely drawn eyebrows
rose. “Oh?" He put his thumbs into
the golden belt that marked his rank.

His tone didn’t become angry. His
face stayed calm, metallic. “All right,
Captain. We’ll see about this later.”
He turned his head. “Sergeant P’
Lokar bumbled forward, “Yes, sir?”
"'Drop that man—the nearest one by
the rock there— with your reactor.”
Lokar glanced at Ren, frowned
heavily, then finally said, ’’'Yes, sir.”
He raised his reactor, which was pis-
tol-shaped except for the slender,
crtjtchlike shoulder support. He
aimed, and he touched the trigger but-
ton.

  Nothing happened.

  “You should take better care of
your weapons,” said Challon.

  Sergeant Lokar had already re-
moved the rear plunger and was star-
ing into the anode-barrel. But—but
there’s nothing wrong with it!” he
said. “It just don’t work, that’s all 2”
"Nonsense,” said Challon. He took
the weapon.

  “Maybe it’s not nonsense,” Ren said
softly. “The reactor’s nuclear, too.
Nothing else nuclear works on the
boat—only the purely electronic
stuff.”

  The sergeant glanced toward the
Ismarians. They were closing their
ranks, now, and some were advancing
cautiously. One with a bow and arrow
was dropping to his knee, and fitting
a shaft to the string. “Captain,” he
said to Ren, “maybe we better get the
blazes out of here.”

  Ren looked at Challon. “How about
it?”

 “We do seem to be temporarily
•defenseless,” said Challon, scowling.
He started to look about—with just
a touch of helplessness in his manner.

  Ren pointed sternward. “We can go
a hundred yards or so and be out o£
this area—whatever it is. The reactors
will probably work, then. If they at-
tack. They might want to be friendly
you know.”

  As Ren spoke, a volley of arrows
came.

  Instinctively everyone ducked be*
96

OUT OF THIS WORID ADVENTURES

hind the metal gunwales of the grav-
ity boat. Some of the arrows rustled
nastily overhead; others struck the
sides of the vehicle with a soft clat-
ter.

  “All right, well run for it,” said
Challon. “You take over for the with-
drawal, Captain.”

REN turned a faint smile upon
Challon, and let him see the con-
tempt in it, and then he called out his
orders. “Scientists first,” he said
coolly. “Guardsmen then deploy in
skirmish order in two ranks by squads.
Ten yards between ranks. Advance in
relays, thirty yards at a time. Zig-zag.
If they pursue, fire as soon as your
weapons operate—rear rank always
firing. Everybody got that ?”

  The Guardsmen nodded or indi-
cated understanding; by silence, and
moved to their places. Sergeant Lokar
hustled the group of civilians to the
stern thwart, and muttered instruc-
tions to them, telling them to run
crouched, and keep a zig-zag course.

  The scientists—five men in civilian
permo-cloth, and Jana in her silver
halter and skirt—scrambled to the
ground. They ran. The first rank of
Guardsmen leaped after them, and
fanned out into a broken line. The
second rank followed, and Ren and
Challon went with it.

  Shouting came from the attackers.
Arrows snapped and fluttered all
around them. Ren turned his head for
a quick look. The skin-clad, muscular,
hairy Ismarians were charging after
them, running with a kind of power-
ful waddle. Some were brandishing
their clubs and spears. Others were
dropping every few seconds to their
knees to discharge arrows again.

  The first rank halted, faced the rear,
and crouched—the second rank kept
its broken course and ran through it.
Another thirty yards. Ahead of the
two ranks Jana and the other scien-
tists continued to run. When the sec-
ond rank came to its halt, Ren turned

with the rest and saw that the Ismar-
ians were gaining upon them. This
was to be expected, since their retreat
consisted of both running and halting
—Ren could only hope they’d make
the edge of the shallow crater in time..
And after that he could only hope the
reactors would begin to work again.

  The fugitives took one more relay.
Ren was in the foremost rank again.
Looking back, he saw that the Ismar-
ians had already reached the stalled
gravity boat—and that they were giv-
ing it a wide berth. They passed it
warily; that slowed them some. Well,
a break there. Ren swiveled his head
to look forward again and saw the
beginnings of tough, wiry grass and
cactus ahead. The edge of the crater,
or whatever it was. Jana, and the five
scientists had already reached that
area, and now they had paused to
wait for the guard. The second rank
came running by; one Guardsman had
an arrow in his upper arm and was
being helped by a comrade. Another
lay toward the gravity boat, lay very
still, and an arrow grew from the
middle of his back.

  Ren rose to run again. He turned.
He looked toward the edge of the
crater, and at that moment a dozen
Ismarians suddenly appeared from be-
hind a fencelike outcropping ahead of
them and ran toward Jana and the
five scientists.

  “Get them! Don’t let them!” shouted
Ren. His hand raised he ran forward.

  He forgot to zig-zag. Maybe that
was it. He felt an abrupt and terrible
blow in his shoulder, and it spun him.
He fell to one hand and knee. He
stared stupidly at his shoulder and
saw the arrow in it—the arrow that
had gone all the way through. He put
his hand on the protruding forepart
of the shaft. He saw that there was
lots of blood.

 Most of all he wondered why it
didn’t hurt. It just felt numb. It had
been painful when it struck, but now
it felt only numb; he shook his head
CELESTIAL LANDFALL

97

and felt a little light-headed and
crazy about the whole thing.

  He started forward again. He saw
the dozen Ismarians who had made the
flanking movement descending on
Jana and the others like a flash flood.
A guardsman reached one of them,
ducked a blow from his club and
swiped him viciously across the cheek
with the stock of his reactor.

  Ren heard footsteps and grunting
behind him. And several shouts. He
spun his head to face it—feeling ter-
ribly dizzy as he did so.

 He saw the blurred shadow of a
club and in the instant before he
found blackness he realized that it
was about to strike his skull. After
that, the blackness. The deepest, black-
est, nothingness he had ever known.

IT WAS night when Ren awoke. He
didn’t realize this at first, of course,
because he awoke very slowly, his
hearing returning first, and the sound
of the wind over the parched plain
coming to his ears. Next he opened
his eyes and when they focused he
saw the stars in front of them. For a
moment he thought he was back in
space; at the port, or in the control
bubble of the Alpha, perhaps.

  But he wasn’t; he was lying on his
back in what seemed to be the same
spot where he had fallen.

  Except for the purr of that breeze
It was very quiet.

  He rose to one elbow. That made
him dizzy. He shook his head, and
felt like retching, and he decided he
would as soon as he got in a position
to. He looked at his shoulder. There
was no more arrow in it, and the blood
around his wound had caked. He
wasn’t bleeding any more.

 Weak, he fell back again and
thought some more.

  He turned his head and saw a brok-
en, stained arrow beside him. It was
broken just behind the head. In the
packed sand by it, which glistened
very coldly in the light of Ismarus’s

moon, he saw a footprint and a larger
depression, as though someone had
knelt beside him. Now he could sup-
pose what had happened. An Ismarian
—'the one who had struck him per-
haps—had removed the arrow and
then left suddenly. Probably called
when the others of the Alpha were
subdued and captured. And after that
they’d evidently forgotten about Ren,
supposed him dead.

  His head began to ache now and he
groaned.

  Well, no use wondering how he’d
been left here—thing to do now was
to move. Recover. Find out about the
others. He lay there for many long
minutes, breathing slowly and deeply,
and then, finally, somehow he man-
aged to move again. He managed to
stagger, squirm and crawl back to the
gravity boat. It took him most of the
night. It was nearly dawn when he
opened the seat lockers to find the
medicines and concentrated food.

  Tthe moon went down. He sat there
in the darkness and munched on
energy biscuit and stared out at the
landscape. The darkness wasn’t ab-
solute—he could still see enough
shapes every once in a while to be
startled. More than anything else he
kept thinking that Jana was some-
where out there, and as soon as he
could move a little better he was going
after her. He was in love with Jana,
in the illogical primitive way the ro-
mances in the minifilm reader depict-
ed; now he knew this, too.

  He ate slowly and thoughtfully. He
stared at the barely discernible shape
of the large rock from behind which
the Ismarians had first come.

  For some reason this feeling of in-
tuition in him was stronger than ever.
The quietness, or his own weakness,
perhaps. At any rate he began to think
about Ismarus and about everything
that had happened. He recalled the
queer surge of emotion he’d known
when the Alpha first landed and he
■oversaw the breaking out of tihe grsv-
98

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

ity boat. He recalled the strong,
primitive things he’d felt—and the
way even Challon had slipped into
anger and sarcasm. He recalled that
first look at an Ismarian in the photo-
scope. He recalled the moon rising
and setting over the planet.

  And the crater here. Nuclear de-
vices wouldn't work in it. Others
would. His minifilm reader, for in-
stance ; that was purely electronic. He
took it from his pocket again, glanced
into it and saw once more the stand-
ard atom symbol which marked the
end of the tech manual. Just to make
doubly sure he tried projecting the
image on the instrument panel—and
that worked, too.

  His frown became a weighted thing.
He held it for a long time. He scarcely
dared believe what a kind of instinct
was telling him about Ismarus.

  He heard movement and the sound
of low Voices by the big rock. He
lifted ihis head quickly. It was too
dark to see who made these noises.
He dropped to one knee, and then
moved carefully forward to the in-
strument panel. The photoscope was
still focused upon the vicinity of the
rock. He switched it on. He worked
the lens angle to take in a wider
amount of area.

  When the image came into being he
saw Ismarians—a score of them per-
haps. They were talking in low. tones
to each other and every once in a
while pointing or staring in the direc-
tion of the gravity boat. And behind
them he saw their captives, bound
neck to neck by a series of crude,
heavy ropes,

THERE was in Ren for a moment
an urge to get out of this place.
To slip over the side of the gravity
boat and run in the opposite direction.
Then he could circle, or wait—or do
something, anyway, to rescue his
friends later. But he recognized this
urge for what it was: plain panic.

  And then his idea came to him,

abrupt and full-blown, out of the
darkness of the night.

  This would work only if his guesses
were right. And, of course, if it didn’t
work, then he’d be quickly and easily
taken by the Ismarians, too. He didn’t
waste time thinking about it too much.
He moved to the starboard rail,
crouched there facing the rock, and
took the minifilm reader from his
pocket.

  He opened the flat, little case and
held it toward the rock. He thumbed
the projection switch.

  A huge atom symbol glowed from
the face of the rock. It was the same
design of nucleus, electrons and their
orbits which had become in effect the
coat of arms for the people of the
Alpha. The thing that inspired an
uncomfortable sort of reverence every
time it appeared. The symbol that
marked all their official seals and such
things as tech manuals—

  The bearded faces of the Ismarians
were visible in the light reflected
from the image on the rock. They
were all turned toward it. Ren could
see the ringed whites of eyes. One
was trembling visibly and slowly
backing away from the thing. Another
was putting his forearm up in front
of his eyes.

  One exceptionally large fellow fell
flat on his face before the symbol and
covered the back of his head with his
hands.

  It was* hard to say just who started
the rout. Maybe several did simultane-
ously. But there was suddenly much
shouting, and in the next instant the
skin-clad men were scattering—run-
ning pell mell away from there in
several directions.

  Ren didn’t smile. His face was
drawn and grave as he clambered
from the gravity boat and headed for
the bound captives.

  Challon’s voice sounded less metal-
lic than it usually did when he said
to Ren, "Well, I don't know how you
did it—but you did it. I guess you’ve
CELESTIAL LANDFALL

99

got a permanent place in the Alphan
annals, now, Captain.” '

  But Ren scarcely heard him. Most
of all he wanted to look into Jana’s
grey eyes. Deeply. He did this as he
unfastened the crude ropes about her.
Yellow dawn was breaking and he
could see her face in its broad, clear
light. He could see by her eyes that
she loved him, too. He spoke, then,
for everyone to hear, but he was really
talking to Jana.

  Ren said, “It wasn’t coincidence at
all that we found Ismarus. It was
pretty much in our warp-curve, after
all. Sometime, somewhere the Alpha
was bound to get to it.”

  “What’s this?” asked Challon, still
able to be just a mite pompous, “what’s
this you’re getting at, now?”

  Ren moved his eyes over the group.
“Have you noticed the way you feel
on this planet? The funny instincts
and emotions you get? The kind of
things even our science can’t quite
figure out?” He saw by their frowns
that they had. “Not only Ismarus, but
its satellite, and the whole solar sys-
tem—even its inhabitants—are like
those of Earth. There are slight dif-
ferences. In mass, and the shapes of
the continents, for instance. These
were the things that threw us off.”
Challon had his finely formed head

cocked to one side. “You mean—this
is Earth? And there’s been some kind
of flaw in time? We came back in a
prehistoric period, like the Chellean

Age?”

  “Not prehistoric,” said Ren. “Post-
historic. There’s been a catastrophe—
maybe to the very men who launched
the Alpha. The crater that interferes
with our nuclear devices by some kind
of radiation is probably a souvenir of
this. I think we’ll find lots of them
all over the planet. Whatever it was,
it shook Earth violently enough to
alter its mass and shape slightly.
Change the course of the rivers and
seas. It must have been very terrible.
And no wonder the savage descend-
ants of the survivors fear the atom
symbol when they see it!”

 They all stared at Ren. Some
blinked, not quite getting it.

 “Now we’re home,” Ren said to
them. “Now we’ve got work to do.
Now we’ve got to start all over again
—and this time we’ve got to find some-
thing—some inner kind of something
—to keep the catastrophe from hap-
pening again.” He turned to Jana. He
took her hands, and pulled her toward
him. She smiled, searching his eyes
and Ren began to see where the be-
ginnings of this inner something
might be.

Alpha Centauri
    Curtain Call

  Pike Pickens had been the greatest T-V star on Earth
  until he took that star trip. Was he now destined
  to put on the finest show of his carer just for an
  exclusive audience of man-eating fiends?

 By LEN 1 MOFFATT

THE history of show
business it will have
to be recorded that
vaudeville died two
deaths. The first
death was caused by
the advent of the
moving picture and
the radio program- The rebirth of
vaudeville was due to the happy union
of television (an ancient term for
video) and die-hard vaudevillians.

  As for the cause of the second death
of vaudeville ... well, there are many
different views on the subject. It is
my own opinion that the so-called
‘‘new” musicoloroma video shows
killed vaudeville—little over three
years ago. People are so easily led into
Eads. I contend that these pseudo-cul-
ture programs of “artistic and intel-
lectual significance” will sicken and
die of their own stench and once again
video fans will howl for “new and
different” escapes. Vaudeville will re-
turn.

  But I'm getting away from my
story. I mentioned that there were
several reasons expounded as to why
vaudeville lost popular favor for the
second time. One of the most popular
—and in my opinion, most erroneous
—theories was that Pike Pickens
killed vaudeville. Now I could sit

right here and say that Pike Pickens
was one of the best comedians of all
time. I could even say he was the
greatest all-round song and dance man
of all time. And millions (including
the Pike Pickens Fan Club in Colday,
Jupiter) would agree with me. True,
there are many who would disagree
(especially those who get so much
stupid satisfaction out of “musicolor-
oma”) for Pickens and his show was
something you had to either love or
loath. No fence sitters as far as Pick-
ens was concerned.

  Now I rather liked Pike Pickens
and his video show. Knew him per-
sonally, of course. Appeared a few
times on his program, in fact. But that
is still another story.

  I thought you might like to know
what happened to Pickens after the
second death of vaudeville. Oh, you
know now, of course, but I bet you
don't know it all. And anyway I mean
right after the depresh hit us.

  I know I wondered where Pike had
gotten to. Lost touch with him for
awhile you see. Most all ex-vaude-
villians were seeking employment in
other fields and we didn't always have
time for the old “get-togethers” like
we used to have. . . .

  I finally got this job here. Not bad
when the customers are drunk enough
to be generous and yet not so drunk
as to miss the hat. I often wonder how
much money I actually lose when the
coins roll under the table and are
retrieved by the damned busboy
who I know makes more than me in
tips and poor service he gives too. . . .

 No one seemed to know what hap-
pened to Pickens. Poor Pike. So very
famous. Presumed to be loaded with
the long green. So what if vaudeville
did pffft, they said. Old Pike has
more dollars than he can spend in
two lifetimes. That’s what they
thought. Hah. Remember the Sub-
space Investment Bubble? Pike (and

a few others, myself not excluded) got
took good on that deal. Of course, the
guys behind it didn’t make out so good
either, not unless they can spend the
stuff in sub-sub-space or wherever
they took off to when the govern-
ment boys cracked down on them.

 Well, when I got to wondering
more than a little about Pike and got
over the letdown of working in a
crummy joint like this I thought I’d
look him up. I figured he was probably
doing as bad as me so neither of us
would have anything to be ashamed
of. He didn’t have me on his last few
programs; got the idea it was me who

101
102

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

talked him into the Subspace deal. He
was just as excited about it as any of
us. But I figured we were both too
poor to be sore at each other, and then
there was always the chance that he
was doing a bit better than me and
might know of something extra in the
way of a break for me. Well, you
know how it is.

  I couldn't find Pike anywhere. Im-
agine that, if you can. A big name in
show biz and nobody—but nobody—
knew where he was.

IT WAS only pure luck and by ac-
cident that I found out about him.
I had the afternoon off . . , oh, this
was over a year and a half ago. I went
down to the spaceport to watch this
new job take off. Yeah, I know you
know but listen. All of it, you don't
know.

 Everybody and his brother was
there. Everybody and his brother's
brother. But I'm an old crowd dodger-
througher and managed to get as close
as the law allowed. It looked like just
an ordinary spacer to me and I
thought, hell I shoulda stood at home
and got it on video. You remember,
they were going to make a special
announcement about it and what the
special announcement was. Yeah. Sub-
space. The government had taken it
over and had really developed it. That
is, the science boys with the UN,
though the way the announcer talked
you'd think he'd done it all by him-
self. I think he's the same guy that's
on that early afternoon musicoloroma
show. Hell of a thing to wake up to
but it does give the correct time.

  So this ship was going off into sub-
space and come out on the other side
of Alpha Watchamacallit. Yeah. Cen-
tauri. Ever hear Pike sing his song
on that? Little did he know. . . .

  And they'd be back within a year,
according to the schedule. Yeah, I
know you know all about that but I
wanted to tell you about Pike Pickens.
He was on it. A member of the crew

of the Faraway World! A messman
yet. Of course, Pike always was a
good cook. Gad, the parties he used
to throw and the food. None better.

  Pike—too old? Don’t kid yourself,
buddy. Sure we had that running gag
about his age but don't forget. He may
have been around in show biz a long
time but he started young. Remember
the Child Star of Video? That was
him, under his real name then. Little
Lewey Yoder. Didn't know that, eh?
Why, I thought every Pike Pickens
fan knew that. . . .

  Getting back to Pike and the Fara-
way World. I found out he was aboard
when they read the list of crewmen
and their occupations. At first it
didn't click and I almost didn't hear
it, his name being down at the bottom
of the list of messmen and beginning
with a Y too. When the announcer
said “Lewis Yoder," it didn't mean
a thing to me 'til about two seconds
afterwards. I does a double-take and
ask aloud, “Did he say Yoder?"

  The lady next to me said, “Yoder,
Schmoder, so what? I still don't see
how a submarine is gonna work in
space and it looks just like any old
space^tub to me."

 Get it? Subspace, submarine in
space. She actually said it to. I've been
saving that one; when vaudeville
comes back. . . .

  But getting back to Yoder, alias
Pike Pickens. I knew I had found
him. The announcer said something
about last minute visits of friends and
relatives. I rushed to the administra-
tion building there at the spaceport
and put in a request to visit Pike.
Yoder, that is. Told them it was Very
Important, etc. Thought Pike might
refuse to see me since it looked like
he was hiding out from all of us . But
I was wrong. He saw me and a half
dozen other show biz characters. A
typical Pike Pickens going-away
party, on a much smaller scale than
usual, of course.

  But all we needed was Pike, The
ALPHA CENTAURI CURTAIN CALL

103

bottle he was passing around helped
too, but Pike was Pike at his best
which is the way he always is, in my
opinion. Knocking himself out to get
a laugh. Anything for applause and
haw-haws. He sang. He danced. He
cracked wise. He out-punned Jack
Forst (whom you know is considered
the world’s, in fact, the System’s
champion punster). He did imitations.
Good old Pike. He just threw the
whole thing at us in a half hour or so.
Wonderful. All we had time for was
to say Good Luck and maybe weep a
little into the empty bottle.

  Then Pike danced his way out of
the room—his usual half-drag, half-
bounce exit—and he was gone. Gone
forever, we thought, for we had little
faith in the subspace thing. Even with
the UN backing it now and the fact
that Pike was sticking his neck out.

WELL, that didn’t mean much. Not
that Pike was the hero type but
he wasn’t kidding me with all that
buck and wing, glad-hand, hoopla and
hokum. All that song and dance was
just a cover up. He was really low,
believe me.

  I saw him that way only once be-
fore and that was when his third wife
died. Never married again after that,
you know. Really had a find in her
and bingo she’s killed in that airbus
accident. He put his show on that
night same as usual and a lot of people
said it wasn’t right for him to do it.
But Pike would never let an audience
down, never walk out on his loyal fans.
It was tearing his heart out but he
went out there and put on one of the
best shows video has ever seen. And
that’s the way he was the day of the
take-off. He was just putting on his
last show—for us, his personal
friends; swan song and dance and
then piiiit.

  He figured like we did. Subspace
was The End. He wasn’t going to
stick around and see if vaudeville
would come back. He was living now

and he couldn’t stand living without
it so . . . death to Pike Pickens and
let Lewis Yoder, messman, live awhile
until . . . until whatever happens to
people who dare to enter subspace
happened. It was supposed to be a
short cut to other systems. He hoped
it would be a short cut to oblivion.

  O.K., O.K., I’m telling it.

  You see, Pike Pickens wasn't dead
at all. You just can’t kill a good vaude-
villian. How do I know? I got it from
a spaceman who was also a crew-
member on the Faraway World. You
remember when the Faraway World
returned and was covered with glory
and whatnot. Well, of course, I tried
to find out if Pike got back OK but
when I got to the spaceport it was so
jammed with people I couldn’t even
get into the place this time. Why they
didn’t stay at home and get it on video
I’ll never know.

 Well, I had a reason for going
down. I had to see if our boy Pike
got back. Finally I gave up trying to
buck the crowd and went across the
street to a bar. Thought I’d wait ’til
things calmed down.

  A guy was sitting there drinking
beer and making loud smacking noises
and then he’d bang his fist on the bar
and sing out for more. I noticed he
wasn’t paying and wondered about it
until the barkeep says for him to
drink up, spaceman, it’s on the house.

  “I been dreaming of this,” said the
spaceman, “I been dreaming of this
for months. Real honest-to-gawd beer.
Aaah.”

  “Maybe I should call you subspace-
man,” cracked the barkeep. I got it
then. This spaceman was a special
friend of the barkeep’s and somehow
he had eluded the cheering crowd and
got into this quiet little bar to enjoy
his beer in peace. This guy was a Far-
away World crewman and maybe he’d
know about Pike. So I asked him.

  “Lewis Yoder,” he repeated rather
doubtfully, "Yoder ... Oh! You mean
Pike! OW Pike Pickens. Hell, we
104

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

recognized him right off. Him and
that fake name, Yoder! Who wouldn’t
know Pike? Why I've been a Pike
Pickens fan for as long as I can re-
member/'

  My heart warmed to this intelligent
young spaceman. It is people like him
who will bring vaudeville back to its
true place in the world of show busi-
ness.

  “Could you tell me—about Pike?"
I asked. I was a little afraid. If any-
thing had happened to him . . . Yet I
had to know. You know how it is.

  “Tell you about Pike," he said,
“Could I tell you about Pike? I sure
as hell could t Every man jack on the
Faraway World could tell you about
Pike! I suppose it'll hit all the news-
casts but who'll believe it or get it
right? Let me tell you about Pike
Pickens. Like he used to say. Voss
Dere, Chollie."

  He told me about Pike,

IT SEEMS that the trip through
subspace was a snap. No one even
got spacesick. In fact, those who had
gotten spacesick from being in regu-
lar space felt good again when they
went into “subspace drive"—whatever
that means. And got sick again when
they came out of it and into normal
space again. They got to Alpha You-
know and were coasting around look-
ing for a planet similar to Terra or at
least one where they could use the
suits and masks they use on Venus,
Jupiter, etc. This you must have
heard or read.

  Well, after all their technical test-
ing and what not, they land on this
small planet which proves to be sim-
ilar to good old Terra in atmosphere
and gravity. They divide the crew up
into scouting parties and take turns
going out looking for inhabitants,
Hot'n, fauna, and other things and stuff
they look for on alien planets.

  I guess the science boys had a great
time, though every one else had been
&ored by the trip and were even more

bored by the planet. It was similar to
Earth as far as gravity and air were
concerned but the landscape looked
like one big rock slab with cracks in
it here and there. Some crazy kind of
vegetation grew in clumps around
these cracks but otherwise—nothing.

  Incidentally, the spaceman told me
that the boredom of the trip had been
alleviated by Pike's putting on some
of his acts for the crew. I guess most
of them liked it, though the spaceman
said there were a few who actually
got up a petition asking him to “can
it" for a couple of days. Now how any-
one can be bored by the versatility of
Pike’s talents I'll never know.

  Anyway, like I said, the crew was
divided up into scouting parties and
came the day that the party Pike was
in (though I'm sure it wasn’t his favo-
rite kind of “Party," heh-heh-heh) was
supposed to do the scouting. Each
day the party on duty would make a
circle of the ship going out farther
each time. I think it was the third or
fourth day of scouting, if I remember
correctly.

  The spaceman who told me this was
in this party too. Name? Oh yes, his
name was Wally. Wally said they got
pretty far away from the spacer. They
had two of the techs with them, the
scientists, you know. About all the
crewmen had to do was keep a sharp
lookout and let the techs know if they
saw anything unusual or saw trouble
coming, etc. They had stopped near
one of those big cracks in the rock
floor and the techs were messing
around with the vegetation growing
there.

  Wally was helping Pike set up his
portable mess outfit as it was getting
near chowtime. Pike, as usual, was
singing and wisecracking while some
of the men laughed and a few dead-
heads grumbled.

  Then it happened.

  Something came up out of the crack
in the rock and absorbed the two
techs. Some of the men would never
ALPHA CENTAURI CURTAIN CALL

105

have saw it happen if the techs hadn’t
screamed all the time they were being
absorbed. It took several seconds, I
guess.

  Of course the men were awe-struck.
And just stood there staring. Then
they started to shoot at the things
with the variety of weapons they car-
ried with them. Everything from .38
pistols to flame-throwers. The thing—
which looked like a big mass of
orange-colored gelatin—wobbled up
out of the crack and came towards
them.

  Looking back over their shoulders
as they ran, they saw that more of the
things were coming up for air too—
and for them. The alien beings must
have had mental telepathy or some-
thing because presto! more of them
popped up out of the ground several
yards ahead of them. They were sur-
rounded; cut off from the ship. The
techs had been carrying the walkie-
talkie and it was gone with them.

 Eventually someone would come
from the ship looking for them. Even-
tually. In the meantime the . .. the ...
things would be eating them alive.

WALLY or someone figured the
things could throw up an in-
visible shield around themselves; only
way he could explain that the weap-
ons didn’t stop the monsters. The
things moved slowly but were closing
steadily in. . . . Everyone was scared
speechless.

  That is, everyone but our boy Pike
Pickens. He was scared too, but never
speechless.

  “Maybe we can reason with ’em,”
he suggested, “get in contact . . .
think at them. . . .”

  "‘This is no time for jokes,” croaked
someone, “they probably don’t think
the way we do . . . they’re completely
alien. . . ”

  The man started shooting again,
wasting their ammo.

  “Wait a minute 1” called Pike, “I
got an idea!?

 By this time the men were too
scared to object, if they wanted to.
So Pike outlined his plan.

 “Look, guys,” he said. “When I
started on this tour I wasn’t figuring
on coming back. I’m surprised we
got this far. As long as I don’t have
vaudeville to go back to I don’t much
care if I ever get back to Terra or any-
where in our system. Then there was
a gal named Melina . . . gone too. So
here’s what I propose. I’ll do every-
thing I can to attract these things’
attention. I’ll try to get them to chase
me. Then maybe the rest of you can
find a break between and try for the
ship. What can you lose?”

  Nothing could they lose. Someone
suggested drawing lots. Someone sug-
gested that more than one person
make the sacrifice on the theory that
the monsters would be more inclined
to chase two or three people than just
one. But when Pike has the stage he’s
the whole show. No one can steal
scenes from him. He insisted that they
do it his way and there was little time
for argument.

  “Here I go,” he said. That’s what
he always said just .before every show,
just before the signal said On The
Air. . . “Here I go.”

  He started off at an angle between
the two groups of monsters. He faced
the group that was between them and
the ship. If he could distract their
attention, get them after him alone....
He began a sidestep dance and sang:
“Take me back to Alpha Cen-
tauri. . . .”

  The rock ground was really hard
and his metallic shoes made the tap-
clog sound good. This was really his
swan song and dance, yessir. . . .

  He sang louder and danced harder
and gave that familiar shout between
lines. . . .

  “Yaaaaaaaaa...

  The alien beings began to move to-
wards Pike. Pike alone! It was almost
too good to be true, was what some
of the crewmen said. Of course they
106

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

hated to see Pike get it, but the rest
of them would be saved. . ..

  They could see the ship now. If the
monsters would move just a little
more. Pike went into a buck and wing
and then began his imitations. Then
back to the song and dance routine
again, hamming it up good.

  The things kept after him and
Pike kept moving.

  The crewmen broke and ran. Half-
way back to the ship Wally turned
around to see what had happened to
Pike, Fie had heard no screaming. In
fact, he could still hear Pike sing-
ing. . . .

  There was Pike, dancing and singing,

surrounded by the monstrous blobs*

  He raised his voice a pitch higher
and -began all over again.

  The monsters moved in . . . closer
, * . closer. , . .

  Then . . . they all dropped dead.

  Wally said Pike felt really low-
down and blue about it all the way
back to Terra until one of the techs
finally explained to him that it was
probably the sonic vibrations peculiar
to Pike's voice (or any singing human
voice) which killed the alien beings
and not necessarily the quality of
Pike's Songs, Dances, and Snappy
Chatter. . .

  Beer? Don’t mind if I do. . .

ries, asking her to use her influence
with Pemberthy, if she had any in-
fluence, to try to get him the arms
that he so sorely needed.

  “It’s hopeless,” he said. “I can't
Hght lethal rays with quarterstaves
and cutlasses and crossbows—" He
passed his door and did not notice,
would not have cared if he had no-
ticed— “and that fat little beggar is
sitting on top of enough material
to turn this world into a fortress . . ."

  “I'll see what I can do, my dear,
I won't promise anything, but the
next time that he has me up to his
room for cocktails I'll put your case
as strongly as I can. The trouble is,
he might be jealous.”

  “What of?"

  “Nothing.” She smiled up at him,
her eyes greenly luminous under the
rusty hair. “Nothing at all, Alan, but
whose fault is that?"

  “Perhaps mine.”

  “Yes. Perhaps yours.”

  “But a man has certain loyal-
ties . . .”

  “Why worry about loyalties when
time is so short? Tomorrow, or the
4ay after, the black ship of the aliens

may attack. She may, even now, be at-
tacking . . . And whether we win or
whether we lose, it will have been
something to have had each other.
And you talk of loyalties. What cause
has Lauranne given you to be loyal?"

  “I wasn’t thinking of Lauranne,”
lied Latimer. “I was thinking of my
duty to this world, to the race. I was
thinking—” He lapsed into silence
and thought:

  Bloody liar. Of course you were
thinking of Lauranne. And yet—
Ailsa is so different. And itfs no use
kidding yourself that you're going to
win this forthcoming scrap and get
a free pardon and marry the girl. Be-
cause you're not. Even with Thunder-
queen’s armory and workshops thrown
open to youf you wouldn't stand a
snowball's chance in hell. All you can
do is fight to the last man and the last
gun if Fatty Pemberthy lets you have
the guns in time—and see to it that
that mousy little mutant Fenwick
does his stuff before you blow the
last round away. So why not? But
Lauranne . . .

  And there came to him the memory
o£ those lines of poetry that his wife
RAIDERS OF THE SOLAR FRONTIER

107

had quoted when he was new oit
Ceres. Only a short time ago it was,
as men measure time, but it seemed
that Lauranne’s voice was coming to
him over unguessable gulfs.

  There go the loves that wither.

     The old loves with wearier wings;

  And all dead years draw thither,

     And all disastrous things. . ..

  The dead years, he thought, and the
old love that has withered, and a dis-
astrous thing drawing closer and ever
closer from the stars.... I wilt do my
best, I will fight to the last man and
the last gun, but I reserve the right
to snatch some few moments of per-
sonal happiness from the wreck. , .

THEY had come, now, to one of the
big park spaces. At this hour it
was almost deserted, and the sun lamps
in the blue haze of the high roof
were dimmed. And across from the
wide expanse of lawn and beds of
flowering plants there were trees.
And the azure mist seemed to curl
through their branches. In this world
of caves and tunnels where there was
neither night nor day there was yet
the dim mystery of evening. And the
knowledge that the twilight had been
turned on by some grubby little tech-
nician did nothing to detract from its
magic.

  For the magic was within them-
selves.

  Slowly, arms around each other's
waists, they walked across the grass
to the trees. And in the privacy af-
forded by the overhanging branches
they found a couch of soft moss. And
the girl’s face as she lay relaxed, was
a pale glimmer in the dusk, and her
eyes were like two of the stars that
were all that was lacking from the
man-made dusk.

  Latimer stood looking down at her,
There was power in those eyes and a
depth in which he could easily drown.
Now that the moment had come, the
opportunity, he was strangely re-
luctant to press home the attack, It

would be nice to be able to say that it
was the thought of Lauranne that
acted as a deterrent but it would not
be true. What held him back was
the realization that he was not the
attacker but the defender, and the
dim knowledge that far more was at
stake than his unimportant virtueo

 Ailsa said: “Why don't you sit
down? The moss is soft . .

  And Lauranne, although far from
his thoughts, was not far away in the
flesh. The bushes briefly protested at
the rapid passage of a body through
their interlacing branches, there was
the dull gleam of an uplifted blade in
the twilight, and there was a sput-
tering shower of blue sparks as the
blade struck home.

CHAPTER V

The Monsters in Their Midst

ALAN LATIMER was fast. There
was only one thing that saved his
wife’s life—and that was the strange
thing that had happened when she
buried her knife in the body of her
rival. It didn’t make sense. And so
Latimer, who by his grip on Laur-
anne’s wrists had prevented a sec-
ond blow did not turn the knife as
he could easily have done, did not
end Lauranne’s life as she had ended
Ailsa Rae’s.

  But he said bitterly, with grim in-
tensity: “You bitch!"

  “I’m not sorry. You can’t make me
say I’m sorry. You can break my
wrist and use my knife on me, but I'm
glad I did it!"

 “How did you know we were
here?"

  “What does it matter. I wanted to
see you—oh, no, nothing personal
merely something that you, as Big
White Chief of Ceres should have
known about. And when you didn’t
come I went, first, to the Boss’s of-
fice. And there were two officers from
the ship just going in with a big
case, but the guards wouldn’t let me
108

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

in. And while I was still arguing
Kimball came out with the two men
from Thunderqueen, and told me that
you had been there with Pemberthy
and Wood about an hour ago . .
“You saw Kimball?”

 “And why not? Is there a law
against it?”

  “No. But it may interest you, my
dear, to know that the last time I
saw the Boss, Wood was sending him
on a trip down to the fertilizer tanks.
And he had his belly blown out . . .”
“But I saw him. I tell you I saw
him . .

  Latimer relaxed his grip of his
wife’s wrists. He wanted time to think
things out. It seemed that there was
some phony time element involved,
but Lauranne had said that she had
seen the Boss after she had sent Lane
with his message. And the problem
was of -such importance that it
dwarfed into insignificance the fact
that at their feet the girl Ailsa was
sprawled ungracefully supine, a
broken doll. He forgot Ailsa, but
Lauranne did not.

 Before Alan Latimer could stop
her she had fallen upon the body, was
ripping and thrusting with her knife.
And a low moaning sound came from
the dead woman’s lips, and her right
arm went up feebly, jerkily, to ward
off the attack, and the right knee
flexed and then suddenly straight-
ened. And again there were the sput-
tering sparks, the smell of ozone. And
something small and hairy scuttled on
long, spidery legs from under the
body, screaming shrilly and wordless-
ly as it ran.

 Lauranne threw her knife, bilt
missed. And Latimer jerked himself
out of his mood of shocked stupefac-
tion and jumped. He landed squarely
on the little monstrosity. And as he
stamped its life out with his heavy
boots he found himself feeling grate-
ful that he was in uniform and not
shod with thin civilian sandals.

  He turned to look at his wife, and

she stood and looked at him, and the
twilight seemed alive with stealthy
menace.

  He said: “So that’s the way of it.
That’s why Wood never knew me, al-
though he was executive officer of
Thunderqueen when she picked up
Pathfinder*s boat. And that’s why
there have always seemed to be too
damn’ many of these people from the
ship.”

HE STOOPED over the body. It
was now as lifeless and as un-
convincing as a dressmaker’s dummy.
It was not even very cleverly made,
just a roughly human robot of metal
and plastic. Latimer found the knife,
himself began to rip and tear. But
his use of the weapon was actuated
by curiosity rather than by vicious-
ness. And he found that the robot
had a human brain, part of a human
brain, just a sliced and mutilated
mass of grey tissue floating in a
transparent container, with wiring
running from it to the little com-
partment in the lower part of the
body that had housed the alien, the
controls of the robot.

  “Just a Trojan Horse,” murmured
Latimer softly. “But how. . . . Oh,
that’s the way it must have been.
They’re master psychologists, these
. . . things. And, given the rough
framework as a basis, they could
create the illusion of a living, breath-
ing actuality. And they’d have the
victim’s memory cells to work
with. . . .”

  He held the container in his hands.
“It—she—must still be alive. . . .”
And he felt an overwhelming re-
gret that he had never known the real
Ailsa Rae—and when his mind
slipped into imaginings of what must
have been done to her, and to all of
Thunderqueen*s crew, he was glad
when Lauranne jerked him back to
the present with a voice that was un-
naturally harsh.

  “So you fell in love with a thing
RAIDERS OF THE SOLAR FRONTIER

109

like an overgrown spider! Aren't you
grateful to me for saving you from
a fate worse than death?” she
sneered.

  “I suppose so/' he replied listless-
ly, ungratefully. “But what was it
you wanted me for?”

  “You can take an intelligent inter-
est now, can’t you? Well, I went out
through the northwest gate, it’s hard-
ly ever used, as you know. And I
found a ship’s boat. There was a man
beside it, he must have died almost
as soon as he set foot outside the
airlock. The boat itself was damaged;
some kind of projectile had smacked
clean through the cabin. And the
pilot must have been wounded by it,
got into his suit, and lasted just long
enough to get down to Ceres. . .

  “A boat! Lauranne, this is great!
It means that we can get news
through to Earth!” Then his face
darkened. For all that he or anybody
on Ceres knew, Earth had fallen al-
ready to the invaders, was overrun
with little horrors that scuttled on
long, spidery legs, that screamed
wordlessly as they ran. He could not
hope to fathom the alien mentality,
but it seemed to him that those who
had come in the captured liner would
hardly have bothered themselves with
Ceres, unless the penal planetoid was
merely the laboratory out of which
would come the formula for the con-
quest of the Solar System.

  “We will see the boat,” he said.

 “What about this?” Lauranne
spurned with her foot the wreckage
that had been Ailsa Rae. “And that?”
She pointed with her toe to the pulpy
mass out of which protruded one
long, many-jointed leg.

  “Yes. You’re right. If they find this
mess the balloon will go up at once.
And we shall have no chance either
to warn Earth or to put the other
plan into effect. . . .”

  He took the knife, and with its aid
scraped a shallow grave. With scant
courtesy he pushed the robot’s body

into it, and then gingerly lifted the
crushed remains of the alien and
dropped them beside the body. He
stood with the brain case, the pitiful
remnant of what had been the girl
Ailsa bobbing gently up and down
inside it, in his hands. He made as
though to put into the grave, hesi-
tated, looked at the knife that he had
left lying on the ground.

  Lauranne snatched the case from
his hands. She threw it down,
snatched up the knife and put all her
strength into one, chopping blow.
The little plastic sphere split, the
fluid and what had been floating in
the fluid oozed over the moss.

  “And that’s .all,” spat the. woman
viciously. “Bury it with the rest of
the rubbish and come and look at the
boat.”

THE sun was harshly bright over
the northwest face of Ceres when
they stepped out of the rarely used
airlock. The lifeboat was not imme-
diately visible. At first Latimer was
inclined to doubt the truth of Laur-
anne’s story, to believe that she had
lured him out here for some dark
purpose of her own.

  It so happened that the killing of
her rival was not murder, was just
the first minor victory of humankind
over the aliens. But he knew that this
fact was merely incidental. And he
felt for his wife a new respect that
was more than the old respect re-
vived. That had never held a tinge
of fear. He was glad that she wa3
leading the way, that he did not have
to bear ever in mind his unprotected
back.

  “Here we are,” said Lauranne sud-
denly, her voice tinny in the speaker
of the helmet set. She was standing
on the brink of one of the many
craters that pitted the face of Ceres.
This one was almost circular, was
about fifty feet in depth. The walls
were rugged, but it was the rugged-
ness of molten matter that, in solidt-
no

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

fying, has made a permanent record
of all the eddies, the liquid turbu-
lence, of its flow. At first the boat
was almost invisible. Only the very
extremity of her bows reflected the
shaft of sunlight that slanted down
into the pit. And then, as the sun
rapidly climbed into the black
heavens, she was revealed as by the
pulling back of a dark curtain.

  Carefully, choosing each foothold
and handhold with caution, Lauranne
clambered down into the crater. Lati-
mer followed. And it was not long
before he was standing on the fused
rocks, looking up at the hull of the
boat that was of greater importance
to him, and the race, than to the crew
of the ship for which it had been
supplied.

  He shifted his regard to the open
airlock, the flimsy, telescopic gang-
way, and the body that lay at the foot
of the spidery contraption. It was
that of a man, and though his armor
was undamaged he himself had suf-
fered grievous hurt* It was easy to
see through the transparent globe of
the helmet that one side of the face
was dark with clotted blood, that,
had the pilot lived, he would never
have seen again out of that eye.

  Latimer looked up to the cabin of
the boat. He saw the ragged hole that
had been made by the passage of a
projectile, decided that the damage
had been done by one of the four-
inch guns carried by merchantmen as
a concession to those who demanded
that the liners of space go armed
about their lawful occasions. He
smiled grimly. If those antiquated
weapons couldn’t even put a ship’s
boat completely out of commission,
what use would they be against a
pirate or a raider from Outside? But
all this was irrelevant. He climbed
the catwalk into the cabin.

  Once inside the little compartment
he ignored the bloodstains, the dam-
age that was more spectacular than
serious. What held his attention was

the log book on the desk by the con-
trol panel. He read the words: Log
of the Spaceship Thunderqueen, Voy-
age 45. Commenced April 14, 2357;
Finished. . . .

 And where the date should have
been filled in, would have been filled
in had Thunderqueen completed her
voyage, was a dark splash. It could
have been ink, but Latimer preferred
to think that it was blood. It was
more symbolic.

 With clumsy, gloved hands he
tried to open the stiff board covers.
At his first attempt he found himself
reading the details of the liner’s load-
ing at Port Curtis, at the second at-
tempt he struck a day’s routine
record of orbits and positions, all the
trivia of a well run ship. And his
third attempt revealed only blank
pages.

LAURANNE had followed him into
the boat

 “Shut the doors,” he ordered.
“Both of them.” The woman obeyed.
And then Latimer went to the locker
in which were kept spares and tools
of all kinds, took a sheet of thick,
transparent plastic and hurriedly and
roughly cut it to shape with the big
shears. He took the electric welder
out of the box, hoped that there
would be enough power in the bat-
teries to operate it. There was. And
when the joints had been made to his
satisfaction he opened the valve of
the emergency air tank, snapped
down the switch of the cabin heater.

  “Why didn’t he . . .?” began Laur-
anne.

 “Maybe he couldn’t. It’s easy
enough when you have two hands to
work with, and it’s my guess that the
poor devil had only one. . . .” Lati-
mer was stripping the thick, metal-
plated gloves off his hands as he
spoke. He flung open the visor of his
helmet. And he snatched the log
book from the desk and started to
read aloud.

calligraphy.

not have been much fight, but heard one
or two shots. Waited what seemed like
hours, then Wood and Perkins came
back. One by one took us down to Main

theatre—was operating theatre. They
had their robots ready—just flimsy
things of wire and plastic with motor*

things. And in head. . . •

  They opened up people’s brain cases.
Sliced away most of brain—kept only
what they wanted—memory and such.
Put this in transparent balls with a mess
of wiring, put them in robots' heads.
And then robots came alive—weren't
any longer ramshackle dummies.

  But the blood—and the screaming. . . .
No anesthetics, of course. And bodies
sprawling around with no tops to their

CHAPTER VI
To the Last Man

WOMANLIKE, following his re-
cital of the dead man's log,
Lauranne had been inspecting the fit-
tings of the little cabin. A switch
went down under her inquisitive fin-
gers. And, suddenly, there was music,
strains that abruptly faded and were
replaced by a man’s voice.

  “On the last note it will be pre-
cisely eighteen hundred, G.M.T.,” it
said. The measured notes came in
strong and clear. Then: “Here is the
news. . . .” There followed a recital
of the past day’s events on Earth and
in the colonies. There was nothing
to merit a headline. There was no
word of Thunderqueen, not a whis-
per of alien invasion.

  Latimer sighed gustily. "I was al-
ways afraid that we were the last,
and not the first,” he admitted. "But
this is as far as they've got.” Then:
“Hell! The radio! It works!”

 “Of course it works. Pemberthy
and Wood—or the things masquerad-
ing as Pemberthy and Wood—went
along to our station with Carter. And
in charge of the box of tricks right
now will be a thing masquerading as
Carter. . . .

 “Here’s the way I see it. When
they indulge in their fancy brain
surgery they help themselves to all
the memories of the victim. They
know a fair amount about Earth, and
they found out about Ceres. This
world has been just a laboratory
guinea pig. They're working out
techniques, finding out how much
they can get away with. And when
they're ready they'll take over, leave
a garrison, and push off in Thunder-
queen for Earth.

  “And if they handle things really
well, nobody will ever know that
there's been an invasion. At least,
not until they can afford to come out
into the open and slaughter the few
real humans who survive. . . .”

  “And what do we do about it?"
“Now we have the boat we can
warn Earth. What sort of shape is
she in?”

  “Not bad. . . . But how that poor
devil managed to land her—weak as
he was and with only one good hand
—is more than I can say. The Jovian
System is handiest now. ... If we
can take the boat there we can use
their wireless. . . .”

  “But suppose. . . .”

 “Have to take that risk I’ve
checked the fuel. Even to Ganymede
it means free fall most of the way.”
“And the other plan, the original?"
“Don’t know. But it would be safer.
Trouble is that we can't trust Fen-
wick to go ahead with his part of it
unless he has moral support, or a
pistol at his back. , .
RAIDERS OF THE SOLAR FRONTIER

, “Yes, it would be best. That and
the boat. And I’ll see what I can do
with Fenwick. . .

  They clambered out of the lifeboat,
down into the pit into which she had
been set. As they passed the dead
man Latimer thought briefly of giv-
ing him decent burial, decided re-
gretfully that there where so many
other things of far more pressing
importance. And the unknown watch-
officer of the Jovian liner would not
thank them for wasting time on a
ceremony that would, shortly, be en-
tirely meaningless.

  The sun had set and the cold struck
through their insulated suits. Lati-
mer looked up at the frosty stars,
wondered whence had come the little
world with its alien invaders. He
wondered how many other races had
fallen victims to its vampire inhabit-
ants, then dismissed such queries
from his mind as being useless. If
things went well nobody would ever
know anything about the aliens ex-
cept such scraps of information that
survived about their appearance,
their methods of waging war. The
log of Thunderqueen would be the
tomb of a race. If Fenwick's doubt-
ful courage would stand the test.

  They came to the airlock. Together
they entered the prison world of
Ceres, with its parks and its gardens,
its cargo of broken lives, its freight
of menace from beyond the stars. To-
gether they walked along the softly
lit corridors, closer to each other than
they had been for many a month. And
together they entered the park in
which the false Ailsa had been
killed.

  It seemed—here in this world with-
out seasons—that there was the smell
of autumn in the air; Every breath
they took brought with it the sense
of the transitory nature of all things.
But the spell was abruptly broken
when they came to the grave in which
they had buried the shattered re-
mains of Alien and robot.

  An open, empty trench yawned be-
fore their eyes.

IT WAS Fenwick who was first to
meet them.

  As they hurried over the wide ex-
panse of park they saw a little, agi-
tated figure stumbling towards them.
And the grotesque haste of the little
man, flitting through the twilight
like some agitated bat, served to em-
phasize the distant mutter of side-
arms, the roaring murmur of many
voices, of which they had become in-
creasingly conscious.

  “Latimer I” gasped Fenwick. “It is
you, isn't it, Say it is you! They've
taken the controls of the moving
ways, they hold all the airlocks. . . .
And our people are holding out in
the Marlowe Memorial. . . ."

  “How are they doing?"

  “They can’t hold much longer. The
others have more guns—the only ones
that we have are those we've taken
from dead bodies. And they aren’t
bodies, Latimer. They aren*t bodies.
... I tell you that they're only flimsy
affairs of wire and plastic. . . . What
are these things? And they’ve
brought heavy guns from the ship,
mounted on carriages, and they're
firing them down the corridors and
tunnels. . .

  “Is the tunnel clear?"

  “I don't know. It was. I came past
that way, and I didn't see anybody
... or anything. . . . But you're not.
, . . Say that you're not!"

  “I am, Fenwick. We are. Come on!"

  Latimer pulled out the gun that
he had taken from the body of the
thing clothed as Ailsa Rae. With his
left hand he gripped the arm of the
little thief. Lauranne, on the other
side, did likewise. They hurried him
over the short grass, towards the
mouth of the tunnel that would af-
ford the shortest approach to the big,
burglarproof door. Proof—that is—
against the common run of cracks-
men. But this Fenwick was not of the
114

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

commonality. Star-b e g o 11 e n, his
father a spaceman, the faulty insula-
tion of some long ago broken-up ship
had produced in him a mutation, a
gift, that could have led to distinc-
tion, fame, in the world of science.
That would have led to such distinc-
tion had it not been for the fatal taint
that had brought him to rot on Ceres.

  It was an awareness of more di-
mensions than three. It was the abil-
ity with simple tools, or no tools at
all, to force the most complicated
lock of Man’s devising to his will.
It was a gift that could have been
used to unlock the ultimate secrets
of matter. And it was a gift that had
been used to unlock safes and the
vaults of banks.

  It was a gift that, in the end, would
procure for its owner a world for a
funeral pyre.

  As they left the park the thunder
of gunfire became louder, more om-
inous. The crackle of the smaller
weapons was almost continuous, and
now and again would come the deep,
reverberating boom of the artillery.
Latimer thought of his men hemmed
in in the Marlowe Memorial, wished
vainly that he was with them. And he
wished that he had some way of let-
ting them know that the rearguard
action they were fighting was not in
vain, that every minute gained con-
tributed to the ultimate downfall of
the invaders.

  There had been fighting along this
tunnel. There were the bodies of men
and women. Some few had been shot
in the head; those corpses had not
been violated. The majority had been
killed by body wounds. Every battle-
field in Man’s long, bloody history
has known the plunder of the slain,
but never such gruesome pillage as
this.

  At the mouth of the tunnel leading
to the door to the power plant there
were four guards. They wore robot
bodies, their own flimsy anatomies
could never have hoped to handle the

heavy guns that they carried. But
these were no robots clothed in the
illusion of flesh and blood. They had
a rough, scarecrow similarity to hu-
mankind and that was all.

  Unaccountably they hesitated. It
may have been that they took the
three running towards them for their
own kind. Although that, in view of
their undeniable telepathic powers,
is doubtful. But they hesitated. It
was only for a split second, but it was
enough. The circuits and relays ac-
tuating their mechanical muscles
could never hope to equal the speed
with which Latimer aimed and fired.
The sound of gunfire was thunderous
in the tunnel, and before the last
echoes had even considered dying all
four of the alien guards were down,
each with an explosive slug in the
compartment in which lived the con-
trolling intelligence.

 And Fenwick was down.

HE WAS not dead; one of the
bullets fired by the guards had
struck the tunnel wall against which
he was crouched. The explosion had
driven fragments of stone deep into
his side. He was not dead, yet. Laur-
anne knelt beside him, doing what
little she could, whilst Latimer col-
lected the weapons of their fallen
enemies.

 The wounded man writhed and
groaned.

  “Stay with me,” he pleaded. “Don't
let them open my head. . . .
Don’t. . . .” He clung to Lauranne’s
hand, looked up at her with the
pleading eyes of a hurt spaniel

  “I’ll stay,” she promised.

  With pistols stowed all around his
person, Alan Latimer came to his
wife and Fenwick.

  “How is he?” he demanded, little
of gentleness in his tone.

  “Hell last,” replied the woman.
“Long enough. . . .”

  They picked up the wounded man,
carried him to the huge, gleaming
RAIDERS OF THE SOLAR FRONTIER

115

door that blocked the tunnel. They
set him down on the stone floor. They
looked in baffled wonderment at the
array of wheels and dials and sym-
bols set on the metal surface. It
seemed to them that even if one
should have the right combination
the opening of the way to the power
station would be a task only to be
undertaken after prayer and fasting.

  Fenwick looked up at the door too.
It was not the first time he had seen
it. When he arrived on Ceres he had
been taken by Kimball, who had
heard of his gifts, to make an inspec-
tion. The Boss had asked him then
if he could open the door without
unleashing the doom that lay behind
it. Truthfully, he had replied no. If
he had been able to answer yes he
would have been, after the Boss, the
most powerful man in Ceres.

 Now he was the most powerful
man in Ceres.

  And the irony of it was that, if he
were asked the same question as be-
fore, the answer would be an un-
qualified affirmative.

 In the past the power that lay
within his mind had been a wild tal-
ent, uncontrolled and uncontrollable.
It had been impossible to concentrate,
to hold the flickering picture steady.
Not that it was ever a picture—the
word is used merely for convenience.
But the sense of perception came and
went, faded and waxed strong, faded
again not to return for hours, or days,
or months. Now, with the changes
wrought in his brain and neural
structure by pain, by the slight de-
composition that precedes the death
of a living organism, the picture was
bright and steady. And his mind, as
it were, went out and handled the
beautiful intricacies of lever and
tumbler, electronic flow and magnetic
field.

  And understood.

  “Are you sure you can tackle it?"
Latimer demanded

  “Of course I'm sure. L . . .*

  He tried to rise to his feet, reached
for the nearest wheel, fell heavily.
And a growing, glistening pool on
the floor where he had fallen was
mute testimony to the inadequacy of
Lauranne’s rough bandaging. He
looked up at them, his wizened, grey
little face contorted with pain.

  “I can do it,” he whispered. “I can
see the levers and tumblers. But one
of you will have to turn the dials...
Then, “But I don’t want to die. I
don’t want to die!”

LAURANNE reached out. She
snatched one of the pistols from
her husband's belt. She cocked it,
making sure that this simple opera-
tion was performed as noisily as pos-
sible. She pressed the cold muzzle
against Fenwick’s neck.

  “Now will you do it?”

  “Yes. Yes! That dial there, the
top right hand one. Turn it to
D-O-O-M-S-D-A-Y. . . ”
“Doomsday?” She struck Fenwick
across the face with the barrel of the
weapon. She struck him again. He
started to scream, but she struck him
yet a third time. . . .

  “Stop it!” shouted Latimer. “You
are smashing the poor devil’s face!”
“I know it. Now, Fenwick, this
TDoomsday' of yours. That word has
an ominous ring. . . . Could it be. . . ."
her voice was low, almost caress-
ing . . . “that the dial you want me
to turn is one of the controls of what-
ever safety device this door must
have?” She raised the pistol threaten-
ingly. “Answer me!”

  “Yes . . .” whimpered the little
crook. “Yes. Don’t touch the dials.
Just the wheels. And don’t. . . .
Don't'”

  She said: “If you’re lying again
They won’t find any head on you
worth cutting open”

  “That lower right hand wheel . . **
babbled Fenwick almost delirious.
“Take it. Turn it to oh three, seven,
then left-handed to three four six.
116

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

Right-handed to oh three five. , ,
"Wait.” She turned away from the
wounded man, left him dabbing in-
effectual hands at the blood stream-
ing from his battered face. She ran
back along the tunnel to where Alan
Latimer was standing, guns ready,
poised to fight off alien interruption.
She caught his arm, pushed her face
close to his, whispered: "Haven’t you
forgotten something?”

 "What?”

  "The boat, you fool. Aren’t you
supposed to be galloping off to warn
the System?”

  "Not now. We can’t leave Fenwick
by himself to open the door. We must
stay.”

  "Only one of us need stay. . .

  “Of course. You’ll find the boat
fairly easy to handle. And remember,
free fall as much of the way as pos-
sible.”

  441 can’t handle a boat. Given un-
limited fuel for experiments I might
make Ganymede, provided that the
air and food and water hung out. You
must go.”

  "But we can’t leave Fenwick.”

  "I shan’t leave him.” .

  Then Latimer turned to face his
wife. He said: “You’re right. Of
course you’re right. But can’t you see
that I can’t go?”

  Lauranne said bitterly: "If Ailsa
Rae were sitting in that space scow
waiting for you, you’d be off like a
shot! Go, damn you! Do you think
that I want to die with you after
what has happened?”

 Latimer turned white under his
tan. His lips worked, but he said
nothing. Then, at last, the bitter
words came. “Take these,” he said,
pulling two of the pistols from his
belt. "You might want to shoot me in
the back.”

  He turned abruptly, strode down
the tunnel. Lauranne stood and
watched him go, half raised her arms,
let them fall hopelessly to her side.
<wYcu fool,” she whispered. “You fool

Of course I don’t want to die with
you. I want to live with you!”

  Slowly, listlessly, she made her
way back to where Fenwick, an un-
tidy bundle of rags, was sprawled
on the tunnel floor. She looked down
at the dying man, then at her wrist
watch. “Thirty minutes at least,” she
muttered. “Have to give him thirty
minutes to get to the boat, fifteen to
get clear at maximum acceleration.”

  And down the tunnel drifted the
sound of gunfire, fainter but still
continuing, showing that some few
defenders yet were gaining for her
the time she needed.

  "And that’s that/* said the Admiral.
He was pleased with himself, had
good reason to be so. The forces un-
der his command had made a land-
ing, had taken prisoners without loss
to themselves, had blasted a little
world into a thin, faintly luminous
haze. And when the Admiral let his
mind stray to those same prisoners—
obscene, spidery things that scuttled
about their cages on many-jointed,
£imsy legs—he felt no compunction
over the act of destruction that he
had performed.

  “Where's that fellow Latham . . «
Latimer?” he demanded of an aide.
44Think I'll have him up for a
drink. . . .”

  But Latimer did not come. Instead
came a messenger who told of how
the ex-lieutenant had burst into the
prison compartment, had opened £re
with two pistols, slaughtered the
helpless Aliens. The guards had tried
to stop him. One had been killed out-
iight9 the other was not expected to
live.

 44And he was saying something*
concluded the messenger. 441 couldn’t
make it out, sir, but it sounded like
poetry. Something about old loves»
and dead years, and disastrous things,
it sounded like.

  44But that was just before he shot
himself."

FLYING SAUCERS

Dear Editor:

  I have been a reader of Fantasy stories
for a great many years and after perusing
the first issue of your new magazine, I am
writing my first fan letter to tell you that
I really enjoyed the stories.

  Although I have always had a preference
for stories of prehistoric civilizations, etc.,
I have become more interested recently in
“out of this world” adventures, such as
space and Time, The “Flying Saucers” of
the present day (?) have become such a
controversial subject that one has the feel-
ing that there must be something going on
of which the general public is in ignorance.

  Of all the stories in your magazine, the
one by Mack Reynolds stands out in my
mind, . . . One wonders if his story “The
Discord Makers” is altogether fiction.

  I am glad Fantasy magazines are getting
away from “horror” covers. I believe such
type of covers have been a detriment to
the magazines in the past, for certainly
more people are buying stf magazines than
ever before. Some covers were much too
nightmarish for the general public who
would not buy them. Many people still
think of the stories as “trash” but I have
found some very interesting theories in
many of them.

  Wishing your new publication the best
of luck, I am, Yours truly,

                     E. Gordon,

1069 E. Market St., Akron, Ohio

  also sure that readers prefer fiction
  to comment. For that reason we must
  regretfully omit many of the interesting
  letters we have received and we must
  limit ourselves in many cases to publish-
  ing excerpts from comments rather than
  the whole letters. You are invited to
  write to us about this issue and let us
  know your thoughts and suggestions*

           IT’S TERRIFIC

Dear Editor:

  Out of This World is one of the best
things that ever happened to the fantasy
and science fiction world. It's terrific!

  Being only 16 years old, I just love
your illustrated section. Please make it
longer. I enjoyed every story and the art
work is darn good.

  You’ll have to put O.O.T.W. out on a
monthly basis or I’ll go nuts waiting for
each issue. Yours truly,

PICKED UP SPEED RAPIDLY

Dear Ed:

  Well! And Vol. 1 No. 1 certainly is. It
didn’t get off to such a good start, but it
picked up speed rapidly.

  Surely Cummings can do better next
time. He has! This one shtunk. (One stink
above stunk!)

  Old V. V. Vas Vunderbar!

  “Omega” had a good thought, new, too,
but slipped somewhere.

  Puzzle Pi made this a “Wish Ish.” (Wish
There Were More.) Didn’t, in fact, kno;
Tenn had such a good Penn.

  “Boggey” must have been written by the
kid. Which same would have been alrighl
if he had told it.

“Terror” was good writing. Especially
at first. The idea was good. This should

with rifles by +he door. They nodded,
and their rifles swung aruund.
“Psycho,*' Clevenger said.
Ballance’s hands fumbled around
his desk, came up with a revolver. He
pointed it at Burkeson who didn’t
seem to notice, or care particularly.

 '‘Burkeson!*' Ballance shouted
crisply. “Snap out of it, man. That’s
mutiny you’re talking! Insubordina-
tion! Guards, take him back to the
rocket to the Doc, give him a hypo
and—”

  Burkeson laughed. “Fools, fools!”
He laughed until he cried. “Poor
proud fools!”

  Clevenger waded through a pile
of pneumatic cushions, piles of tape
recorders and tape and files. He
yelled at Burkeson.

 “What happened to you? You go
outside, then you come back in a few
minutes later, with your top blown.
What’s eating you, Burkeson?”
Burkeson staggered. The muscles
of his face twitched. He opened his
eyes slowly and there was something
leaden and dying in them.

  “We’re humans,” he said, “and we
can’t help what we are. Maybe we
got off on the wrong track some-
where. I don’t know. I don’t blame
you, Clevenger, for being power-mad,
and never able to think about any-
thing except how you can destroy
half the world and kill off billions of
people. . . .'*

  “Burkeson!”

  “No, you’re just something that
happened, like everything else. I
don’t blame you, Clevenger. Or you,
Ballance. I don’t blame anyone. I just
feel sorry for everyone now. I’ll say
goodbye now, because any minute the
Cubes are liable to start doing what
we’ve taught them to do. To hate.
And—kill.”

  “What’re you talking about?” Clev-

enger stepped back. His eyes flick-
ered.

  Ballance said. “Explain yourself.
Or you’ll go back to the ship under
guard, and you’ll be put in solitary
until you get back to Earth for a
trial.”

  Burkeson shivered. “Maybe it’s bet-
ter this way. We’ve gotten this far.
Maybe we’d go on and on and where-
ever we’d go, we would always be
superior. Top dog. Any race that
didn’t look like us—they'd be like
ants in an ant-hill, like you said, Clev-
enger. Wherever we'd go, we’d take
hatred with us, and suspicion, and
contempt, and the ability to conceive
and wage mass warfare, total slaugh-
ter. And who knows, Clevenger,
maybe we’re the only race in the Uni-
verse who can even think of such a
thing. No other animal on Earth ever
thought of it. Maybe what the Cubes
are doing is all right. I don’t know.
It’s too late now to care.”

  Burkeson raised a hand and leaned
against the wall. His face was drawn
tight, and perspiration made a stream
down his throat. The two guards
shifted uneasily, their rifles trained
on his stomach. The weapon in Bal-
lance’s hand wasn't steady. He looked
at Burkeson.

  “All right, I’ll tell you,” Burkeson
whispered. A curious coolness slid
along his spine.

  “We’re all going to die. Maybe if
we start right now, we could get out
of the city. The Cubes don’t under-
stand yet, all of the meaning of what
they got out of me. They’ve learned
about hate, and the idea of killing
for self protection. They've learned
the art of killing to keep from being
killed. It may be a little while yet
before they're able to convert their
faculties to techniques of killing. Bat
there might be a chance. So maybe if

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVfNTURES

we get out of the city fast, we can
snake it—”

  Clevenger smiled thinly. "We don’t
run from a bunch of cubes, Burkeson.
You’re crazy, that’s the size of it.
That sensitive, artistic, mind of yours
has cracked wide open. That music
has been too much for you. Go on
back—"

  "Wait a minute!" Ballance got up.
He moved around the desk in quick
tense strides. "Maybe Burkeson doe*
know something. These men are un-
der my command, and I’m responsible
for their safety. I can’t afford to
overlook a possibility of danger.
After all, Clevenger, we’re in alien
surroundings. We shouldn’t gamble
with these men’s welfare.”

  "It’s too late," Burkeson whispered
harshly. '“The game’s over.”

  "What?**

  One of the guards covering Burke-
son screamed shrilly. He was on his
knees screaming. The other guard had
disappeared. His rifle lay on the
floor. The second guard sprawled out
flat, screaming 'hysterically, pounding
his closed hands against the smooth
glistening floor.

  "He fell apart, all at once, and
nothing’s left of him. He fell apart,
crumbled away in the air. He fell—"
Ballance yelled into his wrist
radiolal phone. "Attention I Atten-
tion I The Cubes are attacking us.
Shoot your way out of the city now!
Now! Every Cube is your enemy. Fire
full neutron charge into every cube
encountered. . . .”

  Ballance was still giving out orders,
and running toward Burkeson when
he crumbled away to drift like dust
on the air. The coiled revolver thud-
ded and spun across the floor. And
suddenly the revolver also disinte-
grated completely, leaving no trace.

CLEVENGER was staring at the
remaining guard’s sprawled body
as it was shaken to pieces, vibrated
-out of existence. The two guards'

rifles followed, into the air ft deemed,
as Clevenger watched.

  He moved in short jerky steps to-
ward Burkeson, and he slid the heavy
coiled weapon from its case and lev-
eled it. His eyes were dark and hot
and saliva quivered on his lower lip.

  His whisper was dry. "You told the
Cubes! Didn’t you? You let them
know why we’re here! You little
sniveling, crawling quisling!’’

  Burkeson shook his head slowly,
sadly. "No. No, they found out from
me, but I don’t know how. A uni-
versality of musical language maybe.
Or maybe just a coincidence that the
•cubes had an emotional evaluation set
to music that is somewhat similar to
ours. Anyway they found out. Just as
I found out things about them.

  "Clevenger—they knew only beauty
and peace—until now. Maybe they did
know other things way back some-
where in their beginning, but it was
almost gone as a racial memory until
now. We revived it, gave it stark
meaning. We’ve changed the music
of their language, Clevenger. Can’t
you hear the thematic change? Can’t
you feel it?"

  Clevenger’s eyes fled wildly around
the hall. His skin was gray and his
eyes were hot and black. There were
two lines, thin ugly lines, crawling
down his cheeks to his mouth. He
wet his lips carefully, and the coiled
revolver shook in his hand.

  "They’ve learned from us," Burke-
son whispered, "a new theme. And
they might have forgotten the mean-
ing of fear and hate and kill. They
knew what we felt. They know that
more and more rockets would come,
af they let them come. And that more
and more hate and contempt would
come with the rockets, and finally
destruction. So they’re stopping us*
Now."

  Clevenger yelled something.

  ''They’re stopping us now, in the
only way we can understand."

 Clevenger screamed. "We’re not

OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURES

finished yet! Maybe they’ll get us,
but there’ll be more rockets all right!
Thousands and thousands! Looking
for revenge for what the Cubes are
and what they’ve done to us. They’ll
atom-bomb this city to dust! All right,
so the Cubes’ll get me! But I’m going
to have the satisfaction of getting
you, Burkeson, my way. You dirty
little quisling!”

  Clevenger started to fire the coiled
revolver. The revolver and his right
arm disappeared. Clevenger stared at
the emptiness. His face was a terrible
sculpture in wet, shiny putty.

 Burkeson gasped. “No! I don't
think any more of our rockets will
ever land here now, or even get within
bombing range of Mars. Not now.
The Cubes have mastered ultrasonics
and supersonics; they can do things
our science won’t reach for a million
years. They can even induce high
frequency focused waves far out in
space to disintegrate any approach-
ing rockets. That’s what I’m won-
dering about now, Clevenger:

  “What is their limit? What is the
isnge of their ultrasonic power?”
Perhaps, Burkeson thought, Clev-
enger was wondering about that too
when his body crumbled away and
-drifted across the room in a cloud of
dissipating dust.

BURKESON staggered into the
Martian afternoon. He "walked
down the wide beautiful street, alone.
He knew he was the only one left
alive now. Molecules shattered into
invisible forms by tremendous accel-
eration, by forces no human mind
could understand.

  A human body changed almost im-
mediately by ultrasonic frequency so
high there was no accompanying
noise or vibration audible, into par-
ticles so small they floated in air, and
were of colloidal dimensions.

 And he felt the growing momen-
tum of the change in the musical
voice of the city.

  He walked stiffly, dazed and numb
with shock, and wifch the other feel-
ings, too. Of resignation, and a sense
of the incredible beauty around him,
not quite drowned yet by hate.

  He sat down in the shade cast by
the rocket and waited. There was
nothing else to do, nothing else he
particularly wanted to do. He knew
that after a while, the music would
alter its theme to such an extent that
there would be no longer any sym-
pathy with him. Then they would get
him too, as they had the others.

  Their hate would rise and rise until
he and the ship would become its ob-
jects. So Burkeson sat and looked at
the distant Martian city spires finger-
ing the moonlight of Phobos. And as
he sat and waited, the symphony from
the city gradually fell into the som-
breness of Flat and Minor keys. It
lost slowly and forever its radiance
and warm joyousness of B, and the
gay brilliance and alertness of D, and
the noble elegance and grace of Bb.

  Flats and Minors dominated com-
pletely, and the brooding thundering
hate rolled through the dark. Sadness
and agitation, and doleful anxiety
changed to brutal, sinister, funereal
and violent hate.

  What is the range of their ultra-
sonic radiative power, Burkeson was
thinking. He looked up. He tried to
pick out which of the stars in the
sky was Earth. But he was no astron-
omer, and maybe that wouldn’t make
much difference either.

  The Cubes had learned the value
of aggression. That complete sudden
devastating offense was the only de-
fense. Again he looked at the stars,
at a probable Earth. If the Cubes
could focus and funnel enough power
—that far. If they could, they would
not wait for any more rockets to cross
that space. . . .

  He stood up, and raised has hand.
Their theme was altered now. He
whispered. “Good-bye, beautiful peo-
ple/*
THE CITY OF SINGING CUBES

123

 A few hours before the Cubes
might have understood this senti-
ment. But not now. Burkeson’s last
sensory impression was of a small
lonely chord in the Major key of E,
trying to be radiant and warm and
joyous, and dying in a rising roar of
thundering discordancies.

thought out.

  “Discord” was just that. An old theme.
I read it, but I always knew what was
coming.

  “Forbidden Fruit” should have been for-
bidden. Same as “Discord.”

  All in all, a very good first try. As for
the comics, well at least cut them to size
and forget about trimmed edges. . . .

LIKES CUMMINGS

Dear Mr. Wollheim:

  Well, well, congrats. The first ish of
Out of This World Ad ventures was a
dandy. Nothing outstanding, but the gen-
eral level of the stories was good.

 Where did you dig up that Cummings
story? It reads like some of his older (and
better) novelettes. I’ve always liked Cum-
mings, since I read “Space Flight of Ter-
ror" some years ago. But lately it seems
to me that most of what stories I’ve run
across by him aren’t much good. “The
Planet Smashers” was different, thol The
old Cummings. Best story in the ish. Fol-
lowed by (in this order): “Omega and the
Wolf Girl,” “The Puzzle of Priipiirii,”
“Terror of the Mist-Maidens,” “The Ship-
wrecked Bogey Man,” “Forbidden Fruit,”
“Letter From the Stars” (How’s chances
for this being the first of a Van Vogt
series?), "The Discord Makers.”

  I didn’t list the comic book section with
rest, but I rather liked it. Something new
in SF mags, anyway.

  Who drew the cover? I don’t know what
it is about that cover, but it gets me. It has
a sort of elusive quality I never before saw
on a cover. Your inside illustrators are

 WANTS A COMPANION MAG

Dear Sir:

  I was pleasantly surprised to find your
mag on the stands. As you say, it is some-
thing new in mags. I’ll be honest with you,
Ed, I just don’t like comics. The stories
were all very good. I’m glad to see Cum-
mings is making a comeback. He’s been
one of my favorites since I read his “Man
on the Meteor.” I think the best story was
“The Shipwrecked Bogey Man.” That kind
of stuff is always good reading.

  Since this mag compares with the old
“Cosmic,” why not bring out another one
like “Stirring”? The short fantasy stories
in that mag are still good reading, almost
ten years after printing. Sincerely,

                             T. J. Oliver

BACK TEN YEARS

Dear Sir:

  What is Avon trying to do, put Science
Fiction back ten years? Comic books don’t
belong in a S-F publication! I have not
yet read the stories in your first issue,
but however good they may be they can
hardly offset the distaste induced by your
“Illustrated Fantasy Stories.” I still can-
not understand how anyone could publish
such junk at this stage of science fiction
development.

  There are a few improvements that could
be made, with respect to the cover and
inside illustrations. These, however, would
be waste of effort until you get rid of the
comics. Yours truly,

                     2757 Claffin Avenue
                     Bronx 63, N. Y.

  (Putting science-fiction back ten years
would bring it back to 1940, a period when
it was showing a very promising boom
similar to today's and nipped only by the
war. Actually it is only in a period of
strength and vigor that a science-fiction
magazine like ours could venture to ex-
periment in an effort to enlarge the circle
of its readers. Our illustrated story section
is such a venture, and rather than "putting
science fiction back,” we are inclined to
believe it will help to spread the borders
of the rapidly growing mass of science-
fiction readers. D. A. W.)

APPROVES ADULT COMICS

Dear Mr. Wollbcim:

  It is with pleasure that we are able to
welcome Out of This World Adventures
into the realm of an ever increasing num-
ber of science-fiction and fantasy maga-
zines. With the plethora of allegedly ser-
ious and semi-serious publications along
the same lines as O. 0. T. W. A., it is
somewhat of a refreshing stimulant to
have your ’zine along with the others due
to the very novel introduction of adult
illustrated “comics” centered around the
STFantasy medium, something which has
not yet been tried elsewhere. . . .

  Albeit, you have at least resurrected
the “comics” from a point of infancy, to
the medium that it virtuously belongs to,
as far as adult entertainment goes.

  Your selection of authors, and their
stories, is indeed commendable for a first
issue, although “name authors” like Van
Vogt, Cummings, del Rey and Tenn isn’t
necessarily the rule for fine stories. How-
ever, it is more for the editor to judge to
the best of his ability rather than for a
large legion of readers to later on condemn
the publication.

  The best stories—and they really were
excellent—in your first issue were:

 “The Planet-Smashers” by Cummings.
. . . **.Letter from the Stars” by Van Vogt.
**Terror of the Mist-Maidens” by Chandler
and “Omega and the Wolf-Girl” by Wm.
Tenn. Regarding the other stories, in brief
retrospect, I can only add that they were
comparably equal to what most other
STFantasy ’zine editors go searching for
with a lighted lantern in order to find.

BOGEY MAN FIRST

Dear Mr. Wollheim:

  Out of This World’s first issue seems a
very promising one. The fiction is inter-
esting, and the artwork well-done. Here
is how I rate the stories:

1-	The Shipwrecked Bogey Man

  This was a fine bit of weird stf, and the
McWilliam pic for it was equally good.
The McWilliam artwork, by the way, was
one of the highlights of the issue.

2-	Terror of the Mist-Maidens
  Chandler, in this story near his best, can

always be depended upon for an interesting
and thought-provoking story. I am glad
that no false note of romance was injected
into TOTM-M.

3-	Letter from the Stars

  A departure from Van Vogt’s usual style,
and a welcome one. I like almost all of
V’s stuff, but a change of pace is in order
once in a while.

4-	Forbidden Fruit

  This was a very fine short story, quite
good, even for Neville.

5-	Omega and the Wolf-Girl

  Lester Del Rey’s stories have undergone
a marked change for the worse within the
past few years, but this was only a bad
story when compared to Del Rey’s better
work.

6-	The Planet Smashers

  The less said about a Cummings story,
the better. This, as all his others v/as un-
adulterated hack.

7-	The Discord Makers

  Reynolds disappointed me in this rather
poor imitation of Conquerer’s Isle.

  The cover was very poor in contrast to
the almost uniformly good inside pics. I
definitely disapprove of the comic section.
If I want to read a joke book (which I
don’t), I’ll go out to the newsstand and buy
one. Comic book stf is usually unoriginal
and childish.

  It appears that I’ve failed to rate Tenn’s
The Puzzle of Priipiirii. I’d rank that story
sixth, between Omega and the Wolf-Girl
and the Cummings opus. Scientifantastic-
ally,

DISAPPOINTED

Dear DAW,

  I have just finished reading the first
edition of Out of This World and I must
say I’m disappointed. I expected much
more from the editor of the Avon Fantasy
Reader, you should know better.

  The cover wasn’t too bad, but I think
there are better mediums than water color,
don’t you? The format of the contents
page was good, but it’s hard to find words
to describe the picture. The last time I
saw anything like it was in the note book
of an aspiring artist aged 5 years. Improve-
ment here is definitely needed.

  The interior pics weren’t too good either.
Martin is all right, but McWilliam should
stick to comic books. How about Finley,
Lawrence and some of the other really
good illustrators?

  The stories were neither good nor bad;
they were not comparable to the stories
you have chosen in the Fantasy Reader.

  And now here is my biggest complaint.
Comics have no place in this type mag,
why use up good “story space’* for that
trash? I do hope the first will be the last.
A reputation for good stories will sell far
more copies than “Heykids! they got fun-
nies in the middle.”

  Hoping to find Vol. 1 No. 2 greatly im-
proved and wishing you all the success in
and out of this world, I remain, Yours,
Stephen Y. Adams

A FINE INITIAL ISSUE

Dear Mr. Wollheim:

I have just read the first issue of the new

S-F magazine Out of This World Adven-
tures, and would like to congratulate you
on a very excellent start. Certainly Avon
is not unknown in this field, but I think
few S-F mags, if any, can point to such a
fine initial issue.

  I also approve of your editorial policy
concerning the stressing of space flight.
This seems consistent with the title of the
mag.	i

  The story by Ray Cummings I especially
Siked, but the others were good, with may-
be a reservation or two.

  I do have a few suggestions: (1) Ac-
knowledge the illustrator. (2) Next time,
get a cover more in line with the accepted
for a science-fiction magazine. (3) Keep
McWilliam, if for no other reason for the
illustration for “Omega and the Wolf-
Girl.” (4) I may be in the minority here,
but I do not especially care for the color

stories. Seems a bit like a comic book, and
hardly appropriate considering the high
plane which has been reached in stf liter-
ature. (5) The two-novelette system is
good, but I thing occasionally a longer
work might be substituted.

  This is rather immaterial, however, for
the difference between a good and bad
magazine lies in the intelligent selection
of stories. I am convinced this is not lack-
ing here, and for this reason, I confidently
predict great success for Out of This

OUR SPRUES SHOWING?

Dear Mr. Wollheim:

  This letter is intended for your sta-
tistical aid only, since I am not interested
in making letter columns. A highly typed
story is interesting chiefly for the treat-
ment, and a fair yarn is down-graded for
a reader who has seen several in the same
pattern, unless the handling is very clever.
This initial issue suggested an analogy
with mass-produced moulded plastic ob-
jects, in that too frequently the sprues and
mould marks showed too plainly.

  Ratings: Best in issue: Shipwrecked
Bogey Man, Letter From the Stars, Puzzle
of Priipiirii.

  Too-simple space opera: Planet Smash-
ers.

  Shook up “Lady or the Tiger” with last
man theme, but poor emulsion: Omega and
the W-G.

Sprues need trimming: Terror of the
Mist-Maidens, Discord Makers, Forbidden

Fruit.

  As to the Comic Book inclusion, I pre-
sume you have a survey indicating I’m in
the minority, or you wouldn’t have done
it? However, if it leads any simon-pure
picture-readers to tackle connected text,
I’m all for it.

  Illus: Cover: Fair. I prefer the “sharp
focus” pix. Inside: Fair. Adequate but not
outstanding.

I was pleased to find the common rash
of misprints and transposed lines missing.
A few errors don’t matter, but too many
pulps appear to have no proofreading ait all,

I go on to them I want to talk about some-
thing else. You know how fans refer to
different STF-zines by using the initials
of the mag? Well, using this system on
your magazine I come up with OOTWA.
Egad!

  Now for comments on the stories:

  "The Planet Smashers” by Ray Cum-
mings was poorly titled. I have read a few
other stories by Cummings and found them
rather dry; this story was an exception. It
had a wonderful setting—all the magic of
the Mardi Gras and the splendor of the
Philadelphia Mummer’s parade and the
magnificence of the Festival of Qen in the
ancient and forgotten city of Sbanadu was
in that story. The setting was very, very
nice.

  The plot, however, was weak. That end-
ing was pretty bad. It is like reading a
detective story and then having the detec-
tive solve the murder with a clue that
wasn’t revealed to the readers; you feel
cheated. . . .

 COMIC SECTION WONDERFUL

Dear Sir:

  Thank you. Thank you very much for
the finest magazine of fantasy and science
fiction literature in a long time. It is really
an unusual magazine with a radical format
and a venture that no other mag has ever
attempted. Your comic section is very
wonderful.

  Avon has done more for the fantasy fans
than any other publishing house. They have
given us such pocket books as Fox Woman,
Out of the Silent Planet, and now Princess
of the Atom. The latter I have just finished
reading and it is superb. I am also glad to
see that it is a first of a series. I now have
the whole group of fans here watching for
the second one—The Green Girl.

  "The Planet Smashers” was a top story.
But it was not up to ‘‘The Princess of The
Atom.” But it was still a fine story. Van
Vogt’s story wac, also very good. Only one
story in the issue was not very good. That
was “The Terror of the Mist-Maidens.” It
was lousy. But no magazine can always
have the very best of the best every issue.
But I can see now that you are striving
for it. Good luck. You will make it. Fan-
tastically yours,

  "I met Frank Bettger when
he was 29 years of age, trying
to soli life insurance, and was
a total failure as a salesman.
Yet during the next twelve
yeare. he made enough money
to purchase a $70,000 country
estate, nnd could have retired
at forty! I know. I saw it hap-
pen. I saw him rise from a
total failure to be one of the
most successful and highest
paid salesmen In America."

of itchy dandruff, seborrhea, and stops the hair loss they cause.

first skeptical just as you are-have proved what we say. Read their
grateful letters. Study the guarantee-it’s better than a free trial!
