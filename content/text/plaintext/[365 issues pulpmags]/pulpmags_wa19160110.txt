Tranldiiv Bit"

        CHAPTER I.
        Quarter-Mile Bend.

EALLY there could be no
question that the car had
got away from her. Stan-
ley Downs, driving his
high-powered Archimedes
down the winding moun-
tain road, had noticed the
girl eight or ten miles
back, and had admired the ease with
which she managed the rakish six-cyl-
inder in the many difficult spots, where
strength, as well as skill, was demanded
to keep the road.

She was a slim, bright-faced young
woman. He knew that, because he had
had one good look at her pretty face as
she swung around a ‘‘hairpin turn” and
passed him on the lower road, while
lie traveled to the bend on the upper.

He had taken a chance in looking

<rA

sideways while preparing to negotiate
the cruel bend with his own car. He
should have kept his attention straight
ahead, without regard to any girl,
pretty or otherwise, who might be pass-
ing two hundred feet away, and who
certainly was paying no attention to
him. .

  “That’s a Fanchon she’s driving,
Karl,” remarked Stanley to his chauf-
feur, who sat idly by his side. “It’s a
new car, and 1 don’t know whether it
is dependable or not. It has speed, and
the lines are graceful and strong. But
until a car has been well tried out, you
never know where a weakness will de-
velop.

  “The FanchOn’s a good car,” pro-
nounced Karl briefly.

  “Glad you know that, Karl, because
it- Hello! What does that mean ?”

  Karl suddenly came to life, as, when
they got around the bend, he, as well
2

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

as Stanley, saw that the Fanchon was
moving faster and faster, and, more-
over, was swaying from side to side in
a wild manner, which, to their experi-
enced eyes, told its own story.

  “Something’s slipped, Karl. She’s
lost control.”

  “She sure has! And there’s the lake
and bridge at the end of the short quar-
ter-mile turn! She can’t make the
bridge at that speed.”

  “Of course she can’t!” returned
Stanley excitedly, as he opened up his
own gas a few notches. “There’s an
ugly twist there. Merciful Heaven ! If
she strikes the bend, like that, only one
thing can happen. She’ll shoot into
fifty feet of water.”

  “Unless she hits the stonework of the

bridge approach. Then-”

  “Shut up!” snapped Stanley. “We
can’t let her do it! We have five miles.
In that distance, we ought to be able to
help.”

  Karl did not reply. He knew how
quickly five miles can be covered in an
automobile.

  Stanley drove faster and faster. The
girl had nearly got to the next bend,
which was one of the awful “S” turns.
He saw that she was bending low over
her wheel, prepared to serpentine her
way around at full speed, if it could be
done.

  “The Lord send that she doesn’t meet
anything!-’ murmured Stanley, as he
put on more power. “What are we do-
ing, Karl?”

  “Fifty,” replied Karl, glancing at
the speedometer.

  “Fifty miles an hour! Well, we’ll
have to go up to sixty—perhaps more.”
Stanley Downs gritted his teeth,
forced his car up to sixty miles an
hour, and then reduced the speed to
thirty. They were approaching the
“S.”

  The girl was just running out of it.
her car rocking awfully as she reached
the straight.

  “Well, she’s out of that,” remarked
Stanley. “I was afraid she’d never do
it. By Jove, she’s some driver!”

  The Archim.edes, being under con-
trol, went through the “S” safely at
forty miles an hour. Then Stanley
Downs set himself to catch the other
car.

  He was not clear as to what he would
do if he did catch it. But he was re-
solved to do something. There was an-
other sharp bend ahead, close to the
broad lake, with its stone wall and many
boat landings. After that came an-
other twist, taking the road straight
upon the long bridge that crossed the
water.

  As the Fanchon whizzed around 011
two wheels, Stanley saw that the fair
driver was leaning far to one side, to
throw the weight of her body against
the inclination of the car to tip over.
She was game to the core. Stanley
Downs would have sworn to that.

  “Doesn’t seem scared!” shouted Karl,
above the roaring of the car, as it gath-
ered more speed.

  “Nerve of pure steel!” replied Stan-
ley, through his clenched teeth. “Karl!”
“Well ?”

  “Get ready to take this wheel—with-
out stopping the car.”

  “Great Scott! That’s going to be
some stunt,” declared Karl, but loosen-
ing himself up at the same time, ready
to obey. “What’s the idea?”

  “You see that we are getting to that
last twist in the road, the quarter mile?”
“Sure! All right! Ready to do it
now ?”

  “Just a moment. Wait till I get my
feet clear, so that I can swing out as
you go in behind the wheel. Get me?”
“Yes.”

  The two cars were not far apart now.
The girl was holding to the steering
wheel with a desperate grip, her feet
011 the pedals, trying to make the foot
brake hold. The emergency hand brake
had given out long ago, and the other
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

seemed to have hardly any power. But
she was fighting every inch to regain
control.

  By this time, a score of people, who
had been strolling along the high-ter-
raced walk above the roadway, which
overlooked the lake, were watching the
two great cars swirling down toward
the quarter-mile turn.

  They were accustomed to seeing cars
moving at a good speed, after safely
negotiating this difficult bend, but it
was unusual for machines to approach
it in this headlong fashion.

  At each of the bends was a gigantic
signboard, painted a terrifying red,
bearing the word ‘‘Danger!” in white
letters two feet long, and with the ad-
ditional caution, in rather smaller char-
acters : “Sharp curve ahead! Drive
slow!”

  There was hardly time for the spec-
tators to express their horror at the
catastrophe that seemed imminent,
when the two cars swept along side by
side.

  “Now!” shouted Stanley.

  He knew that he could depend on
Karl. That rather taciturn young man
had proved his courage and intelligence
on other occasions. It was his habit to
do what came his way without making
much fuss about it, and if the task men-
aced his safety, or even his life, why,
it was all in the day’s work.

  “Ready, sir!” replied Karl.

  “All right! Come !”

  Stanley slid along the seat from be-
hind the wheel, and immediately Karl
was in his place, recovering the slight
divergence of the car that had been
caused by the change of guiding hands.

  It was now that Stanley Downs had
a good view of the girl’s face.

  It could not be said that she was not
frightened. But certainly her appre-
hension had not interfered with the
masterly manner in which she managed
the steering wheel. She was staring
straight ahead of her, and, as she

whirled around the quarter-mile bend,
she endeavored to get the car headed
up the road.

  But there was another hairpin curve
—caiied so because the two roads ran
almost parallel, like the legs of a hair-
pin—and the car would have to swing
completely around, running in the op-
posite direction, if it were to avoid the
lake.

  “She can’t make it!” exclaimed Karl.

  Stanley Downs said nothing. Karl
had been obliged to let the Fan&hon
push a little ahead in rounding the
bend, to avoid a collision, and Stanley
was standing on the seat by the side of
the chauffeur, balancing himself peril-
ously on the leather cushion, with his
eyes fixed on the girl.

  He motioned with his arm to Karl
to draw closer to the other car.

  They were within a hundred yards of
the edge of the lake, and charging
straight toward it.

  As Karl brought the two cars within
a yard of each other, Stanley leaped
across the gap and into the front seat
of the Fanchon.

  What followed happened too quickly
to be described in detail.

  With a savage tug, he dragged the
girl away from the wheel, at the same
time kicking open the door. Then he
seized the wheel with both hands as he
stood by the side of it, and wrenched
it so hard that the car swerved until it
seemed as if it might run along the road
at the very edge of the water.

  The wrencl\ was not quite enough,
however. Its only effect was to pre-
vent its going straight into the lake.
Instead, it shot off diagonally, and with
the car went Stanley Downs and the
girl.

  The tremendous splash caused by the
diving in of the Fanchon was followed
instantly by another, as the Archi-
medes, with Karl at the wheel, plunged
off the stone wall, and, turning a com-
4

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

plete somersault, disappeared beneath
the surface.

  Only a number of bubbles in the
center of two rapidly spreading series
of rings, told the frantic people, who
had rushed to the edge of the lake, that
two cars, with three human beings, had
sunk there.

  Then the cap of the chauffeur, still
on his head, where it was fastened by
a chin strap, showed above the surface,
as Karl swam toward a wooden boat

    »•

landing.

  Where were the other two—Stanley
Downs and the girl?

  The question was soon answered.
Stanley and the girl came up together.

  There was a streak of red across the
forehead and cheek of the young man.
But the beautiful face that lay against
his shoulder was a dead white, and the
eyes were closed.

  Stanley Downs was pale himself, and
there was a dazed expression in his eyes
as he shook the water out of them and
looked about for the shore.

  In another moment he obtained a
grip on himself, and struck out for
the boat landing, where Karl was by
this time being helped out.

  It was with difficulty that Stanley
swam the short distance. He had re-
ceived a nasty knock as he broke away
from the car under water, and it had
weakened him. Moreover, he had the
weight of the girl he was bringing to
shore. She was unable to help herself.
All she could do was to lie prone on
his arm, her brown hair rippling over
the water, and one small gauntleted
hand resting on his shoulder and against
his cheek.

CHAPTER II.

Stanley's Mission.

I THINK I can walk,” were the first
words she spoke, as they were
dragged out of the water.

  “T don’t think you can,” returned

Stanley Downs positively. “I will
carry you.”

  He did so. There were half a dozen
stone steps from the wooden boat land-
ing to the top of the wall. From there,
it was a trip of some five hundred feet
to the veranda of the hotel, which faced
the broad lake and the magnificent vista
of mountain, where the verdure-clad
slopes were bursting into the fresh
green beauty of spring.

  Stanley had recovered most of his
strength by the time he was pulled from
the water. Besides, he rather liked the
task of carrying this dainty young
woman, whose independence of spirit
had manifested itself with the first
glimmer of returning consciousness.

  “Won’t you put me down, please?”
she asked, with a touch, of imperious-
ness.

  “Couldn’t do it,” answered Stanley,
as he hurried toward the veranda.
“You would fall.”

  “Nonsense! I’m not so weak as all
that. Where is my car?”

  “At the bottom of the lake, I guess.”
  “And yours?”

  “By its side—or perhaps underneath
or on top of yours. We all went in
together.”

  Her eyes—deep-violet eyes they were,
as Stanley Downs saw—were wide
open by this time, and it was clear that
her mind was working in orderly fash-
ion, no matter how distressed she might
be physically.

  “I am too heavy for you to carry,”
she persisted. “You are badly hurt.
There is a great cut in your forehead.
Put me down!”

  “You don’t weigh much.” he laughed.
“It steadies me to carry you. A hun-
dred pounds or so in my arms is what
I need to keep me balanced.”

  “I weigh a hundred and thirty!” she
burst out indignantly. “I may not be
very big, but I play tennis and I swim

as well as-”

  “And drive a six-cylinder Fanchon,”
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

threw in Stanley. ‘‘That keeps you in
good condition. Yes, I understand
that. But when a young lady is hurled
out of a car into a lake, and especially
when she has some little difficulty in
getting clear of the wreckage, she must
expect to feel a little shaken.”

  “You threw that door of the car open
just before we went over the wall”
she remarked with a smile. ‘‘That
showed you had not lost your head. But
for that I might not have got clear. I
wonder you thought of it—so quickly.”
"Quickness of thought was needed
at that stage of the proceedings if the
thought was to do any good. Well,
here we are at the veranda. I’ll carry
you up the steps, and then you will be
all right. Here is a lady who seems to
know you.”

  Stanley Downs put his burden down
gently on the broad veranda and drew
a large wicker chair to her. As he did
so. a middle-aged, motherly sort of
woman, in a light-blue morning gown,
came running up and took the girl's two
hands in hers.

  “Why, Miss Ranvelt! What is this?
Was it you that went crashing into the
lake? I heard that there had been an

accident, but I never supposed-"

  "Never supposed it was I, Mrs.
Somers?” laughed the girl. “\\ hy not ?
It was just as likely as to be anybody
else. I’m always racing around in a
motor car. ou know that. Dad says
I’ll get into a bad mess some time. It
seems as if I came near it this morn-
ing.”

  “Came near it ?” grunted Karl, who
had followed close behind Stanley.
“How much closer does she want to
come ?”

  Karl’s voice brought Stanley sharply
to a recollection of something of great
importance to himself that he had for-
gotten all about in the excitement—
even after he had found himself safe,
with the girl in his arms.

  He waved a farewell to the young

lady, who was being hurried away to
the housekeeper’s own rooms, for dry
clothes and general attention, and
turned to Karl:

  “The money?”

  "It went down with the car,” replied
Karl. “1 had no time to get at it, and
you were in the other car. It was in
the door pocket in front, with the latch
fastened. It ought to be there now.”

  “Yes, yes!” agreed Stanley nerv-
ously. "It ought. The door pocket is
not waterproof. But it will keep some
of the water away, perhaps. Anyhow,
it will keep it all in one.place. Then
there is a thick wrapping of brown pa-
per over it. That ought to help.”

  "Twenty thousand dollars, isn’t it?”
asked Karl.

  “Hush! No need to tell everybody,”
warned Stanley. “But that’s what there
is. A little more than twenty' thou-
sand.”

  “Hello, Stan!” broke in a cheery'
voice, as a brawny brown hand seized
Stanley’s. “What have you been doing
to yourself? You're soaking wet. By
George ! So is Karl! What in thunder
is it all about?”

  "Fell into the lake,” replied Stanley
briefly. “Where did you come from.
Clay?”

  "Adirondacks. Cold as the deuce up
there! Too early in the year; so I
just turned my gas wagon in this di-
rection, and I’m bound for New York.
It is the only place for civilized beings
in May.”

  Clay Varron was a member of the
Thracian Club—the athletic organiza-
tion in New York to which Stanley
Downs also belonged—and the two
young men were good friends. Their
mutual liking was based on respect, for
both were clean-living, bright young
fellows, who enjoyed athletic sports as
earned recreation, without making them
the principal business in life.

  Among other reasons for Clay Yar-
ron and Stanley Downs being good
6

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

comrades was that botli were ardent
motorists. Clay had done seventy
miles an hour on the road, and Stanley
Downs would have beaten that record,
in the opinion of the Thracian Club,
if he had not been dissuaded on the
ground that more than seventy miles an
hour away from a regular track would
be idiocy, rather than good sportsman-
ship.

  “Got any clothes with you?” asked
Stanley.

  “Plenty! I’ve engaged a room here
at the hotel. Come up to it until you
get one for yourself. Where’s my

man? Where the deuce- Oh, here

you are!” he added, as a trim-looking
fellow, with “body servant” written all
over him, stood at his employer’s el-
bow'. “What’s the number of my
room here at the Ridgeview, Moran?”

  “Forty-three, sir. Suite—bedroom,
sitting room, and bath. Baggage is
there already. Clothes laid out, too.”

  Clay Varron winked at Stanley
Downs, and grinned pleasantly.

  “I believe if 1 were in a shipwreck
at night in the middle of the Atlantic,
Moran would have my clothes laid out
in regular order, so that I could be
drowned properly dressed,” he said,
with a chuckle. “Well, there’s nothing
like doing your work right, whether you
are President of the United States or a
valet. Come on! We’ll get you out of
those wet rags in two minutes, once you
are in my room. Your chauffeur can
look out for himself, I suppose?”

  While Karl sought warmth and dry
clothes in another part of the great,
rambling hotel—finally bringing up
with a chauffeur he knew—Stanley
Downs went up to Clay Varron’s apart-
ments.

  Half an hour later, Stanley and Clay
sat at the window of the private sit-
ting room, which overlooked the lake
from the second story, while Stanley
told his story to Varron.

  "There’s not much to it, Clay. You

know Colonel Prentiss and some other
men are managing this big automobile
race for the Lawrence gold cup and a
purse of twenty thousand dollars?”
"Of course I know it. Isn't that one
of the reasons I’m hustling back to
New York? I want to hear what they
think of the race at the Thracian—first-
hand. It’s one week from to-day, isn’t
it ?”

  “Yes.”

  "And tickets are being taken up very
fast, I’m told. I want to get parking
space for two machines. Where’s the
best place to look for the tickets? I’m
told the new speedway will be a won-
der. One man told me that there will
be accommodation for nearly a hun-
dred thousand people to see the races.”
“Pretty nearly that,” admitted Stan-
ley. "You can get tickets in New York.
I’ll manage that for you.”

  “Why? Are you interested?” asked
Clay Varron, rather surprised.

  “Only as an official of the bank of
Bunvin & Son, in New York City. My
uncle, Richard Burwin, is the sole
owner of the bank, as I think you
know.”

  Varron nodded, and waved a hand
for Stanley Downs to continue.

  "Because he is the sole owner, he in-
sists on doing things in his own way.
Colonel Prentiss has been selling many
tickets in Buffalo, and he found him-
self with more cash than he wanted to
take care of. He is like my uncle in
the way of having notions, and he will
not do business with any bank except
Burwin & Son. That is why he would
not deposit any of his cash in banks at
Buffalo or elsewhere, as he might have
done.”

  “I see. Drive ahead, Stan! Get
down to cases!”

  “My uncle sent me to Buffalo to get
twenty thousand dollars that Colonel
Premiss wanted to deposit with us. I
was not allowed to use the railroads—
I didn’t want to, for that matter—but
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

7

was to go in my own car, with Karl,
who is my uncle’s own chauffeur, to
drive when I got tired, and to help me
guard the money.”

  “Swell idea!” observed Clay Varron.
"But I never knew the day when Stan-
ley Downs couldn’t take care of him-
self—and of anything he was told to
keep safely.”

  Stanley got up from his chair and
strode up and down the room. In a
suit of light clothes belonging to Clay
\ arron, which fitted him almost as well
as if they had been made for him, Stan-
ley was a fine-looking specimen of the
American man in his twenties.

  His erect carriage, firm jaw, quick
eye, and alert bearing were all those of
the young man who “does things.” Even
the troubled expression that drew his
brows together and made him bite his
lip impatiently, only seemed to accen-
tuate the firmness of his character.

  “Now I am in trouble, Varron,” he
said, after a short silence. “When my
car took a header into the lake, out

there-”

  “Great Scott! Was that what it
did?” interrupted Clay excitedly.

  “Yes. But that’s nothing in itself.”
declared Stanley hurriedly, waving
aside further ejaculations. “What
troubles me is that twenty thousand
dollars in bills, which were tied up in
a package and placed in one of the door
pockets of the car, went down with
it.”

  “Good heavens!”

  “I dare say the money is still in the
door pocket,” continued Stanley. “But
what use is that, when the car is at the
bottom of the lake? It is between fifty
and sixty feet deep, right off the edge
of the promenade in front of this
hotel.”

“So I’ve heard. But that isn’t deep
enough to lose your car for you. I see
they are working at it now. Look !'■’
Clay Varron pointed out of the win-
dow, and they saw that twenty or thirty

men were manipulating ropes that
dropped into the water. They were
pulling at them with a big motor truck
as well as several teams of horses. Evi-
dently the crowd had something at-
tached to the ropes under water, which
was giving the motor truck and horses
all the)- could do to drag it out.

  "That’s good !” exclaimed Stanley. “T
didn’t think they would get at it so
soon. Ah ! I see! Karl is out there
directing things. That young fellow is
a wonder, Clay. Let’s go out!”

  It was just as Clay Varron and Stan-
ley Downs reached the veranda that the
big Archimedes motor car was drawn
to the surface of the lake and thence
to the boat landing, which was almost
level with the top of the water.

  Stanley rushed down the steps and
laid his hand on the door pocket. It
was in full view as the car lay on its
side.

  The next moment he gave vent to a
groan of dismay.

  The door pocket was empty!

CHAPTER III.

An Enemy by Chance.

FRANTICALLY, Stanley Downs
searched all over the interior of
the big car. It did not seem to
be much damaged, although it was
soaked with water and showed mud
where it had struck the bottom of the
lake.

  There were no signs of the packet
of money. The door pocket seemed to
have been wrenched open, and it was
easy to imagine that the money might
have slipped out as the machine tum-
bled over.

  For a few moments Stanley could
hardly realize the full extent of his mis-
fortune. He soon made sure that the
package was not lying anywhere in the
car. Karl, too, searched carefully,
without result.

  “Get the car to the road as soon as
8

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

you can, Karl,” directed Stanley, forc-
ing himself to speak calmly. “Then
run it into the garage and overhaul it.
We shall probably go on to New York
to-day.”

  “Very well, sir.”

  "How about the other car, the Fan-
chon? Are they -going to get it up
without much trouble?”

  “I think so,” replied Karl. “But it
was underneath our car, and it may
take all day. I’m afraid there isn’t
much left of the Fanchon. Bits of it
are floating on the water. You can see
some of the wooden spokes of the
wheels, and one of the mud guards came
up on the grappling irons a while ago.”
“My poor car!” exclaimed a sweet
voice behind them. “You really think
it is done for, then?”

  “Why, Helen!” cried Clay Varron,
swinging around. “Were you driving
that Fanchon? What the deuce made
you do it ? I have often heard your fa-
ther tell you that you must never drive
a new car until he has tested it thor-
oughly himself.”

  “Well, I tested this one for him,”
laughed Helen Ranfelt. "I don’t think
he will have any more trouble with it.
If it had not been for this gentleman,”
smiling at Stanley, “he might not have
had any more trouble with his daughter,
either.”

  “It was a perilous proceeding all
around,” said Stanley. “But I am re-
lieved to see that it had 110 serious out-
come—except for the car. By the way,
Clay,” he went on, turning to Varron,
"perhaps you won’t mind vouching for
me as a respectable member of society

to Miss-”

  “What? Never been introduced?”
cried Clay, astonished. “Well, well!
This is Mr. Stanley Downs, of New
York—Miss Helen Ranfelt. You know
her father, L. K. Ranfelt—Stanley, by
name, at least. There is their home
up there on the mountain. You can

just see it through the foliage—that
white house, with the golden cupola.”
“Of course I have heard of Mr. Ran-
felt,” returned Stanley, when he had ac-
knowledged the introduction with a
bow, and had absorbed a most fascinat-
ing smile from the young lady. "Who

has not? His mines in Nevada-”

  “Oh, yes!” broke in Helen Ranfelt.
“That is always the way. Everybody
has heard that dad has made many mil-
lions out of his mines, and that they
are still producing. But hardly any one
knows that he would be a great man,
even if he had never got to be a mil-
lionaire. You ought to see him drive
a Fanchon, Mr. Downs—or any other
car! No fear of his driving into a lake.
He makes a car do just what he likes.
And it is the same with everything else
he does.”

  Clay Varron smiled approvingly.
“That’s so, Helen. He’s a mighty
smart man, and I’ll say it, even though
he is my uncle. By the way, now that
I’ve met you, I guess I’ll drive you home
—if you want to go. I haven’t seen
Uncle Larry for more than a year.”

  “I heard that you’ve lost something
from your car, Mr. Downs,” said
Helen. “Some money. Don’t you think
you can recover it?”

  “I’m afraid not,” was the doleful re-
ply. “The lake is fifty feet deep right
here, and much more as it approaches
the center. It was a bundle of bank
notes, wrapped up in paper. The water
would destroy them in a very short
time, and there is little chance of dredg-
ing up the fragments. No, I’m afraid it
is a dead loss.”

  “I am very sorry.”

  Her feminine tact told her it would
be better to say nothing more about it.
The square jaw of Stanley Downs, as
well as the fighting glint in his gray
eyes, suggested that he would deal with
the misfortune in his own way, and
that he would not ask for sympathy
from any one.

  “I shall have to communicate with
my uncle, Mr. Burwin, in New York,”
he remarked, after a short pause, dur-
ing which it struck him that lie should
make some acknowledgment of her ex-
pression of sorrow. "The money was
his. and I was taking it to our bank.”
"Burwin & Son, you know, Helen,”
interjected Varron.

  "I did think I would go directly to
New York,” continued Stanley. "But
I think I will call him up on 'long dis-
tance,’ and stay here till I find out
whether I can save any of the bills.”
“Nothing much can be done to-day,
I should say,” observed Varron. "You
will have to get dredging machinery
from somewhere—Poughkeepsie, prob-
ably'. That will take at least twenty-
four hours, by the time it is all set
up.”

  "Won’t you be my father’s guest for
to-night, Mr. Downs?” asked Helen.
"He will be pleased to see you. es-
pecially when he hears that you have
saved his daughter’s life. I am a great
deal of a nuisance to him. but he thinks
something of me, nevertheless.”

  “Well, I should say he does!” laughed
Clay Varron. “Helen makes him do
just what she wants. I don’t think any-
body else on earth could do that.”
The end of it all was that Stanley
Downs accepted Helen Ranfelt’s invi-
tation, and about six o’clock that even-
ing Clay Varron drove his big car un-
der the porte-cochere of Lawrence K.
Ranfelt’s castlelike mansion on a raoun-
taintop. to let Stanley jump down to
help out the young girl who had been
by his side during the ride up from the
lake, the glimmer of which could be
made out miles below.

  Karl had been instructed to watch
the attempts to get the package of bills
from the water, and to let Stanley know
by telephone if there should be any re-
sult. The stolid chauffeur could be de-
pended on. His faithfulness had been

proved in years of service, and his hon-
esty was beyond question.

  Under the influence of a good din-
ner and cheerful conversation, Stanley
was able to look upon his heavy loss
with a more hopeful eye afterward.

  Lawrence K. Ranfelt was a man of
fifty or thereabouts, with a jolly man-
ner, a clean-cut. shaven face, and grip
when he shook hands that conveyed sin-
cerity that won Stanley’s confidence at
once.

  What particularly pleased Stanley
Downs was that his host did not say
much about the part Stanley had taken
in saving his daughter from death. All
he did was to shake the young man’s
hand and whisper, after a ten minutes’
talk alone with his daughter:

  “Helen has told me, Mr. Downs. 1
thank you from the bottom of my heart.
That sounds stupidly inadequate, but I
mean it. She says that if you had not
dragged her from the car, down there
at the bottom of the lake, she must have
been drowned. You had opened the
door before the accident, so that she
could get out. That was something
everybody might not have thought of.
But even then she would have died if
it had not been for what you did after-
ward.”

  This was just before dinner, after
Stanley had put on evening clothes
from Clay Varron’s rather extensive
wardrobe, and when the men were in
the library, waiting for the call.

  “By the way, Mr. Downs, you have
not met Mr. Burnham—Victor Burn-
ham,” added Ranfelt, as a tall, lean
man, who might have been any age be-
tween thirty and fifty, but who really
was thirty-five, slipped into the library.
“Burnham has been associated with tne
in the West for years. lie was my su-
perintendent when I made my first good
strike, and he is still looking out for the
Ranfelt interests in the West. But he
is not a mere superintendent now. His
holdings in Nevada mines have made
10

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

him a millionaire several times over.
At least, that’s what people say. Eh,
Burnham ?”

  Victor Burnham shrugged his shoul-
ders deprecatingly, as he shook hands
with Stanley in a rather grudging
fashion.

  "People say many things that would
be better unsaid!” he growled. '“My
private affairs are my own.”

  Lawrence K. Ranfelt turned away,
with a careless laugh. He knew the
saturnine disposition of his old-time as-
sistant, and never took notice of his
surly manner. But Stanley Downs de-
cided, in his own mind, that he didn’t
like Victor Burnham.

  They went in to dinner now, and
Stanley was seated by the side of
Helen. Not only that, but the young
lady gave him as much of her atten-
tion and conversation as she could,
without being actually discourteous to
the other guests. Two handsome girls,
her classmates at Vassar, were in the
dinner party.

  It was evident that Stanley had made
a good impression 011 Miss Ranfelt. He,
on his part, thoroughly enjoyed him-
self. He could flirt with a pretty girl
as well as the next one, and Helen Ran-
felt was undeniably extremely pretty.

  “What’s the matter with that fel-
low?” thought Stanley once, when he
happened to look across the table and
found Burnham glowering at him.
“Wonder if I’ve given offense to Mr.
Burnham ?”

  The truth was that he had given of-
fense. Victor Burnham had gone so
far as to tell L. K. Ranfelt that he
would like to marry his daughter. The
mine owner’s reply was that he could
not interfere with her desires in the
way of matrimony. If Helen wanted
to marry Burnham, why, he would con-
sider it, then. For the present, he had
nothing to say.

  ■‘You give me permission to try for
her, then?” Burnham had said.

  “Sure! Go in and win—if you can.
I can trust Helen to act according to
her conscience.”

  This conversation had taken place on
this very afternoon, and Burnham had
been trying to make up his mind when
he would speak to Helen. Now in came
this young man from New York, who
had the advantage of having rescued
her from death, and it was evident that
the girl had eyes for nobody else. Burn-
ham felt that he had good reason for
glowering at Stanley Downs.

  It was after dinner, when the four
men were in the billiard room, enjoy-
ing cigars and cigarettes before join-
ing the ladies in the drawing-room, that
the subject of the big motor race came
up.

  “I am interested in it,”- remarked
Ranfelt casually. “I have a few thou-
sand dollars invested, and I certainly
mean to see it pulled off. Colonel
Frank Prentiss is an old friend of mine,
and I have no doubt he will make it
a success. I wish I could drive in the
race. It would be an easy way of pick-
ing up twenty thousand dollars, to say
nothing of the cup, which is said to be
worth a thousand or so.”

 “The Lawrence Cup,” murmured
Stanley Downs thoughtfully. “By the
way, Mr. Ranfelt, who is offering the
cup? Do you know?”

  Lawrence K. Ranfelt brushed the
question aside, with a careless wave of
the hand, as he let a column of cigar
smoke issue from his lips.

  “What does it matter who offers it?”
he demanded, with a flush rather deeper
than his usual color on his cheeks, while
his keen eyes danced with amusement.
“It will not belong to anybody until it
has been won for three years in suc-
cession, on the Prentiss Speedway.
Burnham, here, thinks he can carry it
off for the first time.”

  “I’ll try,” growled Burnham. “As
for the person who offers it, I don’t
see any use in making a mystery of
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

11

that. It will all come out later. Tt is
Mr. Ranfelt who is giving it. He uses
his first name, Lawrence, instead of
his surname—that’s all.”

  Lawrence K. Ranfelt burst out into
his jolly laugh, as he slapped Burnham
on the shoulder.

  “Yes, that’s true,” he admitted. ‘‘But
there is something else, much more in-
teresting than the fact that I have hung
up the cup for competition. That is
that Helen has publicly announced—at
home, of course—that she will think
the man who wins this cup the greatest
hero she knows.”

  "Indeed?” asked Stanley, laughing.
“That is enough to make anybody want
to be entered in the race. The twenty
thousand dollars would be nothing in
comparison.”

  “Well, I don’t know.” declared Ran-
felt, more soberly. “That’s a good sum
of money. I have nothing to do with
the purse, however. The Speedway
Association, through Colonel Frank
Prentiss, is offering that. And the best
of the purse is that it belongs, out and
out, to the man who wins it. He won’t
have to go on driving in other races,
year after year, as he will to become the
permanent holder of the cup.”

  Stanley Downs did not reply. But he
was thoughtful, and when he reached
the drawing-room with the others, he
had so little to say that Helen Ranfelt,
obviously piqued, was especially gra-
cious to Victor Burnham, and hardly
noticed Stanley at all.

  “I believe I’ll do it!” was what Stan-
ley kept on repeating to himself.

  He was saying it mentally when he
reached his bedroom a few hours later,
and gazed out of the window at the long
winding road down the mountain.

  "Seventy miles was Clay Varron’s
record in a Kronite car, on that very
road below, there,” he mused. “Sev-
enty miles an hour on an ordinary road,
with all the possibilities of loose stones,
holes, and other cars meeting him.

What could a man do in a good car on
the Prentiss Speedway? The record at
Sheepshead Bay is more than a hundred
and two for three hundred and fifty
miles.” He sighed dubiously. “That’s
some traveling, keeping it up for more
than three hours.”

  Stanley Downs went to bed.

CHAPTER IV.
A Way Out.

I’M sorry nothing has been found of
your money, Mr. Downs. But, to
be frank, 1 don't see how they could
get it for you. Paper money was never
meant to be soaked in water and used
afterward. The twenty thousand dol-
lars belonged to the bank, I under-
stand?”

  It was Lawrence K. Ranfelt talking,
after breakfast, the next morning. He
and Stanley, both early risers, sat on
the veranda and gazed across at the
fresh verdure of the hills and the slowly
rising mist from the great hollows.
They were alone. Mr. Ran felt’s man-
ner was very serious.

  “The money had been Colonel Pren-
tiss’,” answered Stanley: “But, of
course, when it came into my hands, as
a representative of Burwin & Son’s
banks, we were responsible for its
safety. The loss will fall on the bank.”
“I suppose Burwin & Son can stand
it?”

  “Naturally. But that is not the point.
My uncle, Richard Burwin, does not
believe in mistakes—or accidents. He
holds that the first always imply negli-
gence, and that accidents never hap-
pen when proper care is taken.”

  “I don’t agree with your uncle,”
snapped Ranfelt. “It was not your
fault that you fell into the lake yester-
day. If you hadn’t been trying to keep
that harum-scarum girl of mine out of
mischief, you would never have got into
trouble. However, we won’t talx about
that What about your uncle?”
12

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

  "Only that T feel as if I cannot tell
him I have lost twenty thousand dol-
lars of the bank’s money.”

  “H’m! What are you going to do
about it?”

  “I won’t do anything for a few days,
except to wire my uncle I will not be
in New York just yet. He will know I
have some reason for delay.”

  “Won’t think you’ve lost the money ?”
Stanley Downs winced at this blunt
suggestion.

  “It will never occur to him. Besides,
I may find it before I have to tell him
anything about it. I have not given up
hope yet. The men are still dredging
the lake.”

  “I am afraid there is little chance of
your getting the twenty thousand dol-
lars if you depend on its being fished
out of the lake,” declared Lawrence
Ranfelt, shaking his head.

  “I think that, too,” was Stanley’s un-
expected outburst. “I am not depend-
ing on that. In this big motor race at
the Prentiss Speedway, the money
prizes go to the drivers, while the cup
will be awarded to the car. I have been
asked to drive a Thunderbolt car in
this race, and have been considering it
for several days. This decides me. I
will drive in the race.”

  He got up, as he said this, stretching
his arms and expanding his chest, as if
glad to have come to a conclusion on a
perplexing matter.

  ‘•What’s that?” almost shouted Ran-
felt. “Do you really mean it?”
“Indeed I do! Why not? I can
drive, and I want the money.”

  “But entering the race does not in-
sure the money for you,” the million-
aire reminded him.

  “Nothing is sure in sport, any more
than in other things,” answered Stan-
ley. “But if I don’t enter, I shall not
have even a fighting chance. That is
what I want—a fighting chance at win-
ning twenty thousand dollars.”

  “Fine!” exclaimed L. K. Ranfelt, as

he took Stanley’s hand. “I am glad to
hear you say this. It is the way to deal
with a difficult situation. I wish you
luck. Although,” he added slowly, “per-
haps I ought not to wish you that, if
I am to be consistent.”

  “Why not?” asked Stanley in some
surprise.

  “Because Victor Burnham is going
to drive in the race, with a Columbiad,”
replied Ranfelt. “It is not generally
known, but I knew it. Burnham drove
his trial two-mile dash two or three day's
ago, qualifying as an entrant. He did
the two miles in a minute and a third
—rather less. That gave him something
to spare. If you are going to drive,
you haven’t much time. I’d advise
you to get to the track and try out
your car right away. You were there
yesterday', I understand.”

  “Yes. I meant to take the money to
the bank in New York, and then go
right back. I promised to give the
Thunderbolt owners my decision by
telegraph to-day. Can I telephone to
the telegraph office from here?”

  “Come into my private office. I have
a phone there.”

  It took nearly' ten minutes to get the
telegraph office, fifteen miles away, and
then Stanley Downs had to repeat his
message twice before the operator could
catch it and repeat it back for verifi-_
cation.

  “Yes. That’s right,” called out Stan-
ley Downs at last. “Moussard Automo-
bile Co., Buffalo. Will drive your
Thunderbolt car in Lawrence Cup Race
next Thursday. Coming to Buffalo to-
morrow for trial. Stanley Downs.’
Get that?”

  There was a pause, and Stanley
Downs turned from the table, with a
smile, as he hung up the transmitter.
When he swung around, he found him-
self facing Helen Ranfelt, who was
panting with excitement, and Victor
Burnham, who scowled.
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

13

  "Oh, Mr. Downs, isn’t that splen-
did?” cried Helen. •

  “I don’t know that it is,” said Stan-
ley, laughing. "Except to me. I like
driving fast, and, from all I can judge,
there will be some rapid moving at the
Prentiss Speedway next Thursday.”
"You have to go not less than eighty-
five miles an hour to qualify,” grunted
Burnham. "I suppose you know that?”
“I have studied the conditions of the
race so often that I think I am familiar
with them all,” replied Stanley, as he
turned away.

  Helen Ranfelt followed him out to
the veranda and took his arm.

  "Mr. Downs,” she whispered, and he
noted a tremble in her soft tones.
“Yes?”

  “Victor Burnham is a dangerous man.
He has been annoying me for some
time, although I never let dad know. If
I had, there would have been a dread-
ful scene, Pin sure, because dad never
can control his temper. Now he is get-
ting worse. He came to me this morn-
ing, as soon as I was downstairs, tell-
ing me he had something important to
say.”

  “Yes?”

  “I could only tell him to say it, for I
have never told him he must not speak
to me—although I should like to do so.”

  “But if he annoys you-” began

Stanley.

  “I am afraid you don’t understand.
Dad thinks he is a good business man
—and I suppose he is. Besides, dad
says he is not a bad fellow at heart.
That’s the way he expresses it. Only
he is a little gruff. Dad says some of
the finest men alive are like that.”
Stanley nodded, without speaking.
He had seen enough of the good-na-
tured, easy-going Lawrence Ranfelt to
understand that the mine owner would
make excuses for anybody, so long as
a fair outside was presented.

  “Victor Burnham has asked my fa-
ther if he may ask me to marry him.

He says dad told him to go ahead. If
I don’t believe what he says. I can ask
my father. That’s what Mr. Burnham
told me to-day.”

  “The cad!”

  “He also said this morning that he
had been told that I would make a hero
of the man who won this motor race."

  "That was true, wasn’t it?” queried
Stanley, with a smile. “Your father
told us that last night. But I under-
stood you had said it only in a playful
way, so that no decent man would take
it otherwise.”

  "I believe I did say so—and. indeed.
I think it wonderfully brave for any
man to dash around a track at such an
awful speed. You see. I know some-
thing about fast driving, I often go
along the road, myself, at a mile a min-
ute. Hut the worst of it all is that Vic-
tor Burnham pretends to believe that
what I said about regarding a man as
a 'hero’ means that I will say 'yes,’ if
he asks me to marry him."

  “You mean if he wins the race?”
“Yes. Hut I’m afraid lie will. You
know that he is to drive a Columbiad
car, and that thai car is regarded as the
most powerful and speediest machine
that ever has been produced. Every-
body is afraid of it.”

  “I have heard that it is a good ma-
chine,” admitted Stanley. “But until it
has been tried out in a real competition
with the best cars that can be brought
against it, that is only talk. No one
knows for certain what the Columbiad
can do, because it is a French machine,
and has never been seen in action in
America, except at the trial, a few days
ago."

  “That was when Mr. Burnham quali-
fied as a driver, wasn’t it?”

  “Yes. He did his two miles in one
minute and twenty seconds. Pretty
good going. But I believe 1 can beat
that in the Thunderbolt.”

  “I am so glad you are going to drive,
Mr. Downs. 1 happened to hear what
14

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

you were saying over the telephone just
now, and I hope you will win.”
“Thanks!”

  “Oh, it isn’t only because I want you
to be successful,” she confessed, with
the candor that she inherited from her
plainspoken father. “I want you to
beat Mr. Burnham.”

  “And all the others in the race, too,
eh?” he rejoined, with a humorous
curling of the lip. “He won’t be the
only other driver, you know, Miss Ran-
felt.”

  “He will be your chief competitor, I
am afraid. If you beat him, you will
win. I feel sure of that.”

  “Possibly,” assented Stanley Downs
thoughtfully. “It is said this Colum-
biad is a terror. I suppose Burnham
is a good driver?”

  “One of the best in the country, dad
says. He’s cool, strong, and he has 110
nerves. Dad has told me of the way
he held his own against some of the
rough men at the mines in days gone
by. It is because he is so brave and
powerful that dad likes him, I think.”
“Well, I’ll try to beat him,” smiled
Stanley.

  “You must do it!” she whispered
tensely. “If he should win this race I
would be afraid of him. He would

come to me, and—and-”

  “Marry you by force? Hardly that,
I think. We don’t do that kind of
thing nowadays. Besides, your father
can take care of you. Why should you
fear this fellow?”

  “I don’t know why I should, but I
do,” she confessed. “He has a way of
carrying things before him in a savage
way that gets him what he wants. If
you beat him, he will not have an ex-
cuse to annoy me.”

  Stanley was rather astonished that
this plucky young girl should show so
much terror. He had seen her driving
her big car down the winding road,
showing no actual fear, even when it
was inevitable that she should plunge

into the lake. Yet now, as she talked
of this Victor Burnham, she trembled
so that she could hardly stand, and her
voice quivered pitifully.

  “I’ll take care of Mr. Burnham, both
on the track and elsewhere, if it should
be necessary,” Stanley assured her.

  Hardly were the words out of his
mouth, when a footstep close by made
him turn. He looked straight into the
malevolent eyes of the man he had been
talking about.

  For a moment the two gazed at each
other defiantly. Then, without speak-
ing, Victor Burnham turned on his heel
and went into the house.

  “He heard you, I am afraid!” mur-
mured the girl.

  “Just as well, if he did,” replied
Stanley, with a smile. “He will know
what to expect if he doesn’t behave him-
self.”

  “Hello, Stan!” broke in the cheery
tones of Clay Varron. “I’ve just heard
the news.”

  “What?” cried Stanley, half hoping
that the news might be good for him.
“They haven’t found the money in the
lake, have they?”

  “No, old man! I wish it was that.
What I meant was that I’m pleased you
are going to be in that race. Mr. Ran-
felt and I are going to Buffalo with
you. We want to see you do your trial.
You don’t mind, do you?”

  “Mind?” ejaculated Stanley. “It is
the very thing I should have suggested,
if I had thought you and Mr. Ranfelt
would consent.”

  “And I’m going, too,” put in Helen
decidedly.

  “So will I, if I may be permitted,”
added the surly voice of Victor Burn-
ham, as he stepped forward. “I’m told
the Thunderbolt racer the company has
ready is. quite a traveler. I should like
to see how you will handle it.”

  “I will drive you over in my car,
Stan, if you like,” said Clay, ignoring
Burnham. “Mr. Ranfelt says he will
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

15

go in his own car, and I suppose he
will take Helen with him.”

  Nobody asked Victor Burnham how
he intended to go. But Helen knew he
had come from Buffalo in his own car,
and, of course, he could go the same
way.

  ‘'Will you take me with you, Ran-
felt ?” he asked, as the mine owner
stepped out to the veranda.

  Helen managed to catch her father’s
eye, and he gave Burnham a prompt
negative.

  “All right, Ranfelt. I can drive my
own car,” he said, with an evil grin.
“It will be a little lonely for me, but
we can all go together, even if we are
in separate cars.”

  “The blackguard!” thought Stanley
Downs. “I feel as if he and I would
come to grips some time—and not on
the speedway only.”

CHAPTER V.

For a Sure Thing.

IT was two days later when Victor
Burnham, with a raincoat covering
his ordinary raiment, and a peaked
cap pulled well down over his brows,
stood behind a big racing car in a ga-
rage in a back street in Buffalo. With
him was a man whose oily overalls and
blackened hands proclaimed him a ga-
rage employee.

  “Now, Dan,” whispered Burnham, as
he glanced about to make sure they
could not be overheard. “You under-
stand that if I win this race you get a
clear thousand dollars.”

  “When do I get it?” inquired Dan
coldly. “I want it as soon as you run
your car off the track.”

  “Dan Saltus, you’re just as suspi-
cious now as you ever were,” said
Burnham, grinning in a mirthless way.
“When you were engineer for me, out
in Nevada, I knew that you did not
trust anybody—not even your best
friend.”

  “Best friend, eh?” snorted Mr. Sal-
tus, passing a grimy hand across his al-
most as grimy face. “Meaning your-
self, I suppose?”

  “Meaning myself,” assented Burn-
ham. "I was your best friend, and I
am now. You would not have this
nice little job as foreman of this
garage if I hadn’t got it for you.”
“That’s right. Although I don’t
know that it is such a nice little job, at
that. The men I have around me are
all dubs, and if I want anything done
right I have to get at it myself. But,
never mind that. Drive ahead with
what you were going to say.”

  Victor Burnham stepped to the door
of the garage and looked up and down
the short street. It was between six
and seven o’clock in the evening, after
general business hours, and no one was
about. The garage itself was empty
but for Burnham and Dan Saltus, the
foreman.

  “What I was going to say,” resumed
Burnham, as he stepped again to the
back of the racing car, “is that I have
to win this Lawrence Cup.”

  “That’s what they'll all say,” grunted
Dan. “I mean, all the drivers.”
"Possibly. But it’s real business with
me. I’v'e got'-to win !’

  “You’ll take a sporting chance, I sup-
pose ?”

  “No!’ snarled Burnham. “I won’t—•
if I can help it. This lias to be a sure
thing for me. Chance won’t do.”

  Dan Saltus took up some cotton
waste and wiped away a streak of black
oil he had just observed on one of the
brake rods of the gray racer. It en-
abled him to avoid a response.

  "This car is better than anything to
be driven in that race—except one.”
“The Thunderbolt?”

  “Yes.”

  “I see. But what are you going to
do about it?”

  Victor Burnham glanced furtively
about him. Then he moved close to
16

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

the grimy mechanic, still busy with his
waste, and whispered in his ear:

  “What can you do about it?”

  “I don’t get you.”

  “Oh, yes, you do,” insisted Burn-
ham. “But you don’t want to admit
it. You’re not a bonehead exactly.”
“Thanks! But you’ll have to come
across more plainly than this if you
want a straight answer from me,” de-
clared Dan doggedly.

  “Very well. I will.”

  There was utter silence for perhaps
a quarter of a minute. Victor Burn-
ham hardly knew how to frame in
words what he wanted to say. Like
most men of his type, he was always
fearful of placing himself in the power
of anybody.

  “Of course, Dan, I know you are
straight with me. I’m not afraid of
your giving any of this conversation
away. Even if you did, it would not
make any difference. No one would
believe you.”

  “No one would have to,” retorted
Dan. “I don’t talk about my private
business. And this is plumb private.
Go on, Mr. Burnham. You are so leery
of what you say, that anybody would
think you’re planning a murder. What’s
it all about?”

  “If that Thunderbolt had some little
thing the matter with it, so that it did
not yield all the power it has generally
been able to deliver, or so that it would
gradually give out—without danger to

the driver, of course-”

  “Nothing like that could happen with-
out danger to the driver,” threw in Dan.
“When a car is going ninety or a hun-
dred miles an hour, or even fifty, there
is a chance of the driver’s neck being
broken if anything slips. You know
that, Mr. Burnham.”

  “It does not always follow,” insisted
Burnham, “especially when it is only
some little thing. In every big race a
lot of cars draw out before the finish
with some small thing the matter.”

  “What, for instance?” growled Dan.
“A flaw in a connecting rod, engine
trouble of some kind, carburetor not
working just right—any one of a dozen
things. I leave it to you what to do.
But I want the Thunderbolt to come in
behind the Columbiad I drive.”

  “Why can’t you drive on the level?”
demanded Dan sulkily. “You have a
car here that can walk away from any
of them. I know. I’ve driven it my-
self, and I saw you in the. trial. Why,
you did your ninety miles and over—
that is, an average of that—in your
trial, and you had any amount of power
that you didn’t call 011. Why don’t you
go into the race and trust to your ma-
chine? That’s what I’d do.”

  Victor Burnham ripped out an oath
in a low tone that made up in foulness
what it lacked in volume.

  “I’m not asking what you’d do,” he
rasped. “I want you to do this thing
for me, and I’ll pay you for doing it.”
“Y'ou will give me the thousand you
promised if you win the race? I agreed
to take that, but it was only for seeing
that the machine was in perfect condi-
tion. I didn’t bargain for any real
crooked work for that money,” growled
Dan.

  “It was understood.”

“No, it wasn’t. If you want anything
more than straight goods from me,
you’ve got to hand over something more
than a thousand—a great deal more.”
“I’ll give you another thousand.”
“Making two thousand altogether?”
“Yes.”

  “I’ll do what you want me to. But
—wait a moment. One thousand will
have to be paid, whether you win or
not. I’m not taking all the chances.
Suppose I get at the Thunderbolt, and
I’m seen. Where would I come in ? It
might take a thousand dollars for a
lawyer to clear me. I’ve got to have a
thousand before I’ll take the contract.
You know I’m square. I won’t take
your money and not do the job.”

  Victor Burnham reflected with deeply
contracted brows, and as he did so, any
casual observer would have said that
he was the very incarnation of evil. In-
deed, he might have been plotting mur-
der, as Dan Saltus had intimated, so
far as could be told from the expression
of his dark face.

  “Here’s the thousand, Dan,” he said
at last, drawing a wallet from an inside
pocket. “Do you promise to get at the
Thunderbolt?”

  “For a thousand dollars—yes,” re-
plied Dan, holding out his hand for the
money.

  Without speaking, Victor Burnham
opened the wallet and counted ten hun-
dred-dollar bills into the garage fore-
man’s hand.

  “I'd rather have had it in smaller
bills,” grumbled Dan. “It isn’t so easy'
to get a century changed without people
wondering where you got it. But I
dare say I can get away with it.”

  He rolled the money into a small
package and put it in a pocket under
his overalls, looking at the racing car
before him as he did so.

  “This Columbiad is in good shape, I
suppose, Dan. Nothing hurt it in the
trial ?”

  “Not a thing. I have been over it
carefully, and taken a long time to do
it. She’s ready for the race this min-
ute, if you wanted to take her out.
I’ll be your mechanician, of course—as
I was in the trial—and I’ll know that
she’s tuned up to concert pitch when we
line up. I’ve got plenty of gas in her.
But I’ll draw it all out and put in fresh
gas before the race, of course. I’ve got
the very best grade of gasoline on the
market, and I’ve strained it three times
already, to make sure she’s clean.”
Victor Burnham nodded perfuncto-
rily at all this. He knew Dan Saltus
would look after all details. Gasoline,
water, oil, and every part of the ugly
gray machine, with its great white fig-
ure 7 painted on it in several places,
^2A

would be exactly right. That was not
what he had to think about.

  What troubled him was that the
Thunderbolt—a wonderful racer that
never had been beaten by an American
car so far—would also be in perfect
condition. With everything else equal,
he feared that Stanley Downs could
push ahead of the Columbiad.

  “I don’t know that he could do it,”
muttered Burnham, half aloud. “But
he might. That’s what has to be pre-
vented.”

  “I’ll prevent it all right,” declared
Dan, who had overheard. “Do you
want to look her over any more? If
you don’t, I’ll take her to the storeroom
and lock her in.”

  “I’ve seen enough of her,” replied
Burnham. “Take her up.”

  Dan Saltus dropped into the low
driver’s seat—with its comfortable
cushions, which gave just room for the
mechanician to sit by the side of the
driver—and skillfully guided the car
upon a flat platform elevator a few
yards away.

  “The smoothness with which the
powerful machine rolled along the con-
crete floor, so slowly that it appeared
hardly to be moving, proved that it was
a perfect bit of mechanism. One could
hardly realize that its gaunt, rakish
frame held the potency of a hundred
miles an hour and more. It just crawled
now—no more.

  Victor Burnham waited patiently un-
til Dan Saltus had taken the car to an
upper floor, where it would be locked
up in an iron fireproof room by itself.
When the foreman came down again,
Burnham remarked that the trial of the
Thunderbolt was to take place at the
speedway at ten the next morning.

  “I know it,” replied Dan.

  “You’ll be there?”

  “I guess so. The boss here doesn’t
like me to be away too much, for we
are pretty busy. But I can trust my
assistant for that length of time. We
18

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

have some good men working for us,
too. That’s one comfort. But you
don’t want me to do any work on the
Thunderbolt to-morrow, do you?” he
added, with the ghost of a grin.

  “No,” growled Burnham. “So long
as you are on the job when the race
comes off, I don’t ask anything more.
But I want you to see this Thunderbolt
in real action at the trial. It may give
you some ideas as to how you are to
fix it afterward. Good night, Dan.”
He walked out of the garage without
looking back. Outside, he lighted a
cigar, which he puffed contentedly as
he went along.

  “The coldest proposition I ever went
up against,” reflected Dan Saltus, aloud,
looking after the departing Burnham.
“By gravy, I believe he’d rather have
that young fellow Downs killed than
not. If Burnham knew I was on to his
game to the very bottom, he’d be sur-
prised, I reckon. He thinks / think all
he cares about is to win this race just
for the sake of the glory and my thou-
sand dollars. Strange how things come
about. If it hadn’t been that Hank
Swartz is a friend of mine, I’d never
have got on to it all. As it is, I reckon

that- Hello, Hank! Where did

you blow in from?”

  A wide-shouldered, lean-faced man,
with the deep tan on his face that told
of outdoor life in the open country—
for he could not have got so brown
anywhere else—strolled into the garage
and coolly appropriated the one wooden
chair in sight, which was usually occu-
pied by the foreman when he had noth-
ing else to do.

CHAPTER VI.
The Heart of the Plot.

I HAVE been attending to affairs for
Burnham,” replied Hank Swartz,
when he was comfortably settled in
his chair. “I wish I could smoke in
here.”

  “Well, you can’t,” snapped Dan.
“You know that as well as I do. This
is a garage.”

  “All right. I just dropped in to see
how the Columbiad looked? Where
is she?”

  “She’s put away upstairs, in her own
little flat,” answered Dan, with his usual
surly grin. “We are not showing her
to everybody until the day of the race.
Then some of them may see her a little
too much. She’s going to win that cup
and the purse, Hank.”

  “Of course she is. She must.
There’ll be a neat little sum in side bets,
too. Gee! I reckon Vic Burnham will
clean up about fifty thousand. Well, he
needs it.”

  This time Dan Saltus allowed him-
self to chuckle outright.

  “He sure does. He’s so near broke
that if he was to get a hard shove he
would tumble clear over into bank-
ruptcy. But he’s a great bluffer. If he
can get that girl of Ranfelt’s he’ll be
all right. But the other string he has
out, on old man Burwin, of Burwin &
Son’s bank, is a good one, too.”

  “And yet that deal depends rather
on this race for the Lawrence cup, just
as his winning Helen Ranfelt does,”
remarked Hank Swartz wisely.

  “How? I don’t quite get that,” re-
sponded Dan Saltus.

  "Well, you know that Burnham
wants to get old Dick Burwin to open
a branch bank out in Carson City, and
appoint Burnham the president?”
“Sure! I’m wise to that.”

  “Well, Burnham has been bluffing the
old man that he can put a hundred
thousand plunks into the capital of the
new bank. That would give an excuse
for making him president. Old Burwin
likes the scheme, according to Burnham.
But Burnham has always been afraid
that when it was sprung on Burwin’s
nephew, this Stanley Downs, the beans
would all be spilled.”

  “1 reckon that’s so,” agreed Dan
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

19

thoughtfully. ‘‘This Downs is one
smart guy. They say his uncle relies
011 his judgment in 'most everything he
does.”

  “That’s what,” was Swartz’s re-
sponse. “So it’s up to Burnham to keep
it away from Stanley Downs—which
he has done up to date—or to queer
Downs so badly with his uncle that any-
thing lie says won’t count. Pretty slick
plan, eh, Dan ?”

  The two men chuckled in concert.
Obviously they were both in a plot that
appealed to their peculiar temperament,
and which it gave them pleasure to
discuss at their leisure.

  “I hear Stanley Downs has lost
twenty thousand dollars belonging to
the bank,” remarked Dan, after a short
pause.

  “Oh, you heard that, eh? Where did
you get it?”

  “Oh, come off, Hank! What am I
011 earth for? To walk around with
plugs in my ears and blinders on? I
can tell you something more about that.
Downs is keeping it from his uncle that
he’s shy the twenty thousand, and he
hopes to get it from this cup race. Isn’t
that right?”

  “You are not far off, Dan,” admitted
Swartz.

  “You bet I’m not. Well, he isn’t
going to get that twenty thousand, be-
cause Burnham, with his Columbiad
upstairs, will rush over the finish line
while Stanley Downs and his Thunder-
bolt will be a hundred miles behind,
wondering why he ever entered.”

  “You'll get some of the purse, eh,
Dan?”

  “I’ll be the mechanician. Of course
I'll get some. You don’t think I’m
going to take chances of being all
broken up for nothing.”

  “But won’t you get more than your
mechanician’s percentage?” persisted
Swartz.

  Dan Saltus had been leaning against
the doorpost, where he could look up

and down the street while conversing
with Swartz. He swung around ab-
ruptly at the last remark, and there was
an expression of anger as well as fear
in his eyres.

  “What do you mean by that, Hank ?
Who said I’d get more than my reg-
ular bit as a mechanician? Why
should I?”

  “I don’t know. I only asked,” re-
plied Hank Swartz coolly. “I’m get-
ting paid by Burnham for certain work
I’m doing for him. I wouldn’t tell
everybody, but I’m not trying to hide
it from you. I thought you might
loosen up a little to me—that’s all.
We’re old pards. We’ve rode, worked,
and bunked together out in the West,
both in the cattle country and the mines.
But if you want to forget all that, why,
it goes with me, too.”

  There was so much sadness in the
way this was said that Dan Saltus felt
obliged to respond. He held out his
hand to the other.

  “I didn’t mean nothing, Hank,” he
protested. “Only it ain’t well to talk
too much. I'll only tell you this much,
and you can guess the rest if you have
a mind to: Victor Burnham is going
to win this race with the Columbiad.”

  “I see,” replied Swartz. “I’m glad
to hear it. That will make things all
O. K. for me at my end of it.”

  “How ?”

  “If Burnham wins the race, it will
put Stanley Downs in the wrong with
his uncle. He’ll be twenty thousand
dollars shy, for one thing, and he’ll fall
down in a game that he’s supposed to
know all the way through from soup
to nuts.”

  “Then there’s Ranfelt’s girl!” sug-
gested Dan.

  “Yes. Not that Stanley Downs wants
her. He never met her till yesterday,
when he played into our hands by div- ■
ing into the lake with her and her
Fanchon,” laughed Hank. “But Vic
Burnham is crazy for her.”
20

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

  “What are you handing me, Hank?”
demanded Saltus, with an incredulous
chuckle. “I never knew Vic Burnham
to be crazy over any girl. He wants her
dad’s money. That’s all.”

  “Well, isn’t it all the same?” rejoined
Swartz. "He wants her, and he’ll stand
a fair show of getting her if he pulls off
this race. I’m mighty glad you and he
have it framed up to get it for him.”
“There you go again, Hank!" com-
plained Dan Saltus. “Who has any-
thing ‘framed up’? It’s going to be a
straight contest, with the best car and
driver winning. You know that, don't
you ?”

  "Of course I do. You needn’t fly
off the handle just because we are hav-
ing a little friendly talk. I’m going
around to look at the Thunderbolt, if I
can. It’s in the Moussard garage.
They are not letting strangers look her
over, of course. But I know the boys
there, and I reckon I can get in to see
what she looks like at close range.”
Hank Swartz strolled out. after a
friendly “So long!” to Dan, and walked
across that part of the city for about a
quarter of a mile before he stopped in
front of another garage, which was
enough like the one where he had left
Dan Saltus to be mistaken for it, if it
had been next door.

  It was in an upstairs warehouse that
Swartz found several persons standing
around the racer that Stanley Downs
was to drive in the trial for two miles
on the morrow.

  One of the garage men took Swartz
up and directed him to stand out of
sight behind a big limousine until the
party looking at the Thunderbolt went
away.

  "Then you can give her the once over
without one knowing anything about
it,” said the man to Swartz. “The boss
gave orders that nobody was to see it
except Mr. Downs and his friends—and
Mr. Ranfelt. of course. They are over
there now, but they won’t stay long.”

  “All right, Bill,” returned Swartz, as
the two sat on the running board of the
limousine.

  "You will easily qualify at the trial
to-morrow, Mr. Downs,” remarked
Helen Ranfelt, as Stanley Downs
pointed out to her the various items that
made up the big Thunderbolt. “I know
something about automobiles, and I can
see that you have about everything in
this car that you could want in a racer.
How I should like to drive her over the
track myself, just once,” she added
wistfully.

  “It wouldn’t be as comfortable as
your Fanchon, Helen,” put in her
father. “Besides, it isn’t customary for
young ladies to drive in races.”

  "I didn’t say I wanted to drive in the
race,” pouted Helen. “Although I
wouldn’t mind doing that if it were con-
sidered the proper thing. What I sug-
gested was that it would be nice to
send the Thunderbolt over that beau-
tiful, smooth wooden floor of the speed-
way, just to feel her going at ninety
miles an hour.”

  “Ninety miles an hour, Helen?” said
Clay Varron, with a laugh. “You have
your nerve with you. Do you realize
that that means a mile and a half a
minute ?”

  "I know the multiplication table,
Clay,” she rejoined. "If it is the mul-
tiplication table you compute it by.
Anyhow, I have driven sixty miles on
a road, and I don’t think speed would
ever scare me very badly.”

  “That’s so,” agreed Lawrence K.
Ranfelt boisterously. “By George,
Clay, I'd rather trust Helen in a race
than a lot of men 1 know. I’d like to
see her in a car against Victor Burn-
ham. I bet she’d make Vic hustle.”
Helen Ranfelt frowned and pinched
her father’s arm.

  “Was it necessary to bring Mr. Burn-
ham’s name into this?” she asked, in a
whisper. "I want to forget him.”

  "If you do, you'd better root for Mr.
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

21

Downs to pull off the race. You know
what Burnham expects if he brings the
Columbiad in first.”

  “What he expects and what he will
get may be widely apart, dad,’’ returned
the girl, in her usual tone, and with a
careless laugh and toss of her head.
“Anyhow, I’m expecting to see the
Thunderbolt do it easily.”

  “We shall get a line on it at the trial
to-morrow,” observed Varron. “I sup-
pose you haven’t any doubt about it
yourself—have you, Stan?”

  Stanley Downs smiled, as he patted
the gray monster, with its immense
white “5” on the front of the radiator,
and repeated in three other places, on
each side of the hood and at the back.

  “I’m ready to guarantee that the
Thunderbolt is in perfect condition to-
night,” he said. “That means it will be
the same in the morning, for it will be
shut up here by the garage men after
we’ve gone, and 110 one else will see it
till I come down here to drive it to the
speedway.”

  “You’ll drive it through the city your-
self, then?” asked Varron.

  “Certainly. It is the safest thing
to do.”

  “Plow do you feel yourself?” asked
j\Ir. Ranfelt, slapping him on the shoul-
der. “Think you are fit?”

  “Seem to be,” replied Stanley, as the
party filed out of the room and went
down the stairs on their way to the
street.

  “Now, Hank,” said the man he had
called Bill. “If you want to take a
flash at the Thunderbolt, now is your
time.”

  Hank Swartz walked over to the
racer, over which a bunch of electric
lights still glowed, and bent down to
look at her closely.

  This man had owned several cars in
his life, and he knew the “points” of an
automobile. So his examination of the
Thunderbolt was an intelligent one,
even though he was not long making it.

  “Well?” queried Bill, as Swartz at
last moved away from the Thunder-
bolt. “What do you think of her?”
Hank Swartz drew a long breath.
Then he shook his head slowly.

  “She is unbeatable—as she stands
to-night,” he answered.

  He went out of the garage, boarded
a street car at a near corner, and sent
his name up to a certain room in a
prominent hotel.

  “Mr. Burnham is out," announced (lie
clerk, when the telephone had failed
to draw a response from the room.

  Swartz frowned impatiently. Then
he hastily wrote his name 011 a card and
handed it to the clerk. On the card he
had also written: “Call me up right
away. Important. Trouble.”

  “See that Mr. Burnham gets this card
as soon as he returns, please,” he re-
quested, as he turned away from the
desk.

  He strode up and down the spacious
lobby several times, thinking, and mut-
tering to himself. What he said was:
"The Thunderbolt is unbeatable. I said
it and I sincercly meant it. Unbeatable

—unless-- Well, that will be up to

Burnham.”

  He walked out of the hotel, still
thinking and muttering.

        CHAPTER VII.
        A Reply by Wire.

THE trial of the Thunderbolt was
an entire success. As Stanley
Downs had said, the car was
tuned to perfection, while he, the
driver, was as good as his machine. The
two worked together like one organism.

  There were several hundred people
at the speedway to see the trial, al-
though it was not a public exhibition.
The spectators included drivers of other
cars, mechanicians, officers of the
speedway—including the manager,
22

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

Colonel Frank Prentiss—and other per-
sons who were connected in various
ways with the track and the race that
was to take place on Thursday.

  Stanley did not push his car too hard,
but he went over the two miles in a min-
ute and twenty seconds, which was at
the rate of ninety miles an hour. This
admitted the car to the cup race, the re-
quirement being a speed of not less than
eighty-five miles an hour.

  When the trial was over, and as soon
as he could get away from the swarm
of interested people who crowded about
the car after it had passed the judges’
stand and been declared qualified, Stan-
ley left the track and made his way to
the garage, where he turned the Thun-
derbolt over to his mechanician.

  He had had a telegram from his uncle
that morning which he should have an-
swered before—only that he did not
know what to say. It disturbed him so
that it was only by desperately concen-
trating his mind on the business imme-
diately in hand that he had been en-
abled to drive in the trial.

  The telegram was brief and to the
point. It read as follows:

  Have heard that you met with accident in
mountains not far from Poughkeepsie. Is
money safe? Answer at once.

Richard Burwin.

  “What shall I do about this, Clay?”
asked Stanley of his friend, as the two
pored over the telegram in Stanley’s
room at the hotel. “The money is at
the bottom of the lake. I suppose it is
safe enough, but I haven’t got it,” he
added grimly.

  “I suppose you must answer the
wire?” observed Varron, with a ques-
tioning look.

  '“If you knew my uncle as well as I
do,” returned Stanley, “you would not
ask that. Of course I must answer it.”

  “W ell, then, I’d give him the answer
you just now gave me.”

  Stanley looked at him, puzzled, for

a moment. Then he uttered a short
laugh and shook his head.

  “You mean that I shall telegraph him
the money is safe?”

  “Just that,” replied Clay Varron.
“You said yourself it was safe. That is
what he asks.”

  “That would be a prevarication. I
don't see how I can say that. He
wouldn’t consider it safe if I told him
where it was. No, Clay, I can’t do it.
My uncle is always square with me. I
should feel like a crook if I sent him
such a message as that.”

  “Well, what will you do? . If you tell
him the truth, what will be the conse-
quence ?”

  “The consequence will be that he will
think I am a fool,” answered Stanley
Downs, without hesitation.

  “He couldn’t think that, unless he’s
a fool himself,” was Clay’s warm re-
joinder. “Come again.”

  “Well, he would know that I had
failed in a matter where I should have
used extreme care, and I doubt whether
he ever would trust me again. I have
fallen down, and there is no getting
away from it.”

  Stanley Downs strode up and down
the room in such a dejected frame of
mind that his friend became indignant.

  “What’s the matter with you, Stan?
Buck up! You took a risk of your
life to save a girl, and you did what any
man ought to do. The fact that some
of them would have held back is noth-
ing to do with the case. When you
knew that that crazy kid cousin of mine
was driving straight to a horrible death,
you followed her up and brought her
through. If you call that ‘falling down,’
or behaving like a fool, then I can only
say 1 wish there were more fools like
you in the world.”

  Stanley Downs placed his two hands
affectionately on the shoulders of his
loyal friend and looked him in the eyes,
as he asked earnestly:

  “Clay, now, on the level, would you
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

23

ask me to tell a deliberate lie to my
uncle, who has always been straight
with me—who has been indeed more
than a father—and who would fight
any man who dared even to hint that
I would juggle with the truth? Would
you ?”

  Clay Varron coughed in embarrass-
ment. Then he answered, in as earnest
a voice as Stanley’s own:

  “Of course you can’t do it, Stan. But
1 don’t know what to advise you to tele-
graph him. 1 don’t, by gosh!”

  “There is only one way out of it that
I can see,” declared Stanley, after a
few minutes’ cogitation. “That is, to
evade his question for the present. I
am in hopes that after Thursday I shall
be able to go to New York with the
money.”

  “You will, old man,” was Clay’s
eager response. ‘'You’ll win that race
and have twenty thousand dollars, to
replace what yrou have lost. I am sure
of that. I believed it before 1 saw the
trial to-day. Now 1 know there is noth-
ing can beat the Thunderbolt, with you
at the wheel. This Columbiad may be
a good car. I believe it is. But, the
cars being equal—and I have no idea
that the Columbiad is better than the
Thunderbolt, you are a better driver
than Burnham. That will give you just
the ‘edge’ you require to come in first.
Your judgment in driving will beat
Burnham, as sure as that the sun will
rise to-morrow morning.”

  There was no resisting the enthusi-
asm of Clay Varron. A smile broke
over Stanley’s troubled countenance,
and it was with a feeling of confidence
that he took up a pad of telegraph
blanks from a table to write a message
to Richard Burwin.

  lie was some little time composing
the telegram. At last, however, he had
written what he thought would be the
best thing, and he read it to Clay, in
the following words:

     Am detained in Buffalo until after the au-
  tomobile race on Thursday. Have business
  with Colonel Prentiss. Will come to New
  York on Friday. All well.

Stanley Downs.

    “That ‘All well’ is a good touch,”
  approved Clay Varron. “It is the truth,
  too. When you have driven this race,
  everything will be well, and you will go
  down to New York with your twenty
  thousand dollars. Then you can tell
  your uncle about it, if you like.”

    “I certainly shall tell him. I am in
  hopes that, if there is no loss, he will

 forgive me-”

   “For taking a chance on being
 drowned to save a girl, eh?” interrupted
 Clay. "Well, if he doesn't forgive you
 he will have a hard time explaining to
 his conscience. Going to take that tele-
 gram downstairs and have it sent, or
 will you telephone for a boy to be sent
 here?” asked Clay.

    "I think I’ll walk around with it to
  the office. Then I shall know it gets off
  right away,” decided Stanley. “Will
  you dine with me to-night?”

    “Can’t, dear boy,” answered Clay.
  “I’ve promised to take dinner with the
  Ranfelts, at their hotel. Then we are
  going to a theater. By the way, you
  were invited, too—weren’t you?”

   “Yes. But I begged off. I knew
 this telegram was here, and, to tell the
 truth, I didn’t feel like talking and
 seeing a show. There are only two
 more clear days before the race, and I
 think I shall use them in resting, except
 when I am exercising the Thunderbolt
 on the speedway. I want to get used
 to that track.”

   “There is not much to be learned
 about it, I should think,” said Vernon.
 “It is almost a counterpart of the
 speedway at Sheepshead. Two-mile
 oval, with two half-mile straightaways
 and two half-mile turns.”

"Yes. I know all that,” interrupted
Stanley. “And at the curves the out-
. side edges rise to twenty-five feet. The
24

WIDE-AWAKE -A IA GAZIN E

track is seventy feet wide. You see,
I have all its dimensions. I even know
that it is built of two-by-four pine, laid
on edge. But all that means little to a
man in a big race, unless he has prac-
ticed again and again. No matter how
smooth a track may seem to be, there
are sure to be little kinks that a driver
should know.”

  “In what way are there kinks?”
“Little waves where the going rises
slightly—almost imperceptibly—and yet
which will make a fast-running car
swerve. You know that, Clay. You
are an automobilist.”

  Clay Varron nodded. He did, in-
deed, understand how slight an obstruc-
tion will change the course of a motor
car when going at high speed. There
could be no argument as to the wisdom
of a driver trying out the track as often
as possible.

  “Of course, Stan, it would be foolish
in you to neglect all possible precau-
tions. So I suppose it was wise for you
to pass up this dinner-and-show game
to-night. There’ll be supper after the
theater, of course, and I dare say it will
be two o’clock in the morning, if not
later, before the fair-haired boy who
is talking to you will sink upon his
downy pillow.”

  “Drivers in three-hundred-and-fifty-
mile cup races should not stay up till
two in the morning,” said Stanley, with
a laugh. “So I have plenty of excuse
for not being with you to-night.”
“Another thing, Stan, that might
have decided you to remain away is
that Victor Burnham will be in the
party. I don’t believe you like him any
more than I do. Besides, he will be
your principal opponent in the race, I
think, and you wouldn’t want to talk
about it, I know.”

  “But he would, I guess?”

 “Sure! He’s just the kind of
bounder who would try to get your goat
by talking about the difficulties of the

thing, and wondering whether your car
will stand the racket.”

  “That would be very unsportsman-
like.” remarked Stanley, with a shrug.

  “Of course. That’s why Burnham
would do it. He’s a scalawag through
and through, Stan. I know that. I’ve
met him before. And, I tell you, old
man, when you are in the race, you
want to look out for him. If there is
anything he can do to foul you, that’s
what he’ll do.”

  Stanley Downs laughed disdainfully.
“There isn't much chance of a driver
fouling another in an automobile race
without his risking his own neck, as
well as the other fellow’s, Clay. I can
take care of myself when once w° are
going.”

  “1 reckon so,” agreed Clay Varron.
“Well, I’ll walk with you as far as the
telegraph office. We’ll take those back
streets. They are a short cut. You
know the way, don’t you?”

  “Of course I do. Come on!”

  The two young men walked briskly'
from the hotel, and in ten minutes Stan-
ley was handing in his telegram, telling
the clerk to send an answer, if there
should be one, to the hotel.

  Clay Varron had left his friend at
the door of the telegraph office, and
was on his w'ay to his room, to dress
for the dinner to which he had been
invited.

  When the message had been filed and
paid for, Stanley came out alone and
strolled along busy Main Street for
several blocks, thinking of the strange
curve of the ball of fate that had
brought him to Buffalo again, to be-
come a driver in this great race.

  “If I weren’t so worried about that
money, I should enjoy the experience,
just for itself,” he murmured. “As it
is, I am so anxious to win that it may
be tne cause of my defeat. Defeat?
No, sir! I must win!”

  He was so taken up with his thoughts
that he never noticed two rather under-
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

25

sized youths, with the furtive air and in
the flashily cut cheap clothing peculiar
to the underworld class, known as
"gangsters” in most large American
cities, who kept always at the same
short distance behind him, and who
never let him out of their sight.

CHAPTER VIII.

Desperate Treachery.

IT was when Stanley had turned off
the main thoroughfare, with its
electric lights and thronging prom-
enaders, into a labyrinth of dark and
small streets, that he realized he had
lost his way.

  He could have turned around and
come back to the broad, well-lighted
avenue he had just left, but that was
not Stanley Downs’ way, for he rather
enjoyed wandering about cities without
any clear notion of where he was going,
only to find himself at last on some
familiar thoroughfare.

  ‘‘I have nothing particular to do this
evening,” he told himself. “I don’t
think I want any regular dinner, and I
shall go to bed after a while. So I
will just keep going till I come out
somewhere I know.”

  He strolled through the dark streets
for another ten minutes, without com-
ing to any landmark he recognized. Al-
ways behind him crept the shadows of
the two gangsters, and both held in
their hands short clubs of some kind.

  “Ah! I see bright lights at the end
of this street at last!” muttered Stan-
ley. “I knew I’d work out of this
muddle, sooner or later. Glad of it,
for this darkness and the rough side-
walks are getting monotonous.”

  Pie had stood at the mouth of a dark
and forbidding alleyway as he gazed at
the reflection of the lights some three
blocks ahead.

  He laughed at himself for being lost
in a city that he knew fairly well, and
had started to walk on, when a soft

shuffling sound behind made him swing
around, with an instinctive feeling that
he must protect himself from some sud-
den danger.

  It was this instinct that caused him
to raise both arms in an attitude of
defense. Also it prevented his being
struck on the head.

  A blackjack came down rather hard
on his left arm, while another weapon
of the same kind which menaced him
on the right called for immediate action.

  Stanley Downs was used to fighting
in all sorts of ways. Not only was he a
finished scientific boxer, but he had had
experience in the brutal pastime of
“rough and tumble” many times.

  Down went the gangster who was
about to bring the loaded club on him
on his right. Stanley hit clean and true.
His fist caught the fellow under the
chin and sent him flying backward until
he tumbled against a wall, where he
stood, gasping.

  The other rascal, having seen that his
“handy billy” had not injured the arm
it had struck, gathered himself together
and disappeared in the darkness with
the celerity that told of his familiarty
with the locality, as well as proving that
he was a lively sprinter.

  Stanley turned to look at the half-
disabled ruffian who was leaning against
the wall. But hardly had he got his
eyes focused on the limp figure, when
the gangster, by a powerful effort of
will, slunk out of view also.

  Where he went was not apparent.
There were many holes and corners in
that shady neighborhood, including
doorways to houses which were like rat
burrows to those who knew them.

  “Let him go!” muttered Stanley,
smiling. “He hasn’t done me any harm,
and I could not bother to have him ar-
rested, even if there were a policeman
in sight. I suppose they were just com-
mon holdups. If one of them had
landed on my head with a blackjack or
sandbag, they might have get me, too.
2 G

As it was, they don’t win. I’ll get to
the lighted streets, however. I couldn’t
afford to be knocked out a day or so
before that big race. After that, it
wouldn’t so much matter.”

  He laughed aloud at the incident
which had ended in what he regarded
as rather a ludicrous manner, and went
calmly back to his hotel, and soon after-
ward to bed.

  About the time that Stanley Downs
was undressing and thinking over the
big contest in which he was to take
part on the day after the morrow, Vic-
tor Burnham sat in the back room of a
low saloon in a tough part of the city,
talking to the two gangsters who had
vainly endeavored to knock Stanley
senseless.

  “He spoiled it, did he?” grunted
Burnham. “That shows that you fel-
lows are not much good. I ought not
to pay you. What you’ve done for me
is just nothing.”

  “We couldn’t help it,” snarled one
of the ruffians. “We shadowed him for
nearly an hour before we got a chance.
Then somebody must have given him a
tip, for he turned just as I landed on
him with the billy. I got him on the
arm, instead^of the head. He didn’t
pay no attention to me, but he cut loose
a left hook that took Patsy in the jaw
and laid him out stiff. I beat it, of
course. There wasn’t nothing else to
do. Later I met Patsy' here, and here
he is. He’ll tell you whether I’m lying
or not.”

  “I don’t suppose you’re lying,” inter-
rupted Burnham disgustedly. “I only
say you are 110 good. But here is your
fifty dollars. If you can get him again
before the race, I’ll make it a hundred
more—a hundred apiece. If he doesn’t
show up in the race, I’ll know that
you’ve done it, and you’ll get your
money right away.”

  He hurried out of the saloon. Patsy
and the other worthy ordered more

beer and divided the money Burnham
had paid.

  “What do you say, Patsy?” asked
his pal. “Want to go after that duck
again for a hundred?”

  “Not on y'our life!” returned Patsy
fervently. “I wouldn’t tackle him for
five hundred.”

  And Patsy meant it.

  It was in the forenoon of the next
day that Stanley Downs again tried out
the car he was to use in the race. By
his side was the taciturn, efficient young
man who had been offered to him by
the Moussard Company’ as his mech-
anician.

  The mechanician often is as im-
portant a personage in a racing car as
the driver. At any moment during the
race the machine may develop some
weakness, and it is the mechanician who
immediately jumps in to get things
going again. At a time when every sec-
ond counts, the ability' of the mech-
anician to work swiftly very often wins
the struggle.

  Stanley was entirely satisfied with the
performance of the Thunderbolt, and
was smiling as he got out of his seat
in the garage, after the trial on the
track.

  “Paul,” he said to the mechanician.
“You might as well look things over
again. And perhaps it would be well
if you got around very early' in the
morning to make sure that everything
is right. The other men here are all
safe, of course, or the Moussard people
wouldn’t have them. But I believe in
seeing for myself that my machine is
right before it starts.”

  “I’ll do it, sir,” replied Paul briefly.
“I’ll have the car in good shape. But
I would advise that you look her over
yourself afterward.”

  “I shall do that, of course, Paul,”
returned Stanley. “I’m going to the
hotel to rest most of the day. If you
want me, you can call me up there.”

  It was not more than two hours later,
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

27

when there came a banging at Stanley’s
door, accompanied by the voice of Clay
Varron calling to him to open.

  “What’s the matter, Clay? Any-
thing happened ? My uncle? Anything
from him?”

  "No. I haven’t heard from him.
How should I ? He wouldn’t write or
telegraph me, would he? No. It’s
something else. Paul Wallman, your
mechanician, is in the hospital.”

  “What?” cried Stanley, realizing
with a rush what this might mean to
him in the race. “Hurt? Sick?”
“Badly smashed by a car. It' hap-
pened in the garage. He was bending
down by the side of your Thunderbolt.
Another man, handling cars up there,
didn’t see him, and shoved a big car
against him. crushing him against an
iron post. He dropped in a heap, and
they hurried him off to the hospital.
His right arm is broken, and they were
afraid of internal injuries, but I hear
there is nothing of that kind. His
broken arm puts him out of the race
with you, how'ever.”

   “What am I to do?” exclaimed Stan-
ley Downs, knitting his brows. “This
is a serious matter. It may mean that
I shall be hopelessly beaten. Poor
Paul! I’m sorry for him, too. What
shall I do? I’ll have to get another
mechanician. But good ones are scarce.
I can’t afford to risk the race with one

I don’t know. At the same time-”

   “Look here, Stan!” broke in Varron.
“I didn’t come here to bring bad news
without having something to suggest.”
“What is it, Clay?’ questioned Stan-
ley, as he clapped a hand on his friend’s
shoulder. “I suppose you have found
a good man for me—as good a one as
Paul Wallman?”

   “I don’t know about that,” was the
modest response. “The man I have for
you is myself!”

   “Yourself?”

  “Yes. I know the Thunderbolt car
pretty w'ell. I’ve driven one for a con-

 siderable time at intervals, and I don’t
 think there are any Thunderbolt tricks
 that can fool me. Aside from that, you
 know that if there is anything the
 mechanician can do to take you over
 the finish line first, your humble servant
 will do it. Is it a go ?”

  The hearty handshake and the ex-
pression of gratitude in Stanley Downs’
face was answer enough.

  “All right, then,” went on Varron
hurriedly. "Let’s get dowrn to the ga-
rage and look the machine over. Then
we might as w'ell take a spin around
the track together. What do you say ?”
They hurried to the garage, and soon
had the big racer on the street, ready
to start for the speedway, out in the
country. Among those who watched
Stanley Downs drive away, with his
new mechanician, was Hank Swartz.
He was frowning heavily.

  “I don’t know how it is,” muttered
Hank to himself, “but that Downs al-
ways seems to fall on his feet. What
was the use of paying to have Paul
knocked out, when he can get as good
a man as Clay Varron to fill his place.
I know Varron. I’d rather have him in
that Thunderbolt than Paul Wallman,
any time. Burnham will get the worst
of this yet, if he doesn’t watch out.”

       CHAPTER IX.
       A Broken Record.

IT was a splendid day for the big race.
There was not too much sun, for a
soft mist hung in the air, tempering
the light. But it was bright and com-
fortably warm, nevertheless. In a
word, it w'as perfect spring weather.

  The grand stand, bleachers, and
every other part of the immense
grounds where admission was charged
were crowded with sight-seers. In the
vast acreage around the track set apart
for automobiles, the machines were
parked several deep, and in all of them
were groups of well-dressed men and
28

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

beautifully dressed women, who had
come from all parts of the country to
see what could be done by motor cars
that were the last word in scientific
achievement.

  There was a record already of more
than a hundred and two miles an hour
by an American car. Would this be
beaten to-day? That was the question.
Or would it ever be equaled?

  “That Columbiad may do it,” ob-
served Colonel Frank Prentiss to a few
of his intimates, as he stood in the
judges’ stand and looked over the_vast
crowd that had gathered in the hope of
seeing a smashed record. “There is a
possibility, that the Thunderbolt may
touch it, too.”

  “I’d like to see the Thunderbolt win,”
remarked an elderly man, with the in-
describable air of wealth about him that
can seldom be mistaken. “It is an
American car. The Columbiad is of
foreign make, I believe?”

  “Yes,” replied Lawrence K. Ranfelt,
who had brought this gentleman into
the stand as a special favor. “It is
driven by an American, however. Vic-
tor Burnham. Ever heard of him?”
“Yes, I’ve heard of him,” replied the
other dryly. “I guess I’ll get down to
my car. I can see the race from there
comfortably. Come with me, Ranfelt?”
“Yes. I believe I will,” replied Law-
rence K., as he went down the spiral
staircase with -the elderly gentleman.
“My girl Helen is with a party of
friends in another car.”

  The preliminaries of the big race
were carried out rapidly and in busi-
nesslike fashion.

  The drivers and mechanicians had
looked their machines over for the last
time, had given them little dashes over
the track to make sure that everything
worked easily, and now were lining up
across the wide speedway to have their
photographs taken cn masse.

  It was difficult to tell one from the
other at a little distance. They all

looked like machinists in very soiled
clothing, while the tight caps, goggles
in front, and the coat collars pulled up
high, helped to hide the fact that many
of the contestants were extremely per-
sonable young men, who, in their street
clothing, were rather finicky about their
appearance.

  Stanley Downs and Clay Varron
stood side by side, and close by were
Victor Burnham, with his mechanician,
Dan Saltus. Stanley and Burnham did
not look at each other, but Dan Saltus
glanced rather curiously at Clay Var-
ron. Saltus had heard of Paul Wall-
man’s injury, and he rather wondered
what kind of mechanician Stanley
would have with him in the Thunder-
bolt.

  “Get into your cars, gentlemen!” or-
dered the starter, as he waved to the
loud brass band to stop playing.
“Ready!”

  Fie gave a few directions to the
drivers, as the eighteen cars in the race
were brought to a stop inside the line.
He told them they were to go once
around the track, with a big car which
stood a few yards in front of them as
a pacer. They were not to pass the
pacer. When they came around they
could take a flying start for the real
race as he dropped his flag.

  Away went the cars! Even the pre-
liminary rush around the bowl was at
nearly a hundred miles an hour. As
they came around again, the starter
shouted “Go!”—which could not be
heard—and dropped his red flag.

  The race was on !

  A great roar arose from the fifty or
sixty thousand people about the track
as the cars tore around the oval. Every
car was at its best just then, and the
first lap of two miles was made at the
rate of ninety-five miles an hour, even
by the last one.

  The next two miles were covered at
more than a hundred, and the drivers
warmed up, going higher and higher as
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

29

each circuit of the great wooden bowl
was completed.

  The cars were scattered by this time.
The whole track was dotted with them.

  The Thunderbolt and Colutnbiad
were in the ruck, neither conspicuously
in the forefront, nor far behind. Both
Stanley' Downs and Victor Burnham
were holding their cars in, contented to
be safe for the present, without trying
for a lead.

  Time would come when some of the
contestants would drop out. There
were three hundred and fifty miles to
go, altogether. Plenty of time for the
vicious struggle that must come when
victory lay just among a few of the sur-
vivors.

  Stanley Downs, his goggles firmly
adjusted and his eyes gazing straight
ahead, knew he had his car well under
control. He could feel it leaping for-
ward in response to every light touch
on the throttle, while it obeyed the
least turn of the wheel over which he
could just see the yellow-brown pine
flooring ahead.

  “She’s going all right, Stan?’’ shouted
Varron in his ear.

  “Perfectly!”

  “I haven’t heard a sound from her
that shouldn’t be there.”

  “Nor I.”

  “All right, Stan! Keep steady!
You’ll make it!” reassured Clay Var-
ron. “Hello! That was Burnham!”
he added, as a car swept close to them,
so that it seemed as if there had been
a deliberate attempt at collision. “The
man must be crazy!”

  Burnham had driven his long, snaky
Columbiad so close that Stanley had
been obliged to swerve, giving his rival
a hundred yards advantage, at least,
before the Thunderbolt could recover.

  It was a reckless thing to do. If
Stanley Downs had not been a splendid
driver, he might not have got out of
the way in time. But Burnham had fig-
ured on that. Pie knew Stanley was on

the alert, and it was worth a little risk
to get that much ahead, he thought.

  “You’ve got to make up that gap,
Stan!” shouted Varron.

  Stanley Downs did not trouble to an-
swer. But he let in a little more gas,
and his machine jumped forward in
response.

  “Ah !” chuckled Varron. “That’ll do
it. I don’t believe- What’s that?”

  A soft crack had reached his ears.
It was underneath the car!

  Without a moment’s hesitation, Var-
ron leaned far over the side of the car,
and seizing an iron handhold, he peered
underneath.

  As he pulled himself to his seat again,
he shouted to Stanley Downs:

  “Get down off the track. We’ll have
to lose a minute or two! Not more!
Hurry!”

  Stanley did not ask what was the
matter until he had steered his car to
the inside of the track, in front of the
judges’ stand. He had not quite
stopped when Varron was on the
ground, a pair of pliers in his hand.

  Under the car he dived as it came to
a standstill, and there was a minute’s
work with the pliers. Then he came
out, leaped into his seat, and shouted
to Stanley: “Go—like the deuce!”

  Up shot the Thunderbolt to the track
again, and it was going as fast as any
of them, almost at once. It was not
till the speedometer told that once more
they were doing a hundred miles an
hour that Varron volunteered any in-
formation as to what had been wrong.

  “Connecting rod loosened,” he ex-
plained. “It had been done purposely,
for there was a nut wedged where it
would prevent the thing being found
out at first. I never saw anything more
infernally cunning. Somebody got at
the car while we were having our pic-
tures taken. That’s the only time it
could have been done, for I’d looked
her over just before that. The con-
necting rod was all right then.”
30

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

  “We’ll talk about that after the race,”
said Stanley shortly.

  The delay had given Burnham a start
on the Thunderbolt of a whole lap—
two miles.

  Stanley could not lessen the distance,
try as he would. He decided, after a
dozen circuits of the oval, that he would
not try any more just then. He would
content himself with not getting any
farther behind.

  So far it appeared as if the Thun-
derbolt and Columbiad were just about
equal in power and speed. It would be
nip and tuck, even if they were level.

  The race kept on, and car after car
dropped out, unable to stand the gruel-
ing pace. When there were a hundred
and fifty miles to go only nine cars
remained—just half the number that
had started.

  “We’ve gained one lap on Burnham,”
shouted Varron to Stanley. “The other
cars are not in it for first place. Keep
it up. We did a hundred and three
miles an hour for the last lap. That
beat Burnham. Go ahead! Go on !”

  Varron was wild now. He saw that
the Thunderbolt was slowly creeping up
on its rival. A little more and they
would lap him again.

  “It must be done! The Thunderbolt
must win!”

  He bellowed this through the roar of
the car, and though the rushing wind
drove the words back into his throat,
he still kept up his frantic cries of en-
couragement to the cool, steady driver
at his side.

  Stanley Downs had been in many a
contest before, on the football field, at
polo, and other sports. But never had
he taken part in a battle as exciting as
this, and never had he been cooler.

  He felt that the machine was work-
ing smoothly, that every part seemed
to be in perfect accord, and that he was
slowly gaining on the rival who had
resolved to beat him at any cost.

  Clay Vari-on had used his oil can at

frequent intervals. Being a racing car,
the Thunderbolt could be replenished
with oil from the seat in all of its more
important parts, and Clay had taken
care there should be no lack of lubri-
cant.

  Twenty, forty, a hundred miles had
been covered, and Stanley Downs lifted
his machine almost even with the Co-
lumbiad. Another effort and he would
pass.

  It was at this instant that Stanley
caught a glimpse out of the corner of
his eye of the driver of the Columbiad,
as the latter turned his head slightly
in the direction of his rival. Also, he
saw that the mechanician, Dan Saltus,
was shouting something to Burnham,
as he raised his hand, apparently in
remonstrance.

  It was all so quick that afterward
Stanley Downs did not know exactly
what he had seen in the Columbiad.

  Just as Saltus shouted, there was a
quick swerve of the Columbiad, and it
crowded toward the Thunderbolt.

  It was the same trick that Burnham
had played early in the race, and which
then might have resulted in the hor-
rible death of the four men in the two
cars.

  Stanley gripped his wheel tighter and
tried to steer out of the way, even al-
though he knew it would lose for him
two or three hundred precious yards.

  But he did not go quite far enough!
The Columbiad bore down on him, and
the two raced along for a second or
two, with only a few inches separating
them.

  Then came the crash. By one of
those curious combinations of circum-
stances not uncommon in automobiling,
it chanced that a rear corner of the
Thunderbolt clipped the other car just
where it would upset its gravity.

  Bang! Smash!

  The Columbiad was on its side, while
Stanley, quickly recovering from the
jar, whirled on alone.
THE SPEEDWAY OF FATE

31

  There was no time for Stanley to
look at the wreck. He kept on with
the race. He must win, no matter who
might be hurt. It is the cruel rule in
races of all kinds. Only those not in
the actual contest can give time to look
after those who may have fallen in
the struggle.

  As they tore around on the next lap,
keeping well clear of the wrecked car,
Varron saw men lifting Burnham and
his mechanician away, and the .next
time around the Columbiad had been
turned over on its wheels by a score
of men and pushed out of the way.

  It did not take long to cover the re-
maining distance. As Stanley Downs
rushed the Thunderbolt over the finish
line, his number went up on the board:
“Number 5 wins!” Directly afterward
the time was recorded also: “103.10.”

  This meant that the Thunderbolt had
covered the three hundred and fifty
miles at an average speed of more than
one hundred and three miles an hour.

 Stanley Downs had beaten the
record!

  It was some time before Stanley
could get to a certain car parked in the
infield, in whom he had seen an elderly
gentleman, to whom he wanted very
much to speak.

  There were a number of formalities
to be gone through. The man who had
won the Lawrence Cup could not be al-
lowed to go away till he had been ad-
dressed by the judges and had his
photograph taken.

  Then he had to go and change his
clothes after a shower bath, and do
various other things to bring him back
to his usual appearance.

  It was all clone at last, however, and
he dashed for the car that had been
his aim all along since he had finished
the race and had time to look about him.

  “Uncle!” he cried, as the elderly gen-
tleman took his hand in a warm, strong
grip. “Somehow, I had a feeling that
you’d come—especially when I got no

reply to my telegram. I’m very glad
to see you.”

  Richard Burwin was an unemotional
man, as a rule. But there were tears
behind his glasses as he said brokenly:
“Stan, my boy, I knew all about it.
I know more than you do. That fellow
Burnham was pretty slick, but not quite
slick enough for the old man. I had
his measure from the first. However,

he’s dead, so-”

  “Dead ?”

  “Yes. He was smashed all to pieces.
Crushed almost to a jelly. Dreadful
thing, of course. But he got it when
he tried to crowd you off the track—or
kill you. I don’t believe he cared what
he did. His mechanician will get well
they say.”

  ‘Tin glad to hear that,” said Stanley
earnestly.

  “So am I,” came from Richard Bur-
win. “I am told he confessed, when
they carried him off the track, and when
he thought he was dying, that he had
stolen a package of twenty thousand
dollars from you when you were at
the track before you started for New
York in your car.”

  “Stole it?” cried Stanley, dazed.
“Yes. He changed it on you. Com-
mon trick among crooks, you know.
The old green-goods game! So you
had only a bundle of worthless paper,
with a real bank note on the outside,
in your car pocket. That’s what went
to the bottom of the lake. The money
is safe, the fellow says. We’ll get it
back when we’ve seen him at the hos-
pital, and got his formal confession.
Now, let’s get away from here. We’re
going to take luncheon with Ranfelt—
an old friend of mine—Prentiss, and

Miss Ranfelt-

  “Why, Mr. Downs, won’t you let me
congratulate you ?” broke in the sweet
voice of Helen Ranfelt. “I have been
trying to do it all the time you have
been talking to Mr. Burwin.” Then, in
a lower tone, that only Stanley could
32

hear: “You know how much this
means to me. I am horrified at Mr.
Burnham’s death. But—wouldn’t it
have been dreadful if he had won the
race?”

“Hello, Helen! How do you think
you’d like to be a mechanician?” asked

Clay Varron, laughing, as he took his
fair cousin’s hand. “It’s great sport, I
assure you.”

  “Clay, you’re splendid,” she an-
swered. “If you hadn’t helped Mr.
Downs to win the cup, I never would
have forgiven you.”

SOME NEW INVENTIONS

    To convert an ordinary wash boiler into a washing machine, an .inventor
has patented a metal cone, perforated at the top, so that jets of boiling water
are forced through clothing.	_

    An electrical annunciator device, operated by push buttons on chairs through-
out a hall, is working successfully in Holland to auction eggs without the usual
noise and confusion of such sales.

    Both the moistening and sealing of letters is done in a single operation by
a new office implement, in which a dampened roller passes under the flaps, ahead
of a larger one, that closes them.

    To enable automobiles to pull themselves up hills or out of soft spots in
roads, a South Dakota inventor has patented a windlass which may be attached
to the rear hub of the car and operated by a motor.

    A Seattle man has invented a device which keeps automobiles from skid-
ding on wet pavements. There is a receptacle under the rear seat of the car
in which sand is placed, and, by pressing a pedal on the floor of the car, the
sand is released and spread in front of the rear wheels, giving instant traction.

    A tin hood which fits over a rooster’s head and neck in such a way as to
prevent the fowl from heralding the dawn has been invented. A rooster did
too much early-morning crowing near a police station, and one of the police-
men devised the invention, which is said to work perfectly, and without injur-
ing the rooster.

    A pump that not only pumps up an automobile tire within a few minutes,
but that keeps the tire at that pressure, regardless of large punctures, is a new
invention. The pump can be attached to the hub of the wheel in less than
a minute. It works on the rotary-pump principle, each revolution of the wheel,
while running the car, driving air into the tire.

    In putting up tall buildings, contractors have had a problem in boring holes
in steel beams wherein to place the rivets, those little bands of steel that are vital
to the erection of skyscrapers. By putting a trained army of drillers at work, the
contractor has been able to drill correctly probably five hundred holes a day.
A new machine, invented by a Los Angeles man, has demonstrated that it can
bore thirty perfect holes in two and one-half minutes, requiring in the opera-
tion the services of one man and a dynamo generating sixteen and one-half horse
power. This boring is done in a steel beam three inches thick. The gang drill,
as it is called, can also be used on iron pipes. It is said that one man using the
machine can do the work of ten, not only cheaper, but more accurately.

SYNOPSIS OF PRECEDING CHAPTERS

CHIP MERRIWELL and his friends fall out with Kadir Dhin, a Hindu student at
Fardale, whom Colonel Gunn brought from abroad. Chip trails him as he sneaks
out of the barracks at night, and thwarts an attempt to abduct Rose Maitland, whose
father, an English officer from India, was murdered in France, from the home of Colonel
Gunn. The colonel tells Chip, in a veiled way. that the man who murdered Rose’s father
did it because he and his daughter violated a religious sanctuary, and that her father's fate
is planned for Rose. Chip and his friends shadow Kadir Dhin, and look for mysterious
strangers, at Gunn’s request. On Christmas Eve Rose is missing, and Clancy and Kess,
unable to find Chip, go to the railroad station, and see Bully Carson tip the baggageman
as a curious-looking trunk is put on the train. Clan and Kess board the train, and the
trunk is put off at Carsonvill'e, where they discover that it has been occupied by the
unconscious form of Chip.

CHAPTER VIII.

Bully Carson Explains.

kHE shrewd eyes of Colo-
nel Carson sparkled with
a sly twinkle. He sat
before his deep-throated
fireplace, in his home in
Carsonville. Into the
room he had called his
son Bully, to receive
from him a full account of the recent
startling happenings, and the result of
the investigation which had followed.

  Bully had come in prepared to put
his part in the affair in the best light
possible. Yet he would speak to his-
father with more openness than he
would to any one else, for it was
known that the elder Carson had sown,
in his youth, a pretty big crop of wild
oats himself.

<3A

  With that sly, humorous twinkle,
Carson turned on his hopeful son. In
a way he was proud of Bully, though
he raged at him daily.

  “I hear ye got out of ft:. Bully, but
it took some hard work and tall lyin’.
I’ve jest got home, but I’ve been bear-
in’ about it; I'd been down to that in-
vestigation myself if I’d been here.
Prob’ly some o’ the things I’ve heard
ain’t so. So ye can jest straighten me
out about it.”

  This was so much better than Bully
had anticipated that the sour expression
passed from his coarse red face. Feel-
ing more comfortable, he stood up,
with his broad back to the fire, and,
taking out a cigar, bit off the end of it
and scratched a match.

  “Well, ’twas the funniest and sin-
g’larest thing that ever came down the
pike, dad, and for a while it looked’s if
34

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

they had me in bad. It was Clancy and
Kess that went gunnin’ for me, and
come nigh bringin’ me down. But I’ll
git even with ’em for that, see!”

  He lighted his cigar, and stood smok-
ing.

  “And me and Chip Merriwell are due
to have some interestin’ times, too.
They’re all in together, and he has hit
at me more than once.”

  “Young Merriwell was in a box or
trunk in the baggage car, unconscious
and about dead, when they put it off
here, and you was charged with havin’
that trunk or box put on the car. Of
course you didn’t, and know nothin’
about it. You’re a mighty big fool at
times, Bully, but you’re not so big a one
as that; and there’d have been no sense
in it.”

  Bully’s face glowed to a dull and an-
gry crimson, as he recalled the grilling
he had been put through by the police
officers because of that accusation.

  “Me and that young Hindu, Kadir
Dhin, was charged with doin’ it; and
they’d have fastened it on him sure if
Colonel Gunn hadn’t come to his help;
for, you see, it was Kadir Dhin’s
Hindu trunk that they found Merri-
well in. It looked mighty bad for him
a while, and looked bad for me, too,
jest because I had been with him not
long before, and had given the baggage
man a quarter at the station for bring-
in’ down for me a box of stuff from
Dickey’s that it would have cost me a
dollar to send in the reg’lar way.

  “There’s a whole big story back of
it, dad,” Bully explained, “and there
were some things I didn’t know myself
until Gunn made that statement to the
officers. Kadir Dhin had been treat-
ing me fine as silk, and I was going
around with him a lot. He had spend-
in’ money, and he wasn’t afraid to blow
it. It wasn’t my bizness to ask him
how he got it. Yet he came to Fardale,
as you recklect, as a sort of charity stu-

dent. I thought he had mebby been
gamblin’, and had been lucky.

  “He was talkin’ ag’inst Merriwell,
and plannin’ ways to do him, and 1
liked that. And we did ‘do’ him, in
the end, as I’ll tell you.

  “It started when that girl was miss-
in’ out of Gunn’s house, where she has
been stayin’. Old Gunn sent out an
alarm about it, and telephoned the con-
stable. In a little while it seemed as
if half the town was searchin’ for her.
Kadir Dhin and me had been trying to
annoy' Merriwell that forenoon, when
he was out sleighin’ with her, by foller-
in’ him round in another sleigh.”

  “You did that?” growled the elder
Carson, with a sniff of displeasure, as
he pulled at his yellow-gray goatee.
“ ’Twasn’t the act of a gentleman, son.”

  But Bully answered, with a careless
laugh:

  “Anyhow, ’twas fun. We was hopin’
to make him so mad that afterward he
would want to climb us, and so give us
a chance to double on him together and
trim him good. Kadir Dhin had it in
for him for a knock-out blow Merry
had given him, and I’ve got some things
to remember.

  “Well, when she was missin’ that aft-
ernoon, and we saw Merriwell goin’ to-
ward the lake lookin’ for her, we fol-
lered him again. When we got down
there, I turned back, because it was so
cold; so I didn’t see what happened,
and there’s two stories about it.

  “Kadir Dhin sayrs he found the girl
bewildered and wanderin’ about in that
timbered cove beyond the Pavilion, and
was try'in’ to lead her home, when Mer-
riwell came on him and attacked him;
the attack cornin’ so sudden, Kadir
Dhin says, that he had no time to de-
fend himself before he was knocked
stiff in the snow.

   “1 think that’s right, too,” said Bully.
“For that’s the way he told it to me,
when he met me again, close by the
corner, at Gunn’s. Merriwell had
FRANK MERRIWELL, JR., AT FARDALE

35

brought the girl home, and was then
in the house. Kadir Dhin had follered.
And, say, he was lookin’ wicked; a man
lookin’ as he did then would sure put
a knife in a feller in the dark!

  “As he begun to tell me about it, we
walked on, over toward the barracks.
He was ravin’. There’s nobody much
at the barracks now, because nearly all
the fellers have gone home for the hol-
idays. And we stood there, talkin’ it
over, Kadir Dhin sayin’ he wished Mer-
riwell would come along, on his way to
his room in the barracks; that he
wanted to meet him there, and settle
with him.

  “And just then we saw him cornin’
from Gunn’s. Kadir Dhin put his hand
in his coat pocket, and I thought lie was
divin’ for a knife.

  “‘None o’ that,’ I says to him;
‘there’s two of us’; and, if he had a
knife, he didn’t draw it. But he turned
a funny yellow kind o’ white, and I
knew that something was coming. ‘Go
at him fair,’ I says, ‘and I’ll back you.’ ”

  “Right out in public, too!” com-
mented Colonel Carson; “shows how
many different kinds of idiot y’ aire,
Bully!”

  “It seemed quiet enough; nobody on
the parade ground, and didn’t seem to
be anybody in the barracks. Anyhow,
then was the time, if it was to be done;
and you're to recklect that it wasn’t me,
but the Hindu, that planned it.

  “ ‘I want to speak with you,’ said
Kadir Dhin, when Merriwell came up;
‘I’m goin’ to settle with you right now!’
He didn’t strike out at him, but slid
his hand along, as if he was tryin’ to
get Merriwell by the throat. At that,
Merriwell hit him and knocked him
back against the barracks wall. And
then I came in.”

  He stopped and drew in his breath
heavily.

  “When you fight your own battles,
Bully, I don’t object; but when you

fight those of other people, and 110 coin

coming in for it-”

  “That’s all right, dad; but I’d owed
Merriwell a licking a long time.”

  "And you took that chance to pay
it?”

  “I guess he thinks I paid him; but
for a while he prOb’bly wasn’t in a con-
dition to appreciate it. We left him
layin’ there in the snow. When we had
started off, we saw him crawl to his
feet and stagger int’ the buildin’.”
Bully laughed gleefully. “He sure was
lookin’ sick!”

  “And this young Hindu went away
with ye?”

  "He went as far as the street corner
beyond the parade ground. And I didn’t
see him again until we was both of us
hauled up before the officers, here,
charged with puttin’ Merriwell in that
trunk and tryin’ to kill him.”

  “How did he git into that trunk?”
the elder Carson demanded. “You said
it was Kadir Dhin’s!”

  “Blessed if I know how he did git
into it!” Bully declared. “Jest between
you and me, dad, it looks like Kadir
Dhin went back there to the barracks
and mebby found him in a faint from
that lickin’, and put him in. But Kadir
Dhin savs he didn’t. Merriwell told
the officers that after he got to his room
he fainted, and that when he came to
he was here in Carsonville, and he
didn’t know, himself, how ’twas done.
Kadir Dhin told the officers that he
didn’t go back to the barracks at all,
after leaving me at the corner; but that
after a while he went down to the sta-
tion, and when he saw the trunk there
he looked at it, wonderip’ whose it was,
as it looked so much like his, and had
no marks 011 it.

  “And it was right there,” said Bully,
“when he wasn’t being believed, and the
thing would have been cinched on him,
that Colonel Gunn came popping in to
his rescue, with the most amazing yarn
ye ever listened to.”
30

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

  “I think I heard some o’ that; but
you go over it, for mebby I didn’t git
it straight. Seems to me, Bully, you
was mighty reckless all along, and it’s
a wonder to me y’ ain’t in the jail.”
Fie was looking at Bully closely; his
brows were furrowed, and the half-hu-
morous light had faded out of his eyes.
He was again pulling at his yellow-gray
goatee, this time nervously.

  “Colonel Gunn said,” Bully ex-
plained, “that a Hindu soldier who had
killed the girl’s father in France was
known to be somewhere around here,
and once before had tried to carry her
off; and ’twas.his belief that this Hindu
had got into the barracks.

  “And then,” added Bully, “to bolster
this, they brought on again the hack-
maii who had taken the trunk to the
station. He had said that a dark-faced
feller, who was dressed in the Fardale
cadet uniform, had hired him to take
the trunk to the station; and he had
identified Kadir Dhin as bein’ that fel-
ler. But now, when he heard what
Gunn said about it, he backed water,
and admitted that though the dark-
faced feller looked like Kadir Dhin, it
might not have been him; he couldn’t
identify Kadir Dhin as being the one,
he said. Now, what d’ye think of
that?”

  “Lied!” snorted Carson.

  “But Kadir Dhin has told me him-
self that he knows nothin’ about it.”
“He lied, too!”

  “Anyway, they let Kadir Dhin off, on
account of what Colonel Gunn told ’em;
and now officers are out lookin’ for the
other Hindu.”

  “They won’t find him,” said Carson.
  He glared at his son.

  “Bully, I’ve tried to give ye some
instructions, ye know. I’ve said to you
that a man is ginrally justified in takin’
a sportin’ chance on ’most anything
that promises good money, but that to
be safe he’s alius got to keep on the
right side o’ the law.”

  “Wasn’t I ?” Bully roared. “I might
’a’ been fined for fightin’, but what else?
I didn’t have anything to do with that
trunk bizness.’

  “Who checked that trunk?”

  “Nobody. That’s the funny part of
it. The men at the station shoved it
into the car without noticin’, seein’ it
there with other trunks, and the bag-
gageman didn’t notice; or, he says he
didn’t, until Clancy called it to his atten-
tion.

  “Clancy and Kess thought they had
heard some one groaning in the trunk,
and when it went into the car they went
in, too; and then when they heard the
sound again, in the car, they raised a
row, and the trunk was put off here
and opened.

  “Now, there’s the case,” said Bully,
breathing heavily. "Only, the baggage-
man will get fired; for he was held here
and questioned by the officers, and when
they drove him into a corner he had
to admit that he had received a quar-
ter from me for carryin’ the box I
brought down from Dickey’s. I had
told that, to save my own bacon, when
it seemed they was goin’ to prove that
I had given him the money for trans-
portin’ the trunk; and he had to say
that it was so, that it was only the box
I had paid for.”

  “I reckon that baggageman lied about
knowin’ no more than he said about the
trunk,” Carson observed. "Don't you
think he did, Bully?”

  “I don’t know, dad.”

  “Well, it’s mixin’. Where’s Merri-
well?”

  “He’s been sent home; he was all in,
hardly able to tell his story. I may git
fined yet,” he added uneasily, “for toy-
in' with him too rough there at the
barracks. But Clancy and Kess are

still here and-”

  “Keep away from ’em.”

  “Dad, I won’t,” Bully declared ; "not
until I’ve finished with ’em. And
there'll be some good money, as well as
FRANK MERRIWELL, JR., AT FARDALE

37

satisfaction, in linin’ up ag’inst ’em. It
will be Kadir Dhin and the Duke and
me and a lot more, inside the barracks
and out., that will be havin’ some inter-
esting sessions with Clancy, Merriwell,
and company. Dad, you can count on
that. And the Duke—well, you know
he has got money to burn, and I’ll
never refuse to help him burn it. He’s
been talkin’ to me since this examina-
tion, and he says that this whole thing
can be used to put Chip Merriwell on
the run, and we can now down him.”
The twinkle came again into the eyes
of the elder Carson. He admired
pluck, and had been a rough-and-tum-
ble fighter in his youth.

  “I can’t jest approve of the way two
of you jumped onto Merriwell,” he
observed; “things like that tend to ac-
cumulate a reppytation for cowardice,
Bully'. Reppytation is a thing to be
considered. Basil, or the Duke, as you
call him, is a fool with money, and I
can’t blame ye much for wantin’ to git
next. But be careful, Bully. A sport-
in’ proposition is one thing, but takin’
criminal chances is another. Alius keep
on the right side o’ the law, Bully; in
the long run it pays better.”

  He tugged at his goatee again.

  “But that cur’us trunk case is shore
mixin’. Bully, I think more’n one fel-
ler done some tall lyin’!”

CHAPTER IX.

Some Investigations.

WHEN Chip Merriwell returned
to Fardale, he found himself
against the line-up of which
Bully Carson had spoken to his father.

  But he had received word of it be-
fore. Clancy had written to him about
it. And it was the first subject that
Clan took up, when he met Chip at the
station on the latter’s return.

  “I suppose Kess and I are to blame,”
said Clan remorsefully, “just because
we Weren’t satisfied with getting you

out of that trunk, but tried to unload 011
Kadir Dhin the crime of putting you
there. But they oughtn’t to hold that
against you. Colonel Gunn oughtn’t,
anyway.”

  “Sure nodt,” agreed Kess, who was
with him. “Vodt dhey ar-re saying
apoudt me ton’dt hurdt nopoty, but dhey
ar-re making you oudt a willain yoost
like us.”

  Chip laughed; Kess amused him.
And he was feeling physically fit again,
which, of itself, makes for light-heart-
edness. He had been sent home “all
in”; now he was back, at the end of
the Christmas holidays, ready again to
enter the old Fardale school and reas-
sume the leadership of the loyal fel-
lows who were always his friends.

  "We are all villains together, eh?” he
commented.

  "The sympathy stunt is being worked
hard for Kadir Dhin,” Clan reported.
“You accused him of trying to kidnap
Rose Maitland, and flattened him out
on the ice, and y'ou repeated the accusa-
tion to Colonel Gunn when you got her
to Gunn’s house. On top of that, Kess
and I tried to make the officers down
at Carsonville believe that Kadir Dhin
had found you in a faint in your room
in the barracks, and had put you in that
trunk. I guess we went too fast in
that, and there’s where the trouble be-
gins ; we couldn’t make the officers be-
lieve Kadir Dhin would put you in a
trunk that could be so easily identified
as his. So when Gunn came down and
strung his talk about the soldier Hindu,
our idea was canned, and Kadir Dhin
was released, with an apology.

  “And now Gunn is looking black at
us, Rose Maitland is looking blacker,
and every enemy you ever had seems
to have come to life, and is working
against you. Their leader seems to be
Duke Basil, and I guess yon know what
that means.”

  Chip knew well enough.

  The previous year, Anselm Basil, fa-
38

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

miliarly known as the Duke, had come
over with a number of fellows from
Brightwood and entered Fardale, hav-
ing discovered that it was the better
school. The Duke had been the athletic
leader at Brightwood, and had no no-
tion of playing second fiddle to any one
even at Fardale.

  Duke Basil was an original genius.
Not because he was rich, and a spend-
thrift, for many boys and young men
are that; but because, with all his as-
sumptions and airs and extravagances,
he had athletic ability and brains of a
high order, and had so many good qual-
ities with the bad ones.'

  That Chip and Basil should clash,
was a thing not to be avoided. Basil
had declared to his friends that he in-
tended to be the leader at Fardale, and
that there could be but one. He had
not made his boasts good. So the clash
was renewed at the beginning of the
present school year, yet so far with no
very creditable results or decided vic-
tories to his account.

  Now he beiieved he had found new
leverage. In the first place, it seemed
that Colonel Gunn’s good opinion of
Chip and his friends had been alien-
ated ; which meant that the iron rules of
the academy would be made to bear
hard on them; and could be worked to
their disadvantage. Kadir Dhin, the
colonel’s protege, had been made the im-
placable enemy of Chip and his crowd.
And Bully Carson, a foe not to be de-
spised, even though he was not in the
academy, had all his old animosities re-
aroused.

  Clancy and Kess tried to set these
things forth, as they made their way
with Chip over the snowy roads from
the station to the academy grounds, hav-
ing preferred walking to riding in the
usual "hack,” that they might talk mat-
ters over.

  Chip Merriwell was thinking of how
these things would influence his rela-
tions with Rose Maitland, rather than

viewing them from the standpoint of
his friends. He was hoping that Colo-
nel Gunn’s adverse opinions were not
affecting her, even though she were a
member of his household, and Kadir
Dhin had been her father’s friend and
secretary.

  There was always an unpleasant
memory tucked in the back of Chip’s
mind, which he seldom cared to take
out of its pigeonhole there and con-
sider. His first meeting with Rose
Maitland could not have been more in-
auspicious than it was. He had knocked
Kadir Dhin down in the snowy path on
account of his treatment of Kess; and
Rose Maitland, rushing frantically to
the side of the young Hindu, had called
Chip a coward, with such a sting in the
word that Chip could still feel the burn
of it whenever he permitted himself to
let it enter his mind.

  As Chip and his friends turned into
the path, beyond Mrs. Winfield’s board-
ing house, that led to and through the
parade ground, Kadir Dhin was seen
standing there, much as he had been
on that previous occasion, only that this
time he was in conversation with Duke
Basil.

  “They are regular Siamese twins
lately,” said Clancy, with a grin. “They
knew you were to arrive to-day, and
have been wondering why you didn’t
ride up in the hack.”

  “Uff he standts in my roadt, like vot
he dit pefore-”

  But Kadir Dhin was moving on to-
ward the barracks before Kess finished
his sentence. The Duke had turned to-
ward the village, moving to meet them.

  “Ah, there!” he cried, putting out his
hand as Chip came up. “You’re looking
fine as silk again, old top. T didn’t ex-
pect it. That little rest at home has
done you a lot of good.”

  For an instant Chip hesitated, then
held out his hand; he would be as gen-
tlemanly as the Duke. Indeed, it was
hard not to be friendly with Duke Basil
FRANK MERRIWELL, JR., AT FARDALE 39

on all ordinary occasions. He had a
smile and a bright way with him. It
was this that made him so formidable
when lie pitted his strength against
Chip; for this, quite as much as his
money, enabled him to gather and hold
friends.

  “I’m all right again,” said Chip, talc-
ing the measure of the fellow with his
eye. “You went home yourself, I
think?”

  “Sure. Had a fine time, too.”

  He did not offer to shake hands with
Kess and Clancy, whom he had seen be-
fore that day; but he swung on along
the path, after greeting Chip.

  “He iss smile like a raddlesnalce pe-
fore idt pites der handt vot feedts idt,”
Kess observed. “Idt iss too badt apoudt
dot veller. Aber a man iss my enemy
I vandt him to look like idt.”

 They found that Kadir Dhin had
gone 011 to his room.

  Chip went to his, which he occupied
with Clancy. But they were soon drawn
out of it by hearing Kess in a clatter
of noisy words with the young Hindu.

  Villum’s capacity for blundering was
notorious. He had seen that Kadir
Dhin’s door stood open, and had en-
tered without apology, apparently to no-
tify the young Hindu that Chip Merri-
well had returned, and to ash:

  “Undt vot vill you do apoudt idt?”
Chip was not at all averse to invad-
ing the Hindu’s room, for he wanted
to get a look at the trunk in which he,
unconscious, had been immured on that
journey which might readily have ended
in his death. The noisy words ceased
when Chip and Clan came to the door.

  “He iss say dot I am anodher,” Kess
protested.

  Chip and Clan stepped into the room.
Chip with a smile which he hoped
would temporarily disarm Kadir Dhin’s
enmity. lie glanced over at the queer,
Hindu trunk or traveling chest, of it-
self an interesting specimen of Oriental
workmanship.

  “So that was the thing I was in?” he
commented, ignoring Kess’ complaint.
“It seems that I ought to remember it.
but I don’t.”

  “You remember as much about it as
I do, in spite of the charges of your
friends,” Kadir Dhin asserted.

  There was a malevolent glare in his
shiny black eyes.

  Chip sat down in the nearest chair;
he did not intend to be ruffled. He had
long since discovered that 110 one gains
anything by turning his quills out like
a porcupine.

  “I was in no position to make any
claims about it; but I've wondered
about it hundreds of times. As I was
found in that thing, somebody put me
there.”

  “Perhaps you did it yourself,” said
the young Hindu, with a sneer, though
his manner was guarded; “it’s as cred-
ible as that I did it.”

  Chip looked at him, when his atten-
tion was not directed toward the queer
trunk. He was hoping that if Kadir
Dhin really knew anything about that
odd happening, by some slip, or by the
expression of his face, he might reveal
it.

  “What is it about that Hindu sol-
dier?” he asked. “That is, what do
you know ? I heard what Colonel Gunn
said at that investigation, but 1 wasn't
in a mental condition to take it all in.
Did you know the man?”

  Kadir Dhin stared at him, hesitated,
and then answered:

  “He was my uncle.”

  “Do you think he is here?”

  “I know nothing about that,” said
Kadir Dhin. “Ask Colonel Gunn.”

  “He says the man is here, and did
that.”

  “Then you know as much about it as
I do,” asserted Kadir Dhin, with an im-
patient wave of his hand.

  “But do you believe it?”

  “That is my business. If I say I
don’t, you will then declare that I must
40

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

have put you in the trunk. You’d bet-
ter talk to Colonel Gunn about it. I
don’t know anything.”

  “You’re a Hindu?” said Clancy, butt-
ing in.

  A flush of anger put color into the
dark cheeks of Kadir Dhin.

   “I have that honor,” he declared.

  “Yet you speak English better than
most Americans!”

  “I was educated at the English school
in Madras. If 1 was ignorant of the
language, could I have taken a place in
this school? You talk like a fool. Re-
member that I was Lieutenant Mait-
land’s secretary, translating all his writ-
ten orders to his Hindu soldiers into
their native dialects. I am doubtless a
fool—lor talking with you, but I am not
an ignoramus.”

  He turned to Chip:

  “If you have looked at that trunk
long enough, and have asked all your

questions-”

  “Fired!” cried Clancy. “Come on,
Chip!”

  "This German beer keg came in to
insult me, and you followed to back
him up,” said the young Hindu.

  “Not at all.” Chip insisted. “But
we’re going. We’ll have no words. I
had a natural curiosity to see that trunk,
that’s all. Thank you for the permis-
sion. Good day!”

  “Oh, we’ll meet again,” said Kadir
Dhin. “There’s a settlement coming,
for the accusations you made against
me, when you brought Miss Maitland to
Gunn’s. I’ve a good memory.”

  “Mine is quite as good,” Chip re-
torted, with a sudden scowl. “I
couldn’t have been tossed into that
trunk like a bag of meal if you and
Bully Carson hadn’t doubled on me and
pounded me senseless. Recollect that
there will be other debts to pay, when
you begin to pay off yours.”

  Clan and Kess followed him, grum-
bling.

  “Why didn’t you punch his head for
that?” Clan demanded.

  “You forget, Clan. I didn’t go there
to quarrel, in the first place. Then,
we're in the barracks. And, you’ve said
yourself, that Colonel Gunn would be
pleased to get ;n,e in chancery. I’ve got
to be careful.”

  However, though he knew that Colo-
nel Gunn was explosive and crotchety,
Chip was not ready to accept the no-
tion that the colonel would not treat
him fairly in any situation.

  So it was not because he wanted to
test the colonel’s feelings that Chip
went over to Gunn’s house that after-
noon ; he wanted to see Rose Maitland.
The last time he had seen her she was
bewildered and hysterical.

  That had passed off entirely; she
came in to meet him bright-eyed and
smiling. Yet Chip thought she looked
pale, and that her smile hid a feeling
of anxiety. She soon admitted that she
stood in deathly fear of the Hindu, who
was still the man of mystery to Chip.

  "I was feeling so safe, you know,”
she said in her frank way; "the con-
stable had given Colonel Gunn such as-
surances. I had been going about with
confidence. So I thought I needed no
one to guard me while I went out on
the ice a little while. And down there
everything was so quiet and peaceful
that I really went farther than I meant
to go; I skated on and on until I was
down by the boathouse. I supposed the
place was unoccupied.”

  “We’ve stored our ice yacht and
snowshoes and skis and things like that
in it,” said Chip.

  “But no one has been staying there
regularly ?”

  "No.”

  “That’s what I thought. Yet the Far-
dale students go in and out of there,
as I knew. So when I heard some one
call to me from the boathouse I thought
at first it was you, and then thought it
must be Kadir Dhin; and, as I didn’t
FRANK MERRIWELL, JR.. AT FARDALE

41

understand just what was said, but got
the impression that you—I mean Kadir
Dhin—was hurt and needed help, I ran
up to the door on my skates.

  "I knew that it wasn’t you—I mean
Kadir Dhin—when it was too late; I
was blinded by a cloth that struck me
in the face as I opened the door; it
fell over my head as if it would smother
me; and it was filled with the odor of
a powerful drug. While I fought to get
my head out of the cloth, the drug over-
came me.”

  She was trembling; the color had left
her cheeks.

  ‘‘Before I became so dizzy and be-
wildered,” she added, “I heard the man
speak, and I recognized his voice as that
of Gunga Singh, the Hindu soldier who
murdered my father. The odor of the
drug I had encountered before, in India.
A man was once murdered there, and
that drug was used; I was with father
when he made an investigation of the
murder.”

  “You didn’t see the man at all, then?”
said Chip.

  “No.”

  “You couldn’t have been mistaken
about him?”

  “I know what you mean,” she said;
“but I recognized his voice.”

  “I found you wandering around in
that cove beyond the pavilion.”

  “I don’t know how I got there; by
which I mean I have no remembrance
of it. Of course, Gunga Singh took
me there. Kadir Dhin frightened him,
and he fled through the trees. Kadir
Dhin was trying to guide me home.
They say you accused him. and attacked
him. I’m sorry. Kadir Dhin was my
father’s friend, and is mine. Colonel
Gunn knows that.”

  Chip did not know what to say; he
did not like to declare he was uncon-
vinced.

  “Kadir Dhin had come down to the
lake and had gone in that direction; I

thought he was not trying to lead you
home. I didn’t see the other man.”
“You do think that of Kadir Dhin
now ?” she urged.

  “1 have 110 right to, if you are sure
I am wrong.”

  “I’m sure you are.”

  “I was excited when I brought you
home. When I rushed on him, Kadir
Dhin tried to shoot me; or I thought
he meant to. So when Colonel Gunn
came, asking questions, I said that, and
accused Kadir Dhin. I saw that what I
said offended Colonel Gunn.”

  "Then, you had trouble with Kadir
Dhin at the barracks. I’m sorry you
were so quick, and did him a serious
wrong. It's too bad. I wish you could
be friends. Don't you think you were
too quick?”

  Chip saw that Kadir Dhin had been
telling lies here.

  "At the barracks I did no more than
defend myself; that is, I tried. I didn’t
succeed very well.”

  "You again attacked Kadir Dhin
there ?”

  ".Vo, he attacked me. And he had
Bully Carson with him. You don’t
know Carson, but he’s a big fellow, and
a bruiser.”

  “Kadir Dhin says you attacked him
there, and then that Carson rushed in
and knocked you down. Oh. dear, 1
dislike to talk about it; it’s horrible!
You were too quick.”

  “In one thing'I was too quick,” said
Chip. "I was too quick in going on to
the barracks. I ought to have gone
back to the lake. I didn’t see this
Hindu, Gunga Singh. But then was
my chance to follow his tracks into and
through the woods there, and see what
became of him. I’d like to get on the
track of him now, and will watch out
for him. How was he dressed?”

  "Kadir Dhin says he wore a Fardale
uniform.”

  “So? That’s odd. A Fardale uni-
form. But I recall that it was reported
42

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

that some one, thought to have been a
burglar, had stolen clothing out of the
barracks.”

  “Kadir Dhin fears Gunga Singh as
much as I do; he is watching for him,
and will have him apprehended if he
can. He and Colonel Gunn have been
laying some plans about it. I wish you
would apologize to Kadir Dhin. He is
sensitive, and is very much hurt.”
Having pieced into the story of the
affair the scraps with which he had not
been familiar. Chip soon took his leave.

  His meeting with Rose Maitland had
not made him as happy as he had antici-
pated.

CHAPTER X.

Reckless Villum.

WHILE you were away,” Clan
was saying to Chip, later, “I
was tempted to put over a dic-
tograph scheme that would have been
great. I met a fellow down at the sta-
tion who was agent for the things. If
I could have put one in the Duke’s
room, with concealed wires running
from it to this, we could have got at
the bottom of the rascal’s planning.
But I’d have had to bribe more than
one person, and then the problem of
getting the wires across bothered me.
So I passed it up.”

  Chip laughed.

  “So it was the bother of the wires,
and not any feeling that the thing
wouldn’t be quite a square play; but I
thought the great mechanical head you
developed while running that garage
down in Phoenix was equal to any-
thing.”

  Kess was twisting in his chair, and
his blue eyes were glistening.

  “Dot ticktograft hears vot you say
dhere, unt rebeadts idt here ?”

  “Something like that, Villum; it's a
sort of secret telephone.”

  “Uh-huh ! I standt under idt; unt idt
vouldt haf been greadt.”

No conscientious scruples, nor even

the fear of discovery, would have kept
Villum from putting the scheme over,
if he could have done it. He would
have had wires running not only to
the Duke’s room, but to Kadir Dhin’s,
and to the room of every other fellow
he suspected at present of being en-
gaged in scheming against them.

  “Vale, idt iss inderesdting,” he said,
as he got lazily out of his chair; “but
I can’t t’ink apowet idt now. I haf
got to gedt me some more ackvainted
mit Chulius Cassar.”

  Yet he was still thinking about it as
he went to his room to tackle his Latin
and follow the wanderings and battles
of Cassar.

  That night, having been out in the
village, as he was passing DicRey’s
place, on his way to the barracks, the
hour for closing the barracks being at
hand, Kess ran into a dog fight. A
pair of Airedales, one of them being
Dickey’s, opened a furious combat right
in front of him.

  Villum jumped back out of the way.
“Yiminy!” he said. “Almosdt I hadt
a toe bit off.”

  Out of Dickey’s poured a miscel-
laneous crowd, Dickey in the midst
with a pail of water, which he threw
over the fighting dogs in the hope that
it would separate them.

  When maddened Airedales come to-
gether, such gentle measures are pretty
sure to fail. Dickey was soon con-
vinced that his dog was being mur-
dered. So he got the other dog by the
hind legs and the tail and began to
yell to the squirming and clamoring mob
of spectators to help him separate the
animals by pulling them apart.

  In the background to which Kess had
retreated he was unobserved, but not
unobservant. He saw in the crowd Bully
Carson, Duke Basil, Kadir Dhin, and
—to his great surprise—Robert Realf.
Some other young fellows, wearing the
Fardale uniform, were cadets whose
homes were in the village, and who, by
FRANK MERRIWELL, .JR., AT FARDALE 43

living at home, gained greater freedom
for their evenings.

  Bully Carson could be expected to be
at Dickey’s, if in the village. Birds of
his plumage congregated there natu-
rally. But that Kadir Dhin should be
there was most unexpected.

  Dickey’s' was a place that Colonel
Gunn cordially hated, and Zenas Gale
watched with zealous and suspicious
eyes. Ostensibly it was a cigar and
periodical store, dealing also in a small
way in students’ supplies, such as writ-
ing material, and even secondhand
books. This was a cover to sales of
liquor and unlimited poker playing.
Students liked to gather there, even
those who had no relish for liquor or
gaming, on account of the freedom of
the atmosphere. Yet visits to the place
put one under suspicion and threat-
ened the displeasure of Gunn and the
Fardale faculty.

  Gunn had often spoken to the Far-
dale boys on the subject, and he had
been heard to say that whenever the
opportunity came he would “put Dickey
through.” Gale, the constable, was of
the same mind. But the opportunity
never came. For Dickey was the slick-
est cake of soap in Fardale.

  So Villum Kess was amazed to see
Gunn’s protege, Kadir Dhin, in the
crowd that swarmed out of Dickey’s
when the dog fight began.

  “Budt idt iss der ticktograft obbor-
dunity vot I am nodt oxbecting,”
thought Villum.

  Not a soul remained in Dickey’s; it
had emptied into the street, and every
person there was too busy trying to
separate the dogs, or in telling others
how it could be done, to observe or to
think of anything else. Dickey was
himself yelling orders like a village fire
chief.

  So Villum edged along the wall, and,
reaching the steps, he passed within,
then looked back to see if he had been
observed. Sure that he had not, he

  made his way hurriedly to a door at
the rear, which he found unlocked, and
entered the back room famous in Far-
dale annals as the scene of strenuous
poker games, smokefests, and drink-
ing bouts.

  There was a back door, but it was
locked, and some rooms above, to be
reached by a stairway. Also, there
were heavily blinded windows. In the
middle of the room stood a table with
a green cloth top, with chairs about it,
and above it a swinging electric light
that had a turndown attachment.
Along the walls were more chairs, with
plush lounges, and at the farther end
a couple of low cots, whereon, it was
said, Dickey stowed students and oth-
ers who had swallowed too much of
his strong liquor and were not able to
go on to the barracks or to their homes.
The strong drink Dickey was reported
to furnish was not kept here—there
was always danger of a raid; Kess had
heard it was kept buried in the cellar,
but this may not have been so. /

  As his blue eyes roved round on the
interior of the room, Villum moved to-
ward the cots at the farther end.

  "I vouldt yoost as lief been hung
for sdealing a big sheeb as a liddle
lamb; so I go me der whole hog,” he
was muttering. ‘-Uff I am foundt, der
ticktograft vill be proke, unt no more
can be saidt.”

  With a last look around, Villum
dropped to the iloor, and, with squirm-
ing jerks, stowed his rotund body un-
der one of the cots.

  Something else under there squirmed.
Villum’s hands were thrust into the face
of a man.

  "Awk!” Villum exploded, unable, in
his surprise, to suppress the sound; and
he clawed backward like a turtle, trying
to get out.

But the dog fight had been ended,
and Dickey and his friends were
streaming into the front room. Villum
did not realize that he might have joined
44

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

them there in that time of confusion
without attracting undue attention, un-
til it was too late to try it. He was
temporarily paralyzed by his discovery
of the man under the cot. Before he
recovered, some of the fellows were
entering the back room, and were sit-
ting down in the chairs by the table.

  “I am sure in a fixings,” thought
Villum, perspiring with the terror of
the thought.

  The man under the cot had moved
over as close to the wall as he could get,
but Villum still felt the touch of him;
his imagination supplying details, he
pictured a knife in the man’s hands;
and, coming on top of that, like a flash,
was the thought:

  “Idt iss der Hindu murterer, I pet
you!”

  That made Villum’s flesh creep, and
nearly popped him from under the cot.
He moved over, shivering. But he did
not leave his shelter. He would have
fared badly if he had; so in the end
he preferred to stick to the frying pan
rather than to flop out into the fire.

  Besides, Villum had slipped into the
room and shoved under that cot for the
purpose of playing dictograph, and he
was stubborn enough to want to stick
to his purpose.

  A number of guesses as to who the
man was, and why he was there, fol-
lowed Villum’s surmise that he was the
Hindu murderer; any one of them was
bad enough, if true.

  The man might be a common burglar,
who had found a chance to hide there,
and later meant to connect with Dick-
ey’s safe; if so, he was no doubt armed
with an automatic, which he would use,
if cornered. This seemed a very rea-
sonable solution.

  But Villum never hunted for reason-
able solutions, when others could be
had; so the one which appealed to his
mind most was that the man under the
cot with him was not only the Hindu
murderer, but that this cot and room

  were his usual and customary hiding
places; which indicated that Dickey
knew he was there, and received pay for
sheltering him.

  Kess and his friends had wondered
where the Hindu could keep himself so
that he would be safe and out of sight
while he matured his plans. Kess’ one
wild guess, and until now he could make
no other, was that the Hindu hid in
Kadir Dhin’s Oriental trunk. He
thought he saw now that this guess was
wrong.

  “Aber I hear all vot iss saidt, unt
am kilt as 1 am getting oudt uff here
mit idt—ach, dot vill be awvul!” Vil-
lum said to himself, as if groaning men-
tally. “Yedt anodder fighdt mighdt
come petween dhis Hindu unt der vel-
lers in der room, unt vunce again I
couldt gedt me by. So I vill vaidt, pe-
cause 1 musdt, unt vill seen vot I hear.”

  It was a long and trying wait that
followed, and it seemed much longer
than it was. Soon all chance of gain-
ing the barracks before they were closed
for the night had passed; but, then,
Villum had counted on not being able
to return to the barracks.

  Under the cot, pressed close against
the wall, the man waited as silently as
Villum. And, however much or little
he understood of the meaning of Vil-
lum’s action, he must have considered
that he found himself in a most singu-
lar position.

CHAPTER XI.

Kess as a “Dictograph.”

THE pasty-faced youth who took a
seat on the table and sat swing-
ing his legs while he fished out
of his pocket a gold-mounted cigarette
case, angrily resented the imputation of
Bully Carson.

  “Aw, cut it out!” he snarled nastily.
“My sister is too nice a girl to have
comments made about her by a low
bruiser like you 1”
FRANK MERRIWELL, JR., AT FARDALE

45

  Bully Carson’s face -flamed as red
as his necktie; the veins on his fore-
head started, his hands closed into
maullike lists, and he stepped forward;
yet instantly he checked himself, and
rattled out a wheezing laugh. He could
not afford to offend this young fellow.

  “Forget it I” he said in a tone of
hoarse apology. ‘‘I didn’t mean noth-
in’, and, of course, I knew it wasn’t so
even when I said it; I was only in a
manner suggestin’ what others may
think.”

  Robert Realf stared at him repel-
lently.

  “Since you forgot yourself, and said
that. I’ll simply explain that my sister
is visiting with Nellie Stanley, at Mrs.
Winfield’s, just as she did last winter.
You know that Bob Stanley is a stu-
dent in the academy here, and is her
brother, and both Nellie and my sister
are friends of Mrs. Winfield. Besides,
I’m down here with her. We’ve got
money to travel ’round with, and go
where we like, when we want to; more
money than you will ever see, Carson,
though you cheat and steal for a hun-
dred years.”

  "Forget it!” said Carson, though the
blood was in his face. “I didn’t mean
anything at all, as I told you. Of
course, I was too fresh.”

  Then he mumbled something about
having had a drink too much, which
was the cause of it.

  Kess was so interested that he al-
most forgot the sinister touch of the
man behind him; for Carson’s intima-
tion had been that Rhoda Realf was at
Fardale in the hope that she was here
to get to see Chip Merriwell.

  Kess knew all about the rather furi-
ous love affair between Chip and
Rhoda, which had begun down in Santa
Fe, when her wealthy father was down
there looking at mining claims, and
Chip was assisting his Uncle Dick, who
was the mine investigator. It had been
transferred to Fardale, when Chip was

there for a Christmas vacation and
Rhoda was at Mrs. Winfield’s with Nel-
lie Stanley over the Christmas holi-
days.

  The Realfs lived in Cambridge, and
Kess recalled that once, at least, Chip
had gone there, presumably to see
Rhoda. And now apparently just be-
cause another girl had come on the
scene, that pleasant affair was ended.
Or was it ended? Kess did not know.

  “Nodt for me idt vouldt nodt,” he
thought; “I haf more sfa.V-bility. Budt
uff gourse, vhen I fall in lofe mit dot
girl vhich she iss really a poy-”

  Though the flare of a quarrel was
over, the talk was still going on, and
he laid his ear to the floor to give close
heed to it.

  “Carson iss back down so kvick dhere
vill be no fighdt; he knows he musdt
be nice to gedt money oudt uff dot vel-
ler. So now vot iss nexdt?”

  Robert Realf was with that coterie,
Kess believed, for the reason that on
his previous visit to Fardale he had
been an out-and-out and violent enemy
to Chip Merriwell.

  The conversation at first was ram-
bling. There was so much smoking that
soon the air was heavy and dense; now
and then there was a clinking of glasses.
Dickey entered occasionally, but did not
tarry; though it was late, he had to
be out in front, presiding over his cigar
counter.

  It was so apparent that these fellows
had gathered solely for the sake of con-
viviality and the tang of adventure
which was a part of these forbidden
visits to Dickey’s that Kess was dis-
appointed. He seemed to be wasting
his time and taking a risk for nothing;
and the touch of that man against the
wall behind him, with the belief that
he was the Hindu murderer, armed and
deadly, was not soothing. Villum
wanted to scramble forth and announce
loudly that the Hindu was there, and
was afraid to do it.
46

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

  He became interested again when the
talk dealt with affairs at the Fardale
school. These things could not be
touched without bringing in Chip and
his friends. Kess glowed with indig-
nation as he listened.

  “Oh, Chip is merely showing a sam-
ple of the Merriwell jealousy,” said the
Duke. “Until Kadir Dhin came, he
was Gunn’s pet, and it hurts him to
lose that place.”

  “That’s the whole history of the
Merriwells at Fardale,” said another.
“They’ve got to run things. When they
can’t use a man, they try to break him.
Their friends are idiots like Clancy and
Kess, who are always willing to praise
everything they do. I’m sick of it.”
Kess began to breathe so heavily that
he was in danger of being heard, when,
by pressing his face hard against the
floor, he tried to see the face of the
speaker.

  “Idt’s yoost Avery. He ton’dt
coundt.”

  Bronson Avery was notorious as the
Duke’s echo. He, too, had come from
Brightwood the year before, with the
Duke; hence, with the older students
they were hardly considered true Far-
dale men.

  The miscellaneous gabble, filled with
envious little stabs at fellows they did
not like, brought in Chip Merriwell in-
evitably, and led slowly up to a dis-
cussion of means to get even with Chip,
or block and thwart him. The real bit-
terness of the speakers came forth.
They were wild to take Chip down and
desperate as to the means to be adopted.

  “It seems to me, donchuknow,”
drawled the Duke, “that we can easily
go farther; by which I mean, things
have turned out so that we can drive
him from Fardale.”

  “Uh-huh! So dot you can be der
headt uff der adledtic pitzness,” Villum
grumbled so recklessly in his anger that
if there had not been a good deal of
moving about and noise in the room

he would have been heard. “You
skink, dot iss alvays vot you t’ink uff
since you haf gome here!”

  “Colonel Gunn,” said the Duke, “is
beginning to get Merriwell’s right
measure. He sees that Merriwell is
trying to ruin Kadir Dhin, simply be-
cause Kadir Dhin refused to be walked
on by that crowd. The whole thing
started, you remember, when Kess in-
sultingly shouldered into Kadir Dhin,
and our friend here resented it and
tried to teach the Dutchman that he
couldn’t carry off a thing like that.
And Chip, you know, backing his chum,
proceeded to knock Kadir Dhin down
right there. It’s the Merriwell way,
don’t you know. Now lie’s trying to
ruin Kadir Dhin.”

  “That’s right,” Carson said. “I’ve
had experience, even though I ain’t in
Fardale. I went to jail once through
Chip’s blabbin’, and if he could ’a’ done
it he’d ’a’ sent me to the penitentiary.
Of course, I’ve got to keep on the right
side o’ the law, but I’d like to hit him
hard.”

  “You came back at him rather hand-
somely, donchuknow,” said the Duke,
with an air of pleasing condescension;
“but the way it ended it only gave him
a chance to make the claim that our
friend Kadir Dhin is standing in with
this mysterious Hindu, who is said to
be round here, and who is cutting up
such queer pranks, donchuknow, that
it’s hard work to believe in them.”

  “He’s been saying something new
about me?” Kadir Dhin said, flaming.

  “He says, I’m told, that this Hindu—
if the rascal really exists, and is your
uncle, I beg your pardon!—he says the
Hindu couldn’t have got hold of a Far-
dale uniform if you hadn’t assisted
him; and that he couldn’t have pulled
off that trunk trick, either, without your
aid.”

  The tense look that had come to the
face of Kadir Dhin softened, and lie
relaxed his strained attitude and
FRANK MERRIWELL, JR., AT FARDALE

dropped back into his chair. For an
instant it seemed an explosion would
come; but all he said, in a weak voice,
was:

  "Oh, well, let him talk! The more
he talks against me the more he will
hurt himself with Colonel Gunn. It’s
known everywhere that the barracks
have been burglarized and uniforms
stolen.”

  "By careful work we can create a
prejudice against him among the stu-
dents who do not like his high-and-
mighty ways, donchuknow,” the Duke
urged, “and among those who will be
inclined to sympathize with Kadir
Dhin. We can also put through some
scheme to blacken him so in the eyes
of Colonel Gunn that he will be thrown
out of Fardale.”

  "That’s right,” said Avery. “Gunn
is sore on him on account of what has
happened to Kadir Dhin. remember,
and that feeling can be increased.”
“What is this plan?” growled Car-
son. “Put it on exhibition!”

  The Duke laughed softly. He could
be very pleasant, when he dropped his
stilted manners and his air of supe-
riority.

  “A thought has just come to me”—
it had been in his mind all day—“that
if you want to make sure that Chip
Merriwell goes out of Fardale, it can
be worked by Kadir Dhin. He is quite

a hypnotist-”

  “I do very little at it—know very
little about it,” Kadir Dhin hastily cor-
rected.

  The Duke laughed again and lifted
his eyebrows in disbelief.

  “Gunn told me that this uncle of
yours who slew Miss Maitland’s father
in France was a wonderful hypnotist.
And more than once you have given
little exhibitions to amuse the fellows,
showing that you have that power to
a certain degree.”

  “I’m a mere amateur,” said Kadir
Dhin.

  “But you could put this over, donchu-
know, I’m sure. And it would be a
deathblow to Merriwell. Get him into
conversation in some quiet place and
so get hypnotic control of him. This
should be in the evening. Then stain
his face to the hue of yours, and send
him sneaking into Colonel Gunn’s under
instructions to try to kidnap Rose Mait-
land. Hypnotized, he would obey you,
and he would not remember that you
had ever even spoken to him about it.
Colonel Gunn could be posted, tipped
off to the fact, that Merriwell was to
make this effort, and that it was for
the purpose of damaging you, Kadir
Dhin ; lie could be made to think that
Merriwell, so disguised, was putting a
fake attempt over against the girl, and
intended to be seen, so that you would
be accused of it.

  “Suppose that Colonel Gunn caught
Chip Merriwell trying to do a thing
like that? What?”

  “Wow!” rumbled Carson.

  "He would last at Fardale just as
long as a snowball in August. It could
be made to appear that these other ef-
forts against the young lady had been
made by Merriwell to ruin the reputa-
tion of Kadir Dhin. Some scheme,
eh?”

  But Kadir Dhin did not rise to it.
“I’m only an amateur,” he said; “I
couldn’t do it.”

  “Well, I didn't know,” said the Duke
smoothly. “But you can see how it
would finish Merriwell. His excuses
that he didn’t know what he was doing
wouldn’t go, if Gunn were primed in
advance to expect him.”

  “Why don’t you get up a plan to beat
him to pieces?” said Carson, expressing
the bruiser in him. “Fix it so’s the
blame’ll be 011 him; and then when he
makes the crack you’ve planned for,
sail in and jest put him to sleep. Then
you've got your excuse ready, and what
can be done about it? He was the
aggressor.”

  “Same old Carson,” commented the
Duke, “always seeing blood. But that
wouldn’t get him out of Fardale.”
“You see,” said Avery, trying to
back the Duke. “Just putting him down
for a few days or so wouldn’t do; he’d
get over it and come back, and still be
cock of the walk here; that’s what the
Duke means.”

  “I’ll say what I mean, Avery,” the
Duke snapped. “I didn’t mean that.
We simply want to get rid of the Mer-
riwell influence at Fardale.”

  Avery collapsed.

  “I understand,” he said; “I beg your
pardon!”

  Kess hardly heard Carson’s words,
he was thinking so intensely of the
queer plan which the Duke had un-
folded for Kadir Dhin.

  “Uh-huh! Dot vos saidt for two
ears more; der two ears uff der Hindu
who iss pehindt me! Der Duke iss
schmardt. He iss know der Hindu is
in here. Idt vill gif dot Hindu—ouch,
his knees iss now digging in my back!
—idt vill gif him der itea uff idt. So
he vill hypnotize my friendt Chip, unt
all der resdt uff idt vill habben. I see
I got to fighdt somepoty sooner; I got
to fighdt dot Hindu who iss behint me
to-night, and cabture him, unt stob der
whole pitzness before idt sdarts. I
am glad I haf came, unt I am vishing
dot I tidn’t.”

  “Another plan that has just come to
me,” said the Duke, though he had
thought it out earlier, “is to queer Mer-
riwell with Gunn by getting him intoxi-
cated. Two or three times the fellow
has either been jagged or drugged—he
claimed he was drugged; and if this
is worked right, Gunn can be made to
believe that he was drinking at those
other times.

  “You could work that trick, Bully,
if you’d undertake it, donchuknow ; and
you could pay off some of those
grudges. Hire a couple of fellows, you
know the kind, to take Merriwell down

to the Pavilion; hand them a bottle of
liquor, and tell them they’ll be well
paid for forcing him to drink it. When
he’s good and soused let Gunn know
about it and see him in that fix. Eh,
Carson ?”

  Carson’s eyes began to shine.

  “I’d as soon do it myself as not,”
he boasted. “S’pose he claimed after-
ward that I made him drink it, would
anybody believe him ?”

  The Duke smiled indulgently.

  “You’re rather in the heavyweight
class, I admit; but could you do it
alone? Merriwell is some scrapper. If
you try it, you’d better have some com-
petent help handy. The best plan is
to send others to do it, and keep out of
sight yourself.”

  But nothing seemed to materialize.
The Duke had as many plans as he had
fingers; but always there was some-
thing, usually a question of the risk,
which kept them from full acceptance. -
“I guess there isn’t any one here with
nerve enough to go up against Merri-
well,” he said. “I’ll have to under-
take something myself.”

  “Oh, you foxy gran’pa!’ Kess was
thinking. “You know dot you ar-re
delling der veller under here mit me all
der t’ings vot he could do. Unt I haf
now got to cabture him, pefore he can.
Vhen idt cames, idt vill be anodder tog
fighdt, I pet you !”

CHAPTER XII.
A Lively Adventure.

KESS’ “tog fighdt” wasn’t up to
his expectations, either in its
manner or in its finish.

  An interminable time passed before
anything occurred, and then Villum had
to start it. The room was vacated, the
lights were out, and it was deathly cold.
Dickey had put up his shutters, locked
his doors, and had gone home. The
time was wearing on toward morning,
and still the man behind Kess under
FRANK MERRIWELL, JR., AT FARDALE 49

the cot lay there, with no more move-
ment than if lie had died or had been
turned to stone.

  Villum crawled out at last, in des-
peration. He had long been expecting
a knife in his back or a revolver shot.

  “Yoost der same I know you, uff you
ton’dt sbeak idt,” lie announced. “I haf
got a rewolver vot iss full uff bullets
to idts neck, unt uff you shoodt me I
vill shoodt you likevise undil you ar-re
deadt. So, you come oudt uff idt
kvick!”

  When the man did not come out,
nor move, nor speak, yillum solemnly
scratched a match on his trousers and
flung it, flaming, under the cot, at the
imminent risk of setting the cot and the
house on fire.

  The instant dying out of the match
was followed by an earthquake; the
light cot rose violently in air, and,
whirling over, it fell on Villum, bring-
ing him to the floor in a smother of
bed clothing.

  While he struggled to throw off the
bed coverings and mattress, Villum
heard the man unbar and fling aside a
shutter and smash a window ; they were
resounding crashes, and the breaking
of the window was accompanied by a
tinkling fall of glass.

  Yillum had rammed one foot through
the wire mesh of the bed springs, and
felt like a wolf in a trap; but he scram-
bled toward the window, where he now
saw the starlight and the man climbing
up to escape; Villum was dragging the
bed springs with him, and the greater
part of the coverings of the cot.

  “No you ton’dt escabe me!” he cried,
and made a sweeping reach with his
hands.

  Though he was thrown down by the
dragging weight of the bed springs, he
clutched the man by the coat tails, and
when, in his desperation, the man flung
himself through to the ground, one of
the tails of his coat remained in Vil-
lum’s hands.

<4A

  Compelled to free his foot before he
could do more, Villum began a furious
light with the bed springs; and by.this
he was so delayed that, when he, too,
was ready to scramble out through the
broken window the man was a hundred
yards off, running through the dark-
ness of the night.

  But Kess picked himself up pluckily
after his tumble and started in hot pur-
suit ; and, forgetting that explanations
would be demanded and would be awk-
ward to give, he began at the same time
to bellow for help.

  As lie thus plunged along in wild
chase, Villum saw another figure ap-
pear beyond the street corner; there
was a loud demand 011 the fleeing man
to halt.

  “Stop right where ye be; I’m the
constable ! Stop, I tell yeou!”

  The man whirled about and lifted his
hand; there was a pistol report and a
flash of fire.

  It was the constable who stopped,
though the bullet had not touched him;
and the man went 011, running faster
than ever.

  The sight of the constable and that
revolver play put the thought of dis-
cretion into Villum’s wild head; he
swung about as the man made off and
sprinted for the cover of the darkness
by Dickey’s.

  Gale, the constable, stood hesitating.
Here were two escaping burglars, as
he supposed, both armed and in a shoot-
ing mood. While the constable hesi-
tated, Kess got the house between him-
self and Gale and flung wildly ahead
for the protecting darkness beyond.

  Villum ran down the length of the
parade ground, then veered toward the
lake. Reflecting that he was making
telltale tracks, he turned off to the
beaten road, along which he continued
his flight. He ran until he could run
no longer.

 “Yiminy!” he panted, when he
stopped. “I am deadt! Vunce in der
50

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

house I am so coldt I am freezing,
undt now I am so mooch uff a varm-
ness dot I vandt to lay down unt valler
in der snow. Budt dot vouldt be to
gommidt susancide mit rheumonia. I
got to keeb going until I feel petter.”
Villum kept going until he reached
the boathouse. Crawling under its lee,
and making sure no one was around,
he struck another match and took a
look at the coat tail he had appropri-
ated.

  “Der goat dail uff a Fardale feller,”
he said. “Idt iss prove dot he vos der
Hindu murterer. Idt iss easy to seen
vhy he ditn’t vant der gonstable to
watch him. Sure! Kadir Dhin is sub-
blying him mit his clodings.”

  About daylight Kess made his way
into the village, where he sought shelter
with a German friend, to whom he
made suitable, though false, explana-
tions. There he had breakfast, after
he had had a few winks of sleep. As
the German did not mention the break
at Dickey’s, Kess concluded it had not
yet been noised around.

  Villum found not much difficulty in
smuggling himself, without attracting
attention, into the Fardale buildings
when the proper time came. He made
his way up to Chip’s room.

  He burst in on Chip and Clancy,
waving the tail of the coat as if it were
a banner of victory.

  “Yoost seen dot!” he said. “I haf
peen having adwentures. Fairst idt iss
a tog fighdt, unt afdher idt der tickto-
graft, unt anodder fighdt vhen der bed
sbrings holdt me by der foodt undt I
am sdopping der Hindu murterer from

gedding oudt uff der vinder, unt-”

  “Help! Help!” Chip shouted. “Take
a long breath and start over again.
What has happened?”

  “I haf!” Kess exploded, waving the
coat tail.

Breathless, he dropped into a chair.
“Idt iss der mix-oop mit der Hindu
unt der pedt springs unt eferyt’ing,

vhile I am blaying der ticktograft at
Dickey’s. Yoost you lisden vhile I ex-
blanadtion idt; but der Hindu he got
avay.”

  It was a funny story, as Kess told
it; a serious one, too, though the the-
ory that the man who had been under
the cot was the Hindu murderer seemed
incredible.

  “Who sdole der clodings oudt uff der
parracks?” Villum demanded, in an
argumentative tone.

  “We don’t know,” said Clan, who
was looking at the piece of cloth Villum
had brought in.

  “You ton’dt t’ink dot vos a Fardale
veller vot I pulled dot tail feadther
oudt uff?” said Villum.

  “N-o. Yet, we can’t say it wasn’t.”

  “You undt Chip haf been susbicion-
ing Kadir Dhin. Budt he vas in der
room dalking mit der odder vellers
vhile der man iss behint me by der vail
under der cot. You exblanadtion me
vot iss der meanness.”

 “We shan’t know much until we
know more,” said Clan.

  “Veil, vot do you t’ink uff dhem
odder t’ings?” Villum demanded, ad-
dressing Chip. “Uff you ar-re to be
hypnotized by Kadir Dhin, unt made a
indoxicadtion by Carson, unt all der
resdt uff idt, you petter be geddting
readty to meedt it, heh? Vot? Odder-
vise, vot goot do I do by running dot
riskiness uff blaying der ticktograft?”

CHAPTER XIII.

Rose and Rhoda.

THAT burglars had broken into
Dickey’s, but had been fright-
ened away by the constable, was
the story that got over town. Gale
was heard bragging of how cour-
ageously he had acted in scaring them
off, and how one of the burglars, hard
pressed, had shot at him.

  Chip Merriwell and his friends kept
their own counsel. As the days passed,
FRANK MERRIWELL, JR., AT FARDALE 51

thgy watched for the Hindu and
watched Kadir Dhin. If the fussy and
important constable were to be be-
lieved, other burglarious attempts had
been forestalled by him, and he was as
busy as a man with five hands.

  The normal routine of the academy
was for a time outwardly unbroken.
Study and lectures, winter sports, work
and play in the gymnasium, went on as
usual, under the rather rigid semimili-
tary discipline which Gunn and the fac-
ulty enforced.

  But it could be seen that the Duke
and his friends were hard at work lin-
ing up against Chip Merriwell every
man they could. The apparent result
was small. Chip had a host of friends
who were disposed to stand by him loy-
ally. And of that closer and more in-
timate band consisting of such fellows
as Clan and Kess, Jelliby and others,
that they would stand by Chip through
thick and thin on any and every occa-
sion, was, of course, known to every
one.

  Some hockey matches on the cleared
ice of the lake were exciting enough
to thrill the whole school and bring a
mob of spectators out from the village.
Twice Chip led scrub teams against the
regular Fardale team, once going to
victory and another time to defeat.

  That Rhoda Realf and her brother
were at Fardale Chip knew from Kess’
report; and it was not long before he
met them. Chilled a bit by Rose Mait-
land’s championship of Kadir Dhin,
Chip was in a mood to be moved again
by the beauty and charm of the younger
and slighter girl.

  Yet, having a good memory, Chip
could not forget even while he was out
on the lake in the full swing of enjoy-
ment, skating, with Rhoda Realf. that
whatever break there had ever been be-
tween them had been produced solely
because he could not endure the insuf-
ferable qualities of Rhoda’s brother.

  But when Chip went over to Gunn’s

for a talk with Rose Maitland on the
subject which was constantly in her
mind—her fears of the Hindu who had
slain her father and who was believed
by herself and Gunn to be in conceal-
ment at Fardale—the feeling again
mastered him which had swayed him
when he first saw her.

  ‘T could wish you were an Amer-
ican,” he said, as he talked and jested
with her; "and I don’t say that because
I hold any feeling whatever against the
English. Now 1 have offended? I’m
sure I didn’t intend it, and beg your
pardon.”

  She had flushed; but a slight height-
ening of the color in her cheeks made
her only the more charming.

  “It’s no offense,” she said. “You
see, how can it be, when I am half
American. I didn’t know but Colonel
Gunn had told you. My mother was
an American, from Baltimore. That is
why I was so willing to come to Amer-
ica. And 1 mean to visit Baltimore as
soon as I can.”

  From this agreeable topic, the talk
switched to the Hindu and Kadir Dhin,
a change inevitable, as that had been
Chip’s reason, or excuse, for making
this call.

  “Colonel Gunn is sure that Gunga
Singh, the man who slew my father,
is still here, and that he is committing
these burglaries,” she reported. “Colo-
nel Gunn believes he has found refuge
with some of the low foreigners in the
mill sections, and is burglarizing that
he may have money to pay for conceal-
ment. He says, too, that Dickey would
keep him, would keep any scoundrel,
for money. I feel as if I were sitting
on a volcano. I don’t go out any more.”

  Then she spoke again of Kadir Dhin,
declaring that it was too bad the young
Hindu's career at Fardale had been
shadowed as it was.

  She added:

  “It has come to Colonel Gunn, and
he resents it, that you have been hint-
52

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

ing that perhaps Kadir Dhin isn’t so
innocent as he seems—that he has been
helping Gunga Singh.”

  Chip had more than hinted that to
his friends—but only to his friends;
and he had believed it. He thought he
had reasons for believing it.

  “Somebody must be a mind reader,”
he said.

  “You didn’t say it?”

  “I said it to Clancy and Kess and
perhaps one or two more.”

  “So it wouldn’t need mind reading
to get out. You have wronged Kadir
Dhin. I wish you would apologize to
him. You haven’t apologized to him?”
“No—not yet,” said Chip. “I may,
in time.”

  Chip parried this subject off as well
as he could. He was again too much in
love with this girl to want anything like
disagreement to come between them.
Yet he was in no mood to apologize to
the young Hindu. His belief was grow-
ing that Kadir Dhin was tricky; that
he was imposing on the confidence of
Colonel Gunn and Rose Maitland. He
wanted proof of it, and meant to try
to get it. So how could he go to Kadir
Dhin and say to the young Hindu that
he thought he had wronged and was
wronging him? It had to be parried
off. It was a dangerous subject.

  There were ever so many pleasanter
things to talk about, and Chip contrived
to bring them forward; so that when
he took his leave, it was with a sense
of having had a pleasant time and of
having made a good impression.

  “I wonder if I am fickle-minded?”
he thought, as he walked away, his mind
turning to Rhoda Realf. “No. 1 don’t
think I am. I like Rhoda—she’s fine;

but Rose Maitland-”

  Then he thought of Kadir Dhin.

  “I can’t get it out of my nut that he
is playing a double game. Of course,
if he isn’t, and T see that he isn’t, I’ll
apologize to him, and do it freely;
though I’m afraid I can never like him.”

CHAPTER XIV.

When the Plot Went Wrong.

DEAR me ! Dear me!” said Colonel
Gunn, twisting his glasses about
on his nose, as he stared in as-
tonishment at the crumpled note which
had been brought to him by the servant
girl.

  The colonel had arrived at home late,
having remained at the academy look-
ing over some examination papers.

  This is what his eyes rested on, and
why he exclaimed and stared :

  Colonel Gunn : The scandalous doings of
some of your students is the limit. They
drink and gamble right under your nose, and
you don’t know it. I f you want proof, go
down to the Pavilion right now. You will
find Chip Merriwell there, intoxicated, so
much so that he can’t get back to the bar-
racks. There has been a drinking bout down
there, which has lasted ever since Fardale
let out its students for the day. When the
others left the Pavilion, they had to leave
Merriwell there because he couldn’t walk.
You ought to know about this.

A Fardale Well-wisher.

  Colonel Gunn did not like anonymous
communications. But here was some-
thing he could not overlook. It called
for attention and action.

  He rang for the servant.

  “Mary,” he said, his voice hoarse and
shaky, “will you—er—be kind enough
to inform me where you—ahum—got
this singular note which you brought
me ?”

  “At the dure,” said Mary; “a b’y
brought it. He said it was fer you, and
I’m sure yere name was on it.”

 “My name was on it—very true.
Ahem—you did not recognize the boy?”

  “I niver saw his face befure.”

 “Ahum—thank you, Mary. If you
will help me 011 with my greatcoat, I
—ahum-”

  Mary helped him get into his over-
coat ; and, with his cane in hand, Colo-
nel Gunn sallied forth. The unpleas-
ant note was in his pocket.

“A—er—a distressing thing,” he
FRANK MERRIWELL, JR., AT FARDALE

53

was thinking. “Until recently I have
thought so well of young Merriwell!
1 fear he will never be the man his
father was. Dear me, the pranks that
fellow used to cut here; he, too, was
quite wild! Nevertheless, there was a
saving grace in him ; a—er—thought-
fulness. I was younger then, too; and
my dear father, Zenas Gunn, of blessed
memory—yes, the older Merriwell an-
noyed him a great deal.”

  The night was falling, and the early
lights of the village were shining. There
were no lights to-night on the lake,
unless carried by some skater, and
Gunn’s way lay in that direction, along
the lake to the Pavilion.

  The colonel reflected that he ought to
have company, and was on the point of
turning aside and telephoning for the
constable; but was deterred by the
thought that he ought not to expose a
student in that way, even though the
student deserved exposure.

  “By going alone I may be able to
prevent a scandal. Yet—er—of course,
Mr. Merriwell will have to leave the
academy; I—ahum—see no other way.
I shall write to his father a full ex-
planation ; tell him that recently there
has—er—been a great change in his
son; I shall have to speak of this vio-
lent animosity against the youth, Kadir
Dhin, who came here as a foreigner
and stranger, under—er—my protec-
tion. Such base calumnies as Kadir
Dhin assures me young Merriwell has
heaped on him—there is even an ele-
ment of insanity in it! Is the whole
world going mad?”

  The worthy head of Fardale grew
warm with indignation as he stumped
along, prodding the snow angrily with
his walking stick.

  “As for Gunga Singh, Kadir Dhin
thinks that the money I have been fur-
nishing him for the purpose of hiring
men to hunt down that Hindu murderer
will soon bring results. I—ahum—I
hope so; I hope so! It is growing

very expensive. If results are not at-
tained soon I shall—ahum—be com-
pelled to desist in making further ad-
vances. A terrible state of affairs!
And the—er—constable makes no prog-
ress.”

  His mind turned back to Chip Merri-
well.

  “A drinking bout of Fardale students
down at the Pavilion, and Mr. Merri-
well left there in so beastly a state of
intoxication that he cannot even walk.
Dreadful!”

  A merry jingling of sleigh bells
reached him, as he approached the lake,
in the road which turned there and
passed along the lakeside toward the
Pavilion; the sleigh was coming up be-
hind him, and it seemed that Gunn
would be run down by the horses.

  He gave a skipping jump which must
have surprised him and landed in the
snow at the side of the road.

  “Ahum ! Dear me! How very reck-
less ! A lot of hoodlums from the vil-
lage, no doubt; and very probably
intoxicated. What is the—er—world
coming to ?”

  Then the colonel discovered that the
sleigh was filled with young fellows
who were, nearly all of them, in the
Fardale uniform. They had been
laughing; but they drew up beside him
and fell silent with respect.

  This show of deference pleased him;
he was especially gratified when he saw
their hands go up in the military' salute.

  “Are you going far, Colonel Gunn?”
he was asked, with politeness.

  “Ahum! Er—that is to say-”

  They were leaping out of the sleigh,
surrounding him.

  “We arc out for a drive down the
road here; beautiful night, isn’t it? If
you’re going far, we offer you a seat
in with us. The sleighing is delightful.
It will honor us.”

  Colonel Gunn was flattered and flus-
tered.

 “I was—er—
54

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

  “Then, right in! Here is a good seat.
We’re going to drive down by the Pa-
vilion, and beyond; and then back to
Fardale by the other road. It will be a
lovely ride.”

  They had him by the arms, still try-
ing to be courteous, though in reality
they had literally taken possession of
him; and before the colonel could say
whether he wished to go in the sleigh
or did not wish to, he was in it, sinking
back in the seat.

 “Er—er- Ahaw—ahum ! This is

aw- 1 have lost my stick in the

snow there, 1 believe.”

  It was rescued and passed up to him.
The young fellows were climbing in
beside and behind him; and to keep him
from wanting to get out, the driver
quietly touched up the horses and sent
them dancing along, jingling their bells.

 “Ahaw—ahum ! I—er-”

  Gunn looked around him.

  In the faint light, he recognized his
companions; he saw Bronson Avery
clearly, for Bronson sat beside him, and
had been one of the politest. Behind
him he heard familiar voices. He was
displeased on discovering one of the
voices to be Bully Carson’s; he de-
tested and suspected Carson.

  “I shall have to speak to these boys
about Carson,” he thought, as he tried
to get a grip on his scattered faculties.

  “Ahum!” he coughed, and touched
the driver on the arm. “I shall—er—
be obliged if you will put me off in the
road near the—er—the Pavilion. From
there I shall—er—walk back. This is
—er—very pleasant, but on a night like
this—so glorious—I prefer to walk; so

if you, er-”

  “Oh, we’ll put you off at the Pa-
vilion,” was the significant statement
with which he was reassured.

  But when the road by the ice was
reached, the fellows in the sleigh with
Gunn were given a surprise that was as
great as Gunn’s.

  Chip Merriwell, skating on the ice
there with Clan and Kess and some
others, had stopped at the edge of the
ice, curious to see the sleigh go by; not
dreaming who its occupants were.

  Chip was recognized by the fellows
in the sleigh, and by the driver, who
gave a little ejaculation of amazement
and drew hard on the reins, bringing
the horses to a stop.

  “Merriwell 1” he said, gasping the
name.

  Gunn, electrified, craned his neck;
and Chip, thinking himself addressed,
stepped into the road, walking on his
skates toward the sleigh.

  “It is—er—it is Mr. Merriwell!”
Gunn exploded. “This—er—this is
you, Mr. Merriwell?”

  Chip saluted; and Clan and the
others, coming up behind him, repeated
the action.

  “Yes, sir,” said Chip.

  “But you—er—were—that is to say
can it-”

  “Yes, sir?”

  Colonel Gunn tumbled out of the
sleigh—almost fell out—in his amaze-
ment. lie hooked his glasses on his
nose and stared at Chip. He saw that
Chip was steady-limbed, clear-eyed, and
sober.

  “Hello!” one of the fellows ex-
claimed suddenly, with a startled em-
phasis that drew attention. “What’s
that mean? The Pavilion’s on fire!”

  A flame had flashed from a window
in the lakeside building some distance
down the road, and by the light of it
two men were seen running away over
the snow.

CHAPTER XV.

Cowardice and Heroism.

THE two men who sat at the table
in the front room overlooking

pair as Bully Carson could have picked
up anywhere, and they were not dis-

posed to heed the young fellow who lay
bound on the floor by the door.

  “Le’s carry him upstairs, Bill, and
shet him in that back room, where he
can’t make himself heard by anybody
passin’ ’long the road; we either got
to do that or gag him.”

  “But—see here! You’re making an
awful mistake, donchuknow! I’m not
the fellow you were told to get, donchu-
know. This is a hideous mistake, fel-
lows.”

  It was the Duke who was making this
piteous appeal.

  But he had little hope that it would
be heeded, since up to this time he had
not been listened to and had been given
such shameful treatment; moreover,
there was small hope that he would be
rescued soon by his friends. The Pa-
vilion had been chosen by him because
he knew it was far down the lake and
isolated.

  It was a lakeside place of entertain-
ment, unoccupied in the winter as a
rule. The previous winter the Duke
had hired it, and it was understood he
had some sort of occupancy claim on
it this winter.

  The men were still disposed to be
rough with him.

  “We’ve heard all we want out of
you,” he was told; “so, shet up! You
was pointed out to us plain.”

  “By Bully Carson?”

  “No matter about that. Here, Bill;
we’ll put him upstairs. Either that, or
we got to gag him.”

  They took him upstairs and locked
him in the little room, just as he was.
Then they went back to the lower room,
with its table, its'pack of cards, and the
bottle of whisky that was on it.

  That whisky had been furnished by
Bully Carson; and their prisoner, ac-
cording to Carson’s directions, was to
be drugged with it; but they liked the
taste and smell of the liquor too wrell
to waste it in that way; they meant to
drink it themselves.

  Sitting down at the table again, they
sampled the- contents of the bottle and
applied themselves to the cards; the day
was at its close, and they fancied them-
selves in the greatest security for an
hour or more.

  Acting up to Bully Carson's instruc-
tions, they had waylaid the Fardale
cadet as he came swinging up the lake
on his skates, not long before. They
thought they knew him; Carson had
pointed him out to them, so they were
sure there was no mistake, even when
he declared there was.

  They had made their mistake natu-
rally. The Duke had been standing
close by Chip Merriwell, on a street
corner, when Carson had indicated the
latter; they had simply looked at the
wrong man when Carson was talking.

  They knew what was expected of
them. When they had forced intoxica-
tion on their prisoner, they were to
depart, and leave him in the Pavilion,
to be seen there by Colonel Gunn and
any others who chanced to be with the
colonel.

  They found the cards interesting, and
the liquor more so. They had not in-
tended to light the lamp they found on
the table; but decided to do so when
their caution became less active. They
couldn’t see to play without a light, and
stakes were then on the table.

  How long they played they did not
know, but they went very speedily to
the bottom of the liquor bottle. They
began to quarrel, each accusing the
other of cheating. Drawing a knife,
one lunged at the other with it, across
the table; the other rose and flung back
to avoid the blow.

  The table was overturned with a
crash, and the lamp went to the floor;
it shattered, and the kerosene caught
from the burning wick. In a moment
the room was filled with flames.

  Stunned for an instant by what
threatened, they made a feeble attempt
56

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

to fight out the fire; then they threw
open the door, and, running out into the
road, they fled.

  In the froom into which he had been
flung, the Duke had been trying to get
the cords off his wrists; he was in a
vile temper. He piled anathemas on
Bully Carson and on the men down-
stairs. If Carson had not been a fool,
and chosen fools for this work, this
mistake could not have been made. He
had planned it and given Carson the
money to carry it out, and this was
the result. He had come skating down
the lake, wondering how near he could
be to the Pavilion and be safe when the
trick was pulled off; and the ruffians
had seized him, instead of the one
chosen, who was Chip Merriwell.

  The treatment he was receiving was
meant for Chip.

  What made his fate more bitter was
his belief that there had been a clever
turning against him of the tables; he
thought the ruffians had been tampered
with by Chip after Carson had hired
them, and that this was done deliber-
ately by them, for pay. So he heaped
his curses on Chip as well as on Carson
and the two stupid fools.

  Then came the fire, and the terror it
conveyed to the occupant of the upper
room.

  He heard the quarreling below, then
the crashing of the overturned table
and the yells of the men when they
tried to stay the fire. He heard them
throw the door open and run away like
the cowards they were, forgetful of him
and of his fate.

  The Duke screamed with fear when
he heard them go.

  For a moment the terror of his situ-
ation almost overcame him ; he felt sick
and faint, his heart pounded up until
it seemed almost in his throat; a pan-
icky fear clouded his mind.

  This passed. There was some cour-
ageous fiber in the Duke. He had been

spoiled in his training; he was always
made to think he was finer and better
than any one else, was always petted
and flattered, and constantly treated by
servants and even friends as if he were
a superior being. If there had not been
some good stuff in the Duke, he would
have been far worse than he was at
present.

  As soon as he could control his jump-
ing nerves, the Duke tried again to get
free of the cords that held his wrists;
but he could not do it. He could not
break the cords, and struggling only
drew the knots tighter.

  Rolling over against the door, he
drew up his legs and began to dash his
heels against the panels, trying to break
through.

  The fire was roaring so that he could
l'.ear it plainly when he was not making
too much noise, and the smoke that had
begun to creep through the rooms
readied him.

  ‘‘Help!” he screamed, as he ham-
mered with his heels against the door.
“Help! Help!”

  That some one passing in the road
well out beyond might hear him, was
his hope. He was beginning to hope,
too, that the fire would be seen in the
village in time for fire fighters to get
out to it before it had made a finish
of him.

  As if in answer to his calls, he soon
heard the jingling approach of a sleigh,
and from the sound of the bells he could
tell that the horses were galloping.

  The fire had reached the stairway
which led to the room where the Duke
lay; he could see, under the door, the
fiery licking of red tongues of flame,
as gusts of air drove the flames higher;
and now the smoke, getting into his
room more and more, was troublesome,
and threatened soon to be suffocating.

  He was yelling himself hoarse, bawl-
ing for help to the occupants of the
sleigh. When he heard them shouting
FRANK MERRIWELL, JR., AT FARDALE 57

to each other outside in the snow, his
screams to attract their attention be-
came screeches.

  lie had been heard; he could soon
tell that.

  At the same time it was being said
that 110 one could get up to the second
floor; there were no ladders to be had,
and the stairs were on fire.

  Some one jingled away in the sleigh,
going to the village to get ladders; the
others, it seemed, were waiting for the
ladders, or for the coming of the Far-
dale fire department.

  The Duke knew that before the slow-
moving local fire department could get
there, or the sleigh return with ladders,
he would be beyond the need of aid.

  “Help!” he screamed.

  His feet, flailing, could not shatter
the stout panels of the door.

  A little later, when the hot breath
of the fire seemed trying to reach
through the door to him, he heard a
voice. It was followed by a crash that
drove the door inward.

  Chip Merriwell, head and shoulders
wrapped round with a sleigh robe
soaked in melted snow, groped into the
room; he had come through the fire-
filled stairway with it round him; he
had dared the fury of the flames to
reach and help the Duke, when Carson
and Avery, and all the Duke’s own fol-
lowers, refused the risk, claiming that
whoever tried it would be burned to
death. The stairs were like a furnace.

  ‘‘There’s the hall yet,” Chip gasped.
“Here!”

  “My feet and hands are tied!” the
Duke shouted.

  Chip got his knife out and cut the
cords.

  “Here!” he panted. “Can you walk?

I'll help you. Pull your coat up around
your head. The hall here is free yet,
and we can reach one of the windows.”

  “It’s Merriwell!” said the Duke,
bewildered.

  He had been thinking Chip had sent
him there, and he wondered about this;
yet it was dull wonder, and a very ac-
tive thankfulness. No one rejects the
hand that is stretched out to save.

  He did not need Chip’s aid ; he even
scrambled ahead, along the hall, driven
by fear; and he was at one of the win-
dows, smashing it. when Chip came up.
He was about to throw himself out
through the window.

 “No!” said Chip. “We can take
time; we’re safe now, unless the house
falls. The fire is following, but we’re
well ahead of it here. I’ve got the driv-
ing lines from the sleigh for ropes.”

  He pushed the Duke through, after
passing a length of the leather reins
around the Duke’s body, under his
arms, and hung to the loops he had set,
while the Duke slid downward to the
ground.

  Securing the lines to the support of
a wall bracket, Chip Merriwell fol-
lowed and dropped; but the sleigh robe
and his clothing smoked from the heat.

  “Burned much, Chip?” some one was
asking, as he reeled into the arms that
were stretched out to assist him.

  “No.” he gasped; “I—I think not; I
think I’m all right!”

  “Well, it sure was close; you didn’t
have much time! The old Pavilion is
going.”

  Ten minutes later it was a flaming
tinder box, with a tornadolike roar as
the fire drove skyward, and a glare that
reddened the snow for great distances
around.

SYNOPSIS OF PRECEDING CHAPTERS.

AFTER a seventeen-hour ride in pursuit of Jim Cowley, a crook, who has cheated a
settler named Ballard, "Big Ben” Stewart, of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police,
arrives at his home, where he finds his father, Dugald Stewart, and his younger brother,
Denis. After resting, Ben takes up the pursuit, but is wounded and returns home. Denis
dons his brother’s uniform and takes up Cowley’s trail. The "substitute trooper” meets
with various exciting adventures, and is eventually made a prisoner by Cowley and Smok-
ing Duck, a Cree Indian. Stewart is removed to Cowley's camp, where he is left in
charge of Smoking Duck. He succeeds in making his escape, and, without weapons, he
continues his flight. He meets Napoleon McShayne, a French Canadian, in whose com-
pany Stewart encounters Bray, a fur trader, who is on his way to Cowley’s camp on Hay
Lake. From the trader Stewart learns that Cowley has been purchasing an unusually
large amount of corn. Stewart orders Bray to return to Fort Vermilion. A plan is
arranged with McShane to secure Stewart’s canoe and rifle, which had been left on the
river bank when Stewart was captured. The trooper swims the river, and while he stands
drying himself and clothing over a fire, two canoes appear on the river, -which prove to
be occupied by Ballard and his friends, all of whom are in search of Cowley. The set-
tlers have made up their minds to deal with Cowley in their own way, without the inter-
ference of the law. During the night Stewart escapes from Ballard’s camp, and makes
his way to the point where he is to meet Napoleon McShayne.

CHAPTER XII.
Tightening Up.

LOSE beside his tiny signal
  fire, Denis waited there in
  the night. As he watched,
  he remembered one thing
  to which he had given lit-
  tle thought.

   This was that Cowley
was going to the foot of
the lakes some time that same night to
meet Dray. Presumably Cowley would
not start until an hour or so before
dawn. But what w'ould happen when
he reached the foot of the lake?

“He’ll take Ballard’s camp fire for
that of Bray,” mused Denis, frowning.

“When he gets close up, lie’ll discover
his mistake and put for home. Then
I'll be there to nab him—if nothing hap-
pens. Well, no use gathering trouble
till the time comes.”

  Perhaps half an hour later, Denis
sighted a dark blur on the lake, and
heard a low hail. He flung a few scraps
of birch bark on the fire, allowed them
to blaze up until he himself was fully
revealed; then he stamped out the fire
and scattered it.

  Waiting at the edge of ti.: shore, lie
presently saw' two craft come gliding
in. The first was Napoleon’s dugout,
with Napoleon himself wielding his
clumsy paddle. Towing after this was
TROOPER STEWART, SUBSTITUTE

(he light canoe which Denis had left at
the head of the lake on his unfortunate
attempt to arrest Cowley.

  “B’jou’!” came the half-breed’s voice.
“I got heem. What you do dat man
Bray, huh?”

  “I took care of him, all right,” said
Denis, smiling. "He’s gone back to
Fort Vermilion, and you’ll find your
camp waiting as you left it. When
you’re at the fort, go in to Bray’s store
and he'll settle with you for whatever
grub he used.”

  The ’breed grunted deep satisfaction
at this information. Denis pulled in the
canoe. To his delight, he found his
duffel bag, blankets, and the rifle ex-
actly as he had left them.

  "Mebbeso you make for pay?” sug-
gested Napoleon diffidently.

  Denis reflected.

  “The man Bray sent you to find—the
man named Cowley—has a camp half-
way up this shore.” he returned. “I’m
going to arrest him. Also a ’breed
named Petwanisip. Cowley has some
fine pelts up there, and you can have
your pick. Want to come along?”

  This did not strike Napoleon's fancy.
“Mebbeso I come back. I'm want
for sleep now,” he said, which was a lie,
since he had probably slept all the pre-
ceding afternoon, after reaching the
head of the lake. “Huh? Mebbeso I
come back dere to-morrow.”

  Denis chuckled.

  “There’s a bunch of four white men
down at the foot of the lake,” be re-
joined. “They have rifles, and they'll

be up here to-morrow-”

  That was enough for Napoleon, who
grunted deep:

  “Mebbeso I go ’way quick, whatever.
Got um pain in belly. Want for sleep.
Mebbeso I come back, mebbeso not.
Whatcheer!”

  He edged his dugout toward the lake
shadows. Denis laughed, glad to be rid
of the fellow, who would be of no use
in a fight.

  “Run along, then, ’Poleoii. You
come back to-morrow afternoon, and
the coast will be clear, 1 think. Then
I’ll pay you—and pay you pretty well,
too. Don’t come later than that, but
come then sure. Sure?”

  “Huh! Sure !” was the answer. Na-
poleon would keep his word also—to
the police.

  Denis watched the dark, slim shape
of the dugour float out into the night
and disappear into a speck under the
starlight. Then he turned to his own
canoe, and, with a feeling of deep re-
lief. knelt once more on his blankets
and took up his paddle, the rifle ready
to hand. Ballard's canoe he left on the
bank.

  To land at Cowley's Creek about
dawn would be time enough for his
purposes. He could let Cowley go to
the foot of the lake—probably to return
faster than he had gone. In the mean-
time he could arrest Smoking Duck and
make an investigation.

  That was an important point—the
investigation. Besides the original
charge against Cowley, and that of re-
sisting arrest, the police must know
what the man was doing here, how he
had gained possession of so much fur,
and just what kind of an illegal game
was forward. It might be that he was
simply dealing out whisky without a
permit, which was in itself a grave of-
fense in a land where the vanishing In-
dians are protected by laws of iron
against such men as Cowley.

  With ten miles to travel against a
steadily increasing headwind, and three
hours in which to cover it, Denis fell
into a steady, even stroke that he could
keep up for days on end if need were.
Keeping close to shore, he worked his
way gradually along up the lake, notic-
ing a perceptible increase in the wind
as the night wore onward.

  When the stars began to dim and die,
and the grayness of dawn slowly lifted
the darkness, Denis ran to the beach
GO

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

and landed. It was vital that he make
no mistake now, and he must be sure
of his ground before going ahead.

  For half an hour he lay on the bank,
watching and waiting. Then an excla-
mation of satisfaction broke from him.
Through the lifting gray dawn light he
could discern the hills a half mile far-
ther along the shore, where Cowley’s
camp was located. Sweeping the waters
of the lake with his eyes, he then caught
a moving speck halfway across, in line
between the hills and the foot of the
lake, and moving toward the latter.

  Cowley was well 011 his way down the
lake!

  “Looks as though things were break-
ing my way at last,” thought Denis, as
he scrambled down the steep bank to
his canoe. “Now I think that I’ll have
a little surprise for Mr. Smoking Duck
before he gets through his breakfast.”

  Save for the cartridges which The
Pigeon had expended, the Winchester
rifle had a full magazine. Certain of
this, Denis pumped in a fresh cartridge,
knelt in the canoe, placed the rifle in
front of him, and shoved out.

  Now he paddled swiftly, putting all
his strength into the work. I11 a short
fifteen minutes he found himself lying
outside the almost concealed creek en-
trance. Into this he headed, scanning
the bushes and trees ahead for any sign
of Smoking Duck.

  No danger threatened, however.
Without sighting a moving thing, he
reached the log landing, jumped out,
and lifted his canoe from the water.
Then, rifle in hand, he stepped out on
the trail to the shack.

  Five minutes later, he was standing
at the edge of the clearing, eying that
odd cluster of buildings. From the
chimney of the shack itself 110 smoke
ascended, but from what seemed to be
the lean-to just behind, a thin trail of
wispy smoke was winding into the sky.

  “That must be the ‘fire’ to which
Cowley referred,” thought Denis,

frowning. “If Smoking Duck isn’t
asleep, he’s probably around there in
back.”

  Hesitating no longer, he went across
the clearing at a run, half expecting a
rifle shot from the silent shack front.
None came. Reaching the door of the
shack, he peered inside and found the
place empty, but from the back came
the regular strokes of an ax!

  Slipping around the side wall of the
shack, to the right, Denis passed the
lean-to which held the baled peltries.
At the corner he paused, cocking his
rifle, then stepped out around the end.

  A dozen feet away stood Petwanisip,
leaning on an ax; even that cocking of
the rifle had attracted the half-breed's
attention. Denis covered the man in-
stantly.

  “Hands up, Smoking Duck!”

  Smoking Duck stared as if at an
apparition. Then he cast a wild glance
around, and Denis saw a rifle leaning
against the wall. But it was three
yards distant, and not even the des-
perate half-breed dared risk it. His
hands rose slowly.

  Each lean-to adjoined the other, here
at the back. To the left of the rifle
was a low doorway, near which Smok-
ing Duck had been throwing the wood
as he had cut it. Denis observed that
this was firewood.

  “Go to the left of that door, stand
with your face to the wall, and stick
your hands out behind your back!”
commanded Denis.

  There was a snap to his voice that
spelled earnestness. His brown face
convulsed with helpless rage, the half-
breed did as Denis had ordered. Ad-
vancing to the man, Denis stuck his
rifle in Petwanisip’s back.

  “Be mighty careful, now—this gun
is cocked!”

  With one hand he unlaced his moc-
casins, knotted the lacing, and drew it
about the swarthy wrists. Then he set-
down his rifle, and in a few seconds
TROOPER STEWART, SUBSTITUTE

G1

had knotted the buckskin thongs
stoutly. Smoking Duck was trapped
beyond escape.

  ‘‘Walk around to the front of the
cabin.”

  Driven by that relentless rifle, the
sullen half-breed led the way around
the shack to the door. Denis ordered
him on inside, and so to the same little
room where he himself had been con-
fined. Removing the fellow’s knife, he
locked him in the inner room.

  “Things are certainly coming fine
for me!” he reflected, as from Cowley’s
stores he replaced his moccasin lacing.
“Now we’ll begin our investigations—
and I’d better start right here.”

  Ben’s Ross service rifle was in a rack,
as was' the revolver with its lanyard.
Denis gladly took back these weapons,
and found Cowley’s revolver hanging
to a nail. No other rifle was in evi-
dence, however, and he conjectured that
Cowley had not gone forth unarmed.
This, however, he had expected.

  Leaving Smoking Duck locked up
safely, Denis sallied forth on his tour
of inspection. First he visited the lean-
to at the right, and in this he found a
few sacks of corn, together with sev-
eral sacks marked “Beans” and “Pota-
toes.” A slash with his knife showed
that all these were filled with corn.

  “So Cowley has been importing all
the corn he could, under every disguise
possible!” thought Denis, looking down
at the sacks. “The question is, why?
In about two minutes your little game
will be up, my friend!”

  As he closed the rude door of the
lean-to and stepped out into the early-
morning sunshine, he paused suddenly.
The night wind had died away; the
morning was perfectly calm and clear.
He stood motionless, listening—and the
sound came again. It was a distant but
still recognizable rifle crack. A third
sounded instantly, then two or three
shots came almost together. After that,
silence.

  “That’s Cowley and Ballard!”
thought Denis, his blue eyes narrowing.
“If they haven't got him, he’ll be back
presently. If they have—then it’s up
to me to arrest Ballard’s crowd. By
Tasper, I don’t like this business a lit-
tle bit!”

  No further sounds of conflict reached
him. While he could sympathize with
Ballard and the latter’s friends, he
knew perfectly well that he must arrest
them if they had killed Cowley. He
was representing Big Ben Stewart, and
his uniform typified the law, and Ben
would be held responsible for the up-
holding of the law.

  Frowning uneasily, he passed on
around the corner of the log structure,
and again came to where he had found
Smoking Duck at work. Pie stepped to
the doorway, set down his rifle beside
that of the half-breed, and entered the
mysterious lean-to.

  This proved to be unlighted save by
the door, and for a moment his eyes
could not pierce the semidarkness.
Then, as he saw what manner of place
this was, an exclamation of slow sur-
prise broke from his lips.

  “By Jasper! And to think that I
never even suspected it—and dad was
the closest guesser of all!”

  To either side of him were piled
small kegs, and above these were neat
rows of glass half-pint flasks, precisely
similar to that which he had found on
the person of The Pigeon a few days
previously. About half of them were
filled with a white liquid, and the subtle
odor of whisky which pervaded the
room betrayed the nature of that liquid.
But Denis merely noted these things in
passing—his gaze, was riveted on what
lay beyond, across the room from him.

  There, with a small fire still burning,
was a complicated arrangement of
metal which he did not understand at
all, but whose usage was quite evident
to him. He had seen pictures of stills
before this, and knew at once that he
62

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

had solved the mystery of Cowley’s
corn and trading and illegal work.
Every detail lay clear before him.

 Here on Hay Lake, hundreds of
miles from anywhere, Cowley had lo-
cated a private whisky distillery. From
Fort Vermilion to the summer Hudson
Bay Post, farther down the Hay, he
had brought up corn under various dis-
guises, to avert possible suspicion, and
had calmly proceeded to manufacture
his own whisky and trade it to the In-
dians in the neighborhood.

  “This is going the whisky-running
game one better, all right 1” exclaimed
Denis, as he eyed the place. “Well, my
job is clear—so here goes !”

  Stepping outside, he took up Smok-
ing Duck’s ax and reentered. First
drawing what was left of the fire and
carefully stamping it out, he then
waded into the still, ripping the copper
worm and everything else into useless
shreds of metal. He did his work thor-
oughly and left nothing undestroyed.

  Then he turned his attention to the
kegs and bottles. The latter he smashed
where they were; the former he rolled
out into the yard. Ten of the kegs
were full of whisky, and these he
smashed in and emptied. Satisfied at
length that the whole affair had been
destroyed, with the exception of one
flask to be used as evidence if neces-
sary, he wiped his dripping face and
took up the two rifles.

  “Here’s a good morning's work for
Ben, anyhow!” he muttered happily.
“Now I’d better prepare my little re-
ception committee for Mr. Cowley—or
Ballard. I wonder which will come?”

CHAPTER XIII.

Cowley Cries “Enough!”

FROM the front of the shack, the
lake was, of course, hidden by the
intervening hill. Denis remem-
bered that the presence of his canoe
would warn Cowley if the latter ar-

rived in flight from Ballard, and struck
off to the creek at a sharp trot.

  Once here, he went on to the edge
of the lake, and scrambled through the
bushes to a vantage point. And here
his mental question was answered in-
stantly.

  A scant quarter mile away was a
canoe bearing a single paddler—evi-
dently Cowley. The canoe was heading
for the creek entrance, and was trav-
eling fast. A mile or more behind it
was another canoe bearing four men,
and for a moment Denis eyed them,
wondering why they did not catch up
with Cowley. Then he laughed shortly.

  “Overloaded, by Jasper! All four
of ’em in her, and she must be right
down to the water, so they don’t dare
put on speed. This simplifies things for
me, then.”

  So, apparently, it did, since Cowley
was coming squarely into the trap. At
the moment it did not occur to Denis
that Ballard’s arrival might bring him
a new problem, and the most difficult
one which he had yet faced.

  Returning to the log landing, he
picked up his canoe and carried it a
dozen yards away, placing it among the
bushes, where the hurrying Cowley
would never notice it. This done, he
made his way back to the shack.

  With his Ross rifle under his arm,
he set the other weapons out of reach
in a corner. A glitter on the floor
caught his eye, and he stooped to pick
up the handcuffs which he had in-
tended to place on Cowley and had
worn himself by the irony of circum-
stance. He slipped them into his
pocket and opened the door of the
prison chamber.

  Smoking Duck was sitting on the
floor, in sour apathy, his wrists as Denis
had left them. Denis smiled cheerfully
at him.

  “I suppose you heard the sound of
wreckage, my friend? Yes, your little
game is up for good and all. By the
TROOPER STEWART, SUBSTITUTE

63

way, where’s the key of those hand-
cuffs? I want to use them on your
precious partner pretty quick.”

  Smoking Duck glared up at him, and
finally grunted out that the key was
lost.

  “So much the worse for Cowley, then
—he'll have to reach headquarters be-
fore getting released from bondage. I
see you still have some coffee on the
fire—want a hot cup that’ll cheer but
not inebriate?”

  The scowling half-breed emitted a
flood of mingled Cree and English,
which Denis rightly imagined to be a
profane refusal, so he barred the door
and left Smoking Duck to his own re-
flections.

  A pot of coffee stood on the tiny
fish-shanty stove, and in a couple of
moments Denis had a fire going, for he
had not eaten since the previous even-
ing. Keeping one eye on the edge of
the clearing, he swallowed some half-
warmed coffee and a cold sour-dough
biscuit—and looked out to see the figure
of Cowley coming at a run, rifle in
hand.

  Denis cocked his own rifle, drew to
one side of the doorway, and waited.
On his way across the clearing, Cowley
let out a roar for Smoking Duck, but
the half-breed had not the presence of
mind to call out a warning, or else he
had not yet comprehended the full situ-
ation of affairs.

  Thus Cowley came leaping into the
trap. At sight of the man’s brutal face,
Denis saw that he had been badly
frightened ; but that would further his
own ends.

  “Hands up—hurry!”

  That snappy, curt command stopped
Cowley as if shot. He was looking
squarely into the muzzle of the Ross
rifle.

  For a moment he was paralyzed. His
undershot jaw dropped in blank amaze-
ment, and the ragged mustache drew
back from his yellow teeth in a snarl.

Over the rifle sights the blue eyes of
Denis were blazing at him, and with a
single curse Cowley dropped his rifle
and lifted his hands. As he did so, he
took a backward step toward the door.

  “Stop that!” snapped Denis. “Walk
this way and put out your hands, wrists
together. I mean business, Cowley, and
you’d better believe it.”

  Cowley flung a hunted look over his
shoulder at the clearing, then slowly
obeyed the command, advancing toward
Denis.

  His heavy face showed mingled fear,
bewilderment, and fury. But when
Denis took the handcuffs from his
pocket Cowley cried out sharply:

  “Not that, Mister Trooper—fer
Gawd’s sake, don’t iron me! There’s

four fellers right after me-”

  "I know that,” said Denis warily.
“And one of them’s Ballard, the man
you cheated down on the Peace River.
Your chickens are coming home to
roost with a vengeance, eh? Stick out
your hands!”

  He held out the open handcuffs. But
Cowley, breathing hoarsely, drew back
in fear that was by no means assumed.

  “I tell ye they're after me!” he re-
peated. “Look-a-here, don’t lay me up
where I can’t shoot, ye fool! Them fel-
lers aims to murder me, an’ I got to
handle a gun in about two minutes!”
“You’ll handle no more guns for a
while.” Denis was smiling slightly, his
eyes steady. “Bray has gone back to
Vermilion, and I’ve just had the pleas-
ure of smashing up your liquor stock
and distillery. So you ran into Ballard,
eh ? I heard some shots—what hap-
pened down there?”

  Cowley made as if to wipe his drip-
ping brow, but halted as Denis’ finger
tightened on the trigger.

  “They seen me first an’ let drive. I
dropped one o’ them—leastways I
winged him a bit, then I shoved fer
home. Now, use sense! You ain't
a-goin’ to fix me where they’ll pump
G4

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

lead into me without me gettin’ a chance
to shoot-”

  ‘Shut up that nonsense!” broke in
Denis. “You’re not going to be hurt
unless you get gay with me. If you
don't stick your hands here in ten sec-
onds, I’m going to drop you with a bul-
let in your leg—take your choice!”

  lie meant the words, for he saw that
the situation was grave in the extreme.
Cowley had shot one of the four pur-
suers, and that meant trouble. Men of
Ballard’s stamp would require tenfold
vengeance for that shot. None the less,
Denis saw his duty clear-cut before
him, and intended to protect his pris-
oner to the utmost.

  With a growling snarl. Cowley ad-
vanced and. held forth his hands, wrists
together. Denis lifted the open hand-
cuffs in his left hand—and, as he did
so, Cowley swiftly struck the rifle aside
and bore him down with a pantherlike
leap.

  Taken utterly by surprise, Denis
went back and the rifle was knocked
across the shack with a clatter. Cow-
ley’s fist drove home on his cheek,
knocking him into the wall; but as the
ruffian followed, Denis flung himself to
one side and scrambled up.

  A fierce rush of anger swept from
his mind all thought of the revolver at
his belt, and he went into the man with
both fists, his blue eyes blazing. He
landed right and left to the face, then
went staggering away, groaning, as
Cowley’s heavy boot took him squarely
in the side. Cowley was after him with
a roar.

  That foul kick infuriated Denis as
nothing else had the power to madden
him, and when the ruffian tried the
same tactics again his anger drove new
life into his veins. Disdaining to em-
ploy such tricks himself, he lifted a
blow through the other’s guard that
went straight to the mouth and sent
Cowley reeling back with broken teeth.
On into him went Denis, placing blow

after blow, his lips clenched in silent
fury and his fists beating a tattoo on the
man’s face.

  Cowley lurched into the wall, curs-
ing; flung back, met a smashing left
hook that rocked him on his heels, and
then swung himself bodily into a clinch.
At the same instant, Denis stepped into
a bearskin heaped loosely on the floor.
Endeavoring to get clear of Cowley’s
hug, the bearskin tripped and brought
him down on the floor—underneath.

  The breath was knocked out of Denis
by the impact. He lay gasping and help-
less while Cowley, above, hit him twice
heavily. Then the ruffian gripped Denis
by the throat in an effort at systematic
choking. Aware of his advantage, with-
out pity, he was deliberately trying to
get Denis out of the way.

  Vainly and ineffectually Denis struck
upward—a man flat on his back cannot
hit much of a blow. Cowley tore at
him with snarling oaths, the"great fin-
gers digging into his throat until it
seemed that his flesh was coming asun-
der. His breath was stopped.

  With all things going black, and the
black changing to specks of fire that
danced through his brain, a final co-
herent thought came to him. It was the
recollection of his revolver.

  His fumbling hands went to the lan-
yard in blind desperation. Even in that
moment Denis fought against himself;
he must not fire! He must take Cow-
ley alive, he must bring in this man a
prisoner. With that great thought
pounding against his brain, Denis pulled
out the gun and struck upward with it
wildly.

  Cowley caught the full effect of that
blow. The fore sight of the revolver
took him just above the temple and
ripped to the bone. Again Denis struck
out blindly, and again the heavy re-
volver landed, almost in the same place.

  Those two blows were enough. Denis
felt the terrible grip on his throat relax,
and felt Cowley’s weight tumble away
TROOPER STEWART, SUBSTITUTE

65

from him. Little more than conscious
himself, he rolled over and dragged
himself up by the logs of the wall.

  He leaned against the wall, hanging
on weakly and panting for breath,
fighting against the terrible faintness
that oppressed him and threatened to
conquer his reeling brain. That life-
and-death struggle had all but drowned
him.

  Gradually his sight cleared, as air
returned to his gasping lungs. There at
his feet lay Cowley, stretched out, his
head bleeding. Denis’ first thought was
that he had struck too hard; dropping
to his knees, he breathed quick relief at
finding Cowley’s heart beating. The
man was only stunned.

  A glance at the clearing showed no
sign of Ballard’s forces. After all, that
battle had taken only a few moments,
though it had seemed an age to Denis.

  For a little he stood gazing down at
Cowley, while strength came back to
him and his throbbing lungs drank in
the sweet air. To one side lay the
handcuffs where he had dropped them.
Picking them up, he drew Cowley’s
wrists together and snapped the brace-
lets in place.

  “I’ve landed him at last,” he mut-
tered, with a deep sigh of relief. “And
it's a lucky thing for me that I made
sure of Smoking Duck first! I can’t
leave this fellow to bleed to death,
though.”

  Searching through Cowley’s pockets,
he discovered a ragged bandanna.
With this and his own handkerchief he
bandaged the man’s bleeding scalp,
roughly but effectively. While doing
so, Cowley’s eyelids fluttered, then
opened.

  “Lie still!” cautioned Denis. “You
can get up in a minute.”

  Cowley lifted his wrists, saw the
handcuffs, and relaxed with a low
growl. When the bandaging was fin-
ished, Denis went to the door of the
smaller room and unbarred it. Smok-

CsA

ing Duck still reposed on the floor, wide
awake and glaring like a trapped beast.
Denis turned to the watching Cowley.

  “Come along, now, and get in here!
Ballard may show up at any minute,

and I want you off my hands-”

  “Ballard!”

  Cowley sat up, fright stamped anew
in his coarse features.

  “Ye ain’t goin’ to let ’em have me,

Mister Trooper? Fer the love of-”

  “Shut up!” snapped Denis curtly.
“Ballard and his friends won’t lay a
finger on you, I’ll promise you that.
You join your friend and fellow citizen
in here, and go to sleep. I’ll attend to
the rest.”

  Cowley looked at him. Into the
man’s rough face crept a slow gleam
of admiration as he met the steady gaze
of Denis.

  “Mister, ye sure are some man!” he
exclaimed. “Ye got me—ye got me
proper, and I give ye the best I had at
that. I thought I’d slide out o’ here
with a good wad, but ye sure played the
game hard. No, I reckon I got to take
my med’cine now, and I ain’t got any
kick cornin’. You blasted redcoat!”
With this grudging tribute to his con-
queror, Crowley lifted himself and stag-
gered into the smaller room, sinking
down beside Smoking Duck. Denis
shut the door and dropped the heavy
bar into place.

  The clearing was still empty of life
outside the shack. Sinking down on
one of the two bunks, Denis rested
his aching head in his hands.

  “The worst of the job is done.” he
thought, “unless—unless that lynching
party is after gore. If they are, it looks
to me as if they’ll have to get it. By
Jasper, I have Cowley safe, and I mean
to keep him!”

  He lifted his head at sound of a
distant shout. Then, picking up his
Ross rifle, he laid it across his knees
and waited, facing the doorway.
66

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

       CHAPTER XIV.
       Ballard Shows Fight.

DENIS STEWART was unutter-
ably weary, both physically and
mentally.

  He had been on a tremendous strain
for the past three days, and the sleep
which he had gained had been fitful and
at odd intervals. He had drawn heavily
on his splendid physique, and as he
waited for Ballard’s coming he realized
that he could not endure another phys-
ical struggle. Nor did he intend to.

  “If I can’t down him by sheer will
power, I’m gone,” he thought wearily.
“If I add a bit of target practice, I may
pull through—but it may not come to
that.”

  No false hopes were his. He knew
the temper of those settlers, and knew
that they would be savagely determined
to get hold of Cowley. He was there to
prevent their doing so—that was all.

  Another shout sounded, closer this
time, and another. Denis realized that
they were trailing Cowley, having
found the creek entrance and evidently
being without knowledge of what lay
ahead. He sat quietly, gazing through
the open doorway at the sunny clearing,
and waited.

  There was a note in those shouts
which he did not like, a menacing,
bloodhound note which spelled danger.
This was a man hunt, firing the hnnters’
blood with ferocity, demanding a vic-
tim, knowing neither reason nor mercy.
And at the end of the trail sat Denis,
his blue eyes cold as ice.

  Then he sighted the hunters.

  They appeared in a group, running,
and halted abruptly at the edge of the
clearing as they scanned the cabin. One
of the men, that same “Ed” who had
on the previous evening pierced through
Denis’ similarity to his brother, had left
his arm in a sling, but held a revolver
in his right hand.

  1 hat silent cabin evidently puzzled

them, and they were not sure whether
they had run Cowley to earth, or
whether he had taken horse and fled.
They discussed matters; then, at a ges-
ture from Ballard, the other three scat-
tered and took to cover along the edge
of the clearing. Ballard himself, rifle
under his arm, stepped out and walked
toward the shack, his eyes flitting over
it searchingly.

  “If Cowley was here with his rifle,
Ballard would be a dead man—and
knows it,” thought Denis admiringly!
“There’s one brave man, at all events!”
Ballard evinced no hesitation, though
he must have known that he wras taking
his life in his hand by that open ad-
vance. He strode across the clearing,
and paused at the doorway, too dazzled
by the sunlight to make out objects
within.

  “Come in, Ballard!” spoke up Denis
quietly. “Come in; this is Stewart
speaking. But leave your men where
they are.”

  Ballard stared in blank astonishment,
as his eyes finally made out the figure
of Denis sitting on the bunk opposite
the door. With one swift glance
around the otherwise empty room, he
stepped inside and eyed Denis.

  “Well, for the love of Mike!” he
ejaculated slowly. “Thought you had
vamosed down the river last night.”
“No,” smiled Denis. “I borrowed
one of your canoes and left it on the
shore, half a mile below here. You’ll
find it waiting.”

 “Hang the canoe!” snapped the
other. “Where’s Cowley? We want
that cuss.”

  “That’s really too bad,” returned
Denis pleasantly, keeping his finger on
the trigger of the rifle across his lap.
“You won’t find him.”

  “Eh?” Ballard’s face set savagely.
“Has he cleared out o’ here?”

  “Not exactly. By the way, there’s
some coffee on the stove. Help your-
self.”
TROOPER STEWART, SUBSTITUTE

67

  Ballard was puzzled by this cool re-
ception. With a bare nod, he crossed
to the stove and poured out some of
the bitter black coffee, swallowing it
at a gulp. Then he set down the cup,
his eyes fastened on the barred door.
“What's behind that door, Stewart?”
Denis shifted his rifle a trifle.
“Hold your rifle just as it is, Bal-
lard !’’ he said, his voice biting like a
whip. “Cowley is behind that door.”
The settler stiffened. His eyes went
to Denis in keen surmise, noted the
rifle trained on him, and rested on the
eyes of Denis. The two looked at each
other steadily, neither wavering. But
Ballard did not lift his rifle.

  “Look a’ here, Stewart; we'd better
have a little talk. I want to know
where you stand, and I want to know
mighty quick.”

  “I’m not standing at present.” and
Denis smiled. "I’m sitting 011 Cowley's
bunk. Meanwhile, you have the floor,
and I’m ready to listen. Shoot ahead!”
“I’ll do it,” nodded Ballard, his face
hard and inflexible. “You know what
we come here for, and why. Mebbe
you don’t know what happened at the
foot o’ the lake this mornin’, do ye?”
“I do,” assented Denis quietly. "I
believe you shot at Cowley.”

  “Uh-huh. And the skunk put a bul-
let into Ed’s shoulder, curse him!
Now we aim to life him in a rope neck-
lace, where he belongs, and we don’t
aim to be interfered with, none what-
ever. I hope you get me.”

  Denis smiled again—that same de-
ceptive smile.

  “I understand you perfectly well,
Ballard. You intend to commit mur-
der by hanging Cowley. Cowley may
deserve it, of course, but I’d hate to
see you four men getting into court
on a murder charge.”

  Ballard stared at him.

  “Out with it, Stewart—what’s your
position? You ain’t figgering on
playin’ any low-down tricks, arc you?”

  “Quite the contrary, Ballard. I came
here this morning and arrested Smok-
ing Duck, a half-breed. I then ar-
rested Cowley, when he returned from
meeting you. The two are in the next
room together. Cowley has been mak-
ing white whisky up here, or what
passes for whisky with the Indians, and
has been trading it for peltries.”
“Making whisky?" ejaculated Bal-
lard. “You sure?”

  “You’d better take a look at what’s
left of the still and whisky around in
back. As I told you last night, I’m
representing my brother, Big Ben.
Also, I'm representing the law. That’s
exactly where I stand, Ballard.”

The other looked steadily at him.
“There’s four of us, all told, and one
o’ you,” he rejoined slowly. “D’you
mean to say you're goin’ to stop us
takin’ Cowley?”

  “Exactly,” nodded Denis.

  “Mebbe you figger on releasin’ Cow-
ley and the 'breed to take a hand ?”
“They are my prisoners, Ballard.
They remain my prisoners—in that
room. I have promised them protec-
tion from your lynching party, and in-
tend to keep my promise.”

  “Then all I can say is, you’re a
durned fool,” exploded Ballard angrily.
“We’re goin’ to get Cowley, hear me?
If you start any foolin' like you talk
about, we’ll pile into you and make

you wish you was somewhere else-”

  "Don't forget, I’m representing the
law here,” interposed Denis.

  The settler spat scornfully.

  “Law—thunder! You ain’t repre-
sentin’ nothin’, no more’n I am! Just
’cause your brother is Trooper Stew-
art don’t give you no license to parade
around in them clothes, does it? Not
much. You ain't no soldier at all;
you’re just an ordinary man like me,
and a blamed fool to boot. Are you
goin' to get out the way or not?”
Denis smiled again.

  “I’m very sorry, but I must refuse
68

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

your invitation to move, Mr. Ballard.
Please observe that this rifle of mine
is cocked, and is trained on your left
knee. Now step outside and tell your
friends what you’ve heard.”

  Without a word more the settler
turned and departed scornfully. Strid-
ing a dozen feet from the shack door,
he waved an arm.

  “Come on in, boys 1”

  The other three appeared, and Bal-
lard went to meet them. Denis watched
their meeting and saw that Ballard was
evidently describing what he had found
in the cabin. The other three men
broke into strident laughter—and that
was a bad sign.

  Denis rose and walked to the door,
pausing just outside. All four turned
to gaze at him, and he held up a hand.

  “Just a moment, my friends,” he
called pleasantly. “Do you see that
stump, twenty feet to your right?”
The stump which he indicated was
small, and from one side a jagged splin-
ter of wood stood up for six inches.
It was white spruce, plain to see, only
a hundred feet from the shack.

  “Just watch that stump for a mo-
ment,” went on Denis.

  Lifting his rifle to his shoulder, he
sighted at the splinter and pressed the
trigger—seemingly without an instant’s
hesitation. At the crack the splinter
seemed to blow away into nothing.

  “Thank you for your kind attention,”
smiled Denis. “That's all.”

  A moment’s silence greeted this dis-
play of shooting ability. Denis turned
and went back to the bunk, seating him-
self as before, facing the door.

  The four men conferred together.
Then, with another laugh, they marched
forward to the shack, Ballard in the
lead. Denis waited until they came
close to the doorway, then he lifted
his rifle.1

  “One moment, please, gentlemen 1”
They halted. Ed, the wounded man,
called in rough but earnest tones:

  “None o’ the old stuff, Stewart! 'We
know darned well you ain’t a-goin’ to
shoot us, so don’t try no bluff. We
don’t want to hurt you.”

  “An’ we know you ain’t no soldier,
so cut it out,” added another.

  “All that is perfectly true,” Denis
smiled. “Take a look at my rifle—
you see where it is pointing?”

  They squinted in at him, Ballard
leaning over. Denis was pointing his
rifle at the doorsill.

  "What you say is quite correct,” he
went on steadily. “I wouldn’t shoot
you down at all. But I am equally
correct in saying that you wmi’t get
Cowley unless you shoot me down—
which I don’t think you’ll do by a good
deal. I have several cartridges in this
rifle, perfectly good ones, and you’ve
seen that I know how to shoot.

  "Of course, you can rush me. Very
likely you will. But let me impress
on you just one thing. I can fire at
least two shots before you reach me,
and then I have a revolver for quick
work. The first man of you who sets
his foot on that door threshold will
get a bullet in it—in his foot. It’ll
make a nasty wound, too. Step right
along, Ballard! You’ll have to murder
me to get Cowley, you know. Step
up, gentlemen!”

  No one accepted the invitation.

  The seated figure of Denis, the rifle
leveled and waiting, gave them pause.
By his steady voice and cold blue eye
they knew that he was in deathly ear-
nest. The first to step on the threshold
would probably be crippled for life.

  “Hurry up!” snapped Denis sud-
denly. "Ballard, you’re the prime
mover of this lynching expedition, so
step along with you! I f you don’t
choose to chance it, put a bullet into
me. You set out to do murder, so
here’s your opportunity. Step out,
Ballard!”

  “Don’t ye do it!” cried one of the
TROOPER STEWART, SUBSTITUTE

69

men hastily. ‘‘Pie means it—look at
his face! Don’t ye do it!”

  Most certainly Denis meant it, and
his resolution was reflected in his pat-
tered face. Under the blaze of his cold
eyes the four men paused, irresolute.

  Then, with an oath, Ballard shoved
forward, throwing up his rifle.

  “You shoot me an’ you get a bullet!”
he. cried.

  “Step up!” said Denis coldly.

  The settler heaved forward, but his
face was whiter than that of Denis,
and sweat was on his brow. With a
quick motion he raised his right foot
over the threshold, brought it down,
and then poised it an inch from the
floor.

  “Touch the floor!” said Denis. “I’m
ready.”

  Ballard heaved his shoulders for-
ward, straining, as if some invisible
wall were holding him back; then—he
turned and stepped away.

 “Go to thunder!” he snapped.
“Come on home, boys. I guess Stew-
art is competent to get that skunk into
jail without us helpin’.”

  Denis lay back weakly in the bunk
and watched them go.

       CHAPTER XV.
       The Back Trail.

SORRY, Cowley, but you’ll have to
wear those clear into headquar-
ters. I wouldn’t trust you an inch
without ’em, either.”

  Denis smiled genially at the swin-
dler, who grunted sheepishly.

 With Smoking Duck, they were
seated about the ruins of Cowley's
table, enjoying the repast of venison
and coffee which Denis had prepared.

  Bal'ard and his friends had departed
to the foot of the lake. Convinced of
their going, Denis had taken a plunge
in the creek and freshened himself,
then had set about getting a meal.

  He ate amid due precautions, how-

ever. Cowley wore his irons. Smok-
ing Duck, with his hands free to eat,
sat in the corner across the room from
Denis’ rifle.

  “I heard what you said to them fel-
lers,” said Cowley gruffly. “Mister, I
take off my hat to ye. As I said, I’ll
have to take my med’cine, an’ I’ll hold
it agin’ ye for a while, too—but you’re
some man, believe me! Any one who
can lick Jim Cowley, an’ then pull off

the stunt ye pulled off on them-”

  “Forget it!” smiled Denis.

“Ye would ha’ shot, wouldn’t ye?”
“Maybe I would.” nodded Denis,
keeping a wary eye on Smoking Duck.

  Before he could say more he was
startled by a shadow at the doorway.
Catching at his rifle, he whirled—to
see the grinning face of the half-breed,
Napoleon McShayne.

  Behind McShayne were two other
figures. One was the Slave Indian
whom Denis had encountered on the
upper Hay River, old John Tadeteecha,
the other was a Slave unknown to
Denis. These last two paused outside,
while Napoleon entered.

  Before the “Whatcheer!” of greet-
ing had been exchanged, Denis had
swiftly leaped at a scheme which would
relieve him of much labor and trouble.
No more speech passed for a moment,
Napoleon filling a pipe with whittled
tobacco; then, seeing that Smoking
Duck had finished his meal, Denis or-
dered him to stand up.

  “Tie that fellow’s hands behind his
back, Poleon !” he directed. “Tie ’em
tight, and do the job well!”

  When the scowling Petwanisip was
safely secured, Denis ordered him
and Cowley outside, following them
promptly.

  “Now, Poleon,” he went on, “you
go around to that left-hand lean-to,
and you’ll find a very good bunch of
fur. Haul it all out here. You go
and help him, John; I expect you
traded some of those furs yourself,
70

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

didn’t you? Well, you'll get 110 more
whisky here. Hop along, all of you!”
The two Slave Indians grinned as
if at some excellent joke, and followed
Napoleon. The three broke into the
fur cache, and presently began to haul
forth bale after bale of fur. Most of
the pelts were common, two or three
bales being separately wrapped and
proving to contain some dark marten
and cross fox pelts of better promise.

  Two of these better bales Denis
handed over to Napoleon, as the pay
which he had promised for assistance
rendered. The second Slave gave his
name as Tommy, and it proved that
he had come to get some whisky in re-
turn for a few sorry muskrat pelts.
Dennis addressed him straightly:

  “Tommy, you clear out of here in a
hurry! These pelts are going to stay
here till your people come for them.
Spread the word that whoever has
traded to Cowley for whisky can come
and get his furs back; that ought to be
simple enough, because each fur is
marked by the man who caught it.
Don’t try any stealing, or you’ll go to
jail. Run along now!”

  Tommy departed toward the creek,
wondering,

  "You ain’t goin’ to hand back all
them peltries!” groaned Cowley, seeing
the fruits of his long illegal labors
thus scattered. “You got to take ’em

along, by law-”

  “I’m the law in this case,” snapped
Denis. “You shut up! John, you and
Napoleon come here!”

  The two stood before him, grinning
vacuously.

  “I have to take these two prisoners
up the Flay to my father’s homestead—
you know the place, John. Did you
take that message to my father?”

  Old John nodded his head, and re-
ported that all was well at the home-
stead.- Denis continued:

  “Napoleon, I want you to paddle
them up in your dugout. John and I
will come with you in my canoe. J’ll
have to go all the way without sleep,
and I won’t be able to put in any work
at the paddle. After we get there, my
brother will want to take these men
011 to the Peace River, and will prob-
ably hire you to help him. You take
us up, as I have said, and I’ll promise
you good pay in goods and tobacco.
How about it?”

  Neither of the aborigines was anx-
ious to work, but on the other hand,
Denis represented the law to them, and
it is not wise to refuse aid to the law.

  Five minutes later, with the two
prisoners safely barred in the smaller
room, Denis rolled up and lay down
across the door. They were to start
up lake at sunset, and until that time
he was going to make up sleep in an-
ticipation of his long watch on the river
trail, for he would not dare trust either.
Indian to guard the prisoners.

  “By Jasper!” he thought sleepily.
“I’ve made good for Ben, after all.
But, believe me, I've changed my mind
about going into the mounted. Yes,
sir; I’m contented to remain a plain,
unadorned American—this law-and-
order business is just a bit too strenu-
ous for Trooper Stewart, substitute!”

The End.

A RECORD-BREAKING BEET

A RED beet that weighs eight and one-half pounds was grown by Mrs. Peter
Glatfelter, of Spring Grove, Pennsylvania. It is twenty-two inches long,
and twice as many inches in circumference. She says she has not been
able so far to find a pot large enough to boil it in.
Viliam Wallace Cook

EEPLY steeped in gloom
perfectly described the
condition of young
Nixon J. Peters. Lone-
liness and bitter regret
pervaded his soul as he
sat by himself on the
rear seat of the flying
sleigh and thought of what might have
been. He had reason to believe that he
was the best skater and ski jumper en-
tered in the winter sports’ contests at
Devil's Lake, on the preceding after-
noon, and yet he had lost both main
events by an apparent failure to look
well to his equipment at the last mo-
ment. Every one had expected that he
would blunder somewhere, and so no
one was greatly disappointed; that is,
no one except Nixon J. Peters.

  Almost at the take-off of the jump,
one of Nixon's skis had broken. He
had taken a wild header, and landed in
a snow bank with heels in the air.
A big laugh had been the result Also,
he had cast a skate at the critical mo-
ment of the skating race, and the other
contestants had slid past him, Porter
Markham in the lead. This same Por-
ter Markham, too, had won the ski
jump. Now, Porter Markham was on
the front seat of the sleigh, driving

blithely, and exchanging jest and small
talk with Hesther Morton, who sat be-
side him. Truly, Nixon J. Peters’ lines
had fallen in hard places!

  Nixon was “Nix” to those who knew
him best. Often he suffered the crown-
ing indignity of being referred to as the
“Saphead.” He had heard the unlovely
nickname applied to him many times
while digging himself out of the snow
bank. It had punctuated the merri-
ment released by his sorry mishap.
Hesther Morton had joined in the riot
of laughter. Nixon knew this only too
well, for she was the first person he
had seen after digging the snow out of
his eyes. For Hesther to be amused
at his expense—well, that was some-
thing that hurt.

  Then, while seeking, with dogged res-
olution, to retrieve himself on the steel
runners, a strap had broken, and a skate
had shot off across the glittering ice.
Peters had slipped and slammed around
on the course like a crazy curling stone,
finally cutting the feet out from under
a fat spectator, who called him Saphead
right to his face! Ah, what a wind-up
for a sorry afternoon! Peters clenched
his hands in his bearskin gloves and
crouched down 011 the rear seat in a
fruitless effort to efface himself.

  lie was nineteen, and Porter Mark-
ham was twenty. They both worked for
Uncle Silas Goddard, who had a ranch
in Montana, and made a business of
sending range horses into North Dakota
to be halter broken and sold to the set-
tlers. Goddard was “uncle” to all his
men, in the sense that gives an avuncu-
lar character to every genial, middle-
aged person who looks after the welfare
of younger employees.

  In the early summer, Uncle Silas had
sent a hundred horses into North Da-
kota. Business had not been good, and
late fall found half the horses still 011
hand. These horses were being win-
tered at the Morton ranch, on marsh
hay, cut and stacked by Peters, Mark-
ham, and Reece Bailey, who had been
sent by Uncle Silas to take care of the
horse herd. W hen spring came, there
was a promise of turning oft' every head
of the stock at a good profit.

  The winter, so far, had not been par-
ticularly lonely for the Montana men.
The snows of December had been light,
and it had been possible for the horses
to paw out considerable forage in the
hills. January, however, brought in a
good fall of “the beautiful,” and it had
been necessary to corral and shelter the
animals and to go extensively into the
feeding.

  Reece Bailey, Uncle Si's foreman,
found time to play cribbage with Lance
Morton, Hesther's father; and Peters
and Nixon acquired leisure for skating
and skiing, popular sports at their home
ranch in the Rockies. A river—it would
have been a creek in a country of large
streams—flowed through the Morton
holdings, and its glassy surface offered
a resistless invitation to the steel run-
ners. As for the skiing, there were
plain and hill for running, climbing, and
glissading. While Bailey and Morton
were busy at their eternal “fifteen-two,
fifteen-four,” Peters and Markham
were skating or skiing, often with Hes-
ther, who was fond of both sports. The

girl, if appearances were to be believed,
was rather fond of Markham, also, but
had few smiles to waste on Peters.

  In his bashful, blundering way, Pe-
ters tried to make himself agreeable to
Hesther. He was big and awkward,
however, and had tow-colored hair, a
slow wit, and few graces of speech or
manner. His efforts to impress Hesther
were overwhelmed by the never-failing
persiflage and the rakish dress and car-
riage of handsome Porter Markham.
Markham possessed a confidence in
himself that was sublime, a confidence
that shone brilliantly in contrast with
the clumsy ineffectiveness of Nixon J.
Peters.

  Peters realized this, and nourished a
bitter grudge against his physical and
mental shortcomings. He used to dream
of a fire at the ranch, in which he posed
as a hero, and bore the fair Hesther to
safety from the ranch house, through
a furnace of flames. Then, in his vi-
sions, he pictured the girl as taking
his hand and humbly asking his forgive-
ness for her failure to perceive his ster-
ling qualities from the first. During
such moments of illusion the Saphead
was almost happy. But the ranch house
never took fire, and the chance to prove
himself a hero by rescuing Hesther
Morton was denied by fate.

  In mid-January, however, an oppor-
tunity presented itself, through the win-
ter sports at Devil’s Lake. Markham
and Peters entered themselves in the
ski-jumping contest and skating race.
They drove the fifty miles which sep-
arated Morton’s from the lake, and
Hesther went with them, to see the
“carnival of sports” and to spend a
night or two with relatives in Devil’s
Lake City. Again Peters had dreams;
but now, on the homeward drive, every
hope was shattered, and he longed for
a period of blank obscurity and com-
plete retirement.

  He could have declared that one of
his skis had been tampered with, and
SKATES, SKIS, AND A SAPHEAD

73

that one of his skate straps had been
all but cut through with the point of a
knife. Examination made him sure of
both facts, yet it had not occurred to
him to ''sob." He had blundered in not
making certain of his skis and skates
beforehand, so he coidd not see how
any one but himself was at fault. As
he crouched in the back seat of the
sleigh he considered requesting Uncle
Silas Goddard to recall him to the Mon-
tana headquarters. There, at least, he
would be rid of Markham, and cut off
forever from the demoralizing and dis-
dainful eyes of Hesther.

  Yes, he would go back to the home
ranch, and he would do this in spite
of something which he knew, and which
was very important to his future. It
was common knowledge that a place of
preferment was to be given by Uncle
Silas either to Peters or to Markham—
a foremanship at a newer ranch, with
a chance to acquire an interest in the
horses and cattle. Reece Bailey was
watching Peters and Markham, and on
his report Uncle Silas would act. To
retire from the North Dakota venture
of the ranchowner now would cut Pe-
ters off entirely from promotion, and
drop the plum in Porter Markham's
hand. But Peters, in the bitterness of
his heart, was allowing nothing aside
from his own peace of mind to influence
him. Yes, he would ask Uncle Silas to
recall him to Montana.

  “You still there, Nix?” Markham
suddenly asked, turning to look rear-
ward.

  Peters grunted.

  “You're so blamed quiet,” went on
Markham, with a laugh, “that I reck-
oned you might have taken another
header into the snow, back a ways on
the trail.”

  Hesther joined in the laugh, and, in
spirit, poor Peters writhed.

  The short day was closing, and the
sun went down beyond the white ho-
rizon in cold glory. They were five-

miles from Morton's, and Markham
had driven the horses so hard that they
were nearly fagged. They breathed
wheezingly, and frost coated their heav-
ing sides. The pace dragged, in spite
of Markham's relentless use of the
whip.

  "Anyhow,” spoke up Peters suddenly,
“you might think of the team a little,
Porter. They're near tuckered.”

  “Who’s doing this driving?” cried
Markham. “I never yet had to ask a
saphead for advice in handling horses.”
And again the whip fell on the strain-
ing flanks.

  Peters clenched his fists in the bear-
skin gloves. It occurred to him that he
could lift Markham bodily out of the
front seat, take his place, and do the
driving himself; but he did not.

  The horses struggled on, and in the
falling dark the travelers topped a
"rise” that gave them a dim view of the
buildings of Morton’s ranch. A light
showed in one of the ranch-house win-
dows like a star, and toward it Mark-
ham drove, and presently halted at the
door.

  “Now that I've handled the reins all
the way from Devil’s Lake, Nix,” re-
marked Markham, as he jumped out,
and helped Hesther to alight, “I allow
it's up to you to take care of the team.
Cold, Essie?”

  “Not a bit,” the girl answered, and
hurried toward the door. Markham
followed her, and Peter drove on to the
stable.

  As he unhitched and brought the
horses into the shelter, he was a little
surprised to discover that there were
no other animals in the place. The team
was Morton’s, but Bailey’s cow horse,
together with those of Peters and Mark-
ham, should have been in the stable;
unless Bailey was out at the corral and
shelter sheds, looking after the fifty
range horses that were kept there.

  Peters lighted a lantern, removed the
harness from the horses, and, after put-
74

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

ting hay in the mangers, began rubbing
the animals down with an old gunny
sack. He was hard at this when a call
reached his ears from the house: "Pe-
ters! This way—011 the jump!”

  It was Markham's voice, and there
was a note of alarm in it that startled
Peters. Lantern in hand, he hurried
out of the stable and made his way
to the house. Flinging the door wide,
he crossed the threshold into the ranch-
house sitting room.

  "What's wrong. Porter?” he asked.

  The “cannon-ball” stove glowed with
heat. That, and the bright oil lamp,
dazzled Peters' eyes for the moment,
and he could not see what was going on
in the room.

  “Bailey has been hurt.” came the
voice of Markham. “Every horse in
the herd has been driven off by thieves
•—and they even took Bailey's mount
with the rest. Biggest outrage that ever
happened in these parts! I'd like to
know what the blamed country is com-
ing to!”

  The blur lifted from before Peters’
eyes. He saw Bailey, his face twisted
with pain, lying on a couch. Mrs. Mor-
ton bent over him, bathing a wounded
shoulder from a basin of hot water.
Her husband was walking up and down,
fuming and sputtering. Markham stood
beside the couch, looking down at the
foreman with a queer expression on his
face. Hesther, all excited, was remov-
ing her wraps with shaking hands.

  “Horses stolen!” gasped Peters,
dazed by the weird calamity. “How
could it happen ? Is Bailey badly
hurt?”

  "Don’t stand there gawping!” fussed
Morton. “Something has got to be
done, and it's up to you and Markham
to do it. A gang of scoundrels from
across the line made off with the stock;
and it's been no more than three hours
since it happened. Take my team and
get to Roscommon. The sheriff’s got
to be notified. Bailey says the thieves

are making for the north, and if you
and Markham are quick a posse can
get between the gang and the boundary
line. For heaven’s sake, Peters, wake
up!”

  Peters shook himself, put down the
lantern, and came to the side of the
couch.

  “Why don't Markham wake up?” he
asked. “Hasn’t he suggested anything
yet?"

  “Nothing to suggest,” Markham an-
swered, flashing a sharp look at Peters.
“It's twenty miles to Roscommon, and
no chance of getting there ahead of the
thieves and the stolen stock. The only
animals we can put our hands on are
the two that brought us from Devil’s
Lake, and they are done up. You know
that, Peters.”

  “What about using skates or skis?”
inquired Peters. “By thunder, there is
a way of getting to Roscommon in time
to help the sheriff head off the stolen
stock!”

II.

  There was a dominant, compelling
note in the voice of Peters. It was so
unexpected in its assertiveness that
every one in the room was startled. His
washed-out blue eyes fenced aggres-
sively with the snapping black eyes of
Markham.

  "Skates or skis!” repeated Markham,
his upper lip curling. “Why, it’s all of
thirty miles to Roscommon, if you fol-
low the crooks o' the river! And how
much would you figure it by skis, if
you crossed Bear Butte instead of go-
ing around it? Talk sense, if you know
how, Nix! Don’t forget the fellows
who rustled our stock have three hours
the lead.”

  “How far will three hours of driving
in this snow get the stolen herd?” re-
turned Peters. “The thieves will have
a tough job of it. They-”

  Bailey twisted his flushed face from
under the ministering hands of Mrs.
SKATES, SKIS, AND A SAPHEAD

75

Morton. “The varmints are goiiv north
by the Long Knife Dry Wash," be said,
his voice shaking with the pain of bis
wound. “That’s only three miles west
of Roscommon. If you boys could get
word to the sheriff somehow, I reckon
he might head off the raiders with a
posse. But if you do anything, you’ll
have to do it quick. Porter.’’ and his
eyes swerved to Markham. “I’m lookin’
to you—Uncle Si Goddard is lookin' to
you. Nigh on to five thousand dollars'
wutli of horses are being pushed to'rds
the border, and here I'm helpless to do
a thing.”

  "it don’t seem possible to do a thing,
Reece,” returned Markham. "If we
could round up a crowd of men in short
order, and take after the thieves on
fresh horses, like enough we might
overhaul ’em. But where’s the riding
stock? Why, Morton's nearest neigh-
bor is ten miles away!”

  Peters flashed a disapproving glance
at Markham, pulled off his bearskin
gloves, and slumped down in a chair by
the stove. From the pockets of his
overcoat he took his skates, also a new
strap he had secured in Devil’s Lake
City. Quickly lie replaced the broken
strap with the new one.

  “You going to try and get to Ros-
common by river, Nix?” Morton in-
quired.

  “I figure the chances are better that
way than going over Bear Butte on
skis,” Peters answered. "The river’s
clean of snow, and mostly the ice is like
a lookin’-glass. I'm going to do my
best to get word to the sheriff and to
start a Roscommon doctor this way to
look after Bailey.”

  “You’re locoed!” growled Markham.
“It s all right to get a doctor for Reese,
here, but there ain't a chance to save
the stock this side of the line. Let the
raiders get it across the boundary, and
then take the matter up with the Ca-
nadian Mounted Police. That's my ad-
vice.”

  “If you wait till the stock is out of
this country,” put in the rancher, "there
won't be a chance.”

  "Not a chance on earth,” agreed Bai-
ley. “That outfit o’ thieves knowed
exactly what they was about. Every-
thing was cut and dried, and somebody
sure tipped 'em off regardin’ the lay-
out here. I'll bet a thousand ag’inst
a chink wash ticket that them bronks
will be took care of across the line so'st
they can’t be located by nobody. Them
thieves picked a time when I was alone
at the shelter sheds and Porter and
Nix was to the winter sports at the
lake. They dropped me out o' my sad-
dle without any whys or wherefores,
and then made off with my mount and
sent a man to the stable for Peters' and
Markham’s ridin' horses. By the time
1 covered the mile back to the ranch
house the stock was well on the way
north. I—1-”

  He broke off abruptly, clenching his
teeth hard as a spasm of pain ran
through his body.

  “I'll get another coat,” remarked Pe-
ters, rising from his chair and starting
for the door that led to his room. “It
won’t be possible to make any kind of
time in a long overcoat like this." He
disappeared.

  Markham came to the side of the
couch. “If Peters has a chance, Reece,”
said he, "lie'll make a bobble of some
kind and spoil it all. That's his way.
I better go to Roscommon myself. Pe-
ters can use his skates, and take the
river trail, and I’ll use my skis and go
over the butte. I don't think we have
a ghost of a show to head off the stock,
but it’s up to us to see what we can
do.”

  “That’s the talk!” exclaimed Morton
approvingly. "The thieves had help
from this ranch,’' he added darkly, toss-
ing a significant glance toward the door
through which Peters had just passed,
“and I haven't got a whole lot of con-
70

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

fidence in at least one man around
here.”

    “Peters is square,” Bailey averred.
 “Square as a die. .He jest don’t seem
 to have the knack for puttin’ his idees
 across. The man that saves them
 bronks, Porter,” he added significantly,
 “is goin’ to make the biggest kind of a
 hit with Goddard.”

    “If any one connects with the sheriff
 at Roscommon in time to save the
 bronks.” Markham returned, “it will be
 me.” He spoke with a confidence that
 thrilled every one in the room, and Hes-
 ther, if the red in her cheeks and the
 sparkle in her eyes were any indica-
 tion, most of all. “I’ll be ready,” he
 finished, moving toward the door, “in
 about two shakes.”

   “You must have some hot coffee be-
 fore you start,” said Hesther, “and
 I’ll see that it is ready for you.”

   Markham was back in the room be-
 fore Peters had reappeared. He wore
 a leather coat, and the bottoms of his
 trousers were laced inside his high shoe
 tops. Trim and handsome he looked,
 and ready for a grueling night’s work.
 Hesther was just placing the coffee on
 the table, and she lifted her eyes to
 flash a glance of admiration at the
 young ski runner.

    “I’ll be ready in a minute, Essie,”
 said Markham, with a nod and a smile.

   Taking his skis from a corner of
 the room, he sat down, laid them across
 his knees, and proceeded to grease them
 well from a can which he had brought
 into the room and had placed 011 the
 stove. While he worked, Peters came
 1 lumbering in.

    Peters had donned a ragged sweater,
 whose collar came up around his ears.
 Over this was buttoned a faded and
 threadbare coat. His old-fashioned
 skates were under his arm. From be-
 neath the rim of his moth-eaten fur cap
 his tow hair showed in a sort of fringe.
 The cap had ear flaps, with strings at
 their ends. The flaps were loose, and

the strings fluttered as he moved his
head. His shoes were of cowhide,
strong and serviceable, but not at all
ornamental. He had tied the bottoms
of his trousers to his ankles with pieces
of cord.

  The contrast between Peters and
Markham was very striking. So far as
appearances went, Markham had it
“on” Peters by about a hundred to
one.

  “I’m going, too, Nix,” observed
Markham, laying his skis to one side.
“I'll go over the butte, and I’ve got a
month’s pay that says I beat you into
Roscommon.”

  “Maybe you will,” returned Peters,
starting for the outside door.

  There was more bitterness in Peters’
heart. He believed he understood the
situation. Markham had won the ski
jump and the skating race, and now he
wanted to round off his triumphs by
being first to carry the news of the
horse thieving to the sheriff. Markham
was planning a spectacular bit of work,
for Uncle Si Goddard incidentally.
Mainly, he was thinking of the effect
of his night's success on Hesther Mor-
ton.

  “Wait, Nixon!” called Mrs. Morton.
“Essie has got some hot coffee ready,
and you must have a cup before you
leave.”

  The rancher’s wife was the only one
who ever gave much thought to Peters.
She considered him now, when the con-
sideration and confidence of the others
seemed to center wholly in Markham.

  “Much obliged, Mrs. Morton,” Pe-
ters answered, “but I don’t reckon I’ll
take the time. You see,” he added, as
he laid a hand on the doorknob, “it’s a
case where every minute counts.”

  Before the good woman could an-
swer, the door had closed behind Pe-
ters. Markham pulled up his shoulders
in a shrug as he lifted the cup of steam-
ing coffee.

  “There's Nixon's first blunder,” he
SKATES, SKIS, AND A SAPHEAD

77

remarked. “He lias a habit of going it
blind, and without giving any prepara-
tion to the work ahead of him.”

  “I hope he won't meet with any acci-
dent,” murmured Mrs. Morton. “That
boy’s got a good heart, even if he is a
little odd.”

  “He'll always be a blunderer and a
saphead,” grnnted her husband. "If
the stolen horses are recovered, it’ll be
Markham who makes it possible."

  Markham did not tarry long over his
toft'ee. Within a few moments after
Peters left he was out in the nipping air.
Hesther, a shawl over her head, stepped
through the doorway to watch while he
crossed the trampled snow around the
ranch house and then knelt to thrust
the toes of his shoes in the Bilgeri bind-
ing of the skis and to buckle the ankle
straps. He arose presently, and, shout-
ing a farewell to the girl, glided away
over the snowy level gracefully, swiftly,
with his ski stick biting into the snow
and propelling him onward.

  “He’s doing a man’s work this night,”
murmured Hesther, “and he will win—
just as he won at Devil’s Lake City
carnival.” Then she went back into the
house, to describe in detail how Peters
had lost 'and Markham had won in the
winter sports’ contests at the lake.

III.

  Puyallup River had many twists and
turns in the thirty miles which it cov-
ered between Morton’s Ranch and Ros-
common. Passing within a stone’s
throw of the ranch house, it flowed al-
most due north for six miles, then, en-
tering the rough hill country, it doubled
back on its course for three miles,
rounded the base of Rawson’s Bluff, in
a four-mile curve, came east by south
around the base of Bear Butte, and then
curved in a northwesterly direction for
the last twelve miles that carried it
through the outskirts of the county seat.
Markham, on his skis, could con a

direct course to Roscommon, bisecting
the river at three points, and finally
climbing the butte for a long glissade
into the town. That glissade, right into
the edge of the settlement, measured
ten miles of down grade. The slopes
of Bear Butte were smooth, and directly
under its crest the descent was steep.
A mile of this, and then the course fell
away more gently.

  Markham, if he made good time to
the eastern base of Bear Butte, would
very likely reach that particular spot
ahead of Peters, for he would have to
travel only seven miles, while Peters
was going sixteen. Where Markham
would lose would be in climbing the
butte; and where he would make up his
loss would be in the long glissade down
the opposite side.

  At the river’s edge, Peters screwed
the skates into his heels, pulled the
straps tight, and buckled them, then put
on his bearskin gloves and struck out.
He was well away toward Rawson’s
Bluff before Markham made his first
crossing of the river, near the ranch
house.

  The ice was in splendid condition. A
strong wind had swept it clean of loose
snow, save here and there at the turns,
where drifts had formed. Then a slight
thaw, a few days before, had been fol-
lowed by a tightening of the cold, and
all rough spots had been smoothed
away.

  Markham, whose steel runners were
the very last word in all-metal skates,
excelled as a figure skater. He could
cut all sorts of graceful figures on the
ice, and. with Hesther Morton, would
do a sort of waltz, which the girl seemed
to consider rare sport. Peters, on the
other hand, was not proficient at that
sort of thing. He preferred straight
skating, possibly because he realized
that fancy capers were quite out of his
line. The steel, wood, and leather with
which he was shod seemed best adapted
to straightaway work, anyhow.
78

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

  Peters knew every foot of the river
between the ranch and Roscommon. He
had covered that long stretch of ice
several times while getting himself in
trim for the skating race at Devil's
Lake. There was “white ice" under the
shelter of the bluff and the butte, caused
by a fall of snow while the first crystals
were forming. This had been full of
air bubbles, and had been treacherous
up to the time the severe frost had fol-
lowed the thaw. After that the lique-
fied snow had congealed into a sound
and superlative smoothness. There was
not a spot to be feared on the entire
course.

  With long, steady, swinging strokes,
Peters swept around the first turn and
came south on the stretch which Mark-
ham was to cross in order to thread a
seam through Ravvson’s Bluff. But, al-
though the moonlight was brilliant upon
the sparkling snow crust, he could see
nothing of his rival. It might be, he
reasoned, that Markham had already
effected his second crossing of the river,
and was even then in the gash that cut
through the bluff. Peters ground his
teeth, and, with his runners ringing
musically, passed like a gliding specter
around the bluff’s base. Three miles
farther, and he might obtain a view
of Markham as he emerged from the
shallow defile and pushed over the open
levels toward the butte.

  He was having queer thoughts about
Markham. Why had the fellow pro-
tested against any attempt to reach Ros-
common and notify the sheriff? Then,
in the face of his protests, why had he
determined to pit his skis against Pe-
ters’ skates—to accomplish the thing
which he had averred could not be ac-
complished ?

  There was but one answer to this, ac-
cording to Peters’ conclusions. Mark-
ham could not bear to think that Peters
might succeed, that he might win favor-
able notice from Uncle Silas, and that
he might gain some credit in the eyes

of Hesther Morton ! Markham was not
thinking of saving the horses; no, he
was impressed with the idea of his own
prestige and importance, and he could
not take a chance of losing out to a
“saphead.” That was all there was to it,
so Peters believed.

  A determination to win that race and
save the stolen stock grew stronger and
stronger in Peters’ breast. Here, after
the miserable failures at Devil’s Lake,
was a most unexpected opportunity to
retrieve himself. It was his business to
make the most of it.

  Three straight miles lay ahead of
him to the westward of the bluff. Com-
ing down the stretch like the wind, he
surveyed the shadowy opening of the
swale, in the hope of catching a glimpse
of Markham. But the ski runner was
not in sight. In the distance, the spar-
kling crest of Bear Butte could be
vaguely determined; yet, between the
bluff and the butte no dusky figure
could be seen toiling on the skis.

  “He hasn’t cleared the bluff yet,”
thought Peters exultantly. “I’m leading
him, by ginger!”

  The river, at the end of the three-mile
stretch, described a curve like a gigan-
tic horseshoe. In its first beginning,
the stream had attempted to run west
by south; meeting the rough country,
its course had been deflected toward the
northwest; then, striking the wide-
spreading base of Bear Butte, it had
followed northeast and east on its way
around the huge uplift. On clearing
the butte, the Puyallup struck off due
northwest, and so, in a dozen miles,
came to Roscommon.

  Peters, although he had not timed
himself, knew he had been making ex-
cellent speed. He was seventeen miles
from the ranch, and coming rapidly un-
der the shadow of the butte. Markham
could scarcely climb the massive “rise”
and glissade into Roscommon ahead of
him. So far as he had been able to
SKATES, SKIS, AND A SAPHEAD

79

discover, Markham was not yet any-
where near Bear Butte, nor-

  "Peters! I say, Peters!”

  Peters was amazed. Above his ring-
ing steel a sharp cry echoed in the frosty
air. It was Markham's voice, and call-
ing his name. Peters dug into the ice
with the heels of his runners and came
to a quick halt.

  “That you, Porter?’’ he called.

  “Yes. Nix. I’m in hard luck. Stop
a minute, will you ?”

  The voice came from a shadowy over-
hang at the butte's foot. Peters skated
toward the black cavity, and was met
by the dusky figure of Markham, limp-
ing out of the darkness and across the
ice. Markham had his skis under his
arm.

  “By George!” cried Peters. “You
got here in a hurry! What’s wrong?”
“I fell from a six-foot bank, as I
was crossing the river, and splintered
one of my skis,” was the answer, “and
I can't go on with the wood runners.
1 reckon I'll take your skates,” Mark-
ham added coolly.

  Peters caught his breath. "I reckon
you won’t,” he returned, with spirit.
“I’m going on to Roscommon, start the
sheriff and a posse for the dry wash,
and get a doctor for Bailey. What do
you take me for?”

  “A saphead—just a plain, everyday
saphead,” said Markham. “Down on
the ice, Peters, and off with those
skates ! Pronto is the word ! There's
no time to lose!”

  Markham had dropped the skis, and
stripped a glove from his right hand.
The bare hand was in the pocket of his
leather coat. Suddenly, as the two stood
facing each other, the hand emerged
from the pocket with a short, uglv-
looking bulldog revolver. Markham
leveled the weapon, and the moonlight
glinted frostily on the barrel.

  Again Peters caught his breath. He
was dazed, bewildered. To be threat-
ened in that manner by one whom he

had believed to be a friend—or, if not
a friend, at least a fellow employee of
Uncle Silas Goddard, with interests in
common—was a decided shock.

  “You crazy, Porter?” demanded Pe-
ters, when he could find his tongue.

  “Hardly,” was the reply, with a
husky, ill-omened laugh. “It will be a
long time before you reach Rosmom-
mon, my laddybuck. Take off those
skates, I tell you! I mean business, Pe-
ters !”

  There was that in Markham’s words
and manner which left no doubt of the
fact that he meant business. Peters was
wild with indignation and anger, but
he was also helpless.

  "What’ll Reece Bailey say to this,
when I tell him?” he asked, dropping
to the ice and working at the skate
straps.

  “We’ll cross that bridge when we get
to it,” was the response. "Throw the
skates over here when you get ’em off.
You had to butt into this deal with the
fool suggestion of getting word to the
sheriff, now, blame you, take your medi-
cine !”

  “You're bound to win,” grunted Pe-
ters, “if you have to do it with a gun!
You ain't square, Markham. 1 may be
a good deal of a saphead, but I found,
when it was too late, that one of my
skis and one of my skate straps had
been tampered with at Devil's Lake.
You did that!”

  “Why didn't you tell Hesther about
it?” jeered Markham; “or the judges
of the contests? Didn’t you have nerve
enough to put up a holler?” Peters
gave the skates a shove across the ice.

  Ten feet away, Markham sat down
to screw the skates to his heels and ad-
just the straps. The revolver lay at
his side, and he watched Peters sharply
as he worked.

  Peters, a desperate purpose forming
in his mind, was awaiting the moment
when he could spring to the attack. He
was not to be conquered in that way.
80

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

There was plenty of fight in him, and
Markham would discover it to his cost.

 Markham worked rapidly. The
skates were on, and snugly buckled, and
he was just rising when Peters went
after him, with a short run and a slide.
But if Peters was quick, Markham was
a shade quicker.

  Crack!

  The revolver exploded in the'air, and
Peters’ left arm seemed suddenly to
have been scorched with a hot iron. The
shock caused him to lose his footing,
and he fell in a sprawl on the slippery
surface of the river.

  "You would have it!” shouted Mark-
ham fiercely. “That's something more
for you to tell Bailey!”

  The last words faded in mellow ring
of sliding steel. Peters, sitting up on
the ice, and clasping his numbed arm
with his right hand, watched Markham
slip from sight around the curve at the
foot of Bear Butte.

IV.

  Peters was thinking less of the pain
in his arm than he was of the rascally
work of Peter Markham. The fellow
must be mad, to make such an attack!
He had planned the whole thing, of
course, and had armed himself before
leaving Morton’s. Reaching the butte
ahead of Peters, he had gone into hid-
ing against the moment Peters should
come skating down the river. Then, by
way of making his treachery more con-
temptible, he had called to Peters for
help, only to threaten him with a re-
volver and steal his skates.

  “You bet I’ll tell Bailey!” muttered
Peters. “I reckon this'll cook your
goose with Goddard, even if you do get
to Roscommon in time to have the sher-
iff head off the bronks! What can a
fellow make of a man like him, acting
thataway ?”

With difficulty, Peters removed his
coat and shoved up the shirt and

sweater sleeves. The wound was in the
forearm, and was bleeding profusely.
With a bandanna handkerchief he
bound up the injury tightly, knotting the
handkerchief corners with his fingers
and his teeth; then, getting into his
coat again, he began considering his
next move.

  It was twelve miles by river to Ros-
common, and eighteen miles back to the
ranch. Even if it was now useless for
him to get to the town, in order to
carry the news of the horse stealing to
the sheriff, returning to Morton's would
have been a fierce pull on his strength,
and he dared not attempt it. He would
make his way to Roscommon. If lie
could reach the settlement before Mark-
ham left it, he would lodge a complaint
against the treacherous scoundrel, and
have him held in the town jail. Peters
was burning for revenge. Yes, that is
what he would do.

  He got up, feeling a little dizzy and
faint, and started down the river. His
feet struck against Markham’s skis, and
another idea came to him. Perhaps he
could tinker up the splintered ski and
use the runners. After the accident
that had lost him the jump at Devil's
Lake, Peters had bought a little fine
wire for the mending of his own broken
runner. That wire was still in his
trousers pocket, and it might be that
he could use it in fixing Markham’s
splintered ski.

  Picking up both runners, and holding
the damaged one between his knees, he
struck a match and made a careful ex-
amination. The stout ash had been
cracked under the binding mechanism.
A few wraps of fine wire might yet
make the runner serve. With his jack-
knife, Peters dug a shallow groove
across the ski’s bottom, and in this he
imbedded the half dozen coils of wire
that lie wove over and over and made
fast on the upper surface.

  For himself, he had never fancied
that Bilgeri binding. Although light,
SKATES, SKIS, AND A SAPHEAD

81

and well made, it was not nearly so
strong or dependable as the Lilienfield
binding, with which Peters’ own skis
were equipped.

  Peters' work had been done at a tre-
mendous disadvantage. He could work
with one hand only, and in lieu of his
other hand he made shift to use his teeth.
The moon, although brilliant, left much
to be desired in the matter of light for
such fine and exacting labor, and sense
of touch had to help him where that
of sight failed. In the main, however,
he did very well, all things considered,
and when he had secured his feet in
the bindings he arose on the ash run-
ners with a feeling of exultation in his
breast. Where was the stick? His
search for it carried him to the over-
hang, and there he found, not only the
ski stick, but two strips of gunny sack-
ing, each heavily knotted in the middle.

  Those strips of sacking rather puz-
zled Peters. Markham had brought
them as an aid in getting up the steep
eastern slope of the butte. But why
had he prepared himself with them if
his object was to waylay Peters and
secure the skates?

  “Markham always figures a matter
out both ways,” Peters reflected. “He
brought the gun to help corral the
skates, but, if I happened to beat him
to the butte, then he'd have to keep right
011 over the rise. If he couldn’t do one
thing, then he was ready to do the other.
W'hat’s more, he splintered that ski
a-purpose, and he didn't do it until he
knew I was behind him at the over-
hang. He didn't want me to have a
chance to use the ski, that’s all. It
never occurred to him that I’d have
something along to use in patchin’ up
the runner. That’s once, anyhow, that
a saphead fooled him.”

  Peters shuffled his way to a point be-
yond the overhang, then paused to tie
the strips of cloth around the skis, knot
side down. This maneuver would help
to keep him from sliding backward.

  He flashed an upward look at the
difficult grade he was to negotiate. If
his heart failed him for a moment, be-
cause of his useless arm and the shock
his whole body had suffered because of
the wound, it only resulted in letting
him get a firmer grip on his resolution
and strength. The wound was nothing
serious, being merely a clean gash
through the fleshy part of the forearm.
He would not allow it to endanger the
success of his night’s exploit. Mark-
ham must be made to suffer for his law-
lessness, and it was up to Peters to sec
that he did not escape.

  The first easy slopes of the butte
were taken just as one might travel
over level ground—a forward move-
ment, in long, gliding steps. The skis
were merely advanced, never lifted. As
the ascent stiffened, Peters turned out
the ends of the runners slightly, in what
is known as the “half fishbone step.”
There was a trick in this, and Peters
had long since acquired it. Steeper and
steeper became the course as the snowy
slope was climbed, and the full fishbone
step was gradually brought into requisi-
tion.

  For such a long ascent the work was
extremely tiring, and Peters was forced
to do a number of "serpentines,” tack-
ing back and forth, and executing the
difficult “about face” at each turn.

  A good deal of time was required in
making the climb, but Peters’ handicap
of awkwardness had taught him how
to be patient and doggedly resolute in
carrying out his aims. He kept un-
flinchingly to his tiresome task, and in
due course was rewarded by finding
himself on the flat crest of Bear Butte,
ready for the long glissade. By this
time his sporting blood was aroused,
and he looked forward with keen enjoy-
ment to the breathlessly swift glide that
lay ahead of him.

  He rested a few moments, tucked the
hand of his injured arm into the front
of his coat, removed the knotted strips
82

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

from the runners, took firm hold of
the ski stick, and then let himself over
the butte's crest.

  With skis so close together that they
touched, the point of one leading the
other by a foot, body not bent, but in-
clined forward, Peters was off down the
steep slope like a bullet out of a gun.

  He was at a disadvantage in not hav-
ing both hands for use with the stick.
Where it was necessary to brake, and
avoid a small crevasse or a bowlder,
Peters did it entirely with the skis, by
executing the “telemark swing.” It
was not often that he was confronted by
such an emergency, but he was profi-
cient in that method of dodging possi-
ble disaster, and unhesitatingly availed
himself of it.

  At lightning speed he shot-down the
butte, the air humming in his ears and
snowy particles stinging his face. His
exhilaration mounted higher and higher.
In his delight over the coasting he for-
got the stolen horses, the treachery of
Markham, and the reprisal he was
counting upon when he should reach
Roscommon. His every faculty was
called into pla}', and busied itself with
the flying skis to the exclusion of every-
thing else.

  The slope flattened, and Peters’ speed
lessened perceptibly, although he was
still going at a rate comparable to that
of a limited express train. On and on,
mile after mile, his sensation was that
of one falling through space. He
scarcely realized that he had any con-
nection whatever with the white-clad
earth beneath him.

  At last, in the distance, he saw a
twinkling light, and a confused blur of
buildings. Roscommon! The town
jumped toward him as though crazily
bent on fouling his course. He gave
rather more attention to Roscommon
than to the slope ahead of him, and
suddenly he pitched into the air as the
runners hit an obstacle. He fell with
the skis braided around his neck, fell,

hard upon the cleared tracks of the
Roscommon railroad yards, and so sud-
denly that he had no time to realize he
had gone over the embankment at the
side of the network of rails.

  Instinctively he tried to lift himself,
only to drop in an awkward huddle,
with a blaze of shooting stars criss-
crossing before his eyes. Then the
bright lights faded, and Nixon J. Peters
quietly went to sleep.

V.

  When Peters awoke, he found him-
self on a bench in the railroad station.
A local train was expected, and there
had been men on the station platform
when Peters shot over the railroad em-
bankment and hit the tracks. Three
or four of the men went forward to
investigate the strange phenomenon,
and they were the ones who had brought
Peters into the waiting room. They
had no more than laid him down, and
stripped off his skis, when he opened
his eyes.

  “Sheriff gone to the dry wash yet?”
he inquired faintly.

  A man bent over him. “I’m Jordan,
the sheriff,” said he. “What dry wash
do you mean ? Why should I go there ?”

 “Has—hasn’t Markham reached
town ?” went on Peters.

  “Haven't seen a thing of Markham.
Oh!” Jordan exclaimed. “I know you
now. You are Bailey’s man, Peters,
from the Morton Ranch. Why were
you sliding into town, at this time o’
night, on a pair of skis? Thunder! It
was as much as your life was worth!
You-”

  “A gang of horse thieves ran off our
horses—more’n fifty of ’em,” cut in Pe-
ters wildly. “It happened early in the
evening. Get a posse, Jordan, and head
off the gang at Long Knife Dry Wash.
When Markham shows up, leave some-
body in town to arrest him. He shot
me in the arm. And send a doctor to
SKATES, SKIS, AND A SAPHEAD

83

Morton’s to look after Bailey. He’s
wounded, too! I-”

  Then Peters went to sleep again.
When he next came to himself, and
picked up the chain of events, he was
in a bed in a room at the Roscommon
House. Broad day looked in at the
room windows, and Peters could gaze
dreamily out at roofs covered with
snow, and sparkling under the sun’s
rays as though covered with diamonds.
Hours had passed since he had had the
brief awakening in the railroad station.
Now he was in a comfortable bed, his
left arm neatly bandaged, and Toynbee,
the proprietor of the hotel, was sitting
beside him.

  “Did they get Markham, Toynbee?”
asked Peters.

  The landlord was reading a newspa-
per. He jumped in his chair as the
unexpected words reached him from the
bed.

  “Oh, you’re back, eh?” said he.
“You’ve been a long time on the road,
although the doctor said we needn’t to
mind. Get Markham? Well, I guess!”
And Toynbee chuckled. “Jordan got
him, and four others, along with the
stolen horses. They were pushing
through the dry wash when the sheriff
and his party arrived there. You bet
they got him, Peters, and red-handed at
that. Big surprise to everybody. Why,
Markham had put the whole thing up!
He was back of the entire scheme! It
has all come out. Markham won't talk,
but the rest of the gang feel different.
Across the line there were men waiting
to take the horses and rush ’em off
where they’d never be found. Say! I
guess you ought to have a medal for
what you did last night! How are you
feeling, anyhow?”

  Peters was stunned. Porter Mark-
ham one of the horse thieves! Could
Peters believe his ears? Markham had
had a reason for driving the horses off
their feet on the return from Devil’s
Lake. With all the other stock taken

from Morton's, it hail been Markham’s
plan to make the sleigh team useless, so
far as a drive of twenty miles to Ros-
common, with news for the sheriff, was
concerned ; and Markham had protested
against Peters’ plan of using skates in
carrying an alarm to Roscommon; but
when the method had been put into ef-
fect, in spite of him, Markham had
taken to the skis and had waylaid Pe-
ters at the eastern foot of Bear Butte.
In the light of recent events, the motive
for that attack could be seen at an even
more treacherous angle. Markham’s
scheme was not to beat Peters to Ros-
common with news for the sheriff, but
to keep all knowledge of the robbery
from the authorities until the stolen
horses had been delivered across the
line. Instead of making for the town,
after securing Peters’ skates, Markham
had followed the river bends beyond the
town, to a point where he could join
his rascally confederates with the horse
herd.

  “How do you feel, Peters?” repeated
Toynbee, after waiting a long time for
a reply.

  “Mighty nigh locoed,” said Peters.

  “No wonder! Say, you hit the rail-
road iron with your head when you
went over the embankment. Any other
head but yours would probably have
been cracked.”

  “You can’t crack a saphead,” com-
mented Peters, but not in bitterness.

  Next day, when Peters was thinking
of getting out of his bed and helping
drive’the horses back to the ranch, no
less a person than Uncle Silas Goddard
walked into his room. Uncle Silas was
an iron-gray man, big and broad, and
with a regular heart under his ribs. He
had received a telegram, signed Reece
Bailey, per Morton, and had come to
North Dakota by first train.

  There were greetings, not those of a
pleased employer for a worthy em-
ployee, but more in line with what one’s
84

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

next of kin might say in circumstances
altogether creditable. Bailey was “com-
ing fine,’’ and would be on the job again
in two or three weeks; and Peters, the
doctor said, would be fit as a fiddle in
seven days, at the outside. The horses
were on the way back to Morton's.

 “What about Markham?” queried
Peters.

  Uncle Silas Goddard’s cheery face
grew troubled. Well, Markham was
only a boy, and a very foolish one. He
had had a hard lesson. No stock had
been lost, and Uncle Silas felt that he
ought not to be too hard on Markham.
He was going to let Markham go, on a
promise to leave the country and make
something of himself in other parts.
Any one at all acquainted with Uncle
Silas might have known he would do
that very thing.

  “As for you, Nixon,” the big ranch-

owner went on, “there’s a job waiting
in Montana for a chap of your heft and
disposition. But do you want to re-
turn to the home ranch ?” he asked quiz-
zically. “Miss Hesther Morton sends
a very kindly message to you by me.
She is sorry for a lot of things, she
says, and hopes to see you right soon.”

  But Nixon J. Peters had seen another
light. He recalled his saphead dreams
of rescuing Hesther from a burning
house, and the shamed red stained his
cheeks to the tow-colored hair.

  “Miss Morton, all at once, is wasting
her consideration on the wrong party,
Uncle Silas,” said Peters. “Pm for
Montana as soon as you want me
there.”

  “Good!” exclaimed Uncle Silas, and
clasped Peters’ hand with a fervor that
suggested not only good will but hearty
congratulations.

  As the stenographer
closed the door behind her, Freeman
Judd spun his pivoted desk chair in a
half circle, and, with hands clasped
across his stomach, gazed thoughtfully
at the calendar on the wall. For a full
minute he sat this way without moving;
then, whirling back again, he pressed
the button at the side of his desk.

  A freckle-faced, fed-headed office
boy answered.

  “George,” said Mr. Judd, “I guess
he’s waited long enough. Tell him to
come in now.”

  The office boy grinned appreciatively.
A moment later the door opened to ad-
mit a dapper young man, who looked
something as Freeman Judd must have
looked twenty-five years before.

  The embarrassment as father and
son faced each other ended when Judd,
senior, said brusquely, “Sit down,
Vern; sit down ! Chairs don’t cost any-
thing in this office. What’s the matter
now? What are yoH here for?”

  The boy looked him frankly in the
eyes. “Thompson Brothers fired me
this morning.”

  If his father was irritated, his face
did not betray the fact. “As a busi-
ness man,” he grunted, “you don’t seem
to be much of a success.”

  The boy swallowed. It was like
downing a bitter dose of medicine.
“You see, father,” he blurted out, “I’ve
come to believe you were right and I
was wrong. I want to start in the busi-
ness here just the way I did four years
ago.”

  “Ah, you do!” Freeman Judd sur-
veyed his son a little grimly. “Suppose
we review this thing, Vern. You’re a
rich man’s son. When you went to
college, I gave you a good big allow-
ance. I wanted you to have all the ad-
vantages that I had missed. What did
you do there? Did you stick to any-
thing? Did you learn one thing—one
single thing—thoroughly ?”

  “Not a thing,” admitted Vernon Judd
cheerfully, “unless you count basket
ball.”

  “Basket ball ? H’m ! I don’t see how
that is going to help you make a suc-
cess of life. Well, you graduated,-
though Heaven knows how, and came
in here. Three months later you quit.
Things were too slow for you. Your
grandfather had left you a little legacy,
and you wanted action.”

  The younger Judd chuckled. “Didn’t
I get it?”

  “You did,” admitted his father, al-
86

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

lowing his face the luxury of a smile;
“you got the action and the Wall Street
boys got your money. Since then you’ve
tried a dozen things, never holding on
to one of them longer than a month or
six weeks. And now you breeze back
and ask me to give you another chance.”

  The boy leaned forward earnestly,
his mouth tightening into the same lines
of determination that marked his
father’s.

  “Dad, a week ago I took myself into
my room and had a frank talk with
myself. When I was through, I’d made
up my mind to quit being a chump and
to turn myself into something useful.
I wasn’t fired from Thompson Brothers’
because I didn’t do my work, but be-
cause I wouldn’t stand for a piece of
dirty office politics. I’ve found myself.
This time I’ll stick it out. Do I get
another chance, or not ?”

  Freeman Judd looked the boy over,
much as though he were eying a horse.
“Vern,” he said finally, “I never thought
I’d do such a thing, but I’m inclined to
give you another go at your old job.
I know you’ve got the goods, and I

believe at last-” A knock at the

door stopped him. “Come in, Wallber.”

  “Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Judd,”
said the head clerk, as he entered, with
an envelope in his hand, “but the man
who brought this said it had to have an
answer right away.”

  As he made out the letterhead, the
boy’s face became a shade paler. His
father scanned the communication with
a frown.

 “Vern”—the voice had taken a
harsher tone—“this is a statement from
Flett & Son. They say you owe them
one hundred and fifteen dollars for
some evening clothes, and that if it isn’t
paid they will be obliged to sue.”

  “It’s a rotten trick, dad. I bought
the stuff eight months ago; I’d have
paid for it, too, if 1 hadn’t lost my jobs
while I was laying aside the money. I
haven’t been dodging them. I ex-

plained how it was. Anyhow, they
hadn’t any business sending a bill to

you. I’m over age and-”

  His father stood up abruptly. “It’s
legalized blackmail,” he snapped. “They
think I’ll pay this rather than allow it
to get into the papers. And they’re
right.” He paced up and down the
room without speaking. Suddenly he
faced the boy. “Vern, I’ve changed my
mind about you. I don’t want you in
here until you can prove to me that you
are able to get a job paying enough to
live on, and to hold it for a reasonable
time.”

 “But, dad-”

  His father held up an interrupting
hand. “No use talking. I have de-
cided. When you have learned to stand
alone on your own two feet, then you
may come in with Judd & Company—
not before. Any more bills? No? All
right; I’ll pay this one. Then I intend
giving you an order on the cashier for
thirty dollars. Take that and buy a
railroad ticket that will land you the
greatest distance from New York. I
don’t care where you go; the only con-
dition is that you finally land a job, and
that you keep it for a full six months.
That shall be the test. Understand?
Six months in the same position.”
Vernon Judd nodded soberly.

 “When you’ve shown you can do
that, and have lived on what you earn
without running bills, come back "and
you’ll find a desk waiting for you. If
you can’t do it, I don’t w'ant to see you
again. Well?”

  "That’s a fair proposition, dad. Six
months at the same job on a living
wage. I’ll do it.”

  Freeman Judd sucked in his lower
lip. “Here’s your order for the thirty
dollars, then. And remember, Vern,
nobody wants to see you win more than
your old dad. Good-by. As you go
through the outer office, tell Wallber I
want to see him.”
THE BASKET-BALL BOSS

87

II.

  The round football struck the branch
and descended, bouncing merrily upon
the head of the innocent bystander.

  “We didn’t mean to, mister,” apolo-
gized the small boy who had done the
kicking.

  “Don’t mind me. I’d rather get a
crack on the head than not.” In spite
of a stomach that lacked breakfast,
Vernon Judd managed a smile as he
tossed back the “association” football.

  Hard knocks aplenty had toughened
Vern since the day the train dropped
him into the bustling Middle Western
city, an unknown person, in an unfa-
miliar place; and, what was more, he
was without trade or profession. For
three days he had been an “extra”
hotel porter; for a week, till the dull
season set in, he had opened boxes in
a department-store basement; and twice
he had earned scraps of money by un-
loading trucks. But of continuous em-
ployment he had found none.

  He squared his shoulders now at the
cheering discovery that both factories
had entrances within a hundred feet of
where he was standing. Along the big
shop on his right ran the sign, “Landon
Sporting Goods—Used All Over the
World”; across the street, equally large
letters shouted, “Bloss Company—Per-
fection Sporting Goods—For Sale
Everywhere.”

  Both Landon and Bloss, the original
owners, were dead; but for years the
managers of the rival factories had
waged an advertising war from Cairo,
Illinois, to Cairo, Egypt. Basket balls,
baseballs, footballs, hockey sticks, bats,
gold clubs, boxing gloves, and every-
thing else for the athlete had been
boosted and knocked by each side. And
here the two competitors glowered at
each other less than a stone’s throw
apart. To Vern, who all his life had
read their advertising and used their
goods, it seemed like coming suddenly

  upon the Duke of Wellington and Na-
poleon Bonaparte.

  The job hunter meditated. “Let’s
see. The year we had the big cham-
pionship team we used the Bloss basket
ball; the year after that we used the
Landon. It wasn’t as good, and we
weren’t as good. All right, Bloss, old
boy, you'll get the first chance.”

  He entered boldly. A pugnacious of-
fice boy on the other side of a wooden
railing stopped him.

 “Whatcha want?” demanded the
guardian of the gate suspiciously.

  Hard experience had taught Vern
that discretion is sometimes half the
battle.

  “I want to see the superintendent,”
he answered evasively.

  “Creighton? Lissen, if you wanta
job I’ll save you a lot of time right off
the bat by tellin’ you there ain’t none.”
“You tell Mr. Creighton that Mr.
Judd—Mr. Vernon Judd, of New York
—wants to see him,” insisted the Waller,
with as much haughtiness as a man
without a thin dime can muster.

  Reluctantly the office boy slouched
toward the door marked “Private.”

  “All right,” he said, emerging a min-
ute later. “Go on in.”

  Vern had no more than entered the
room before he saw that his hopes were
doomed to failure. He had counted
upon finding the superintendent an ath-
letic type of man, to whom his own
experience in athletics might appeal.
Instead, he was greeted by a frowning,
cigar-chewing individual, who plainly
had never taken an active part in any
game except from the side lines.

  “Well,” he snapped, as he thrust some
papers under the desk blotter, “what do
you want? A job?” His voice rasped
like a file. “Can’t you see that sign
out there? Go to the other entrance
between seven and eight Thursday
morning. Don’t take up my time.”

  “I know I am taking up valuable
time, Mr. Creighton,” Vern returned
88

quietly, “but I think I’ve had valuable

experience that might fit me for-”

  "Haven't a thing for you. No use
talking.” The shrill voice rose higher.
“Not a thing. Nothing at all. Good
morning 1”

  The young man found himself on the
street again, with a sense of injustice
rankling in his mind. As he stood there
trying to soothe his temper before
tackling the Landon people, his eye
caught the end of a tiny tragedy.

  He heard an excited little scream.
He saw a white-sleeved arm thrust
frantically from one of the second-
story windows of the Landon factory.
He watched a square of snowy linen
float out on a passing gust of wind.
For a second it seemed that it would
escape the clutches of the waiting tree
and come safely to the ground ; but just
at the critical moment the breeze died,
dropping the white handkerchief, like
an opened parachute, across a network
of autumn foliage. There it rested,
twenty feet or more above the sidewalk
and a dozen from the girl at the
window.

  -Vern looked up. The instinct of mere
politeness that had first urged him to
offer assistance tautened into enthusi-
asm. He told himself the girl was more
charming than any girl he had ever
seen.

  “I’ll get it,” he called encouragingly,
though without the slightest idea in
the world how he might bring about
that end.

  “If you will, please,” she begged.
“It’s a bit of real Irish lace, and I
haven’t any business owning it—let
alone losing it.”

  As he stared at the girl and the hand-
kerchief, the inspiration came.

  “Here, buddie,” he said, “lend me
your football for a minute.”

  Obediently the small boy tossed it
over. It was round, but slightly smaller
and not as heavy as the basket ball to
which he had been accustomed. Also,

  the handkerchief was much higher than
any basket for which he had tried in a
game.

  He poised it carefully, swinging it
up and down in his two hands to gauge
the weight. Then, with a quick flirt of
his arms, he shot it up and over.

  It curved in a long arc and plumped
squarely into the middle of the white
patch in the tree. The twigs bent. The
handkerchief fluttered down into his
waiting hands.

  As he stood there brushing the dust
from the fragile fabric, the girl from
Landon’s hurried out to him. “I want
to thank you,” she said gratefully.

  He looked at her. Risking the chance
of being thought impudent, he said
boldjy, “And I want to know you. My
name is Judd—Vernon Judd.”

  She stared straight into his eyes for
a moment, and was apparently satisfied
with what she saw there. “I—I don’t
think it will be difficult,” she said, al-
most in a whisper, and turned away,
confused and blushing.

  “Say, young fella!” Vern turned to
the new speaker, who proved to be
Creighton, the disagreeable superin-
tendent of the Bloss factory, his face
now stretching into a smile. “Say! I
saw you make that basket-ball throw.
Where did you ever play? What! You
mean you were the center of that champ
team, the igir five that were never
licked ? Listen !” He put his hand in-
gratiatingly upon the boy’s arm. “We
have a basket-ball team in this factory
that’s a world-beater, and we need a
new man for center. Lemme see you
throw again, to make sure that other
toss wasn’t a lucky accident. Hey,
Murph 1”

  A carrot-topped head popped out of
the window over the entrance. “Get
the big wastebasket, Murph, and hold
it out there. 1 wanta see this guy make
a throw. Come on, you; I’ll give you
three chances, because it’s a hard shot.”

  For once in his life, Vern felt nerv-
THE BASKET-BALL BOSS

ous. The skill that had made him star
of a star team seemed to have oozed
quite away.

  “Try!” the girl whispered. “You can
do it. I know you can.”

  Again he poised the ball and threw.
Then, holding his breath, he watched
it wing its curved path through the
air—up, over, down ; down, fair, and
true, into the mouth of the waiting
wicker basket.

  “Yea, bo!” shouted the enthusiastic
Murphy. “He can thread the needle all
right.”

 “Look here, my man!” Superin-
tendent Creighton caught Vern’s coat
lapel. “If I give you a job in the stock
room at ten a week, will you get out
and play on our basket-ball team this
winter?”

 “Will I?” asked Vern. “Try me
and see.”

  The girl from Landon’s extended her
hand to him. “Here’s wishing you good
luck,” she said, “till-”

  “Till when?”

  “Till the Bloss five meets the Landon
five—till your team plays ours.”

III.

  The “big five” from the Bloss Com-
pany lined up for the last minute of
the final practice before the champion-
ship game of the season.

  “Fast now!” jerked Captain “Red”
Murphy as he tossed the ball to “Curly”
Clark, who shot it to Clif Sefton, who
underhanded it to Felber, who dribbled
it a moment and then bounced it to
Vernon Judd, who completed the cir-
cuit and play by landing it neatly and
accurately in the basket.

  “Attaboy!” Red growled. “Now the
same thing on the other side, fellows—
and lots of pep!”

  Three times in succession, from three
different and difficult angles. Vern had
the pleasure of seeing his throws drop
safely inside the iron-rimmed net.

  “Good enough!” admitted Red.
“We'll show those Landon counterfeits
how to play to-morrow night. Now just
a minute.” He gathered the four reg-
ulars and the two substitutes about him.
“Boys, you all know we’ve had the best
season ever, and you all know this
mix-up with Landon is going to be our
biggest and most important game—and
our hardest. We want to win a little
worse than we want to go on living.”
He turned to Vernon Judd. “But
maybe you don’t understand what I
mean, Judd. Of course, you’ve only
been working here for five months and
you-”

  “Pretty nearly six,” corrected Vern.
He had been marking them off on the
calendar in his room.

  “Well, anyhow, unless you’ve been
through a basket-ball season with the
sporting-goods teams, you can’t know
how much it means to everybody in this
place to beat the Landon bunch. We’ve
got to do it, understand? Everybody
that works here feels the same as col-
lege fellows feel about their team. But
that ain’t all. This game gets into every
sporting page of every big newspaper in
the country. That means big advertis-
ing for the winners. And advertising
—sport-page stuff in news—means bet-
ter business, and better business means
more money to all of us—oh, not a
lot, maybe, but every little bit helps.
Get me ?”

  “I think I understand, Murph.”

• “Don’t do no harm to tell you, any-
how. The people we work for want
us to win; the people we work with
want us to win; we want to win our-
selves, the same as all real players do.
And, Vern”—he put his hand affection-
ately upon the young fellow’s jersey—
“if you shoot baskets Saturday night
the way you did just now, we will win—
sure!”

  As Vernon Judd left the factory’s
model gymnasium, where the team had
been holding its final practice, his body
90

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

tingled from the rough-towel rub that
followed the shower; but he also tin-
gled internally from sheer pleasure and
the joy of living. He had made good.
Coming into the Bloss works practically
a nobody, by merit alone he had won
friendship and respect, as well as a
place on a cracking good basket-ball
five. Best of all, for the first time in
his life, he was really interested in the
business of earning a living.

  Life as a whole had changed for him.
Hard work in his department had
brought him a boost in the pay envelope,
and his spare moments were busied with
a correspondence course in advertising.
He wished his father could see him
jump out of bed before the winter sun
rose., to hurry to a job that had become
a pleasure.

  He was so busy patting himself on
the back that only chance prevented his
colliding with a footfarer bound the
other way.

  “Hazel Wayne!” he blurted, as his
surprised glance showed him the girl
from Landon’s whose acquaintance he
had made through the rescue of the
lace handkerchief.

  Her face was pale and troubled. His
quick eye noted that she was holding
her library book almost ostentatiously.

  “Practicing hard, Vern?” she queried,
with a nervous little laugh. “Do you
really think you’re going to beat us Sat-
urday ?”

  “Sure of it, Hazel. You’d better
order your mourning suit right now.”
As he turned to walk with her toward
the corner where the Weldon Park cars
passed, it became growingly evident
that she was ill at ease.

  "What’s the matter, Hazel ?” he asked
finally. “If you don’t like something
I’ve said or done, tell me what it was
and I’ll apologize.”

  She shook her head. “No,” she said,
in a low voice, “no, there—there’s noth-
ing like that.”

  “But something’s wrong. What is it?

We’ve been pretty good friends for
over five months now. Surely you can
tell me.”

  Still she was silent.

  “Is it Creighton?” lie asked lightly.
“Haven’t you changed your mind about
him yet? Do you still think he’s a iow-
down-’ ”

  “Ss-s-sh!” She put her hand over
his mouth. “Don’t—don’t ever repeat
what I said about him—not to any-
body.”

  The Weldon Park car was bowling
nearer.

  “What’s wrong, Hazel?” he asked,
leaning closer. “Tell me.”

  It was plain she was struggling with
herself. Twice she opened her mouth
as though to speak. “No,” she said
firmly, in the end. “I—I haven’t any-
thing to say—nothing at all—except to
wish you luck to-morrow night. That’s
all.”

  Thirty seconds later, as Vern watched
the car whirl around the corner into
Moneta Avenue, his face bore a puz-
zled twist that was still in evidence after
a brisk walk had brought him back to
the factory entrance.

  “Hello, Billy!” he greeted the night
watchman. “I left some correspond-
ence-school stuff in my locker. I see
there’s a light in the supe’s office, so
it will be O. K. to pass me in.”

  With a grunt of assent, old Billy led
the way to the coat room and watched
Vern take the leaflets from the locker
shelf. Partly deaf, the watchman did
not heed the fragment of conversation
that floated down the corridor from
Creighton’s open door.

  “It’s all right,” the superintendent
was saying. “Monday night ends it.
I tell you, I’ve worked three months
getting things fixetl so I can tangle the
factory into a dozen knots just before
I-”

  The voice trailed away into a confi-
dential whispering that Vern could not
catch.
THE BASKET-BALL BOSS

91

  Vaguely the words disquieted him.
Was it possible that Creighton was all
Hazel Wayne had said? How could
she know? Hazel had never worked
in the Bloss factory. Her job was in
the Landon cashier’s office, and her
father and brother were employed in
the Landon leather-working depart-
ment. Probably her distrust of Creigh-
ton was a woman’s whim, sprung of the
natural bitterness resulting from his
successful management of the rival fac-
tory. But the boy’s suspicions were not
allayed at the sight of the superin-
tendent’s startled face when he mef
Vern at the outer door.

  “What the devil are you doing here?”
demanded Creighton, with a worried
glance at his late visitor, now turning
to trudge up the street.

  Vern’s answer seemed to reassure
him a little.

  “Come back,” he said abruptly.
“Come into my office. I meant to have
a little talk with you to-morrow, but we
might as well thresh it out now.”

  They sat down, facing each other.
“Judd,” said the superintendent, “you
like your job, don’t you?”

  Vern responded with all the enthusi-
asm he could muster. Creighton cocked
his cigar in the corner of his mouth.

  “You’ve done well here. You’re get-
ting fifteen a week now, and you are
in line to get more”—he paused—“if
you can keep your mouth shut and
obey orders.”

  The tone of the talk was objection-
able, but Vernon Judd’s six months
were too nearly at an end for him to
object. “Yes, sir,” he said quietly, “I
want to advance, of course.”

  Creighton leaned forward. “Judd,”
he confided, “there’s one way for you
to hang on to your job—and only one
way.” The change in his voice was
startling.

  “What do you mean?”

  The superintendent’s heavy eyebrows
contracted in a sinister line. “The

Bloss basket-ball team must lose to-
morrow night. You’ve got to let Lan-
don win. Understand? You—not the
team, but you—must see that the game
goes to them.”

  Vern could hardly believe he had
heard correctly. “Let Landon win!
You mean I—1 must throw the game?”
"Exactly! I'm glad you understand.
You know how to do it, of course, and
you can do it alone, because you make
more baskets than all the rest of them
put together. Get hurt; pretend you’ve
injured your arm. I don’t care how
you do it. But throw the game. Re-
member, I am your boss; I am the boss
of the Bloss basket-ball team. If you
expect to hold your job here, throw—
that—game!”

  Vern tried to think quickly. “But—

don’t you want-”

  ‘No, I don’t!” Creighton stood up,
glaring fiercely. “No! No! I want
the Blosses to lose that game. Never
mind why! That’s none of your busi-
ness. You want to hold your job. All
right. Throw that game. If you don’t,
the first thing I’ll do the following
Monday morning will be to fire you.”
“But I haven’t done anything to war-

  “Bah ! What are you doing here this
time of night? Do you think the police
will take your word before they take
mine? You’ve got folks somewhere.
How will they like it when they hear
you’ve been hauled into a police station
for being a petty thief? I can do it
all right, and I will—if you don’t throw
that game. Think it over. Don’t try
to double cross me, because it can’t be
done. That’s all.”

  Uneasy and troubled, Vernon Judd
spent his trip to the boarding house
trying to figure out a solution for the
mystery. What was the tangled un-
dercurrent? Was Creighton doing all
this simply to win a few dollars by bet-
ting? The notion was ridiculous. Then
what was the answer?
92

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

  On the table in the front hall of the
boarding house lay a note from his
father that thickened his difficulties. It
had come by the late mail. It ran:

  Dear Veiw: Glad to learn from your let-
ter that you’ve been doing so well. As long
as you have held out over five months al-
ready, I am going to make this the test.
Win or lose this Bloss job—that is the de-
ciding factor in our wager as to the stuff of
which you are made. There is no reason
why you should be tired from Bloss & Com-
pany, and you must not let yourself be fired.
Stay with them till the six months are up—
or don’t come back.	Freeman Judd.

  Vern crumpled the letter in his hand.'
A pretty mess he had gotten into! All
his notions of honesty and sportsman-
ship recoiled at the thought of throw-
ing the game. Yet if he did not-

  “Br-r-r-r!” It was the boarding-
house telephone that roused him from
his reverie.

  “Hello! Excuse me for disturbing
you, but I must speak to Mr. Judd.

. . . Oh, is this you, Vern? This is
Hazel Wayne speaking. I must see you
now. I did have something to tell you
before, but I couldn’t make myself say
it. I’ve come all the way back to tell
it to you now. I am at Baker's Drug
Store, just a block from your house.
You’ll come right over, Vern, won’t
you ?”

 He buttoned his overcoat and
plunged out into the snowy night air.
Hazel was waiting for him just outside
the store, and as he appeared she hur-
ried toward him.

  “Vern, I had to see you to-night. I
hadn’t been to the library when I met
you before. I'd been waiting to talk to
you after you finished your basket-ball
practice. But I was—afraid.”

  “What is it?” he asked gently. “You
needn’t be afraid to tell anything to me,
Hazel.”

  She winked back one tear, but an-
other rolled down her cheek. “Vern,
you mustn’t think the—the wrong way
about me, but that basket-ball game to-

morrow night is a matter of life and
death—almost. And your team mustn’t
win. You must let the Landon five

beat you, because- Oh, I can’t tell

you why, but you must do it—you must.
For my sake, Vern!”

  She put both hands in his; then, be-
fore he could stop her, she was plung-
ing blindly toward the car. He watched
her as she stood a moment on the plat-
form. shoulders shaking and a handker-
chief to her eyes.

  Boss, father, and girl all urging him
to betray his trust! If he tried—if his
team won—he would lose his job, his
chance to make something of himself
in the bigger business world, and the
friendship of Hazel Wayne.

  For the first time since he had known
her, he realized that she was necessary
to his future happiness.

IV.

  As the referee’s whistle sent the
Bloss and Landon basket-ball teams
scurrying to their positions the follow-
ing evening, Hazel Wayne leaned for-
ward, with a quick intake of breath.
The game was about to begin. What-
ever the outcome might mean to the
workers and friends of the two fac-
tories. it meant infinitely more to her.
She told herself that the Landon five
would win, that it must win; but she
could not stifle the fear in her heart.

  “We’ll beat them,” said the girl at
her right, a fellow worker in the Lan-
don executive offices; “yes, we’ll beat

them if-”

  “-if Vern Judd doesn’t score too

many baskets against us,” finished an-
other Landon worker. “They say he’s
a wonder.”

  They both nodded sagely. The fear
in Hazel Wayne’s heart became a hys-
terical laugh. Of course! And Vern
wouldn’t try too hard, after what she
had told him; surely he wouldn’t!
“Ready, Landon?” asked the referee.
THE BASKET-BALL BOSS

93

"Ready, Bloss?” He shot the ball high
into the air, piped a shrill blast on his
whistle as it began to descend, and the
great game was on.

  The two opposing centers leaped for
the yellow ball. But Vernon Judd was
the quicker and the surer. His right-
hand slapped it, shooting it unerringly
to Captain Murphy. ' The thud hurt
Hazel Wayne like a blow.

  Dully, despairingly, she watched
Murphy catch the ball and pass it to
Clark, who shot it clear across the court
to Felber. By this time Judd was rac-
ing up the middle, practically un-
guarded. As the ball came to him in
a long, driving throw, he dropped it to
the floor, lapped it closer to the basket,
and then, with a pretty toss, looped it
upward and forward, scoring the goal.
At the end of the first minute, the score
stood : Bloss, 2; Landon, o.

  Huddled forward in her balcony seat
at the other end of the gymnasium,
Hazel Wayne allowed her breath to es-
cape with a gasp. He was trying, then ;
he was playing his best. Perhaps,
though, this was only a flash, to allay
suspicions. She would wait a little
while before she condemned him.

  Again the opposing centers leaped
for the ball; again Vern shot it to a
member of his team. This time, how-
ever, a lanky Landon youth intercepted
the throw from Murphy to Clark, and
the ball bounced out of bounds.

  It was Bloss’ throw-in, and Felber,
left guard, picked it up. Captain Mur-
phy called a quick signal, dodged un-
der the arm of the player who was
covering him, and took the throw in
the extreme left-hand corner of the
court, in Landon territory. The other
three players shifted to the boundary
lines. Vernon Judd, dodging free,
sped down the middle of the unpro-
tected court.

  Hazel Wayne watched him with fas-
cinated eyes. She knew the play; it
was the old crisscross forward pass.

Why didn’t the Landon boys cover
Vern? Must he assume the entire re-
sponsibility for the failure at the end?
For she told herself positively that he
would fail, that he had done all they
might reasonably expect of him.

  Murphy threw, gauging ball and
player to a nicety. Ten feet beyond
the center Vern caught it while run-
ning at full speed. Then, with a sin-
gle bewildering movement, he lifted it
high above his head and shot another
basket with clean precision.

  The score was now : Bloss, 4; Lan-
don, o. The Bloss adherents raised
the rafters with their mad cheering. In
the little balcony at the other end, Hazel
Wayne leaned back with clenched
hands.

  ‘‘He doesn’t care enough for me to
do what I asked,” she told herself bit-
terly; and she forced herself to smile
and nod when the girl at her right ex-
pressed the hope that something would
happen to Vern Judd before the game
was done. She wished something would
—almost! Not a serious hurt, of
course, but-

  By the time the ball was in play
again, the Landon team seemed to have
found itself. It reasoned rightly that
if the other four Bloss players were to
act as ‘‘feeders” to Judd, counting on
him to shoot the baskets, the thing to
do was to corner and pocket and guard
him so closely that he would have no
opportunity for unhampered throwing.
So effectively did they carry out this
campaign that for ten minutes or more
he was hopelessly entangled in the mesh
of opposing players.

  They went farther. The Bloss star
now began to bear the brunt of every
attack. His arm was hacked on throws.
He was tripped and fouled in all the ar-
tistic ways that could escape the eyes
of the official. Twice he went to the
floor with a crash, and once he was
tumbled headfirst out of bounds.

  But Hazel Wayne, watching the
94

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

game with the eye of an expert, dared
hope there was another reason for Ve-
non Judd’s sudden eclipse. And when
the Bloss rooters began to move un-
easily as he failed to score goals, and
shrunk back when he should have
charged, and submitted tamely to an
opponent’s making a pass when he
should have scrimmaged for a toss-up,
she grew more and more convinced
that he was no longer doing his best.

  A little later, the referee caught a
Landon player fouling him, and Vern
took the ball for a free throw. Pois-
ing it carefully, he shot it high in the
air, a good five feet to one side of the
basket. The Bloss sympathizers, mouths
open to cheer the scoring point, allowed
them to close with dumb amazement.
It wasn’t even a good try.

  “Now watch us 1” bragged the girl
by Hazel’s side. “I heard this after-
noon that Vern Judd had sold out, and
I guess he has.”

  Hazel looked at her with troubled
eyes. All at once she felt cold and sick,
as if something terrible had happened.

  “It looks that way,” agreed the girl
on her left. “Well, every man has his
price. Sometimes it’s money, some-
times business politics, and sometimes

a woman. I wonder-” And she

glanced at Hazel out of the tail of her
eye.

  “He—he wouldn’t sell out,” Hazel
told the girl weakly. “He isn’t that
kind.”

  The other laughed meaningly. “Isn’t

he ? Oh, I don’t- Look ! Look !

What do you think now?”

  Vern had been clear for once. The
ball came to him waist-high—and he
dropped it! Like a flash, the captain
of the Landon five caught it up and
shot it half the length of the court to
another player near the boundary line.
He passed it to a third, who scored a
neat goal on a side diagonal pass that
gave him the ball directly in front of
the basket.

  The score was now: Bloss, 4; Lan-
don, 2.

  “A goal at last,” said one of the girls,
sighing, “thanks to Mr. Judd.”

  “It was an accident,” defended Ha-
zel, angry without reason. “Anybody
is apt to drop the ball now and then.”

  Both teams scored again from the
field before the end of the first half,
and, during the last minute, Landon
crept closer on a palpable body-check
and free throw. When the whistle
blew, the score was: Bloss, 6; Lan-
don, 5.

  The teams changed goals. The Bloss
basket was now at the balcony end,
where Hazel Wayne could lean forward
and look straight down into it.

  On the toss-up that began the sec-
ond half, Vern’s attempt to whack the
ball was so weak that it brought a hiss
or two from the spectators. Worse
still, it made them watch him suspi-
ciously after that. When he failed
twice on free throws, and Murphy took
his place after the next foul, the crowd
began to mutter.

  “What do you think now about the
little angel named Vern Judd?” tri-
umphantly demanded the girl on Hazel’s
right.

  “I—I don’t want to talk, please!”
said Hazel. She couldn’t think; she
couldn’t understand her own emotions
or the wonderful metamorphosis of her
desires. Something had changed her
whole point of view. The integrity of
Vernon Judd meant more to her, all at
once, than anything else in the world.
Indignant at first that he should play
so well when she had asked him not to,
she was now praying that he would yet
do his best, that he would strive to win
like a clean sportsman, that he would
forget everything save his own honesty
and good name. If he wasn’t that kind

- She dared not complete the

thought.

  The game wore on, with varying for-
tunes. Players from first one team and
THE BASKET-BALL BOSS

then the other rushed the ball up and
down the court in zigzagging passes,
tapping, tossing, dribbling, shooting it
from man to man, looping it for the
basket, scrambling for it when it
missed, and trotting back to their posi-
tions when a goal was scored.

  Eventually the Landon five began to
assume the upper hand. There was no
denying that its center outclassed Vern
—or, at least, the Vern who was play-
ing to-night. He could throw better,
he could block better with his arm, he
could bat the ball better on the toss-
up. Because of these advantages, Lan-
don finally assumed the lead by the
slender margin of a single point in the
9—8 score.

  ‘if I could only talk to him for a
minute!” Hazel whispered to herself,
watching the player fail in encounter
after encounter. “If I could tell him
to forget me, and play—play! I must
have been mad to ask him to sacrifice
himself for me!”

  She watched, with staring eyes, as
he whacked clumsily at the ball.

  “Vern!” she called appealingly.
“Vern!”

  But he couldn’t hear her, of course.
The whole gymnasium was a Babel of
confused shouts. She could only lean
forward, with her hands clutching the
balcony rail, and follow him with her
eyes; gloating when he broke free or
handled the ball, wincing when oppo-
nents crashed into him, and telling her-
self always that if the opportunity
offered he would prove his true char-
acter yet.

  Some official at the side of the court
made an announcement. Hazel could
not hear what he said, and she turned
to a man behind her for the informa-
tion.

  “It’s the usual warning that there
are only three minutes more to play,”
he explained.

  Three minutes! Why, it couldn’t be
possible. There must be some hideous

mistake! Only three minutes before
the game ended—and Landon one point
ahead! That meant, unless some mir-
acle took place, Bloss was beaten—
beaten because a girl had asked a man
to forget honor for her sake.

  She had no watch. Yet she must
time the game to its bitter encl. The
torture of waiting constantly for the
final whistle, without knowing what
moment it might come, was too great
a strain to bear. Already her heart was
pounding-

  With a sudden inspiration, she
dropped the finger tips of her right
hand upon the pulse of the other wrist.
The normal heartbeat was a little over
seventy, wasn’t it? That meant prac-
tically a surge of the artery for every
second.

  She began to count—one, two, three,
four, five, and so on .up to the end of
the first minute. Out on the floor, the
ten players were scurrying here and
there like frightened ants, apparently
without aim or purpose, but in reality
dodging and running with preconceived
plans. But neither team scored again.
Nor did Vern stand out conspicuously
in the playing.

  The second minute measured itself
by her pulse beats. Now and then, dur-
ing some tense moment, her fingers
pressed so hard that she lost the steady
throb-throb of the wrist. But she knew
within a second or two when the final
minute of play began.

  The antlike players shifted toward
the Bloss goal. They were almost con-
stantly within throwing distance now,
and one accurate toss would win. A
dozen times the chance seemed to have
come, but always there was some block-
ing Landon opponent.

  “Fifty-two, fifty-three, fifty-four,”
Hazel went on mechanically. Then,
with a convulsive start, she realized
what the figures meant. They were the
final grains of sand in the hourglass.
Her finger tips shook free of the wrist,
96

WIDE-AWAKE- MAGAZINE

and it was three seconds before they
pressed the pulse again.

  “Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty,” she
resumed her counting, and lost the next
beat as her heart stopped with the shock
of apprehensive fear. Then she laughed
with nervous relief. Sixty pulse beats
weren’t quite a minute; there were
from ten to fifteen still to record be-
fore the final whistle.

  The ten players bunched just below
the balcony, in front of the Bloss goal.
As if realizing that the game depended
upon their work during the next few
seconds, they roused themselves above
their natural speed and skill.

  “Five fighting to prevent another
basket,” Hazel told herself, “and four
fighting just as hard to make it—no,
five! Five! He is trying! I know he
is! Oh, he must be!” But she could
not be quite sure.

  She saw Captain Murphy whisper
something to him. Vern nodded.
Then, so suddenly that she could
hardly follow the play, the Bloss team
scattered. The ball catapulted to the
side of the court, where the whacking
arm of Felber drove it back and to-
ward the other end. Murphy caught
it, whirled completely around to throw
off the guard hovering near him, started
a dribble, and finally made the pass
straight toward the Landon goal.

  Hazel raised her eyes in wonder-
ment. Nearly halfway down the court
Vern was sprinting. A warning cry
from the captain made him turn on his
heel and throw up his hands. But he
was an instant too late. Clean and
hard, with the crack of a gun, the ball
caught him full in the face, staggering
him backward.

  He stood there, blinking like one who
has suddenly lost his sight. The ball
was in his hands. From all angles
the Landon five rushed toward him.
His own players shouted for the ball.
His test had come, Hazel told herself
breathlessly. Then, as he made no

move, she stopped breathing alto-
gether.

  Her eyes were blurring with tears.
She lifted her handkerchief to dry
them, and saw that it was the square
of Irish lace he had rescued the day
they first met.

  “Vern!” she called, putting all the
breath of her full lungs into the cry.
“Vern!”

  He lifted his head. His eyes were
winking rapidly, and he had difficulty'
in seeing her at all.

  “Yern!” she called again. Leaning
far out over the protecting rail of the
balcony, she allowed her handkerchief
to flutter down toward the basket be-
low. It settled on the little ledge where
the bracket of the iron rim met the
wall.

  There must have come to Vernon
Judd the memory of that other time
when he had arched a ball up and over
and down upon Hazel Wayne’s Irish-
lace handkerchief. Perhaps the recol-
lection brought confidence in his ability
to do it again. Now, with a swinging,
overhand-loop shot, he hurled the yel-
low basket ball at the white target.

  Like a winging swallow it rose till
it reached the apex of its arc; then it
sped downward to the backing board
just behind the basket. The rebound
drove it against the front rim. It
bounded back again, brushed the hand-
kerchief caressingly, and finally toppled
gently into the netting for a goal. Al-
most on the instant, the final whistle
shrilled.

  The game was ended. The Bloss five
had won by a score of 10—9.

V.

  Judging by the expression on his
face, Vernon Judd was about as elated
over scoring the winning basket for the
Bloss team as a criminal in court would
be over receiving a stiff sentence.

“And that’s just what it amounts to,”
THE BASKET-BALL BOSS

he told himself, marching glumly off
the playing court. “My sentence is that
I be fired in disgrace from the fac-
tory, lose my six-month test to prove
my right to a desk with Judd & Co.,
and sacrifice whatever chance I had of
winning—her.”

  Somebody slapped him on the shoul-
der. He looked up irritably, only to
discover that it was his father.

  “Why, dad,” he greeted, “what in
the dickens are you doing out here?”
“In town on business,” explained
Freeman Judd cryptically. “I heard
there was a basket-ball game to-night,
and I figured I could find you here.
Quite a game, eh ?”

  Vern clenched his hands. “A bigger,
more important one than you think,
dad.” It was hard to go on and ex-
plain that his job at the factory hinged
upon the outcome, but he managed it
bravely.

  His father heard him to the end,
without interrupting. Once or twice he
frowned a little, as if there were some
worry on his mind, but he offered no
comment. When the boy was quite
done, he looked at him steadily.

  “You played to win?” he asked.

  “Of course. You see, I-”

  “All right. I wanted to be sure,
Vern. Now, about this job proposi-
tion of ours. You won’t stick out your
six months with Bloss, you say. Too
bad you came so close, my boy, but
you know I never budge an inch. A
bargain’s a bargain with me.”

  Looking up quickly, Vern fancied he
detected a twinkle in his father’s eyes.
But when he searched for it again it
was gone.

  “I’m not asking you to go back on
your proposition,” he said. “I don’t

know exactly-”

  “Vern!”

  It .was Hazel Wayne’s voice. He
whirled quickly, and took the hand she
extended.

  "I want to congratulate you, with all

C?A

97

my heart,” she said. “I’m glad you
won, Vern.”

  He was glad, too—now. It was the
first thrill of the victory, but it was
well worth while. Some day, he prom-
ised himself, he would make Hazel un-
derstand how much it had hurt him to
win against her wishes.

  “You don’t know how ashamed of
myself I felt!” she rushed on. “You
see, Creighton met me yesterday and
told me he was coming over to Lan-

don’s as superintendent and-”

  “Creighton! At Laixlon’s 1” ex-
claimed Vern in astonishment. A new
hope sprang up in his heart. “When?”
“Next Tuesday, he said.”

  “Oh!” The hope withered and died.
On the intervening Monday Creighton
would discharge him. “Go on, Hazel!”
“Well,” continued the girl, “he ex-
plained that as he had already signed
his contract and was the Landon man-
ager, he wanted the Landon people to
have the winning basket-ball team this
season. If you didn’t try too hard,
Vern, that would be possible, he
thought. I—I was to ask you not to.”
“But—why?”

  “Because if I refused—if Bloss won
—I was to lose my job. Father’s and
brother Ben’s depended upon the game,
too. Tuesday we’ll all be out of work.
I don’t know how we’ll manage to live,
but”—she smiled at him through her
tears—“but I’m glad you won, Vern.
It nearly killed me when I thought you
weren’t trying honestly to win.”

  “I was, Hazel. I know a lot of peo-
ple didn’t think so, but I was.” He
touched his arm gingerly. “Early in the
game I bruised the biceps in my right
arm in a nasty tumble. My whole arm
got sore and stiff. I wanted to drop out
and make way for a substitute, but
Murph wouldn’t listen. And then, at
the end, just before I scored that last
goal, tl'.e ball hit me an awful whack in
the face. It stunned me and blinded
me. But I heard you call, and I caught
98

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

a glimpse of your white handkerchief
dropping. I remembered that other day
—the first day I ever saw you—and I
knew absolutely I could shoot the bas-
ket. You really won the-”

  “Listen, Hazel Wayne!” The voice
ivas Creighton’s; his face was con-
vulsed with rage. “Listen to me, young
lady ! You double-crossed me to-night,
but you’ll pay for it. Out you go Tues-
day, along with your old man and your
kid brother—the whole kit and parcel
of you. And I’ll see to it that you
never get another job in this town.”
He turned to Vern. “As for you, you
young whippersnapper, I don’t have
to wait till Tuesday. You’re fired!
Understand? Fired! Just as soon as

I can swear out a warrant-”

  Freeman Judd stepped forward lei-
surely. “Just a moment,” he inter-
rupted. “You can’t fire this young
man.”

  “Why not? I’m superintendent of
the Bloss Company.”

  “Wrong!” The elder Judd spat out
the word with evident enjoyment. “You
zvere superintendent. But you can’t
fire anybody now because you were
fired yourself this afternoon at a meet-
ing of the board of directors.”

  “It’s a lie!” blustered Creighton. His
eyes gleamed slyly. “If it ain’t a lie,
though, I don’t care. I'll be super-
intendent of the Landon works next
week, and the Bloss Company will

find-”

 “Wrong again!” Freeman Judd
stepped closer. “At five this afternoon
the final papers were signed whereby
the two concerns come under the same
management and ownership. If it’s of
any interest to you, I am the man who
is merging them. I kicked you out of

Bloss’ to-day after reading the reports
of an expert accountant and a detec-
tive who’ve been checking you up for
several weeks; I'll make sure you stay
out of Landon’s. So, Mr. Creighton,
j'ou see, you won’t be able to fire any-
body from either factory.”

  Creighton did not wait to argue.
With a sudden leap, he lost himself in
the crowd that was making for the
outer door.

  “Shall I go after him, dad?” asked
Vern, his fingers working hungrily.

  “No need,” smiled Freeman Judd.
“He’ll run across some plain-clothes
men just outside. Misappropriation of
funds, malicious damage of property,
and other charges to answer in court.”
Somebody plucked at Vern’s coat
sleeve, and he looked down into Hazel’s
startled eyes.

  “Is he your father?” she asked, point-
ing.

 “Why, yes! Let me introduce-”

  “But lie’s just bought both factories,”
she said, “and he must be very rich,
and—and I thought you were poor,
Working in the Bloss stockroom. I sup-
pose now-”

  “If dad’s new superintendent is will-
ing, I’ll stick to my same job,” promised
Vern ; “at least, till I’ve been there a
full six months. How about it, dad?”
“Vern, I’m going to like you better.”
“Thanks, dad. A little later, if you
think I measure up, I want a desk job,
with more money.” He looked into
Hazel Wayne’s eyes once more. “Be-
cause, to tell the truth. I’m thinking
about getting married as sooii as the
girl says ‘yes.’ ”

  Hazel Wayne said “Oh!” But she
meant “Yes.”

a whoop in re-
to Clem’s pro-

     ^ HE scenario writer and
partner to Clem Frobisher
let out
sponse
posal:

  “Ed, let’s take a vaca-
tion. I’m getting tired of
making films. Let's go
back to San Pedro, hire the old boat,
and go fishing.”

  “Wow! Say, cap'n, I had that no-
tion myself! Do you mean it?’’

  “You bet I mean it!” Clem rose, and
strode up and down, frowning. “I can
be cooped up only so long, Ed; then
something has to bust. Now that we've
finished that big five-reel film. I'm go-
ing to get back to salt water for a few
days.”

  “Say, I can smell them fish now!”
exclaimed Ed, in ecstasy. "An’ the en-
gine-room oil an' the ol' bilge-water

stink- Oh, golly! When do we

go ?”

  “Catch a Pedro car, after lunch, char-
ter the old Sadie, and oft' with us! Are
you game?”

  “Game?” The lanky Iowan grinned.
“Say, cap’n, I'm so game that—that
I’m growin’ horns right now!”

  The Frobisher Producing Company,
with Clem as its head, and Ed Davis
as partner and scenario writer, had
been established in Easthamplon for

some months. Further, it had made
good, largely because of Clem Frobish-
er’s distinctive ability.

  Before getting into the motion-pic-
ture business, Clem had run a fishing
launch out of San Pedro, Ed being his
engineer and chum. He had finaily
awakened to the fact that, despite his
splendid body anti brawn, he was back-
ward in education; that ahead of him
lay nothing but endless years of fishing
and taking out tourists after tuna; and
that, if he so chose, he could make
something more of himself than this.

  Clem had chosen promptly, had sold
his launch to old Captain Saunders, and
had started in to make the fight. Ham-
pered financially, and by lack of prior
education, he had, none the less, flung
himself into the work with all his dog-
ged, pugnacious will power. Ed Davis
had accompanied him. largely for
friendship’s sake, but also with the
dream of getting rich by writing plays.

  Events had favored the chums. Ed
had been victimized by a fraudulent rno-
tion-picture concern, whereupon Clem
had pitched in and fought the owners;
the result had been that he and Ed
Davis owned the film company. Since
that time the chums had worked it up,
until now it was really a well-estab-
lished business, with a golden future.

  Naturally, therefore, they were both
100

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

ready for a vacation. Clem quite for-
got that a man, and particularly a young
man, can never entirely get away from
his past.

  In the old days, Clem had had a repu-
tation along the Pedro water front.

  Fie had never been a hanger-on at
bars, or a pool-room loafer; but nature,
combined with hard work at sea, had
endowed him with a vigorous body and
an inclination to use his fists. Along
the water front he had been thrown in
contact with fishermen, bucko mates,
and ordinary seamen of all nations, and
when it came to fighting, Clem Frobish-
er's name was one to conjure with.

  He had been whipped, of course. Yet
he was locally known as the toughest
young fellow to whip and the best fel-
low to stand beside in a scrap in all
San Pedro; and it must be admitted
that he did his best to justify the repu-
tation. Not that he ever sought a fight,
or forced one on the other chap, but
when the fight came to him he went into
it on the jump.

  Clem had thought these old days gone
forever; but, as he and Ed Davis
climbed aboard their San Pedro car that
afternoon Fate was waiting for them
with a big stick.

II.

  “If Cap’n Saunders ain’t here,” said
Ed Davis, “we’ll get another boat?”

  Clem nodded. Together they were
walking up a side street of San Pedro
to the little cottage where Captain Ezra
Saunders, a retired veteran of many
seas and seasons, was living on the in-
come furnished him by two or three
fishing boats, which were run by his
son Tom, a young fellow a year or two
older than Clem.

  As they turned in at the gate of the
vine-shaded cottage, however, they
knew that the captain was at home from
the foghorn voice which bellowed
forth:

  “Plowdy, Clem!”

  Ezra Saunders was a remarkable old
man—though he was scarce sixty years
of age. Fie was crippled by rheuma-
tism, and had lost a leg at the knee from
a shark'bite, while his right arm had
been paralyzed on his last voyage—
when he had brought the schooner
Mary Connors through a thousand miles
of typhoon and had saved the lives of
twenty men.

  With all this, however, Clem had
never seen the old man in gloomy mood.
Ever was Captain Saunders smiling, op-
timistic, cheerful. As he and Ed Davis
shook hands, and stepped tip to the
porch, where easy-chairs awaited them,
the skipper bellowed to his wife, and
Mrs. Saunders also came forth, to fold
each of the visitors in a warm embrace.

  “Well, well!” she exclaimed, wiping
a tear from her ruddy cheeks. “Clem,
if you ain’t become a real city man!
Say! Wouldn’t your mother ha’ been
proud of you now!”

  “I hope so,” and Clem’s brown eyes
saddened a trifle. Since his mother’s
death Mrs. Saunders had been the only
mother he had known—and that had
been twelve summers past. Then he
looked up, with his old cheerful smile.
“I do believe you’re getting thin!”

  “Nonsense, you vagabone!” Mrs.
Saunders, who weighed two hundred,
and knew it, laughed through her wel-
coming tears. “Don’t you flatter me,
now! You boys ain’t goin’ to run right
off, I hope? I been makin’ pies to-day,
and it seems to me you two rapscallions
used to like Ma Saunders’ pies right
well before you got stuck up an’ citi-
fied.”

  “Nothin’ stuck up about me, ’cept
my collar,” said Ed Davis, grinning.
“I been hankering for your pies, ma,
ever since we left Pedro. You bet we're
goin’ to stay a while! How’s Tom?
Everybody well?”

  Mrs. Saunders’ ruddy face seemed to
assume a slightly less cheerful expres-
sion.
CLEM FROBISHER’S MAN-SIZED JOB

101

  “Yes,” she said, turning to the door.
“Tom’s well. You folks set and talk
while I see to them pies. They're in
the oven now.”

  The door slammed. Clem looked at
the captain’s white-whiskered face and
frowned.

  ■‘What's the matter, cap'n?" he asked
directly. “You're looking kind of
peaked around the gills. Rheumatism
bad again?”

 “No-o, I reckon not.” Captain
Saunders stroked his beard, and sum-
moned up the ghost of his olden-days
smile. “I’m hungerin’ for salt water,
I reckon.”

  “First time I ever knew you to lie to
me, cap'n,” said Clem quietly.

  Captain Saunders flushed. He looked
at Ed Davis, and then met Clem’s accus-
ing brown eyes. With fumbling lingers
he began to fill his pipe.

  "Got a match, Clem?” he asked, with
a little quaver in his voice.

  Silently Clem produced the article in
question. It began to seem as though
something were very wrong, indeed.
Ed Davis sat watching and listening, his
grin gone. When the old skipper had
lighted the pipe he leaned back and
looked at Clem again.

  “Well, Clem, I—I guess it was the
first time. I ain't much used to lies.
But sometimes lies has to come.”

  “Not between us, cap’n,” and Clem's
strong, bronzed face lightened. “What’s
the trouble?”

  “You,” said the old man, puffing out
a huge cloud of smoke.

  “I! What do you mean?”

 Captain Saunders sighed. His
weather-beaten face was set in lines of
sadness.

  “Clem, you alius been a mighty good
boy, and I know it better’n most people.
But when it comes to a scrap, you got
a reputation around here like a down-
east mate. I don’t blame you none, o’
course.”

  “Go on,” urged Clem as the skipper

paused. He wondered what was com-
ing next.

  "Well, Tom alius did admire you a
heap, Clem, but since you been gone to
the city Tom's kind o' got the notion
that he’s stepped into your fightin’
boots, and he’s gone around handin’ out
some line lickin’s. For a fact, Tom can
fight like a streak.”

  "1 guess he came by it honestly,” was
the reply, and Clem smiled slightly as
he eyed the old skipper’s broad shoul-
ders.

  “Well, mebbe so. But—sav, Clem,
you know Tom’s a good boy, don't
you?”

  “You bet he is!” said Clem, frown-
ing.

  Inwardly, he commented otherwise.
While he knew Tom Saunders pretty
well, he also knew that Tom had com-
panions who were not of the old Saun-
ders strain.

  "To tell the truth, Clem, Tom’s been
gettin' kind o’ out o' hand.” The skip-
per sighed again. "He’s been cornin’
home drunk every once in a while, if
you want it straight. He’s try in’ to be
cock o’ the walk around here, like you
used to be—but he ain’t doing it your
way, Clem.”

  Clem Frobisher felt as though a cold
hand had touched him and had sent a
shiver through him.

  He was not responsible, of course;
and, very likely, Tom Saunders was no
worse than the average young fellow.
But that was far from the point.

  Clem loved the honest, simple, manly
old skipper, and he loved Mrs. Saun-
ders. Sooner than hurt them in any
way he would have cut off his right
hand.

  Yet he knew that he had hurt them
grievously, if unintentionally. He knew
that Tom Saunders, misled by the
wrong sort of friends, was heaping sor-
rows upon these kindly old parents of
his largely by aspiring to walk in the
tracks of Clem Frobisher. And Ezra
102

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

Saunders had hit the nail on the head
by saying that Tom was not doing it
Clem's way.

  “He’s running the boats all right, I
suppose?” queried Clem, with sinking
heart.

  “Oh, he ’tends to ’em well enough—
nothin’ extra. Clem, I wish to thunder
these was the ol' days! I’d ship that
boy A. B. under the toughest, hardest
pair o’ bucko mates ever stepped, an’
I'd ship him around the Horn! When
he got back, by glory, he'd either be
dead or—or different! And'’—the skip-
per sighed heavily—“I dunno's I’d give
a durn which way it come out. I b’lieve
it’s breakin’ Ma Saunders’ heart—I do
so!”

  Suddenly Ed Davis leaned forward,
his lean frame quivering with eager-
ness. For five minutes he spoke rap-
idly, excitedly, earnestly. Clem and the
skipper listened in amazement, that
changed, on Clem’s part, to narrow-
eyed calculation, and finally to swift re-
solve.

  “That’s enough!” he broke in sud-
denly. “Cap’n, we’ll go out on a fishin’
trip in the old Sadie, after supper to-
night. If Tom ain’t—hasn’t—come
home, I'll find him. And I promise you
this, on my word of honor: If I don’t
change his lookout on life I’ll never
show my face here again!”

  The old skipper gazed at Clem with
dewy eyes.

  “Clem,” he said brokenly, “Clem,
mebbe ye can. But, lad, it's a man-sized
job! I reckon you’ve bit off more’n ye
can chew—but Heaven bless ye, lad!”

  “And now for ma’s pies!” said Ed
Davis, with a grin.

III.

  Clem Frobisher and his chum waved
farewell to the old folks and walked
toward Beacon Street. The California
evening was just closing down in all its
swiftness.

  “Ed, you go ’tend to the boat,” di-
rected Clem, at the next corner. “Have
her gas tank full, and make sure the
batteries are working right. I’ll bring
Tom.”

  “Mebbe I'd better go along with
you,” volunteered Ed.

  “Maybe you’d better obey orders!”
snapped Clem, his square-hewn face set
in hard, determined lines. Here ! Take
my coat with you !”

  Peeling to his flannel shirt, he tossed
his coat to Ed and turned away. The
other looked after him with a sour grin.

  “Want all the fun yourself, eh? All
right, cap'n. You ain’t goin’ to shake
me !”

  Ed Davis followed his partner—at a
very respectful distance.

  Clem strode along in the gathering
dusk. Crossing Beacon Street, he
headed for a large pool room, where he
was pretty certain to find his quarry.

  “So he didn’t come home for supper
—hasn't come home all day!” he mut-
tered savagely. “Huh! Claims to be
walking in my shoes, does he? Huh!”

  Clem turned in at the pool-room en-
trance, where a noisy phonograph was
grinding out ragtime. About the rear
of the place he saw a dozen young fel-
lows grouped about a pool table, with a
cloud of tobacco smoke hanging over
them. With a curt nod to the proprie-
tor, Clem strode back past the tables.

  He soon picked out Tom Saunders, a
big-boned, rathar handsome fellow,
three inches taller than Clem, and built
along the same lines as the old skipper.
But Toni’s strong, even powerful, face
was marred by the undeniable touch of
liquor, and a cigarette trailed smoke be-
tween his fingers. His companions
laughed uproariously at his jokes, and
gave him an acclamation, which he
seemed to enjoy hugely.

  “Clem Frobisher, by golly!”

  As the cry went up from the assem-
bled fellows, all of whom knew Clem,
Tom Saunders turned and came for-
CLEM FROBISHER’S MAN-SIZED JOB

103

ward, cue in hand, with a quick smile
of delight. He stretched out a big hand
toward Clem.

  ‘‘Hello, cap'n! Say, you old chump,

where you been hidin’ ? I-”

  Under Clem’s steady, scornful gaze,
his words of greeting faded. His hand
fell to his side. He stared in blank
amazement, while a portentous silence
fell upon the others.

  Then Clem made a sudden movement
and plucked the cigarette from Tom's
fingers. He tossed it into the corner.

  “Tom,” he said quietly, “I hear that
you claim to be filling my shoes. How
about it?”

  “Hey?” Tom Saunders laid aside
his billiard cue, still staring. “What
you mean?”

 “You heard me!” snarled Clem,
watching the other with grim intent-
ness.

  “Say, what’s eatin’ you?’’ demanded
Tom, in frowning wonder. “Ain’t we
alius been mighty good friends? What
the devil are you talkin’ about?”

  “I’m talking about you,’’ said Clem,
as he took a forward step. "Tom, you
used to be a prince of a fellow. You’re
some scrapping guy, too. Well, I been
hearing a lot about you to-day. I hear,
for one thing, that you're doing a lot o’
talking about fillin’ Clem Frobisher’s
shoes. I’m telling you right here that
my shoes never left tracks in a saloon!
Get that?”

  “Say, what’s the matter with you?”
said Tom, with a scowl, seeing beyond
all doubt that his former hero was bent
on trouble. “Do you want to start
somethin’ ?”

  “When I get ready, I’ll start it quick
enough,” snapped Clem. “Ed Davis
came over with me, and we’re going out
in the Sadie to-night, Tom, on a three-
days’ trip—maybe longer. I want you
to come along.”

  Tom was puzzled by this invitation,
and was also half mollified.

  “Why, Clem, I’d like to—darned if

I wouldn't! But we got a big kelly
game coinin’ oil to-night—dollar a cor-
ner-”

  “And your dad’s house rent is ow-
ing,” said Clem quietly. “Will you
come or not?”

  “Don’t see how I can-”

  Like a flash, Clem’s right shot out.

It drove fair and square to the big fel-
low’s jaw. Tom went staggering back,
and his friends surged forward at Clem
with a snarl of rage. Gripping the pool
table behind him, Tom Saunders turned
on them hotly.

  “Git back, you flatfoots! Keep out o’
this!”

  “Bully for you, Tom!” said Clem ap- •
provingly. Then, as Tom turned, Clem
was in, with a leap, and the row began.

  And, as a water-front row, it was
historic. Tom Saunders was 110 bluffer.
He had size and brawn, he took punish-
ment like a punching bag, and he had a
kick like a mule. When he started in
to fight he usually demolished every-
thing in sight.

  But from the start it was evident that
he had no chance.

  Clem Frobisher in action was a whirl-
wind. If he lacked size, he had a sav-
age earnestness which won half his bat-
tles. He went into a scrap heart and
soul and body, for, if he had to fight, he
wanted no halfway measures. He was
not a halfway man.

  The battle was short, sharp, and furi-
ous. Foolishly, Tom drove for Clem’s
face and jaw, but Clem fought other-
wise. He was out for blood, figuratively
speaking.

  Taking a smack that brought a
black eye, without a wince, he broke
through the other's guard and slammed
his fists into Tom’s body time and again.
Never had any one seen him go into a
fight with such savage, deadly fury.
Within thirty seconds, Tom Saunders
was backed into a corner, mouthing
oaths and lashing out half at random,
while Clem’s terrible right and left
104

swings pounded over his heart and
stomach.

  Unexpectedly, Clem shot up a swift
uppercut that rocked Tom’s head back.
The other’s arms flew up, and Clem’s
right bored into the solar plexus. It
was almost a finishing blow. Tom emit-
ted a gasp, and flung out his arms to
save himself from going down. Clem
swung down his arm for the knock-
out.

  At that instant, the rage of Tom’s
followers broke all bounds. One of
them came in, swinging a billiard cue,
and aimed a blow that would have re-
sulted in the penitentiary had it landed.
But it did not land.

  As the cue flashed up behind Clem, a
lean figure came from nowhere, appar-
ently, and placed a blow under the fel-
low’s ear that landed the would-be mur-
derer under a table and kept him there.
Then Clem heard his chum’s voice ring-
ing behind him:

  “You fellers better scatter quick!
There’s two cops headed this way!”
Clem's arm shot out. Tom Saunders
groaned and collapsed. The others
were hastily streaming out the back en-
trance; and Clem, gripping his late op-
ponent's collar, turned to Ed Davis with
a panting gasp of relief.

  “Good boy, Ed! Pick up his feet,
now—move fast!”

  And, as the police entered by the
front door, they vanished into the alley
at the rear, carrying the unconscious
Tom Saunders between them.

IV.

  “Shanghaied him, by thunder!”

  Ed Davis grinned down at the sleep-
ing Tom. The Sadie was dancing to
the lilting ground swells, at dawn, far
out beyond Catalina Island.

  “Below there!” rang the voice of
Clem, on deck above. “Ed, rouse that
fellow up, or I'll do it myself!”

Ed, who was about to turn in, after

standing watch all night, shrugged his
shoulders and grinned. Then he caught
the sleeping Tom Saunders by the leg,
hauled him roughly out of the bunk,
and, planting two stinging blows, sent
him up the tiny companionway with a
kick.

  Furious, half awake, cursing, Saun-
ders gained his balance on the deck and
stared at the ocean in blank bewilder-
ment. Clem, at the wheel, let out a
roar.

  “Wake up, you slob! Take one o’
them buckets and a broom, an’ wash
down the decks!”

  Tom stared at the pilot house, saw
Clem's battered features, and compre-
hended at last. His heavy face con-
tracted in anger.

  “By thunder, I’ll make you sweat for
this!” he burst forth, and came on the
run.

  Clem slipped a loop over the wheel
and met Tom halfway. Nor did he
waste any time or sympathy, for he was
a captain, and his crew was in mutiny.
Before Tom could get within fighting
distance, Clem smashed him across the
head with the butt end of a gaff. He
reeled back, caught at the rail, and
clung there weakly.

  “I’ve a word to say to you, Tom
Saunders,” remarked Clem quietly,
watching him for signs of further trou-
ble. “You think you’re something of
a boss scrapper, and a deuce of a sporty
chap. You’re not. You’re a cheap,
low-down drunken loafer!

  “You keep away from your old father
and mother as much as you can, and
you loaf around the water front, gam-
bling and fighting and drinking. Well,
you’re going to get your fill o’ fighting
this trip, believe me! You’re going to
realize that you got a blamed sight bet-
ter home than any pool room will fur-
nish-”

  Tom, partly recovered from that
stunning blow, leaped in again.

  Clem raised the gaff, then dropped it.
CLEM FROBISHER’S MAN-SIZED JOB

105

He saw that Tom was a glutton for
punishment, and determined to admin-
ister it. Yet he admired deeply the dog-
ged courage of the other.

  Cool, confident, smiling, for a good
ten minutes he smashed Tom Saunders
about the deck. At the end of that time
Tom collapsed, both eyes puffing, and
his face hammered black and blue.
Clem caught up a canvas bucket, trailed
it over the side, and sluiced Tom with
cold salt water until Tom sat up, gasp-
ing and half drowned.

  “If you've had enough, get busy and
clean them decks!” snapped Clem.

  Tom had not had enough, as his
curses showed, but he set to work clean-
ing the decks. During breakfast, he
eyed Clem in sullen silence, and after
breakfast Clem set him to work clean-
ing out the fish boxes and untangling
lines and leaders.

  Shortly afterward, Clem caught sight
of a flock of gulls far to the south, and
headed the Sadie for them. Where the
gulls were there were yellowtail, and
skipjack also. Calling Tom, he put him
to work at the outriggers.

  These were long ten-foot poles, set
into sockets just abaft the pilot house,
and projecting over the rails. From
each pole were set out three hundred-
yard lines, the outermost of which bore
automatic strikers, the others bearing
hooks and minnows.

  Five minutes later they got the first
strike, and then the fun waxed fast and
furious. Clem let out a yell for Ed
Davis, and they began to haul in fifteen
and twenty-pound yellowtail as fast as
the trolling lines could be drawn taut.
As Clem and Tom hauled in the fight-
ing, darting, leaping fish, Ed gaffed
them.

  By noon they had over twenty, with
a few barracuda and skipjacks. Then
Clem hauled about for San Clemente,
looped the wheel, and settled down with
the others to lunch.

  “When you get the dishes washed

up, Tom,” said Ed Davis, “you'd better
clean one of them barracuda for supper.
Then give that cabin a good cleaning

and then-”

  “Say, you fellers are almighty
fresh!” said Tom Saunders, feeling his
black-and-blue eyes tenderly. "How
long is this thing goin’ to last?”

  "Until we get ready to quit,” said
Davis, grinning pleasantly. “Your
proud spirit needs a whole lot o’ chas-
tening, friend Tom.”

  “W ell, what’s the idea? What have
I ever done to you guys?”

  “Nothing,” broke in Clem coldly.
“But you're becoming a pretty worth-
less sort of citizen, Tom. If I had a
father and mother like yours. I'd try
and make something of myself, instead

of hanging around-”

  “Yes, you’re a beaut!” sneered Tom.
“ ’Cause you're a city guy, now, you're
all stuck up, hey?”

  “I don't think you quite under-
stand.” Clem smiled slightly. “You’re
out of proportion with the real facts
of life, Tom. Your outlook is warped.
Instead of seeing things as they are,
you see them from the viewpoint of
your pool-room and saloon friends.
Well, when we get back to Pedro you’ll
have forgotten all your dreams of be-
ing a tough fighter and gambler and
drinker. You're really such a splendid

chap at bottom, Tom-”

  With a snarl of fury, Tom Saunders
leaped to his feet. Unobserved, he had
worked himself into position by the rack
holding the fish gaffs. With the rapid-
ity of lightning, he seized one of the
ten-foot poles and made a vicious lunge
for Clem.

  Clem ducked. The curved, sharp,
unbarbed steel missed his shoulder by
a hair’s breadth and tore through his
flannel shirt. It would have gone
through his flesh quite as easily.

  Before Tom could extricate the
weapon Ed Davis was on him in one
leap.
106

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

  Let it be understood that it was con-
trary to the natures both of Davis and
of Clem Frobisher to treat any one with
the brutality which they were display-
ing toward Tom Saunders. Yet it was
not brutality. They were both thinking,
not of Tom, but of the two old people
in the vine-wreathed cottage.

  Ed had mapped out a course, Clem
had approved it, as had Captain Ezra
Saunders, and now the two partners
were following it rigidly. If it turned
out badly, Tom would get no more than
he deserved; if it turned out well, so
much the better.

  Blinded though he was, however,
Tom gave the lanky Iowan the light of
his life. It was full seven minutes before
Ed had his opponent on the deck, and
even then Tom still lashed out blindly
at the figure sitting on his chest. Not
until Clem doused him anew with
bucket after bucket of water did he
give in.

  “All right,” he mumbled, rising un-
steadily. “All right! You guys wait
till I can see, that’s all!”

  “There’s no waiting aboard this
hooker!” snapped Clem. “You get for-
’ard and clean that fish, and do it right,
see?”

  “I’ll do nothin’ o’ the .sort!” returned
Tom through his split lips. “You can
beat me up all you want—I ain’t goin’
to stir a foot.” A volley of oaths es-
caped him.

  Clem, his lips tight clenched, in-
spected him for a moment, then turned
to Ed.

  “Get that bit of line out o’ the locker
aft, Ed—the rope’s end that’s tarred.
Go after this guy, and give him a taste
of deep-sea sailors’ life.”

  For the rest of the afternoon Tom
Saunders worked like a horse. A bit
of thin rope, tarred into a stiff club, is
a wonderfully effective inducement,
when properly applied. Poor Tom
made close acquaintance with it.

  “We’ll be off San Clemente at dawn,
Ed,” said Clem that evening. He and
Ed Davis were eating fried barracuda
while Tom conned the helm. “It’ll be
watch and watch all night, and we’ll
have to keep him awake and working
till he drops.”

  “Haze him, eh?”

  “Haze him until he’s darned near
dead!” And Clem compressed his lips.
“Ed, it's an awful thing to do—but by
golly it’s a whole lot more awful to
think o' him breakin’ poor old Ma Saun-
ders’ heart!”

  “We’ll break him!'’ said Ed, nodding
as he spoke. “We’ll kill or cure, Clem
—and I ain’t right sure which it'll be.”

  Neither was Clem, unfortunately.

V.

  Dawn came upon the sea—and fog.

  The Sadie was somewhere off San
Clemente, that desolate, rocky, almost
unknown island. The dense fog hid
everything from view.

  Clem, who would be on duty until
eight o'clock, was seated beside the pilot
house, cutting off yellowtail heads to
use as bait for jewfish. The Sadie lay
motionless on the oily waters, swinging
listlessly to the swell of the channel.
Up in the bows was a huddled, miser-
able figure—Tom Saunders, asleep at
last.

  That had been a terrible night for the
shanghaied man.

  Kept awake and at work, kept scrub-
bing, painting, untangling lines, oiling
the engines, driven to the work and kept
at it by boot and fist and rope’s end,
Tom had finally given way.

  When Clem took the deck, at four
o’clock, the sight of Tom smote his
heart. Yet he drove him relentlessly.
An hour later the end had come.

  Sobbing, praying, pleading, Tom had
crept to him, begging for sleep, begging
for release from the torture. Even
then Clem had steeled himself, and
CLEM FROBISHER’S MAN-SIZED JOB

107

had renewed his driving, but not for
long. He had not the heart.

  Tom Saunders had been broken at
last--—had promised everything and any-
thing, had wept and prayed anew. At
six o’clock, Clem had told him to sleep,
and he had dropped in a pitiable heap
where he stood.

  “It’s a mean job,” thought Clem, as
he baited the huge hooks on his line.
“But he’s had an hour’s rest now, so
we’ll try him out. Besides, he can
stand a lot more—and it’s necessary.
Kill or cure!”

  Accordingly, he awakened poor Torn
by repeated sluices of water, thrust a
rod into his hand, bade him angle for a
jewfish, and baited his own line. Some-
what to Clem’s surprise, Tom said noth-
ing whatever, and did not rebel; but he
sat on the rail, shivering, and gazed
miserably at the water.

  A moment later, just as Clem was
unreeling his line, he saw Tom start
to his feet, and heard the buzz of the
automatic drag.

  “Got one?” he cried. Tom merely
nodded.

  A glance showed Clem that the jew-
fish was running out ahead of the
launch, and he leaped to the engines.

  “I’ll give her half speed!” he ex-
claimed swiftly. “Reel up as we get
over him.”

  He noted that the fog seemed to have
thickened rather than diminished.

  With the Sadie running slowly ahead,
Clem regained the deck to find Tom
reeling in his line, the stubby, powerful
rod bent almost double. The jewfish,
for all its great size, is not a wonderful
fighter; none the less, it was a good ten
minutes before Tom got the fish close to
the surface.

  Yet he seemed not a whit excited.
He reeled mechanically; his hands were
blue with cold; he seemed broken in
spirit. Clem watched him with some
anxiety, wondering if the hazing had
been carried too far.

  “Here!” he exclaimed suddenly, as
the line came in. “Take this gaff, and
bring him up, Tom! I’ll hold him at
the surface!”

  Clem thought he saw tears on the
other’s cheeks.

  The exchange was made. Tom took
the gaff and stood on the rail, clinging
to a stay, bending over the water. Clem,
taking the rod, was astonished. The
fish must be a four-hundred-pounder at
least, he decided. Then, peering over
the side as he forced the jewfish up, he
saw the great oval mass below. The
surface water broke into a mass of
foam.

  Tom lunged with the gaff—lunged
again—missed both times. Then, with
a muttered word of exasperation, he
leaned far over and caught the fish
squarely.

  He did not lift quickly enough, how-
ever, to get the fish out of water. There
was a surge and a swirl beneath, and a
short cry broke from Tom.

 “Give me a hand-”

  Before Clem could move, he saw
Tom, hanging grimly to the gaff, drawn
out by the fish's wide, circling sweep.
In a flash, the dogged San Pedro boy
had his hold broken, had lost his bal-
ance—and was overboard.

  “By golly, he’s too cold and stiff to
swim !” thought Clem swiftly. He lifted
his voice in a ringing shout:

 “Ed! Ed! On deck! Man over-
board !”

  With the words, he caught up the
life preserver hanging at the rail and
tossed it over the side. Then, his coat
off, he leaped after it, in wild fear lest
his own driving tyranny had been car-
ried so far that Tom would have no
strength left.

  In that desperate fear, he came to the
surface almost beside the struggling fig-
ure of Tom Saunders. A few yards
away was floating the round life buoy.
Catching Tom by the collar, Clem
108

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

gained the preserver in a few strokes,
and bobbed Tom up inside it.

  ‘‘Get your arms over the sides—that’s
right! Now take a turn of the line
about your arms. Good!”

  Satisfied that Tom was sure to float,
Clem turned on his side and sent a
glance around for the Sadie. With a
shock, he remembered that her engines
were set at half speed.

  She was gone in the fog!

  Stilling the momentary panic that
seized him, Clem lifted his voice in a
shout. He knew that Ed Davis would
be on deck by this time, but at sight
of the swirls of fog, that hid the water
ten feet away, his heart sank.

  “How you makiu’ it, Tom?”

  “All right,” said the other mechani-
cally. “I lost the fish, I guess.”

  “I guess you did.” Clem chuckled.
“Can you give a yell ?”

  Tom emitted a feeble cry, that be-
trayed his weakness more than words
could have done. A wave broke over
them, and Clem took his weight off the
preserver, allowing it to float higher.
It could not well sustain them both.

  Also, there was a choppy sea run-
ning—the island current cutting up the
long, easy ground swell. It was hard
swimming, and the water was cold.

  “What on earth’s the matter with
Ed?” exclaimed Clem anxiously. “We

ought to hear the horn- Ah ! There

it is! Thank goodness!”

  Muffled, but unmistakable, the blast
of the Sadie’s foghorn pierced its way
to them. Clem shouted again and
again. Ed was on the job!

  “It don’t seem to be gettin’ much
closer,” muttered Tom.

  Clem listened. No—it was not grow-
ing closer. It was hard to tel! from
which direction the sound came, but
certainly the launch was receding from
them. Resting once more on the life
preserver, Clem bellowed for all he was
worth.

  “Better quit yellin’,” mumbled Tom.
“It’ll lire you out quicker’n any-”

  The rest was lost in a splutter as a
wave lapped over them. Clem again re-
leased the life buoy, which lifted Tom
well above the water.

  Ridding himself of his clothes, Clem
swam more easily, but he felt the chill
of the water keenly. Owing to the
choppy back lash of the waves, it was
impossible to float. He had to swim
continually to hold himself up.

  “Hang on to the cork, ye blamed
fool!” said Tom.

  “I will, if I need to. I’m all right.”

  The horn was sounding no longer!

  Clem knew that their situation was
desperate in the extreme. Which way
the island lay, no one could tell. They
were in a spot reached only by an oc-
casional fishing boat. The fog would
not lift before noon. Unless Ed Davis
found them by chance, they could not
both last—the preserver would only
keep one man up.

  Clem found himself becoming weak-
ened by that continual struggle.

  How long he swam beside Tom, he
never knew. It seemed like days. He
swam now on his side, now on his back.
Change position as he might, however,
he could not get away from the choppy,
short seas. The sound of the foghorn
came to them no more, and Clem for-
bore to shout, knowing the effort use-
less unless Ed Davis came close by
them.

  “How are you, Tom?” he said, rest-
ing on the preserver. A wave broke
over them. Clem hastily drew away,
yet with an inward groan.

  “All right,” responded Tom, lying
nobly. “Catch on here."

  Clem smiled a little. The faintness
of the other’s voice had told him all
he wanted to know. Tom was incapable
of any exertion.

  “And I m responsible for Tom’s con-
dition,” was the thought that drove into
Clem's heart with paralyzing truth. He

«
CLEM FROBISHER’S MAN-SIZED JOB 109

called up his reserve strength and
breasted the waves, but the effort
wasted him alarmingly. His limbs were
stiff, numbed. He prayed for the Sa-
die, but she came not.

  “Tom,” said Clem, as he turned,
swimming beside the buoy and watch-
ing Tom’s white, stern-clenched face,
"we've hazed you pretty hard this trip,
but it was for your own good. Ed and

I came to Pedro, and found-” A

wave plunged over him. Clem fought
it down, gasping.

  “We found your dad ten years older
than he was a month or two ago. Ma
didn’t say much, but she was pretty
hard hit—and it was your fault, Tom.
You’ve been running with the wrong
crowd, and because you’re a good deal
above them in every way they’ve toad-
ied to you and got you on the down

grade to their level. Ed and I-”

  Again a great quantity of green wa-
ter curled over him. The crest swal-
lowed him. Desperate, Clem lost his
head, and flurried wildly, frantically,
wasting precious strength. When he
emerged, half strangled, his own dan-
ger frightened him into coolness.

  “Grab hold o’ the buoy, you fool!”
growled Tom weakly.

  “Shut up!” gasped Clem. “Listen!
I want you to understand why we acted
as we did, Tom. Your drinking and
loafing and general cussedness has

darned near wrecked your-”

 Once more a smother of water
dragged him down. Ide fought against
the wild impulse to grab the buoy, but
he struggled up to find Tom’s hand on
his arm.

  “Git aboard here-”

  “Quit!” snarled Clem, flinging back
and breaking the other’s hold. He
gazed at Tom with desperate, convulsed
features. Fie knew he could not last
long. His strength was going fast.
“We can't, both hang on there, you
idiot! It—it won’t hold—more’n one
—and-”

  “Then I’ll drop!” And Tom tried to
heave himself up and release the lash-
ing about his arms. Fie failed, through
very stiffness and weakness.

  “No, you won’t—you go back home

and—tell ma that—that-” Clem

went under, fought frantically, felt the
terrible weakness overpower him. Then
he caught a breath of blessed air again.

“So long—cut out—the booze-”

 With a groan, Clem found his
strength gone. He seemed to collapse
utterly. Fie felt the water close over
him, choking, strangling, smothering—
and then he knew nothing more.

  A moment afterward the Sadie poked
her nose out of the fog, almost above
Tom.

VI.

  “Golly! I thought I was gone-”

  Clem opened his eyes and stared.

  He found himself in the cabin of the
Sadie. Above him was standing Ed
Davis; and Clem, feeling himself almost
naked, knew that his chum had been
working over him.

  “You were blamed near gone!” ex-
claimed Ed anxiously. “1 got the wa-
ter out of you, though. How do you
feel ?”

  “Tired. Where’s Tom?”

  “Up above. He’s all right—kind o’
went to pieces when I got you aboard.”
Ed heaped blankets about Clem.
Then he continued swiftly:

  “I got some coffee on the fire now.
Sav! Do you know what that cuss
done?”

 “Who—Tom ?”

  “Yep! I found him hangin’ on to
your collar—both o’ you danged near
drowned, by thunder! Fie made me
haul you up first, too! Say, what hap-
pened? I ain’t understood yet how you

come overboard-”

  “Get the coffee,” muttered Clem, clos-
ing his eyes. “Talk later.”
110

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

  With a mutter of self-accusation, Ed
rushed away.

  Clem lay in a coma of exhaustion.
He felt a gradual warmth steal through
him, and realized that he was safe
enough; but he was too weary to move.
A moment later he caught a step at his
side, and opened his eyes, thinking that
Ed had returned.

  Instead, however, he saw Tom Saun-
ders. The big fellow, staring at Clem
with wild eyes, lowered himself to the
edge of the bunk. He was white and
shaken. As he met the gaze of Clem
he broke down, and lowered his face
in his arms, sobbing unrestrainedly.

  Clem wondered, but was too weak to
speak for the moment. At length Tom
lifted his head.

  “Thank Heaven, you’re safe!” he

mumbled. “Say, Clem. I-”

  “Thanks, old man," broke in Clem,
putting out a hand. “Ed told me how

you held me up—it was fine work-”

  “Oh. shut your blamed mouth!”
growled'Tom, sitting up. “I got some-
thin’ to say—you shut up till I get
through!”

  Clem watched him, waiting in puz-
zled silence.

  “You know what you said when—
when you was goin’ down ?’’ blurted out
Tom. “About ma and dad—and what

  “I know,” said Clem. “Well ?”
  Tom’s white face flushed slightly.

  “Clem, it’s darned hard to explain—
but just then, when you went down, an’

I seen how you was givin’ up so’s I
could go back—it kind o’ made me real-
ize that you’d meant every darned word
o’ what you said. I hadn’t thought of
it that way before—but it came to me
all of a heap—well, I can't say any
more, Clem—only I want to tell you

that I’ve been a darned fool, and-”

  “Say, you two guys better drink this
coffee in a hurry,” broke in the voice
of Ed Davis, who had paused for a mo-
ment behind Tom, listening.

  He came forward with two steaming
cups of coffee, handed one to Tom, and
helped Clem to put down the hot fluid
in the other. Willi a sigh of increasing
comfort, Clem fell back in the bunk and
smiled faintly, his hand touching that of
Tom.

  “Ed,” he said, “head the old hooker
for Pedro, full speed! When we get

in to-night-”

  “When we get in to-night,” broke in
Ed. with a wide grin, “do you know
what I'm goin’ to do?”

  “What?” asked Clem, with a smile.
“I'm goin’ to eat one o’ Ma Saunders’'
pies—all by myself.”

“And I’ll be there to help,” said Tom.
In his handgrip and in his eyes there
was that which told Clem more than
words could say. Tom Saunders was
headed home.

ENTOMBED MINERS RESCUED

THE nine miners who had been entombed for a week in the Foster Tunnel
of the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, at Coaldale, Pennsylvania,
were taken out alive. Though the men had crouched in water most of
the time, and had subsisted partly on wax, they were able to walk to the
ambulance.

    Eleven miners were entombed when water and culm broke into the tunnel.
Two who were nearer the mouth of the tunnel were saved after a few hours.
Gangs, working in relays of four hours, dug through the fallen coal and rock
in order to make an opening through which the other nine could be rescued.

HEN “Rube-’ Reynolds
crawled out of bed and
began to dress, it was
near to noontime. Within
his head, to all feeling, a
gigantic, throbbing trip
hammer was seemingly
striving to pound its way
through his skull with regular, painful
thumps. His lips felt parched and
drawn, and a sickish, bitter taste stayed
upon his tongue, as if his mouth was
crammed with coarse, moldy earth, and
by no means of futile gulping could he
swallow the stuff.

  Out of the confused muddle of his
brain flashed a thought of morning
practice.

  “Guess’ll have to skip breakfast to
get out to the field on time,” he thought.

  But a glance at his watch, lying upon
the bureau, made him aware that haste
was useless; for probably at that mo-
ment his fellow members of the Sox
were leaving the ball park for their
homes and boarding places. Again he
had missed a morning session on the
home grounds of the Sox, and he sul-
lenly wondered what Manager Kineally
would say.

  Slowly he continued to don his
clothes. At times the bed, the chairs,
and other articles of furniture seemed
to be dancing and whirling weirdly
about the room; and when he leaned
forward to lace his shoes, his throbbing
head pained as though it would burst.

  Moving to the bureau he pulled out
a lower drawer and brought forth a

bottle partially filled with a brownish
liquid. To his lips he tipped it, and
for several seconds his Adam’s apple
bobbed convulsively to a gurgling ac-
companiment.

  Barely at the halfway mark, between
twenty and thirty years, Reynolds had
already reached the stage Where a
morning drink seemed a necessity. He
lowered the bottle, its contents emptied
by half, to the bureau top; and an arti-
ficial sense of buoyancy pervaded his
being. The throbbing pain in his head
was deadened to a dull ache, and the
burning flavor of the liquor upon his
tongue had washed away the moldy
taste.

  He dully pondered as to what had
taken place on the previous evening,
but his remembrances of events occur-
ring after eleven o’clock or thereabouts
on the night before were decidedly lim-
ited. Some one had escorted him to the
front door of his lodging house; he had
dizzily ascended the stairs and managed
to open the door of his room—that was
all he could recall.

  A gentle tapping on the door broke
in upon his thoughts.

  “What is it?” he grunted.

  “Mr. Kineally wishes to see you,”
was the reply. The voice belonged to
his landlady.

  Reynolds hesitated momentarily. He
was tempted to have the landlady say
that he was not at home. But what
was the use! Kineally would “bawl
him out” later; so why not have it over
with!
112

  “All right! Send him up!” Reynolds
answered.

  He had hardly time to whisk the bot-
tle from the bureau to its place in the
drawer when an imperative rapping
threatened the door panel.

  “Come in !” he called.

  As the door swung inward a big,
brawny form filled the doorway, almost
from casing to casing. The square-
jawed visage of Owen Kineally, with
its twinkling eyes and smiling lips, had
appeared on sporting pages the country
over; but now the smile was missing.
His eyebrows were puckered forward,
as Reynolds had sometimes seen them
when Kineally took a parting shot at a
nearsighted, obstinate umpire.

  The big manager remained standing,
his gaze upon the ball player.

  “G’ morning!” Reynolds greeted, as
he continued the knotting of his scarf.

  “Good afternoon!” retorted the man-
ager,. And he added: “You’re fined
fifty dollars.”

  Reynolds whirled about.

  “What for?” he demanded, his voice
raised to nearly a shout.

  “For not showing up at morning
practice, and for drunkenness last night.
You’re half drunk now.”

  “You’re a-” Reynolds hesitated

to speak the word.

  His lips were curled back in an ugly
snarl, and he glared rebelliously into
the steady, piercing eyes of the man-
ager. Silently they faced each other—
Reynolds, the tiger; Kineally, the lion.
Both were equally tall, though the man-
ager was stockier than his black-eyed,
dark-complexioned pitcher. Kineally
removed his panama and combed his
fingers through his reddish-brown
hair.

  “Your face is as flushed as if you
had a fever,” he said. “Your eyes
are bloodshot, and late hours have
smooched half-moons of charcoal under
them, so’s any one could tell that you

are traveling straight plumb to the
dogs!”

  Reynolds muttered inarticulately.

  “Yes, that’s where you’re bound!”
continued the manager. “I’m not old
enough to be your father, but I’ve been
kicking around in this world for some
fifteen or sixteen years longer than you
have, and I’ve had plenty of chance to
learn that a pitcher, or any other ball
player, can’t work as battery mate with
Old Demon Booze and last long in the
diamond game.

  “You were the best pitcher on my
staff last year, and you twirled your
team into a championship; but now
you’re a-hitting the toboggan just as
fast as any one can. When you are so-
ber and in good physical condition there
isn’t a better man ever toed the slab
than you are; and that’s why I haven’t
traded you during the past month. I
hoped you’d wake up and cut out the
booze and the gang of high-living sports
you are traveling with; but if you don’t
get your eyes open and quit drinking
before we start on the Western trip,
I’ll try to make a deal with some other
club, and trade you before the other
managers get wise to the fact that you
are drinking yourself out of the game.”

  Reynolds mumbled something.

  “What?” Kineally asked.

  “I guess some o’ those other man-
agers’d be glad to get me,” Reynolds
repeated.

  “Yes, until they found that you were
a souse,” Kineally added; "and then
they’d shunt you back to the minors in
double-quick. You’d probably last a
year or two in the bushes, and then
some little one-horse minor-league out-
fit would give you your unconditional
release; and you'd be a has-been, while
you were yet a kid. Some future, eh?”

  Reynolds slouched against the bu-
reau, his hands deep in his pockets. A
sullen, defiant expression distorted his
features.
THE SHOCK

113

  Kineally wiped a handkerchief across
his forehead.

  “I’ll be hanged if I know why I've
stood for your drinking and violation
of training rules as long as I have!” he
exclaimed. “I reckon it’s because I
remember what a likable, clean young
duffer you were when I first bought
you from that little bush league up-
country.”

  As he paused, the manager happened
to glance past the ball player at a pic-
ture standing on the bureau. It was
the photograph of a girl, in her early
twenties; and the face—the expression
of the eyes—the mouth and chin—por-
trayed that rare combination of beauty
of character as well as of feature.

  The manager pointed toward the pic-
ture.

  “To ask a personal question, Rube,”
he began; “is she your sister ?”

  Following the direction of Kineally's
extended finger, Reynolds shook his
head.

  Kineally’s eyes gleamed his satisfac-
tion. Another avenue of appeal was
open!

  “Then she must be your sweetheart,
for I know that you’re not married.”
he stated ; and he added earnestly: “I
suppose you hope to be married some
day ?”

  Reynolds failed to reply. His liquor-
inflamed brain was busy mobilizing the
little devils of rage and rebellion. What
right had Kineally to catechize him, he
angrily pondered. Who gave the man-
ager a license to butt into his private
life ?

  “Why don’t you quit the booze and
go straight, for her sake if not your
own?” the manager inquired, after an
interval. “You can hardly expect a
decent girl, like the original of that pic-
ture must be, to marry a drunken sot,
such as continuing your present pace
will make you.”

  Drunken sot! No decent girl would
marry him! Even through his liquor-
^8A

soaked brain, Reynolds realized that
the words rang true; but their very
truth was like the red rag fluttered
before the bull.

  “You’re a liar!” he rasped. And he
sprang toward the manager, one fist
lunging forward as he leaped. Though
heavily built, Kineally was quick on his
feet. Swiftly he side-stepped and par-
ried the blow. Reynolds whirled about
and rushed a second time. Again and
again his fists struck out, and Kineally
took blow after blow on his hands and
arms, .turning them all aside. Obsessed
by his whisky-stimulated wrath, Reyn-
olds forgot all his knowledge of box-
ing. His one thought was to beat down
the big man before him, who so steadily
blocked the punches, and kept forcing
him backward without striking a blow.

  Back, step by step, they went, until
Reynolds stumbled. Instantly the man-
ager closed in, grasping the pitcher’s
wrists and endeavoring to force him
down into a chair. Back and forth
they struggled, reeling about the room,
until, with a crash, they brought up
against the bureau. With a sudden
twist, Reynolds wrenched one hand free
from the manager’s viselike grip. The
pitcher reached behind him and groped
over the bureau top; and an instant
afterward something flashed through
the air, thudding dully against the man-
ager’s head.

  Reynolds heard a gasp, and the fin-
gers about his wrist relaxed. The man-
ager’s knees buckled forward, and he
crumpled backward on the rug—a mo-
tionless heap.

  Breathing heavily, Reynolds stood
above the inert form, a heavy brass
ash tray still grasped in his fist. Parti-
cles of blood dotted its edge. For a
moment, brute satisfaction was reflected
from his face. Then his expression
changed to that of alarm. Why did
Kineally lie so still? Why was the
fallen man’s face so pale? Dropping
to his knees, Reynolds pressed a hand
114

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

against the manager’s shirt front. The
pitcher’s hand was trembling, and his
own heart pounding furiously, as he
fumbled anxiously about on the man-
ager’s breast. He could feel no action,
and a crimson stain, like red ink on a
sheet of blotting paper, was spreading,
with ragged circumference, upon the
manager’s hair.

  The pitcher grasped the manager’s
shoulders and shook the deathlike form.

  “Kineally! Kineally! Owen Kin-
eally!” he cried.

  He jumped to his feet and seized the
water pitcher, pouring all of the stale
fluid it contained over the manager’s
face; but the eyes remained closed;
the form still.

  Slowly Reynolds backed away from
the prostrate man.

  “Heavens!” he whispered. “He—
he’s dead ! I’m a murderer!”

  And with the words came another
thought. He had killed Kineally! They
would arrest him! Into his vision
flashed the picture of a chair with
straps on its arms, legs, and back, and
a few solemn spectators gathered about.
No, they mustn’t catch him! He must
get away!

  Moving hurriedly about, and ever
averting his gaze from the form on the
floor, he donned a few garments for
street wear. Ready to leave, he spied
the picture upon the bureau. He
snatched it up and turned it over.
Penned 011 its back in a feminine hand
was: “From Dora to Bob.”

  Hastily tucking it into his inside
pocket, he opened the door and stepped
into the hall. His nerveless fingers
swung the door shut, and he trod
softly down the stairs.

  When the evening train coughed into
Farmhill station, Reynolds, clad in a
dark suit, and with his cloth hat pulled
far down over his eyes, swung off on
the side farthest from the station, and
making a detour to avoid the well-

lighted section of the town, he struck
out into the country.

  Once during his flight, while chang-
ing trains at a junction, he had heard
one diminutive newsboy mention the
name “Reynolds” to another grimy-
faced little urchin, and Rube had stolen
a sidelong glance at the bunch of papers
folded beneath the boy’s arm. The
paper, being folded in the middle, pre-
vented him from reading the whole of
the big black headline, but on the side
of the sheet near to him he spelled out:
“M-U-R-D-”

  As he tramped along in the soft dust
of the country road, with the frogs and
insects peeping and shrilling strange
noises out of the dusk of the night, his
thoughts rose in rebellion. It wasn't
murder! Murder was something fear-
ful—something repulsive, and he hadn’t
intended to—to kill Kineally. He had
struck in self-defense! He strove to
convince himself that such had been the
case, but every frog—every insect kept
shrilling: “Murder—murder—it was
murder!”

  Not until he reached the Whately
farm did he realize that it would be
impossible for him to see Dora that
night. The chimes of a church in a
distant town were sounding the curfew
hour, when he paused by the stone wall
encircling that part of the W'hately
farm. Why he had returned to Farm-
hill, he did not know. Something had
seemed to draw him to that little town
in the valley; and he wanted to see
Dora just once more before disappear-
ing to some far corner of the world,
where no one would know him, where
no one could find him.

  For a moment he thought of boldly
entering the house, but he quickly dis-
missed the idea. They must have read
the papers and knew of his crime. Noel
Whately and his wife had always liked
young Bob Reynolds; and Dora—he
knew that Dora’s regard was more than
friendship for him, but he hesitated to
THE SHOCK

115

thrust himself, branded as a criminal,
into that family circle.

  He easily vaulted the stone wall and
moved around the house to the barn.
As he picked his way across the barn-
yard, another thought came to him.
What folly his return to Farmhill was!
It would only make more painful the
breaking of the ties!

  “I mustn’t see her!” he whispered to
himself.

  But no train left the town until early
morning, so he resolved to stay in the
barn until nearly daylight, and then
return to the station.

  As he neared the barn, a prolonged
sniff caused him to start and crouch
near to the ground. Then he remem-
bered. It was Wolf, the dog—the com-
panion, who had accompanied Dora and
him on their tramps across the fields,
and on their fishing trips to the lake.

  “Wolf!” he called softly.

  The big collie came bounding through
the darkness.

  “Still, Wolf ! Be still, boy!” he com-
manded.

  To his relief, the dog recognized him
and refrained from barking. Two paws
pressed against his knee, and the ani-
mal whined joyously.

  “Go back, Wolf!” he ordered, as he
patted and fondled the collie.

  Reluctantly, the dog turned toward
his kennel, and Reynolds slid open the
door of the barn. A restless horse
tramped in his stall and a frightened
rat scuttled across the floor, as he felt
about in the darkness and found the
ladder leading upward. Nimbly he as-
cended to the loft, and, creeping far
over to the wall, he stretched himself
upon the odorous hay.

  He closed his eyes, but sleep would
not come. He faintly heard the clock
in the farmhouse striking the hour.
After an age of sleeplessness, it tinkled
again. The smell of the sun-dried grass
brought remembrances of his boyhood,
and he thought of the plans he and

Dora had made for the future. Then
he remembered the “good fellows” of
the city, with their invitations to “have
another,” and their shallow praise. He
groaned in despair. He had severed
himself from all of the real joys of
life, and now he was but a hunted thing
—to prowl forever from place to place,
in his efforts to escape the relentless
hand of the law.

  As he lay there, an almost uncon-
trollable desire to scratch a match, that
he might relieve the awful blackness,
possessed him.

  “I can’t,” he reflected. “It might set
fire to the place.”

  Suddenly he sat up, gasping, with a
whistling intaking of breath. What had
he heard! Again they came! The faint
strains of music were permeating the
loft, as if some stringed instrument was
being played close by. He dug his fin-
gers into his ears, hoping that the
sounds might be the product of his
imagination. But no! As he removed
his fingers, they continued; a strange,
weird tune, unlike anything he had ever
heard before.

  Again he jammed his fingers into his
ears to shut out the sounds. Had his
crime driven him mad ? Was he
haunted, he wondered fearfully. With
unsteady, trembling legs, he made his
way to the ladder and lowered himself
downward. He crouched in an unoc-
cupied stall and waited. A rat squeaked
beside him, but he failed to move.
He was listening for that fearsome
music; and whenever he closed his eyes,
the white face of Kineally would spring
before his vision.

  Of what avail was his freedom if this
continued, he thought. Ideas of giving
himself up entered his mind; but he
remembered the high-backed chair with
its straps and its horrible death-dealing
wires. What a death! No! He
couldn’t surrender himself! But still,
if he was to be forever haunted, why,
maybe it would be better. Maybe it-
116

  With a start, Reynolds awoke—not
from sound sleep, but from one of the
fitful dozes, into which he had lapsed
just before the gray light of morning
began to lighten the barn. With an
ejaculation of self-rebuke, he sprang
up and stood, blinking, in the shaft of
sunlight which blazed through a cob-
webby, dusty window. He, who had
intended to depart before sunrise, had
overslept. He could hear persons mov-
ing about in the farmhouse, as well as
the occasional rattling of crockery and
the sputter of grease in a frying pan.

  Then footsteps sounded outside of
the barn, and before he could turn—
could dart to cover—the door slid back,
and a girl stood before him. Her face,
crowned by a wavy mass of fine-spun,
fair hair, was the flesh-and-blood like-
ness of that portrayed by the picture
he carried in his pocket. She wore
neither hat nor bonnet, and a dotted
bungalow apron covered her from
shoulders to ankles. She stared in
amazement, her brows puckering as she
noted the rumpled condition of his
clothing—his drawn features and his
bloodshot eyes.

  “Why, Bob!” she exclaimed per-
plexedly. “What—why—how-”

  As she paused, he moved forward a
step, his nails biting into the palms of
his clenched fists. Oh, how he longed
to take her in his arms and tell her the
whole miserable story! Little beads of
moisture surged into his eyes; and in a
moment she was close to him, resting
her hands on his shoulders.

  “Tell me, Bob!” she said anxiously.
“Tell me what is the matter. Why
didn’t j'ou come to the house? Why
are your clothes all mussed up?”
Choking back his emotions, he hesi-
tatingly placed his hands on her arms.

  “D—don’t you know?” he inquired
brokenly.

  “Know what?” she demanded.

  “I—I-” He hesitated to say the

words. “Heavens, Dora, you must have

read last night’s paper! Don’t you know
that I’m a—a murderer? Oh, Dora,
I’m a murderer!”

  Her fingers clinched convulsively
through his coat and pinched into his
shoulders.

  “I’ve killed a man—the man who was
giving me a chance!” he groaned. “All
because of the cursed drink!” And,
with his head bowed on her shoulder,
he poured forth the story of his fight
with Kineally—of his trip to Farmhill
—and of his night in the barn. Then
his arms relaxed and he gently tried to
push her away.

  “Don’t touch me, girl!” he told her.
“I’m a murderer—not fit to touch!”
Her arms slipped about his neck, and
she held him closer.

  “I won’t leave you—I won’t!” she
cried. “Oh, Bob! don't you know that
I love you? We’ll go somewhere
together.”

  “No!” he protested. “Why, Dora,
I’m haunted. I lay up there in the loft
last night and heard music—that dread-
ful, unearthly music; and Kin—his face
kept coming before me out of the dark-
ness. No; I’m going to give myself
up and have it over with.”

  With the passion and entreaty of one
who loved, she argued, but he steadily
persisted in his resolve. He gently drew
her arms from about his neck. She
made one final appeal.

  “Wait, Bob!” she pleaded. “Let me
go into the house and get last night’s
paper. I’m sure that there wasn’t any
—any murder headline on it.” And she
darted from the stable.

  Her mother, busy in the kitchen,
glanced up in surprise at the flushed
cheeks and excited eyes of the girl.

  “What in the world-” she began,

but Dora interrupted.

  “Where is last night’s paper,
mother?” she asked.

  “On the sitting-room table, I think,”
Mrs. Whately replied.

  Dora hurried from the room. The
THE SHOCK

117

paper was not on the sitting-room table,
and she searched frantically about the
room. Finally she found it, half hid-
den under a pillow on the lounge, where
her father had left it the evening before.
Spreading out the first page, she read:

MURDOCK TESTIFIES.

Iron King Goes Before Congressional
Committee.

  Nowhere on the page was Reynolds’
name mentioned. She hurriedly rustled
over page after page, until at last, on
one of the sporting pages, she discov-
ered a small paragraph commenting on
his poor pitching of the day previous.
Paper in hand, she sped back to the
barn. Reynolds was not in sight.

  “Bob!” she called softly; but received
no answer.

  Into the loft she climbed, but he was
not there. As she stood on the hay,
she became aware of a peculiar sound.
Music! That was what it resembled,
and across her mind flashed the words
of Bob. For some seconds she listened
in bewilderment, and then the little
wrinkles of perplexity cleared from her
forehead. She climbed higher upon the
hay, until she reached a tiny window,
far up near the roof. Over its opening
were stretched several taut elastics—
the work of her little brother. With
each gust of breeze they vibrated and
twanged, making sounds not unlike the
music of a harp or a zither.

  Descending from the loft, she hur-
ried out of the bam. The man whom
she loved must have taken advantage
of her absence to hasten away, she rea-
soned, that he might carry out his re-
solve to surrender himself to the au-
thorities. So down the dusty road she
hurried, determined to overtake him ere
he should reach the town.

  A great gray touring car hummed its
way along the country road, a continu-
ous cloud of dust, like rising smoke,

trailing in its wake. A big, burly man,
with tanned features, and whose eyes
were obscured by masking goggles,
gripped the wheel; while beside him sat
another man, not so big, but with a
bristling black mustache and keen
piercing eyes.

  “Remember, Mac!” the big man was
saying; “if we find him I don’t want
the newspaper men or anybody else to
ever hear a word of this. I called on
you for help because you are a friend
of mine as well as a police inspector,
trained in the ways of tracing men.”

  “Don’t you worry, Owen!” the other
replied. “Never a word will get out.
Nine times out of ten a young fellow
who has committed a crime, or thinks
he has, will risk a trip to his home or
old surroundings. If we don’t find the
boy somewhere about Farmhill, we’ll
change our tactics. He must have
landed quite a crack on your skull,” he
added.

  “He surely did,” the big man agreed.
“I was unconscious for a half hour or
more; and I guess your idea, that he
imagined he’d finished me, and was thus
frightened into running away, is right."

  The man with th6 wiry mustache
nodded and tightly gripped the side of
the car as they jounced over a par-
ticularly high bump in the road.

  “But if the experience proves to be
the shock necessary to break the boy
away from the drink and that gang he
was traveling with,” continued the big
man; “why, I’ll be mighty thankful that
he struck the blow. He’s not only a
wonderful pitcher, but I like him. He
—look, Mac, look! So help me, John
Rogers! Look ahead, there!”

  Appearing around a bend in the road-
way, from behind the trees of the road-
side, a solitary figure was tramping
toward them.

  Stopping the engine and jamming his
foot against the brake pedal, the big
man jerked the car to an abrupt stop
118

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

beside the young fellow, who had
turned out and halted by the edge of
the road, waiting for the automobile to

pass.

  “Rube!” the big man cried, pushing
his goggles up on his forehead and
springing from the car.

  The man by the roadside stood as if
paralyzed. He stared wildly at the big
man who had leaped from the automo-
bile.

  “K—Kineally !” came from between
his lips in a throaty whisper. “Kineally !
Owen Kineally!”

  He slowly—fearfully extended a
hand as if to touch the big manager—
to make sure that he was a reality and
not the fantasy of a haunted mind.

  The big man quickly reached forth
and firmly grasped the hand.

  “It’s me, all right, Rube!” he assured,
with the flicker of a smile. “It takes a
mighty hard wallop to put a tough old
geezer like me down for good.”

  Drawing free his hand, the young fel-
low dropped upon one knee in the
dusty, sun-scorched grass of the road-
side, and burying his face in his arm,
he gave vent to his pent-up emotions,
his body shaking with convulsive, boy-

ish sobs of relief. The bareheaded girl,
who had appeared around the bend of
the road and was hurrying toward
them, was unnoticed by Kineally and
the inspector.

  “I—I’m glad ! I’m glad!” the kneel-
ing man choked out. “I’m going to
stay here away from the drink, and so
help me, Heaven, I’ll never touch an-
other drop!”

  The big man rested a hand on the
young fellow’s shoulder.

  “No, I don’t think you will drink any
more, boy!” he said. “But,” he con-
tinued, “you are coming back with me,
and I’ll make you the greatest pitcher
in the game, and you and the girl can
marry and be happy.”

  Before the young fellow could reply,
the girl was beside them, her eyes aglow
and her bosom rising and falling rap-
idly as she breathed. Many a picture
of Owen Kineally had smiled at her
from among the pages of newspapers,
and she recognized the big man stand-
ing over Reynolds. Unmindful of the
others, she dropped to her knees beside
the man she loved, and with her arms
about his neck, she murmured: “Oh,
but I’m happy, Bob! I’m so happy!!”

UNIQUE NAMES FOR CREEKS

THAT Iowa is a farming State is reflected in the names of many of the
streams that flow through it.

To begin with, there is a Farm Creek, so that Farmer’s Creek has a
place. Then there is a Chicken Creek, a Duck Creek, a Goose Creek, and a
number of Turkey Creeks, as well as Pigeon Creek. There are Fox, Hawk, and
Rat Creeks to make way with the domestic animals, and some Crow Creeks,
while there is also a Fly Creek and Mosquito Creek to worry the summer
boarders. Milk and Cold Water Creeks are present, likewise a Hog Run and a
Mud Creek, so that Bacon Creek is not strange.

    It seems natural that with a Bee Creek and a Bee Branch there should also
be a Honey Creek. There are a couple of Cherry Creeks, a Crabapple Creek, and
plenty of Plum Creeks, and, for wild animals, there are Bear, Beaver, Buck,
Crane, Deer, Doe, Elk, Otter, Panther, Raccoon, Skunk, and Wolf Creeks.

    With a Keg Creek there is a Whisky Creek and a Whisky Run. Finally,
there is Purgatory Creek.
(apa J)ay

Bernard Teevkrv__,

HE old sailor, Cap’n Dan,
sat on the edge of the
deck house of the sloop
Agnes T., watching the
fleet coining in from the
day’s work at “dragrak-
ing.” The “handrakers”
were already in, the con-
tents of their baskets emptied into his,
and piled up neatly in the hold, their
scores tallied up in the little leather-cov-
ered notebook that was Cap’n Dan’s
daybook, ledger, journal, and every-
thing else known to the practice of ac-
counts.

  The handrakers had all brought in
a good day’s catch. If the dragrakers
did as well, the Agnes T. would have a
heavy load to carry to the city, and the
money to meet the note which would
soon be due would be ready when the
time came to pay it.

  Cap’n Dan cast an eye aloft at the
empty bushel basket which had been
hoisted at the masthead to let every one
know the Agnes T. was ready to buy
clams. Then he looked out toward the
mouth of the harbor, where the first
of the fleet of dragrakers was coming
in around the point. In that instant
the expression of his face altered, and
his troubled glance changed to one of
pride and pleasure.

  The cut of the head of the mainsail
told him that, as usual, it was the Vic-
torine that was leading the fleet, out-
pointing and outfooting the Ranger,
Nautilus, and the Dashazvay, to say
nothing of the other sloops less famed
for their speed. Parental pride shone
clear in his gray eyes, for was not the
Victorine his own boat, and was not his
only son, Young Dan, sailing her?

  Young Dan, at twenty-one, had al-
ready won the reputation of being the
smartest boatman in Lockport. The
way he would carry on sail was, in the
words of the clammers, “a caution.’
He was the light of his father’s eye,
and Cap'n Dan had begun to lean rather
heavily on his son.

  He was looking forward to the time
when Dan’s already keen business abil-
ity would be sufficiently recognized to
have the dealers up in the market place
the same reliance on his word as they
had for so many years placed on the
father’s. Then he could step aside and
take a rest, that rest so many men look
forward to before the great rest comes.

  When Young Dan caught sight of his
father he arose from his seat on the
wheel box and swung his arm in saluta-
tjon. Then he gave the wheel a couple
of turns, shot the Victorine up in the
wind, and laid her alongside the Agnes
120

T. as if the sloop were a fast horse,
that a skillful driver had stopped at a
carriage block.

  “What luck, Dannie?” called his
father. “I see yon wasn’t the last one
in.”

  "Had a bully day, dad. Struck a
fresh bed off West P int, and got a jim-
dandy load. Goin’ to send any to mar-
ket to-night?” Then, casting back to
his father’s allusion to his beating the
other boats, he added dryly: "Oh, yes,
there’s some go in the old Victorine yet.
Them fellers make me tired with their
talk about beatin’ her.”

  “Just as soon as we c’n git the Agnes
T. loaded, Dan, I want you to start for
the market. Dolan telegraphed me to-
day they wanted all I could send 'em,
and as soon as I could get ’em off.”

  As the boy had stepped aboard the
sloop by this time, the captain added, in
a whisper: “You know that Voorhees
note falls due day after to-morrow, and
I need the money to meet it.”

  Dan nodded his head, and some of
the gravity that had settled down again
on his father’s face was reflected on his
own. Then he started in on the heavy
task of transferring his day's catch
from the deck of the Victorine to the
hold of the market boat.

  While he and the three men who
made up the working crew were hard
at this, the remaining boats of the fleet
were coming up, one by one, and rang-
ing themselves on either side of the
market boat. With jibs hauled down,
and mainsails slatting in the breeze,
they all lay head to the wind, while
their crews passed basket after basket
down into the hold of the Agnes T, to
the accompaniment of loud interchanges
of talk and chaff.

  Before the sun had vanished in the
west, the loading was accomplished, the
sloops had pushed off, one by one, and
worked away to their anchorages for
the night, and Young Dan and Jim
Humphreys, who comprised his crew,

had hoisted the mainsail on the Ag-
nes T.

  His father hauled his skiff alongside
as Young Dan and Humphreys went
forward to get in the anchor, and, as
the pawls clinked against the ratchets,
with that sound which is so .musical to
a seaman’s ears, Cap’n Dan picked up
the oars and started to pull toward the
shore.

  “Be careful, Dannie,” he called across
the water. It was the usual warning
and farewell. “Don't carry that tops'l
after dark. It begins to look squally off
to wind’ard.”

  “All right, father!" yelled Young
Dan, as the anchor broke from the
ground and he ran aft to the wheel.
“We’ve got to get these clams to mar-
ket, you know.”

  He spun the wheel over as Hum-
phreys hoisted the jib, and the sloop
filled away, with her bowsprit pointing
out toward the mouth of the harbor.

  By the time the Agnes T. had cleared
the point, Young Dan found that the
wind had freshened considerably, and
was now coming out of the northwest
in such vigorous puffs that carrying the
topsail was out of the question. Hum-
phreys suggested turning in a reef, but
Young Dan said he guessed that wasn’t
necessary just yet. He asked Jim to
take the wheel while he went below to
put on his coat. When he had taken
his place again, Humphreys dropped
down into the cabin, lit the fire, and put
the kettle on for tea.

  Young Dan ate his evening meal as
he sat at the wheel, and before it was
finished the increasing force of the
wind made steering with one hand and
holding his teacup in the other a rather
difficult business. When it was finished,
and Humphreys had cleared away the
dishes, he came up on deck and settled
down in the lee of the deck house, with
his coat collar turned up around his
ears.

  “Gee, Dannie, but it’s blowin’!” he
CAP'N DAN’S SON

121

commented. “And ain't she a-travelin’,
though? Do you want me to get out
the lights?”

  “Oh, never mind ’em,” replied Young
Dan. with the sailor's too common dis-
regard of the use of side lights. “We
can light ’em up when we get around
the fort. Come and take the wheel, will
you, Jim? I want to fix that jib. She's
slattin’ round there, and ain't half
drawin’.”

  Jim uncoiled himself from his cor-
ner, in the lee of the house, and took
the wheel as Young Dan went forward.
They were off Coffin’s Beach by this
time, and Jim could see the summer
hotels lifting their huge bulks up against
the dark-blue sky, studded with stars
that twinkled with unusual brilliancy in
the frosty night air.

  As the sloop was running dead be-
fore the wind, the mainsail was doing
all the work, and the jib was slatting to
and fro, and not doing what the young
skipper thought it should. That was
how his passion for carrying sail
showed itself, and that was the cause of
the tragedy that followed.

  Picking up the long oar lying along
the rail, he took a turn of the sheet
around it at the clew of the jib, and
boomed the sail out to port, where it
caught the full strength of the wind.
As it bellied out, causing the sloop to
fairly jump through the water, Young
Dan watched it for a moment, and then
called out to his companion:

  “How’s that, Jim? Ain’t she a-pull-
in’?”

  Before Humphreys could make a re-
ply, he heard a crash, and the wheel
was jerked out of his hands.

  To his horror, he saw the mast break
off just under the hounds. With the
topmast and all the gear, it fell to the
deck, striking Young Dan, and bury-
ing him beneath the wreckage.

  The shock of the accident stunned
Humphreys for a moment. Then he
jumped forward along the tossing deck

to drag his companion's body out from
under the splintered spars, sails, and
rigging.

  The jib was lying in a tangled heap,
and the mainsail was hanging broad off
to leeward, dipping down into the seas
as the sloop rolled, and coming up with
a jerk, as if it meant to pluck the cleats
and blocks and traveler clear from their
fastenings.

  Humphreys caught hold of Young
Dan’s feet, and, gently as he could,
pulled him out from beneath the piled-
up gear. Stricken as he was by the
shock of the catastrophe, terror caught
a fresh grip on him as he saw the boy's
face.

  Ashy white, he lay with his eyes
closed as if in death. Across his fore-
head a great cut ran, with the blood
slowly and steadily oozing out, and
down through his hair, already matted
with the thick stream.

  Humphreys sickened at the sight, and
tried to turn his head away. For the
moment he was panic-stricken, then he
shook himself together, and half car-
ried, half dragged the body of the boy
down into the cabin and stretched him
gently on the blankets in the berth.
Then he jumped on deck again.

  For the time one idea possessed him:
He must get a doctor for Dannie. He
never thought to let the anchor go,
never thought to light a signal lamp.
He wanted to get a doctor at once, and
he knew there were two or three doc-
tors at the quarantine station over by
the fort.

  Humphreys had lost his head, in the
desire to carry out this plan of action.
Pie tumbled the skiff overboard, shipped
the oars, and, hatless, and without tak-
ing time to pull off his coat, he began
to row to the government reservation,
where the one tiling needed, a doctor,
was to be found.

  No one knows how long it took him
to pull across the mile of water, nor
122

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

how long it was before he rushed,
breathless, up to the doctor’s door.
Without even sinking down into the
chair the kindly health officer pushed
over to him, he stammered out the story
of tlie tragedy that had been enacted
out in the bay, on the deck of the
Agnes T.

  Before Jim had finished his tale, the
health officer called to one of his as-
sistants to ring up the boat and let the
captain know they were going out.
Then he busied himself putting some in-
struments into a black bag, and, before
Jim had completely recovered his wind,
he was in danger of losing it again as
he followed the doctor and his assistant
down the path to the landing, where the
little white tug, with its tall, yellow
stack, was moored.

  As they went along, the health officer
asked Humphreys for the address of
the injured boy’s father.

  “We'll send him a telegram," he said.
“Then he'll probably come out to look
for the sloop, too. You say she had no
lights burning? Hum! That makes it
so much harder to 'find her.”

  They stopped at the office of the press
association, down at the pier, and the
operator sent the message to Lockport,
following it with a brief story of the
accident to the main office up in the
city. Then they stepped aboard the tug,
the lines were cast off, and the search
for the Agnes T. began.

  What that night was to Humphreys,
and to Cap’n Dan, who, on receipt of
the telegram, had hired the only tug in
Lockport and started out to find his
son, only they could tell. Calculating
on the direction of the wind, and the
set of the tides, the two tugs cruised
about until the day began to break along
the eastern horizon.

  Working gradually to the eastward,
backward and forward on long
stretches, the tugs gradually, as if by
a common instinct, drew together. By

the time the dawn had broken, and
Humphrey could make out the other
tug, he told the health officer she was
from Lockport, and that probably Cap’n
Dan was aboard her.

  He stepped outside the pilot house,
with a pair of binoculars in his hand,
and, as he did so, he noticed a man do
the same thing on the other boat.

  Putting the glasses to his eyes, a
glance told him that it was Young Dan’s
father. Humphreys swung his arm
over his head, and then saw the captain
turn and speak to the man in the pilot
house. A moment later, just as the tug
headed for the health officer's boat, the
captain of the latter, who had been
scanning the horizon, gave a start, and
cried out: “There she is!" Pointing
off to the eastward, he twirled the
spokes over, gave a pull on the jingle
bell, and whistled down the tube to the
engineer to "give her all the steam she
could carry.”

  The eyes of every one on the two
boats turned in the direction in which
the quarantine tug was headed, and
then the sound of the jingle bell on the
Lockport boat came across the water.

  Head and head, they raced to the
eastward, smoke pouring from their
funnels, and a broad wave of foaming
water piled up before their bows. The
light was now strong enough for them
to make out the Agnes Taground on
the long, sandy beach at the eastern end
of the harbor.

  As she lay with her bow buried in
the sand, and listed over by the weight
of the outswung boom and the wreck
of the topmast, the sloop made a tragic
picture in itself. The cold, gray light
of the dawn fell down and around the
Agnes T., making her stand out against
the steel-blue water and the pale sand
hills, looming large against this back-
ground until her proportions seemed gi-
gantic.

  The mainsail hung idly down from
CAP’N DAN’S SON

123

the gaff, that had been held just below
the break in the mast by the jamming of
the hoops. The main sheet trailed over-
board in long, tangled loops, the shrouds
and halyards drooped in picturesque
confusion. Jib and mainsail were gray
with the night dew and the reflected
light.

  The little waves rolled up and broke
along her sides and spent their tiny
force upon the beach. So they were
doing yesterday, when Young Dan was
living; so they were doing to-day, when
the boy was lying stretched out in the
berth, a ghastly, solitary tenant.

  As the two tugs came nearer and
nearer to her, the Lockport boat gradu-
ally drew ahead of the health, officer’s
tug. They could see Cap’n Dan go aft
with one of his best men and stand by
the painter of the skiff that was towing
astern. Humphrey noticed a couple of
men standing on the beach, near the
wrecked sloop, and through the glasses
he made them out to be patrols from the
life-saving station.

  He could also see a big power boat
coming down from the village that lay
inside the point, still farther to the east-
ward, and he wondered if her business
lay with the Agnes T. The leading tug
slowed down as she reached a point in
the channel, off the wreck. Cap’n Dan
and the man near him dropped over
into the skiff and pulled like madmen
for the sloop.

  Just as they came alongside of her,
the power boat swung up by the wreck,
and a man standing up in the bow
called to the captain:

  “'Keep off that boat! There’s a dead
man aboard of her, and I’m the coro-
ner. I warn you-” His words

trailed off into silence as he caught sight
of Cap’n Dan’s face.

  Even the crass spirit of a jack-in-
office could not resist the mute protest
he saw in every line of it. Stern, rigid,
a very mask of immobility, given a dig-

nity that made it noble by its grief and
suffering, the father's face awed every-
thing into silence.

  Moving as in a trance, Cap’n Dan
climbed over the rail of the sloop and
stepped down into the cabin.

  As he disappeared from sight, the
spell of silence laid on the coroner was
broken, and he began to mutter protests
against “violations of the law,” and de-
claring “he’d stop this thing right now,
before it went any further.”

  Presently Cap’n Dan emerged from
the cabin, carrying the limp body of
his son in his arms. As he stepped into
the cockpit, the coroner’s voice was
hushed.

  The father straightened himself up
with a dignity that made the movement
noble, and faced the official with eyes
that looked across the boy’s body.

  Between the time he had gone down
into the cabin and came out of it,
twenty years seemed to have been added
to his age. In his grief, he looked like
some old chieftain who had given up
the life of his favorite son in his coun-
try’s cause, and was now bearing the
body home to his castle to mourn over
it.	v

  A little shadow of deeper pain passed
across his face as he looked at the in-
truder on his woe, and then he said
simply:

  “He is my son.”

  At the sound of his voice, and the
look in his face, the coroner recoiled
from the captain as if he had been
struck. The man in the skiff uncov-
ered his head. He thought Young Dan
was dead.

  The captain, still holding the boy in
his arms, stepped down into the skiff
and held him close to his breast as the
man at the oars pulled slowly toward
the tug. By this time the health offi-
cer’s boat had come up to the skiff, and
the doctor, leaning over the rail, said
quietly: “Let me see him, captain.”
124

WIDE-AWAKE MAGAZINE

  Cap'n Dan looked up at the doctor.

  “He’s dead,” he said, almost in a
whisper.

  “Won’t you let us see him? There
may be a chance,” the doctor pleaded.

  Then Cap'n Dan held his son out to
the two doctors, who laid him down on
a blanket on the deck.

  There was a moment of silence as the
two worked over the body; then, with
an exclamation of satisfaction, one of
the doctors sprang to his feet.

  “I thought so!” he cried. “I thought
he was still breathing! He’s badly hurt,
but the poor lad is not dead!"

  Cap’n Dan stood as if turned to stone.
A great tear rolled down his face, but
he said nothing. He watched with in-

describable pathos as the surgeons
brought their skill into play, and finally,
when Young Dan began to babble an
incoherent string of words, he drew one
weather-beaten hand across his eyes, as
if in a daze.

  A while later, Young Dan sighed and
looked into his father’s face.

  “Was I in time, dad?” he whispered
softly.

  Cap’n Dan smiled down at him, and
lied so bravely that the recording angel
must have stopped to mend his pen just
then, and forgot to mark it down
against him.

  “Plenty, Dannie, plenty,” he replied.

  And then he leaned still farther down
and kissed him.

YOU want me to be a crook?”

Grant Seward’s jaw squared, as he shot this from between his set
teeth, and there was a dangerous flash in his dark eyes.

    “I wouldn’t put it that way, Grant.”

    “There isn’t any other way. You don’t call it straight—do you?”

    This was what Grant Seward replied to his unscrupulous employer, when
the scoundrel wanted him to cheat the customers by filling up the five-gallon
Beaver Spring water bottles with ordinary river water. There were other frauds
suggested by the rascally storekeeper, too, which Grant spurned.

    The upshot of it is that Grant Seward finds himself in the business of cut-
ting ice on the St. Lawrence River, among the Thousand Islands, with the ther-
mometer near the bottom of the tube, and winds that threaten to saw his ears
off, even through his thick cap.

    Besides battling with the ice and an arctic temperature, rather than be a
party to the groceryman’s mean trickery, Grant has to fight several human
enemies, who have a habit of “hitting below the belt.” You will read all this
and much more in the new novelette,

A BATTLE BELOW ZERO,

BY WELDON W. BRODERICK

to be published in the next issue. The story is full of thrilling adventures, with
some novel and narrow escapes for this thoroughly American hero. He strikes
all his own blows fairly and squarely, giving the other fellow always a fair
show—often when he hardly deserves it. I can promise the novelette to be
one of the breeziest, most convincing, and absorbing that has ever come from
this author’s facile pen.

    There have been many calls from readers for more stories from Cornelius
Shea. In a recent issue, you were promised that this call would be answered.
It has been, for Shea has just completed a serial which he has entitled

and it carries an appeal to every reader of fiction who has a drop of red blood
in his veins. The first chapters of this serial begin in the next issue, and depict

Western life in a manner that has made Shea famous as a writer of stories
dealing with stirring doings on the borderland.

    In the opinion of many, Leslie W. Quirk is the best writer of sport stories
in this country. Certainly it is true that he is an authority on all sports, and
you feel when you read his description of a contest of any kind that the author
knows what he is writing about, that he has been right down there himself,
and has not just sat up in the grand stand, or read about it the next day in
the morning paper. Not only does Quirk know ail sports, but he knows how to
tell about them in a most interesting manner. His plot is always a good one,
and he draws his characters so well that they “stick.”

THE YELLOW MORNING-GLORY

which you will find in the next issue, is, in my humble opinion, the best run-
ning story that Quirk has ever written. It is quite a long story, but, take my
word for it, you will wish that he had made it twice as long.

    There is a particularly well-assorted and well-written collection of short
stovies in the next issue. Let me hear what you think of my selection, and which

      The initials of all nouns in the sentence given below, when placed in their
 proper order, form the name of a sport. One letter, however, is omitted. This
 letter must be supplied.

     The undercurrent washed away the trestle, the only safeguard against the
 guicksands surrounding the island.

      The initials of all the nouns in the order in which they appear in the above
 sentence are U T S Q I. Arranging them in proper sequence, the result will be:
 QUITS. Supplying the missing letter, O, the name is Quoits, a well-known
 sport.

      - In' like manner, the name of a popular game, or sport, is contained in each
 of the following sentences:

     1.	The farmer had a good output of tomatoes, beats, and lettuce; but his
 onions, beside the apples he produced, were the most profitable of what he sold.

     2.	Landscapes, lighthouses, armories, and drawings of houses filled the
 book, and afforded considerable amusement.

      3.	The crow circled the edge of a thicket, soaring over the rocks, and landed
 on the crest of a little knoll.

     4.	Life in the summertime, when amusement supplants tedious lessons, is
 most enjoyable, with its appeal for bathing and boating.

     5.	Elks, skunks, otters, lions, and rabbits are some of the animals whose
 cages we visited.

     6.	Each section of the notebook contained entries of special interest at
 the time it was exposed.

     7- The foul gave the apparent losers the game.

      8.	The eyes of the listeners stared out of their sockets, as the lecturer con-
 tinued his account of the thrilling adventures depicted in ‘‘Bandits’ Trails and
 Blood.”

     9.	The song of the canary was carried across the courtyard, to the room
 occupied by the old studious ecclesiastic.

      10.	Quinine is the best remedy for a cold, although it is a widespread opin-
 ion that other things can be used to bring about the same end.

THE OPENING CHAPTERS OF A SERIAL BY

CORNELIUS SHEA

ENTITLED

THE LOST PLACER

    For years Cornelius Shea has been one of the
most popular authors of stories of adventure in
the West. Mr. Shea wrote a serial for you,
“The Kid From Bar B,” which we published
during the early summer months. At that
time you were asked if you wanted more stories
by Mr. Shea. We received a flood of replies in
answer to this question, and all of the letters spoke
most highly of Mr. Shea’s work, and requested
more of it.

   Mr. Shea says that “THE LOST PLACER”
is a far better story than “The Kid From Bar B.”
We agree with him. What do you say?
