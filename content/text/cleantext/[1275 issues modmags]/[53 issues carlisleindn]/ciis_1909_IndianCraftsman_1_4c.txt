These addresses, coming as they do from some of our most prominent public men, were received with tremen- dous enthusiasm by those who heard them. Aside from the weight they would naturally have because of the authority they represent, they contain material which is well worth preserving in permanent form. What these men said has not only a local significance, but the opinions expressed and the facts which were uncovered have a pertinent interest to the entire Service, and as here recorded will furnish for the general public authoritative statements from men who are prominent in the councils of the nation. — The Editor. THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION OF THE INDIAN. Address by Hon. F. E. Leupp, Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen: “Seeing is believing.” When I came here last year described as “ the destroyer of Carlisle,” I asked you not to believe the charge until you saw the destruction coming. The institution still seems to hold together fairly well. Equally absurd is the statement you have heard recently that the Indian has no art. I think that is the silliest attempt at misrepresentation I have ever met with in my life—it is so obviously false on its face. If the Indian is one thing more than another, he is an artist. Probably the larger part of this audience have witnessed what has been done on the chapel stage during the last few nights, in the little opera which these young people have performed. That showed what they can do both in imitation and in conception. The way they have studied out the different characterizations required in the performance of the roles in that opera, the way4 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS they sang their parts, the way the orchestra played the score, all go to refute the statement that the Indian has no art in him. You have seen on the plat- form this afternoon the old forms of weaving and the new forms of weaving. You have seen how the Indian art ideals have been transferred from the brain to the finished product. And any one who could witness such an exhibition as this today and still remain of the belief that the Indian is not a natural artist, shows that he is a good deal of a barbarian himself. There are savages in some parts of the world who think that an enormously corpulent body and blackened teeth are evidences of distinction. They would undoubtedly say that our American women, who try to keep down their weight and insist upon keeping their teeth white, have no beauty. You can usually measure the amount of civilization in persons or nations by their theories in such matters as these. When a man, simply because he is a Caucasian, begins talking about the worthlessness of Indian Art, it always makes me think of the fellow who start- ed in to boom his own town and thought that the way to do it was to decry a rival town, although it was a very good and promising one. In course of time he died and went to the place of departed spirits and knocked at the gate. St. Peter, holding both keys in his hand, came out and asked him: "What is your name?” “Jones,” was the answer. “Why,” exclaimed St. Peter, “aren’t you the man who has been trying to boom Jonesville by running down Smithville?’ “Yes.” “Well,” suggested the Saint, “ suppose you sit down here a few min- utes and wait till I can go back and break the news to Ananias.” You have seen here today another thing that was denounced the first time it was tried, yet I leave you to say how it has worked out. We were told when we started the idea of making practical demonstrations constitute the bulk of the commencement exercises, instead of the reading of polite essays on subjects of which the young people did not yet know anything, but which their elders had known so long as almost to have forgotten them—that we could not keep such a thing up because we could not make it interesting. Well, of course, the only thing for us to do under the circumstances was to prove that we knew what we were about, and Superintendent Friedman has given us two commencements which I defy any other industrial school on earth to outrival. In the few words which I shall have to say to the graduating class, I shall probably repeat parts of my former speeches, for there comes a time when you can not say over and over the same thing in quite a new way. I am reminded of the man who delivered a lecture in a certain town, and afterward applied to the lecture committee for permission to give it again. The committee held a special meeting on the subject, after which the chairman came to him and said: Our committee have concluded that they have no objection to your repeating your lecture, but they would a little rather you should repeat it in some other town. So that I fear, after 1 have said some of the old things once more, you will hope that the next time I repeat myself I will do it at some other school.THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS 5 To these young people I want to say, as I have said to their predecessors: You have not begun to know the realities of life yet. You are only on the borderland; you have not yet crossed the boundary, and it may take you some time to get well planted on the other side. But when you go out into the world I want you to remember, in connection with the enjoyment you have had in your school days, that the same great Government which has, in the generosity of its heart, given you this happy time here and this opportunity, is still in existence and deserves a litte consideration in return. Do not let your patriotism lie idle until there is a war in which you can enlist as soldiers or nurses, but begin at once among your own people to cultivate true confidence in the Government. That Government is, after all, the best friend you have now. One of these days it will go out of business as a trustee for the Indian race, and then I hope you will find just as good friends in private life as you have found in office at Washington. I can speak from positive knowledge when I say that, whenever an Indian question comes up, the President, the Secretary of the Interior, and the committees of both houses of Congress who have your interests in charge, bend their whole minds to the purpose of seeing what they can best do to promote the welfare of your people. So, when attorneys who want to squeeze something out of you, or grafters who are after your property, or the poor creatures who do not believe in the Government at all but think that everybody who holds an office must be a fair target to fire at—when these people pursue you and try to fill your minds with a lot of unpatriotic nonsense, send them about their business! Remind them of the time when President Lincoln was visited in the middle of the Civil War by a committee who came to tell him how to handle it. After listening a while he turned to the chairman and said: “Excuse me, but I receive a great deal of advice from one source or another, and I always like to ascertain something about the experience of the people who are giving it, to judge how much they know of what they are talking about. For example, my friend, will you tell me what your business is?” “Well,” said the chairman, “It will be rather hard to describe it; I suppose it consists of looking on at life and philosophizing about important matters.” “Good!” said Lincoln. "Now let me tell you what to do: You stick to your job, and leave the running of this war to the people who are charged by law with the responsibility of carrying it through!” My young friends, that will be a pretty good thing for you to say when these people get after you, and try to alarm you by making you think that the Government has some deep-laid scheme to harm your people. Half the time they won’t be able to give you a clear definition of what the Government is doing, for in a large majority of the cases they themselves do not stop to in- quire. They know as little of the actual conditions as Mrs. Maloney did when her husband fell off the roof. He was carried into the house and the doctor hastily summoned. After a thorough examination the doctor said: “Madam,6 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS I find that your husband has sustained a slight contusion of the cranium, a dis- location of the femur, and a simple fracture of the clavicle.” Soon in came the neighbors to ask the particulars and to condole with her, and found her sobbing hysterically. "Why,” they cried, "what /Vthe matter? Is it so bad with Moike as all that?” “Oh,” moaned Mrs. Maloney, "he’s loike to die—he’s loike to die! The Doctor says the Latin parts of him is all broke up!’ I was delighted to hear this afternoon the little talk given us by Miss (iates on the outing system. The outing system is one of the greatest aids to Indian education ever devised. I want to see it not only carried on in its present excel- lence, but improved upon year after year, and it can be done. At one time the idea was simply to take the children away from here and settle them among white people. That is excellent in its way. Then more care was taken about placing the children with reference to some special advantage they were to enjoy aside from the general benefits of contact with good citizens. We are now sending out boys, for instance, to work in shops where they have the opportunity of mixing with white mechanics on what we may call the dollars-and-cents basis as distinguished from the benevolent basis. When a boy goes into a regular wagon-shop or harness-shop after he has worked at his trade here at Carlisle, he learns not only what to do, but why he must do it. The most that the teachers here can do is to give such a boy a start; the real hammering-home of the lessons learned comes only when he brushes elbows with men who have got to earn their living by making goods of a superior quality. As to the girls, the original idea was simply to put them out with kind, motherly women who would take an interest in them—an excellent thing in it- self; but the outing system has become so popular and spread so widely that this school can do a great deal of choosing, and in choosing it should be very care- ful to select not only those households which are good, sympathetic and benevo- lent, but those where the domestic work is done in a thoroughly systematic and orderly manner. As was said just now on this platform, housekeeping is by no means a casual thing; it can be systematized and brought down to definite prin- ciples exactly as much as the making of steel or the weaving of wool. When you young people go out into the world I trust you will never forget or regret that you are Indians. I know that you have had a lot of stuff of the other sort prattled to you, but I hope you have improved your opportunities to wash it out of your minds. Pride of race is one of the saving graces. You were bom Indians and I want you to hold your heads right up as Indians and look every other man in the face as fearlessly as if he owed you something. Don t overlook for a minute that you were the first Americans, and that we, of what is now the dominant race, were your guests a good while before we became your guardians. While I was in Hoopa Valley, California, two years ago, I was approached by one of the Indians living there who said that he wished me to get him a pat-THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS 7 ent in fee to his land. I said to him: "Do you realize what this means—that when the land goes to you in fee it at once becomes taxable, and that you will have to pay a part of your income each year to hold that land?” "Oh yes,” he answered, "I understand that, but I want to pay taxes.” "Well,” said I, "you are the most extraordinary man I ever met; most persons are anxious, rather, to get rid of them.” "I know,” he replied, with emphasis, "but I want to pay mine. Every time I drive to town with a load of farm produce and I meet a wfhite man on the way, the white man stands still in the middle of the road with his team and 1 have to drive up on the bank to get past him, just because I am an Indian and pay no taxes. I want my half of the road!" There was not only self-respect, but good, strong, sound sense. That man wanted to assume his full responsibilities in order that he might demand his full privileges. I hope to see all of you do the same thing—not in a querulous or quarrelsome way, but in a firm, polite, considerate way. Again, having decided that you are not going to be bad people, I want you to distinguish carefully be- tween being good people and being mere cranks. Keep a cheerful spirit. Be charitable in your judgment of your fellowmen. Don’t start out with the idea that you have to carry the sins of the rest of the world on your single pair of shoulders, for that is pretty sure to prevent your looking after your own sins. Remember that the good Lord gave you a laughing apparatus, and don’t be afraid to use it. I have seen a great many persons in this world who have so far forgotten that they have one that some day I fully expect to see them send for a surgeon to have it removed, just as they would their vermiform appendix, because it no longer has any work to do and is therefore in the way. Give a wide berth to the man of sour mind and vindictive heart. Life has plenty of troubles, but it is aslo a pretty good thing, and it becomes better the better the use you make of it. Do not start in, as I have warned other classes before you, with the notion that you are going to the top at once. Take a cheerful view of life, be content to be a first-rate soldier in the ranks until you have earned your promotion to a higher place. At the close of the Civil War Colonel Higginson of Massa- chusetts went down to where they had disbanded a large part of one of the armies in the field to see what had become of the soldiers after returning to civil life. He found a number of them employed on local farms, preferring to stay there rather than go home. So he talked with one of the farmers who w as employing old soldiers on his place. “Well,” commented the farmer, “the privates are doing pretty well, but the officers vary. That man over there pitching hay is a Corporal; he does pretty well. The fellow digging potatoes yonder, who chops into one every second or third time, he was a Captain; I am not so sure about him. That man who just now broke his wagon was a Colonel—he’s careless.” “Then, my friend,” summed up Colonel Higginson, “you don’t think very highly of the officers?” “H’m,” drawled the farmer; “ I have tried Captains and8 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS Majors and Colonels, and if I should happen to get a Major General here I reckon I should have to sell the farm.” Do not, my young friends, try to be Captains and Majors and Colonels at once. Be content to stay for a reasonable time on the ground where the bulk of the people are. Work with them, rather than try to issue orders to them, until you have yourselves learned the art of living. I have just one further word to say. A year ago I supposed that I was making the last speech I should ever make at Carlisle as Commissioner; and after a very hard winter with an over-tired nervous system, I handed in my resignation on the 4th of March. It was not accepted, however, and I was made to see that my duty lay in staying on as much longer as my health would permit. I may have the pleasure of meeting you here again; but whether I do or do not, I wish for you all the best that fortune has in store for anyone a happy and useful career, with the assurance of not only living well, but dying at peace’wnh all the world. SOME SECRETS OF SUCCESS. Address by Hon. Moses E. Clapp, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. My Friends: Commissioner Leupp has well said that seeing is be- lieving”. If anyone had told me yesterday—if they could have portrayed the scenes of last evening, or the scene on this platform this afternoon,—I should not have believed it. I confess that I did not believe it was within the power and capability of children partaking largely of Indian blood to give a performance such as was rendered last evening. I want to congratulate those who partici- pated in that entertainment, and I want to congratulate the Indians as a class on their achievment, and the story of the possibilities which that achievement tells. In my Western work I give a great deal of time to school commence- ments, and, my friends, this afternoon the program was a novel one; but I want to commend it, not only for its novelty, but for its practical character. I believe it infinitely better than the usual form of commencement, consisting of orations and essays. Now, my young friends, you who are graduating, there is nothing which I could say to you that would add in example and admonition to the sum total of all you must have received from your instructors in the past. There are only a few thoughts which 1 want to emphasize. You see around here, wherever you go, a great people, who have become great because of certain charac- teristics; and the foundation of the greatness of the white man has been work. Do not be ashamed to work. Honest labor is honest and dignified in any walk of life if it is done with an honest purpose and with the inspirationTHE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS 9 of love for labor. It may astonish you, my young Indians, when I tell you that it was once my fortune to wash dishes on a Mississippi steamboat; it was once my fortune to wait on the table on the Mississippi steamboat, and as a boy on a farm to plow and to run the threshing machine. There is no occasion for being ashamed of work, and when working no occasion for being ashamed of the garb of labor. The next thing which I would impress upon you is the importance of character. For many years it fell to my lot to defend men charged with the commission of crime. Many times circumstances have woven a net-work about some unfortunate man and it seemed as though there was no skill or power of counsel and advocate that could untangle and unwind that net-work of circumstances. But in that hour when it seemed as though an innocent man must go down in the face of circumstances over which he had no control, a character could be summoned to his aid and become a shelter and a protection. You cannot over-estimate the value of character, not only as a shelter, but every effort you make in the upbuilding of character strengthens you and enables you to still further build and develop character. Then there is another thing which 1 want to emphasize. It has been said that the ruin of the red man has been his love for intemperance. Now, my young friends, you in whose veins flows the blood of the red man, 1 want to say to you that the white man has fallen a victim to intemperance just as has the red man. If I were to wish to depict all the horrors of Hell in one picture, I would conjure the image of the demon intemperance. Beware of that: "At the last it stingeth like an adder, and biteth like a serpent.” Mr. Leupp has spoken to you about your relations as citizens of this country. No matter how humble a sphere you may work in, remember that you are a part and parcel of this government Remember that in the sacrifice of the white man, in the generations and ages that are gone, it has been made possible for the humblest citizen of the republic to register his will with equal potency against the will of the most exalted and potential citizen of all this nation’s broad realm. Now, there is one other thought—and then to the students I shall close. Man must always have something that stands as the outward expression of the will and purpose of the man. Running all through the activities of human life we find the law of symbolism. If today we could lift the veil that hides in mystery the origin of pagan faith, we would find a pagan temple adorned with a pagan image as the outward expression of the faith that lay in the pagan hearts, just as our own beautiful Christian faith is illumined by parable and paraphrase; and if you could solve the mystery of the symbols of your ancestors —your tribes—you would find the same law had given birth to that symbolism. You go over this broad land of ours and you find a flag. In other lands —in every land—you find a flag, a flag that stands for something, a symbol, an10 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS inspiration, a rallying point for a people. Some of you have probably read the story of that greatest of Oriental nations—Persia. There is an interesting story as to the origin of the Persian flag. One day, descending upon a village in Western Asia, there came a barbarian horde. These simple villagers had what we might call no symbol to look to for inspiration—no flag to defend, nothing around which they could rally, and a sturdy blacksmith tore from his waist his leather apron and waved it aloft. The villagers rallied around that flag and turned back the invading hosts. We must not, in our regard for symbols, forget the necessity of the symbols maintaining the idea. In a few short centuries that leather apron gave place to the two-pronged flag of silk. 1 he sentiment for which that flag had been flung to the breeze was forgotten in the greed for pow- er and within three centuries Persia passed into history. You may have a symbol here—you may have a flag here, and I want to say to you that if you will take the Carlisle school for your flag; if you will re- member that this school teaches you a love for good; if you will remember that this school teaches you industry, teaches you honesty, teaches you to embrace opportunity, and tells you the story of a nation’s liberality, you may well take Carlisle for your flag—for your rallying point.	_ When you begin a piece of work, think of Carlisle and of all that Carlisle stands for, and do that work in a way that will reflect credit upon Carlisle. Then you may say with pride, “This is Carlisle’s work!” If you have to deal with your fellowmen, deal with them honestly, thinking of Carlisle, and think- ing that your honest, upright character reflects credit on Carlisle, that it may e said, “This is the honesty, this is the character of Carlisle. If you are tempted to do wrong, think of Carlisle and do right; and remember that in do- ing that you reflect credit on Carlisle. You create Carlisle as an inspiration to your own better, broader, and grander achievement; and in doing that you strength- en Carlisle in the estimation of the American public and bring Carlisle as an in- spiration to your own people, be they scattered where they may. If you will take this concept of Carlisle and take this thought as your rally- ing point in the years that are to come, none need ever fear for your future. Now, 1 desire to say a word which perhaps ordinarily would not be a part of the proprieties of'this occasion; namely, my own view of Carlisle. But when- ever you bear in mind that whatever the policies and purposes of the Indian Office may be, whatever the purposes and policies of the administration of (his school may be, that those purposes and policies must find their support in legis- lation; and when you realize that legislation is largely moulded by the commit- tees, and that the chairman of the committee is a great potentiary in legislation if he has the confidence of the members of the committee, it is not only im- portant but undoubtedly due to the Office and the administration of this school that my views on this question should be stated. And to be candid with you, I have not in the past believed in non-reserva-THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS 11 tion schools. As a boy, the Indian children attended the same schools with me; we sat in the same seats, we studied the same books, we played the same games; and in my own state there is scarcely a year goes by that there are not more or less children of Indian blood in our state institutions. An Indian boy graduated from a school in that state with my own son. Again, it has seemed to me in the past that as we were trying to individualize the Indian it was a great mistake to gather them together in non-reservation schools exclusively devoted to Indian pupils. But, my friends, the older a man grows the more he learns that there are two sides to every question. What 1 have seen and heard here has materially modified my views—at least, with reference to this school. I have believed for years that we should gradu- ally eliminate non-reservation schools; and one view of mine was that we should be- gin with Carlisle because it was the farthest from the reservations. I am satisfied now that this is a mistake; that while in our own state we honor and respect and associate on perfect equality with the Indians in our midst, we do not have that peculiar sympathy—and I may perhaps use the expression, that intensified sen- timent—in regard to the Indian which you have here in the East, where he is practically unknown to you only as he comes here in the character of the student. And the Indians put out under the Outing System undoubtedly receive, in the main, and on the average, more care and kindlier respect, and more instruction, and have more chance for development, than they would have put out among the people with whom their own people are largely in the relation of neighbors. My judgment is now that while we will undoubtedly eliminate non-reserva- tion schools, as the needs for these schools become less and less, that we ought to begin at the other extremity instead of beginning the process here in the East. There is one important relation in this school matter. I think Commission- er Leupp will bear me out that in all functions of government the personal equation is an important factor and nothing else enters so largely into the question of success or failure as this in dealing with this Indian problem. He may form- ulate policies, and those policies may be faultless in form, but the success of those policies depends upon the personal equation, depends upon his own at- tention and devotion to the work, and upon the attention and devotion of those who are under him, So, while 1 have modified my views somewhat as to non-reservation schools, I make that modification reservedly. But I want to say that I believe it is due to Mr. Leupp, to the management of this school, to the pupils who are old enough to understand this subject, that so far as the present personal equation is maintained the Carlisle School,—so far as I am a factor in legislation— will receive my hearty and unqualified support.12 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS INDIAN PROGRESS AS VIEWED BY AN INDIAN. Address by Hon. Chas. D. Carter, Representative to Congress from Oklahoma. Superintendent, Pupils of Carlisle, Ladies and Gentlemen:—Commissioner Leupp has just said that the Indians were the home folks of America and the white men were his guests. It seems to me if that be true that the white man the guest—has just about taken possession of his host’s household; but we are not going to fuss about that, for we have a great many things, we of the Indian blood, for which to thank the white man, and the white man has a great many things for which he should thank the Indian. I was glad to receive the invitation to the Carlisle Commencement for two reasons;—first, because I take a great interest in the education of the Indian and the upbuilding of his character; and second, because, according to the Indian notion, I am, myself, a native of Pennsylvania. Many, many years ago, during the Wyoming massacre, my greatgrand- father and his sister were captured by the Delaware or Shoshone Indians. His sister was afterwards sold back to her people for a ransom, but the boy was kept and sold to the Cherokee Indians; so that accounts for there being a Carter to- day among the Cherokees—and according to Indian tradition, I may say that my nativity may be traced to the Keystone State. After telling of the wanderings and viscisitudes of the Choctaw and Chicka- saw nations before they came to Oklahoma, Mr. Carter continued: After wandering about over the entire Western country, it was no wonder that the Choctaws and Chickasaws chose the beautiful Indian 1 erritory, w ith its richly productive soil, its remarkably equable climate, its clear, running, crys- tal waters, where, as many of them thought, they would continue to live as long as the grass gTew and the water ran. Here they established themselves and inaugurated regular codes and forms of government similar to the government in the states in which they had lived. A regular system of civilized laws was adopted by which each citizen was protected in his properties; a system of pub- lic schools somewhat similar to the white man’s public schools was also estab- lished, with the exception that in these schools everything was furnished to the child except his clothing, and in a great many schools clothing also was furnished. As the Choctaws and Chickasaws became civilized, they were quick to see the advantage of raising cotton, com, wheat, and live stock, rather than to depend upon the uncertainties of the chase and lolling in idleness around the tepees; so they invited their pale-face neighbors to come in and assist in the de- velopment of their land. rhe white man came on horseback and in wagons—prairie schooners; then he came on railroad trains, and by other modern means of transportation—and, finally, the pale-faces flocked in upon us from all sides, bringing with them theirPartial View of Gymnasium During Graduation ExercisesThe Carlisle Graduating Class, 1909Industrial Talk—Native Indian ArtThe Industrial Certificate Class—1909THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS 17 up-to-date agricultural, mining, and other machinery, their civilization, their education, and their Christianity, until, finally, the clouds of ignorance and superstition which once hovered over these people, have been almost entirely dispelled. And that same Indian of the civilized tribes stands today in a great many instances as the very highest exponent of American civilization; and, yet, there are those who speak about the unsurmountable difficulties of solving the so-called Indian problem. The recent row raised by a little handful of Creeks, assisted by a lot of white outlaws, negroes and half-breeds, has been pointed to as an example that the Indian cannot be civilized and educated.. I venture this assertion: I understand there are one-hundred men with “Crazy Snake,” and if this be true, that you can count the full-blood Indians of that uprising on the fingers of your hand. It is true that “Crazy Snake” is leading the band, but “Crazy Snake” himself is an outlaw, just the same as you have outlaws among any other class of people. The Indian race should not be held accountable, and the outlaw should not be held up as a type of Indian manhood. Why, were there ever more rapid strides of progress than have been made with the Five Civilized Tribes? Was there ever such a speedy evolution as that of transforming a primitive people from savages to Christian civilization in less than four generations? Why, my pale-face brothers,—and I don’t want to be offensive, but you boast about your Anglo-Saxon civilization—I want to say to you, sirs, that the Indian has achieved within one-hundred years what it took the egotistical Anglo-Saxon more than three-thousand years to do. Now, you must be patient with the Indian problem. The Indian must be pa- tient with workingout the Indian problem himself, for more depends upon him, even, than upon his tutors. But we should not forget that this entire great republic has been carved out of the Indian’s domain. We should not forget that there was a time when the will of the American Indian was sovereign and supreme on the American continent. There was a time when all he had to do was to rush out upon the chase and secure the necessities for his simple life; there was a time when the mighty mountains trembled, and the outstretching valleys reverberated at the august dictates of his slightest command. When his sacred rights were in- fringed upon he retreated not, nor asked for quarter, but rushed out upon the war- path and waged relentless war, just as civilized nations are wont to do today. He worshiped his Maker according to the dictates of his own conscience. He was "Monarch of all he surveyed,” and bent the knee to none save his Maker. But those venerable ancestors have long ago gone to their happy hunting grounds. The day of aimless wandering is at an end, but, at that, is not the Indian better off? Is it not better to live with some definite purpose in life? Are not the order- ly pursuits of life more to be desired, more worthy of emulation, than the law of the tooth and claw? The customs of the white man were difficult of assimilation by the Indians18 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS of several years ago; but, due to the teaching of that white man, and the training and association that we have had with him, we have been led from unfettered barbarity, and stand today beneath the fig tree of Christian civilization, girded in a sovereign armor of coveted America citizenship. To the sentimental pessimist who takes a gloomy view of the Indian, I would commend the reading of that poem of Longfellow’s—“The Psalm of Life’’—one verse of which is: “Lives of great men all remind us We can make our lives sublime. And, departing, leave behind us, Footprints on the sands of time.” Now, after all, what is success in life? Does it consist in following the dictates of our own selfish, imperial will, without regard for the rights of others— for the happiness of others? Does success in life consist of the amassing of great power or influence, either political or otherwise ? Does it consist in the accum- ulation of great wealth? the power to control the commerce of this country ? the building of a great fortune which we must eventually leave to create dissension and discord among our off-spring and relatives? No, my friends, NO! It is none of these things. Success in life depends upon the impression we leave for the good, the sublime, upon the sands of time. Each day every act. every thought, every word, is a charge or a retreat. If, in the final summing up, in the final accounting, the charges stand forthe right, for the just, for the sublime, overbalance the retreats, just then, in that proportion, has our life been successful. When we are near to the end of this earthly span, when our head is bowed with age and our hair is white with the frosts of many winters, when we have journeyed far down the eventful path of our life and the shadows are gathering about our shoulders, then if we can say our impress has been for the good and sublime, then if we have done what we could to enlighten poor, suffering humanity,—then, indeed, has our life been a success. Now, I want to say in conclusion that, on behalf of the Indian, we have ceased to hate our long-ago conquerors; the seeds of prejudice and distrust which were sown by the aggregations of the white man in the early days have been supplanted by those of gratitude, inspired by the altruistic friendship of later generations. And long after the last Indian reservation has been broken up, after the last acre of tribal land has been allotted, after the last vestige of tribal government has been obliterated, and each Indian has become a United States citizen—long after all that will the composition of American character feel the Indian’s impression. As a star of the Solar system continues to shed its light and illumine the earth for a century after its extinction, so will the genius of the Red Man con- tinue to reflect the glory of his chivalrous honor. Nations vie with each other in honor of the Indian. The child of the forest, the son of the plains, has impressed his national solidity and his peculiar morality upon those opposite forms, and it quiets and leavens the robustness of the Caucasian.THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS 19 ADDRESS BY DR. GEO. E. REED, President of Dickinson College. I am no stranger to this platform, as have been most of those who have spoken here today. I have been making speeches here every commencement for about fifteen years, and if Mr. Leupp was afraid he would repeat himself, imagine what trepidation seizes me lest I transgress in a similar way. I have only two or three minutes to speak—very fortunately for you—but I wish to say a few words as a man local to the situation. It is very pleasant to hear these gentlemen from Washington express their great admiration for the excellent charac- ter of the commencement exercises, and for the work of the school, and I do not wonder that they are profoundly impressed with what they see and hear; but we who live in Carlisle, who come in constant contact with the Indian School, and who know of its work, have occasion to be agreeably surprised with the advance we are able to see. I think this is the finest commencement I have ever witnessed since I have been in Carlisle, and that is twenty years, and I am sure that is the sentiment I heard expressed by many who were sit- ting in the vicinity of my seat. It shows the splendid progress you are making, and 1 learn a great deal every time I come out here as to the progress of the Indian. I was delighted to see a young lady, and other young ladies with her, with hair dressed ala pompadour, and of the most pronounced character, and I also noticed that these ladies were wearing the latest directoire gowns. These are the representatives of the Indian race, and I am absolutely sure that no young lady who parades around here today with a directoire gown on will ever go back to the Indian blanket. I heard one of the young ladies say that the ambition of her life was to be a neat house-keeper, and then she added,—"I wish to be economical,” and I thought what a sense of relief must pass over the minds of these Indian braves when they heard a woman absolutely state that she desired to be economical. I watched with considerable interest the process of making that bed over there. I can make beds myself. I was trained to make them up in the New England hills when I was a boy. I could not help but think of the serious contrast be- tween the beds. It was not a work of art to make up beds in the New Eng- land hills; it was a work of main strength. We didn’t have any brass bedsteads in our home either, but we had old-fashioned beds, corded up with rope, and my business was to straighten up the rope,—and it gave me many a backache to do it too,—and when we retired, it was a joy to sleep on high feather beds; and as a little boy I used to go to the other side of the room, take a run and jump into the center of that bed and go down and down. All that has changed, and you are learning all these beautiful arts of housekeeping here, and all about the economies of life, and I am sure you will put into splendid practice by and by the lessons you have here acquired.20 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS I was in Baltimore yesterday, dining at a residence in the city there, and a young lady asked me,—“Are you from Carlisle?" “Yes, I am from the metrop- olis of Pennsylvania, madam”. “Do you know the Indian school? indeed I do! I live in sight of it”. "Well, we had an Indian boy from that school down in Washington last year”, she said, using the very appropriate feminine descriptive word, "That young Indian was perfectly splendid, and we were all delighted with him”.	. And I think, Mr. Friedman, that is about the testimony we hear coming from all parts of the country, whether with reference to young men or to young women, and speaking for Carlisle, 1 wish to say wfe are all proud of the Indian school. I was delighted to hear those words from Commissioner Leupp; also to hear Senator Clapp say that he had been converted; and although his con- version as described was of a modified form, still, we hope it will become might) thorough, and that this school will stand. I would like to see the Indian school stand here as the crowning school of the entire system. I think it has demonstrated its value to the race, and its value to the country at large. I hat is our feeling here on the ground with respect to the Indian school, and 1 certainly feel that we cannot say too much in appreciation of the earnest men and women who bring about these splendid results. I have great sympathy for the men and women who engage in the splendid work of teaching. It is all very well to glorify the Indian school, but it is well also for us to remember how much the success here achieved has cost; how strenuous has been the ef- fort on the part of the teachers to bring about the results over which all rejoice. We desire and hope that the Indian will preserve his peculiarities. I "as glad to hear Commissioner Leupp state that he hoped the Indian would re- main an Indian—proud of race, proud of tradition, and proud of the blood that flows in his veins. I wish you would retain your Indian names, instead of taking up the common, ordinary names of us white people; and I wish we might have your owfn beautiful names retained as a part of your education. Hyphenated names are becoming quite popular, you know, When one of our young ladies marries today she keeps her maiden name along with her new name, and is known as "Miss Ressa Johnston-Henley,” or whatever it may be. So, "Miss Bright-eyes,” "Miss Hunt-the-Young-Man-around-the-Corner, 'Miss Rain-in-the-Face,” and so on—ah, how much better and prettier that sounds than Martha, and Jane, and Bessie, and Abigail! I suppose, however, that this changing of names is a part of the process of civilization, and so must be accepted. We want you to become good citizens of the Republic; that is what the whole school is for—to train young men and young women to become good cit- izens, and we hope every one of you will become a good citizen of the United States, and that you will be manly men and womanly women. The cry of the race is for strong and masterful men.Thk Principals in “The Captain of Plymouth”Industrial Talk—Benefit of The Outing SystemPlymouth Maidens in “The Captain of Plymouth”THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS 25 There is a little poem, which, because of the sentiment it expresses with respect to the rising generations, 1 shall recite. Give us men! Men—from every rank, Fresh and free and frank; Men of thought and reading, Men of light and leading, Men of royal breeding. Freedom’s welfare speeding; Men of faith and not of faction Men of lofty aim and action; Give us men—I say again, Give us men! Give us men! Strong and stalwart ones; Men whom lightest hope inspires, Men whom purest honor fires, Men who trample self beneath them, Men who make their country wreath them As her noble sons Worthy of their sires, Men who never shame their mothers. Men who never fail their brothers, True, however false are others; Give us men—I say again, Give us men! Give us men! Men who; when the tempest gathers Grasp the standard of their fathers, In the thickest fight. Men who strike for home and altar (Let the coward cringe and falter) God defend the right! True as truth, though lorn and lonely, Tender—as the brave are only; Men who tread where saints have trod, Men for Country, Home, and God; Give us men, I say again, again, Give us men. Men and women of this high stamp—and many of this high stamp—have been developed here, thank God, in the Carlisle school in the past thirty years of her splendid history, and the hope of your friends in Carlisle, the hope of the Government which has educated you, and the hope of your race, is that the splendid procession of vigorous, stalwart, high-souled men and women which in the past has been going out from this school may continue through- out all the coming years.26 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS TRAINING FOR CITIZENSHIP. Addreu by Hon. Carrol S. Page, member Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. 1 confess that I had very little realization of the great instruction I was to receive by coming to Carlisle. 1 should be untrue to my own ideas of duty if 1 did not say, as has been said by the Chairman of the Committee, I am surprised,— pleasantly surprised,—to see the great work which is being done at this school. I am glad I came because I know that the work I shall do upon the Indian Committee will be done with greater zest, with greater pleasure, than would have been possible had I not come. The work, I knew, was large, but I had little comprehension of what it was, but coming here and seeing what this great coun- try is doing for the Indian, I confess that it is an inspiration, and I am going back, and I hope my friend Senator Clapp will never have any complaint to make that 1 shall not be present at every meeting of that committee. Now, one word to these boys and girls. They have received inspiration, they have received good advice, and 1 want to add just a word to that. If I could have these boys and girls in my business office in Vermont I would talk to them like a father. I should like to do that now. To the graduates, and others of this school, I want to say that what 1 have to tell you will be purely practical. 1 was down in your shops this morning and I saw one of the boys laying brick. He was building a chimney down in the workshop, and as I sat there and saw him puttingone brick upon another 1 said to myself: ‘There is one of the best examples of a good honest life”. You have come here to Carlisle, and have here received the foundation. You have laid the foundation for a life that means a great deal more to you than it could possibly have ever meant had you not come to this or some other equally as good school. The great trouble is that as you go home, you may base your life plans upon a false theory, upon false premises. You may think that because you have graduated here at Carlisle the world is going to want you, to reach out and gather you into its arms, as if you were exceedingly valuable. I would not depreciate the added value that comes to you because of this experience here; it is absolutely invaluable, but, friends, as that boy laid the brick, brick by brick, remember that this life is simply the laying of little brick upon the foundation which you have here built. If I were to speak of those brick as exemplifying human life, I should say that there are several. 1 shall not name them all. I here is integrity. I do not suppose, boys, that you realize, as you will when you have passed through business life as I have, how much integrity means. 1 remember a deaf old fellow who lived in my county, who in a cam- paign at one time espoused the cause of a friend in whose integrity he had un- limited confidence. He was in a country store and heard some of those on the opposition side speak of his candidate and he thought he heard them say some-THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS 27 thing disparaging of him. He crossed over to them and inquired, “Were you speaking of Charles Brown? You mentioned that he had done some mean thing, did you not”? “Yes, we did”, they answered. “Boys, I don’t know what you said, I don’t care, but here is my money—I am willing to bet it all that it isn’t true.” Young men, when you begin the real problem of life, so live that those who know you, and know you best, are willing to say, "I will bet my bottom dollar that this story of a mean act concerning my friend is not true.” You have heard a very fine tribute paid to temperance. 1 want to say to you, as the Senator from Minnesota has said, that if there is any one thing today that is the bane of the young man it is intemperance. As you go out into life, you will find the white man coming to you and saying, “Boys, let’s have something.” You say, “No, 1 don’t drink.” "Well, have a little beer, this won’t hurt you.” Boys, J don’t know but 1 would just as soon you would drink whiskey as beer. The point is, 1 want you not to touch any kind of intoxicants, not a single drop, because that is the only line of safety that can be drawn. Then there is the idea of self-sacrifice, which I think is another brick. You will find human life a great struggle. Each is for himself, and the devil take the hindmost. The world is unkind.—is selfish, but let me speak to you as one who has had experience in life. If you are aiming for the accumulation of money you will find that an open, sincere, generous man can, and will, make more dollars than the miser and the one who is selfish. Don’t forget that. After all, this life is one of purpose. I remember being at the Twin Mountain House in New Hampshire once on a vacation, and on Sunday morning Henry Ward Beecher had the dining hall cleared out and spoke to us and his text was the answer of Christ to Nicodemus when he asked, “What shall I do to be saved.” The reply, you remember, was, "You must be born again.” I couldn't for the moment think of the treatment Henry Ward Beecher, the eloquent minister, would give to that topic, but my mind was alert, and I wanted to know what that great man had to say on this point. He treated the matter in this way: “We are all passing through life. At some point in our life we come to some grief, some misfortune, something that makes us stop and think. We look at the past and say, as most of us can, my life up to this time has been a selfish life. I have lived for myself, and have not been noble and gener- ous and kind to my neighbor. I have not done my duty to my country, but God helping me from this time forth my purpose shall be to live a changed life, to do my duty to God, my fellowmen, and my country. And whenever in our lives we reach that point where we change the motive upon which we live, we have had the second birth to which Christ referred." The thought to me is ex- ceedingly beautiful. Friends, you have come to the parting of the ways today; you have re- ceived your diplomas and are ready to go out into life. On the left hand is in-28 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS temperance, selfishness, and vice of all kinds; on the right is a desire to live a clean life on which foundation you may lay brick upon brick until you have reared slowly, patiently, a superstructure of which you will have a right to be proud. Some reference has been made to love of country. Why, to my mind, young people—carry it home with you in your hearts,—the best part of a man s religion is his politics. When I hear men and women say, as I often do, “Politics is too dirty a pool for me to play in, it has passed into corrupt hands, I will have nothing to do with it,” and then the nominations having been made, they stand on the street corners and shout loud and long about the nominations, I say to myself "that man is not a good citizen.” I care not what party you belong to, but in that party be a reformer. Go to the primaries, go whether it rains or shines, and do your duty and so far as within you lies, try to bring to the front the best man, the purest man, the man whom you think will best serve his country.	. Now, you are going to your homes, many of you. You will find there conditions that perhaps are discouraging. One by one, few by few, your fathers and brothers are being made citizens of this great land of ours. Make up your minds that if you do nothing else, you will try to do your duty ascitizens. What- ever else you read, read enough to keep posted in regard to the great events of our country. This is advice I should like to give to this vast assembly, because it is a duty that is due from all, men and women, boys and girls alike. 1 he hand that rocks the cradle rules the world, and mothers as well as fathers ought to study the great problems of the day, and they ought to advise those that do vote, if they cannot. Study the political problems of the day. I ake an interest in your country. It is a duty incumbent upon you to remember that back of Carlisle is the best country that the sun ever shone upon.

Moore THE gift of expression were his there are few who would be more competent to speak with au- thority on the Indian question than the Trader who has lived among them and made his life a part of theirs. He must of necessity come into closer relationships with the Indians, get a more intimate knowledge of the conditions surrounding them, their habits of thought and the motives from which they act, than is possible for any one coming among them for a brief spell to gather his knowledge and impres- sions direct and first hand; or, than Government officials placed among and over them for brief periods of time. Given common sense and a human interest in the things about him (and he must have these if he is a successful trader) he comes to know his people and their conditions of life as no outsider ever can, and in him too, the Indians often find their most appreciative and practical friend. The very nature of mutual relations tends to build up a confidence in, and reliance upon the trader that no Indian will ever give to a stranger, and invariably in times of trouble, his first appeal for help is made to the old time and proved out trader near him—and it is rarely made in vain. No philanthropy other than that compelled by community of interests need be claimed for the trader in this, but the effect is often more direct and practical than that of theo- rizing philanthropists who set themselves up to judge and direct Indian affairs. It is the certainty of what I know of this particular matter that leads me to pen what follows. The Indian problem is a big one and takes on a different look from almost every possible angle of view. It may well claim the best thought of able and generous minds, and all possible knowl- edge, as well as great patience and ability, will be needed in reaching its correct solution. No one man can know all that is necessary, and there is need for all men who know. I shall confine what I have to say to the Navajo tribe alone, the people I have lived among and worked with for the past fourteen years, and of whom I do know a little. The great trouble with the white race is that we come to a study of the Indian and his problems so full of our own conceits, so blinded by a sense of our own superiority, so eager to instruct and30 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS so unwilling to learn from him, that it is little wonder much effort goes for nothing in attempts to better his condition. We elaborate our plans and theories first and then try to fit the Indian to them, instead of studying him and his needs carefully in the beginning, and then trying to fit theories and plans to the conditions as they actually are. If we were more willing to learn, less prone to assume that we knew and understood his conditions, the underlying mo- tives of his conduct, his reasons for his peculiar views of life, better than he himself, we might make more headway in helping prepare him to cope with the changing conditions which confront him on every hand. This is peculiarly true to the Navajo Indian. We should re- member that he has already developed a civilization of his own and has long since passed beyond the stage of a savage; that he is im- pelled and controlled in all his relations with his fellow tribesmen by certain well defined rules of conduct evolved from past tribal experiences. These, while not all moral from our point of view— some in fact may prove exactly the reverse—are still the moral law for the Navajo and hold with the same force for him as do our moral concepts for us. In many of the things we hold as very wrong he not only sees no wrong but may, in fact, see a high degree of merit. In others that seem childish, superstitious and trivial to us, he may find for himself the unpardonable sin. So it is that often what we charge to him as perversity is in reality highly commendable if we could but see and understand from his point of view. Any scheme for the reformation and betterment of these people that does not take into account his different view point is doomed to failure and will only cause the Indian to retreat more closely within himself and further delay the time of mutual con- fidence and understanding. 1 hat there is in Navajo life much needing betterment and not a little entire eradication, is not to be denied. That there are a great many generous and well meaning people throughout the country willing and anxious to contribute to and bring about such better- ment, if an intelligent and effective way could be shown, is also true. I hat the Navajo is as ready and willing to receive and profit by such betterment is not so apparent, still he is not a hopeless prop- osition and deserves well of all his friends. It is not my purpose to suggest a “cure-all” here, for I haven’t any, but there are someTHE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS 31 conditions surrounding them, a knowledge of which, together with an acquaintance of their characteristics, is essential to any success- ful plan for their advancement. They are widely scattered over a vast expanse of country, for the most part bleak, barren and inhospitable. There are no roads other than the maze of bridle paths made in their various ramblings over the country, and no places where shelter, food and forage for horses is obtainable except at the widely scattered traders’ stores. Not communicative by nature the needs of their flocks compel them to live more apart and to themselves than they otherwise would. For like reasons they move about a great deal, changing their places of residence from three to six times a year, and are never found living in villages or communes, as do many other of the South-western tribes. It is well, perhaps, that they do not until they have learned to live a more cleanly and sanitary home life than they do at present. If a death occurs in a house they invariably abandon and destroy it, and not infrequently abandon a place on account of a sickness “hoodoo.” While on first thought this will suggest superstition, still it is not one devoid of reason when we know their habits of life, and is often the very best thing they could do. The above indicates how difficult, impossible almost, any scheme of personal teaching or instruction would be. Only the trader living and dealing with them ever comes to personally know any considerable number, and though he lives his whole life among them, even he will only know a small number of those living in his own section and the great majority will remain total strangers to him. There is little doubt there are hundreds of nearly grown up Nava- joes who have never seen a white man during their lifetime and many full grown ones whose only contact with whites would be con- fined to the personnel of a single trading store. The Government is generous and the Indian Department of it is earnestly doing all that can be done in trying to educate and civilize the growing generation. The force as a whole is composed of earnest, well meaning and conscientious people. Navajoes are a very conservative people and their women are extremely so. Every proposed change is certain of inward opposition, though from motives of policy they may seem to accept it. Their knowledge of being in the Government’s power, and their natural wish for peace, and to escape as much interference as possible, causes them to seem to ac-32 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS cept certain things with cheerfulness, but it does not lessen the bit- terness of their inward resentment one whit if they feel the inter- ference unwarranted in affairs they regard as strictly their own. Many of their younger men are quite proud and ambitious and take willingly enough to improvements in their modes of living and dress. They frequently cast aside some of their prejudices and break through some of the many “taboos” imposed upon them by the tribal lore. But the women seldom, if ever, do. 1 o them until yet, every white person is one to be hated and despised, and no good of any kind can come of being like whites in any way. They are the dominant influence in the tribe and the heaviest handicap for their people in the race for progress. 1 hey own and control much the larger part of the tribal wealth, which is in the form of sheep herds. They make all the blankets, are the family heads, contribute nearly all of the family support, and are by no means unconscious of their importance in the family and tribal economy. Realizing all this, and allowing for a conservatism amounting to dogged obstinacy, it is evident we have a force in their women opposed to any proposed change or improvement, that is not to be despised and must be broken down before any substantial gain can be made.	. The Navajoes, men and women, are born diplomats too, and to the uninitiated, give the impression of being the most tractable and agreeable of all Indians. They are really agreeable by nature, among themselves as well as with whites, but always, when their and your interests and ideas have conflicted you find that the end sought, and generally gained, has been the Navajo’s. He has a quiet per- sistence and way of winning out that compels admiration, even though it comes at your expense. Your advice and suggestions will excite no protests nor argument on his part and will have just as little influence on his actions. If he sees you do a thing however, and sees the benefit accrue from doing it that way, he will often imitate it with such modifications as may fit his circumstances. And in this readiness to imitate and apply to his own needs, it seems to me, lies the key of the whole problem for the Navajo tribe. If there were spread among them a comparatively few white homesteaders, real and bona fide home makers, I believe that within one or two generations at most, the majority of the Indians would have headquarters or home farms, and be improving and farmingA Bedouin' of the American- Desert—Navajo Squaw(Photo by permission of S.

While it will be a long while, if ever, before agriculture becomes their principal resource, a very little development along this line would vastly improve their conditions of life and render them more independent. In short, I think the Navajo can be led and worked by force of example, but he is too ready a talker himself to attach any great importance to the wordy counsels of another. Much the larger part of the reservation is a desert and totallv unfit for any but grazing purposes, but there are many small tracts of land all through the mountain sections ideally adapted to pro- ducing large yields of potatoes, wheat, oats and hay, as well as all of the more hardy vegetables. A very small area, even poorly farmed, in connection with the meat supply from his own herds, will go far toward furnishing the subsistence of any Navajo family, and the possession of a real home would lead to greater thrift in taking proper care of their property—a lesson which they need to learn. When I first came among them if we had any vegetables they had to be hauled in from Gallup. Now, and for several seasons past, all that we use, such as turnips, beets, cabbage, carrots, pars- nips, etc., are grown and sold to us by Navajo women and children. Last fall, for the first time, 1 bought all the potatoes needed for both store and house from one family of Navajo children and then could not buy all they had to sell. These are self-taught farmers—not one of them having been to school nor lived among white people. These little experiences serve to prove the possibilities of both the land and the people and are mentioned for that reason. One store can only provide a very limited market for their agricultural products, and they know nothing of building cellars and storing the stuff away for future use, nor could the latter be done un- less permanently in a certain place, or very near to it, as the other Indians would steal all they raised and stored. But if there were some thrifty white home makers among them, who would grow their own supplies, build cellars and store rooms, and live by them con- stantly, it would not be long before the Navajoes would begin doing so, and a part of the family would always be at home. These places instead of the stores would, in course of time, become the supply headquarters for the herders who are sent to the lower plain lands with the sheep herds. Once started in this way, the Navajo intelli- gence and industry would work out the rest before many generations.38 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS This suggestion, if followed, would mean the breaking up of the reservation system and the allotment of lands in severalty, and it may seem rather unusual that it should be proposed by a resident trader, one of those supposed to benefit by it and the implied Gov- ernment protection. In fact, I am not right certain that I really do advocate it, but if the Navajoes are ever to be anything but a tribe of Indian sheep herders and blanket weavers, it is time to begin leading them out of their present conditions,—and this seems to me the one way for them to be led out. It may lead myself and some others out of business, but it is the Indian, not the trader, that we are discussing here, and if twenty to twenty-five thousand people are to be benefited while less than a dozen are to be inconvenienced, the dozen have no cause for complaint. Maybe most of us have been here long enough, and some may need crowding out. If we are not big enough to stay on our own merits the above should re- sult. I will welcome the change if it works for the benefit of the Navajo people and willingly take my chances in sharing in their gain. A Navajo article with the Navajo blanket left out will seem very unusual, but this is a separate story. I might have written more entertainingly of the blankets, of the peculiar daily incidents of the life here among the Indians, or of several other different subjects connected with them, but have left that to another time. If this article is of interest and causes some one more able and better pre- pared than myself to think, its purpose will have been accomplished. An Animal Study—By an Indian.Carlisle’s Commencement Exercises COMMENCEMENT THERE is a time during the school year which, more than at any other season, is full of excitement to students and members of the faculty and illumined with an air of interest and attractiveness for the general pub- lic and the school’s friends. This is indeed true, not only of the large city schools, the high schools, grammar schools, and colleges, but is made man- ifest at the closing exercises in the small village school house to which boys and girls of all ages must troop several miles from their homes in or- der to obtain their education. Because of the tremendous interest which the public everywhere takes in the American Indian, the Commence- ment Exercises of such a national school as that at Carlisle are of interest, not only to the local community, but to men and women everywhere who are friends of the Indian. The newspapers eagerly seize upon information concerning the various events during the week and, in more or less extravagant language, detail it to the public. Thousands of visitors from the town and from this and other States visit the school at this time in order to investigate the character of its work and witness the various exercises. Nor is this seemingly uncommon in- terest unnatural when it is remember- ed that only a few decades back the Indian was a most primitive and un- tutored person, surrounded with all of the unique appurtenances and customs of his aboriginal existence. Today he is seen clothed in the raiment of his white brother, educated in an institu- tion similar in equipment and efficiency to the best industrial schools in the land, partaking naturally of the civiliz- ed modes of life, and, except for the color of his skin which covers the same red blood which flows in the veins of the Caucasian race, living about the same kind of life. This much can at least be said of the student body of the Carlisle School and it is, therefore, peculiarly apropos for thinking men and women to be in- terested in, and pleased with its ad- vancement. Aside from the general reasons for joy on the part of the students, the young men and young women at this school are particularly alive to the sit- uation, and their hearts are made glad at Commencement time. During this week there are a large number of re- unions between the ex-students and graduates and those at present in the school. Then, too, many of the pat- rons of the school, who, under the Outing System, have had our boys and girls in their homes and have there taught them much that is fundament- al in life, come to spend a week at the school, and the meetings between them and the students are full of happiness to both. T he patrons began to come in on the Saturday trains, March 27th, and here and there on the campus could be seen these residents of Pennsylvania, and other States, surrounded by boys and girls who had at some previous period partaken of their hospitality. The students, in their uniforms, made an excellent appearance. It has been remarked that the Carlisle stu- dent is characterized by a fine phy- sique, and a manly and womanly bear- ing, which no doubt is due to the re- gular training which all of our students receive in physical culture. It is always a pleasant surprise for visitors to see the beautiful campus of the Indian School. The lawns are a soft green most of the year, and during the summer months, flowers are in bloom in little beds located all over the grounds, which add a bright color delightful to the eye. I'orallof the principal events, the weather man seemed to be very gen- erous.40 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS BACCALAUREATE EXERCISES THE baccalaureate exercises were held in the school auditorium Sunday afternoon. March 28th, at 3:15. The stage presented a most beautiful appearance, having been decorated for the occasion with potted plants and cut flowers from the school greenhouse. The profusion of daisies, bougenvillas, palms, ferns, hyacinths, asparagus, begonias, cinnerarias, and calla lillies suggested a tropical garden, which was enhanced by the artistic scenery designed and painted to rep- resent the interior of an Elizabethan church. Only the older companies of students were present, the graduates occupying the front of the center tier of seats. A limited number of invi- tations were extended to the public, and although it wras a cloudy day, the seats in the gallery and the lower floor were well filled. Fhe orchestra, under the leadership of Mr. C. M. Stauffer, director of music, furnished special music and accompaniments for the occasion. It is remarkable how the instrumentation has been arranged as to leave the im- pression of having heard music direct from a church organ. Reverend A. N. Hagerty, the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Carlisle, and Superintendent Friedman assisted in the exercises. A duet.— “My Faith Looks Up To Thee’’,— by Abbot, was beautifully sung by Julia Jackson and Agnes Waite. The trio,— Hear My Prayer”,—also by Abbot, was very sweet and impressive; John White sang with the two young ladies above mentioned. Dr. Merril E. Gates, former Presi- dent of Amherst College and for some years President and now Secretary of the Board of Indian Commissioners, who delivered the baccalaureate ad- dress, had for his subject. “Words and their power in life”, and he han- led it in a most masterly way. He is an able speaker with a fine memory, and his thoughts come quickly and are given to the audience couched in sim- ple form. The address abounded in beautiful thought and brilliant epigram. It was pronounced by those who heard it one of the best sermons ever heard in this part of the country. Dr. Gates said in part: Before an audience which represents peo- ples who speak sixty or seventy languages, it seems natural to emphasize the signifi- cance and the power of words. As I was addressing this class on Commencement Day some years since, in answer to a test question, it was found that seventy-two different lan- guages were spoken by those who were pres- ent in the audience. I often think of this school as, among all the daily gatherings un- der one roof in the world, probably the place where the greatest number of spoken lan- guages is represented. We of the white race who make a study of the native American races, understand that while they are learning many things from us, we have something to learn from them. With many of the Indian tribes whom you represent, the personal name which is assumed by a young man when he passes from adolescence to manhood, has a peculiar, supreme and mystic significance. Some of you remember the spiritual experi- ence which you passed through when you went away by yourself for days, and after fasting quite alone, underwent the especial experience which led to the choice of your name. In the reverential modesty which makes the Indians of some tribes shrink from mentioning too freely the personal name of the individual, we may well see a suggestion of the importance and the sacred- ness of certain words, which have spiritual associations for certain persons. I am to speak to you of the transforming power,—of the working force of certain words. John VI.-63: “The words that I speak unto you they areaSpiritand they are Life. The Old Testament opens with a sublime emphasis upon God and God’s creative work by His Word. “In the beginning God created”—“God said, let there be Light;” and “God said—!” Time after time the creative word accomplishes the will of God. The Gospel of John purposely begins with the same words, “In the beginning,” and then identifies God Himself with the Living Word, Jesus Christ. Note then, that when spirit and life are to be given to man, words must be used inTWO VIEWS FROM THE NEZ PERCE INDIAN RESERVATION, IDAHO /’holographs by F.. K. Miller.

There is no other means ot imparting spiritual life to spirits. Certain words are spirit—arc life. They express spirit. They impart life. It is of the words of Jesus Christ that this assertion is made. It is the remarkable characteristic of His words that they are alive. They have that most convincing evi- dence of life the power to impart life to others. When the words of Christ enter in- to your life a great change takes place in you. Now you have a new life. Yours was the life of self—a selfish life. Now it is the life of God in the heart of man. The words of Jesus Christ create, impart energy to, and direct the life which men are to lead as the children of God. Words are to be reckoned with as forces. The Bible never under values words! Their vast influence upon life is always recognized in the Scriptures. Thecry, “Give us deeds, not words!” is the thoughtless utterance of people who do not see and understand that often words are the most decisive deeds! Often the mightest deed of a man’s life is the utterance of a true clear word at the critical time. The cowardly refusal to speak out, damns a man. Words have life. They run! They fly! “Words have hands and feet,” said Martin Luther. They lay hold and work! They change things! You were never so happy that a few false words could not dash your happiness. Not simply because they express the feeling of the speaker and change the feeling of the hearer; but because they carry thought, and stand for things, and represent facts; words are mighty! For words carrying and express- ing thought are the true means of interest- ing men, are the right method of controlling men, through awakened self-control. To move things in the material world force is needed; but to move men, thoughts and words are the proper instruments. For words carry thought, express spirit, and appeal to the intelligence of other spirits. Men answer to thought, to ideas, to reason; and so they answer to words which express reason, ideas and thought. “ Do not let him lay his hands on me!— Why does he not speak to me, first?” That is the voice of man, the animat nvho thinks, and can use words. He is open to reason. Words, which carry reason, are the method of control which a man asks to have used with himself, if he is to carry out the ideas and will of another. To be ruled through reason makes a man more manly. To be forced makes him a tool! Words, then, may be thought of as a spir- itual machine for making effective intellectu- al spiritual forces. How do the text-books define a machine? "A machine is any appa- ratus for transmitting force from the place where it is generated to the place where it is to do its work.” Your word then, is the spiritual machinery which you use to trans- mit the force of your thought and feeling, from your own mind where that force is gen- erated, to the place where that force is to do its work—that is, to another’s mind, where the force carried in by your word, is to com- mand attention, to awaken feeling and will- power, and so to do its appointed work in that other life. Your words fly from you to yourfriend, and your thoughtandfeelinglive in him. It is of the very essence of the hu- man mind that it can thus receive thought and feeling through words—can thus give out thought and feeling through words. A man, speaking, is thus seen to be a power. So to speak as to convince and persuade men, and thus to influence them toward right action and life, is the highest attibute of man. When you so speak to your fellow- man that he voluntarily assumes self-control, and guides himself aJong the highest lines of action, you make a man of him. The hope of our race lies In education, so general and so true that the whole mass of humanity shall be penetrated in each individual per- sonality by ideas, by words of Life, and shall so be up-lifted and sent forward. Words thus used are mighty! It is hero- ic for you, young women and young men, to be able to use aright two small words— "yes” and "no!" Many young lives have lapsed away from goodness, have gone down in the rapids and whirlpools of temptation be- cause there was not the moral courage to say "No!” at the time when it was the one thing in the world that was most needed The speaker then showed that that distrust of'words which is current in much which is said and written, is due first to the influence of men who are devoted to winning wealth by the use of physical and material means only. They wish to compel men, as they force things. They are not willing to wait, to persuade and encourage men. When such strong but harmful personalities 'uiish to use men, they wish and try to use them as tools, to compel obedience, to force action, without appeal to reason, without trying to enlighten and strengthen self-control in the persons whom they use. Such men work ruin. They spoil fine tools by harsh usage! They break down manhood! They destroy personality, the image of God in man. The second reason for speaking slighting- ly of words, is found in the fact that men too often use words deceitfully. They forget Maurice’s finephiase, “Every language has in its very existence an implied covenant to speak the truth!” Because we have so often46 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS broken our promises, because professions have so often been of the lips only, because our human wills have so often broken dowi and promises have so often been broken;— these are the reasons why words are spoken of slightingly. But when a true life speaks in a true word, what infinite rest is found in this word which can be trusted! This brings us to the great thought of our theme: It is the words of Jesus Christ which “are Spirit and Life.” “The mighty dead who die not”, still rule us from their urns.” Their written words carry a life, a spirit: an energizing force which did not depend on tone, eye, gesture or utterance, or on powerful presence or masterful manner. Their power to quicken the intellectual life and to awaken spiritual life, lies in a rarer quality in the thoughts and words,—the quality which re- mains with them when they are written, and leaps from them, ever fresh, when they are repeated or are read again. But the wonderful life-giving power of the words of Jesus Christ lies in the fact that when He spoke the ever living God was speaking through a perfect man. His words were those of the only man who has ever lived on our earth who could speak the highest truth with that utter harmony of soul which comes from having always and utterly obeyed the truth. When Christ spoke for the first time the truly divine power of words was fully felt in the Divine Word, Jesus Christ. For the first time words on the highest themes were uttered by a man whose life was in harmony with the highest law—by One in whom doctrine and deed were one. The life and the law laid down were in perfect accord. Word, will and work were one. A heavenly life came into the race with Jesus Christ and the words He uttered. A new spirit and a heavenly life were made manifest. His words are Spirit and Life, forever carrying straight to the heart of man the stimulus of God’s thoughts, the nourishment and the warm life-power of God’s love, the vital current of God’s holy will, impelling men to righteous living. For the first time words have their full meaning! The words of Jesus Christ are His very life! His life-blood and His resurrection-power are in them. The mys- terious power of the words, "Thy sins are forgiven theel” "God so loved the world that He gave His only Begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him might have Life!”—we can never fairly measure until we look back upon this life from the Larger Life beyond. It is of the very nature of the words of Jesus to reincarnate themselves in human lives. Professor William James has said, "1 he whole nervous system of man is, psycho- logically considered, but a machine for con- verting stimuli into reaction. ” The whole life-plan of each one of us is but a series of opportunities so arranged as to give to our spirits again and again the word of call and command to holy living, and to permit us, if we will, in free obedience to respond, thus transforming the holy force of the Word of God into character. You are a life in the world, that Christ’s words may get them- selves incarnated in you, and may live again in your deeds and in your life! It was when the carpenter’s Son spoke in His Nazareth home that language received its true meaning. He revealed by His words the true heavenly life. He gave a mystic power to His word of truth. Christ s word changes us. When we receive that word into our life we are transformed in character and speech, and hence in life. In the early days of our history in the border warfare between our forefathers and yours, it was said the Kentuckians declared that if they wanted a bullet to go direct to the heart and kill, they opened a vein and dipped it in their own warm blood before they fired it. The weapon of God, His Word, is powerful and sharper than a two- edged sword, because every word Christ uttered was dipped into His own precious blood.	_ To you who are to go out from this noble school soon as graduates, 1 would say: This same Christ declares to you—“1 have even called thee by thy name. ” Yourhopes for the future, your usefulness in life, will depend upon how you receive the Lord Jesus Christ and His words into your life. You make much hereof Native Art. A definition of art is this: A true thought, personal to the artist, expressed with passion- ate feeling in a material form of beauty. You will be a real artist, every one of you, if you will live the highest form of life possi- ble to live, by the help of God and the in- spiration of Christ Jesus your Saviour. At the close of the address the class sang the commencement song, which left a deep impression on the audience. The following program was rendered: Music—“Gloria In Excelsis”—School Or- chestra. Opening Sentences by the Minister—“The Lord is in His Holy Temple.”THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS 47 All sing—“Glory be to the Father.” Congregation—“I Believe In God The Father”, etc. Duet—“My faith looks up to thee” .Abbot Julia Jackson, Agnes Waite.

THE CAPTAIN OF PLYM- OUTH—A COMIC OPERA THE comic opera was given three evenings during commencement week, as follows: Monday, March 29,—for the school and faculty only. Tuesday, March 30,—for town people and guests. Wednesday, March 31,— for town people and guests. The performances took place in the auditorium on the evenings above men- tioned at 7:30. The audience from town filled the auditorium both nights when it was given for the pubic, and the au- thorities at the school had to refuse over a thousand applications for tickets on account of lack of seating capacity. The auditorium seats about a thousand. This opera has been pronounced by those who saw it the best ever given at Carlisle. It attracted a large amount of newspaper notice. The press in all of the large cities published accounts of the play, together with photographs of the players. The Philadelphia North American sent one of the members of its editorial staff to give a report of the performance, and this account is here- with given because it contains a very good description and fair appreciation of the play. Two hundred and eighty-nine years after the Pilgrim Fathers landed at Ply- mouth, the descendants of the Indians who saw them land celebrated the event in opera. Of course, it would take some stretch of the imagination to prove that they are actual descendants of the same aborigines upon whom the Pilgrims are said to have fallen after they fell on their own knees. In this respect the opera given tonight at the Carlisle Indian School was not very much different from an opera that might have been given by white amateurs, except, perhaps, that the odds of imagination are in favor of the Indians. Indeed some of the scenes in the mimic Plymouth tonight were very realistic. It was noticeable that the Indian lads and maidens who impersonated the Pequods were much more free in their interpretation of the characters than those who had to be demure Puritans. However, this must not be taken as disparaging the histrionic efforts of the Puritans. It must be remembered that the Pilgrim fathers were not a very lively lot. Indeed the actors in tonight’s lyric drama showed a remarkable understanding of the character of the Puritan imigrants who perhaps stole their fathers’ lands. The opera was "The Captain of Plym- outh.” The music is by Harry C. Eldridge, and the book by Seymour S. Tibbals. Not only was this an aboriginal production, but to a certain degree also an original one, at least it is one of the first productions in public. The story is the familiar one of Captain Miles Standish and Priscilla. The Indian production was given under the direc- tion of Claude Maxwell Stauffer, director of music at the Carlisle Indian School and lead- er of the famous Indian band that plays so ominously once a year on Franklin Field. Mr. Stauffer said tonight after the perform- ance: “I was moved to attempt this through reading an editorial in The North Ameri- can on the civilizing influence of opera. I thought if Oscar Hammerstein can spend $1,000,000 to civilize Philadephians, we could spent a few weeks for the same civilizing influence on the wards of the na- tion. And say, do you know that I believe we got the better results. “It is plain that the Indians are capable of taking up the white man’s burden, and be- fore long these aborigines will realize how superior to their peaceful tribal ways are the manners of church choira and other amateur musical organizations.” To the serious-minded observer of to- night’s performance the work of the actors was really littleshort of wonderful. It is not necessary to make allowance for the fact that the work was done entirely by children of the reservations, many of whom came to Carlisle without surnames.48 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS Indeed, in comparison with the average white amateur theatrical production, this was a very superior performance, and if there are any allowances to be made it will have to be for the white competitors. This may be explained by the fact that the white amateur is usually painfully self-conscious from a knowledge of what is required by dramatic and vocal art. These Indians without exception threw themselves into the work with a freedom that made their acting seem real. This is the first pretentious performance ever attempted at the school, and probably the first opera ever given by an Indian cast and chorus, not forgetting the orchestra of Franklin Field memories, for it was, of course, picked from the famous band that plays when Penn is licked each year. The cast was composed of the following: The Opera Cast: MUnStudbh, who is wonderfully like Cunt. ........................................

The Miles Staiulish tonight was Montre- viile Yuda. Mr. Yuda, it must be remem- bered, is not a man. He is a schoolboy. This is not offered in way of mitigation for his work. It needs none. But, as the on- ly standard of comparsion, it is well to re- member the circumstances. If there is any pampered son of civilization who, in his school days could have shown a more live- ly Captain Miles, it has not come under the notice of the present critic. Michael Balenti, the famous goal kicker, was the John Alden. Michael, like all great athletes is modest, and his natural diffidence made him a perfect Alden. His wooing of the comely Priscilla might have suggested that he felt a real affection for the handsome Indian maiden who so con- vincingly simulated the Puritan beauty. The Elder Brewster of John White was staid and dignified as the Prior of Dufranne in the "Juggler of Notre Dame,” and it is certain that Mr. Lester would say that White sang the part with tonal sonority or some other equally complimentary quality. He really did sing it with a force, volume and precision that wras a joy to hear. The Erasmus of Louis Runnels was also cleverly sung, and the comedy parts daintily carried through. But it is when one comes to a considera- tion of the work of the Indian girls that it is difficult to add the superlatives. Some- how or other it cannot be forgotten that these were aborigines, and these not only their first steps in an art foreign to their race, but what is virtually the first steps of the race in that direction.	. The name of the girl who essayed Pris- cilla is significant. It is Carlysle Green- brier. The Carlysle is in honor of the town in which the school is situated, although spelled differently. The significance lies in the fact that when this girl came from the reservation she had only one name, Green- briar,” which merely refers to the surround- ings at her advent into the world. And was she Priscilla tonight? I o the life, and again no allowances are being made for the circumstances of the performance, she was demure, pettish, coquettish and vivacious by turns. And she sang her part in a sweet, clear soprano. Then there was another Indian maiden. Her name is given on the school rolls as Emma Esanetuck. The Emma is entirely gratuitious. Her name is just Esanetuc » one being sufficient for her, as it is for every real Indian maid and every prima donna. Her part in the play is that of an Indian princess, and she looked it	. . The second act is the "Squeeze” which is Indian for piece de resistance. In this ac was the Indian ghost dance, and the Indian Lullaby” by a double sextet. A solo and sextet of Puritan maidens in the third act fairly rivalled the high spots of the secon act. The choruses were sung with spirit and melody. The dressing and lighting effects wer excellent. The audience was large and en thusiastic, and will be equally so tomorrow night, for there have been applications tor twice as many tickets as can be given out Last night the performance was given lor the pupils of the school, but this was calle only a dress rehearsal.THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS 49 GRADUATION EXERCISES AND PRESENTATION OF DIPLOMAS Anticipating difficulty in obtaining seats, those who were invited to attend the graduation exercises began coming soon after 12:00 o’clock, although the exercises were not scheduled to begin until 2:00. There was a steady stream of visitors who came in the street cars, motor cars, by carriage, and on foot. By the time the meeting was ready to begin, an immense audience had gathered in the gymnasium which,—it was estimated, —numbered Z500 persons, not in- cluding the students. Every available seat was taken, and many occupied standing room throughout the exercises. The gymnasium was plainly, but neatly, decorated by a very liberal use of the national and school colors; several hundred school banners en- twined the large trusses overhead, and hundreds of feet of the national colors formed a border which was draped around the hall. The large platform on which the exercises took place was more or less of a mystery to all, the rear part of it being arranged in the form of a section of a house, with green curtains hung between the columns, concealing the interior. The woodwork wras painted a pure white, the shingles being stained green, all of which presented a fine background for the exercises. In front of the stage, many potted plants, including ferns, daisies, palms, asparagus, hyacinths, begonias, calla lillies, and bougenvillas were placed. The marching of the students, organized as they are in troops, attracted the attention of the audience, and many remarked on the stalw'art ap- pearance of the young men and the young women, and their excellent marching. After the students were seated the Junior and the Senior classes entered, led by the color bearers with their beautiful class banners. Their presence evoked much applause from the audience and aroused the enthusi- asm of the students. The invocation was pronounced by Reverend H. B. Stock, D.D., pastor of the St. Paul’s Lutheran Church of Carlisle. His prayer was inspiring and undoubtedly filled everyone present with deeper consecration. The band then played an overture —“Schauspiel". which showed excel- lent training and a fine interpretation. Patrick Verney, an Alaskan, and a member of the graduating class, next gave a talk on printing. He spoke of the various steps in the printer’s art, and showed what could be done by a student who mastered this trade at Carlisle. While he was talking, Ste- phen Glori, a Filipino, who was ad- mitted to the school six years ago through the efforts of the Hon. Elihu Root, then Secretary of War, demon- strated the various points brought up by the speaker. He show'ed how the type was set up, put into the form, locked up, put on the press, and run off as a finished product. This talk was thoroughly practical, as it conveyed the real meaning of what was said by means of what was done. John White then sang “A Toreador's Song. John took a very prominent part in the opera, and his singing on this occassion brought forth much applause. The making of wagons and Car- riages” was the subject of the next in- dustrial talk by Charles Mitchell, an Assiniboin from Montana. He spoke of his training at the school and showed by exhibiting an unfinished vehicle, the various steps in the manu- facture of the body of a carriage. It was an excellent talk, showing care- ful preparation, and a thorough knowl- edge of the trade. I he Ciirl s Mandolin Club, under the leadership of Mr. C. M. Stauffer, who also lead the band, then delight-50 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS ed the audience by rendering the Cap- rice—“Life’s Lighter Hours.” A young woman now appeared on the stage to give a talk on “The bene- fits of the Outing System.” Simulta- neously with her appearance, the green curtains between the columns were withdrawn, revealing the interior of a complete little home. On one end was a kitchen and dining room, well furnished with a cooking range, vari- ous utensils, etc. Here a girl could be seen actually demonstrating the making of a pie. On the other end was a neatly furnished bedroom, and a young lady, dressed in the garb of a housemaid, immediately began the process of making the bed, and dur- ing the discourse dusted the furniture and arranged and put away the week’s washing, which she obtained from the kitchen. In the center, between these tw'o rooms, was a sitting room; this was equipped with a lounge, etc., and decorated with Indian rugs. A young lady was sewing at a sewing-machine, and later she proceeded to cut and fit a waist. Josephine Gates, a Sioux from North Dakota, told of her early life at home, her training at the school, and the excellent training of the outing system which fitted her for practical housekeeping. As she proceeded, she pointed out the various steps, and while she was talking, the panorama above described added a realistic touch to the entire number. This was one of the best numbers on the program, and certainly demonstrated that practical commencements, illustrating the actual work of the school, were not only feasible, but were a source of enjoy- ment and interest as well as real in- struction for the general public. At the end of this number there was again a transformation scene, the curtains were drawn together and quickly the entire front of the stage was arranged with native Indian art decorations. Two looms with rugs in the course of being woven were placed on either side, and on the railing and on the floor, the crafts of the native Indian were arranged. There wras the old weaving of the Navajo and Hopi, and products from our own In- dian Art Department, showing the application of Indian design to the Persian weave; pottery and baskets were also tastefully arranged on the stage. Elmira Jerome, a Chippewa from North Dakota, then gave a talk on “Indian Art.” She spoke of the various native Indian arts, describing their origin, present processes and ex- pressed a feeling that the art of the primitive Americans would be retained and developed. While Miss Jerome was speaking, a Hopi boy was dem- onstrating the present method of weaving in vogue in Arizona, and at the same time, a young lady w*as dem- onstrating the weaving according to the Persian method applied with In- dian design, and a Normal pupil was weaving a Hopi basket. This dem- onstration ended the students part on the program, and it was very in- teresting, indeed. The speakers then took seats on the platform, and were introduced by Superintendent Friedman. ^Commissioner Leupp again honored the school with his presence and de- livered a very stirring address, which wras brimful of sound advice for t e Indian students and showed a most intimate knowledge of the life an needs of the Indian people. He also delivered to each member of the graduating class their diploma. I |s address, together with others, is published in the body of the magazine. Carlisle was fortunate in having present at the Commencement Lxer cises, Hon. Moses E. Clappt ° Minnesota, Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, and t e Hon. Carroll E. Page, Senator from Vermont, who is also a member of t he Indian Committee. Representative Charles D. Carter, of Oklahoma, him-THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS 51 self an Indian, and Dr. George E. Reed, President of Dickinson College, were the other speakers. Mr. Leupp, the Senators, and Mr. Carter, came the day before and made a thorough examination of the work of the school, going into all of the various de- partments. The address by Senator Clapp wras considered a masterpiece by the audi- ence, and it brought forth tremendous applause, not only because of the excel- lent advice given to the students, but because of the statement that, from wha t he had heard and seen here at the school, he was firmly convinced that the abolishment of nonreservation schools should begin somewhere else, and that this school should stand and be the last to go. The addresses all contained sound admonition to the students and infor- mation for the public, and presented an array of eloquence and national authority that had a deep and lasting effect on every one present. At the close the audience joined in singing “America”, after which the benediction was pronounced by Rever- end Alexander McMillan, pastor of the Episcopal church of Carlisle. Thus ended one of the most eventful commencements in the history of the Carlisle School. INSPECTION OF THE SCHOOL BY VISITORS THE time set apart for the inspec- tion of the industrial and academ- ic departments by the general public was from 8:30 to 11:00 A. M., on Wednesday, March 31st, and from 8:00 to 10:30 A. M. on Thursday, April 1st. Large numbers of people from Carlisle and other towns availed them- selves of this excellent opportunity of visiting the school and getting into thorough touch with its work. Added interest was given to this pub- lic exhibition because of the crusade which is now going on for the establish- ment of industrial schools and for the introduction of hand-training for both boys and girls in the public schools. This movement is national in its scope, and has been accelerated by the cam- paign now carried on by several soci- eties especially formed for the promo- tion of industrial education. The bor- ough of Carlisle is now very much interested in this subject because of a fund of $139,000.00 which has been made available through the death of a former citizen I mportant changes and i m provements were found by those who had visited the school before. The work in the academic department has been devel- oped and improved by the addition of a common-sense course in agriculture in especially provided rooms, a thorough course in business practice (not steno- graphy) established for all of the students in the school, a special course in sten- ography, typewriting, and bookkeeping fora very limited number of especially fitted students, and a well developed course in native Indian art. The new printing office was a sur- prise to all who saw its excellent equip- ment and the work which is there be- ing done. The work in the large shop building, which is now one of the very best equipped and arranged of its kind in the United States, illustrated to the public the practical side of education for the Indian and gave an insight into the character of the work which the Indian apprentices are capable of doing. I'here was not only an exhibition of the finished product, but the visitors were given a chance of seeing the pupils actually at work. This feature of the general com- mencement exercises was undoubtedly the source of much instruction for the general public. The Carlisle School is now' in a position to offer to Indian young men and young women who have profited by the education which52 THE INDIAN CRAFTSMAN—BY INDIANS can be obtained in reservation day and boarding schools, a finishing course in both academic and industrial branches, such as is offered in very few schools in the United States, either public or private. The various departments have been placed upon a basis whereby real in- struction is given and the courses which have been outlined are thorough and comprehensive. Those who came were convinced that the problem of adapt- ing education to the needs of the com- mon people has been solved, and that such an education is valuable to those also, who eventually take up university training and enter one of the learned professions. HANDICAP TRACK MEET Although this meet was scheduled to take place on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 30th, it was delayed until next day on account of the weather conditions; there was no rain, but a very cold wind was blowing which it was thought would not be conducive to the best results. This handicap meet was the first of its kind held in the history of the school, but on account of the great success attending it, it has been decided to make of it an annual event. A large number of outside visitorsen- joyed the meet, as did M r. Leupp, Com- missioner of Indian Affairs, who was present for the exercises. 1 he students had been earnestly training for several weeks previously, and much enthusiasm had been aroused. Very fine gold watches were given as first prizes, and the other prizes consist- ed of gold fobs, links and scarf pins.

RECEPTION TO GRADUATES AND RETURNED STUDENTS ON Thursday evening, April 1st. a reception was given to the gra ates and returned students by Superintendent and Mrs. Vne 1 A large number of young people gathered together and throug i°u evening were in high spirits.

The young people present, as well as the other older folks who graduated from the school years ago, had the pleasure of listening to the interesting and varied experiences and sound advice of these two distinguished men. Refreshments w»ere served later in the evening and close onto the midnight hour, after an evening of thorough en- joyment, the happy party said “Adieu.” ALUMNI BANQUET THE Annual Alumni Reception was held in the gymnasium on the evening of April 2nd. The room was tastefully decorated with the school colors—red and gold—and potted plants and cut flowers. The music W'as furnished by the Germania Orchestra of Carlisle. About one hundred and fifty guests enjoyed the hospitality of the Alumni Association. Dancing was a feature of the evening’s entertainment. The Y. M. C. A. Hall, where a delicious and bountiful supper was served later in the evening, was beautifully decorated with the col- ors of the Class of 1909—orange and white. After supper, Mr. S. J. Non, the chairman, in well chosen words, wel- comed the 1909 Class into the Associ- tion. Michael Balenti, president of the incoming class, responded. Other members of the Association, i. e., Wallace Denny, ’06, Spencer Williams, ’05, Frank Mt. Pleasant, ’04, and Joseph Libby, ’07, were called upon to speak, and responded heartily w'ith greetings and kindly words of advice to those who will soon leave their alma mater to enter the rank and file of the world’s workers. Guy Cooley, a member of the 1909 Class who is now holding a position in the Office of Indian Affairs, also spoke to his fellow students concerning the benefits which he has received from Carlisle. The program closed with an address by Superintendent Fried- man to the Alumni Association in general and the Class of 1909 in par- ticular.

JOHNSON, Carlisle ’04 I watched the brooklet rushing down To meet the frothing sea; It sparkled as it dashed along, Its life was melody. I took a stone from out its path, That it might flow released; But lo! it danced no more in glee— Its melody had ceased. “Almighty God”, my soul cried out, “I see thy perfect plan; For as a brooklet in its path, Thou hast made life for man. The trials from Thy guiding hand, Whose aim we may not see, Are but the music of our lives, Thine is the melody!” Thin hrmlrr »M d«l*n«J hr an Indian—a Student of tho Carlisle Nativn Indian Art Dewirtment.(fiarlislf Untiiftn Hnirostrial §rl)ooI ifl.

The War Department donated for the School’s work the Carlisle Barracks, composed of 27 acres of land, stables, officers’ quarters and commodious barracks build- ings.
