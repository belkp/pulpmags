lake pearled Where lions lurk and thrash and crowd Like lands that battle for the world Behold one lion leaps for his prey Trotting like a saffron mist As savage nations in our day Pounce on some weak antagonist  Across the jungle painted grass His roar breaks through the tropic air And he runs like a tawny flame Swift yellow stroke of lightning there His cry is like the thunder s sound Shaking leaf and bough and bole   And he is part of Africa The yellow monarch in her soul  Painted birds fly through the trees And stain the sky with brown on blue Hammering with their wings the breeze Hitting songs across the dew Parrots gaudy as a star Tap their bells and chatter sound Each insect sweeps his dim guitar Like music hidden in the ground  The tawny lion goes like a shot A daub of gold against the green  Scenting a wounded bleeding doe That he is following unseen A spangled serpent lights a tree  A coiling flame around it curled But the old lion goes great and free The master of his jungle world  Bravely born and bravely bred Proud as a diamond of his fire This yellow monarch of the south Goes like the hosts that swarmed to Tyre Hungry to kill he scents the air And roars into beginning night His blond mane tossing up its hair His eyes two pools of blazing light   Edwin Curran  He stops and lips the evening gale Reading the wind across the trees Giant cat in his tawny mail Spelling out the trail warm breeze Then on he darts as though with wings To find his prey and drink the blood And feast upon the harmless things That God has put into the wood  A gorilla slouches through the bush A leopard s eyes shoot stars of light The deep luxuriant forest hush Hides serpents beetle colored bright The crane nods sleeping spindle shanked Gray monkeys troop and clack and peer A jungle stream goes emerald banked Purring like a wild cat near  The cinnamon colored land awakes Around the lion fold on fold Yellowing with fruit blue with lakes Stuck with fireflies burnished gold Gray monkeys watch the lion and talk Lassoing trees with leather tails Some far palms by the seaside walk And near by sing the nightingales  The moon hangs like a petal of gold Broken upon the western sky   The blue dusk deepens fold on fold The shattered day lies down to die Here in this wild primeval place Savage wooded poisonous still Far from mankind and human face The old lion goes to hunt and kill  His prey is near the scent is strong  He roars out in his ghastly mirth There bleeding like a shattered song His wounded doe is run to earth  But as he leaps to take its throat A younger lion leaps up and cries And there the two lions stand like stone The fires of ages in their eyes  It took the centuries to make These lions sun colored bodies bright These great teethed felines from the brake Tawny crouching cruel as night Their eyes turn red these cats of brown Swift as wind lithe as air Savage maned and monarch crowned With blazing eyes and yellow hair  The painted snake makes not a sound The frightened birds shake in the tree Like two great russet clouds they bound These monarchs for the mastery   Edwin Curran  The teak tree groans the gum is still The coffee tree nods to the duel An elephant calf stares from a hill A lizard watches from a pool  White silver moon an eye of snow Looks from the dusk with beauty hung Her pale lids open and aglow Where starry ladders are far flung The lions steel sinews knot in cords There is a crash of yellow forms The zebu and chimpanzee run The jungle with the battle storms  A roar that rocks the ground is heard And monkeys chatter parrots flee The coiled snake and the gaudy bird Slink from their everlasting tree The colors of the painted land All disappear as quick as light The great palms tremble and the hand Of God draws over all the night  The dotted turtles hunt the ground Now rocking with the battling pair The night birds startled make no sound The vultures scent the bloody air Hyenas wait to eat the dead And pick the polished bones and wail   A python crawls with silken tread On silver plates of sliding mail  The wild things of the jungle know A battle of the kings is on The zebras cry the tree cats yell The tall giraffe has swiftly flown The spiders hang on polished webs Greenish discs of jeweled light A frog is croaking in his well The fireflies shower through the night  The two huge cats are at their duel Two yellow whirlwinds hard as stones Snapping biting wild and cruel Tearing flesh and crunching bones Jaws upraised and crashing shut Lifting sinking slashing there Paws like razors slitting skin Teeth like knives of white that tear  The painted flowers drip with blood The hiding snake is crushed below The lizard stamps into the ground The trees shake as when whirlwinds blow The monkeys swing away and run The wildcat looks and leaps away The leopard spotted with the sun Slides by into the mist of gray   Edwin Curran  The poisonous flies have scented blood And elephants have come to peer Ant eaters look into the wood To see the battle of the year The scorpion squirms into the view And things unspeakable to see Speared and horned and crusted blue The toad and reptile infantry  The jungle sees the battle rage Intense ferocious swift and fast A terrible and an awful sight So horrible toward the last The lions have cowed the very night And stunned the shadows and the trees A scuffle like the break of worlds The shattering of centuries  But the old lion shows greater skill With harder blows and mastery His teeth were longer trained to kill  His strength upholds his majesty Yet the young lion is quick and strong So wiry lithe he seems to float He worries the old lion for long Till the old lion leaps at his throat  They wave in battle spinning round Together snarling thundering bright   Thrashing through the dry dead grass Until the day has turned to night And left the young lion dead and still In ribbons mangled on the sod His broken body cold and chill The old lion still his lord and god  The old master of the forest stands With one paw on the fallen breast The monarch of the jungle lands Whose victory challenges the best A king is dead long live the king He roars his eyes like coals aglow He calls his mate a lioness there To come and feast and eat the doe  He calls his lady through the night And she replies and comes to him Where the dead doe lies still and white To banquet in the shadows dim Like nations when the war is done Who gather at the feasting board To dine upon the hard won prey Each like a monarch and a lord  The snake slips back into his tree The monkeys chatter now in peace And over the blue woods there falls The age old night of centuries   Edwin Curran  The fireflies hang their lanterns back To star the dark the beetles bell The lizards creep and nightbirds sing The snail is dancing in his shell  The yellow floods are still and quiet The sky is blue like trembling glass Beasts birds and toads and insects riot Beneath the stars in jungle grass After the battle night alone Moon mist ghostly poison flowers Trumpeting of beasts that moan Through creeping crawling crimson hours  A shaky moon rocks in the night A grumbling sea far palms the crash Of monkeys chattering as they fight Gray serpents going like a flash Slow turtles swifter bats on wing Worms creeping back and spiders flies Lizards with poisonous following And fanged things in their paradise  Slimy silken bellies squirming Offal scented beasts of prey Hungry lethal toads and reptiles Who move by night and hide by day Tearing flesh of birds that nest Rending bones that drip with blood   So the jackals strike and quest In the world s jungle brotherhood  But must these creepers in their turn Be conquered in the coming light As new hope rises on the world And the old lions go with the night Yet who can tell what signs of death Await the nations one by one Ah what will happen in earth s dark night Before the rising of the sun  Edwin Curran   THE JILT  Let other feet go drudging About the house he built A free girl a jilted girl I m glad he was a jilt  We quarrelled till it almost Destroyed my breath of life He nagged me and bullied me As if I d been his wife  II  We grew cold and bitter The more we would explain And if we held our tongues The worse it was again  He flashed a cruel sign I flashed a cruel word And neither could forget The blame the other heard  III  But his eyes could be tender with love and his voice how tender Some words he sang are with me the whole day through   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I hang out the linen and burnish the brass and copper And they won t go out of my head whatever I do  Strange how they come when I feel alone and forsaken How they wake me up when the dawn in my room is hazy How they drug me asleep when the night has darkened my pillow Ah a song will sing in your head when your heart is crazy  IV  What can I do but sit here and shake And let the windows rattle mournfully While Sunday brings him never and Monday brings him not And winter hides the town away from me  Dreaming how he drew my soul from my lips Seeming just to hear forevermore What my heart tells the clock what the clock tells my heart Dreaming back the springtime at my door  V  Why should I curl my hair for him He said the trouble couldn t be mended He said it must be good by and go And he took up his hat and all was ended   Agnes Lee  So all was over And I m not dead And I ve shed all the tears I m going to shed  And now he s wanting to come again Perhaps he s sorry perhaps he misses The hill top girl Well let him come  But no more love and no more kisses Whatever the future gay or grim Why should I curl my hair for him  VI  I shall go out in the sun today I don t know whether to laugh or pray For along the waking paths of spring Bird calls to bird till the branches ring  Something stirs me spring s own will To wander to the edge of the hill Where I can see as I look down Patches of green on the gray old town  THE BLUNTED AGE  The old man sips his broth and reads his paper before the fire His daughters whisper at a window One of them holds a letter  First Daughter  I dread his knowing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Second Daughter  She was his favorite sister Older than he and very far away Think of it no one with her at the last Better delay the telling such a sorrow   First Daughter  Ah you remember how he loved our mother And yet last summer after she had died He never seemed to take it hard at all He seemed too much resigned too much himself It would have killed him twenty years ago  Second Daughter  It is the age they come to Something goes out Goes mercifully out I often think They learn to take death as they take their broth Their daily walk their game of solitaire  First Daughter  And you and I sister Already youth Slips far and far behind us Shall we too   Second Daughter Tearfully  How can you say it How can you say it Oh  First Daughter  Here comes old Nurse Lucretia up the street Heavy with her dull robes and hurrying To be the first to bear the word to him  Second Daughter  Sign to her wave her away wave her away He has seen her close so many dead eyes Agnes Lee  First Daughter No She has passed along she was not coming in  Second Daughter  Hush he may hear First Daughter His mind is on his paper Second Daughter  Make some good reason take the paper from him Before he reads the names Who knows but hers Might be already there First Daughter It is too late His finger finds the column The Old Man Calling Here See here Why Adelaide is dead My sister Adelaide  Daughters  O father father The Old Man I suppose it s true First Daughter  A letter came Now read it deary read it  The Old Man  No let it wait So Adelaide is dead Well she was restless go and go she must First to this place then that place till at last She settled in Nevada As for me Here I am still and I shall count my hundred Well well well well so Adelaide is dead  Agnes Lee   FROM THE DAY BOOK OF A FORGOTTEN PRINCE  My father is happy or we should be poor His gateway is wide and the folk of the moor Come singing so gaily right up to the door  We live in a castle that s dingy and old The casements are broken the corridors cold The larder is empty the cook is a scold  But father can dance and his singing is loud From meadow and highway there s always a crowd That gathers to hear him and this makes him proud  He roars out a song in a voice that is sweet Of grandeur that s gone rare viands to eat And treasure that used to be laid at his feet  He picks up his robe faded wrinkled and torn Though banded in ermine moth eaten and worn And held at the throat by a twisted old thorn  He leaps in the air with a rickety grace And a kingly old smile illumines his face While he fondles his beard and stares off into space  The villagers laugh then look quickly away And some of them kneel in the orchard to pray I often hear whispers The old king is fey   Jean Starr Untermeyer  But after they re gone we shall find if you please White loaves and a pigeon and honey and cheese And wine that we drink while I sit on his knees  And while he sups he will feed me and tell Of Mother whom men used to call The Gazelle And of glorious times before the curse fell  And then he will fall half asleep to the floor The rafters will echo his quivering snore I go to find cook through the slack oaken door  My father is happy or we should be poor His gateway is wide and the folk of the moor Come singing so gaily right up to the door  Jean Starr Untermeyer  A FILLET OF THORN  Tell me how can I sing Who have not tasted pain Who having grieved an hour Laugh and am glad again  It will take a winter of frost Aching and storm filled years Before I am lord of life Before I am king of tears  Anita Grannis   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE WAGES OF SIN  God the Inscrutable  Looked on complacently  The while young Denison  Slipped all his debts by careful insolvency  Broke his wife s heart and ruined the serving girl  But Lobster Salad and Iced Watermelon  That was too much for even a godhead  I ll smite him for that quoth God the Inscrutable  And the wretch died in torment  At two in the morning Jessica Nelson North  FOG  The sea is a meadow pale meadow of silence Where flowers are blooming white flowers of sound And deep in the petals the pale listless

Whisper and crackle  I lean at Alcobaca dim With fig leaves twisted round its rim Pauses a slim Tall maid Her name A Latin hymn  Gloria da Madre de Deus A white rose face dipped tremulous A profile carved as nobly clear As love child of Aurelius  White clad barefoot and straight she stood Vase bearing nymph ripe to be wooed In some delicious interlude  What need now to remember more The tiled

Wilkinson  Outside the stillness and white glare Of Alcobaca s noonday square My hands that dare The beauty of her loosened hair  White shift white door the white still street Her lips her arms her throat her feet After a while the bread and meat  A dewy jar of cool red wine Olives that glisten wet with brine White rose of Alcobaca mine We kiss again above the wine  The red wine drunk the broken crust We parted as all lovers must Madre in gloria be thou just To that frail glory A white rose fallen into dust  Florence Wilkinson   THE PASSERS BY  THE PARADE  Faces laughing and torch lit Passing

retreating  Gone There remains but the heat Of the August night wind Blowing a leaf down the street  TO THE HILLS AROUND NORTHAMPTON  Little New England hills How tenderly You gather in this bit of world To comfort me Encircling all I love As I would do Had arms the reach of heart Small hills of blue   Dorothy Butts  If having grown to be More tall than you I shall be forced to see The farther

account the leafing trees Dead leaves in autumn What were these Were there no poet s heart to please  Of you and me what can be said  Who are not are and then are dead  Without a poet overhead   LISTENING  Into the night I sent my call For you and hung my head When there was no reply  Tonight the singing sky Is calling me instead Cry upon ringing cry Although I do not hear your voice My head

take my love and do not hesitate You think that I shall always wait I am so calm It is to reassure and to inspire New confidence in you Quick take my love before it is too late  Here are my hands held

so shall I  In opposite directions ply  Our irresistible two ways  Into the nights into the days  The east and west shall draw apart  Like magnets your heart from my heart   How vain our tears now we have seen That east and west have common lures You were my magnet I was yours With all the world between  PLEASE  Give me the old familiar things Though they be very plain The quaint old tune Joanna sings The small house in a lane Whose fragrance meets the open door The faded carpet on the floor The patient peace of furniture Familiar things I can endure  I have been brave a long long while Heard praise and scorning afterward I have met eyes that did not smile And now I ask for my reward I know the panoramic strand Of happiness and grief s sequence Rough grains have scratched my venturous hand I beg no tribute nor defence I only ask familiar things The quaint old tune Joanna sings  Dorothy Butts   POEMS  GARGOYLES OF NOTRE DAME  I watch them shuttle and weave and run Like dust before a scolding wind Boats on the water Leaves on the bank And men on the streets and square Leaves and snow and leaves again And men Boats to the sea Leaves to the wind Men to gibbet and wheel To thrones To bed To Père Lachaise Muddy tracks in the snow And blood on the wheel And rotting leaves on the tiles The wind and rain will sweep them away As a soft curled plume might sweep Flecks from a silken gown  Shuttle and weave and run Boats to the sea Leaves to the wind And men to Père Lachaise   EDGES  Edges are more beautiful than anything Edges Where the quiet deep shallows into loveliness Where the clouds feather to wavering silver And color kisses its brighter self  Life is most whitely light Where its low edge Melts in the still pool of death As the sky rim sinks In a moon filled sea  LULLABY  Tears for your pink curled hands They must strain to hold The smoke thin garments of a dream  Tears for your still eyes They must be pierced By the keen blades of beauty  Tears for your flower feet They must bloom like first spring On wintry plains  Tears tears for your eyes And pink curled hands And blossom feet tears   Henry Bellamann  PEAKS  Quiet faces  That look in faith  On distance I will come to you And gaze upon that peace  I cannot tell  If it be wind you see  Across the summer grain  Or the shaken agony  Of driven seas  GOD  I often spend week ends in heaven  And so I know him well  Most times he is too busy thinking things  To talk  But then I like his still aloofness  And superior ease  I can t imagine him in armor or in uniform  Or blowing like a windy Caesar  Across the fields of Europe  Or snooping in my mind  To find what I am thinking  Or being jealous of the darling idols  I have made  If ever that slim word aristocrat   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Belonged to anyone it is to God You should see him steadying the wings Of great thoughts starting out On flight Very like a scientist trying a machine Patrician cool in a colored coat Rather like a mandarin s Silver sandals quite a picture I can t see him Fluttering in wrathful haste Or dancing like a fool  I don t go there often Only when I m at my best I save up things Pictures of the sea wild with white foam Stories of engines beating through the clouds News of earth in storm and sun Some new songs the best  He s fond of being entertained With what I choose to tell him of myself Very kind about tomorrow Indifferent of yesterday  He s like that God in his heaven alone I know for I made him put him there Myself   Henry Bellamann  THE ARTIST  What would you do  If you had ear and brain attuned superbly  To all the iridescent humming birds of faint  And delicate overtones  That play like spirit flames  Above the music  Suppose your eyes could see  What mine see when a little wind passes  And all the garden is suddenly barred and starred  With flying color  Suppose the tilting planes of dogwood bloom In the green spring mist of young leaves Caught your breath as though a hand  Held your throat  Or that the red haw veiling herself in May Kept you awake at nights Remembering her bridal look  Oh suppose this world of nuances  Opal soft and frail and swift  Were for you a reality more hard  Than things you call reality  And you lived always among the deaf and blind  What would you do Henry Bellamann  COMMENT  FROM QUEEN ANNE TO GEORGE THE FIFTH  HE death of Austin Dobson early in September compelled us all to turn and count the milestones Was it possible that he had lived till yesterday this artist in triolets lived to bridge over with his trim little silver silken foot path the depth on depth and height on height of wild and thunder echoing change which lie between his time his mood and ours Was it possible that a poet who reached backward even from Victoria to light his little candle at the wax taper of Queen Anne that such an one could have lived through impressionists and futurists through fin de siecle lassitude and Celtic revolt through imagists vers libristes aeroplanes submarines Russian revolutions and the world war lived unperturbed in his eighteenth century garden a loyal citizen of an extinct world  However in the seventies and eighties Austin Dobson was a new movement Swinburne had been showing what might be done with English rhythmics now Dobson only three years younger would open a fresh chapter by following the footsteps of Théodore de Banville in adapting to modern uses the old French forms of those fifteenth century rhymers Marot and Villon His art was of a neatness a nicety and all the circumstances of his life encouraged and developed its precision its good mannerly grace A comfortable little government office   From Queen Anne to George the Fifth  with three fourths of his salary continuing on retirement at sixty a comfortable pension of two hundred and fifty pounds for his services to literature a comfortable home and family and troops of friends and a comfortable by gone period to retire into out of this troublesome modern world Too comfortable perhaps apparently a bit enervating for his books of verse and prose all antedate his retirement from office at the turn of the century Through the last twenty eventful years this poet has had little to say  A master miniaturist perhaps not quite because his eighteenth century portraits ballads dialogues are scarcely the real thing after all any more than the period rooms which our master decorators create today They were done with zest but not with the eighteenth century faith their fragile artificiality lacks the true DuBarry bloom A master of vers de société possibly again not quite because the master even in that genre always makes you believe or at least suspect that he is really in love or in joy or in grief in some wistful corner of his gay but battered heart whereas Dobson merely plays with pretended emotions he is always frankly in costume And as is the way with masqueraders he usually makes too many bows and gestures he slightly over acts the role  The poems in French forms also the ballades villa nelles rondeaux though done with superlative deftness remain literary exercises   Always in costume did I say Before Sedan is a poem of simplicity and sincerity with no superfluous words to mar the sad little story And in this briefer poem The Cradle there is a quietly restrained feeling  How steadfastly she d worked at it How lovingly had dressed With all her would be mother s wit That little rosy nest  How longingly she d hung on it It sometimes seemed she said There lay beneath its coverlet A little sleeping head  He came at last the tiny guest Ere bleak December fled That rosy nest he never pressed Her coffin was his bed  In the best of the gayer poems also one may find a hint of feeling a kind of artistic sincerity as in an idyl by Boucher or Fragonard that is behind the shepherdess symbol is a certain wistfulness of dream We all remember The Ladies of St James here is the first of its seven  stanzas The ladies of St James s Go swinging to the play Their footmen run before them With a Stand by Clear the way But Phyllida my Phyllida She takes her buckled shoon When we go out a courting Beneath the harvest moon  This poem seems to me Dobson s high water mark I   From Queen Anne to George the Fifth  cannot find any other in his two volumes of quite so fine a quality The Ballad of Beau Brocade Une Marquise and some of the Proverbs in Porcelain are as lightly touched off but their artificiality is less skilfully disguised  It is interesting to note how many of the muse s gayer fashions of the last half century were set by Dobson First the old French forms which soon became a fever a mania until every magazine poet in two continents was writing rondels and villanelles a trick easily learned and tiresome unless turned off with the rarest grace Then the library fashion of bookish poems including the Horation fashion of light winged tributes imitations or free translations in the manner of the Augustan bard fashions so effectively followed in Chicago by Eugene Field and B L T of happy memory and still pursued often afar off by every colyumist in the land Indeed most of the journalist poets would confess that they had gone to school to Dobson and that on the whole the discipline had been salutary  The name of another venerable English poet leaps to one s mind by way of contrast a poet also born in 1840 and now still sturdy in his eighty second year Thomas Hardy s mind from youth to age has looked forward never back He lit his torch at truth s camp fire and he has carried it ablaze toward the new age no abyss or peak of change could find him unready or afraid  Hardy in his youth a man of our time or beyond Dobson in his old age a contemporary of Pope and Gay   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  was there ever a sharper sting of difference The difference between a great soul and a little one between a seer and an entertainer However each in his own way has been true to his vision One may grant to each the epitaph Dobson begged for himself  Saying He held his pen in trust To Art not serving shame or lust  But one must grant to Hardy also some more heroic line H M  REVIEWS  DRINKWATER AS POET AND PLAYWRIGHT  Pawns four one act plays by John Drinkwater Hough  ton Mifflin Co Mary Stuart by John Drinkwater Houghton Mifflin Co Poems by John Drinkwater Houghton Mifflin Co  Does Mr Drinkwater poet use his prose material for his plays Is it not the duty of a poet to continue being a poet in the theatre Mr Drinkwater should suspend business temporarily take an inventory and separate his art material from his merchandise Strong speeches prompted by fearless thinking project themselves through the mass of his work but they are in great danger of being engulfed in heavy waves of conventional mediocrity Indeed the proportion of poor stuff is so great that one becomes prejudiced against the whole unless one reads carefully   Drinkwater as Poet and Playwright  In Pawns a volume of one act plays The Storm demands some consideration because of its theme and a small section of its dialogue It is reminiscent of Synge s Riders to the Sea and of course it suffers by comparison However in this bit of the opening dialogue he has caught the quality and rhythm of the Irishman and it leads one to believe that Mr Drinkwater could write if he would orientate himself  Alice I have prayed these hours and now I m tired of it He is caught in some grip of the rock and crying out And crying and crying and none can hear him cry Because of this great beastliness of noise  Sarah Past crying now I think  Joan There take no heed Of what she says it s a rusty mind she has Being old and wizened with bad luck on the hills  But he fails to sustain this simplicity of speech and the  atmosphere of the storm or to develop the tragic theme  with power The speeches drag out archaically The  Stranger one of the characters states  I was a dream A cold monotony suddenly thrust Into a waking world of lusty change A wizened death elected from the waste To strive and mate with eager lords of tumult Beauty was winged about me darkling speed Took pressure of earth and smote against my face I rode upon the front of heroic hours  And through the remainder of the volume Mr Drinkwater does not attempt to pull himself out of archaism In the other plays he adds rhyme which doesn t help any   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The title The God of Quiet sounds like Lord Dunsany and it is possible that Lord Dunsany might have disguised the triteness of the theme The theme the return to quiet to peace after war the futility of war the ineffectual result of fighting the planting of revenge which instigates the eternal round of war peace war must antagonize the artist Weak propaganda for peace is a just cause for inciting belligerency and this play is full of it  Old Beggar It is the quiet mind that keeps  The tumults of the world in poise  Soldier It is the angry soul that sleeps  Where the world s folly is and noise  King For anger blunts us and destroys  Citizen We are little men to be so proud  Young Beggar We are fools what was so long to build  We break  With the padding and piling of long speeches on the same theme one feels that Mr Drinkwater should have followed the trail of his King  You god of quiet some day shall men have spent  All the wild humorous blood of argument  A Night of the Trojan War is a tragic episode and a good theme but one is reminded of a better handling of it by Henri Barbusse in one of his short stories Cophetua the last play in the volume must have been written in the author s salad days  If one may continue to suggest other authors for the handling of Mr Drinkwater s ideas James Joyce would   Drinkwater as Poet and Playwright  be a good bet to develop the theme in Mary Stuart Not that Mr Drinkwater is incapable of handling it the following speeches lead one to believe in him If such speeches could grip him and control him to the end of a play we should have something to reckon with  Mary My love is crazed a turbulence without direction It was made to move in long deep assonance I who should be love may but burn and burn with the love that I am not  Mary Darnley Riccio Bothwell there s a theme for a great heart to play And there s so much to do I have talent as rare as any in Europe It should be my broad road that and my love And I cannot use it for my love is beaten up like dust blinding me To be troubled always in desires that s to be cursed not wanton Little frustrations and it should be the wide and ample movement of life  Certain speeches have the depth and sweep of drama they have the flesh and blood of drama but they should be incorporated in another play  The prologue is in modern dialogue but without distinction and it does not insinuate itself into the dream The dream is lugged in on a dray It fails to win you with its spell because there is no magic The modern characters in the prologue argue a theme old in point of time but modern because it has yet to be developed and established As if afraid of its modernity these characters thrust it back into an old story with conventional manners dialogue and wit Whereas the vitality of the theme could break old molds and precipitate itself without apology into a great free modern expression  The play ends with the voices coming back out of the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  dream This is handled effectively it has the glamour of hallucination but Mary s spirit s answer to Hunter s real question breaks the spell It would be more dramatic and in better taste to let the play end with Hunter s My God What s that and leave Mary s answer to the imagination of the audience  We seem to be passing through the phase of sightless thought in the theatre the gathering of material from history from industrial psychological or sociological problems and making copybook sketches of life instead of evoking the unseen through the magic of art Because the art theatres are endeavoring to reserve the theatre for works of the imagination they are branded high brow As a matter of truth the recorders of facts the chroniclers of the literal are the high brows the remote ones As Mr Drinkwater says in his poem History feeling beauty fancy  Such are the things remain Quietly and forever in the brain And the things that they choose for history making pass  The book of poems opens with Reciprocity which commends itself to the reader s good nature It is pleasing and springs from feeling The poem History beckons with so pleasant a smile and is really so charming that one trips gaily over the trite poems which follow until one receives a nasty bump in Reverie After reading  And only beautiful can be Because of beauty is in me   Drinkwater as Poet and Playwright  it is hard to press on But if one is to be a critic one must have the unflinching endurance of M Jules Lemaitre What if I were perchance doing my part in killing a masterpiece  The book of poems has many pages We have a large group in the folk song manner two sonnets we swing into their familiar melody with indifference a group of love poems tempered with pastoral coolness songs fashioned circumspectly without unchaperoned passions  The long poem The Fires of God goes the way of too many long poems limping strutting and striding Seven league boots would compass the same journey in a few powerful steps However the ambling in Travel Talk is pleasant and restful as ambling in relaxed moods always is And The Carver in Stone another too long poem has beauty and an insinuating subtlety in its development The Building is full of nice suggestions and significant repetitions which give heft to its balance and harmony  Mr Drinkwater in both his plays and his poems has many moments of clear thinking but when he summons his naked truth and meets it face to face one feels that he is inadequate However some of his thought digs so deep and has such power that one hopes sincerely that his prayer will be answered  Give us to build above the deep intent The deed  Laura Sherry   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  OF DREAMS AND STITCHES  Curtains by Hazel Hall John Lane Co  Comes Hazel Hall with her little book every word and emotion of which is poignantly authentic The usual first book of verse is conglomerate and leaves its reader with the confused sense of having listened outside the tower of Babel But this is the crystallization of a personality one emerges from it as though one had sat opposite the woman sewing in her little room plying her needle or stopping to thread it and talking in a voice at once sad and indomitable  Her judgment of the world is keen and impartial She knows it by its footfalls The step tells more than the chiselled expressionless face  They pass so close the people on the street Philosophy comes in through the open window Inevitably Only one sound drifts up to me The blend of every tread in one Impersonal as the beat of the sea  Often the poet s strength suggests itself even more in rhythm than in word as in the three lines quoted above and again  The beat of life is wearing me  To an incomplete oblivion  Yet not to the certain dignity  Of death  In Curtains which is Part I of the little book a certain wistfulness pervades something compounded half of sad   Of Breams and Stitches  ness and half of hope She is never bitter even from  Defeat she wrenches power  Time s soft fingers gently close Over my outstretched hand and in Their certain touch I feel repose  In Part II Needlework her touch is even surer even more deft I know nothing more definitely and delicately of woman than this handful of pages  Every poem in the little volume is quotable We have selected The Long Day one of the less familiar for beauty of form as well as for its representativeness  I am sewing out my sorrow Like a thread wearing it thin It will be old and frayed tomorrow  Needle turn out needle turn in  Sorrow s thread is a long thread  Needle one stitch needle two  And sorrow s thread is a strong thread But I will wear it through  Then not only will sorrow Be old and thin and frayed But I shall have tomorrow Something sorrow has made  There is something in these poems as personal as the warm and vibrantly sympathetic touch of a hand The poet has given of herself with generosity and she leaves one with the sense of being near and intimate More as a confidant than as some strange reader one listens with wonder to her fragile fancies so musically given forth and weeps at her isolation Pearl Andelson  CORRESPONDENCE  POET AND COMPOSER AS ALLIES  Dear Miss Monroe As a writer of both music and verse your discussion of Poetry and the Allied Arts in the October issue of your magazine has an especial interest for me  You quote Mr Case as to the difficulty of arranging a program of American songs possessing sufficient variety of mood and treatment I believe one reason for this in the case of the individual composer is that a publisher becomes accustomed to a certain style from a certain musician and when the musician changes his idiom the publisher waggles a disapproving head It is difficult to break away from old patterns and be received as the weaver of new and often one s best work is a long time finding itself in print  One of the reasons operating against poet and musician combining more freely is the scant recognition even obliteration often accorded the poet member of the partnership I am moved to a comment not pleasant to ake concerning as it does my own kinsmen Observation has forced the conclusion that many musicians are a somewhat insular folk or should one say indifferent Surely not ignorant at any rate something that begins with I They are apt to have a kind of unilateral art sense a squint view as it were at creative expression a proneness to feel not only that music s the thing but the whole thing It is a not uncommon experience to see the   Poet and Composer as Allies  text of a long work printed in a program headed by the name of the artist who has set it to music the poet s name appearing not at all Time and again song poems are anonymously printed singly and in groups in the original or in translation and the reader is left to infer if he give it a thought that the words had jes growed There is small doubt that the verse yoked to music is often one may say usually of negligible inspiration but if it be given the dignity of program printing certainly the authorship should be acknowledged I look forward to the time when the poet in his association with music will be considered worthy of his hire be that hire nothing more than recognition of authorship to the time when all programs shall print between the title of a song and the name of its composer the bracketed name of the poet and when all music critics not merely the distinguished few know something of the fellow arts as well as of music  Music publishers have done much to accent the value of the text by giving it separate printing in song publications William Arms Fisher a composer of songs and the editor of an eastern music house takes the broad view that in a song the words are of chief import  The creative publisher of sweeping vision and the will to dramatize those visions can do much toward bringing together poet and musician and all allied artists My collaboration with Henry Hadley in the writing of an oratorio Resurgam to which you referred was originally due to the initiative of Mr Fisher He asked me for the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  text for a cantata and following his usual method of presenting his wishes infectiously and with a large measure of faith launched the undertaking almost coincidentally with the reading of the letter When the text was finished he invited Mr Hadley to make the music Thus was a happy unity established music poetry opportunity for certainly the editor or publisher stands for opportunity After the production of the cantata and one other piece Mr Hadley wrote proposing that we do an oratorio together He said he had always wished to express in music the sombre passing of mortal life and the glory of immortality Upon completion of the text I urged him to make suggestions and while he was at work on the third section he asked for the interpolation of a contrasting mood Certainly the text was improved by the suggested addition I was kept in touch with the music from time to time being told for what voices in solo chorus etc the various parts of the poem were scored  There is no question in my mind that co labor between artists increases the joy which should be the well spring and not a by product of art creation  Louise Ayres Garnett  REACTIONARY COMPOSERS  Dear Editor It has occurred to me many times and with even greater force since reading your Comment in October s POETRY that the present unalliance in America   Reactionary Composers  between modern poetry and modern music is primarily due to the complacency of the reactionaries of the musical world By this I mean not only the reactionaries among the composers and critics but those in the audiences themselves who insist consciously or unconsciously that our operatic song and orchestral compositions should remain more than a little antiquated scented with lavender while the contemporary arts are keeping pace with the complexities of civilization  I am aware that the thought which must be uppermost in the convictions of the conservative minded person is that a torrent has swept into modern art literature poetry sculpture and even into the drama something a little ribald lacking in dignity and beauty as he has known it And it is perfectly proper doubtless for those who are so inclined to hold back a bit before plunging into the swirl of this new movement There is of course always the possibility that each apparent step forward is in reality merely a mood which has taken possession of the reasoning faculties among the free spirits of the generation and which will prove in time to be just a slight stumble possibly in the right direction occurring before the next legitimate step of progress is finally achieved  On the other hand it is quite as true that unless there is a tendency in the arts to reflect the spirit of the age unless they are vividly interpretive it is evident that they are without constructive value   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  From this hypothesis let X equal progress plus logical development and behold we have those who would solve the problem Sherwood Anderson is the forerunner of one group Amy Lowell of another then there are the followers of Picasso and Brancusi of Maurice Browne and countless others Whether or not they gain a foothold is as much our concern as theirs for they are ourselves our explanation the story which the future generations shall read of us And meanwhile music stands like a Boston bas bleu her skirt a little shortened because of the influence of Korsakov and Dvorak but still wearing her New England rubbers  This perhaps is the explanation of the answer I have so often received in talking with American song writers I have asked them why they do not set such and such a poem to music and the inevitable answer is given to me It isn t adaptable Adaptable to what Certainly not adaptable to the music of fifty or twenty five years ago no even not adaptable to the song music that we loved last year It must be something so splendidly new that modern music will be able to touch the outstretched hand of modern poetry Kay Boyle  Note by the editor A word of encouragement comes to us from an enthusiast who has worked for years toward a closer alliance between American poetry and music Eleanor Everest Freer a Chicago composer who has used effectively many fine modern poems as the text for songs Mrs Freer has urged especially that operas and concert numbers should be sung in the English language and has inaugurated the Opera in our language Foundation to that end  ANNOUNCEMENT OF AWARDS  For the ninth time the editors and advisory committee of POETRY face the agreeable but difficult duty of awarding our annual prizes Nine years ago prizes in this art were practically unheard of in America although many annual prizes and scholarships in painting sculpture architecture and music had been liberally endowed in perpetuity awards now ranging in value from one hundred dollars to two thousand or more even to the richest of all the three year scholarship of the American Academy in Rome which carries studio board and lodging and a liberal income  From the beginning we have believed in such awards as both a stimulus to artists and a kind of advertisement to the public and have argued that they are as well deserved and as effective for these purposes in poetry as in the other arts We rejoice that the tide is beginning to turn and hope that it may prove strong and high The Dial s announcement of an annual purse of two thousand dollars to be given to some one of its contributors is not aimed at poets exclusively but poets at least have a chance at it and the five hundred dollars with which the Poetry Society of America has of late annually crowned some book of American verse has an air of permanency although not yet permanently endowed  In his letter Concerning Awards in our September number Mr Aldis asked the following question which   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the editor promised to answer or at least discuss in  November  Could you devise and suggest some plan by which prizes would not be awarded for an individual poem but based on broader considerations of personal production and talent youth and need  In reply we would suggest that magazine editors and other publishers of verse are usually so well informed as to the talent youth and need of their younger contributors that they would have no difficulty in awarding on that basis as many scholarships or encouragement prizes as they might be entrusted with Every year POETRY has observed this rule in awarding its young poet s prize always wishing it had eight or ten such prizes instead of one wherewith to aid a little with honor and money a few young poets on their stern and rockbound path  The difficulty is not here it lies not in making the award but in getting the money for it And patrons of the arts are not wholly to blame for omitting poets from such annual endowments because this art has as yet few permanent institutions to which people of wealth might give or bequeath such a fund in trust The Poetry Society of America would accept such a trust with joy but it is too strongly localized in New York and too academic in its present tendencies to inspire strong hope of its exercising a progressive influence Still less confidence could be felt in the National Institute of Arts and Letters or its sacred inner circle the Academy whose leadership is so   Announcement of Awards  hopelessly old fashioned that it has not yet recognized the fellowship of women in the modern arts  POETRY of course would rejoice to become the dispenser or initiator of such a fund and would engage to satisfy any possible donor as to its disposition both during and after the continuance of the magazine Some trust company of repute should be custodian the interest to be paid annually by direction of the committee of award In choosing this committee the first rule should be that none but poets poets of recognized standing and authority should be eligible and second this committee of poets should be instructed that the original and experimental work is to be honored rather than the conservative and assured  The first committee of award might be chosen by the editor and donor aided by such expert advice as they might call in This committee say of three or possibly five poet members to be chosen from widely separated localities should be self perpetuating but under a time restriction that is every three or five years one member should drop out on the election of a new one  Such a committee of award would not derive from POETRY and the possible discontinuance of the magazine would not interrupt it in the least However if the donor should happen to like POETRY and wish to endorse its policy its editor might become ex officio a member of the committee  Another method of selecting a committee of award was   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  suggested by a lawyer of my acquaintance Let the presidents of three widely separated institutions say the Universities of California and Illinois and the Poetry Society of America or Harvard the University of Chicago and the Poetry Society of South Carolina or any other representative three let such a group of colleges or societies be requested each year by the custodian of the fund the trust company to appoint each a member of the committee of awards such committee member to be a poet of high repute one not a member of their faculty or board of officers And let this committee bestow the award  Either of these methods would seem to promise as much progressiveness and fluidity and freedom from local prejudice as any artistic endowment in perpetuity can be It would be for the donor to decide whether his gift or bequest should be used for scholarships that is student awards to young poets or for awards of honor so to speak to poets who have done high service in the art If the award should be generously large the honor would become correspondingly conspicuous and this fact would be a strong influence toward the worthy disposal of it as in the case of the Nobel Prize  We strongly hope that some man or woman of sufficient wealth may be moved to follow this suggestion someone who would like to turn out of the beaten paths with his gift or bequest and do something original and constructive and inspiring   Announcement of Awards  With this rather long preliminary we now proceed to award POETRY S three prizes for poems printed in its pages during its ninth year October 1920 to September 1921 As usual poems by members of the jury are withdrawn from competition in this case That Year by Marion Strobel a group of seven poems in the February number and Eunice Tietjens translations from the French of Antonin Proust of Modern Greek Popular Songs printed in November of last year Indeed no translations are considered for prizes  We are enabled once more through the liberality of Mrs Edgar Speyer of New York to award the young poet s prize which for the past four years has been given as a mark of distinction and encouragement to the young poet comparatively unknown as yet who in the opinion of the jury most deserves and needs the stimulus of such an award  Hoping that our contributors and readers will grant to the members of the jury honesty of judgment and will not demand infallibility we now announce the awards  The HELEN HAIRE LEVINSON PRIZE of two hundred dollars for a poem or group of poems by a citizen of the United States is awarded to  LEW SARETT  of Evanston Illinois for his poem The Box of God published

The Greatest Poet of Contemporary Europe  is the judgment of the French critic Eugene Clement regarding Kostes Palamas As the latter has written only in the modern Greek his work has been slow to reach English readers but since the publication of Life Immovable in 1919 and of A Hundred Voices last spring the majority of critics in America and England have endorsed the high praise accorded the poems on the Continent The translator Dr A E Phoutrides has provided critical and biographical introductions which do much to increase the reader s appreciation Although the two volumes form a continuous whole their virtual independence is indicated by difference in binding and typography The price of Life Immovable is 2 00 of A Hundred Voices 2 50  This volume Life Immovable is doubtless the best English version of a modern Greek poet and will prove of surprising interest Classical Journal  Palamas is a true artist with an eye for all the beauties of Nature and a sense of the mystery and wonder of human life London Quarterly Review  This book A Hundred Voices is a thesaurus of passionate beauty and hymns by a man who is a Pantheist one who utters the Everlasting Yea of Nietzsche to Nature and all her works In the original Greek his poems ought to be a priceless and immortal treasure The translation of Mr Phoutrides is as perfect a thing as can be done It is a work of love and
