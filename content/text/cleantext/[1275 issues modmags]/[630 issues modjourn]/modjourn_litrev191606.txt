and hands before the time during which we will know him he was a doctorand drove a jaded white horse from house to house through the streets of WinesburgOhioLater he married a girl who had moneyShe had been left a large fertile farm when her father diedThe girl was quiettalland darkand to many people she seemed very beautifulEveryone in Winesburg wondered why she married the doctorWithin a year after the marriage she died knuckles of the doctor s hands were extraordinarily largeWhen the hands were closed they looked like clusters of unpainted wooden balls as large as walnuts fastened together by steel rodsHe smoked a cob pipeand after his wife s death sat all day in his empty office close by a window that was covered with cobwebsHe never Opened the windowOnceon a hot day in Augusthe tried but found it stuck fastand after that he forgot all about it had forgotten the old manbut in Doctor Reefy there were the seeds of somethingAlone in his musty office in the Heffner blockabove the Paris Dry Goods Company s storehe worked ceaselesslybuilding up something that he himself destroyedLittle pyramids of truth he erected and after erecting knocked them down again that he might have the truths to erect other pyramids Reefy was a tall man who had worn one suit of clothes for ten yearsIt was frayed at the sleeves and little holes had appeared at the knees and elbowsIn the office he wore also a linen duster with huge pockets into which he continually stuffed scraps of paperAfter some weeks the scraps of paper became little hard round balls and when the pockets were filled with these he dumped them out upon the floorFor ten years he had but one friendanother old man named John Spaniardwho owned a tree nurserySometimes in a playful mood old Doctor Reefy took from his pockets a handful of the paper balls and threw them at the nurseryman That is to confound youyou blithering old sentimentalist he criedshaking with laughter story of Doctor Reefy and of his

knarledtwisted apples and filling his pockets with themOnly the few know the sweetness of the twisted apples girl and Doctor Reefy began their courtship on a summer afternoonHe was forty five then and already he had begun the practice of filling his pockets with the scraps of paper that became hard balls and were thrown awayThe habit had been formed as he sat in his buggy behind the jaded gray horse and went slowly along country roadsOn the papers were written thoughtsends of thoughtsbeginnings of thoughtsby one the mind of Doctor Reefy had made the thoughtsOut of many of them he formed a truth that rose gigantic in his mindThe truth clouded the worldIt became terrible and then faded away and the little thoughts began again tall dark girl came to see Doctor Reefy because she was going to have a child and had become frightenedShe was in that condition because of a series of circumstances also curious death of her father and mother and the rich acres of land that had come down to her had set a train of suitors on her heelsFor two years she saw suitors almost every eveningWith the exception of two they were all alikeThey talked to her of passion and there was a strained eager quality in their voices and in their eyes when they looked at herThe two who were different were much unlike the othersOne of thema slender young man with white handsthe son of a jeweler in Winesburgtalked continually of virginityWhen he was with her he was never off the subjectThe othera black haired boy with large earssaid nothing at allbut always managed to get her into the darkness where he began to kiss her a time the tall dark girl thought she would marry the jeweler s sonFor hours she sat in silence listening as he talkedand then she began to be afraid of somethingBeneath his talk of virginity she began to think there was a lust greater than in all of the othersAt times it seemed to her that as he talked he was holding her body in his handsShe imagined him turning it slowly about in the white hands and staring at itAt night she dreamed that he had bitten into her body and that his jaws were drippingShe had the dream three timesthen she became pregnant by the one who said nothing at allbut whoLittle Review 9 the moment of his passion actually did bite her shoulder so that for days the marks of his teeth showed the tall dark girl came to know Doctor Reefy it seemed to her that she never wanted to leave him againShe went into his office in the morning and without her saying anything he seemed to knowyhat had happened to her the office of the doctor there was a womanthe wife of the man who kept the bookstore in WinesburgLike all old fashioned country practitioners Doctor Reefy pulled teethand the woman who waited held a handerchief to her teeth and groanedHer husband was with her and when the tooth was taken out they both screamed and blood ran down on the woman s white dressThe tall dark girl did not pay any attentionWhen the woman and the man had gone the doctor smiled I will take you driving into the country with me he said several weeks the tall dark girl and the doctor were together almost every dayThe condition that had brought her to him passed in an illnessbut she was like one who has discovered the sweetness of the twisted apples and could not again get her mind fixed again upon the round perfect fruit that is eaten in the apartmentsIn the fall after the beginning of her acquaintanceship with him she married Doctor Reefy and in the following spring she diedDuring the winter he read to her all the odds and ends of thoughts he had scribbled on the bits of paperAfter he had read them he laughed and stuffed them away in his pockets to become round hard ballsThe Little Reviewof the Killing of Liars HUNThands have

saw when you entered his school in Cullenswood House was a fresco representing the boy Cuchullain taking armsThe Druid has warned him that the youth who takes arms that day will make his name famousbut will have a short lifeAnd written round the frescoin the old Irish wordswas Cuchullain s answer I care not if my life have only the span of a day and a night if my deeds be spoken of by the men of Ireland This was the spirit that Padraic Pearse sought to kindle in his boys this was the spirit that he tried to bring back again into Ireland MacDonagh strove to create an Ireland that would be free as his intelligence was freeas eager for deeds as he himself was eagerThose who knew MacDonagh in his literary expression thought of him as a poet with a tendency towards abstractionsas a scholar with a bent towards philologyThose who knew him intimately knew him as a man who was the best of comradesAnd they knew that there was something in MacDonagh that he never expressedWhat was fundamental in him was an eager search for the thing to which he could give the whole devotion of his lifeHe found it in his vision of the Irish RepublicMary Plunkett strove to bring back the spirit and the defiance of the martyrsHe came of a family whose name has been in Irish history for six hundred yearsThe proudest memory of his people was the memory of martyrdomThe last priest martyred in

adequate explanation principle tenets of Imagismie clear presentationthe abolishing of outworn phrases and extra adjectivesthe necessity of rhythm in all poetrythe absence of reflective commentare those common to most of the modern serious writers of verse and although the Imagists have done well to lay fresh emphasis on the difficulty and desirability of putting these tenets into practicethis hardly constitutes a new schoolAs for a definite understanding of the term ImagismGod help the man who thinks he can explain to another its meaning Imagistsall six of themthere were more in the first anthologybut seemingly some fell from grace write poetryThat they choose to employ a sub title need not concern us nor does their exposition of certain theoretical idealsWhat does concern us is the

doKindly make an effort to understand One may question the desirability of any prefacebut it is not surprising that the Imagists wish to make clear their aims and purposesOne wonders at the breath expended in attacks on themThere are disadvantages in this banding together if one of the group makes a misstep the whole six are anathematized butafter allit is quite futilethis effort to kill by

seven poems by him can compare with his Choricos in the Anthology of 1915That is an achievement not easily repeated Little Review 29 HDis the purest Imagist of the groupTo the uninitiated she is the most obscure because the most abstractShe loves the sea and highwindy places and her poems catch something of the freshness one feels standing on a headlandbeaten and buffeted by the wind and the salt sprayNature is to her as a living presencesometimes gentlemore often cruelShe vibrates to beauty as sensitively as a Greek dryadand in reading her poems one has a curious sense of a worshipper offering incense to the godsHere are some lines from the last one of the four poems she contributesIt is called Temple The Cliffand no hill goat Tramples no mountain sheep Has set foot on your fine

have agreed by nowI trustthat is not our first considerationNo less a person than Miss Lowell herself gives us justification in this viewpointfor in a review of the poems of Aldington and Flint in the June Poetry Review she says Let us take these little volumes as poetry pure and simpleforgetting schools and creeds are thirty two poems in all in the bookOne person will like this one bestanother thatSuffice that the book is a valuable contribution to contemporary literature The Little Review Imagist Poets GOULD FLETCHER from tli c May issuepass from the poetry of MrAldington to the poetry of HDis to pass into another worldFor HDnot only is a modern poetshe is in the best sense of the word a primitive poetShe deals with Greek themes in the same way as the Greeks of the seventh century BCmight have dealt with themShe is not like MrAldingtona sceptic enamoured of their lost beautyIn a sense she is indifferent to beautySomething speaks to her in every rockwaveor pine tree of those sunlit landscapes in which she seems to liveFor her the decadence of antiquitythe Middle Agesthe modern world seem never to have existedShe is purely and frankly pagan is it that so many people interested in Imagism seem never to have grasped this essential distinction between her work and MrAldington sI must suppose it is because very few people have ever tried to analyze and rank the Imagist poets on any other basis than that of formBut as I have already pointed outthe form of the Imagists isafter alla matter of lesser importance than the spirit with which they approach that formAldington writes about lifeHDis almost completely a nature poetNature to her is not mere inanimatescenery or beautiful decorationit is packed with a life and significance which is beyond our individual livesand all her poems are in a sense acts of worship towards itCivilization for her does not existin our modern senseshe seeks a civilization based only on the complete realization of natural and physical lawwithout any ethical problems except the need of merging and compounding all one s desires and emotions in that lawHer poetry is like a series of hymns of some forgotten and primitive religionlike to think that this primitive quality in HDs poetry comes from the fact that she is an AmericanThere can be no doubt that we are an uncultivateda barbarous peopleOur ancestorsby migrating to an immense and utterly undeveloped continentwithout traditionswere thrown face to face with nature and lostin consequencenearly all feel Little Review 33 for their previous cultureIf you

return to natureBut insteadwe were ashamed of our barbarismand we have striven and are still striving to outdo Europe on its own groundswith the result that so much of our art seems merely transplantedexoticand falseWe might have been the Russians of the western hemisphereinstead of that we were almost the provincial EnglishInstead of Fenimore Cooper and The Song of Hiawathawe might have given to the world a new national epicBut the opportunity is now lost and whatever fragments of that epic may be written will have to be very sophisticated and in a sense artificial products make an end of this long digressionI can truly say that I find nothing transplanted in HDs poetryShe has borrowed a few names of gods from the early Greekbut that was because she found herself in complete sympathy with this peoplewhoif we are to believe the modern school of archaeologywere quite as barbarian themselves in the Homeric period as the Red Indiansand who lived in the closest contact with

three directionsas it comes in from the seaThe scenery and the feeling are not GreekIn factas someone has pointed outthe whole poem might have been calledThe Coast of New Jersey But just as Coleridge found a way to give a feeling of the emptiness of the sea by narrating the tale of a legendary voyage on itso HDhas given us the eternal quality of the New Jersey coast by identifying its savagery with Greek mythdifference between HDs poetry and Aldington s is therefore a difference between an apparent complexity which cannot be analysedsince it is really the simplest synthesis of primitive feelingand a studied simplicity which on analysisreveals itself as something very complex and modernAldington s work when studied carefullyraises questions about our lifeHDgoes deeper and offers us an

horrorhideousness to stamp beautyour hearts third poet whose work I have to examineMrFSFlintwas already an accomplished writer of rhymed vers libre before he joined the Imagist movementMrFlint s early work is contained in a volume entitledIn the Net of the Starsa volume which is still worth readingThe Net of the Stars told a love story in rather uncommon fashionThe poet and his beloved were presented throughout the bookagainst the background of the starry skyknots in the net of light is held by the infinite DragonNight bringing into relation of a quite human love storywith the impassive and changeless order of the Universethrew a flavour of supreme irony over the whole bookThe work is otherwise remarkableLittle Review 38 At the date when it was published1909MrFlint already revealed that he was an assiduous student of VerhaerenDe Regnierand other French vers libristsHence its importance as a document in the Imagist movementto come to MrFlint s later work which has been assembled under the title of CadencesWe find here a poetfirst of allof sentimentWhatyou sayan Imagist who deals with sentimentMy reply to that isthat it is time people understood that an Imagist is free to deal with whatever he choosesso long as he is sincere and honest about itMrFlint s sincerity is his finest pointHe is in some sense the Paul Verlaine of the Imagist movementHis work gives one the same delicacy of nuancethe samefresh fragrancethe same direct simplicitythe same brooding melancholyHe lacks the strain of coarseness which ruined Verlainehe hasin place of ita refined nobilityHe has not humourAt times he has attempted ironybut I cannot think he has altogether succeeded in itHe feels life too poignantly to ever mock at lifeThere remains tendernesswistful pathosimaginative beauty reading MrFlint one obtains a very distinct impression of MrFlint s personalityOne pictures him as a shysensitivelonely dreamer filled with a desire to attain to the noblest and finest lifebut somehow back from itMrFlint is one of the few poets I know who have preserved intact today a spark of the old lyrical idealismHe isperhapsthough he may not realize iteven closer to Keats and Shelley than Verlaine he might almost be called a modern ShelleyHis affiliation with these earlier and greater romantics is more marked because it is an affiliation of spiritnot of formMrFlint s form has always been ownand by holding conscientiously to his own formhe has come closerto my way of thinkingto poets like Keats and Shelley than the innumerable tribe of imitators who have rashly taken the form for theis an early example of MrFlint s work my beautifulis not the sunsetthe pale green sky through the curtain the silver birchthe quietnessis not the hopping the little birds the lawnthe darkness over

tarnished copper its neck and beakthe deep black waterthe archesswan floats slowly the dark of the arch the swan floatsthe black depths of my sorrow a white rose of flame MrFlint had written nothing else but these two poems he would be immortal for their sakein spite of his disregard shared by HD of the convenient device which begins each line of a poem with a capital letterand of the laws of punctuationThey weave a perfect hypnotic spell in my mindand they fulfill completely a recent definition of MrEARobinsonthat poetry is a language which expresses through an emotional reaction something which cannot be said in ordinary speech Flint has given us other poems not less beautifulbut with a strain of greater pathos facesthat have never seen the worldthat have never lived in

42Reader Critic Is AnarchyAdairLondonthe March number of THE LITTLE REVIEWMiss Alice Groff criticises AnarchyShe criticises it badly and unfairlyShe writes as though she did not understand what Anarchy isHave you room in your paper for me to tell heris the name given to those periods in the life of a people during which the principle of domination is held in abeyance and men are no longer accountable to any magistracyIt is properly a political wordIt has no philosophical significanceAll it means isabsence of material governmentIt is in that sense that Milton uses it and Swift uses itIt is in that sense that writers of history books employ itIt is a termand the only correct termfor a certain condition of societyThat condition has occurred in the past and will doubtless occur in the futureIt is the result of an equality of strength among the different elementsorsocial egosthat make up a communityThere is Anarchy only so long as these forces remain equalOnce they cease to be equalso soon as one begins to tend towards dominanceso soon does the Anarchy endAccording to thesocial egothat has triumphedthe changed commonwealth becomes an oligarchy or a kingdoma military republican ochlocracy or federation of communesBut until thenwhile there is still absence of supreme coercive powerwhile there is still no dominantsocial ego so long is the community correctly termed an Anarchythisthe Anarchy of fact and of historyand the Anarchy of theory and modern revolutioniststhere is no substantial differenceThe anarchistin any ageis simply and without qualificationa man who desires an end put to the political power under which he livesThe reason why he desires such a thing does not matterHemay think government to be eternally an evil or only presently an evilHe may be egoist or communistWhat makes him an anarchist is that he hates the social order around him and would precipitate its destruction by paralyzing the centers of its administrative and legislative authoritytheoretical case against government has little part in the mind of the modern anarchistMiss Groff altogether overestimates the importance that he attaches to itThe war against authority as authority is pastWe are beyond that kind of mysticismScepticism is a big ingredient of Anarchy and the anarchist knows only too well that we know too little of psychology and too little of philosophy to judge the worth of abstractions like justice or liberty or the principle of dominationWe can only fix temporaryconditional values to such thingsActualmodern authority is the only sphinx that troubles the contemporary anarchistHe has no desire to control the destinies of his people andas anarchisthe has no theories about the future form of its political institutionsHis business is solely with present factsHis task is simply destructionIt may be that he does not start from abasis of reason He has seen and thought too much to trouble greatly about reasonHe knows too many books to have much optimismHe sees sprawled across the earth a tragic and incoherent civilization and he sees the most virile of the races of man lose under its influence the spontaneity of their actions and the region of their instinctsThatpossibly more than the desire tocomplete a circuit of reason is at the root of his attitude to societyThe question of the moral significance of archist or an archist isbeyond the answering of Miss Groff or any one elseThe question of whether it is well to endure the present orderto be dwarfed and poisoned by its idealsto beLittle Review 43 by its economy to contemptible pursuits to be forced to conjunction with base influences by every circumstance that past power has created for the control of present humanitythat is at least an answerable questionOf the value of the anarchist answer there may be many opinionsbut that it is an intelligible answer is not to be deniedIt is simple and coherentSociety is sick of its many counsellors and rulersIts sources of spiritual vitality are dried upIt is full of confusion bereft of consistent purpose continuing only in mechanical existenceTo precipitate its decay is the one wise action possible to mankindAll things are grown fatigued without simplicity of soul or rigour of desireReligionsinstitutions and codes of law are no longer animated solely the dead weight of the past holds them in positionOf what use to planmeditate or inventto conquer elements or to evoke from the earth newfantastic and wonder working metalswhen that which has custody of all such thingsthat which alone can give continuity to the works and achievements of man our mother civilization itself is in dissolutionthe mind of the anarchistthere are but two courses open tohumanityFirstthere may be a continuance of the present conditionsa society stratified as nowstupified as nowcompletely organizedof antique institutionsgrowing perpetually enfeebled in spiritthe current of its vitality becoming attenuated until lost in the morass of an enormous racial degeneracyOr elsesecondlythe mechanism of civilization may break and a period of administrative and moral chaos not easily distinguishable from barbarism supervene upon dilatory decadenceIt is this second course that commends itself to the anarchistOnly in a partial cessation of its continuityonly in a barbaric forgetfulness of its eternal problems and speculations can ah exhausted humanity come once more to a zest for existence and the will to achievementan Anarchy is commonly an epoch of such confusion and recoveryof the Loop Boy ReaderChicagothe
