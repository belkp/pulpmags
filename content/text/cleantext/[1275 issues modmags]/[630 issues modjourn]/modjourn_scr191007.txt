SI.SO THE story of the Squaw Man's son by the author of the eminently suc- cessful drama, "The Squaw Man," which remained on the boards for five years, playing in all English-speaking countries. This is a novel of the West, vigorous, stirring, picturesque; in its pages are re- produced the atmosphere of the prairies ; in its pages live and act such characters as have made the West the land of ro- mance. The hero Hal, the Squaw Man's son is a half-breed whose father was an Englishman of noble family. He was ed- ucated in the English schools and trained for the Army, but when the novel opens he has heard the   silent call   and is back near the ranch where he was born. The plot centres largely about the asphalt beds near the Red Butte Ranch, and. involving a fight with the Asphalt Trust, bears strongly on the present conservation problem. But beyond all, this is a love story, written with all the emotional intensity and delicate feeling that distin- guished  The Squaw Man.  Mr. Royle knows the Indian, for he has studied him at first hand. Once he said:    In my boyhood 1 sometimes spent my vacations on the Uintah Indian Agency, and I made up my mind that I would in  The Squaw Man  put the real In- dian on the stage.

His trainmen are outlaws temporarily re- formed, and his shippers a clique of un- scrupulous mine owners. Gun-play is common; to overcome the lawlessness of his command, he must overcome his weak- ness. This double fight, with its interw-oven love story, makes an absorbing novel.  It is a tale bristling with action. Lidgerwood. Ford. Bradford, and Hallock are characters evi- dently drawn from life.  Rochester Post-Express.

From the first year it has had all the students it could accommodate. It Is the Only School of Its Kind in America It is not a commercial enterprise, but is conducted solely in the interests of higher musical education. Its tuition fees are mod- erate and uniform, and cover all the tech- nical and theoretical subjects contained in a given course. It secures the services of teachers of the highest excellence, whose private terms would lie prohibitory' to most students. Among others the following are regular members of its teaching staff: OPERA   Ternina, Giraudet, von Niessen-Stone. PIANO Stojowski. Tapper, Hochman. ORGAN Gaston Dethier. VIOLIN Kneisel. CELLO VVilleke. THEORY and COMPOSITION-Porcy Goetschius. The opportunities of the Institute are intended only for students of natural ability with an earnest purpose to do serious work, and no others will be ac- cepted. Since the number of students is fixed at 600, and a large proportion of the old pupils will continue their studies next year, only a limited number of new pupils can be admitted in October. The Institute will move this Fall into a large new building specially erected for it on the banks of the Hudson, opposite Grant s Tomb.

No one who has ever before gone alter big game in Africa has shown sui h a thorough knowledge of the life of the animals, or has been so keen to observe and remark upon their habits and the contrast they make with the big game of North America. His experiences in the West anti his careful fore- hand studies of the natural history of the ani mals he intended to secure as specimens for the National Museum, placed him in a position to appreciate, as few professed scientists might, just what was needed. He has hunted system- atically, always with a definite purpose, and each one of his articles is a mine of specialized information. Here and there in the zoos there are living specimens of some of the animals he has written of. In the great New York Bronx Park Zoological  iarden there is probably the only living warthog in this country. Another animal here that attracts much attention is a beautiful little dyker antelope, sent by Mr. Roosevelt. The natural history of East Africa has l een made known to thousands to whom even the names of many of the animals were unknown. As a matter of fact, quite a number of them have not yet found a place in modern dictionaries. The abundance and variety of the game seen has been a revelation to his read ers. His own  x int of view is expressed in the following paragraph:  Kermit and I kept al oui a dozen trophies for ourselves; otherwise we shot nothing that was not used either as a Museum specimen or for meat usually for both puqxises. We were in hunting-grounds practically as good as any that have ever existed; but we did not kill a tenth, nor a hundredth part of what we might have killed had we been willing. The mere size of the bag indicates little as to a man's prowess as a hunter, and almost nothing as to the interest or value of his achievement.  In the August numlier Mr. Roosevelt will describe his experiences on his way to and in Uganda and along thegreat Nyanza lakes. There is a most interesting and strikingly picturesque account of a lion hunt, by a number of Nandi savages. Their only weapons were their great spears and their shields of skins. It is in the region of the lakes that the terrible and devas- tating sleeping sickness has made such inroads. Many of the beautiful islands, once the homes of the native tisher-folk, are uninhabitable, and fishing in the waters or living on the shores have been prohibited by the Knglish Government. Uganda is a totally different country from that of liast Africa, which Mr. Roosevelt calls a white man s country. There are new hunting experiences told of in this article. His com- ments upon his visits to the missionaries and upon their work will ljc read with much interest. If there is any one impression more than an- other that one gets from these articles, it is the remarkable comprehensiveness of obser- vation shown, and the unfailing sense of sym- pathy and interest in every new aspect of the strange life he encounters.  13 MAGAZINE NOTES I hr August fiction number of the Magazine will have, as usual, in addition to its regular features, a very notable group of short stories. Scribner's fiction number has been an institu- tion now for many years, and many of the best short stories ever published have appeared first in its pages. A recent editorial in one of the leading metrojiolitan papers referred to the vary- ing qualities of the contemjwrary short story and found a menace to a high standard in their very abundance. The short story seems to thrive especially in America, and in spite of the great demand for them and the number published there are, after all, a number of very good ones written. Of these Scribner's has had always its full share, and it has established a standard that is very generally recognized. V  V  The publication of the late George Meredith's " The Sentimentalists, An Unfinished Comedy,  in the August fiction numlier, will l e certainly considered a literary event of the first importance. The comedy was recently performed in London to the delight of all who heard it, and it will lie anticipated by lovers of Meredith as well as by all others who rememljcr how happy he was in dialogue and how keen was his sense of humor, his knowledge of character, and his shrewd wit. All of these qualities are in evidence in  The Sentimentalists  and it makes the most delight- ful and entertaining reading. Richard Harding Davis s first short story writ- ten for a magazine,  Gallagher,  appeared in Scribner's. The story of the little boy who helped his paper to secure a great  beat" brought the author at once into Ihe front rank of American story-tellers. Mr. Davis has been a frequent contributor to the Magazine ever since. In this year s fiction number he will be represented by a story of exceptional power, quite different in tone from the charming com- edies of sentiment and romance that he knows so well how to write. It is a story of character, a story of the inlluence of environment told with an intensity of feeling and grasp of the psychology of the situation that have marked a number of stories in what some will refer to as Mr. Davis s serious vein. "A Question of Lati- tude" will take hold of the reader s attention at the very start and hold it until the end. Few without Mr. Davis s wide experience as a traveller all over the world, could have con- ceived or understood the effect upon a highly cultivated man of a separation from his kind amid barbarous surroundings. This is a stofy th it will lie discussed, probably, quite as widely as the same author s  A Derelict.  V V Few readers of John Fox, Jr. s,  The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come,  with its beautiful and detailed description, would have ever thought that this contained its element of imagi- nation as well as the story of the lives of die human beings that made it so intensely appeal- ing. But until recently Mr. Fox had never been to the actual scene of the story. In the August number he tells of a trip made  On Horseback to Kingdom Come,  and although this time he is writing of real scenes and real people, the article has the same vein of charming sentiment, the same sympathy with and appre- ciation of natural aspects and ready understand- ing and interest in native types that arc so delightful an element of his stories. Many of the people the author met had read his books and had imagined they recognized some of his leading characters. Mr. Fox found a very good original for   Chad,   and   Melissa " of the story would have been  lovelier  had he first seen  the Lily of Kingdom Come.  V  It has been some time since any of Maxfield Parrish's beautiful paintings have Ixren repro- duced in the Magazine. Readers will welcome the announcement of a painting by Mr. Parrish that will accompany a poem called  The Er- rant Pan,  by George T. Marsh. The title suggests what a charming and congenial subjec t the artist would find in the lines of the poem, and the result is one of those beautiful color schemes and fanciful creations for which he is famous. In all recent fiction there arc no two people more interesting than Sanchia and Jack Senhouse of Mr. Hewlett s "Rest Harrow.  On their first appearance they piqued curiosity and at- tracted friendly attention by their personalities. As the story progresses it is evident that the real romance lies in the history of these two, and just how it is all going to end is still a problem. It is certainly a story of many remarkable qualities, intensely human, with an unfailing vein of .ideal- ism and poetry.

Kearton and Clark who were taking some really extraordi- nary' photographs of birds and game. Fi- nally, Governor and Mrs. Jackson arrived from a trip they had been making round Kenia; and I was much pleased to be able to tell the Governor, who had helped me in every way, about my bull elephant, and to discuss with him some of the birds we had seen and the mammals we had trapped. A great ingowa, a war-dance of the na- tives, was held in his honor, and ihe sight was, as always, one of interest and of a certain fascination. There was an Indian trader at Neri from whom we had obtained donkeys to carry to our elephant camp   K sho,  or food for the porters. He an- nounced that they were all in readiness in a letter to Cuninghamo, which was meant to be entirely res jcctful, but which sounded odd, as il was couched in characteristic Baboo English. The opening lines ran:  Dear K-ham, the donkeys are altogether deadly.  At last fifty Kikuyus as- sembled they are not able to carry the loads of regu- lar Swahili  jorters and I started that moment, though it was too late in the after- noon to travel more than three or four miles. The Kikuyus were real savages, naked save for a dingy blanket, usually carried round the neck. They formed a picturesque safari; but it was difficult to make the grasshop jer-like creat- ures take even as much thought for the future as the ordinary happy-go-lucky porters take. At night if it rained they cowered under the bushes in drenched and shivering discomfort; and yet they had to be driven to make bough shelters for . themselves. Once these shelters were up, and a little  ire kindled at the entrance of each, the moping, spirit- less wretches would speedily become transformed into be- ings who had lost all remem- brance of ever having been wet or cold. After their   osho had lieen distributed and eaten they would sit, huddled and cheerful, in their shelters, and sing steadily for a couple of hours. Their songs were much wilder than those of the regular   orters. and were often warlike. Occasionally, some  shanty man," as he would be called on shipboard, improvised or repeated a kind of story in short sentences or strophes; but the main feature of each song was the endless repetition of some refrain, musically chant- ed in chorus by the whole party. This repe- tition of a short sentence or refrain is a   haracteristic of many kinds of savage mu- sic; I have seen the Pawnees grow almost maddened by their triumph song, or victory song, which consisted of nothing whatever but the fierce, barking, wolf-like repetition of the words,  In the morning the wolves feasted.  Our first afternoon s march was unevent- ful ; but I was amused at one of our porters African Game Trails 3 and the  safari  ants. These safari ants are so called hy the natives because they go on foraging expeditions in immense numbers. The big- headed warriors are able to inflict a really painful bite. In o x n spaces, as where crossing a path, the column makes a little sunken way through which it streams un- interruptedly. Whenever we came to such a safari ant col- umn, in its sunken way, cross- ing our path, the porter in question laid two twigs on the ground as a peace-oficr- ing to the ants. He said that they were on safari, just as we were, and that it was wise to propitiate them. That evening we camped in a glade in the forest. At nightfall dozens of the big black-and-white hornbill, croaking harshly, llew over- head, their bills giving them a curiously top-heavy look. They roosted in the trees near by. Next day we came out on the plains, where there was no cultivation, and instead of the straggling thatch and wattle, un- fenced villages of the soil-tilling Kikuyus, we found ourselves again among the purely pastoral Masai, whose temjxjrary villages are arranged in a ring or oval, the rattle being each night herded in the middle, and the mud-daubed, cow-dung-plastered houses so placed that their backs form a nearly continuous circular wall, the spaces Ix;tween being choked with thorn bushes. 1 killed a steinbuck, missed a tommy, and at three hundred yards hit a Jackson s harte- beeste too far back, and failed in an effort to ride it down. The day after we were out on plains untenanted by human beings, and early in the afternoon struck water by which to pitch our tents. There was not much game, and it was shy; but I thought that I could kill enough to keep the camp in meat, so I sent back the two Scotchmen and their KikuyHS, after having them build a thorn boma, or fence, round the camp. One of the reasons why the Masai had driven their herds and flocks off this plain was because a couple of lions had turned man-eaters, and had killed a numl er of men and wom- en. We saw no sign of lions, and believed they had followed the Masai; but there was no use in taking needless chances. The camp was beside a cold, rapid stream, one of the head waters of the Guaso Nyero. It was heavily fringed with thorn timber. To the east the crags and snow- lields of Kenia rose from the slow swell of the mountain s base. It should have been the dry season, but there were continual heavy rains, which often turned into torren- tial down  ours. In the overcast mornings as I rode away from camp, it was as cool as if I were riding through the fall weather at home: at noon, if the sun came out, straight overhead, the heat was blazing; and we generally returned to camp at nightfall, drenched with the cold rain. The first heavy storm, the evening we pitched camp, It inking in the uf m   minJ bull Ffutu it photograph t    Theodore KoosetcU. much excited all my followers. AH came rushing into the tent to tell me that there was "a l ig snake up high.  This certain- ly seemed worth investigating, anti I fol- lowed him outside where everybody was looking at the   snake,  which proved to be a huge, funnel-shaped, whirling cloud, ca- reering across the darkened sky. It was a kind of waterspout or cyclone; fortunately it    assed to one side of camp. The first day I hunted I shot only a stein- buck for the table. The country alternated between bare plains anrl great stretches of sparse, stunted thorns. We saw zebra, and two or three bands of oryx; big, handsome antelope, strongly built and lioldlv colored, with long, black, rapier-like horns. They were very wary, much more so than the zebra with which they associated, and we could not get anywhere near them. Next day I hunted along the edges of a big swamp. We saw water-buck. but were unable to get within shot. However, near the farther end of the swamp, in an open swale, we found four eland feeding. The eland is the king of antelope; and not only did I desire meat for camp, but I wished the head of a good bull as a trophy for myself, the eland 1 had hitherto shot being for the National Museum. The little band included 4 African Game Trails 5 a big bull, a small bull, and two cows; at a distance the big bull looked slaty blue. The great, sleek, handsome creatures were feed- ing in the long grass just like cattle, switch- ing their long tails at the flies. The country looked like a park, with clumps of thorn- trees scattered over the grassy sward. Care- fully I crept on all-fours from tree clump to tree clump, trying always to move when the elands  heads were down grazing. At last I was within three hundred yards, when one of the cows caught a glimpse of me and alarmed the others. They were startled, but puzzled, and after trotting a few rods turned to stare at the half-seen object of their alarm. Rising lo my knee I shot the big bull in the throat as with head erect he gazed in my direction. Off he went with a rush, the others bounding and leaping as they accompan- icd him, and we followed on the blood spoor. Ba- khari and Gouvi- mali trotted fast on the trail, and in order to be fresh for the shot 1 mounted Tran- quillity. Sudden- ly out bounced the wounded bull from some I lushes close by, and the horse nearly had a fit; 1 could hardly get off in time to empty my magazine at long range fortunate- ly with effect. It was a magnifi- cent bull of the variety called Patterson s eland, with a fine head. Few prize oxen would be as heavy, and in spite of its great size, its finely moulded limbs and beautiful coat gave it a Kikuyu warrior, thoroughly game  hirtograph by Edmutul Hclkr. loOlv  Ail oryx  h t by Kcrmit Roowvclt Fn.tu m  iliuuj rn ili  iy Knttiut Koo j Vi lt- Oryx were now what I especially wished, and we devoted all of the following day to their pursuit. We saw three bands, two of them accompanying herds of zebra, after the manner of kongoni. Both species were found indifferently on the bare, short-grass llais and among the thin, stunted thorn- trees which covered much of the plains. After a careful stalk, the latter part on all- fours, I got to within about three hundred yards of a mixed herd, and put a bullet into one oryx as it faced me, and hit another as it ran. The first, from its position, I thought I would surely kill if I hit it at all, and both of the wounded beasts were well behind the herd when it halted a mile away on the other side of the plain. But as we approached they all went off together, and I can only ho  e the two I hit recovered; at any rate, after we had followed them for 6 African Game Trails miles, the tough beasts were still running as strongly as ever. All the morning I manoeuvred and tramped hard, in vain. At noon, I tried a stalk on a little band of six. who were stand- ing still, idly switching their tails, out in a big llat. They saw me, and at four hun dred yards I missed the shot. By this time I felt rather desperate, and decided for grunts and drove the others round with his horns. Meanwhile I was admiring the handsome dun gray coat of my prize, its long tail and long, sharp, slender horns, and the bold black and white markings on its face. Hardly had we skinned the car- cass before the vultures lit on it; with them were two marabou storks, one of which I shot with a hard bullet from the Springfield.

Accordingly I emptied the magazines of both my rifles at the oryx, as they ran across my front, and broke the neck of a fine cow, at four hundred and fifty yards.

The eland is one of the group of tragelaphs, which are as different from the true an- telopes, such as the gazelles, as they are from the oxen. One of its kinsfolk is the handsome little bushbuck, about as big as a white-tail deer; a buck of which Kermil had killed two specimens. The bushbuck is a wicked fighter, no other buck of its size being as dangerous; which makes the help- lessness and timidity of its hugh relative all the more striking. 1 had kept four Kikuyu with me to ac- company me on my hunts and carry in the skins and meat. They were with me on this occasion; and it was amusing to see how my four regular attendants, Bakhari and  iouvimali the gunbearers, Simba the sais, and Kiboko the skinner, looked down on their wild and totally uncivilized breth- ren. They would not associate with the  shenzis,  as they called them; that is, savages or bush people. But the  shenzis  always amused and interested me; and this was especially true on the afternoon in question. Soon after we had started camp-wards with the skin and meat of the oryx, we encountered a succession of thunder-storms. The rain came down in a deluge, so that the water stood ankle deep on the flats, the light- ning flashed continuously on every side, and the ter- rific peals of thunder made one continuous roll. At first it maddened my horse; but the uninterrupted blaze and roar, just because uninter- rupted, ended by making him feel that there was nothing to be done, and he plodded stolidly forward through the driving storm. My regular attendants ac- cepted it with an entire philosophy, which was fi- nally copied by the Kikuyus, who at first felt frightened. One of them had an old um- brella which he shared with a crony. He himself was carrying the marabou stork; his crony had long strips of raw oryx meat wound in a swollen girdle about his waist; neither had a stitch on save the blankets which were wrapped round their throats; and they clasped each other in a tight em- brace as they walked along under the bat- tered old umlirella. In this desolate and lonely land the majesty of the storms impressed on the be- holder a sense of awe and solemn exalta- tion. Tossing their crests, and riven by lightning, they gathered in their wrath from every quarter of the heavens, and darkness was hefore and under them; then, in the lull of a moment, they might break apart, while the sun turned the rain to silver and the rainbows were set in the sky; but always they gathered again, menacing and mighty,  for the promise of the Imjw was never kept, and ever the clouds returned after the rain. Once as I rode facing Kenia the African Game Trails 9 A rcliculateiJ giraffe I'agc 23.

But almost at once the many-colored glory was dimmed; for its splendor and terror the storm strode in front, and shrouded all things from sight in thunder-shattered sheets of rain. These days alone in the wilderness went by very pleasantly, and, as it was for   not too long, 1 thoroughly enjoyed being entirely by myself, so far as white men were concerned. By this time I had become really at- tached to my native follow- ers, who looked after my in- terest and comfort in every way; and in return 1 kept them supplied with plenty of food, saw that they were well clothed, and forced them to gather enough fire- wood to keep their tents dry and warm at night for cold, rainy weather is al- ways hard upon them. Ali, mv faithful head tent boy, and Shemlani his assistant poor Bill the Kikuyu had left because of an intricate row with his fellows were both, as they proudly informed me, Arabs. On the East African coast the so-called Arabs almost all have native blood in them and speak Swa- hili; the curious, newly created language of the descendants of the natives whom the Arabs originally enslaved, and who them- selves may have in their veins a little Arab blood; in fact, the dividing line between Swahili and Arab becomes impracticable for an outsider to draw where, as is gener- ally the case, it is patent that the blood of both races is mixed to a degree at which it is only possible to guess. Ali spoke some English; and he and Shemlani were de- voted and efficient servitors. Bakhari the gun-bearer was a Swahili, quite fearless with dangerous game, rather sullen and unmoved by any emotion that I could ever discover. He spoke a little English, but it could not be called idiomatic. One day we saw two ostriches, a cock and a hen, with their chicks, and Bakhari with some excitement said,  Look, sah  ostrich  bull, cow, and pups   The other gun-bearer, Gouvimali, in some wavs an even better hunter, and always good-tempered, knew but one English phrase; regularly every afternoon or evening, after cleaning the rille he had carried, he would say, as he left the lent, his face wreathed in smiles,   G-o-o-d-e-bye    Gouvimali was a Wkamba, as were Simba and my other sais, M'nyassa, who had taken the place of Hamisi  Hamisi had broken down in health, his legs, as he assured me. becom- ing  very sick  .

My two horses, when I did not use them, grazed con- tentedly throughout the day near the little thorn boma which surrounded our tents; and at nightfall the friendly things came within it of their own accord to be given their feed of com and lie put in their own tent. When the sun was hot they were tor- mented by biting flies; but their work was easy, and they were well treated and throve. In the daytime vult- ures, kites, and white-necked ravens came round camp, and after nightfall jackals wailed and hyenas uttered their weird cries as they prowled outside the thorn walls. Twice, at midnight, we heard the ominous sigh- ing or moaning of a hungry lion, and I looked to my rifle, which always stood, loaded, at the head of my bed. But on neither occasion did he come near us. Every night a fire was kept burning in the entrance to the boma, and the three askaris watched in turn, with instructions to call me if there was any need. I easily kept the camp in meat, as I had guessed that I could do. My men feasted on oryx and eland, while I reserved the tongues and tenderloins for myself. F.ach day I hunted for eight or ten hours, something of inter- est always happening. I would not shoot at the gazelles; and the game I did want was so shy that almost all my shots were at long range, and consequently a number of them did not hit. However, I came on my best oryx in rather thick bush, and killed it at a hundred and twenty- five yards, as it turned with a kind of sneeze of alarm or curiosity, anil stood broadside to me, the sun glinting on its handsome coat and polished black horns. One of my Kikuyu followers packed the skin entire to camp. I had more trouble with another oryx, wounding it one evening at three hundred and hftv yards, and next morning following the trail and after much hard work and a couple of misses killing it with a shot at three hundred yards. On September 2 1 found two newly born oryx calves. The color of the oryx made them less visible than hartebeeste when a long way off on the dry plains.

But in bright sunlight, in bush, I also noticed that the zebra themselves were hard to see. One afternoon, while skirting the edge of a marsh teeming with waders and water- fowl, I came across four stately Kavirondo cranes, specimens of which bird the natural- ists had been particularly anxious to secure. They were not very shy for cranes, but they would not keep still, and 1 missed a shot with the Springfield as they walked along about a hundred and fifty yards ahead of me. However, they were unwise enough to circle round me when they rose, still keep- ing the same distance, and all the time ut- tering their musical call, while their great wings tlap  ed in measured beats. Wing shooting with the ritle, even at such large birds of such slow and regular tlight, is never easy, and they were rather far off: but with the last cartridge in my magazine the fifth  I brought one whirling down through the air, the bullet having pierced his body. It was a most beautiful bird, black, white, and chestnut, with an erect golden crest, and long, lanceolate gray leathers on the throat and breast. There were water-buck and impalla in this swamp. I tried to get a bull of the former but failed. Several times I was within fifty yards of doe impalla and cow water-buck, with their young, and watched as they fed and rested, quite unconscious of my presence. Twice I saw steinbuck, on catching sight of me, lie down, hoping to escape observation. The red coat of the steinbuck is rather conspicuous, much more so than the coat of the duiker; yet it often tries lo hide from possible foes. Late in ihe afternoon of September 3 Cuninghame and Heller, with the main sa- fari. joined me, and I greeted them joyfully; while my men were equally pleased to see their fellows, each shaking hands with his especial friends. Next morning we started toward Meru, heading north- east, toward the foot-hills of Kenia. The vegetation changed its character as we rose. By the stream where we had camped grew the great thorn-trees with yellow- green trunks which we had become accustomed to associ- ate with the presence of herds of game. Out on the dry flats were other thorns, weazened little trees, or mere scrawny bushes, with swellings like oulbs on the branches and twigs, and the long thorns far more conspicuous than the scanty foliage; though what there was of this foliage, now brilliant green, was ex- quisite in hue and form, the sprays of delicate little leaves Wing as line its the daintiest lace. On the foot-hills all these thorn-trees vanished. We did not go as high as the forest Ix-lt pro K r  here narrow, while above it the bamboos covered ihe mountain-side , but tonguesof juniper forest stretched down along the valleys which we crossed, and there were large patches of coarse deer fern, while among many unknown flowers we saw blue lupines, oxeye daisies, and clover. That night we canqied so high that it was really cold, and we welcomed the roaring fires of junior logs. We rose al sunrise. It was a glorious morning, clear and cool, and as we sat at breakfast, the table spread in the o  cn on the dew drenched grass, we saw in the south-east the peak of Kenia, and through the high, transparent air the snow-fields seemed so close as almost to dazzle our eyes. To the north and west we looked far out over the wide, rolling plains to a wilder- Two Kikuyu boys r ffn   phnt nfr ph   1 ds-unl 11 idler I A Boron camp I-rum a fihotogniph b  Keimit K xric cH.

All that day and the next we journeyed eastward, almost on the equator. At noon the overhead sun burned with torrid heat: but with the twilight short compared to the long northern twilights, but not nearly as short as tropical twilights are often de- picted came the cold, and each night the frost was heavy. The country was unten- anted by man. In the afternoon of the third day we began to go downhill, and hour by hour the tlora changed. At last we came to a broad belt of woodland, where the strange trees of many kinds grew tall and thick. Among them were camphor-trees, and trees with gouty branch tips, bearing leaves like those of the black walnut, and panicles of lilac  lowers, changing into brown seed vessels; and other trees, with clusters of purple flowers, and the seeds or nuts enclosed in hard pods or seed vessels like huge sausages. On the other side of the forest we camc suddenly out on the cultivated fields of the Wa-Meru, who, like the Kikuyu, till the soil; and among them, farther down, was Meru Boma, its neat, picturesque buildings beautifully placed among green groves and irrigated fields, and looking out from its cool elevation over the hot valleys   eneath. It is one of the prettiest spots in Kast Africa. We were more than hospitably received by the Commissioner, Mr. Horne, who had been a cow-puncher in Wyoming for seven years so that naturally we had much in common. He had built the station himself, and had tamed the wild tribes around by mingled firmness and good treatment; and lie was a mighty hunter, and helped us in every way. Here we met Kermit and Tarlton, and heard all about their hunt. They had l een away from us for three weeks and a half, along the Guaso Nyero, and had enjoyed first-rate luck. Kermit had been particu- larly interested in a caravan they had met, consisting of wild spear-bearing Borani people like Somalis, bringing down scores of camels and hundreds of small horses to sell at Nairobi. They had come from the north, near the outlying Abyssinian lands, and the caravan was commanded by an Arab of stately and courteous manners. Such an extensive caravan journey was rare in the old days before English rule; but one of the results of the  Pax Ku- African Game Trails 15 ropaica,  wherever it obtains in German, French, or English Africa, is a great in crease of intercourse, commercial and so- cial, among the different tribes, even where widely separated. This caravan had been followed by lions; and a day of two after- ward Kermit and Tarlton ran into what were probably these very' lions. There were eleven of them: a male with a heavy mane, three lionesses, and seven cubs, some of them about half grown. As Ker- mit and Tarlton galloped after them, the lion took the lead, the cubs coming in the middle, while the three lionesses loped along in the rear, guarding their young. The lion cared little for his wives and offspring, and gradually drew ahead ol them, while the two horsemen, riding at full speed, made a wide detour round the others in order to reach him; so that al last they got between him and the ten lion- esses and cubs, the big lion coming first, the horsemen next, and then the lesser lions, all headed the same way. As the horse-hooves thundered closer the lion turned to bay. Kermit whose horse had once fallen with him in the chase and Tarlton leaped off their horses, and Kermit hit the lion with his first shot, and, as it started to charge, mortally wounded it with a second bullet. It turned and tried to reach cover, and Tarlton stopped it with a third shot; for there was no lime to lose, as they wished to tackle the other lions. After a sharp gallop they rounded up the lion- esses and cubs. Kermit killed one large cub, which they mistook for a lioness; wounded a lioness which for the time being escaped; killed another with a single bullet from his 30-40 Winchester for the others he used his 405 Winchester and hit the third as she crouched facing him at two hundred yards. She at once came in at full speed, making a most determined charge. Kermit and Tarlton were stand- ing near their horses. The lioness came 011 with great bounds so that Kermit missed her twice, but broke her shoulder high up when she was but thirty yards off. She fell on her head and, on rising, galloped, not at the men, but at the horses, who, curi- ously enough, paid no heed to her. Tarl- ton stopped her with a bullet in the nick of time, just before she reached them, and with another bullet Kermit killed her. Two days later they came on the remaining cubs Kutty rock rat.

Ollfi'il liOit- and the wounded lionet, and Kermit killed the latter; but they let the cubs go, feeling it unsportsmanlike to kill them a feeling which I am by no means certain I share, fur lions are scourges not only lo l oth wild and tame animals, but to man himself. Kermit also rode down and killed two cheetahs and a serval. and got a bad tum- ble while chasing a jackal, his horse turning a complete somersault through a thorny bush. This made seven cheetahs that he had killed, a record unequalled for any other East African trip of the same length; and the finding and galloping down of these cheetahs, going at breakneck speed over any and every kind of ground, and then shooting them either from foot or horse- back, made one of the noteworthy features of our trip. One of these two cheetahs had just killed a steinbuck. The serval was with its mate, and Kermit watched them for some time through his glasses before following them. There was one curious feature of their conduct. One of them was playing about, now near the other, now leaving it: and near by was a bustard, which it several times pretended to stalk, crawling toward it a few yards, and then standing up and walking away. The bus- terd paid no heed to it; and, more singular still, two white-necked ravens lit close to it; within a few yards on either side, the serval sitting erect between them, seemingly quite unconcerned for a couple of minutes, and then strolling off without making any effort to molest them. I can give no explanation of the incident; it illustrates afresh the need of ample and well-recorded observations by trustworthy field naturalists, who shall go into the wilderness before the big game, the big birds, and the beasts of prey vanish. Those pages of the book of nature which are best worth reading can best l ie read far from the dwellings of civilized man; and for their full interpretation we need the services, not of one man. but of many men, who in addition to the gift of accurate ob- servation shall if possible possess the power fully , accurately, and with vividness to write about what they have observed. Kermit shot many other animals, among them three line oryx, one of which he rode down on horseback, maincurring so that at last it gallo K d fairly close by across his front, whereupon he leaped off his horse for the shot; an ardwolf  a miniature hyena African Game Trails 17 with very weak teeth  which bolted from its hole at his approach; gerunuk, small antelope with necks relatively as long as giraffes , which are exceedingly shy and difficult to obtain; and the Grevy s zebra, as big as a small horse. Most of his hunt- ing was done alone, either on foot or on horseback; on a long run or all-day tramp no other member of our outfit, black or white, could quite keep up with him. He and Tarlton found where a leopard had killed and partly eaten a nearly full-grown individual of this big zebra. He also shot a twelve-foot crocodile. The ugly, formid- able brute had in its belly sticks, stones, the claws of a cheetah, the hoofs of an im- palla, and the big bones of an eland, to- gether with the shell plates of one of the large river-turtles; evidently it took toll in- differently from among its fellow-denizens of the river, and from among the creatures that came to drink, whether beasts of past- ure or the tlesheaters that preyed upon them. He also shot three buffalo bulls, Tarlton helping him to finish them off, for they are tough animals, tenacious of life and among the most dangerous of African game. One turned to charge, but was disabled by the bullets of both of them before he could come on. Tarlton, whose experience in the hunting field against dangerous game had been large, always maintained that, although lion hunting was the most dan- gerous sport, because a hunted lion was far more apt to charge than any other animal, yet that when a buffalo bull did charge he was more dangerous than a lion, because harder to kill or turn. Where zebra and other game arc abundant, as on the Athi plains, lion do not meddle with such for- midable quarryr as buffalo; on Heatley s farm lions sometimes made their lairs in the same papyrus swamp with the buffalo, but never molested them. In many places, however, the lion preys largely, and in some places chiefly, on the buffalo. The hun- ters of wide experience with whom I con- versed, men like Tarlton, Cuninghame, and Horne, were a unit in stating that where a single lion killed a buffalo they had always found that the buffalo was a sow or im- mature bull, and that whenever they had found a full-grown bull thus killed, several lions had been engaged in the job. Horne had once found the carcass of a big bull Vol. XLVIII  2 which had been killed and eaten by lions, and near by a dead lioness with a great rip in her side, made by the buffalo s horn in the fight in which he succumbed. Even a buffalo cow, if pitted against a single lion, would probably stand an even chance; but of course the fight never is fair, the lion s aim being to take his prey unawares and get a death grip at the outset; and then, unless his hold is broken, he cannot be se- riously injured. Twenty years ago the African buffalo were smitten w'ith one of these overwhelm- ing disasters which are ever occurring and recurring in the animal world. Africa is not only the land, beyond all others, subject to odious and terrible insect plagues of every conceivable kind, but is also pecu- liarly liable to cattle murrains. About the year 1889, or shortly before, a virulent form of rinderpest started among the do- mestic cattle and wild buffalo almost at the northern border of the buffalo s range, and within the next few years worked gradually southward to beyond Zambesi. It wrought dreadful havoc among the cattle, and in consequence decimated by starvation many of the cattle-owning tribes; it killed many of the large bovine antelopes, and it well- nigh exterminated the buffalo. In many places the buffalo herds were absolutely wiped out, the species being utterly de- stroyed throughout great tracts of territory, notably in East Africa; in other places the few survivors did not represent the hun- dredth part of those that had died. For years the East African buffalo ceased to exist as a beast of the chase. But all the time it was slowly regaining the lost ground, and during the last decade its increase has been rapid. Unlike the slow-breeding elephant and rhinoceros, buffalo multiply apace, like domestic cattle, and in many places the herds have now become too nu- merous. Their rapid recovery from a ca- lamity so terrific is interesting and instruc- tive.  Doubtless for many years after man, in recognizably human form, appeared on this planet, he played but a small part in the destination of big animals, compared to plague, to insect pests and microbes, to drought, flood, earth upheaval, and change of temperature. But during the geological moment covering the few' thousand years of  On our trip alone the Guaso N m wc heard that there had brea a fresh outbreak U rindcrpeit among the buffalo: 1 hope it will not pinve such a hideous disaster. IS African Game Trails recorded history man has been not merely the chief, but practically the sole factor in the extermination of big mammals and birds. At and near Mcru Boma we s  cnt a fort- night hunting elephant and rhinoceros, as described in the preceding chapter. While camped by the boma white-necked vulturinc ravens and black and white crows came familiarly around the tents. A young eland bull, quite as tame as a domestic cow, was picketed, now here, now there, about us. Horne was breaking it to drive in a cart. During our stay another District Com- missioner, Mr. Piggott, came over on a short visit; it was he who the preceding year, while at Ncri, had been obliged to undertake the crusade against the rhinos, because, quite unprovoked, they had killed various natives. He told us that at the same time a man-eating leopard made its appearance, and killed seven children. It did not attack at night but in the daytime, its victims being the little lxiys who were watching the llocks of goats; sometimes it look a boy and sometimes a goat. Two old men killed it with sj ears on ihe occasion of its taking the last victim. It was a big male, very old, much emaciated, and the teeth worn to stumps. Horne told us that a month or two before our arrival at Meru a leopard had begun a career of woman- killing. It killed one woman by a bite in the throat, and ate the body. It sprang on and badly wounded another, but was driven off in time to save her life. This was probably the leopard Heller trap  ed and shot, in the very locality where it had committed its ravages; it was an old male, but very thin, with worn teelh. In these cases the reason for the beast s action was plain; in each instance a big, savage male had found his  x wers failing, and had been driven to prey on the females and young of the most helpless of animals, man. But another attack, of which Piggott told us, was apparently due to the queer individual freakish ness always to be taken into ac- count in dealing with wild beasts. A Masai chief, with two or three followers, was sitting eating under a bush, when, ab solutely without warning, a leopard sprang on him, clawed him on the head and hand, without biting him, and as instantly dis- appeared. Piggott attended to the wound- ed man. In riding in the neighborhood, through the tall dry grass, which would often rattle in  he wind, I was amused to find that if I suddenly heard the sound I was apt to stand alertly on guard, quite unconsciously and instinctively, because it suggested the presence of a rattlesnake. During the years I lived on a ranch in the W est I was always hearing and killing rattlesnakes, and although I knew well that no African snake carries a ratlle, my subconscious senses always threw me to attention if there was a sound resembling that made by a rattler. Tarlton, by the way, told me an interesting anecdote of a white-tailed mon- goose and a snake. One day they brought in a rather small puff adder, less than two feet long, put it on the floor, and showed it to the mongoose. Instantly the latter sprang toward the snake, every hair in its body and tail on end, and halted five feet away, while the snake lay in curves like the thong of a whip, its head turned toward the mongoose. Both were motionless for a moment. Then, suddenly, the mongoose seemed to lose all its excitement; its hair smoothed down, and ii trolted quietly up to the snake, seized it by the middle of the back it always devoured its food with sav- age voracity and settled comfortably down to its meal. Like lightning the snake s head whipped round. It drove its fangs deep into the snout or lip of the mongoose, hung on for a moment, and then repeated the blow. The mongoose paid not the least attention, but went on munching the snake s body, severed its backbone at once, and then ate it all up, head, fangs, poison, and everything; and it never showed a sign of having received any damage in the en- counter. I had always understood that the mongoose owed its safely to its agility in avoiding the snake s stroke, and I can offer no explanation of this particular incident. f here were eland on the high downs not far from Meru, apparently as much at home in  he wet, cold climate as on the hot plains. Their favorite gait is the trot. An elephant moves at a walk or rather rack; a giraffe has a very peculiar leisurely look- ing gallop, Ijoth hind legs coming forward at the same time, outside the forelegs; rhino and buffalo trot and run. Kland when alarmed lxmnd with astonishing agil- ity for such large beasts a trait not shown by other large antelope, like oryx and African Game Trails 19 then gallop  or a short distance; hut the big bulls speedily begin to trot, and the cows and younger bulls gradually also drop back into the trot. In fact, their gaits are in es- sence those of the wapiti, which also prefer the trot, although wapiti never make the bounds that eland do at the start. The moose, however, is more essentially a trot- ter than either eland or wapiti; a very old and heavy moose never, when at speed, goes at any other gait than a trot, except that under the pressure of great and sudden danger it may perhaps make a few bounds. While at Meru Boma I received a cable, forwarded by native runners, telling me of Peary s wonderful feat in reaching the North Pole. Of course wc were all over- joyed, and in particular wc Americans could not but feel a social pride in the fact that it was a fcllow-countryman who had performed the great and noteworthy achievement. A little more than a year had passed since I said good-by to Peary as he started on his Arctic quest; after leaving New York in the Roosevelt, he had put into Oyster Bay to see us, and we had gone aboard the Roosevelt, had examined with keen interest how she was fitted for the bo- real seas and the boreal winter, and had then waved farewell to the tall, gaunt ex- plorer as he stood looking toward us over the side of the stout little ship.  On September 21 Kermit and Tarlton started south-west, toward Lake Hanning- ton, and Cuninghame and I north, toward the Guaso Nyero. Heller was under the weather, and we left him to sjiend a few days at Meru Boma, and then to take in the elephant skins, and other museum speci- mens, to Nairobi. k As Cuninghame and 1 were to lie nearly four weeks in a country with no food sup- plies, we took a small donkey safari to carry the extra food for our porters for in these remote places the difficulty of taking in many hundred pounds of salt, as well as skin tents, and the difficulty of bringing out the skeletons and skins of the big animals collected, makes such an expedition as ours, undertaken for scientific purposes, far more cumbersome and unwieldy than a mere hunting trip, or even than a voyage of ex- ploration, and trebles the labor.   When I readied Ncri I received from Peary the follow- ing cable: . -   Your farewell was a royal mascot The Pole is ours. Peary.  A long day's march brought us down to the hot country. That evening wc pitched our tents by a rapid brook, bordered by palms, whose long, stiff fronds rustled ceaselessly in the wind. Monkeys swung in the tree-tops. On the march I shot a Kavirondo crane on the wing, with the little Springfield, almost exactly repeating my experience with the other crane which I had shot three weeks before, except that on this occasion I brought down the bird with my third bullet, and then wasted the last two cartridges in the magazine at his compan- ions. At dusk the donkeys were driven to a fire within the camp, and they stood pa- tiently round it in a circle throughout the night, safe from lions and hyenas. The day s march brought us to another small tributary of the Guaso Nyero, a little stream twisting rapidly through the plain l ctween its sheer banks. Here and there it was edged with palms and beds of bul- rushes. We pitched the tents close to half a dozen flat-topped thorn-trees. We spent several days at this camp. Many kites came around the tents, but neither vultures nor ravens. The country was a vast plain bounded on almost every hand by chains of far-off mountains. In the south-west, just beyond the equator, the snows of Kenia lifted toward the sky. To the north the barren ranges were grim with the grimness of the desert. The flats were covered with pale, bleached grass which waved all day long in the wind; for though there were sometimes calms, or changes in the wind, on most of the days we were out it never ceased blowing from some point in the south. In places the parched soil was crumbling and rotten; in other places it was thickly strewn with volcanic stones; there were but few tracts over which a horse could gallop at speed, although neither the rocks nor the rotten soil seemed to hamper the movements of the game. Here and there were treeless stretches. Elsewhere there were occasional palms; and trees thirty or forty feet high, seemingly cactus or aloes, which looked even more like candel- abra than the euphorbia which is thus named; and a scattered growth of thorn- trees and bushes. The thorn-trees were of many kinds. One bore only a few leath- ery leaves, the place of foliage being taken by the mass of poisonous-looking, fleshy spines which, together with the ends of the 20 African Game Trails branches, were bright green. The camel- thorn was completely armed with little, sharply hooked thorns which tore whatever they touched, whether flesh or clothes. Then there were the mimosas, with long, straight thorn spikes; they are so plentiful in certain places along the Guaso Nyero that almost all the lions have festering sores in their paws because of the spikes that have broken off in them. In these thorn- trees the weaver birds had built multitudes of their straw nests, each with its bottle- shaped mouth toward the north, away from the direction of the prevailing wind. Each morning we were up at dawn, and saw the heavens redden and the sun flame over the rim of the world. All day long we rode and walked across the endless flats, save that at noon, when the sky was like molten brass, we might rest under the thin half-shade of some thorn-tree. As the shadows lengthened and the harsh, pitiless glare softened, we might turn campwards; or we might hunt until the sun went down, and the mountains in the far ofl west, and the sky above them, grew faint and dim with the hues of fairy land. Then we would ride back through the soft, warm beauty of the tropic night, the stars blazing overhead and the silver moonlight flooding the reaches of dry grass; it was so bright that our shadows were almost as black and clear-cut as in the day. On reaching camp I would take a cup of tea with crackers or gingersnaps, and after a hoi bath and a shave I was always eager for dinner. Scattered over these flats were herds of zebra, oryx, and gazelle. The gazelle, the most plentiful and much the tamest of the game, were the northern form of theGrant s gazelle, with straighter horns which repre- sented the opposite extreme when com- pared with the horns of the Roberts' type which we got on the Sotik. They seemed to me somewhat less in size than the big gazelle of the Kapiti Plains. One of the bucks I shot, an adult of average size  I was not able to weigh my biggest one , weighed one hundred and fifteen pounds; a very big true Grant s buck which I shot on the Kapiti plains weighed one hundred and seventy-one pounds; doubtless, there is complete intergradation, but the Guaso Nyero form seemed slimmer and lighter, and in some respects seemed to tend toward the Somaliland gazelles. 1 marked no differ- ence in the habits, except that these north- ern gazelle switched their tails more jerkily, more like tommies, than was customary with the true Grant s gazelles. But the difference may have been in my observa- tion. At any rate, the gazelles in this neighborhood, like those elsewhere, went in small parties, or herds of thirty or forty individuals, on the open plains or where there were a few scattered bushes, and be- haved like those in the Sotik or on the Athi plains. A near kinsman of the gazelle, the gerunuk, a curious creature with a very long neck, which the Swahilis call  little giraffe,  was scattered singly or in small parties through the brush, and was as wild and wary as the common gazelle was tame. It seemed to prefer browsing, while the common gazelle grazes. The handsome oryx, with their long horns carried by both sexes, and their color- ing of black, white, and dun gray, came next to the gazelle in point of numbers. They were generally found in herds of from half a dozen to fifty individuals, often mixed with zebra herds. There were also solitary bulls, probably turned out of the herds by more vigorous rivals, and often one of these would be found with a herd of zebras, more merciful to it than its own kinsfolk. All this game of the plains is highly gregarious in habit, and the species associate freely with one another. The oryx cows were now generally accompanied by very young calves, for. unlike what we found to be the case with the hartebcest on the Athi, the oryx on the Guaso Nyero seem to have a definite calving time September.  I shot only bulls  there was no meat, either for the  x rters or ourselves, except what 1 got with the rifle , and they were so wary that almost all those I killed were shot at ranges between three hundred and five hundred yards; and at such ranges I need hardly say that 1 did a good deal of missing. One wounded bull which, the ground being favorable, 1 galloped down, turned to bay and threatened to charge the horse. We weighed one bull; it tipped the scales at four hundred pounds. The lion kills we found in this neighborhood were all oryx 4   course represent  only one m.in'  experience. I Vi wrr Yrc m  y  u.ch Ou tlie Athi in j ncm-born wililchccstc ami hartehee te calves awl other  several months old.

African Game Trails 21 and zebra; and evidently the attack was made in such fashion that the oryx had no more chance to fight than the zebra. The zebra were of both species, the smaller or Burchell s, and the  Irevy s, which the porters called kangani. Kach animal went in herds by itself, and almost as frequently we found them in mixed herds containing both species. But they never interbreed, and associate merely as each does with the oryx. The kangani is a fine beast, much bigger than its kinsman; it is as large as a   olo pony. It is less noisy than the common zebra, the  bonte quagga   of the Boers, and its cry is totally different. Its gaits are a free, slashing trot and gallop. When it stands facing one the huge fringed ears make it instantly recog- nizable. The stripes are much narrower and more numerous than those on the small zebra, and in consequence cease to be dis- tinguishable at a shorter distance; the ani- mal then looks gray, like a wild ass. When the two zebras are together the coloring of the smaller kind is more conspicuous. In scanning a herd with the glasses we often failed to make out the species until we could catch the broad black and white stripes on the rump of the common  bonte quagga.  There were many young foals with the kangani; I happened not to see any with the Burchell s. I found the kan- gani even more wary and more difficult to shoot than the oryx. The first one I killed was shot at a range of four hundred yards; the next I wounded at that distance, and had to ride it down, at the cost of a hard gallop over very bad country, and getting torn by the   wait a bit   thorns. There were a number of rhinos on the plains, dull of wit and senses, as usual. Three times we saw cows with calves trot- ting at their heels. Once, while my men were skinning an oryx, I spied a rhino less than half a mile off. Mounting my horse I cantered down, and examined it within a hundred yards. It was an old bull with worn homs, and never saw me. On an- other occasion, while we were skinning a big zebra, there were three rhinoceros, all in different places, in sight at the same time. There were also ostriches. I saw a par- ly of cocks, with wings spread and necks curved backward, strutting and dancing. Their mincing, springy run is far faster than when the bird is near by, it seems. The neck is held back in running, and when at speed the stride is twenty-one feet. No game is more wary or more difficult to approach. I killed both a cock and a hen which I found the naturalists desired even more than a cock. We got them by stumbling on the nest, which contained eleven huge eggs, and was merely a bare spot in the sand, surrounded by grass two feet high; the bird lay crouched, with the neck flat on the ground. When we accidentally came across the nest the cock was on it, and I failed to get him as he ran. The next day we returned, and dismounted before we reached the near neighborhood of the nest. Then I advanced, cautiously, my rifle at the ready. It seemed impossible that so huge a bird could lie hidden in such scanty cover, but not a sign did we see until, when we were sixty yards off, the hen, which this time was on the nest, rose, and I killed her at sixty yards. Even this did not make the cock desert the nest; and on a subsequent day I returned, and after missing him badly, I killed him at eighty-five yards; and glad I was to see the huge black-and- white bird tumble in the dust. He weighed two hundred and sixty-three pounds and was in fine plumage. The hen weighed two hundred and forty pounds. Her stomach and gizzard, in addition to small, white quartz pebbles, contained a mass of vege- table substance; the bright-green leaves and twig tips of a shrub, a kind of rush with jointed stem and tuberous root, bean pods from different kinds of thorn-trees, and the leaves and especially the seed ves- sels of a bush, the seed vessels being en- closed in cases or pods so thorny that they pricked our fingers, and made us wonder at the bird s palate. Cock and hen brood thr eggs alternately. We found the heart and liver of the ostrich excellent eating ; the eggs were very good also. As the cock died it uttered a kind of loud, long-drawn grunting Ixiom that was almost a roar. Its beauti- ful white wing plumes were almost unworn. A full-grown wild ostrich is too wary to fall into the clutches of a lion or leopard, save by accident, and it will master any of the lesser carnivora; but the chicks are preyed on by jackals and wild cats, and of course by the larger beasts of prey also; and the eggs are eagerly sought by furred and feath- ered foes alike. Seemingly trustworthy set- tlers have assured me that vultures break oo African Game Trails the tough shells with stones. The cock and hen will try to draw their more formidable foes away from the nest of the chicks by lingering so near as to lure them into pur- suit; and anything up to the size of a hyena they will attack and drive away, or even kill. The terrific downward stroke of an ostrich s leg is as dangerous as the kick of a horse; the thump will break a rib or back- bone of any ordinary animal, and in addi- tion to the force of the blow itself the big nails may make a ghastly rip. Both cock and hen lead about the young brood and care for it. The two ostriches 1 shot were swarming with active parasitic flies, a little like those that were on the lions 1 shot in the Sotik. Later the porters brought us in several ostrich chicks. They also brought two genet kittens, which I tried to raise, but failed. They were much like ordinary kittens, with larger ears, sharper noses, and longer tails, and loved to perch on my shoulder or sit on my lap while I stroked them. They made dear little pets, and 1 was very sorry when they died. On the day that I shot the cock ostrich I also shot a giraffe. The country in which we were hunting marks the southern limit of the  reticulated  giraffe, a form or species entirely distinct from the gi- raffe we had already obtained in the coun- try south of Kenia. The southern giraffe is blotched with dark on a light ground, whereas this northern or north-eastern form is of a uniform dark color on the back and sides, with a net-work or reticulation of white lines placed in a large pattern on this dark background. The naturalists were very anxious to obtain a specimen of this form from its southern limit of distribu- tion, to sec if there was any intergradation with the southern form, of which we had already shot specimens near its northern, or at least north-eastern, limit. The dis- tinction proved sharp. On the day in question we breakfasted at six in the morning, and were off immedi- ately afterward; and we did not eat any- thing again until supj er at quarter to ten in the evening. In a hot climate a hunter does not need lunch; and though in a cold climate a simple lunch is permissible, any- thing like an elaborate or luxurious lunch is utterly out of place if the man is more than a parlor or drawing-room sportsman. We saw no sign of giraffe until late in the afternoon. Hour after hour we plodded across the plain, now walking, now riding, in the burning heat. The withered grass was as dry as a bone, for the country had l een many months without rain; yet the oryx, zebra, and gazelle evidently throve on the harsh pasturage. There were in- numerable game trails leading hither and thither, and, after the fashion of game trails, usually fading out after a few hun- dred yards. But there were certain trails which did not fade out. These were the ones which led to water. One such we followed. It led across stretches of grass- land, through thin bush, thorny and al- most leafless, over tracts of rotten soil, cracked and crumbling, and over other tracts where the unshod horses picked their way gingerly among the masses of sharp- edged volcanic stones. Other trails joined in, and it grew more deeply marked. At last it led to a bend in a little river, where flat shelves of limestone lx rdered a kind of pool in the current where there were beds of green rushes and a fringe of trees and thorn thickets. This was evidently a favor- ite drinking place. Many trails converged toward it, and for a long distance round the ground was worn completely bare by the hoofs of the countless herds of thirsty game that had travelled thither from time im- memorial. Sleek, handsome, long-homed oryx, with switching tails, were loitering in the vicinity, and at the water hole itself we surprised a band of gazelles not fifty yards off; they fled panic-struck in every direc- tion. Men anti horses drank their fill; and we returned to the sunny plains and the endless reaches of withered, rustling grass. At last, an hour or two before sunset, when the heat had lxrgun a little to abate, wc spied half a dozen giraffes scattered a mile and a half ahead of us, feeding on the tops of the few widely separated thorn-trees. Cuninghame and I started toward them on foot, but they saw us when we were a mile away, and after gazing a short while, turned and went off at their usual rocking-horse canter, twisting and screwing their tails. We mounted and rode after them. I was on my zebra-shaped brown horse, which was hardy and with a fair turn of speed, and which by this time 1 had trained to be a good hunting horse. On the right were two giraffe which eventually turned out to be a big cow followed by a nearly full- African Game Trails 23 grown young one; but Cuninghame, scan- ning them through his glasses, and misled by the dark coloration, pronounced them a bull and cow; and after the big one I went. By good luck we were on one of the rare pieces of the country which was fitted for galloping. 1 rode at an angle to the giraffe s line of flight, thus gaining con- siderably; and when it finally turned and went straight away 1 followed it at a fast run, and before it was fully awake to the danger I was but a hundred yards behind. We were now getting into bad country, and jumping off 1 opened fire and crippled the great beast. Mounting, I overtook it again in a quarter of a mile and killed it. In half an hour the skinners and porters came up one of the troubles of hunting as a naturalist is that it necessitates the presence of a long tail of men to take off and carry in the big skins, in order that they may ultimately appear in museums. In an hour and a half the giraffe s skin, with the head and the leg bones, was slung on two  K les; eight porters bore it, while the others took for their own use all the meat they could carry. They were in high good-humor, for an abundant supply of fresh meat always means a season of re- joicing, and they started campwards sing- ing loudly under their heavy burdens. While the giraffe was l cing skinned we had seen a rhinoceros feeding near our line of march campwards, and had watched it un- til the light grew dim. By the time the skin was ready night had fallen, and we started under the brilliant moon. It lit up the entire landscape; but moonlight is not sunlight, and there was the chance of our stumbling on the rhino unawares, and of its charging; so I rode at the head of the column with full-jacketed bullets in my rifle. However, we never saw the rhino, nor had wc any other adventure; and the ride through the moonlight which softened all the harshness, and gave a touch of magic and mystery to the landscape, was so pleasant that I was sorry' when we caught the gleam of the camp-fires. Next day we sent our porters to bring in the rest of the giraffe meat and the ostrich eggs. The giraffe s heart was good ealing. There were many ticks on the giraffe, as on all the game hereabouts, and they annoyed us a little also, although very far from being the plague they were on the Athi plain. Among the flies which at times tormented the horses and hung around the game, were big gadflies with long wings folded longi- tudinally down the back, not in the ordinary fly fashion; they were akin to the tsetse flies, one spccies of which is fatal to do- mestic animals, and another, the sleeping- sickness fly, to man himself. They pro- duce death by means of the fatal microbes introduced into the blood by their bite; whereas another African fly, the seroot, found more to the north, in the Nile coun- tries, is a scourge to man and beast merely because of its vicious bite, and where it swarms may drive the tribes that own herds entirely out of certain districts. One afternoon, while leading my horse because the ground was a litter of sharp- edged stones, I came out on a plain which was crawling with zebra. In every direc- tion there were herds of scores or of hun- dreds. They were all of the common or small kind, except three individuals of the big kangani, and were tame, letting me walk by within easy shot. Other game was mixed in with them. Soon, walking over a little ridge of rocks, we saw a rhino sixty yards off. To walk forward would give it our wind; I did not wish to kill it; and 1 was beginning to feel, about rhino, the way Alice did in Looking Glass country, when the elephants  did bother so.  Hav- ing spied us the beast at once cocked its ears and tail, and assumed its usual absurd resemblance to a huge and exceedingly alert and interested pig. But with a rhino tragedy sometimes treads on the heels of comedy, and I watched it sharply, my rifle cocked, while I had all the men shout in unison to scare it away. The noise puz- zled it much; with tail erect and head toss- ing and twisting, it made little rushes hither and thither, but finally drew off. Next day, in shifting camp, Cuninghame and I were twice obliged to dismount and keep guard over the safari while it marched by within a hundred yards of a highly puzzled rhino, which trotted to and fro in the bush, evidently uncertain whether or not to let its l ewildermcnt turn into indignation. The camp to which we thus shifted was on the banks of the Guaso Nyero, on the edge of an open glade in a shady grove of giant mimosas. It was a beautiful camp, and in the soft tropic nights 1 would sit out- side my tent and watch the full moon rising 24 African Game Trails through and above the tree-tops. There was absolutely no dew at night, by the way. 'I he Guaso Nyero runs across and along the equator, through a desert country, east- ward into the dismal Lorian swamp, where it disappears, save in very wet seasons, when it continues to the Tana. At our camp it was a broad, rapid, muddy stream infested with crocodiles. Along its banks grew groves of ivory-nut palms, their fronds fan- shaped, their tall trunks forked twenty or thirty feet from the ground, each stem again forking something like the antlers of a black-tail buck. In the frond of a small palm of this kind we found a pale-colored, very long-tailed tree mouse in its nest, which was a ball of chopped straw. Spurfowl and francolin abounded, their grating cries being heard everywhere; I shot a few as well as one or two sandgrousc; and with the rifle I knocked off the heads of two guinea fowls. The last feat sounds belter in the narration than it was in the performance; for I wast- ed nearly a beltful of cartridges in achieving it, as the guineas were shy and ran rapidly through the tall grass. I also expended a large number of cartridges before securing a couple of gerunuk; the queer, long-legged, long-necked antelope were wary, and as soon as they caught a glimpse of me off they would go at a stealthy trot or canter through the bushes, with neck outstretched. They had a curious habit of rising on their hind legs to browse among the bushes; I do not remember seeing any other antelojie act in this manner. There were water-buck along the river banks, and I shot a couple of good bulls; they belonged to the southern and eastern species, which has a light-colored ring around the rump; whereas the western form, which I saw at Naivasha, has the whole rump light-colored. They like the neighborhood of lakes and rivers. 1 have seen parties of them resting in the open plains during the day, under trees which yielded little more shade than telegraph  K les. The handsome, shaggy-coated wa- ter-buck has not the high withers which mark the oryx, wildebeeste. and hartebeeste, and he carries his head and neck more like a stag or a wapiti bull. One day we went back from the river after giraffe. It must have been a year since any rain had fallen. The surface of the baked soil was bare and cracked, the sparse tussocks of grass were brittle straw, and the trees and bushes were leafless; but instead of leaves they almost all carried thorns, the worst being those of the wai - a bit, which tore our clothes, hands, and faces. We found the giraffe three or four miles away from the river, in an absolutely waterless region, densely covered with these leafless wait-a-bit thorn bushes. Hanging among the bare bushes, by the way, we roused two or three of the queer, diurnal, golden-winged, slate-colored bats; they flew freely in the glare of the sunlight, mind- ing it as little as they did the furnace-like heat. We found the really dense wait-a-bit thorn thickets quite impenetrable, whereas the giraffe moved through them with utter unconcern. But the giraffe s indifference to thorns is commonplace compared to its indifference to water. These particular giraffe were not drinking either at the river or at the one or two streams which were running into it; and in certain places giraffe will subsist for months without drinking at all. How the waste and evaporation of moisture from their huge bodies is sup- plied Ls one of the riddles of biology. We could not get a bull giraffe, and it was only a bull that 1 wanted. I was much in- terested, however, in coming up to a cow asleep. She stood with her neck drooping slightly forward, occasionally stamping or twitching an ear, like a horse when asleep standing. I saw her legs first, through the bushes, and finally walked directly up to her in the open, until I stood facing her at thirty yards. When she at last suddenly saw me, she came nearer to the execution of a gambol than any other giraffe 1 have ever seen. Another day we went after the buffalo We left camp before sunrise, riding along parallel to the river to find the spoor of a herd which had drunk and was returning to the haunts, away from the river, in which they here habitually spent the day. Two or three hours passed before we found what we sought; and we at once began to follow the trail. It was in open thorn bush, and the animals were evidently feeding. Before we had followed the spoor half an hour we ran across a rhinoceros. As the spoor led above wind, and as we did not wish to leave it for fear of losing it, Cuninghame stayed where he was, and I moved round to within fifty yards of the rhino, and, with my rifle ready, began shouting, trying to keep the A mixed herd      Iicvv s and llurchcU'  xebra .

At last I succeeded, and he trotted sullenly off, tacking and veering, and not going far. On we went, and in another half-hour came on our quarry. I was the first to catch a glimpse of the line of bulky black forms, picked out with white where the sun glinted on the horn bosses. It was ten o'clock, a hot, windless morning on the equator, with the sun shining from a cloudless sky; yet these buffalo were feeding in the open, miles from water or dense cover. They were greedily cropping the few tufts of coarse herbage that grew among the sparse thorn bushes, which here were not more than two feet high. In many places buffalo are purely nocturnal feeders, and do not come into the hot, bare plains in the scorching glare of daylight; and our experience with this herd illustrates afresh the need of caution in generalizing about the habits of game. We crept toward them on all-fours, hav ing left the   orters hidden from sight. At last we were within rather long range  a buffalo s eyesight is good, and cannot be trilled with as it he were a rhino or Vol. XLVtll 3 l y Kctmit  vQ Kt jt. elephant and cautiously scrutinized the herd through our glasses. There were only cows and perhaps one or two young bulls with horns no bigger than those of cows. I would have liked another good bull s head for myself; but I also wished another cow for the museum. Before I could shoot, however, a loud yelling was heard from among the porters in our rear: and away went the buffalo. Full of wrath, we walked back to inquire. We found that one porter had lost his knife, and had started back to look for it, accompanied by two of his fel- lows, which was absolutely against orders. They had come across a rhino, probably the one I had frightened from our path, and had endeavored to avoid him; but he had charged them, whereu  on they scattered. He overtook one and tossed him, goring him in the thigh; whereupon they came back, the two unwounded ones supporting the other, and all howling like lost souls. I had some crystals of permanganate, an antiseptic, and some cotton in my saddle pocket; Cuninghame tore some of the lin- ing out of his sleeve for a bandage; and we fixed the man up and left him with one companion, while we sent another in to camp to fetch out a dozen men with a 25 20 African Game Trails led into some scant cover. Here the first thing we did was to run into another rhi- noceros. It was alxmt sev- enty yards away, behind a thorn-tree, and began to move jerkily and abruptly to and fro, gazing toward us.  Oh, you malevolent old idiot.  I muttered, The i i'.ufco Nyero. I    i i jilit  i 2ni ili by ThewJnru fcvids. ground-sheet and some poles, to make a litter in which the wounded man could be carried. While we were engaged in this field surgery another rhino was in sight half a mile off. Then on we went on the trail of the herd. It led straight across the open, under the blazing sun; and the heat was now terrific. At last, almost exactly at noon. Cuning- hame. who was leading, stopped short. He had seen the buffalo, which had halted, made a half-bend backwards on their tracks, and stood for their noonday rest among some scattered, stunted thorn-trees, leafless and yielding practically no shade whatever. A cautious stalk brought me to within a hundred and fifty yards. I merelv wounded the one I first shot at, but killed another as the herd started to run. Leav- ing the skinners to take care of the dead animal, a tine cow, Cuninghame and I started after the herd, to see if the wounded one had fallen out. After a mile the trail facing it with rifle cocked; then, as it did not charge, I added to Cuninghame, "Well, I guess it will let us by, all right.  And let us by it did. We were anx- ious not to shoot it. both because in a country with no settlers a rhino rarely does harm, and 1 object to anything like needless butchery, and furthermore l ecause we desired to avoid alarming the buffalo. Half a mile farther on we came on the latter, apparently past their fright. We looked them carefully over with our glasses; the wounded one was evidently not much hurt, and therefore I did not wish to kill her, for 1 did not need another cow; and there was no adult bull. So we did not molest them: and after a while they got our wind and went off at a lumbering gallop. Returning to the dead cow, we found the skin ready and marched back to i amp, reaching it just as the moon rose, at seven; we had l een away thirteen hours, with nothing to eat and only the tepid water in our canteens to drink.  Ve were in the country of the Samburu, and several of their old men and warriors visited us at this camp. They are cattle- owning nomads like the Masai; but in ad- dition to cattle, sheep, and goats they own herds of camels, which they milk but do not use as beasts of burden. In features they are more like Somalis than negroes. Near this camp was the remains of the boma or home camp of Arthur Neuman, once the most famous elephant hunter be- tween the Tana ami Lake Rudolf. Neu- man, whose native name was Nyama Yango. was a strange, moody man who African Game Trails Ivory rml p lm- on the Guh o Nycrv Fmn   iihoti npli by Theodore kooscidL died by his own hand. He was a mighty hunter, of bold ami adventure-loving temper. With whites he was unsocial, living in this far-off region exactly like a native, and all alone among the natives: living in some respects too much like a na- tive. Rut, from the native stand-point, and without making any effort to turn the natives into anything except what they were, he did them good, and left a deep impression on their minds. They talked to us often aliout him, in many different places; they would not believe that he was dead; and when assured it was so they showed real grief. At Meru Boma, when we saw the Meru tribesmen dance, one of the songs they sung was:  Since Nyama Yango came, our sheep graze un- touched by the Samburu and, rather curiously, the Samburu sing a similar song reciting how he saved them from the fear of hav- ing their herds raided by the nomads far- ther north. After leaving this camp we journeyed up the Guaso Nyero for several days. The current was rapid and muddy, and there were lieds of reeds and of the tall, graceful papyrus. The country roundabout was a mass of stony, broken hills, and the river wound down among these, occasionally cutting its way through deep gorges, and its course being continually broken by rapids. Whenever on our hunts we had to cross it, we shouted and splashed and even lired shots, to scare the crocodiles. I shot one on a sandbar in the river. The man the rhino had wounded was carried along on a litter with the safari. Sometimes I left camp with my sais and gunbearer l efore dawn, starting in the light of the waning moon, and riding four or five hours before halting to wait for the safari; on the way I had usually shot something for the table a water-buck. impalla, or gazelle. On another occasion C'uninghame and I sj ent the day hunting in the waterless country, back of the river, where the heat at mid-day was terrific. We might not reach camp until after nightfall. Once, as we came to it in the dark, it seemed as if ghostly arms stretched above it: for the tents were under trees up which huge rub- ber vines had _clim  ed, and their massive dead-white trunks and branches glimmered pale and ghostly in the darkness. Twice my gunbearers tried to show me a cheetah; but my eyes were too slow to catch the animal l cforc it bounded off in safety among the bushes. Another time, after an excellent bit of tracking, the gun- bearers brought me up to a buffalo bull, standing for his noonday rest in the leafless thorns a mile from the river. I thought I held the heavy Holland straight for his shoulder, but i must have fired high: for though he fell to the shot he recovered at once.    e followed the blood sjioor for an Camp In iljorti jgrx'ivc by   11  0 Nyero rage 23. a   y K. .1. tIuinii  m:oc. hour, the last part of the time when the trail wandered among and through the heavy thickets under the trees on the river banks; here I walked Ix'side the tracker with my rifle at full cock, for we could not tell what instant we might be charged. But his trail finally crossed the river, and as he was going stronger and stronger we had to abandon the chase. In the water less country, away from the river, we found little except herds of zebra, of l oth kinds, occasional oryx and eland, and a few gi- raffe. A stallion of the big kangani zebra which I shot stood fourteen hands high at the withers and weighed about eight hun- dred and thirty jxmnds, according to the Seton beam. I shot another kangani just at nightfall, a mile or so from camp, as it drank in a wild, tree-clad gorge of the river. 1 was alone, strolling quietly through the dusk, along the mar- gin of the high banks by the stream, and saw a mixed herd of zebras coming down to a well-worn drink- ing-place, evidently much used by game, on the op x sitc side of the river. They were alert and ner- vous. evidently on the lookout for Ixith lions and crocodiles. I singled out the largest, the leader of the troop, and shot it across the stream; I have rarely taken a shot among more picturesque sur- roundings.

I'mm a   Snto t  .l  hy Tlieoilnrc KooMVtlt  At our final camp on the river, before leaving it on our week s steady trek south- ward to Neri, we found a spot in which game abounded. It was about ten miles back from the river, a stretch 01 plains sparsely covered with thorn-trees, broken by koppies, and bounded by chains of low, jagged mountains, with an occasional bold, isolated peak. The crags anti cliff walls were fantastically carved and channelled by the weathering of ages in that dry cli- mate. It was a harsh, unlovely spot in the glare of the hot daylight; but at sun- set it was very lovely, with a wild and stern beauty. Here the game abounded, and was not wary. Before starting out on our week s steady marching I wished to give the safari a good feed; and one day I shot them live zebra and an oryx bull, together with a couple of gazelle for ourselves and our im- mediate attendants enough of the game being hallalled to provide for the Moham- medans in the safari. I also shot an old bull giraffe of the northern form, after an uneventful stalk which culminated in a shot with the Winchester at a hundred and seventy yards. In most places this partic- ular stretch of country was not suitable for galloping, the ground being rotten, filled with holes, and covered with tall, coarse grass. One evening wc saw two lions half a mile away: I tried to ride them, but my horse fell twice in the first hundred and fifty 29 P i  l in gorge.  Page . 5, I-rum x iib ito r.i  h troni K.  . irunlrt iuiik:. yards and I could not even keep them in sight. Another day we gut a glimpse of two lions, quarter of a mile off, gliding away among the thorns. They went straight to the river and swam across it. More sur- prising was the fact that a monkey, which lost its head when we surprised it in a tree by the river, actually sprang plump into the stream, and swam, easily and strongly, across it. One  lay we had a most interesting ex- perience with a cow giraffe. We saw her a long way off and stalked to within a couple of hundred yards before we could make out her sex. She was standing under some thorn trees, occasionally shifting her   osi- tion for a few yards, and then again stand- ing motionless with her head thrust in among the branches. She was indulging in a series of noon naps.. At last, when she stood and went to sleep again, I walked up to her, C'uninghame and our two gunliear- ers. Bakhari and Rongoni, following a hun- dred yards behind. W hen I was within 3  African Game Trails 31 forty yards, in plain sight, away from cover, she opened her eyes and looked drowsily at me; but I stood motionless and she dozed off again. This time I walked up to within ten feet of her. Nearer I did not care to venture, as giraffe strike and kick very hard with their hooves, and, moreover, occasionally strike with the head, the blow seemingly not be- ing delivered with the knobby, skin-covered horns, but with the front teeth of the lower jaw. She waked, looked at me, and then, rearing slightly, struck at me with her left fore leg, the blow, of course, falling short. I laughed and leaped back, and the other men ran up shout- ing. But the giraffe would not run away. She stood within twenty feet of us, looking at us peevishly, and occasion- ally moving her lips at us. as if she were making a face. We kept close to the tree, so as to dodge round it, under the branches, if she came at us; for we would have been most reluctant to shoot her. I threw a stick at her, hitting her in the side, but she paid no attention; and when Bakhari came behind her with a stick she turned sharply on him and he made a prompt retreat. We were laugh- ing and talking all the time. Then we pelted her with sticks and clods of earth, and, after hav- ing thus stood within twenty feet of us for three or four min- utes, she cantered slowly off for fifty yards, and then walked away with leisurely un- concern. She was apparently in the best of health and in perfect condition. She did not get our wind, but her utter indif- ference to the close presence of four men is inexplicable.

It was hot, and we neither had nor wished for food, and the tepid water in the canteens lasted us through. The day I shot the giraffe the porters carrying the skin fell behind, and never got in until next morning. Coming back in the late twilight a party of the big zebra, their forms shadowy and dim, trotted up to us, evidently attracted by the horses, and ac- companied us for some rods: and a hedge- hog, directly in our path, kept bleating loudly, like an antelope kid. The day we spent in taking care of the giraffe skin we, of course, made no hunt. However, in the afternoon I sauntered up- stream a couple of miles to look for croco- diles. I saw none, but I was much inter- ested in some zebra and water-buck. The zebra were on the opjiositc side of ihe river, standing among some thorns, and at three, mid-afternoon, they came down to drink: up to this time 1 had generally found zebra drinking in the evening or at night. Then I saw some water-buck. also on the oppo- site bank, working their way toward the 32 river, and seeing a well-marked drinking- place ahead I hastened toward it, and sal down in the middle of the broad game trail leading down to the water on my side. I s;it perfectly still, and my clothes were just the color of the ground, and the water-buck never noticed me. though I was in plain view when they drank, just opjiosite me, and only a1x ut fifty yards off. There were four cows and a bull. It was four o clock in the afternoon. The cows came first, one by one, and were very alerl and suspicious, each continually stopped and stood mo- tionless, or looked in every direction, and gave little false starts of alarm. When they reached the green  rass by the water s edge each cropjied a few mouthfuls, between times nervously raising its head and looking in every direction, nostrils and ears twitch- ing. They were not looking for crocodiles, but for land foes, lions or leopards. Each in turn drank, skipping up to ihe top of the bank after a few mouthfuls, and then re- turning to the water. The bull followed with rather less caution, and before he had finished drinking the cows scurried hur- African Game Trails 33 ricdly back to the thorn-trees and the open country. We had plenty of meat in camp, and I had completed my scries of this spe- cies of water-buck for the museum; and I was glad there was no need to molest them. The porters were enjoying the rest and the abundance of meat. They were lying alxmt camp or were scattered up and down stream fishing. When, walking back, I came to the outskirts of camp, I was at- tracted by the buzzing and twanging of the harp; there was the harper and two friends, all three singing to his accompaniment. I called   Yambo    greeting , and they grinned and stood up, shouting" Yambo  in return. In camp a dozen men were still at work at the giraffe skin, and they were all singing loudly, under the lead of my gun- bearer, Gouvimarli, who always acted as shanty man, or improvisatore, on such occasions. For a week we now trekked steadily south, across the equator, heel and toe marching, to Neri. Our first day s jour- ney took us to a gorge riven in the dry mountain. Half-way up it, in a side pock- et, was a deep pool, at the foot of a sloping sheet of rock, down which a broad, shallow dent showed where the torrents swept dur- ing the rains. In the trees arbund the pool black drongo shrikes called in bell- like tones, and pied hornbills flirted their long tails as they bleated and croaked. The water was foul, but in a dry country one grows gratefully to accept as water any- thing that is next. Klipspringers and ba- boons were in the sheer hills around; and among the rocks were hyraxes, looking like our Rocky Mountain conies or Little Chief hares, queer diurnal rats, and bright, blue- green lizards with orange heads. Rhinos drank at this pool; we frequently saw them on our journey, but always managed to avoid wounding their susceptibilities, and so escaped an encounter. Each day we endeavored to camp a couple of hours before sundown so as to give the men plenty of chance to get firewood, pitch the tents, and put everything in order. Some- times we would make an early start; in which case we would breakfast in the open while in the cast the crescent of the dying moon hung over the glow that her- alded the sunrise. As we reached the high, rolling downs the weather grew cooler, and many flowers ap  eared; those of the aloes were bright red, standing on high stalks above the clump of fleshy, spincd leaves, which were hand- somely mottled, like a snake s back. As I rode at the head of the safari I usually, in the course of the day. shot a buck of some kind for the table; I had not time to stalk, but simply took the shots as they came, generally at long range. One day I shot an eland, an old blue bull. Wc needed the skin for the museum, and as there was water near by we camped where we were; I I had already shot a water-buck, and this and the eland together gave the entire sa- fari a feast of meat. On another occasion an eland herd af- forded me fun, although no profit. I was mounted on Brownie, the zebra-shaped pony. Brownie would still occasionally run off when 1 dismounted to shoot  a habit that had cost me an eland bull ; but he loved to gallop after game. We came on a herd of eland in an open plain; they were directly in our path. We were in the coun- try where the ordinary, or Livingstone s eland, grades into the Patterson s; and I knew that the naturalists wished an addi- tional bull s head for the museum. So I galloped toward the herd; and for the next fifteen or twenty minutes I felt as if I had renewed my youth and was in the cow camps of the West, a quarter of a century ago. Eland are no faster than range cat- tle. Twice I rounded up the herd just as once in the Yellowstone Park I rounded up a herd of wapiti for John Burroughs to look at and three times I cut out of the herd a big animal, which, however, in each ease, proved to be a cow. There were no big bulls, only cows and young stock; but I en- joyed the gallop. From Neri we marched through mist and rain across the cold Aberdarc table lands; and in the forenoon of October 20 we saw from the top of the second Aberdare escarp- ment the blue waters of beautiful Lake Naivasha. On the next day we reached Nairobi.

The Sokokis Imilt their bark wigwams here and there on the hank, paddling their birt h canoes over the river s smooth sur- face, or threading the foamy torrents farther down its course. Here was the wonderful spring that fed, and still feeds, Aunt Judy s Brook, the most turbulent little stream in the county. Many a moccasin track has been made in the soft earth round the never-failing foun- tain, anti many the wooden bucket lowered into ils crystal depths by the Dalton Right- ers when in their turn they possessed the land. The day of the Indian was over now, and  he day of the farmer who succeeded him was over, too. The crash of the loom and the whirr of the spinning-wheel were heard 34 OT far from the village of Bonny Kagle, on the west hank of the Saco, stood two little low-roofed farm- houses; the only two that had survived among all those that hail once dotted the green brink of the river. Long years before, in 1705 or there- abouts, there had been a cluster of log houses on this very spot, known then as the Dalton Right Settlement, and these in turn had been succeeded at a later date by the more comfortable frame-roof farmhouses of the period. In the old days, before the sound of the axe for the first time disturbed the stillness of the forest, the otter swam in the shadowy coves near the shore anti the leaver built his huts near by. The red fleer came down to dip his antlers and ccol his tlanks in the still shallows. The speckled % The Turning Point 35 no longer, but Amanda Dallon, spinster  descendant of the original Tristram Dalton, to whom the claim belonged sat on alone in her house, and not far away sat Caleb Kimball, sole living heir of the original Caleb, himself a Dalton Righter, and con- temporary of Tristram Dalton. Neither of these personages look any interest in pedigree or genealogy. They knew that their ancestors had lived and died on the same acres now possessed by them, but the acres had dwindled sadly, and the ancestors had seemingly left little for which to be grateful. Indeed, in Caleb s case they had been a distinct disadvantage, since the local sense of humor, proverbially strong in York County, had always pre- served a set of Kimball stories among its most cherished possessions. Some of them might have been forgotten in the century and a half that had elapsed, if the Caleb of our story had not been the inheritor of certain family traits famous in their day and generation. Caleb the first, had been the  cuss  of his fellow farmers, l ecause in coming from Scarboro to join the Dalton Righters he had brought whitewced with the bundle of hay for his cattle when he was clearing the land. The soil of this particular region must have been especially greedy for, and adapted to, I his obnoxious grass-killer, for it flourished as in no other part of the county; flourishes yet, indeed though, if one could forget that its presence means no feed for cattle where might be a crop of juicy hay, the blossoming fields of the old Dalton Settlement look, in early June, the loveliest, most ethereal, in New England. There a million million feathery daisies sway and dance in the breeze, lifting their snowy wheels to the blue June sky. There they grow and thrive, the slender green stalks tossing their pearly disks among sis- ter groves of buttercups till the eye is fairly dazzled with the symphony of white and gold. The back-aching farmers of the orig- inal Dalton Settlement had indeed tried to root out the lovely pests, but little did our Caleb care  If he had ever trod his an- cestral acres either for pleasure or profit he might in time have  stomped out  the whitewced, so the neighbors said, for he had the family foot, the size of an anvil; but he much preferred a sedentary life, and the whiteweed went on seeding itself from year to year. Caleb was tall, loose-jointed, and black as a thunder cloud, the swarthy skin, like the big fool, having Ijeen bequeathed to him Hour after hour he sal on the wde steps. Page 36. 3G The Turning Point by the original Caleb, whose long-legged, shaggy-haired sons had been known as  Caleb s colts.  Tall and black, all of them, the  colts,  so black that the village wits said the Kimball children must have eaten smut and soot and drunk cinder tea during the years their parents were clearing the land. Tall and black also were all the Kimball daughters, so tall that it was their boast to be able to look out over the tops of the window curtains; and proud enough of their height to cry with rage when any rival Amazon came into the neighborhood. Whatever else they were or were not, however, the Kimballs had always been industrious and frugal. It had remained for the last scion of the old stock to furnish a by-word for slackness. In a village where stories of outlandish, uhgodly, or su  er- natural laziness were sacredly preserved from year to year, Caleb Kimball s indo- lence easily took the palm. His hay com- monly went to seed in the field. His cow yielded her morning s milk about noon, and her evening  mess  was taken from her  when she was lucky  by the light of a lantern. He was a bachelor of forty-five, dwelt alone, had no visitors, and made his living, such as it was, oil the farm, with the help of a rack-o -bones horse. He had fifty acres of timber land, and when his easy-going methods of farming found him without money he simply sold a few trees. The house and barn were gradually fall- ing into ruins; the farm implements stood in the yard all winter, and the sleigh all summer. The gate flapped on its hinges, the fences were broken down, and the stone walls were full of gaps. His pi  e, and a snarling rough-haired dog, were his only companions. Hour after hour he sat on the side steps looking across the sloping meadows that separated his place from Amanda Dalton s; hour after hour he puffed his pipe and gazed on the distant hills and the sparkling river; gazed and gazed whether he saw anything or thought anything, remembered anything, or even dreamed anything, nobody could guess, not even Amanda Dalton, who was good at guessing, having very few other mental recreations to keep her mother wit alive. Caleb Kimball, as seen on his doorstep from Amanda Dalton s sink window, was but a speck to be sure, but he was her nearest neighbor; if a person whose thresh- old you never cross, and who never crosses vours, can be called a neighbor. There were seldom or never meetings or greetings between the two, yet each unconsciously was very much alive to the existence of the other, for in days or evenings of solitude one can make neighbors of very curious things. The smoke of Amanda s morning fire cried  shame  to Caleb s when it issued languidly from his kitchen chimney an hour later. Amanda s smoke was like herself, and betokened the brisk fire she would be likely to build; Caleb s showed wet wood,  K or draught, a fallen brick in the chimney. Later on in the morning Caleb s dog would sometimes saunter down the road and have a brief conversation with Aman- da s cat. They were neither friends nor enemies, but merely enlivened a deadly dull existence with a few casual remarks on current topics. Once Caleb had possessed a flock of hens, but in the course of a few years they had dwindled to one lonely rooster, who stalked gloomily through the wilderness of misplaced objects in the Kimball yard, and wondered why he had been born. Amanda pitied him, and Hung him a surreptitious handful of corn from her apron pocket when she met him walking dejectedly in the road half way between the two houses. So encouraged he extended his rambles, and one afternoon Amanda, looking out of her window, saw him stop at her gate anti holtl a tftc-a-tete with one of her Plymouth Rock hens. The inter- view was brief but effective. In a twink- ling he had told her of his miserable life and his abject need of sympathy.  There are times,  he said,  when I give you my word, 1 would rather be stewed for dinner than lead my present existence  It is weak for me to trouble you with my difficulties, but you have always understood me from the first.   Say no more,  she replied.  I am a woman and pity is akin to love. The fowls of Amanda Dalton s flock do not need me as you do. Eleven eggs a day are laid here regularly, and I will go where my egg will be a daily source of pleasure and profit.   The coop is draughty and the corn scarce, confessed the rooster, doing his best to be noble. Amanda had nobody co consider but the cat.  I am of the sex created especially to supply companionship,  returned the hen,   therefore I will accompany you regardless of personal inconvenience.  Amanda saw the departure of the eloping couple and pursued them not.  Land sakcs   she exclaimed, "if any male thing hereabouts has sprawl enough to go courtin  I m willin  to encourage  em. She'll miss her clean house and good food, I guess, but I ain t sure. She s women folks after all, and 1 shouldn t wonder a mite but she d take real com- fort in makin  things pleasanter up there- for that pindlin  God-forsaken old rooster  She ll have her hands full, but there, I know what  tis to get along with empty ones   There were not many such romances or comedies as these to enliven Amanda's mornings. Then afternoon would slip into twilight, darkness would creep over the landscape, and Amanda s light clear, steady, bright, serene would gleam from its place on the sink shelf through the kitchen window, over the meadow,   up to Kimball's.  It was such a light as would stream from a well-trimmed lamp with a crystal clean chimney, but it met with small response from its neighbor s light during many months of the year. In late autumn and winter there would be a fu- gitive candle gleam up-stairs in the Kim- ball house, and on stormy evenings a dull, smoky light in the living-room. From the illumination in the Dalton sink window Caleb thought Amanda sat in the kitchen evenings, but she didn t. She said she kept the second light there because she could afford it, and because the cat liked it. The cat enjoyed the black haircloth sofa in the sitting-room, afternoons, but he greatly preferred the kitchen for even- ing use; it made a change and the high- backed cushioned rocker was then vacant. Amanda had nobody to consider but the cat, so she naturally deferred to him in every possible way. It was bad for the cat s character, but at least it kept Amanda from committing suicide, so what would 37 38 The Turning Point you  Here was a woman of insistent, un- flagging, unending activity. Amanda Dal- ton had energy enough to attend to a hus- band and six children cook, wash, iron, churn, sew, nurse and she lived alone with a cat. The village was a mile, and her nearest female neighbor, the Widow Thatcher, a half mile away. She had buried her only sister in Lewiston years before, and she had not a relation in the world. All her irrepressible zeal went into the conduct of her house and plot of ground. Day after day, week after week, year after year, the established routine was carried through. First the washing of the break- fast dishes and the putting to rights of the kitchen, which was radiantly clean before she began upon it. Next her bedroom; the stirring up of the cornhusk mattress, the shaking of the bed of live geese feathers, the replacing of cotton sheets, homespun blankets, and blue and white counterpane. Next the sitting-room with its tall, red,  lag-bottomed chairs, its two-leaved table, its light stand that held the Bible and work- basket and lamp. The chest of drawers and tall clock were piously dusted, and the frames of the family register,  Na  olcon Crossing the Alps,  and  Maidens Wel- coming Washington in the Streets of Alex- andria,  were carefully wiped off. Once a week the parlor was cleaned, the tarlatan was lifted from the two plaster Samuels on the mantelpiece, their kneeling forms were cleaned with a damp cloth, the tarlatan replaced, and the parlor closed again rever- ently. There was kindling to chop, wood to bring in, the modest cooking, washing, ironing, and sewing to do, the flower beds to weed, and the little vegetable garden to keep in order. But Amanda had a quick foot, a neat hand, and light touch, and a peculiar faculty of "turning off" work so that it simply would not last through the day. Why did she never think of going to the nearest city and linking her powers with those of some one who would put them to larger uses  Simply lw cause no one did that sort of thing in Bonny Kagle in those days. Girls crowded out of home by poverty sought employment here and there, but that a woman of forty, with a good home and ten acres of land to say - nothing of coupon l nnds that yielded a hundred dollars a year in cash "that such a one should seek a larger field in a strange place would have been thought flying in the face of Providence as well as custom. Outside Bonny Kagle, in the roar and din and clamor of cities, were all sorts of wrongs that needed righting, wounds that cried out to be healed. There were mother- less children, there were helpless sufferers moaning for the sight of a green field; but the sujKrrlluous females of Amanda Dal- ton s day had not awakened to any sense of responsibility with regard to their unknown brothers and sisters. Amanda was a large- hearted woman. She would have shared her soda biscuit, her bean soup, her dande- lion greens, her hogshead cheese, her boiled dinner, her custard pie, with any hungry mortal, but no one in Bonny Kagle need- ed bite nor sup. Therefore she feather- stitched her dish-towels, piled her kindling in a wheel pattern in the shed, named her hens and made friends of them, put four- teen tucks in her unbleached cotton petti- coats, and fried a pancake every Saturday for her cat.   It s cither that or blow your brains out, if you ve got a busy mind   she said grim- ly to Susan Benson, her best friend, who was passing a Saturday afternoon with her. It was chilly and they liked the cheerful warmth of the Saturday fire that was bak- ing the beans and steaming the brown bread. Susan unrolled her patchwork and, giv- ing a flip to the cat with her thimble finger, settled herself comfortably in the kitchen rocker. The cat leaped down and went into the next room with an air of offended maj- esty, as much as to say:  Of all the man- ners I ever saw, that woman has the worst  She must pass by three empty chairs and choose the one I chance to be occupying    You wouldn t be so lonesome if you could see a bit of life from your house, Mandy,  said Mrs. Benson.   William and I were saying last night you d ought to move into the village winters, though noth- ing could be handsomer than the view from your sink window this minute. Daisies, daisies everywhere  How do vou manage to keep em out o your place, Mandy, when they re so thick on Caleb Kimball s    I just root and root, anti keep on rooting, Amanda responded cheerfully,   though 1 don t take a mite o  pride out of The Turning Point 3i  it, for the better my place looks the worse his docs, by comparison.   It is a sight " said Mrs. Benson, stand- ing for a moment by the sink and looking up to Kimball's.  I went up there one night after dark, when I knew Caleb  d gone to Hiram, and I patched up some o  the holes in his stone wall, thinkin  his whiteweed seeds wouldn t blow through quite so thick   and Amanda joined Mrs. Benson at the window.  I d  a  done a day s work on his side o  the wall as lief as not, only I knew folks would talk if they saw me.   Land, no they wouldn t, Mandy. Everybody knows you wouldn t take him if he was the last man on earth, and as for Caleb, 1 guess he wouldn t marry any woman above ground, not if she was a seraphim. I used to think he d spunk up some time or other, when he got over his mother s death; but it s too late now, I m afraid.   Caleb set great store by his mother: that s one good thing about him,  said Amanda.  He did for certain,  agreed Mrs. Ben- son.  If that girl he was engaged to hadn t  a  spoken disrespectful to her in his hearing there d  a  been a wife and children up there now and the placc would  a  looked dif- frent.   Not so very diff rent  He didn t lose much in Eliza Johnson. I guess he knows that by now   remarked Amanda severely;  though I  spose  twas quarrellin  with her that set him runnin  down hill all the same.    I never thought he cared anything about her. She was determined to have him, and he was too lazy to say no, but you see in the end she only got her labor for her pains. The Kimball boys never had any luck with their love affairs. When Caleb and his mother was left alone she was terrible anxious for him to marry. She was allers findin  girls for him, but part of  em would, n t look at him, and he wouldn't make up to any of  em.   I was living at Lewiston those years," said Amanda.  I remember you was. Well, when old Mrs. Kimball broke her arm, Charles', the youngest son, that svas a stage driver, determined he d get. someltody for Caleb,, for his own wife wouldn t leave home, nor lift her finger to help  bout the house. He saw a girl up to Steep Falls that he kind o  liked the looks of, and he of- fered her a ride down to his mother s to sj enfl the day, think- in  if the family liked her she might do for Caleb. However, her eyes was weak and she didn t know how to milk, so they thought she d better go home by train. That would  a  been right enough for both parties, but when Charles drove her to the station he charged her fifteen cents, and it made an awful sight o  talk. She had a hot temper, and she kind o  resented it "  I dare say  twa nt so,  commented Amanda; "but everybody s dead that could deny it, except Caleb, and he would- n t take the trouble.   It s one of the days when he s real drove; ain t it   asked Susan sarcastically, as she looked across the field to the wood- pile where a gray-shiried figure sat motion- less.  If ever a man needed a wife to patch the seat of his pants, it s Caleb Kim- ball  I guess it s the only part of his clothes he ever wears out. He wa n t like that before his mother died; the wheels seemed to stop in him then and there. He was queer and strange and shy, but I never 40 The Turning Point used to think 'he d develop into a reg lar hermit. She d turn in her grave, Mis  Kim- ball would, to see him look as he does.

They say women folks ain t got no sense o  humor,  remarked Mrs. Benson, with a twitch oi her thread.   1 notice the men that live without  em don t seem to have any  We may not amount to much, but we re something to laugh at.   Why don't you bake him a pie now and then, and send it up, Susan   asked Amanda.  Well, there, I don't feel I hardly know him well enough, though William does. 1 dare say he wouldn t like it, and he'd never think to return the plate, so far away.  Besides there never is an ex try pie in a house where there's a man and three boys; which reminds me I ve got to go home ar.d make one for breakfast, with nothing to make it out of.  "I could lend you a handful o  dried plums.   Thank you; I ll take  em and much obliged. I declare it seems to me, now the rhubarb s  l out gone, as if the apples on the trees never would till out enough to drop off.

Mrs. Thatcher lives half a mile away,  replied Amanda;  but I couldn t carry Caleb Kimball a pie without her know- in  it and makin  remarks. I d bake one and willin  if William d take it to him; but there,  twould only make him want another. He's made his bed and he s got to lie on it.   He lays on his'bed sure enough, and most o  the time probably but do you lielieve he ever makes it   Amanda shuddered.  I don't know, Susan; it s one o  the things that haunts me; whether he makes it or whether he don't.   Do you ever see any wash hung out   Mrs. Benson s needle stopped in mid air while she waited for Amanda s answer.  Ye-es; now and then.   What kind    Sheets; once a gray blanket; under- clothes; but naturally I don t look when they re hung out. He generally puts  em on the grass, anyway.    Well, it s a sin for a man to live so in a Christian country, and the kindest thing to say about him is that he s crazy. Some o  the men folks over to the store declare he is crazy ; but William declares he ain t. He says he s asleep. William kind o  likes him. Does he ever pass the time o  day with you    Hardly ever. I meet him once or twice a year, may be, in the road. He bows when 1 go past on an errand and holds on to his dog when he tries to run out and bite me.   That s real kind o  gentlemanly,  ob- served Susan.   I never thought oj it that way,  said Amanda absently;  but perhaps it is. All I can say is, Caleb Kimball s a regu- lar thorn in my flesh. I can t do anything for him. and 1 can't forget him, right un- der foot as he is his land joinin  mine. Mornin , noon, and night for years I've wanted to get into that man's house and make it decent for him; wanted to milk the cow the right time o  day; feed the horse; weed the garden; scrub the floor: wash the windows; black the stove.    How you do go on, Mandy    exclaimed Mrs. Benson.  What diff rence does it make to you how dirty he is, so long s you're clean     It does make a dilT rcnee, and it always will. I hate to see the daisies growin so thick, knowin' how he needs hay. 1 want to root  em out .same s 1 did mine, after I d been away three years in Lewiston. I hate to take my   ot o  beans out o' the oven Saturday nights and know he ain t had gumption enough to get himself a Chris- tian meal. Livin  alone s I do, Susan, things bulk up  in my mind bigger n they d ought to.   They do so,  agreed Susan;  and you mustn t let  em. You must come over to our house oftener. You know William loves to have you, and so do the boys. The Bible may insinuate we are our brother s keeper, but we can t none of us help it if he won t be kept  There, I must be get- tin  home. I ve had considerable many re- minders the last half hour that it s about time  It s none o  my business, Mandy, but you do spoil that cat, and the time s not far off when he won t be a mite o  comfort to you. Of course, I m too inti- mate here to take offence, but if the minis- ter should happen to set in this chair when he calls, and see that cat promenade round and round the rockers and then rustle off into the settin -room as mad as Cuffy. he d certainly take notice and think he wa n t a welcome visitor.    Like mistress, like cat   sighed Aman- da.  Tristram and I get awful set in our ways.   Kind o  queer, Mandy, namin  a cat for your grandfather,  Mrs. Benson ob- served anxiously as she oj ened the door.  William an  me don t want you to get queer.    I ain t got anything better to name for him,  said poor Amanda, in a lone that set her friend Susan thinking as she walked homeward. The summer wore along and there came a certain Tuesday different from all the other Tuesdays in that year, or in all the forty years that had gone before a Tues- day when the Kimball side door was not opened in the morning. No smoke issued from the chimney all day. The rooster anti his kidnapped hen flew up from the steps and pecked at the door panels vigorously. Seven o clock in the evening came, then eight, and no light to be seen anywhere. 42 The Turning Point The dog howled; the horse neighed; the cow lowed ominously in the closed l arn. At nine o clock Amanda took a lantern and sped across the field, found a pail in the shed, slipped into the barn, milked the cow, gave the beasts hay and water, and leaving the pail of milk on the steps, went quietly home again, anxious lest she had done too much, anxious also lest she had not done enough. Next morning she stationed herself at her kitchen window and took account of the signs. The milk-pail was overturned on the steps, the rooster and hen were perching on the rim, hut there was no smoke coming from the chimney. She thought quickly as she did everything else. She waited long enough to make a cup of coffee, then she slip  ed out of her door and up to Kimball s. Her apron was full of kindling, and on her arm she carried a bas- ket with a package of herbs, a tiny bottle of brandy, one of cologne, some arrowroot and matches, a cake of hard soap and a clean towel, some bones for the dog, and corn for the hen. Caleb s door was unlocked. The dog came out of the shed evincing no desire to bark or bite. The kitchen was empty, and she thanked the Lord silently, as she gave a hasty glance about not as dreadful as she had anticipated. Untidy beyond words, bare, dreary, cheerless, but not re- pulsively dirty. She stole softly through the lower part of the house, and then with a beating heart went up the uncarpeted stairs. At the head was an open door that showed her all she exacted and feared to find. The sun streamed in at the dusty, un- curtained window over the motionless body of Caleb Kimball, who lav in a strange, deep sleep, unconscious, on the bed. His At nine o'clock Amanda took a lantern milked the cvw, hair looked raven black against the pillow and the lashes on his cheekes were more n a yard long, Amanda told Susan Benson.  She afterward confessed that this was a slight exaggeration due to extreme agita- tion.  She spoke his name three times, but he did not stir. She must get the doctor and send for William Benson, that was clear; but first she must try her hand at im- proving the immediate situation. Stealing down-stairs she tied on her apron and lighted a fire in the kitchen stove, with the view of making things respectable be- fore gossipy neighbors came in. Her sister used to say that the minute Amanda tied on her apron things began to move and take a turn for the better, and it was so now. She poured a few drops of cologne into a basin of water, and putting the towel over her arm went up- stairs to Caleb s bed- side.   I  ve done him wrong,  she thought remorsefully as she noted his decent night clothing and bedding.  He ain t lost his self- respect in all these years, and every soul in Bonny Kagle thought he was living like an animal   She bathed his face and throat and hands, then moistened and smoothed his hair without provoking a movement or a sound. He seemed in a profound stuj or, but there was no stertorous breathing. Straighten- ing the bedclothes and giving a hasty wipe to the tops of the pine bureau and table, she opened the window and closed the blinds. At this moment she spied one of the Thatcher boys going along the road, and ran down to the gate to ask him to send VY illiam Benson and the doctor as soon as possible.   Tell them Miss Dalton says please to The Turning Point 43 come quick; Caleb Kimball s very sick,  she said.  Don t you need mother, too   asked the boy.  She s wanted to git into that house for years, and she d do most anything for the chance.   No, thank you,  said Amanda piti- lessly.   1 can do everything for the pres- ent, and Mr. Benson will probably want his wife, if anybody.   All right,  said the boy as he started off on a dog trot. News was rare in Bonny Kagle, and Caleb Kimball was a distin- guished and interesting figure in village gossip. Amanda Dalton had never had to hurry in her life. That was one of her crosses, for there probably never was a woman who could do more in less lime. It was an hour and a half before William Benson came, and in those ninety minutes she had swept the kitchen and poured a pail or two of hot soap-suds over the floor that may have felt a mop, but certainly had not known a scrubbing brush, for years. She tore down the fly-specked, tattered, buff shades, and washed the three windows; blackened the stove; fed the dog and horse; milked the cow; strained the milk and carried it down cellar; making three trips up- stairs in the meantime to find no change in the patient. His lids stayed down as though they were weighted with lead, his long arms lay motionless on the counter-- pane. Amanda s blood coursed through her veins like lightning. Here was work to her hand; blessed, healing work for days, per- haps weeks to come. In these first mo- ments of emotional excitement I fear she hoped it would be a long case of helpless invalidism, during which it would l e her Christian duty to clean the lower part of the house and perhaps make some impres- sion on the shed; but this tempting thought was quickly banished as she reflected that Caleb Kimball was a bachelor, and the Widow Thatcher the   erson marked out by an unscrupulous Providence for sick- nurse and housekeeper.  She shan t come   thought Amanda passionately.  I ll make the doctor ask me to take charge. William Benson shall stay here nights and Susan will run in now and then daytimes, or I'll get little Abby Thatcher to do the rough work and  TcJI them Mbs Dalton says please to come quick; CaJeb Kimball   very  ick.  Page 42. 44 The Turning Point keep me company; then her mother won t make talk.    I don't know exactly what s the matter with the man,  confessed the doctor, when he came.  There's a mark and a swelling on the back of his head as if he might have fallen somewhere. He hasn t got any pulse and he s all skin and bone. He s starved out. I guess, and his machinery has just stop  ed. He wants nursing and feeding and all the things a woman can do for him. The Lord never intended men folks to live alone   ' If they ain't got wit enough to find that out for themselves it ain t likely any wom- an ll take the trouble to tell  em   ex- claimed Amanda with some spirit.  Don't get stuffy, Amanda  Just be a good Christian and take hold here for a few days till we see whether we ve got to have a nurse from Portland. Man s ex- tremity is God s opportunity; may be Ca- leb  11 come to his senses before he gets over this sickness.   I wonder if he ever had any senses    said Amanda.   Plenty,  the doctor answered as he pre- pared the medicines;  but he hasn t used them for twenty years. I ll come back in an hour and fetch Bill Benson with me. Then I ll stay till I can bring Caleb back to con- sciousness. We shall have to get him down- stairs as soon as he can be moved; it will be-much easier to take care of him there.  The details of Caleb Kimball's illness would be such as till a nurse's bedside record book. The mainspring of life had been snapped and the machinery refused to move for a long time. When he recov- ered consciousness his solemn black eyes followed Amanda Dalton's movements as if fascinated, but he spoke no word save a faltering phrase or two at night to William Benson. Meantime much had been happening be- low stairs, where Amanda Dalton reigned supreme, with Susan Benson and Abby Thatcher taking turns in housework or nursing.  Y illiam Benson was n painter by trade, and Amanda s ingenious idea was to persuade him to paint and paper the Kim- ball kitchen before Caleb was moved down- stairs. This struck William as a most extraordi- nary and unnecessary performance.  Israel in Egypt   he exclaimed.  What s the matter with you women  I never heard o  such goin's on in my life  I might lay abed a thousand years and nobody d paint my premises. Let Caleb git his strength back and then use a little elbow grease on his own house you can t teach an old dog new tricks, Susan     Tends on how old the dog is, and what kind o  tricks you want to teach him," Susan replied.  It'd be a queer dog that wouldn t take to a clean kennel, or three good meals a day  stead o  starvation vit- tles. Amanda says it may be a kind of a turnin  point in Caleb s life, and she thinks we d ought to encourage him a little.   Ain t 1 encouragin  him by sleepin  on his settin -rooni lunge every night and givin  him medicine every two hours by the alarm clock   I ve got my own day s work to do; when would I paint his kitchen, I d like to know    We thought probably you d like to do it nights,  suggested his wife timidly.  Saul in Tarsus  Don t that beat the devil     ejaculated William.   Caleb Kim- ball ain t done a good day s work for years, and I'm to set up nights paintin  his kitchen   Nevertheless the magnificent impertinence of the idea so paralyzed his will that he ended by putting on twelve single rolls of fawn-colored paper and paint- ing the woodwork yellow to match, working from eight to twelve several nights and swearing freely at his own foolishness. By this time Amanda had made the down-stairs chamber all tidy and comfort- able for the patient. She had contributed a window shade and dimity curtains; Susan a braided rug and a chair cushion. The chamber  the one in which Caleb s mother had died  opened from the kitchen and commanded an enticing view of the fresh yellow walls and shining cook-stove. On the day before Caleb s removal Amanda sat on the foot of the waiting bed and looked through the doorway with silent joy, going to and fro to move a bright tin dipper into plainer view or retire a drying dish-cloth to greater privacy. Even Abby Thatcher was by this time a trifle exhilarated. She did not under- stand the situation very well, lieing of a sternly practical nature herself, but she caught the enthusiasm of the two women and scrubbed the kitchen floor faithfully The Turning Point 45 every morning in order to remove the stains of years of neglect.  You wouldn t think Caleb's hen d he such an old fool, Miss Dalton,  she said;  but 1 kind o  surmised the reason she s been missin , and 1 found her to-day in a corner o  the haymow settin  on five eggs. Now-, wouldn t you s posc at her age she d know better than to try and raise chickens in October    I m afraid they ll die if it should be a cold fall, with nobody to look after  em; but maybe I can take  em home to my shed and lend Mr. Kim- ball another hen. I never like to break up a hen s nest, somehow; it seems as if they must have feel- in s like other folks.    I wouldn t mind her   din s; I d take her off quicker n scat, and keep takin  her off, till she got some sense,  said Abby, with the Chinese cruelty of youth.  Well, you let her be till Mr. Kimball gets well enough to ask; and I think, Abby, you might clean up the dooryard just a little mite this morning,  suggested Amanda.  If you could straighten up the fence and find a couple of old hinges to hang the gate with, it would kind of put new heart into Mr. Kimball when he s sit- ting up and looking out the window,   Why didn t he put heart into hisself hy hangin  his own gate, before he took sick     grumbled Abby, reducing Amanda to mo- mentary silence by her pitiless logic.  Why didn t he, indeed   echoed her heart gloomily, receiving nothing in the way of answer from her limited experience of men. Caleb had spoken more frequently the last few days. When by the combined ex- ertions of the Bensons and the doctor he had been brought down into his mother's old room, Amanda closed the kitchen door, thinking one experience at a lime was enough for a man in his weak and ex- hausted condition. William Benson could- n t see any sense in this precaution, but he never did see much sense in what women folks did. He wanted to show Caleb the new paint and paper immediately, and re- mark casually that he had done all the work while he was  night nursin ." The next morning Amanda had seized a good opjHjrtunitv to open the door ljetween the two rooms, straightway retir- ing to the side entry to await developments. In a few moments she heard Caleb moving, and going in found him half sitting up in bed. leaning on his elbow.  What's the matter with the kitchen   he asked feebly, staring with wide-open eyes at the un- accustomed prospect.  Only fresh paint and paper; that s William s work.   O God. I ain t worth it  I ain't worth it " the man groaned and hid his face in the pillow.  Have you been here all the time   he asked Amanda when she brought him his gruel later in the day.   Yes, off and on, when I could get away from my own work." "Who found me    I did. I knew by the looks something was wrong up here."  Something wrong, sure enough, and always was " Amanda heard him mutter as he turned his face to the wall. The next day he o x ned his eyes sud- denly as she was passing through the room. "Did you make that pie William Benson brought me last month   "  What made you think I did "  Oh. I don' know; it looked, and it tasted like one o  yours," he said, closing his eyes again. "If you know a woman, you know her pie, somehow   When had Caleb Kimball ever tasted any of her cooking  A mysterious remark, but everything he said sounded a trifle light- headed. Thb struck William as a most extraor- dinary and unnecessary per- formance   F a;  44 40 The Turning Point His questions came back to her when she was waiting for William Benson at twilight that same day. Caleb had been sleeping quietly for an hour or more. Amanda was standing at the stove stirring his arrowroot gruel. 'I he kitchen was still. A smothered  witaow  and the scratch- ing of claws on wood arrested her attention, and she went hurriedly to the door.  Tristram Dalton; what arc you up here for, away from your own home   she ex- claimed. Tristram vouchsafed no explanation of his appearance, but his demeanor spoke louder than words to Amanda s guilty con- science, as he walked in. "No shelter for me at home but the shed these days'.  he seemed to say. "Instead of well-served meals a cup of milk set here or there   l ie made the circuit of the strange kitchen discontentedly and finding nothing to his taste went into the adjoining room, and after walking over the full length of Ca- leb s prostrate form curled himself up in a hollow at the foot of the bed.  I ve neglected him   thought Amanda; "but his turn'll come again soon enough;  and she bent her eyes on the gruel. The blue bowl sat in the pan of hot water on the stove, and she stirred and stirred, slowly, regularly, continuously, in order that the arrowroot should be of a velvety smoothness. The days were drawing in. and the Oc- tolxrr sun was setting very yellow, sending a flood of light over her head and shoulders. She wore her afternoon dress of alpaca, with a worked muslin collar and t uffs and a white apron tied round her trim waist. She was one of your wholesome shining women and her bright brown hair glistened like satin. Caleb s black eyes looked yearningly at her as she stood there all unconscious, do- ing one of her innumerable neighborly kindnesses for him. She made a picture of sweet, strong, steady womanliness although she did not realize it. Caleb knew something extraor- dinary was going on inside of him, but under what impulse he was loo puzzled and inexperienced to say. "Amanda.  Amanda turned sharply at the sound of his voice as she was lifting the steaming arrowroot out of the water.  Whose cat is this    Mine. Come off that bed, Tristram     Don t disturb him; 1 like to have him there. Where s Abby Thatcher    She s gone home for the milk; she'll be back in fifteen minutes now.  "Where s William    It s only five o clock. He don t come till six. What can I get for you  Have you had a good sleep   She set the gruel on the back of the stove and went in to his bedside.   I don t sleep much; I just lie an  think . . .

I ve kind o  fancied you for years; but you ve always been way down there across the fields, out o  reach    I m too amazed to think it out,  fal- tered Amanda.  Don t you think it out, for God s sake, or you ll never do it   He caught at her hand as if it had been a life line her kind, smooth hand, the helpful hand with the bit of white cambric bound round a finger burned in his service.   It was the kitchen that put the courage into me,  he went on feverishly.  I laid here and thought:  If she can make a house look so different in a week, what could she do with a man      I ain't afraid but I could,  stammered Amanda;  if the man would help not hinder.  " J ust try me, Amanda. I wouldn t need a year honest, I wouldn t I could show you in three months   Caleb s strength was waning now. His head dropped forward and Amanda caught it on her breast. She put one arm around his shoulders to keep him from falling back, while her other hand sup  orted his head. His cheek was wet and as she felt the tears on her palm, mutely calling to her strength, all the woman in her gathered itself to- gether and rushed to meet the man s need. "Have you been here all the time  he avked  Page 45.  If only . . . you could take mo . . . now . . . right off,  he faltered;  before anything happens ... to prevent  I d be good to you . . . till the day I die    I ain't afraid to risk it, Caleb,  said Amanda with as little reflection as if she had been asked to subscribe to the minis- ter s salary.   I ll take you now when you need me the most. We ll just put our two forlorn houses together and see if wc can make  em into a home   Caleb gave one choking sob of content and gratitude. His hand relaxed its clasp of Amanda s; his head dropped and he fainted. William Benson came in just then.  What s the matter   he cried, coming quickly toward the bed.  Has he had a spell   He was so much better last night I expected to see him settin  up    He ll come to in a minute,  said Aman- da.  Give me the palm-leaf fan. We re going to be married to-morrow, and he got kind of excited talkin  it over.   Moses in the bulrushes   ejaculated William Benson, sitting down heavily in the nearest chair. William Benson was not a sentimental or imaginative person, and he confessed he couldn t make head nor tail out o  the affair; said it was the queerest and beatin- est weddin  that ever took place in Bonny Eagle; didn t know when they fixed it up, nor how, nor why, if you come to that. Amanda Dalton had never had a beau, but she was the likeliest woman in the village, spite o  that, and Caleb Kimball was the onlikeliest man. Amanda was the smart- est woman, and Caleb the laziest man. He kind o  thought Amanda d married Caleb so t she could clean house for him; but it seemed an awful high price to pay for a job. He guessed she couldn t bear to have his everlastin  whiteweed seedin  itself into her hayfield, and the only way she could stop it was to marry him and weed it out. He thought, too, that Caleb had kind o' got int  the habit of watchin  Mandy Ilyin  47 4S The Turning Point about down to her placc. There s nothing so fascinatin  as to set still and see other folks work. The critter was so busy, and so diff'rent from him. mebbe it kind o  tantalized him. The Widow Thatcher was convinced that Mandy must have gone for Caleb hammer  n  tongs when he was too weak to hold out against her. No woman in her sober senses would paper a man s kitchen for him unless she intended to get some use out of it herself.  We don t know what the disciples would  a  done,  she said,   nor the aj ostles, nor the saints, nor the archangels; we only know what women folks would  a' done, and there ain t one above ground that would  a  cleaned Caleb Kimball's house without she expected to live in it.  Susan Benson had a vague instinct with regard to the real facts of the case, but even she mustered up courage to ask Amanda once how-the wonderful matter came about. Amanda looked at Mrs. Benson with some embarrassment, for she was not good at confidences.  Susan, you and I've been brought up together, gone to school together, experi- enced religion and joined the church to- gether, and 1 stood up with you and William when you was married, so t I d speak out freer to you than 1 would to most.   I hof e so. I m sure.   Though I wouldn't want you to rejjeat anything, Susan.    Tain t likely I would, Mandy.   Well, I d no sooner got Caleb into a clean l ed and a clean room and begun lo feed him good food than I begun to like him. There s things in human hearts that I ain t wise enough to explain, Susan, and I ain t goin  to try. Caleb Kimball seemed to me like a man that was drownin', all becausc there wa n t anybody near to put a hand under his chin and keep his head out o  water. I didn t suspicion he d let me do it  I thought he d just lie there and drown, but it didn t turn out that way."  Well, it does kind o  seem as if you d gone through the woods o  life to pick up a crooked stick at last,  sighed Susan; "though I will say, now I ve been under Caleb Kimball s roof, he s an awful sight nicer man close to than he is fur off. So, take it all in all, life and men folks bein  so uncertain, and old age a creepin  on first thing you know, perhaps it s for the best; an  I do hope you ll make out to be happy, Mandy." There was a quiver of real feeling in Susan Benson s voice, though she made no movement to touch her friend s hand.  I m goin  to be happy 1  said Amanda cheerfully.   I always did like plenty to do, and now I ve got it for the rest o  my life    I only hope you can stan  his ways, Amandy,  and Susan s voice was still doubtful.  That s all I m afraid of; that you re so diff rent you can t never stan  his ways.   He won t have so many ways when we ve been married a spell,  said Amanda.

Hopkinson Smiiii SUPPOSE Venire is the one place in the world that does not change. Except for the vaporellt  little steamers  darting up and down the Grand Canal the place looked exactly the same as it did years ago when I first saw it, a beautiful fairy city rising out of the sea, all its domes and white marble palaces glistening in the moonlight. We arrived, too, this time at night, coming straight from Rome. We had had a long, tiring day and a very full train. The station at Venice was noisy and crowded with porters, hotel men, and bag- gage; just what one sees in any station in any large city. We followed the crowd down the long platform to the ttscila  way out , anti the transformation was instan- taneous when we emerged on the other side. Before us a large sheet of water, Vol. XLVIII. 5 hardly lighted, d  izens of gondolas a black mass at the steps, the silver lions on the arms of the seats shining out of the dark- ness. Our hostess had sent a servant to meet us, who took us to the boat, where two gondoliers, in dark blue with silver badges on their sleeves, were waiting.    ur small luggage  bags and wraps  was put in- to the boat behind us, and with some diffi- culty we made our way out from the crowd of gondolas into the open canal, the little waves making that curious bumping sound against the boat peculiar to gondolas. They are so long they never ride over the waves like ordinary' boats. One never sees them pitching, they seem to glide over the top of the water. As it was decidedly chilly I had put on my fur coat. The fclza  closed top  was on, and it was a curious sensation to l e shut up in the little black l ox, just seeing, through the glass door, 49 50 Venice A Sketch the tall figure of the gondolier swaying backward and forward. We turned almost at once out of the Grand Canal, and then began a mysterious progress through numbers of rios  small canals  to our destination. 1 had forgotten how extraordinarily unmodem and weird it was very dark, some of the canals so narrow one wondered what would hap  en if we met another gondola. No lights in any of the palaces we passed. Not a sound except the swish of the water over marl le steps, and a hoarse cry occasionally from our gondolier when we turned a comer. Once or twice we heard a cry, one sharp note from belvad, and a gondola passed us  a long, hi ck object disappearing in the darkness. It was such a wonderful change from the busy, bustling, crowded station we had just left into the darkness and stillness of the fantastic waterway we were following that I thought I must be dreaming, and would wake up in crowded streets with the rumble of carriages, the 1k-11s of the tram- ways, and Haring lights everywhere. We turned a last corner, the gondolier sounding his warning note rather vigorously, as we were coming back to the Grand Canal, where there is always a certain movement; the steamers run until midnight. We found ourselves opposite a fine large palace, brilliantly lighted, with high pointed windows and overhanging balconies. Sev- eral gondolas were waiting at the steps. An entertainment was evidently going on. The men brought us most skilfully around and inside the poles which one always sees in front of the Venetian palaces. They are painted the colors of the family, and the gondolas arc fastened t   them. Nothing in the shape of a boat-house exists in Venice; the gondolas lie in the canals tied to the poles. The doors were open, two or three servants and a nice Knglish maid were waiting in the hall. We crossed a broad vestibule with a Orascro  brazier  in the mid- dle. and went up a  light of steps into a line high hall. The mistress of the house came to meet us, saying it was her reception even- ing and she had a few friends; thought we would prefer going straight to our rooms as it was late 10.30; which, of course, we were very glad to do, being tired after our long joumey. We have charming rooms, communicating, upstairs, looking out on the Grand Canal. The maid brought us some supper. We told her to open the cur- tains and wooden shutters that we might look out and realize our surroundings. The canal is very broad in front of the palace, quite like an arm of the sea, with a decided ripple on its surface. There was very little light or movement at the steam- boat landing opposite. One small lantern was hanging over the steps. The steamer came along while we were looking out, so quietly one hardly heard it. Up and down as far as we could see there were rows of palaces; in the dim light one could just distinguish their white marble facades. Some gondolas passed, all with their black cabins moving noiselessly along   the gondolier a shadowy figure against the dark background. The next morning was beautiful, a bright sun and blue, dancing water. Dressing was difficult, as the windows offered dis- tractions of all kinds. Some of the palaces opposite were charming, but one was so black and dilapidated that it didn t seem possible as a residence from an outside view. However, there were curtains in the windows of the first floor  piano nobilc , as they call it in Italy, and a gondola tied to the poles, which were painted rather a bright blue or white. Boats of all sizes were passing gondolas. Some coming from the station filled with travellers, their luggage piled high in the open space be- hind the seats. Sandolos also, a narrow, pointed boat not so heavy as the gondola. Market l oats, broad and flat-bottomed, filled with vegetables, looking temptingly fresh and green. Steam launches, one or two evidently from yachts, with very trim- looking sailors on board. Directly opposite to our palace, close to the poles, a painter was established in a gondola with his easel and canvas. I fancy this house is painted very otten. It is one of the finest in Venice, and must look charming later in the season when all the flowers and cree  ers on the walls and gallery are in bloom. About 11 o'cloek we started for the Piazza, our lu stess telling us to keep the gondola, which would take us wherever we wanted to go and bring us back for luncheon at 1 o clock. We crossed the Jirand Canal and followed the usual wind- ing way of small ones. A great many gondolas were apparently doing the same thing, and it seemed impossible that we One realizes bow many irajjeOir  have happen     in those  i.yL, narrow canals: so easy to drop in an inconvenient rival :n love or politics  JPage 53. should not bump up against them, but we never did once. As wc came up to the Campo San Moist, with its ugly, very or- namented church quite the heaviest and most overdone Renaissance so many peo- ple were walking about and getting out of their gondolas, we thought il must be a back entrance of the Piazza, and were pa - paring to get out, but the gondoliers shook their heads, and a few more strokes of the paddle brought us back to the Grand Canal with the wide sweep of the lagoon before us. the Guidecca on one side, the Piazza San Marco and the Ri va degli Schiavoni with its long line of hotels on the other. An old man, with a badge on his arm, standing on the broad steps, helped us to land. These men are quite a feature of Venice. They are all old gondoliers a certain number allowed by the city. They are not at all necessary, as the gondoliers can perfectly well bring their boats to the steps, but no one grudges them the few sous they earn, and in the tourist season they make a fair sum, as strangers generally give more than the two sous which is the regular tariff in Venice. 5' 52 Venice  We wandered about the Piazza Air an hour; went into the Church of San Marco  I had forgotten how  me it stands looking from the op x site end of the Piazza , a gorgeous mass of color and gilding. Saw the pigeons all assembling in the middle of the Square waiting to be fed. Walked about under the Colonnades, past the clock tower and the well-known Cafe Florian. When we were first in Venice, in 1866, the Austrian rule was just coming to an end. All the Austrian garrison had left; there were only three or four belated white- coated officers who were taking theircoffee at 1'lorian s. scowled at by the entire popu- lation; and everywhere, in all the streets and canals, boys and girls, any one who could sing, were shouting, as loudly and as aggressively as possible, the  iaribaldi hymn, .1 basso it giallo cl ncro, viva il tri- color  " Down with the black and yellow  Austrian colors , and hurrah for the tri- color ;. They had only dared sing it be- fore in cellars or behind barred windows. We got back to the palace for luncheon and had our coffee in a charming veranda, shut in with glass and filled with flowers, directly over the canal. Then began a suc- A Sketch cession of enchanting days. Hours in the gondola, floating lazily along with nothing to do but to live and enjoy the passing moment. Some of the evenings, with the bright sunset clouds making a glorious background for the white dome of Santa Maria della Salute and a glimpse of the snow mountains in the distance, were too beauti- ful. One had always the sense of some- thing unreal that would suddenly collapse, and we would find ourselves back again in the ordinary workaday world. We had two or three cold, wintry days, once a heavy rain falling and the fog so thick when 1 got lip in the morning that I could not see the palaces opposite. How- ever, B. and 1 went down to the Piazza in a closed gondola, in which we were as well protected as in a shut carriage. Our um- brellas almost blew away when we crossed the Piazza, which was one large pond, it had rained so hard. We went over the Ducal Palace, which is not very interesting. The rooms are large and high, with some splen- did ceilings of Paul Veronese and his school. I found my way at once to the comer of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio, which has a frieze of portraits of doges all around it, n t dcretl the    .  rxj iux ati Ivotir Venice A Sketch 53 where a black panel replaces the portrait of Marino Falicro, beheaded while doge. It made a great impression upon me in my youthful days. I always remembered the black comer. I asked a very distinguished Italian professor, who was dining at the Palace one night, what Marino Falicro had done to deserve such a hard fate. I hail rather forgotten my Venetian history. Was he a traditorc  traitor    No. he said, only an innovatore  reformer , which was quite as bad in those days. When wc came out of the Palace it was still raining hard, and the Piazza with its gray, wet pavement looked exactly like the water beyond. There seemed nothing but gray water and gray sky before us. Wc had intended walking home by the back streets. We arc getting quite accustomed to them now and can find our way very well, but we had recollections of having seen people struggling with open umbrellas in the very narrow alleys, becoming at last hopelessly entangled, the points of the um   brellas in each other s eyes, and thought it would be wiser to call a gondola. As wc got to the steps the old man emerged from a refuge somewhere on the Piazza  which was absolutely deserted, not a creature visible anywhere , and helped us into the gondola. We were glad to creep into the little black cabin, which was dr ' and warm. We went out again in the afternoon. The rain had stopped, but there was still a very high wind, and the lagoon looked gray and stormy plenty of white horses. There were not many gondolas outside. Wc had thought we might go out a little toward the Lido, but the gondoliers re- monstrated. They could make no head- way against such a strong wind and tide. So wc made for one of the small canals and had some difficulty in getting around the comers, there were such sudden gusts of wind. The water streets are most interest- ing. It is so amusing to meet everything we are accustomed to see in carts and vans being transported by boats, and not very big ones. They must be narrow or they could not pass in the small canals. One day we saw the post-gondola being loaded  heavy leathern sacks thrown in from the steps; also furniture being moved a pi- ano and very fair-sized chest of drawers; in other boats pictures and mirrors, a block of marble, barrels, nets, bales of stuffs; Vol.. XI.VIII. 6 one day, a boat filled with birds in cages  parrots, I should think. We threaded our way in and out of the long procession of boats in the most extraordinary manner. The gondoliers, smiling and skilful, always finding room to pass in what seemed to us an impossible narrow passage. We see a great many people in this most hospitable house, where the life is abso- lutely different from the one the ordinary tourist leads in Venice. There are always people coming and going. The house is filled with beautiful things, pictures and furniture from all parts of Europe; the whole arranged with all the comfort and luxury of an English house. I am always fascinated by the sight when we come in from walking in the back streets. One emerges from narrow, dark alleys into a fine broad vestibule; at one end the gon- doliers  quarters; the other, with big doors  always open directly on the Canal, the little waves washing over the marble steps. I often sat on the steps, my feet just out of the water, looking at everything that passed and, when nothing passed, at the great, gloomy palaces opposite, and trying to im- agine the lives that had been lived behind those marble walls. There is always an undercurrent of sad- ness in Venice, in spite of the pleasure- loving summer city, with its gondolas tilled with women in bright dresses and flower, in their hands  I wonder where they come from, there arc so few gardens in Venice , and sounds of music and laughter floating over the lagoons. One realizes how many tragedies have happened in those dark, nar- row canals: so easy to drop in an incon- venient rival in love or politics. A tidal current from the lagoon changes the water every day, and the sea tells no tales. The Walks in the little back streets are a source of unending interest to me. There were pictures at every turn. Sometimes only a small fruit stall, with oranges, apples, bananas, and figs piled up in heaps and spread out on a board just outside a quaint, curiously carved doorway, and presided over by an old woman with bright black eyes and the inevitable black shawl on her shoulders. They are peculiar to Vcnice, those shawls; there arc hundreds of them hanging up in the shops on the Rialto and' in the Merceria.of all sizes and prices. The most expensive ones are all silk with a long, 54 Venice A Sketch heavy silk fringe. The ordinary ones are a mixture of silk and wool, hut all with a silk fringe; the length and thickness of the fringe marking the value of the shawl. B. bought a very pretty one. I do not know how it will look out of Venice, over a mod- em Paris costume, but she saw possibilities of adaptation. We were strolling one morning behind the palace, rather doubtful as to our where- abouts. We could always find our way back to the Rialto from the Piazza, but once we had crossed the bridge and the market place, a quantity of small streets and squares, all exactly alike, opened out before us, and it was not easy to know which turning to take. We ventured into one narrow opening it could hardly be called a street in the direction of the Grand Ca- nal. In one comer just in front of us, where two streets met, a small, elaborately carved balcony stood out from the walls of an old black house. In the window be- hind it sat an old man, with a long, white beard flowing down over a robe of black velvet, a crimson skull-cap on his head. He looked as if he had just stepped out of one of Titian s pictures. He was looking down into the street, much interested in all that was passing, calling out occasionally to the children who were running under the win- dow. Sometimes the shrines  of which there are a great number in Venice  guided us, one particularly, just at the angle of two small streets directly behind the palace. It had been empty for some time, so Lady L. gave a Madonna and Child she had modelled herself. There were always flow- ers, generally white ones, in front of it, which made a light spot on the dark walls and guided our wandering feet. There is quite a party staying in the house, and always people coming and go- ing. Every one goes his own way, and the dinners and evenings are pleasant, all the party telling their experiences. Some are sketching and painting. One can al- ways find a new corner or new effect of light in Venice, whether in the streets or on the lagoons. A nephew of our hostess, working for Cambridge, was learning to row, and what looks very simple in the practised gondolier as lie stands steadily and gracefully in his boat, is very difficult for the novice, as the oar is long and not easy to manage. A false movement has been known to precipitate the rower into the water. One lovely bright afternoon, when we were out in the gondola, the young man thought he would like to have a little prac- tice. The lagoon was perfectly smooth, not a ripple on it, and we were out of the track of the steamers. It was amusing to see the face of the young gondolier, on a broad grin, as he gave up his place and sat down close to the young fellow, ready to catch him or his oar should he lose his balance. The gondola zigzagged a little, which so terrified B., who is always ner- vous in a boat even a great ocean liner  that she begged to be landed somewhere while we continued our giro  turn . Wc deposited her at the first convenient place  the steps of San Giorgio and she said she would look at the church while we finished our row. An interesting man dined one night who could neither share nor understand our de- light in Venice. He was not a Venetian, and had lived a great deal in Bologna, where there is a famous university and a very learned and distinguished literary society. He said it was the most monot- onous, unhealthy existence one could im- agine; very few intellectual circles; the Venetians generally indolent and pleasure- loving; no exercise possible. When he had been sitting all day at his table at his work, and wanted a little air and exercise, he was obliged to go out in a boat. It was anything but a pleasure to walk in the dirty back streets, and one could hardly ask a rational man to walk round and round the Piazza San Marco.  Oh, for the sight of a meadow and green trees   I wonder if one would miss the trees and the fields if one lived here. Just now life in a gondola on those broad lagoons, with the sea breeze coming over from the Adriatic and the complete absence of noise and dust, seems ideal. At dusk one begins to hear the bells, so beautiful in Venice; at first sounding far off from the islands, then coming nearer and nearer, till all ring out together, with never a harsh jangle or strident note. The nights are enchanting; not a sound except the incessant swish of the little waves on the marble steps. Our friend told us we ought to go one day to the Campo San Bartolomeo, where Venice A Sketch 55 the girls from the islands generally Friu- lians come over to Venice to get places as servants. They arrive on a certain day of the week, in the afternoon, with no special certificates as cook or laundress or any defi- nite service; hring merely a note from the parish priest, saying they are honest and hardworking. They find places always. He told us they were quite a different  y  e from the Venetians fair-haired, round- faced, and of rather a stouter build. Wc passed through the Campo  one of the smallest in Venice  one afternoon, and could not imagine at first what had hap- pened. It was filled with people, all talking and gesticulating, and there were heads at ever ' window; some wonderful ones, with masses of thick, black, coarse hair elab- orately arranged, with curls and puffs held up by a high comb, long gold or coral ear-rings, and always the black shawl over their shoulders. There were old men, too, with black or red caps on their heads, with very' ragged white beards and eye- brows, all taking a most lively interest in the proceedings. We recognized the Friu- lians at once, standing apart in groups. They wore short, dark skirts and bodices; here and there was a white chemisette, a little fichu embroidered in bright colors on their shoulders, rather like what some of the Tyrolean girls wear in some of the cafes at Maricnbad; not one had the black shawl. They looked very smiling, did not mix with the crowd; a few Venetians rather older women were talking to some of them. I saw one girl, about eighteen, evidently making her conditions with a man. She showed him her papers; there was a little talk, and she walked off l ehind him, carry- ing her bundle, and looking very contented and placid. It seems they are all good workers, quiet, and respectable. They gen- erally marry and remain in Venice, and the majority never go back to their island again, though it is only a few hours off. The Piazza always means the   Piazza San Marco. The others are called Cam pi. The one we knew best was the Campo San Polo, the third largest in Venice. We al- ways crossed one end of it coming and go- ing from the Rialto. It is rather a fine square, with some handsome palaces, and a fountain of carved stone or marble in the middle, which one sees in all the squares. Wc went to see some Roman friends, one day, who have an apartment in one of the palaces. The sun was shining in through all the windows, and the rooms were large and high, with plenty of light and air com- ing in from the Campo, but one does not like a city square in Venice. Bricks and mortar are out of place and seem incon- gruous in the sea-girt city. The Grand Canal and the sweep of the lagoons, and even the half-dilapidated palaces on the small canals, with the greater part of their fajades black and falling off, and their marble steps worn and broken, arc more fitted to the surroundings. One day as we turned toward the Campo San Polo it looked extraordinary from a distance, as if a thick white mist had set- tled upon the Piazza, about half-way up the houses. As wc got nearer we saw that there were hundreds of lines stretched across the Piazza, with clothes and house- hold linen hanging on them, all white. It seems that on certain days the population of the quarter is allowed to make its lessive  I do not know the Knglish term general wash, I suppose  in the Campo. The peo- ple hire so many yards of rope, and a most curious collection of garments and linen was suspended in the air. A space was left around the Square, so that people could get across. Our days were so full that we never seemed to find time for any excursions to the islands or places of interest near Ven- ice. We did go one afternoon to the Lido, but that was an illusion gone the place absolutely vulgarized. I remember a long, narrow strip of land, a little stubby grass growing on the top, and a most tiring, uncomfortable walk through deep sand to the beach really a desolate stretch of shore and sea, rather melancholy, but attractive in its way; the solitude and barrenness and the perfectly calm, almost tideless sea, not blue like the Mediterra- nean, but gray, with a green shade every now and then. The row out from Venice, too, was charming, passing close to many small islands, under the walls of the Ar- menian Convent, alongside a long strip of sand, apparently in the middle of the lagoon, which looked almost as if one could walk across to the Lido. This time we went in a steamer. I sup- pose the gondolas could have gone, in spite of the very high wind, but it would have Vcnicc A Skctch been long. The crossing in the steamer was about half an hour from the Piazza, and not very pleasant. A beautiful bright sun. the snow mountains looking grand against the blue sky, but the wind very disagreeable, blowing our hats and coats about in the most fantastic manner. I could not believe it was the Lido when we arrived. Hotels and cafes, with poly- glot waiters, op  osite the landing, and a steam tramway that took us across to the sea, where an enormous new Excelsior Hotel is being built. We made our way with some difficulty to the terrace, where the noise of the wind and waves was quite extraordinary. The Adriatic looked gray and wild and was thundering big waves along the shore, llow Venice has escaped being submerged a thousand times seems a mystery. The sea looked a cruel, irresist- ible force to-day, and one felt how slight the barrier was that kept it from sweeping over the low sand-bank into the lagoons. The wind had moderated a little when we turned back, and we walked down to the landing. Hotels, pensions, and villas are scattered all along the road. Bands of tourists many Germans were walking about buying cheap little bead ornaments and vases of colored glass, and having coffee at some of the various restaurants. Anything so unlike the Lido of our day  with its low ridges of sand and stunted bushes and the glamour of romance thrown over it by Lord Byron s solitary rides  cannot be imagined. 1 cannot quite understand why our nine- teenth century has developed such levelling influences. We all seem exactly alike, lead the same lives, read the same books, travel over the same beaten tracks. Individuals hardly exist any more. The inheritors of great names who have played a part in his- tory seem quite content to live quietly, ride and shoot and yacht and spend money. The person who counts most is the person who has the most to spend. It is the same all over the world with very few exceptions. There are no strong personalities left. The Prefet of Venice dined the other night, and I was much interested in all he said about the King of Italy  So verv simple and domestic.  What he likes best is a quiet country life with his wife and children. He hates any state or ceremony. When he comes to Venice he will never have an official reception nor receive the city authorities. Consequently very few people really know him or get a chance to speak to him. and no one ever sees the Queen or the children. It was not at all my impression of the fighting Maisott de Savoie. Simple, rough soldiers they have always appeared in history, but never very domestic. It is a pity the King and Queen do not stay more in Venice. A royal progress down the Grand Canal, with the gondoliers in gala dress and the boats gay with flags and flow- ers, would be a grand sight for the Vene- tians. I am sure all the palaces would be hung with red and gold draperies, which would recall the glorious days of Venice when the Doge went forth in state in his galley to wed the Adriatic. I think what I really liked best in Venice was sitting on Lady L. s steps. I seemed to drift there naturally whenever I came into the hall. All the life of the city passed before my eyes, and even the dead, for one morning when I was sitting there a funeral passed. The coffin, covered with a black pall, was in the middle of the gondola  it looked rather like the felze, except for the flowers and wreaths that half hid it . Two boys, in their white skirts and black sou- lattes, were holding lighted tapers, and the priest, with his open book, was standing at the head of the coffin. It was really a curious sight the black procession  three or four gondolas were following  in the midst of the color and traffic of the morn- ing in Venice. One afternoon, while we were waiting on the steps for our hostess to come and join us in the gondola, we saw a lady on the steamboat pier just opposite making signs to us. It proved to be Miss D., a niece of Lady I.., who wanted to be put across  buttalo  thrown  is the term. There were no gondolas on her side and ours had not yet come in, but in a few minutes a   rover  appeared around the corner, and we sent him over. He brought Miss D. back for the modest sum of two sous. We often hailed a passing gondola and were put across  following a succession of small streets and canals , with many turns and twists and most picturesque comers of old Venice, coming suddenly upon most un- expected bits: an old doorway, wonderful carved balconies with half the ornaments broken off, and once or twice a beautiful I A be,uilifiil lilllt  date, villi lapdc quite intact, in the mil ol  be nmi did iiirodinjt-Piije -A  Venice A Sketch little palace, with fa acle quite intact, in the midst of most sordid surroundings, dark, low shops with most unwholesome-looking fruits and vegetables, and cook shops, with rows of fried fish spread out on boards, which one smelt before coming into the Campo; bridges over such narrow canals that a man with ordinaiy legs could jump across, and ever ' now and then a glimpse of the lagoon: finally emerging into the busy, crowded Piazza, where all the modem life of Vcnice is concentrated. We made a charming excursion one afternoon with Lady L. to her hospital  half gondola, half steamer, and a little walking. It was interesting walking along the quays of the Giudecca, as we saw boats from all parts of the world. One or two were unloading very leisurely and with a great deal of conversation between the men on the boats and everybody who passed either on the quay or in a gondola. The hospital is very well situated on a fairly broad canal, close to the lagoon; a garden, one of the few in Venice, opposite. The matron, an Englishwoman, most at- tractive and capable  she had been through the Boer war , showed us all over the build- ing. There is quite a large garden. An invalid was stretched out on a sofa in the sun, an awning shielding her from the direct raj's. The wards were beautifully clean and bright and the private rooms most inviting, so fresh and pretty. We had tea with the matron in her sitting-room, opening on a terrace, with an enchanting view over Venice and the lagoons. One would think the quiet and beautiful air would cure any malady. We went into the garden when we came out, walking over the bridge. It was too early in the season to see it in all its beauty, but there were borders of daffodils and hyacinths, and rose trees and creepers all over. There is a solid sea-wall on the side of the lagoon, and leaning on it, looking out on the extent of water, the fishing-boats in the distance with their deep orange and red sails, smaller craft flying backward and forward, the low shore of the Lido, and the domes and roofs of the buildings on the islands half veiled in the evening light, we had again the impression of something un- real, as if the curtain would fall and the wonderful fairy  scene of shifting lights and dancing water would disappear. I think it must be the absence of noise which gives one always that curious feeling of being out of the world. We have not been inside many  of the palaces. The exterior is always the same  high, pointed windows, carved balconies, marble steps with the water always rip- pling over them. I cannot even say splashing, that would mean too much life. The little waves just bathe the steps. We had tea one afternoon at the Palazzo Bar- baro on the Grand Canal, where B. s daughter was bom. As the child was bom on Palm Sunday, she was called Palma. It lxdongs now to an American lady, who has made it most livable and comfortable. There is a fine stone staircase in the court- yard, very high and very steep, most elab- orately carved, which makes a very pict- uresque comer. We passed through a very wide, high hall, running, as they all do here, straight through the house from the canal to the courtyard, with rooms opening out on each side, into a pretty, comfortable, modem salon with books, arm-chairs, and a wood fire, where we had tea. After tea the hostess showed us the other rooms, which are charming, so well arranged. The ballroom, or big draw- ing-room, is quite unique of its kind; three sides of the walls are covered with fres- coes wonderfully well preserved, th  col- ors really extraordinary when one thinks how long they had been there, and prob- ably never cared for at all until the present owner lived in the house. When B. lived there, more than thirty years ago, the big room was not furnished, and was used as a debarras to put in trunks, boxes, etc. It is arranged with a great deal of taste, with pictures and furniture which harmonize perfectly with the very  marked style of the period. Modem furniture against those old frescoed walls would be impossible. We walked home at least to the steam- boat pier opposite the palace thinking that, as it was late, the gondola would prob- ably be there and come to get us; but there were no signs of it. We waited some little time, then tried to persuade the gondoliers of a private gondola, who were waiting at the landing, to put us across: but they would not be bril cd. They were very smart-looking, dressed in biue, crimson sashes with heavy gold fringe, and crimson cords on their hats. The etiquette of the 5S Venice A Sketch private gondola is carefully regulated. When it goes out in the morning shopping, sightseeing, or to the station, one gondolier in ordinary livery goes with the boat; in the afternoon for the Grand Canal or visits there are two in full-dress livery. We were getting decidedly impatient, as no  rover  was in sight. At last the man of the pier came to our assistance. He called loudly for poppe  the gondolier is called poppa, from the part of the boat where he stands rowing . His cry was instantly answered; a gondola appeared and put us across. The man was rather sorry that we did not want to make a longer turn and suggested various short excursions. We walked almost ever   morning either to or from the Piazza, and I am ashamed to say how often 1 lost my way and had to l e escorted home by a small boy. There seemed to be dozens always waiting at the corners of the streets, smiling and willing and talkative. They show one the way and give a  reat deal of information for a few sous. I thought I was quite sure of my direction one day, and rang at the door of a passage which looked exactly like the one leading to the Palazzo Capelli. I did not ring very vigorously, but the bell-rope al- most came off in my hand, and there was a wild, jangling peal of a long-disused bell which brought all the heads out of all the windows in the neighboring houses, with such a torrent of explanations and di- rections, everybody speaking, or rather screaming, at the same time, that I thought I was in Bedlam, and lied around a corner and down another narrow street pursued by cries of a destra, a sinistra, died passi  right, left, ten steps . However, 1 was brought up short by a stone wall, my street apparently leading nowhere, and had to retrace my steps, very glad to find one of the small boys of the Campo to show me my way. He, too, said died passi, and he was right a few steps brought me to the door of our entrance. Me knew the Palazzo Capelli well, as floes everylxxly in Venice. It is one of the finest in the city, filled with beautiful things and well known to all tourists and art lovers. Lady L. is most amiable about showing it, and certainlv when one lias such beautiful pictures it would be a shame not to let them lie seen. The evenings at home ore very pleasant. There is always some one to dine, or in the evening. The small drawing-room, where we usually sit after dinner, is charming on a cold night  and our evenings have been cold , when the heavy red satin curtains are drawn and the wood lire sends little flicker- ing lights over the pictures and dull gold of the frames and mirrors. There is a spot of light in one comer where Lady L. has her table and lamp. Some of the ladies are always working, and the mistress of the house has des doigts dc fee can do any- thing she likes. She is making a wonderful catalogue of her pictures. On each page is a small vignette, charmingly painted, of the picture which is described on the next page, and which tells you who was the painter, when and where the picture was bought, and what it cost. M'hen one knows what a Tintoretto or a Bellini would cost now, some of the figures seem impossible. Sir H. L. had lived abroad all his life  at school as a boy, later as a most distin- guished traveller and diplomatist, finishing his career as ambassador in Constantinople. He had, of course, numerous opportunities of finding and collecting art treasures of every kind. His autobiography is most in- teresting; reads like a novel. His account of his school-days in France, particularly where the unreasoning animosity of the French, both scholars and masters, made the English boy s life intolerable, seems incredible. I give part of it in his own words: "The feeling of hatred and contempt which the long wars of Napoleon had en- gendered between the French and English had not yet been removed by the peace. It extended to the rising generation, and being an English boy I was a victim of it. Both my nationality and my religion were hateful to my fellow pupils and, I doubt not, to my masters, who always gave me a double share of punishment. There was 110 abuse that was not heaped upon me. 1 was denounced as a Protestant and a heretic. A popular amusement in the col- lege was to make a cross with white chalk upon the filthy floor, and then to endeavor to force me to kiss it. When I resisted with all my might I was held down by main force and beaten on the head and elsewhere with the wooden shoes, or sabots, which many of the boys, even at that time, wore.  My lazy fingers usually remained idle. It is pleasant to do nothing sometimes. B. Venice A Sketch 59 learned to make some lace like what. Lady L. was doing, and some of the other ladies were making bags and chains of Venetian beads, which are very pretty and make a great effect; some of the white ones twisted in ropes look like pearls. I enjoyed the general talk, half English, half Italian, very much. We were talking one evening about books how everything that was worth reading was translated into all lan- guages. Mr. M., son of the great London publisher, told us his father had seen a copy of  Pilgrim s Progress  in Chinese, with John Bunyan depicted as a Chinaman with a pigtail. We had no bridge, which was a pleasure, as that craze has put an end to all conversation. We had music- one night, Mrs. H., an American, half artist, half amateur, singing charmingly. The hall looked most attractive and signo- rile, with the grand piano standing out in the middle and all the party scattered about. It was so cold that at intervals we all, including the singer, retired to the small drawing-room and sat in the fires. It is very difficult to warm the big palaces. The Venetian stoves  brought originally by the Austrians  are insufficient, and they do not dare put furnaces or hot-water pipes in these old walls. Lady L. lives upstairs when the snow on the mountains makes Venice cold and damp. She has a charm- ing boudoir, or rather atelier  she is always painting or doing enamel work or em- broidery , on the comer of the two canals, and has floods of sunshine when it is fine. One evening we had a Royal Princess with her husband  not a Prince  and lady- in-waiting at dinner. They came in an open gondola from their hotel some little distance off, and were nearly frozen when they arrived, in spile of rugs and furs. She was a gracious, stately figure; one would never have imagined from her expression that she had had a tragedy in her life. The town is fdling up now with tourists; there were very few when we first arrived. We saw a pretty sight this morning in the Piazza. Two English babies, dressed in white, were sitting in the sun in the middle of the enormous square, a basket of bread between them. The nurse was standing be- hind, and hundreds of pigeons were hop- ping about close to them and fluttering over their heads, a crowd of people making a circle around them. The babies, quite un- conscious, were gleefully giving bread to the pigeons and laughing out loud with delight when there was a scramble for a big piece, not in the least frightened when the birds came too near. I said to the nurse,   I don t think you ought to let your children sit down on the stones.   Oh, it won t hurt them, madame; the stones arc quite warm with the sun, and the children are very warmly dressed; they don t sit all the time, only stoop down.  I was sorry I hadn t a paint brush or a kodak. The children were about three and four years old little white bundles and would have made a charm- ing picture. We heard a great noise of guns as we turned out of the Piazza. We asked what it was, and a policeman told us it was the Port of Venice saluting the Iloheuzollcni, the German Emperor's yacht, which had just come to await Ilis Majesty s arrival. We saw her quite well when we were out in the gondola in the afternoon. She is a big, white boat, not very graceful in her out- lines; looks more like a strong sea boat than a yacht. Two other German boats, a cruiser and a small steamer, were anchored near her, and several gondolas and steam- launches were alongside. A little later we crossed a steam-launch flying the German colors, with some very smart-looking officers in uniform. I should like to see the Em- peror, but our visit is drawing to a close, and he does not come for some days yet. We have done some last sightseeing, and went the other day to the Academia. I wanted to see Titian s   Presentation in the Temple  again, and wondered if I should have the same impression as when I last saw it, not perhaps exactly expressed as it was by my small nephew who was with us, and who was much astonished at our admiration of the picture.  That ugly lit- tle girl going upstairs  Do you really think that s pretty, Grandma   The Virgin s face and figure arc certainly not very ideal- ized. The face is square, nothing spiritual; more like the Dutch Madonnas one sees, who are often red-cheeked, chubby little maidens. The rest of the picture is beauti- ful; such splendid coloring and picturesque old men; B. was very anxious to see a pict- ure by Paul Veronese, which she thought was in Venice, of a beautiful, fair-haired woman, dressed in white satin, her hands full of roses, which she was throwing down 60 Venice A Sketch from a balcony; but though we saw scores of beautiful women by Veronese and all his school, that particular one was not there. What splendid pictures they painted  1 know many of the art critics say Veronese could not draw, his proportions were all wrong. His arms and legs looked all right to me, the women graceful and the men straight and tall, and the colors quite gor- geous. We made our last turn in the Merceria this morning, passing under the clock tower and following the crowd a long, hurrying, motley line to the Rialto. There is not much to buy except beads and pearls, which make pretty, fancy chains. 1 im- agine one might find some bargains in the way of real pearls in some of the little, dark shops, but it would be dangerous to buy without an expert. Our last day was beautiful warm and bright. Lady L. and 1 lunched with Prince and Princess Biilow, who were slaying at one of the hotels on tne Grand Canal, with a lovely terrace directly on the water. We were not a very large party one or two secretaries: the captain of the Hohenzot- lern, in uniform; some Italians: Donna Laura Minghetti  mother of Princess Biilow , with the same beautiful eyes and smile I remembered twenty-five years ago, and even longer; and the Countess M., a beautiful Venetian. The conversation was interesting, though a little bewildering, four different languages being spoken around the table French, Italian, Eng- lish, and German. The Chancellor seemed equally at home in all: spoke French with me, English with Lady L., discussed Italian politics and the last Roman elections in Italian, with the Conte X., an Italian friend. Some one remarked casually from one end of the table, Tons les princes ro- tnains soul Socialities  all the Roman princes are Socialists , which statement, partially true, made a very lively argument. 1 was delighted to see Biilow again, and found him looking very well, not in the least tired or careworn. Certainly the cares of state sit lightly upon him, for he has had some difficult moments and a tremendous responsibility. However, as I told him, if politics were not difficult they would not be interesting; when there is no fight, there are no fighters; any one can do the routine work. He told me nothing rested him like Italy; Venice, particularly, with its won- derful stillness. After breakfast the band of the Hohen- zollcrn played in the garden; they were very numerous, over fifty, and played remark- ably well; never too loud. All the people staying in the hotel were grouped at one end of the terrace. The light dresses of the women and the quantities of flowers on their hats made a pretty effect of color. The musicians in uniform were in the mid- dle; the leader had a fine string of medals on his breast, and many of the men had several. It seems that the Emperor takes great pride in his music and encourages the men very much. They looked very smiling, quite pleased to play. Princess Biilow thanked them very- graciously when the concert was over. After breakfast B. and I w'alked to the Riva degli Schiavoni and took a steamer to the Public Gardens, the pride of Venice. The sun was so hot we were glad to sit down on a bench in the shade. I did not find the gardens very interesting. There are some big trees, of course, but it looked like any garden in any large city, except the view over the lagoon, with the fishing- lioats drifting slowly along, their sails flap- ping against the masts, and far off beyond the islands; little puffs of smoke from steamers coming and going. One hates the commonplace in Venice. Except for the steamers on the Grand Canal the city is absolutely unchanged, and has "quite kept its extraordinary fantastic, poetical charm, with always a sense of sadness and of past greatness that can never come back. Of course, some of the palaces on the Grand Canal have been repaired, facades and balconies cleaned and mended, but they hardly count with the hundreds that are left apparently just as they were in the old days when the Queen of the Adriatic sent her galleys all over the world. I see no building anywhere, nothing that looks like the enlargement of the city, nothing new except the Campanile in the Piazza San Marco, which is being built upon exactly the same lines as the old one. It is inure than half finished and does not look too appallingly new. They have been able tu give a mellow tint to the stones. I think one should go about in some of the small canals at night to understand w hat the life of old Venice was. Une passes The Campaign Trout 61 hundreds of palaces black with age; bits of marble broken off; the windows with no panes of glass, clothes and rags stuffed in the openings and hanging down over the fafade; marble steps cracked and broken; poles rotting as they stand in the water; and yet the effect is extraordinary. One glides noiselessly along between the rows of palaces, quite dark. Sometimes a little dim light high up at the top; sometimes a dull lantern hung over the door to guide the uncertain steps of the inmates and pre- vent them from stumbling over the broken pavement and falling into the water. The stillness is absolute. There is no sound, no life, no light; nothing that belongs to the busy outside world. In the dim light the balconies jutting out over the water seem grand fantastic monuments, and as one leans back on the cushions of the gondola, half dreaming with the swaying motion, there seems no reason why one should not glide on forever and lead a ghostly life with the phantoms of the Past. I am very sorry to go. Our stay at the Palace has been delightful, and 1 have seen quite a different Venice from the one I re- member when I came as a tourist and stayed at the Danicli. 1 had vague recol- lections of walking to the Rialto bridge and in the Colonnade of San Marco, but I had no idea of the wonderful, dark, twisting streets and alleys at the back of the palaces, with every now and then a glimpse of the Grand Canal; nor the curious little Cam pi, shut in on all sides with tine old palaces, quite dilapidated, crumbling away; shops downstairs, and various degrees of poverty and squalor in what had been the piano nubile and line apartments in bygone days. I don't know exactly what the charm is, but it exists. One feels the sea everywhere, and I understand the gondolier s phrase, II mare ri chiawa  the sea is calling us . THE CAMPAIGN TROUT By Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews Illustrations by Philip K. Good w i n tefraaafeSgSjOSE  ' and I were lifting our canoe into Lac Lumiere rag from the Dammed Little  MrjIS  River when we saw paddles flash up the lake. The  gar- 50ns,  Blanc and Zoetique, the brace of younger guides, had been out to the club for mail; as that happened only once in ten days we hustled. I ought to mention that the Dammed Little River is not so named entirely for love of blasphemy, but because it is little and is dammed it was over that dam that we lifted the canoe. I ll grant you, how- ever, that it may add a tang to the harmless stream to call it by the fierce name, and also it makes you feel pleasantly like a per- fect devil to swear that way without sin. Anyhow that s where we were that Sep- tember afternoon, Josef and I, just back from a two days  hunting trip to Lac Sau- vage country. I d missed a moose, and I knew I was going to get jeered when I got Vol. XLVIII. 7 back to camp anti told my brother Walter, who never leaves much to reproach himself with when there s an opening for jeerings. But I might as well face the music, and be- sides, there was the first mail for ten days a mile ahead ljetween two glints of sunlight coming and going the paddles. So wc hustled, as aforesaid. But Blanc and Zoetique paddling the home stretch are hard to beat, and they had landed minutes before we got there, and were making oration with Walter on the porch. He detached himself with diffi- culty to greet me.  Hello, Bob,  he threw at me, and  Bon jour, Josef. Glad to see you. Any luck   Wait a moment and I ll talk to you.  I sat myself on a l ench and stretched my hunting boots over the landscape and wait- ed per order. It s good for the soul to hear Walter talk French. He was enthroned in the one store chair, a red rocker, in the middle of the big camp porch, and I'll tell The Campaign Trout 02 how he looked, for local color's sakv. He s a lot older than I to begin with over forty, while I m only at Yale and they made him a judge the minute he cut his teeth the youngest in the State. Well, he sal there looking pretty prosperous, with his nice beefy color, and his dark gray clothes, an I his dark gray hair, for hi  honors have g me to the outside of his head only. He s a trifle too emlxmpointish around the hips, but great men often have a rush of dignity to tiie waist-line, 1 notice. The light splashed on his spectacles so they were all He s keen for fishing. He d rather fish than be President rather than shoot the biggest bull mouse on record. He had Ihe package of letters in his hands, the first in ten days; around him were piled rolls of newspa tcrs, and he hadn t heard a new in all that time but nothing mattered. Nothing but Zoetique s fish story. When Zoittique s crisp, rippling sort of low voice stopped, Walter leaned forward and got ready with anxious care to talk. To talk French was a necessity, for the men didn t understand English, and I could see you could see of his eyes, but the glasses looked full of earnestness, and there was a deep line in the middle of his forehead which conies when lie s most awfully seri- ous. He was this time. I'd have bet on ii, when I saw his pipe sitting on his knee like an interrogation point upside down. Before him stood Zoetique and Blanc, dressed in odds and ends; trousers under their armpits, multiple suspenders, slouch hats, a red bandanna, an axe in Zoc- tique s bell, and a curibou-skin knife sheath with buckskin fringe in Blanc's. Rum- mage sale effects. For all that Zoelique s got a figure which any athlete might envy, deep-shouldered, small-waisted, musclely  and Blanc moves like a greyhound, all steel springs and lightness, They stood respect- fully in front of the red rocking-chair, and behind them two miles of lake stretched from the camp porch t   the everlasting hills. In musical, incorrect French, with the nice polite manner all these habitants have, Zoetique was getting to the end   i a storv, as I gathered, about a fish. That made it clear why Walter s soul depths were bub- bling and he couldn t pay attention to me. him working his intellect. He usually helps himself to the French dictionary and kicks it, and calls that conversation, but this was different. This was about a fish it was important to be understood. "Si je comprcnnc, Zoetique. Coniine rth'i. I oits Vnvez vim' sorlir ,1 Ic Rations Dort, ytine    0  prison gros grossc vous dtsons cel it  " I yel n'd a short yelp.

A Parisian would have sobbed. But Walter got his questions out of his system, and 1 pulled him from one or two sad holes by the boots. And then the gardens raconte-d over again for me how they had been passing the Golden Pool the Rations Dor6 on their way up from the club with the mail and provisions, and had been brought to a dead stop by an enormous splash in the water. Zoetique specified that it was   ipouvantiible, aw  Blanc, with gest- ures of hands and shoulders, told how he was so scared blue that he spilled into a two-foot hole, and the pack slid off him. Then the trout came up again, and concerning that ap  ear- ancc they gave measurements. They had him half the length of a canoe, and ten pounds heavy, by egging each other on a little, and Walter didn t doubt a syllable; he didn't want to. ilJe vous Jiles       uc nous Jaisati,  he addressed them enthusiastically. Then lie arranged, with further language, that the three, he and Blanc and Zoetique, should go down to the Golden Pool the next afternoon and collar that fish. Then he let the men loose, and they dissolved into the woods toward their own camp, and Walter glared at me joyfully through his goggles.  Bob, it s a sockdologer; it s the one that nibbled at my fly two weeks ago, and I couldn't get him on. But it was hot, then, and low water, and lots of  lies for the fish to fill up on. Now it s cold, and they re gathering in the deep holes, and the llies are frozen out I'll get him.   Please the pigs, you will,  agreed I-  Sounds like an olil lie-one,doe sn t it  And Zoetique never does lie as well as the rest. Give me my letters, won't you   and with that he came too.   Well, Bobby. I haven t heard about your trip.

When you shoot crooked there are just so many excuses from which your friends will choose comfort to offer up to you, and you knew beforehand which. But the feeling left is the same. If you ve missed, you ve missed, and nothing alters that fundamental grief and the yearning for blood and one more shot, which remains. And conversely, if you ve hit you don t give a button how easy the shot was, or how many times you  tumped your gun to do it. There s a profound peace in the pit of your being that religion is powerless to bestow. So as Walter ran over the reasons why I couldn t possibly have hit 1 appreciated his courtesy, and rejoiced to be let off, but I was sore all the same. Besides, there was a gleam behind the spectacles which gave me a good hunch that I wouldn t be let off forever.

I told about my trip, and began on my letters, and Wal- ter took to the newspapers. 1 heard him laughing in a few minutes, and I looked at him.

Am I in charge      Yes, yes leave me alone, Boh,  he threw at me hurriedly, and just at that second 1 happened to look ouL at the lake. I stood petrified. There was a canoe on it. Now our own guides and canoes were all in camp, and we re away beyond every- body s passing. Nobody comes to Lac Lumiere unless they come to see us. Wht   under heaven could l e coming to sec us  It was 5.30 in the afternoon, and nobody from another camp would arrive at that hour, for it would be too late to gel back anywhere. One doesn t walk portages after dark in Canada. So I was petrified. It was a canoe all right, however, and the paddles were Hashing fast; it would be at our dock in five minutes.  What the devil docs that mean   Wal- ter growled, and I lit into the camp and brought out my telescope, and in half a min- ute it was on the canoe.  Two guides don t know  em,  I re- ported. And then I shrieked in agony,  For cat s sake for cat's sake " Walter got excited.  Who is it what is it   he threw at me.  That's what I say,  answered 1.  What is it  what is it  It s, a, straw, hat    A straw hat   Walter repeated, dazed like. For you see nature may abhor a vacuum, but I m witling to bet she doesn t abhor it a patch on the way she docs a stiff hat. And there it sat in the middle of nature, the lake gurgling around; dingy, regulation guides dipping paddles bow and stern; outraged mountains rising up green and sanctified at the horizon; and in the centre of the stage, a shiny straw hat. It was too much. I dropped the glass and doubled with too- muchness. And Walter glued an eye to the lookout.  It's a straw hat,  he admitted, and re- served judgment, and went down to the dock, me following in all maidenly modesty. In five minutes more the canoe s nose ran up the bank to our feet. We  bon jour-ed " the guides, and then the hat was lifted re- spectfully and a lanky figure of a man arose to his feet and stood wobbling. The guides tried to keep the boat steady, but he lurched at the dock and slopped over. His fore- foot went into some quite wet lake which we kept there Canadian canoes aren't Vol. XLVI1I. 8 meant for doing the barn dance. Walter and I snitchtxl as one man at him, and yanked him landward, but in the enthu- siasm of salvage his eyeglasses jumped him, and according to the law of gravity made for a crack in the dock. And somebody  said to be me knocked off his lid. It took to the deep and bobbed away riding a wave, and Auguste, the guide, had to defichc like sin to fish it in with a paddle, it was an eventful landing for that sandy-haired youth as we discovered him to be 011 the escape of the hat. He squushed water sor- rowfully out of the yellowest low shoes I ever saw, and you couldn t cheer him even when 1 set his crown back on him and picked up his glasses. He just pulled off his hat promptly and gazed at it like an anxious mother and squushed more lake out of his yellow foot, and clucked softly  I don t know how to spell the noise, but it was a kind of a regretful cluck. Finally he got his glasses rubbed and his hat wiped, and Walter and I volubly offered him dozens of shoes, though I knew we d have to short-come on the color. With the most exquisite courtesy we walked him up- stairs over the muddy little precipice of a trail to the camp, and sat him in the red rocker, and offered him whiskey. But he wouldn t. Heavings, Maud  No. Not him. So we fed him Jamaica ginger and hot water, which I prefer myself, if there s sugar in it. And lx'hold  he smiled like a split in a potato and arrived at the next station.  I beg you will pardon me, Judge Mor- gan. I have been disturbed a little by these unfortunate accidents. 1 have for- gotten to explain my presence in your hos- pitable camp. My name is Spafford. I am head clerk in the office of Bush, F.ngel- hardt   Clarkson. I come from Mr. Engelhardt, Judge Morgan.   Hull " grunted Walter in a sweet way he has. like a cross codfish. The sandy one looked bewildered.  Mr. Engelhardt,  he emphasized,  the Chairman of the State Committee, I mean, that Mr. Engelhardt,  and he paused to give Waller a chance to whoop for joy. Walter not whooping, he trotted along glibly: "The convention which is to nomi- nate the candidate for Governor is on the eighteenth, and Mr. Engelhardt decided yesterday that il would be best that you GG The Campaign Trout should t e there. You know, of course, Judge, that you are likely to be nomi- nated  Huh   remarked Walter again, making awful faces, biting his cigar.  Yes, sir,  Mr. Spafford answered that sound with firm politeness.  Mr. Engel- hard  thinks it best.  And that to Mr. Spafford seemed to be final.  To-day is the 14th. If you take the train with me from the club to-morrow night at eight, leaving from Qucbcc the next morning, we will reach headquarters on the 17th, the day before the convention. Mr. Engel- hardt and I planned it out,  and he smiled that split-rock smile again. I or the third time Walter said that in- sulting  Huh   And then in a flash there spread over his facc a thick layer of a peculiar sirupy smile which I knew to mean an attack of pig-headedness.   I m afraid I shall not be able to join you on the journey, Mr. Spafford,  he cooed. Mr. Spafford looked flabbergasted. He simply didn t know the repartee. That anybody should disobey Mr. Engelhardt seemed one form of insanity. But here was a human being playing fast and loose with the nomination for Governor that was a form even more awful. His pale eyes popped till you could have knocked them off with a stick.  Are you ill, sir   he exploded finally.  Oh, no not ill, Mr. Spafford,  Walter answered gently.  But I m going fishing.  The cigar which Walter had fed him dropped splib on the floor, and the lower half of his mouth nearly joined it.  Fish- ing   he gasjied.  Fishing  But but,  hope dawned. Maybe Walter was absent- minded or deaf or something he surely hadn t understood.  Judge Morgan.  he began in a first-reader effect,  it is  the nomination for Governor.  He got into capitals at that point.  Mr. Engelhardt the Chairman  of   the   State-  Walter headed him off.  I know I grasp,  he interrupted softly.   I would like to be nominated for Governor very much, but there s a big trout, Mr. Spafford  are you a fisherman, Mr. Spafford   he interrupted himself in dulcet tones.  No.  The stunned one stared.  All  then you can t really quite under- stand. I m so sorry to disappoint Mr. Engelhardt if he wants me, but you see it s this way.  He proceeded lo explain elab- orately, as if in court, the situation to that dumfounded youth. Walter showed him carefully how the fish wouldn t bite of a morning, ami so the first time he could take this one would be the next afternoon. He pointed out that he d been after this fish off and on all summer, and how big he was, and how one could see that it would be out of the question to leave before he killed him. This and more details about flies and low water and such things. When he got through, the head clerk of Bush, Engelhardt   Clarkson didn t know what he possibly could be talking about. Then a bright idea struck him. Walter was a practical joker, and with that wc got the privilege of hearing Mr. Spafford laugh. It wasn t dead merry laughter; it sounded like a rapid-fire Christmas horn gone rusty.   I see,  he arrested the flow of it to ex- plain.   You are jesting.  And with that I butted in.  Not on your life, he isn t,  1 stated.   But it s too blamed bad. Walter, don t go and do such a perfectly rotten   and at that point Walter s eyes flashed tire, and I stopped hurriedly. But I didn t give in for all that. I can get him to do things sometimes when most people can t, and 1 was bound to try this time. So that night, after we d tucked up the Spafford blossom in his downy guest- tent and he was horrid nervous about beasts and spiders I went into Walter's camp and reasoned with the Judge. 1 pointed out things which are obvious to the intelligence of a frog, and after a while I got him to shed his sirupy smile and talk sense.  I m not keen about being at the con- vention, Bob,  he explained.  If the nom- ination conies of itself I ll be delighted, but I m not the build to roll logs and keep my dignity. And 1 don t care to be led down on a leash by that young fool. I don t know what Engelhardt means by sending me such an infernal puppy.   Ought not to talk that way before a boy like me, Walter,  I remonstrated. And then reminded him that Mr. Spafford meant awfully well, and that it was his proud boast that he d been sent because of his reputation for persistence.  Persistent heavenly powers   Walter groaned.   I should say he was persistent. The Campaign Trout  57 Like a terrier this whole evening. Made camp a hell. I m so relieved to get him to bed that I could yell for joy.  Back I went to the point. I saw he was only reluctant to go out, not dead set against it, and I thought Mr. Engelhardt could likely judge better than he could. I asked him, and he said yes, likely, and that it was no harm to be there for the convention, only  he didn t feel like it. And he felt amaz- ingly like taking that trout. Well, I man- aged a compromise. It was agreed that we should break camp next morning, and go down ahead of the guides early in the after- noon to the Golden Pool, he and I and Mr. Spafford, and there Walter should fish till it was time to go on to the cluh to catch the train. If he could corral the sockdologer before that psychological moment, well and good. If not well, he wouldn t promise, but I had a hunch that if we were all packet  up he d go on. Anyhow it was the best I could do. So I took Mr. Spafford aside next morning and staled the case, with a rosy glow over possibilities; and I warned him politely not to nag at Wralter or he d break for the North Pole, and never be Governor or anything else but a frozen corpse. Next morning we were busy little house- wives, bundling our earthly alls into the big canvas mail-bags which are our camp trunks. The guides were flying back and forth, and everybody was bubbling French, and lots doing. And in the middle of it the poor Spafford waif clung to the red rocking- chair, with the straw hat on his head, lost in wonder. He couldn t comprehend why people who might live in houses with rugs on the floor, and lace curtains and uphol- stered chairs should choose to do this. I saw him stare at a three-inch hole in my left trouser, where my complexion showed through, and then lift his wondering eyes to my gray flannel shirt, with much moun- tain wiped upon it, and a red cotton ban- danna decorating the neck of it he couldn t see through the game. You have to lie bom to it, or you can t. We got off about two, Walter and I pad- dling, and Spiff in the middle, in the hat. We left all the guides to shut up camp and bring on the  butin.  We paddled two miles down the lake, and then into the river among the rocks it was low water and you had to know the channel. We shot a little rapids, and the flower of civilization was scared blue, but we made the portage, and there I flopped the canoe on my head and walked off, and Walter guided the steps of the stranger. It's only a mile down the    rtage to the Pool, so we got there an hour after leaving camp, and Walter at once paid 110 more attention to anybody. He began to put up his Leonard rod as if it were a religious ceremony; he docs it that way. He had his leader ready, and I saw him meditate on the flies, and then open his fly- box and look it over thoughtfully to see if there was anything more seductive to the troutly mind. I remember that cast; it was a Jock Scott for hand-fly, a Silver Doc- tor in the middle, and a Montreal tail-fly. That s the way lie started. Afterward he changed the Silver Doctor for a brown hackle it was a brightish day. The min- ute he l egan to string the rod, it came to me that we d forgotten the landing-net. That was ghastly when we were out for big fish, but it was much too far to go back, and I knew the guides would have it, and so I hoped the giant wouldn t get on, and W'alter wouldn t notice about the net till the guides got there. And I kept mum, not to fuss the fisherman. The Golden Pool was named that be- cause it is. In September, when we fish there most, the leaves around it have turned yellow, and yellow only, for we re too far north for red foliage, and it s all in a bath of gold light. It s a widening in the river about a hundred yards across, and a lot of it is shallow, so, of a bright afternoon, the tawny colored sand-bars show through. And all around the shore arc tall birches, which lean over, and their thin leaves are gold-shot, and the sun glitters through them. There arc alders close to the water, and these are frost-touched too, and the stream rushes in over a steep rapids at a gorge between alder walls. It tumbles flashing around rocks in tier on tier of champagne whiteness, with sherry-colored slides of smooth water, and in the deep holes it s the gold-brown of brandy. Flecks of foam whirl all over the surface, and under the bushes at the edge lie feathery hunks of it like piles of whipped cream a foot square. As you get to the place from the shadow and quiet of the woods, you seem to have come into a shower of glan- cing light and movement and excitemcnl. OS The Campaign Trout You breathe in autumn and energy sharply. Yet it s all as still and remote as the big shadows on the mountains. That s the Golden Pool, and that s where we got, the afternoon of September 15, when my brother squatted on the rocks, and put up and strung his rod. The reel sang as the first line ran, and the snells fell stiff and curly but not over the hole trust Walter not to stir up that hole till he was ready for business. In two or three casts the snells were wet, and the llies spun out on the brown, foam-spotted water. And then Walter cast carefully at the edge of the real fishing ground. Along the left-hand side of the Pool the bottom is all big rocks, and in between are deep, cold holes, and there the big trout lie never many, yet every year two or three good ones are taken by the few who know the secret, from a place about twenty feet square. It s ticklish fishing, for there are sharp edges to the rocks for an educated fish to dodge under, and more than once a leader has been cut in two by a jerk from a fish that knew his business; and many s the fly yanked off around those edges. So it s skill against skill, man with his clumsy in- ventions against trout with his exquisite instinct human brains out of their ele- ment against trout cleverness in its strong- hold. That s the wav it is when you go fishing in the Golden Pool. Walter cast his prettiest from the first, and that's very pretty casting indeed. The dim-colored Jock Scott danced delicatelv toward us as he lifted the tip of the rod, hardly touching the surface; the Silver Doctor just wet its bluish, silverish wings, and the Montreal, with its streak of purple- red, dragged a bit in the water; big trout are more likely to take a fly underneath than to jump for it. It was all done in regulation form, slow recover, wrist motion only, sidewise jiggle as the flies came in, a lengthening line covering the hole slowly from side to side. Close back of us was the forest, with just a few yards of big rocks and low bushes for clear space; the re- cover, you ll see, was a critical business. It was mighty easy to catch a fly in one of those alders or on a fringe of tree, but Wal- ter didn t catch once. He s a shark at the job. However, it was too early; the sun was too strong; nothing doing. So, after half an hour of exhibition casting:  Take me across, Bob,  said Walter, his eves still fast on the Pool. So I slid the canoe in, away off one side, awfully cautiously so no ripple would dis- turb the sacred and holy twenty feet square. And Walter stepped in the bow, and I slid the paddle into the water without a splash, and in two or three careful strokes I had him over 3t the farther side of the pond, well away, but yet within casting distance of the hole.  Zip  went the reel, with the businesslike, sharp, soft sound which means it s well oiled and well wound and well managed. It s a joy to hear Walter's reel. Out flew the nine-foot line of light which was the leader, and over the brown water danced three spots of color which were the flics. And then I saw Walter s fist jerk back about two inches, hard, and my eyes jum  ed to the leader, and the hand fly was taut, and there was a bunch of white foam where it should have been, and a great bubbling of water, and the Silver Doctor and the Montreal were float- ing loose, and the kicking and bubbling and struggling were stronger each second. A fish was on the Jock Scott, and Walter had hooked him. I watched about thirty seconds with my heart in my mouth, and then I knew it wasn t what we were after. And with that Walter gave his pretty grunt.  Huh   he said, and began to reel in, casual-like.  Smoll fcesh   I asked, as Blanc talks English.   Yes, the little cuss," Walter murmured, and yanked up alongside the boat a three- pound trout.  Want to keep him " "Heavens, no    said Walter with con- tempt. So I laid the paddle in the boat, and wet my hands in the stream, because if you don t do that your touch will take off the overcoat of slime that s necessary to a fish s life, and he ll die. If I d wanted to keep that fish I couldn t have landed him without a net. He was hooked by just a thread in the upper part of the mouth. But 1 got the hook out gingerly, and presented him with the freedom of the pool, and he slid off with no remarks. He lived all right. I hen big brother proceeded to disgust him- self and me by taking rapidly, one after another, five half and quarter pounders. I threw them all in, and seeing we were too The Campaign Trout 09 popular with the small game, we moseyed back to the rocks. Meanwhile, all this time the outcast from civilization was sitting on my sweater on a rock gazing in wonder at the lunatics. If it hadn't been for the infallible Mr. Engel- hardt, I ll bet he d have shaken Walter as no fit thing for Governor, but as Mr. Engelhardt said he was, why he was. Somehow, because the Chairman of the State Committee ruled the cosmos, and said so, Walter had to be nominated. So he sat, and just wondered. I thought I d try to open a dark side of life to his vision  be a missionary, as it were. Walter had brought the rod-case, and I dug out an old fly-rod and strung it, and put on a leader and three flamboyant flies a Scarlet Ibis, and a Grisly King, and a White Moth  regular flag effect. Then I charmed him with kind words to follow me down the pool a way, and he followed, lamentably com- plaining. He fell into holes. At last 1 got him where he couldn't hurt the fishing, and I showed him how not to hook the tree-tops, and how to work the automatic reel, and then I put the rod in his virgin hands and said  Fire away.  For about three casts he was doing it lo oblige me. Then an infant trout, out of an asylum for feeble-minded orphan fish, jumped at the Ibis and hooked himself enthusiastically. And I took it off and showed it to Mr. Spafford his first trout  And you wouldn t believe what a hurry he was in to cast again. It sure was funny. But that's the magic of the game. The primmest of humans aren t proof against the lure of fishing when they take some- thing. So he took another, and he was a figure of fun, standing on a rock in that wild place in his store clothes, gleaming at head and foot with 'brightness of straw and leather, prancing with excitement, and casting very fast. I showed him points, and he began to catch on. but he threw a tit when he hooked the Grisly King to a spruce tree, and I had to climb for it.  If you could go faster, Mr. Morgan. I d be obliged,  he panted.  There s a large trout in the pool which I can see, and I want to catch it.  And then a frank groan:  Oh, mercy, do hurry   So I yanked the fly off the branch and slid, and he was casting before I struck terra cotta. About then I began to be conscious that time was passing. I looked, and it was 4-30; the guides might be along any minute and we d have to go on our winding way in half an hour if we caught the train. I glanced across at Walter. lie was chang- ing a fly. He put a Brown Hackle in place of the Silver Doctor. He sent two or three short casts, letting out line, and the reel whirred sharp above the gurgling of the rapids. Then he loosed a reckless handful of line on the butt, and his wrist went back, and the ilies sailed high and forward and floated out over the pool and touched with- out a sound the Montreal under water, the Hackle skimming, the Jock Scott an inch over the surface. A corking cast, over sixty feet, I reckon. Suddenly there was a swirl, and the Montreal went under deep, with a steady old he-pull. No mistaking that taking of the fly it was a big trout. Sometimes a huge catfish will make you think he's a trout, but you can t ever mix a trout of large calibre with a catfish. It isn t done. I saw the swirl and pull, and I leaped into the woods and heard my scholar fisher- man wailing as I fled. I knew that Walter had on the whale, and the thought of the landing-net minus made me sick. I crashed through till I got back of Walter; then I called just a word:  Go slow till I get the net,  and up the trail I bolted to meet the guides. Right where the Green Velvet Brook comes in I met them: we call it that because there are yards of flat rocks each side of solid emerald-colored moss. Zoetique was prostrate on his lungs with his face in the drink: Blanc was dipping it up in his hat: the others were lighting pipes; my eyes lit on the four-foot handle of the net, and with that I lit on it. I grabbed it without break- ing the stride, and was loping back down the trail, and not a word said. Those men were surprised the tail of my eye saw that. I took the portage ai a hand gallop, and slowed down twenty feet behind the pool, and crawled out over the rocks to Waller.  The net is here,  I gasped at him, and Walter didn't throw me a syllable, but I knew he heard and would be civil when he got time. The brute was sulking. Down in the rocks blamed dangerous trick. It was all uneven on the bottom, and the rocks were big, and there were deepish holes, and W 70 The Campaign Trout if he could get the leader across a rough edge and yank, or if Walter pulled a bit too hard, lie could cut the leader and lie off in a second. He knew it too he was an educated person, that trout. Wherefore it behooved Walter to fish like an archangel. He didn t look the part, being screwed into a wuzzlc behind his gleaming glasses, but if pretty is as pretty does, he was a beauty. He held Mr. Sockdologer on a short line, just feeling him, and giving him a tiny lift now and then to keep the game going. Exactly the right amount, that s why fishing is hard; you have to do it right to a hair s breadth, which is instinct. You acquire it by patient years of losing fish. So the candidate for governor, huddled in a brown lump, sat on an inconvenient-shaped rock and held himself there by one lx ot planted in the water, and didn't give a hang for the governorship or the discomfort  those qualifications also go with a fisher- man. I lay along a chosen log six feet back, and watched the battle. And pretty soon I was aware of shapes that melted out of the trees, and it was the guides. They slid together back of me like a group of fauns or other woods creatures only half human, in the shadows, and there wasn t a sound from them, but a wreath of blue air floated forward in a minute, and I got the dim odor of Canadian tobacco. That odor al- ways seems to me just one remove from leaf-mould and growing ferns and spruce- needles and other forest-speaking smells. So there we all watched, while Walter fought the fight. And around the corner of the pool, out of mischief, Mr. Spafford, mad with excite- ment, fished his first fish with squeals of rapture and of agony. I couldn t see him, but I could follow the plot by the noises he made, and 1 had to chuckle, in spite of the real job on hand. First there d be an  Oh   high and sharp, of excitement and hojK  a trout was on; then an  O O  Oh   deep and mournful he d lost him. Then he d adjure them.  Come, little fishy,  said he;  nice fly  jump for fly, little fishy,  as unconscious as a kitten, and as lost in the game. And pretty soon I heard the men behind me giggling softly, and as I squinted up they were shaking en masse, and trying to see the debutant Izaak Walton around the trees. About then, out of the hidden deeps the whale suddenly rose right at the rod, com- ing with a smooth velocity that was terrific. The tip went up, and the reel ate line; the line kept taut. But it was a miracle that did it, and if the beast had got an inch of slack he d have shaken loose; he knew his job, the trout. And the next second the reel screamed, and off he went like a can- non-ball, out and out and out, tearing down the stream, and Walter had the rod straight forward, lowered almost to the water, giv- ing him line by the yard. It was a tremen- dous rush, and I tell you I was proud of Walter. That minute and the next two or three were the most superb fishing show I ever had the luck to be in at. For no sooner had the beast run like mad for sixty feet straight from us, than he whirled as chain lightning, and scooted for us, licketty- split. I thought that settled it; no human could manage line at that angle, I thought. I heard Zoetique gasp softly back of me:  Mats, bon Dim, e'est  ini " But it wasn t  fini.  Up flew the tip of the rod; Walter was turning the reel rap- idly, and the line was ripping in without a sag, without a jerk I never saw the equal of it. That, if you please, sir, is fishing. Also it was lightning. Quick  Heavings  It discouraged old man whale. Down he went into the rocks again, sulking, and I knew Walter would rather have him do rushes lhan that, for there s nothing so anxious in all fishery. You can t ever tell what minute s going to lie an earthquake, and you don't know what jagged edges he s got down there to jerk himself across, and you don t dare pull him, and you don t dare hold him easy. It's all guesswork, and mighty dangerous. Moreover, for a hole, the hole was shallow, and you had less lee- way with the line, and a mistake in gauging the depths would be fatal quicker than in deep water. So Walter had a handful and a brainful. Into that breathless situation reverber- ated a roar.  Oh, Mr. Morgan  Oh, Judge  Oh, Mr. Morgan come and get ME. 1 want to go  It s five o clock  Come, and get ME  It s five o -  And about there Waller looked up and frewned vaguely, and I arose and hesitated as to how to kill quickest. Walter s eyes strayed back to I he brown pool with the white bubbles doing waltzes and two-steps The Campaign Trout 71 across it, and with that, as I stood reflecting, I was aware that Mr. Spafford was trying to comc alone. All of two hundred yards  the dare-devil. I knew it bv a crash as of a bull moose, and a howl following. He d gone into a hole the first thing.   Oh, my  Oh, my   I heard him moan, and then more crashing, and the guides splashed sup- pressed laughter all over me, but Walter didn t hear. His soul was at the end of the thread that dipped out of knowledge at a point of the dark water. And in a second we were all intent on that same point, for the trout opened up hostilities once more. Without warning he gave an enormous pull and rose to the top and shook himself, and broke water, and beat with his tail, and tossed, and jerked, and rolled, and raised the most dangerous Cain ever, and Walter s wrist followed the ins and outs of it faster than any mind could possibly think. If your subliminal con- sciousness doesn t understand fishing you might as well give up when a trout gets to that act, for no up-stairs thinking machine ever could follow. However, Walter s sub- qualities rose to the strain and saw him through, and the whale went down again visibly tired from the struggle. And out of the woods burst our guest. So sad and bad and mad he was that I crouched before him.  Judge Morgan,  he fired at Walter, who paid no more atten- tion than if a puppy was barking:  Judge Morgan, I ll say nothing about the condi- tion of my clothes." So I took notice, and there was a six-inch square tear in the right knee of them clothes, and the piece flopped.  Too bad,  I murmured, and he glanced at me sarcastically as who should say he knew well enough I d put that stick to catch him, so I needn t be hypocritical. I le further addressed the court:  Judge Morgan, I ll suppose that my discomfort has not been caused intention- ally I ll suppose that.  Walter lifted the tip of the rod the least gingerly bit, and promptly lowered it; he was there.  Judge Morgan, I ll not further men- tion myself, but for Heaven s sake, for reason s sake, for Mr. Engelhardt s sake, stop catching that fish and come and catch the train. I adjure you, do not throw away the prize of your career, the Governorship,  and that was shrieked in large capitals. His voice trembled with emotion. He thrust his hand into his trousers pocket, and hailed a mere second; then he pulled out of that pocket as he went on 1 couldn t be- lieve my eyes he pulled out of that trousers pocket a small, slimy, dead trout, and cast it from him, and pulled out another, and up to six, and discarded them on the rocks contemptuously. And I gasped, and the guides lay down and rolled, choking, but his voice went on in great exhortation:  The Governorship  For a fish  Come, Judge Morgan. Be sane. There's time, but not more than time. We must start this instant we must hurry but we can make the train. Judge Morgan, I entreat you  come   And that  come  was a howl that pene- trated even Walter. When he s annoyed he s likely to take his glasses off.   le did that now, pulling them away hurriedly with one hand, and staring up at the exhorter near-sightedly,like a troubled bat.   What s all this " he growled, and threw me an ap- pealing, irritated glance.  I'm not going anywhere till I kill this fish you ought lo know that, Bob    and then he put his glasses on and threw one surprised glance at the little dead fishes on the rocks, and settled back to his rod, and I think plain forgot Spafford and me and everything else. I realized that the universe, barring the trout, had been put up to me, so I took the wheel.  Mr. Spafford, I'm sorry; but it s no use. Derricks couldn t stir him. If you want to go on, you can take two guides and make the train all right. I m awfully sorry, but my brother wouldn t drop his rod, as things stand, to be made Czar; we might as well give up.   But it s insanity  It s it's criminal  It s-  I just agreed.  All of that,  said I.  Only it s Walter. He s that way, and I can t change it. It s pretty selfish of course  and I looked sidewise to see if the criminal was taking in things, but not an eyelash quivered. The outraged Mr. Spafford held out a disgusted hand in answer to mine.  I shall tell Mr. Engelhardt, and he will be- lieve me, but he will not understand. No reasonable person could understand that a sane man would throw away the Governor- ship for a fish. Good-by.  The Campaign Trout At that Walter looked up with the nice 1 learning smile which makes him so popular and said pleasantly,  Good-by, Mr. Spaf- ford. Sorry you have to go. It would be nice to be Governor, Mr. Spafford, but it s necessary to finish the job I m on.  And in two minutes more the dumfounded youth was in a canoe between Henri and Godin, and the paddles were flashing down stream beyond the Golden Pool. Walter played the trout twenty minutes more forty-five minutes in all. There were more rushes, and more sulking, but the runs were shorter each time, and the brute was plainly getting tired. At last the battle was practically over, and the huge fish was swimming near the surface, rolling on its side and flapping its fins helplessly, and Walter drew it this way and that, wait- ing to land it till the psychological moment when it should be too tired to shy at the net and break loose, as happens often after a great fight. Zoetique knelt by him on the rocks, intent and excited, but responsible, and dipj cd the net softly in the stream to make it pliable, and then held its mouth toward the moving fish, following its course, ready every second for Walter s signal.   Now.  said Walter, and the net swept toward the trout, and the trout, with a last effort, splashed, tore, ran Zoetique had missed him. We all gasped in unison. Then for two or three minutes more the fish was played gently, carefully, back and forth, near the surface always now, and then suddenly Walter s chin lifted, and Zoetique, half in the water himself, brought the net around and up with a splendid sweep, and in it, high in air, flapping anti splashing spray over us, was the great trout  And when the net was lowered, and Zoetique got out his big dirk to finish the beast with a rap on the skull, v ld  he fell off the fly into the net. Lightly hooked as that, and Walter had saved him  It sure was a mighty fish fight  My  you ought to have heard Walter sigh. And one minute later you ought to have seen him grin. It was an hour of glory. Then the guides were given cigars and thinks, as is seemly at a great killing, and then the scales were dug out. Six and seven-eighths, just short of seven, the record in the club for the Salmo-Fontinalis on a fly. Of course, they're taken up to nine pounds in our waters in spring, but that s trollinga and no credit to anybody. The whale of the Golden Pool holds the record, to this writing, for s xirling fishing. And here ends the first chapter. Walter claims that here ends the story, and that the sequel is a detached incident. But 1 am now come to man s estate, and I happen to have a perfectly able hunch of my own about that. It s the sequel I give it. We went back to camp that night, and by care- ful observations my brother hadn t a regret in the world, and crowns and principalities and governorships weren t on his mind, which was et up by a huge gloat over his fish. He was the most deeply satisfied man I ever saw, that night, after he d  thrown away the Governorship  see Spafford as above. We trotted along back and un- packed our  bulirtand settled down, much like that Emperor of Russia and his thirty thousand men who drew their swords and put them up again. We stayed a week, and not an uneasy glance did I sur- prise in Walter, but once and again an amused one with a chuckle on to it, as some- thing recalled the Spafford episode. We got no mail and he seemed not to care. At length we broke camp definitely, and  Mid- dled down the lake in the sunshine of a glorious cold September morning, looking back longingly to where our long, low, log palace, barred and empty, blinked blind, reproachful windows at us through the trees. We did hate to leave we al- ways do. We got to the club-house at five in the afternoon, and everything was dead quiet; not even Demersc the steward, was in sight. So we wandered up through the birches to the big house and stood a moment on the veranda to watch the guides bring up the pacquctons. Walter was bossing it. so I just stared at the last wild woods picture I d see for a year. Around the cup of Lac a la Croix in front of us were two sets of mountains: one stretched calm miles of greenness and sunshine into the horizon; its double dipped deep in water upside down, and the wind zig-zagged wet silver across the submerged spruce spires. With that, out of the spruce spires as it apjieared, leaped Demerse panting before us, excited, much grinning.   lion iour, Demerse,  said Walter cheer- fully, and shook hands and went on bossing ZVtttu r by PA     J .

But Demerse wasn't to be corked that way. Not much.  'Bon jour, M sicur Ic Gouvertieur," he burst forth.  Ales felicitations a voire Excellence.

What the devil are you talking about   remarked Walter im jolite1y, and instantly translated, with that friendly comic grin of his which nobody seems to resist.  Qtiaw le diable est-ce que vans discs, Demerse     he said. With that Demerse burst into the club-house and brought forth bunches of paj ers. It was so. They d nominated the old rascal, whether he would or not. We read that first, and Walter was inter- ested enough and pleased enough to satisfy even Mr. SpafFord. Then 1 lit on a head- line in huge letters, which read:   Consider the Contrast. Candidates of Different Calibre. Holloway Leaves Sick Child to Make Speeches. Morgan Says   and then I yelped, and joy got in my legs, and I threw down the pajier and leaped a leap in mid-air.   Read it, Cub; read it, you young cuss,  Walter fired at me, and I read:   Morgan says:  It would be nice to l e Governor, but it s necessary to finish the job I m on.      In small type below was the story about the fish. All straight, too. Spafford in deep disgust had told it to Mr. Engelhardt, and the Chairman had been quick to see how to use it as a campaign catch. Hollo- way, Walter s rival, had left his small hoy, about to be operated on, to get to the con- vention, and was awfully criticised for it; so the picture of immovable old Waller sticking to his fishing made a grand set-off to Holloway s nervousness. We found it in pa  er after paper. Mr. Engelhardt said afterward that the simple account of Spafford s despair and Walter s solid rock-front of determination to get that trout first, and then attend to the Governor- ship, but to get the trout first anyhow  that the account of that did more for the nomination than Walter s presence could have done. It seemed to tickle the people to have him look after the job on hand, and l e impervious to everything else till he put that through and that s the way the old chap is. Single-minded. I brought him up rather well, if I do say it, and I only hope this governor job for he s elected now, you see isn t going to spoil our camp- ing trip next summer. So does Walter.

I would build me a house as a swallow builds her nest; I would curtain it with roses and the wind should breathe to me The sweetness of the roses and the saltness of the sea. Where the Tuscan olives whiten in the hot blue day, I would hide me from the heat in a little hut of gray, While the singing of the husbandmen should scale my lattice green From the golden rows of barley that the poppies blaze between.

And even when you look more closely, the compari- son holds. In the gardens the gorgeous hybiscus blooms beside the agapanthus, the heliotrope, and hedges of strawberry' guava; the bougainvillea transforms pro- saic cottages into Sicilian villas, and row upon row of pink amaryllis balance their shapely heads along the pathways, their lily-like flowers undeiiled by any' leaf. The finely drawn mountains, with infi- nitely broken surfaces, fold on fold along the sea, ashen in the white light of mid-day, rosy in the flush of evening, clothe their lower slopes with pungent thickets of southernwood and wild lilac where canaries nest and bluebirds whose azure wings flash in the sunlight, and the canon-wren whose song at daybreak awakens one with a thrill of pleasure.

Evening closed in, and the great eyes of the car, stronger far than the orbs of Jupiter, lit up, at each turn of the road, weird pictures succeeding each other with the bewildering rapidity of some phan- tasmagoria reversing the truths of nat- ure and, as in imaginative scenery, making light objects dark and dark objects light; flattening everything in their shadeless light; disclosing now a farm-house leaping from the darkness, now trembling aspens hung with heavy festoons of wild grape- vine, bordering a Styx-like rivulet; now solitary oaks of giant size, blocking the whole horizon, their great branches soar- ing aloft only to fall low again in pendant boughs then, in a moment, darkness, the stars overhead,and the white winding road. The festival, from my point of view, was not a great success. There were, to be sure, some pretty grapepickers  costumes, and a country' dance followed by a big dinner, with the first wine-press of the valley used 77 7S Italy in California as the piece de resistance in the decoration. Speeches were made deprecating the use of fiery liquors, but extolling the juice of the grape nectar of the gods and the tem- perate drinking of healthy wines that stimu- late, but so seldom inebriate. From another point of view, however, the festival to me was a great success, for at it I chanced to meet one of the two men who upon acres of vineyard spread out in the sunshine, drawn up in regiments and brig- ades, climbing the hummocks and descend- ing the other side; clothing the valleys with their battalions in close array, their van- guards even attacking the surrounding hills and, foot by foot, forcing back the natural growth of madrones and oaks to their fast- nesses upon the hill tops.

A day or two later I was visiting his vine- yards just over the mountain, named for the township in Piedmont that produces the most renowned of Italian sparkling wine  the Asti spumante. Situated on one of the upper reaches of the Russian River, in a wide and comely valley, surrounded by partially wooded hills, with the tall shafts of redwoods, last remains of the northern woods, punctuating their crests from time to time, Asti recalls the foothills of the Bergamesque Alps, or the lower slopes of the Apennines. While visiting here. I veritably passed my time in Italy, for even  one I met and every- thing I saw was Italian. My host, with the true Latin courtesy, spent all his time in driving me about through miles of vineyards, each named for some township in the motherland, anil pro- ducing the various well-known Italian wines: the barolo and barbera and the chiantis, white and red. We topped a rounded hillock, at one point in our drive, dominating the whole valley, and from it. as a general commands his field of operation, surveyed these acres And the vicissitudes of this twentv-eight- yearcampaign have l een many and varying. Started with an acre of mission grapes  and a bad start too. for the original strong Span- ish stock has never produced fine wines , many a setback has been encountered. The dreaded phylloxera has been fought and conquered; the inroads of sheep in a night have destroyed armies of tender shoots, while clouds of locusts have accomplished similar destruction. But here, as a reward to the general for his years of effort, now lie these acres of well-grown vines, bearing their tons of grapes; here live his country- men and their families, thriving and con- tent. As we drove on we met the pickers in the vineyards whole families of them, the babies asleep in empty crates, while men, women, and children filled pile after pile of boxes with great clusters of luscious grapes. Every once in awhile a big wagon drawn by lour mules  substitutes for the oxen in the old Chianti country , with long red fiocchi dangling at their ears, would come along and load up, then drive off to the great winery in the valley below near the railroad and the bank of the Russian River. Here for once Italian methods have been Entrance to the Villa Pompeii, Asti. abandoned. Instead of the primitive fash- ion of crushing the grapes in vats with the bare feet that still prevails in most parts of Italy, the enormous yield of these Asti vintages is crushed in modem fashion by machinery. The grapes are dumped from the boxes on to an endless chain that hoists them to a sort of pent-house at the very apex of the winery roof. Here the graj e crusher, run by electricity, grinds and stems them at a single operation, then throws them into troughs that lead down into the fermenting vats below. What a sight you see as you look down from this crusher onto the tops of the open tanks row upon row of them, each holding several thousand gallons standing in dusky aisles with shots of light at intervals illuminating the seething mass within, touching its myriad bubbles with magic, changing them to emeralds, rubies, topazes, diamonds. About ten years ago the capacity of even these enormous vats became so overtaxed that in six weeks time a cement cistern,with a capacity of half a million gallons, had to be constructed adjoining the winery. I said half a million gallons, and I meant it. It is a pride with these Italians to tell you that when the cistern was emptied after the first vintage they held a dance within it for a hundred couples, the floor well washed, but the walls still stained with that wonder- ful lie du vin the royal puq le residue of the crushed grape. Of economic conditions here at Asti I make no pretence to judge, but to the casual observer the colony seems happy and pros- perous. It is entirely sufficient unto itself having its own general store, its smithy, its bakery'  many a family has its own oven besides , its dairy, its quaint church la Madonna del Carmine, where they sing Gregorian chants on Sundays its school- 79 so Italy in California house and post-office, and a cooperage, one of its most picturesque features, down by the railroad a bit of the infernal regions this, with its red-hot braziers heating the barrels to bend the staves, while half-naked men hop round them, demon-like, madly beating the hoops into place. The families live in scattered houses, but the single men occupy dormitories near the Colony House, as it is called, the official residence of the superintendent. Any one who thinks of the Italian as a small, dark, and weakly looking man should see this native of Verona, six feet in his stockings and broad in proportion, deep-chested, with clear blue eyes, blond hair and bris- tling moustache, bestriding his fiery young stallion Amo like one of the king s corazzicri. The colony has its diversions also, and on fete days you may find them fishing by the river with the little square nets of the old country, or under the trees at evening playing home-made reeds and pipes. I spent most of one afternoon playing giuorlii di bocci in the line hard court down at my host's villa. Some years ago a visit to Pompeii suggested to him a country house modelled after the Casadei Yettiiand a charming idea it was. The villa is set in a grove of palms and orange trees. The atrium greets you with the familiar   salve  in the mosaic pavement; the peristyle, of highly pictorial effect, invites to quiet and repose with its long colonnades, its prim privet hedges, its cool fountain capped with a tempiclto; its Janus-heads and green- bronze pulti, and its panelled walls of Pom- peiian red framed in black and gold. Two giant oaks, centuries old, form a majestic background, separating the garden from the river, whose winter wash threatens its very existence. Just behind the peri- style and to the right, a group of hammocks swing in the cool recess of a large grotto made of parti-colored rocks, and so truly Italian in taste that one marvels until told that it was built stone upon stone by a con- hid i no, a simple peasant workman, after his own design. The gardens, full of quaint conceits and unexpected features, contain a numherof those gitiocht d'acqua,so familiar to all lovers of less formal Italian gardens, such as the Pallavicini, near Genoa. As you admire the goldfish in a basin or search in vain for a wondemest in a trcllised arbor, suddenly the pressure of your foot upon a trap concealed in the gravel path, or under the fallen leaves, turns a spigot and sprays your face with water; or should you l e thirsty and turn a faucet, the water gushes from a jet above as you start back, amazed and spluttering. Some years ago, when the Duke of the Abruzzi first came to California as a simple ensign on a man-of-war, he visited this Villa Pompeii for several days. He was accom- panied by six of his brother officers, among them one who was the practical joker of the party a sort of court jester as it were. It was a warm day when they arrived, and this young nobleman, spying the hammocks in the cool grotto, incontinently threw himself into one, only to bob up, aghast and bewil- dered, as a heavy shower of water sprayed down upon him. His companions, de- lighted at his discomfiture, at the joker joked, went into gales of laughter, and the Duke, in his amusement, backed into a tree only to receive a heavier shower in the back of his royal neck  The Asti colony, though perhaps the most important and most thoroughly Ital- ian, is by no means the only one in Cali- fornia. At Madeira, in the San Joaquin Valley, and in the broad fields of the Sacra- mento. there are important though more scattered groups of Italians, while in the gardens of Visitation Valley, flecked with the whirling shadows of scores of windmills, men cultivate the terraces as in Lombardy, weeding on all-fours in the vegetable pat- ches. drying garlic on the shanty roofs, and rearing their numerous progeny. The Italian population of San Francisco has always affected the district under the shelter of Telegraph Hill. I remember when I was a boy the fascinations of Du- pont Street, as it then was called, and its succession of wonder-shops where Bologna sausages encased in tinfoil hung in dazzling clusters from the ceiling; where tinned eels from Commacchio, and confetti in brilliant wrapj ers lay side by side in the showcases; where ponderous millstones rolled the dough in macaroni factories, while presses ground out yards of tagliarini and tortellini, lasagne and reginnini. To-day conditions are quite the same, for on this same street, now  irant Avenue, China-Bisleri and Fer- net-Branca and Florio's Marsala tempt Fisherman'  Wharf, San Francisco. acts as a gateway to the Quarter. It houses the larger industries: the steamship offices, La Veioce and the Florio Rubattino how familiar they do sound the Banca Popo- lare and La Voce del Popolo, the mouth- piece of the colony.

Near them the marionettes used to hold forth, and there have 1 often heard Orlando recount his fiery love, and seen the Palladins of Charlemagne slay Turk and Saracen in tme Sicilian fashion. Now, alas, the blatant nickelodeons and moving-picture shows have drawn away the patrons, and the last expounder of the doughty deeds of Orlando Furioso is driven to make his final stand in a small Sicilian colony in the Mis- sion. A few blocks further up The Avenue, as it is familiarly called, and you come to Washington Square, whose rows of vener- able cedars have sheltered generations of Italian children just as the elms of Wash- ington Square in New York have long sheltered the Italian denizens of the Bleeker Street quarter. Here the Italian Theatre thrives a large structure, clean and up-to-date. Except upon festival nights, it is a ten-cent show, but, I assure you, a good one. If you watch Modelled after the manner of Goldoni s comedies, simple, childlike in their nalvet 5, they are full of Italian character, and ap- peal strongly to the simple emotions of the fisherfolk and tradespeople in front of the footlights. l o give an example: a young modiste is discovered trimming herbonnets; to her appear in turn three suitors: a de- crepit but proud marquis, with monocle and rheumatic legs, then an overdressed but handsome young city chap, and finally Stentorello, the country clown, dressed after the old tradition in a sort of Watteau- esque motley, with spiked wig, long velvet waistcoat, small clothes, and beribboned knees. He is fond of cracking vulgar jokes, but with all has a certain peasant craftiness, gening the best of everybody, and, finally, of course, outwitting his rivals and winning the pretty milliner. The Italian quarter was practically wiped out by the great fire three years ago, so little of its outward picturesqueness remains. It was, however, one of the first districts to be rebuilt thereby showing the thrift of its population, but its new buildings evince but little Italian influence, excepting in the back   San Francisco Bay from Sausalilu yards where tomatoes lie drying, or fisher- men sit mending their nets, and on the roof- tops, where a vast space is always reserved for lines of clothes flapping in rows like scarecrows against the clear blue sky. Its double character, hall American, half Ital- ian, may best be summed up I think in a sign I saw advertising apartments to rent, and concluding with the mixed information  la chiavc al janitor in rear   Fisherman s Wharf still remains, how- ever, to delight the lover of the picturesque.

Long lines of tawny nets hang drying along the wharves, while men in gum-boots mend their broken strands, or readjust their corks and leaden weights, working, on rainy days, in a big shed near by, whose sombre ulterior pre- sents great possibilities for the painter, with its Rembrandtesque effects of light disclos- ing the heavy nets sus  ended from the 83 S4 Italy in California rafters, while dark figures in picturesque prospect than the views surrounding Fishc-r- garh move about, or work in the scant man s Wharf.

The gar.ieu  uf Visitation Valley THE WINGS OP THE MORNING By Calvin H. Luther Illustrations by Maynard Dixon H E desert is nut inhospitable; its doors swing all unbarred. It welcomes the guest with rich feasts of color and form, pouring the high wines of the air into his cup. regaling him with strange flavors. He lies down beneath an incomparable starlight, and the music of utter silence plays about his couch. But the desert is inflexible; to abide in it one must accept its will and its law. And the God of the desert is he not the God of the ancient Israelites  Herr Seifert came to Arizona in June, when the desert is at its best and its worst. He bore letters from a German university, and a brief but pointed introduction to the Indian agents of the Painted Desert region, signed by one of the Committee fin Indian Affairs. It appeared that he was a scien- tist of note and an authority on seismic and volcanic phenomena. He was a spare man, near-sighted, black of beard, unemotional, and a sceptic in all things. Once, being challenged to name the Twelve Apostles, he began with Galileo and ended with Kant. His monograph on the Duality of Things was regarded as a triumph of agnosticism. Using Winslow as a base, he traversed the lava-flows of the Mesa de Malpais, note-book in hand. Indians will not cross this plain; Mexicans will not even ap- proach the region. Herr Seifert penetrated to the black heart of it, lunched in the Kettle of the Devil, and returned unim- pressed. Next, the professor visited Canyon Diablo and the Meteorite Mountain. He found a crater which was not a crater, rock frag- ments struck off by celestial hammers, flakes of a star. He did not quote from Genesis, as the pious do, nor even exclaim, after the usual manner of scientists. He merely remarked:  So  It might have happened.  Then Herr Seifert came to Flagstaff. This town is to the desert what Gloucester is to the sea. Though a barrier of pineland intervenes upon the north, Flagstaff does not smell of the pine; though a principal railway sta- tion, Flagstaff is not aware of the fact. It faces toward the desert; it savors only of the desert. There is a suggestive sandi- ness in alley and yard; Mexican bayonet advances into the back streets; neglected gardens are overcome with sage. The people are burned in the face; eyes squint, brows frown, against the sun. The speech continually refers to the desert, to rain and the hope of rain. Showers arc measured in fractions of an inch, as diamonds are weighed in carats. Sand-storms, cloud- bursts, bombardments of lightning come from the desert; visitors arrive by way of the desert; evil-doers retreat into the desert; men stray into the desert and are lost. For the Atlantic north-easter, here is the sand-storm; for the corroding saltiness, here is burning sunshine; for drowning, here is dying by thirst death from the other end of the weapon  Sea and desert alike persist in savagery to the very doors of men s homes, are unimpressionable, ab- solute environments which do not reflect, but are reflected. Flagstaff may expand a little, extending suft gardens, pier-shaped, into the wild- erness. This is called  reclaiming the desert.  But as the sea has endured, so shall the desert; some time it may reclaim Flagstaff  Ilerr Seifert inspected the town, finding it raw and unlovely; examined the Navajo blankets, which seemed to him garish and of coarse texture; watched the play of colors at sunset, remembering that they were due to suspended dust; listened to the oracles of the barroom with impassive dis- taste, and finally went to bed. Next morning he rose up from his pipe and called for horses and a guide to take  5 80 The Wings of the Morning him to the Navajo Mountain country. He explained that he wished to see something of the desert, and would return in ten days. The landlord protested. Navajo Moun- tain was at the other side of everything, up against the Utah line a hundred and fifty miles 1  v trail. Nor was this the season for desert travelling most of the springs were dry, there was little grass even at the water- holes, the heat was beyond description. It would require three weeks at least, with long days in the saddle and danger from thirst. As to Navajo Mountain, it was the roughest country in Arizona; nobody went there, nobody wanted to go. He could supply four horses, with a buckboard to carry' feed and water; but he strongly advised against the attempt. Herr Siefert misunderstood, thought this a plausible argument in favor of a large and expensive outfit. He calmly replied that he required three horses only; would cany no feed or water; and that, if the landlord did not care to furnish the outfit, he would go elsewhere tor it. It s tempting Providence   asserted the landlord.   I am my own Providence,  replied his guest.   1 know of no other.  The landlord, being of philosophic tem- perament, merely stared and withdrew. Later he introduced a man named Ellison, as lean and swarthy as the professor him- self. though lacking his serenity of manner. Ellison, he said, was the only guide in Flagstaff who knew the country beyond Red Lake. The guide, using the frontier idiom gar- nished with many oaths, warned Herr Sei- fert of the danger of entering with so slender an outfit, but said that other horses and supplies could lie bought at Tuba. He added that he was not afraid to go the desert had never got one of his family yet  But he wanted it understood that he was not to be held responsible for anything that might happen. Herr Seifert, assenting, waved him away and sat down by the door. Leaning against a post of the wooden awning was an Indian a Navajo, moc- casined, dressed out in high colors, with heavy ornaments of silver, and a red scarf about his head. Herr Seifert studied him calmly, looking upon the barbaric dress as artful make-up, the cloak of a beggar. The Indian looked at Herr Seifert as the Sphinx might look at a dancing-girl from the Soudan. Suddenly his eye lighted; he spoke in harsh, deep gutturals, motioning with hands and body. Herr Seifert recog- nized the sign-language of the plains. But the landlord intervened.  Get out   he ordered roughly. The Navajo backed a little way, then stood still, his narrow eyes shifting from the professor's face to the ring he wore, to his heavy fob and chain. Then he pointed to the rude silver buckle of his own belt and back to the ring and chain.   He wants to make a trade,  explained the landlord.   Hey, Charley  What brave is this    He s from  way up; come in with two mountain-lion skins this mornin ; I never see him afore,  replied the trader, crossing over to the hotel. The Navajo turned, his face alight with eagerness.  He wants the ring," interpreted the trader.  He says lie ll give his belt and blanket for it. He thinks it s your medi- cine; he don t know the value of it. Ind- ians like tilings that glitter.  Herr Seifert drew forth his note-book; here was interesting material  The Navajo made a sudden exclamation, drawing the blanket over his face.   He thinks you re makin  a charm. He s talkin bad. Hey, clear out   The trader motioned away the Indian, who slouched a few steps down the walk and turned. He eyed the ring and the chain, held out a hand; then, with a last grunt, lie crossed the street and sat down in the shade, pulling the blanket over his head. Within an hour the guide clattered up to the door with two saddle-horses and a pack- animal. Forthwith the professor mount- ed and, cantering up the little street to the north-east, they entered the wilderness. The landlord withdrew to the barroom; the trader loafed along to his own door, where he sat smoking. At length some- thing called him inside. When he came out again, the Navajo was gone, the yellow pony was gone, and a little cloud of dust rose from the north-east trail. He shook his head thoughtfully, shrugged his shoul- ders, and went about his business. Ellison, a voluble, good-humored man, rode forward in high spirits, introducing The Wings of the Morning 87 Herr Seifert to the wilderness. This was the loco weed; this the quinine hush; that other a prickly pear. He could lather his face with the yucca root; the Indian women used cactus thorns for sewing; that was a pi non tree he wished he had some nuts. He discoursed upon his most private affairs, regretted that he could not leave the cards alone, told of a certain Spanish woman. The professor interrupted. to right and left along the aisles of the forest all without emotion. In this manner they travelled to the base of the mountains anti rested at noon. Here was thin grass, but no water. Ellison main- tained a resentful silence. The professor, occupied with his note-book, placidly ig- nored his companion. By nightfall, riding through intermina- ble stretches of forest, they came to Cedar  What ar  you goati ; to eta about it " vnarieJ KlLiSon  3.  There is too much talk. I wish now to lie quiet   Ellison s face glowed beneath the tan; his eyes narrowed; then he spurred for- ward and rode alone, driving the pack- horse with short curses. They followed a sage-gray trail by walls of yellow pine, through washes swept clean by the wind, with the Franciscan   eaks rising before. I ull-plumaged birds tlitted among the cedars; hares skimmed down the arroyos ahead of them; a mangy coyote followed curiously for a while. Always the land rose, always the sun shone, always the breeze held fresh from the south. These things were duly entered in Herr Seifert s note-lx ok as he rode. He sketched the ragged sky-line of the peaks, calculated the height of the pines, gazed searchingly and camped below a slim trickle on the hill- side. They supped on bacon, Ix-ans, and coffee. Ellison hobbled the horses, smoked innumerable cigarettes, and finally lay quiet, gazing up at the Milky Way. At last he broke the silence.  This is God s own country   he mur- mured, half to himself.  It is certainly a very desolate region,  rejoined Herr Seifert, puffing at his briar. Ellison did not reply. In the morning the horses had wandered far in search of grass. F.llison billowed them for miles, returning with them at mid- forenoon, warm and weary. This delay was most irritating; the professor was at no pains to conceal his displeasure at what he felt to l e inexcusable carelessness. His words were native to the class-room or the A Navajo brave. - mounted vri a yellow pony and slowly followed servants  hall, but full of cold venom to a plainsman. Ellison eyed him darkly for a moment, hands on hip; then strolled away, rolling a cigarette. As they mounted, he curtly said that they would camp at Willow Spring that night; that Herr Seifert would be wise to save the water in his canteen wetting his lips only, not drinking since the spring could not l e depended upon. The pro- fessor hardly listened, made no reply what- ever. His thoughts were busy with the out- line of a monograph on meteoric showers, commenced the night before. On this day they forced the horses, lunched meagrely in the saddle, and came to the northern skirts of the forest late in the afternoon. But Willow Spring was dry  They camped in an arroyo as bare as a bone, overlooking a wide l elt of chapparal and the desert beyond a gray coast and a yellow sea. The horses were very restless, and Elli- son hobbled them with care, making camp between them and the back trail. Also, he fed them the contents of a can of to- matoes, poured into his hat. Herr Sei- fert was surprised. Ellison shortly in- formed him that tomatoes were good for thirst. This was carefully noted, for Herr Seifert knew that even the most serious of reports lost nothing by occasional glints of humor. The guide, preparing to make coffee, took up Herr Seifert's canteen; it was ss empty  He dropped it and stood up, glar- ing at the professor.  You damn fool   lie exploded. Herr Seifert was amazed, then furious.  Be silent  You shall not speak so   he thundered.  What are you going to do about it   snarled Ellison, advancing a step. The professor, by 110 means afraid, was hot with anger: but the sudden shifting nf his horizon left him speechless. He had not l een aware of this man, except as a servant, and was guiltless of any intent to offend him. He ate his bacon and beans in silence, smoked, and rolled him- self in his blanket, without a glance at Ellison. The guide, having so far transgressed, planned other violations of the code. He would refuse to go farther would ride back in the morning, leaving Herr Seifert   to find the trail if he could; better still he would lead on to the Little Colorado with- out relieving the professor s thirst for a night and a day  He convinced himself that there was justice in this. Three times that night the horses stum- bled past them, remembering the little pool at Cedar; and at last the guide staked them out with lariats, cursing sorrowfully  for he loved horses. Twice more he n se up, sniffing, his chambered forty-five in hand. To Herr Seifert s brief question he made a brief reply: there were hydro- phobia-skunks about the camp  In the tbem, keeping 3 short distance to the right of the trail gray of early morning he shot one, aiming directly across Herr Seifert's body. The professor sprang to his feet, dazed and alarmed; but he glanced at the guide and asked no question. The drawn weap- on, still smoking; the lean, vindictive face; the sombreness of the hour and the sur- roundings these were not without effect upon Herr Seifert. He lighted his pipe, kindled a little lire of squaw-bush, and sat before it till daybreak. Meantime. Ellison t k1c away in the half-light, seeking the pack-horse, which had broken its lariat and escaped. In an hour the guide returned with the missing horse and they made a hurried breakfast without coffee. The professor was thirsty to the marrow of his bones, and longed for Ellison s canteen; but he did not risk an encounter. The desert, in certain aspects, is malev- olent, bitterly vindictive. At such times, men who abide in it either cling the closer, combining against it; or they draw apart in contagious hate. As Ellison threw on the saddles and drew up the cinches, he glowered at the professor; Herr Seifert, riding away, pulled savagely at his beard, planning to hire another guide at Tuba. In this manner they departed, following a zig-zag trail through dense chapparal lead- ing down to the desert itself. As they emerged from the arroyo, a Navajo brave, his hair bound by a red scarf, mounted a yellow pony and slowly Vol. XLYI1I. 10 followed them, keeping a short distance to the right of the trail. The horses lagged, heads drooping; barbs of the cactus, harsh twigs of mes- quite, tore at man and beast; hoofs sank deep in yellow sand; and the implacable sun kept them company. The professor hardly glanced at the high blooms of the yucca and the vivid cardinal  lowers. Liz- ards darted everywhere: ominous rustlings sounded in the brush: carrion birds swung low above the sage; but he made no entry in his note-book, asked no questions only rode and rode, in a bitter jungle of thorns and sand, worn, thirsty, scowling. Ear ahead plodded Ellison, sombrero tilted against the sun, cursing the horses, the trail, and the desert. Back of them the south wind played with the light soil, un- folding yellow banners of dust, launching sand-whirls abroad to left and right. Insensibly, by delicate gradations as a man leaves behind him the green of his youth they entered the desert. Far to the south extended the ragged wall of the forest; the outpost of the pinons grovelled in the dust of the lower slope; only the sage and the yucca, struggling in parched arroyos, broke the eternal sweep of the sands. The forest had been savage; the desert was fiercely malignant. Herr Seifert had traversed many wastes, by railway or cara- van; he had studied and written of des- ert vegetation and desert geography. But 89 90 The Wings of the Morning never had he encountered such Mistering sunshine, such overwhelming heat; never had he suffered such choking thirst. He called to the guide.   Let us rest.  Then " Have you any water   KHison turned in the saddle without halting.   Come on; we can't rest here  We shall reach the ford by night.  Then he held up the canteen.  There is a little water here, but you can't have it.  He couldn t have it  Herr Seifert spurred forward.  Give me the water   The guide reined in, facing him. His eyes seemed to reflect something of the desert glare; his face was not pleasant to see.  I told you not to drink only to wet your lips; but you knew belter. You re smart you think you know everything  Look at that   He  minted to the pack-horse, whose tongue protruded; then he dismounted, lie forced open the mouths of the animals, pouring a little water upon their tongues; he saturated his red bandanna and swabbed out their mouths again. Then he struck the professor's horse with the empty can- teen.  Go on, damn you   he shouted. In the desert, it seemed, a man might defy his master, insult him, curse him as he pleased. Hut the professor made no note of this only clung to the pommel of his saddle, raging in silence. He could no longer sit upright. His throat was swollen. He closed his eyes against the glare. Had either man looked behind, the dust raised by the yellow horse of the Navajo might easily have been seen, drifting lightly off to the north from the broken ridges near the trail. Suddenly the horses lifted their heads, one by one breaking into a painful canter. A wandering gust had brought them news of the Little Colorado. But Herr Seifert was fainting; in a few moments he reeled and fell upon the sands. The guide, with remorseful curses, laid him in the shadow of a rock, where he soon revived.  Hell  I didn t know it was as bad as that   he mourned, looking down upon the professor.  Can t vou hang on can t vou ride   Herr Seifert shook his head.  Well,  said F.llison,  it s only a few miles to the river. I ll take the horses and be back in a few hours with all the water you can drink. But you ve got to hang on to yourself. Just lie still; don't move.  He placed a blanket under the profes- sor s head, removed the coat, opened the flannel shirt, and spread his own hand- kerchief, still moist, over the professor's face. Then he rode away, spurring his horse, driving the other animals before him with loud shouts.  Don t move, old man; I won t he long   he called back. A certain rough gentleness in the touch, a note of real sympathy in the familiar address, cooled Herr Seifert s anger at once. He hail plainly misjudged this man  had l een too careful of his own dignity. But he would apologize, would reward him generously. lie thought of a wonderful bridle in the store where Navajo blankets were sold; that would be a fine gift for such a man  Weak, giddy, and racked with thirst, something of a smile came over his face. Meantime, the little dust-cloud fluttered ali.mg the ridge, growing as it neared. The head and shoulders of the Navajo appeared for an instant upon the hillside and van- ished. There was a long stillness. Then the Indian rose up from behind the rock and peered over it. Herr Seifert lay so that the ring and the heavy gold chain showed plainly from above. The Navajo could not repress a movement of eager- ness. The professor stirred; then sat up, listening.   Back already   he called. There was no answer only the whisper of wind upon the sands. He lay down. The Navajo withdrew, trotted softly to the summit of the ridge, gazed long down the trail toward ihe Little Colorado. Then he trotted softly back, knife in hand. Herr Seifert gazed at the sky, thinking of his old mother, of their green home on  he Louisen Strasse, at Bonn. How dark the Rhine flowed there so much verdure, so many brooks among the hills  He would soon lie back, telling the students of this desert, of the heat and thirst. But first he would reward the guide; surely, the man would not refuse it, after an apology. The Wings of the Morning He turned over, exposing his side. There was a Hash of bright steel in the sunshine, a little noise of struggling ihen silence. A half-hour passed, the strip of shade narrowing as high noon drew on. Lizards darted up and down the face of the rock, a great vulture circled above it. Herr Sei- fert stirred, moaned, opened his eyes, strug- gled to his feet, and reeled out upon the sands, calling weakly. Half crazed with pain, half blinded by the glare, he travelled as water runs, continually seeking lower levels. This carried him away from the trail, westward, into a shallow wash which runs to the lava plains of Black Mesa. He left a sharp trail in the sands; indeed, he could have been traced from a distance by the dust-swirls which followed and careered about him. Hut the hot south wind tilled in the tracks again; the pillars of dust sub- sided, or growing as they moved, marched out to the northern horizon. Before he had staggered past the first angle of the wash, the desert wore its accustomed look; the lizards were back u  m the rock, and the vulture had wheeled away to the red cliffs of Coconino. Herr Seifert came to himself at the bot- tom of a stifling arroyo, into which he had rolled or plunged from the sands above. He looked about him, bewildered. Then he became aware of his hurt, of his thirst. Suddenly, as a man recalls an event of which he was but a spectator, he remem- bered what had happened. A dark face framed in black hair; a lean brown arm; a knife which glittered in the sun this vision seemed burned in his eyes, confront- ing him wherever he looked. He shud- dered fearfully and swooned once more. The cold pain in his side pierced his stupor and awoke him. There was a stain below his heart, slowly growing larger. He was half unclothed; red lacerations covered his hands and feet; his linger bled where the Navajo had torn the ring away. So much blood, so many bruises, nauseated him. But he clenched his teeth, summoning all his will, determined not to faint again. As his mind cleared, he l ecame amazed that this thing should have happened it seemed like a lurid passage from a romance. He speculated as to his chances whether he should die of this or that, or be saved in the end. Finally, with the clear reasoning which had distinguished him at Bonn, he marvelled at his bodv at his own tenacity of life. Afterward he fell asleep again, or rather sank into a fevered stupor, whither the heat and thirst and pain of his wound accom- panied him. For hours he tossed in wretchedness, instinctively but vainly seek- ing relief from his tortures, shifting con- stantly about on the sharp edges of the talus. Once, a faint call floated down the wind; later, a succession of pistol shots. But Herr Seifert did not hear; he was at Bonn, worrying among the fires and fumes of his laboratory. Reviving, he opened his eyes to the shine of white stars. The rocks had cooled; a chill wind moaned in the arroyo. He tried to rise, but fell back, groaning; tried re- peatedly, at length succeeding. His   ody was a furnace of pain, his tongue so swollen that it seemed to fill his throat. This forced him to swallow constantly, though each effort was a separate torture. Hut the night wind, which is from the mountains, carries a little moisture. Grad- ually he strengthened, though his sufferings grew the more acute; gradually he forced himself to think clearly, though the horror of his situation grew with thinking. He decided at any expense to escape from the arroyo to the plains above, where a signal could be seen from a distance. Somehow he got upon his knees and climbed a little way among the  Perplexing shadows, each movement a fearful task. Hut his little strength was soon expended. The rattle of stones falling into the lied of the arroyo brought a coyote to the brink. For an instant the sharp muzzle and pointed ears were silhouetted against the sky, then disappeared. A long howl, ending in shrill laughter, insane chattering and Herr Seif- ert lay alone with the stars again. Fatigue sharpens into torture, subdues itself, then benumbs. Suffering is a mes- sage which may grow too shrill to be heard. Utter dejection of the flesh may loosen the bonds of the soul. Herr Seifert rested high aljove his pain, gazing almost placidly into the sky, await- ing death, inviting it. He had emptied the cup what other bitterness could pass his lips  He submitted, thankful for the stars glad to die in coolness, away from the sun. Drati'n   .

Ah, the tales she told to her they were not stars, merely  How well he remembered everything- 14   When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,   murmured Herr Seifert, nestling in the rocks, as though upon the lap of the little mother.

A dry sob was in his throat  the sob of a child alone in the dark. He strained his inflamed eyes into the night sky, panting. Texts, phrases long forgot- ten, swept in upon the freed currents of his memory. Sombre passages, read over and over by the gloomy Calvinists of Bonn, rang high above the drone of wind among the rocks. 14 My strength is dried up . . . my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death ... I may tell all my bones . . . they part my garments among them.   With thick lips Herr Seifert mumbled over the words, fingers plucking at the rags of his shirt. God  they were written for him  they were prophecies  4 Ich habc gcsiindigt   he whispered  "I have sinned " And for a long time he lay quiet, weeping. The deep blue of the heavens shaded into turquoise; uprose the morning star and the constellation of Mo-mo-bi, the Lizard, whereby the desert people foretell the dawn. A pallor crept into the eastern sky; high in the west a little cloud blushed suddenly; the shadows in the arroyo faded; the wind ceased. Herr Seifert rose upon his elbow, facing the transfiguration of the dawn. Gray turned to opal before him; bands of laven- der and purple spread tremulously, van- ished again chromatic harmonies dying to Vol. XLVIII. ii silence. A shaft of rose darted to the zenith, flickered and fell. High walls and spires, upraised from golden slopes, showed through mists of gold. Then a great billow of crimson submerged the lower sky; sub- sided, leaving pools of carmine; swelled again; advanced. The farther summits, the crowding pinnacles of the mist, caught the glow and flamed together. The heavens were encompassed in a conflagration  Gray rocks reflected it; the parched shingle of the arroyo lay purple and ruby beneath it. There came a sudden peace, a quieting of the tide; the high flames cooled; the drifting fumes of amber vanished. Uprose a single shaft of gold then another leap- ing to the high dome, wavering, shimmer- ing, gleaming brighter and brighter till scarlet and carmine faded before the radi- ance till east and west shone with the glory of it  Herr Seifert, trembling, stood up; wa- vered to and fro, his worn eyes alight, his face drawn with something not fatigue, not fear. He moved forward as in a dream, outstretching tom hands to the east.   The wings of the morning    he mut- tered, thickly. Then the full strain rose to his lips.    If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there even there-   Thus, as a bruised child comes stumbling home, Herr Seifert advanced to meet the sunrise. The desert bared its fangs, black jaws of the lava opened before him, again and again he fell; but always he rose again, facing eastward. The golden wings of the morning trembled a little, drooped, lay folded in the bosom of the east. The white sun leaped high; a furnace blast crackled across the plain. Staggering to the crest of a yellow dune, he fell and lay still.

REST HARROW A COMEDY OF RESOLUTION BY MAURICE HEWLETT 11.1. u s t k a t i o s n y Frank Craig BOO K I V    Continued  IV JOHN CHEVENIX, a ung and lively woman lb ash-colored hair, auda-  us nose, and a clear com- ixion, was devoted to her ..usband s family, and espe- cially tender to our young friend and San- chia s, with whom she had a strong alliance. Her husband had a sense of humor, which he indulged for the most part in silence. He spoke rarely, swallowed his laughter, and yet was good company. You felt his sym- pathy, found yourself depending on it. You gauged his relish by a twinkle, by a deeper shade of purple in his cheeks, by a twitch- ing ear. The Stock Exchange gave him a sufficiency, and his wife, with her taste for dinner-parties, saw to it that it gave him no more.  Let s bleed old Jack," was Bill Chevcnix s pleasant way of suggesting an 94 escapade which might run into hundreds.   It will do him good," Mrs. John used to say; and John Chevenix would chuckle in- ternally, and say,  Go it, you two.  On these terms they were all very happy. Bill Chevenix had told his sister-in-law as much about Sanchiaashe thought fitting. To begin with, he took all responsibility upon himself for the opening scene of her wild adventure. He had introduced   the chap" into the Percival household, and it was he, too, who had not introduced the fact of his unhappy marriage.  Took it all for granted thought they knew it forgot they didn t belong to that gang your gang, my gang, Ncvile s gang. Rotten of me, my dear, but there you are." Mrs. John un- derstood him to feel more contrite than he appeared. And next he lauded Sanchia, after his own manner. As thus:  A queer young fish. You can t judge her by the rules of the game. She shows her strength by breaking  em. She d break anything, and anybody. Oh, she s as deep as the Dogger. But mighty pleasant with it, you know. Fine, quiet style of her own. And a Beauty. My word, but she s like a rose.  Then his eyes met hers confidentially. A wink passed.   No. We re great friends. That s all there is to it, on my honor. But you can t leave a girl like that stranded, can you now   Especially when you ve run her aground yourself in a way. So 1 thought of old Aunt Wenman in a minute. In fact, I ve seen her about it, and, by George, she hit on a phrase in a trice.   Unfortunate attachment.  She s perfectly happy with that, and rather keen. Now all you have to do is to give a party and I ll ask Sancie.  Mrs. Jack thought that was too casual.  You mustn t treat her like a dancing man,  she told him.   1 shall call on her, and you can tell her I m coming. We ll do the thing in form.  All this had been done. Sanchia s still serenity, seen through the rosy mist of her momentary confusion, pleased Mrs. Jack. The invitation was made and accepted in parting.  Do come. Wc shan t have many people, you know; but I won t let you be dull. And Bill will be there, of course  and you rather like Bill and a queer old aunt of ours who knows everybody. So I hope you won t mind.   I'm sure I shan t,  Sanchia said, and then they shook hands. Bill Chevenix, who had been present, waved his ally away from the doorstep.   By-by, my dear,  he said.   You ve done bravely by me. Isn t she splendid     I like her,  said Mrs. Jack.   But she s rather unapproachable.  Bill chuckled.  That s her little way. She don t kiss easily.  Mrs. Jack said that he ought to know. The party was anything but dull. Lady Maria dined, with seven other people the best that could be mustered on short notice  and Sanchia came in at ten o clock, when the drawing-room was full. She camc with an elderly friend, a Mrs. Quantock, whose acquaintance she had made in an omnibus, and renewed at the British Muse- um. Mrs. Quantock was an authoress by profession, a poetess by temperament. Her emotions, not always under control, con- sorted oddly with her broad and placid face. She knew Lady Maria Wenman. and it was she who actually performed the introduction, Mrs. Jack being fast at her stair-head.  I particularly want you to know my dear friend Miss Sanchia Percival Lady Maria Wenman. A great heart. Lady Maria in a frame of steel.    Oh, indeed,  said Lady Maria, who knew something about these materials. Then,  Come and sit with me, my dear; I ve heard about you. But I hope you ve left your steels at home.  "If I had a trumpet,  said good Mrs. Quantock,  instead of a penny whistle, all the world should hear what I think of Sanchia.   Then it s a very good thing you have- n t,  said Lady Maria.  The less young ladies are trumpeted in public the better   Sanchia, during this interchange, had stood smiling and self-possessed; but she was a little fluttered, and looked none the worse for that. Without a word she obeyed the twinkling and puckered old lady, sat by her on the sofa and awaited, her hands fold- ed in her lap, what might be in store for her. She liked the looks of Lady Maria, and had no disrelish for her sharp tongue, nor fear of what might fall to her share when Mrs. Quantock took herself off. She liked the little deep-set, dark-gray eyes, the beaked nose, like the prow of a trireme, and the drawn-in mouth, which seemed to l e vic- tim of the astringencies it was driven to utter. And then she liked the signs of race, the disregard of opinion, the keen look which lit on a man or woman and saw him negligible and left him in the road. She had herself an artist s eye for style, and saw in Lady Maria the grand manner. The praise or blame of such as she would be worth having: awaiting either, she felt her- self braced. She could envisage the past, collect it, display it in her lap without fear.   Here s my life s work,so far as it has gone. Now beat me if you will; I'm not afraid of honest blows.  She knew there would be no sham outcries from this high-looking old dame. Lady Maria Wenman was rich, imperi- ous, whimsical, and afraid only of boredom. By birth a daughter of Lord Starcross, by fate the widow of a judge, she was strongly of opinion that she could do as she pleased. It was not so clear to her that other people could also; but the reason of that was that Rest Harrow other people, not immediately about her, were not themselves clear. She once said of a prime minister,   My dear, he seemed to me a very good sort of man ; and that was her attitude all the world over towards those not connected with her by blood or the affections. Marks of race she had, but not pride of it. She was her own fountain of honor, and were you omnibus-tout or com- mander-in-chief, if she liked you, you were in being, if not, you didn t exist. One curi- ous consequence of this was that she hated nobody, and was offended at nothing. The vices or crimes of a non-existent world were mere shadows, naturally; those of her cir- cle of cognizance she had a way, very much her own, of accounting for. A trick of hers, which had become inveterate, was to explain states of being by phrases. These not only explained, they seemed tocondone, and to her, there s no doubt, they accounted for everything. Mr. William Chevenix, much aware of her foible, did not scruple to turn it to his ends when putting before her Sanchia s case.   You see, aunt, one rather admires her loyalty to the chap. He was precious miserable, and she pitied him. Well, we know what comes of that, don t we  It turns to liking, and gratitude and all those swimmy feelings; and then they swim together, all in a flux, eh  And there you arc.  To which, when Lady Maria had nodded her head of kindly vult- ure sagely, and mused aloud,  I see: an unfortunate attachment. Very common, I believe, and quite sad  he knew that he had scored a point. When she had added,   We must do what we can, of course. I'll see her. I ve nobody with me just now,  he presumed that he had won the rubber. Apart from the comfortable dichi in which she was seen enfolded, Sanchia pleased the eye. Her father, in league with her throughout, had  stood  her a frock, the cunningest that Madame Frchichecould supply, and would have added pearls for her hair and neck, if she had not tenderly re- fused them. She took his counsels in the general that she was to show them what was what,  for the honor   f the Percival girls  and her own for the particular; would have no ornaments at all. By an entirely right instinct she chosc to wear black. It set her off as dazzlingly fair, as more delicate than she was. Her eyes, from her pale brows and faintly tinted chccks, gleamed intensely, bumingly blue. Her strength appeared in her shut lips and firm chin subtle, and, as Mrs. Quantock said, like that of steel wire. She did not talk much, but what she said was simple and direct. She seemed to be reticent about herself, not by any means from shame, but because her acts and in- tentions appeared too obvious to be worth rehearsing. Once or twicc her laugh, low and musical, showed that she relished a joke. Lady Maria occasionally made jokes. Here was a girl who understood them. To the old gentlewoman, who never beat about bushes, but mostly walked through them, Sanchia s bluntness made immediate appeal. Her reply, for instance, to the in- quiry, What had induced her to go on with the affair   was a countcr-qucstion.   What else could I do   she had asked, with pen- cilled brows arched.   I thought it made no difference. I wanted to, you see. What you do is nothing compared with what you want to do.  "Then why do it, my dear   said Lady Maria. Sanchia did not blink the answer,  Nevile wanted me. He was very un- happy.    Well,  said the old woman.   What is he now    This time Sanchia did not reply. Lady Maria drew her lips in until her mouth looked like a dimple in her face.  Oho  That s it, is it  He s neglected you, and now you don t care.    I care for some things very much,  said Sanchia.   I want to please papa, and Vicky, my sister, you know and I think I want to put myself right with the world. But-    But you don t care two pins about him   Sanchia shook her head sadly. Her brows were arched to her hair.   No,  she said,   I don t care one pin.  Lady Maria was no fool. She saw ex- actly what was going to happen, and no reason why she should not declare it. She had formed already a high enough opinion of Sanchia which" is to say that she liked her to be sure that it would not influence her conduct.   I ll tell you what the end of this will be,  she said.   You ll have him on the floor, kissing your toes. He ll be mad to have you and you ll marry him. Then he'll be your slave for life. And they tell me that s the happiest state a woman Rest Harrow 97 can live in. I have some reason for be- lieving it. I and the judge got along ad- mirably, though the poor man bored me to extinction. Oh, you ll do very well. But don t make him jealous.  Sanchia considered this.   1 don t think he would be jealous,  she decided;  but we are rather premature, aren t we   And then she related, as if they were an anec- dote, the circumstances of her departure from Wanless. Lady Maria listened carefully, nodding a dispassionate head at details which would have raised Philippa's hair, and depilated Mrs. Percival.  I think lie s a human be- ing, if you ll allow me to say so.  was the conclusion she came to.   It was no affair of the gardener s that I can see; and to be battered in your own drive by your own ser- vant, even you must allow to be provoking.   Oh,  Sanchia assured her,   I didn t at all mind his being vexed. But he accused me of all sorts of things.    Of course he did, my dear,  cried Lady Maria.  He was in a towering rage. How was he to know that you hadn't egged on the gardener     By what he knew of me already,  said Sanchia with spirit. Lady Maria twinkled; but her scrutiny was keen.  I don t think you have ex- plained the gardener,  she told her. San- chia blushed.   He s a boy,  was her suggested expla- nation; but Lady Maria s comment was,  And a bruiser, it seems.  Sanchia smiled gently.   Poor Struan. He was very difficult. He made me furi- ously angry. What he did was outrageous. But I am sure he s a genius.    What    cried her ladyship.   A genius for gardening  Or for thrashing gentle- men   Sanchia said simply,   It s extraordinary what he can do with plants. He s certainly a genius there. He s like a plant himself. He never goes to bed, but walks about the garden all night, talking to them.  "Like a burglar,  said Lady Maria.  Pray, what docs he talk to them about  Growing      Sometimes, I think. I don t know what he says to them. But he talks about all sorts of things.   You, for instance   Lady Maria asked, suddenly; and Sanchia blushed again, and presently looked at Lady Maria.   He s always nice to me," she said mildly.   I think,  her ladyship resumed,   I think 1 like to think of him l est in prison;  and then washed him out of her memory as she faced more serious topics.   It v. iU be much better for you to come to me,  she told Sanchia.  I m an old woman, and an old tyrant, I dare say. but I m somebody, you know. And I m pretty lonely, and happen to want company just now. It will In.  good that you have a foot- hold to your name when your Nevile In- gram comes afteryou. I shall bring him to reason quicker than most people, 1 don t doubt. Your quarrel is absurd; you can f afford to be picksome with your bread and cheese. You ve your father, you ll say; but my answer is that it s not very decent to live upon your father when you ve got yourself kicked out of his house. I quite see your point of view, mind you. These things will hapjien. and in theory you re perfectly in the right. It s your practice that won t do. All for love and the world well lost very fine indeed. But so long as we re in the world, you sec, we can't lose it. There it is  Now you ve had your kisses, and can afford to settle down; but you must do it in the world s way if you want peace and quiet- ness; and I m very ready to help you. Really, I don t see anything better for you  short of your own home.   I shall never go there again,  Sanchia told her directly.   Very right, my dear,  said the old lady. " Then you had better come to me.  Sanchia said,   I should like that," and Lady Maria, taking her by the chin, patted her cheek.  And so should I, my dear,  she said  and the thing was settled. Mrs. John, released from her stair-head, came up presently; Bill Chevenix was with her.   Dear Aunt Wenman,  she said,   1 haven t had a word with you since you came; but I m sure you ve been happy.    Miss Sanchia and I have l een swearing eternal friendship,  said Lady Maria.   Exchanging drops of blood, eh, aunt    chiq ed the cheerful youth.  Nothing like it.    I have no blood to spare. William,  she replied,   and if I had, Miss Sanchia has too much. Now you can take her away while 98 Rest Harrow I talk to Helen. Good-by, my dear,  she bade Sanchia.   Good-by, Lady Maria,  the girl re- plied with deeply sincere eyes.  You ve been very kind to me.    Fiddlesticks '  said Lady Maria,   I like you. Now run away, the pair of you.    Right, aunt,  said Chevenix, and crooked his arm. After a decent interval, in which we may suppose formal visits exchanged between Charles Street and Great Cumberland Place, Sanchia set up her rest in the former haven. The time was full June. V The string of episodes which discovered before the autumn wasover the heart of Mr. Cyrus Worthington at her feet hardly de- serve record in her history but for the spring which they gave to her spirits. Tribute is tribute, and Mr. Worthington was a warrantable gentleman. The tar- nish she had discerned upon her armor, the foxmarks upon her fair page, dis iersed under his ardent breath; she realized her- self desirable and loveworthy; she arose from the thicket in which she cowered with the light of triumph prophetic in her eyes, the llush of victory after victory prophetic in her cheeks. Therefore Mr. Worthing- ton s career in the Charles Street lists shall be chronicled. He was a portly widower, a banker, a father, who made his bow to Lady Maria some three times a year when he dined in Charles Street. In return, he received her ladyship once during a summer at his man- sion of Fallowlea, Walton-on-Thames. On such occasions the Misses Worthington and their cousins, the Strensham girls, who lived at Esher, would enact a pastoral play in the shrubberies with various entangled curates, with young Sam Worthington from Oxford and friends of his. Mr. Worthington him- self, master of the difficult art of declaim- ing verse as if it were encumbered prose, rehearsed the Prologue and Epilogue, in a master s gown and mortarboard, which he would retain for the rest of the after- noon. It was in that guise that, his caution deserting him, he allowed himself to dwell upon Sanchia s beauty. Lady Maria had taken her down to Wal- ton in mid-July; she had chanced to meet Melusine there, and the two had embraced as sisters should. It is to be owned that her adoption by Charles Street had restored her credit with her family more certainly than any white sheet and taper which she could have supported could have done. Her mother was highly gratified, though she af- fected a shrug when good Mr. Percival, in the simplicity of his heart, overflowed with the joy of it.   Sancie in Berkeley Square  where Lord Rosebery lives: think of that, my dear    And Mrs. Percival, who knew where Lord Rosebery lived as well as any- body, would reply,  These things will I  balanced hereafter. Neither you nor I, Welbore, are Assessing Angels, I believe. I pray to God that she has made her peace with our Church.    Chapel Royal,   said Mr. Percival,   will be her ladyship s ticket  or St. James's, Piccadilly. They tell me that the great world go there now in the evenings, dressed for dinner.  Privately he vowed that, should his Sancie be one of those immaculate worshippers, she should not fail in toilet. And he had not missed the point so far as you might think. Phi- lippa Tompsett-King, who had been pres- ent when these things were discussing, had lifted an inflamed face over the dinner- table.   I only know,  she had said,   that I would rather live in Bloomsbury than have her conscience. Cynicism has always seemed to me the Sin against the Holy Ghost.  But Melusine Scales, the gentle creature, had written meekly of her joy; and Vicky Sinclair said to her husband, the captain  Sancie always tumbles on her feet. She always did like a sweet cat.  Shrewd and affectionate at once; she alone had discerned the god s prerogative imma- nent in the youngest daughter of Thomas Welbore Percival. Now the picture of Sanchia andMclusine, two fair girls, standing together embraced under the cedam shade, had smitten deep into the heart of Cyrus Wrorthington. He had come upon them at a pretty moment, when Melusine the willowy and tall, having opened her arms to the dear truant, one arm still about her, with her free hand touched her cheek that lips might meet lips.  Dar- ling, I m so glad so very glad,  she was whispering, and Sanchia, with the same light laughing in her eyes,   Dear old Melot  how sweet you are to me.  Mr. W'orth- Rest Harrow 99 ington pushed back his mortarboard and re- vealed the crimson chevron which it had bitten into his bald brow.  A charming scene two charming young ladies. Mrs. Gerald Scales, and her sister, I think. Lady Maria s adoption charming, charm- ing.  A right instinct sent him tiptoe over his lawn, another made him dolT his mortar- board.   Mrs. Scales, we begin. The hunt is up. Poesy calls,   Follow, follow, follow    Your sister, I think   Sanchia played the rogue.   Oh, Mr. Worthington, have you forgotten already  Lady Maria explained me half an hour ago. Must Mclusinc introduce me again      Not for the world, Miss Pcrcival, not for the world   the banker protested.   I was, in a sense, explaining myself. Pray do not suppose that I could forget either you or my manners so completely. No, no. But I am a little near-sighted, 1 fear; there is a little difficulty of focussing: nothing or- ganic. No loss of function.  He cleared his throat, and to give himself assurance, jingled half-crowns with his plunged hand.   No loss of function whatever.  He took the thing a little more seriously than he need, was in danger of laboring it. Melu- sine turned the talk. He invited them to the play, as  master of the revels,  and walked between them, looking a very' decent figure of a don on a college lawn, substan- tial, serene, and with anairof displaying his possessions: Pan a sed apta mihi: Deus no- bis hate otia fecit. He still possessed the rags of his Latin.   This little bay-tree will interest you, Miss Perci val. It was planted many years ago, by the late Lord Meeke  the uncle of the present peer. We had had some business relations; they' were happily cemented into something more intimate by this little fellow.  He touched it tenderly.   A sturdy growth  Like my' friendship for my noble but departed friend. Dear me  4Labunlur anni, indeed    His fig-tree, which some one else had planted, his la- burnum a slip from one at Rickmans- worth, the seat of the late Lord Mayor Burgess a catalpa seedling from Pans- hanger, which the late Lady Cowper did him the honor to present with her own hands: as Sanchia said afterwards to Melot, his garden was rather like a cemetery of dead friendships. . . . Then they sat to witness the revels. San- chia s fancy, uplifted by her contentment, played with the play, and suggested flights undreamed of for many a year. She sat by Melusine and her husband, and Mr. Worth- ington watched her in the long intervals of his duty. Charming indeed, and most high-bred: now where did old Welbore Percival, whom he met daily in Throgmor- ton Street, fetch up such a strain of blood   His wife, too, Kitty Blount, as she had been  what had Kitty Blount been but a high- colored, bouncing romp of a girl when they had all been paddling together at Broad- stairs  Extraordinary  And now here was one of his girls sister-in-law of a county baronet none of your city titles, mind you, and the other, with the lift of a princess and the clear sight which is hers by title. Ex- traordinary  And there was another thing: where had old Welbore and Kitty Blount kept her all this time  And why wasn t she married, a girl like that  She came next to Mrs. Scales, he supposed. Well, but there was another, younger still, married only the other day to an army man. He remem- bered Welbore chirping about it at a Board meeting. What was that in the Bible  what was it  Ha    But thou hast kept the good wine until now.  By George, he must remember that for old Welbore. And now he came to think of it, old Jack Ether- ington had come in one morning full of Percival s daughter  A lovely gal  he had said, old Jack  Color of a Mildred Grant quiet as the truth.  Such were the ruminations of Cyrus Worthington at his own garden-party, and he pursued them at favored moments  with his glass of port at dessert, with his last cigar, with his whiskey night-cap. In the city next day, he rallied Thomas Wel- bore, who betrayed unlimited relish for the diversion; and within a few days he left a card in Charles Street and took a late train to Walton-on-Thames. Asked in due course to dinner, he handed Sanchia to the table, and spent the evening by her side. He begged her better acquaintance with his daughters, made the most of that which he had with Melusine Scales, and ended a suc- cessful adventure by winning Lady Maria s acceptance  for herself and her young friend," of a banquet at the Coopers  Com- pany of which he was warden. The occasion was a great one a foreign potentate, the 100 Rest Harrow Prime Minister, Lord Mayor and Sheriffs. The Coopers were to distinguish themselves, or be extinguished. He could promise them of the best. Sanchia, new to court- ship, was quietly elated, and her amuse- ment did nothing to diminish her elation. She had never, she thought, been wooed be- fore: there had been nothing of the kind in those shuddering days when she and In- gram, trembling in each other's sight, had mutely cried across the waste of London for balm upon their wounds. The flattery of attentions had never l een hers, nor the high credit of admiration so respectful as the Rood merchant s. Had sh  forgotten Sen- house, who had loved her so much that he fled  I think that indeed she had at this moment; it must be owned that Mr. Worth- ington filled the scene. He esteemed her the fairest of women, was as timid as a boy in her company, gasped like a fish and grew unmannerly hot: I defy a young wom- an to be anything but gratified. Miranda shunned Caliban; but had she not rather he had been there to be shunned   Thus, under Lady Maria s watchful eye, the thing proceeded, and Mr. Worthington, within an ace of committing himself, scared his family. The climax was reached at Kissingen, whither the infatuated gentle- man had followed his charmer. She was very kind to him, but perfectly clear that she could not, and would not, make him the happiest of men. She said that she was flattered, which I believe to have been true, though he deprecated the phrase.  My dear young lady ha  I must really be allowed I assure you that you overwhelm me. Flattered oh, Lord    He limped the conclusion, and left for Eng- land that night. She felt the thing t   have been rather ridiculous, and yet she was pleased. She was gently elated, and had a kindly eye for herself as she dressed before her glass. Power lay with her; she could choose and weigh, accept or refuse. She was love- worthy yet. In spite of her disaster, a man had sought her; others would, moved by what bad moved him. Shining eyes, body s form, softness, roundness she bad hardlv thought of these things l efore, nor looked at them with an eye to their value. Mr. Worthington s ardent glances had illumi- nated her own, and by and by she found, oddly enough, that they threw a backward beam, and illuminated others. She found herself smiling tenderly as she thought of Jack Senhouse, repeating some of his poetry which he had poured literally into her lap. It was so long ago I But when she remembered how much it had puzzled her, she now found that she was not puzzled by it at all.   Your eyes are twin mountain lakes, and the lashes of them Like the swishing sedge That hideth the water's edge.  . . . Were her eyes, then, so fair  Mr. Worthington bad found them so. Others would others had.  Thy face drinketh the light  he had written that of her and now she knew that he had believed it. Had Nevile felt these things  Could Nevile as she knew him  Her lip curved back. If she could not think of herself without thinking of Nevile  who wanted to mangle her better take the veil. But she felt a strange reality behind that wild and adoring passion of Jack Sen- house's, which had made him so incalcu- lable a mixture. He had advised her, and adored, he had received her confidences, and emptied verses out of his heart into her lap. And she had had nothing to give him, who had given her all  There was his last letter a despairing cry from Chanctonbury, written when she was Nevile s shadow, or he hers. She felt stabbed to the heart to remember how per- functorily she had read that. How did it go  What had he said  She could not recall the words, but their sense beat upon her. Oh, he had set her too high  He had called her Artemis the chaste, the bright. Artemis the Bright had been one of his names for her and Queen Mab another. He had set her too high  And how far had she fallen  She bowed her burning head, and even as she did so, remembered an- other phrase of his, sent with flowers a line from the Anthology, begging her to grant his rose  the grace of a fair breast.  No longer fair, no longer fair except to Nevile, who craved it and to a Mr. Worthington. The bravest gentleman, a poet, a thinker, a man like a bcacon-fire, had loved her, and rricd her aloud as a goddess out of his reach.   Farewell, Sanchia, too dear for Rest Harrow 101 my possessing .  She had the words. And she had passed him by for Nevile, who made her a housekeeper, and loved her when he wanted solacc. What more had Jack said   What, indeed, had he not said   That her mere act of living, her mere daily conduct, was like the scent of bean-flovvers over a hedgerow a fragrance tobecaught in pass- ing by wayfarers, whereby men and women might thank God for a fair sight who had chanced upon her in the street. Praise in- deed  But he had loved her, and saw her so and all that was gone for ever. He had left her because he dared not do other- wise, and now he was happy without her. Her elation was like to die in self-pity. It required more than the complacency in- spired by Mr. Worthington toclear her eyes. Thus were the flowers laid up for her by an honest merchant changed for a wreath of rue as she was reminded of his letter  his 1 letter, and hers, alas  A wave of de- sire to catch back at far-off things played her a trick. She found herself yearning for her childhood, found herself crying for her innocence, for the sweet scent of opening life. Even as she longed and strained, she knew herself vain. But the temptation for the semblance of what was gone was strong and took a subtle form. If she could not have the thing, she would have the thing s name; if she could not be innocent again, she would ape innocency. Prodigal of Pity as she had been, she could say to Sen- house s ghost, I am no more worthy of thee; and from that to being worthy was but a short step. The rest of her sojourn abroad was preparation for what was to l e done on her return home. Her treasure lay hidden in a desk in her room. Three portly packets of letters, tied with ribbon, and labelled  Jack to Me.  Stained and yellow sheets, she now turned over the pages, and inhaled the faint, sweet scent of them a scent as of lavender and tears. Her eyes filled, her heart beat; but she read on and on. Impossible praises  Love beyond reason, without bounds im- measurable homage  So presently she was caught up into a kind of heaven of wonder, and spent a night with the past. . . . From that she arose clear-eved to meet the future. If she had been so loved, so served, by a man so generous and so fine, the rest of her life might well be spent in testimony. Her single aim now should be to recover herself, to be what lie had seen her. And for all this high remembrance and high hope  thanks to Mr. Cyrus Worthington. Lady Maria, as the weeks went by, watched her carefully, and marked the change. Sanchia was very sulxlued, and now went to church. This to the old lady, who did not, was remarkable. She was not aware, naturally, of a passage in a letter which pictured her in church with her "dear obsequious head bowed in a fair place to a fair emblem.  She could not have understood, if she had had it ex- plained, that the girl, conscious of her stitf neck, was teaching herself obsequiousness for the sake of him who had seen her so and found her dear. None of these things were for Lady Maria's comprehension; but she reflected aloud upon church-going, and got her young friend to explanations.   Yes,  Sanchia said,   1 do go to church. For a long time, you see, I couldn t but now I feel that I can. We were all brought up to go to church.    So was I,  said Lady Maria,   and that, I take it, is why I don't go now. I was taught to take it as physic.  Sanchia s explanation, which she yielded on pressure, of why she had stopped, was very artless.  I wanted to do something that they thought wicked, but which I thought quite good. If I went to confes- sion, 1 should have l een told that I was wicked. So I couldn't go. It was a differ- ence of opinion, you see.    Beg pardon,  said Lady Maria,   but I don t see. What you mean is that, if you d told your priest you were going oil with In- gram, he'd have said Don t,and put you un- der the necessity of disobeying him.  This was owned to. And then she owned to something more. If the diflicult choice came l efore her again, she would think twice.   I can t see. even now, that I was wrong in what I did. 1 am sure it must be right, somehow, to follow your own conscience. But I do see that it s a pity to break rules. Yes, I see that.    I didn t suppose myself religious,"Lady Maria had replied.   but if that is what your religion tells you, I agree with it. It's com- mon sense. What s a heart or two com- pared with peace and quietness   And how. 102 Rest Harrow pray, is a child of eighteen to know what her conscience is worth     It is all she has to go upon,  said San- chia; but the old lady retorted,  Nothing of the kind. She s got the experience of all nature behind her, from the poultry-yard to the House of Lords. You ll find that the Ten Commandments are rigidly enforced among the cocks and hens. If a member of the zenana breaks bounds there, she rues it. How else do you suppose this world is to be peopled   Read the history of mar- riage, my dear. You ll find that the more primitive your man the more complicated his marriage laws. Why, bless my soul, I don t need the Church to tell me that 1 mustn t run away with a married man. I can leam that from the pigeons in the piazza at Venice. But I suppose I m an old pagan. Now, you run away to your priest and make a clean breast of it.  Perhaps Lady Maria was fanciful, but she put down this return to the Church s knees to the fact that Mr. Worthington had gone upon his.  The child finds that she s a valuable article,  she said to herself;  so she locks herself up in a cupboard, like the best china.  Sanchia s resolution persisted, and enthusiasm followed its growth. She frequented the churches early in the morn- ings, and one fine day presented herself in the vestry of one of them. Upon her knees, but with unbent head, she rehearsed her talc from the beginning, neither faltering nor losing countenance. What followed upon that was notcommunicated to her pro- tectress, nor do I care to pry. I imagine that she had always said her prayers, but that now she was answering them. That is, when one thinks upon it, the first office of prayer. VI Lady Maria Wen man grew to be ex- tremely fond of Sanchia, really as fond of her as she was capable of becoming of any- body. She had been good to travel with, and was good to live with. She found her so reasonable, she said. One could discuss anything without shocking her, or without fear of being made uncomfortable by seeing her discomfort. Lady Maria, in fact, be- ing entirely without prejudice, experienced the little luxury of being able to express her- self without trampling. On her side, Sanchia sincerely liked her old protectress, and found Charles Street agree with her. There was a primordial air about it which made habits seem like laws of nature; an absence of fuss which soothed her nerves, and did much better than slay her monsters for her, when it exposed them for no monsters atall, but simple, every-day, rather tiresome concomitants of our make- shift existence. 41 You will, of course, marry' Nevilc In- gram  thus Lady Maria disposed of the most dread of all her monsters   because it is, on the whole, more agreeable to avoid scandal, and because it is certainly more de- cent to pay one s bills. Long credit is a mistake, but you found it a convenience, I suppose; and now you are in funds, you will, of course, get out of debt. If only that you may run into it again at need, you will write a cheque. Now, you had eight years of it at Wanlcss, you tell me  Very well, my dear, that must be written off society s books. Meanwhile, the more you see of amusing, emancipated people like Alexis Morosinc the better.  This man was understood to be a Pole in exile, though his title to that distinction could only have l een on the side of the dis- taff, since his father s descent from a ducal family of Venice was not denied; but neither nationality nor expatriation was very obvious upon him. At first sight you would have supposed him a sallow English- man, spare of llesh and too narrow in the chest; you might have put down his dead complexion and his leanness to India or Jamaica, and been inclined to attribute his dry cynicism to the same super-fervent ex- perience. But presently you would be alive to his hungry mind, to his hungry, ranging air, his restless habit and large way of looking at circumstance as if by no pos- sibility could it be any concern of his. And then the trick he had of considering our people as Europeans, of dividing the races of the world by continents rather than king- doms; and that other of judging all cases, including yoursand hisown,upon their bare merits such traits, to an experienced mind, would have established him for a foreigner, one of a people who had had too much el- bowing for breath to have time or space for prejudice or minute classification. Super- ficially, to be sure, he was English enough  from his speech to his tailoring; and his phlegm  of which we boast  was unassail- Rest Harrow 103 able. Nobody knew-much of his history: Bill Chevenix used to say that he was bom whole, and thirty, out of an egg dropped upon our coasts by a migrator ' roc; that lie stepped out, exquisitely dressed, and or- dered a whiskey and Apollinaris at the near- est buffet. This, said Chevenix, was his or- dinary breakfast. When Sanchia objected that he might have stepped out in the after- noon,he replied thatit alsoformed his usual tea, and, so far as he knew, was the staple of all his meals.   And cigarettes,  he add- ed.  But he would have had those with him. I bet you what you like he came out smoking.  It was certain that he had been to Eton and to Oxford, and was member of two good clubs, lie was extremely rich, and he was by profession, said Chevenix, a prince. He had no territory, and was not apparent- ly scheming to get any, either of his own or other people s. Nobody at the Foreign Office believed that he corresponded with any intransigeant; he used to go there often and exchange urbane gossip with under- secretaries. He lodged in Duke Street, gave dinner-parties at the Bachelors, had a large visiting-list, and was, as they say, always  about.  One saw him every- where in the city, in Mayfair drawing- rooms, at Kensington tea-parties, and at Lambeth Palace. Chevenix swore that he had met him at a Church Congress and the only answer to that was that if Chevenix had truly been there to see, Morosine might well have been there to be seen. But this catholicity of experience was characteristic of the man; his attraction to the nice ob- server lay precisely in that, that he was a nomad, unappeased and unappeasable, ranging hungrily. There was a probability, too, that below a surface exquisitely calm there lurked corrosive tooth and claw. Here are sufficient elements of danger to draw any woman: so Sanchia found herself drawn presently. He came to Charles Street one evening late in November, to what Lady Maria called a little party. There was an autumn session that year, and London full. To her little party, then, came a solid wedge of three hundred people into rooms capable of holding with comfort fifty. Chevenix was by his fair friend at the top of the stair, chatting pleasantly about every new-comer, when he suddenly stopped.  Hulloa,  lie said.   Here s Morosine, as smooth as a glass stiletto. He ll amuse you. I ll introduce him.  Sanchia followed the leading of his eyes. She saw a tall and slim young man, inor- dinately thin, slightly bald, with a mus- tache likearake,and heavy-browed, mourn- ful eyes, pushing his way slowly upstairs. Without effort, his hands behind his back, working from the shoulders, he made room for himself, but so quietly that nobody seemed to observe how aggressively he was at work. Occasionally some ousted dow- ager turned redly upon him, or it might be some pushing gentleman smothered an oath as he faced the attack. But Moro- sine s mournful eyes gazed calmly their fill, seemed to be communing beyond the surg- ing guests, beyond the wall, with the eternal stars, and, without faltering, the narrow frame glided forward into the space which indignation had cleared. Sanchia, above him, and out of the game, was highly amused.  He s very selfish, your friend. He takes care of himself; but no one seems to know it.  Chevenix chuckled.   That s the beauty of Alexis. But, as he asks, whom else should he take care of  It s not queer if the Poles have learned that lesson.   Oh,  said Sanchia.  Is he a Pole   Jack Senhouse had been in Poland.   Half of him is hungry Pole. The other part is bad Italian pampered Italian, fed for generations on oil and polenta. He s always dining out, but he eats nothing be- cause the Pole is feeding on the Venetian all day.  Then he told her about the miracu- lous birth, the whiskey and Apollinaris, and concluded,  Oh, he ll amuse you vastly. Stay where you are. I ll net him at the top.  Presently after she saw the process. It consisted in violent effort on Chevenix s part, languid attention from the other. Morosine dreamed over the speaker as if he were a lost soul. Then, his considera- tion being caught, he looked about him, and presently fixed upon her his melan- choly eyes. She felt a little shiver, the sensation of goose-flesh in the spine not unpleasantly. It was as if a light wind had ruffled her blood. Shortly afterwards Morosine was bowing before her. In this, 104 Rest Harrow perhaps, he betrayed himself; his hat cov- ered his heart, he inclined from the hips, and his head bent with his body. An Eng- lishman bows with the head only. He began to talk quietly and at once, and maintained a perfectly even flow of com- ment, reflection, anecdote, reminiscence, and sudden, flashing turns of inference. He seemed always to be searching after general principles, cosmic laws, and to be always jumping at them, testing them, find- ing them not comprehensive enough, and letting them drift behind him as he pursued his search. She remarked on this after- wards to Lady Maria, who said that princi- ples were the last thing to interest Morosine. He had none at all, said Lady Maria, un- less his own immediate gratification was a principle; and perhaps with men you might almost say that it was. Chevenix remained, chuckling and inter- jecting here and there an exclamation, just  as he told her later  to  start the chap on his meander,  and presently betook him- self elsewhere. It was then to be observed that Morosine allowed himself to drift into the discussion of matters not usually sub- jects of ordinary conversation; but he did so without consciousness, and therefore without offence. Sanchia neither disap- proved nor felt uncomfortable. They were, moreover, interesting, and rather material. It began with Poland, a country which, the less it existed politically, he said, was the better to live in. and be of. We live by our emotions, the beasts by their appe- tites a material distinction. Now, the condition of the Poles was perfectly adapt- ed to the quickening of the emotional parts. Shorten time, you make love a precious ecstasy; restrict liberty, freedom is a lust  none the worse for Ijeing lawful. No Pole knows how long he may have to live: Russia or phthisis will have him late or soon. What he pursues, then, must be fleeting imagine with what rapture he takes it to his breast, with what frenzy he guards it, never knowing when it will be required of him again. Feverish    This was upon a remark from her.  Yes, and why not  Are not dreams more vivid than waking life  Can you gallop your material horse as your courser of the mind   Better to burn than to rust. That's the secret of life which all the laws of bureau- crats are directed to destroy. The estab- lishments want to see us as fixed as them- selves. They are tentacled, stationary creat- ures, feeding at ease. They would have us easy of access, falsely secure, so that they can fasten on us one by one and suck our juices. But the world is changing, thrones and churches are slackening in their hold. Men are discovering how short a time they have to live, and that eternity is more than questionable. A mild Epicureanism is gain- ing ground. Instincts founded on the pa- triarchal system must give way to that.  Have you ever considered,  he asked abruptly,   how that the flocks and herds of the Semitic patriarch are the sole cause of the moral code which westill profess  Thou shalt not steal. Why not  Because you injure the Patriarch. Not murder  You might attack one of his family. You have the habit in England of tracing prejudices to the Feudal System: believe me, there is hardly anything in Europe so modem. I should date at 4000 B. C. nearly all our present conventions, from the British Sun- day to the law of conspiracy. So long as you say that property is sacred, you uplift the Patriarch and lose sight of the man.  Sanchia, reminded of Senhousc a Sen- house with his tongue dipped in vinegar  objected that society may have demanded some of these laws in defiance of an en- grossing patriarch; but Morosine shook his head.   Society is the Patriarch s weap- on. Society is a Syndicate of Patriarchs who cannot live unless all men are en- slaved. Man is not by nature gregarious; he s solitary, like all the nobler beasts. Wolves and dogs hunt in herds; but not the great cats; oxen and buffaloes, but not elephants; rooks, but not eagles; bream, never salmon. And the time is not so very far when man will discover why it is that he is herded and marshalled hither and thither by police, legislatures, and monstrous as- semblies called armies or fleets. He has but to know it to abolish these things; they will fade like dreams in the morning. But hitherto everything has been banded to make his sleep secure his religion, his cupidity, his timidity, his affections. Re- ligion tells him it is wrong to love without the church, patriotism that it is glorious to bleed in making other men bleed, timidity that property keeps the wolf from the door, Rest Harrow 105 appetite that under cover of the law you may devour your neighbor and fear no in- digestion. Finally, there are the affections of a man which have been so guided that they see the aged more venerable than the young, the old thing more sacred than the new.  Woodman, spare that tree,  they ciy.  It dates from at least 2000 B. C.  Because old wine is good, they argue, old laws must needs be. As well might a man say, Because I relish old wine, I will love only old women. And so we go on    lie shrugged and broke off to talk shrewdly of books. They got to Leopardi, from him to Dante; he heard of her studies at the British Museum, and hoped he might meet her there. She read there often  Mostly in the afternoons  The light was bad; he usually devoted his mornings lo what work he had there. He was studying Per- sian, he said, but fitfully, as the mood took him. So far he had scarcely looked at her, but had talked out his monologue as if he had been alone, clasping one thin ankle, staring wide-eyed over the heads of guests, oc- casionally, when he was vehement, throw- ing his head up, shooting his words at the ceiling, as if they had been Greek fire. Now, as he got up to leave her, his eyes dwelt earnestly on her.   It will be a pleas- ure, to which I shall aspire that of meet- ing you again. There or elsewhere.  She thanked him as she gave him her hand. Excitement made her eyes bright, mantled her cheeks. She felt that she was communing with Senhouse at third hand.  Then it is understood we meet again,  he concluded. He bowed over her hand, on a second thought kissed her fingers, then left her immediately and went downstairs. He paid no farewell to Lady Maria, was ascertained to have left the house at once. VII Morosine had been called emancipated by Lady Maria, who presently found it proper to explain that he was by no means so free from chains as he appeared. San- chia, she thought, was seeing a good deal of him.  He s the victim, like the rest of us, of his constitution. His, as you may sec, is deplorable. Weak heart, they say but it may be lungs. I never heard of a Pole who could live in any climate, least of any his own. As for his mind, that fol- lows his wasted body: it s hectic. He affects a detachment which he will never have. It s a pose. He is exceedingly sen- timental, has an imagination which if you could follow it might alarm you. I have no doubt at all but that, in imagination, he has you safe in some island of Cythera or another, and has slain every other male inhabitant of it, lest some one of them should happen to look at your footprints in the sand. Jealous  He would sicken at the word not because he would be ashamed, but because it would conjure up the vision of some satyr-shape, and haunt him day and night. He has no need to study Persian poetry, I assure you. He has Rose-gardens enough and to spare; for, if you are inclined to be flattered at my sug- gestion of Cythera, I hasten to assure you that yours is not the only island of his dominion. Bless you, lie ll have an archi- pelago. But I have no fear for you; you can afford a sentimental education.  Sanchia did not tell her old friend how far that education was proceeding not be- cause she was afraid, still less because she was ashamed, but in obedience to her nature, which was extremely reserved. She spoke of herself and her affairs with diffi- culty never unless she was forced. But it had become a custom just now in the dull days on cither side of Christmas to look for Morosine in the reading-room about noon, to stroll the galleries for half an hour, to receive and to agree to a lightly offered proposition that they should lunch together, and  it might well be  to accept his escort afterwards. This, I say, had be- come the rule of three days in the week, more or less. And it s not to be supposed that so clear-sighted a young lady could see so much of so keen-sighted a man with- out a good deal of self-communing. Her capacity for silent meditation,during which she would sit before her fire, gazing far, smiling at her thoughts, into the glow- ing coals, had never left her. But there was a slight difference to be noted. She could not think of Ingram the past, the present, or any future Ingram without contraction of the brows. Smooth-browed she thought of Morosine. He interested her greatly; she was con- scious of anxiety to learn his opinion, of a wave of warm feeling when she awaited 10G Rest Harrow it. She credited him with insight, had a notion, for instance, that she could discuss her own affairs without any preliminary apology. He took so much for granted  surely he would take her youth into full account. She had never said him a word of herself as yet; but there had been times when she had felt near it had seen herself rowing a boat, as it were, within range of a weir, been conscious of effort to keep a straight course, and of the fruitlessness of effort. There had been moments when she had been tempted to throw down her oars with a sigh by no means of despair. Morosine seemed to her so extraordinarily reasonable, so ready, with well-known laws, to account for unheard-of vagaries, that it would have been real luxury to her to find herself and her escapade the mere creatures of some such law. To be discovered nor- mal: what a relief from strain  Lady Maria, it seems, charged him with oriental aptitudes. Sanchia gave that judg- ment careful attention, studied her friend in the light of it, weighed every word of his to her, watched him closely in company when he could not be aware of it. She decided against the opinion. His man- ners with women were his manners with men, those of urbane indillerence to sex. To sex  To much more than that. He was, in fact, outwardly polite to the point of formality; but his attitude of mind towards the person he happened to be with seemed to her when she examined it closely to be sublimely insulting. No created thing, with the passions and affec- tions common to his kind, ought to take up such a position with his fellow-creature  that which says,  I infer your existence from my sensations: apart from them, I cannot bring myself to believe in it.  She was aware that he must needs regard her from this stand-point; and the knowledge piqued her. If she did not exist for him, why did he seek her out  If she did, why did he pretend she did not   Or was Lady Maria right   Were his sensations awake, and had they fired his imagination, to carry her to Cythera, and keep her hidden there   These questions amused her, and she made no attempt to answer them. Amusement might cease that way: she indulged herself and left her questions open. One thing may be added. Morosine no more re- minded her of Senhouse. Quite otherwise  for of Senhouse just now she dared not think. Her friend Bill Chevenix gave her no warnings. Even when she sounded for them, he gave none.  I like Alexis,  he said once.  He s not so original as he makes out, but there s enough to give him a relish. A handy chap, too, in a dozen ways he ll model you in wax, or draw you in pastels, or sing about you on the guitar, or whistle you off on the piano; but he s not strong, isn t Alexis. The one thing he can do no, there are two he can ride anything, and he can use a revolver. I saw him empty the ten of hearts once; very pretty. I dare say, if he was put to it, he could use an iron to some purpose; but we don t stick each other here, so he d be out of practice. I rather wish we did,you know. It s far more gentlemanly than lay- ing for a chap outside his club with a hunting-crop, and getting summonsed for assault at Vine Street. Not a bit more vicious, barring the Ten Commandments.    Prince Morosine doesn t believe in them,  Sanchia said.  He s vowed to abolish them.  "So he may tell you, my dear. Don t you believe it. So long as they are good form they will be Alexis's form. He d sooner die than covet his neighbor s wife:  She reserved this for consideration. Mean- time she saw more of Morosine than of any other man, and got through January very well by his help. She particularly liked his company in gal- leries, because, though he never allowed himself raptures of which she, too, was in- capable he was always seeking the roots of rapture. Sanchia had a fund of enthu- siasm for art all the richer, perhaps, for be- ing denied expression. It was comfortable to have that securely based.   Did you ever consider,  he asked her once, when they stood before the great group of the pediment,   why it is that these things are so beautiful; why, although they are bare of color and all that stands for life to us in art, they are more than life  It s because they point to a state of being ex- quisitely conform to the laws of being. Such a perfect conformity soothes us into believing that while we witness it we arc of it ourselves conforming. These splendid creatures here, so superbly static idle, you Rest Harrow 107 might say  only they wouldn t understand you , indulging their strength arc strong and able precisely because they have sub- mitted themselves-    Unlike the Poles   She reminded him of their first conversation, and saw that he remembered it. He bowed to her.   Let me finish. These existences, ema- nations, essences, what you will, are sub- miss, not to man but to nature. They are as passive as earth herself, and as im- mune. They derive their strength from her. That s our only reasonable service.  Whether he intended it or not, the effect of this kind of talk was to make her view sub- mission to the world s voice as a reason- able service. It was not so odd as it may seem that her intimates had always been men. That reticence of hers which repelled her own sex was precisely that in her which attracted, by provoking, the other. After her dumb childhood, to which she never looked back, came her opening girlhood, and on the threshold of that stood Jack Senhouse, the loyal servitor, the one man who had loved her without an ounce of self-seeking. Then came Nevile Ingram and swallowed her up for a while, and when he had tired of her she was once more without a f riend. To Chev- enix, afterwards, rather than to Mrs. Dev- ercux, she had struggled to utter herself. That cry of distress,   he wants me to mangle me,  would never have been made by her to a woman. She would have died of it sooner. And now came the Pole, Mo- rosine, and by taking for granted  as even Lady Maria could not have done  much that could not have been explained, put her at her ease. She found him a Jack without the spirit without the divine spark. She could never have loved him, though she liked him well, and she had no idea that he thought of nothing but the greatness of his reward when, after patient toiling, she might fall into his arms. Every nerve in her body was now strung up to obedience to Jack s idea of her. She saw, as clearly as if it was printed, her fate before her. She was to put herself under the law. Jack should not have loved in vain her  dear obsequious head.  Nevile would come back, and require her. For Jack s sake, who had seen her too noble to be touched by sin, she would dip herself deep in sin. Morosine, who frankly desired her to be the wile of a man she did not love that she might the more easily find consolation in himself afterwards, had the wit to see that she needed some of his sophistry, though not enough to know exactly why. It was perfectly true. Her church-going was an ointment. It could soothe but not heal her. Sanchia had a mind. To do wrong by the world because it had seemed right to her, was not to l e remedied by doing a right by it now which to her reasoning would glare before her as a monstrous sin. She forgot that Senhouse had also taught her that the great sin of all was insincerity. She could not have afforded to remember that. All her present desire was to be, as nearly asshe might, what she had been when Jack had seen her first, what he had found excellent and loveworthy. Pious, bowing her head in a fair place, obsequious, obedient to the law. He had loved her, of course, what- ever she did outraging the law as well as keeping it, loving Nevile, letting himself go away. She could not remember that. He had loved her meek; she would be meek. That was what her heart told her; and Morosine, to serve his own ends, lulled her head with his sophistical anodynes and sent her brain to sleep. That he should know her story, as he ob- viously did, was not so disconcerting to her as it would have been to most young women. Taciturn as she was, it was not by reason of timidity, but rather that her own motives seemed too clear to her to be worth stating. She was rather given to assume her preroga- tive right to be different. Her first thought, therefore, was that she was saved the trouble of explaining herself, and her second that it was satisfactory to have a friend who understood her without. As for Morosine, he may or may not have felt that he had broken the ice; he pushed forward, at any rate, as if lie had dear water in front of him. Sanchia felt, when she next met him, that their acquaintance had entered on a new phase. Then, suddenly, before she knew where she was, her fate was upon her. It was in the park on a fine Sunday fore- noon in February. She was with Lady Maria, and had met with Melusine and Gerald Scales. Morosine, also, seeing her and meeting her eyes, instantly left his com- panion and came to greet her, hat in hand. He addressed himself to her exclusively, 10S Rest Harrow having saluted Lady Maria; but she named her sister, and he saluted her too. Gerald Scales, bronzed, plum  , and very full in the eye, having looked the new-comer over, de- cided against him and gave him a shoulder.   Foreign beggar,  was the conclusion he came to, which does credit to his perspi- cacity, lx cause the Pole had a very English appearance, and Scales himself the look of a Jew. When they turned to walk, Morosine took the side next Sanchia, and though he talked to both ladies, so contrived that she should read more in what he said than her sister. He did it deftly, but continuously. Sanchia was entertained, slightly excited, and ended by taking part in the game of skill. It is impossible to say by how much this sort of thing increased the intimacy al- ready established between the pair. It was by so much, at least, that when Melusine joined her husband by dropping behind and waiting for him to come up with the old lady, it came as no sort of shock to her that he took up the talk where he had ended it in the gallery.   You have been to church, I see. But you are not a Christian     He did not look at her. Nor did she tum her head to reply.   1 don't know. Nominally, at least fitfully, at the most.    That must be the outside of it,  he con- tinued.  The thing is the antithesis of the Hellenic ideal which is yours. Your seemingly passive martyr is really in an ecstasy. He aims at outraging nature; lo- gins by despising and ends by dreading it. Nature, however, has wavs of revenging herself.    Yes, indeed,  said Sanchia soberly. They walked on together, she by this time very much absorbed. She was not conscious of the shifting crowd, the lifting of hats, the chatter, the yapping dogs that ran in and out of women s skirts. Presently he spoke again.   You believe that you failed   Her voice came low.   1 know that I failed.  Then he looked at her, and spoke with vehemence.  And what is that to you  What is failure in such a cause to such as you    But she could not meet his face, kept hers rigidly to the front.  The cause,  Morosine told her,  is everything, the aim, the loyalty, the great surrender. Beside this failure is nothing at all. Do you say that the sapling fails that springs out of a cleft rock and towers  seeking, as we all seek, the sun, the light in heaven   A gale gathers it up and tears it out; over it goes, and lies shattered. Is that failure   How can it be, when nothing dies   Sanchia, very pale, turned her face to his at last. Her mouth was drawn down at the comers, to the tragic droop. She almost whispered the words.  Something did die.  His intuition worked like a woman s, in flashes. He knew immediately what she meant.   I know, I know,  he said.   You were mistaken. But you never faltered. You followed a call.    You tell me,  she said,   that there was none.   I do.    But,  she argued,   that with which I began failed me. 1 was entirely certain  at the time 1 could not possibly have hes- itated. And then it died.  Her eyes loomed large.   It is quite dead now; and I feel that I have betrayed myself broken faith with myself.  He shook his head.  You could not break faith. You are the soul of truth.  This praise she accepted.   I don t tell lies, I hope and I don t shirk things. But you see that I can stultify my own acts. I believed, and acted on my belief; and then I ceased to believe, and acted on that. I cannot trust myself I ought to be ashamed to say so, but I hope I am.  Morosine met her eyes again, and held them.   I can never believe that you would fail. I tell you that you have not failed. It is that you have been failed. You cannot give if what you give is not taken. Failed  you  Ah, no, you have succeeded, I think.  She bent her brows as she faced resolutely forward.   I must lake the consequences of what I have done. I see that.    Ah,  said Morosine.   that is a question of courage. Courage you have.    I need it,  she said in a hush, and stopped dead. Ingram stood before her, and took off his hat.   Well, Sanchia,  he said.   Here I am.   To be continued.  - V---     i Vrtj..

She held an illus- trious position at Court, but she had little power in the State. It Is true she was able to drive away the Duchess of Yalentinois, to strip her of her great wealth, and get back from her the crown jewels. But the young king loved his wife, Mary Queen of Scots, more than his mother. Mary despised her mother-in-law, and Mary's uncles, the Car- dinal of Lorraine and tiie Duke of Guise, governed France; to the great disgust of the Princes of the Blood and the ancient House of Montmorency, the first gentle- men of the realm, who thought the Guises upsta rts, whose father had come into France only fifty years before, a younger son, seek- ing his fortune. But when Francis II died of an abscess in the ear after seventeen months  reign, Catherine s turn came.

When murmurs over this violation of an ancient custom grew loud, she associated with her in the government Ilenrv of Bourbon, King of Xavarre. first Prince of the Blood royal, but framed such rules for the conduct of affairs as to make it impossible for him or the royal council to do anything without her knowledge and consent. To defend herself against the Cardinal of Lorraine and the Duke of Guise, whom she cordially de- tested, she surrounded the throne with their enemies, the houses of Bourbon and Mont  morency. The younger memliers of these houses and a large number of the gentry of France of the old stock were strongly in- clined to the heresy of their countryman, John Calvin, city preacher of Geneva, Monsieur le Hue lie Nemours From u fiie  oi  eiiif r ry julnt in the coliectluo of Mr. Juuiu  Mot n. some from conviction, some from scepti- cism because the new religion seemed less of a strain on faith than the old, and some because of the stalwart orthodoxy of the hated house of Guise. It came to pass, therefore, that heresy became fashionable at Court. The laws against it were relaxed and, throughout great parts of France, crowds blatantly chanted the Psalms in French on the public squares or marched sword on thigh to hear preaching in the fields. Ho  c stirred in Geneva, fear smote hearts at Rome, that France was to follow the example of England establish a na- tional church and renounce the Roman obedience. Philip II of Spain became anxious for the Netherlands. The Duke of 112 Savoy feared lest his rebellious subjects of Geneva should become his masters. The Pope trembled at the thought that the old- est daughter of the Church might be led astray by heresy. Nay, as the Cardinal of Lorraine put it:  If France should join Germany, the Baltic lands, Scotland, Eng- land, the infected Netherlands, the heretic cantons of Switzerland, how could Spain, Italy, or any of the Christian provinces es- ca  e being overwhelmed by the current of destruction   So a plot was formed to steal away the third son of Catherine, the heir-apparent to the throne, then about eleven years old, and carry him off, either to his aunt, the Duchess of Savoy, or to his sister, the Duchess of Lorraine.

Or perhaps those who planned his abduction ho  ed to make him head of the party for a civil war for the defence of universal religion, backed by the arms of Spain and Savoy and the blessing of the Po  e. Of course the agent of this daring at- tempt was not acting solely of his own accord. A politician of his experience would never have tried to do a thing so dangerous under conditions which would have made success useless. He was un- doubtedly backed or instigated by others, but who the others were, Catherine, in spite of all her efforts, could never discover. The House of Guise probably knew of it, but the reports proving their complicity dis- tributed in print over France by the op- l osite faction, which have l een accepted by historians as true, are false. No proof exists which enabled Catherine to accuse the Guises of knowing anything alvout the affair. If Spain or Savoy or Rome were cog- nizant of the attempted abduction, the secret is in documents that have perished or are buried Iteneath the dust of some archives. We only know the actions of the puppet. We cannot trace the wires that moved him. The man who was to get the boy across the French border was the Duke of Ne- mours. Jacques de Savoie, Duke of Ne- mours, was descended of the younger  3 L lit An Unfinished Crime branch of the House of Savoy, a race of soldiers. A captain at fifteen, he had fought through all the wars of Henry II, but he was no mere swordsman. Before the gout crippled him, France knew no more graceful and elegant gentle- man. He set the fashion at court, and his success with the ladies was proverbial. He boy to another part of the room, appar- ently because he observed that there was some one behind the tapestry near by, Ne- mours said:  I see many troubles in this kingdom and you are not safe in it, because the King of Navarre and the Prince of Conde want to make themselves kings and want to kill you.

He danced, rode, and fenced to perfection, and it was a saying among the courtiers of his older days that  he who had not seen Monsieur de Nemours in his gav years had not seen any- thing.   But, in spite of the brilliant agent, the plot failed completely. The little boy was very fond of the splendid captain and courtier, but he refused to go away with him. This is how it happened: Nemours took him apart, near a big chest in the king s room, and asked him what religion he was of and if he was a Huguenot  The little prince answered, that he was of the religion of his mother. Then, leading the take you to Lorraine or Savoy and you will be very happy.  The boy answered, that he did not want to leave the king nor his mother, the queen. Nemours said also:  Remember, mon- sieur, when Monsieur de Guise goes away, to say to him,  My cousin, when I need you I beg you to come, if you cannot take me away now.   Nemours also said to him that he must not tell the queen, and asked him if he trusted in Carnavalet and Villequier. And when he answered yes, said,   You must not say anything about this to them, and if they ask what 1 have been talking to you about, say it was the comedies.

When the attempt had thus failed, the duke left the Court at once and went to join the Guises at Nanteuil. A waiting-woman named Denise, who sang beautifully  that's all we know about her  had been behind the tapestry when Nemours began to talk to the little prince. It was, probably, this woman who told the queen. The lad was carried before the Royal Council, repeated the tale given above, and signed his testimony in very chive searching which enables me to read, as those who saw Catherine daily in her husband s Court could not, a wicked thought in that crafty heart, which was at once so cold and so passionate. Here is the English which represents the clumsy French of Nemours:   I recollect that you were pleased to trust me and use me in many things which I thought a great honor be- cause they were things of great consequence to you.

Be- fore this, Catherine ordered the arrest of Nemours. But a warning from his friends at Court reached him in the night. He mounted and rode from house to house of the Guises, finding food and guides and fresh horses ready for him, until he was safe across the border. From his hiding-place he wrote two letters to Catherine, denying his guilt, imploring her pardon, and re- minding her of his devotion to her interests, even in the days before her husband s death when she had few faithful servitors. It is in connection with one of these letters ihat the crime they had plotted years before was recorded. I.et me describe, as clearly as I can in brief, the curious and somewhat complicated bit of lucky adventure in ar- to do a thing which was agreeable, without reminding you of the danger and the enmity which might follow for me from such an action if it should become known, and chiefly, from him, or those whom it con- cerned.  A similar allusion, vaguely defi- nite, had struck my attention in the other letter from Nemours, which I had found in a different volume of manuscript. Its in- terpretation seemed impossible. But an accident had preserved, along with this second appeal to pitv through memory, the key to the mysterious allusion. The letter was in a volume, made some time after the middle of the eighteenth cen- tury, to contain a collection of documents about this attempt to carry off the young Duke of Orleans. The man who arranged 116 Exit the documents in the volume added to many of them a copy, probably because his em- ployer could not easily read the lx-autiful old hand of the royal secretary or the attempts of the Duke of Nemours to write the modern hand coming into vogue in his day. After reading the original letter, I was carelessly turning over the pages of the copy of it, when my eye was caught by the underscor- ing of some lines in the text. As no lines were underscored in the original, I looked more closely and read this note, written on the broad margin by the copyist:  In the original copy sent to Monsieur de Limoges  he was Ambassador to Spain  there is, at the end of the underscored lines, a reference to a foot-note at the bottom of the page, and here at the bottom of the letter.

SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE GROWTH OF THE GERMAN NAVY By Elmer Roberts ERMANY lias philosophers and lovers of mankind who, believing in the unity of the race, would that nations should arrange a permanent peace and accept in a spirit of fair-play decisions of umpires when gov- ernments do not interpret alike the princi- ples of international justice. The idea of war, bccausc the military organization of the country directly affects every home and family, is more distressing in Germany probably than in the United States or in Great Britain. England has not been in- vaded in force during eight and a half cen- turies. Merely the historic memory of Na- poleon s preparations for invasion causes a feeling of relief and thankfulness that they failed. Germany has had a different and a terrible national experience, which is ever in the background of consciousness when war and policies pertaining to war are dis- cussed. The child in school cannot avoid learning from the primer history that the population during the Thirty Years  War sank from 22,000,000 to 6,oeo.ooo. From times that were remote when Columbus discovered America, war has swept Ger- many during nearly every generation ex- cepting the periods following the military revival of Prussia, which contributed to the overthrow of Napoleon, and during the thirty-nine years of peace since the end of the French war and the unity of the Ger- man states. German cities have been sacked within a century. Grimmelshausen s classic  Simplicius Simplicissimus,  a romantic narrative of the Thirty Years  War, of the brutalities, insensate cruelties, plunderings, and ravish- ings of the period, has sunk into German sensibilities as deeply as did   Uncle Tom s Cabin  into the feelings of the North before the Civil War. The Germans of to- day bear a weight of armaments to escape the vivid terrors of the past and to feel that tine sense of security unknown to their an- cestors. The thought and the immense Vol. XLYIU. 13 labors bestowed upon preparedness for war are reactions from the sufferings of the past. Preparations for war, in the spirit in which the German looks upon them, grow in what seems a human and a reasonable manner from a body of political thinking derived from the national experience, and not essentially different in regard to the use of force from that of other great civilized peoples. Emperor William decided during the period following the Kruger telegram that Germany ought to have a navy of evident power if the country were to be secure from foreign resentment and threats out of pro- portion in the German view to the cause of offence. It is not necessary" to determine the political wisdom of the Kruger tele- gram or whether the reception of it in Eng- land was justified by its contents. It does seem essential, however, to understand in outline an event in which is to be found the seed of the great efforts Germany has put forth to create a navy and which she con- tinues to put forth. The German Foreign Office on the eve of the Jameson raid had received a petition by cable from German residents in Pretoria for a guard from a German war ship at Del- agoa Bay to be sent to Pretoria for their protection. President Kruger some time previously had asked German promises for aid against Great Britain should there be war and he had been refused, although un- questionably the German people took the Boer side of the controversy. The news that the Transvaal Government had en- gaged and defeated the Jameson raiders gave the Emperor occasion to send Presi- dent Kruger the subjoined despatch pub- lished in The Imperial Gazette of January 3- lS97     I express to you my sincere congratula- tions that, without appealing to the help of friendly powers, you and your people have succeeded in repelling with your own forces the armed bands which have broken into your country, and in maintaining the inde- 117 118 Sonic Reflections on the Growth of the German Navy pendencc of your country against foreign aggression.  The Times correspondent, in telegraph- ing the news, said:  This telegram must not, however, be taken as merely an expression of the Em- peror s personal feeling. It was drawn up at the Chancellor s palace where the Secre- tary of State for Foreign Affairs Baron von Marschall, the Secretary of the Imperial Navy Admiral Hollman, and others had been summoned by Prince Hohenlohe to confer with the Emperor. It assumes, therefore, the character of a State document of the highest importance, the more so as it contains an unqualified recognition of the independence of the South African Re- public.  The publication of the telegram moved the people of Great Britain far more deeply than did the Venezuelan message of Presi- dent Cleveland a few weeks earlier. The British Government began instant prepara- tions for war. The Times of January 8 published under triple head lines an un- usual device in those days nearly a col- umn announcement beginning as follows:  NAVAL PREPARATIONS A Flying Squadron Formed SHIPS ORDERED TO DELAGOA BAY "Orders have been sent to Portsmouth, Devonport, and Chatham for the immedi- ate commissioning of six ships to form a fly- ing squadron, and it is understood that the captains to command these ships have al- ready been chosen. The object of this move is obviously to have an additional squadron ready to go anywhere which may either re-inforce a fleet already in commis- sion, if thought desirable, or may constitute a separate force to be sent in any direction where danger may exist." The Times began a column editorial on the subject with  The country will learn with satisfaction that the augmented naval preparations which we advocated yester- day have been taken in hand with vigor and promptitude.  The editorial concluded with a reference to the  pretension of the German Emperor to tear up our treaties at his pleasure.  The Times on the following day announced that special preparations were in progress for mobilizing a portion of the Reserve Fleet, and that pressing orders had been issued to hurry the refitting of other ships. Emergency military prepara- tions also had been ordered by the govern- ment. Commenting on explanations and the avowals in Berlin that no unfriendly act had been meant by the Kruger telegram The Times said:  The official and semi-official press of Germany, which a week ago could not find language picturesque enough to reach the height of its great resolves, is now roaring as gently as any sucking dove.  The British Government s naval prepa- rations continued. A special flotilla of tor- pedo-boat destroyers for service with the Channel and flying squadrons had been placed in commission. Two thousand men were working extra time at Portsmouth, and the activity in the Chatham dockyards was described as  unprecedented.  The foregoing gives something of the British Government s dispositions to resent by arms the action of the German Govern- ment, or, if that were not designed, to im- press upon Germans their helplessness on the sea in the presence of British hostility. The attitude of the German Government within twenty-four hours after the Kruger telegram was to explain to England and the world that no offence had been meant. Such explanations were conveyed officially and elaborated upon in the German press. The British preparations were regarded with considerable astonishment, then with apprehension, and finally with a sense of abasement. The British Admiralty s activ- ity continued for some days after Mr. Bal- four had announced in the House of Com- mons on January 16 that no foreign power disputed the British view of the relations with the Transvaal. The conviction in Germany was that the British Government had taken an oppor- tunity to humiliate the German sovereign and the German people. The naval prepa- rations were regarded as in no other light than a threatening demonstration out of proportion to the significance of the tele- gram sent to Kruger. Had good-will been applied to the interpretation of the de- spatch it might have been taken as an ill- judged, though harmless, expression of sympathy. The German feeling was that, had Germany been a sea jjower and in a position to engage Great Britain even on unequal terms the British way of receiving Some Reflections on the Growth of the German Navy 119 the telegram would have l ecn different, and that, instead of flying squadrons and spe- cial flotillas of torpedo-boat destroyers for service with the Flying and the Channel squadrons, there would have been an ac- ceptance of German assurance that no ill-will had been intended. Germany had in that year something more than 1,500,- 000 tons of ocean-going shipping. Her in- vestments abroad amounted to S3,000,000,- 000. Her trade extended to most parts of the world, and her ambition for an expan- sion of her foreign commerce and her divi- dends from undertakings in foreign coun- tries was limitless. The government saw all this fabric of foreign enterprise exposed to destruction. Political writers in Ger- many had treated of Germany s need for a navy since the empire had been formed. The strategists in the general staff had pre- pared theoretical studies of the correlation of land and sea forces in war. In a war with Russia the great neighbor whose im- mense potentialities rested heavily upon the imagination of the Germans until the Rus- so-Japanese War the fleet could be em- ployed with advantage in closing the Rus- sian Baltic ports, in landing troops in great force either near St. Petersburg or at any intermediate point whereby operations threatening the rear of Russian armies on the German frontier could be executed. The Emperor had read and had been impressed by Captain Mahan s  The In- fluence of Sea Power on History.  A naval officer of distinction has told me that Cap- tain Mahan's book had as much to do with the building of the German navy as any other single influence. Certainly it was evident that the power of Germany could not be used beyond where German troops could march unless a navy of considerable strength existed. The exposed   osition of German commerce, the problem studies of the co-o  eration of the land and sea forces in war, the Emperor s personal con- victions on the subject of a navy were the latent forces released into full activity by the consequences in England of the Kruger telegram. The United States, Italy, and France had begun from five to fifteen years earlier to expand their navies. The first German naval programme was ready by November 10 of the following year, 1897, and was adopted by the Reich- stag the next spring. The strategists, how- ever, were convinced that a small navy was scarcely better than no navy, that any navy must be sufficiently large to be taken into account by Great Britain or a,ny other power as a serious adversary, were war to take place. While these discussions were going on the German mail steamer Bundesrat i was seized by a British cruiser off the East Afri- can coast on suspicion of carrying contra- band. The seizure caused high feeling in Germany and was the occasion of a good deal of arrogant talk in England, where German sympathy for the Boers was re- sented. The Bumksralh was presently re- leased. The incident and the feeling it pro- voked on both sides of the North Sea gave the second push to the German navy. The programme of 1900 the present one was resolved upon. The key idea as set forth in the preamble is that  Germany must possess a battle fleet so strong that a war with her would, even for the greatest naval power, be accompanied with such dangers as would render that power's position aoubtful." While the German naval promoters have never planned for a navy equal to that of Great Britain, they do work for a navy that would make the British Government hesi- tate to attack Germany under avoidable circumstances and that would suggest a civil attitude should the two governments have different policies upon a subject of mutual interest. German naval plans leave to Britain superiority on the sea, but not such a superiority as leaves German shipping, the sprinkling of German colo- nies, and immense German investments in other countries defenceless. Instead of a proportion of seven to one, which repre- sented the ratio of naval strength on the morning the Kruger telegram was sent, the pro  ortion when the German projects arc completed is likely to be about three to two in favor of Great Britain. Although the British position on the sea is immensely changed thereby, the security of the British Islands can hardly be endangered. Should Great Britain consider that the national security requires more ships she will proba- bly build them. She cannot retain an over- whelming superiority upon the sea without building ships. The weakness of the sug- gestions for limitation by agreement made in England is, that they always imply that 120 Some Reflections on the Growth of the German Navy Great Britain would be willing to enter into an arrangement with Germany on the per- manent principle of British naval policy that Great Britain shall have a navy as large as any two other powers, with a mar- gin of ten per cent, more for good measure. Englishmen ask that Germany should un- dertake to confirm by treaty Britain s supreme position on the sea. The im- possibility of a nationally young, growing, ardent, self-confident people such as the Germans entering into an agreement of that kind makes the suggestion seem queer when looked at from the Continent. No British statesman has ever mentioned a willing- ness to consider a limitation of armaments except upon the fundamental idea that Britain retain her vast preponderance on the sea. The discussion of limitation upon that basis does not seem a futility in Eng- land; in Germany it is regarded as verging upon impudencc. The elder Pitt in the middle of the eigh- teenth century laid down the principle that the safety and prestige of Great Britain lay in a balance of power on the Continents that England could not suffer any power to become predominant on the mainland. Therefore France, the great military power on the Continent, was the enemy of Eng- land. Pitt made headway against France by alliances on the Continent, crippled her through the aid of Frederick of Prussia on the land, defeated her at sea, and added the French colonies in India and North America to her own. France was again the enemy of England when Napoleon rose to military' supremacy on the Continent. For a century and a half the first aim of British foreign policy has been to promote an equilibrium on the Continent so that con- tentions there should leave her free in other parts of the world and should keep all pow- ers in Europe seeking for the favor of Eng- land. Since the reduction of the Russian position in the Japanese war. Germany has become the predominant military State on the Continent. The aim of the British Government has been to arrange a system of ententes and alliances sufficient to hold Germany in check. Doubtful success has resulted. The endeavor to give Morocco to France failed. The joint British and Rus- sian efforts against Germany and Austria in the Bosnian-Herzegovinian annexations failed. Great Britain is being gradually excluded from influence on the Continent. If Germany had never built a ship nor sold a yard of cloth abroad, the political genius of British statesmen would have singled her out as the enemy of England because of her immense and growing position on the Continent. The political policies of Great Britain are the ones that drive her into hos- tility against Germany. Added to these are the trade competition, usually much ex- aggerated, and the rise of the German navy. Relatively British trade has not expanded so fast as that of Germany, but it is good and profitable, making the financial posi- tion of the United Kingdom still the first in Europe. The German navy is serious for Great Britain, not because the safety of the British Isles is endangered nor because Germany has any aggressive policy against her, but because the British political position throughout the world will Ije reduced by reason of the existence of the navy. That position has already been greatly changed by the rise of Japan in the Far East, of the United States in the Western hemisphere, of Germany on the continent of Europe. The British fleets in the East, on both shores of North and South America and in the Mediterranean have been lessened to strengthen the fleets in home waters. The British naval forces will become further concentrated in ratio to the German con- struction. The prevailing strategical doc- trine will require Great Britain to have at home a naval power sufficient to engage on more than equal terms a fleet of thirty-eight battle-ships and twenty large cruisers with- in one day s sail of her coasts. The  relations  between Great Britain and Germany are in continuous discussion that rises to a certain intensity when the British naval budget is debated in Parlia- ment or when some European question bubbles. These  relations  arc likely to sharpen in international importance until the German navy reaches its programme developments, which will be l etween 1916- 18. 1 venture into the difficult field of con- jecture as to the probable course of events. Ethical considerations will prevent the small war party in Great Britain from pro- voking war while the German navy is weak. When the German navy has reached its programme maximum and nothing hap- pens, because Germany will not throw her The Point of View 121 inferior navy against Britain, a long pcare will probably follow in which suspicions and animosities will diminish. The British people will become accustomed to a cer- tain diminution of their international posi- tion, but with an immense place in the world, a place constantly maintained, per- haps constantly increased, through their spiritual and intellectual contributions to mankind.  THE POINT OF VIEW- ONCE upon a time just before the year 1000 A.D. people were terribly fright- ened because they were sure that the world was coming to an end. Often they have awaited in consternation the arrival of Anti- christ, who was to bring about the spiritual de- struction of Christendom.

I remem- ber reading somewhere, I think in the Outlook, that, at the time of our war with Spain, many of the mountaineers of Tennessee were in a state of great alarm because of the Spanish fleet, afraid lest some of "them flyin  squadroons  should light upon the mountains. Now that we are facing the tremendous scare lest woman shall comc to an end in 1915 or thereabouts, it be- hooves us to see if there is any ground for re- assurance; fear doubtless has its uses, but history would seem to suggest that it is some- times unfounded. As regards women, there are plenty of signs and portents of dreadful change; and it is hardly necessary to enumerate the various things that they are doing which they used not to do. From college corridor and from lecture platform come echoes of their plans and aspirations; from pulpit, editorial office, club, come deep masculine thunderings in bass pro- test would another spelling for bass carry any truth in its suggestion  Thin and high l e- tween the loudly stated programme of woman- kind, and the growling denunciation of man- kind,come the wails of the  womanly women, ' who point the finger of scorn at their sex, and assert, in print or upon the platform, that they would not think of doing thing  that would at- tract attention in any way.

For my part, I should not want to build up a history of contemporary civilization on newspaper jokes and gibes, and a few days' observations made by a tired traveller. As regards the symj athy of these spectators with the much-abused American man, hus- band of the American woman, who disjxirts herself abroad while he is toiling in his office, 1 can say only that the American man, who has an immense sense of humor, is smiling up his sleeve. He knows that endless work, however hard it may be, is not so hard as endless play, and he takes his ease in his office, with old friends and a pipe, while wife and daughter put in twenty-hour days in travelling, toiling up mountains and down gorges in the delusion that it all means rest and recreation. What- ever the American woman may be, she is what the American man has made her, whether or no she belong to this small leisure class which our visitors mistake for the whole. It is in his hands to change her if he will; those who pity him do not realize what a singularly capable individual he is. Meanwhile, if the butterfly lady fails to see her husband's dry smile, de- noting that he has the best of it, why should the foreigner protest  . Vs regards the indictment of the American mother, I say to these critics, English, French, German, wait until you know her before you pronounce against her. She is not obviously sentimental; she does not publicly gloat over her children; but feeling is perhaps none the less deep for not being worn upon the sleeve. The patience, courage, self-denial that I have seen among American mothers of all classes are entirely worthy of those Puritan great-grand- mothers who wore their lives out at the spin- ning-wheel that their sons might grace the pul- pit or professor's chair. If there are nv .there who, in faith and devotion, can surpass thou- sands of American women, none the less great of soul because they are unnoticed by the cas- ual tourist, 1 would I knew where to find them. AS for those women who are invading the professions, entering business, taking care of themselves in a hundred ener- getic ways, many of them have been drawn into this kind of life by the tragedy of death, or by desertion of son or husband, or, perhaps by mere failure to meet the special person who could make home, home; and one ought to give thanks for the high-hearted way in which they accept their destiny rather than grumble at them. If, tragedy aside, a woman undertakes some large task because she has a gift for it, who is wise enough in the purposes of the Creator to say her nay   There is an apjxall- ingly large number of unmarried women in Massachusetts, says the alarmist; yes, but there are eighty thousand more women than men in Massachusetts. What wu would you have  To the courage, cheerfulness, pluck of the women with careers whom I have known, I pay deep homage. 1  rom many of them the instinct of mother- hood, through no fault of their own failing to find its natural channels, flows out in lovely ways, in mothering the needy young. Child- less, they win the undying love and gratitude of children actually or spiritually motherless, The Point of View 123 and spend their lives in maternal serv ice which makes you realize lhal experience docs not always depend on mere fact. If one only knew how to soothe the fright- ened gentlemen who are voicing their fear so loudly  We must be calm always in the face of signs and portents. It has been discovered, you will remember, that even comets have their orbits, obeying laws too far-reaching and subtle for the ordinary observer, medix-val or other, to make out. It may be that even the mctcoric ladies trailing across the lecture platform have their regular orbits, subject to mysterious laws, undiscoverable by either your intellect or mine. Freaks we have always among us I have not observed that the other sex is free from them  and vet the race goes rather sanely on. So I listen to the growling of mankind; the piping of the   womanly women   for the life of me, when I hear them expatiating in public on their womanliness, 1 cannot help remem- bering Becky Sharp, and little Kawdon s un- finished shirt; I listen, loving this best of all, to the plans of the intellectual young, what they arc going to do, the ways in which they will give their lives to ideal aims, and I gently chuckle. I live in a fine, secluded comer for chuckling. What are these fears, scorns, ad- mirations  They speak, one and all, as if motherhood were of yesterday the profound- est, as the earliest, fact of human life, the deep- est thing in it. Can a passing fashion, can an abstract cause, rob life of that which goes farthest down and farthest back  I am shocked that wise men should have so little faith, so little real insight. There is a dis- heartening shallowness about their whole contention. They talk as if the maternal instinct were an outside something, like a fashion in hats, and as if it were now making manifestations which they do not like and would correct by  reason.  When did "reason  ever have anything to do with it  CouM you reason with the law of gravitation because you thought it was not living up to its privileges and obligations  Women will folhw the law of their natures, not because masculine or  womanly  arguments convince thim, but bccausc it was there before they were; they can no more help it than they can s.'op their hearts from beating; they have no more choicc in the matter than they have in regard to having hands and feet, nor as much. Our ambitious youngsters, who hope to  do so much for the world  in the way of abstract causes, bow like grass before the winds of God, when the winds of God begin to blow. And if, as sometimes happens, for them they do not blow, these workers, for the most part, carry out their tasks sweetly and courageously, find- ing their places, and necessary places, in this great commonwealth of humanity. Quite as amenable to the underlying laws of life arc the older and sterner members of womankind who chatter on platforms about women s rights. When this kind fall, they fall like Luci- fer. I have even observed, though I realize that it will take several aeons before men find this out, that the strongest-minded women are usually the ones capable of the strongest af- fections; the most apparently unsexed often, in the deepest sense, the most womanly. Now can we blaine men for not discovering this, when often, through some oversight of blun- dering Dame Nature who seems to make as many mistakes as do other feminine creatures  the women do not suspect it themselves   The instinct for motherhood is the primal, indestructible fact of woman s life, and profes- sional work, university life, even even the ballot are not going to change it, any more than the present style in sleeves is going to change it. I have known many learned and semi-learned women; I have known but one in whom this instinct was not stronger than any other, and she was lavishing a maternal passion on a dictionary of her own creating. Fate, not perversity on her part, made her the mother of that tome, instead of granting her a son. Incidentally, it is a comfort to know that the dictionary turned out well. As well be afraid that water will run up hill, that the Hudson will turn and travel back to the Adirondacks, as that the heart of woman, be she short-haired or long-haired, booted and spurred or clad in chiffon, shall be made any way except as it is made, and has been, from all time  Men might as well sit up nights in fear lest the moons of Jupiter should begin to move round the other way, or that the leopard should, after all, change his spots, as to worry lest woman shall change her nature; and arguments addressed to the moons of Ju- piter, or to the leopard, advising them to keep on in their old course, would be quite as much to the point as all this present-day rea- soning with womankind. The swallow to her nest, the river to the sea, and the heart of the woman to her child, existent or non-existent. You cannot keep the needle from pointing to the pole, and no amount of good advice will make it point there more irrevocably. 124 The Point of View CANNOT one comment on current events which have become controversial without  invidia,  or the suspicion of partisanship  At least, one ought not to be walking over live emliers, as Horace has it, if he ventures to remark that, whether it be true or not that the principle of democracy in edu- Democracv cation was involved in a recent con- and troversy, it is a valuable anil even Education indispensable principle. The  poor scholar,  still extant in Germany and Scotlanil, is understood to l e extinct in England. The head of a  swell  Oxford college was quot- ed, at the time when the provisions of Cecil Rhodes's will were published, as saying that though its beneficiaries might possibly subsist at Oxford in term-time upon the allowance that was secured to them, he did not see how it was possible for them to get on during vaca- tion, excepting with  private means.  It may be added that the college over which the author of this sentiment presides, doubtless with dig- nity and amiability, is not distinguished in the academic annals of either scholarship or ath- letics. If  efficiency  were the object of education, as it so clearly is in Germany, and as it so clearly ought to be here, it would be recognized at the outset that frugality was conducive to it and luxury hostile. In England, Froude said that university education fitted a man extremely well for the grade of gentleman, but for 110 other that he knew of. And in that Oxonian classic,  Tom Brown.  we tind one of the hero s heroes telling him:  Three years at Oxford, my boy, will teach you something of what rank and money count for, if they teach you nothing else.  That lesson is one which, of all lessons, should in America lie postponed to a post- graduate course, and not inserted, either as compulsory or as elective, in the undergraduate curriculum. Things are by no means as badly off with us yet in this respect as they are with the English. There is no American in- stitution of learning as yet in which a Rhodes scholarship would not enable its holder to get  lie full benefit of the institution, socially as well as scholastically and athletically. If any American undergraduate should complain to his parent that he  could not live  on that allowance, the parent, if he had any sense at all, would promptly withdraw him from that seat of learning. The sense of humor has, among other definitions, been defined as a sense of proportion. And the sense of humor on which we pride ourselves ought to suffice to prevent the spending by any youth, engaged in preparation for the battle of life, of more than three or four times the yearly amount that he could reasonably expect to earn in the open market after his preparation was completed and he had entered the battle. And, most cer- tainly, it is not good that different  standards of Jiving  depending on different amounts of  private means,  should be encouraged or even tolerated by the faculty of an American university. A place of education is the last place in which there is room for a set of social distinctions based on money. Doubtless it is difficult to obliterate such distinctions altogether. But it is at least feasible to make sure that the college itself shall not establish them or connivc at them. The college may well bear in mind Jean Paul's saying,  I would not, for much money, have had much money in my youth,  and gov- ern itself and its charges accordingly. There is one perfectly democratic place of educa- tion in the United States. Nay, there are two, the Military Academy and the Naval Academy, and their withstanding of pluto- cratic standards by democratic standards is one of the great national services that these two schools render.  Our hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind.  There are very jus- tifiably printed, as an illustration to one of the annual reports upon West Point, two photo- graphs, one showing the luxury of a study in one of the  swell  dormitories of Yale, and one the monastic severity of the single room which serves as the sole abode of two cadets. A fond and solvent mother has been known to address to the superintendent of the Military Academy an almost tearful remonstrance upon his cruelty in refusing to allow her offspring to receive a check for the purchase of Christmas presents. An officer of the Academy, being asked whether there was any possible manner in which a cadet who was the son of a million- aire could have an advantage over one who was the son of a lal orer, made answer:  Oh, yes. Tic could order his white trousers cut by a fashionable tailor, in which case he would be reported for being out of uniform.  These things indicate an ideal toward which it were well that all the colleges should strive. They would fail to attain it altogether. It is only under the iron discipline of a nursery of warriors that it is attainable, and attained. But it is none the less desirable that it should be cherished as an ideal, and sought to be realized, in the schools of civic training.  THE FIELD OF ART' XtK HAftTl.ETTS TEDl.UBXT   OK TUB HOUSE OP KEMESEXTATirES. IVASHIXGTQX. I . C OF that very comprehensive rearrange- ment and re-decoration of the Capi- tol at Washington which has been in contemplation for some years the first decisive step has been taken by the completion by Paul W. Bartlett, sculptor, of his design model for the groups in the pediment of the House of Representatives wing. Through some com- bination of circumstances this tympanum has remained untenanted since the completion of the wing in Deceml er, 1S57, while those over the state entrances of the central corps dr logis and of the Senate have lx.-en occupied, after a fashion, for many years the latter, sincc 1860-64 when Crawford s figures were exe- cutcd and mounted, one by one, according to contemporary record. The sculpture in the pediment of the central portico, under the dome, consists of three figures in relief, ap- plied in the centre of the tympanum and some- what lonely in their isolation. These, put in place under the administration of President John Quincy Adams, are described in a letter from Bulfinch, one of the three architects of the Capitol, as representing America, Justice, and Hope,  bold, nine feet in height, and gracefully drawn by Mr. Luigi Persteo, an Italian artist.  Crawford s pediment, on the contrary, is filled from end to end with figures executed by Italian workmen from his designs, and variously representative of the develop- ment of the nation. Congress has delegated all these architect- ural and otherwise artistic matters to the Joint Committee of the Senate and the House on the Congressional Library, the chairman of the Senate Committee being Senator George Pea- body Wetmore, and that of the House Com- mittee, Mr. Samuel  Y'. McCall, the first from Rhode Island and the second from Massachu- setts. In the latter part of the Roosevelt ad- ministration the Joint Committee resolved to provide the House pediment with worthy dec- oration and, with commendable intelligence, addressed a communication to the National Vol. XLVIII  14 Sculpture Society requesting a list of ten sculptors best qualified in the opinion of their confreres for this ini  ortant commission. At the head of this list, when received, some two years ago, appeared Mr. Bartlett s name, and, as he had also been favorably considered pre- viously by the honorable committeemen them- selves, he was summoned to the capital, di- rected to undertake the work, and the contract was signed, in February, 1009, on the delivery and acceptance of his first model. In the first conception of this monumental sculpture he took into serious consideration a number of fundamental principles, and he was fortunate in finding that his own taste and ideals were in accord with those conservative traditions of the art which have been generally accepted and also, incidentally, with the preju- dices of the distinguished law-givers, his em- ployers. As this was to lie a national work, there was no room for novel and ex  erimental and extravagant methods; as representative of this country, free and prosperous and blessed with much sunshine, anv tendency toward that dark influence in modern art which contem- plates exclusively the melancholy anil the sor- did would be most inappropriate; as addressed to the people, it was advisable to present some- thing familiar, native, comprchendible, and not a more imaginative and decorative sym- bolism inspired by alien themes. In other words, the United States equivalent, in this century, of the I anathenaic procession in the fifth, B.C.  And, in this instance, the sculptor declines to consider his commission as any less inspiring than his Grecian predecessor s.  His theory of  a suitable decoration for a legisla- tive building  docs not differ widely from that of President Adams as set forth in Bulfinch s letter:  He disclaimed the wish to exhibit tri- umphal cars and the emblems of victory, and all allusions to heathen mythology, and thought that the duties of the nation or its legislators should be expressed in an obvious and intelli- gent manner." Carried out on these general lines, the model submitted to the Committee was promptly ap- proved. The familiar technical problems pre-   5 The Field of Art New Pciliinc.it fur the Hvtis  :f sented l v tin s pedimental sculpture were also considered the necessary harmony in style with the building, which he endeavored to pre- sent in his central figure of IVace; the arrange- ment of the figures along a level floor so as not to disturb the horizontal line of the lower cor- nice; the necessity    f accounting for t he gradu- of therefore being under the necessity of talcing care that their feet are not too entirely cut off by their pedestal in this case Ihe lower cor- nice of the pediment, on which they stand. This apparent throwing up of the pedestal affects particularly the reclining or crouching figures in the compressed corners of the great ally diminishing height of the figures, each way from the centre, by differences in position rather than in size; the avoidance of any ap- pearance of bring forced to this gradual dimi- nution by the architect this requiring a very- well-thought-out central idea ordering the whole comjKisition; the very troublesome ne- cessity of accommodating this central idea to a composition which must preserve the per  en- dicular architectural central line anti therefore present two distinct halves to lie fused into one harmonious whole. So concerned was Mr. Bartlett with the desirability of appearing to lie quite uninfluenced by the arbitrary require- ments of the architect that after he had modelled his grou   he removed their confining slanting roof, and was pleased to see that they appeared to be quite naturally disjxised at their respective occupations. In common with all architectural sculpture these groups labor under the disadvantage of being seen from Ixlow, and at a distance, and triangle, so that the Greeks found it necessary to arrange their dying warriors or reclining spectators- who naturally sought refuge in these corners  in such a manner that they should still be in evidence from below, and not flat on their backs and nearly invisible. In the final arrangement of this Washington pedi- ment the extreme tips of the sculpture at these corners were cut off and abolished, thus per- mitting the architectural structure of the raking cornice above to be more clearly de- monstrated. The figures will probably be cut in Georgia marble which, with larger crystals, is some- what more mellow in tone than the white Italian statuary marble. The total extreme length of this pediment is eighty feet, and of the space for the sculptured groups about sixty; the height in the ccntre, eleven feet, and of the central figure of Peace, nine feet and some inches. The depth of the recess of the tympanum is about three feet, so that the The Field of Art 127 foremost figures can l c presented free anrl in the round. It is of course advisable that these large personages should not project too far over their cornice and threaten to fall 011 the visitors below. The horizontal cornice at the bottom is a little over sixty feet from the ground and about forty-two that distance from head-dress serves to still further idealize her; on her left arm she carries a circular buckler for defence, her right hand, extended, holds out a branch of her olive. It is possible, in the finished work, that this olive branch may be gilded. On her right arc the Manufactures and Navigation; on her left, Hunting and Ag- K  :tcK.nta: v   by P ul W. Harriett. the top of the flight of steps which leads up to the entrance. The sculptor was obliged to take into consideration the fact that, more than is usual, his work would l e viewed from the sides, 3s well as from directly in front, and more frequently from the right, by spectators ascending the great central flight of steps of the Capitol. To meet this, he arranged his composition in such order that the planes of his figures would be sculptural and construc- tive from all three points of view. The present judicious spacing of the composition, so that the eye of the spectator is pleased at first glance with the evident freedom of action of the figures, their elbow-room, the lack of crowd- ing and confusion, was secured only by much planning and shifting about. In the centre of the tympanum rises the stately figure of Peace, presented 011 a some- what larger scale than the others, more as a goddess, or a symbol, than as a living and merely human j ersonification. Her winged riculture. In thus limiting the field of his human activities the sculptor had in mind the more purely democratic character of the rep- resentative assembly that sits below, their more direct relations with the people. It may be seen in our reproductions that an acccptable variety is secured by giving the scenes sug- gested on the left a more pastoral and gracious air, something of the summer and the open air. To the left and partly Itehind the goddess is seen her altar, the curling smoke from which rises and mingles with her garments; beyond this, as a forerunner of the development of the country, the aboriginal hunter, the red man carrying a slain deer. Then follows the mower with his scythe, the symbol of comple- tion. of gathering in, the harvest, and finally the labor of the fields, the husbandwoman, the rattle and sheep, and even the faithful dog. On the right of Peace ap  ears one of the most important of ail the manufactures which she protects, that of books; and next, the pen- dant to the scytheman on the other side, the metal-worker, leaning on his long hammer. Behind him, another  xiurs with due care the melted metal in the mould; another rolls for- ward his ear wheel; two youtlis are alx ut to step the mast in their lx at. The symbols are of the oldest, and within the comprehension of all; the art consists in rendering these familiar things with that touch of individual genius which saves. Mr. Bartlett modelled the gigantic figures on the pediment of the Stock Exchange of this city, from the designs of the elder sculptor, Mr. J. Q. A. Ward --in the very different concep- tion and carrying out of this Washington sculpture may lie seen somethingof the many- sidedness of good art. And it presents also, in a rather striking manner, one of the disadvantages attend- ing this art of monu- mental sculpture the regrettable disappear- ance when in st it of so much of the sculptor's l est work. Commonplace material consider- ations, such as the mere distance at which a work is viewed, will interfere very seriously with the due perception and appreciation of many of the most valued artistic qualities, with the intimate apj eal which the artist wishes to make to his audience. Intimacy, subtlety, charm, cannot be transmitted between mortals over a certain limited numlx-r of feet, long measure. In innumerable instances the high qualities of works of architectural sculpture are visible, and therefore available, for the birds of the air only, or for the bodyless ghosts. As has been said, the modern tourist in the British Museum has. in some res  eets, Ix-tter opportunities for the studyof the Parthenon reliefs than the citizens of Pcricles s time. But the conscientious artist puts, nevertheless, his finest instincts into these lofty and remote figures, touches, quali- ties, that will be known to his fellow-men only when earthquake, or the vandal destroyer, brings his statue to the ground. It may truly lie said of this sculptor that, good as arc his fig- ures when seen in place, they present when viewed at a reasonable distance so many evi- dences of that talent which, with the most com- monplace of themes  Philosophy,   Hope,  "Commerce,  anything can produce that sud- den surprise and charm which tills us when we see a new revelation of humanity, of beauty, or character in that which we had' thought hope- lessly familiar.

HOUSE BUILDING HOUSE FURNISHINGS The things that count in Vacuum Cleaning are Volume of Air and Evenness of Suction. This Oddly Shaped Fan Making thousands of revo- lutions per minute, creates an absolutely even, strong suction of more volume and velocity at the cleaning tool than any other device practical for a port- able vacuum cleaner. Scientifically designed fans have wonderful power; for instance, our fans ventilate mines, firtmt Att'nd Ftr raise wheat from ships, drive chopped corn stalks into silos, convey kindling wood, and exhaust dust and refuse from carpet cleaning plants and other dusty factories. Sturtevant engineers have experimented two years to design the most efficient combin- ation of fan, motor and dust collector for house- hold vacuum cleaning, and this set is the result  it draws through an inch hose nearly 1UU,000 cubic inches of air per minute a force that with- draws dust and dirt with a thoroughness that gives a unique sanitary value. VACUUM CLEANER FvpnnMt   v u  advantage of fan-made suction LVCUUCSo . over tliat of a pump cleaner is the con- tinuous instead of an intermittent flow of air. This avoids jerking the threads of tine fabrics or leaving streaks when the cleaning tool is moving rapidly. Durability   rcv lv'nK fa" ',as 'vcar :i,u  aUHIljr . tcar alKj cannot leak, while a pump U wrenched and ground by every plunge and must soon lose efficiency on account of leakage. Sturtevant fans, installed over thirty years, in the hardest kind of serv- ice and still doing good work, testify to their durability. Reliability: Efficiency: Our fans, driven l v our elcctlic motors, make possible the high speed of I .S. battleships, and they must be as trustworthy as engine or propeller. Our forced draft fans in battle- ships arc no more carefully made than those in our vacuum cleaners. This fan looks very simple, but every inch of it in curvature, in weight of metal, in breadth and taper ol blade is the result of ex- haustive tests. Kan suction is ideal for vacuum cleaning, and this is the first perfect application of that principle.
