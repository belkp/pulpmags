Washington  I A NEGRO SERMON SIMON LEGREE  To be read in your own variety of negro dialect  LEGREE S big house was white and green His cotton fields were the best to be seen He kept strong horses and fine swine He had cool jugs of cider and wine His garret was full of curious things  Books of magic bags of gold  And rabbits feet on long twine strings  But he went down to the Devil  Legree he sported a brass buttoned coat A snake skin necktie a blood red shirt   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Legree he had a beard like a goat And a thick hairy neck and eyes like dirt His puffed out cheeks were fish belly white He had great long teeth and an appetite He ate raw meat most every meal And rolled his eyes till the cat would squeal His fist was an enormous size To mash poor niggers that told him lies He was surely a witch man in disguise  But he went down to the Devil  He wore hip boots and would wade all day  To capture his slaves who had fled away  But he went down to the Devil  He beat kind Uncle Tom to death Who prayed for Legree with his parting breath Then Uncle Tom to Eva flew To the high sanctoriums bright and new And Simon Legree stared up beneath And cracked his heels and ground his teeth  And went down to the Devil  He crossed the yard in the storm and gloom He went into his grand front room He said I killed him and I don t care He kicked a hound he gave a swear He tightened his belt he took a lamp   A Negro Sermon Simon Legree  Went down cellar to the webs and damp There in the middle of the mouldy floor He heaved up a slab he found a door  And went down to the Devil  His lamp blew out but his eyes burned bright Simon Legree stepped down all night Down down to the devil Simon Legree he reached the place He saw one half of the human race He saw the Devil on a wide green throne Gnawing the meat from a big ham bone And he said to Mister Devil  I see that you have much to eat A raw ham bone is surely sweet I see that you have lion s feet I see your frame is fat and fine I see you drink your poison wine Blood and burning turpentine  And the Devil said to Simon Legree I like your style so wicked and free Come sit and share my throne with me And let us bark and revel And there they sit and gnash their teeth And each one wears a hop vine wreath They are matching pennies and shooting craps   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  They are playing poker and taking naps And old Legree is fat and fine He eats the fire he drinks the wine Blood and burning turpentine  Down down with the Devil Down down with the Devil Down down with the Devil  II JOHN BROWN  To be sung by a leader and chorus the leader singing the body of the poem while the chorus interrupts with the question  I ve been to Palestine  What did you see in Palestine  I saw the Ark of Noah  It was made of pitch and pine  I saw old Father Noah  Asleep beneath his vine  I saw Shem Ham and Japhet  Standing in a line  I saw the tower of Babel  In a gorgeous sunrise shine  By a weeping willow tree  Beside the Dead Sea   I vc been to Palestine  What did you see in Palestine  I saw abominations And Gadarene swine I saw the sinful Canaanites Upon the shewbread dine And spoil the temple vessels And

Behemoth He cheered for Old John Brown I saw the big Leviathan He cheered for Old John Brown I saw the Angel Gabriel Great power to him assign I saw him fight the Canaanites And set God s Israel free I saw him when the war was done   John Brown  In his rustic chair recline By his camp fire by the sea By the waves of Galilee  I ve been to Palestine  What did you see in Palestine  Old John Brown Old John Brown And there he sits To judge the world His hunting dogs At his feet are curled His eyes half closed But John Brown sees The ends of the earth The Day of Doom AND HIS SHOT GUN LIES ACROSS HIS

POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IN SUMMER  DEVICE  I  For a proud poet The bitter chrysanthemum Untamed by frost Spending gold in bleak weather  II  Mine shall be A lean geranium in a pot Climbing the cottage pane Old leaves yellow and drop off New green puts out I like it for the pungent scent it gives When you bruise it Though lacking sun it may never afford A scarlet flower  JEUNE FILLB  Beneath the ledges Lie the pools Cupped in the ruddy rock Bright pools of mountain water   Jeune Fille  Unimaginably clear There is no sky no distance The friendly wood leans near  In wet luxurious moss I plant my feet Unimaginably white It pleases me to think of my white body here Released in fair water to charm A delicate lover  PASTEL  She has a clear wind sheltered loveliness Like pale streams winding far and hills withdrawn From the bright reaches of the noon Dawn Is her lifting fancy but her heart Is orchard boughs and dusk and quietness  A GALLANT WOMAN  She burst fierce wine From the tough skin of pain Like wind that wrings from rigid skies A scant and bitter gleam Long after the autumnal dusk Has folded all the valleys in   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SCHERZO  The elder s bridal in July Bright as a cloud A ripe blonde girl Billowing to the ground in foamy petticoats With breasts full blown Swelling her bodice  But later When the small black ruddy berries Tempt the birds to strip the stems And the leaves begin to yellow and fall off While late summer s still in its green Then you look lank and used up Elder Your big bones stick out You re the kind of woman Wears bleak at forty  I ll take my constant pleasure In a willow tree that ripples silver All the summer And when the winter comes in greasy rags Like a half naked beggar Lets out the plaited splendor Of her bright and glancing hair  Clara Shanafelt   POEMS OF HAPPINESS  VISION  I entered the Cathedral Not a Gothic one with broadly spreading arches But with dwarfed limbs tortured By economy It was draped in feeble mourning And a purple memorial to a ponderous bishop Hung before the altar of Christ  To the right was a candle lit shrine Of raw colors Before it knelt a man Eyes closed hands raised lips moving A passion of prayer  Perhaps he had been caught in a crime Was smitten with disease owed money And was afraid Perhaps perhaps  But there was the faith Filling and surrounding him Filling the air filling the church With clouds of ecstasy  And he crossed himself As if he marked the sign   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  On his soul And on the world  Then he took his paper And his hat And went to catch the trolley Oh my dim eyes How often divinity wears A derby hat And carries A sporting extra  FAIR WEATHER AND I HAPPY  The sky yesterday heavy as earth Made me alone bear its weight Today it flies floats High as Thy mercies And where the light is most glorious There am I at the zenith Singing with the sun  HAPPINESS  A blue sky with the morning s freshness in it A live wind on the hill top blowing free The thin clear pipe of some close perching linnet Beyond the hills the sunlight on the sea   A Child s Grace  A CHILD S GRACE  Down in time for breakfast And a clean green dress And my hair Curled in six Three on one side And three on the other And I Very well washed All over Opposite me is the Baby With his bib Pink With white elephants on it And there is mother And father And we bend our heads Over our blue plates with oranges Our grace is silent You can talk that way you know To God Though sometimes you have to scream At Baby To make him pay attention If he is playing and you want him to come After grace is over I feel quite new And very clean Rosalind Mason   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MAGIC  We passed old farmer Boothby in the field Rugged and straight he stood his body steeled With stubbornness and age We met his eyes That never flinched or turned to compromise And Luck he cried good luck and waved an arm Knotted and sailor like such as no farm In all of Maine could boast of and away He turned again to pitch his new cut hay We walked on leisurely until a bend Showed him once more now working toward the end Of one great path wearing his eighty years Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers  Then we turned off abruptly took the road Cutting the village the one with the commanding View of the river And we strode More briskly now to the long pier that showed Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing In the canoe we stepped our paddles dipped Leisurely downwards and the slim bark slipped More on than in the water Smoothly then We shot its nose against the rippling current Feeling the rising river s half deterrent Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade To keep from swerving round while we delayed To watch the curious wave eaten locks   Magic  Or pass with lazy turns the picnic rocks Blue eels flew under us and fishes darted A thousand ways the once broad channel shrunk And over us the wise and noble hearted Twilight leaned down the sunset mists were parted And we with thoughts on tiptoe slunk Down the green alleys of the Kennebunk  Motionless in the meadows The trees the rocks the cows And quiet dripped from the shadows Like rain from heavy boughs  The tree toads started ringing Their ceaseless silver bells A land locked breeze came swinging Its censer of earthy smells  The river s tiny canon  Stretched into dusky lands Like a dark and silent companion Evening held out her hands  Hushed were the dawn s bravados Loud noon was a silenced cry And Quiet slipped from the shadows As stars slip out of the sky  It must have been an hour more or later When tramping homeward through the piney wood   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  We felt the years fly back the brotherhood Of forests took us and we saw the satyr There in a pool up to his neck he stood And grinned to see us stare incredulous Too startled to remember fear or flight Feeling the menace in the crafty night We turned to run when lo he called to us Using our very names he called We drew With creaking courage down the avenue Of birches till we saw with clearing sight No longer through a tricky pale green light Familiar turns and shrubs the friendly path And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath The woods became his background every tree Seemed part of him and stood erect and shared The beauty of that gnarled serenity The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared Its shoulders against Time And even Night Flowed in and out of him as though content With such an element Happy to move about a spirit quite As old as placid and as confident  Sideways we turned All glistening and unclad He leaped up on the bank light as a lad His body in the moonlight dripping stars We went on homeward through the pasture bars   Beauty  BEAUTY  Beauty shall not lead me No on no more passionate and never ending quests I am tired of stumbling after her Through wild familiar forests and strange morasses Tired of breaking my heart and losing my sleep following  a fitful gleam  Beauty you shall fly before me no longer Smiling looking back over your shoulder with beckoning  blushes Wanton trickster trifler with weak men Demanding all and giving nothing in return But furious dreams and shattering visions  Beauty I shall have you Not in imagination only but in the flesh You will pursue me with untiring breath you will press  by my side wherever I go Even in the muddy squalor and the thick welter of ugliness You shall run to me and put your arms about my hips and  cling to me And try as I will you will never be shaken off  Beauty I know you now And knowing and loving you I will thirst for you no longer    J  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Yes I shall have you For I shall run on recklessly And you will follow after  Louis Untermeyer  MOON IN THE MORNING  What dost thou so ghostly white In the halls of day Facing the triumphant light Reveler astray  When thy silver court was kept Thou and thine were free And the sun while dotards slept Did not spy on thee  Scent of jasmine voices low Dost thou seek them yet Lovers of the long ago Thou canst not forget  Day s gay banners all unfurled Flaunt from sea to sea All the work of all the world Calls the sun and me   Moon in the Morning  Nay thou shalt not bid me stand Nay I will not yield Strong to day in my right hand Is the brand I wield  Then aroint thee shadow fly Wherefore haunt me so Hanging mournful in the sky  Pale and loath to go  Mary Eleanor Roberts  ECHO  Love said farewell yet not with moan or tears Did he recall the gladness of the years We walked together With a little laugh Ah but no weeping ever could be half So sad out from my open door he went His bowed wings torn his breathing slow and spent And though I know not whither he is gone I hear his laughter from the dusk till dawn  Charlotte Becker   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE WOOD BROOK  Like some wild child that laughs and weeps Impatient of its mother s arms The wood brook from the hillside leaps Eager to reach the neighboring farms Complaining crystal in its throat It bubbles a protesting note  The wild flowers that the forest weaves To deck it with are thrust aside And all the little happy leaves That would detain it are denied It must be gone it does not care Away away no matter where  Ah if it knew what work awaits  Beyond the woodland s peace and rest  What toil and soil of rran s estates  What contact with life s sorriest  A different mind it then might keep  And hush its frenzy into sleep  Make of its trouble there a pool  A dim circumference filled with sky  And trees wherein the beautiful  Contemplates silence with a sigh   The Wood Brook  As mind communicates with mind Of intimate things they have in kind  Encircled of the wood s repose Contentment then to it would give The peace of lily and of rose And love of all wild things that live And let it serve as looking glass For myths and dreams the wildwood has  THE DEAD CHILD  She made the garden her fast friend then she And it in Autumn faded quietly The sunlight went And then they fell asleep And lay beneath one covering white and deep  Now all at once the garden wakes to light And still the child sleeps on clasped close in night Where dost thou hide the garden seems to purr And asks again and yet again for her  The azure wind seeks softly for her face Peers in the house Come from thy hiding place Thou dost thyself a wrong Where art thou gone Come let us see the new frock thou hast on  Madison Cawein   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  DESIRE  I would send these dreams of yours and mine re borning I would send our love out to seek noble flight Over the interminable mountains of the morning Over the endless oceans of the night I would put the lightness of it into laughter I would put the sorrow of it into song That should go echoing on for ages after That should make glad the world whole aeons long I would tell in deathless paint the glory of it I would tell in immutable stone its majesty To halo it and hold a light above it To temper it with immortality  I would spin it to the heavens span on span Were I but oh a little more than man  THE DRINKER  Tired of the world and weary of its ways Lonely and old and broken now he nods Among the idols he mistook for gods A ruin in the wreck of yesterdays And since his mad past must be hung in haze Since he must fog his senses lest he think How youth and hope and all were lost in drink Since he must never know how high he pays   The Drinker  He sits and sips and gives himself to dreams Fond dreams wherein he sees himself again The lad who thought that life was all it seems And now there is a glory in his eyes Forgotten are the bitterness and pain Of the rue years this is his paradise  YOU CAME AND WENT  All as a bird sails through the silent night On swift wings bent Leaving a wake of music in its flight You came and went  H Thompson Rich   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  LAMENT  A daughter wails by the coffin of her mother  O my little mother O my little comforter O my little defender Thanks unto your little hands that brought me up thanks unto your little legs that walked beside me thanks unto your mind that taught me thanks unto your little mouth that spoke to me so kindly  Who shall speak to me kindly now who shall teach me kindly My little mother who shall defend me now to whom shall I complain now with whom shall I speak The cuckoo of the woods ceases to cry but I never shall cease  My mother you do not sigh any more My mother you do not groan my little mother Say a word to me give consolation to my mournful little heart  All the night I am trying to talk to you yet I hear not a word from my little mother O my little mother the little guest O my little mother the wanderer  Ah they build for my little mother a home of white boards without a window of glass without a door You will not see my mother the sun rising neither the sun setting  The last time the last little short while now we are talking to each other Oh if I could I would wake up my dear little mother   Lament  Oh when will you come to me when will you visit me From which country shall I await you From which corner shall I greet you Mother mine day and night I shall walk but I ll meet you nowhere but I ll find you nowhere  II  Ah my little mother you have left me a little orphan and now where am I to go where am I to conceal myself where find a shelter Ah every wind will blow on me now every rain will find me now  O my little mother the summer will come the cuckoo will cry in the woods and I shall think that those are the words of my mother  I shall come to the grave of my little mother and there on the path I ll find the green grass growing and the white little clovers curling  My father my old wise head will you recognize my little mother there Oh my father meet my little mother I pray you take her by her white little hands and place her on the bench of the Souls of the Dead  O my little mother say thanks unto your young little brothers and your little neighbors who build for you a new little home without windows and without doors Oh my little mother how will you bear the new boards Oh how will you bear the brown earth on you  From a Lithuanian folk song translated by Kleofas Jurgelionis  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EDITORIAL COMMENT  VARIOUS VIEWS  SOMEWHERE I have read a quaint old  myth of a goblin who blowing the fog out  of his face started a tempest which went  careering around the world Now and then  I feel like that goblin Is it possible that less than four years ago poetry was the Cinderella of the arts Already a great wind is blowing her ashes away and on the horizon are rolling dust clouds which may conceal a coach and four or is it an automobile  For there must be some gift of the gods in the large and many colored cloud of words which fills our eyes and ears Never before was there so much talk about poetry in this western world or so much precious print devoted to its schools and schisms This is at it should be no doubt It may be evidence of that poetic renaissance which some of us profess already to be living in or at least it may initiate that great audience which will be ready for the renaissance when it comes A breach has been made we may hope in that stone wall of public apathy which tended to silence the singer ere he began By and by he may win who knows academic honors prizes travelling scholarships admission to Arts Clubs and American Academies at Rome even prices that would mean a living wage  The different points of view from which modern poetry may be regarded have been conveniently epitomized this   Various Views  spring in Chicago by a number of lecturers We may pass over Mr Masefield because his talk did not touch upon his contemporaries and come to the series given at the Little Theatre by Mr Maurice Browne Miss Amy Lowell and Mr Arthur Ficke  Mr Browne dealt chiefly with the spiritual austerities of the art He warned us the American people that we were shirking truth shirking life and that our poets with few exceptions were too consistently expressing this attitude He repeated the familiar and I think essentially superficial accusation that our ideals are wholly material and compared our contemporary poetry unfavorably with that of England a land which seemed to him under the stress of war vibrant with beautiful and noble song Although some of us could not agree with this estimate of relative values and even wondered whether the speaker had penetrated to the heart of our democracy we were stirred by his plea for the primal simplicities the austere aspirations which underlie great poetry  Miss Lowell was more specific Her subject was the new movement in poetry which began she was gracious enough to say with the publication of our first number in October 1912 She grouped the more significant first appearances around this date Pound coming a little before and Lindsay Frost Lawrence Sandburg Masters the imagists and the Georgian group a little later By the new movement she meant that definite separation from the Victorian tradition that greater austerity of meaning economy   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of phrase and freedom of rhythmic movement of which imagism her special topic became one important manifestation The heredity of the new movement may be traced she thought in two streams the imagists from Coleridge and Poe through the French symbolists whom these two poets greatly influenced and other free verse poets from Whitman who though almost without prototype may be considered something of an admixture of the ethical spirit of Wordsworth with the free beauty loving spirit of Coleridge The speaker then presented in her most brilliant and persuasive manner her ideas of the laws and boundaries of imagism confining her discussion of it chiefly to the group represented in the Houghton Mifflin anthologies  Mr Ficke s contribution to the symposium was a plea for the older forms Free verse he thought an instrument of narrow range and imagism effective only in the presentation of detached details incapable of larger completeness The poet finds freedom he thought only in chains the closer his metric the greater his joy in fitting his pace to the pattern of its measures  And finally before the Fortnightly the oldest of Chicago s women s clubs Mr Witter Bynner disposed of the new movement altogether Modern poetry his topic confined him to British poets began in his opinion with Kipling and the Shropshire Lad it continues with Alfred Noyes and Masefield and Moira O Neill who is greater than Yeats and the dear public is always right about it He was vagarious enough to admit that Mr Hueffer s On Heaven though neither Kiplingesque nor Noyesy is the   Various Views  finest poem of the decade but he worked off a long cherished grudge against the imagists hurling more adjectives at their devoted heads than one may find in all their poems Mr Pound especially was shown up as that son of shame the good poet gone wrong a dark mixer of poisons for the innocent  It might be in order to submit if the point were not too obvious that much of Kipling and possibly a very little of Alfred Noyes will have the kind of permanent rank in poetry which Verdi and Massenet will doubtless hold in music and that the Shropshire Lad must always be cherished as one of the pure singers as exquisite in simplicity and clarity as a fine soprano voice but that all of these however valuable stand outside the procession the movement The are not the torch bearers of the art bringing a new motive and manner passing on the flame to the future like Tchaikovsky and Debussy and Richard Strauss in music Probably it is too early to determine whether Masters or Sandburg Pound or Hueffer or any of the imagists whom Miss Lowell admires and Mr Bynner despises will be proved torch bearers in this high sense Some of us think that the wise future will accord that rank to a few of them If not then there are no torches aflame in the art  at present and no movement to talk about But in all the talk there is something which does not quite satisfy still less inspire No doubt the note of partisan ardor is the proper and inevitable thing thus have the battles of art been fought from the beginning of time whenever and wherever art has been vital and sincere Yet   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  find myself wishing for less seriousness less dogmatism less exactitude in the drawing of lines and definitions and for more urbanity more gaiety more sense of perspective more of that fundamental humor which recognizes that we human beings are all motes dancing in shade or sun and that art is merely the push of certain particles toward the golden gleam of beauty Is it not indeed one of the true functions of art as of religion to keep man in his place to rebuke his intense and absurd preoccupations with business or power with love or war or glory by reminding him of the infinite revealing those vast spaces beyond the range of his marching feet his reaching hands his soaring spirit Only thus through intuition of his littleness is he made aware of his greatness as a necessary motive in the universal scheme and taken out of the dull and narrow range of unimaginative existence H M  THIS CONSTANT PREACHING TO THE MOB  Time and again the old lie There is no use talking to the ignorant about lies for they have no criteria Deceiving the ignorant is by some regarded as evil but it is the demagogue s business to bolster up his position and to show that God s noblest work is the demagogue Therefore we read again for the one thousand one hundred andeleventh time that poetry is made to entertain As follows The beginnings of English poetry made by a rude war faring people for the entertainment of men at arms or for men at monks tables   This Constant Preaching to the Mob  Either such statements are made to curry favor with other people sitting at fat sterile tables or they are made in an ignorance which is charlatanry when it goes out to vend itself as sacred and impeccable knowledge  The beginnings for entertainment has the writer of this sentence read The Seafarer in Anglo Saxon Will the author tell us for whose benefit these lines which alone in the works of our forebears are fit to compare with Homer for whose entertainment were they made They were made for no man s entertainment but because a man believing in silence found himself unable to withhold himself from speaking And that more uneven poem The Wanderer is like to this a broken man speaking  Ne maeg werigmod wryde withstondan ne se hreo hyge helpe gef remraan for thon domgeorne dreorigne oft in hrya breostcofan bindath faeste  For the doom eager bindeth fast his blood bedraggled heart in his breast an apology for speaking at all and speech only pardoned because his captain and all the sea faring men and companions are dead some slain of wolves some torn from the cliffs by sea birds whom they had plundered  Such poems are not made for after dinner speakers nor was the eleventh book of the Odyssey Still it flatters the mob to tell them that their importance is so great that the solace of lonely men and the lordliest of the arts was created for their amusement Ezra Pound   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NOTES ON THE BOOKER WASHINGTON TRILOGY  Ideas are raging through the brains of even the duskiest of the negro leaders and one can handle for such an audience almost any large thought he thinks he understands He can put it into negro poetry I maintain if he is man enough and still have it negro poetry But he must keep his manner bright colored full throated relaxed and tropical By manner I do not mean dialect There are innumerable Pullman porters who speak English in a close approach to the white man s way But their thoughts and fancies are still straight from the jungle  I have dedicated this trilogy to the memory of Booker T Washington Several years ago a band of able people from Tuskegee came to the I N G Arsenal of Springfield Illinois and sang to an audience largely black for the benefit of their school The leader explained in plain white man s English that while there were trained musicians in the company who could do the average concert thing after the manner of white people the music department of Tuskegee was bending such skill as it had to the development of the old plantation songs and camp meeting spirituals as a real basis for the future music of the race So we had the original melodies plus brains  I have tried to assimilate their idea in this Booker Washington memorial  Simon Legree is an Afro American grotesque John Brown an Afro American hero tale King Solomon an Afro American jubilee song Legree is a serious attempt to record the   Notes on the Booker Washington Trilogy  devil fear that haunts the race though it is written with a humorous close John Brown records the race patriotism with a flare of rebellion King Solomon the race utopianism with an overgrowth of the tropical  Almost any reading negro whatever his shrewd silence during working hours is bound to remember Uncle Tom s Cabin with gratitude and John Brown as well He is bound to have an infinite variety of thoughts about them grave and gay And negro leaders of whatever faction hope for the day when their race will be truly redeemed They look forward to it with the same passion that moves the other idealists of the world but with an utterly different imagination  Their year of jubilee is indeed distant The King Solomon poem looks as far into the future as the Chinese Nightingale into the past and may be considered its direct antithesis in many ways  I am conscious that Booker Washington might have looked upon the mere titles and ostensible themes of these pieces with a certain good natured irony and I am not attempting to commit him posthumously to any of my views of his race He was all for common sense and friendship with good white people He was for self help and the attaining of the millenium one plain step at a time  The stanza that directly applies to him is the one on King Solomon s shepherds for Booker Washington was certainly a shepherd of the sheep A mere incident of his shepherding was the correct art theory of his Tuskegee POETRY A Magazine of Verse  singers Standing on that theory I offer this trilogy Upon that theory I have tried to produce something that will interest the more sophisicated colored people as art first of all I have left out dialect in the spelling as an irrelevant matter and I have tried to leave out stupidity in the plot as no longer essential in attempting work tropical and strictly Afro American V L  REVIEWS  MR MASTERS NEW BOOK  Songs and Satires by Edgar Lee Masters Macmillan Co  This poet has been likened to Chaucer and it may be that in nothing does the resemblance apply more than in his exuberance Chaucer was no pruner and whittler if the cost of parchment and copyists did not cut down his product in the fourteenth century the multiplicity of books would not frighten him to day He would pour out his soul as freely and carelessly now as then because of the overflowing of life from deep wells within him And his public would have to take or leave what he might choose to give them they could not dictate  So Mr Masters now that he has found his public refuses to coddle it If Spoon River was his speech to the jury in the great court room of life this new book is informal talking and story swapping after the court has adjourned The excited galleries would like to have the speech go on but there is a time for all things another masterpiece tomorrow   Mr Masters New Book  maybe meantime let s talk about Helen of Troy or Saint Peter or the way God makes atoms and worlds or Jim s rather plodding love affair or my best beloved uncle or any old queerness of this antic loving planet And talk he does very near singing sometimes and more entertainingly and with more variety than any other poet in seven counties I mean countries  Thus the new book is all kinds for all men good bad or indifferent just as it happens But if Helen of Troy is almost the worst poem which that long suffering lady has ever had to endure So we Grew together and Silence and Simon Surnamed Peter and The Cocked Hat and William Marion Reedy art fascinating intriguing poems of beauty and passion yes and also quite surprisingly those three on legendary subjects the two Lancelot ballads which throw Tennyson s expurgated version into the discard by giving us the real Malory and the finely intuitive Saint Francis and Lady Clare which strips bare the impassioned soul of a nun revealing her quaintly mediaeval ecstatic religiosity  Here in short is a big all round profoundly imaginative poet Not one of fine shades and nice selections an exact student of his own art but a real man and a generous lover of life who is kindled to a singing flame by the mysterious harmonies and discords of the world He lights up for us not only wide open spaces but all sorts of odd tricks and dark corners sometimes with a white fire of truth and again with smoky earth smelling loud crackling laughter   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And he speaks in our idiom He is modern in our time just as Dante was in his or Molière in his like them at heart a haughty idealist he also is bent upon pulling down the hollow shells of outworn systems which have thickened and darkened around the souls of men and showing us how to build the new more democratic city toward which our steps are stumbling  The absurdity and divinity of that morsel of dust and fire which we call a human being what modern poet what modern writer expresses this with such uncanny intimacy as Mr Masters Was satire ever more searching than in A Cocked Hat or in a certain sense more loving as the best satire must be Mr Bryan s portrait the majestic failure of his career is painted for all time and incidentally the facile ideals and weaknesses of the typical American are held up for his own sober second thought And the same theme the divinity and absurdity of man is treated  in a mood of serious sympathy in So We Grew Together and All Life in a Life and in a mood of exaltation in The Cry The Conversation and The Star  There are those strangely enough who find in Spoon River a shriveling of life failing to see the fierce white hot idealism which vitalizes its bitter knowledge Perhaps they may find it in this new volume At any rate we may set down here for their benefit the book s concluding lines from one of its most loftily beautiful poems The Star The passage is the prayer of mad Frederick  Give me to understand O Star Your inner self your eternal spirit   Mr Masters New Book  That I may have you and not images of you So that I may know what has driven me through the world And may cure my soul For I know you are Eternal Love And I can never escape you And if I cannot escape you Then I must serve you And if I must serve you It must be to good and not ill You have brought me from the forest of pools And the images of stars Here to the Hill s top Where now do I go And what shall I do  H M  THE RADICALS  Others an Anthology of the New Verse edited by Alfred Kreymborg Alfred A Knopf New York One cannot review this collection without connecting it  with the magazine Others from which it is taken so I may as well say that for its editor I have nothing but praise and I believe that its most radical experiments the works of Mina Loy Rodker Sanborn etc should be published I assume that even Miss Monroe whose editorial ideal evidently is for poems of more artistic permanence than many in this volume are will agree with me that every lover of art no matter what his own tastes are should encourage the more experimental work too Besides we have here many things for which we can only be grateful  Pound s Shop girl is lovely the beginning is as good as some of the Chinese masterpieces he has recreated for us In Another Man s Wife he has caught a delicate charm in the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  bloom it is an expression of a rare and pure artistic refinement Arensberg s June and The Swan stand up well beside these Graceful as the tilting of a bird is the greater part of Peter Quince in spite of some slight technical defects in the construction Some of Miss Crapsey s Cinquains are lovely Kreymborg s Convention and some of his Variations are with us to stay no matter what form poetry may take in the future Eliot s Portrait of a Woman though reminiscent of Henry James is skilfully done and haunts the reader I like it better than his Love song of J Alfred Prufrock as here the writer is less interested in futuristic effects and is trying to express the drama to the best of his ability Francis Gregg s Quest is somewhat commonplace and Iris is a lifeless imitation of H D but Perché is lovely and like H D s poem about the rose in In the Garden which appeared in POETRY is a step into a new style Les Ombres de la Mer has this quality in a lesser degree Horace Holley s You possesses it too  Mary Aldis Three Sisters is interesting as a study of temperaments and it has a charm of wistfulness hard to define R C Brown too is interesting W C Williams is not represented by as good work as he has had in POETRY but his workmanship is almost always careful and the spirit of his poems is always sincere This remark applies to Carl Sandburg as well I like also Helen Hoyt s unique Coignes and Homage this latter poem has a quality which is hard to describe Perhaps the popular term dear comes nearest Mr Ficke s poem would have been better without the in   The Radicals  troduction He has all of us with our conventional ideas for an audience and does not need a special one But I believe Mr Ficke only feels really free when he has half a dozen or more chains around him  But there are many things in this collection that are not beautiful even if one takes the word in its most modern sense  Skipwith Cannéll s preface of several pages is of some interest but the poetry that one expects after so long a preface is not there I may as well here express the startling opinion to which many poets will object that repeating the Nietzsche which one has picked up from Bernard Shaw and newspaper gossip is not poetry There was a real Nietzsche and he has written much better poetry though in prose form than any of his interpreters The influence of Gauguin I could not find unless it is in the spacing  Of Rodker s contributions Twilight and Lunatic seem the best but they lack depth It is book impressionism When one compares The Dutch Dolls with that somewhat disagreeable but sincere bit of work W C Williams Ogre for instance one can see how superficial it is  Under the thin or thick veil of obscurity some of these poets are tempted toward a more or less delicate charlatanism poor workmanship vulgar smartness etc then there are also the newest clichés which save the writer real thinking and one can only be grateful that poets do not more often and more fully take advantage of these opportunities  Some of the writers in this volume are over tempted   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Robert Alden Sanborn is one of these At the risk of being unfair to him I will take him as an example because I believe he is talented enough to be worth stirring up The lotus animate winged for escape though not new is passable To the cupped hand of night is lovely but Scooping green and pink stars out of the unknown abysses of space is of the new cliches it is in the air if you just reach out your finger for it as much as any of the older ones The stem hinting of some old connection forgotten scandal in the taciturn mud is a dull forced and not clearly realized piece of writing insincere Close as leaves fallen on wet grass describes the situation there badly it is taken almost bodily from Pound and is brought in only for its newness  The quality and workmanship in Mr Bodenheim s poems in this collection are much better than in his earlier ones yet even here the poet can not always resist using the most puzzling and shocking pigment instead of the simplest and most suitable as A filled chest unable to open itself in a poem otherwise very good In this manner there is the temptation to make a commonplace main idea do as all of Mina Loy s poems interesting as they are as an experiment will prove to anyone who penetrates her color jargon I think Evening in which they hang up the crude little Japanese lanterns of their thoughts on the ever swaying strings of their minds is not any better than the same thought expressed more directly The art value of rope dancing lies in the dance rhythm only in nothing else   The Radicals  Taken as a whole I think the volume interesting and stimulating When one tries to realize clearly all the drudgery toil and self sacrifice involved in such pioneer editing one must extend to Mr Kreymborg hearty good wishes for success in his venture Max Michelson  THE BROOKE LETTERS  Henry James s last gracious service was to introduce Rupert Brooke that being young happy radiant extraordinarily endowed and irresistibly attaching whose life in England and whose death among the Greek Islands have lately received such wide celebration Mr James first met Brooke in that delectable tract the Cambridge backs and wondered what so splendid a setting could do with the added grace of such a person wondered too why the youth pointed out as a poet should need to be a poet why should he specialize why be anything but his own attractive self  Well Brooke in his Letters from America is not a poet He is a kind humorous intelligent young gentleman somewhat puzzled in an alien field trying to mix as far as may be and hoping not to be unduly fastidious and difficult His first encounter is of course with New York He deals cautiously and forbearingly with its superficial aspects its streets by day and by night He lets off a set piece of his own on the town s electric signs with such aids mythological and philosophical as are at the finger tips of a young uni   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  versity man and it is only from farthest Ontario that he gives his real impression in one word New York is hellish He does better with Boston than with New York and better with Quebec than with Boston  By the same token he does better with the Canadian Rockies than with Eastern Canada and better with Samoa than with the Canadian Rockies He seems in one phase a child of nature impatient with the repellent rawnesses of a new civilization and ever welcoming the simpler types and wider spaces that lie beyond He treats the older Canada with an incisive cursory disdain one feels that in noting its crudities and corruptions he is but registering another deferred opinion on things upon our own side of the line  Niagara the Saguenay the mountains around Calgary the Indians the sea enwrapped Samoans such are the things that stir his nature and bring the poetical phrases to his pen Better these than the bumptious sophistications of our new cities but better still than these the ripe settled time worn ways of his own native village Brooke like James himself misses in new lands the moral interest Ours is a new world indeed virginal a godless place There are no ghosts of lovers in Canadian lanes It is possible at a pinch to do without gods But one misses the dead  Caught between a citizen of Edmonton and one of Calgary each boasting the growth of his own town in wealth and population Brooke sends his thoughts back to Grantchester which at Doomsday Book numbered four hundred   The Brooke Letters  souls but has now declined to three hundred and fifty They seemed perplexed and angry  On the whole a book not greatly important in itself but welcome indeed as showing certain facets of a rich vivid attractive nature and as helping to furnish forth a youth who otherwise would be none too heavily documented for the prized and permanent place he will hold in English letters H B F CORRESPONDENCE  I  Dear Editor Looking over the new number of POETRY this morning when I ought to be at work I notice that you again suggest as several times before that college faculties are not interested in the present day poetic movements and I feel moved to enter a quiet protest I will leave Yale and Mount Holyoke and others to speak for themselves but here at Wellesley founded by an enthusiastic lover of poetry the late Henry F Durant we have since those early days when we listened to the voices of Longfellow and Matthew Arnold reading their poems on our chapel platform down to this very year in which seven poets Mr Masefield Mrs Marks Miss Lowell Mr Dole Miss Converse Mrs Evans and Mr Lindsay have read to us held current poetry in honor I have too a senior one hour a week course in twentieth century poetry giving the first semester to English poets and the second to American Taking our English semester for example we have discussed in the classroom   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Meredith Hardy and

blood owner and all Rush along in I love  Alfred Kreymborg   PRIZE ANNOUNCEMENT  Never has POETRY undertaken a task so difficult as this awarding of a prize in its one act play contest In the first place we have to admit that none of the submitted plays unites under a single title our own conditions of poetic beauty actability and a subject either American or of modern significance through life unlocalized Among the six plays sifted out of nearly an hundred which seem to the judges most worthy of consideration the choice must involve a compromise in one direction or another  Only one of the six The Lynching is a straight treatment of a modern American theme Another The Daughter of the Sun is a play of prehistoric legendary life and myth in Arizona or New Mexico A third The Garden is a study of temperament a symbolic presentation of life as it appears to the American young girl  The other three plays are all exotic One The Shadow is placed somewhere in the East and the motive is frankly Buddhistic though the judges think they find in it an allegoric treatment of the present international problem man s hesitation between the pacifist and the militarist ideals In the other two though the scenes are laid in San Francisco and Pennsylvania the characters are chiefly Chinese and it is these two strangely enough which because of their poetic or dramatic quality have seemed to the judges the chief claimants for the prize  In their final decision the judges find themselves forced   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  to choose between a pretty and dramatically competent play on a tenderly human subject and a strange and fantastic work of original genius which whatever its dramatic value and however diverting or repelling its story has extraordinary poetic beauty and presents symbolically a profound  truth of our mysterious earthly existence As to its actability opinions differ Two or three experienced producers in the art theatre movement think that a stage production would clarify and intensify its subtle poetic significance and beauty but most of the judges doubt if it would get across to more than a fraction of the audience They feel however that it is an outreaching experiment that whether it is wholly achieved or not the fire and light in it may blaze new trails that in this formative moment of our poetic drama when the future looks large before us and nobody can tell what it will bring forth the original creative impulse should be encouraged POETRY has stood from the beginning for the original creative impulse for the outreaching experiment Its course is not safe and sane perhaps but it must continue in this spirit it must place its stake on human genius and follow with a certain loyalty the wayward torch of beauty even though ignorant where it will lead  It is in this spirit that the judges award the prize of one hundred dollars offered by an anonymous donor for a one act poetic play to  MR WALLACE STEVENS  for Three Travellers Watch a Sunrise   The following plays receive honorable mention  The Sweetmeat Game by Ruth Comfort Mitchell  The Daughter of the Sun by Marian Keep Patton  The Garden by Florence Kiper Frank  The Shadow by Perry B Corneau  The Lynching by Miriam Allen de Ford  The prize winning play will be printed in either the July  or the August number of POETRY  One of the judges dissents from the above award  NOTES
