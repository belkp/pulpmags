is that the Waki or subsidiary character shall go a journey and meet with some genius loci or some returning spirit In NISHIKIGI Love wands or Charm sticks the Waki is journeying near Mount Shinobu and meets the ghosts of two lovers  PART FIRST  Waki a Priest There never was anybody heard of Mt Shinobu but had a kindly feeling for it so I like any other priest that might want to know a little bit about each one of the provinces may as well be walking up here along the much travelled road  I have not yet been about the east country but nowhave set my mind to go as far as the earth goes and why shouldn t I after all seeing that I go about with my heart set upon no particular place whatsoever and with no other man s flag in my hand no more than a cloud has It   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  is a flag of the night I see coming down upon me I wonder now would the sea be that way or the little place Kefu that they say is stuck down against it  Shite and Tsure The ghosts of two lovers long dead and not yet really united Times out of mind am I here setting up this bright branch this silky wood with the charms painted in it as fine as the weave you d get in the grass cloth of Shinobu that they d be still selling you in this mountain  Shite To Tsure Tangled we are entangled Whose fault was it dear Tangled up as the grass patterns are tangled up in this coarse cloth or as the little Mushi that lives on and chirrups in dried sea weed We do not know where are today our tears in the undergrowth of this eternal wilderness We neither wake nor sleep and passing our nights in a sorrow which is in the end a vision what are these scenes of spring to us This thinking in sleep of someone who has no thought of you is it more than a dream And yet surely it is the natural way of love In our hearts there is much and in our bodies nothing and we do nothing at all and only the waters of the river of tears flow quickly  Chorus  Narrow is the cloth of Kefu but wild is that river that torrent of the hills between the beloved and the bride The cloth she had woven is faded the thousand one hundred nights were night trysts watched out in vain Waki Not recognizing the nature of the speakers Strange indeed seeing these town people here   Nishikigi  They seem like man and wife And the lady seems to be holding something Like a cloth woven of feathers While he has a staff or a wooden sceptre Beautifully ornate Both of these things are strange In any case I wonder what they call them  Tsure The woman As for this it is but a narrow cloth called hosonuno It is just the breadth of the loom Shite The man As for this it is merely wood  painted And for both of these things this place is famous Would you be wishing to buy them  Waki Indeed indeed as for the cloths of this place and the lacquers they are famous things that I have already had opportunity to hear about and yet I still wonder why they have such great reputation  Tsure Ah well now that s a disappointment Here they say perfectly for the wood Nishikigi and Hosonuno for the woven stuff and yet you come saying that you have  never heard why and never heard the story Is it reasonable Shite No no that is reasonable enough What can  people be expected to know of these affairs when it is more than they can do to keep abreast of their own Both To the Priest Ah well you look like a person who has abandoned the world it is reasonable enough that   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  you should not know the worth of wands and cloths with love s signs painted upon them with love s marks painted and dyed  Waki That is a fine answer So you would tell me that Nishikigi and Hosonuno are names bound over with love  Shite They are names in love s list surely Every day for a year for three years come to their full were wands Nishikigi set up until there were a thousand in all And they are in song in your time and will be Chidzuka they call them  Tsure These names are surely a by word As the cloth hosonuno is narrow of weft More narrow than the breast We say it of any love Whose breasts are hard to come nigh to It is a name in books of love  Shite Tis a sad name to look back on Tsure A thousand wands were in vain A sad name set in a story Shite A seed pod void of the seed We had no meeting together Tsure Let him read out the story  Chorus  I At last they forget they forget The wands are no longer offered  The custom is faded away   Nishikigi  The narrow cloth of Kefu Will not meet over the breast Tis the story of Hosonuno This is the tale These bodies having no weft  Even now are not come together  Truly a shameful story  A tale to bring shame on the gods  II Ah names of love Now for a little spell For a faint charm only For a charm as slight as the binding together Of pine flakes in Iwashiro  And wishing over them toward the sunset We return and return to our lodging  The evening sun leaves a shadow  Waki Ah go on tell out all of the story  Shite It is an old custom of this country that we make wands of mediation and deck them with symbols and set them before a gate when we are suitors  Tsure And we take up a wand of one we would meet with and let the others lie for a hundred nights it may be or for a thousand nights in three years till there are a thousand wands here in the shade of this mountain   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And here is the funeral cave of such a man who had watched out the thousand nights a bright cave for they have buried him with all his wands The wand cave they call it  Waki I will go to that love cave It will be a tale to take back to my village Will you show me my way there  Shite So be it I will teach you the path  Tsure Tell him to come to this side  Both Here are the pair of them  Going along before the traveller  Chorus  We have spent the whole day until dusk  Pushing aside the grass  From the over grown way at Kefu  Where indeed is the love cave  O you man cutting grass on the hill  Please set your mind on this matter  You d be asking where the dew is  While the frost s lying here on the road  Who d tell you that now  Be that as you will yet we are in earnest  Shite There s a cold feel in the autumn Night comes   Nishìkigi  Chorus  And storms trees giving up their leaf Spotted with sudden showers Autumn Our feet are clogged In the dew drenched entangled leaves The perpetual shadow is lonely The mountain shadow is lying alone The owl cries out from the ivies That drag their weight on the pine  Among the orchids and chrysanthemum flowers  The hiding fox is now lord of that love cave  Nishidzuka  That is dyed like the maple s leaf  They have left us this thing for a saying  That pair have gone into the cave  Sign for the exit of Shite and Tsure  PART SECOND  The Waki has taken the posture of sleep His respectful visit to the cave is beginning to have its effect  Waki Restless It seems that I can not sleep For the length of a cricket s horn Under October wind under pines under night I will perform voice service to Butsu  Tsure Aïe honored priest You do not dip in one river POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Beneath the same tree s shadow  Without bonds in some other life  Hear sooth say  Now is there meeting between us  Between us who were until now  In life and in after life kept apart  A dream bridge over wild grass  Over the grass I dwell in  O honored do not awake me by force  I see that the law is perfect  Shite Supposedly invisible It is a good service you  have done sir A service that spreads in two worlds And binds up an ancient love That was stretched out between them  I had watched for a thousand days  I give you largess  For this meeting is under a difficult law And now I will show myself in the form of Nishikigi  I will come out now for the first time in color  The characters announce or explain their acts as these are mostly symbolical From now on comes the final dance which both chorus and the two chief actors are explaining  Chorus The three years are over and past All that is but an old story   Nishikigi  Shite To dream under dream we return Three years And the meeting comes now This night has happened over and over And only now comes the tryst  Chorus Look there to the cave Beneath the stems of the Suzuki From under the shadows of the love grass See see how they come forth and appear For an instant Illusion  Shite There is at the root of hell No distinction between princes and commons Wretched for me Tis the saying  Waki Strange what seemed so very old a cave Is all glittering bright within Like the flicker of fire It is like the inside of a house They are setting up a loom And heaping up charm sticks No The hangings are out of old time Is it illusion Illusion  Tsure Our hearts have been in the dark of the falling  snow We have been astray in the flurry You should tell better than we How much is illusion You who are in the world We have been in the whirl of  those who are fading   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Shite Indeed in old times Narihira said And as he vanished with the years Let a man who is in the world tell the fact  It is for you traveller To say how much is illusion Waki Let it be a dream or a vision  Or what you will I care not Only show me the old times over past and snowed under Now Soon While the night lasts  Shite Look sharp then for old times are shown Faint as the shadow flower shows in the grass that bears it And you ve but a moon for lanthorn  Tsure The woman has gone into the cave She sets up her loom there For the weaving of hosonuno Thin as the heart of Autumn  Shite The suitor for his part holding his charm sticks Knocks on a gate which was barred  Tsure In old time he got back no answer No secret sound at all Save  Shite The sound of the loom Tsure It was a sweet sound like katydids and crickets A thin sound like the Autumn  Shite It was what you would hear any night Tsure Kiri Shite Hatari Tsure Cho   Nishikigi  Shite Cho Chorus Mimicking the sound of crickets Kiri hatari cho cho Kiri hatari cho cho The cricket sews on at his old rags  With all the new grass in the field sho Churr isho like the whir of a loom churr  Chorus Antistrophe Let be they make grass cloth in Kefu Kefu the land s end matchless in the world  Shite That is an old custom truly But this priest would look on the past  Chorus The good priest himself would be saying Even if we weave the cloth hosonuno And set up the charm sticks For a thousand a hundred nights Even then our beautiful desire will not pass  Nor fade nor die out Shite Even today the difficulty of our meeting is remembered Is remembered in song  Chorus  That we may acquire power Even in our faith substance We will show forth even now And though it be but in a dream Our form of repentance   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Explaining the action  There he is carrying wands And she has no need to be asked See her within the cave With a cricket like noise of weaving The grass gates and the hedge are between them That is a symbol Night has already come on  Now explaining the thoughts of the man s spirit  Love s thoughts are heaped high within him As high as the charm sticks As high as the charm sticks once colored Now fading lie heaped in this cave And he knows of their fading he says I lie a body unknown to any other man Like old wood buried in moss It were a fit thing That I should stop thinking the love thoughts The charm sticks fade and decay And yet The rumor of our love Takes foot and moves through the world We had no meeting But tears have it seems brought out a bright blossom Upon the dyed tree of love  Shite Tell me could I have foreseen Or known what a heap of my writings Should lie at the end of her shaft bench   Nishikigi  Chorus A hundred nights and more Of twisting encumbered sleep  And now they make it a ballad Not for one year or for two only But until the days lie deep As the sand s depth at Kefu  Until the year s end is red with autumn  Red like these love wands A thousand nights are in vain I too stand at this gate side You grant no admission you do not show yourself Until I and my sleeves are faded By the dew like gemming of tears upon my sleeve Why will you grant no admission And we all are doomed to pass You and my sleeves and my tears  And you did not even know when three years had come to an end Cruel ah cruel The charm sticks  Shite Were set up a thousand times Then now and for always Chorus Shall I ever at last see into that room of hers which no other sight has traversed Shite Happy at last and well starred Now comes the eve of betrothal   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  We meet for the wine cup Chorus How glorious the sleeves of the dance  That are like snow whirls Shite Tread out the dance Chorus Tread out the dance and bring music  This dance is for Nishikigi Shite This dance is for the evening plays And for the weaving Chorus For the tokens between lover and lover It is a reflecting in the wine cup  Chorus  Ari aki The dawn Come we are out of our place Let us go ere the light comes  To the Waki  We ask you do not awake We all will wither away The wands and this cloth of a dream Now you will come out of sleep You tread the border and nothing Awaits you no all this will wither away There is nothing here but this cave in the field s midst Today s wind moves in the pines A wild place unlit and unfilled  Translated from the Japanese of Motokiyo by Ernest Fenollosa   THE RAINBIRD  Far off I hear a rainbird Listen How fine and clear His plaintive voice comes ringing With rapture to the ear  Over the misty wood lots Across the first spring heat Comes the enchanted cadence So clear so solemn sweet  How often I have hearkened To that high pealing strain Across the cedar barrens Under the soft gray rain  How often I have wondered And longed in vain to know The source of that enchantmentThat touch of long ago  O brother who first taught thee T o haunt the teeming spring With that divine sad wisdom Which only age can bring  Bliss Carman   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS IKONS  I My thoughts Are little silver fishes jumping in a row Little fishes leaping upon a black cloth With a shark behind them O yellow eyes in the black sea  Too deep lurk the great fishes I cannot sense them  II I have spun me a chain of water And about my throat I have bound it And a pendant of sand I have made And hung it upon my breast And a cross from it  For there is a sea that is like a lurking emerald And my soul is a river of black water that runs Down to that sea  III The eyes of evil men are like onyx or amber A necklace of stone tight round the throats of women  Alas for the tears of evil men Black pearls upon a tablet of silver  THE BLIND MAN He sits in the sun and warms The blind eyes of him In the light of it   Poems  In the heart of him is no anger At the Great Queen Who blinded him Twas a proud woman Put out his eyes and left him To warm their sockets In the heat of the sun  Only in the grey mists Only in the black rain Burns a little anger That she has made him blind  THE DWARF SPEAKS I am a dwarf and I love All men with a love they call Grotesque and horrible I should have died long since For the horrible love they cannot Give in return  EPILOGUE TO THE CROWS I have given you these bones to pick at Draggled crows These pearls I cast before you And their glitter May tempt you T o carry them With bits of twine and pebbles To your nests  Skipwith Cannell    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  TO A FRIEND WHOSE WORK HAS COME TO NOTHING  Now all the truth is out Be secret and take defeat From any brazen throat For how can you compete Being honor bred with one Who were it proved he lies Were neither shamed in his own Nor in his neighbors eyes Bred to a harder thing Than Triumph turn away And like a laughing string Whereon mad fingers play Amid a place of stone Be secret and exult Because of all things known That is most difficult  PAUDEEN  Indignant at the fumbling wits the obscure spite Of our old Paudeen in his shop I stumbled blind Among the stones and thorn trees under morning light   Until a curlew cried and in the luminous wind A curlew answered and I was startled by the thought That on the lonely height where all are in God s eye There cannot be confusion of our sound forgot A single soul that lacks a sweet crystalline cry  TO A SHADE  If you have revisited the town thin Shade Whether to look upon your monument I wonder if the builder has been paid Or happier thoughted when the day is spent T o drink of that salt breath out of the sea When grey gulls fly about instead of men And the gaunt houses put on majesty Let these content you and be gone again For they are at their old tricks yet  A man Of your own passionate serving kind who had brought In his full hands what had they only known Had given their children s children loftier thought Sweeter emotion working in their veins Like gentle blood has been driven from the place And insult heaped upon him for his pains And for his open handedness disgrace   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  An old foul mouth that once cried out on you Herding the pack  Unquiet wanderer Draw the Glasnevin coverlet anew About your head till the dust stops your ear The time for you to taste of that salt breath And listen at the corners has not come You had enough of sorrow before death Away away You are safer in the tomb  WHEN HELEN LIVED  We have cried in our despair That men desert  For some trivial affair  Or noisy insolent sport  Beauty that we have won  From bitterest hours Yet we had we walked within Those topless towers Where Helen walked with her boy  Had given but as the rest  Of the men and women of Troy  A word and a jest   Poems  BEGGAR TO BEGGAR CRIED  Time to put off the world and go somewhere And find my health again in the sea air Beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck And make my soul before my pate is bare  And get a comfortable wife and house To rid me of the devil in my shoes Beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck And the worse devil that is between my thighs  And though I d marry with a comely lass She need not be too comely let it pass Beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck But there s a devil in a looking glass  Nor should she be too rich because the rich Are driven by wealth as beggars by the itch Beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck And cannot have a humorous happy speech  And there I ll grow respected at my ease And hear amid the garden s nightly peace Beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck The wind blown clamor of the barnacle geese   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE WITCH Toil and grow rich What s that but to lie With a foul witch And after drained dry To be brought To the chamber where Lies one long sought With despair  THE PEACOCK  What s riches to him That has made a great peacock With the pride of his eye The wind beaten stone grey And desolate Three rock Would nourish his whim Live he or die Between rock and wet heather His ghost will be gay Adding feather to feather For the pride of his eye   RUNNING TO PARADISE  As I came over Windy Gap They threw a halfpenny into my cap For I am running to Paradise And all that I need do is to wish And somebody puts his hand in the dish To throw me a bit of salted fish And there the king is but as the beggar  My brother Mourteen is worn out With skelping his big brawling lout While I am running to Paradise A poor life do what he can And though he keep a dog and a gun A serving maid and a serving man And there the king is but as the beggar  Poor men have grown to be rich men And rich men grown to be poor again While I am running to Paradise And many a darling wit s grown dull That tossed a bare heel when at school Now it has filled an old sock full And there the king is but as the beggar   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The wind is old and still at play While I must hurry upon my way For I am running to Paradise Yet never have I lit on a friend T o take my fancy like the wind That nobody can buy or bind And there the king is but as the beggar  THE PLAYER QUEEN  Song from an Unfinished Play  My mother dandled me and sang How young it is how young And made a golden cradle That on a willow swung  He went away my mother sang When I was brought to bed And all the while her needle pulled The gold and silver thread  She pulled the thread and bit the thread And made a golden gown And wept because she d dreamt that I Was born to wear a crown   Poems  When she was got my mother sang I heard a sea mew cry And saw a flake of the yellow foam That dropped upon my thigh  How therefore could she help but braid The gold into my hair And dream that I should carry The golden top of care  TO A CHILD DANCING IN THE WIND  Has no one said those daring Kind eyes should be more learned I have found out how despairing The moths are when they are burned But I am old and you are young So we speak a different tongue  Oh you will take whatever s offered And dream that all the world s a friend Suffer as your mother suffered Be as broken in the end I could have warned you but you are young And I speak a barbarous tongue   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE MAGI  Now as at all times I can see in the mind s eye In their stiff painted clothes the pale unsatisfied ones Appear and disappear in the blue depths of the sky With all their ancient faces like rain beaten stones And all their helms of silver hovering side by side And all their eyes still fixed hoping to find once more Being by Calvary s turbulence unsatisfied The uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor  A COAT  I made my song a coat Covered with embroideries Out of old mythologies From heel to throat But the fools caught it Wore it in the world s eye As though they d wrought it Song let them take it For there s more enterprise In walking naked  William Butler Yeats  EDITORIAL COMMENT  THE ENEMIES WE HAVE MADE  EX T to making friends the most thrilling  experience of life is to make enemies  Neither adventure being possible to the dead  the normally healthy person may accept  hand clasps and dagger scratches as tributes  to his vitality Both make his eye flash and his blood tingle both encourage him to go on his way rejoicing  POETRY during its year and a half of life has made friends of a quality higher than the most sanguine editor could have dared to hope for Beginning with its guarantors whose pledge of support was an audacious advance vote of confidence beginning that is at home where one s first friends should be made the magazine has been hailed from far and near by generous spirits who sympathize with its ideals and charitably overlook or forgive its defects or who at least criticize these in a mood of constructive encouragement From France Italy and England from India China and New Zealand and even from our next door neighbors these salutations have come from poets laurelled and obscure from editors and critics classicists and radicals To all who send them much thanks their greetings have magic power to change paper and ink into flesh and blood  And after them thanks to our enemies These to be sure are not so numerous or important but they must not be   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ignored Sometimes they conscientiously express fears like the amused reader who cries desperately in a recent letter Is the unfortunate D H Lawrence insane and who finds it gross injustice to this country and to the cause of true poetic thought to print up such manifest crudity Another correspondent on the contrary feels that we do not strike a popular chord because the subject matter is too classical for the average reader  Again a friendly enemy asks  How can these terrible strainings for effect resulting in a blind crytic concatenation of words unanalyzable be called poetry Must we have futurist Schoenbergs in poetry as in music Give me Homeward Songs by the Way every time rather than Yeats give me Housman rather than Pound I prefer the song sparrow to the mouth organ  The most amiable of all our enemies writes  You have revealed to me an undreamed of poetic continent but I don t know whether I want to settle down there and change my residence The aborigines are a fantastic lot of barbarians they seem to delight in putting in all the things that I leave out when I write I enjoy the poetry of serenity we ll say of meditation humor idealism while these people are trying to give us a touch of the recent fashions in realism just imported from Paris By poetry I try to recover my citizenship in another country No doubt these people are doing that too in their way but I haven t quite recovered from the St Vitus dance they are giving us Of course this kind of poetry cannot be generally understood by the followers of Longfellow poor souls And Tennyson dear old idyllist exquisite fiddler What we want is a real shake down  I wonder if these people have any idea what they are driving at I wonder if they have any fundamental philosophy or religion or anything at all except Sturm und Drang They like to see dabs of crimson and purple slammed all over the canvas Also the unmeaning mystery and obscurity seem to delight them   POEMS  while I have ever trained myself to look for meaning and sense and things admirable Sometimes they tell us to aim high but at Bunker Hill the order was to aim low enough to hit something  A more terrifying enemy is Mrs Ella Wheeler Wilcox who is said to have protested in the National Magazine against our assertion that it is hard for a popular poet to save his soul and that some of them the Tuppers and Wilcoxes of their generation have no souls to save We hasten to withdraw this rash statement with due apologies The trouble with Mrs Wilcox is not that she has no soul no doubt she is richly endowed therewith but that as she herself sang long ago with singular precision  My soul soars not as it ought to soar  But perhaps our most outspoken enemy is our orthodox neighbor The Dial For a year and a half it held aloof while we were introducing Mr Tagore Mr Lindsay and various other poets but now in presenting Mr Sandburg we go a step too far his Chicago proves us a futile little periodical And the editor thus writes himself down  We have always sympathized with Ruskin for the splenetic words about Whistler that were the occasion of the famous suit for libel and we think that such an effusion as this is nothing less than an impudent affront to the poetry loving public  It is possible that we have ventured rashly in discovering Mr Sandburg and the others but whom and what has The Dial discovered We have taken chances made room for the young and the new tried to break the chains which enslave Chicago to New York America to Europe and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the present to the past what chances has The Dial ever taken What has it ever printed but echoes For thirty years it has run placidly along in this turbulent city of Chicago gently murmuring the accepted opinions of such leaders of thought as The Athenaeum and The Spectator During all that third of a century it has borne about as much relation to the intellectual life of this vast chaotically rich region as though it were printed in Glasgow or Caracas Not only has it failed to grasp a great opportunity it has been utterly blind and deaf to it has never known the opportunity was there Is its editor competent to define the word futile  Oh don t bother about The Dial it s quite innocuous says one adviser But is orthodoxy uninspired innocuous Colorless correctness is the blight that corrodes American art today Our criticism is heavy with it our exhibitions books magazines because of it are full of imitations It must not be ignored but fought if our art is ever to be free H M  THE LATER YEATS Responsibilities by W B Yeats The Cuala Press Church town Dundrum I live so far as possible among that more intelligently active segment of the race which is concerned with today and tomorrow and in consequence of this whenever I mention Mr Yeats I am apt to be assailed with questions Will Mr Yeats do anything more Is Yeats in the movement How can the chap go on writing this sort of thing   The Later Yeats  And to these inquiries I can only say that Mr Yeats vitality is quite unimpaired and that I dare say he ll do a good deal and that up to date no one has shown any disposition to supersede him as the best poet in England or any likelihood of doing so for some time and that after all Mr Yeats has brought a new music upon the harp and that one man seldom leads two movements to triumph and that it is quite enough that he should have brought in the sound of keening and the skirl of the Irish ballads and driven out the sentimental cadence with memories of The County of Mayo and The Coolun and that the production of good poetry is a very slow matter and that as touching the greatest of dead poets many of them could easily have left that magnam partem which keeps them with us upon a single quire of foolscap or at most upon two and that there is no need for a poet to repair each morning of his life to the Piazza dei Signori to turn a new sort of somersault and that Mr Yeats is so assuredly an immortal that there is no need for him to recast his style to suit our winds of doctrine and that all these things being so there is nevertheless a manifestly new note in his later work that they might do worse than attend to  Is Mr Yeats an Imagiste No Mr Yeats is a symbolist but he has written des Images as have many good poets before him so that is nothing against him and he has nothing against them les Imagistes at least so far asknow except what he calls their devil s metres  He has written des Images in such poems as Braseal and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the Fisherman beginning Though you hide in the ebb and flow of the pale tide when the moon has set and he has driven out the inversion and written with prose directness in such lyrics as I heard the old men say everything alters and these things are not subject to a changing of the fashions What I mean by the new note you could hardly call it a change of style was apparent four years ago in his No Second Troy beginning Why should I blame her and ending  Beauty like a tightened bow a kind  That is not natural in any age like this Being high and solitary and most stern Why what could she have done being what she is Was there another Troy for her to burn  I am not sure that it becomes apparent in partial quotation but with the appearance of The Green Helmet and Other Poems one felt that the minor note I use the word strictly in the musical sense had gone or was going out of his poetry that he was at such a cross roads as we find in  Voi che intendendo il terso ciel movete  And since that time one has felt his work becoming gaunter seeking greater hardness of outline I do not say that this is demonstrable by any particular passage Romantic Ireland s Dead and Gone is no better than Red Hanrahan s song about Ireland but it is harder Mr Yeats appears to have seen with the outer eye in To a Child Dancing on the Shore the first poem not the one printed in this issue The hardness  can perhaps be more easily noted in The Magi Such poems as When Helen Lived and The Realists    The Later Yeats  serve at least to show that the tongue has not lost its cunning On the other hand it is impossible to take any interest in a poem like The Two Kings one might as well read the Idyls of another The Grey Rock is I admit obscure but it outweighs this by a curious nobility a nobility which is to me at least the very core of Mr Yeats production the constant element of his writing  In support of my prediction or of my theories regarding his change of manner real or intended we have at least two pronouncements of the poet himself the first in A Coat and the second less formal in the speech made at the Blunt presentation The verses A Coat should satisfy those who have complained of Mr Yeats four and forty followers that they would rather read their Yeats in the original Mr Yeats had indicated the feeling once before with  Tell me do the wolf dogs praise their fleas which is direct enough in all conscience and free of the glamour I ve not a word against the glamour as it appears in Yeats early poems but we have had so many other pseudoglamours and glamourlets and mists and fogs since the nineties that one is about ready for hard light  And this quality of hard light is precisely what one finds in the beginning of his The Magi Now as at all times I can see in the mind s eye In their stiff painted clothes the pale unsatisfied ones Appear and disappear in the blue depth of the sky With all their ancient faces like rain beaten stones And all their helms of silver hovering side by side Of course a passage like that a passage of imagisme may  Vide this issue page 60 t Vide POETRY for March 1914 p 223   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  occur in a poem not otherwise imagiste in the same way that a lyrical passage may occur in a narrative or in some poem not otherwise lyrical There have always been two sorts of poetry which are for me at least the most poetic they are firstly the sort of poetry which seems to be music just forcing itself into articulate speech and secondly that sort of poetry which seems as if sculpture or painting were just forced or forcing itself into words The gulf between evocation and description in this latter case is the unbridgeable difference between genius and talent It is perhaps the highest function of art that it should fill the mind with a noble profusion of sounds and images that it should furnish the life of the mind with such accompaniment and surrounding At any rate Mr Yeats work has done this in the past and still continues to do so The present volume contains the new metrical version of The Hour Glass The Grey Rock The Two Kings and over thirty new lyrics some of which have appeared in these pages or appear in this issue In the poems on the Irish gallery we find this author certainly at prise with things as they are and no longer romantically Celtic so that a lot of his admirers will be rather displeased with the book That is always a gain for a poet for his admirers nearly always want him to stay put and they resent any signs of stirring of new curiosity or of intellectual uneasiness I have said the The Grey Rock was obscure perhaps I should not have said so but I think it demands unusually close attention It is as obscure at   Reviews least as Sordello but I can not close without registering my  admiration for it all the same Ezra Pound REVIEWS AphroditeCo and Other Poems by John Helston Macmillan  This book is full to the brim of theoretic passion expressed in an unfailing superabundant flow of language The first poem Lonicera is a dialogue forty pages long in which The Man talks ten pages about his dead affection before The Woman ventures to say It rained that day After that their conversation is full of such original observations as  Men do not love as women do O God who made us women  Perhaps men are more weak albeit more strong And therefore dig their graves the deeper Our love is dead between us at your hands  Et cetera until through vast spaces of eloquence the two arrive at My woodbine bride my darling  Hush the stars  Just observations abound expressed with more or less turgidity in a style long relegated to poetry because so remote from speech For example  This is the hell of woman to have slain Not as the splendid wantons of old time Hot mouthed so even lust was eloquent With raptured immolation love s desire But on the altar of their meaner moods Vainglorious promptings braggart self conceits   POETRY A Magazin e of Verse  and the sentence lists other meaner moods through fourteen more lines Through all the endless mouthing about passion one searches in vain for a single sincere and simple lyric note as through the dialogues one searches in vain for drama  It is wearisome to see this sort of thing accepted as poetry by American critics Is it because Mr Helston was first printed by the English Review which once had a little brief authority as a judge of poetry But Messieurs le roi est mort H M  Poems by Alice Meynell Chas Scribners Sons  White pure cool delicate shy such adjectives as these greet this small volume of collected poems which partly express thirty years emotional experience of a high and sensitive spirit One might wish that the poet were less reserved less austere She is less intimate in verse than in prose for there is nothing here of such poignant beauty as that memorable passage in one of the essays which describes the sublime exaltation of a mother left alone with her child after the storm and stress of its birth  Mrs Meynell is a Roman Catholic and Francis Thompson was her friend but there is no mystical rapture or ritualistic color in her poems Their tone is silvery and the religious motive often present is of an early Protestant severity  Thou art the Way Hadst Thou been nothing but the goal I cannot say If Thou hadst ever met my soul   Notes  The Shepherdess Song of the Night at Daybreak Renouncement Maternity reprinted from POETRY without  acknowledgment these are typical and perhaps none more so than the sonnet Renouncement which is so familiar as hardly to require quotation H M  NOTES  Ernest F Fenollosa born in Salem about 1852 of a Spanish father and New England mother and dying in London in 1908 was well known in America as a man of original genius who devoted his life chiefly to the interpretation of Japanese art Called to the University of Tokio in 1878 as professor of philosophy he became the strongest influence against Japanese neglect of the national art and was appointed Commissioner of Fine Arts to the Japanese Government  The play Nishikigi or Nishikidzuka which we are fortunate in presenting was found among his notes after his death It is a flurry of snow against a red spray of maples The obscurities have been explained in the course of it the meaning of the crimson nishikigi love wands or charm sticks has become clear The hosonuno is a local cloth with this legend clinging about it The most difficult or obscure lines are in the second part where as has been indicated the chorus and the hero use speech merely to interpret the gestures of the dance which the reader must imagine for himself until he can see it perhaps in Minoru s company   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  If these notes are insufficient there is the introduction to Professor Strope s book on the Noh published by Heineman A long redaction of some of Fenollosa s notes will shortly appear in the Quarterly Review  The Noh plays in the original are part in prose and part in verse and they are part spoken and part sung The dance is of great importance  Fenollosa published in 1893 a book of poems East and West Crowell amp Co Mr Bliss Carman a Canadian by birth but a resident of the

continuation of the account in A Small Boy and Others of the early years of William and Henry James and their brothers with much about their father and their friends The story of the life in Switzerland and Geneva and later on in Newport and Cambridge tells not only their own experiences but a great deal about such men as John LaFarge Hunt Professor Norton Professor Childs and Ralph Waldo Emerson who was a close friend of Henry James Senior The description of the Civil War time and of Wilkinson James s experience with Colonel Shaw s colored regiment are particularly interesting The illustrations are from drawings made by William James in the early part of his career when he was studying to be a painter  Certainly if one were invited to name the literary masterpiece of the twentieth century one would do well to hesitate before passing further than Mr James s autobiography It is not merely that it gives us a unique analysis of everything that went to the making of a characteristic literary artist of our times It does more than this It introduces us to the most charming and wonderful family  group a novelist ever found to his hand It is a book of a warm as well as of a subtle beauty and is one of Mr James s masterpieces in characterization London Nation  A Small Boy and Others 2 50 net  There are many interesting people in this unusual book people interesting

light as I used and my thoughts grow confused I am heavier than I was Mary Mother you know the cause  Beautiful Holy Lady take my shame away from me Let this fear be only seeming let it be that I am dreaming For months I have hoped it was so now I am afraid I know Lady why should this be shame just because I haven t got his name He loved me yes Lady he did and he couldn t keep it hid We meant to marry Why did he die  That day when they told me he had gone down in the avalanche and could not be found until the snow melted in Spring I did nothing I could not cry Why should he die Why should he die and his child live His little child alive in me for my comfort No Good God for my misery I cannot face the shame to be a mother and not married and the poor child to be reviled for having no father Merciful Mother Holy Virgin take away this sin I did Let the baby not be Only take the stigma off of me  I have told no one but you Holy Mary My mother would call me whore and spit upon me the priest would have me repent and have the rest of my life spent in a convent I am no whore no bad woman he loved me and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  we were to be married I carried him always in my heart what did it matter if I gave him the least part of me too You were a virgin Holy Mother but you had a son you know there are times when a woman must give all There is some call to give and hold back nothing I swear I obeyed God then and this child who lives in me is the sign What am I saying He is dead my beautiful strong man I shall never feel him caress me again This is the only baby I shall have Oh Holy Virgin protect my little baby My little helpless baby  He will look like his father and he will be as fast a runner and as good a shot Not that he shall be no scholar neither He shall go to school in winter and learn to read and write and my father will teach him to carve so that he can make the little horses and cows and chamois out of white wood Oh no no no How can I think such things I am not good My father will have nothing to do with my boy I shall be an outcast thing Oh Mother of our Lord God be merciful take away my shame Let my body be as it was before he came No little baby for me to keep underneath my heart for those long months To live for and to get comfort from I cannot go home and tell my mother She is so hard and righteous She never loved my father and we were born for duty not for love I cannot face it Holy Mother take my baby away Take away my little baby I don t want it I can t bear it To have great poets there must be great audiences too Whitman
