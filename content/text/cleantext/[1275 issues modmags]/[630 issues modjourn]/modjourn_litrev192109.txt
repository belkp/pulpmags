their unconsciousnessand the coloursodourssounds which follow astonish usthen disappear from nature This monster of beauty is not eternalWe know that our breath has had no beginningand will have no endbut we conceive first of all the creation and the end of the worldNeverthelesstoo many artists still adore plantsstonesthe waveor menOne quickly becomes accustomed to the bondage of the mysteriousAnd this servitude ends by creating soft leisureOne allows the labourer to dominate the universeand gardeners have less respect for nature than the artistsIt is time to be the mastersGood will does not insure victory All rights reserved for all countriesincluding SwedenNorway and Russiaby Létz CourbiéreTranslated by MrsCharles Knoblauchfor the Société Anonyme7 The mortal forms of love dance on this side of eternityand the name of nature sums up their accursed discipline The flame is the symbol of paintingand the three plastic virtues radiate in burningThe flame is of a purity which tolerates nothing alienand cruelly transforms in its own image that which it touchesThe flame has a magic unity if it is dividedeach spark is like unto the single flameIt hasfinallythe sublime truth of its own lightwhich nobody can deny In spite of natural forces the virtuous artist painters of this occidental epoch contemplate their purityIt is forgetfulness after studyAndif a pure artist should ever die it would be necessary that all those of the past ages should not have existedIn the occidentpainting purifies itself with this ideal logic which the old painters have transmitted to the new as if they had given them lifeAnd that is allOne lives in delightanother in painsome devour their heritageothers become richand still others have nothing but lifeAnd that is allNo one can carry his father s body about everywhere with himHe abandons it to the company of the other deadAnd he remembers itregrets itspeaks of it with admirationAndif he becomes a father himselfhe must not expect any of his children to multiply themselves for the life of his corpseButit is in vain that our feet detach themselves from the soil which holds the dead To contemplate purity is to baptise instinctto humanize artand to deify personality8 The rootthe stalk and the flower of the lily show the progress of purity to its symbolic bloom All bodies are equal before the light and their modifications come from this luminous power which moulds them according to its willWe do not know all the coloursand each man invents new onesBut the painter mustabove allbecome himself the spectator of his own divinityand the pictures which he offers to the admiration of men will confer upon them also the glory of exercising for the moment their own divinityFor this it is necessary to embrace at a glance the pastpresent and futureThe canvas should present that essential unity which alone can produce ecstacyThennothing transient will be dashed off at randomWe will not suddenly be turning backwardsFree spectatorswe will not give up our life because of our curiosityThe salt smugglers of appearances will not be able to pass our statues of salt before the custom house of reasonWe will not go astray in the unknown futurewhichseparated from eternityis only a word designed to tempt manWe will not exhaust ourselves seizing the too fugitive presentfor fashion after all can only be for the artist the mask of death The picture will exist inevitablyThe vision will be entirecompleteand its infinityinstead of marking an imperfectionwill only bring out the relation between a new creature and a new creatoronly this and nothing moreOtherwise there will be no unityand the connection which the different points of the canvas have with different geniuseswith different objectswith different lightswill show only a multiplicity of inharmonious dissimilaritiesForif there can be an infinite number of creatureseach one attesting its creatorwith no creation to block the extent of those 9 coexistencesit is impossible to conceive of them at one and the same timeand death is the result of their juxtapositionof their minglingof their loveEach divinity creates after his own imageso toothe paintersAnd it is only photographers who manufacture reproductions of natureNeither purity nor unity count without the truthwhich cannot be compared to realitysince truth is always the sameoutside all naturewhich exerts itself to hold us within the fatal order of things wherein we are only animals Above allartists are men who wish to become inhumanThey seek painfully the traces of inhumanitytraces which are never found in natureThese are the real truthsand beyond them we know no realityBut reality is never discovered once and for allThe truth will always be newOtherwisetruth would be a system even more miserable than natureIn this casethe deplorable truthevery day more distantless distinctless realwould reduce painting to a state of plastic writing destined simply to facilitate the relations between peoples of the same raceIn our daya machine would quickly be invented which without comprehension reproduced such signsII Many of the new painters paint only pictures which have no actual subjectAnd the titles which one finds in the catalogues play merely the role of the names which designate men without characterising them10 I have seen canvases entitledSolitudewhere there were several peoplejust as there are MrStouts who are very thinand MrBlonds who are very darkIn the cases in questionthe artists even condescend occasionally to make use of vaguely explicative wordssuch as portraitlandscapestill lifemanyhoweverof the young artists use only the general termpaintingThese painterseven if they still observe natureno longer imitate herand they carefully avoid the representation of natural scenes studiously observed and reconstructedActual resemblance no longer has any importance because everything is sacrificed by the artist to the veritiesto the necessities of a superior nature which he presupposes without exposingThe subject no longer countsor if it counts at allcounts for very littleGenerally speakingmodern art repudiates most of the means of pleasing which were used by the great artists of past timesTodayas formerlythe aim of painting is still the pleasure of the eyebut the demand henceforward made upon the amateur is to find a pleasure other than the one which the spectacle of natural things could just as well provide Thus one travels towards an entirely new artwhich compared to painting as it has been looked upon heretoforeshall be what music is to literatureIt will be the essence of paintingjust as music is the essence of literatureThe amateur of music experiencesin listening to a concertjoy of a different order from the joy he feels in listening to natural soundslike the murmur of a streamthe roar of a torrentthe whistling of the wind in a forestor the harmonies of human language founded on reason and not on aestheticsIn the same waythe new painters will provide their admirers with artistic sensations due solely to the harmony of odd lights11 Everyone knows Pliny s anecdote of Appelles and ProtogenesIt demonstrates clearly the aesthetic pleasure resulting solely from this odd combination of which I have spokenAppelles landed one day on the Isle of Rhodes to see the works of Protogeneswho lived thereProtogenes was not in his studio when Appelles arrivedAn old woman was there guarding a large canvas ready to be paintedInstead of leaving his nameAppelles drew on the canvas a line so delicate that nothing subtler could be conceivedOn his return Protogenesseeing the drawn linerecognized the hand of Appellesand traced thereupon a line of another color even more subtlein such a way that there appeared to be threeAppelles came back again the next daywithout finding him whom he soughtand the subtlety of the line he drew that day reduced Protogenes to despairThis sketch was for a long time the admiration of connoisseurs who viewed it with as much pleasure as if gods and goddesses had been depicted instead of almost invisible tracings The secret aim of the young artists of the extreme schools is to produce pure paintingIt is an entirely new plastic artIt is still in its first stageand is not yet as abstract as it would like to beMost of the young painters work a great deal with mathematics without knowing itbut they have not yet abandoned nature whom they patiently question so that she may teach them the way of lifeA Picasso studies an object as a surgeon dissects a bodyThis art of pure paintingif it succeeds in disengaging itself entirely from the ancient school of paintingwill not necessarily cause such painting to disappearany more than the development of music has caused the disappearance of different kinds of literatureor than the acridity of tobacco has replaced the savour of food12 III 13 The new artists have been violently reproached for their geometric preoccupationsAnd yetgeometric figures are the essence of drawingGeometrythe science which has for its scope spaceits measurement and its relationshas been from time immemorial the rule even of paintingUp till nowthe three dimensions of the euclidean geometry have sufficed for the solicitude which the sentiment of the infinite arouses in the soul of great artistsThe new painters do not proposeany more than did the oldto be geometriciansButit may be said that geometry is to the plastic arts what grammar is to the art of the writerToday scholars no longer hold to the three dimensions of the euclidean geometriesThe painters have been led quite naturally andso to speakby intuitionto preoccupy themselvess with possible new measures of spacewhichin the language of modern studios has been designated briefly and altogether by the term the fourth dimension The fourth dimension as it is presented to the understanding from the plastic point of view would be engendered by the three known dimensionsit would show the immensity of space eternalized in every direction at a given momentIt is space itselfthe dimension of the infinite it is this which endows objects with their plasticityIt gives them the proportions which they merit as a part of the wholewhereasin Greek artfor examplea somewhat mechanical rhythm unceasingly destroys the proportionsGreek art had a purely human conception of beautyIt took man as the standard of perfectionThe art of the new painters takes the infinite universe as the idealand it is this ideal that necessitates a new measure of perfectionwhich permits the artist to give to the object proportions which conform to the degree of plasticity to which he desired to bring itNietszche divined the possibility of such an art O divine Dionysiuswhy dost thou pull my ears Ariadne demands of her philosophical lover in one of the celebrated dialogues on The Isle of Naxos I find something pleasant and agreeable in thy earsAriadneWhy are they not still longer Nietszche when he recalled this anecdote put into the mouth of Dionysius the condemnation of Greek artLet us addin order that today nothing more than an historical interest may attach to the Utopian expressionthe fourth dimension which must be noted and explainedthat it was only a manifestation of the aspirations and inquietudes of a large number of young artists contemplating the Egyptian Negro and Oceanian sculpturesmeditating on the works of scienceand awaiting a sublime artIV Wishing to attain to the proportions of the idealnot limiting themselves to humanitythe young painters offer us works which are more cerebral than sensualTo express the grandeur of metaphysical formsthey withdraw further and further from the former art of optical illusions and local proportionsThis is why the present arteven if it is not the direct emanation of determined religious beliefspresents nevertheless several characteristics of the Great Artthat is to sayof religious artV It is the social function of the great poets and the great painters to renew unceasingly the appearance which nature assumes in the eyes of menWithout the poetswithout the artistsmen would quickly tire of the monotony of natural phenomenaThe sublime idea which they have of the universe would come tumbling down with a vertiginous rapidityThe order which appears in nature and which is only an effect of art would immediately vanishEverything would break up in chaosNo more seasonsno more civilisationno more thoughtno more humanityno more of life itselfimpotent obscurity would reign foreverBy mutual consent the poets 14 and the artists determine the features of their epoch and docilely the future falls in with their planThe general structure of an Egyptian mummy conforms to the figures outlined by the Egyptian artistsand yet the ancient Egyptians differed greatly the one from the otherThey have conformed to the art of their epochTo create the illusion the type is the real quality of artits social roleGod knows how the pictures of Manet and Renoir were mockedVery wellIt suffices to cast an eye upon the photographs of their epoch to see how the people and things conform to the pictures which these great artists have paintedThe works of art beingfrom the plastic point of view the most energetic products of a periodthis illusion appears to me quite naturalThis energy imposes itself on men and is for them the plastic measure of an epochThusthose who mock the new painters make fun of their own featuresfor the people of the future will picture to themselves the human beings of today as they have been represented by the artists of the most vitalthat is to saythe newest artDo not say to me that there are today other artists who paint in such a way that mankind will recognize itself as portrayed in their imageAll the works of art of an epoch end by resembling the most expressivethe most typicalart of that periodDolls are the outlet of a popular artthey seem always to be inspired by the great art of the same epochThis is a truth easy to verifyAnd yet who would dare to say that the dolls which were sold in the bazaars about 1880 had been manufactured with a sentiment analogous to that of Renoir when he painted his portraitsThennobody noticed itIt signifiesneverthelessthat the art of Renoir was energetic enoughvital enough to impose itself on our senseswhile to the great public at the same time when he started his conceptions appeared to be mad absurditiesVI One has oftenand notably in the case of the most recent paintersbeen confronted by the possibility of a mystification or of a collective error15 But no one knowsin all the history of artof a single collective mystification any more than of a collective artistic errorThere are isolated cases of mystification and of errorbut the conventional elements of which in part the works of art are composed assure us that errors would not know how to exist collectivelyIf the new school of painting had presented us with one of these casesit would be an event so extraordinary that it could be called a miracleTo conceive a case of this sort would be to conceive that suddenlyin a nation all the children should be born without heads or with only one arm or lega conception evidently absurdThere are not collective errors or mystifications in artThere are only divers epochs divers schools of artIf the end pursued by each one is not equally elevatedequally pureall are equally respectableand according to the ideas which each has of beautyeach school of art is successively admireddespised and again admiredVII The new school of painting bears the name of Cubism it was so called in derision by Henri Matisse who in the autumn of 1908 had just seen a picture representing housesthe cubic appearance of which had greatly impressed himThese new aesthetics were first elaborated in the mind of André Derainbut the most important and audacious works which the movement at once produced were those of a great artistPablo Picassowho must also be considered as one of the foundershis inventions strengthened by the good sense of Georges Braquewho exhibited a Cubist picture in the Salon des Indépendantsas early as 1908were formulated in the studies of Jean Metzingerwho exhibited the first Cubist portraitit was minein the Salon des Indépendants of 1910Cubist works were also admitted in the same year by the Jury for the Salon d AutumneIt was also in 1910 that the pictures of Robert Delaunayof Marie Laurencin and of Le Fauconnierfollowers of the same schoolwere exhibited at the IndépendantsThe first general exhibition of Cubismwhen its adepts had 1618 reproductions of the work of Francis Picabia become more numeroustook place in 1911 at the Indépendants where Room 41reserved for the Cubistsproduced a profound impressionHere were seen the skillful and seductive works of Jean MetzingerlandscapesL homme Nu and the La femme aux Phlox by Albert Gleizesthe portrait of MmeFernande X and Les Jeunes Filles by MlleMarie LaurencinLa Tour by Robert DelaunayL Abondance by Le FauconnierNus dans un Paysage by Fernand LégerThe first foreign exhibition of the Cubists was held in Brussels in the same yearand in the preface of the catalogue to this exhibition I acceptedin the name of the exhibitorsthe appellation Cubismand CubistAt the close of the year 1911the exhibition of Cubists the Salon d Automme made a considerable noiseridicule was spared neither GleizesLa ChassePortrait of Jacques Nayralnor to MetzingerLa Femme à la Cuiller nor Fernand LégerA new painterMarcel Duchampand a

was marked by the advent of Juan GrisAt Barceloniain the month of MaySpain received the young Frenchman with enthusiasmFinally in Juneat Rouenat an exhibition organized by the society of Norman Artiststhe advent of Francis Picabia was hailed by the new school That which differentiates Cubism from the old schools of painting is that it is not an art of paintingbut an art of conception which tends to rise to that of creationIn representing the concept of realityor the created realitythe painter can give the appearance of three dimensionshe canso to speakcube itHe cannot do this in rendering simply the reality as seenunless he makes use of an illusion either in perspective or foreshortening which deforms the quality of the form conceived or created17 In Cubismas I have analyzed itfour tendencies have manifested themselvesOf which two are parallel and pureScientific cubism is one of the pure tendenciesIt is the art of painting new ensembles with elements borrowednot from the reality of visionbut from the reality of consciousnessEvery man has the perception of this inner realityIt is not necessaryfor exampleto be a man of culture to conceive of a round formThe geometrical aspect which so vividly impressed those who saw the first scientific canvases came from the fact that the essential reality was given with great purity and that the visual accidents and anecdotes had been eliminatedThe painters who follow this school arePicassoalthough his luminous art belongs also to the other pure tendency of cubism Georges BraqueMetzingerAlbert GleizesMileLaurencinand Juan GrisPhysical Cubism is the art of painting new ensembles with elements borrowed mostly from the reality of visionThis art is derivedneverthelessfrom the constructive discipline of CubismIt has a great future in the history of paintingIts social rôle is well markedbut it is not a pure artIt confuses the subject with its aspectsLe Fauconnier is the physical Cubist painter who created this tendencyOrphic Cubism is the other great tendency of Modern PaintingThe last pictures and aquarelles of Cézanne belong to Cubismbut Courbet is the father of the new paintersand André Derain to whom I shall presently returnwas the eldest of his best beloved sonsfor he originated the movement of the Fauves who were a sort of prelude to the Cubistsand he also led the great subjective movementIt would be too difficult however to write clearly today of a man who voluntarily holds himself aloof from everybody and everything The Modern School seems to me the most audacious that has ever beenIt has put the question of beauty in itselfIt wishes to visualize beauty disengaged from the pleasure which man 18 causes manandsince the dawn of historic times no European artist has dared to do thatThe new artists must have an ideal beauty which will no longer be merely the proud expression of the speciesbut the expression of the universein so far as it has been humanized in the lightIt is the art of painting new ensembles with elements not borrowed from visual realitiesbut created entirely by the artist and endowed by him with a powerful realityThe works of the Orphic Artists must present simultaneously a pure aesthetic charma construction which strikes beneath the surface and a sublime significancethat is to saythe subjectIt is pure artThe light from the works of Picasso contains this artwhich Robert Delaunay invents on his side and for which Fernand LégerFrancis Picabia and Marcel Duchamp also striveInstinctive Cubismthe art of painting new ensembles borrowed not from visual reality but from suggestions made to the artist by instinct and intuitionhas long tended to orphismThe instinctive artists lack lucidity and artistic faithInstinctive Cubism includes a very great number of artistsIt sprang from the French Impressionism and now this movement extends all over Europe The Art of today clothes its creations with an imposing and monumental aspectwhich surpasses in this respect everything that has been conceived by the artists of our ageArdent in pursuit of beautyit is nobleenergeticand the reality which it brings us is marvelously clearI love the art of today because above all else I love the lightand all men love lightabove all else Man invented fire to be concludedGUILLAUME APOLLINAIRE 19extrait de cinéma calendrier du coeur abstrait Purgatoire annouce

uglyshe was workwornShe stood looking through a crack in the barn door up at the farmhouse on the hillDorothea was deadDorotheaThe daughters would be coming up to the funeral tomorrowDorothea had slipped and fallen on the icy groundKaren had heard the doctor telling the neighbours at churchbut no daughters had come to take care of herAll the week before Dorothea died Karen was tortured with a longing to do something for herShe wished she had the courage to go to herto offer to serve herto die for herBut they were fine peoplethey had not come from her part of the countrythere was something about her that made people shun herEarly in the morning she had begun watching the house up the roadHours and hours passed and she did not moveA harsh low day outsideInside the sound of cattle chewingblowingsleepingthe smell of haywet bran and strong manureThroughts scratched across Karen s brain like long thorns or spread out thin and were nothing when she tried to hold themOnly pictures and feelings turned and turned in her mind todayShe pictured Dorothea in church the pastor saying her name twice when he spoke to her calling her FruA little flat white lacepiece on black black hairthin slant eyesdark skincheekboneslappbloodreindeer lappJewelrya carved silver scentbottleheartshaped with a crown on the topchain and ringsLong hands folded on the black dress not listening to the pastor Dorothea brooding for the old countryfilling the church with quiet broodingShe sat beside arrogant redhaired AndreasKaren did not listen to the pastor eitherIt was not like church since he had taken off his collareverything in this new country was the sameShe watched Dorotheashe could not take her eyes awayDorothea always nodded goodday to herKaren knew that it was 23 only because she was part of the old countrybut no one else ever spoke to herNo one but Dorothea longed back to the old country the way she didno one but Dorothea had refused to learn one word of englishKaren cried a little every Sunday after she had been to churchShe cried because she had worked like a manlike a slaveever since she had come to America to save enough money to go backIt had all become empty there was no one in the old country like DorotheaShe could not go nowShe would miss Dorothea too muchmiss the lace capthe black dressthe silver scentbottle women s thingsKaren couldn t remember when she had gone out to workShe had never had a woman s dress old coats of men and trousers and work thingsWork is all she had ever knownShe had come to America to work as farmhand for some old peopleThey were both dead nowShe had taken the farm over on shares and worked it aloneShe had cattle and wellmended fencesshe had even saved a little moneybut she was always workingalways aloneThere was something about her that made people shun herShe stayed on because of DorotheaHypnotisedShe loved every thing that belonged to Dorotheaher daughters that came sometimes from the city splendid proud women who laughed like strong young menThey were like their fathernot brooding like the gentle Dorotheabut they were handsome and wore beautiful clothesKaren was full of wonder that they and Dorothea and she were all womenIt grew cold and dusk in the barnKaren stamped and beat her arms across her chestbut she would not leave her place Horses across the wooden bridge of the creekhorses and a carriage from the livery in the village belowTwo women in the back seatyoungcity womenfeathers ja jaThe horses stopped at the top of the hillsome talk with the driverthen the two leapt down with one movement through the whole bodylike fish and proudly like horses they went in to the dead DorotheaKaren closed her eyes and leaned her forehead against the barn door for a long timelong after the horses had recrossed 24 the bridge a long time then in the dark she did the feeding and milkingclosed the doors tightly and went into the houseShe put the milk bucket on the tablelighted no lampbut went feeling her way into her bedroomAgain she stood a long time senseless and motionlessSlowly she sank down upon the floorstretched out along it in the dark reaching for something when she came to the bedpost she clung to it with both handsLying face downward she began to moan and repeat dully I want to be like themI want to be them In the spring Andreas walked into Karen s barnyardHe looked high into the airswept the horizon with his seaeyesstopped before the houselooked at the groundcoughed three times raising himself on to his toes each time turned and went out to his horses waiting in the roadIn two weeks he came againKaren watching from the barn knew why he had comeIt had been a mistake his coming here to this midland to farmHe had sailed the seashe could not dig in the earthThe security of the land embarrassed himHe could never admit his mistake and return to the old countryHe had got a job as road inspectorHe had men under him againHe rode about in his wagon standingbut he was impatient and ashamed of the horsesa wagon is not a shipHis farm was going to ruinHe came up to the barn and spoke to Karenasked about the roads and then about her farmtalking quicklyseeing everythingcoughing and raising himself on his tiptoes when the talk laggedThe third time he came he asked her how much money she had in the bank and then he asked her to marry himHe did not look at her and she did not look at himbut she saidyou can tell the pastor Thirteen years and Andreas was dead one morning in his bedThe daughters were coming to another funeralKaren did not try to think about itShe knew that it was useless to try to thinkEach person has only one or two thoughts one of hers had been DorotheaWhen she had married Andreas 25 it was to come into Dorothea s house to touch and to take care of her things and to be there when the daughters came to serve themShe found that they had taken Dorothea s clothes and the silver scentbottle away with them and when their father had married her they had hated him for taking anyone in their mother s place and had never come againKaren had lived here with Andreas between silences and ragesdoing all the work on the farmkeeping house for AndreasShe could not understand why everyone hated her for marrying him as the years passed people shunned her even moreShe saw no oneshe was terribly aloneThey cameThe younger came firsta widow furled in rich black silkpale and arrogant and full of hateShe went through her father s paperstook what she wanted and waitedThe other one came from a long distanceshe brought two children with herThey stayed three daysthey did not speak to Karenthey talked of their own lives when they were not talking but sitting silent feeling the years of separation between themthe older one often let the tears run down her strong facesaying aloud as if to some sick memorypoor poor dear mother They never spoke of their fatherKaren came and went getting the mealsmaking the beds and the firesShe wanted to speakto tell them somethingshe wanted to take the children in her armsThese heartless womenshe would appease them for all the years of hateShe came into the room and stoppedthey looked at her and pale spots came at either side of their nostrilsShe must speak quickly or she could never try againShe said in a low voiceI was never wife to your father They sat like granitefinally the older one tapped with her foot on floor and said SoI have heard One winter Karen was dragged by a cowNo one passed the farm for two daysthere was no way to call a doctorshe sufferedwhen a man hauling wood came along she was able to call out to himThe doctor examined her he told her she would be helpless all the rest of her lifeA niecea woman of fifty whose life had been much better than her owncame to take care of her26 This woman Ola was tender and a good nurseShe had been meant by nature to be a motherher body had a nesting expressionShe had taught in a country schoolsupporting her mother for many yearsWhen she was forty two her mother had been paralyzedOla gave up her school and moved to the city where she could get plain sewing to do at homeVery soon she met a man at church a tall blonde wheat grower from MinnesotaA man of her own agebut so full of strength and colour that he looked no more than thirtyHe fell in love with Ola the first time he saw her and she quietly knew that he was for herHe asked her to marry himpled with her to bring her mother and come with himbut she was afraid that with this burden his love might changeShe asked him to waitShe had his unquestioning unchanging love for eight yearson the day of her mother s funeral he had died of pneumoniaShe took care of Karen as she had taken care of her motherin some way it made it seem as if he were still waitingKaren had not been in bed long when Andrea s younger daughter came to the farmShe looked at Ola through narrowed eyesshe did not speakbut went in to Karen and sat beside the bedShe was very angryThe farm was now hersshe had bought the sister s shareShe wanted possessionKaren had cut down some trees to keep warm in the winterThat was not in her tenureThe tenure would be brokenShe must leaveKaren lay with her face to the wall and said nothingThe other woman taunted her about her illnessasked her why she didn t dieWhen she saw that Karen wouldn t talk she sat silent looking at the bed with narrow eyespresently in a voice smothered with hate she said If you don t go I ll have you dragged out of hereI will go to the church and tell them why you were never my father s wifeThey will come and drive you out of the country for mother s sakeYou can think it over She went awayWhen Olafrightenedcrept into the room she heard Karen sobbingShe went to her and put her hand on her shoulder KarenKaren don t crythe pastor won t let themI will tell himyour body is as white and round as a girl sYou put 27 your money in this farmyou stay here till you are through She was herself still trembling with fearPerhaps this would kill KarenIt was growing darkshe went about the night choreswhen she had finished she came inlighted a lamp and looked at the bedKaren was lying looking a long way before herher large cheekbones shone with dried tearsshe shook her head from time to time as if denying many thingsShe was not afraid of this pale woman who came to terrify herShe had come twice a year ever since her father s death spyingscenting outthreateningShe had gone further in her threatening todayKaren understood now the lies Andreas in his hurt pride must have toldBut she could not listen or care too muchthat was just life other things were troubling her she began to cry againNot till hours after did she speak to Olain the emptiness of the night she could tell it in her own

JEAN COCTEAUNOCTURNEWAS it the oysters Or the insidious Influence Of the moon Heavenly bodies In conjunction At any rate And at dawn The inexorable Dirty yellow LOUIS GILMORETHE WORK OF GERTRUDE STEIN ONE evening in the wintersome years agomy brother came to my rooms in the city of Chicago bringing with him a book by Miss Gertrude SteinThe book was calledTender Buttonsandjust at that timethere was a good deal of fuss and fun being made over it in American newspapersI had already read a book of Miss Stein s calledThree Livesand had thought it contained some of the best writing ever done by an AmericanI was curious about this new bookMy brother had been at some sort of gathering of literary people on the evening before and some one had read aloud from Miss Stein s new bookThe party had been a successAfter reading a few lines the reader stopped and was greeted by loud shouts of laughterIt was generally agreed that the author had done a thing we Americans callputting something across the meaning being that she had by a strange freakish performance 29 managed to attract attention to herselfget herself discussed in the newspapersbecome for a time a figure in our hurriedharried livesMy brotheras it turned outhad not been satisfied with the explanation of Miss Stein s work then current in America and so he boughtTender Buttonsand brought it to me and we sat for a time reading the strange sentences It gives words an oddly new intimate flavor and at the same time makes familiar words seem almost like strangersdoesn t it he saidWhat my brother didyou seewas to set my mind going on the book and thenleaving it on my tablehe went awayAnd nowafter these yearsand after having sat with Miss Stein by her own fire in the rue de Fleurus in ParisI am asked to write something by way of introduction to a new book she is about to issueAs there is in America an impression of Miss Stein s personalitynot at all true and rather foolishly romanticI would like first of all to brush that asideI had myself heard stories of a long dark room with a languid woman lying on a couchsmoking cigarettessipping absinthe perhaps and looking out upon the world with tired disdainful eyesNow and then she rolled her head slowly to one side and uttered a few wordstaken down by a secretary who approached the couch with trembling eagerness to catch the falling pearlsYou will perhaps understand something of my own surprise and delight whenafter having been fed up on such tales and rather Tom Sawyerishly hoping they might be trueI was taken to her to find instead of this languid impossibility a woman of striking vigoura subtle and powerful minda discrimination in the arts such as I have found in no other American born man or woman and a charmingly brilliant conversationalist Surprise and delight did I sayWellyou seemy feeling is something like thisSince Miss Stein s work was first brought to my attention I have been thinking of it as the most important pioneer work done in the field of letters in my timeThe loud guffaws of the general that must inevitably follow the bringing forward of more of her work do not irritate me but I would like it if writersand particularly younger writerswould come 30 to understand a little what she is trying to do and what she is in my own opinion doingMy own thought in the matter is something like this that every artist working with words as his medium must at times be profoundly irritated by what seems the limitations of his mediumWhat things does he not wish to create with wordsThere is the mind of the reader before him and he would like to create in that reader s mind a whole new world of sensationsor rather one might better say he would like to call back into life all of the dead and sleeping sensesThere is a thing one might callthe extension of the province of his artone wants to achieveOne works with words and one would like words that have a taste on the lipsthat have a perfume to the nostrilsrattling words one can throw into a box and shakemaking a sharp jingling soundwords that when seen on the printed page have a distinct arresting effect upon the eyewords that when they jump out from under the pen one may feel with the fingers as one might caress the cheeks of his belovedAnd what I think is that these books of Gertrude Stein s do in a very real sense recreate life in wordsWe writers areyou seeall in such a hurryThere are such grand things we must doFor one thing the Great American Novel must be written and there is the American or English Stage that must be uplifted by our very important contributionsto say nothing of the epic poemssonnets to my lady s eyes and what notWe are all busy getting these grand and important thoughts and emotions into the pages of printed booksAnd in the meantime the little wordsthat are the soldiers with which we great generals must make out conquestsare neglectedThere is a city of English and American words and it has been a neglected cityStrong broad shouldered wordsthat should be marching across open fields under the blue skyare clerking in little dusty drygoods storesyoung virgin words are being allowed to consort with whoreslearned words have been put to the ditch diggers tradeOnly yesterday I saw a word that once called a whole nation to arms serving in the mean capacity of advertising laundry soap31 For me the work of Gertrude Stein consists in a rebuildingan entire new recasting of lifein the city of wordsHere is one artist who has been ready to accept ridiculewho has even foregone the privilege of writing the great American noveluplifting our English speaking stage and wearing the bays of the great poets to go live among the little housekeeping wordsthe swaggering bullying street corner wordsthe honest workingmoney saving words and all the other forgotten and neglected citizens of the sacred and half forgotten cityWould it not be a lovely and charmingly ironic gesture of the gods ifin the endthe work of this artist were to prove the most lasting and important of all the word slingers of our generationSHERWOOD ANDERSONA LA NOTINIERE DEà Pierre de MassotPOURQUOI cette manie des écrivains et des journalistes

magazine which at the present moment desires to give the public the work of men whose new quests are the aim in art whether in paintingmusicsculpture or literature Little Reviewis not influenced by the present established conventions which are for the most part only commercialMost of the reviews unfortunately can not live without the help of editors and galleries who seek to make a credulous public believe that their merchandise alone is interestingthe only which really has acommercialvalueThis frightful stock jobbing in pictures permits the jobbers to put over it doesn t matter what good fellow for a person of geniuswe have had an example of this recently at the Kahnweiler sale where they pushed up the price to 18 000 francs for pictures I wouldn t have given 50 centimes forAs for cubist purismdon t let s speak of itAs I have already writtenthis cathedral has only one steeplewhich is Picassothe rest of the edifice is a shop where they should sell umbrellas and where they offer us onlyRuoltzwhich they wish to pass for real moneyThe heartbreaking thingyou seeis the thought that these imbeciles of picture merchants disgust painters with painting 42FRANCIS PICABIAand the real amateurs with buyingI prefer the dealers in antiquities who sell us interesting works at least of the epoch they represent even if they are falseWhat difference is there really between a real and a false RembrandtOnly the experts following the interest they have in them declare themgoodorbad Besidesthe works these dealers in antiquities offer us are sometimes much more modern than those shown by the merchants of so called modern artas for example the imitations of negro sculpture or the imitations of Egyptian or Byzantine artistsin fact all this paraphernalia worthy of the Grévin museumwhich has less freshness to my way of thinking than the discovery of a mummy of a Pharaoh kingTo interest us it is not enough to interpret with more or less fancy the work of a race or of a man work which is the pure expression of the needs or of the civilization of an epoch Modigliani was a charming man but he would have done better to turn to the moviesThat which I have just said to you is a part of the philosophy of Daare we not agreedmy dear ChristianThere is sometimes more art in knowing how to drink a cocktail than in knowing how to mix blue or vermillion with whitemore art in designing the practical side of an automobile than in imitating the buttocks of an Italian model of the Place Pigallemore art in constructing a motor than in copying a poilu with his twenty kilos of imbecility on his backmore art in making a watering pot than in making the portrait of an appleFinally there is more art in living without nationality than in declaring oneself Parisianas a young poet does who sometimes finds a way to defame himself before others have the fun of doing itThe fruits which grow in an orangery always smell a little of dung and never of orangeit is the same with the brainswhose

RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE THE low country of the lakes with its flowing blue watersits sunken gray and yellow earth and low skiesis beautifulyet there have been thrown down in it cities so meanso coldso dingyand so ugly that in them any beautiful object is a marvelous thingThe eyes strain away out of the cities over the waters and the still sandy marshesor turn up into the fathomless heights of the skyand again and again in springtimewhen small clusters of fruit trees and rose vines bloom here and there in the smoke with robins singing in the new sticky foliageone seeks such spectacles out to walk near themAs for the citiespolyglot peoplethey are so harshso cold and silentand so monotonous both in appearance and in their fierce activitythat among them any one only beautiful or charming becomes precious a thrilling deeda noble charactera great lovea deathless faithor even a passionate hatredor profound despairis something to set apartto cherish in the mindto hoard and loveFor they dreamthe people of those gray and far off cities by the azure floodsas all must do or diebut their dreams are not good or sweet or high or nobleOnce it was evening in winter in the city and the great blue darkness had fallen upon the low plainsthe watersand the frozen marshesthe darkness had grown gray and mistyand after thatas usual within the cityit had become deadcoldand dingy blackThe long misty streets with their feeble pale blue lamps were dingyand though many hurrying peoplerattling black gasoline motor vehiclesand broken dirty tramcars passed in themyet they remained drearyOne of the half dozen very long streets which lie across the others and meet like the spokes of a half wheelwas dark and cold when I walked into itIt had large furniture shops full of coloured lampstobacco and shoe shops well lighted up and Jewsshops with every sort of cheap glittering merchandise to catch the eyes of the crowd of stupid whites and Negroes who occupied this quarteryet it 49 seemed bleak and emptyThe people hurried along in silenceold snow lay frozen hard in the dark dirty corners and the dust was thickOver the roofs the sky seemed particularly blackfoggyand coldIt was nightNo sound except those of the vehicles flying over the rough pavementthe pounding tramcars that passedand the shoes of the hurrying peoplebut at lastat intervals above the other sounds there came what seemed to be a voice raised in shouting or speakingand on coming to a place where two mean dark side streets met I found on the pavement a short plump gentle but very earnest Negro of forty who was urging upon passers the principles of JesusteachingHe used the inflection and diction of Negroes in this part of the worldbut he was neatly dressed and wore a greatcoathis head was barefor he had placed his round black hat against an iron hydrant for the reception of coinsFour or five men who had turned aside from the main street were listening to himmorehoweverwere going into the half screened drinking places all aboutBesidesthe farther side of the street in which he stood contained a row of little dark wooden buildings that held Negro brothelsIt was a dusty winter night You mennaow the Negro was crying in a ringingpleasing voice you got to be goodYou got to do as God saysIt ain t gwine do you no good to pray to God if you don t do as He saysDon t you go to fightin and killin and gamblin and then pray to GodIt ain t gwine do you no goodFirst you got to quit yo fightinquit yo killinquit yo drinkinquit yo gamblinquit yo swarinquit yo whore mongerin God does not wish you to do these thingsThen you go to Him and prayAnd He s gwine hear what you say The utterance of these words with singular force in that stirring melodious voiceand the face and form of the little man made lovely by joyfaith and good willshone in that bleak cold streetit seemed to melike glittering gold shining from the gutter dustI drew nearer and listened to him say that he had come here because he had been bidden by God to go among men and preach the Wordnot as preached in worldly churches but as the 50 prophets of Israel and the Apostles preached it long agoMen must be truthfulkindlyabstemiousthen all would be well with themThey must understand one anothersympathize with one anotherand love one anotherThat was the WordWhen all did sothen God s kingdom would have come on earthMeantime the few who knew the truth and strove to live by it wouldeven though they were lonely and cast outbecome happystrongand courageousTheirs would be a life unattainable by the gross and carelessa life inconceivable by suchyet the life that all men really desiredthe life that was man s heritageAsideas it werefor the assurance of timid childrenhe illustrated some of the workings of God s planOnce a man had received God into his heart and was trying earnestly to live according to His willGod would not neglect or desert him either in this world or any otherHe himself was but a humble servant bidden to teach and expound the WordAnd since he strove to do thiseven though he never succeeded as he wished toyet God had blessed him forty years with health and strength and the means to live The servant am worthy of his hire God had saidyet so merciful and kind was God that Jes so long as you try the best you canHe ll stand by youMoney an things is the leastbut He ll see to them tooAh don t have to worryWhen Ah get out of money He sends me means to get someAh don t owe nobody a cent tonightcept seventy five cents fo coaland the man said thewasn t no hurry for thatbut Ah m goin to pay him tomorrow nightAnd this week Ah was down to the Boahd of Public Works and they said they d put me to work next Wednesday mornin shovellin up ashes in the alleysAh m gwine be thereSo I

beliefRapture stirring in your heartBut two city policemen come through the dark streets where the brothels aremaking their way swiftly in the gloomand they hear the preacher s voice and raise their headsThey 51 are not patrolling and have not their bludgeonsbut one immediately gives the other a package he has been carrying and hurries across the street behind the speakera short burly manpink faced and grimactive and strongwith the bold insolence and cruelty of the policeThe buttons and silver shield glitter on the breast of his clean blue greatcoatthe forepiece and shield shine on his heavy capWithout a word he takes the speaker from behind by arm and neckjerks him violently backwardchoking himand all but throws him to the pavement HereHereHere he cries What are you doing Startledthe Negro tries to keep his feet and twist his head so as to see his assailantBut he manfully seeks to explain Where s your permit asks the policeman Judge tole me Ah didn t need to have no permitGit to hell out of here The Negro is thrown forward almost to his knees and flung aboutVery firmly he declares Ah ve come here to speak the Word of the Lord like the old prophets in de BibleFolks must know thisJudge he tole me At that the policeman tightens his hold with one handstrikes him on the head with his fistand hurls him to the pavementThe second officera taller manruns inAnd the big crowd that has gathered during the few moments of parley closes about to seeAgain and again the little Negro is thrown downstruckand dragged in the dustHe gasps out his purpose as he canThe dark cold street resounds with the noise of newcomers rushing up to see in the midst are the scufflethe blowsthe Negro s voicethe dustAt lengthtossing along in the midst of the crowdthe preacher is swept round a corner and pushed and pulled along past a dark little medical schoola cross streetand a long hospital with a dimly lighted coloured statue of the Virgin aloft in a front gableOver the way are a shadowy park with bare trees and a waterless basinand beyond this some old public buildingsThe Negro s once neat clothes are twistedhalf pulled from himand covered with dust and mudhis body is beatenand his faith insultedbut in a voice grown a little hystericalchoked too by the hand of the policemanhe continues to declare his purposeThe policeman grips him from behind and rushes him alongthe 52 other follows carrying the round black hat and half entreatinghalf commanding the curious crowd to keep off and go awayThen the captive is taken round another corner and in through the dark basement door of a public buildingThe second policeman follows and closes the doorThen all go away quickly except meI wait for a timethe tallest policeman comes out and goes awayand soon afterward the burly attacker with his parcelthey hurry off as if to make up lost timeAnd after an interval the little preacher comes himselfalone and somewhat put to rightsgoes quietly back around the cornerpast the hospital and medical school and the park and on toward the corner where he was takenBut he seems to consider his work for this night donefor he does not stop but picks his way across the street of business and starts off northward as if beginning a long journeyI follow him curiously for two kilometers or morebut at lastconcluding from the way he looks about when he passes under the street lights that he suspects he is being followedI turn off and go my wayNext night he is at his corner againwith a large crowd about him this timefor it is the gay free night before the Sabbath when the people have their wages for the weekCrowds are entering and leaving the brothelsloud cheery talk sounds everywherein the dark and in the cold blue light of the street lampsand coins fall steadily into the hat by the hydrantA tall spectacled friendwell dressed in fur cap and greatcoat with fur collaraccompanies the little preacher tonight and treats him disdainfullybut just as beforewith the same bright earnestnessthe little man tells simply of hismission of God s laws and God s promisesand urges obedience to GodWithout dismayeven with some zesthe speaks of last night Let em come an git me again he says Ah ll be right backThey ll have to carry me though he adds quickly I ain t gwine to fight emThat s what makes all the troublemenfolks always a fightinYou boys he cries earnestly don t you ever go to fightindon t you ever go off to no war and kill folksIf they try to make youdon t you careLet em do what they canbut don t you careThe Lord said Don t do it He does not wish you to do itAn God ll 53 look after youJes you obey Him an don t you worry Introducing his companionhe assures his audience that this isa splendid speaker and he listens eagerly to the other s haltingpracticed Ah didn t expect to be called on to speak yeah this even and interpolates quick brightAmen s YesHe will sandBless His Name s during the exhortation that followedThat night they are not attacked or molestedBut at a gathering of Negroes on a later night I see the same brisk strange little man standing unnoticed by himself at one side of the halland I go to him and assure him of my sympathy and tell him that I was present the night he was attackedHe passes over that hastilyit was nothinghe has had many such experiencesbut when I ask him about himself he answers my questions obliginglythough with some diffidenceHe knows nothing of his parents except that before the emancipation one or both were slaves he has been taught scarcely anythingand has done hard work all his lifeIn his youth he joined a church and began to preachbut having come soon afterward to see the quality of churches and to be aware of hismission he travellednorthand began to go about working and preachingHe belongs to no church and disapproves of all alikeHe has no propertypermitting himself nothing but poverty and labourAlready he is looked down upon as improvident by those who know himHis wife has left himnot relishing her lot with himfor they were forced always to lodge in the poorest parts of the towns they visitedThe intolerance and hate of white Americans for Negro people made their lives harder than they would otherwise have beenSingle rooms near small independentmissions houses if there were any that suitedwere their temporary homesand from one such the wife went at last to visit at the town of Nashville in the distant state of Tennesseeand she has not come backHer intention to do so was vague at her departureHer husband has suffered a great deal through her desertion and has humbly and pitifully begged her by letter to returnbut he has born her failure to do so and goes on with his workHe is not lovednor even much liked by anyoneI find laterhe and his preachinghis high standardshis beliefhis self reliance and 54 fearlessnesseven his good temperseem disquieting to othersirritatinga boresomething to escapeDuring that year he remained in the city by the flood preaching and working at hard manual labourBut the next winterwell along toward the endthere was an epidemic of pneumonia and my little apostle was stricken suddenly and removed to a cheerless public hospitalTheregasping and choking so horribly that it was almost impossible to watch himhe died the night of his arrivalNothing but a rickety screen of wood and cloth separated him from a score of other sick men when he diedNext nightwashed and dressed in its usual neat clotheswith white linen and a gay coloured cravatthe beautiful plump little figure lay in a hideous black coffin with cheap white lining in the lonely gloomy little mission house that he had found somewhere off on the northern edge of the townTwo or three people watched perfunctorily by the bodybut though it was almost spring and the day had been wetthe place grew cold as the night wanedand became almost intolerably dismal and horribleThe next daywhen he was buriedwas just such another old winter dayreally a wet spring dayThe low dirty white sky was heavy with the breath of the lakesthe air was thick with rainand the filthy snow melted in corners and mingled its muddy dirty water with that which dripped in showers from the soaked and swollen black roofsThe motor vehiclestramcarsand the thousands of feet splashed the water onto the morose peoplethe buildingsand the shop windowsThe Negro s wifenot much affectedarrived from Nashville in time to attend the service at the mission house and to go in the cortege to the cemeteryI left the service earlyand riding on various trams and walking part of the timecrossed the low flat scattered city to the great out of the way cemetery off on the western edge where he was to be buriedThis tract lies beyond a vast expanse of the dirty little wooden houses of the citywhich stand wall to wall along endless monotonous streets but it lies on the bank of a little winding stream that is tributary to the great one by which the city standsHigh stone supports and black iron palings fence the great cemeterywhich stretches away out of 53 sight among poor streetsroadsfieldsand woodsLarge parts of its surface have been covered with turf or diversified by small artificial mounds and slopesbut the turf is now gray and dead the yellow sand shows through in many places and the square stonesurnspainted iron benchesand unsubstantial looking tombs that stand in clustersare tinyIn making the mounds the trunks of many of the trees were buried almost to the branchesand these trees look fatstubbyand short legged in the gray mistA heavy odour of warmsalty grease hangs in the lower aira suggestive stench from a factory for reducing fats somewhere in the neighborhoodThere are winding macadam roads through the cemeteryWhen I have waited a little while at a place which has recently been added for the graves of poor peoplethe great black motor coachsplashed with mudappears suddenly out of the city and enters one of the large stone gates at the southeastern cornerThere is a stone lodge here and a bell over the gates tolls briefly as the coach comes inThen the vehicle follows a road parallel to a lonely bare wet red paved street outsidein which long dingy trolley cars pass at intervalsand comes quickly to where I amThe sand here is entirely barethe few old forest trees are neglected and the graves lie in long close rowsThey have no stonesbut there are dead rotten flowers on some of the newestfluttering dismally from cardboard frames wound with lead foil and adorned with letters of crinkly paperSome graves have been covered with white cotton cloth fastened to the ground by pegsbut that is allRagged rotten brown leaves lie in the hollows of the sandwhere brown weeds stand and wet newspapers are blown about by the cold windIn this shabby somber place on the dun earth of the boundless lake countrybeside the harsh ugly city in which he has been an unwelcome strangerbut under the great white skytoothe body of the servant of God is to be laidThe coach stops in the muddy road and the escortall Negroes except the undertaker and his agile assistantdescend in the mistThose who are to carry the coffin gather uncertainlyand with the assistance of the undertaker and his man take it downThen an irregular procession is formedthe 56 bearers take off their hatsand slowly and stumblingly all move off up the slope on a mat of tan jute with two red stripes that has been laid on the mudand make their way among the gravesShabby ordinary people in their greatcoats and hats of different colourswith their umbrellas and rubber storm shoesno one of them is much moved as they creep with their dead man like tiny worms on the yellow sand beneath the skyWhen the poor black coffin has been put down on the canvas bands of the wooden frame around the graveall stand back quietly while something that I cannot hear at my distance is read or saidSome of the women sob out thenAnd the coffin descends slowly from sight into the damp yellow sandOut at a distance over the swampy fields beyond the streamlarge black crows flap noisily around a lone treefrom a tiny locomotive on railway trackage far away white steam rises with a faint roarThe mist in the air is rapidly turning to falling rainAfter a short pause the party straggles back to the coachsome who have started first pausing to look at the other graves and the dead flowersA few remain for a moment by the open grave looking downBut very soon all are again in their places and the coach is rolling away among the slopesIt passes out at the stone gate and back into the cityAnd then old German labourerswho have been waiting not far offapproach the grave rheumatically and set aside the few flowers that have been left on the pile of fresh sandwhich is partly covered by a green waxed cloth and evergreen branchesThey put on and screw down the lid of the new wooden overboxearth is thrown inand before the early gloomy rainy nightfall the grave of Brother Frank BurnsServant of the Lordis almost filledBut I went from the place almost unmindful of the irony of what had happenedalmost unmindful of the night and the mist and the vastness of the wet skyso touching and agitating had been that fair bright vain dreamthat pure and simple heartadvancing eagerstrongand radiant to conquer the menacing shadows of life and deathWILLIAM JITRO

RAHAB By WALDO FRANK RAHAB will undoubtedly be attacked by the critical descendants of those who reviled Walt Whitman and by those who heard nothing but dissonances in the Wagner they now acclaim as the master melodistBut for all this departure from the usualthe elemental directness of this simple taleits portrayal of varied contemporary types and of such living issues as thedouble standardand the interplay in our society of Gentile and Jewmean only that MrFrank has made his art of the common stuff of everyday American lifeIt is the sober conviction of the publishers that RAHAB is the peer
