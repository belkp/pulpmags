firs and hemlocksThe garden path struggled up to the porch between wild flowers and weedsand looming against its ancient bulk the shadows of out houses and barnsIt stood among the hillsand just below around a curve in the road lay the placid gray reservoirSometimes parties would cross the fieldswalking slowly toward the mountainsAnd sometimes children could be heard murmuring in the underbrush of things they scarcely knewStrange things had happened in this country townMurdertheftand little girls found weepingand silent morose boys scowling along in the rag weedwith half shut sunburned eyelidsThe place was wilddeserted and impossible in winterIn summer it was over run with artists and town folk with wives and babiesEvery Saturday there were fairs on the greenwhere second hand articles were sold for a songand flirting was formidable and passingThere were picnicsmountain climbingsspeeches in the town hallon the mark of the beaston sinand democracyand once in a while a lecture on something thateveryone should know attended by motherstheir offspring left with servants who knew what everyone shouldn tThen there were moviesbare legsdeaconsmisses in cascades of curls for the special pleasure of the love sick matinee idol s fingersand on Sunday one could listen to MrWiddiethe clergyman who suffered from consumptionspeak on love of one s neighborIn this house and in this town had livedfor some fifteen years or soEmma GonsbergShe was a little creaturelivelysmilingextremely good naturedShe had been married twicedivorced onceand was now a widow still in her thirties8 The Little Review Of her two husbands she seldom said anythingOnce she made the remark Only fancythey never did catch on to me at all She tried to be fashionabledid her hair in the Venetian stylewore gowns after the manner of Lady de Bathentering her carriage and tried to cultivate only those who could tell herwhere she stood Her son Oscar was fourteen or thereaboutsHe wore distinctly over decorative English clothesand remembered two words of some obscure Indian dialect that seemed to meanfleas for whenever he flung these words defiantly at visitors they would go off into peals of laughterheaded by his motherAt such times he would lower his eyes and show a row of too heavy teethEmma Gonsberg loved flowersbut could not grow themShe admired cats because there wasnothing servile about them but they would not stay with her and though she loved horses and longed to be one of those daring women who could handle themwithout being crushed in the stalls they nevertheless ignored her with calm indifferenceOf her lovespassions and effortsshe had managed to raise a few ill smelling pheasantsand had to let it go at thatIn the winter she led a lonely and discriminating lifeIn the summer her house filled with mixed charactersas one might sayA hot melancholy Jewan officer who was always upon the pointor depreciating his medals in a conceited voiceand one other who swore inoffensivelyFinally she had given this sortof thing uppartly because she had managedsoon afterto get herself entangled with a man called Ulric StraussmannA tall rough fellowwho said he came from the Tyrol a fellow without sensibilities but with a certain bitter sensualityA good natured creature as far as he wentwith vivid streaks of German lustwhich had atonce something sentimental and something careless about itthe type who can turn the countrywith a single gestureinto a brotheland makes of children strong enemiesHe showed no little audacity in putting things into people s minds that he would not do himselfThe Little Review He smelled very strongly of horsesand was proud of itHe pretended a fondness for all that goes under hide or hairbut a collie bitchknown for her gentlenesssnapped at him and bit himHe invariably carried a leather thongbraided at the base for a handleand would stand for hours talkingwith his legs apartwhirling this contrived whipand looking outof the corner of his eyes would pull his moustachewaiting to see which of the ladies would draw their feet inHe talked in a rather evenslightly nasal tonewetting his lips with a long outthrustof tonguelike an animalHis teeth were splendid and his tongue unusually redand he prided himself on these and on the calves of his legsThey were largemuscular and rather handsomeHe liked to boast that there was nothing that he could not do and be forgivenbecauseas he expressed it I have always left people satisfied If it were hate or if it were lovehe seemed to have come off with unusual success Most people are puny he would add while I am largestronghealthySolid flesh through and through whereat he would pound his chest and smileHe was new to the town and sufficiently insolent to attract attentionThere was also something childishly naive in himas there is in all tall and robust men who talk about themselvesThis probably saved himbecause when he was drinking he often became gross and insultingbut he soon put the women of the party in a good humour by giving one of them a hearty and good natured slap on the rear that she was not likely to forgetBesides this man Emma had a few old friends of the less interestingthough better readtypeAmong themhoweverwas an exceptionOliver Kahna married man with several children one heard of and never sawA strange quiet man who was always talkingHe had splendid eyes and a poor mouth very full lipsIn the beginning one surmised that he had been quite an adventurerHe had an odour about him of the rather recent cultof theterribly good He seemed to have been unkind to his family in some wayand was spending the rest of his life in a passion of regret and remorseHe had become one of those guests who are only missed when absentHe finally stayed for goodsleeping in an ante room with his boots onhis one royal habitIn the beginning Emma had liked him tremendouslyHe was atonce gentle and furiousbutof latejust prior to the Straussmann affairhe had begun to irritate herShe thought to herself he is going madthat s all She was angry at herself for sayingthat s all as if she had expected something differentmore momentuousHe had enormous appetiteshe ate like a Porthos and drank like a Pantagrueland talked hour after hour about the same thing Love of one s neighbour and spent his spare time in standing with his hands behind himin frontof the pheasantscageHe had been a snipe hunter in his timeand once wenton a big game huntbut now he said he saw something more significant hereHe hadlike all good sportsmeneven shot himself through the handbutof late he pretended that he did not remember what the scar came fromHe seemed to suffer a good dealEvil went deep and good went deep and he suffered the tortures of the damnedHe wept and laughed and ate and drank and sleptand year by year his eyes grew sweetertendererand his mouth fullermore grossThe child Oscar did not like Kahnyet sometimes he would become extraordinarily excitedtalk very fastalmost banteringlya little malignlyand once when Kahn had taken his hand he drew it away angrily Don t he said Why notBecause it is dirty he retorted maliciously As if you really knew of what I was thinking Kahn saidand put his own hands behind himEmma liked Kahnwas attached to himHe mentioned her faults without regretor reprovaland this in itself was a divine sortof loveHe would remarkWe cannot be just because we are bewildered we ought to be proud enough to welcome our enemies as judgesbut we hateand to hate is the actof the incuriousI love with The Little Review an everlasting but a changing lovebecause I know I am the wrong sortof man to be good and because I revere the shadow on the thresholdWhat shadowKahnIn one man we called it Christ it is energyfor mostof us it is deada phantomIf you have it you are Christand if you have only a little of it you are but the promise of the Messiah Theseseemed great wordsand she looked at him with a little admiring smile You make me uneasy for fear that I have not saidI love you with an everlasting love often enough to make it an actof fanaticism As for Oscarhe did what he likedwhich gave him characterbut made him difficult to live withHe was notone of thoseweedyyouthslong of legand stringy likejerked beefthank God as his mother said to visitorsHe was rather too fully grownthick of calf and hip and rather heavy of featureHis hands and feet were notoutof proportion as is usually the case with children of his agebut they were too old lookingHe did not smoke surreptitiouslyOn the contrary he had taken out a pipe one day in frontof his motherand filling itsmoked in silencenot even with a frightened airand for that matter not even with a particularly bold air he did it quite simplyas something he had finally decided to doand Emma Gonsberg had gone off to Kahn with itin a rather helpless mannerMost children swing in circles about a roomclumsilyOscar on the contrary walked into the four corners placidly and officiallylooked at the backs of the books here and a picture thereand even grunted approvingly atone or two in quite a mature mannerHe had a sweetheartand about her and his treatmentof her there were only a few of the usual signshe was shyand passionately immersed in herthere was little of the casual smartness of first calf love about itthough he did in truth wave her off with a grin if he was questioned12 The Little Review He took himself with seriousness amounting to a lack of humorand though he himself knew that he was a youthand had the earmarks of adolescence about him and know it he certainly did once he said Wellwhatof it is that any reason why I should not be serious about everything This remark had so astonished his mother that she had immediately sent for Kahn to know if he thought the child was precocious and Kahn had answered If he wereI should be better pleasedBut what is one to expectChildren he answered are never what they are supposed to beand they never have beenHe may be old for his agebut what child hasn t been In the meantimeshe tried to bring Straussmann and Kahn togetherMy house is all atodds she thoughtbut these two never hit itoffStraussmann always appeared dreadfully superficial and cynicaland Kahn dull and good about nothing They have both got abnormal appetites she thought wearilyShe listened to them trying to talk together of an evening on the piazza stepsKahn was saying You musthoweverwarn yourselfin fact I might say armyourselfagainst any sensation of pleasure in doing goodthis is very difficultI knowbut it can be attainedYou can give and forgive and tolerate gently andas one might saycasuallyuntil it s a second natureThere you have ittolerate who wants toleranceor a second natureWelllet us drop it1 feel like a childit s difficult not to feel like a childLike Oscar he has transports even at his age Emma added hesitatingly Perhaps that s not quite as it should beThe memory of growing up is worse than the fear of death Kahn remarkedand Emma sighed I don t knowthe country was made for childrenthey sayI could tell you a story about that Straussmann broke offwhistling to Oscar Shall I tell Oscar about the country and what it is really like he asked Emmaturning his headThe Little ReviewLet the boy aloneWhyover there in that small village Straussmann wentontaking Oscar by the arm It is a pretty tale I could tell youperhaps I will when you are older but don t let your mother persuade you that the country is a nicehealthfulclean placebecausemy childit s corruptWill you let the boy alone Emma criedturning very red Aheh I ll let him alone right enough but it won t make much difference you ll see he wenton There is a great deal told to children that they should not hearI ll admitbut there wasn t a thing I didn t know when I was tenIt happened one day in a hotel in Southampton a dark placegloomysmelling frightfully of mildewthe walls were damp and stainedA strange placeehto learn the delights of lovebut then our parents seldom dwell on the delightsthey are too taken up with the sordid detailsthe mere sordid detailsMy father had a great beardand I remember thinking that it would have been better if he hadn t said such thingsI wasn t much good afterwards for five or six yearsbut my sister was differentShe enjoyed it immensely and forgot all about it almost immediatelyexcepting when I reminded herGo to bedOscar Emma said abruptlyHe wentand on going up the steps he did not let his fingers trail along the spindles of the banisters with his usualEeny meeny miny mo etcEmma was a little troubled and watched him going up silentlyhardly moving his arms Children should be treated very carefullythey should know as much as possiblebut in a less superficial form than they must know laterI think a child is born corrupt and attains to decency Straussmann said grinning If you please Emma cried gaily we will talk about things we understand Kahn smiled It s beautifulreally beautiful he saidmeaning The Little Review her gaietyHe always said complimentary things about her lightness of spiritand always in an angry voice Comecomeyou are going madWhat s the good of that she saidabruptlythinkinghe is a man who has discovered himself once too oftenYou are wrongEmmaI am not worthy of madnessDon t be on your guardKahn she retortedOscar appeared before her suddenlybare footShe stared at him What is it she at last managed to ask in a faint almost suffocated voice I want to kiss you he whisperedShe moved toward him slowlywhenhalf wayhe hurried toward herseized her handkissed itand went back into the house My God she cried out He is beginning to think for himself and ran in after himShe remembered how she had talked to him the night beforeonly the night before You must love with an everlasting but a changing love and he became restless With an everlasting but a changing loveWhat do you mean by changing His palms were moistand his feet twitchedA love that takes in every detailevery element that can understand without hatingwithout distinctionI thinkWhy do you say I thinkI meanI know she answeredconfused Get that Kahn outhe s a rascal he saidabruptlygrinning What arc you sayingOscar she demandedturning cold I ll never come to your bed againtake your hands and sayOur FatherIt will be all right if you send that man packing he saidstressing the wordpacking She was very angryand half started toward the doorThen she turned back Why do you say thatOscarBecause he makes you nervous wellthen because he crouches he saw by his mother s face that she was annoyedpuzzledThe Little Review and he turned red to his ears I don t mean thatI mean he isn t goodhe s just watching for something good to happento take placehis voice trailed offand he raised his eyes solemn and full of tears to her faceShe leaned down and kissed himtucking him like alittle boyBut I m not a little boy he called out to herAnd tonight she did not come down until she thought Kahn and Straussmann had goneKahn had disappeared but Straussman had taken a turn or two about the place and was standing in the shadow of the stoop when she came out Come he said What is it that you wantI think it s religion she answered abruptly But it s probably loveLet us take a walk he suggestedThey turned in toward the shadows of the great still mountains and the denser more arrogant shadows of the out houses and barnsShe looked away into the silenceand the nightand a warm sensation as of pleasure or of something expected but intangible came over herand she wanted to laughto cryand thinking of it she knew that it was neitherShe was almost unconscious of him for a littlethinking of her sonShe raised her long silk skirts about her ankles and tramped off into the dampnessA whippoorwill was whistling off to the rightIt sounded as if he were on the fenceand Emma stopped and tried to make itoutShe took Ulric s arm presentlyand feeling his muscles swell began to think of the Bible Those who take by the sword shall die by the swordAnd those who live by the flesh shall die by the flesh She wished that she had someone she could believe inShe saw a door before her mental eyeand herself opening it and saying Now tell me thisand what it meansonly today I was thinkingthose who live by the fleshand as suddenly the door was slammed in her faceShe started back Yo u are nervous he said in a pleased whisperThe Little Review Heavy stagnant shadows sprawled in the path So many million leaves and twigs to make one dark shadow she saidand was sorry because it sounded childishly romanticquite different from what she had intendedwhat she had meantThey turned the corner of the carriage houseSomething moveda toadgray and uglybounced across her feet and into the darkness of the hedgesComing to the entrance of the barn they pausedThey could distinguish sleeping hensthe white films moving on their eyes and through a window at the backsteam rising from the dung heap There don t seem to be any real farmers left she said aloudthinking of some book she had read about the troubles of the peasants and land holders You re thinking of my country he said smiling NoI wasn t she said I was wondering what it is about the country that makes it seem so terribleIt s your being a Puritan a tight laced delightful little Puritan She winced at the wordsand decided to remain silentIt was trueStraussmann was in a fever of excitement he was always this way with womenespecially with EmmaHe tried to conceal it for the time beingthinkingrightlythat a display of it would not please her just at the momentbut it would be only a matter of minutes when she would welcome ithe promised himselfand waitedHe reflected that she would laugh at him Hut she would enjoy it just the sameThe way with all women who have had anything to do with more than one man and are not yet forty he reflected They like what they getbut they laugh at youand know you are lyingOhmy God Emma said suddenlydrawing her arm away and wiping her face with her handkerchief What s the matterNothingit s the heatIt is warm he said dismallyThe Little Review 17I despise everythingI really despise everythingbut you won t believe I mean everything when I say everythingyou ll think I mean some one thing won t you she wenton hurriedlyShe felt that she was becoming hysterical It doesn t matter he rejoinedwalking on beside herhis heart beating violently Down you dog he said aloud What is that she raised her eyes and he looked into themand they both smiled That s betterI wish I were God A desire for a vocationNot trueand horridas usual she answeredand she was hot and angry all atonceHe pulled at his moustache and sniffed I can smell the hedgesahthe country is a gay deceiver it smells pleasant enoughbut it s treacherousThe countrymy dear Emmahas done more to corrupt manto drag him downto turn him loose upon his lower instinctsthan morphinealcohol and womenThat s why I like itthat s why it s the perfect place for womenThey are devils and should be driven outand as there s more room in the country and consequently less likelihood of driving them out in too much of a hurrythere is more time for amusement He watched her outof the corner of his eye as he said these things to note if they were ill advisedThey seemed to leave her coldbut tenseA little later they passed the barns again What was that Emma asked suddenly I heard nothing But she had heard somethingand her heart beat fearfullyShe recognized Oscar s voiceShe reached up signing Straussmann to be quietShe did not want him to hear she wished that the ground would yawnwould swallow him up See that yellow flower down there she saidpointing toward the end of the path they had just come I want itI must have itplease He did as he was bidamiably enoughShe listened she heard the voice of Oscar s little sweetheart It seems as if we were one already It was highresolute18 The Little Review unflaggingwithout emotiona childish parroting of some novelOscar s voice came backhalf smothered Do you really care more than you like BerkeleyYesI do she answered in the same false treble lots moreCome here he said softlythe hay rustled I don t want tothe rye gets into my hair and spoils itDollydo you like the countryYesI do without conviction We will go to the city he answered OhOscaryou re so strong she giggledand it sent a cold shudder through Emma s beingThen presently What s the matterOscar whyyou re cryingI m not wellthen yesI am whatof ityou ll understandtoosome day She was evidently frightenedbecause she said in a somewhat loosened key No one would ever believe that we were as much in love as we arewould theyOscarNowhy do you ask thatIt s a great pity she said again with the false soundand sighed Do you careWhy do you care Straussmann was coming back with the yellow flower between thumb and forefingerEmma ran a little way to meet him Comelet us go home the other wayRatherlet us not go home he saidboldlyand took her wristhurting her Ah she said Vous m avez blessée d amour ironically Yesspeak Frenchit helps women like you at such moments he saidbrutallyand kissed herBut kissing him backshe thought The foolwhy does Oscar take her so seriously when they are both childrenand she is torturing himMy lovemy sweetmy little love he was babblingShe tried to quench thistrembling a little But tell memy friend nonot so hasty what do you think of immortality He had pushed her so far back that there was no regaining her composureThe Little ReviewMy Godin other wordswhatof the will to retribution But she could not go on I ve tried to she thoughtLaterwhen the dawn was almost upon themhe said How sad to be drunkonly to dieFor the end of all man is Fatein

found Kahn lying flaton his backhis eyes wide open Couldn t you sleepNoI could not sleep She was angry I m sorry you sufferYesa littleKahn she cried in anguishflinging herself on her knees beside him What should I have donewhat shall I do He put his hand on her cheek My dearmy dear he saidand sighed I perhaps was wrong She listened Very wrongI see it all nowI am an evil manan old and an evil beingNonoYesyes he said gentlysoftlycontradicting her Yeseviland pitiful and weak he seemed to be trying to remember something What is it that I have overlooked He asked the question in such a confused voice that she was startled Is it hate she asked I guess soyesI guess that s itKahntry to think there must be something elseMadness She began to shiver Are you coldNoit s not cold The Little ReviewNoit s not cold he repeated after her Yo u are not coldEmmayou are a child Tears began to roll down her cheeks Yes he continued sadly Yo u too will hearremorse is the medium through which the evil spirit takes possession And again he cried out in anguish But I m not superficial I may have been wantonbut I ve not been superficialI wanted to give up everythingto abandon myself to whatever I T demandedto do whatever I T directed and willedBut the terrible thing is I don t know what abandon isI don t know when it s abandon and when it s just a case of minor calculation The real abandon is not to know whether one throws oneself off a cliff or notand not to careBut I can t do itbecause I must knowbecause I m afraid if I did cast myself offI should find that I had thrown myself off the lesser thing after alland that he said in a horrified voice I could never outliveI could never have faith againAnd so it is that I shall never knowEmmaonly children and the naive knowand I am too sophisticated to accomplish the divine descentBut you must tell me she saidhurriedly What am 1 to dowhat am I to thinkMy whole future depends on thaton your answer on knowing whether I do an injustice

way of putting the sum outof mindyet I wish I might dieHow do I know now but that everything I have thoughtand saidand donehas not been falsea little abyss from which I shall crawl laughing at the evil of my own limitationBut the child what have I been telling Oscar to love with an everlasting love The Little Review 2 IThat s true he said KahnlistenWhat have I done to himwhat have I done to

changing love what kind of love is thatPerhaps that s it he criedjumping upand with a gesture tore his shirtopen at the throat LookI want you to seeI run upon the world with a bared breast but never find the blade ahthe civility of our own damnation that s the horrorA few years agosurely this could not have happenedDo you know he saidturning his eyes all hot and burning upon her the most terrible thing in the world is to bare the breast and never to feel the blade enter He buried his face in his hands ButKahnyou must thinkyou must give me an answerAll this indecision is all very well for usfor all of us who are too old to changefor all of us who can reach God through some plaything we have used as a symbolbut there s my sonwhat is he to thinkto feelhe has no jester s stick to shakenor stool

prophet you can t do less for the sign I give you I must knowI must receive an answerI will receive it He shook her off suddenlya look of fear came into his eyes Are you trying to frighten me he whisperedShe went into the hallinto the darkand did not know whyor understand anythingHer mind was on fireand it was consuming things that were strange and merciful and preciousFinally she went into her son s room and stood before his bed22 The Little Review He lay with one feverish cheek against a dirty handhis knees drawn uphis mouth had a peculiar look of surprise about itShe bent downcalled

cheekAn ague shook his limbsShe brought her face close to his Sonhate toothat is inevitable irrevocable He putout his two hands and pushed them against her breast and in a subdued voice said go awaygo away and he looked as if he were about to crybut he did not cryShe turned and fled into the hallHoweverin the morningat breakfastthere was nothing unusual about herbut a tired softness and yielding of spirit and at dinnerwhich was always lateshe feltonly a weary indifference when she saw Straussmann coming up the walkHe had a red and white handkerchief about his throatand she thoughthow comic he looksGood evening he said Good evening she answeredand a touch of her old gaiety came into her voiceKahn was already seatedand now she motioned Straussmann to followShe began slicing the cold potted

but clean hitting proseUniversitaire economics hold the field as non experimental science and Catholicism held the fields in Bacon s day and in Voltaire sand I have no doubt that the opposition to Major Douglasstatements will take the tack of making him out a mere LutherHumanism came to the surface in the renaissance and the succeeding centuries have labourednot always in vainto crush it downLe style c est l homeand a chinaman has written A man s character is known from his brush strokes The clarity of some of Major Douglasstatements should show the more intelligent readerand show him almost instantlythat he has here to deal with a genius as valid in its own specialty as any we can point to in the artsWhat we all have to facewhat Douglas is combatting is a claim for the complete subjugation of the individual to an objective which is externally imposed on him which it is not necessary or even desirable that he should understand in full The Little Review 41 It is impossible to condense Douglasarguments into the scope of a reviewone can at most indicate his main tendencies and the temper and tonality of his mindHe is humanistwhich is a blessed relief after humanitarianshe is emphatically and repeatedly against thedemand to subordinate the individuality to the need of some external organizationthe exaltation of the State into an authority from which there is no appealCentralisation is the way to do itbut is neither the correct method of deciding what to do nor of selecting the individual who is to do it He is realist in his perception that the concentration of credit capital into a few hands means the concentration of directive power into those same few handsand thatcurrent methods of finance far from offering maximum distribution are decreasingly capable of meeting any requirements of society fully Sentences and definitions apart from context may sound like sentences from any other book on economicsit is in the underflow of protest against the wastage of human beings that we find the author s true motive powerHis new declaration of independence is perhaps compressed into a few paragraphssic The administration of real capitaliethe power to draw on the collective potential capacity to do workis clearly subject to the control of its owners through the agency of creditReal credit is a measure of the reserve of energy belonging to a community and in consequence drafts on this reserve should be accounted for by a financial system which reflects that factIt must be perfectly obvious to anyone who seriously considers the matter that the State should lendnot borrow in this respect as in others the Capitalist usurps the function of the State The argument for remedying present conditions is closely wovenconviction or doubt must be based on the author s text itself and noton summary indicationsThere is exposure of industrial sabotagesuggestion for a new and The Little Review just mode of estimating real costsattack upon thecreation and approximation of credits at the expense of the community All of which isfor the readeran old story or a new story or a fatras of technical jargonaccording as the reader has read many books or no books on economicsor is capable or incapable of close thought but whatever elsewhatever mental stimulus or detailed economic conviction the book conveysany reader of intelligence must be

prevention of new warswars blown up outof economic villainies at the whim and instigation of small bodies of irresponsible individualsIn this Major Douglas must command the unqualified respectof all save those few cliques of the irresponsible and the economically guiltySo much for the book s characteras for the intellectual detailsone can only add one s personal approbation for what it may or may not be worth one has at least honest thinkingno festoons of ecclesiastical verbiageno weak arguments covered with sentimental ism no appeals to thetrend of events no pretense that mankind is not what it is but what itought to beAll of which is a comfortThe political issue in these matters is perfectly clearnotonly in England but in everycivilisedcountryit consists in dividing society at a level just below the great banks and controllers of loan creditie along the line of real interestIn England at this moment the whole of political jugglery is expended upon an effort to divide society just above the Trade Unoinsthe poor old fashioned trade unions which are plunder associations too naive to survive keen analysisDouglasbook offers an alternative to bloody and violent revolutionsand mighton that account be more welcomed than it will bebut perspicacity is not given to all menand many have in abuleia gone to their doomThe work is radical in the true sensetrenchant but without a

andlast but not leaston the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the storm tossed heartof manMarystar of the seaThe three girl friends were seated on the rocksenjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chillyMany a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat and discuss matters feminineCissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffreytwo little curly headed boysdressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name HMSBelle Isle printed on bothFor Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twinsscarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about themThey were dabbling in the sand with their spades and bucketsbuilding castles as children door playing with their big coloured ballhappy as the day was longAnd Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delightHe was but eleven months and nine days old andthough still a tiny toddlerwas just beginning to lisp his first babish wordsCissy Caffrey bentover him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chinThe little Review NowbabyCissy

spoilt beauties was Cissy CaffreyA truer hearted girl never drew the breath of lifealways with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lipsa girl lovable in the extremeAnd Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brotherBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master JackyBoys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this ruleThe apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it rightor wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower hadBut if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too andtrue to the maxim that every little Irishman s house is his castlehe fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the would be assailant came to grief andalas to relate the coveted castle tooNeedless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends

near her companionslost in thoughtgazing far away in to the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to seeShe was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her thoughas folks folks often saidshe was more a Giltrap than a MacDowellHer figure was slight and graceful inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good and she was much better of those discharges she used to getThe waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purityHer hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bedBertha Supple told thatonce to Edy Boardman when she was black out with Gertythe girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the restof mortalsand she told her not to leton whatever she did that it was her that told her or she d

her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to herMayhap it was thisthe love that might have beenthat lent to her softly featured face at whiles a looktense with suppressed meaningthat impatted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyesa charm few could resistWh y have woman sucheyes of witcheryGerty s were of the bluest Irish bluesetoff by lustrous lashes and dark expressive browsTime was when those brows were not so silkily seductiveIt was Madame Vera Veritydirectress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess novelettewho had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyesso becoming in leaders of fashionand she had never regretted itBut Gerty s crowning glory was her wealth of hairIt was dark brown with a natural wave in itShe had cut it that very morning on accountof the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clustersAnd just now at Edy s words as a telltale flushdelicate as the faintest rosebloomcrept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness thatof surety God s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equalFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyesShe was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongueInclination prompted her to speak outdignity told her to be silentThe pretty lips pouted a while but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morningShe knew right wellno one betterwhat made squinty Edy say thatAs per usual somebody s nose was outof joint about the boy that had the bicycle always riding up and down in frontof her windowOnly now his father kept him in the evenings Studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on The Little Review and he was going to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother WEWylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college universityLittle recked he perhaps for what she feltthat dull ache in her heart sometimespiercing to the coreYet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in timeThey were protestants in his family andof courseGerty knew Who came first and after Him the blessed virgin and then saint JosephBut he was undeniably handsome and he was what he lookedevery inch a gentleman the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn t go and ride up and down in frontof her bitof a gardenGerty was dressed simply but with instinctive taste for she felt that there was just a might that he might be outA neat blouse of electric blueselftinted by dolly dyeswith a smart vee opening and kerchief pocketin which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sitand a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed of her slim graceful figure to perfectionShe wore a coquettish wide leaved hatof nigger straw with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow to toneAll Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery s summer salesthe very it slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a pennyShe did it up all by herself and tried iton then smiling back at her lovely reflection in the mirror and when she put iton the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine outof some people she knewHer shoes were the newest thing in footwearEdy Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like Gerty McDowell a five and never would ash oak or elmwith patent toecaps and justone smart buckleHer wellturned ankle displayed its proportions beneath her skirt and The Little Review just the proper amount and no more of her shapely leg encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter topsAs for undies they were Gerty s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeenthough Gerty would never see seventeen againcan find it in his heart to blame herShe had four dinky setsthree articles and nighties extraand each set slotted with different coloured ribbonsrosepinkpale bluemauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn t trust those washerwoman as far as she d see them scorching the thingsShe was wearing the blue for luckher own colour and the lucky colour too for a bride to have a bitof blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps she might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and loversmeetings if you put those things on inside out so long as it wasn tof a FridayAnd yet and yetA gnawing sorrow is there all the timeHer very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in her own familiar chamber where she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsThe paly lightof evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistfulGerty MacDowell yearns in vainYesshe had known from the first that it was not to beHe was too young to understandHe would not believe in loveThe nightof the party long ago in Stoers he was still in short trouserswhen they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lipsHe called her little one and half kissed herthe first but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshmentsImpetuous fellowStrength of character had never been Reggy Wylie s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among menBut waitingalways waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be overNo prince charming is The Little Review 49 her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet faceperhaps his hair slightly flecked with greyand who would understandtake her in his sheltering armsstrain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kissFor such a one she yearns this balmy summer eveWith all the heartof her she longs to be his onlyhis affianced bride for riches for poor in sickness in health till death us two part from this to this day forwardAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to beThen they could talk about herBertha Supple tooand Edythe spitfirebecause she would be twentytwo in NovemberShe would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of homeynessHer griddlecakes and queen Ann s pudding had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a firedredge in the fine flour and always stir in the same direction then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs and they would have a nice drawing room with pictures and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery s summer sales like they have in rich housesHe would be tallshe had always admired tall men for a husbandwith glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and every morning they would both have brekky for their own two selves and before he wentout to business he would give her a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyesEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes and so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good and not to fightBut Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball his ball and he pranced on the groundif you pleaseThe temper of himOhe was a man already was little

since I saw you lastNow I am back at the yellow place by the sand reachA hand reached up outof the ground before me and lifted the lids of my eyesI have become an old man with small brittle bonesThe chill of many dawns is in the hair of my headThe sandy place where I have taken a fancy to write words with a dull stick is cut and crossed with yellow streaksThere has been a floodThe waters have been my friend they have run over the sandwiping my words awayThe words have escaped into the grassI shall never find the lost wordsThere was a word whose legs became blackHe danced drearily back and forth on the sand and screamed like a woman in travailI should have forgotten the screaming of women but for the dancing wordIt was night and I went into the mountainsThen I remembered that the valley of the Mississippi River is a flat place between the breasts of my motherThat realization gave me unspeakable joyMy mother s head lies far to the north in a grey silenceI have climbed upon the nipple of one of my mother s breastsThe Little Review 59 Since I was herein the days you have forgottenI have come into the wonder of sightIt is morning and a hush had come over the valleyI am weary but that is of no importanceDo not shake the branches of the grass as I speak to you of my adventureThe millions of men and women who live in the valley of the Mississippi River had run out into the plainsThat was at the beginning of eveningThey had come running swiftly into a close place into the center of a bowlAll men and all women and children were there they had come outof the towns outof citiesoutof alleyways in the cities outof houses in townsFarmers had quit milking cows to come into the plainsThey had given over the planting and the raking of fieldsMen had come running out at the door ways of factoriesWomen with hanging heads and stooped shoulders had comeChildren had come laughing but had stopped laughing to stand quietly in the crowdunderstanding more than their eldersEveryone stood quite stillIt was the time for my word to be heardI saton the nipple of my mother s breast and looked outover the plainsI tried to say the word but my tongue became dry and hard like a stone Now I thought the word that has never come to me will find lodgmenton my lipsThere will come a word outof the cellar of my beingMy word will rise slowly creeping toward my tongue and my lipsMy word will rattle and reverberate along the rafters of my being Nothing happened at allOn the vast plains there was only a tense silenceI came down from my high place down from the nipple of my mother s breastI went within myself as a tired man at evening might go in at The Little Review 60 the door of his houseInside myself all was silenceDust sifted down through the room of my houseMy dead tongue was a stone rolled against the doorway of myselfI took the stone in my hand and threw it away out through a windowOn the vast plains of the Mississippi Valley an army is standingIt has said no wordNo word has been said to itThe army is silentIt is a host without numbersIt is a host without bannersIt is a naked host that has staring eyesIt is a host that stands stillNo winds blow on the plainsI have just come from there and it is evening and quietSilently stands the hoststaring with calm eyes into the NorthI will take you there if to go falls within the province of your desiresYou also shall sit upon the nipple of my mother s breast and look outover the hostYou shall sit beside me while night and the shadows of death play over the hostYou shall look into my mother s eyesFar into the North you shall lookThe eyes of my mother are openThey are like a sea filled with saltShadows flitover the balls of her eyesThe little shadows of men chase each other over the quiet eyes of my mother that are hidden away in the silence far to the NorthDo not shake the branches of the grass as I speak to you of my adventureYour eyes arc very grey and large and roundI have come down from the nipple of my mother s breastI write with a blunt stick in the sand at the edge of the flowing watersI shall run on many nights through the townsI shall run on many nights through the citiesI shall run on many
