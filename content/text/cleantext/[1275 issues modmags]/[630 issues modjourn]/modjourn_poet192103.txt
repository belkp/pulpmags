windows on the upper one a fourth Looks towards the north I am very simple and mild I am very gentle and sad and old I have stood too long The Tree I am the great Tree over above this House  I resemble The drawing of a child Drawing just a tree The child draws Me Heavy leaves old branches old knots   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I am more old than the house is old I have known nights so cold I used to tremble For the sap was frozen in my branches And the mouse That stored her nuts in my knot holes died I am strong Now Let a storm come wild Over the Sussex Wold I no longer fear it I have stood too long  The Nightingale I am the Nightingale The summer through I sit In the great tree watching the house and throw jewels  over it There is no one watching but I no other soul to waken Echoes in this valley night  The Unborn Son of the House You are mistaken I am the Son of the House That shall have silver limbs and clean straight haunches Lean hips clean lips and a tongue of gold That shall inherit A golden voice and waken A whole world s wonder  The Nightingale Young blood You are right So you and I only Listen and watch and waken Under The stars of the night   The Dog of the House You are mistaken This house stands lonely Let but a sound sound in the seven acres that surround Their sleeping house And I seeming to sleep shall awaken Let but a mouse Creep in the bracken I seeming to drowse I shall hearken Let but a shadow darken Their threshold let but a finger Lie long or linger Holding their latch I am their Dog And I watch I am just Dog And being His hound I lie All night with my head on my paws Watchful and whist  The Nightingale So you and I and their Son and I Watch alone under the stars of the sky  The Cat of the House I am the Cat And you lie I am the Atheist All laws I coldly despise I have yellow eyes I am the Cat on the Mat the child draws When it first has a pencil to use  The Milch goat I am the Goat I give milk The Cat of the House I muse   Over the hearth with my minishing eyes Until after The last coal dies Every tunnel of the mouse Every channel of the cricket I have smelt I have felt  The secret shifting of the mouldered rafter And heard Every bird in the thicket I see You Nightingale up in your tree  The Nightingale The night takes a turn towards cold  ness the stars Waver and shake Truly more wake More thoughts are afloat More folk are afoot than I knew  The Milch goat I even I am the Goat Cat of the House Enough of your stuff of dust and of  mud I born of a race of strange things Of deserts great temples great kings In the hot sands where the nightingale never sings Old he gods of ingle and hearth Young she gods of fur and of silk Not the mud of the earth   Are the things that I dream of  The Milch goat Tibby Tab more than you deem of I dream of when chewing the cud For my milk Who was born Of a Nan with one horn and a liking for gin In the backyard of an inn A child of Original Sin With a fleece of spun silk And two horns in the bud I made in the image of Pan With my corrugate vicious cocked horn Now make milk for a child yet unborn That s a come down And you with your mouse colored ruff Discoursing your stuff of a dream Sell your birthright for cream And bolt from a cuff or a frown That s a come down So let be That s enough  The House The top star of the Plough now mounts Up to his highest place The dace Hang silent in the pool The night is cool Before the dawn Behind the blind Dies down the one thin candle Our harried man   My lease of a life long Master Studies against disaster Gropes for some handle Against too heavy Fate pores over his accounts Studying into the morn For the sake of his child unborn  The Unborn Son of the House The vibrant notes of the  spheres Thin sifting sounds of the dew I hear The mist on the meres Rising I hear So here s To a lad shall be lusty and bold With a voice and a heart ringing true To a house of a livelier hue  The House That is true I have stood here too long and grown old  Himself What is the matter with the wicks What on earth s the matter with the wax The candle wastes in the draught The blind s worn thin Thirty four and four ten And ten are forty nine And twenty pun twelve and six was all I made by the clover It s a month since I laughed I have given up wine And then The Income Tax   The Dog of the House The mare s got out of the stable  The Cat of the House She s able over and over To push up the stable latch Over and over again You would say she s a witch With a spite on our Man  The Milch goat Heu Did you see how she ran She s after the clover she s over the ditch Doing more harm than a dozen of goats When there s no one to watch Yet she is the sober old mare with her skin full of oats Whereas we get dry bracken and heather Snatching now and then a scrap of old leather Or half an old tin As the price of original sin  Himself I shall live to sell The clock from the hall I shall have to pawn my old Dad s watch Or fell The last old oak or sell half the stock Or all Or the oak chest out of the hall One or the other or all God it is hell to be poor For ever and ever keeping the Wolf from the door  The Cat of the House Wouldn t you say That Something heavy and furry and grey Was sniffing round the door Wouldn t you say   Skinny fingers stretching from the thicket Felt for the latch of the wicket  Himself You would almost say These blows were repercussions Of an avenging Fate But how have we earned them The sparks that fell on the cornricks and burned them Still in the ear  And all the set backs of the year Frost drought and demurrage The tiles blown half off the roof What is it what is it all for Chastisement of pride I swear we have no pride W e ride Behind an old mare with a flea bitten hide Or over much love for a year old bride But it s your duty to love your bride  But still All the sows that died And the cows all going off milk The cream coming out under proof The hens giving over laying The bullocks straying Getting pounded over the hill It used to be something cold feet going over The front of a trench after Stand to at four But these other things God how they make you blench Aye these are the pip squeaks that call for Four in the morning courage    May you never know my wench That s asleep up the stair  Herself in her sleep I ll have a kitchen all white tiles And a dairy all marble the shelves and the floor And a larder cream white and full of air I ll have whitewood kegs for the flour And blackwood kegs for the rice and barley And silvery jugs for the milk and cream O glorious Me And hour by hour by hour by hour On piles of cushions from hearth to door I ll sit sewing my silken seams I ll sit dreaming my silver dreams With a little mettlesome brown legged Charley To leave his ploys and come to my knee And question how God can be Three in One And One in Three And all the day and all the day Nothing but hoys for my dearest one And no care at all but to kiss and twine And nought to contrive for but ploys and play For my son my son my son my son Only at nine With the dinner finished the men at their wine And the girls in the parlor at forfeits for toffee I ll make such after dinner coffee But it s all like a dream  Himself If Dixon could pay But he never will   He promised to do it yesterday But poor old Dicky s  been through the mill And it s late it s too late to sit railing at Fate He d pay if he could but he s got his fix on Yet If he could pay God It would carry us over the day Of Herself  The Clock in the Room I am the Clock on the Shelf  Is Was Is Was Too late Because Too late Because One  Two  Three  Four  Himself Just over The Day and a week or two more And we d maybe get through Not with a hell of a lot Of margin to spare But just through  The Clock in the Hall One  Two One Two As your hours pass I re cord them Though you waste them Or have stored them ALL One Two Three Four Begun Half through   Let be No more at all I am the Great Clock in the Hall  Himself It is four by the clock The creak of the stair Might waken Herself It would give her a shock If I went up the stair I will doze in the chair  The House Sad Sad Poor lad I am getting to talk like the clock Year after year Shock after shock Sunlight and starlight moonlight and shadows I ve seen him sit on his three legged stool And heard him whimper going to school But he s paid all the debts that a proper lad owes Stoutly enough You might call me a clock With a face of old brick work instead of the brass Of a dial For I mark the generations as they pass Generation on generation Passing like shadows over the dial To triumph or trial Over the grass round the paths till they lie all  Silent under the grass Himself And it isn t as if we courted the slap up people    The House Now does he remember the night when he came from the station In Flood year December  Himself Or kicked our slippers over the steeple Or leaving the whites ate only the yolk We re such simple folk With an old house Just any old house Only she s clean you won t find a flea or a louse We ve a few old cows Just any old cows No champion short horns with fabulous yields Two or three good fields And the old mare going blinder and blinder And too much Care to ride behind her The House I d like him to remember There were floods out far and wide And that was my last night of pride With all my windows blazing across the tide I wish he would remember Himself Just to get through keeping a stiff upper lip Just through With my lamb unshorn So that she mayn t like me be torn by care It s not Such a hell of a lot Just till the child is born You d think God you d think They could let us little people creep Past in the shadows    But the sea s too deep Not to sink Not sink Just to get through Christ I can t keep It s too deep   The Cat of the House He has fallen asleep Up onto his knee I shall sleep in the pink  The House You see His mind turns to me As soon as he sleeps For he called me a ship On my last day of pride And he dreams of me now as a ship As I looked in the days of my pride Then he was driving his guests from the station And the floods were wide All over the countryside All my windows lit up and wide And blazing like torches down a tide Over the waters   The Mare From the cloverfield That wouldn t be me When I was young I lived in Dover In Kent by the sea So he didn t drive me When I was young I went much faster Over the sticks as slick as a hare With a gunner officer for a master And I took officers out to lunch With their doxies to Folkestone It wouldn t be me  The Milch goat Munch munch Munch munch   In the Master s clover But poor old Me The Unborn Son of the House Malodorous Image of Sinwith a Beard  It is time I was heard The House That Christmas night Son of the House It would have to be Christmas  With floods so they missed Mass   The House Your Dad s never missed Mass At Christmas So all my windows blazing with light Called out Welcome across the night And the Master s voice came over to me The poor old shanty looks just like a ship Lit up and sailing across the sea That was my lad And another just as young and as glad As they used to be all before the war Said And all of her lamps have all their wicks on That would be Dickson   Son of the House My mother when her pains have loosed  her And I am grown to man s estate Shall go in gold and filagree And I ll be king and have a king s glory   The Rooster Kickeriko Kickerikee I am the Rooster Son of the House The Dad with no hair on his pate Reading my story    Ford Madox Hueffer  The Rooster I am the Bird of the Dawn calling the world to arouse I even I am the cock of the house  The Skylark Time I was up in the sky It is time for the dew to dry I am the Bird of the Dawn  The Nightingale Time I was down on my nest The moon has gone down in the west Day folk goodbye  The House dog Here s our young maid What a yawn  The Milch goat The houseboy is crossing the lawn Under the fir Will he give me a Swede That s the thing I most need  The House What a stir What a stir Did you ever All of a sudden it s day With its tumult and fever I must have nodded away  The Drake I am the Drake I m the Drake We too have been all night awake But making no fuss not one of the seven of us For our heads were far under our legs Drinking the dregs of the lake Therefore my ladies lay eggs Ducksegg green  The Maid Where have you hid The copper lid   Where on earth have you been  Where on earth is it hidden Houseboy I didn t Maid You did Houseboy I didn t I never Maid I see you Houseboy You never Maid How on earth can I ever  Cook the pigs food if I can t find the lid Of the copper Houseboy You whopper I never Touched the old lid of your copper Maid The lid s lying out in the midden Himself must have took it Houseboy So there then Give over  Maid Did you ever What next  Our Master s asleep in his chair  I ll wager you never a leg he s stirred  Since four of the clock with the cat

receipt in ink for Herself Calling from upper window Charley The mare s in the clover   Making for the barley  She s knocking down the sticks   Himself It s over We re over this terrible fix For a quarter or so  Herself And we were in such a terrible fix And you never let me know Himself Not quite enough to take to drink for To Houseboy Fetch the mare from the barley You d better   Herself Oh Charley Himself I said Not quite enough to take to drink for It was like being master of a ship Watching a grey torpedo slip Through waves all green It would have been And all one s folk aboard Herself Yourself Yourself You ll surely now afford Yourself a new coat And a proper chain and collar for the goat Himself Good Lord Yourself Yourself You may go to town And see a show there are five or six on And you can have the little new gown You said you d fix on Herself But O Yourself we can t afford it Himself You ve not had a jaunt since the honeymoon Thirteen months and a day And very soon    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The Unborn Son of the House I shall so pronk it and king it and lord it Over the sunshine and under the moon   Himself If Fate be kind and do not frown And do not smite us knee and hip This poor old patched up thing of a ship May take us yet over fields all green And you be a little dimity queen   Son of the House As the years roll on and the days go by I shall grow and grow in majesty Herself You always say I ve no majesty Not even enough for a cobbler s queen The House By and by They ll be talking of copper roofs for the stye The Pigs W e were wondering when you would come to the Pigs Yet they say it s we that pay the rent  Himself Great golden ships in ancient rigs Went sailing under the firmament And still sail under the sky and away Tall ships and small And great ships sink and no soul to say But God being good in the last resort I will bring our cockle shell into port In a land locked bay And no more go sailing at all  Herself Kind God We are safe for a year and a day And he is so skilful my lord and my master   So skilled to keep us all from disaster Such a clever kindly Working One That I ll yet have my dairy with slabs of marble A sweet briar thicket where sweet birds warble And an ordered life in a household whereof he Most shall praise the nine o clock coffee And a little mettlesome brown kneed One To lie on my heart when the long day s done   Rooster Pullets go in run out of the sun He s climbing high and the hayseed s dun I am the Rooster with marvelous legs Pullets run nestwards and lay your eggs  Herself For my son my son my son my son  EPILOGUE  The House Itself I am their House I resemble The drawing of a child Drawing just a house a child draws one like me With a stye beside it maybe or a willow tree Or aspens that tremble That s as may be   But all the other houses of all nations Grand or simple in country or town All all the houses standing beneath the sky Shall have very much the same fate as I They shall see the pressing of generations On the heels of generations   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Shall bear with folly shall house melancholy At seasons dark and holy shall be hung with holly On given days they shall have the blinds drawn down And so pass into the hands Houses and lands into the hands Of new generations These shall remain For a short space or a long Masterful cautious or strong Confident or overbold But at last all strong hands falter Frosts come great winds and drought The tiles blow loose the steps wear out The rain Percolates down by the rafter Their youths wear out Until maybe they become very gentle and mild For certain they shall become very gentle and old Having stood too long And so all over again The circle comes round Over and over again And If You rise on this earth a thousand years after I have fallen to the ground Your fate shall be the same Only the name Shall alter Ford Madox Hueffer   EIDOLON  Of what use are windows  I have seen too much  Of what use are the shapes of my illusion  I have called things by too many names  These curtains I will draw  These candles I will extinguish  One moon or two moons  It makes no matter  There is neither saffron nor samite  Nor the whiteness of dead hands  Of what use compassion Of what use these candles by the face of darkness Pity me not for I am pitiless The image you would have me break We dreamed  Leslie Nelson Jennings   TWO POEMS  DEATH IN THE SUN  A warm gold shining world A whispering laughing world  You would not think that Death stands there in the sun Leaning against the posts of the red brick house Leaning across the bright brass knocker and knob and bell  A warm gold shining world And crocuses up in the lawn  If Death were not so thin Like air or water or gas He would darken the smooth white door He would stain the little square gleaming window lights dull  gray But he is so clear and thin That they glitter and sparkle and live   She was young and her cheeks were red She was young and loved laughing and gossip She wore coral color and sapphire and violet And hats with feathers that knew how to trick you to star  ing And shoes high heeled quick dainty She did not think much She was gay No one will say She is dead   The crocuses out in the lawn White and purple and orange candles Windless and warm and safe Burn the brown soil with beauty   No one will say She is dead Yet Death stands there in the sun  APOLOGY  Now you are ugly You are old And you are poorer than a stone And you are strong but glacier cold And you are kind but dead alone  And you what children never came To dance like brooks across your heart And you what trumpetings of fame Blew by and left you locked apart  Courageous traitor masked in steel How can you ache so and yet live While I though stars and sun may reel I have had all that life could give  Oh do not hate me Should I too Be Dearth s straight lipped proud body slave Forgive me when you stare me through For never needing to be brave

my lips  Your breath between them slips My ears awake Fair noises take  Ah all of me unites And wraps round thy delights  God take my hand  And understand I cannot pay the lovely gift I am adrift  My tearful eyes In spite of all the light they would Devise  Betray my laughing lips  Where thankful utterance trips Yet for your sake The gift I take  Take but can give no grace Here in my lonely place   A PRAYER  Love us Lord but not too much Come thou near yet not too near All thy laughing splendor spoils  What we daily see and fear What we bear and do and touch Love us still but not too much  Come thou near Lord not too near Let us breathe thee through our lips Even now I saw thy hue  In the maple s yellow tips When a leaf so gay so dear Fell but come thou not more near  Let us breathe thee through our lips Do thou enter in our eyes Touch us that we not forget  Make us simple still and wise Circling us thy finger slips Let us breathe thee through our lips  Jessie MacDonald   THREE POEMS  MARCH WIND  The moody wind is this its grudge day Whoo  Against the dusty sky in the late sun A veering flock of mottled pigeons bounce From the shoulders of a gust In our village street The captious wind runs races with itself As a dog pursues its tail with brute persistence It buffets leafless elm and maple bough Tears at the stiff armed oak  From the window pane Little Fred looks for his father he grew tired Of playing outdoors with so rude a comrade For the wind hustles keeps on pushing people Makes the street a barrier to neighboring houses Besieges timid folk  Now the reddish sun Abandons the world to the wind In alien twilight He whistles at keyhole hisses at the window Makes all the timbers groan exults cuwooff  Our lamplight in the kitchen shudders staggers As Burton blows in from the writhing darkness And sets both knee and shoulder to the door To force it shut   Hooray I want my supper Good thing the trees are rooted How the draught Reddens the stovepipe  Supper chat is over I look out clouds are hurrying past the stars I listen to the rising talk of the wind Puff pant moan roar and wail It flaps and tugs At fence and gate it throws a wooden bench Tumbling along the yard I ask myself Has the wind any grudge against our house  At bed time it still rages In the night I lie and hear the creature wiff cuwooff Rattling the sashes bruising on the gable The budding twigs of the elm  I move to the window My husband sleeps as men who labor sleep And Fred and Jimmie both lie full of sleep Little Mabel stirs is it that nerves of women Respond to the nerves of storms Cuwiff cuwooff  Unquiet stars Dim leafless shapes of elm Beating the dark between me and the stars Twisted at jerked at strained to the inmost heart Surging at the roots moaning in the angry wind  Why should this monster need the help of night The rushing presence with invisible bulk   Has laid a heaving shoulder to my house The timbers strain walls quiver my heart shakes  A thump a crash on the roof the bouncing slide Of a brick a dozen bricks  O Burton say It s got the chimney Bring the boys down cellar I m afraid of the wind in such a night Come Mabel I ll wrap you in this quilt  Cuwiff Cuwoofï  WHISPERING OFTEN  When sunlight marries the swaying branches  With shadowy dancings the rite is said To the crooning of easeful winds and waters Whispering often I love you I love you  Now in wedded lilies the juices bubble And saps make music about the heart With flower on flower the spring is yearning For the Easter of love the sacrament of love The passion of the earth and the passion of the sky Whispering often I love you I love you   HOME  Good bye to riding the wilderness With my thoughts for company  To the old new bed on the prairie grass A saddle to pillow me  I will build me a house in the April sun On my little garden ground My hand shall shape the rafter and beam My hammer stroke shall sound  For a house is a house and home is home The roots of the soul go deep And I own the boards and the rusting nails As I own my tears and my sleep  Good bye to riding the wilderness I build in the April sun Good bye to the land of the lonely sky My homeless days are done  Edwin Ford Piper  COMMENT  THEIR WIDE RANGE  POETRY has seldom referred editorially to its current contents preferring to leave the poems to make their own appeal to each individual reader But this month we are moved to emphasize the contrast between Mr Hueffer s poem in this number and a poem of the wilderness by Lew Sarett which will be printed in April and incidentally to urge appreciative consideration of the wide range covered by modern poets the variety of mood and manner in which they present to the world of today and tomorrow their interpretations of life  Mr Hueffer s is an indoor poem Its little ancient manor house mossy and vine clad among its gardens and meadows venerable with family and neighborhood traditions reaching back for centuries is beautiful with the piteous beauty of the old things things outworn and outgrown but lingering in their old place and holding human beings captive to their moss covered walls We shall not venture to suggest how far the poet typified the present situation of Old England by his ancient house a house so dear to all who have received it from their ancestors that the removal of a single tuft of moss would be a desecration and yet so shabbily inadequate to modern needs that the people fondly clinging to it are enslaved to debt and held to a narrow acreage and outlook and thereby impaired in power The implications of Mr Hueffer s poem are both obvious and profound and   the intelligent reader will not limit them to old England or even to old New England  Mr Sarett s poem challenges civilization from the opposite angle from the high vantage ground of the wilderness as readers of his Chippewa monologues in POETRY and in his book Many Many Moons will suspect In the new poem The Box of God his old Indian converted by the glitter and glamour of the high altar in the little outpost mission church electing to stay a good Catholic in that sheltering box of God but missing even unto death the wilder freedom of his old beliefs and customs in him we see a personification of something bold and splendid in humanity which civilization destroys a stark spiritual individualism which cannot exist in crowds which demands the sterner substance to be wrung from nature s free spaces and from scantly peopled tribal barbarism  We confess a certain pride in offering these two poems to our readers poems in which the challenge the eternal question is symbolically presented according to the muse s unalterable laws not prosaically stated and argued And this leads perhaps to that larger pride referred to above pride in the wide range covered by modern poetry especially poetry in the English language in its sympathetic response to the period the human group and the locale many different groups and locales Modern poetry is telling the tale of the tribe for the next age and telling it sometimes in forms of such authoritative beauty that the next age will be compelled to listen   This variety this wide range of modern poetry in English is more noticeable at present in the United States than anywhere else Kipling widened the English literary empire enormously in his day opened up India to the occidental imagination uttering at least a few questions from the Orient But today in spite of the War British poets cling more and more to the woods and meadows the customs and traditions of their tight little island hesitating to follow their flag into the far flung provinces of its empire or to face the future with its problems material and spiritual for both the individual and the crowd And the poets of Australia South Africa New Zealand who will doubtless have their day sometime have scarcely begun to be articulate  But here in the United States the poets are certainly speaking out their minds and challenging the traditional forms with new experiments whatever the future may say of the results of the ferment Extravagance and overemphasis may be found among them no doubt but even those who shout instead of sing cannot be accused of that deadliest of vices insincerity The locale from New England to Arizona is demanding its distinctive place speaking with its own voice from the aboriginal to the supersophisticated There is hardly a problem social or spiritual which is not the chief concern of some group of poets even though it leads them outside of the legitimate confines of their art to the pulpit or the soap box or lecture hall platform of reform Nor are our poets daunted by old inhibitions and taboos already a few have given us free   verse lyrics as beautiful as any old songs in rhyme already we have hints of a truly modern poetic drama as Mr Schneider points out in another page of this number And we of the Middle west have at least one poet of epic imagination for Edgar Lee Masters would set forth on his immense canvas a census spiritual taken of our America showing  The closeness of one life however humble With every life upon this globe  Whatever exceptions may be taken in predicting the quality of the ultimate harvest the most exacting critic must admit a rich growth According to the Mercure de France  Il est évident que les Etats Unis entrent résolument dans l Assemblée des Muses avec une merveilleuse offrande de poésie  H M  THAMES MORASSES  I have just destroyed the article of which the above title remains the reader s time is worth something The situation reduces itself to this Paris is or at any rate feels as if it were annoyed that civilization has been held up for five years It contains the still respectable figure of Anatole France apologizing for the bêtises which he has written during the late excitement It contains a certain number of solid and respectable people like Salomon Reinach who go down to the Academy and the Institute and discuss problems connected with literature and scholarship with   at least a certain serious decency It contains Marcel Proust and a scattering of mentally active younger authors among them Cocteau Morand Aragon Cendrars Soupault and certain perhaps static poets like Cros and Vlaminck when he lays down his paint brush  I return to London and am immersed in the aroma of death Mr Gosse was at any rate a genuine antimacassar of the antimacassar period but to no such aureate earth is turned that one needs commend the prolongation of his intellectual obsequies as in the London Mercury founded apparently for that purpose alone  Britain is not annoyed at the suspension of civilization Officially the recognized organs of Britain s literature desire literature as it was before Flaubert which is just as intelligent as to desire science as it was before Pasteur and Curie A dead language is still almost ubiquitous in the verse of the Georgian poets From various corners various established saving your reverence they are called critics continue to commend works whose titles and authors they will have forgotten in ten months time Owen Seaman from the camouflage of Punch humor has unfalteringly praised the worst for twenty years and to let this type of person speak for itself I turn to Mr Lucas  One of the most satisfactory things about literary England today is the revival of its journalism  Unfortunately Mr Lucas statement is correct anyone searching for anything better than journalism in this island will find not satisfaction but dissatisfaction and that of   no moderate nature Their journalism satisfies Mr Lucas but that is no reason why an intelligent foreigner should waste his time on current English productions The faked highbrow side of their journalism is a buffoonery a general commendation of the indifferent an aversion from the precise word a hatred of investigation a dislike of exact valuation As for the rest of it a trace of cockney sarcasm in a two penny comic London Opinion is the sole healthy symptom I have seen since my return from the continent Verbatim  We beg to suggest that the circulation of London Opinion is seven times as great as that of any other purely comic journal except the Daily Mail Any proof to the contrary will be ignored  This paragraph I may point out is not so important a piece of work as Julien Benda s Belphégor but it is the most serious piece of definitely English criticism of the Englische Zeitgeist Anno Domini 1920 that I have found in the last six months  Ten years ago I should have advised and did advise other American writers to come to England for the sake of their work at the present moment there is no literary reason for my not leaving the country  The news of literary London in the sense of news of a London interested in literature not in journalism is and has been for months perfectly well known in America Henry James is dead Hardy is one hundred and ten W  H Hudson is not very active Mr Yeats has retired to Oxford Mr Hueffer to Sussex Mr Eliot wastes his time   in a bank Mr Lewis is painting Mr Lytton Strachey is writing the life of Queen Victoria Mr Frederic Manning is doing a biography of an official person of no interest whatever and may sometime finish his romance begun in or about 1911 Mr Kipling is contributing to the Anglo French review Mr Lennox Robinson Irish has written a play which is said to be entertaining Mr Bottomley is writing in the Sunday Illustrated to controvert the Poet Laureate Mr H G Wells has written a history of the world in I think shilling parts illustrated with baroque and marvellous fantasy Mr Austin Harrison edits the English Review to suit himself a feat which would be remarkable in no other country save England but is here highly commendable his sole competitor in this line being that Fighting Téméraire A R Orage whose paper deals chiefly with economics but stands rigidly for free speech on all topics As for the rest of the periodic productions the back files for 1895 are probably quite as instructive certainly as modern and very possibly more entertaining than those bearing deceptive indications of the year current  The intellectual curiosity of this island is nil The desire for more precise ideation for better prose for international standards is zero and the young American who wants external stimulant for his thought would do better to turn his attention to Paris despite the fact that the actual study of his own language can not be continued in that city and that the study of his own language is of inestimable importance   But in the choice of evils it would be better that our American prose should run to gallicisms if so it might be supple and sensitive better even that it contract a certain eccentricity if there come with this a capacity for precise rendering of the image than that it should fall into lignifications of phrase as in pre Flaubertian English into the traps of British academic thought pomposity Spectator Times Lit Sup solemnity the cradle of the balanced sentence and all this other fustian which is so adequately interpreted to mean that any proof to the contrary will be ignored  The rhetoricians ruined the empire and the Georgians finished the Asquith administration and England of course must be let to do as she likes but there is no reason for our being implicated in the débâcle of her intellect and of her literature Ezra Pound  REVIEWS  KORAL GRISAILLE  Kara in Hell Improvisations by William Carlos Williams  Four Seas Co  Patience rather than any other attribute has become the needful luggage of him who journeys through the chronicles of this day  The human being is at his best a creature full of curiosity We wish to know why we are as we are and how the thing we call our modern world has come to be So   we read the modern world s literature and we are about as near a solution of the problem as were ever the book and thought lovers of any other day which is saying but little and yet all What beyond this is there to say Nothing remains but elaboration  Often it is not only the lack of patience but also the slippery unsatisfactory combination of book and moment that prevents us from the entirely generous and relaxed attention which such a work as Kara in Hell requires  Just why these Improvisations are likable is difficult to say The book holds many sadnesses and bitternesses between its covers and certain of them once discovered find for themselves congenial nooks and resting places in the mind  William Carlos Williams leads us gently not always gently by the hand to nowhere in particular Of course it is easy enough to slip a hand out of a hand a simple matter but involved here and there with little wishes and preferences There is an elusive charm about the way in which the sadnesses and bitternesses are disclosed Even though at conception they must have leaned with all their powerful weight upon the pen of their translator his chosen words which contain and impart them flip and flick and dance and dart about so that the image of Mr Williams in his sadness creating his word impressions becomes curiously that of a dancer waving a spotted scarf  Perhaps it is partly the very positive veiling of thought that is so agreeable when coupled with the certainty that   soon a note will relieve the tension and tell the tale But that the pleasurable sensation one must admit in reading the book should rest entirely upon this psychological prop is obviously absurd One must not go too far It is only one among several small frail apologies I might proffer in explanation of my own liking for and interest in Mr Williams experiment in delicately insulting macabre grisaille  The plainly worded fact I am coming to slowly enough and now and then plucking a wayside weed as I travel is that I find this work sad and beautiful and very much akin to the rambling but honest way of my own observing sense  So many little things so many so many and but an hour s reflection When a butterfly wing moves in the sunshine it is not easy to catch the pattern among the colors but the thing is real enough all the time Improvisations are butterfly nets but notes are drops of chloroform After that one not only sees one knows  There is a genial and sweet simplicity in the form Go as far as you will with the music and damn the public There s the business of the notes for certain people Always some dull wits even among those who pay for their seats  I still say there is a colossali nice simplicity about it and that the change of tonality is utterly agreeable  There are things to be taken from Kora in Hell Improvisations Even after but half a reading it has been   possible to go on about this book rather eagerly and that in itself is almost an introduction to its strong personality a personality with a sense of something partly eastern about it but why a flavor of the Orient must cling mysteriously to all writings that conform to a semi regular change of pitch is unexplained Perhaps it is that the far extremes of pure lightness and seriousness are so commonly the possession of the Oriental and so rarely ours  Helen Birch Bartlett  CRUCIBLE  Sun up by Lola Ridge B W Huebsch  The words of Lola Ridge are thrust into the turmoil of today s city like darting flames they are a curse and a cry of revolt  Emily Dickinson meant poetical solitude she meant thinking solitude of a poetic kind Chinese daintiness at times Adelaide Crapsey meant sadness sweet sadness sometimes rebellion too but a sweet sad rebellion Amy Lowell means voluminous and disorderly culture wordiness exaggeration which words may all go under a heading that would comprehend the case of most women artists weakness But as for Lola Ridge to fit her case no diminutive adjective could serve It is not a case of sweetness nor of any of those qualities which up to date have been said to pertain to women writers She is a poet that s all  Talk of propaganda here I wish every poet had something as strong and virile to uphold It is not a matter   of politics it s a matter of such damning hatred and love as would turn a modern city to ashes Virile it may be an insult to use that adjective since Lola Ridge has begun an era in which for a woman to be virile i e masculine might mean to be weaker  I think she is one of the most beautiful signs we have of woman s emancipation and independence Let her be a socialist this rebellion of hers is pure beauty it is sanctified it is nothing less than burning human blood it is no longer that particular fact of the revolt against actual social conditions which is unfortunately what affects today s socialists and anarchists it is an eternal thing the thing that caused Prometheus to be bound it s the fire of heaven burning in this wonderful woman s blood  Her words are so intensely vivid they are so palpable so physically tangible that they whip or stab they hurt there is a ghastliness here caused by an excess of pain and sorrow And it is her integrity of impulse and emotion that makes her shun more elaborate rhythm forms for a perfectly simple and equal one although her rhythmical sense is richer than that of certain poets who discover forms as one finds mushrooms after a rain  Sun up is a rhythmical story of the fantastic realism of a child She too is a singer of delicacies she too utters sweet words or sweet sad words The poet of Sun up is a child in all its sweetness besides being a child in all the fulness of its sometimes quaint sometimes ironic sometimes portentous magic   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He will scream into the sky And sparks will fly out of him He will burn and burn And his blazing hair Shall light up the world  It is a woman suffering but with no subdued sorrow with the snarl of a lioness rather It is a lioness flinging herself madly against the walls of the ugly city  Emanuel Carnevali  EVELYN SCOTT  Precipitations by Evelyn Scott Nicholas L Brown  I shall not forget the sensation something like the suppressed excitement that you feel at the first inkling of some momentous event with which I first read some of these poems This must be fully two years ago when some of us were working over a belated issue of Others and Evelyn Scott was still a mystery woman in far away Brazil  The union of strongly contrasting qualities that I then found in her work is emphasized in the present collection The clear searching vision like an electric ray that seems to focus almost lovingly upon decay and death with a child s simplicity and eager response to every mood of earth It is a child s wishful hands that reach out to  A little white thistle moon Blown across the frozen heather  and a child s quick open eyed wonder in these lines from Winter Dawn   Evelyn Scott  Snow maiden lets down her hair And in one shining silence It slips to earth  Evelyn Scott s happiest in the literal sense reactions are to nature though even then it is a nature already touched with decay We are shown the stars like jaded dancing girls their faces Pale in the harshness of the sunlight and over many of the vivid pictures pours silvery wonder of a decadent moon a moon that  Reaches long white shivering fingers Into the bowels of men Her tender superfluous probing into all that pollutes Is like the immodesty of the mad  And when Mrs Scott s vision turns upon humans it becomes that of a ruthless eye which sees through rosy and gracious contours to the putrescence behind an eye avid searching throwing a gold harsh light on life  Life the sleep walker  Lifts toward the skies  An immense gesture of indecency  Most of these poems are short The eye is a continually shifting ray that penetrates impartially lights up whatever shape be it swathed in bandages or merely coquetting behind veils that hovers a moment and is gone leaving the conception to be completed or explained in the mind of the recipient Sometimes as in Man Dying on a Cross it uncovers a terrible beauty that throws out a flame like burning flesh a flame that dies out swiftly as with a great breath that blows in the eyes a live and silvery dust and leaves in the nostrils a smell sweetish faintly foul   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Fortunately this vision does not see too much nor does it stray from the spot that is the centre of the flung ray Thus there is economy of detail and we are not confused with a flickering and broken image The method is at its best in the clean muscular beauty of Young Men  Fauns Eternal pagans Beautiful and obscene Leaping through the streets With a flicker of hoofs And a flash of tails  You want dryads And they give you prostitutes Occasionally however this concentration invites its penalty and there is a lack of fluidity that is not so much stiffness as a halting movement that suggests the slight lameness of a beautiful body Sometimes too an abrupt indifference to finish perhaps something of that same refusal to chasten and refine which is manifest to life itself Thus in three otherwise fine lines the words drifts and melts following in succession are left like grit under the  teeth The golden snow of the stars Drifts in mounds of light Melts against the hot sides of the city  These poems show an astonishing and essentially modern awareness an awareness that has nothing to do with sophistication you might as well call a vulture sophisticated because it sensed its prey while patiently circling overhead It is rather a consciousness that while close to and keenly   aware of instinct has yet obtained its release so that it watches intent but calmly elect impartial appraiser of its own pleasure and its own pain This consciousness knows fear the while it walks intrepidly forward to the pit and casts a stone at the coiled terrors within But the fear walks unashamed and does not cloak itself in cynicism or that chain armor of the weak a sneer There is no sneer even in the devastating lines of Christians and Women that I am sorry I have not space to quote It seems to be that the experiencing mind with an almost machine like accuracy records its inevitable emotion The result is convincing You do not question the data of this uncloistered spirit You accept the authenticity of its emotional responses even though they may not tally with your own  And while it is difficult to say how this book with its avoidance of the typical and absence of corroborated emotions as well as its rejection of the anaemic doctrine of escape may be received it introduces a new and potent force into American literature Lola Ridge  GREGORIAN ELIZABETHAN  Caius Gracchus by Odin Gregory Boni amp Liveright  Theodore Dreiser Richard Le Gallienne and Benjamin de Casseres have given considerable aid and comfort to the publisher of Caius Gracchus by blowing his horn for him with a gusto and an abandon that the biggest lunged blurber might envy   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Dreiser contributes a sincere almost pious preface which nevertheless reveals to me a painfully naïve judgment Le Gallienne a eulogy characteristically worded Here the impossible has been done and done wondrous well and de Casseres brings Shakespeare and Juvenal into his toot  After such ardors to come to the truth of the matter is to take a precipitous tumble To say that Shakespeare s name has been taken in vain that every claim Dreiser makes in the preface is circumstantially refuted in the text that Le Gallienne s impossible has certainly not been done by Odin Gregory all this is not enough First of all what is the impossible Apparently it is a recrudescence of Elizabethan drama and Dreiser forgets The Cenci in his ruthless elimination of all the attempts preceding Mr Gregory s Apparently it has often been tried this impossible and one feels at the basis of all this praise a unanimous agreement that the trial is worth making and that its success would be a millennial affair  It is fortunate that the Bible is a holy book and that religious sentiment has held it sacrosanct and prevented sentimental people from yearning for new bibles and ambitious men of the word from writing them In spite of this we have had Al Coran and the Book of Mormon and in a more important inverted sense the scriptures of Friedrich Nietzsche  One wishes that some similar mystic injunction had saved us from the neo Homeric epics and neo Elizabethan tragedies that demonstrate anew in every decade the in   Gregorian Elizabethan  violability of old civilizations for the epic and the Shakespearean drama are not methods of writing that can be applied to our own purposes but separate cultures and the attempt at re creation is a vain futility So in our own day John G Neihardt s epics have been wistfully oblivious failures and Mr Gregory s poetic drama is a noisily self conscious failure  Mr Gregory s theme is a moving episode from Roman history that one is sorry Shakespeare passed over He has turned it into unrelieved melodrama His characters which in Plutarch are among the most powerful and interesting in that collection of ancient worthies and which certainly offered Mr Gregory prodigal opportunities for characterization are crude masks His verse is strident his metaphors are pompous and in some places pretty badly mixed but not without a certain strength when they are not the product of subconscious borrowings And his purpose in spite of the absolving preface is an obvious parallelism between the evils of our day and of days past with the unexpressed but attendant homily How far Mr Gregory is from Shakespeare may be demonstrated by one vivid similarity Caius Gracchus with the wily tribune Drusus following him on the platform addresses a Roman mob Immediately one thinks of Brutus and wily Antony and that other Roman mob There is an infinity between the two  The failure was to be anticipated Mr Le Gallienne s impossible remains impossible But does that argue despair of a poetic drama No What it does mean is that a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  poetic drama is not to be created by the short cut of copying the Elizabethan It means that if we are to have it at all it is to come from what is stirring in our own life from equipment and tools that are natural to our hands  It is undeniable that the epic has been absorbed by the novel Poetry has been denuded to its fundamentals It has become predominantly lyric and philosophical Our poetic drama must evolve from that to my mind it is evolving The Aria da Capo of Edna St Vincent Millay the disturbingly beautiful discussions by Maxwell Bodenheim predicating new dramatic values the stark originality of Wallace Stevens achievements the lilting monotones of Alfred Kreymborg s mime plays these are prototypes of a poetic drama which I believe will attain a transcending power and beauty Nor must we forget Synge and Yeats and Dunsany who have marked a transition Mr Gregory s play is an experiment behind it was the same faith that motivated alchemy the desire to get gold without digging for it These others while individually distinctive achievements are in the larger view experiments also gathering up the data from which our poetic drama is to be built  In conclusion I wish to digress upon another but I believe interesting detail The publishers of this book are known as enterprising people who have got surprising returns from fields other publishers have neglected One feels that Caius Gracchus was published in the belief that a large public could be found for it among the self conscious proletariat who are the only growing class of book   Gregorian Elizabethan  buyers Mr Gregory s book being earnest and showing a firm knowledge of the subject should find its public there But the implication I am interested in is that here are publishers who dare to sell their poetry in open competition with fiction and literature of more general interest Artistically the result has been poor but what may come of it is a matter for pleasant and fearsome speculation Isidor Schneider  PROPHET OR POET  Europe A Book for America by Samuel Roth Boni amp  Liveright  This book is a prophecy not in the sense in which the average twentieth century church goer steeped in the Puritan tradition views prophecy but as prophecy was understood in the days when the Hebrew prophets lived As the prophets of those days were primarily forth tellers interpreters of their day so is Mr Roth primarily an interpreter of his day As they incidentally foretold the future so does Mr Roth endeavor incidentally to foretell a future for the present world This future he sees in America  Appearing in the role of prophet Mr Roth must be judged by its standards validity and vision being the determining factors In his interpretations Mr Roth is ahead of the mob but not far enough ahead to be a major prophet of this day He sees America making earth a worthy habitation for mankind a greater work than the glory of writing operas and poems which might be said   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  by any competent Sunday school teacher or chamber ofcommerce speaker Watch Russia and you will know what will happen next in Europe is scarcely more illuminating The author s evident disillusionment is an effective feature of his interpretations  In his manner Mr Roth essays the stateliness the grandeur the denunciatory power of the prophets of ancient times and his eloquent fervor brings him closer to the achievement of their mood and mode than any other present day writer  Russia will lean against you and level you to the mires of Danzig The great bear will put his lips to your breasts and suck you dry The swift rider of the Steppes will put his sabre clean through your  forehead  England is a hawk who has built many nests in the fields and valleys of the earth She has strong wings and she glides through the warm zones and through the cold The air trembles at the approach of her terrible wings  Occasionally one meets passages that suggest descent from Whitman rather than the Hebrews  The poem which seems perhaps the most characteristic in the volume illustrates Mr Roth s strength and weakness in both interpretation and manner  There is a light wherever you go  Woodrow Wilson President of the United States There is a light over your collected speeches to Congress And a light over your dense history of these states  You are really an awkward fellow But the light in your path is sure as the light in the pathways of old  Aeneas   The next future of the world will be in America  It requires an extraordinary lyric passion to fuse the prophetic and the poetic function for one is primarily ethical the other esthetic They do not fuse here Mr Roth is more a poet than a prophet but he over burdens his muse in such work as this and his message becomes oratory rather than poetry Nelson Antrim Craivford  A NEW ENGLANDER  The Township Line by Albert Frederick Wilson Harper  amp Bros  These poems of New England plain and common seem to hang upon that country and its people as if the poet were afraid of guesswork and of romance and of color either in the land or in the spirit There are certain things which he has undertaken not to talk about as his New Englanders do with their list of things they have to live without But he has replaced these things on his index with talk of men s opinions Plows and The South Pasture Lot are editorial tracts Waiting for the Real estate Man is a shift at the tear pump such as Amy Lowell turns to every now and then and so much is barred or denied that Barn Fire even seems an accident the best poem in this book and among the two or three best I have read from his country  We do not tell the truth About New England We love it beyond stark eyes   believe that this very consciousness that other people have exaggerated or romanced has led him to this determination to say no more than he knows to distrust his imagination for fear it may cheat him  Woodrow Wilson by this poet in POETRY for September may be a sign that he has learned or remembered better It is worth less to repeat what men say than to show what they are and if a man s writing is worth anything his imagination is worth more the last thing and maybe the only thing that is new and that we can take his word for H L Davis  ROBERT BRIDGES ONCE MORE  October and Other Poems by Robert Bridges Knopf  England s laureates seem to feel obliged to spend part of their verse on patriotism and perhaps that obligation goes with the job Robert Bridges has undertaken it dutifully that is all Such a man can not hold a passion in common with so many people he writes it out like a lesson  His first book was The Growth of Love and from that to October his verse has kept to its own banks He owes nothing to the immense alteration in English poetry effect and intention which have come in since Even the passion of love was a little bookish and cautious in him from the start maybe because it seemed overly common maybe because he used it only as a symbol for passion in thought for which Narcissus and The Philosopher and His Love have found a more exact symbol   Madest escape in life desirous To embroider her thin spun robe  He seems scarcely to care sometimes as if assured of an exact correspondence between words and his thoughts so October and In der Fremde and The Flowering Tree are too sweet and not wilful enough Or else I got used to their beauty from other poems a long time ago and take these without feeling any new presence H L Davis  A CRITIC OF POETRY  The Sacred Wood by T S Eliot Methuen London  Alfred A Knopf New York  In view of the hostility to criticism which is characteristic of some American writers is it not paradoxical that an American poet should publish in London the most stimulating and thoughtful book of criticism of the year  Probably one of the most vicious and stupid ideas of psuedo criticism one of the most destructive of healthy creative impulses is the error that art or literature is a matter of mere fashion The assumption is that a generation is interested ought to be interested in the literature of that generation that all other literature is dead and hampering On the other hand is the pedagogical point of view which accepts the past and is utterly blind to the present Mr Eliot s essay Tradition and the Individual Talent defines carefully his own correct position unaffected by either the journalistic or the pedagogical error Let us hear him speak   If the only form of tradition of handing down consisted in following the ways of the immediate generation before us in a blind or timid adherence to its successes tradition should positively be discouraged Tradition is a matter of much wider significance It cannot be inherited and if you want it you must obtain it by great labor It involves in the first place the historical sense which we may call nearly indispensable to anyone who would continue to be a poet beyond his twenty fifth year and the historical sense involves a perception not only of the pastness of the past but of its presence the historical sense compels a man to write not merely with his own generation in his bones but with a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has a simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order The historical sense which is a sense of the timeless as well as of the temporal and of the timeless and the temporal together is what makes a writer traditional And it is at the same time what makes a writer most acutely conscious of his place in time of his contemporaneity  How true that is how just Those few sentences are at once a statement of an artistic truth and the dispeller of a multitude of errors and heresies I am tempted to say that no critic since Matthew Arnold has written in English with quite this serene profundity this power of rightly directing a considerable culture to the literary problems of the present It is perhaps an unique experience in the life of this generation to find that we possess a critic of Mr Eliot s intelligence a critic with principles not impressions a critic whose perceptions have been stimulated by the best literature of the past whose appreciation of the present is equally keen and just a critic without fads personal vanity or affectation A critic who has read the books he criticises  The only qualifications I would make are these sometimes his phraseology is a little too abstract sometimes he   uses words with a restricted meaning which is not always clear to the reader For example he makes a sharp distinction between emotions and feelings The dictionary says that emotions are simply feelings of greater intensity whereas I suspect Mr Eliot means emotions and sensations or sensory reactions Again in a very slight degree he tends to take the opinion of distinguished contemporaries instead of investigating for himself  Let us turn again to the essay on Tradition where almost every page will stimulate the modern writer even more than the student of literature The following remarks are worth the most serious attention  What happens when a new work is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art which preceded it The existing monuments form an ideal order among themselves which is modified by the introduction of the new the really new work of art among them The existing order is complete before the new work arrives for order to persist after the supervention of novelty the whole existing order must be if ever so slightly altered  Now that is a critical idea of the first importance it comes from a manifestly superior mind An idea like that so luminous so harmonizing so infinitely fertile is as important as Taine s theory for example that Men write their deepest tendencies in the works of their imagination as Byron prefigured his conduct at Missolonghi by the actions of Lara and the Corsair see Julien Benda s Introduction à La Vie de Rancé I do not mean that it is the same idea but an idea equally perhaps more fertile and original one which once thoroughly grasped must modify and order our conceptions of literature   Order that is what makes Mr Eliot s critical work  so precious to us today he has imposed an order on our  chaos our intellectual anarchy he throws us a plank as  we drown in a sea of platitudes and foaming stupidities  His criticism is sane without being dull or imitative orig  inal without eccentricities profound without obscurity cul  tured without affectation vigorous without being super  ficial Richard Aldington AUSTRALIAN AND U S COPYRIGHTS  A poet in Launceston Tasmania sends this letter  Dear POETRY I am sure that the question of fair and equal treatment for Australian and American authors under the copyright laws is of interest to you This is the situation at present  U S A authors can secure imperial including Australian copyright by newly publishing exposing for sale a copy or copies of the American edition of the work simultaneously in Britain and America Britain means any British Dominion and simultaneously means within fourteen days To obtain U S A copyright however British including Australian authors must set up print and bind their work or an edition of the same in the United States simultaneously with its first publication elsewhere  That is loaded on the American side with almost impossible conditions for an Australian poet Perhaps Dennis who exploits the Australian slanguage in verse would find it worth while to set up an American edition but no other Australian verse writer would If one should write a Spoon River Anthology before he knew it was worth while the American copyright would be lost If say two years were allowed in which to set up and publish an American edition the Australian poet who found his book had an American sale would have a chance to protect his work  Unless the American conditions are modified the Australian laws will be brought into line That will hit very hard all poets but best sellers like Harold Bell Wright will not be affected and they will find it pays to print an edition in Australia  H W Stewart  NOTES  Mr Ford Madox Hueffer of London has appeared often in POETRY

claims much of the best experimental poetry written by Americans in the past eight years They have succeeded in their primary design to create a poetry which should be American in thought feeling subject and form That is after all a distinct achievement  The Chicago Evening Post in commenting on POETRY S eighth birthday said  No editorship is infallible but it is rather interesting and enlightening to look over the old numbers of POETRY and to realize that the first important chance for publication in America was given to many poets almost unknown who have since obtained fame We
