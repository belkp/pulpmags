during which the eyes become less blind it is possible to distinguish a vague suggestion of figures moving  A Alan s Voice in affirmation Light  My life  yet beats against darkness A Second Voice after an interval Failure A Voice answering And I brother The Second Voice Brother A Voice distant Here afar off in the desert my  voice calls back echoes I break beneath the silence asking A Woman s Voice Together we may understand press your lips closer  The attention of the reader is called to a brief note on this play on page 39 Right of representation is reserved by the authors  I  A pause sustained Then far back on the stage as if parting heavy draperies a pure white light divides the darkness It illuminates for an instant a strange boy like figure seated in front of the draperies on steps which seem to continue upward into the light an immeasurable distance Slowly the curtains come together The harsh voice of a Priest breaks the silence  Priest I render praise unto God who hath instructed mine eyes so that I do not behold darkness A Woman s Voice Lonely   The stage becomes visible In front of a background of tall neutral toned draperies which meet closing at the center three unequal steps extend across the stage From these steps run two parallel black lines a short distance apart to the foreground forming a path At either side of the stage is a conventionalized suggestion of a realistic setting clearly indicated but semi transparent and without reality  The boy like figure in white whose name may be called Ralfar remains seated on the steps Nearer the front is the Priest and to the right an Old Man blind The chief masculine character of the play stands at the extreme right  A Mother crossing from the left I am weary if there be  a search the child I bore let him seek in my stead the  dream  Old Man crossing I have lost the rest of me my  youth the woman whom I loved is dead if I had chil  2  dren they are long since parted from me I am but a husk with life to feel the presence of the wind Ralfar When all is taken then it might be   The Old Man continues to the left and exit  Priest Not until death be passed is life made sure  Ralfar standing erect Once I remember naked voices that strove crossing black lines Is this the light light bent from streets which has power to withdraw the hunger groping with blind courage the hunger which was darkness  A Young Girl entering from the right I go to give him all that I am  Ralfar looks towards her with a gesture as if of completeness broken instantly by half gestures from the Mother and Priest  Mother Stay Unless from love to keep its beauty  after love is gone a child Girl I am so young Priest as the Girl pauses irresolutely beckoning her Kneel   first Girl I cannot We will return together  afterward   As she crosses the stage she becomes aware of Ralfar and stops abruptly with a quick indrawn breath  3  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Ralfar I did not call Girl Perhaps it was his voice I heard  She leaves the stage slowly  Mother to Ralfar You smile strangely there is  strength disdain Ralfar Of me is borne no child Mother drawing back instinctively frightened What are  you  For a long time Ralfar does not answer and then only by extending the arms sidewards raising them slightly as if a veil were lifting from the background  Ralfar They only see streets houses nothing that here is the curtains and the reaching steps Mother scornfully to the Priest She speaks of mystery  Exit right  Ralfar looking in the direction that the Girl passed I felt the passionate search of half things Priest I know not you nor who you are You come break  ing altars Ralfar quietly Why must there be an altar Priest There must be altars And you too will need Ralfar Perhaps I  too  The Priest turns and goes off left  4  Cloyd Head and Mary Gavin  Ralfar Their heavy voices stifled by dead light The  darkness had gone from them The Man who has stood silently at the right Darkness Ralfar turning towards him with reluctance And you Man And I am one of them If you have seen Ralfar Yes clearly Man They have no longer hope Ralfar If from their eyes the sense of earth could even for  a moment vanish  An instant of suspended rhythm  Why have we loved   You wait shadows of time and space Yet darken on the mountain top Do you not feel the path between black lines Do you not see the steps and just beyond The mystery of light the curtains shield These are the heights where you and I have met It is but a little distance further  Man You reaching out beyond the world Frighten my strength   It is not the woman that I fear in you Something I know not what As one fears flowing water  Ralfar sinks to the floor with hands extended toward him in surrender that is also a challenge The vitality of this  5  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  gesture draws the Man into a position suggesting love The pose gradually becomes dynamic  Ralfar It would not matter if I met you now Or if we met after a thousand years W e have loved always always we shall love It is the meeting that keeps us from each other  Man The yielding glory of you streams upward Streams like the vapor of a cloud Ralfar Your breath Life concentrates tenser   burning A moment ecstasyI shall pass  and on  then Light different in quality far rises very quietly resurges upon the stage RalMan You saw too far Ralfar Do not speak watch Light reawakens gathered like a mist I am glad that we forgot a thousandyears A long interval From the left the Girl re enters Ralfar The colors that we watch are blurred A boy came with me who had gone away Whom also I must bring when you and I Meet again With a gesture as ofgoes directly to the Girl seeking freedom Ralfar turns and  6  Cloyd Head and Mary Gavin  Girl I loved him Ralfar Yet Girl I came  Ralfar makes a gesture of acceptance  Girl You will not ever let me go from you  love you as one loves a boy Ralfar meeting the eyes of the Man I am a boy Mother who has entered to the Girl Go from her  quickly Ralfar No I love her also Girl Also   She sees the Man  Mother to Ralfar You clutch at too much life you grasp  at life both ways Ralfar with a growing consciousness of freedom and of isolation Not you alone speak they the world of half things I too have known what causes them to hate that which I am  Girl to the Man Is it you that have power to kill the boy  I love in him Ralfar You would be better free Mother of the Girl Let her go back Ralfar after a pause And there were flowers trembling in  my hands flowers it had been wonderful to give Mother How can you give having no need  7  Ralfar with hands drawn down unconsciously crosses to the space midway between the black lines The Girl follows A pause The light alters  Ralfar I would not willingly have left them not so soon  No longer aware of those on the stage Ralfar takes the hands of the Girl and turns her gently aside  Girl Where can I go  She crosses from the stage A long silence  Ralfar Behind black curtains the light breathes  Ralfar turns abruptly and is facing the curtains with hands stretched upward and outward  Ralfar The path calls back my footsteps whence they came  The Mother recoils as if frightened glancing at the Man who stands motionless She goes off Ralfar moves towards the curtains A pause Out of the silence are heard at first distant then nearer heavy sounds dull and in repetition  A Voice Brother the chain with which you bind me hurts A Second Voice I do not touch you Brother the chain with which you bind me hurts A Third Voice I do not touch you Brother  8  Ralfar hearing the voices to the curtains in agony  Drag me from them I have gone   A pause then as if the word were forced into utterance  Brother  The Priest has re entered Ralfar unable to complete the struggle between the light and the earth rhythm goes to him and kneels  Ralfar Listen I saw Priest What did you see A Voice Brother the chain with which you bind me hurts Ralfar I saw A Voice The life I builded prisons me and yet Another Voice Together we may understand Another Voice Lonely Priest What did you see Ralfar Nothing Priest after an interval An altar will bring God more  near Man Their chains have brought them God more near Ralfar rising and speaking involuntarily Brother  Then holding the white light like a sword Ralfar cuts their chains The sounds begin to disintegrate  Man Their chains are fallen Ralfar aware of the disintegration One of them may find  9  During what follows discordant lights irregular in contour appear and cross and re cross developing intensity as the stage grows darker to receive them Various figures enter scattered Exit the Priest  A Voice off stage Our hands grow mad without a god  One of those on the stage Why have you hid our chains Ralfar That slaves might not seek God Another Find him Ralfar groping out The colors tear Another Show us the way Ralfar I cannot I would create only myself in you  The Girl There was love between us Ralfar I have forgotten Another I will take the sounds in my hands and gather  them with the lights and mould them Another The sounds reach further than your hands can  grasp  Another Ralfar Another Ralfar at the extreme Earth builds Have pity Pity right I am dying The rhythm is obstructed Ralfarsteps and speaks to the curtains sinks down on the Take me lest I re find their chains An interval The white light parts the curtains coming  like a wind The colors have vanished and all who were  10  on the stage except the Man Presently the curtains close once more  Ralfar rising Surely earth used me as it closed the path  Step after step behind   So far off is the sea I cannot hear it  Even the sky I cannot remember  And tall trees are not Man If you could hear me I would take you in my arms  Ralfar makes an involuntary gesture as if sometime he might be heard  Man And if I stay you might hear My life has been deflected to vast spaces leading toward you  The curtains become visible to the Man He walks slowly from the stage  Ralfar He dies  Ralfar moves backward toward the curtains suddenly touching them with raised hand  Priest crossing from the left Upon my altar the fire no  longer burns  Cloyd Head and Mary Gavin  II  A MAN WALKS IN THE WIND  Being so tired it is hard to hide from you It is hard to walk any longer in the night and the wind I have gone among brown trees I have crunched the blue Frost bitten grass under my feet I have stood In parted thickets caught in the crackling leaves I have seen the brushpiles on the ridges fired I have watched the twisted smoke that weaves Blue strands in the black branches of the wood And now being tired Being tired now and worn enough for rest Would it not be safe would it not be very good Tonight to find it in your breast In your wise breast where this is understood  Do you remember another night of wind Moonlight and wind when it was all The sky could do to keep from reeling upon us in shame When breathless we held it there From slipping down about us with your hair Do you remember a night last fall When the wind whirled us and whetted us to flame And whirled the leaves and whetted us to flame Whipped out your dress and would not let us be And drove us along the prairie two shadows clinging And dropped us at the foot of a tree  That was September before the frost  12  In the morning the prairie was gray with mist And the grass was matted white where we had lain And the arms of the elm the grizzled arms of the elm Pawed at the wind for something that was lost And knotted up with pain  Fall comes to fall again And I walk alone I walk alone in the wind I cannot master the beauty of the night I walk alone The poplar fingers rise Tall and awful among white glittering stars Surely this is the most sorrowful delight Of any man to walk alone with a dream Do you hear the ripple singing in the stream The beauty of the poplars strikes me down The wind over the grass I had not known The wind was such a lonely thing The wind cleaves me with beauty to the bone And the gray clouds that brush the fields and fling Gray darkness on to the driven prairie and fold Their lonely silence around the hills and fly On to the upper night to the upper air They have beat me clean they have beat my body cold With beauty Do you hear the wild geese cry  And now the dark is heavy in my head And in my heart all the sorrows have come home I am tired you do not know how tired I come You would not care tonight You would not care  13   But let your hand wander through my hair There would be no hurt now we are both too tired I would finger the soft silk of your dress the same As long ago when you were first desired As long ago when the wind whirled us to flame  For we know the bitter tune the wind sings There will be silence now there will be rest And eyes will heal after the wind stings And I shall hear your heart under your breast Moving across time with a great flow And we shall hear no more the wind s calling But only the silence of it falling and falling And always the room will throb quietly and slow  BRUSHWOOD  TO HIMSELF IN AUTUMN  Take bitterness into your wailing Be like the rock the hard gray stone See there is hunger in your ailing Walk scornfully and alone Walk scornfully on the fall brown hills And maybe where the wind heaves And scatters the littered poplar leaves Releasing tardy ones to the ground You will hear the faint authentic sound And remember why the wind grieves  14  THE CRYING CRANES  Wounded black eyes in a white dead lily face And black hair streaming like a river at night She stands in the rain at the high desolate place Watching till the gray ship shall pass from sight  Below the wet black rocks the Crying Cranes Scream with white water the reef sputters and booms And above her black hair the gray sky heavy with rains Cracks white and thunders to the dark sea that looms  Before that still face She raises to wild skies Black torrents of hair The salt wind whips her shawl Bruised the scared grass She watches with still eyes The glittering spume showers burst white and fall  Burst and cry and fall there is no end to the crying Lonely and gray as a bitter wave long tossed Under the torn edge of night the mist is flying And folding down till the gray ship is lost  TRAMPS  Muffled in his shabby black clothes With crab apple cheeks the wind made ripe I wonder where each vagabond goes Smoking wise thoughts out of his pipe  Like a wet blackbird in the rain or Flapping across the prairie in wind  15  I wonder if it s the devil s gain or His since first he sang and sinned  APPOINTMENT  I come from many hours of lonely Laughter with my friend and from many Hours of whispering at the knees Of a dark scornful girl I know I come from a swamp where gray rain glistens From headlands bleak under the blow And to any lonely man who listens I will speak quietly of these Before I light my pipe and go  NO POEM  I read my poem over again and threw it away  In the park where the elms brood  The old man who spears old papers on a spit  And tucks them into his brown gunny sack  Will make an end of it  Then after he has stood Awhile he will go off shouldering his brown Bag and shuffle out of sight A brown leaf drifting into the gray twilight That the bushes make about him folding down A better poem than I can hope to write  Maurice Lesemann  16  AFTER FEVER  There is a singing that is everywhere Waves of a sea that washes in my head The shoreless sea that roars inside a shell Blurred ringing of a distant drowsy bell Clamor of fairy festival or fair But for the iron of this featherbed I should float into places thin and far And like a bubble pricked against a star  Die in a trail of iridescent air  A SHY CHILD  They coax and beguile As though teasingly A squirrel in a tree  You do not speak or smile  In your eyes flit wise  Thoughts that wonder weaves  Of their silly words  Safe in your grave eyes  Safe as little birds  Busy behind leaves  Louise Redfield  17  NEEDLEWORK  I  Lengths of lawn and dimities Dainty smooth and cool In their possibilities Beautiful  Stretch beneath my hand in sheets Fragrant from the loom Like a field of marguerites All in bloom  Where my scissors footsteps pass Fluttering furrows break As the scythe trails through the grass Its deep wake  All my stitches running fleet Cannot match the tread Of my thoughts whose winged feet Race ahead  They are gathering imagery Out of time and space That a needle s artistry May embrace  Hints of dawn and thin blue sky Breaths the breezes bear  18  Hazel Hall  Wispy waspy things that fly In warm air  Bolts of dimity I take Muslin smooth and cool These my fingers love to make Beautiful  II  Crowds are passing on the street Tuck on tuck and pleat on pleat Of people hurrying along Homeward bound throng on throng Their work is finished mine undone Still my stitches run  I cannot watch the people go Fold on fold and row on row But I know each pulsing tread Is spinning out a life s fine thread I know the stars like needle gleams Are pricking through the sky s wide seams And soon the moon must show its face Like a pearl button stitched in place All the long hours of the day Are finished now and folded away Yet the hem is still undone Where my stitches run  Hazel Hall  19  HAND ON A HARP  Like the rose breasted swallows at sunset That glide and skim in the twilight Above the pale gold of the river Touching the surface so lightly That the smooth glints of the little ringlets Might elude me Except that I love them   Ay even as the swallows Her hands All shadow and rose in the flickering light of the fire Flit dream like over the golden strings Dipping with exquisite faintness Till the circles of sound Would filter away to the heavy darkness Except that I love them  PILGRIMAGE  I traced the comet s tail of his renown To Faure s rotisserie somewhere up town  Yes he had hands and feet about like mine He didn t mention winds and worlds and stars But subjugated poetry to wine And burnt up time and money in cigars  20  Ellwood Colahan  But I young I saw but the quick hot coals Purging their fiery passion on the grate I thought Beloved gossiper of souls If only I could be insatiate As you could be and scourge you fiercely on Leaping from dawn to dawn Your unstopped pipes forever at your lips In free untrammeled quest  Instead I watched his drumming finger tips And heard his laughter at some still born jest And wondered if this were the great strange child Who dreamt our dreams for us who only slept If this were he who wept when others smiled And further visioned smiled when others wept  How bitterly I rose and looked him through  Then suddenly my pulses throbbed anew  could have howled for joy sure enough  He d bent and scribbled something on his cuff  The kind of soup perhaps but for myself  The toppling Joss was back upon its shelf  Ellwood Colahan  21  THREE POEMS  HER DEATH  From the  The silence sobbed Like a bird s throat  Clear as a star Yes in the gathering twilight throbbed A liquid note A breath It drew me far Over my room s inscrutable shade A Brightness leaned A sun a cloud I sang aloud Yet no one heard no mortal heard Who hasteneth Yea I am ready ready Death My Death dear Death my life The step the word Ah he has heard He came I kissed the great white blade  I lived and I was not afraid  THE HOPE OF HEAVEN  I shall tell thee some day thou little wild Of the pains I suffered for thee  22  Thou wilt laugh a great laugh of diviner knowledge And sweep me up high beside thee Then I shall forget the dark travail pains The blood crimsoned trail the lair the long rains  Up there in the light beside thee No longer a sullen beast mother I With suspicious furred ears and a fierce agate eye  But winged and mighty like thee  SPEECH  Words words words Like starry flies on the sleeper s brain Listen all over the roads of earth You can hear our steps like rain  We are loud ephemeral vain Motes in the sunlight stirred Yet blazoned with ancestry For God himself is a Word  Words words words Nought may put us to scorn  Yea the unanswering dead And the mouth of the newly born Florence Wilkinson  23  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A RUSSIAN EASTER  In the great cathedral with blue windows In the great cathedral of Moscow They will kneel before the holy ikons  The Mother is dressed in blue and gold And the Child s eyes are of blue jewels And golden and blue are the robes of the high priest  Nataska will be there in a scarlet cloak And Irena s gown will be embroidered in crimson  Sergei will be there and Igor Will gaze with mystic Slav eyes at the gold altar  They will weep before the altar for their sins They will beat their breasts and pray for pardon They will arise shrived and forgiven  When the priest unlooses the tiny white doves They will weep for joy  All will arise and embrace one another Crying Hail brother hail Crying Hail sister hail  Christ is arisen Christ is arisen Christ Has arisen from his grave 24  Marya Zaturensky  Igor will chant sonorously Peace and brotherhood and love Have arisen with the white Christ  All will take up the cry Peace and brotherhood and love  Let there be peace and love  Since Christ is arisen Christ is arisen Christ is arisen from the dead  Irena s lover will kiss her on the lips Wild with the love of God Natasha s lover will kiss her forehead Reverently as the hands of the high priest  But I shall be alone weeping I shall weep remembering the blue cathedral I shall be sad in a strange country Thinking of Igor Natasha and Sergei Irena and the singing multitude  RUSSIAN PEASANTS  They dance wildly today at the village of Czernoff The men and women and little children They dance wildly before the great lord s castle  25  Snapping their heels cracking their fingers and sobbing In hilarious passionate abandon  Wilder and wilder shriek the cymbals and violins Wilder and wilder arise the cries of the dancers And wilder the songs and the mad laughter  Their faces are aglow their eyes are shining Radiant with vision and joy and splendor Lithe are the bodies of the young women Marvelous the grace of the young men And strangely beautiful the wild chant of the old men and  women  They pass in a scarlet maze singing laughing weeping  Scarlet the embroidered bodices and petticoats  Scarlet the blouses of the men  And scarlet and riotous the exhilarating air  Tomorrow we shall see them reaping  Backs bowed and eyes apathetic with labor  They will speak to you sorrowfully hopelessly  There is no joy in life they will say  Only with God is our great gladness  His peace and his light be with you brother  Marya Zaturensky  26  DAYS  KINSHIP White gull flying flying White wave cresting cresting Eager I go and crying To the goal you seek unresting  PASTEL  Now with soft shadow filled my room Becomes a place of lovely gloom Except where silver moonlight falls In squares on counterpane and walls  A LETTER  You smile perhaps when I write Spring to you Who know so well my window but reveals A space of factory walls and smoke soiled blue That square of sky above But here one feels April in March and prescience of the May Spring s not a matter just of birds or trees It s something subtler unheard unseen a way Joy surges up in every face one sees Shut me from sky or light I m sure I d know The day that Spring first breathed across the snow Even as now I sense it everywhere And find my window s grimy picture fair  Harold Holston Wright  27  SONGS FROM A BOOK OF AIRS  GO TOUCH THE SILENT STRINGS  Go touch the silent strings That long in sleep have lain Music that knows no past Or future pain Sing for the moment s joy And when the echoes fade Nothing will last but the song That your hands have made Nothing will last but song Though the music die And when this brain is dust That too will die  And when this brain is dust  That too will die  THE STORM BIRD  All day a storm bird in my breast Had struggled to be free And I who never sought such guest Endured in agony  At last in pain I tore my breast To set the wild thing free  28  Now you who came unasked unsought I pray you let me be  But at this word my stormy guest Grew quieter serene And rings of light dropped softly down From sun tipped clouds unseen  SONG  I know you beautiful and fair  Beyond delight  I know our bodies bare  In love unite  Yet weep for passion s flight  I weep because the rose  Must fade away  I weep because of words  That lead astray  I weep that passion never tells  What it longs to say  Though your breast lie on my breast  Still in vain the lover s quest  Like the dryads in the woods  Powerless to tell their moods  In a world of forest spells  Never half the lover tells  29  I SAW THE WORLD GO BY  I saw the world go by With crimson banners flying And loud bugles crying The young world went by  I saw the world go by Footsore and weary Banners torn and dreary The old world went by  I saw the world go by And laughed to see it going And cried to see it going And while I watched it going The world went by  SUMMONS  Then as the summons came I felt my name Roll out in flame  Along the midnight s black and baseless floor  My life grew hour by hour Bud stalk and flower How slight a thing hath power  On life Time s everlasting light to pour  30

I  I only came to know when it was time to die  EPITAPH  Earth draw thy coverlet over my face For I am weary and would rest a space I ve played at hide and seek among thy flowers And thou hast kindled me with sun and showers Hast fed and held me happy on thy knee And like a mother thou hast played with me Now I would sink upon thy breast Lift up thy coverlet and let me rest  Alice Corbin  31  COMMENT  MR YEATS AND THE POETIC DRAMA  NE prehisoric evening before the War on the first of March 1914 POETRY gave its first party the guest of honor being Mr William Butler Yeats a party which became a date in American literary history because of the Irish poet s gracious compliment to Vachel Lindsay who was then little known outside our pages and who responded by reading for the first time his newly finished poem The Congo  Six years later almost to a day on Wednesday the third  of March 1920 the editor of POETRY and its contributors  and guarantors gave a second banquet to the most dis  tinguished of modern poets and this time to Mrs Yeats as  well The occasion tempts one to reminiscence and con  trast POETRY in 1914 a war cry a roaring radical a  turbulent bolshevist in a placid and peace loving world has  become in 1920 at least the rising generation so informs  us with nobly violent gestures a placid and peace loving  institution in a world still heroically at war The young  rhymes for bread troubadour of our first banquet now  sings for the rich and great of New York Philadelphia soon  even London and the Imagists who were then a wee small  voice in POETRY have since been heard above the noise of  battle in all the four corners of the earth  Neither Edgar Lee Masters nor Carl Sandburg was pres  ent at that first dinner party Spoon River was not yet on  32  the map and the early group of Chicago Poems was just making its first appearance in POETRY that very month Cloyd Head was another absentee his Grotesques was not to appear on the stage until the autumn of 1915 or in print until October 1916 And Eunice Tietjens now Mrs Head was still lingering in New York and experimenting with the Lyric Year  In short although Vachel Lindsay and Arthur Ficke read poems to us and Alice Corbin made a vivid little speech and although Edith Wyatt and Frances Shaw and Agnes Lee were among the hostesses the New Movement in March 1914 was just gathering headway in Chicago and further east as well A few months later the world war threatened to engulf it but it survived and moved on to what final accounting who knows when foreign nations and the next age shall run up the sum of it  Mr Yeats in his brief address at the banquet took the Poetic Drama for his subject and told of the little theatre and the small audience which he and other poets are conspiring for in Dublin the aristocratic theatre in which from a dozen to fifty of the elect shall see plays worthy of spirits highly attuned and keyed and shall pass them on authoritatively to the next age a theatre modeled on the Noh drama of Japan whose playwrights and players were always blissfully absorbed in their art and royally unconscious of the crowd  Without venturing to question this aesthetic authority of  33  the elect in our unimperial age I was reminded of a dramatic exhibition which I had attended in New York two or three weeks before one which fulfilled Mr Yeats conditions as closely as any little theatre enterprise is like to do in our time and country The distinguished Irish poet unfortunately was not there and it is only too probable that less important engagements kept him away during the entire week or two that the Provincetown Players were giving Three Travellers Watch a Sunrise so that we are forever prevented from knowing whether the performance was in line with his desire But there was the small audience over fifty perhaps but under one hundred of the presumably elect for who but the elect would venture down past Washington Square through slushy snow drifts too mountainous for taxis There also was the small stage almost as informal as a drawing room upon which artists had thought out a not too elaborate setting And there in Wallace Stevens play was the Poetic Drama  I had almost forgotten how beautiful this brief play is even though I had read it twenty times more or less in manuscript and proof when it took POETRY S play contest prize and appeared in the July 1916 issue of the magazine But the three travellers were they from Provincetown or China appearing with their candle in the dark wood and vesting themselves in gorgeous robes for the ritual of the sunrise took me back to those windless pavilions of Mr Stevens magic country and asserted with unimpeachable validity the high audacity of the poet s imagination  34  The girl was not so adequate It is her province to enforce the tragedy by bringing the three dreamers face to face with the grim realities of agony and death With hardly a dozen lines to speak she would need be a Duse to give them their due effect As she seemed merely a high school amateur the elect audience had to imagine nobly during the tragic climax of the play the more because the sunrise instead of approaching slowly with gradual revelation of the dead figure among the branches appeared with the sudden flare of an electric light However for at least one auditor the three travellers uttering their beautiful lines had woven a spell which no later inadequacy could destroy the brief tragedy was complete and wonderful as perfect as a Greek vase in its assertion of beauty  It would be too much for even the elect to expect the other plays of the evening to be in tune But Alfred Kreymborg s Vote the New Moon was a screaming satire on political methods in our democracy done perhaps with too much emphasis on color and too little on rhythm but on the whole effectively and wittily grotesque And Pie by Lawrence Langner which finished the program was an amusing farce making excellent fun of marital misfits and interior decorative aesthetics  And Abraham Lincoln was that the Poetic Drama Perhaps not but it proved a skilfully constructed cleverly actable dramatic chronicle A certain toastmaster in introducing Mr Drinkwater at a luncheon said that this English poet had interpreted Lincoln for us Americans  35  The compliment was too sweeping the play does not interpret Lincoln it merely presents with fair accuracy the salient facts of his dramatic political career reducing them even as Shakespeare did to a presentable minimum of time number of persons involved etc But whereas Shakespeare was an interpreter of historic characters for his countrymen making them live again with all their imperfections and idiosyncrasies on their heads Mr Drinkwater does not venture beyond the most obvious historic data he misses the soul of his hero its depths and heights of sombre melancholy and Rabelaisian humor One can t help resenting the plausibility of the portrait a portrait painted by Pacheco when only Velasquez could have done it to the life And Mr McGlynn though admirably simple and well intentioned in his presentation of the rôle is not temperamentally adequate not rich or profound enough  The most unpoetic moments of the play are the alleged poetic interludes The Greek chorus has been sadly maltreated by the efforts of later playwrights to pay tribute to the classic tradition Shakespeare himself did not succeed very well with it and Mr Drinkwater s reminiscent figure mouthing metrical platitudes in front of the curtain is not only an insufferable bore but a public libel on the art of poetry which he misrepresents to the bewildered and impatient audience  However everyone should see this modern chronicle play indeed everyone is seeing it to such a degree that it will probably start a fashion The misadventures in dialect  36  Mr Yeats and the Poetic Drama  which marred the printed version have been taken in hand by some expert and are not heard on the stage The stage settings and costumes are quaintly 1860 and the difficult theatre scene behind the boxes is managed with consummate skill  And what about that other popular success Zoë Akins Déclassée Is this drama by a poet the Poetic Drama All the storehouses of romance are despoiled to make it the lordling and his faithless lady her lover cheating at cards and denouncing when he is denounced she adrift in a cold world and selling pearl after pearl to give bohemian parties to unworthy vaudevillians a Hebraic billionaire who woos and almost wins her but magnanimously gives way before the returning lover redeemed by Kimberley diamonds all this leading up to a slow death to slow music the lady having been opportunely run over by a taxicab Could an accommodating poet do more to please the public And poor Ethel Barrymore gilds her goldenest voice with pathos to be worthy of the rôle  Then there was Tolstoi s realistic near tragedy The Power of Darkness excellently given by the Theatre Guild but missing the magic touch which would have made of it the Poetic Drama And there was that fine comedy Clarence by Booth Tarkington which the Poetic Drama might be proud to claim so light and keen so sadly true is its laughing revelation of a too typical slam bang American family  One may find the Poetic Drama at the opera these days  37   set out with color and music and sometimes bereft of words John Carpenter s ballet The Birthday of the Infanta scarcely missed Oscar Wilde s delicate dialogue so eloquent was its pantomime so gorgeously interpretive were its scenic colors and costumes Indeed the Poetic Drama is in danger of getting along without poetry In Le Coq d Or at the Metropolitan the gorgeous and whimsical pageantry of color and music was voice accompanied but no one cared in what incomprehensible tongue the words were uttered by those singers behind the scenes Poetry was achieved by song and color the imagination responded to beauty and carried the drama These experiments by the Chicago and New York opera companies in scenic art pantomime and the dance are revealing new phases of the Poetic Drama leading all the arts together poetry no doubt with the others toward new triumphs  It may be that the Poetic Drama will demand in the not distant future a wider scenic range than in any previous period of artistic history from the small stage and intimate audience advocated by the Irish poet to the out door vastness of the Greek Theatre at Berkeley Endow your man of genius says Mr Yeats and leave it all to him Let each community find its man of genius and give his plays fit actors theatre and audience H M  38  NOTE ON THE CURTAINS  The play which opens this number is essentially designed for the theatre a pantomime through which words are interwoven To neutralize the disadvantage of the reader who must substitute imagination for the more precise clarity of the theatre a brief note may be of value  The authors have assumed as their premise that a character in whom were combined the masculine and feminine psychology might catch a nearer glimpse of whatever spiritual verities exist than is possible to ourselves This spiritual environment since the play is seen through the eyes of the central character Ralfar is therefore the dominant motive The curtains with white light beyond them the steps darkness these are symbols to which long usage has given fixed values They are symbols merely yet what they imply is to Ralfar much more immediate than the materialistic environment which for that reason must be represented as semi transparent and without reality To none of the other characters until the end of the play does the spiritual background become visible  The story is concerned with the progress of the central character and the reactions to that progress It leads through experience threatening to divide a completeness at the first unstable but afterwards confirmed by the attainment of impersonality Thenceforth no other search is possible save toward the infinite There comes a last call of earth seeking to drag the central figure downward to meet its need Above that call await the last stages of mysticism  39  The play has no ending the moment after the final curtain perhaps one does not know completes a circle  C H and M G  EMILIO DE MENEZES  Somewhat over a year ago the Brazilian Academy and that small minority of Brazilians for whom the Academy exists suffered in the death of Emilio de Menezes a loss which many of his compatriots find it hard to overestimate A native of Brazil he was one of the greatest poets of the Portuguese tongue to quote a Brazilian critic and while the individual may make reservations to an unrelieved eulogy of the dead poet it is certain that much of cultured Latin America reaffirms this opinion  The difficulty which confronts the foreign commentator who would sum up his achievements is inherent in the inadequacy of all translation but especially marked when the translator s subject is the work of an artist so fastidious in the use of his native tongue as was de Menezes Like Raymundo de Correio he showed strongly the reaction of his generation against the bombastic sentiment of the pioneer poets of Brazil and this reaction evidenced itself in an aristocratic attitude toward his calling expressed by the art for art s sake slogan of Parnassianism As Edna Worthley Underwood states in a recent letter to POETRY de Menezes is often compared to Baudelaire and I would add that the comparison particularly applies to the ease and apparent spontaneity with which he handles the unusual rhyme In  40  further discussion of the technique of de Menezes his alexandrines are considered of the most perfect in the Portuguese tongue A parallel is also drawn between his first books Funeral March and Funereal Eyes and the work of J M Heredia whose single volume opened the doors of the French Academy to its author  The final volume of poems by de Menezes had the prophetic title Last Rhymes Such delicate disparagement expresses something of the sentimental irony of the verses so indicated Here is a book of middle age de Menezes was fifty when he died written with restraint but with a dauntless vanity which enjoys rather mercilessly the contemplation of the pathos of its own futility The spirit is perfectly expressed in a little song the words by de Menezes the music by Alberto Nepomuceno which ends  Lilies from Earth s strong breast  Conquer the pomegranate s red  Onward we go to death  As to a bridal bed And the same quietly triumphant resignation with that taint  of insincerity which gives it its artificial grace is echoed in  the sonnet Afternoon by the Sea in which the poet recalls  an exultant youth and closes with the capitulating lines  Say to this glittering eternity Beholding in the foam my own white hair The old old sea grows old with me  One of the sonnets The Dead Tower is dedicated to  Coelho Netto which suggests that one compare the rococo  imagination of this most popular and characteristic Brazilian  author with the deliberately subdued fancy of de Menezes  41  Coelho Netto it is true had at that time come no nearer the poetic form than a volume of prose poems called Raphsodias but his fecund inventiveness which nurtures metaphor as the tropical soil nurtures vegetation tends toward the popular and vulgar ornate in a way to emphasize the discrimination of his one time contemporary It is to be hoped that the spirit of de Menezes may in time be seen to have affected Brazilian art to a further extent than is now apparent Here is a country far behind our own in popular enlightenment and yet a country in which one prays for a genius who has never read a book above all a genius without a classical education One prays especially for a writer who will lay the fleshly ghosts of Cleopatra and Salome for these departed heroines appear to Brazilian poets with as successful a determination to be written about as that astonishing head of King Charles which so annoyed Dickens Mr Dick De Menezes had that sophisticated artistic simplicity which finds its practical counterpart in good breeding and it may be said for him that in his last volume these traditional female symbols of inspiration receive no mention and that Astarte and Phryne are banished with them The very positive effect of the negative virtues can only be appreciated through a general perusal of Brazilian poetry  It will interest Americans particularly to know that Last Rhymes includes the dead man s unsuccessful translation of Poe s Raven Poe has been translated into Portuguese several times but The Raven is the only one of Poe s works generally known and quoted in Brazil  42  Emilio de Menezes  The career of the dead poet was also noteworthy as it embraced interests so little related to his art Born in Curityba in the State of Paraná he entered early into public life where he reached his highest ascendant in the final phase of the government of Maréchal Deodoro His essays in the stock market met with as much success as his writing Among other interesting incidents concerning him which his death recalled was his founding of the once popular but now extinct literary journal A Folha  Evelyn Scott  REVIEWS  THOMAS HARDY S POETRY  An American View  Collected Poems by Thomas Hardy Macmillan Co  The nineteenth century in England produced two groups of poets The first at its outset was the brilliant romantic cluster of Coleridge Keats Wordsworth Shelley Byron A little before them somewhat outshadowed by the latecomers magnificence but yet revealing a polished glow of their own was another group consisting of Landor Crabbe and the strange erratic star of Blake Both of these groups came to an end in about 1830 and it was not till mid century that another group of widely contrasted poets appeared a group including Tennyson Browning Arnold Patmore Swinburne Rossetti Morris and Meredith Many  43  of these were still living when the young Thomas Hardy became fired with ambition to be a poet  That ambition was destined to be postponed twenty years for Hardy was forced to the writing of novels by the necessity of earning a living It was not until he had passed Shakespeare s fifty two years that he achieved or at least began to publish the earliest of the poems which are here collected  Hardy is the one great poet of the twentieth century in England Scan we the skies never so closely there is none to set beside him Even those who dislike his work and they have been not a few or they would never have succeeded in delaying his triumph as a poet for twenty years are forced to admit that he stands alone He not only stands alone but he stands in the sharpest possible contrast to the romantics or to the Victorians Where the romantics pressed forward in their zeal for liberty and truth he stands still counselling that liberty is an impossible dream and man a mere puppet of the gods while truth wears an ugly face Where the Victorians with the possible exception of Swinburne traced a world of orderly progress and increasing enlightenment he sees only a dark anarchic welter of fate with no gleams of hope for the future and nothing but resignation to destiny possible to helpless mankind And he has illustrated his vision to the world by writing poetry so beautiful so weighty with idea and expression that to turn to it from the rhymes of the Georgians or from the verslibristic efforts of more futuristic singers is like turning to  44  Thomas Hardy s Poetry  Bach or Beethoven from the efforts of a rag time band We rub our eyes and wonder how such poetry ever could have come to be written in our age It seems remote to us so remote in fact that verse after verse of it comes to our mind not as something near to us but as a familiar quotation Here are a few of them taken from as many poems  At last one pays the penalty The woman women always do  The land s sharp features seemed to be The Century s corpse out leant  Leave the door unbarred The clock unwound Make my lone bed hard Would twere underground  At whiles or short or long May be divined a wrong Dying as of self slaughter  I speak as one who sounds Life s dim profound  One who at length can sound  Clear views and certain  But after love what comes  A scene that lowers A few sad vacant hours And then the curtain  By briefest meeting something sure is won It will have been Nor God nor demon can undo the done Unsight the seen Make muted music be as unbegun  Your face and a God curst sun and a tree And a pond edged with greyish leaves  45  When the Present has latched its postern behind my tremulous stay And the May month flaps its glad green leaves like wings One wonders how such a poet came to be our contemporary and not the contemporary of Shakespeare And the astonishing fact that of the last two quotations the first dates from 1867 and the second from fifty years later leads me to make another observation Hardy is the most homogeneous of all English poets Anyone who has read his work steadily through and unless we do so we are not in a position to judge of his importance will be struck with amazement at the fact that the poet of the early poems is essentially the same as the poet who but the other day was writing Moments of Vision Practically alone among the major poets of England Hardy has seen no reason to alter his technique his attitude or his philosophy of life for half a century What he was at the beginning he is now a poet with certain definite views on mankind on God and the world which admit of neither correction nor amendment The view of the world which he chooses to illustrate or perhaps I should rather say illuminate is one of the truths of which he himself is certain and has always been certain It is a view of a sphere which has lost faith in God s special providence for man in His mercy in His justice and which is only guided in its toilsome struggles by its own conscience feeble as this is and by its sense of some blind overpowering destiny working out unconsciously its plan in despite of mortals who must however groaningly submit unquestion  46  Thomas Hardy s Poetry  ingly to Fate This view of the macrocosm the world is tinged by influences emanating from the microcosm that part of the world which Hardy inhabits which is England Thus he is at once the most universal and the most local and personal of poets As in his novels one is amazed at the wealth of observation he has drawn from a narrow range of familiar scenes and faces then at the universal application of these scenes and faces lastly at the way in which all these depict essentially one man Thomas Hardy For though he has assured us that his poems are largely dramatic or personative in intention yet the fact remains that under whatever dramatic disguise there is always Thomas Hardy looking at life This is even more true in his case than in the case of Browning who declared with no more reason that he did not put himself in his work All of Hardy s poems are Hardy himself and to read them is to know the man more clearly than those who see him in the flesh  Another curious point is the extraordinary range in the subjects of these poems Hardy apparently can write on anything from a milliner s circular or a fly walking across the table to the funeral of God Almighty Himself And each one of these poems illustrates the same view a world left without faith without grounds for hope and with Christian charity expressing itself in mutual slaughter or worse This one logical central conception is radiated in endless multiplicity throughout his work Each poem is a facet endlessly reflecting the primal unity of Hardy s thought This is so much the case that it is impossible to  47  conceive of any poet following upon Hardy He has so completely covered the ground of his own mind so logically stitched in every thread of the canvas that he has left nothing for any disciple to do  This thought leads me to make one final even though perilous attempt to sum up his position not as regards the present day but in regard to the future of English poetry As I have said Hardy is the only poet living today in England who can be called without any stretch of the imagination great So great in fact is he that one is unable to trace any literary influence upon his work except the influence of the two supreme monuments of English literature Shakespeare and the authorized version of the Scriptures But the question may be perhaps excused if coming from an American does this greatness which has expressed itself in ruthlessly stripping off the last fragments of Victorian illusion contain elements that given time will project English poetry one stage further Does it contain in itself the promise of work equally great or greater as does say the poetry of Marlowe Keats Blake Shelley Or does it leave us with the conviction that poetry of purely insular English origin has in a sense completed itself and passed away with Hardy  This question needs to be asked for it is important as regards the future status of colonial and American poetry not only at home but more important still in England itself Time will doubtless supply the answer Meanwhile time has supplied English poetry with Thomas Hardy who  48  at least makes another Victorian era utterly impossible And it suffices to say that of all the poets who have written and are writing in our own times he alone seems of stature sufficiently large to form a landmark in these dark years of war and change through which England is passing and yet must pass John Gould Fletcher  AN ORTHODOX PREACHER  The Solitary by James Oppenheim B W Huebsch  If a man believes himself a prophet it is an impertinence to inform him that he is not but as reviewers are an impertinent lot and as I number myself among them temporarily I must even do my duty  Whitman tried hard to be a preacher and was a poet every so often simply because he could not help himself If Mr Oppenheim should try very hard to be a poet there is just a faint possibility that he might succeed but up to date he has striven only to be a preacher and his success has been almost flawless Perhaps I should say he has striven to be a prophet and has succeeded in being a preacher there is of course a difference  One emerges at the latter end of this book with a sick headache and mixed impressions of bad dreams of Whitman Sandburg and the collected platitudes of the world There are interminable passages shameless in their imitation of Whitman many that barely escape if they do escape plagiarism Thus  49  I hear the war guns thunder and the clear voiced choirs singing I step in a house where a tired mother croons to her sleepy child I walk along the shore in the gleaming summer night and hear the babble of lovers The murderer walks side by side with the saint  And so on for many many pages This is the predominant note of the book but occasionally there are echoes of Sandburg s less fortunate manifestations  The Baltimore trolley cars go jammed with summer fluff and straw hats Out to Electric City Trolleys along the Atlantic coast Trolleys in the Alleghenies Trolleys making the loop in soot soft Pittsburgh Sometimes Mr Oppenheim writes a line that is almost good and then moralizes about it for ten pages Here are examples of the best work to be found in the volume  A woman leans from a window And is a silver shower On my heart beneath  Night grows vaster With simulation of intense death  Perhaps these lines have a certain hint of beauty or perhaps one is merely surprised to see an attempt at creating beauty in this mass of second hand gestures but one is temporarily at least startled at coming upon these passages on page fifty seven On a fairly close scrutiny however one finds in these and like passages old tricks applied anew or general echoes But occasionally something emerges  50  An Orthodox Preacher  which one cannot trace to other sources and so suspects of being Mr Oppenheim himself  The ironic spirit Was our wet nurse And we milked her in the soft latitudes of the equator of dreams  Comment is an anti climax  I am aware that certain persons admire Mr Oppenheim s work It is my own theory however that whether or not Whitman s philosophy had of itself any particular value or originality it is not improved by repetitions and restirrings with alien platitudes The belief that The People read poetry of whatever sort and can be aided and abetted thereby and the other belief that those who do read poetry are in serious need of philosophical text books comfort and advice are discarded conventions of the nineties To those whose ears are refined by much music this pompous nothingness is an intrusion and an insult We have heard  broken echoes of the thin silver Christ who has lost his  way in the mountains A Y W  AN AMERICAN GEORGIAN  Poems About God by John Crowe Ransom Henry Holt  amp Co  Mr Ransom would be a good if he were not quite so  brittle a poet He would shine although he is an Amer  ican among the English Georgians with whom indeed he  seems to have a sort of kinship on account of his delib  erately child like method of presentation but he suggests  51  greater possibilities possibilities which he may attain if he deserts what seems a studied attitude and writes with a real instead of a strained sincerity  The first three stanzas of the first poem illustrate sufficiently well the sophisticated naive insouciance of the Georgian temper  In dog days plowmen quit their toil And frog ponds in the meadows boil And grasses on the upland broil And all the coiling things uncoil And eggs and meats and Christians spoil  A mile away the valley breaks So all good valleys do and makes A cool green water for hot heads sakes And sundry sullen dog days aches  The swimmer s body is white and clean Is washed by a water of deepest green The color of leaves in a starlight scene And it is as white as the stars between  The poem called Sunset apart from the line containing the word adjectival and possibly The Ingrate exhibit his skill at its best In these he captures the sense of a scene his own scene with no small degree of individuality and one admires his terse phrasing as well as his sensitive perception of the psychology of a mood  A second book by Mr Ransom will tip the balance one way or the other Either he will repeat the present vein which will hardly be worth while or he will do something different and better Either he will not count or he will count quite significantly A C H  52  A Romanticist  A ROMANTICIST  Young Adventure by Stephen Vincent Benét Yale Univ  Press  Mr Benét is a young poet of fervid and romantic temperament He fishes in the well of his own personality and brings up for our inspection various scaly specimens which have lurked in semi obscurity He casts his line deep and there is something not quite healthy and robust in the fish he offers us  To break away from metaphor most of Mr Benet s poetry is either too fantastic too highly colored a fault of youth or too melodramatic too morbid youth again to blame For instance in the poem The Lover in Hell the first half is cheaply gruesome insincere no more convincing than a small boy playing bogey man but when the theme turns to heaven Mr Benét achieves some lines of clear beauty  The eloquent thunder Of new glad suns shouting aloud for joy Over fresh worlds and clean And she is the low lake drowsy and gentle And good words spoken from the tongues of friends And calmness in the evening  Briefly there is too much poison blood hell death and damnation in the book Perhaps this has been Mr Benet s armor against the charge of sentimentalism made against so many young poets There are too many loud sounding highly colored adjectives to snare a beauty ever escaping such devices But sometimes when his voice is less clamor  53  ous beauty peeps at us from between his words Here and there throughout his verse one finds beautiful imaginative lines and there is at least one good poem Love in Twilight which I quote in part  There is a darkness behind the light and the pale light drips Cold on vague shapes and figures that half seen loom Like the carven prows of proud far triumphing ships And the firelight wavers and changes about the room  Gently she breathes and the long limbs lie at ease And the rise and fall of the young slim virginal breast Is as certain sweet as the march of slow wind through trees Or the great soft passage of clouds in the sky at rest  One shaking and fragile moment of ecstasy While the grey gloom flutters and beats like an owl above And I would not move or speak for the sea or the sky Or the flame bright wings of the miraculous Dove  M A S  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  CONTINENTAL MAGAZINES  The famous old Mercure de France is a leisurely journal it

Italy Incidentally it is perhaps the fifth or sixth periodical which the inexhaustible poet writer editor and philosopher Giovanni Papini has founded and edited  La Revista published at Barcelona Catalunya is a fine serious magazine Catalunya is one more of the suppressed nations and this paper on the strong background of nationalism and of a pure and healthy patriotism that upholds the teaching of Catalan instead of Spanish in Catalan schools has wide human interests and is edited with magnificence It is I suppose a kind of New Republic of Catalunya only much better Discussion about and translations from foreign poets such as Verhaeren Papini Ady and several others that America never heard of is so wide and intelligent it makes me wonder whether there is more to a little review edited by a bunch of patriotic young fellows of an almost nation than to each and all of our expensive ugly garbed talkative and non constructive magazines  E C  56  NOTES  Mr Cloyd Head of Chicago
