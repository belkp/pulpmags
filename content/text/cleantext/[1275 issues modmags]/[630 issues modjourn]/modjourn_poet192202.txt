1922  POEMS BY WANG WEI  ANSWERING VICE PREFECT CHANG  AS the years go by give me but peace Freedom from ten thousand matters I ask myself and always answer What can be better than coming home A wind from the pine trees blows my sash And my lute is bright with the mountain moon You ask me about good and evil Hark on the lake there s a fisherman singing  BOUND HOME TO MOUNT SUNG  The limpid river past its bushes Flowing slowly as my chariot   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Seems a fellow voyager Returning with the evening birds A ruined city wall overtops an old ferry Autumn sunset floods the peaks Far away beside Mount Sung I shall rest and close my door  A MESSAGE TO p AI TI  Cold and blue now are the mountains From autumn rain that beat all day By my thatch door leaning on my staff I listen to cicadas in the evening wind Sunset lingers at the ferry Cooking smoke floats up from the houses Oh when shall I pledge Chieh yu again And sing a wild poem at Five Willows  ON THE WAY TO THE TEMPLE  Not knowing the way to the Temple of Heaped Fragrance I have roamed under miles of mountain cloud Old woods without a human track But far on the height I hear a bell A rillet sings over winding rocks The sun is tempered by green pines At twilight close to an emptying pool I lie and master the Passion dragon   Witter Bynner and Kiang Kang hu  MOUNT CHUNG NAN  The Great One s height near the City of Heaven Joins a thousand mountains to the corner of the sea Clouds when I look back close behind me Mists when I enter them are gone A central peak divides the wilds And weather into many valleys Needing a place to spend the night  I call to a wood cutter over the river  A VIEW OF THE HAN RIVER  With its three Hsiang branches it reaches Ch u border And with nine streams touches the gateway of Ching This river runs beyond heaven and earth Where the color of mountains both is and is not The dwellings of men seem floating along On ripples of the distant sky O Hsiang yang how your beautiful days Make drunken my old mountain heart  IN MY LODGE AT WANG CH UAN  AFTER A LONG RAIN  The woods have stored the rain and slow comes the smoke As rice is cooked on faggots and carried to the fields Over the quiet marshland flies a white egret And mango birds are singing in the full summer trees   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  have learned to watch in peace the mountain morning  glories To eat split dewy sunflower seeds under a bough of pine To yield the place of honor to any boor at all Why should I frighten sea gulls even with a thought  MY RETREAT AT CHUNG NAN  My heart in middle age found the Way And I came to dwell at the foot of this mountain When the spirit moves I wander alone Where beauty is known only to me I will walk till the water checks my path Then sit and watch the rising clouds And some day meet an old woodcutter And talk and laugh and never return  IN A RETREAT AMONG BAMBOOS  Alone I am sitting under close bamboos Playing on my lute singing without words Who can hear me in this thicket Bright and friendly comes the moon  LINES  You who arrive from my old country Tell me what has happened there Did you see when you passed my silken window The first cold blossom of the plum   Witter Bynner and Kiang Kang hu  A PARTING  Friend I have watched you down the mountain Till now in the dark I close my thatch door Grasses return again green in the spring But O Wang Sun will you return  A SONG AT WEI CH ENG  The morning rain settled the dust in Wei ch eng In the yard of the tavern green willows revive Oh wait to empty one more cup West of Yang Gate no old friends  THE BEAUTIFUL HSI SHIH  Since beauty is honored all over the empire How could Hsi shih remain humbly at home At dawn washing clothes by a lake in Yueh At dusk in the Palace of Wu a great lady Poor no rarer than the others Exalted everyone praising her rareness But above all honors the honor was hers Of blinding with passion an emperor s reason Girls who had once washed silk beside her Now were ordered away from her carriage Ask them in her neighbors houses If by wrinkling their brows they can copy her beauty   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A SONG OF YOUNG GIRLS FROM LO YANG  There are girls from Lo yang in that door across the street Some of them fifteen and some a little older While their master rides a rapid horse with jade bit and  bridle Their handmaid brings them codfish on a golden plate On the painted pavilions facing their red towers Cornices are pink and green with peach bloom and with  willow Canopies of silk awn their seven scented chairs Rare fans shade them home to their nine flowered cur  tains Their lord with rank and wealth and in the green of life Exceeds for magnificence even Chi lun He favors girls of lowly birth and teaches them to dance And he gives away his coral trees to almost anyone The wind of dawn just stirs when his nine soft lights go out Those nine soft lights like petals in a flying chain of  flowers From play to play they have barely time for singing over the songs No sooner are they dressed again than incense burns before  them Those they know in town are only the rich and the lavish And day and night they re visiting the homes of Chao and  Li Who cares about a girl from Yueh face jade white Humble poor alone by the river washing silk   Witter Bynner and Kiang Kang hu  HARMONIZING A POEM BY PALACE ATTENDANT KUO  High beyond the thick wall a tower shines with sunset Where peach and plum are blooming and willow cotton  flies You have heard it in your office the court bell of twilight Birds discover perches officials head for home Your morning jade will tinkle as you thread the golden  palace You will bring the word of heaven from the closing gates  at night And I should serve there with you but being full of years I have put aside official robes and am resting from my ills  A GREEN STREAM  I have come on the River of Yellow Flowers  Borne by the current of a green stream  Rounding ten thousand turns through the mountains To journey less than a hundred li  Rapids hum on scattered stones Light is dim in the close pines The surface of an inlet sways with nut horns Weeds are lush along the banks Down in my heart I have always been clear As this clarity of waters Oh to remain on a broad flat rock And cast my fishing line forever  Translated from the Chinese by Witter Bynner and Kiang Kang hu   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IN PRAISE OF ABRIGADA  I had been told A foolish tale Of stone dank cold But you Held to wide winter storm To clutch of blackening frost and ocean gale Are warm  I thought that stone was silent too Unmoved by beauty Unaware of season or of mirth But I hear laughter singing as I lay My face against your gray Surely I hear the ritual of far waves And scent their winging spray Mixed with wild rose and honeysuckle Budding sassafras And the cool breath of pungent leafy bay  I knew that walls were sheltering And strong But you have sheltered love so long That love is part Of your high towering Lifting you higher still As heart lifts heart    Leonora Speyer  Hush How the whip poor will Wails from his bush The thrush Grows garrulous with delight There is a rapture in that liquid monotone Bob White Bob White Dear living stone  In the great room below Where arches hold the listening spaces Flames crackle leap and gleam In the deep fire places Memories dream Of other memories perhaps Of gentle lives Of births and of those other births that men call death Of voices foot steps tapping the stone floor And faces faces  Beyond the open door The meadows drowsy with the moon The faint outline of dune The lake the silver magic in the trees Walls you are one with these  High on the loggia roof Under the stars as pale as they   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Two silent ones have crept away Seeking the deeper silence lovers know Into the radiant shadows of the night Into the aching beauty of the night They dare to go  The moon Is a vast cocoon Spinning her wild white thread Across the sky A thousand crickets croon Their sharp edged lullaby I hear a murmuring of lips on lips All that I am beloved All Lovers eternal cry Lift them still higher wall  You stand serene The great winds linger lean Upon your breast The mist Lifts up a gray face to be kissed The east and west Hang you with banners Flaunt their bold victories of dusk and da Seasons salute you as they pass Call to you and are gone   Leonora Speyer  Amid your meadow grass Lush green You stand serene  Houses like hearts are living loving Joyful or woeful Forget or are forgot Houses like tired hearts Sicken at last and die Crumble and rot But they who know you Abrigada They and I Forget you not  Nor they who stand on Abrigada s roof Glowing aloof  Come with me now Climb with me stand look down In new content of mood Withdrawn from clasp of crowd And tangle of the town Climb swifter still From safe companionship of cloud The deeper to look down  Not back Forget the thirst the sordid cup   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The plethora the piteous lack  Forget the trafficking in tears  The arrogance of scars  Look up  To dream undaunted dreams aloud  And stumble toward the stars  This be in praise  Of Abrigada In all the ways  That come to me  Through the wise wistful summer days  In speech in rhyme and rhythm of word Call it a poem maybe  In song tuck the brown shining wood Under my chin Call it my bird My heart My violin In prayer In dream In silence best of all Leaning on the beloved dew drenched wall  Leaning and lifting High With Abrigada s gesture toward the sky  Leonora   AN OLD WOMAN  Something within her makes her live so long It pays no heed that all her friends are dead Her age is moving as a simple song Wailing that happy days long since are dead Something forgets that all her teeth have dropt That eyes no longer serve to see her ways Time seems not weary of this weed uncropt And draws her on into these newer days She does not know at night if she will rise And wake again to live another day Eternity of age now makes her wise A thing on point of passing hear her say  The moon outlasts my days the sleepless hounds Bark ever in the night strange haunting sounds  I COMPLAIN IN PASSING  I am weary of green in the grass Of green in the trees Of blue in the sky of white on the clouds And things like these I pray for one boon down the long white day That I may cease For mountain and meadow and grove and sky Leave me no peace  Harlow Clarke   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WINTER DAWN  The dark rolls back Like dropped stars The willows shine on the sides of the water courses Their ice blades clash Making a slow thin music So wakes he Tem Sotetc Kwi So comes he slowly like a slow thin music Ah ah hi i brothers Lovers of trails and sea paths It is the time of sorrow and the time of shutting in For he has come again Tem Sotetc Kwi With heavy winds Like frozen ropes of cedar hoary Uncoiling from his thighs To bind the world  I have seen his white moccasins upon the mountain His steps have hushed the waters Of the great and little falls The rushing rivers are stopped He has fed the lake s watery breast to the White Bear That follows him The canoes of the Coast dwellers are hung under the roofs Like empty cradles We can no longer rock on the wings of the great Blue  Heron  The great Blue Heron has hidden herself   Constance Lindsay Skinner  Under the thatch of her nest Because of his pale gray foxes with white ears His hungry foxes Huddled about the brink of her nest He has taken away the brown fields Where our bare feet danced with Autumn At the feast of berries and maize The bare brown fields that were glad When we drummed with our brown bare feet Singing Hoy mah ah hoy a mah  Ai hi The mats his witch woman weaves for him are  thick and cold We have put beaver fur about our feet And made us long long flat shoes to bear us up This is our magic wise men s magic To save us from the White Bear s maw His great snowy owls fill all our cedars Aii hi The red breasts of woodpeckers No longer flicker in our forests His witch woman is plucking the wings of the sky The air is stuffed with white feathers We no longer may speak with the sun ai i Gravely with bowed hearts we greet you O Tem Sotetc Kwi Snow chief Ice hunter Priest of the Long White Moons  Slowly slowly like thin music Murmur the sorrow

for Swiya  Much joy had Swiya our mother who loved three lovers As a maid boldly she went forth And met Spring among the willows He pierced her with hope Singing she entered the green doors of Summer Singing she came out girdled with fragrance She took the yellow harvest moon in her hands And waited in the maize fields behind our village Autumn clasped her there in the fields he crowned her  with maize He filled her pouch with berries he gave her much deer s meat  Autumn Feast maker Dearest was he among her three lovers He was the strong one he gave the most food he was the last Ai great joy had Swiya our mother who loved three  lovers And took their gifts All their gifts were ours Swiya our mother kept nothing  back   Constance Lindsay Skinner  Now she lies bare her hands are empty her face is cold Her eyelids are shut for her eyes are in the Place of Death Under white eyelids Q ulx se wag ila Tem Sotetc Kwi has carved the death totem over Swiya s  door Slowly softly like thin music

White Moons  Constance Lindsay Skinner  FROM A CHICAGO L  The great gray houses walk along  Sombrely and slow  Weary in the dusk  In a dragging row  They are very tired  Heart broken and old  They seem to shudder as they pass  The winter wind is cold Sarah Margaret Brown   FATE  I have so often  Examined all this well known room  That I inhabit  There is the open window There the locked door the door I cannot open The only doorway  When at the keyhole often often I bend and listen I can always hear A muffled conversation  An argument An angry endless argument of people Who live behind  Now loudly talking Now dimly to their separate conflict moving Behind the door  There they seem prisoned As I in this lone room that I inhabit My life my body  You of the previous being You who once made me and who now discuss me Tell me your verdict and I will obey it  You long ago    Harold Monro  With doubting hands and eager trembling fingers Prepared my room  Before I came Each gave his token for remembrance brought it And then retired behind the bolted door  There is the pot of honey One left and there the jar of vinegar On the same table  Who poured that water Shining beside the flask of yellow wine Who sighed so softly  Who brought that living flower to the room Who groaned that I can ever hear the echo You do not answer  Meanwhile from out the window Sounds penetrate of building other houses Men building houses  And so it may be Some day I ll find some doorway in the wall What shall I take them  What shall I take them Beyond those doorways in the other rooms What shall I bring them That they may love me   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Fatal question For all the jangling voices rise together I seem to hear  What shall he take them Beyond their closed door there s no final answer They are debating  II  O Fate Have you no other gift Than voices in a muffled room Why do you live behind your door And hide yourself in angry gloom  And why again should you not have One purpose only one sole word Ringing forever round my heart Plainly delivered plainly heard  Your conversation fills my brain And tortures all my life and yet Gives no result I often think You ve grown so old that you forget  And having learnt man s fatal trick Of talking talking talking still You re tired of definite design And laugh at having lost your will  Harold Monro   HILLSIDE POEMS  WINTER RAIN  It is sad this rain Drip dripping in the night Monotonously Into the snow Dripping from the corners of the house And the ends of black twigs All night long without change Rain rain soft fingered Lifting up the white snow Uncovering the clay beneath Rain soft Almost unwilling The fingers of an old woman Who cannot resist Slipping downstairs in the night To the front room And lifting the sheet for a last look At what it conceals  A NAKED MAPLE  You have put off your leaves You are like a runner who stands naked at the mark Calm and certain of victory   POETRY A Magazine of Ferse  You are glorious in your ease Waiting for the first silver whistle of the snow And in your sureness That the yellow medal of a May moon will be pinned to  your breast Clothed again and triumphant  NOONTIME  Noontime and locusts Locusts goading the heat Quivering over the hay fields Yet the men arise from half eaten dinners And hood canvas over the stacks The full tawny breasts of the hayfields For the first dark finger of lust Is pointing over a steeple Far in the distance  JUDGES  Between her two brothers Who argue of nations and laws With a neighbor She stands big with a child Watching the sunshine Waiting the end of their talk Saying nothing   Frederick R McCreary  ALONE ON THE HILL  Alone on the hill In the warm October noon With the woods below And beyond their brilliance the sea The moment has come The rapt still instant of being When water and wood are gone There is nothing now But the on running fluid of hours Gleaming with blue yellow crimson Now quick Let me run on sharp stones Let me strangle in surf choked with the bitter salt water Let me feel pain feel torture And the acid hunger of loneliness Give me self self Before I am lost In this madness of space eternal This horror of dream triumphant  Frederick R McCreary   POETRY A Magazine of Vers  INCIDENTALS  DUST IN THE ROAD  The dust Is a yellow grey veil Over the limbs of the wind And the little breeze dons it That her fleet litheness And the whirling torsions of her sprite s form May be apparent As she gaily runs down the road To greet us  TAPS  Out of the night Up from the serene valley of the Missouri Over the free forested Kansas hills Come notes of a bugle Mincing silver slippered steps of music  THE STAR  When the screws had made their last round And the lights in the cells were out I arose and peered out the window And just over the edge of the prison wall I saw a tiny twinkling yellow star   Hi Simons  Furtively winking at me Like the eye of the Infinite Mischievously happy Because it had slipped me a bit of joy Over the wall from the outside  PORTRAIT OF AN OLD ROUE  The seeds of his sin Thrust tiny red roots Among the cell crevices of his face Now their minute purple tendrils Trace on his cheeks and nose Vine patterns as intricately beautiful As his fastidious iniquities  Hi Simons  TAK FOR SIDST To C S  Good bye you said and your voice was an echo a  promise You turned to go a grey iron ghost The night took you Insubstantial as air stronger than iron You were here and had gone Your voice was an omen an echo  Babette Deutsch   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IN THE OFFICE  THE GUARDIANS  Old men nodding over great books  Always writing with gold pens  Every morning  Adding figures  Turning pages  Every morning  A little grayer  A little mustier  A little older  Old men do you keep Age  Hidden between your desks  Will she catch me  If I come down to ask you For the October statement  AILEEN  She goes through the order of the day Like a nun The rattle of her typewriter Is the rustle of a rosary And she speaks in the telephone With the retreated delicacy Of one who murmurs before an altar  Gwendolen Haste   MOTHERHOOD  Playing alone by the ocean s edge Eager and unafraid You are the child I used to be Playing the games I played  Now I have only a coward s heart Finding you all too dear Learning at last that love shall teach The fearless how to fear  You are so little against the sky Laughing and undismayed Oh little son by the ocean s edge I am afraid afraid  Medora C Addison  THE LOVER  You do not know the wonder I will pour on your name It will burst like thunder with all heaven for a frame I will raise it as a flame that the wind blows under I will cast myself asunder to my shame to my blame I will make a fame a wonder of your name  Paul Tanaquil   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FIRE  Love let us light A fire tonight A wood fire on the hearth  With torn and living tongues the flames leap Hungrily They catch and lift to beat their sudden wings Toward freedom and the sky The hot wood sings And crackles in a pungent ecstasy That seems half pain of death and half a vast Triumphant exultation of release That its slow life time of lethargic peace Should come to this wild rapture at the last  We watch it idly and our casual speech Drops slowly into silence Something stirs and struggles in me Something out of reach Of surface thoughts a slow and formless thing Not I but a dim memory Born of the dead behind me In my blood The blind race turns groping and faltering  Desires Only half glimpsed not understood Stir me and shake me Fires   Eunice Tietjens  Answer the fire and vague shapes pass Like shapes of wind across the grass  The red flames catch and lift Roaring and sucking in a furious blaze And a strange swift Hunger for violence is in me My blood pounds With a dark memory of age old days And mad red nights I never knew When the dead in me lived and horrid sounds Broke from their furry throats In drunken rounds Blood crazed they danced before the leaping flames While something twisted in the fire  Now as the flames mount higher  Strange pictures pass I cannot see them quite  And yet I feel them  I am in a dread Dark temple and I beat my head In maddened rite Before the red hot belly of a god Who eats his worshippers  This is a funeral pyre And one lies dead Who was my life The fat smoke curls and eddies Beckoning suttee  But the moment slips To Bacchanalian revels quick hot lips   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And leaping limbs lit by the glare Of human torches  A sudden spark Goes crackling upward followed by a shower And I am in the hills cool hills and dark Primeval as the fire The beacon flare Leaps in a roaring tower Spattering in sparks among the stars Tales of wild wars And on a distant crest Its mate makes answer  But the embers gleam Like molten metal steaming at a forge Where with rough jest Great lusty fellows Ply the roaring bellows And clang the song of labor and the dream Man builds in metal  Now the red flame steadies Softly and quietly it burns Purring and its embers wear A friendly and domestic air  This is the hearth fire home and peace at last Comfort and safety are attendant here The primal fear Is shut away to whistle in the blast   Eunice Tietjens  Beyond the doorway where the shadows twine The fire is safety and the fire is home Light warmth and food Here careless children come Filling the place with laughter And after Men make good council talk and old men spin With that great quiet of the wise Tales of dead beauty and of dying eyes  The fire is drooping now A log falls in Softly upon itself like one grown tired With ecstasy The lithe tongues sink In ash and ember And something I remember From ages gone and yet I cannot think Some secret of the end Of earth grown old and death turned friend And man who passes Like flame like light like wind across the grasses  Ah what was that A sudden terror sped Behind me in the shadows I am cold And I should like your hand to hold Now that the fire is dead Love light the lamp and come away to bed Fire is a strange thing burning in your head  Eunice Tietjens  THE UTTERANCE OF POETRY  IN the Literary Review of a recent New York Evening  Post Lawrence Mason tells whimsically of the tortures he has endured in hearing poetry read aloud Listing several different methods he says  Some chant or intone it in a dulcet sing song that woos reluctant slumber from her lair Some attack it with athletic vigor and pride themselves upon the sheer speed of their delivery Others find the summum bonum in emphasizing the beat with the deadly regularity of a metronome Still others coldly isolate and anatomize each line till there is no more savor in it than in a dried prune Others again so boggle and halt and garble and apologize and re read that the hearer is driven to madness despair or violent revolt  And he refers to a cousin whose method is none of  these his sole and sufficient guiding principle is to con  ceal from his unfortunate hearers every evidence of  versification  Mr Mason s suffering reminds me of my own experience  with a certain eminent dramatic revelator so adver  tised who for two seasons has given expensive recitals  in Chicago under the alleged patronage of women of  social prominence of whom some as I definitely ascer  tained had never consented to the use of their names  and others had consented in a mistaken impulse of  kindliness while in blessed ignorance of the man and  his art The revelator whose programs ranged from  Othello to Deburau followed the method of Mr Mason s   The Utterance of Poetry  cousin but enriched it with a kind of vocal gymnastics inherited from the elocutionary school of the eighteen seventies While the three dollar a head audience sat in silence under the infliction I amused myself during the half hour or so that a heroic sense of duty held me there in certain speculations about the simple but much abused art of reading poetry aloud  It would seem to be a rare gift the beautiful reading of poetry Even the poets themselves are often disappointing though there is usually a degree of beauty and illumination to be gained from a poet s reading of his own verse The poet instinctively emphasizes rhythm sometimes even to the point of intoning or chanting it indeed he rarely carries this too far But not all poets have good voices an accent neither too local nor too studiedly correct and a simple effective delivery  Certain poets of course it is a privilege to hear their reading is as much a work of art as the poem and the two fit together in indissoluble unity I used to feel this of Lindsay whose first reading of The Congo at POETRY S first banquet in March 1914 was a triumph in the double art But of late Lindsay has acquired bad habits his reading has become too loud and melodramatic John Masefield s very simple reading of his poems is beautiful beyond words because of that marvellous bass voice of his rich with all the sorrows of the world Carl Sandburg also has a deep toned organ in his throat which he uses with subtle simplicity in the proof of his delicate   POETRY A Magazine of Vers  rhythms The fine voice of William Butler Yeats is of higher pitch than these his quiet intoning of poetry nobly illustrates its beauty Lew Sarett s presentation of his Indian poems is their perfect and almost necessary completion Robert Frost s personality and voice also fulfil and emphasize the quality of his poems Witter Bynner has a rich voice and graceful delivery but an over precise utterance mars the effect of his reading for me Alfred Kreymborg Carlos Williams Maxwell Bodenheim each of these complements his very personal rhythm in the utterance of his poems And Padraic Colum brings to us the authentic Celtic tune he is even more of an Irishman than Mr Yeats  I wish I could say as much for the women Amy Lowell Eunice Tietjens Lola Ridge Helen Hoyt Mar jorie Seiffert Florence Frank Jean Untermeyer all these read well some of them brilliantly all simply and in rhythmic fulfilment of their poems But none of them with quite the artistic beauty which some of the men have attained  On the stage one rarely hears beautiful utterance of poetry In all my unusual experience of theatricalized Shakespeare which beginning with Edwin Booth in my sixth year includes almost every distinguished interpreter since his time I have heard only one whose reading of the lines no not reading not anything remembered and recited whose spontaneous utterance of the lines seems to me of such perfection such strange   The Utterance of Poetry  and consummate beauty as to be forever memorable and alas incomparable This was Ada Rehan to hear her as Viola or Rosalind was to be moved by a voice deep and rich like falling waters which turned English words into speech music of transcendent quality music that moved one like Kubelik s violin or Isadora Duncan s dancing  Among women Ellen Terry was perhaps Miss Rehan s closest rival but her voice was not quite so bitter sweet and there was a slight jerkiness in her delivery which gave it vitality and picturesqueness but detracted from absolute music Mary Anderson had a voice like a cello of extraordinary richness and range and a fine sense of poetic cadence but her delivery though beautiful to be remembered always with joy was more deliberate and studied leaning more to the old rhetorical school  Booth was wonderful of course my youth shone with the romantic glamour of him But it must be admitted that Booth mouthed his lines by overstressing his consonants and that his delivery was not the spontaneous utterance of perfect art but the brilliant recital of speeches learned He was a great artist of his Victorian time and his somewhat rhetorical school but he was not an originator not one of the genius illumined who strike out new times new methods  Henry Irving had a more far seeing mind but his gift was for the spectacular His speech was gusty and storm ridden his cadences churned and broken like a bold   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  skiff outriding a gale It was an adventure to listen to the lines of his Shylock the poetry was so often in danger and so unexpectedly triumphant He ranted early and often but his ranting was always in the picture always in the service of a deliberate conventionalization a planned and achieved pattern The modern poetic drama has scrapped his particular convention but we may still envy him his skill for we cannot yet claim to have established our own convention  If Booth and Irving ranted sometimes Lawrence Barrett ranted always and John McCullough was seldom above the temptation although his robust blank verse had always a certain beauty of cadence Richard Mansfield came in a time of more simple Thespian manners but he broke up the lines he had no sense of rhythm whether in Henry Fifth or Beau Brummel he spoke always prose Of all the male actors I have heard Forbes Robertson is the most assured master of poetic cadence but his reading of Shakespeare though beautiful is sophisticated and deliberate it lacks the spontaneity and also the variety which made Ada Rehan s and even Ellen Terry s a continual flaring of new fires  The Irish Players are rhythmically endowed beyond any other company of my remembrance which is not strange since Irish speech is musical with poetic cadence and these players were trained by Synge and Yeats and Lady Gregory the three poets who have used it to the highest poetic purpose This beautiful rhythmic speech has been   The Utterance of Poetry  the secret of their charm the one most potent reason for the effect of artistic unity and beauty in their rendition of the great plays of the Celtic renaissance  The subject has led me to reminiscence when inquiry was intended we have lingered with the masters instead of seeking examples in common life If few actors read poetry with due regard for the rhythm still fewer public readers have any conception of the primary principles of the art they profess even when they have freed themselves of the hideous old elocutionary tradition which deliberately destroyed poetic cadence broke up the lines and turned poetry into agonizing prose  This tradition is chiefly to blame for banishing from modern life an art which should be at least as common and friendly a pleasure and solace as music A good voice a sense of rhythm simple unexaggerated utterance all showing respect for the line and revealing the larger cadences which overlie the basic pattern such a combination may make the reading aloud of poetry in any household or group of friends a joy as fine as the excellent playing of a musical instrument  More encouragement of this art might reveal and develop exceptional talent in persons scarcely aware of it I remember an exquisite out door presentation of Ernest Dowson s Pierrot of the Minute by two young sisters who had never realized their rare gift for the most delicate musical subtleties of poetic dialogue And in the history department of the University of Chicago hides a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  certain modest professor whose reading of the Ode to a Nightingale gives his friends an experience as magnificent as Muratore ever offered with his proudest solo or Paderewski in his palmiest days  The reading of poetry should be an easily accessible delight instead of the bore which it usually is The defect chiefly to be avoided is a certain high sounding rotundity which most people assume like a toga when they start to read poetry aloud Most voices need training to be sure to develop the latent beauty in them every school should teach the proper use of this delicate musical instrument within us Given a good voice properly controlled an ear for poetic rhythm and the simplest possible observance of the pitches and tones of poetically enhanced speech and you have the beginning of good reading of poetry a beginning which practice and the stimulus of emotional and imaginative intensity may develop into high artistic beauty H M  TRANSLATING WANG WEI  Just as Tu Fu and Li Po are often spoken of in conjunction by the Chinese so are two other great poets of the T ang Dynasty Meng Hao jan and Wang Wei The latter who lived 699 759 A D is distinguished among the poets of China by a deep and beautiful optimism The melancholy that wounded Tu Fu and Meng Hao jan seems not to have touched Wang Wei beneath the surface   Translating Wang Wei  And whereas Li Po sought in wine solace from the ills and sorrows of life Wang Wei found an abiding content in the green and healing hills and in the highly humbled and attuned mysticism of Lao tzu s teaching  As a young man Wang Wei became Assistant Secretary of State but at the age of thirty one when his wife died he left his post and retired to live near Mount Chung nan Two of his poems about Mount Chung nan are published in this number both breathing the sober sweetness and simplicity of his retired life One of them begins with the line My heart in middle age found the Way the Chinese word for the Way being Tao the first character of the title of Lao tzu s book Tao Te Ching which may be translated in whole as The Way and the Exemplification Taoism appears then to have been the consolation of Wang Wei although Professor Herbert M Giles in his volume Chinese Literature declares it to have been Buddhism We realize not only from the direct statement in this one poem but from the spirit of all his poems that he had serenely accepted the Way the natural way of the universe  There was for a while a strong division between the followers of Lao tzu and the followers of Confucius Po Chu yi ridiculed Taoist doctrines in the following four lines crisply translated by Professor Giles  Who know speak not who speak know naught Are words from Lao tzu s lore What then becomes of Lao tzu s own Five thousand words or more   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The answer is that Lao tzu s words fused now with both Buddhism and Confucianism have become an integral part of the religion of China Here are two characteristic quotations from his gospel  Follow diligently the Way in your own heart but make no display of it to the world  Do nothing and all things will be done  Among the selections printed in this issue note the last two lines of the poem Answering Vice Prefect Chang a question asked in terms of complicated morality and answered in terms of simple happiness  You ask me about good and evil Hark on the lake there s a fisherman singing  This does not mean that the ideal Taoist literally did nothing As a matter of fact Wang Wei was a physician a high government official a great poet and also one of China s most illustrious painters A scroll attributed to him is on view at the Metropolitan Museum in New York His activities however were all in flow with universal forces they sang like the fisherman there was no fret no jealousy no self exaltation no irritated struggle only harmony humility exalted identity with nature a true and wide knowledge of values making him a master of words a master of the brush and a master of life Yes there was a sure gaiety in Wang Wei instanced in his Message to P ai Ti the fellow poet with whom he longed to drink again and to sing a wild   Translating Wang Wei  poem or in the verses already mentioned My Retreat at Chung nan in which he happily anticipated the day when he should meet an old wood cutter and talk and laugh and never return  In the last two lines of the poem to P ai Ti he addressed his friend according to a too frequent Chinese manner by the name of Chieh yu who was a recluse of the Ch u kingdom famous somewhat for drinking but more for stopping Confucius chariot and warning him against politics with the song  O phoenix O phoenix Virtue is corrupted What is past is past all counsel What is future may be moulded Come away Come away Politics are dangerous  And Wang Wei s reference in the final line of this same poem is to the place where he will be drinking with his friend yet Five Willows is the place named where long ago T ao Ch ien had lived another famous recluse who was both a great writer and a great drinker  The last two lines of the poem In my Lodge at Wang Ch uan after a Long Rain clear and significant as they are in themselves yet contain for the Chinese reader enriching allusion and connotation There was once a scholar Yang tzu who before he became a student of Lao tzu was highly respected and honored by his fellow men Later through the many years of his discipleship he lost his prestige and even a boor would take precedence over   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  him but he was glad because he had formerly been proud and pretentious The last line refers to a hermit who was fond of sea gulls they followed him wherever he went His father asked why they were not afraid and bade the son bring him some but next day when the hermit went out intending to take them to his father they all flew away  The poem in the group most in need of explanation because of its allusion to historic events and personages is The Beautiful Hsi shih and the last two lines of A Song of Young Girls from Lo Yang also require the following summary  During the Chou Dynasty when the Yueh kingdom was conquered by the Wu kingdom the Yueh king still held his throne and plotted to throw off the tributary yoke Aided by his able minister Fan Li he planned to distract the king of Wu with women Fan Li searched through the Yueh kingdom for girls to beguile him and came upon Hsi shih washing clothes by a lake Conquering his own love for her he fiercely persuaded her to his scheme She remained at court for some time and the Wu king in his infatuation forgot affairs of state Weakened by this means the Wu kingdom was overcome by the Yueh kingdom and Fan Li eventually accepted Hsi shih as his reward The whimsical phrasing of the line If by wrinkling their brows they can copy her beauty alludes to the fact that she had heart trouble and it was said that her drawn brows her look of gentle   Translating Wang Wei  ness in suffering which the girls of her time tried unsuccessfully to imitate made her more beautiful  One might enlarge upon references in others of the poems For instance the quatrain called Lines contains the phrase my silken window This is not a decorative adjective It merely means that before the use of paper or glass windows in China were of silk The last line of the same poem is made lovelier by knowledge that the mei or plum blossom is in China the earliest flower of spring It is interesting to know that A Song at Wei Cheng which was written for music is still popular through China as a song of farewell and that to this day since we picked willow branches at Wei Cheng means since we parted The beauty of the four lines called A Parting with its simple profound expression of the abiding presence of friendly nature and the transient presence of friendly man is heightened by the reader s response to the grace of the name Wang Sun which from a dim and ancient origin still means in China a noble hearted young scholar or sometimes lover But on the whole these T ang poems are so valid and universal in uttering beauty that they may vitally enter the poetic consciousness of a westerner still ignorant of the various allusions  Translating the work of Wang Wei and others in the Three Hundred Poems of the T ang Dynasty Dr Kiang and 1 have tried constantly to transfer the Chinese idiom into an equivalent idiom in English rather than to stress the   Poetry A Magazine of Verse  and pungency of Chinese phrasing It is erroneous to overemphasize the component I a Chinese character as to overemphasize the  component meanings of such words in English as daybreak breakfast nightfall or landscape The delicate importance of the translator s office lies in bringing from one language to another the rounded and proportioned effect of a whole poem And we conscientiously have tried to make felt in our translations the high honesty and wise humanness of poets who have in many ways and in one Wei especially lived closer to the heart of life than importunate passion brings the poets of the West  Witter Bynner  Note by the Editor Mr Bynner s preference for the line of four feet and for the four line or eight line poem is his tribute to the close prosodic structure of Chinese poetry In the translator s opinion the form he has chosen is the closest approach to the original which is possible in English  REVIEWS  A COOL MASTER  Collected Poems of Edwin Arlington Robinson with portrait frontispiece Macmillan Co Near the middle of the last century Ralph Waldo  Emerson a sentimental philosopher with a genius for a sudden twisted hardness of words wrote lines like  Daughters of Time the hypocritic days Muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes   A Cool Master  And marching single in an endless file Bring diadems and fagots in their hands  And it was with Emerson that American poetry may be said to have begun He was slight enough but at his best a master and above all a master of sound And he began a tradition that still exists  He was followed shortly by Emily Dickinson a master of a certain dowdy but undeniably effective mannerism a spinster who may have written her poems to keep time with her broom A terrible woman who annihilated God as if He were her neighbor and her neighbor as if he were God all with a leaf or a sunbeam that chanced to fall within her sight as she looked out the window or the door during a pause in her sweeping  And we we placed the hair  And drew the head erect  And then an awful leisure was  Our faith to regulate  The woman at her most terrible had the majesty of an erect corpse a prophet of unspeakable doom and she spoke through sealed lips She was greater than Emerson was one of the greatest poets of our language but was more or less in the tradition that Emerson began She and Emerson were probably the only poets of any permanently great importance who occurred in this country during their period  The tradition of New England hardness has been carried on by Mr Robinson in many ways may be said   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  to have reached its pinnacle in Mr Robinson This poet with a wider culture than his predecessors has linked a suavity of manner to an even greater desperation than that of Dickinson s The Last Night his hardness has become a polished stoniness of vision of mind  This man has the culture to know that to those to whom philosophy is comprehensible it is not a matter of the first importance and he knows that these people are not greatly impressed by a ballyhoo statement of the principles of social or spiritual salvation A few times he has given his opinion but quietly and intelligently and has then passed on to other things A man s philosophical belief or attitude is certain to be an important part of his milieu and as a part of his milieu may give rise to perceptions images His philosophy becomes a part of his life as does the country in which he was born and will tinge his vision of the country in which he was born as that country may affect his philosophy So long as he gives us his own perceptions as they arise in this milieu he remains an artist When he becomes more interested in the possible effects of his beliefs upon others and expounds or persuades he begins to deal with generalities concepts see Croce and becomes a philosopher or more than likely a preacher a mere peddler This was the fallacy of Whitman and many of the English Victorians and this is what invalidates nearly all of Whitman s work Such men forget that it is only the particular the perception that is perpetually startling The generality or concept   A Cool Master  can be pigeon holed absorbed and forgotten And a ballyhoo statement of a concept is seldom a concise one it is neither fish nor flesh That is why Whitman is doomed to an eventual dull vacuum that the intricately delicate mind of Plato will never know  Much praise has fallen to Mr Robinson because he deals with people humanity and this is a fallacy of inaccurate brains Humanity is simply Mr Robinson s physical milieu the thing the compound of the things he sees It is not the material that makes a poem great but the perception and organization of that material A pigeon s wing may make as great an image as a man s tragedy and in the poetry of Mr Wallace Stevens has done so Mr Robinson s greatness lies not in the people of whom he has written but in the perfect balance the infallible precision with which he has stated their cases  Mr Robinson s work may be classified roughly in two groups his blank verse and his more closely rhymed poems including the sonnets Of his blank verse the Octaves in The Children of the Night fall curiously into a group by themselves and will be considered elsewhere in this review The other poems in blank verse may be called sketches some of people the poet may have known some of historical figures some of legendary and they have all the evanescence brittleness of sketches However there are passages in many of these poems that anticipate Robert Frost who in at least one poem An Old Man s Winter Night has used this method with greater   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  effect than its innovator and has created a great poem Mr Frost of course leaves more of the bark on his rhythms achieves a sort of implied colloquialism which has already been too much discussed But with Frost in  mind consider this passage from Isaac and Archibald  A journey that I made one afternoon With Isaac to find out what Archibald Was doing with his oats It was high time Those oats were cut said Isaac and he feared That Archibald well he could never feel Quite sure of Archibald Accordingly The good old man invited me that is Permitted me to go along with him And I with a small boy s adhesiveness To competent old age got up and went  The similarity to Frost is marked as is also the pleasing but not profound quality of the verse It has a distinction however that many contemporaries French as well as English and American could acquire to good advantage  Ben Jonson Entertains a Man from Stratford a much praised poem seems largely garrulous occasionally brilliant and always brittle and one can go on making very similar comments on the other poems in this form until one comes to those alternately praised and lamented poems Merlin and Lancelot Remembering Tennyson one s first inclination is to name these poems great and certainly they are not inconsiderable But there are long passages of purely literary frittering and passages that while they may possess a certain clean distinction of   A Cool Master  manner are dry and unremunerative enough But there  are passages in these poems which are finer than any other  blank verse Mr Robinson has written dark massive  lines that rise out of the poem and leave one bitter and  empty  On Dagonet the silent hand of Merlin Weighed now as living iron that held him down With a primeval power Doubt wonderment Impatience and a self accusing sorrow Born of an ancient love possessed and held him Until his love was more than he could name And he was Merlin s fool not Arthur s now Say what you will I say that I m the fool Of Merlin King of Nowhere which is Here With you for king and me for court what else Have we to sigh for but a place to sleep  But passing on from this less important side of Mr Robinson s work to his rhymed poems one finds at least a large number of perfectly executed poems of a sensitive and feline approach What effect rhyme or the intention of rhyme has upon an artist s product is a difficult thing to estimate The question verges almost upon the metaphysical The artist creating lives at a point of intensity and whether the material is consciously digested before that point is reached and is simply organized and set down at the time of creation or whether the point of intensity is first reached and the material then drawn out of the subconscious doubtless depends a good deal on the individual poet perhaps on the individual poem The latter method presupposes a great deal of previous   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  absorption of sense impressions and is probably the more valid or at least the more generally effective method For the rhythm and the matter as they come into being simultaneously and interdependent will be perfectly fused and without loose ends The man who comes to a form with a definitely outlined matter will more than likely have to cram or fill before he has finished and the result is broken The second method does not of course presuppose rhyme but it seems that rhyme as an obstacle will force the issue  The best of Mr Robinson s poems appear to have come into being very much in this second fashion He has spun his images out of a world of sense and thought that have been a part of him so long that he seems to have forgot their beginning has spun these images out as the movement of his lines the recurrence of his rhymes have demanded them A basic philosophy and emotional viewpoint have provided the necessary unity  This method inevitably focuses the artist s mind upon the object of the instant makes it one with that object and eliminates practically all individual personality or self consciousness The so called personal touch is reduced to a minimum of technical habit that is bound to accrue in time to any poet who studies his medium with an eye to his individual needs The man of some intelligence who cannot or can seldom achieve this condition of fusion with his object is driven back to his ingenuity and this man if he have sufficient intelligence or ingenuity   A Cool Master  becomes one of the vigorous personalities of poetry and he misses poetry exactly in so far as his personality is vigorous Browning on two or three occasions one of the greatest of all poets is for the most part simply the greatest of ingenious versifiers He was so curious of the quirks with which he could approach an object that he forgot the object in admiring and expecting admiration for himself And it is for this reason that Mr Robinson working in more or less the same field as Browning is the superior of Browning at almost every turn  And it is for this reason also that Mr Robinson s Ben Jonson is a failure For the poet while in no wise concerned with his own personality is so intent upon the personality of Jonson his speaker that for the sake of Jonson s vigor he becomes talkative and eager of identifying mannerism and the result is that Shakespeare about whom the poem is written comes to the surface only here and there and any actual image almost never  The following stanza is an example of Mr Robinson s work at its best And like a giant harp that hums On always and is always blending The coming of what never comes With what has past and had an ending The City trembles throbs and pounds Outside and through a thousand sounds The small intolerable drums Of Time are like slow drops descending  And there is the compact intensely contemplated statement of Eros Turannos a poem that is in forty eight   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  lines as complete as a Lawrence novel And the nimble trickery of Miniver Cheevey as finished a piece of burlesque as one can find in English A few of us have feared in the last few years that Mr Robinson was deteriorating but going through this book one is reassured If there is nothing in The Three Taverns to equal Eros Turannos there are at least two or three poems as great as any save that one Mr Robinson has written and there is nothing in these last poems to preclude the possibility of another Eros Turannos  Mr Robinson as probably the highest point in his tradition has been followed by Frost a more specialized and generally softer artist And there is Gould who if he belongs to the tradition at all is a mere breaking up of the tradition a fusion with Whitman But in considering the work of a man of so varied a genius as Mr Robinson it is interesting if not over important to observe the modes of expression that he has anticipated if not actually influenced even where he has not chosen or has not been able to develop these modes  The resemblance in matter and manner save for Mr Robinson s greater suavity of certain poems especially the sonnets in The Children of the Night to the epitaphs in The Spoon River Anthology has been noted by other writers and I believe it has been said that Mr Masters was ignorant of the existence of these poems until after the Anthology was written There is little to be said about such a poem as Mr Robinson s Luke Havergal   A Cool Master  No there is not a dawn in eastern skies To rift the fiery night that s in your eyes But there where western glooms are gathering The dark will end the dark if anything God slays Himself with every leaf that flies And hell is more than half of paradise No there is not a dawn in eastern skies In eastern skies  Out of a grave I come to tell you this Out of a grave I come to quench the kiss That flames upon your forehead with a glow That blinds you to the way that you must go  And Mr Masters satire has been forestalled and outdone  in these early sonnets  But a more curious and interesting resemblance to a  later poet is found in the Octaves in the same volume  To me the groaning of world worshippers Rings like a lonely music played in hell By one with art enough to cleave the walls Of heaven with his cadence but without The wisdom or the will to comprehend The strangeness of his own perversity And all without the courage to deny The profit and the pride of his defeat  If the actual thought of this passage is not that of Wallace Stevens nevertheless the quality of the thought the manner of thinking as well as the style quite definitely is To what extent Mr Robinson may have influenced this greatest of living and of American poets one cannot say but in at least three of the Octaves one phase of Mr Stevens later work that of Le Monocle de Mon Oncle and other recent and shorter poems is certainly fore   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  shadowed Mr Robinson s sound is inevitably the less rich the less masterly  In another of the Octaves there are a few lines that suggest the earlier poems of Mr T S Eliot but the resemblance is fleeting and apparently accidental  If the tradition of New England seems to be reaching an end in the work of Mr Frost Mr Robinson has at least helped greatly in the founding of a tradition of culture and clean workmanship that such poets as Messrs Stevens Eliot and Pound as H D and Marianne Moore are carrying on Mr Robinson was when he began as much a pioneer as Mr Pound or Mr Yeats and he has certainly achieved as great poetry While the tradition begun more or less by Whitman has deteriorated in the later work of Mr Carl Sandburg into a sort of plasmodial delirium and while the school of mellifluous and almost ominous stage trappings as exemplified by Poe has melted into a sort of post Celtic twilight and has nearly vanished in the work of Mr Aiken the work of these writers and a few others stands out clear and hard in the half light of our culture I cannot forget that they exist even in the face of the desert Yvor Winters  MR YEATS PLAYS  Four Plays for Dancers by William Butler Yeats Mac  millan Co  Mr Yeats is one of the few poets writing poetic plays who are also in exact meaning men of the theatre Just   Mr Yeats Plays  as he is probably the foremost poet of his generation so he shares with Gordon Craig and one or two others the distinction of having seen furthest into the theatre as it may become That youth which in the Irish temperament is so old as to be imperishable has retained for him his leadership in the poetic drama and in the exploration of new forms Four Plays for Dancers as in its own time The Land of Heart s Desire written without adequate knowledge of the stage is the work of a pioneer bringing a form to its perfection with no apparent interval of apprenticeship  M y blunder has been he writes that I did not discover in my youth that my theatre must be the ancient theatre that can be made by unrolling a carpet or marking out a place with a stick or setting a screen against a wall When he was last in America he told us of such a theatre so intimate that its few properties could be carried by the players in a taxicab and set in a drawing room and of how he had found a first model in the Noh stage of aristocratic Japan Shortly afterward The Only Jealousy of Enter was published in POETRY and now with three other plays similar in construction it appears in book form There are also masks and costume plates by Edmond Dulac for At the Hawk s Well produced as early as 1916 in England music for the dances and songs by W M Rummel and suggestive notes on the plays and their production  Unhesitatingly one may call this book the most signifi   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  cant contribution to the art theatre that has been written in a long while True it is the art theatre in its most aristocratic phase but the best in this art as in another must sometimes in relation to audiences be aristocratic What gives to these plays their significance apart from the almost ineffable beauty with which at least two of them are written is that he has found a way by which the color the enchantment the distance and subtlety of legendary drama may be projected intimately and by a medium of amazing simplicity In doing this granting that one s insight into the effect of the plays in production is accurate he has conquered difficulties which would seem insurmountable  He has secured the illusion of distance not in despite of but through the intimacy of a small audience in contact with the players Never before in the western theatre and in no other western art except perhaps that of the story teller setting his tale directly in the imagination has such an effect been possible It is the quality of his technique the unerring sense of the theatre which seems to make this an authentic form both in these individual plays and as existing apart from them Beside it the artificial intimacy effected by Max Reinhardt becomes claptrap Restricting himself to the simplest means he has chosen them with the instinct of a poet with that same instinct which made such lines as these of the Musician  I call to the eye of the mind A well long choked up and dry And boughs long stripped by the wind   Mr Yeats Plays  And I call to the mind s eye Pallor of an ivory face Its lofty dissolute air A man climbing up to a place The salt sea wind has swept bare  In literature if we would not be parvenus we must have a model and as his theatre has been modified until it has become independent of the Noh so a new poetic drama may be liberated by his inspiration  As for the plays in relation to each other we have learned long since to expect in the work of Mr Yeats the clarity and beauty of poetic content and expression that one finds in these plays We expect it and it seldom fails the anticipation If The Dreaming of the Bones and Calvary do not seem quite to reach the height of the two others that is not to deny that they are rich in content also But there is a beauty lacking in them purity of inspiration replaced by what is not far from propaganda in the one and from an over subtle interpretation in the other The mood has flagged somewhat after the splendor of utterance in At the Hawk s Well and The Only Jealousy of Emer These are incomparable  Postcript to Little Theatres These plays when you read them may not appear difficult to present what with the elaborate stage directions and the photographs But I fear that you would find them impossible lacking a Yeats a Dulac and a Michio Itow who are indispensable And it would be a mistake to confuse this theatre   POETRY A Magazine of Ferse  in any way with the theatre of Jacques Copeau which is also admirable Mr Yeats has not abandoned the mise en scene he has intensified it And incidentally he has given us when we are ready for it one kind of synthetic theatre including even the management of light  Cloyd Head  NOTES  Wang Wei the famous poet painter who
