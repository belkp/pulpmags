Mark Twain was tir t of all a lecturer, almost before he began to write. In this book are some of his earliest humorous lectures and speeches. These speeches are all humorous in their style and method. They show one remarkable thing about Mark Twain s work, he never repeats himself. It naturally follows that these addresses cover almost every conceivable subject, from weather and women to politics and fishing. The book has an Introduction by  V. D. Howell', and also a Preface written by Mark Twain him-elf. This page is one of the most characteristic bits he ever wrote. The speeches of Mark Twain, in point of time, cover a little more than half of hi.-, life. Many of them were delivered at important occasion'. Here will be found the speech delivered at Oxford when he received the Doctor degree from that university, sjieeches at various birthday dinners, the address delivered at the Aldrich Memorial meeting, etc. Crown Svri, red cloth.

Because this novel is oj a totally different kind, the author lias taken an assumed name that the hook may be received wholly on its merits, A humanly told story that suggests a profound question. Uoth the hero and heroine are normal, likable people; but they are forced by circumstances to take an unusual view of love and marriage. The hero is an ex-convict who has submitted to imprisonment to save his brother, an older man with wife and children. On his release he drifts to a little village in the Kentucky mountains, where he becomes a railroad bookkce  cr. Here he meets the heroine  a girl of great beauty and naturally happy disposition who is as unfortunate in her way as the man is in hi . Her father, a violent, unreasonable man, has made her life unbearable ever since her elopement with the son of his mortal enemy in a Kentucky feud. The father brings her home, causes the youthful lover to flee, and treats the  irl as hopelessly dishonored. Drawn together by mutual sympathy, the man and the uirl form a warm friendship. A railroad superintendent discovers the man's identity and dismisses him. At the same time the girl decidcs that her home life can no longer be endured. Together they leave the village for New York. On the train they are taken for man and wife to escape the girt   pursuers. With- out the reality of marriage, they arc united by a closer, stronger bond than are most married people. It is from this unique situation that the splendid story develops. Post, Svo, cloth. Si.JO net.

" Strife." Here is a slight example of his simple, vivid delineation of charac- ter taken from  A Motley": r "The owner of that head could not but be endowed with force, sagacity, humor, and the sense of justice. It expressed, indeed, his essential quality equanimity; for there were two men in him he of the chin and jaw. a man of tenacity and action, and he of the nose and brow, the man of speculation and impersonality: yet these two were so curiously balanced and blended that there was no harsh ungraceful con- flict. And what made this equanimity so memorable was the fact that both his power of action and his power of speculation were of high quality." Some of the titles in this volume are:  A Eisiier of Min." "A Beast of Birdex,  "Tiie Prisoner," "For Ever," "Coi rai;e," "The Choice,  "The Palk." "A Reversion to Type," " Jov   r Life." etc. In all of them he shows the same power and strength of imagina- tion and ideas, and the same fearlessness in handling the questions of the day, that have won him distinction not only as a literary artist of the first rank but also as a thinker and a poet.

And it wasn't only writing; it was writing and rewriting anti writing again. His copy looked like a patch-quilt when he got through with it." This, however, applies to only a comparative- ly few pages of the MS. The surprising thing al  ut most of it wa-s its remarkable freedom from interlineations and corrections. It seems to have been written with the direct- ness and full knowledge that one might cxpect of work done in the quid of the library. It is only another instance of the author's tremendous low- ers of concentration and ability to absorb himself completely in the immediate theme in hand. If it is possible that there is still any doubt in the mind of a few that Mr. Roosevelt is. first of -all, the naturalist and real lover of nature, a reading of the licautilul description of the com- ing of spring in America, in the June number, and many oilier similar paragraphs, will be con elusive evidence to the contrary. As Fore l and Stream well says:  vik. roosf.velt s other side  It is not generally known though it ought to be that Mr. Roosevelt, while a good hunter, mountaineer, prairie man, and now African traveller, is at heart a naturalist anti enjoys few things so much as the observation of nature. Xo man but a close observer, and one whose soul drinks in with keen enjoyment the beauties of the American spring, could have written in Africa this description.  In the September number he will describe his hunting of  The  ireat Rhinoceros of the I.ado," the square-mouthed or  So-called white rhinoceros, utterly different from the ordinary African  kind. As in every one of his articles, there are many line passages showing his quick response to and appreciation of the picturesque. The following gives an impression of the night journey down the great While Xile:  As night fell we entered the White Xile, and steamed and driitcd down the mighty stream. Its t urrent swirled in long curves between endless ranks of plumed papyrus. White and blue, and red, the lloating water- lilies covered the lagoons and the still inlet' among the reeds; and here and there the lotus lifted its leaves and flowers stiffly above the surface. The brilliant tropic stars made lanes of light on the lapping water as we ran on through the night The river horses reared from the reed l eds, anti snorted and plunged Iteside ihe Itoat, ami crocodiles slipped sul- lenly into the rivei as we glided by. Toward morning a mist arose anti through it the crescent of the dying muon shone red and lurid. Then the sun ilamed aloft anti soon the African landsca  c, vast, lonely, mysterious, stretchcd on every side in a shimmering glare of heat anti light: and ahead of us the great, strange river went twisting away into the distance." UAGAZ XE XOTFS The old adage that "truth is stranger than fiction    was never better or more convincingly exempli bed than in the life of General Frederick Funston. The story of his career has material enough in it for a whole shelf full of novels of adventure, and it would he hard to find a par- allel even in the most romantic fiction. In the September number General Funston will begin the narrative of his lighting experiences with insurgents under General Gomez. In this first article he tells of how he happened to enlist as an officer of artillery, of the preparation for the expedition, the sailing of the famous blockade runner Du toilless, under Captain  Dynamite  O'Brien, and the hazardous landing on Cuban shores. General Funston has the rare gift of letting his readers see from the inside. There is no effort at any dramatic effect in the man- ner of his writing, but the impression is all the greater. True in every word, it has the qualities that we are accustomed to associate with the best modern stories of imaginary soldiers of fortune.  The Spaniards do nut tight revolutionists with rose water. Filibus- tering in those days was grim and terrible busi- ness,  One of John Fox, Jr s earliest anil most widely read stories contained only seven hun- dred and fifty words.   Heil-fer-Sartain,' was published next to the advertisements in a cer- tain American weekly.  Mr. Fox has recently made a journey on horseback to the scene of the story, and tells about it in an article to appear in September, which he calls "On the Road to Heil-fer-Sartain.  The journey lay- through the country of some of the most no- torious feuds that have kept the Kentutky moun- taineers in the lime-light from time to time. "I had been to Heil-fer-Sartain. If there be for the erring the good old-fashioned place in whi  h the preacher over on that creek had such faith. I may. in spite of myself, get there, but willingly to either place never   The unfailing enthusiasm that followed Mr. Roosevelt everywhere in Europe was due both to the absolute sincerity of his utterances and t .1 the fact that he "personifies an c m i h of American history.  In no country was lie re- ceived with greater interest than in France. William Morton Fullerton, the well-known Paris correspondent of the London Times, has written an article for the September number dealing with Mr Roosevelt in France    f the impression made upon the French people, he says: " During the last forty years three foreigners have aroused the imagination of Frenchmen: The Czar Nicolas II, King Edward VII, and Theodore Roosevelt. The Czar and the King of Fngland have exerted an incalculable influ- ence on French history. There are signs that the coming of Mr. Roosevelt may entail conse- quences which will be no less inextricably woven into the tissue of contemporary French annals. . . . Mr. Roosevelt justified Frenchmen to them- selves. Mr. Roosevelt came to a Europe which was sick and very weary of talk, perpetual talk, altout rights; and it listened with avidity and hope to a man who sj oke of duties, and spoke of them plainly and emphatically.  It is much more than a mere personal appre- ciation; the writer has been a student of French politics and he has sought for and pointed out the immense value and national significance of the effect of the friendly plain shaking of Mr. Roosevelt. A striking tribute to the value Frenchmen put upon the ex-President s words w.i. the fact that the Temps has had the address given at the University of Paris distributed among some fifty thousand school-teachers. To most of us who by chance take the trouble to look on the map to see where the Panama Canal is being built, it probably takes on the aspect of some great waterway like the Hudson, with the Palisades as the shores. Just what it means to dig a navigable ditch through the tail of the continent is one of the things that only the engineer or an cve-witness can under- stand. That it is a stupendous and costly under- taking is made evident by the reports that now and then get into the newspapers, but what it means in human terms, judged from the indi- vidual point of view, is hard to imagine. After all, once the engineering problem is defined, the most interesting part of the work is that done by the men who day after day are digging their way through from one ocean to another. William Hamden Foster, the artist who has but recently returned from the Isthmus, went there with the express purjvjse of studying this as- pect of the work,and in   The Canal Builders,  to appear in September, he tells his story. He was lirsi of all impressed with the system and in- comprehensible detail, the  immeasurable" greatness of it all Mr. I- oster ha  made a numl erof paintings of scenes alonj; the canal, and these will l e repro- duced in colors imply a symbol of the purity of FAIRY SOAP.

I managed my escape from him this morning by renouncing hath and breakfast; and what a reliei, to be in the railway carriage alone  that is, when the engine snorted. And if I set eyes on him within a week, he will hear some truths. His idea of mar- riage is, thc taking of the woman into cus- tody. My hat is on, and on goes Pluricl s.

Now th.il is really masterly fun, my dear: most ireditalile to you I Love, marriage, a iroop of suitors, and Uncle Homeware. No, it would not have oc- curred to me, and I am considered to have some humor. Of course he disjjoses of them. He seemed lo have a fairly favor- able opinion of Mr. Arden. Astr ra. I do not share it. He is the least respectful of the sentiments enter- tained by me. Pray, spare me the mention of him, as you say of your husband. He has that pitiful conceit in men. which sets them thinking that a woman must needs lie susceptible to the declaration of the mere existence of their passion. He is past argu- ment- Impossible for him to conceive a woman's having a mind above the rendi- tions of her m-x. A woman, according to him, can have no ideal of life, except as a ball to toss in the air anil catch in a cup. Put him aside. We creatures are doomed to marriage, and if we shun it. we are a kind of cripple. He i" grossly earthy in his view of us. We are unable to move a step in thought or act unless we submit to have a husband. That is his reasoning. Nature  Nature  I have to hear of Nature  We must be above Nature, I tell him. or we shall be very much below. He is ranked among our clever young men; and he can Ik  amusing. So far he passes muster; and he has a pleasant voice. 1 dare say he is an Uncle Homeware's good sort of boy. Girls like him. Why does he not fix his atten- tion ujKin one of them  Why upon me  We waste our time in talking of him. The secret of it is. that he has no reverence. The marriage he vaunts is a mere conven- ient arrangement for two to live together under command of Nature. Reverence for the state of marriage is unknown to him. How explain my feeling  1 am driven in to silence. Cease to sjieak of him. He is the dupe of his eloquence his passion, he rails it 1 have only to trust myself to him, and I shall Ik- one of the world s married women  W on Is are useless. How am I     make him see that it is I who respect the state of marriage by refusing; not he by perpetually soli iting. Once married, mar- ried forever. Widow is but a term. When women hold their own against him. as I have done, they will   e more esteemed 1 have resisted and conquered. I am sorry I do not share in the opinion of your fav- orite. Lyra. Mine  I Inra.

Romantic ideas arc for dreamy simperers. Lyra. Amazons repudiate them. Astraa. Laugh at me, half my time I am laughing at myself. I should regain my pride if I could be resolved on a step. I am strong to resist ; 1 have not strength to move. Lyra. 1 see the sphinx of Kgypt  A it ran. And all the while I am a manu- factory of gunjwwdcr in this quiet old- world Sabbath circle of dear good souls, with their stereotyped interjections and or- chestra of enthusiasms; their tapering deli- cacies; the rejoicing they have in their com- mon agreement on all created things. To them it is restful. It spurs me to fly from rooms and chairs and beds and houses. I sleep hardly a couple of hours. Then into the early morning air, out with the birds; I know no other pleasure.

He fed gobble-gobble on your pulTs of incense. I coughed and scraped the gravel; quite in vain; he tap ted for more and more. Astraa. Professor Spiral is a thinker; he is a sage. He gives women their due. Lyra. And he is a bachelor too or con- sequently. A straa. If you like you may be as play- ful with me as the Lyra of our maiden days used to be.

With a kind courtesy which 1 cannot too highly appret iate he, wilh the equally cordial help of another settler. Mr. Skally also a South African, but of Irish birth and of the District Commissioner, Mr. Cor- bett, had arranged for a party of Nandi warriors to rome over and show me how they hunted the lion. Two Dutch farm rrs, Boers, from the neighborhood, had also come; they were Messrs. Mouton and Jordaan. line fellows both, the former hav- ing served with DeWct during the war. Mr. and Mrs. Corbett who were hospi- tality itself had also come to see the s  ort; and so had Captain Chapman, an Knglish army officer who was taking a rest after several years  service in Northern Nigeria. The Nandi are a warlike pastoral tribe, v lo e kin to the Masai in blood and tongue, in weapons and in manner of life. They have long lieen an ustomed to kill with the sjtear lions which become man eaters or which molest their cattle overmuch. and the peace whi  h British rule has imposed ujion them a   eace welcome to the weaker, so irksome to the predatory, tribes has left lion killing one of the- few pursuits in which glory can be won by a young war- rior When it was told them that if they wished they could come to hunt lions at     - pyri Kt. i i c  by   lurlc Sfriboef'  vw r t. New York, tT J-    AH    a: ' - including  '  IraittUtkm into including Ihc S Andiia ian Sergoi eight hundred warriors volunteered, and much heartburning was caused in choosing the sixty or seventy who were al- lowed the privilege. They stipulated, how- ever, that they should not be used merely as beaters, but should kill the lion themselves, and refused to come unless with this under- standing. The day Ix-fore we reached Sergoi they had gone out, and had killed a lion and lioness; thc beasts were put up from a small covert and despatched with the heavy throwing spears on the instant, before they offered, or indeed had the chance to offer, any resistance The day after our arrival there was mist and cold r.iin. and we found no lions. Next day, Novemlier 20th, wc were successful. We started immediately after breakfast. Kirke, Skally, Mouton, Jordaan, Mr. and Mrs. Corbett. Captain Chapman, and our party, were on horseback; of course we carried our rides, but our duty was merely to round up the lion and hold him, if he went off so far in advance that even the Nandi runners could not overtake him. We intended to beat thc country toward some shallow, swampy valleys twelve miles distant. In an hour wc overtook the Nandi war riors. who were advancing across the roll- ing, grassy plains in a long line, wilh in- tervals of six or eight yards between the men. They were splendid savages, stark naked, lithe as panthers, the muscles rip- pling under their smooth dark skins; all their lives they had lived on nothing but animal Si 1  i vi. N-.r : _   Tli e article arc fully pnvtectctl nrwlcr fhe new copyright law in        t July in. ima, which impose  a severe penalty infringement. African Game Trails food, milk, blood, and flesh, and they were lit fur any fatigue or danger. Their faces were proud, cruel, fearless; as they ran they moved with long springy strides. Their head-dresses were fantastic; they carried ox-hide shields painted with strange devices; and each bore in his right hand the formidable war sj ear, used both for stabbing and for throwing at dose quar- ters. The narrow s  car heads of soft iron were burnished till they shone like silver; they were four t'eet lung, and the point and edges were razor sharp. The wooden haft appeared for but a few inches; the long butt was also of iron, ending in a spike, so that the sjtcar looked almost solid metal. Yet each sinewy warrior carried his heavy weapon as if it were a toy, twirling it till it glinted in the sun rays. Herds of game, red hartebeests and sirij cd zebra and wild swine, tied riiiht and left before the ad- vance of the line. It was noon before we reached a wide, shallow valley, with beds of rushes here and there in the middle, and on either side high grass and dwarfed and scattered thorn- trees. Down this we beat for a couple of miles. Then, suddenly, a maned lion rose a quarter of a mile ahead of the line and galloped off through the high grass to the right; and all of us un horseback tore after him. He was a magnificent beast, with a black and tawny mane; in his prime, teeth and daws  jerfect, with mighty thews, and sav- age heart. He was lying near a harteltcest on which he hail licen feasting; hi  life had l een one unbroken career of rapine and violence; and now the maned master of the wilderness, the terror that stalked by night, the grim lord of slaughter, was to meet hi.-, doom at the hands of the only f  es who dared molest him. It was a mile before we brought him to bay. Then the Dutch farmer, Muuton. who had not even a ritlc, but who r nle fore- most. was almost on him; he halted and turned under a low thorn-tree, and wc gal- loped past him to the opposite side, to hold him until the spearmen could come. It was a sore temptation to shoot him; but of course we could not break faith with our Xandi friends. We were only some sixty yards from him. and we watched him with our rifles ready, lest he should charge either us, or the first two or three spearmen, before their companions arrived. One by one the spearmen came up, at a run, and gradually began to form a ring round him. Kadi, when he came near enough, crouched Iteliind his shield, his spear in his right hand, his fierce, eager face peering over the shield rim. As man followed man, the lion rose to his feet. His mane bristled, his tail lashed, he held his bead low, the up  er lip now drooping over the jaws, now drawn up so as to show the gleam of the long fangs, I le faced first one way and then another, and never ceased to utter his murderous grunting roars. It was a wild sight; the ring of sjiearmen, in- tent, silent, bent on blood, and in the centre the great man-killing beast, his thunderous wrath growing ever more dangerous. At last the tense ring was complete, and the spearmen rose and closed in, The lion looked quickly from side to side, saw where the line was thinnest, and charged at his topmost speed. The crowded moment be- gan. With shields held steady, and quiver- ing spears poised, the men in front braced themselves for the rush and tile shock; and from either hand the warriors sprang for- ward to take their fix in flank. Hounding ahead of his fellows; the leader reached throwing distance, the long spear flickered and plunged; as the li.rn felt the wound he hall turned, and then llung himself on the man in front. The warrior threw his spear; it drove deep into the life, for entering at one shoulder it came out of the opj osite ilank, near the thigh, a yard of steel through the great body. Rearing, the lion struck the man, bearing down the shield, his ba  k arched; and for a moment he slaked his fury with fang and talon. But on the in slant I saw another sjjear driven dear through his body from side to side; and as the lion turned again the bright spear blades darting toward him were flashes of white llamc. The end had come. He seized another man, who stabbed him ami wrenched loose. As he fell he gripped a sj car head in his jaws with sudi tremen- dous force that he bent it double. Then the warriors were round and over him, stubbing and shouting, wild with furious exultation. From the moment when he charged until his death I doubt w hether ten seconds had elapsed, perhaps less; but what a ten 144 African Game Trails seconds  The first half dozen spears had done the work. Three of the spear blades had gone clcar through the body, the fmints projecting several inches; 3nd these, and one or two others, including the one he had seized in his jaws, had been twisted out of shape in the terrible death struggle. We at oncc attended to the two wounded men. Treating their wounds with anti- septic was painful, and so, while the ojxxa- tion was in progress, I told them, through Kirke, that I would give each a heifer. A Nandi prizes his cattle rather more than his wives; and each sufferer smiled broadly at the news, and forgot all about the pain of his wounds. Then the warriors, raising their shields above their heads, and t hanting the deep- toned victory song, marched with a slow, darn ing step around the dead body of the lion; and this savage dame of triumph ended a scene of as fierce interest and ex- citement as I ever hope to see. The Nandi marched bat k by themselves, carrying the two wounded men on their shields. We rode to camp by a round- about way. on the chance that we might see another lion The afternoon waned ami we cast long shadows before us as we rode across the vast lonely plain. The game stared at us as we passed; a cold wind blew iti our faces, and the tall urass waved cease- lessly, the sun set behind a sullen cloud bank, and then, just at nightfall, the tents glimmered white through the dusk. When we left Nairobi it was with real regret that we slid good-by to the many friends who had been so kind to us; offi- cials, private   ili .ens, almost every one we had met including Sir Percy Girouard, tin- new governor. At kijal e the men and women from the  merican Mission and the children t x  were down at the station 1m wish us good luck; and at Nakuru the settlers from the neighborhood gathered on the platform to give us a farewell cheer. The following morning we reached Kisumu on Lake Victoria Nyanza. It is in the Kavirondo country, where the natives, l  th men and women, as a rule go absolutely naked, although they are peaceable and in- dustrious In the native market they had brought, in baskets, iron spade heads, and food, to sell to the native and Indian trailers who had their booths round about; the meat market, under the trees, was espe- cially interesting. At noon we embarked in a smart little steamer, to cross the lake. Twenty-four hours later we landed at Kntebbe, the seat of the Knglisli Governor of Uganda. Through- out our passage the wind hardly rultled the smooth surface of the lake. As we steamed awav from the eastern shore the mountains l ehind us and on our right hand rose harsh and barren, yet with a kind of forbidding beauty. Dark clouds hung over the land wc had left, and a rainbow stretched across their front. At nightfall, as the red sunset faded, the lonely waters of the vast inland sea stretched, ocean-like, west and south into a shoreless gloom. Then the darkness dee  ened, the tropic stars blazed overhead, and the light of the half moon drowned in silver the embers of the sunset. Next morning we steamed along and across the equator; the last time wc were to cross it, for thenceforth our course lay northward. We passed by many islands, green with meadow and forest, lieautiful in the bright sunshine, but empty with the emptiness of death. A decade previously these islands were thronged with tribes of fisher folk ; their villages studded the shores, and their long canoes, planks held together with fibre, furrowed the surface of the lake. Then, from out of the depths of the Congo forest came the dreadful scourge of the sleeping sickness, and smote the doomed people who dwelt beside the Vic- torian Nile, and on the coasts of the Nyanza Lakes and in the lands between. Its agent was a biting lly, brother to the tsetse whose bite is fatal to domestic animals. This tly dwells in forest, beside lakes and rivers; and wherever it dwells after the sleeping sickness came it was found that man could not live. In this country, between, and along the shores of, the great lakes, two hundred thousand people died in slow tor- ment, before the liard-taxed wisdom ami skill of medical science and governmental administration could work any betterment whatever in the situation. Men still die by thousands, and the disease is slowly spread- ing into fresh districts. But it has proved jiossible to keep it within limits in the regions already affected, yet onlv by ab- solutely abandoning certain districts , and by clearing all the forest and brush in tracts which serve as barriers to the lly, and which i h  N. r .ii iliixt the spcu rtl Iumi I . u.   ' l Ken  I jiermit passage through the infected belts.   n the western shores of   i. toria Nyanza, and in the islands adjacent thereto, the ravage  of the pestilence were such, the mortality it caused was so appalling, that the Government was tinally forced to de- j ort all the survivors inland, to forbid all residence beside or fishing in the lake, anti with this end in view to destroy the villages and the fishing fleets t if the people. The teeming lake fish were formerly a main source of food supply to all who dwelt near by; but this has now been cut off, and the myriads of fish are left to themselves, to the hosts of water birds, and to the mon- strous man-eating crocodiles of the lake, on whose blood the fly also feeds, anti whence it U supposed by some that it draws the germ.-' so deadly to human kind. When we landed there was nothing in the hot, laughing, tropical beauty oi the land to .suggest the grisly horror that brood- ed so near. In green luxuriance the earth lay under a cloudless sky. yielding her in- crease to the sun s burning caresses, anti men and women were living their lives and doing their work well and gallantly. At Entebl e we stayed with the at ting- Governor. Mr Boyle; at Kampalla with the- 1Jistrict Commissioner, Mr Knowles: both of them veteran administrators, and the latter also a mighty hunter: and lxith of them showed us even- courtesy, and treated u  with all possible kindness, hn- Vt.i_ xmu. ib tebl e is a pretty little town of English residents, chiefly officials; with well-kept roads, a golf course, tennis courts, anti an attractive club house. The whole place is I lowered in llowers, on tree, bush, and vine, of every hue masses of lilac, purple, yel- low, blue, ami fiery crimson. Kampalla is the native town, where the little King of I'ganda, a boy. lives, arid his t hiefs of slate, and where the native council meets; and it is the headquarters of the missions, both Church of England and Roman Catholic. Kampalla is an interesting place; anti so is all Uganda. The first explorers who l enetraicd thither, hall a century ago, found in thi- heathen state, of almost pure negroes, a veritable semi-civilization, or advanced barbarism, comparable to that of the little Arah-negro or Berber-negro sul- tanates strung along the southern edge of the Sahara, anti contrasting sharply with the weltering savagery which surrounded it, anti which stretched away without a break for many huiulrcds of miles in every direc- tion. The   eople were industrious tillers of the soil, who owned sheep, goats, and some i attle; they wore decent clothing, and hence were styled   womanish  by the sav- ages of the I pper Nile region, who prided themselves on the nakedness of their men as a proof of manliness; they were unu- usally intelligent ami ceremoniously cour- teous; anti, most singular of all, although the monarch was a t ruel despot, of the  45 African Game Trails usual African  whether Mohammedan or heathen  t   e, there were certain excellent governmental lustoms, of binding obser- vance. which in the aggregate might almost be called an unwritten   onstitution. Alone among the natives of tropical Africa thc people of Uganda have proved very acces- sible to  'hristian teaching, so that the creed of Christianity is now dominant among them. For their good fortune, England man's country, ami the prime need is to build up a large, healthy population of true white settlers, white home makers, who shall take the land as an inheritance for their children s children. Uganda can never be this kind of white man s country; and although planters and merchants of the right type can undoubtedly do well there to the advantage of the country as well as of themselves it must remain es-  lr Ri' evch and   ne -if the Natul. fr-in a   bi t gr  6 t v Kcttmt li-  cr 4r has established a protectorate over them Most wisely the English Government otfi   i:ils. and as a rule the missionaries, have bent their energies to developing them along their own lines, in government, dress, and wavs of life; constantly striving to bet- ter them and bring them forward, but not twisting them aside from their natural line of development, nor wrenching them loose from what was good in their past, by at- tempting the impossible task of turning an entire native population into blat k English- men at one stroke The problem  ct to the governing easte- rn I'ganda is totally different from that which offer  itself in British East Africa. The highlands of Hast Africa form a white sentially a black man s country, and the i hief task of the offu ials of the intrusive and masterful race must la  to bring for- ward the natives, to train them, and above all to help them train themselves, so that they mac advance in industry, in learning, in morality, in capa  itv for self-government for it is id  - to talk of  giving  a peo- ple self-government; the gift of the forms, when the inward spirit is lacking, is mere folly; all that can lie done is palicntlv to help a people acquire the necessary   uali- ties so  ial. moral, intellectual, industrial, and lastly   olitical and meanwhile to ex  erase for their benefit, with justice, sym- pathy, and firmness, the governing ability which as yet they themselves lack. The I-mu.    iiuilit Tfe ih l     lu.tiit.I llxIUir widely spread rule of a strong F.uroj ean race in lands like Africa gives, as one in- cident thereof, the chance for nascent cult- ures. nxsccnt semi-civilization-, to de- velop without fear of being overwhelmed in the surrounding gulfs of savagery: and this aside from the dircct stimulus to de- velopment conferred by the consciously and unconsciously exercised intluencc of the white man, wherein there is much of evil, but much more of ultimate good. In any region of widespread savagery, the chances for the growth of each sell- produced civilization are necessarily small, l ccausc each little centre of effort toward this end is always e.   osed to destruction from the neighboring masses of pure savagery; and therefore progress is often immensely accelerated by out- idc invasion and control. In Africa the control and guidance i  needed as much in the things of the spirit as in the things of the body. Those who com plain of or rail at missionary work in Africa, and who confine themselves to  Kiinting out the undoubtedly too nu- merous errors of the missionaries and shortcomings of their docks, would do well to consider that even if the light which has been let in is but feeble and gray it has at least disjiellcd a worse than Stygian darkness.

We visited the Church of England Mis- sion, where we were received by Bishop Tucker, and the two Catholic Slissions. where we were received by Bishops Han- lon and Streichcr; we went through the i him lies and saw the schools with the pu- pils actual   at work In all the missions we were received wilh American and Brit- ish tlags and listened to the children sing- ing "The Star spangled Banner."

At din- ner at Mr. Knowles' -, Bishop Tucker gave us exceedingly interesting details of his past e.  jeriences in Uganda, and of the prog- ress of the missionary work. He had been much amused by an American missionary who had urged him to vi-.it America, saying that he would " find the latch-string outside the door"; to an American who knows the country districts well the ex- pression seems so nat ural that I had never even realized that it was an Americanism. At Bishop Hanlon's Mission, where 1 lunched with the bish- op, there was a friend. Mother Paul, an Amer- ican. before I left  mcri  a I had promised that I would surely see her, and look into the work whit It die.and the sisters associ atcd with her, were doing.

I met his native advisers, shrewd, powerful looking men: and went into the Council Chamber, where I was greeted by the council, sub- stantial looking men. well dressed in the native fashion, and representing all the districts of the kingdom. When we visited the king it was after dark, and we were received by smart looking black soldiers in ordinary khaki uniform, while at om- panving them were other attendants dressed in the old-time native fashion: men with darning tori hes. and other- with the big Uganda drums which they beat to an accompaniment of wild i ries. T h e s e  1 r u m s are characteristic of Uganda: each chief ha  one. and beats upon it his own pectdiar tat- too.

Alilvu laifiu  with turban.-; and there were Indian and Swahili and even Arab and Persian traders. Thc houses had mud walls and thatched roofs. The gardens were .surrounded by braided cane fences. In the garden  and along the streets were many trees; among them bark cloth trees, from which the bark is stripped every year for doth; great in- cense trees, the sweet-scented gum oozing through wounds in the bark; ami date palms, in the fronds of which hung the nests of thc golden weaver birds, now breeding. White cow herons, tamer than barnyard fowls, accompanied the cattle, perching on their backs, or walking beside them. Beau- tiful Kavirondo crancs came familiarly round thc houses. It was all strange and attractive. Birds sang everywhere. The air was heavy with the fragrance of flow- ers of many colors; thc whole place was us. The situlunga is closely related to thc bushbuck but is bigger, with very long hoofs, and shaggy hair like a water buck. It is exclusively a beast of the marshes, making its home in the thick reed beds, where the water is deep; and it is exceed- ingly shy, so that very few white men have shot, or even seen, it. Its long hoofs en- able it to go over the most treacherous ground, and it swims well; in many of its haunts, in the thii k papyrus, the water is waist deep on a man. Through the papy- rus. and the reeds and marsh grass, it makes well beaten paths. Where it is in any danger of molestation it is never seen abroad in the daytime, venturing from the safe cover of the high reeds only at night; but fifty milc  inland, in the marsh grass on the edge of a big papyrus swamp, Ker- mit caught a glimpse of half a dozen feeding in the open, kneedeep in water, long after African Game Trails sunrise   n the hunt in question a pat  h of m.'ir .h was driven by a hundred natives, while the gun  were -trung along the likely passe  which Ini to another patch of marsh.

Its stomach contained not gras- but the leaves and twig tips of a shrub which grows in and along- side of the marshes. The day after this hunt our safari started on it- march north-westward to Lake Al- bert Nyanza We had taken with us from East Africa our gun-bearers. tent boys, and the men whom the naturalists had trained as skinner.' The jiorter- were men of Uganda: the askaris were from the con- stabulary. and widely different races were represented among them, but all had been drillc-d into soldierly uniformity. The j or- ters were well-clad, well-behaved, fine- looking men, and did their work better than the "shenzis.  the wild Meru or kikiu l it Ii    A-     ,'  i  Ii It Ki-rtllit K   tribesmen, whom we had occasionally em ployed in Mast Africa: but they were nut the equals of the regular Hast African por- ters I think this was largely bccause of their inferior food, for they ate rhietly vam- and plantains: in other words in- ferior sweet  Miiatoes and bananas. They were ijuite a  fond of singing as the East , fri  an    rler-. and in addition wore cheered on the march by drum and fife; several men had fifes, and one carried noth- ing but one of the big Uganda drums, which he usually bore at the head of the safari, marching in company with the flag- liearer. Every hour or two the men would halt, often   cside one of the queer little wicker-work booths in which native huck- sters disposed of their wares by the road- side. Along the road we often met wayfarers: once or twice bullock carts; more often nun t arrying rolls of hides or long bales of cotton on ihcir heads; or a set of Bahima herdsmen, with clear-cut feat- ures, guarding their herds of huge-horned Angola cattle. All greeted us most courteously, fre- quently crouching or kneeling, as is their custom when they salute a superior; and we were scrupulous to acknowledge their salutes, ami in return their greetings in the native fashion, with words of courtesy and long-drawn e-h-h-s and aa-h-s. Along the line of march the chiefs had made preparations to receive us. Each afternoon, as we came to the sjKit where we were to camp for the night, we found a cleared space strewed with straw anti surrounded by a plaited reed fence. Within this space cane houses, with thatched roofs of coarse grass, had Ix-cn erected, some for our stores, one for a kitch- en. one. which was always decked with ilowers, as a rest house for ourselves; the latter with tijH-n sitles. the roof up- held by cane pillars, so that it was cool and comfortable, and afforded a welcome shel- ter. either from the burning sun if the weather was clear, t r from the  telling, driving tropical storms if there was rain. The moon was almost full when we left Kam- palla, and night after niyht it leni a half unearthly beauty to the tropical landscape. Sometimes in the evenings the mosqui- toes bothered us; more often they did not; but in any event we slept well under our nettings.

Sometimes he came in a riik- shaw, sometime.-, in a kind of wickerwork palanquin, sometimes on foot. When we left his territory wc made him a return gift. Wc avoided all old camping grounds, bec ause of the spirillum tick. 'I'his danger- ous fever tick is one of thc insect scourges of Uganda, for its bite brings on a virulent spirillum fever which last- intermittently for months, and may be aoompanied by partial paralysis. It is common on old camping grounds, and in native village- The malarial mosquitoes also abound in places; and repeated attacks of malaria pave the way forbluck water fever, which is often fatal. The lir.-t day's march from Ranipalla led us through shambas. the fields of sweet potatoes and plantations of bananas Ini rig separated by hedges or bv cane fences. Then for two or three day.- we passed over low hills and through swamp  valleys, thc whole landscape covered by a sea ot ele- phant gra-s. the close growing, coarse blades more than twice the height of a man on horseback. Here and there it was dotted with groves of strange trees: in these groves monkeys of various kinds some black, Mime red-tailed, some auburn  chattered as they raced away among the branches; there were brilliant rollers and bee-eater-; little green and yellow parrots, 1 S3 Colonel Koo cvetf m the  4  hr Wlntr lather  fcm    Ju i'  npk k nmi K           anil gray parrots with red tails; and many colored butterflies.    nce or twice we saw the handsome, liene, short-tailed eagle, tile liaielcur eagle. an l st ared one from a reed  iui k fawn it had killed Among the com- mon birds there were black drongos, and musical hush shrikes; small black magpies with brown tails; whiteheaded kites and slate-colored sparrow-hawks: palm swifts, big hombills, blue and mottled king fish- ers, which never went near the water, and had their upper mandibles red and their under ones black: barltets, with swollen, sawtoothed bilb. their plumage iridescent purple above and red below; bulbuls, also dark purple above and ml below, which whistled and bubbled incessantly as they hop  ed among the thi k bushes, behaving nun h like our own yellow breasted ihats; and a multitude of other birds, beautiful or f.mt.isti  There were'trijwd squirrels too, reminding us of the big Rocky Moun- tain   hipmunk or Say s i hipmunk. but with snialler ears and a longer tail Christmas day we parsed on the march.

Forty miles from the coast the elephant grass Ix-gan to disappear The hills be- came somewhat higher, there were thorn- trees, and stately royal palms of great height, their stems swollen and bulging at the top, near the fronds. Parasitic ferns, with leaves as large as cabbage leaves, grew on the brant lies  f the acacias. One kind of tree sent down from its branches to the ground roots which grew into thick trunks. There were wide, shallow marshes, anti although the grass was tall it was no longer above a man s head, kermit and I usu- ally got two or three hours  hunting each day. We killed singsing walerbut k, bush- buck, and bolior reed buck. The recdbuck differed slightly from those of East Africa; in   lai es they were plentiful, and they were not warv. We also killed several harte- l eesi': a variety of the Jackson s harte- l  est being more highly colored, with black markings. I killed a very handsome har nessed bushbu  I: rant. It was rather bigger than a good-sized whitetail buck, its bril- liant red coat lieautifully marked with rows of white spots, its twisted black horns sharp ami polished. It seemed to stand about half way between the dark-colored bu h- butk rams of Last and South Africa and African  iamc rrails the lKMutifully marked harnessed antolojie ranis of the west coast forests. The ewvs and young rams showed the harness mark ings even more plainly; anil, as with all bushbuck. were of small si .e com  arcd to the old rams. These bushbuck were found in tall grass, where the ground was wet, instead of in the thick bush where their l ast African kinsfolk spent the daytime At the bushbuck camp we met a num- ber of porters return- ing from the Congo, where they had been with an elephant  x acher named Bus- herri   at least that was as near the name as we could make out. He had gone into the Congo to get ivory by shooting and trading; but the wild lores people had attacked him. .iml h.nl killed him and seven of his followers, and the others were straggling homeward. In Kam- palla we had met an elephant hunter named Quin who had recently lost his right arm in an encounter with a wounded tu-k- er. Near one camp the head chief   ointcd out two places, now overgrown with jun- gle. where little vil- lages had stood less than a year before. In each case elephants had taken to feeding at night in Ihe di.im- bas, and had steadily grown bolder and balder until the natives, their crops ruined by the depredations and their lives in danger, hail abandoned the struggle, and shifted to some new place in the wilder- ness. Wc were soon to meet elephant ours-lves. The morning of the sttth was rainy; we strm k camp rather late, and the march was long, ao that it was mid-afternoon when Kermit and I reached our new camping plate. Soon afterward word was brought us that some elephants were near by; wc were told that the beasts were in the habit of devastating the shambas, and were boM and trui ulcnt, having killed a man who had tried to interfere with them. Kermit and I at once started after them, just as the last of the safari came in. accompanied by  'un- inghame, who could not go w ith us as lie was recovering from a bout of fever In half an hour we came on fresh Mgn. and began to work cautiously along it.    ur guide, a wild  ltKiking savage with a blunt spear, went first, followed bv my gun-bearer Kongoni, who is excellent on spoor; then I came, followed by Kermit, and by the other gun- l earers. The coun- try was covered with tall grass, and stud- dcd with numerous patches of jungle and small forest. In a few minute-, we hearil the elephants, four or live of them, feeding in thick jungle where the vines that hung in tangled masses from the trees and that drajied the bushes made dark caves of greenery. 11 wa s d i I ti t ult to lind any space t lear enough to see thirty yard-  ahead. Fortunately there was no wind whatever. We picked out the sjioor of a big bull and for an hour and a half we followed it. Kongoni usually in the lead. Two or three times, as we threaded our way among the bushes, as noiselessly as jKissible. we caught glimpses of gray, shadowy bulks, but only for a second at a time, and never with sutTicent distinct- ness to shoot.

We con- tinually heard them breaking branches, and making rumbling or squeaking sounds. They then ied slowly along in the opposite direction, and got into rather more open coun- try: and we followed faster in the big foot- prints of the bull we had selected. Suddenly in an open glade Kon- goni crouched and beck- oned to me, and through a bush I caught the loom of the tusker, but at that instant he cither heard us, siw u- , or caught a whiff of our wind, and without a moment s hesitation he himself assumed the of- fensive. With his huge ears cocked at right an- gles to his head, and his trunk hanging down, he charged full tilt at us, coming steadily.silently, and at a great pa c, his feet swishing through the long grass; and a formidable monster he looked. At forty yards I fired the right barrel oi the Holland into his head, and though I missed the brain the shock dazed him and brought him to an in-tant halt. Immediately Kermit put a bullet from the Winchester into his head: as he wheeled 1 gave him the second barrel lictween the neck and shoulder, through his ear; and Kermit gave him three more shots before he slewed round and disappeared. There were not many minutes of daylight left, and we followed hard on his trail, K011- goni leading. At tir t there was only an occasional gout of dark blood; but -oon we found the s  ilashes of red froth from the lungs, then we came to where he had fallen, and then we heard him crashing among the branches in thick jungle to the right. In we went alter him, through the gathering gloom, Kongoni leading and I   lose behind, with the ritle ready for instant action; for though his strength was evidently fast fail- ing, he was also evidently in a savage- tcm- j er, anxious to wreak his  engeance before he died.

Krrmit fired; each of us fired again on the inslant; the mighty hull threw up his trunk, crashed over backward, and lay dead on his side among the bushes. A tine sight he was, a sight to gladden any hunt- er s heart, as he lay in the twilight, a giant in death. At once we trotted back to camp, reach- ing it as darkness fell; and next morning all of us came out to the carcass. He was full grown, and was ten feet nine inches high. The tusks were rather short, but tliii k. and weighed a hundred and ten pounds the pair Out of the trunk we made excellent soup. Several times while following the trail of this big bull we could tell he was close by the strong elephant smell. Most game animals have a peculiar scent, often strong enough for the species to be readily recog nizable before it is seen, if in forest or jungle. On the open plains, of course, one rarely gets close enough to an animal to smell it before seeing it; but 1 once smelled I f  n       t i   y   4bl p f Kmi In it-  .ii k:  uidrt a.

More ihan once, in forest, my nostrils have warned me before my eves that 1 was getting near the quarry whose spoor I was on. After leaving the elephant camp we jour- neyed through country for the most part covered with an open forest growth. The trees were chiefly acacias. Among them were interspersed huge candelabra euphor- bias, all in bloom, and now and then one of th. brilliant red flowering trees, which never seem to carry many leaves at the same lime with their gaudy blossoms. At one place for miles the u x-n forest was rom- posed of the pod-bearing. thick-leafed trees on which we had found the elephants feeding; their bark and manner of growth gave them somewhat the look of jaek-oaks: where they made up the forest, growing well apart from one another, it reminded us of the cross-timbers of Texas and Okla- homa. The grass was everywhere three or four feet high; here and there were patches of ihe cane-like elephant jjr.is-, fifteen feet high.

Sometimes we were met with music, on instru- ments of one string, of three 't rings, of ten strings r udimentar y fiddles and harps, ami there was a much more i  implicated instrument, big and   umbrous.made of bars of wood placed    n two banana stems, the bars being struck with a hammer, as if they were keys; its tones were deep and good. Along the road wc did not see habitations or   cople: but continually there led away from it. twisting through the tall V'rass and the bu-h jun- gle', native paths, the earth beaten brown and hard by countless bare feet, and these.crossing and recrossing in a net- African Game Trails mi work, led to plantation after plantation of banana , an l sweet   otaioos, and clusters of thatched huts. In the afternoon, as the sun began to get well beyond the meridian, we usually sallied forth to hunt, under the guidance of some native who had come in to tell us where he had seen game that morning. The jungle was so thick in placcs anti the grass was everywhere so long, that without such guidance there was little successful hunting to lie done in only two or three- hours. We might come back with a buck, iridescent green anti purple, which looked like our grackles, but were kin to the bul- tnils: and another l ird, related to the shrikes, with bristly feathers on the rump, which wa    olored like a red-winged Mack- bird, black with red shoulders. Vultures were not plentiful, but the yellow billed kites, true camp scavengers, were com- mon and tame, screaming as they cir- t led overhead, and catching bits of meat which were thrown in the air for them.

Frogs with queer voices abounded in the marshes. Among the ants was one arboreal kind which made huge nests, shaped like lnrehives or rather like lii  gray bells, in the trees. Near the lake, by the way. there were  ioliath beetles, as large as small rats. Ten days from Kampalla wc crossed the little Kafu River, the Mat k, smooth currcnt twisting quickly along between l etls of plumed papyrus. Beyond it we entered the native kingdom of I'nyoro It is part of the British protectorate of Uganda, l ut is separate front the native kingdom of Uganda, though its   eoplc in ethnit type and social development seem mut h the same. We halted for a day at Hoima, a spread-out little native town, pleasantly situated among hills, and surrounded bv n 2 African Game Trails plantations of cotton. plaintains. yams, millet, and l eans. It is the capital of Vnyoro. where the king lives, as well as three or four English officials, and Episco- palian and Homan Catholic missionaries. The king, accompanied by his prime min- ister and by the English Commissioner, called on me, and 1 gave him live o clock tea; he i  a Christian, as are most of his the jackals wailed with shrill woe among the gardens. From Hoima we entered a country cov- ered with the tall, rank elephant grass. It was traversed by papyrus-Ixirdercd streams and broken by patches of forest.

At noon on January 5th, 1910, we reached Butiaba, a sandspit and mar h on the shores of Lake Albert Nyanza.  Yc had marched alxmt one humlred and sixty miles from Lake Victoria. We camped on the sandy beach by thc edge of the licautiful lake, looking across its waters to the mountains that walled in the opposite shore. At mid-day the whole landsca ie trembled in thc white, glaring heat; as the afternoon waned a wind blew off thc lake, and the west kindled in ruddy splendor as the sun went down. At Butiaba we took Itoats to go down the Nile to the Lado country. The head of thc water transportation service in Uganda, Captain Hutchinson, R.X.K.. met us. hav ing most kindly decided to take charge of our flotilla himself. Captain Hutchinson was a mighty hunter, and had met with one most extraordinary experience while ele- phant hunting; in Uganda the numljer of hunters who have been killed or injured by elephants and buffaloes is large. He wounded a big bull in thc head, and fol- lowed it for three days. The wound was serious and on the fourth day he overtook the elephant. It charged .i' soon a  it saw him. He hit it twice in the head with his  45odouble barrel as it came on. but neither stopped nor turned it; his second ritlc, a double S bore, failed to act; and thc ele- phant seized him in its trunk.

A QUESTION OF LATITUDE BY RICHARD HARDING DAVIS ' the school of earnest young writers at whom the word muckrakcr had l etfn thrown in oppro- brium, and by whom it had been caught up as a tiilcof honor, Everett was among the younger and le s conspicuous. But. if in his skirmishes with graft and cor- ruption he had failed to correct the evils he attacked, from the contests he himself had always emerged with credit. His sin- cerity and his methods were above sus- picion. No one hail caught him in mis- statement, or exaggeration. Even those he attacked, admitted he fought lair. For these reasons, the editors of magazines, with the fear of libel Itefore their eyes, re- garded him as a  sate" man, the public, feeling that the evils he exposed were due to its own indifference, with uncomfort- able approval, and those be attacked, with impotent anger. Their anger was impo- tent because, in the case of Everett, the weapons used by their class in  striking back   were denied them. They could not say that for money he sold sensations, be- cause it was known that a proud and wealthy parent supplied him with all the money he wanted. Nor in his private life could they find anything to offset his attacks upon the misconduct of others. Men had Iteen sent to spy upon him, and women to lay traps. But the men reported that his evenings were spent at his club, and, from ihe women, those who sent them learned only that Everett  treats a lady, ju ,t as though she is a lady.  Accordingly, when, with much trumpet- ing, he departed to investigate conditions in the Congo, there were some who rejoiced. 'I he standard of life to which Everett was accustomed was high. In his home in Bos- ton it had been set for him by a father and mother who, though critics rather than workers in the world, had taught him to de- spise what was mean and ungenerous, to write the truth and abhor a compromise. At Harvard he had interested himself Vol. XLVItl. iS in municipal reform, and when later he moved lo New York, he transferred his in- terest to the problems of that city. His attack u M n Tammany Hall did not utterly destroy that organization, but at once brought him lo the notice of the editors. By them he was invited to till his lance at evils in other parts of ihe United States, at   sys- tems.   trusts, convict camps, municipal misrule. His work had met with a meas- ure of success that seemed to justify Low- ell's Weekly in sending him further afield, and he now was on his way to tell the truth about the Congo. Personally, Everett was a healthy, clean minded enthusiast... Ue possessed all of the advantages    youth, and all of its intolerance. He was sup- posed to be engaged to Florence Carey, but he was not. There was, however, Ik-tween them an  understanding,  which under- standing, as Everett understood it, meant that until she,was ready to say, "I am ready.  he was to think of her, dream of her, write love-letters to her, and keep him- self only for her. He loved her very dear- ly, and, having no choice, was content to wait. His content was fortunate, as Miss Carey seemed inclined to keep him waiting indefinitely. Except in Europe, Everett had never travelled outside the limits of his own coun- try. But the new land toward which he was advant ing, held no terrors. As he un- derstood it, the Congo was at the mercy of a corrupt ' ring.  In even- part of the United J tates he had found a i ity in the clutch of a corrupt ring. The conditions would be the same, the methods he would use to get at the truth would Ik- the same, the result for reform would Ik.- the same. The English steamer on which he sailed for Southampton was one leased by the In- dependent State of the Congo, and. with a few exceptions, her passengers were sub- jects of King Leopold.    n board, the lan- guage was French, at table the men sat according to the rank they held in the ad- ministration of the jungle, and each in his buttonhole wore the tiny silver star that ios A Question of Latitude showed that for three years, to lili the store- houses of the king of the Belgians, he had gathered rubber and ivory. In the smok- ing room Everett soon discovered that pas- sengers not in l lie service uf that king, the English and German officers and traders, held aloof from the Belgians. Their alti- tude toward them seemed to be one partly of contempt, partly of pity. " Are your English protectorates on the coast, then, so much better administered " Everett asked. The English "Coaster," who for ten years in Nigeria had escaped fever and sud- den death, laughed evasively.    I have never been in the Congo." he said. "Only know what they tell one. But you ll see for yourself. That is," he added,  you'll sec what they want you to see." They were leaning on the rail, with their eyes turned toward the co ist of Liberia, a gloomy green line against which the waves cast up fountains of foam as high as the co- coanut palms. As a subject of di   ussion, the Coaster seemed anxious to avoid the Congo.  It was there," he said, pointing, "the Three Castles struck on the rocks. She was a total k  . So were her passengers." he added. "They ate them.  Everett gazed suspiciously at the un- moved face of the veteran. "117 0 ate them " he asked guardedlv.  Sharks   " The natives that live back of that shore- line in the lagoons." Everett laughed with the assurance of one for whom a trap had been laid and who had cleverly avoided it.  Cannibals," he mocked. "Cannibals went out of date with pirates. But per- haps." lie added apologetically,  this hap- pened some years ago " " Happened last month," said the trailer. "But Liberia is a perfectly good repub- lic," protested Everett.  The blacks there may not be as far advarned a  in your colo nies, hut they're not cannibals.    Monrovia is a very small part of Li- beria," sai l the trader dryly.  And none of these protectorates, or crown colonies, on this coast pretends to control much of the Hinterland, There is Sierra Leone, for instance, about the oldest of them. Last year the governor celebrated the hundredth anniversary of the year the British abolished slavery. They hail parades and tea-fights, and all the blacks were in the street in straw hats with cricket ribbons, thanking God they were not as other men are, not slaves like their grandfathers. Well, just at the height of the jubilation, the tribes within twenty miles of the town sent in to say that they, also, were holding a palaver, and it was to mark the fact that they nei-cr had been slaves and never would be, and, if the governor doubted it, to send out his fighting men and they d prove it. It cast quite a gloom over the celebration.   Do you mean that only twenty miles from the coast   began Everett. " Ten miles," said the Coaster.  Wait till you see Calabar. That's our Exhibit A. The cleanest, best administrated. Ev- erything there is model: hospitals, barracks, golf links. Last year, ten miles from Cala- bar, Dr. Stewart rode his bicycle into a na- tive village. The king tortured him six days, cut him up, and sent pieces of him to fifty villages with the message:  You eat each other. IIV eat white chop.  That was ten miles from our model barracks.  For some moments the muckraker con- sidered the statement thoughtfully.  You mean,  he inquired, "that the atrocities are not all on the side of the while men    Atrocities " exclaimed the trader. "I wasn't talking of atrocities. Are you look- ing for them   "I'm not running awav from them," laughed Everett. "Lowell's Weekly is sending me to the Congo to find out the truth, and to try to help put an end to them.  In his turn the trader considered the statement carefully. "Among the natives." he explained, painstakingly picking each word, "what you call  atrocities' arc customs of warfare, forms of punishment. When they go to war they rxpeet to be tortured; they know. if they're killed, they'll Im: eaten. The white man comes here and finds these cus- toms have existed for centuries. I Ic adopts them, because-" "One moment " interrupted Everett warmly.  That does not excuse hint. The point is, that with him they have not ex- isted. To him they should be against his conscience, indecent, horrible  He has a A Question of Latitude greater knowledge, a much higher intelli- gence; he should lift the native, not sink to him." The Coaster took hi.s pipe from his mouth, and twice ofiened his lips to speak. Finally, he blew the smoke into the air, anil shook his head.  What s the u e " he exclaimed.   Try," laughed Everett.  Maybe I m not as unintelligent as I talk.    You must get this right,  protested the Coaster. '  It doesn't matter a damn what a man brings here, what his training aus, what he is. The thing is too strong tor him." "What thing " "That ." said the Coaster. He threw out his arm at the brooding mountains, the dark lagoons, the glaring coast-line, against which the waves shot into the air with the shock and roar of twelve-inch guns. "The first white man came to Sierra Leone live hundred years l elore Christ.  said the Coaster. "And, in twenty-two hundred years, he's got just twenty miles inland. The native didn't need forts, or a navy, to stop him. He had three allies: those waves, the fever, and the sun. Es- pecially the sun. The black man goes bare-headed, and the sun lets him pass. The white man covers his head with an inch of cork, and the sun strikes through it and kills him. When Jameson came down the river from Yambuya, the natives fired on his boat. He waved his helmet at them fur three minutes, to show them there was a white man in the canoc. Three minutes was all the sun wanted. Jameson died in two days. Where you are going, the sun does worse things to a man than kill him: it drives him mad. It keeps the fear of d ath in his heart; and lhal takes away his nerve and his sense of proportion. He flies into murderous fits, over silly, imaginary slights; he grows morbid, suspicious, he be- comes a coward, and bccause he is a coward with authority, he becomes a bully. "He is alone, we will su   tose, at a sta- tion three hundred miles from any other white man. One morning his house-boy spills a cup of coffee on him. and in a rage he half kills the boy. He broods over that, until he discovers, or his crazy mind makes him think he has discovered, that in re- venge the lx y is plotting to poison him. So he punishes him again. Only, this time he punishes him as the black man has taught him to punish, in the only way the black man seems to understand; that is, he tortures him. From that moment the fall uf that man is rapid. The heat, the loneliness, the fever, ihc fear of the black faces, keep him on edge, rob hint of sleep, rob him of his physical strength, of his moral strength. He loses shame, loses reason; becomcscruel, weak, degenerate. He invents new, bestial tortures; commits new, unspeakable  atro- cities,  until, one day, the natives turn and kill him. or he sin ks his   un in his mouth and blows the top of his head off.  The Coaster smiled tolerantly at the wide-eyed, eager young man at his side. "And you,  he mocked,  think you can reform that man, and that hell above ground called the Congo, with an artiile in Lowell's Weekly   Undismayed, Everett grinned cheerfully.  That s what I m here for " he said. By the time Everett reached the mouth of the Congo, he had learned that in every- thing he must depend upon himself; that he would be accepted only .as the kind of man that, at the moment, he showed him- self to be. This attitude of independence was not chosen, but forced on him by the men with whom he came in contact. As- sociations and traditions that in every part of the United States had served as letters of introduction, and enabled strangers to identify and label him, were to the white men on the steamer and at the ports of call, without meaning or value. That he was an Everett of Boston conveyed little to those who had not heard even of Boston. That he was the corre jKindent of Lowell's IIVcA- ty meant less to those who did not know that Lowell's Weekly existed. And when, in confusion, he proffered his letter of credit, the very fact that it called for .1 thousand pounds was, in the eyes of a   Palm Oil Ruffian,  sufluient evidence that it had been forged or stolen. He soon saw that solely as a white man was he accepted and made welcome. That he was respectable, few believed, and no one cared. To l e taken at his face value, to Ik  refused at the start the benefit of the doubt, was a novel sensation; and yet not unpleasant. It was a relief not to be accepted only as Everett the Muckraker, as a professional reformer, as one holier than others. It afforded his soul the same relaxation that his body rc- A Question of Latitude ceived when, in his shirt-sleeves in the sweltering smoking-room, he drank l eer with a  Utj de paste who had I icon thrice tried for murder. Not only to even- one was he a stranger, hut to him everything was strange: so strange as to appear unreal. This did not prevent him from at once recognising those things that were not strange, su  h as cor- rupt otlkials. incompetence, mismanage- ment. He did not need the mis ionarics to point out to him that the Independent State of the Congo was not a colony admin- istered for the ljenefit of many, but a vast rubber plantation worked by slaves to till the  K ckets of one man. It was nut in his work that Everett found himself confused. It was in his attitude of mind toward almost every other question. At first, when he could not make every- thin ; tit his rule of thumb, he excused the country tolerantly as a   topsy-turvy  land. He wished lo move and act quickly; to make others move quickly. He did not understand that men who had sentenced themselves to exile for the ollicial term of three years, or for life, measured time only bv the date of their release. When he learned that even a cablegram could not rea  h his home in less than eighteen days, that the missionaries to whom he brought letters were a three months  journey from the coast and from each other, his impa- tience was chastcncd to wonder, and, later, to awe. His education began at Matadi. where he waited until the river steamer was ready to start for Leopoldville. Of the two places he was assured Matadi was the ln-tter. for the reason that if you still were in favor with the steward of the ship that brought you south, he might sell you a piece of ice. Matadi was a j;reat rock, blazing with heat. Its narrow, perpendicular paths seemed to run with burning lava. Its top, the main square of the settlement, was of baked clay, l eaten hard by thousands of naked feet Crossing it by day was an ad- venture. The air that swept it was the breath of a blast-furnace. Everett found a room over the shop of a Portuguese trader. Ii was aked with dirt, anil smelled of unnamed diseases and chloride of lime. In it was a canvas cot, a roll of evil-looking bedding, a wash-basin filled with the stumps of cigarettes. In a corner was a tin chop-box, which Everett asked to have removed. It In-longed, the landlord told him, to the man who, two nights before, had occupied the cot and who had died in it. Everett was anxious to learn of what he had died. Apparently surprised 3t the question, the Portuguese shrugged his shoulders.    Who knows    he exclaimed. The next morning ihe F.nglish trader across the street assured Everett there was no occasion for alarm.   He didn t die of any disease.  he explained.   Somebody got at him from the balcony, while he was in his cot, and knifed him.  The English trader was a young man. a cockney, named Upsher. At home he had been a steward on the Channel steamers. Everett made him his most intimate friend. He had a black wife, who spent most of her day in a four-post bed, hung with lace cur- tains and blue ribbon, in which she resem- bled a baby hipjiopotamus wallowing in a bank of white sand. At first the black woman was a shock to Everett, but after Upsher dismissed her in- differently as a "good old sort." and spent one evening blubbering over a photograph of his wife and "kiddie  at home, Everett accepted her. His excuse for this was that men who knew they might die on the mor- row. must not be judged by what they do to-day. The excuse did not ring sound, but he dismissed the doubt by deciding that in sui h heat it was not possible to take serious questions, seriously. In the fact that, to those about him. the thought of death was ever present, he found further excuse for much else  that puzzled and shocked him. At home, death had been a contingency so remote, that he had put it aside as something he need not consider until he was a grandfather. At Matadi. at every moment of the day. in each trilling act. he found death must be faced, concili- ated. conquered. At home, he might ask himself, "If I eat this, will it give me indi- gestion   At Matadi he asked, "If I drink this, will I die " I psher told him of a feud then existing l ctwccn the chief of police and an Italian doctor in the State service. Interested in the out. omc only as a sporting pro K sition, I psher declared the odds were unfair, be- cause the Belgian was using his black po- lice to act as his body-guard while for A Question of Latitude protection the Italian could depend only u H n his sword-cane. Each night, with the other white exiles oi Matadi, the two adversaries met in the Cafe' Franco- Beige. There, with puzzled interest, Eve- rett watched them sitting at separate tables, surrounded by mutual friends, excitedly playing dominoes. Outside the rate, Ma- tadi lav smothered and sweltering in a black, living darkness, and, save for tlte rush of the river, in a silence that con- tinued unbroken across a jungle as wide as Europe. Inside, the dominoes clicked, the glasses rang on the iron tables, the oil lamps glared uj on the pallid, sweating faces of clerks, ujton the tanned, sweat- ing skins of officers; and the Italian doc- tor and the Belgian lieutenant, each with murder in his heart, laughed, shrugged, gesticulated, waiting tor the moment to strike.  But why doesn t some one do some- thing   demanded Everett.  Arrest them, or reason with them. Everybody knows about it. It seems a pity not to do some- thing.  Cpsher nodded his head. Dimly he rec- ognized a language with which he once had been familiar.  I know what you mean,  he agreed.  Bind  em over to keep the peace. And a good job, too  But who   he demanded vaguely.   That s what I say  Who " From the confusion into which Everett s appeal to forgotten memories had thrown it, his mind suddenly emerged.  But what s the use   he demanded.    Don t you see,  he explained triumphant- ly,  if those two crazy men were lit to listen to sense, they d have sense enough not to kill each other   Each succeeding evening Everett watched the two jiotential murderers with lessening interest. He even made a bet with Cpsher, of a bottle of fruit salt, that the chief of policc would be the one to die. A few nights later a man, groaning l e- neath his balcony, disturlied his slumbers. He cursed the man, and turned his pillow to find the cooler side. But all through the night the groans, though fainter, broke into his dreams. At intervals some traditions of past conduct tugged al Everett s sleeve, and bade him rise and play the good Samaritan. But, indignantly, he repulsed them. Were there not many others within hearing  Were there not police  Was it his place to bind the wounds of drunken stokers  The groans were probably a trick, to entice him, unarmed, into the night. And so, just before the dawn, when the mists rose, and the groans ceased, Everett, still arguing, sank with a contented sigh into forgetful- ness. When he woke, there was Ixneath his window much monkey-like chattering, and he looked down into the white face and glazed eyes of the Italian doctor, lying in the guller and staring up at him. Below his shoulder-blades a pool of blood shone evilly in the blatant sunlight. Across the street, on his balcony, Upshcr, in pajamas and mosquito boots, was shiver- ing with fever anil stilling a yawn.   You lose   he called. Later in the day, Everett analyzed his conduct of the night previous.  At home,  he told Upsher,  I would have been tele- phoning for an ambulance, or been out in the street giving the man the  first-aid  drill. But living as we do here, so close to death, we see things more clearly. Death loses its importance. It s a bromide,  he added.  But travel certainly broadens one. Every  day I have been in the Congo, I have been assimilating new ideas.  Up- sher nodded vigorously in assent. An older man could have told Everett that he was assimilating just as much of the Congo as the  rabbit assimilates the boa-con- strictor, that first smothers it with saliva, and then swallows it. Everett started up the Congo in a small steamer open on all sides to the sun and rain, and with a paddle-wheel astern that kicked her forward at the rate  if four miles an hour. Once every day, the boat tied up to a tree and took on wood to feed her furnace, and Everett talked to the white man in charge of the wood post, or, if, as it generally hapj ened, the white man was on his back with fever, dosed him with quinine. On lrt ard, except for her  .ipl.iin, and a Finn who acted as engineer, Everett was the only other white man. The black crew ami   wood-1  oys   he soon disliked intense- ly. At first, when Nansen, the Danish captain, and the Finn struck them, berause they were in the way, or ticcause they were not, Everett winied, and made a note of ii But later hr divided lhe blacks were inso- lent, sullen, ungrateful; that a blow did them no harm. 170 A Question of Latitude According to the unprejudiced testimony of those who, liefore the war. in his own country, had owned slaves, those of the  Southland  were always content, al- ways happy. When not singing close har- mony in the cotton-fields, they darn ed upon the levcc, they twanged the old banjo. But the se slaves of the Upper Congo were not happy. They did not dame. They did not sing. At times their eyes, dull, gloomy, despairing, lit with a sudden sombre fire, and searched the eyes of the while man. They seemed to Ix-g of him the answer to a terrible question. It was always the same question. Ii had been asked of Pharaoh. They asked it of Leopold. For hours, squatting on the iron deck-plates, humped on their naked haunches, crowding dose together, they muttered apparently inter- minable criticisms of Everett. Their eyes never left him. He resented this unceasing scrutiny. It got upon his nerves. He was sure they were evolving some s  heme to rob him of his tinned sausages, or, possibly, to kill him. It was then he began to dislike them. In reality, they were discussing the watch -trapped to his wrist. They be- lieved n was a powerful juju, to ward off evil spirits. They were afraid of it. One day, to pay the chief wood-boy for a carved paddle, Fverett was measuring a brd'. of cloth. As he had been taught, lie held the cloth in his teeth and stretched it lo the ends of his linger-tips. The wood-boy thought the while man was giving him short measure. White men always had given him short measure, and, at a glance, he could not recognize that this one was an Everett of Boston. So he ojiened Everett's fingers All the blood in F.verett's body leaped to his head. That he, a while man, an Everett, who had tome so far lo set these people free, should be accused by one of them of petty theft  He caught up a log of firewood and laid open the scalp of the black boy, from the eye to the crown of his head. The boy dropped, and Everett, seeing the blood creeping through his kinky wool, turned ill with nausea. Drunkcnly, through a red cloud of mist, lie heard himself shouting,  The hhui: nigger  The niggcrf fie touched met 1 Irll you, he touched me   Captain Nansen led Everett to his cot and gave him tizzy salts, but it was not until sun-down that the trembling and nausea ceased. Then, partly in shame, partly as a bribe, he sought out the injured boy and gave him the entire roll of cloth. It had cost Everett ten francs. To the wood-boy it meant a year's wages. The boy hugged it in his arms, as he might a baby, and crooned over it. From under the blood-stained bandage, humbly, without resentment, he lifted his tired eyes to those of the white man. Still, dumbly, they begged the answer to the same question. During the five months Everett spent up the river he slopped at many missions, sta- tions, one-man wood posts. He talked to Jesuit fathers, to inspetlcurs, to collectors for the State of rubber, taxes, elephant tusks, in time, even in Bangalese, to chiefs of the native villages. According to the jK int of view, he was told tales of oppres- sion, of avarice, of hideous crimes, of cruel- ties committed in the name of trade that were abnormal, unthinkable. The note never was of hope, never of cheer, never in- spiring. There was always the grievance, the spirit of unrest, of rebellion that ranged from dislike lo a primitive, hot hate. Of his own land and life he heard nothing, not even when his face was again turned toward the east. Nor did he think of it. As now he saw them, the rules and prin- ciples and standards of his former exist- ence were petty and credulous. But he assured himself he had not abandoned those standards. He had only tempor- arily laid them aside, as he had left lie- liind him in London his frock coat and silk hat. Not because he would not use them again, but because in the Congo they were ridiculous. For weeks, with a missionary as a guide, he w .Iked through forests in which the sun never penetrated.or,on the river, moved be- tween banks where nowhitemanhad placed his loot; where, at night, the elephants came trooping lo the water, and seeiug the lights of the boat, tied crashing through the jun- gle, where the great hippos, puffing and blowing, rose so  ,lose to his elbow that he could have tossed his cigarette and hit them. I he vastness of the Congo, toward which he had so jauntily set forth, now weighed upon his soul The immeasurable dis- tances: the slumlicring disregard of time; the brooding, interminable silences; the A Question of Latitude 171 efforts to conquer ihe land that were so fu- tile, so puny, and so cruel, at first appalled, and, later left him unnerved, rebellious, childishly defiant. What health was there, he demanded hotly, in holding in a dripping jungle, to morals, to etiquette, to fashions of conduct   Was he. the white man, intelligent, trained, disciplined in mind and body, to be judged by naked cannibals, by chattering monkeys, by mammoth primeval beasts  His code of conduct was his own. He was a law unto himself. He came down the river on one of the larger steamers of the State, and, on this voyage, with many fellow passengers. He now was on his way home, but in the fact he felt no elation. Each day the fever ran tingling through his veins, and left him list- less, frightened, or choleric. One night at dinner, in one of these moods 01 irritation, he took offense at the act of a lieutenant who, in lack of vegetables, drank from the vinegar bottle. Everett protested that such table manners were unbecoming an officer, even an officer of the Congo; and on the lieutenant resenting his criticism, Everett drew his revolver. The others at the table took it from him, and locked him in his cabin. In the morning, when he tried to recall what had occurrcd, he could remem- ber only that, for some excellent reason, he had hated some one with a haired that could be served only with death. He knew it could not have been drink, as each day the State allowed him but one half-bottle of claret. That but for the interference of strangers he might have shot a man, did not interest him. In the outcome of what he regarded merely as an incident, he saw causc neither for congratulation, or sclf- rcproach. For his conduct he laid the blame upon the sun, and doubled his dose of fruit salts. Everett was again at Matadi, waiting for the Nigeria to lake on cargo l efore return- ing to Liverj ool. During the few days Uiat must intervene before she sailed, he lived on board. Although now actually bound north, the thought afforded him no satisfaction. His spirits were depressed, his mind gloomy; a feeling of rebellion, of outlawry, tilled him with unrest. While the ship lay at the wharf, Hardy, her English captain, Cuthbcrt, the purser, and Everett ate on deck under the awning, assailed by electric fans. Each was clad in nothing more intricate than pajamas. "To-night,  announced Hardy, with a sigh, "we got to dress ship. Mr. Ducret and his wife are coming on hoard. We carry his trade goods, and I got lo stand him a dinner ami champagne. You boys," he commanded, "must wear  whites,  and talk French.     I'll dine ori shore,  growled Everett.  Better meel them," advised Culhbert. The purser was a pink-cheeked, dear- eyed young man, who spoke the many lan- guages of the coast glibly, anti bis own in the soft, detached voice of a well-bred Eng- lishman. He was in training to enter the consular service. Something in his poise, in the assured manner in which he handled his white stewards and the black Kroo boys, seemed to Everett a constant re- proach, and he resented him.  They're a picturesque couple,  ex- plained Cuthbcrt.  Ducret was origi- nally a wrestler. Used to challenge all comers from the front of a booth. He served his time in the army in Senegal, anti when he was mustered out moved to the French Congo and began to trade, in a small way. in ivory. Now he's the biggest merchant, physically and every other way, from Stanley I ool to Lake Chad. He has a house at Brazzaville built of mahogany, ami a grand piano, anti his own icc-plant. His wife was a supper-girl at Maxim s. He brought her down here and married her. Every rainy season they go back to Paris and run race horses, and they say the l est table in every all-night restaurant is re served for him. In Paris they call her the Ivory Queen. She s killed seventeen ele- phants with her own ritlc.  In the t pper Congo, Everett had seen four white women. They were pallid, washed-out, bloodless; even the youngest looked past middle age. For him women of any other tyj c had ceased to exist. He had come to think of every white woman as past middle age, with a face wrinkled by the sun, with hair bleached white by the sun. with eyes from which, through gazing at the sun, all light and lustre had departed. He thought of them as always wearing boots to protect their ankles from mos- quitoes, and army helmets. When he came on deck for dinner, he saw a woman who looked as though she was 172 A Question of Latitude posing for a photograph by Reutlinger. She appeared to have stepped to the deck directly from her electric victoria, and the Rue de la l aix. She was tall, lithe, grace- fully erect, with eyes of great loveliness, and hair brilliantly black, drawn,  i  .  Merode, across a broad, fair forehead. She wore a gown and lung coat of white lace, as deli- cate as a bridal veil, and a hat with a dap- ping brim from which, in a curtain, hung more lace. When 'he was pleased, she lifted her head and the curtain rose, un- masking her lovely eyes. Around the white, bare throat was a string of pearl . They had cost the lives of many ele- phants. Cuthbert. only a month from home, saw Madame Ducrct just as she was a Pari- sienne, elegant, smart, soignf. He knew that on any night at Madrid or d'Armcnon- ville he might look upon twenty women of the same charming type. They might lack that something this girl from Maxim's pos- sessed the spirit that had caused her to follow her husband into the depths of dark- ness. But outwardly, for show purjx ses, they were even as she. But to Everett she was no messenger from another world. She was unique. To his famished eyes, starved senses, and fever- driven brain, she was her entire sex person- ified. She was the one woman for whom he had always sought, alluring, soothing, maddening; if need be, to be fought for; the one thing to be desired. Opposite, across the table, her husband, the ex-wres- tler, rhasiciir d'Afriijtie, elephant  ioacher, bulked large as an ox. Men felt as well js saw his bigness. Captain Hardy deferred to him   n matters of trade. The purser de- ferred to him on questions of administra- tion. He answered them in his big way, with big thoughts, in big ligures. He was fifty years ahead of his time. He beheld the   otigo open to the world; in the forests where he had hunted elephants, he foresaw great  factories,"  mining camps, railroads, feeding gold and topper ore to the trunk line, from the Cape to Cairo. His ideas w  re the ideas of an empirc-builder. But, while the others listened, fascinated, hyp- notized, Everett saw only the woman, her eyes fixed on her husband, her lingers turn- ing and twisting her diamond rings. Every now and again she raised her eyes Iu Ever- ett almost reproachfully, as though to say.  Why do you not listen to him  It is much better for you than to look at me." When they had gone, all through the sul- try night, until the sun drove him to his cabin, like a caged animal Everett paced and repaced the deck. The woman pos- sessed his mind and he could not drive her out. He did not wish to drive her out. What the consequences might be he did not care. So long as he might see her again, he jeered at the consequences. Of one thing he was positive. He could not now leave the Congo. He would follow her to Brazzaville. If he were discreet, Ducret might invite him to make him- self their guest. Once established in her home, she nutsl listen to him. No man ever before had felt for any woman the need he felt for her. It was too big for him to conquer. It would be too big for her to resist. In the morning a note from Ducret in- vited Everett and Cuthbert to join him in an all-day excursion to the waterfall beyond Matadi. Everett answered the note in person. The thought of seeing the wom- an calmed anti steadied him like a dose of morphine. So much more violent than the fever in his veins was the fever in his brain that, when again he was with her, he laughed happily, and was grandly at peace. So different was he from the man they had met the night before, that the Frenchman and his wife glanced at each other in sur- prise and approval. They found him witty, eager, a most charming companion: and when he announced his intention of visiting Brazzaville, they insisted he should make their home his own. His admiration, as outwardly' it appeared to be. fur Madame Ducret, was evident to the others, bui her husband accepted it. It was her due And, on the Congo, to grudge to another man the sight of a pretty woman was as i ruel a  to withhold the few grains of quinine that might save his reason. But, before tbe day passed, Madame Dut ret was aware that the American could not be light- ly dismissed, as an admirer. The fact neither flattered nor offended. For her, it was no novel or disturbing experience. Other men, whipped on by loneliness, by fever, by primitive savage instincts, had told her what she meant to them. She did not hold them res  on$ible. Some, worth curing, she had nursed through the illness. A Question of Latitude 173 Others, who refused to be cured, she had turned over, with a shrug, to her husband. This one was more difficult. Of men of Everett s traditions and education she had known but few; but she recognized the tyj c. This young man was no failure in life, no derelict, no outcast living the law, or a scandal, to hide in the jungle. I le was what, in her Maxim days, she had laughed at as an aristocrat. He knew her Paris as she did not know it: its history, its art. Even her language he sjioke more correctly than her husband or herself. She knew that at his home there must be many wom- en infinitely more attractive, more suited to him. than herself: women of birth, of  x si- tion; young girls and great ladies of the other world. And she knew, also, that in his present state, at a nod from her he would cast these Itehind him, and carry her into the wilderness. More quickly than she anticipated. Everett proved she did not over-rate the forces that com- pelled him. The excursion to the rapids was followed by a second dinner on ttoard the Xigcri t. But now, as on the previous night, Everett fell into sullen silence. lie ate nothing, drank continually, and with his eyes de- voured the woman. When coffee had been served, he left the others at table, and with Madame Ducret slowly j aced the deck. As they passed out of the reach of the lights, he drew her to the rail, and stood in front of her.   I am not quite mad,  he said,   but you have got to come with me." To Everett all he added to this sounded sane and final. He told her that this was one of those miracles when the one woman and the one man who were predestined to meet had met. He told her he had wished to marry a girl at home, but that he now saw that the desire was the fancy of a school- ing. He told her he was rich, and offered her the choice of returning to the Paris she loved, or of going deeper into the jungle. There he would set up for her a princi- pality, a state within the State. He would defend her against all comers. He would make her the Queen of the Congo.  T have waited for you thousands of years     he told her. His voice was hoarse, shaken, and thick.  I love you as men loved women in the Stone Age fiercely, entirely. I will not be denied. Down here we arc cave people; if you fight me, I will club you and drag you to my cave. If others tight for you, I will kilt them. I love you,  he panted,  with all my soul, my mind, my body, I love youf I will not let you go " Madame Ducret did not say she w'as in- sulted, liecause she did not feel insulted. She did not call to her husband for help, lw.vau.se she did not need his help, and    - cause she knew that the ex-wrestler could break Everett across his knee. She did not even withdraw her hands, although Everett drove the diamonds deep into her lingers.  You frighten me'   she pleaded. She was not in the least frightened. She only was sorry that this one must be discarded among the  incurables.  In apparent agitation, she whisjHrred,  To-morrow  To-morrow I will give you your answer.  Everett did not trust her, did not release her. He regarded her jealously, with quick suspicion. To warn her that he knew she could not cscapc from Matadi, or from him, he said,  The train to Leoj oldvillc does not leave for two days.   I know   whispered Madame Duiret soothingly.  I will give you your answer to-morrow at ten.  She emphasized the hour, because she knew at sunrise a special train would carry her husband and herself to Leopoldville, and that there one of her husband's steamers would Ix-ar them across the Pool to French Congo.  To morrow, then   whispered Everett, grudgingly.  But I must kiss you now   Only an instant did Madame Ducret hesitate. Then she turned her cheek.  Yes,  she assented. "You must kiss me now.  Everett did not rejoin the others. He led her back into the circle of light, anil loeked himself in his cabin. At ten the next morning, when Dili ret and hi  wife were well advanced toward Stanley Pool, Cuthbcrt handed Everett a note. Having been lold what it   nnt.iined, he did not move away, but, with his back turned, leaned Upon the rail. Everett, his eyes on tire with triumph, his fingers trembling, tore ojK-n the envelope Madame Ducret wrote that her hus- band and herself fell that Mr. Everett was suffering more severely from the climate 174 The Errant Pan than he knew. With regret they cancelled their invitation to visit them, and urged him. for his health s sake, to continue as he had planned, to northern latitudes. They hoped to meet in Paris. They extended assurances of their distinguished consid- eration. Slowly, savagely, as though wreaking his suffering on some human thing, Everett tore the note into minute fragments. Mov- ing unsteadily to the ship s side, he flung them into the river, and then hung limply upon the rail. Above him, from a sky of brass, the sun stahl ed at his eyeballs. Below him, the rush of the Congo, churning in muddy whirlpools, echoed against the hills of naked rock that met the naked sky. To Everett, the roar of the great river and the echoes from the land he had set out to reform, carried the sound of gigantic, hideous laughter. THE ERRANT PAN By George T.

ON HORSEBACK TO KINGDOM COME By John Fox, Jr. I L I. I S T M A 1 I O N S It V was the turning    int n the days of June. 'r m a little town, round which mountains an in endless green raves, a little sorrel horse lore a pair of deer- kin saddle pockets, a cowboy saddle, and a man through the big gap that lets Kentucky coal to Virginia iron ore down in the south- western part of the  ld Dominion. Thread- ing its way somewhere over the billowy mountains, across the Slate line, is a little Kentucky creek known as Kingdom Come. Once, several years ago, the man on horse- back had gone down that stream with a homeless waif by the name of Chad and a homeless dog whom his little master railed Jack. He had lived on that creek, as did these two, with a family of Turners who had taken both waifs to their hearts anil home. Afterward the man kept on going back there with the boy ever - now' and then until, as the man fondly ho  edt the lad had in his own upward struggle epitomized our social history from the log-cabin to the Greek portico until, as far as the man knew, the lad had left the creek forever and followed the flight of an eagle westward, carrying his civilization after the yellow trail of the sun. And yet, for all this pur- pose of the man, the boy will be remem- bered by the people who knew him only as  The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come.  This, however all of it had l ccn make- believe, and now ihe man who had done his best to help the boy live as well  and as long  as possible was going over to see Kingdom Come with the eyes of his body instead of his mind. The big hills al out looked drowsy and dreaming of midsummer. The great rocks, so bare and desolate in winter, were set- tling to rest under shaggy rugs of deep green, and to the circling horizon and up to the zenith the blue air was clear and still. Below, the unseen river ran like dream music and one lone wood-thru h C.ioki.i Wiur. iit gave voice to the upper world of leaves. Through the Gap the bridle trail of Chad s forefathers had  teen widened to a wagon road; on either side of the river gleamed a pair of winding steel rails and the trees were blackened ami half choked to death by the heavy smoke that rolled from the funnel of every passing engine. Here and there the river-bed had been changed and further on a gang of convicts were making a grade for a trolley line. At the other mouth of the gap, too. a small town was springing up, and there 1 found a friend of the old   boom  days building an ice plant  1 told him where 1 was going.  Alone   I nodded.  Well, I wouldn t take that trip for a hundred dollars. Taking anything to eat    I made the time-honored answer:  No, only a little something for a snakc-bite.  "Well, you'll have to keep tight all the time to keep from starving.  Now in the old days 1 had known this man tn live on  sow-bclly    and corn bread and sleep in the mud for a month at a time. Thus in the lap of luxury had he been un- manned. There I turned up a creek toward one of the great mines opened in the low rich llanks of the Big Black Mountains that are now yielding hundreds for the dimes ihey cost twenty years ago. The hills showed now strip  cd of trees, fire-scalded, and cov- ered with dead logs, and not a seedling visi- ble to take their places: it looked not only like criminal waste but a disregard of the unborn that was little short of fiendish. Soon I flushed into ihe mining town past cabins in which were ihe tired licdraggled wives of Swedes. Huns. Finns, Italians, Americans, white and black, but not of mountaineers they were off attending their garden patches. The road was tilled with healthy dirty-faced children and fat pigs. Here ami there was a flower in a liille yard and a dead jiorker in the creek. The Duke was waiting for me on his porch  75 170 On Horseback to Kingdom Come  the Duke, so-called because he was said to Ik  waiting for a title, a seat in Par- liament. an I a fat living somewhere in England. Meantime he was working, and working hard, for the Duke was none of your remittance men.  It is fierce, you know, the waste, but, you know, we really can t help it. It s too expensive, you know, really to pile the bally brush and burn it, and you have no law in this country against a chap carrying matches, you know, in the woods as they have in Germany. And, you know, forest fires and what is the use of seedlings, you know  We do the best we can but we can't help it. The waste products of those ovens would pay the expense of keeping them going, but, you know, we are too far from the markets." Now if I had known as much as the Duke credited me with I should have gone back home and started a peripatetic school of philosophy, so after a bite to eat and a sip of Scotch and soda 1 went on my way. What that way was I had yet to learn Oid man Caudle on top of Black Mountain might tell me.and after a lalxirious climb up the rocky deep-rutted road 1 found the old man not at home. 1 recalled his house, however, an ex-blind-tigeron the State line, and I recalled a battle there a year or two before, in whii h a deputy 1 knew and a moonshiner had been killed. There was a teamster ill front of the house, however, who was doing something to his wagon in the road, and he said one could get to the headwaters of Kingdom Come bv Rich- mond's old Fields, but the paths forked so much it would be hard to keep the right road.  But." he drawled uiismilingly,  thar s al ays another way o  gittin  to the head of any crick go to the mouth an' ride up hit." In other words, I could go down Black Mountain and over Pine Mountain and down the Kentucky to Whitesburg in Letcher County, and thence on down the middle fork of the Kentucky River, and I was bound to strike the mouth of that heavenly named stream sometime.  Are those bullet holes around that win- dow " I asked, pointing to the house.     h, I reckon thar's some thar yit,  lie answered carelessly, and went on tinkering with hi  wagon, tinini; on down the pre- cipitous, rich-loamed northern slope of the Big Black, I was vaguely aware that I had missed something in my interview with the teamster and in a minute 1 had it he had not asked my name or my business. Some change was taking place in those hills, since I had last been among them, and dropping on down through the thick cov- erts in which wood-thrushes were fluting everywhere, along wonderful carpets of bcar-weeds and under wonderful primeval trees and to the head of the creek 1 found other changes. The log-eabin was no more. The houses were tidy, weather-boarded, and painted; men were ploughing industriously in the fields; I passed children in the road, no longer in tatters, and with school-books in their hands, and not a soul asked who I was and what I was doing over there. Evidently the stranger was no longer a rare bird along that creek; curiosity was slack and suspicion was gone. I found the Poor Fork of theCumberland narrow and shallow. Across the ford was a new little settlement springing up around a saw-mill and a logging camp. Pine trees grew thicker as I climbed Pine Mountain  naturally. Somewhere over to the left Chad and Jack had unknowingly taken the trail for the headwaters of Kingdom Come, and 1 was glad to know a better way for the wagon road, heaven knows, was bad enough. Within two hours the middle fork of the Kentucky River gleamed before me broad- er than the Cumberland, but just as shal- low because of the much logging done on that stream. Along it. too. the houses were weather-boarded and there were evidences of even more prosperity than on the Cum- berland. for the people there had been longer in touch with the outside world. At sunset I rode into Whitesburg which was as quiet and peaceful and as neat and tidy as a village in New England. Twice a musket I loomed from the river, but it was no feudist or bad man with his linger on the trigger, but only some fellow shooting a mess of bass: soon the mountain people will be loo   ivilized even for that. In that town I used tn stop at a little brick hotel how it hap- jienc-d to be built of brick I never knew  and now as I drew up at the gate a woman was i oming out:   Our folks are  i  k.  she said,  and we don't keep travellers no more, but Steve Held there will take you in.  She waved On Horseback to Kingdom Come 177 her hand to the comer of the street where a tall, clean-shaven young man  .u on the curli-stone strong of face anil reserved.  Yes," he said quietly, "1 can take you in." A short man with sandy hair and a t iuei blue eye took my horse and my host t.n k from me my saddle-bags another pleasant   hange from older days when each traveller was supposed to do such little things for himself. Not yet even was my name asked. " 1 used to know a lawyer over here by the name of Field." 1 said. "I'm his son." said the tall young man gravely, and still he did not ask my name. I began to feel slighted and I told him. He looked at me with sharp interest.  So. you're the man." he said, and in silence he led the way to his house on the hill, which was a new one, two stories in height, and with a veranda and a back porch. It was growing dark now and I knew their supjier was long over. "Please don t let your wife go to any trouble about supper. Anything cold will do.

I was sorry 1 could not recall that day and he .- nn  kcd in silence. And lhen, by and by:  I..its of us over here who have read your books think you are all right," he said naively. This was cheering news, for it had not been always like this jn the olden days. I recalled having no little trouble over my My iiJit Ti foa'ii ir   n y toddle-ba v Vol. XLVIII said, and I knew I was going to get the best he had in all ways, whether I would or not.

However, his dying word had been heeded and we had ridden in safety to and from the Gap to the county seal for years. Youtig Field shook his head.  'It ' a wonder, for the mountain j eoplc thought you were too high-minded and meddlesome over there, but. by and by, they got io understand that all you were after was law and order, and now all the good folks among us are with you.

It was full tlark when we went back to the porch, and the town Itelow us was black as Erebus and -till as a grave when I walked down the hill with my host. Down there hardly a light was visible.

Geographically I was wrong, said the druggist, but that wa  gen- erously parsed over:    It was near enough," said the druggist,  tor a story-piece." Flies were buzzing like a hive of bees in my room when I went to bed but, apparently, they went to deep when I did, and I was awakened shortly after daylight to more honey, ham, biscuit, and milk, and. ten minutes later, I was astride the little sorrel and ready for the way to Kingdom Come. Even at that early hour the lifelessne   of the town was almost drowsy in effect. Stores were open but no customers were visible, and each proprietor sat in a cane bottomed chair in front of his door with entire indifference, apparently, as to whether any purchaser should ever come again. And yet, back in the hills there was many an old woman who would have complained, if she had    :e fn n tlx porch d.rcctcd one  idj been obliged to live there, that the noise and bustle of the place made her head ache. The chief man of the town had a sister living at the head oi Kingdom Come, I learned to my great satisfaction, and, forti- fied with accurate directions, I turned the little sorrel and,everybody from curb-stone, doorway, and porch regarding me curiously and silently, 1 rode down the street and through a dock of geese into the river. II Tm; morning was very beautiful, and the air was cool but prescient of rain. The sandy road was very good and followed the river s brim, skirting meadows and com-liclds and wooded spurs and cliffs  threaded with delicate vines, green with moss, shining with trickling water, and lighted above with riotous blooms of rhod  - dendron. Often it crossed the river in which the sorrel's feet would scatter min- nows in a sun-break of terror, and now and then it would   limb a  ross a spur where a quail would run like a ballet dancer across it: and always the calls of ploughmen r   c dear from the deep valley below. Seven miles down such a way was the mouth of i t A w. ite  p  4P J aril I i -e to u -  Tarxied Page   4 Kingdom Come, and it was ;i' hard as ".d- vaiion getting there.

There were quicksands in that river-bed and rocks to make the -in- ner stumble, and one water-hole more than saddle-skirt deep in- deed, no element, no symbol, was lai kins' in tiut orthodox way to tilorv Everlasting   n Vjp Kingdom Come. But fcjig  s  I gt t there at last, and ' 1 among the pebbles on Tvjti, . a tk-t s' . i " that shining shore I pulled up short with a little prayer for the mercies that thus far had been mine. I suppose that every writ- er of stories. having learned that fat t is too strange material for fiction,acquires in lime a faculty in selecting the usable  average that seems like- an instinct. It was, of course, bc- i ause tlu  mouth of that creek was so like tht  mouths i .f other creeks I had seen that I had a poignant sense of actually having been there l etore. There were the logs on the sand waiting for the tide, when they would be bound together by the Turners and float Chad down to his adventures in the low land Blue Grass. The wooded hills were the hills 1 had known in the story, anti right then I could hear Jack on his way alter the scattered sheep up the spur to my right, Chad hieing him on. anti old man Turner bellowing from the river bank. To my left ran the road to the old school-house, and over the hill rail the road along which came Chad s tired feet on his return from the Capital. Ami there was a living Melissa peeping for one swift instant at me from a little out-house a hundred yards away. One thins  only I should have had to change to hit the iacts of the fiction. There was a bill instead of a valley where the Turner house stood, but perhaps that had been up- heaved there recently. Indeed, so real was On Horseback to Kingdom Conic 1S3 it all that, when 1 started on, 1 found myself with a hcartachc a.s keen as though 1 hail come back to a place where I had once lived, and from which had gone forever real people whom 1 had loved there many years ago. 1 rode by the out house to get another scroll work, and painted, too, with trim- mings of vivid blue. Kingdom Come was also thickly  x pulated for a mountain stream, and there was such a house every few hundred yards. Six miles up was the head of the stream where lived such a The tuitc% Mere the   '_c uia tuitct i.iul   JiuU thfummni its glimpse of Melissa, l ut -he showed her face no more. 1 shouted  Hello  " and. as the rest of the family was doubtk  out in the fields at work and 1 feared to frighten her. I rode on and left her crouched hiding on the floor. The Itcd of Kingdom Come down whirh Chad had helped to tloat log.-, was sur- prisingly broad, and though there was little water now and that was shallow, indeed  the banks showed marks of the torrents that could come down. Kingdom Come, too, wore a prosperous air. I lere, too, the houses were weather-boarded. Sometimes a porch was latticed and decorated with family the Fraziers -as Chad fell among, and there I was 1h uii.I Narrower got the stream and closer together came the hills, so that I was obliged to ride for hundreds of yards along its shining pebbly bed. I passed an ugly pulling little grist-mill, nin by steam, instead of the dreaming, dripping old water-wheel of other days. At almost every house 1 shouted an inquiry and still I was not asked my name. In front of every house geese were plentiful in the creek, and once 1 got down to pit k up a beautiful goose i uill which 1 brought home with me, but the folly of sentiment is not leading me to SI 1 1 On I lorsehack to Kingdom Come try to pen these words with it. Instead, I am pith king them out with two lingers from a typewriter  perhaps they read that way , for other things than Kingdom Come have i hanged The sun was high now, I was dose to the last upward  light of Pine Mountain.and 1 was getting hungry. From a hill-side came the faint clanking of chains from a plough mule being led to the stable for his mid-dav meal, and through the green little defile ahead I saw an orchard the Fraziers  at last Little did I guess that I should find Mother Turner and Melissa and Chad, too, waiting for me there not as they were fifty years ago, l ut as they would have I teen now. Ill Thf. green orchard was surrounded by a picket fence with sharp palings sharpened by hand- Within was a row of bcc-gum hives. Beyond the on hard was a log stable  a   ery old one. Above the green showed the roof of the house the shingles - 0 cut and bevelled that for a moment I thought the roof was tiled, and 1 almost gasped. The ravine was narrow, the hills al out were precipitous, and one was cleared for corn to the very lop. Passing the orchard I came upon the house, weather-boarded. neatly painted, with scroll work and vivid trimmings. At the gate which led into the stable yard 1 shouted "Hello:" to an old lady who sat on the side porch.  Can I get something to eat here "  Yes,  was the unhesitating answer.   Come right in." A boy came to the yard gate to meet me and look my horse.   He s not used to being fed in the middle of the day," I said.  Oh, i'll give him a little,  said the lad. The garden was full of dowers old-fash- ioned ones, chiellv roses, two bushes of which i lambered in profusion around the corner of the neat house old and buill of logs. Mother Turner s face was kind and patient and creased with shrewd humor. I told mv name and the place I hailed from and she looked at me afresh with mild curi- osity.  I ve hecrd o  you." she said simply. Grandmother came in from the room, in whk h. Spirit of Progress. I saw a brass bed- stead. and she, loo. had the  ame face, with ihe listening look of the blind, the weariness of years,and dim eyes pathetic with the on- ward l  i k to another world. About both of them was the same brooding silence that encompassed the hills. Presently there was a light step on the back porch, a white vis- ion appeared in the other doorway, and I Sbe  .mm . u  i     n the .uni      f .r lur I'.iee   b'. On Horseback to Kingdom Come 185 rose to greet it startled. The hair was of pale gold, the brow broad and serene, and in the step was the strength and lithesome- ness of her eighteen years. Without shyness or embarrassment she held out her hand. Her throat was a proud column of alabas- ter, and her eyes were frank and straight- forward, big, and violet blue. Melissa i had never imagined lovelier than this moun- tain girl standing liefore me at the head of Kingdom Come, and Melissa would have been lovelier had 1 seen this girl first. Hut there was an atmosphere about her that had come from outside the hills, and 1 was not surprised to learn that she had been six months away at school. Indeed, Mother Turner had spent two weeks at some Springs beyond the Blue-grass only two months be- fore. The small boy came back and leaned against the porch and we sat there talking  asking questions and answering them mutually. To my astonishment I soon dis- covered that this pale Lily of Kingdom Come had a copy of  The Little Shepherd   given to her by a young man from Hindman, far over the mountains. Mother Turner had read it and liked it, but the Lily was non-committal as to the favor the hook had found with her, and I suspected that any value it had camc from the donor and not the humble author thereof. Soon she dis- appeared to her household duties, and presently down the steep hill camc men who had been working in her father s corn- field, with mule  clanking trace chains in- terspersed among them men and boys, a dozen of them. One by one they filed in at the gate and each with a glance of faint curiosity gave me a grave  How-dyc  as he passed. They were a patriarchal group of sons and nephews and grandson.-, anil neigh- Ijors, I soon learned, ami I could tell which were the neighbors by the little courtcsics that were shown them by the meml er.', of the family, even if I had not been able to pick the latter ones out by the pale yellow hair and blue eyes that evidently were fam- ily characteristics. Among them was a new atmosphere, too, for the pall of silence had Ixxn lifted by the spirit of newer limes and more contact with the outside world, though several of them one tall, gaunt, dark fel- low particularly were typical of the grim, taciturn mountaineer I had always known. After a wash-up, wc all trooped through the room where the brass bedstead was and Vol. XLVIIJ. 20 along the back porch to the kitchen, which was a separate house, where we sat down at a long tabic and were served by ihe Lily, her sister, and an older woman who was doubtless a daughter-in-law of the house. And a good meal it was. Everybody ate heartily and hurriedly, though not one but was watchful of the others' wants, ;md a  one man finished another came in and look hi  place. 1 looked in vain for a sign of sentiment from some one of the younger men toward the Lily, but 1 saw none at all, ami doubtless her lieauty and her exjieri cnce outside the mountains had lifted her to a point, or her ambition had taken her there, where none dared lift his eyes so high. Though she had been away to school she had dropped back, apj arently, into her old life, and I wondered what her dreams and longings might be in the loneliness of it all and the hard work that was plainly hers. As it looked like rain, the hands gathered in the porch after dinner and somebody asked somcliody to pick a tunc. One boy straight- way looked shy. He was a sturdy, good- looking lad with a nice face, and he might have  K scd for Chad except that there was no suggestion of the waif al  ut him, his hair was neatly parted in the middle, and his banjo was modern and new. But the tunes were the same old tunes that Chad had thrummed "Sourwood Mountain,  "Turkey in the Straw," etc. and he surely made the instrument hum. After a while eyes were cocked wcatherward and every- body rose to go back to work while I was hospitably bidden to stay and rest and, if possible, to spend the night. All said good  by and several urged me to come over again and go to a dance and have a good time. Thereafter, the Lily showed her fair head only as 1 was getting ready to leave: Mother Turner gathered some flowers for me and put them in a pajtcr box so that I could take them back home. She brought out some twisted tobacco that she had had for eleven years and which was for sale at live cents a twist. She did not want me to think that I must purchase, but she did think I might like to have some. I took some and paid my bill which was absurdly small, for, said the old lady, it wasn t much of a dinner  I d like to have one that she thought was good , and my horse had eaten so little. Grandmother and Mother ISC On Horseback to Kingdom Come Turner said I must rome again, and so did the Lily when she shook hands, looking steadily with her frank hluc eves. And when I mounted mv horse at the yard gate, her mother spoke in a low voice to her, and she sprang from the porch and came out to open the outer gate for me. and her first faint blush was perceptible when perhaps I overdid my thank :  Don t you find it pretty lonesome here since you came back   I asked. Her lashes drooped and she nodded with a faint smile. Then she  t okcd up again.  You must come back to the mountains again.  I said I would, and I wish I could. Straight up a steep path I rode and at the edge of the woods I turned in my saddle and saw her golden head at the edge of the porch, but when she saw that I was looking she withdrew it and, though I looked back again, she was visible no more. A few hundred yards further tip I could see the head of a ravine into which, from other little ravines, the rain-drops trickled to  tart the little creek of Kingdom Come. There I turned over a spur, down a creek, and started up Pine Mountain, homeward bound. In les  than two hours I was cross- ing the Cumberland River and climbing the Big Black by a long disused bridle path which was rocky, sleep, swarming with  lies, ami where it wound the edges of rain washed clitls, almost dangerous. The sun was sinking when I reached the top, and there 1 hurried southward along the rich loamy crest of the Big Black so far that I began to get uneasy with the fear that I had missed my way, for it would be no fun to be lost in that wilderness even for a night, but at last I heard the welcome tinkle of a cow- bell and, passing through a little bunch of cattle, fat, sleek, curious, I emerged into the Richmond Old Fields bare of trees, grassy, uplifted, and still luminous from the afterglow. For a moment 1 stopped and turned for a parting look back over the wild Kentucky hills two hundred square miles of them through which ridges and streams flowed north-west, and the only regularity of which is a gradual diminishment in height toward the Blue-grass and on to the Western plains. Blueblack they were, solemn and wildly suggestive of dark deeds done and come  o light, of others known but never leaking into the outer world, and still others that will be mysteries until, like the sea, they, too, give up their dead. Down I dropj ed then by a trail that was steep, winding, and obstructed by stones, roots, and fallen trees; down at last to the head of a little creek, down through a syl- van dell that was heavy with wood smells and riotous with laurel and rhododendron  down until, below me, coke ovens flamed like a pit of hell. I had seen Kingdom Come but I had learned little aliout the stream. A fore- father of the family that dwelt at its source was the first settler there, in 1S16 that was all: for nobody even knew how the crock had got its name. But if, like Chad and Jack, any homeless waif and his dog, as well may happen at any time, should be wandering along the top of Pine Mountain, I could wish no more for them than a haven in the hospitable little home that shelters the Lily of Kingdom Come. 1 THE MAN AT THE WHEEL By E. W. Hornung lU.USTfcATIONS BY FhED 1 EGKAM OSWALD ALFRED SMART had been christened  by permission  alter the suburban magnate to whom his father was coachman at the time of the urchin s birth; and the two names went so well in double harness, as the coach- man said, that they were never heard singly about the stables, although Mrs. Smart was very particular to say "our  Oswald Alfred, even when employing the vocative case, in respectful contradistinction to the master. Both Air. and Mrs. Smart seem to have had their work cut out with the boy, who often had a stick about his back for his hot yet sullen temper, which was not cured by the treatment. He had, how- ever, from his earliest years, when his bet- ter side was uppermost, a smile so sun.;  and so sudden as to transmute his leaden look to radiant gold. And it was largely this smile which got Oswald Alfred his engagements when, as a son of the house remarked, he "put the lid on  a consist- ently unfilial attitude by turning chauffeur at the lirst opportunity. The old coachman, who knew the lad's temperament, though his knowledge of motor-cars was contined to keeping his car- riage out of their way, enjoyed a gloomy view of the venture from the first. His confident misgivings were amply realized. Oswald Alfred s hot head lost him more than one situation in the first year, but not before he had cost successive employers large sums in lines and repairs, because they liked him for his eager alacrity and always ho  cd he would improve. His smile never failed to secure him a fresh start elsewhere; and as his sins were not due to lack of skill, but were purely a mat- ter of nervous temperament, he went on I Hotter than he deserved until a really bad accidcnt got into all the papers and ought clearly to have closed a dangerous career. Old Smart was sanguine that it had, and made dogmatic computations as to what was not worth fifty bob a week; his atti- tude was one of chastened superiority on half that preposterous wage. But Oswald Alfred had not gone home after his other vicissitudes, and he was not going now to afford an object-lesson in accurate par- ental prophecy. He preferred to eat his heart out in his Shepherd s Bush lodg- ings, as long as his savings lasted, and sometimes even to squander them in de- fiant jaunts involving a very high collar and a rakish cigarette. But his luck held 187 Ml 1SS The Man at the Wheel good, by returning before hi  pocket  were quite empty, in the shape of a promising reply to his own reply to an advertise- ment for a chauffeur who  must ho young man." The young man invested in a higher col- lar than any in his now shabby stock, and slept on his best trousers before betaking himself to a Bloomsbury hotel to meet the gentleman with the funny name who had written to make the appointment. The gentleman had rather a funny face as well, dark and sallow, with eyes like chocolates; but there is never much light in Blooms- bury, at .iny rate in the month of February, and Oswald Alfred was not going to belie his stable upbringing in the matter of a gift horse; for he had a shrewd suspicion that it was  all right," from the first tunny accent  in keeping with the whole ftcrson- ality of the advertiser, and of a piece with the curious locution   which the applicant had not noticed  in his advertisement. "So Smart is your name, young man  Smart of name and smart of nature, is it not  Mine, as you know, i  Ghum: by Ghum it is. like you say in the classic  I am very glad of you to swear by me, young man .  Oswald Alfred was merely embarrassed by these familiarities, for he had the in stincts of a Briti-h servant in every vein, and had no desire to be treated otherwise in his new employ. His skin turned a dusky red, which deejiened when Mr. Ghum displayed a startling knowledge of the accident which had cost him his last place. "We spot it in the morning rag." the dark gentleman explained, with a show of teeth and an increasing air of idiomatic mastery,  we remember your name, and have wonder if we might hear of you. How have tome you to meet such serious accident, young man " Oswald Alfred leaned forward front the edge . f hi  chair, and stated his case to the lining of his cap as even he had never stated it before. "It was like this, sir I'd been to meet my lady and gentleman at Victoria Station  London, Chatham and Dover. bir : and the boat was very kite, you see. and they d brought over a new French maid who'd never been in a car before; an  that s  ow the  ole affair come to  appen, sir.

The chocolate eyes regarded him with sleepy benevolence.  It was hard on as young a man like you,"  aid Mr. Ghum. "It was very 'ard, sir.   You deserve another opportunity.  " I should Ik- very grateful if you could give me one, sir." "And you would not find awful traffic our way, Mr I ilium added, as though the statement contained a joke; but the subjei t was no joke to Oswald Alfred. "I'm not afraid of traffic," he boasted with perfect truth; "but when 'orse-van drivers don t  old out their  ands they ought to he put in prison.

Oswald Alfred had pricked up the ears of a keen and catholic s M rtMTian; in fact, the newspaper of that name was even then folded carefully away in the pocket in which it was least likely to s niil the cut of a coat.  Kind of Jam, or something   he in- quired with interest.  Exactly  Quite  You hit it on the nail  His Highness the Jam Sahib of Boavista my royal master and yours who is to be " An ill-concealed levity rather spoilt the effect of this descriptive mouthful on Os- wald Alfred, but was soon forgotten in his joy over the terms that he succeeded in making for himself. It was wonderful how amenable Mr. Ghum proved to reason and Oswald Alfred s best smile. The lad had been getting fifty shillings in his last place, but of course keeping himself; in the new one he was promised forty and all found. It was not perhaps quite the kind of ar- rangement that a more independent chauf- feur would have been so ready to entertain, but the financial improvement was such that he would soon l c in a position to pick and choose again, unless he went and got into fresh trouble through the criminal negligence of others on the road. He was determined it should be through no faullof hisown; and the old coachman himself could not have excelled his son in di'trust of other drivers on the day that Mr. Ghum called for him with the car in Shepherd s Bush. The car. a sound second-hand Clcland- Talboys, had been driven thus far by a chauffeur from the works in N'otting Dale, where it had been some days undergoing rc  airs. Oswald Alfred very properly sought   articulars. and the works  chauf- feur was saying that so far as he knew there had been nothing at all the maticr with her, when Mr. Ghum closed a promising discussion by inquiring if Smart could find his way to the Portsmouth Koad. "Then the sooner the better we are on it,  he said curtly on getting an affirmative reply. "The car has been tune up for you, like they say in the classic; let me hear her melody without delay. Straight along the Portsmouth Koad but mint  you traps and when we arrive near Guild- ford I will give you direction.  It was one of those bitter afternoons which make the early spring for days to- gether as cold as the depths of winter, and even colder to the eye. There was no sun in the bleak sky, and no rain in ihe clouds that  lew there, but the trees looked black anil brittle against both, and ploughed fields cold as new graves behind the trees. Telegraph posts stood along the side strips of bleached grass, like sentinels frozen at attention, but here and there a live scout saluted with his reassuring grin. Mr. Ghum s;it and shivered behind the wind- screen in a coat like a dancing bear s; and the warm young blood at his side did dance with the delight of rattling along an open road again, and that without interference or complaint. Mr.  ilium raised no objec- tion to thirty-five miles on the speedometer, nor yet to taking a corner on the wrong side or bucketing over patches of new metal, all of which were old tricksof the new chauffeur. If the Jam himself was as sensible it mi ht be a pleasant place both on and off the car. And a pleasant place it proved, at all events in the way of creature comforts and letting a man alone at his job; but Oswald Alfred did speedily find himself lonelier at other times than suited his habit as he liked to live. This again was a mere effect of causes in themselves both strange and disagreeable. There wasn t a female in the house, for instance; dusky heathen shuffled about the kitchen, and the new- comer's was the one white skin on the premises. Dusky heathen jabbered and guzzled in drawing-room and dining-room, and fresh relays were always being taken to the station or met there by the car. So it all seemed to Oswald Alfred. There was room for any number of the savages, as he himself was savage enough to call them in his heart; for the house had Wen formerly a preparatory school, and there were beds still in Ihe dormitories, whither and whence the chauffeur was too often prevailed upon to carry weird bits of bag- gage. There were empty class rooms, too, that gave him a chill when he passed their neglected windows. Yet it was a pretty house when the sun shone on its red brick 190 The Man at the Wheel and tiles, and its modern leaded casements, all so racy of the Surrey soil that sur- rounded it with sombre i:edars and with yew hedges no longer of rectangular cut. The chief drawback was that it was a long way down a lane, which was a longer way down another lane: in fact, a more precious- spoken Oswald Alfred might have charac- terized the place as an oasis of bricks and timber in awildcmessof bracken and gorse. Our Oswald Alfred confined himself to phrases like "the back of beyond,  except on the subject of his never iteing allowed out anywhere alone, which moved him to the ruder eloquence of his old stable days. Tie never knew when his car might not be wanted, and was always expected to be on the spot himself in case of emergency. Of course he would never have stood it, had it not meant a steady saving of two pounds a week, and a "chit   which was Mr. Cihum's synonym for a  character   whensoever he elected to leave of his own accord. But the youth was so well board- ed and lodged  in what had lieen the sick- house of the departed school , and such was the consideration  hown him in smaller matters, that he wisely resisted any in- clination lo make another change before the summer. His Highness the Jam Sahib of Boavista  a name painted, curiously enough, on the garden gate  was the only member of the strange establishment to whom the new chauffeur took a real dislike; and it was not justifiable, inasmuch as the Jam never vouchsafed a word to him in praise or blame. He had a lean, mean face and figure, in striking contrast to his courtier tihum. who was gross and genial; but it was the subdued ferocity with which his Highness would let his followers have it. in their own lingo, that made Oswald Alfred bustle before the ruthless lips had time 10 open tire on him. lie gathered from    hum that the potentate was loading his present quiet and modest life under doctor's orders and the sympathetic ;egis of the Ini  eri.il Government. Motoring was stated to be part of the treatment, ami yet they did not motor daily, nor on the likeliest days, nor yet always when the chosen day was at its best.   ften it would be the latter part of a dismal after- noon before Oswald Alfred went skidding through the muddy lanes with the burly Ghum beside him, his Highness and minor satellites abreast behind, and the acetylene head-lamps duly primed by order; for the Jam and his suite did not dissemble a natural kindness for dusk and darkness. Neither did the white youth object to either, or even to the crew he drove, when he was driving them  for they none of them interfered with him any more than Mr. Ghum had done, but let him go like the wind in the shortest of clear spaces, and cram on the brakes to his heart s con- tent at the corner; so refreshing was their freedom from the little knowledge which is the al  minable thing from a chauffeur s point of view. Ghum, however, was by way of acquiring some, but only from Os- wald Alfred, who gave him indifferent driving lessons with little method and less regularity. 1'he party usually drove one way; but it was the most obvious way in the geograph- ical circumstances. Guildford and God- aiming ought to have been able to pick out the second-hand Cleland-Talboys even from the band of cars that tlows over the fly- wheels of their main streets from dawn to dark; it was never quite dark when they clattered through to fly Hindhead like a hurdle; but they always lit up al outthcsame place, just off the Portsmouth Road in the neighborhood of Liphook. Here may lie found one of those impressively extrava- gant, because solid and interminable walls, whiih are by no means such a feature of the home counties as of the shires. Vet there was a jtoint of this noble circle which was n   great distance from the worthy pile within; the drive was not a long one; and a side gate, which came first, afforded a still shorter cut to the house. It was through this gale that the motor- ists, 011 foot for the purpose, were   eep- ing, one lighting-uj -time at the beginning of March; 3nd Oswald Alfred, attend- ing to his own business with a box of matches, was taking as little interest as usual in theirs. He had gathered, from remarks dropped in Ghum's Knglish, that H.H. had hi  royal eye on the place as a more fitting English seat than the deserted school; but he hail no idea to whom it be- longed. Suddenly a bicycle Ik-H rang out l etween him and the peeping gentry at the gate, startling them more than himself, and causing an obsequious pantomime on their The Man at the Wheel 191 part in honor of the elderly gentleman who had jumped off the bicycle. Oswald Al- fred was particularly impressed to see the Jam Sahib making as deep an obeisance as the youngest of his followers; he could only suppose they had been surprised by some very great jjersonage indeed.  Good evening, my friends " cried the cyclist in a rich, kind voice.  Come to have another look at my kangaroo, have you    Sir,  replied the Jam, bowing lower than l efore,  some of these gentlemen had not the felicity of being present on the occasion to which you graciously refer I was therefore taking the audacious lib- erty-   Nonsense   interposed the cyclist, heartily.

Meanwhile Oswald Alfred was marvelling to find that after all his Highness could speak   ctter English, when it suited him. than any of his retinue, and yet that his tone did not sweeten with his words. His tone had been bitter and truculent in some curiously subtle degree, which incurred no snub yet could penetrate the patriotic hide of a British coachman s son, and inject the virus of a vague resentment. Next mo- ment the cyclist was giving his natural enemy the chauffeur a kindly word as well, and in the twin cones of acetylene gaslight the chauffeur recognized his great man at a glance.  Good evening, my lord   returned Os- wald Alfred, with ready salute and the smile which had lain fallow at Boavista.  Have we met before " inquired the other in a tone l oth puzzled and amused. "No, my lord, but I see it was Lord Amyott as soon as ever you come in front of the lamps. I seen your lordship's por- trait many a time when you was out at the war." There was genuine enthusiasm in this sjiecch, for Oswald Alfred had a nice capac- ity for discriminating resjtcvl, inherited from the parent who had insisted on so christening him after the master. Lord Amyott. however, did not seem particular- ly Muttered, and his wiry while mustache looked closer-cropped than before on its granite pedestal of rhin. "All, well. I'm in another part of the empire now," said he, "and only home for a few weeks, like our friends from the same place." He jerked his head toward the gate through which they had gone, and then stared harder at Oswald Alfred.   You ain't the chauffeur they had the other day  " he added.   I ve been in my situation a fortnight, my lord," was the considered reply.  Do you know what happened to the other fellow "  1 never 'card, my lord."  No more did I, and I should like to know. Nice lad, I thought him.  Lord Amyott stepped up nearer to the bonnet, and lowered his voice.  Do they ever let you out of their sight " he asked, grimly, but as though it were rather a joke as well.  Never off the premises, my lord."  They never let him  I suppose he couldn't stand it. But I should like to know.  Oswald Alfred was not to be outdone in dramatic undertones.   It's all the Jam " said he sepulchrally.  All the what " "  Im that spoke to your lordship; his Royal Highness the Jam Sahib, explained Oswald Alfred, feeling that he was indeed moving in exalted circles, and unconsciously adding to the altitude. But Lord Amyott only burst out laughing under his breath, after catching it in sheer surprise.  Does he really rail himself that "  Only in fun. my lordship, only in fun   urged a silky voice; and the oleaginous Ghum stood fawning between the speakers in the acetylene rays; how he had returned without a sound, or whether he had ever gone off with the rest, neither knew. He was the man, however, for an awk- ward moment, with his sleek and supple tact, and his engaging idiosyncrasies of sj cech. Oswald Alfred, for one, was easily convinced that the whole concoction of the title, unwittingly suggested by himself, as he was bound to admit, had   cen all along 102 The Man at the Wheel an claltorate joke at bis own expense. Perhaps, however, it was Lord Amyott s laughter that carried most conviction, de- s;iit.  a grim note of its own; but when he really had mounted his bicycle, and disap- peared round the In-nd in the direction of the main gates and the keejx-r s lodge, the unhappy young man was quickly and quiet- ly informed of the enormity he had com- mitted in speaking of the Jam as such.  Did you not know,  cried  thum,  that he was in this country incogs  If I should tell him how you have given away, you go same way as last chauffeur without mo- ment s hesitation.   And what way was that " asked Os- wald Alfred, remembering I.ord Amyott s inquiries; but the question made Ghum angrier than anything else.  Never mind you " said he.  You know what happens to servants who do not lake satisfaction; let him be a warning to you. I will not tell his Highness what you have done. I dare not. It is more than 1 am worth.   But is he 'is 'ighness   demanded the young man. " First you say it s all a cod, and then you talk as if it wasn t.   Of course it i n t " the other declared in all solemnity.  He is exactly what 1 said him; the title is not invention or beastly lie. Il is the whole truth, ami nothing but the whole, only his Highness want it kept up the sleeve.  'Phis was not quite good enough for the young man; he had heard Lord Amyott s first and loudest laugh: and his faith was shaken to its base. His imagination was stimulated, which was worse; it fastened on the last i haufleur and his fate, in wlmh even a world s hero like Ixinl Amyott V.C.  and ever so many less popular letters of the alphabet  had shown stn h interest. Oswald Alfred was in fat t a good deal dis- turbed by his conversation with his lord- ship; but it was an experience that lift him --till more proud, and he was seriously Lhinking of drilling a hole through the sovereign a noble hand had slipj ed into his. His imagination, however, was strength- ened in it  hold on a disagreeable subject by a little circumstance which occurred on the way back that evening. On Hind- head a lire huuq ed heavily, and was dis- covered down: and the dark crew disem- barked while the young white man jacked up his wheel and put on the Stepney. The spot was close to the famous Gibbet, and the quartette not only strolled on to the memorial stone by the roadside, but one of them returned for a side-lamp with which to illuminate the inscription. Now the chauf- feur knew parts of "this by heart, having bought picture post-cards of the stone  erected in detestation of a barbarous mur- der when putting up at the Huts in his last employ. As he wrestled with his wheel he heard an uncouth clucking of alien tongues; but it was not this that made him look up, and left the bad impression on his mind; it was the sudden chorus of cacophonous merriment, and the S  eciacle of four human beings leaning back in a patch of lamp- light, on the grassy brink of a black abyss, and holding their sides before the record of the cruel deed once done there.  They want tipping into it,  thought Oswald Alfred;  the Devil's Punchbowl's just altout their mark.  Their heathen behavior might not have struck him without Lord Amyott's previous inquiries after the last chauffeur, and those inquiries might not have stuc k in his mind if the heathen had not behaved so that evening.

Nor was it quite nice to lie awake, wondering about one s predecessor, in his very l cd, and that the only one in a separate building contain- ing several loc ked rooms or  H tcntial Blue- l eard chambers. That night he thought of giving noticc in the morning, and perhaps making off Itefore his week was up, but a series of fine spring days hardened the lad in his original determination to  stick it" till the summer. He was no coward, when all was said in his disfavor, and as a rule he showed your real road hog s plentiful lack of imagina- tion. He was not going to be a fool and forfeit a clear two  H unds a week, and no silly complaints. Even the now formida- ble Ghum made no further allusion to the indiscretion altout the Jam, did not hold it over a fellow, but seemed to have forgot- ten all about it, and only redoubled the ardor of his own efforts to learn to drive the car. The Man at the Wheel But you may tcach a man to drive like an arrow when there is nothing else on the Ripley Road, anil yet never know when a wobble of the wheel or a fool on the wrong pedal may spell instantaneous disaster. It was only a wing and a step that Mr. Chum damaged to the like detriment of a  Kissing car; but he was seen no more .it the wheel, and it was Smart Sahib  as the menials sometimes callcd him with rolling eyes  who took a select load in the favorite direi lion about a week after their last encounter with Lord Amvott. This time, however, it was the middle of the evening before they started. And no serret was made of their intention to sec l-ord Amyott again, and as it certainly appeared to Oswald Alfred, by appointment. Over Hindhead hung a skvful of stars, and if there were fewer to l c seen from the lane near Liphook, it was not the fault of stars or sky. This time no wistful peep- ing into Paradise, but confident entry at the side gate on the part of that j tow er- ful Peri Mr. Ghum and hi  serene master. The white youth scarcely noticed that a dark one quieUv took the vacant seat In- side him, that another leant as quietly against the Stepney wheel, or for that mat- ter that there had been four of them seated behind instead of three. It was not a night on which you noticed all you ought; the stars were too beautiful, sparkling lo the eyes as the keen air did in the mouih and lungs. And for long enough nothing was to be heanl but those small noises of the country night, which can mean so little individually to a cockney soul like Oswald Alfred's, yet perhaps so much in the mass. At all events he was not feeling frightened, or mean, or particularly anxious for further relations with Lord Amyott, or to give notice lx-fore he was given it, or to drive a six-cvlinder at sixty miles an hour, when the new note of a lumbering gait and lalioured breathing recalled him to his motor-self Ii wa  old Ghum blundering through the side gate.

XLVIII. 21 these stertorous ejaculations had merged into native patter. Ghum was assisted into his old place, the driver climbed over him into his, and otT they went with ilanging gears and clashing lever.  Wait till I let her out   muttered the man at the wheel, and gave the second hand Cleland-Tallmvs gas enough to drive a motor-bus. The gray lane wobbled under her lumps, plm ked out of darkness in brill- iant ovals, and the low wall wavered on the edge of the halo. Lane and wall bore con- tinuously to the left, but Oswald Alfred took 110 heed of the obtuse corners, and only blew his horn when a couple of figures ap ieared like motes in the advancing gas- beam; they luul plenty of time lo get out of the way, but they l  th jumped for their lives in a style that made the heathen squeal with joy; anti only al ihc last moment, which was the next moment, and the worst in all his life, did Oswald Alfred see who they were. One was. that villainous Jam. showing nothing but his teeth ami the whiles of his evil eyes; the other was a while shirt-front with pearl .studs in il, a black lie. a collar, and a cropjted mustache of which every silver bristle stood out as Lord Amyott reeled anil stumbled in front of the car. There was a horrible impact, bui no bump- ing over the mass of black and white that whirled out uf the Italu like a wounded magpie. Meanwhile, at the ultimate or j enulti- male moment of recognition, Oswald Alfred had applied his brakes with such reiklc-ss violence that a less heavily-weigh ted car might have completed the tragedy by turn- ing a somersault on the fatal sj ot; but the overcrowded Clcland-Talboys ground it- self to a shivering standstill in its own length Ami the white driver started to his feet ln-hind the wheel  He dune it  He s murdered  is lord- ship  1 saw the swine give 'im a push with both ands " So he began on the trio behind, dinging an accusing arm after the wretch who was already stooping over his mangled magpie in the bracken. A patch of white shirt showed through the fronds; and to his un- speakable indignation the chaufTcur -siw a kick dealt il, and the white roll over into black, l eforc the brutal leader rejoined his grinning band.

But that sjioilt it: nothing under thirty-live an hour would make a job of it. and after all that was impossible at the top of a long hill. He caught himself breathing again. Ghum came to his assistance at the same inMant. " Faster  faster." he hissed again, with his barrel against the young man's ribs.  Come to stoppage this side Boa- vista, and you join the lordship this very night   The brute s breath was on his cheek, deep-dyed with shame in the zone of light outside the Huts: a few loiterers were left idly gaping, neither more nor less inter- ested in the carload of criminals than in the hundreds a day it was their fate to suffer from; and once more the oval searchlight darned ahead in the darkness. There was light, too. in Oswald Alfred s brain, where the sullen embers had been funned lo passionate flame by the vile breath on his cheek and the succulent threat in his ear. The wretches Iwhind were keeping   uiet in ihe silent company of their crime and its risks: he wasglad Ghum had spoken, lo remind him what wretches they all were.

Ghum looked that way intended; for the young man was curiously determined not to ilie by a hullet, and this time his hand  did nut fail him at the last. Round went the wheel, and round came the storied stone, clean across the headlamps; a fringe of limelit gorsc rose vividly between them and the pitchy void; there was a whir of wheels in the air, a lurch into space, and so the chapter ended for the occupants of the second-hand Cleland-Talbovs. Vet not for all. because bv day the place is not what a dark night paints it, and there are always some who fall clear of a car. There was one great unscathed scoundrel who stood his trial at Guildford, who in- sisted on giving evidence in his own de- fence. and who nearly succeeded in getting the court cleared by reason of his strangely individual locution.'. Fourteen year' was his portion; but a young s  cctacled cottec- colored student. l eing crippled for life, was more leniently handled. Between these extreme cases of survival came a third, which was treated for a long time, anti with ultimate success, in a nurs- ing home near the scene of the catastrophe. It was summer, however, before Lord Am- yott was admitted there, on two sticks, and ushered into the patient s presente, to l c immediately rewarded by a wan but un- mistakable edition of the very brilliant smile which had taken his fancy by night outside his own side gate.  There are only two things I want to know," said Lord Amyott, in his kind rich voice.  I know all about most of it. in- cluding what hap K. ned to myself, mi please hold your tongue about that, my good fel- low  What I want to know i- whether the final thing was another accident, so far a  you were concerned, or whether you went mad and dul it on purpose as that rascal Ghum declared in the witness-lxw." Oswald Allred did not hesitate lon  . " I ditl it on pur   se,  he muttered  but 1 never went mad ." "In plain English, you absolutely meant to sentl the lot of them to hell anti to go with them so far   "That was it. my lord,  said Oswald Al- fred, finding more voice under the encour- agement of a look and tone that rather astonished him in Lord Amyott. " You sat light anti turned your wheel as though you were going round an ordinary corner   " Yes, my lord,  replied our hero, as though he had never hesitated for a single unheroic moment; but a sharp twinge of remorse caused him to qualify the boast a little.  You '  . my lord," the lad ex- plained,  1 fell tliev d send me ihe way of the l.i-t. hauffeur and now we know w hat that was but I d a pretty good idea then, and 1 preferred my own way.  Lord Amyott hobbled between his two sticks into the balcony, and bent his brow over the darkling pines; jxrhaps he would have liked a little less complacency in the performer of the particular feat under dis- cussion; anti he thought that on the whole he would not put his skilled opinion of it into so many words. "There s only one other thing I want to ask," said he, returning as far as the Frenih windows.  We re a pretty fair of cripples, but I'm assured that it s only a matter of lime in both cases, and I ve liooked my own passage for Septeml er. I ve got a new car on order to go out in the same boat. Would you like to come out with me to take the wheel " And Oswald Alfred lay transfigured by a smile which, it is to l e hoped, was not Lord Amyott s only reward for being brav- er than he knew. AN APRIL MASQUE By Dorothy Canfield 11.1 i- s T k a i l    x   r. v K I. I  L i  m i vs   it L't n IT was spring in Versailles, one of those golden April days when the last of the violets are still in bloom and the tirsi lilacs are opening, when the old pleasure- ground of the Bourbons   the loveliest spot in all the lovely world There, in that corner of the park which i  still called "The Gar- den of the King," sat Jules Dorival, his spirit thrilling with ecstasy. Bet an - he was a painter, not a historian, he thought not at all of the   oliiicaI upheavals that had thrown open to the   oorest citizens of the republic the favorite promenade of Louis the Magnificent: but because he was a painter the beauty of the visible world tilled him with a joy so piercing that it was al most unbearable, lie dosed his eyes, and being of Latin blood, wept for joy at the revelation of the soul of the lovely old gar- den. shown to him in a shimmering vision of colors, odors, lines, such as, he thought passionately, only angels - nay. archangels   deserved to see lie ogtened his eyes again, and noticed that he was no longer alone. Some one had come up and now sat on the other end of his stone l en  h It was neither an angel nor an archangel, but a small old man, dressed poorly in black, very forlorn, very drooping, a doleful little blot on the splen- dor of the day. He cast a deprecating glance at the superb young swell from 1 aris. and edged around shyly to conceal the piverty-strii ken noon day meal which he took out of a paper bag. Jules Dorival, the success of that year's Salon, with the ample proceeds of a prosperous sale still in his   oiket. had just lunched on squab smothered in mushrooms, asparagus, and hot house grapes, all washed down with Sjiarkling Saumur. He looked with a pity that was almost horror at the lump of bread on which the old man was now munching, and felt instinctively for his   'Urse. Even as his fingers touched it something alwiut the fineness of the other s thin old profile moved him to caution before he offered alms. He moved along the bonih and began a casually conversational inves- tigation   A line day. Monsieur." The old man admitted the truth of this statement in a small, sad voice.

"My profes- sion is such that 1 ant,   erha  s, more moved than another might he by the great U-auty of the park at thi  season." "Vour profession is  " asked the old man in black. "I am an artist." The young man might have l een announcing that lie was a reigning sovereign. His statement had a singular effect on the cheerless little tigure at the other end of the bench. The old man sat up straight, brushed the crumbs from his tie, pulled down his threadbare waistcoat, and offered his hand with a grand gesture. "Sir. we are comrades-at-arms 1 too am an artist." 11 It was three o'clock before they rose from the bench. " I have not had in years so long a break in a working-dav," averred the old gentleman, "nor so agreeable a one as our talk together has made.  Jules did not answer, but allowed the other to take hi- arm and lead him along to the Grand Canal, and then up the stone steps toward the chateau.   It is indeed a rare privilege to introduce such a painting to - uch an artist," the old man went on, "and you must not reproaih yourself that you have overlooked it here- tofore in your inspection of the grand art treasures of Versailles. It U but a small canvas. Its greatness lie-  in its subject; a greatness I have not l egun to exhaust, after my lifetime of study of it.  Jules nodded. He was trying to conccal the tact that he had never in his life been inside the chateau, regarding it, with alt of hL  sophisticated and know ing generation, as a chamber of horror of bad paintings, bought and preserved by political dema- gogues because of the cheap patriotism of their subjects. Not only was he a painter of the last hue of modernity, but he was a Socialist of the latest hue of International- ism : ami he found immensely diverting the fate which thus dragged him forward to admire all that was anathema to him. " Pardon me,  said his old companion. "I I " he hesitated, looking down at his feet.

He traversed it in an absolute silence, looking faithfully at each of the huge canvases. He went into the first of the small rooms. He went into the second. He went into the third, and passing rapidly to the window- leaned his forehead against the pane. "If I had not seen the first small room. 1 would have upheld again t any man. with the weapons of his choice, that nothing could be more dreadful than the long gallery.

Even as he spoke, an elderly priest came into the room and began a leisurely inspec- tion of the pictures. Jules retired to the window and wailed. After a time he was obliged to step forward to the rescue of the copyist, who was so overcome with pride and pleasure that he could not articulate.   I hap  en to know, my father,  said Jules courteously, "that M. the copyist is to de- liver several other examples of his line work this evening at the Soleil d'   r.

When hr could - K ak, the copyist burst out,  And they say the clergy is not loyal  Did you hear did you hoir what he-   I heard,  said Jules. He was tying a fourth knot in his string. The copyist took up his brushes with a dazed air and stood staring lief ore him. A big partv hi Cook's tourists trampled in and out of the room under the guidance of a vociferously explanatory guide, and he did not stir. A group of school-giris from the Lvcee down the avenue came through de- murely without arousing him. The litile roi im was quite silent again, when he turned and came uncertainly toward Jules.  M. Dorival did 1 dream it I have dreamed such things so many, many times if this should turn out a dream, 1   he looked piteously at the other. Jules forced his voice to a cheerful mat- ter-of fact tone as he confirmed the good news, and added:  I think 1 will sit here in the window recess and make a sketch. The glimpse one gets of the Grand Canal is charming.  He felt that to look at the old man s face was an intrusion. He turned his back to the room, the pict- ures, and the sight seers who came and went. Across his knee lay the knotted string. After a time, hearing a man s voice in the next room, and a woman s answering it. he made two more knots and smiled. A magnificent old couple came in together. Jules sketched industriously during the conversation which followed. After they had gone out he ran over and slapped his old friend on the shoulder.  Doyou know who that was  The great M.-1  he pronounced the name with reverence.  What would I not give for such praise from him   There was a rustle of silk, and all April seemed breathed about the room in the odor of lilacs. Jules, at his window, heard a silver voice exclaim over the beauty of the symbolical figure of La Republique  and he made another knot. The silence which followed this was broken by no word from the copyist, and the young man did not dare lo   x k around. Another loud-footed tourist party went through. After tlu-m came feminine voices talking sharp-pointed Russian. When they suddenly began to use French, Jules added three to his knots. There was still no comment from the copyist.  t noon the young man rose, stretchcd liinwlf, and asked if the other supposed he could leave his sketching materials with one of the i ustodians until he returned from lunch. The old man was sitting on his high stool, his face in his hands. When lu- looked up, Jules saw that he had l een weeping.  You will pardon me. M.

He was breathless.  Thai is an honor a privilege that I never dreamed " He put on his hat wildly askew. "1 need air   he cried and disappeared. As Jules was returning from his lunch, an automobile passed him at full speed. It flashed by in a whirlwind of smoke and dust, but he caught the wave of a tiny hand and a dashing salutation from a pair of black eyes. He found the copyist work- ing like mad, though at the up iearance of the young man he llung himself from his stool and across the room at him.   I have sold two more " he shouted.  Think  That makes more than hah of what 1 need  Perhaps ii M. le Directeur knew, he might wait a little longer   He clutched at his white hair and looked around him with a distraught air.

He knew no other outlet for his emotion than to paint fa-ter than usual.

Jules accepted gravely, anil added that he happened to know that several oilier of the copyist s pair -ns were dining that night at the Soleil d    r. and that they would doubtless consider it a privilege, as he did. to join in honoring so faithful a servant of their glorious country. With that he tucked the old man s arm into his and bowed profoundly. The Gascon bowed proioundlv, the eight burst into cheers, escaped the wrath of the custodians by prompt flight out into the park, and laugh- ing, singing, prancing, swept down to the Soleil d    r. V Thk dinner was a memory a memory which the copyist declared fervently wa- beyond anything which Paradise might have to ojfer him. He still -at under the awning of the Soleil d'Or. at one end of tin- long table, with the eighteen dismantled and deserted places. A wreath of ivy had slipped to the back of his head and framed his tired old face, set in a white lieatitude which was almost stupor. Jules, at the other end, silently reviewed the evening, his black eyes sparkling with reminiscent hilarity. It hail been Iteyond anything he had hoped.

Jules grinned widely at the recollection, lie went around the table and look the old man's purse out of his pocket to count the money in it. There were fifteen hundred francs. He 'lipped it hack again with a nod of appreciation.  'They arc good souls, all of them," he said aloud, and stood looking down in a sudden musing reverie. A gust of warm air brought to his keen young senses the pungent aroma of awakening life, lie stcp  ed from under the awning, out of the glare of the lights, and found himself in the midst of that silent miracle, a night in spring. Above tin- tracery of the trees, misty and veiled with o  ening leaf-buds, the innu- merable stars gazed down u their reflec- tion in the quiet water. There was not a ' mnd, but he was breathed iqwm by a thousand faint odors and wandering breezes that shook him like little twanging touches on hi  heart-strings. At first, with hi  painter's instinct, he matched himself arrogantly against the incredible harmony of tin- night's black upon black. "Thun  Thus " lie thought,  could I reproduce that elicit, this shadow, that lessening of the  lark ' opaque mass.  He flung his challenge to the night with a sweep of his sensitive painter s hand. The iiijjlit answered nothing, holding its breath in a pause so ex  ectanl that the young man heard his heart l cat loudly.

TIClN  II   I I S   II iiu   o V   H HR Hudson s Bay Com- pany's factor stood on the pier at Bear Island, and looked al  lie string- picce. He was experi- enced in his business and knew his people, which was the reason that he did not look directly at the old Indian, who seemed part of the birch canoe in which he was sitting, nor ask him a direct question.  Goin  north -'" queried the faitor.  Ah-hah." Jacques Leiebvre sat with his paddle resting across hi' knees while his slight craft bobl ed about on the waves.  Goin  far   continued the factor. "Gowganda way,  responded Jacques. For an appreciable interval both of them smoked and looked at the stringpiece.   They re gettin  a lot of silver up there,  volunteered the factor uninterestedly.   Gue.'S so,  answered Jacques. "I go fin  out.    Goin' to get rich, are you   asked the factor s Cockney clerk. Jacques  aid no attention to this remark, but placed his pipe carefully on the bulge of the pack that lay in front of him in the boat, nodded his head the least bit in the world, and dipped his paddle. He seemed only to carets the water, but the little birch shot forward as it there was life in it.  Look at him,  commented the faitor.  Sixty-five ii he's a day, and he'll keep that rate up till he gets to Gowganda." Hi  age was what worried Jacques. He had become conscious of it in the last year or two, had jwrccivcd an occasional stiff- ness in his joints, an infinitesimal loss ot catlike litheness, a certain pronene" to fa- tigue. Men were growing ri  h over night in that mining district, and with the coming of wealth to the country the jtossibilily of a destitute old age had become a spectre to him. 'Fen years more on the trail cer- tainly no longer than that and the spertre would become a reality. After that, for perhaps ten years more, he would sit in a Vol. XLVI1I. 22 sunny spot in the Company's reservation, and make baskets and m     casins women's work. Then, if he were unfortunate enough to live so long, a few years of helplessness, during which the Company and the little Roman Catholic mission would share the care of him. The prospect was scarcely more pleasing to him than the chance of starv ation. Vet all around him were rotk  heavy with silver and cobalt men even talked of gold and he did not know ore from sandstone. Possibly he had passed a rich de x sit a thousand times in his wan- derings, and had  iegged down his tent with stones worth a small fortune. The thought lud taken jiossession of him, occupied his mind to the exclusion of everything else, and came over him with fresh force when- ever he found a day too long or a load too heavy. Finally, it had forced him out of hi-, lifelong habits; this winter he would neither trap nor hunt, but would go to Gowganda and work in the mines. In the spring, when the ice had gone out and ca- noe travel was once more practicable, he would leave, and would find what he would find. If the factor had not been inquis- itive Jacques would have drifted into the bush as silently as a moose. He was not secretive; that was merely the way of his race. Fight days of silent, steady travel lav between him and Gowganda; travel such as would have brought an unseasoned white man. however young, to the verge of exhaustion, and would have taxed severely any white man, however seasoned. It did not trouble Jacques in the least. By  ad- dle and portage he covered al  ut thirty miles a day between sunrise  and sunset, ami would have smiled in mockery if any greenhorn had suggested that he was going fast.   n a little lake al out sixty miles from Gowganda his eyes caught the glim- mer of a squared stump on the shore, the usual mark of a claim. He swung his canoe toward it and went to pass the time of day with the prospectors. He followed 209 210 Mis Quest, and the End of It the trail uj  the hill until he came ujxm them at work; they, glad enough Jo see anybody, laid down their picks.  'Bo  jou," said Jacques.  Howdy," replied the prosjiectors. Jacques finished shaving tobacco from his plug, tilled his pipe, anil held his thumb over the bowl.  Silver   he asked.   Yes lots of it," replied the younger of the prosjiectors,  and cobalt.     Ah hah.  Jacques lit his pipe and squatted on his heels. This, when done at all in civiliza- tion, is stirtly done; Jacques came down easily, with a little springy rebound, as if he had sat gently u  on a wire mattress. The prospectors, eager to talk and new to the woods, asked him direct questions.  Where did you hail from    Temagami.    join  far    Gowganda.   "I-ookin  for work, are you    Ah hah.  During this cross-examination Jacques remained motionless, his pipe in the hoi- low of hi- palm to keep the wind from smoking his tobacco, one hand hanging loose between hi  knees. with a fragment of stone in it. and his eyes fixed on his in- terlocutors.  They want men up there.    I hear so.      t o you know much about mining   The younger of the two was growing a little impatient with the Indian's taciturnity.

That s coball bloom  Means silver, eh   said Jacques.  Pretty often. There's a little copper in il. and plenty of iron pyrites.  He knm ked out hi  pipe.   Well, we've got to lie working.  Jacques rose as lightly as he had squat- ted.  Goo -bv,   he said, and moved off down the trail. They did want men at Gowganda, and all winter long he worked in the drifts, si- lent and unjierturbed, but using all the   owcr of observation that the woods had bred in him, and storing away what knowl- edge he acquired with the accurate visual memory of the illiterate. Six times he c hanged jobs, and the workings in ever ' mine of the six were different, adapted to the lie of the land and the character of the ore. Now and then Jacques asked ques- tions of his fellow laborers, but, for the most part, he had no need lo do so. for engineers came through almost every day, and he heard them talk of minerals as they passed him or paused beside him and took speci- mens of the ore. There was also McFar- lanc, superintendent of one of ihe mines, a man wonted lo the forest and the ways of the forest, who came now and then to Jacques's tent and spent an evening with him. From him Jacques learned much, for Mi Farlanc was not long in discovering the Indian s object, and was not unwilling to help him in ihe attainment of it. Jacques cared nothing for the names that bristled from the body of McFarlane s speech  diabase, diorite. quartz, syenite for these meant nothing to him; but he learned the difference l etween rock that l x ks as if it held silver, and rock that really does hold it. Sometimes prospective buyers came through the mines, but these were not fre- quent in that iron winter. One of them brought his wife. "Who is that   she said, as Jacques passed her in the du k of the tunnel. "An Indian, Mrs. Walton,  answered Mi Farlanc, who was showing her about.  The only one in ihe mines." She  Kiused and looked after Jacques. February passed and ihe March winds hurried through the sadly depleted forest about Gowganda. Heavy, gray clouds crept over the chill blue of the winter sky; the thermometer ro e, one day, till the snow on the log roofs came sliding down iu avalanches, and fell the next till the brealli froze in the noMrils. April came, and with it a ripple of melting snow that continued night and day. Toward the middle of this month Jacques took his His Quest, anti the KikI of It 211 canoe out of the hark shelter that he had built tor it near his tent, anti worked all day over it with a tlat stick and a  n t of boiling pitch.

For perhaps half an hour Jacques moved quietly about. The cabinet took the bet tor part of his attcniioa; he picked up the specimens one by one, examined them care- fully, and replaced them exactly in their places. McFarlane, absorbed in his work, ixreame presently aware that Jacques was standing beside him, w ith a picce of pccu liar mineral in his hand. "You've picked the best ot the lot,  he said, smiling.    It don t belong Gowganda, ch  " asked Jacqucs. " No." McFarlane took the stone in his hand; the light caught its surfaces at a new angle, and brought out fresh hues from the incrustations. He looked at it half angri- ly, twisting it about in the sunlight.    No. That's a Nevada bit. I'd l e a rich man if 1 owned that mine. It's partly cobalt bloom, but there are crystals of all sorts in it also." He handed it back to Jacques who looked al it inlendy before he put it Lack  When do you leave Gowganda, Jacqucs " asked McFarlane. '  In two days.    Hunting, or guiding, or what    Prospectin .    Look in before you go, and say good- by"  Ah-hah." And Jacques was gone. That night the spring quickened the air more imjteratively than ever. The trees rustled a new call; the sweet, damp odor of thawing came up from the ground; the river gave out once again that indcscrib- able smell oi fresh water, which resembles to some degree the taste of tlat AjMillinaris, yet is pleasant, and to some the most allur- ing smell in all the world. As it grew dark, Jacqucs threw a couplc of logs on his cook- ing lire and sat beside it. It was Saturday night; some men on the way to the dance- hall about ten o'clock saw him there, and greeted him as they passed; if he heard them he gave no sign. I akc by lake, range by range, valley by valley, he was going in his mind over the trails of fifty years. Some of them he had lrap  ed over many winters in succession, to some he had guided campers in the search for game, some of them he had visited but once in the Vol. XLVJ1I 23 half century, One and all, he knew them as a scholar knows his library shelves, and ihe trail.-, of his boyhood were only a little less distinct than the journeys of last year, Unhesitatingly lie could have travelled them all again nameless lakes and name- less streams but ihe one thing for which he was now grasping kept eluding him, ;:nd was always jusl l cyond his reach in some col webbed recess of his brain. He knew that he had seen rock such as Mc- Farlane had shown him; somewhere, some- time, long ago, he had seen it, and the pict- ure that hovered mistily as the goal of his search was the presentment of a quiet lake, red-gold under the sunset. Patiently, for half the night, he tried to loeate it, elim- inating now this, now that almost un- trodden path, pondering and rejecting a hundred mirages that more or less closely resembled it. The next day he laid in his supplies ami said good-bye to McFarlane; the day after, al dawn, he left Gowganda. He went as a man docs who knows whither he is going. His route took him in a north westerly direction; after the first few days he saw no one. It is unlikely in the extreme that he completely sensed the content of those sixteen days of lonsly travel, but the content was there, keen as Ihe wind-blown lands that were a part of him, and the keener for his winter in tin  bare and squalid mining town. It was a home coming; he had never before been in a town for so long a jteriod. On the six- teenth day he pitched his tent on a little lake, in the bight of a rocky point that had a color of its own l eside the color that the sun .cl gave it. The dawn of the next day seemed to tarry a  out it ; broad day came, and the deep shades still lingered in the stone. With his after-breakfast pipe still in his mouth, Jacqucs went after firewood, for it was in his mind that this would be a long camp. Two hours later he sat u H n the woodpile beside his tent, and kicked the sizable stone with which he had anchored one of the rojtes ll moved under his foot, and a piece drop  cd from the corner of it, leaving a clean surface of cleavage. Jacques did not bend to examine it more closely. For the remainder of the day he wandered alx ut upon the  ioint, here and there knocking off a piece of the roc k with ihe back of hia axe, and contemplating it. His Quest, and the End of It McFarlane had presented him with a proj- ector's pick as a parting gift, hut old habit was strong in him and he held by the axe. The find was rich, almost l eyond l elicf. in three placcs a broad, tarnished, metallic band  'lashed across the face of the rock, and showed bright under the attri- tion of the axchcad. Once before, at Co- ball, had Janjucs seen the like; it was the  ighi of the town, and men showed one the dents that hobnails had made in it. Toward evening a slight interruption of the shadow on the opposite shore, half a mile or so away, caught Jacques's eye. He launched his canoe and paddled across the lake as silently as a shark goes through the sea When the deer lifted its head, Jacques sat motionless; when the nose dropped av;ain into the grasses, he drifted on again. In the end, one shut killed it That night a cow-moose tailed for an hour in the same marsh. In the morning, a little way from his tent, he found bear tracks, and there were signs of marten and lisher on the banks of the little stream. Never before had his manifold inheritances so stirred in this man. It had needed ab- sence to bring him so completely into har- mony with hi- background; in these days all the changes that had been wrought in him by his tangent contacts with civiliza- tion fell away from him. Time and again he laid his axe gently down, and sat mo lion I ess upon the summit of the incredibly rii h outcrop, his eyes far seeing, his ear at- tuned to every whisjK-r of sound from the woods behind All his senses, made dull  n the chill damp of the mines, grew sharp again; smells in particular meant to him almost as mui li as they do to a dog. The sun and the air were tightening his slack perceptions and putting them in tunc again. Nevertheless and for several days he went about upon the rock, making cer- tain of the richness of it, and taking speci- mens to show lo possible purchasers. From day to day he postponed his de- parture, and every day he worked less long u K n his claim. He took to spending long hours in the bush, marking down haunts of otter, beaver, and marten; occasionally he came close to one of the animals, for they had seldom, if ever, seen 3 man and were unafraid. He could get fresh meat almost without moving from his tent door; the place was as Clod meant certain places to be till the Day of Judgment. So, as June grew big with the young year, the forest claimed his allegiance as it had never done before. Three weeks after the day of his arrival he cachrd all save two of his specimens, made his pack, and loaded his canoe. Where the stream delxmched into the lake he turned ami looked back, allowing his canoe to drift broadside before the light breeze. It was a still paradise that he looked u  on, free from any trace of man, for even the place of his own late camp was invisible at this distance, so small was the scar it had lrft on the face of the wilderness. The many-colored rock dominated the scene, and in the marsh two moose were feeding.   Sometam.    said Jacques, sj eaking for the first time in twenty-four days,  some- tam  I come back, mcbbe.   He  lip K-d his paddle, and the birch slipj ed through the water on the long re- turn journey to Temagami. REST II A R R O W A COMEDY OF RESOLCTIOX BY MAURICE HE W L E T T ILLUSTRATION BV FRANK.

Ingram shrugged at the inevitable. " All roads lead to Rome."  Most roads lead to Lady Maria," Morosine said to Sanchia, who replied from her heart, "I m very glad that mine did." Moved either by loyalty to his friendship, or touched by his recent words, she then brought him bodily into play. " Mr. Xevile Ingram; Prince Morosine.  The two men inclined; Morosine lifted his hat. Ingram touched his brim. Ingram, whom Morosine judged a  a hard worker just now, supported his part with great gallantry. If he was naked to all these people who knew him, he appeared quite unashamed. Morosine, watching him carefully, believed that he had devoted a night s vigil to getting word-perfect. He described Khartoum with vivacity the English drill-sergeant reigning over mud- heaps, tlies, and prowling dogs, getting up cricket-matches for the edification of con- temptuous blacks. " They judge us, those fellows, you know. They arc measuring us with their glazed eyes. The cud they chew has gall in it I don't suppose any- thing offends them more deeply than our idiotic games. Is there a more frivolous race in the world than ours " Lady Maria suggested that the B iors might ask that question; Morosine that the Germans might answer it. Sanchia. standing l etween these two, faced by Ingram, kept silent. She was conscious of being closely under observation. Morosine did not once lose  sight of her. Whatever he said was addressed to her. Once, when she looked at him, she saw the gleam of knowledge in his eyes. He and Ingram never spoke to each other directly; indi- rectly Morosine capped whatever Ingram 2'S 210 Rest Harrow said. It was these two who maintained the talk, through her sensitive frame. Mclusinc and her husband exchanged glances  she in oliedience to his tidgety heel. He had dug a Imle in the gravel deep enough to l ury a kitten. Her curtsey it was almost that to Lady Maria was very pretty. She drew in her suffering sister, almost embraced her. " Dearest, dear- est   she whispered. Sam lii.i, who was very pale, made no answer, and hardly returned the salute.   Insufferable beggar,  was Gerald Scales's outburst.  ' I could have shot him at sight. But you women will go through with it. I suppose.      l . Gerald," faltered Melusine,   it's dreadful but what can she do "   Tun my soul. I'd take Morosov the Polish party what's-his-namc first. I would indeed on the whole." There was nothing to say. Melusine knew that could not be. Lady Maria, however, who never made a fuss over spilt milk, lost no time iti ladling up what might be possible. She asked Ingram to luncheon, and was ac- cepted with a cheerful  Thanks, must happy." It may have lieen malice which turned her to Morosine with the question,  And you  Will you join us " Morosine promptly excused himself. He had guests, and must consider them. He took ceremonious leave.   You remember, I hope, that 1 am to see you on Thursday, Lady Maria. And Miss Penival   He looked at Sanchia, who did not turn him her eyes.

Thursday.  he repeated, and left her with her fate. Lady Maria, at luncheon, made what she i ailed the Ik-si of a bail business. She treated Ingram to a brisk curiosity. "So you re a wanderer, I hear- like the Gay Cavalier of my childhood. Your mother may have heard the song. Mine sang it. I believe that that kind of thing was con- sidered heroic in her day; in ours heroism is more difficult, and much more dull. You might try heroism, Mr. Ingram.    I might, no doubt,  Ingram said.  Hitherto, I've preferred to travel. But I'm home for good now, so far as I can it sec.  We all hope so,  said Lady Maria.  But that remains to be seen.  "Of course it does,  said Ingram bland- ly, and turned to Sanchia.  I thought your mother looking very well. Your father wasn't there. I saw Philippa, by the way; but I suppose she didn't remember me. That was her husband with her, I take it. Stiff old boy." So he went on, letting by- gones l e bygones. It was after luncheon that her ordeal came. Lady Maria having departed for her siesta, he came instantly to Sanchia with his hand out for her.  Sancie, I couldn't talk before all those people. You must forgive me. my dear. You are too good a sort you must forgive me.  He had to wait; but slowly she lifted her hand, and let him take it.   I have forgiven you,  she said. He stroked her arm.  That s nice of you that's like you. I know that 1 behaved like a brute. 1 was awfully cut up about it afterwards but, as you know, I had great provocation.    Not from me, I think.  Her eyes were upon him now.  No, no,  lie admitted,  certainly not from you; but well,   crhaps I may say that 1 had some ground for thinking that you possibly No, I don t think I ought to say that. At any rate, I thought then that I had. As for that young friend of yours but he s nothing. It's you I want to make my peace with.   It's not difficult,  she said.   I tell you that I don t bear any malice. I bore none at the time. 1 wanted to go.  He let her hand slide from his. and plunged bis own into his pockets.  I know you did; I felt it at the time. That hurt me a good bit. I had come to rely upon you so much oh, fur every mortal thing. I expect the whole place has gone to the devil now. You had your hand on the tiller, by Jove  You kept a straight course  You see, I'd got into the way of Rest Harrow 217 thinking we were married, don't you know, and all that-    I think you had, indeed,  she said. He saw her wry smile. "I know what you mean by that. You mean, if that s marriage many thanks  Well, my dear, all 1 can say is, you were absolutely wrong. It was not marriage it never had been, and you know it couldn t have been. But If it had been. Sarnie, you d have been as right as rain. You know you would.

Xo  But it was just because our relationship was so infernally irregular that you felt those separations took them, if I may say it, so hard. Depend upon it, that was it." Her lip curled back, though she said nothing. She wondered if he had always been quite so fatuous as this, quite so sub- limely unhumorous. If he had, what under heaven had she been about  That she could have believed this smug cockscomb to have loved her to have been capable of anything but hunger and thirst for her  incredible  It made her out precisely as fatuous as he. And yet she said nothing. With the likes of him nothing seemed worth doing except to forget him. And she was to marry him, to live in his house, to see him daily ah, and more than that; and yet she said nothing of what her curled-back lip expressed. She was in the presence of her Fate, and, as ever, was dumb before it. To make him shrivel under scom, to wind her tongue about him like a whip till he writhed; to play the honest woman and tell him quietly that she did not love and had nothing more to say to him; or to ask him urgently for release  she did none of these things: none of them entered her head. She had never shirked the apportioning of the Weaving Women. Destiny was unquestionable. She felt that she abhorred Ingram. What she was to suffer from him she knew but too well. And yet she knew also that she was going to marry him. to be neglected by him, put to scom, betrayed. All these things she would undergo, becausc they could not be avoided, She was bound as well as gagged. Her destiny was before her, as her   harac- ter was within. The one had licgotten the other. She had sowed, and now she was to reap. Her stony mind contemplated the harvest, and saw that it was just. Therefore she said nothing, but stood with her foot on the fender, shading her face from the lire with her thin hand. In this attitude, though able lo see sideways what was coming upon her, she stood nerveless to his approach.   Sarnie, my own Sancie,  he said, and put his arm about her, and drew her l odily to his side. She stiffened, but allowed it. "Dearest girl, tell me that you forgive me -tell me that. I am wretched without you 1 can't go on like this. It s not good for me: my health suffers. Darling Sati- ric. forgive poor old Xcvile. He was once your boy you loved him so much. For the sake of old times, Sarnie, my clear   She could only say,   I have forgiven you you know that. I have told you so.  He prosed her closcly to him, feeling his urgent need to make the most of what she had to give him. Her apathy struck him mortally chill; he w  ocd her the more desperately. Holding her to his hearx an inanimate burden he kissed her lax lips, her eye- lids, her hair; called her by names whose use she had long forgotten, whose reviv- al caused her pain like nausea. If he could have known it. this was the last way to win her. It was like pressing upon a queasy invalid the sweets which had made him sick. But he, remembering their ancient potency, seeing himself the tri- umphant wielder of charms, felt secure in them still; therefore she was his darling, his hardy little lover, his tjueen of Love, his saucy Sancie, his lass. On tire himself by his own blowing, at last he fell upon his knees and clasped hers '"Dearest, most lrcauiiful, my own, I love you more than ever. Comfort me, be my salvation I pray that 1 may be worth your while. Many me, Sarnie, and save my soul alive.  Honestly, for the moment, he believed himself irresistible, and so far succeeded with her that her disgust hid itself in a cloud of pity. She felt pity for a man abject at her feet, and could speak more kindly to him. 2 IS Rest Harrow But she could not bring herself to touch him. Looking down at him there, her eyes were softer, and her lips took a gentler curve.   You mustn t l c down there,  she said.   I don't like to sec you there and can t talk to you till you get up. Let s sit down and talk- if you will.  He rose obediently and stood with heaving chcst, while she drew a chair to the fire and seated herself. Then lie took to the hearth-rug, and possessed himself of her hand.

" Hut doyou store these things up against me  That s noi too generous, is it   "I don't store anything," she assured him;  but it wouldn't be honest of me to pretend I am what 1 was once. 1 was a child then, and now I m a woman.

" 1 never ceased to love you,  he vowed. " You must be aware how much 1 depended upon you. You were always with me.  she could have laughed at him. "I don t pretend to the same state of mind. During tln -e absences of yours I learned to be happy alone and I was happy, too.   This seemed horrible to him. " I could not have believed it of you." he said aghast.   You must have   hanged indeed.  I have   hanged," she owned. He si irted to l-is knees and   la sped her. " Beloved, 1 can change you again 1 am the man who had your heart. 1 must do it it   my rijrht as well as my duty. Trust me again, my own; give me your dear hand again and you shall see. If you are changed for the worse, I am changed for the better. You have redeemed me  What is it they say in the Bible  By your stripes 1 am healed. Yes, yes that's precisely it. Kiss me. my own girl; kiss me." His eyes implored: she stooped her sad head that he might kiss her. He strained upward and held her until she broke away with a sob.  Oh, leave me, leave me for a little while,  she prayed him brokenly. "1 can t talk any more now; 1 assure you I can't." He lagged her pardon for his vehemence. "I'm pretty bad myself, you know. This kind of thing plays the deuce with a man s heart.  She could thank him with a woman s for this naive assurance. " 1 don't doubt you for a moment,  she said.   You have been rather eloquent.   Eloquent, my dear   He raised his eyebrows.  You might spare me con- gratulations u M n my eloquence. 1 don t deserve very much,   crhaps though God knows I tried to make you comfortable; but perhaps 1 deserve credit for sincerity.  She was not to be drawn that way.   I don t doubt your sincerity in the least,  she said. " But I wish you to allow for mine. I am changed, and have told you so.    1 can see that you are.

She looked at him standing liefore her, his arms folded; she showed him a face too dreary to be moved by sarcasm. " You may congratulate yourself on lots of things.

He held out his hand and received hers  which he kissed. Then he turned and left her alone.  I should swallow him, if I were you," was Lady Maria s spoken reflection upon what her young friend was able to tell her.  I should swallow him like a pill. You won t taste him much, and he ll do you worlds of g wxl. The world  I m not talking of the world. I never do. He ll put you right with yourself. That s much more to the point.

Next to being a man s mistress there s no surer ground for you than that, with respectability added, mind you. Xo mean addition. Take my advice, my dear, and you won t regret it." But Sanchia knew at the bottom of her heart that Ingram was not in love with her. He wanted her restored to his collection. IX On the Monday morning, after a night of broken sleep, she received a letter from her mother.   My dear child," Mrs. Pereival wrote,  I met Nevile Ingram, ijuile unexpectedly, on Saturday evening. Yesterday he called here, after he had seen you in the house where you choose to remain. Our inter- view was naturally distressing, and I should be glad t i feel sure that you could spare me a third. I need not remind you of the first.  But I feel hound to own, from what I could learn from him of hi  discussion  as I must call it  with you, that 1 am most uneasy. If 1 were to say unhappy, tho  it would be less than the truth, you might accuse me of exaggeration. That I could not bear. Therefore, let uneasy be the word. Is it possible, 1 xsk myself, that my youngest child -my latest-born can find it in her heart to frv wrthcalreadyagonizcd heart of her mother  1 put the question to you, Sanchia, for I am incapable myself of finding the answer. I blush to write it- but such is the terrible fact. I can only l cg you to put me out of susjtense as gently as may be. I am growing old. There are limits to w hat a gray-haired mother's heat I can bear.  Mr. Ingram s proposals toward a set- tlement of the untold ruin he has wrought in a once smiling and contented household, were il must say  liberal. That they were all that they should be, I must not declare  for how could that ever lie  He put him- self, however, and his extremely handsome fortune unreservedly in my hands and those of your father, who was not present at our interview.

Such an one could guide him into Green Pastures  and such an one only. Secure in the grati- tude of his inferiors, the respect of his peers, reconciled to the Altar, and his God: one sees before Nevile the upright, prosperous, honored career of an Knglish Gentleman. There is no higher, 1 believe. But it is clear to all of those who truly love you, my child, that you only can ensure him these advantages. He is sincerely penitent now  of that I am sure. Who can tell, how- 220 Rest Harrow ever, what relapse there may be unless he is taken in hand   You have been his curse, but may be his Blessing.

Ncvile assures me that his cousin, the Bishop, would j erform the rile. This would Ik  a great thing.    ne must think of N. s position in the county.  "Venus, wounded in the side ...  is the opening line of an old poem of Sen- house s, one of those  Greek Idylls  with which he made his bow to the world old placid stories illuminated by modern fervid fancy; nursciy-rhyme versions, we may call them, of the myths.   Venus, wounded in the Side.  recounts how the Dame, strut k by a shaft of her son's, ran moaning from one ally to another seeking Pitv, the only balm that could assuage her wound. To the new lover, to the old, to the fresh- wedded, to the long-mated: from one to the other she ran hand clapped to the throb- bing heart. None could help her. "Pity  What s that    cried the first.   I triumph: rejoice with me. Is she not like the sun in a valley   The second cursed her for a pr K uress. The bride stirred in her sleep, and whispered,   Kiss me again, Beloved." As for the fourth, he said,   All mv Pity was for myself. It is gone; now I am frost- bound.  Venus wept: Adonis healed the wound. Sanchia, reading Imig afterwards, saw in it a parallel to her case, when she, stricken deep, ran about London ways for a south- ing lotion. She saw herself trapped; felt tin- steel bite to the bone. Tears might have helped her, but she had none: pray she could not, nor  rave mercy. It was not Ingram who held her raged, but Desti- ny; and there's no war with hint. She thought of Vicky, of Melusine. Their t.isses would have l een sweet, but sheknew w t.it they would say.

" No, no, my darling that s over, thank God. You have forgiven me, I know my great-hearted Sancie. Now, if you feel  - ;, -  riger. tell me all your troubles.  She murmured what follows.   He came to see me. Ncvile came."   I know, my love. Your mother told me.  "She wrote to me. Rather a dreadful letter. She s on his side she talks about his position in the county.    I dare say, I dare say. But you know, your mother thinks a great deal of that kind of thing. She say's we owe a deal to our station, you know. There s something in it, my dear. I m bound to say that,  Rest Harrow 221    pa, he wants me again. Me thinks he docs."  Oh, my dear, there s no doubt about that nunc at all.

What am I to do, papa   The poor gentleman looked rather blank.  Do, my dear  Do   He puzzled  then, as the light broke on hint, could not help showing his dismay.   Why, you don't mean to say Oh, my child, is that what you mean  " She clung to him convulsively, buried her face. "God help us all " His thought, his pity, his love, whirled him hither and thither. He shivered in the blast. " 'Pon my soul. 1 don't know how we shall break it to your mother. 1 don't indeed." He stared miserably, then caught her to him.   Jt breaks my heart to see you like this  my child; it cuts me to the heart. Sancie, what are we to do   She sat up, and brushed her dryeyes with her handkerchief.   I know. There's noth- ing to do. It s my fate.  This was rather shocking to old Mr. Percival, who shared the common opinion of matrimony, that it should be marked bv champagne at lunchcons. It was a signal for re juicing therefore you must rejoice. White stood fur a wedding all the world over, black for a funeral. To go scowling to church, or tearless to the cemctcry, was to fail in duty.  We mustn t look at it like that, my darling. I don't think we ought, indeed. Fate, you know  That's a gloomy view of an affair of the sort. I don't pretend to understand you, quite, my love. You see. a year or two ago, you w ould have asked nothing better and now you call it fate. Oh, my dear-" She could not have hoped that he would understand, and yet she felt more like cry- ing than at any time yet.   My heart is cold," she said.  It s dead, I think." He echoed her, whispering, "Not dead, Sancic, not dead, my child. Numbed. He'll warm it asleep, lie'll kiss it awake. He loves you.  She moaned as she shook her head. " No, no.

Don t want any more. To see his darling happy, smiling down on her baby bless me, I m getting foolish.  He blinked his bravest, but had to wipe his glasses. She rewarded him with a kiss, and did not leave till she could leave him at ease. X Sanchia, after many nights' stony vigil, decided that she must fight her leasts by herself. She was going to make her par- ents and sisters happy; she was going through with her bargain; but there was no need to tell them any more about it. In her hard mo  l she told herself that that was the only wear. If she should be wept over she might well recant. When the fatal word was oncc spoken, she would write to her mother that was all that she could do. For the same reason that she dreaded a tender moment she did nut go to church with her griefs. The Gods there were too human the Man of Sorrows, the Mother with the swords in her Inborn. It was Destiny that had her by the heel. As ye sow, ye shall reap. Vaster gods, heart- less, blind, immurlal shapes, liguring the 222 Rest Harrow everlasting hills, were her need. She was going to her fate, because the Fates called her. There's no war with them. There had been one who would have had it all out of her in a trite. But he was re- mote, part of her childhood. She hardly called him to mind at this hour. It was dangerous work to think of him, she knew  and her old fortitude stoi d bv her,which said. Turn your mind resolutely away from that which may inlluence your judgment. Senhouse was not a stoic; he was an epi- curean, she now considered. She wanted something flintier than Senhouse. He might have tried to dissuade her: but her mind was now made up. She intended to marry Nevile. She breakfasted alone, and immediately afterwards went upstairs to write her agree- ment. The thing was to be gone through with, and the sooner the better.   My dear Ncvile," she wrote, " if it can ever be right to marry without love, it must be in my case. 1 don't blame you in the least    r what happened. It was as much my doing as yours and I still think that I was right. And now I think that it is right to fulfil one s bargain as it would have been if I had married you. If I had been married to you. I should not have left you unless you told me to go, and I don t think that I ought to now. If you really wish it, you shall marry me when you please, and I will do my duty by you always. Whatever ar- rangements you make will suit me quite well; but ihe less fuss we have the lietu-r. I am sure that you will think so too. Don't come to see me for a few days, if you don t mind. I want t   think. Yours affection- ately, Sanchia.  ll was not a very gracious letter, it must Ik- owned. So young, anti so untender  One would have said that the man must l e a courageous lover who could take marriage on such terms; but either Ingram was very much in love, or honestly hoped to be loved again. I incline to the opinion of Bill Chevenix, to whom he showed it.   Ncvile, old chap,  he said,  you take her on any terms. You ve no idea how set up you'll feel by everybody saying you've done the square thing. I tell you frankly that she s tin  good for you. Look how she s shaped in Charles Street  As if she'd been bom to it. And never once never once allow ed to anybody that she's been in the wrong. Not to a soul. And neither you nor I believe that she has  nor did olil Dosslmuse, or whatever his name was.  Ingram knew quite well to whom he so airily referred.

"Married, is he   Ingram asked, not thinking of Senhouse in particular.   Who did he marry "  He married a rather pretty woman, a widow, a Mrs. Germain." Ingram looked sharply up.

But Sanchia, her day s work done, went  not to church, but to Bloomsbury. F.n- tering the portals of the museum, she swam to the portico, full of her cares. But smoothly, swiftly she went, with that even, gliding gait peculiar to her kind, which has precisely the effect of a swan breasting the stream. Past the door, she turned to the Rest Harrow 223 left, not glancing at the aligned Ca-sars, scarcely bowing i   Dcmctcr of the remote gaze. In that long gallery where thecary- atid thrusts her bosom that her neck may l e the prouder to the weight, she saw the ob- jects of her present pilgrimage beaten, blind and dumb, immovable as the eternal hilU, the Attic Fates; and before them at gaze, his arms folded over his narrow chest, Morosine the Pole. Whether she had sought him here or not, she did not falter in her advance. Smoothly, swiftly, and silently -he came to him and stood by his side. He turned his head, looked sharply at her p.rle face and sad eyes, then resumed his medita- tion before the Three. Neither of them had a care to sj cak. Presently Morosine said, "I knew that you would be here.  He kept his face towards the mystery, and su did she when she echocd him.  Did you know that  You know me, 1 think.   1 believe that I do. You have come here for strength. You will get it.  Ruefully enough she answered,   1 wish I could believe that." " You have it in you already. These great ladies will call it out. I w ish you had been here, say, the day before yesterday. They might have helped you.    But they did help me,  she said.   They were with me. I remembered what we had talked about before them." He nodded his head.   I had intended that you should. 1 was rightly inspired.   Without them,  she went on, "I don t know what 1 should have done. It seems absurd to say so, but---- " He interrupted.   It s not absurd at all  to you and me. If it s absurd, then art is pastrycook-stutT: sugar and white-of- cgg. The man who fashioned these things had walked with God. Here are his secrets, revealed to you and me." She followed her own thoughts, not his.   I came to-day because I have ma le up my mind. I wanted them to confirm me- to say that I was right. If you weren t here, I should go up to them and whisper to them, as I ve seen women d   to the Madonna abroad. I should tell them everything." He looked at her keenly.   Do it now. I'll leave you.  She smiled faintly. " No, don t leave me. I couldn't do it now. But I meant to when I came in.   You didn t think that I might be here " He watched her.  No. I remember that you said we were to meet on Thursday. And 1 have a great deal to think of. I'm in great trouble." "I know you are,  he said.  I fear to be impertinent; but if I can help you-  She gave him a grateful look. Her trou- ble was very real, and made almost a   liitd of her.  I should value your advice, It would help me to have it even if it couldn't change my intentions.  "Y m shall have it, assuredly," he said.  Shall we find a seat    No, no. 1 would rather st   i where we are. Perhaps they'll hear us." They looked at each other and smiled at a shared sentiment.  Tell me, then,  lie said.  He wants me to marry him," she said hurriedly, "and I think that I must. All my people wish it. and my friend - 1 mean those who have known me for a long time. I don't mind very much about most of them; but one of my sisters Vicky- who was always my   losest friend, expccts it  and it would break my father s heart if I did not do it.

Besides, there is no possibility  there would be papa and Vicky again. That would never satisfy them. And then I feci that it's my punish- ment -if I deserve punishment, as they all imply that I do. At any rate, it's part of my bargain. 1 began this thing, and I must go on with it, at all costs to myself. 1 mustn t think of myself in it at all.

That time I followed it against everybody s opinion; this time I must follow against my own will. Don t you agree with me   Morosine reflected in silence. Then he 224 Rest Harrow said,  Yes, I agree with you. I recom- mend you to follow your determination.  Her eyes looked blankly at him; for the first moment he thought her disappointed, but he corrected his impression in the second.   I m glad you agree with me   she said.   I should have been disappointed if you hadn t.  He smiled.   You arc stronger than you think. You can suffice to yourself. But I hope that I shall never disappoint you.    I have no fear of that,  she said, young again and confident. She thanked the Im- mortal Three with her eyes, and turning to Morosine, a.sked him,  Shall we go   They went together. Passing the Demeter of Cnidos, her swinging hand touched his. He held his breath. Her face, sharply in profile, was as pure and pale as a silver coin. Her breast held her secret. To her own heart she voiced the cry, " Have I done well, dear one  Have I done well  Do you approve me  Do you   It may be that Senhouse heard her in his Wiltshire hills.

He had had a moment of gen rosity, with Sanclria s letter in his hand, ami held in the main to his expressed intentions. When he went to see her, at the end of three rigorous days, he behaved like a gentleman. She entered the room where he awaited her, pale for his embrace: he camc to meet her, put his hand upon her shoulder, and, stooping, kissed her lightly.   My dear," he said,   I'll deserve you yet:  and he really meant it. She was touched, and quite kind to him. lie ex- hibited his version of her surrender.

Bygones arc bygones, then   We make a new start  " She sat staidly under his gaze, not aware at the moment that his steel-blue eyes searched her avidly for a hint of more than he stated. "So far as I am concerned  certainly,  she said.   I shall never unlock any cupboards.   Better to burn the contents, perhaps,  he laughed. " I tell you fairly, I had rather they were cleared out. Now, I ll confess to anything you please to ask me. That s a firm offer.  He would probably have done it, but she told him that she had no questions to put.   Very well, my dear,  he said. " Have it as you will. It s sub- lime of you but it s not love. If you don't want to know it s because you don t care.   No, indeed,  shr sighed, with such con- viction that ho was stung.  Hang it all, Sancie,  he cried, "you can t have known me foreight years without feeling something.  She looked up at him, and he saw that her eyes were full.  Oh. Nevile,  she said, with a quivering lip,  don t let us look back. Indeed, I can't do it now.  He put his arm round he r and, drawing her closer, kissed her fore- head.    My pretty one, we won t. I had much rather look forward. The future is to be my affair if the past was yours." Then he went away, and she saw nothing   f him for two days.   n the second of them he dined with Lady Maria, and met some of the Percivals the father and mother the Sinclairs, and Mr. Tompsctt-King.  Phi- lippa had declined to come.  He behaved with great discretion, and so continued. After a week or ten days of courtship, she could hardly believe that their relations had ever been interrupted. His reliance upon her was absolute, his confidence no less so. He babbled of himself and his concerns in the old vein of mocking soliloquy, careless whether she heard him or not. Now that he had her promise, he scemsd in no hurry for possession. His kisses were fraternal, his embraces confined to a hand on her shoulder, an arm lightly about her waist. She was inordinately thankful to him, and by a queer freak of the mind, poured all her gratitude into Senhouse. She told herself that but for him she would never have brought herself to her duty; but for him, therefore, would never have discovered how little she had to fear. Here was a crown for her  dear obsequious head : shutting her eyes tightly she thought that she could feel hi  fingers putting it cm, smoothing out her hair so that the circlet should fit closely. Night after night she knelt to receive it. It came as a result of prayer. Rest Harrow 225 The marriage announcement,got into the paper by Mrs. Pcrcival, was accepted for what it was worth. It was partly the price of her crown. A few letters from old friends were formally answered. Sanchia had never l een a free writer; nobody but Senhouse had found her letters eloquent he only had been able to feel the throb l eneath the stilt lines. Her handwriting, round and firm, had for him a provocative quality; it stung his imagination, lie used to sing her  divine frugality of utter- ance," and protest that it was all of a piece with the rest of her life. No one, he had told her once, but a sculptor could embody her in art hcrchill perfection, her severity and definite outline. A poet might not dare, for he would have to l e greater than love itself, greater than the love which inspired him, able to put it down below him, and stand remote from it, and regard it as a spcck in the landscape.   Your sober thougSt. and your pride To nur   the passion you hold and hide " he had written of her in his day. That austere concealment of her heart, w hich so impassioned him, chillcd enthusiasm in all others of her acquaintance. So her letters were few, and now she was thankful enough. She herself wrote to nobody, and never sjx ke of her future unless she were com- pelled to answer questions. Once a day, however, she took out a wriung-block, and traced upon it the words.

She found herself trembling in these days she always trembled asshe read these words. That such a power should indeed i e hers and how could she fail to believe it  was inspiration enough to send her to the tire. She read no more, but used to  .it shivering, thrilling through every fibre of her body, with the strength of such splendid praise. For whatever might l e her fate, splendid it was to have been so loved, so seen, and so praised. It was well for Ingram that she read her old love-letters  and extremely unfortunate for the writer of them, who anguished for her now in his desert place. Odd situation  that the love- letters of one man should reconcile her to the arms of another. From Torquay, where she spent the Faster holidays with her father, the two alone and happily together, she wrote two or three times to Ncvile. He was at Wan  less, professedly getting some order into things there, and protesting to her by every word lie sent her upon the need there was of her hand upon affairs. There was noi a word of love used between the un- fortunate pair. All the love-making, in- deed, was i lone by Senhouse, whose master- stroke was called for by ami by. Toward the end of April she was alone in Charles Street, preparing the house for I.ady Maria s return from Rome. Ingram was still at Wanless, grumbling through his duties of magistrate, landlord, and county gentleman. "They seem lo think up here Rest Harrow that a fellow has nothing lo do but  take the chair,   he wrote.  1 can tell you I m pretty sick of it, and fancy that they will In  before long. I'm an awkward customer when I'm bored as I am now, damnably.  She sent him matter-of-fact replies, and wrote principally of the weather. The Pole continued his discreet and temperate wooing after the plan he bad formulated. He strove to interest her per- petually. never left her without having, as lie taught himself to believe, impressed him- self anew upon her imagination.

Unfortunately for him. be misinterpreted what he read. The slap- dash Ingram thought all was well; Chevenix, the more observant, thought there was a bare chance; Morosine alone could sec how herquivering soul was being bruised, and if he thought that she looked to him for balm, he may be ext used. She was drown- ing, she held out her hands.

His mistress she might be, his wife never. As he read her, she would keep the letter of the law since the law required it of her. The rest, lie flat tered himself, might be left to time and him. His present aim was to interest and stimulate her. without alarming. He counted greatly upon some sudden emotional stimulus, whit h would cause her to tall to him; and one  amc, though it had no sui h effect. The opera   f  Tristan and Isolde.  to whi  h she was taken by Lady Maria  where she sat in his box. by his side, ab- sorbed in the mosi pen ing expression of the love-malady that has ever tormented it - way out of a poet s heart had been a real test of his restraint. He had not once met her eyes though hers, craving sym- pathy at any hand, hail sought bis often; he had not once permitted himself to gaze upon her beauty, though it was her beauty, so carven, so purely Greek, which had drawn him to her from the first. While the great music went sobbing and chiding through her frame, like wounded nightin- gales, he bad sat in the dark, with his arms folded, never looking at her fully, nor seek- ing to win a glance from her soul to hisown. That it stirred her to the deeps he knew. He could watt h sideways, listen sideways, both hear and see that she was rapt. Her quick-heaving breast, the whistle of her short breath, the strained line of her head and shoulder all this he marked and stored without a sign. Even when, on go- ing out, he had l cen conscious of her over- charged heart, of her breastful of emotion; even when she hail told him under her breath that she was happier, though he shivered, lie drew away. He had nodded quickly, smiled, blinked his eyes.   I was sure of that,  was all he allowed himself in the way of intimacy. Swift, lire-consumed, intensely sensitive, subtle-minded, this was a man who relished suggestions more than things. He had far rather deal mentally with the lovely image   f Sanchia, as he saw it, than actually with the breathing flesh. To picture her long- ing, straining, trembling to keep her al- ways so, always bolding out her arms, never obtaining what she sought: his bliss lay in that. He knew himself, after much experience of the sorl; he had missed so often by blundering in, that now he dared not risk a wreck. Here at last, he told himself, was perfection: let him look to it that he kept it at its perfect poise. He must poise himself to do that, balance him- self upon a knife-edge. Little of an ascetic as lie was by temper, he could train himself to the last ounce if the prize were worth it. And it was. Never had musician had in- strument more sensitive to play upon. It seemed to him worthy of a lifetime of preparation to have her for one moment of time throbbing in his arms. So Morosine went into the palostrum, and fasted with prayer. His sangfroid through   Tristan,  and the going out with all its cry ringing in him, anti in her, sur- prised even himself, who knew himself well.   My friend,  lie thought, as he stalked to bis club,  you may go far.  But he had not reckoned with the flinty core which lay beneath her fair and delicate seeming. Her frugality of utterance, which charmed and chained him, really implied Rest Harrow no reserve. She did not speak, because she had nothing to say, did no  reveal her self, because she knew of no mystery. She was at once very simple and very prut tical; she had healthy tastes which she desired to gratify, and a deliberate mind which in- structed her how far she might do so. Onee in her life that had nlavcd her false, when it told her that the pity she had for Ingram was love, and the need lie had forpussession of her was her own need to give il him. She had been bitterly mistaken, and was now so wean- with herself that she seemed to have no desire in the world but that of sleep. Tristan and Isolde, drowning soul and body in music which made love, and love which was the heart of music, were not to be thought of on this side of the grave. The Fates had a sterner way for her. She was never to empty herself in a kiss or to watch out the .'tars with Jack Senhouse. Homing in the carriage with Lady Maria, she denied him, like Peter his Lord.    I know not the man.  Vaguely dreaming at her open window, under the fire-fretted roof of that May night, she sud- denly thought of him again nay, knew him bodily there, ah me with her under the sky and for the first time in her life felt his eyes upon her. seeking of her what he had never dared to seek, and then his arms about her, touching her as assuredly he had never dreamed to do. She had denied him once too often, it seems. Here was a sud- den attack, a trick of the sprites. She held her breath, she trembled, her breast heaved, she shut her eves, and her lips relaxed their hold   f cach other. "Not yet, my blessed one, not yet   and  Come, Rose of the World   Thus they murmured to cach other and strove.

Tristan s crying would be his and Isolde s whimjier of hurt would be her answer. Thus, if ever, she might be loved. And then, il ever in this world, peace  Shivering still, with the sense of an arm slill about her, of wild breath beating on her check, she looked wonderfully out at the stars which had seen her possessing. They burned steadily in their violet hold a million kindly eyes welcoming her to the Open Country. The great town lay so slill below that but for the glare In-hind the houses, which told her that it lived, she mi ht have thought herself enfolded in the hills. So sure she was that she had been wedded, she glanced .swiftly up and down the street, lest one chance passenger should have seen her naked soul. So a young girl, kissed by her lover, will search the empti- ness in fear. Not a soul could l e seen; Charles Street under its lamplight showed like a broad while ribbon curving towards the Square, towards the Park. To her heart she whispered, " Dearest, you may love me we are alone under the stars   and then shut her eyes fast, and with parted lips breathed quick and short. Out of ihe night, out of an empty street a voice came up,   He loves you none so well. He lies out on the down in a white robe. He watches for you and waits. I have seen him, talked with him of you. Can you refuse such love as his  Goddess though you are, vou will get no higher love.  The voice was very real. She knew it well. From the close arms that held her she answered it. "Oh, Struan, I know  I knew l efore you told me. It s svonder- ful. Love is a wonderful thing." "It's all we have in the world. I am here to tell you that he waits for you. Good-night.  "Good-night, Stman,  she said. "I m quite happy now.  She remembered afterwards, withashock of dismay at her selfishness, that she had never asked Struan of his welfare. She came to herself with a shudder and envisaged her rirmmsiancc. She had had "a rare vision,  like Bottom the weaver  anti that was all. Jack Senhouse had never loved her so. To him she had been Artemis, the cold goddess, or Queen Mab, whom no man might take. He had said so often  Rest Harrow and had looked it whenever she was near him Meantime, she was to l e married  and   Tristan   was unprofitable provender. It had given her an indigestion of the mind. She would go to l ed. That she deliberately did with one cere- mony. characteristic of her frugality.

She contented her- self with looking at them, smiling wisely and thoughtfully a3 she did so. Then, like a child, not trusting to her eyes alone, she looked at them with her lingers; touched them delicately in turn, with a caress. Im- mediately afterwards she locked them up; and turned to her disrobing. She slept quietly, and went al oul her affairs of the morrow with a calmness that surprised her. At a later day, in a conversation which Morosine had with her, he permitted him- self a reference to the museum.   You go no more  They ve done their work  the Three  " She smiled upon him. " Yes, they've done their work. I m much happier now. I've thrown up my arms, you see. I'm drowning.  She suddenly blushed, to rc- mcmltcr her dream; and he perceived it.   Drowning " he asked.

He read in them a wild surmise; he thought that she understood him and was perturbed per- turbed, but not displeased. The bustling entry of Chevenix, unannounced, prevented him from pursuing his campaign. Chevenix was gay.  Hulloa, Sarn ie   To be u this is ripping. I say, I have something frightfully interesting to tell you.  Then he saw Morosine.   Hulloa, Alexia, is that you  Now we'll sit each other out, and Sancic won t have her news.    But I hope I shall,  she cried.   I haven t got a secret in the world. Don t go, Prince, please. Mr. Chevenix shall tell you the news too. I haven t the faintest idea.    It s something you want to know very badly. At least, I should think you did. It's not N'cvile s address." She took him gaily.   I don't want to know that at all, if it s a new one. I have three already.    Perhaps.  said Morosine, with a friend- ly look,  it s to cancel some of them.  She held up a book.   Is that what you mean  Do look.  Greek Idylls  by S. Glyde. He sent it to me the other day. Did you mean to tell me of that   Chevenix stared. "The poet Glyde  No. By Jove, though, not a bad shot. I referred, my dear, to the poet Senhouse." She received that full in the face. She paled, then colored. Her heart leaped, then stood still. She spelled with her blue eyes,  Tell me.  Chevenix peered at her.

His slighting reference to the city was cal- culated to agitate a patriot, but I never let sentiment interfere with business. 1 drove down the upj er side of the main irrigating ditch to give him a view of the whole valley.

It's limestone." he said,  and it is folded in a way that is very interesting, but no ores will ever be found in it.  Next he came to the ditch and walked along the bank, looking at the water, as tourists always do, with a glance back at the cropping, now and then, until he came to another cropping of the kind a half a mile or so below, when he got into the 1 ar riagc and looked across the diti h to the fields of a rancher named Owen Williams. "Hecame from New York," I slid after telling the ran  her's name. "The farm indicates that he did sail the tenderfoot emphatically.  Look at the masses of shrubs and trees around the house to shut out the glare of the desert, and sec that  jreat lied of dowers. Mr. Williams knows something.

"The whole ranch, as you   ail it, shows that lie's about the only man in the valley that don't need kindergarten instruction in farming.  Dis  rvet silence, you may say. reigned after that until we were crossing the Kio Duke, just below the city limits, where people who owned horses in town dumped the 'Weepings from their stables.    hen he saw the heap he said "That's a singular place for storing ter- tilizers. 1 should think the river might rise suddenly at any time in a barren coun- try like this, and sweep the whole pile awav."

"I ve heard that farmers in the Hast have to u i- fertili- like nothing better than to take hold of a piece of land here and show people how to do it.

It would add to the good money in   ir  ulation. So. when I drove up Main Street I managed Story of a Tenderfoot to introduce him to Ben Hcatherton, the slukest real estate man west of the Mis- souri. Sure enough, a deal followed, and this is the way the Meztizo Citizen  Ben himself wrote the item  related the facts: " We are glad to announce to our readers that Prof. Vandam Wheeler, of Wheeler town, X. Y  who, while making a lour of the Great Southwest, stopjwd otT for a look at the famed valley of the Rio Oulee, was no fascinated with the universally ail mired conditions prevailing here that he has decided to locate in our midst Me has purchased, through the well-known agency of Mr. Benjamin Heatherton. a claim on the railroad land grant opposite the ram li of our esteemed fellow citizen. Mr. Owen Williams just alxwe the ditch. This quarter section he will develop as a demon- stration farm for the instruction of the ranchmen of the valley.  The fitness of Prof. Wheeler for this imjiortant mission will lie manifest to our readers when we 'ay that he has made a thorough study of scientific agriculture. His library include' several hundred vol- umes relating to the subject.  As some of our readers are saying that the professor iiought dry land because none of his books mentions the fact that water never flows over the upjier banks of irrigat- ing ditches, we hasten to slate that the loca- tion of a demonstration farm is a matter of small moment.  We shall report the progress of the pro- fessor s work minutely from time lo time, for while we have travelled much this weary mortal round, we have never heard nor even dreamed of a proposition like this.  Rather neat, ch  Sure thing, but it didn t tell the whole story. When Ben took the professor to insj ect the claim 1 drove. We went by way of the Williams ranch and took Miss Susan along. Miss Susan was the brightest young lady in the great Southwest ami as handsome as they grow. Ben calculated on marrying her. sometime; and everybody allowed that he was at the head of the procession of those who had hoj cs in the same line.   f course having a pride in the business, he wanted Miss Susan to see him turn the triik, for he knew there weren t many able to sell chunks of desert to a man right on the ground. And then he call ulated that il the tenderfoot was paying more attention to the conversation of a bright young lady than to anything else, why lie wouldn't pay quite so much attention to the desert claim as he might under different circumstances. Miik  Sure thing. I reckoned a- we drove ai ross the i laim, that it was happen- ing according to the blue prints, ti o. tor he hardly look his eyes otf the Young lady, ex- cept when Ben mentioned that we were on the ground. Then he glanced around, said "All right," and turned again to Miss Susan, direi ted her attention to a dump of the kind of i ac tus he'd   ut for a cane, and began to tell about my views of leaves and stalks. Miss Susan was a plant sharp she'd graduated bat k F.ast somewhere and they didn t talk anything but l otany all the way lo the ranch. I saw, then, that the profes- sor was right alMiut the leaf business, and 1 wondered all the more at his getting fooled into buying desert land. In fact 1 ventured to ask him if Ihe   laim suited him exactly in all respects. We had left Ben and Miss Susan at the ranch, and the pro- fessor seemed to be in a brown study at the moment, but he 'puke up i hoerfully.  Yes. sir, there s no piece of land in the valley that is better for the purpose in view," he said. He turned on the seal, then, and alter a glance back toward the Williams ranch he continued:  Yes, sir, the claim suits me exactly." So I didn t learn much. As soon as he took title the professor hired help, cleared ihe sage-brush from a strip handy to the trail on the side next to the ditc h spread that heap of stable sweepings as far as il would go over one end, ploughed all he d cleared, and then at seeding time  September , he sowed it to wheat. Meantime Ben touched him up. now and again, in the I'itizat. For instance here is one of the little raspings:  We are shocked to observe the levity with which our people mention the progress of the work on I rof W heeler's demonstra- tion farm a  conducted for ihe instruction of our ranchmen They even make the farm a show-plai e - drive out there just to see what he will do next. We therefore l eg to say we know that every furrow was turned, and every clod crushed, according to the rules found in the books, and we venture to predict that when lie has shown Story of a Tenderfoot everybody how lo raise crops without water the value of scientific attainments will re- ceive universal acclaim." I happened to be in thr jiost-officc when Mrs. and Mi s Williams got that week's L'itiwi  with their other mail. Mrs. Wil- liam' opened the paper and turned lo the item as if she'd heard about it already. Then she laughed heartily ami nudged Mi'S Susan, but all the young lady did was to wrinkle her very pretty nose at her mother and say nothing. It struck me that maybe the professor would like to know .iltoul that little comedy, s   I told him, but 1 reckoned he didn't see the poim. He began telling wlial a fine crop he was going to raise, and then he said:   If you are a sorting man just back that wheat lo make a bum  er. You can get any odds you watil from the guys. now. The chap who writes paragraphs for the Citizen, for instance, will go you ten to one. That's a straight lip, my son. Of course, you won't plunge any further than you can afford." I thought 1 couldn't afford a little bit. Even Mr Williams, who was about the only man in the valley to take the farm seriously, said lhat in a   Innate where no more than twenty inches of rain fell in the course of a year it was impossible lo make a crop. Well, inside of a week, after sowing the wheal, the line storm came with its usual downpour and the crop came up fine. The Cilizt'n had just this line at ihc head of the editorial column: "A fool for luik "  that ami nothing more, but we all knew and laughed. As the weeks jiassed. however, that wheat kept on growing and that. too. although we didn't get another drop of rain for three months  Fa  t  It grew right along all winter as well as any under the ditch, while the "fertilized plot," as the professor called it, was a far cry better. And when harvest time came well, just let me skip to the day before the one when "my rea  ers.  as the professor 'aid.  are to har- vest my lirst in strut lion   rop " I was silling in the stable office when the 'phone rang and I found our station agent on the line:  Is this the stable " he asked.  All right. Gel busy anil bring up the best of your decrepit rigs six of them The gen- eral su jcr and some more are coming up the line and they'll drop off here to per- meate the vistas, see  Yes. They're to insjiect the professor's dry ranch They re due in half an hour Come do.  When the special pulled in Ben Heather ton. who had done a lot of business for the company, was on hand to do the honors. He brought the general su  er and a big fat I  ut  hman, with sjiectacles as thick as an egg, to my carriage, and got in with them. I m  He had to sit there and listen while they talked about the dry-farm proposition  how it would revolutionize agriculture in the arid belt, make a market for the com- pany's land, double the population along the line, and all that sort of thing. It made him look right mournful. On reaching t he claim we saw Williams driving the family carriage up from the ranch, with the professor on the front seat and Mrs. Williams and Miss Susan on the back. I reckoned that the station agent had i ailed them. They greeted the bunch just as if they were accustomed to having general suj ers dropping in on them every little while, and then they all went in- specting the grain. That is. all but the fat Dutchman did. He went prospecting along the limestone cropping I mentioned. From the cropping lie went to the ditch and wandered along the bank just as the pro- fessor had done, and finally, when the bunch had seen all the wheat, he came up to the professor and said:  Ha' it occurred to you, Mr Wheeler, lhat your held might Ik.  subirrigated by seepage from the ditch    The professor looked at Ben. and then, with a ipieer little smile around his mouth, he said quietly:   Oh, yes, 1 knew the land was subirri gated before I 1 nought it.

Then with the limestone bed in mind 1 came to the ditch ami observed that the soil all the way- down the bank was as porous as it is everv- 0 -HU H t'j ii'  ftrforf DhhUu A  fcx n a. he U,uk title the pn foM x hired help, clcarcd llie v  e-bru U   Pa   Huv  '   .cunto I      u.

I therefore made borings, when negotiating for the land, and learned that while the water did not show on the surface, there was sufiicient moisture well within the rea  h of the roots of any crop that might lie planted on thi  part of the claim. I have the auger in the   arriage there now, ami if you would like to see the character of the soil, and measure  the distant e to the water table. 1 shall lie glad to run il down.     What's that '" said the general super  Are jnu saying you knew .ill the lime thi' was not a dry proposition "   Yes, sir," replied the professor blandlv.   Perhaps I ought to tell you a little more of the history of thi'   laim I was a tourist doing the town, and having learned about the optimistic and pardon me some- what lioastful ways of the people of the   ireat Southwest,  I added to the interest of the occasion by offering comments on such defects as came under my eyes be- ginning on the driver, there, who showed me the scenery on the first day. My re- mark.'. a  I have heard, led Mr Ileather- ton to urge me to buy a claim anti show the benighted j Opulace how to farm it. Though I had no more idea of buying than I have of buying another claim now, I went with him to inspect the proj erty, and  ah in the course of the excursion found reason t   think I ought to remain in Mes- tizo for a lime."  ' he said that, he glanced out of the corners of his eyes toward the Williams carriage, but he kept right on talking. "t  n learning that the land offered was thi' subirrigated patih, 1 saw at once that il would not only afford an excuse for re- maining. if that were needed, but it would give op x riunitv to carry out my little joke The Flight of the Mouse altout showing the jieople how to conduct a farm according to scientific principles.

Your methods of tillage have been scientific even if it was a joke, and what s more your ability to dis- cover the subirrigation of the claim shows your training that s right, sir. Now we are establishing three experimental farms along the line, and we shall be glad t   have you help us by taking charge of them. You're ju i the man we want. What do you say   " The professor had won nut. eh  Sure thing. And what did he say  For a moment he didn't say a word. He turned around till he faced the south and looked away toward Lava Butte. It made him flinch just as it had done on that lirst day; for the sand augers were boring their way up into the cerulean, and the heat and glare were blinding. Bui he shaded his eyes with one hand and then he said: "Be- good enough lo look at that, -dr. Believe me, I am obliged to you for your offer.

She was very beautiful, slender as a wand, with a hand like a lily, a pale face inside the particular oval that makes you think of unattainable tiling-;, the  K inted chin of a Reynolds angel, great brown eves, and coils of the palest line blonde hair. It was by chance that any of u  knew the color of her eyes. W e weren t allowed to see them, for she had, for pur- poses of mysterious concealment, full white lids, the kind Raphael set the fashion of, and a set of eyelashes long enough to fringe a cloak There got to l e l ets, at last, as to the actual color of her eyes, and the numlnrr of times a fellow could wile them out of covert. She wasn t using them for their legitimate purjtose of hiding and seeking.

As soon as we saw her we knew she w as the Mouse,though some drivelled awhile, after St. Bottle had passed, about moonlieams and angels; and we set .iIh.ui wondering what, l eyond maiden meditation, had so suppressed her.

Something had subdued her. something kept her veiled. " I know," said Chiltern one night after he had danced with her twice and been ready to vjuare otf at the rest of us for a third, until her uncle came up with re-en- fon einents of orders from the aunt  called irreverently and universally "Bellona" , and took her away,  it's lhat kangaroo of an un  le.

Fitch said. De Lisle and he were old acquaintances. Started in the coiinn-mill together, and hail a good many dealings, keeping prices on a level and hedging on strikes.

Well,  I said,  cheer up. He knows the Mouse already. He won't marry her, for if he was going to he could have done it before."   Marry her'  hooted Chiltern.  He  Marry that  Mouse." said I. But the next day it looked as if nobody were going to marry the Mouse if Bellona and Bellona's bridegroom, as we quite seri- ously called them, could prevent it nobody but one: for William Norman Pilkington Hare had arrived, an Englishman of long descent, with manners, money, everything in his pocket, six-font tw o. military carriage, fine blonde head, and a hand and foot to charm, and we saw, actually saw Bellona draw bead on him. It was at one of those foolish afternoon teas where the six young ladies then in Darjheeling who hunted in half-dozens, were displayed for sale suit- ably i haj eroned, and the mother of one of them came in towing young Hare, doubt- less for home consumption. He took his cup of lea like a man. ga ed all round with his   k-ar blue eyes, and saw the Mouse. She wasn't one of the six, but her precious uncle and aunt contrived to have her look, as they always did, some w ay or other, as if she were sitting in a specials oronatiom hair and as il her muslin dress had been made out of something mystic, wonderful. Hare s eyes dwelt on her for an instant, as the novels have it. and then he found Bellona al his i-ll  w . saying in that cultivated patois of Iiits, half middle-class Fnglish, half Bos- lonesc. that she d mci his auni, Lady 1 he      :  v ii rr u- In-rr. ll e lH-ul l imlcihitlMittJlieUctl ....r   i'uff .

" You re right.  said Chiltern. to my sur- prise. "We re nowhere beside him, espe- i tally in the eves of Bcllona." The Psalmist says he has never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. In that regard I am more correctly informed than the Psalmist, for I have seen both: but the thing I have not seen is a campaign conducted with more  ircunispec- lion and invincible purpose than the one whereby the l e Lisles set a gin for the feet of the dukelike Hare, and.linied his path- way. and threw salt upon his shining tail- feathers.

It was also true that we all looked on at the game, and we all. I think, understood. So tar as matrimonial desirability went. Hare was a prince of the bltKtd. He brought hi' reputation with him. All the dowagers knew about him in some mysterious way. as news filters al  ut among savages. They haven't the telephone, but all the same they get hold of things. You can t say how it g  cs, but information and as a rule very accurate is simply there. So it was with these Amazons of a thousand ballrooms. They even knew what ad- vances he d resisted, not like a cad. but through honc- t tlight once he d felt the lariat flinging nearer, and they all smiled when they saw America, within the brocaded sur facc of this Xcw Fngland dame, walk into the arena, throw down the same old glove, and dare him to the immemorial combat. Only it was apparently not the same chal- lenge at all. Bdlona was clever, infernally. Alter that one invitation ti  dine, instead of pursuing, she kept her ground. And she absolutely seemed t   be defending the Mouse, defending her from him, so that whoever took the girl out l    dinner, he never did. There were always reams    f table linen between them. Anri once when the Mouse had promised him a dance, Bellona actually sailed down on them and quashed it with the fial that dear Florence was al- ready overtired. The KnglUhmairs eyes dashed I saw tlut and next day two ma- trons, by actual count, told Chiltern, who groaned it  Hit tome, lhat 11.ire had applied t  r an interview with Bellona % bridegroom, and go  it And that very night llie news swept over us like a s h.h iat kind of plague that Hare had, in proper form, asked for the Mouse in marriage and In-on a    eptcd. It wa% added that the marriage would lie hast- ened, because he had hail news that his elder brother, l.ord   rm by, was likely to be at Simla, bv way of Bombay, and lhat Hare had lieen e.  K-  led to join him. And then tbc date w as actually set. They were to be married at Calcutta, invited by Lady Sampleton s foster-niece. When we heard that, Chiltern and I, wre were at the t tub, trying to resist the culinary attentions of Filch. The man who told us walked away, and Chillcm looked at me in a manner he has w hen one of his grand pas- sions finds the earth caving in under it. His lip twitched, as if it had been denied some draught, and he said:   Well, it s over. Let s go home.  I was sorry for him in a measure, but I knew time and change would paint him a cheerful scarlet.    Do you mean it     I asked.   Home     To America,  said Chiltern. We both forgot Fitch, who stood there, his little eyes fixed on us with that fatuous acquiescence he felt in our most common- place acts, and especially our prowess in talking fool talk a  he couldn t  Actually   said Fitch.  I'll go with I  you. Chiltern turned upon him with what 1 have heard called the courage of despera- tion. " By the way,  Fitch continued,   Flossie De Lisle s going to be married Wednesday.

"I ll engage passage," said Filch, with alai rity. There was no porter's errand he wasn t anxious to do l  r the reward of U-ing i heck by jowl with such bully boys as we.

She hasn t any husband,  growled Chiltern,  yet.   No,  said Fitch, with the cheerfulness of the adipose.   not yet." It was Saturday, and I was on pins to go. I felt it was time to cut the whole connct - tion, Fitch because we couldn t thole him, and the Mouse because Chiltern was mo- notonously cherishing that idea of loving her. And because he cherished it, and because it was fighting in his system to a horrible extent, I was going to do exactly what he said about time and place, and let his sick fancy go wherever it felt it could heal itself.  But it s not America, Pete,  he said, as we turned away and knew Fitch was gingerly trotting off, as if the pavement scorched him, to engage his passage. '' It s Egypt."   Egypt   We stop in Egypt i    We do. Wc take next Wednesday s boat. Wc go to Cairo. We interrogate the Sphinx. We ask her what the devil  hc thinks of this business of upsetting a fel- low's nerves becausc a girl's got a pale face and bright hair. Maybe we go on into the desert. And in two weeks Fitch take- the next boat and steams by us to Eng- lund."  Mavbc he ll stop at Egypt, too.   No, he won t. The day we leave here, we ll post him a passionate letter, saying I m summoned to paint the Lord Mayor of London, and chargc him, an  he loves us, to meet us at the Mansion House six weeks ahead." So he engaged passage under some ficti- tious name or other, I forget what now, and we were to sail the very day of the marriage.   Go on board at the last minute,  I said. I had a foolish fear Fitch would lime us,and wc should see him behind us on the deck. Chiltem s spirits were coming up. Blue water was calling him. and I saw he wasn't Vol. XI.YIll.- 25 going to spend his precious tears on any in- comparable she who could commit that last, worst solecism of accepting Another. He burst into his hoot of laughter. 1 hadn t heard it since he saw the Mouse lir t and l cgan to wear a lover's melancholy.   Fitt h won't see us,  he remarked, as if he had a pretty se  ret.   If he does, he won t know us.

Good  Will ho stand for il "  Stand for anything we take it into our noddles to do.  So the day of the sailing we were on board early, each in a fancy-ball costume where I fell extremely foolish and some- what parasitic, though Chiltern assured me he'd had tile togs put through some cleans- ing process and strictly sterilized. We were on deck, he in a high state of enjoyment, and I contemplating going below andchang- ing for Western wear, when he quieted sud- denly, as if a thought had him by the throat.   Well," he said,  it s over." I stared at him from under my turban.  Over " I said. " Yes. She s married.    Oh, the Mouse  Yes," 1 said with philosophy,  she's married.  And then as 1 watched the turmoil of the shore, I saw a carriage drive up and two women get out, one of them veiled. The other was Florence De Lisle s rawboncd, sallow maid. The first I knew her ihrough her gauze, knew her walk, her height, her slenderness was Florence De I.isle herself. They ran up the gangway with  lie unmistakable air of flight and came on Ixxird. They were near enough to touch us. I grabbed Chiltern's arm, but there was no need. He was looking at her, shockcd into silcncc. The two of them, mistress and maid, went to  hc rail and stood there. We swung off, and still they stood as if Calcutta held something they feared or loved to leave. 1 touched Chil- The Flight of the Mouse tern again on the arm, anil he followed me  it our cabin. There we looked at cach other.   He must lie on board,  said Chiltern, voicing the thought of both of us. "He's not. A bridegroom come on board and let his bride come after   "No   "She's run away   I asked, almost, I believe, piteously in the extremity of my wonder.  Yes. She hates him.

If she's run away from him, there ll be the devil's own row. There'd l e row enough if she went alone. But we two are on board, and the world s wife will say she went with us.  He opened his mouth and looked at me as if he could roar down the hatefulncss of it all. " With you, at lc.i t," I said.   And that 1 stood by you, or indecently followed on.  Chiltern halted then- looking down on his perfectly cleansed costume. Then his eye travelled over mine.   We ve got to keep these on," he said.  The whole voyage   "Yes. I'll go and see Ridgway. I ll tell him we consider it a kind of a joke  Ridgway knows we're a pair of fools oh, damn, Peter, damn   " You won't mention her " I tailed after him.

" Well,  said he,   how do you suppose they re registered    1 couldn't guess, and he added, as if it capped the top of wonder: "Mrs. Hare and maid."  Then she's married.  That was all that occurred to me to say. " Married and he's not here. Well,  1 mused, after an- other soggy moment,  she's run away. As you say, she hates him.  And I could see through the thin veil of Chiltem s quiet, moved only by a breathing like a racing tug, that he was wondering by chance whether there was a man she did not hate. The tension of that sixteen days  voyage tires me now to think of. Mrs. Hare the Mouse no longer wasgoing on to England; then, ten days out, she changed her mind, Ridgway said, and was going to stop off in Egypt. Chiltern and 1 kept our state- rooms except after dark, and we matle the deck our own for the greater part of the night. Even to Ridgway, we didn t own why wc wanted our identities sealed as the grave. It was a bet, we told him, and then, in an exuberance of bitter fancy, a bet with Fitch, whom he also knew, that we couldn't or wouldn t travel incog, to Cain . Chiltern was tom in two by the aching wonder of it all. He pondered whether she perhaps guessed he was on board nobody thought of the possibility of her loving me  or whether she was just living for terror of what she d left behind. He felt himself in the midst of an adventure beside which the talcs of Scheherezade are as the babblings of Tupper, ami yet like a clear blue skv above his tragedy stage, was the unalterable determination in us both that a good girl should not be compromised. More than that, she should not fall into dangers un- gucssed by her, as they were as yet by us. Sometimes we didn't more than half trust the maid. She looked like a locked black morocco bag, for silence. What did she know, we wondered, or had she planned the flight  Was the Mouse somehow in her power, anti where was the Portmanteau taking her  They stayed in their own cabin a good deal, we found by chance from Ridgway, and it s safe to say the voyage was the stuffiest one the four nf us ever had. Then at last Cairo, and we followed them to Shepheard's anti heard them make their bargain, with a gotxl deal of dignity on the part of the Mouse, and saw them going to their rooms. We turned out incontinently upon that, though we had apparently been waiting till the Fnglish ladies should be served, went to a trustworthy dive Chiltern knew about, and there washed our faces and got into the dress of American men of respectable degree. Then we took rooms The Flight of the Mouse 247 at the Hotel  li- Londws, opposite Shcp- heard s, and again forswore the air of heaven to sit at our windows and note whether or when our mysterious dames came forth. They did, anil wc followed them at a distance. The Mouse seemed interested in shops, timid about bargaining, but spirited and even happy. She walked differently, with her head up and a certain swing and go amazing to us. Her cheek.-., so pale when wc had watched her at Dar- jhecling, had the -.lightest tlush. Whether she ever saw us or not, w e could not tell. By that time we were worn and fractious with the qucetness of it all, and sometimes there seemed to be no reason why she shouldn t sec us. Only, if she did, there was a per- fectly understood compact between us that no one should be recognized. But the grow- ing change in her  Every day she seemed to l c more buoyant, more intoxicated with something that looked like expectation. " If this keeps on,  said Chiltern one night from the darkness of his chamber where wc sat together,   wc shall forget she was the Mouse.   So I thought,  I answered,   though it's l eyond me what to call her now."  Me. too," he said, "unless it's the leopard." "No, the leopard s cruel, when she likes. This girl s not cruel. Only she s alive at last and wonderful."   Yes," said Chiltern, sucking at his pij e.    She s wonderful." So it went on for three weeks, 3 month, and then another night Chiltern came in to me with business written over him.   Sur your stumps," he said. " They're going to the Pyramids by moonlight." "How do you know   Heard the order given. Walked into Shephcard's to ask fool questions and see whether they were in the garden, saw the maid come down, heard the carriage or- dered."  They re going in a carriage    Yes.   By themselves "  ' Apparently.  "I don t like that. They're safer in the tram."   Well, you're going too, so you might as well like it.    Oh,yes," I said absently," of course I'm going myself, but I don t like that either. I wish wc were all at Coney Island seeing the moving pictures or down at Cuttyhunk.  So when the carriage came round to take the Mouse and the Portmanteau out to the Pyramid  the ancient king- seemed to have buildcd for the special purpose of a scene- setting for all that was to do, two saddle- horses were waiting at our door, and after a suitable interval, Chiltern and 1 mounted and followed on l ehind, like a particularly asinine branch of special police.  I m thinking," 1 said, while the leather creaked.  What   Chiltern flung at me.  That somehow this night .-, the night that settles it." " Yes." He bit the word off sham.   It is."  And I'm thinking ii she does recognize you, and you forget Hare, you'll tell her how' we ve followed her. You'll tell her a giK d many things.    I sha'n't forget Hare," said lie savagely.   Don't,  1 recommended. If you're going to be in love, which, I con- tend, is a special curse only ameliorated by the inevitable oblivion at the end, there's no place to be in love like the country where Cleopatra wooed her Antony. Moonlight and the Pyramids, the avenue of lcb  ck trees, the Libyan hills beyond where we could sec, and holding it all. like a sorccrcss with her lap full of sleepy runes, Egypt. Whole reams of poetry, stuff 1 hadn t thought of since I was twenty, came rushing into my head, and I swear I don t know to this day whether it was mine or Shake- speare's.   If I speak," I said, and I knew I said it drunkenly,   I shall speak in verse." Chiltern understood. He answered with a perfect gravity.    Yes. Don t do it, though. We could- n t any of us bear it.  By that   any of us  I saw he included in our possible meeting, the woman in thccar- riagc ahead. Wc were riding slowly to keep well away, and suddenly We became aware, at the same moment, 1 think, of a mad rhythm of hoofs U-hind us. There was one man riding, riding like the wild huntsman at least.  That s business,  said Chiltern.   Let him pass us," I threw back at him.  We can keep an eye on him and ride him down.  2-1S The Flight of the Mouse The rhythm of hoofs camc nearer. The man rode with a reckless haste, and no eye for us, save to turn out. He was abreast of us. He passed, and we, by one impulse, started our horses into the same wild gallop and kept on with him.    You saw " Chiltern cried out to me.   I saw,  I answered, with, I think, as savage emphasis. The man was Haro. He was still ahead of us, going like all possessed, and we doubled our pace. We were twenty feet behind him, and he at least twenty-live feet behind the carriage, and he now, as if this were exactly the distance he had deter- mined upon, dropped into an easy trot, and we did the same. So there we were at an even pace, not to meet, it seemed, until we reached some point tacitly decreed, which was presumably the Pyramids. And now the Pyramid was looming up l eforc us. a black bulk of velvet in the dark. Once only I spoke to Chiltern. I reined in beside him.  ' What are you going to do   I asked. He turned his head to me and I saw, or thought f saw, in the moonlight, that his eyes were bloodshot.    It depends,  he said. He was breath- ing short anti hard. " If she hates him, kill him.  But I knew he wasn't armed or thought I knew it and wondered, in a dull way. what he would find to do the deed, and thought with distaste of the whole embroil- ment: and by and by we were there, and the monument of ages was looking majesti- cally down on us and our midget passion The Bedouins were wrangling for a big party of English that had come to see the Pyramids by moonlight, so that they forgot briefly to wrangle for us. and the English mainma was so exercised over finding at the last minute that Baedeker had implied the young ladies should wear divided skirts  which they had not provided , that she wa  forbidding them stridently to ascend at all. and that gave the Bedouins matter for more entreaty. In the little outside swirl of peace beside these tempestuous forces, the Mouse had alighted, given her driver an order, and with the Black Portmanteau turned aside to a remoter spacc where, it was evident, she meant to observe the Pyra- mids and the heavens for a moment   by the world forgot." While they did this. Hare sat his horse like a statue, watching them; but when it was fairly evident that this was what she meant to do, he flung himself out of the saddle, gave a Bedouin the bridle to hold, the act accompanied by a few terse words wherein I detected the name of the Prophet and  bakshish.  and strode off after the Mouse. Chiltern threw himself oft his horse, selected another Bedouin, re- peated Hare's promise and potential curse, and gave him the bridle. Then I did the same, nailing another son of Egypt, and Chiltern followed Hare and I followed Chil- tem. And by the time we reached the man and woman, and halted at a distance of per- haps five paces, we both saw at the same in- stant that Hare had put out his hands and the Mouse had, with the quickest gesture of entire abandon, gripped them with hers. There they stood looking in each others faces with a tense, drawn, spiritualized,per- fectly happy look, and the moon Cleopatra saw when she fed upon Antony s face was shining on there in the old way, and the desert was whispering outside, and the god- dess Hathor walked the sands that night and drenched us all. each with the particu- lar philter conducing to his own especial madness. I had time for a look at the maid, the Black Portmanteau, and I saw she had really withdrawn herself, as if somehow this climax were what she had been expect- ing all along, and had prepared herself for as something it would be a part ofhercor- rect training to ignore. So she looked at the moon, and looked at the Pyramid, and thought, I doubted not, of some glorious niailre d'hoteI who had enslaved her heart in the course of her wanderings, and whom she would see no more. What was the odds, waUre d'hotel or Chiltern. Hare or Antony  The moon knew all about it equally. While I thought these gibl ering thoughts, Hare linked at his wife oh, I knew it now  and she looked straight at him. No more veiling of lids, no more re- treating into the sanctuary of maidens-all- alonc. They looked, and as if they adored each other and were sustained, exalted by what they saw.

N'  more could she look at him now. Her face turned away a little, and I thought, if it had been dawn instead of mounlight, he might have seen her forehead, even, deep with red. But this was the moment when he understood. "Dearest,  he said, just that one word, and she began to cry, softly, with no sobs or whimpering, only I was perfectly sure the tears were tlowing down her cheeks.   You ran away   said Hare. He spoke as a very losing person docs to a naughty   hiId: and then the Mouse did something no one ever saw her do in the past days of her frozen girlhood. She laughed out long and gay. a warm, bright flood, in the very face of the Pyramid and Egypt.   I ran away,  she said. "What for   asked Hare. " For you to follow.  This -he said brazenly. "What for  Why was I to follow "   Don t you know   So 1 could lie court- ed and persuaded as girls ought to Ijc, a%an American girl has got to be.    h. you don't know me yet  Wait till you know me, Englishman   Wc had none of u  known her, I saw that; I heard it in her thrilling voice, the strength and will and passion it ilung for all the airs of Egypt to carry to whatever ears they would. The Englishman straightened; a quiver ran through him. He accepted, I saw, all her unspoken challenges. "Was I to meet you here   he asked. That same dauntless thrill was in his voice, the one wc heard in hers. " Was this in- tended  Does this content you " "Why     Because if it doesn't I'll leave you here. You shall go on alone, and I ll follow for as long os you like, and as far as you like. And I ll kiss your footprints all the way." That was doing pretty well for an Eng- lishman, I thought, and then 1 remcml ercd that Shakespeare wrote in English, and, for the matter of that, a man named Rossetti. She was answering. " You were not to meet me here. It was to be longer, England, America, perhaps. But I giit tired of waiting.  Her voicc dropped. She had waited for him over one steamer, and she was tired of waiting. And then Hare l ont toward her in the lace of Egypt and the haggling Bed- ouins, the skirted English daughters, the Pyramids and the moon, and she made haste to meet him, and they kissed each other, and Hare drew her into his arms and they may have kissed again. But I missed Chiltern from my side, and looked about tor him. He was bark there by the milling tourists, mounting his horse, and the Bed- ouin was examining the bakshish given him, and apparently thinking it a plenty, for he called u K n the Prophet to rain honey upon Chiltern while at the same time, beg- ging him to stay and climb the Pyramid, accompanying his remarks with some gro- tesque adjuration about Mark Twain. But Chiltern was riding off, anti I got my horse in haste and rode after him, though to the tune of curses because my coin had been less abounding. Through the long, slug- gish ride back to the hotel we did not speak; but that night 1 did gather from Chiltern that we were to leave Cairo next morning. Next morning wc did leave, and as wc were going down the steps of the Hotel de Londres for the last time that trip, we came full upon a man anti woman,she in the most beautiful tlothcs even an American bride ever clothed herself in withal, yet simple as the sheath round a flower, and he with a bridegroom s proudest sovereignty written on him. This the Mouse  It was a creat- ure with rose-man tied cheek and eyes that looked straight at you, rejoiceful, shining, with things promised in their depths that would take the happy bridegroom a thou- sand years to learn. She stopped, put out her hand to Chiltern, llien to me. She looked at us both, half tenderly, even, half in whimsical confession, the sort where the mouth smiles and the brows are rueful. "You've been awfully good,  she said.  THE POINT OF VIEW- I HAVE watched numberless persons walk around a great sione near my house  a round stone with a hollow in the top. filled with water, where the birds come to drink  and dilate learnedly after this fashion:  Think how it was carried for thousands of years on the back of a glacier, and how it was rubbed and ground by ice and stones till its angles were worn down into this perfect sphere.'  All very true were this stone a boulder, but it happens to be quite another tiling, a concre- tion, which grew round from babyhood and never had any angles to rub off. It started perhaps with a bit of shell or fish bone falling into the soft mud of a stream. This nucleus acted like a magnet, attracting to itself little particles of congenial mat- ter which hugged it layer after layer like an onion; while the water above, holding iron and lime and silica in solution, percolated through the growing concretion anti ccmentcd it into a solid stone. After such fashion does local history grow up. You take a house or bit of land. .1 rt ad or a river or Indun treaty, as a nucleus; and as you read old books, newspapers, and letters; examine old maps, plans, and pictures; and as you talk with old residents your facts form layer after layer around your centre; and as you compare ami generalize and let your imagination tlow over all, your house or bit of land, or road, or river, or Indian treaty grows and crystallizes into a shapely, lasting concretion of local history. In choosing some nucleus for a study of local history, one cannot do better than begin with one's house or yard. One should trace back the several ownerships to the original grant; discover what Other buildings were ever on the place, with something about the tarlicr people who lived there; if Indians ever hunted on it or soldiers tramped over it; change  of topography; when adjacent roads were opened; and one sown family traditions. One incident will inevitably lead to another, fascinating tacts will peep from every cover, and conversation will follow the trend. All one's tin-1- should be firmly held in place by the little rivets of accurate names and dates Take, for instance, my own home in the heart of a busy manufacturing city of the mid- dle West. My garden lies about midway be- tween two ancient  cities of refuge,  built by the Neutral Nation about three centuries ago. Warring tribes of the West might enter the Western city, and those of the East the Eastern, but   sanctuary" reigned within. Later my garden was part of a Wyandotte village; anil during the War of 1S12 two companies of British regulars, veteran troops of Wellington's Peninsular campaign, attacking a local fort, marched over where my cardinal flowers now bloom. Later a small French colony used the plot for a burving-ground. The patent for the first sale of thus land was signed by Andrew Jackson, and became part of a family tract. Sixty years ago my mother, from  down East," arrived for a visit, and penetrating be- yond the reach of railroads came up the little river by boat. At the landing-place she was hoisted to a seat on her trunk in a wagon to be driven  into the woods."

Nor did it stop there, for I have but just learned o: a z-illii of three thousand inhabitants in Paraguay, named after this local resident who as President acted as arbiter in a territorial dispute between Paraguay anil Argentina. Modestly local, however, do I keep my collection of data, believing that my business in the matter is to edit just that bit of land and lore under my own charge, and make the most of it in the limited time at my disposal.

EVKRY one may not know that the IJIue- Ikooks, whirh a lieuetiienl government sends for the asking,arc most interesting reading. This is not only by tin  way of their wide range of pertinent topics and expert treat- ment, Blue books an- lirst ol all records of fact and experience. Hut these allow lor ihe imagi- nation lit play like lightning around Ihrir dull- est periods, and one sees bv llaslR-.s the vast in- tricacies of those wonder-working forces whose impulse comes from the national capital, but whose results reach the antipodes. Il was after reading one of these liluc-books that 1 was able to realize how base ball has  icnciratcd into the very bones and li.iM-h.ill marrow of our national life. This  n i ihc particular book was issued by the Islue-books Insular Department, with many attractive photographs, for our revered Uncle docs his book-making with distinction. It is entitled  The Kc xjrl of the Philippine Commission on Education in the Philippines,  and it sent my mind picking up threads over a retrospective  jeriod longer than I care to reckon. With ihe relation of base-ball to the finer qualities of speech I have long lieen familiar and appreciative. In the hey-day of youth I was an honorary member of a base ball club. II was called, I remember, the Kckiongas, a local Indian name. On Saturday afternoons the club would send  hacks" for the honorary members, that these might cheer on their he- roes equally to glory or ilefeat. Thus we were able to talk fluently of  daisy cutlers  and "sky scrapers,  and of  romping home   talking poetry as M. Prudhomme talked prose, without knowing it. Since those days base- l all has developed a speech of its own, but in overlooking the daily events on the diamond, it docs not seem that such phrases as  bounc- ing a roller" and  spunky bunts" comjurc favorably with the pictorial metaphors we were accustomed to in those earlier days. We were also in at the entrance of base lxill into the higher mathematics, and learned to recognize the niuming curves which were engaging the attention   l the professors. To our minds the pitcher who lirst gave that pecu- liar twist to the ball whit Ii brought to notice new manifestations of force and velocity, seemed destined to go down the ages with Newton and Euclid. Alas'. I have forgotten his name. Scientifically Uise-hall has out- stripped its honorary members, and the skill of Nlatty and Wagner and other famous men ia to-day a matter of diagrams and demon- The Point of View stration and only to be fully understood at the universities. Hut the grcaicst triumph of base ball is not that it engages the professors, but that it con- solidates the people. A young Englishman recently arrived finds the  x.-rvading interest in base ball, reaching as it does down to the lower- most stratum of the imputation. the most ex- traordinary thing in this country. Cricket as a national sport in his islands rarely gets beyond the yeomanry. The curates and the guests of the manor house may play the villagers, but the factory hands have no more interest in i riiket than they have in polo or golf; and as for the submerged tenth, it hardly knows that the game exists. On Ihe other hand, in this country from ocean to ocean the scene rejieats itself; crowds in cities stand cheering and groaning before bulletin boards; factory hands have an inning   r two al the noon hour, with the boss and clerks standing by; on Saturday afternoons the farmers' boys play in lonely fields, with mother and the girls in buggies and spring-wagons looking on. Inland Empire plays the Pacific Coast, and at Spokane the air is rent with cheers while Seattle laments, just as Chicago shouts when the Cubs defeat the Giants, while New York gloomily turns on its heel and goes its several ways. Now for the Blue-book. Itase-l all follows the  lag. In the Philippines, it seems that base-ball is not an insignificant factor in our educational scheme, for il gels into ihe gov- ernment reports among nature studies and manual training.  Wc first got hold of tlie Jolo boys through base-ball,  writes one teach- er of the young untamed Moros. "I have always found base-ball a good way to interest the children in the schools,  writes another. A division superintendent informs the Philip- pine Commission that  base-ball is doing more than anything else to enlist the sympathies of the inhabitants. Among ihe boys it engenders a spirit of perseverance, determination, of struggling against difficulty and opposition. The base-ball players arc the most activc and progressive of our students.  Again wc learn that Mr. Leonardo Osioro has offered a silver cup to the winning team at Cavite. There is to be a meet at Sorsogon 1 etween teams from Masbate, Albay, and Sorsogon for a silver cup, known as the Trent base ball trophy. At the 15a tan gas Normal School base-ball con- tributes to the study of English, for any player who uses other than an English word must retire from the field. The absorbing interest al Lingayen is which of the two base-ball teams will win, and the inhabitants turn out each week to watch the practice games on the plaza.  One can always raise money for the base ball team," writes a teacher, alluding to the intention of his district in southern Luzon to send a team to Manila It  plav the Manila boys. Even the superintendent of public instruction finds it worth while to inform the Commission that  nearly every high school has organized base-ball teams. Inlcrscholastic games have l een arranged. Filipenos take to l asc-ball with enthusiasm, and show remark- able skill at it.  Flsewhere several teachers are honorably mentioned as instructors of base- ball All this in a grave, matter-of-fact Bluc- book.  Blest be the tie that binds," says ihe old fashioned hymn; base-ball unites all classes and conditions of men, from the While House through every layer of our cosmopolite pop- ulation, until il enwraps little Brown Brother in the isles of the sea.  THE FIELD OF ART- OPPOKTl XI TIES f OJy' 1ST STff V  X A7: t ONE used to think of the flaneur abroad as enjoying op iortuniiics for indulg- ing his taste for the line arts of which we in America were deprived, and until recent years these did indeed seem  Kvuliarly the prixi lep: of those sojourning in the centres of the Old World. Christie s, the Motel Druout, were hailed as little Meccas by the art-loving  nli;rim The writer well recalls the satisfaction with which, in tlie Paris of his day, he sometimes started out with an exhibition in prospect at perhaps the Cercle Mirliton or the Galeries Petit. That morning took 011 a little air of fftc, for was he not to see some examples of those experimenters in Impressionism who were startling the world of art under the title of   Les Intransigents" at a certain dealer s on the Avenue de l'Opera  This collection was most interesting in its intimations of those problems of light which have been carried so far to-day as to make these statements appear conservative. Those were days of curiosity, of surprise at the audaciousness of this band of Intransigeatils; but much of this I say would not now move us to protest, as it then did, would appear rather drmojt' and perhaps a little dull. Even the bold surface lights of Caillebotte, so assured,     confidently placed, would not strike one a  unusual to-day; on the contrary, this particular painter as now seen in the Luxembourg, where he and some of his associates have gained entrance, seems dis- creet in touch and color, and not remarkably interesting, although he possesses tine greys and a charming sentiment of light. Our flimeur would then go on and take in, as a kind of antidote, a collection of portraits at the Mirliton, where he would Ijc diverted by the different renderings of tlie human individual as portrayed by such differing temperaments as Carolus-Duran, Cabancl, Itonnat. Bastien- Lejxage, Courtois, Chaplin, and Dagnan Bouxeret. But this exfierience of which I Speak was at a period of the past xxhen there was no provision for similar anticipation to thrill the amateur in New York, To-day, however, I dare hazard the state- ment that during a winter season New York furnLslies as rich opportunity--, fur the fas- tidious art loxer as do the capitals of Furope. Times haxe changed as much in the- - matters as in more material things, and the wealth that has landed  ft hitulrs Monvraulrs al our dotirs has none the lev. given us Van Dycks. Fran  liaises, Rembrandts, Gainsboroughs, Sir Joshuas, and Romneys; xvhile the innumera- ble examples of the most precious masters of the Dutch School, as well as splendid canvases by those innovators and renovators of French painting, Monet, Manet, Degas. Sisley, Re- noir, and I issaro, may lie hail for the stroll down Fifth Avenue and through some of its adjacent streets. Ni r must we overlook those of our oxvn landscape painters who here, often in  one man exhibitions" or groups, show their range and their sympathy with the sights of the out- side xvorld that I believe would, in Paris, at- tract a circle of admirers those in that un- usual city xvlio possess the true  flair" for art,  which would make them the talk of the town. This is no unreflecting statement. I am sufficiently familiar with the temper of  ib- serxant Parisians concerning art to know that there would be a quick response to the beauti- ful vision of these painters and their expression of it on canvas; for they are making the love of nature more general, and creating indeed, even here, a Considerable constituency of com- petent connoisseurs The public is becoming conscious that thi.-. is not all virtuosity; and although mere skill is jierhaps sometimes too obvious, many are moved bv the general seri- ous puqiosc of these men. It is into rooms along these thoroughfares that I propose to step and, in a leisurely way, note works of really permanent interest that may lie found there; for ii ha% seemed desirable thus lo coll attention to the significance of these ad- x'antages not to New York only, but to the country at large. For it must not be forgot- ten that there is a whole world of l cauliful art lying dormant in somnolent comers of palates and country houses the which needs but ihe touch of a M.eonas to xvakcn, to bring to light and make a living influence 011 the craft of modern painting. All this stored competency, accessible only to tin.- favored fexv, -53 254 The Field of Art will soon become vivified and stimulate and give vigor to the artistic output of the present. It cannot lie otherwise; for there is a curios- ity ami intelligence abroad in the world of to- day that must make this revelation of the past   f great significance. Changing conditions, as I have said, are already bringing these treasures from their hiding and placing them where all may see, study, and enjoy. It is no slight thing to have this treasure- house of l cauty ojtened to us. to be free to note the jolly mastery of Hals through his swift and fluent passages of paint, to study the subtle profundity of Rembrandt, the distinction of Van Dyck, the blazing truth of Monet, the analytic observation of Degas, the uncom- promising honesty of Manet, and the marked individuality of a host of others. This  k'- mocratizing of the line arts this offering to whom will the enjoyment that has been for- merly the privilege of a favored class  is dis- tinctively a note of the present, one with the world s movement to-day. For instance, a roomful of Manets alone which we stopped in to see was of a character to make one intolerant of the painted pict- ures that are constantly turned out. Indeed, where will one find such sincere searching for the just value, close statement of color, truth of plane, and almost perfectly sustained surface, texture as in some of his pictures  Veracious observation is one of the elements of simplicity that this painter possesses, and it is a quality which seems to belong to the great traditions of painting. I le was a master of U:autiful paint, and not all the pretty, dex- ti rous, and sometimes astonishing manipula- tion of a lesser man ran move one who has been attuned to the sonorous notes ami ele- mental truth of this modem master. This, as opposed to the thin and colorless  tainting we sometimes meet with, is in the nature of a tonic; ami the layman cannot do better than t   avail himself of it  invigorating stimulus. Manet was an experimenter also and not above changing his methods if by doing so he could get nearer the truth; and although he l egan in the dark heavy tones derived from his admiration of the Spaniards, Velasquez, and Goya, his evolution was steadily toward the light Much of the Impressionist s value lii-s in the delivering of certain pure tones from the palette to the canvas; this is often done, however, at an entire sacrifice of composition, drawing, and of almost every other clement which goes to the production of a work of art. This does not apply to Manet; but where perhaps the intellectual element did not exist among some of his companions, he was not slow to recognize that they had, by their ex- periments, contributed much to the clarifying of the palette, and from this time on he was less influenced by the art of the past than bv that modem realism in subject which, as a painter, he thereafter represents. A generous collector and his wife permitted the public exhibition for several weeks of a group of paintings which it was a rare privilege to see and a kind of art education to have attentively studied. Three examples of Hals would have made it notable of themselves. In speaking of Hals, his obvious skill is so marked that one is sometimes forgetful of a finer side of this great painter. Of these por- traits we may only speak of that of Michiclcz de Wael who is represented also in one of the Corporation pictures at Haarlem; but the treatment of this single figure as a portrait was fuller of detail, more developed as a morceau, than would be the case where it made one of a group; and it was a delightful surprise to ob- serve that Hals could realize his individual so effectually without distracting your attention by his clear and logical method; the method was still there, but it now becomes the art which disguises art. The Rembrandt in this collection was full of accomplished painting, although not so full of an earnest searching to express something..deeper than mere externals which was this painter s later characteristic. This young man in the act of rising from his chair was of the early period of Rembrandt s work. These strolls among transient exhibitions afford frequently the opportunity of compar- ing the work of different stages of an artist s career, and it is a fact that in the case of Rem brand  nearly ihe whole range of his produc- tion m3y be studied through the examples lhat sooner or later are shown in New York. Hut it is in no sense a local matter, this seeing things in New York; it is merely that the leaven which spreads throughout the country happens for the moment to be found there. These art treasures which we are touching upon in this pajier have furnished topics for drawing-rooms and clubs from Los Angeles lo Philadelphia. The visitors lo a much lalked-  if Van I _vc.k exhibition, for instance, were from such widely separated points, and the interest was great in this opportunity kindly provided by two other public-spirited collectors. The Field of Art It may not lx- too much to say that this prtncc of portrait pointers a master from ihc beginning. His life lasted but forty-two years, and in his twenty-second year he did the portraits of I'ran  Snyders and his wile, which for dignified seriousness of purjxxvc and mas- tery of painting arc equal to his malurer work. Van Dyck may have gained later, by contact with the world, that quality of investing his high-bred sitter with the personal distinction which belonged to him; but it is difficult to mark any essential advance in a style of paint- ing that was so finished when he painted these two friends at the beginning of his career. Of his Italian period seven examples were shown. That of the Marchcse Elena Grimaldi was of the traditional Van Dyck, disclosing high birth, stately carriage, .sumptuous surroundings; a young negro servant holding a scarlet parasol, with accessories of Corinthian columns and vista of landscape all betokening the circum- stance to which the painter was accustomed and in painting which he was always happy. One weakness of Van Dyck was not absent from these canvases generally- his stereotyped and mannered treatment of the hands; they appeared all cast in the same mould, when in reality they arc a feature as distinctively per- sonal as the head itself to him who truly secs. The demand for constant production must have caused the painter to slight this fact in his work; for to no man of his ability can one otherwise attribute this lapar. When one studies these works from the point of view of to-day it is true that with our modern vision there would perhaps be dis- covered in the work of the present a broader and more logiral  envelope  to the sccnc or a figure thus placed, a more sensitive realization of the various surfaces os affected by the same conditions of light; but for adroitness of touch and nobility of design wc must acknowledge this man a master. There was in these can- vases so strong a sense of pictorial statement and so thorough an acquaintance with tbe means, that the picture appeared to paint it- self. By this I mean that the palette was acccpicd as fixed -no over-anxious searching for the exact tone as influenced by the sur- rounding air there were certain conventions of color that remained for him unchanged, and the artist was thus left free to concentrate his powers on the design, the shape, the pattern that should distinguish his canvas; and it is this clement in the best work of the past that has its lesson for us. For from these works one carried away the impression of beautiful forms, handsome lines, well studied folds in drapery, and well-obwrved masses and li.il ante of parts, satisfying to the eve. I am not calling attention to these qualities as anything new in themselves, but to the fact that this aggregation of Nan Dycks empha- sized for us the high character of work put out habitually by thcsC great men; and that through opj  rtunities like these we may train ourselves to look for the same high  ierfor- mancc in the work of to Lay, How fares it with us  It is through possessing a public of connoisseurs that really fine art is produced; for ihe workman i  stimulated by appreciation, and every goi  I work applauded engenders others that will surely follow. Great work always has an audience, is always modern. No better illustration of this could be found than that furnished by a certain exhibition and sale of modern masters so considered forty years ago. Itut as a whole these pictures proved comparatively spiritless when placed before the public which at the same time greeted the Van Dycks and Halses with en- thusiasm; for these latter had not changed with fashion. Among this exhibition of mod- ern men it was interesting to remark that their earlier output was much more sincere than that done later to supply their market  for they undoubtedly had a market, and for the must part a good one. Still, there were canvases here by Bonn.it and Bouguereau that for artistic feeling and sincerity of painting suqiasscd the work of their later years. I re- call the  Ribera Sketching in Rome," by Bonnat, and  Maternal Affection,  by Bou  gucrcau that for artistic feeling and sincerity of painting much surpassed the work of their later time. Bonnat painted hi.-, story with ex- cellent taste, and with a jticturcsquc not to say romantic sentiment. It was particularly rich in coloring and disclosed real love for the' lieauty of paint If it had possessed, in ad- dition, a sensitiveness to the charm of out- door light there would have been little left to Ik  desired in this otherwise handsome canvas. This is where men of a still later day excel.  Maternal Affection," by Bouguereau,showed him more than usually interested in a theme that to his years of after industry liecanic trite. A comparatively early Meissonier, "The Card I'laycrs," was a surprising study in facial expression, and of an insistence on detail that look il out of the category of ihe artistic and The Field of Art landed it frankly in the realm of artifice. Mcissonicr has done much more earnest work, I mean more that placed him on a higher a-slhctic plane, but rarely anything that was better calculated to astound bv its command  ins; dexterity This kind of painting Is a far call from the breadth, grasp, and sweep of the work that has been discussed throughout this brief recital, but it goes to show the variety of art oppor- tunity that may he enjoyed by those who fol- I .v, the free exhibitions in New York during t .ie winter months No more varied oppor- tunities may be had abroad; and in the fre-   uc nt displays here of native painting in land- scape alone, in certain instances, we equal, if we do not surpass, the best current work of Europe. We may note Metcalf s accomplished ob- servation and increasing command in the use of pigment; Massam's broken and beautiful color to which he gives an added breadth in his. liter work; W eir s essentially earnest and ele- mental emotion, often expressed with a sus- tained energy of execution  tint touches tlic profound. And Oarl-cn's cxijuijite patti pus of seeing nature with a kind of specialized vision, very charming and very fine, but a way which may perhaps permit one to predicate his manner ol rendering a given sccne. There is. however, a sensitiveness in render- ing the sights of nature that is essentially American. The foreign painter is plastic  strongly moved by the physical aspect of the world, and bold in Statement; while we of this country appear more lyrical in our sense of lovely scenes. The fragile air of budding life in spring is most successfully presented by our painters, and indeed all seasons have devotees who appear to penetrate more deeply the senti- ment of the world surrounding us than those of other nations. The exhibition of the Ger- man Secessionists a year ago was testimony, in the case of the Germans at least, that, while they were still groping, we had already laid hands on problems that with them were tenta- tive. There is little doubt that the accumulation    f vast fortunes here will awaken some day in their possessors the consciousness that they have purchased the priceless gift of thoughtful leisure; it is high time then that serious atten- tion were called to the potential use of this gift; and the cultivation of a more competent judgment in the line arts is peculiarly suited to the employment of such leisure. The demand, consequently, for an authori- tative voice in art criticism is becoming a very urgent one with us; for the treasure that is being poured into art investment should be wisely expended. And the way this responsi- bility can be adequately met is this very one of making use of the op  orlunities which, as we have endeavored to show, are here as rich as in the boasted art centres of the world. Let us then sec to it that we make good use of them in following these exhibitions; there is scarcely a season of the year when we may not visit them with profit, for it will be seen that the evolution of painting, from the period when splendor of design was its most signifi- cant note, to the present, when truth of sight is its prevailing tendency, may be examined, pondered over, and studied here; and with a public thus trained we arc in a fair way to be- come a nation whose achievements in art will be commensurate with its material greatness Frank Fowier.

To be within arm s reach of distant cities it is only necessary to be within arm s reach of a Bell Telephone. It annihilates space and provides instanta- neous communication, both near and far. There can be no boundaries to a tele- phone system as it is now understood and demanded. Every community is a center from which people desire com munication in every direction, always with contiguous territory, often with distant points. Each individual user may at any moment need the long distance lines which radiate from his local center. An exchange which is purely local has a certain value. If, in addition to its local connections, it has connections with other contiguous localities, it has a largely increased value. 1 f it is universal in its connections and inter-communications, it is indispens- able to all those whose social or business relations are more than purely local. A telephone system which under- takes to meet the full requirements of the public must cover with its ex- changes and connecting links the whole country.

This places the complete control of the rifle under the trigger fin- ger, and makes it unnecessary to take the eye off the sights when shooting rapidly.
