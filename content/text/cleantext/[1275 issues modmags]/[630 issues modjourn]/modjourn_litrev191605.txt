no Amateurs are going to be allowed to scribble for THE LITTLE REVIEWSpeaking as a subscriberI haven t the least desire to read any of HBauer s clumsy attempts to express himself in a medium that is foreign to himLet him stick to his businessYou must write the article you have in mind yourselfFrom the depths of your artistic intuitions draw forth the material and give away the secretswhich are no secretsMoreoverdon t confine yourself to musicmuch less to piano playing take in the whole field of art and call itThe Compleat Amateurorw Not To Be an Artist I suggest the following headingsExtract from a letter of the AuthorLe Style fait l hommeyou want to become an authorgive up your life to the study of calligraphyif a painterdevote yourself to the manufacture of paints and brushesif a composercommit to memory the number of notes in every standard classical workand if a singer or instrumentalistspend your whole energy in the establishing of asound technical foundation Emotional expression can thenif desiredbe subsequently smeared like treacle on bread over all these different stylic basesthis operation requiring neither skill nor expression Means to an Endamateur must learn that technique represents an obstacle to be overcome and a set of tools to be acquiredIt has nothing to do with expressionOnly an imaginative artist like Maeterlinck would suggest that the road along which the student travels towards his destination is in reality a linka connection joining one with the other an umbilical cord partaking of the nature and attributes of both traveler and goalTo a perfectly rational person the road is merely a distance to be covereda separationPersonalityoras some authorities have itIndividuality is the greatest asset of the AmateurAn artist is like everybody in the worldThe book we readthe picture we see or the music we hear which renders tangible our own dimly felt thoughts and emotional stirrings shows that we are in reality one with the artist and with the universe of which these expressions are but reflections of unseen and unheard forcesAn artist combines the power and responsibilities of the aristocrat with the feelings of an anarchisthe is the guardian of privilege and the destroyer of authoritythe leveler of barriers and the creator of the supermanthe leader and the servant of humanity and the Arch Enemy of the AmateurThe artist is like all humanitybut the Amateur is not like the ArtistThe Amateur must hang on for dear life to his precious soul and resist to the last gasp the incursions of any outside force in which he can trace the semblance of his own naturefor if anything gets in something may get out and he won t be able to sort himself out afterwardsHence the Amateur must be an Individualist otherwise he is doomed to extinctionThe Amateur s business is to interpret the universe in terms eternally incomprehensible to anyone but himselfand to compromise with the necessity for intercourse with his fellow creatures by the adoption of an artificial language which can convey thoughts and feelings of a superficial characterbut nothing moretale that points a moralthe picture that suggests a taleand the music that evokes a picturethese are the vehicles forpersonalityand your fine amateur must cultivate the pride that the realization of an exclusive understanding of these things givesIf Hamlet had been an amateur instead of being an artist he would never have suggested that a cloud was like a camela weaselor a whalehe would have pointed out its resemblance to a mathematical calculation or a treatise on political economyand Polonius would have been far more impressed for this would have shown Great IndividualityThe Mission of Amateurism true Amateur must learn the value of successthe immense importance of achievementthe inward meaning of gratified self conceitPraise from small minds represents the highest possible attainment of accomplished AmateurismThe object of Amateurishness islike the puzzle pictures in the daily papersto present apretty little problem with a perfectly simple and obvious solutionthus giving effortless pleasure and satisfaction to all concernedopportunities

on a trainThe car was crowdedand I took the seat beside herThere was a man in the offingwho belonged with hera slendergirlish figure of a manin a heavy brown canvas coat such as teamsters wear in the winterHe moved up and down in the aisle of the carwanting my place by the woman s sidebut I did not know that at the timeThe woman had a heavy face and a thick noseSomething had happened to herShe had been struck a blow or had a fallNature could never have made a nose so broad and thick and uglyShe talked to me in very good EnglishI suspect now that she was temporarily weary of the man in the brown canvas coatthat she had travelled with him for daysperhaps weeksand was glad of the chance to spend a few hours in the company of some one elseEveryone knows the feeling of a crowded train in the middle of the nightWe ran along through western Iowa and eastern NebraskaIt had rained for days and the fields were floodedIn the clear night the moon came out and the scene outside the car window was strange and in an odd way very beautifulYou get the feelingthe black bare trees standing up in clusters as they do out in that countrythe pools of water with the moon reflected and running quickly as it does when the train hurries alongthe rattle of the car trucksthe lights in isolated farmhousesand occasionally the clustered lights of a town as the train rushed through it into the westThe woman had just come out of war ridden Polandhad got out of that stricken land with her husband by God knows what miracles of effortShe made me feel the warthat woman didand she told me the tale that I want to tell to youI don t remember the beginning of our talknor can I tell you of how the strangeness of my mood grew to match her mooduntil the story she told became a part of the mystery of the still night outside the car window and very pregnant with meaning to meThere was a company of Polish refugees moving along a road in Poland in charge of a GermanThe German was a man of perhaps fiftywith a beardAs I got himhe was much such a man as might be professor of foreign languages in a college in our countrysay at Des MoinesIowaor SpringfieldOhioHe would be sturdy and strong of body and given to the eating of rather rank foodsas such men areAlso he would be a fellow of books and in his thinking inclined toward the ranker philosophiesHe was dragged into the war because he was a Germanand had steeped his soul in the German philosophy of mightFaintlyI fancythere was another notion in his head that kept bothering himand so to serve his government with a whole heart he read books that would reestablish his feeling for the strongterrible thing for which he foughtBecause he was past fifty he was not on the battle linebut was in charge of the refugeestaking them out of their destroyed village to a camp near a railroad where they could be fedThe refugees were peasantsall except the woman in the American train with me and her motheran old woman of sixty fiveThey had been small land owners and the others in their party were women who had worked on their estateThen there was the one manmy companion s loverweak in body and with bad eyesAlong a country road in Poland went this party in charge of the Germanwho tramped heavily alongurging them forwardHe was brutal in his insistenceand the old woman of sixty fivewho was a kind of leader of the refugeeswas almost equally brutal in her constant refusal to go forwardIn the rainy night she stopped in the muddy road and her party gathered about herLike a stubborn old horse she shook her head and muttered Polish words I want to be let alonethat s what I wantAll I want in the world is to be let alone she saidover and overand then the German came upand putting his hand on her back pushed her alongso that their progress through the dismal night was a constant repetition of the stoppingher muttered wordsand his pushingThey hated each other with whole hearted hatredthat old Polish woman and the Germanparty came to a clump of trees on the bank of a shallow streamThe German took hold of the old woman s arm and dragged her through the stream while the others followedOver and over she said the wordsI want to be let aloneAll I want in the world is to be let alone the clump of trees the German started a fireWith incredible efficiency he had it blazing high in a few minutestaking the matches and even some bits of dry wood from a little rubber lined pouch carried in his inside coat pocketThen he got out tobaccoandsitting down on the protruding root of a treesmokedand stared at the refugeesclustered about the old woman on the opposite side of the fireGerman went to sleepThat was what started his troubleHe slept for an hourand when he awoke the refugees were goneYou can imagine him jumping up and tramping heavily back through the shallow stream and along the muddy road to gather his party together againHe would be angry through and throughbut he would not be alarmedIt was only a matterhe knewof going far enough back along the roadas one goes back along a road for strayed cattlethenwhen the German came up to the partyhe and the old woman began to fightShe stopped muttering the words about being let alone and sprang at himOne of her old hands gripped his beard and the other buried itself in the thick skin of his neckstruggle in the road lasted a long timeThe German was tired and not as strong as he lookedand there was that faint thing in him that kept him from hitting the old woman with his fistHe took hold of her thin shoulders and pushedand she pulledThe struggle was like a man trying to lift himself by his boot strapsThe two fought and were full of the determination that will not stop fightingbut they were not very strong physicallyso their two souls began to struggleThe woman in the train made me understand that quite clearlyalthough it may be difficult to get the sense of it over to youI had the night and the mystery of the moving train to help meIt was a physical thingthe fight of the two souls in the dim light of the rainy night on that deserted muddy roadThe air was full of the struggleand the refugees gathered about and stood shiveringThey shivered with cold and wearinessof coursebut also with something elseIn the aireverywhere about themthey could feel the vague something going onThe woman said that she would gladly have given her life to have it stoppedor to have some one strike a lightand that her man felt the same wayIt was like two winds strugglingshe saidlike a soft yielding cloud become hard and trying vainly to push another cloud out of the skythe struggle ended and the old woman and the German fell down exhausted in the roadThe refugees gathered about and waitedThey thought something more was going to happenknew in fact something more would happenThe feeling they had persistedyou seeand they huddled together and perhaps whimpered a littlehappened is the whole point of the storyThe woman in the train explained it very clearlyShe said that the two soulsafter strugglingwent back into the two bodiesbut that the soul of the old woman went into the body of the German and the soul of the German into the body of the old womanthatof courseeverything was quite simpleThe German sat down by the road and began shaking his head and saying he wanted to be let alonedeclared that all he wanted in the world was to be let aloneand the Polish woman took papers out of his pocket and began driving her companions back along the roaddriving them harshly and brutally alongand when they grew weary pushing them with her handswas more of the story after thatThe woman s loverwho had been a school teachertook the papers and got out of the countrytaking his sweetheart with himBut my mind has forgotten the detailsI only remember the German sitting by the road and muttering that he wanted to be let aloneand the old tired mother in Poland saying the harsh words and forcing her weary companions to march through the night back into

Arthur Symons thinks he was a unique geniusNietzsche regarded him as the great corrupter of music he has made music sick Symons says that to find a parallel for Wagner s achievement we must look back to the Greeksto the age of Aeschylus and SophoclesEach one proved his pointIt s a bit confusingand you begin to wonder what Art isyou ever found a definition of aesthetic values that will hold through the whole art miracleI never have and never expect toEven in Pater s The School of Giorgione you are merely told that since all art constantly aspires toward the condition of musictoward that perfect identification of matter and formthe chief function of aesthetic criticism is to estimate the degree in which all the arts approach to musical lawBut musical law is constantly changingand the criterion of the degree to which matter and form become identical will be a sort of sliding scaleAnd what every one wants to know is how to gauge that scaleCan you think of a single art judgment in the whole realm of aesthetics that you can use as an infallible touchstonewith which you can make a mediocre poet realize why his work is bad instead of goodYou can make him realizeby the desperate wildness with which you shriekIt s not well done that something is wrongbut to save your life you can t convince him that you are talking about anything except your own instinct as you aren tand of course he feels that his instinct may be just as good as yours which of course it can t Suppose you choose one of the best definitions ever thought ofMérimée sall art is exaggeration à propos you find that you re just as badly off as before by what standard is the à propos measuredwas in this frame of mind that I heard Leo Ornstein s musicFirst he came one night and played for us aloneon our Mason and Hamlinin a half light and an atmosphere of intense excitementNone of us had decided beforehand that we should want to laugh or hiss or throw things at himas they did in London two years agoWe expected something beautiful and we got itHe played his Impressions of the Thameswhich he afterward described as a river oftowers and turrets and starsof dark rushing waterof bridges and buildingsof desolate muddy banksand then somethng which you cannot bear to look at any longer I can tseemusicso I only know that it was sound which interested and pleased and shook meThen he played his Funeral Marchwhich had something dark and vast in itthen some Ravelthe music of which interested me more than his playing of it and finally the Schumann Arabesquewhich he did so beautifully that I thoughtHere is a man who plays just as he wants toand probably comes nearer to what Schumann would have liked than all the strict interpreters with their flawlesstastehave done It seemed to me that Ornstein did what he did with it stretched its slenderness to a lovelier curve in the interest of the piano and that is the very best thing anyone can do with written music for the pianoeven if the pedagogues can t beat time to itat the end I was beginning to think perhaps this is the man who is to bring to the piano that something it still needsthe next morningat his recitalI made an interesting discoveryOrnstein has brought nothing to the pianoHe has brought something to the world of music compositions which show that the piano music is more pliable than we had thoughtand interpretations which show an exaggeration à proposTo the pianoas an instrumenthe has brought what all the others have brought virtuosity and in this case a not exceptional virtuosityThis may sound like hair splittingbut it really is nothas done this he has written some very interesting musicand he plays it as most composers of talent perhaps of genius would play their things if they had studied the piano as thoroughly as heWhat is there in this to cause hystericsThe fact that it sounds different from the music you have been hearingBut that would seem to be a reason for interestnot merely for mirthThis reaction belongs in the same plane with patriotism and duty you laugh at what is strangeyou love what is familiaryou obey what has been tested the three ready made emotionswith which you can escape most effectively from art and lifeSo they howled at OrnsteinTwo respectable women sitting near mewho would not have dared what do I saywho would not have been able to laugh at a minister s treatise on good and evil or a president s speech on loyalty to a flagwere so convulsed over Ornstein s Impressions of the Thames that they moved their seats to the rear of the theatre where they could not be watchedwhere they could merely disturb the pianist by their audible snortingsThe critics have done the same thing laughed at Ornstein s own music and criticised scathingly his manner of playing familiar musicOrnstein s interestI am sureis chiefly in what he has to sayand second in the way he says itHe is a composer virtuosoI had hoped he would be a piano loverThat is the kind of artist I am looking for with more interest than I have for anything else in this worldfor Ornstein himselfI think he is a sincere person who means to go on doing his workI sometimes judge the sensitiveness of a nature by the intensity of expression that moves across the cheek bonesYou might look carefully at Ornstein s face instead of judging him by the fact that his hair falls into his eyes when he playsOf course he has been indiscreet enough to mention that he does not like BeethovenWhy that is unforgivable I can t imagineA man may surely like what he pleasesThe high genius of a Mozart or a Haydn is a thing he feels intenselyHe admires Chopin deeply as an artist who could do one thing very well and was content to let it go at thatGrieg he thinks is not a worthy mouthpiece for all that Norway has to give a musicianHe loves Debussybut thinks that Ravel is the greater manDebussy stands beside a pond and tells you beautifully of all he sees thereRavel plunges into the pond and gives you the life of it Stravinsky and Scriabine are the two he cares for mostas I remember Schönberg has worked out his theory before he has worked out his art Something of that sort might apply to Ornstein himselfas in the case of his Chopin Nocturne in Flat I disliked hisexaggerationin it as much as anything I have ever heard on a pianodoes no one realize what the unique beauty of a piano isand that there are secrets of sound in it which have not yet been touched upon the French of Paul VerlaineSHANAFELT soul is like a lovely garden place Where masque and bergamasque move graciouslyPlaying the lute and

traps on the earth Where human beings are put to die By other human beingsThey die hour after houra million million timesAnd still face deathThere is blue air between the clouds and the earth Which

open Some extracts from letters written during her fifteen day sentence appear on the next pagefrom Prison GOLDMAN County JailLong Island CityNew YorkApril1916WHAT am I doingI am watching human miseryThere is no misery so appalling as imprisoned miseryIt is so helplessso humiliatedI think the prisoners do love meat least those who have been thrown in with meIt is so easy to get their loveThe least bit of kindness moves them they are so appreciativeBut what can one do for them you remember that passage from Galsworthy s Justice in which some one says to FalderNo one wishes you harmTherein lies the pathosNo one wishes these social victims harmThe Warden and Matron here are exceptionally kindAnd yet the harmthe irreparable harmis done by the very fact that human beings are locked uprobbed of their identitytheir self respecttheir self hoodI am not sorry I was sentencedIn fact I am gladI needed to get to these pariahs who are the butt of all the horrorsIt would be well if every rebel were sent to prison for a time it would fan his smouldering flame of hate of the things that make prisons possibleI am really gladWe are awakened at six and unlocked at seven in the morningThen comes breakfastof which I have so far eaten only oatmeal with what pretends to be milkThe coffee or tea I have not managed to get downAt seven thirty we are taken out into the yardI walk up and down like one possessedto get the exerciseAt eight thirty we are backand the women keep themselves busy scribblingbut my girls will not let me do thatI must talk to them The Wardenby the wayis reading my Anarchismand the Matron my Social Significance of the Modern Drama In factI seem to have more devotion here than on the outsideAt eleven we have dinnerand at four in the afternoon supper which I will describe to you when I come outThen we are locked up until seven Mfifteen hoursthe hardest of all to bearDo you remember the line in The Ballad of Reading GaolEach day a year whose days grow old To me it iseach night a year whose nights grow long I have always loved the nightbut jailed nights are ghastly thingslights are on until nine PM and we can read and write all daywhich is a god sendAlso this prison is one of the cleanest in the countryWhat on earth have I done that people should go into such ecstasiesNo one raves because you breathewhy rave if you take a determined stand when that means the very breath of life to youReally I feel embarrassed with all the love and devotion and adulation for so little a thingso infinitesimal compared with the truly heroic deeds of the great soulsMy only consolation is that the fight is not at an end and that I may yet be called upon to do something really greatBut for the present it is hardly worth the fussis Sunday and we were taken out to the yard for a walkIt was a glorious daymarred only by the monotony of the stripes and the spiritless slouching figuresYet the sky excluded no one its glorious blue spread over them allas if there were no sorrows in all the world and man was never cruel to his kinddays pass quickly between the study of my fellow prisonersmy lettersand other writingThe evenings are taken up with readingBut jailed nights are so oppressiveThey lie like stone upon your heartThe thoughtsthe sobsthe moans that emerge like pale shadows from every human soulIt is stiflingYet people talk of hellThere is no more threatening

everything else There you have itthe whole troubleThere is no consciousness of artno consciousness that art is beyond all these thingsthat it is as the sun to the earthand if it were to fail us we should grow like potatoes in a deep cellarIt is only when art students say This is not what we soughtWhere shall we gowhat shall we lovewhat doto find what we sought that the Art Institute is brought into itand then only to serve as an example of the lack of art consciousness everywhereand to emphasize the fact that the artist has no place in this land of wasteful virtuesAn artist almost disgraces the family into which he is bornhe is pitied a little by outsidershe is left aloneAt lastwhen he can stand it no longerhe breaks the parent heartand goes out full of high hope to find his own kind and to keep his own faithAfter a short time he finds the art school very much like a factory he learns to do his piecewhen he had thought to create a new beautyand he findstoothat he is still an outcast for his beliefs and desiresMore than ninety nine percent of the students who study art never qualify as artistsWe are all born into the world creatorsIn the interval some wander into by pathsplay nicely upon the piano or violindo artor write poetryMaiden aunts and fond grandmas proclaim them geniusesall the time praying that they do not become artistsWhen love comesthey leave the by paths to fall into lock step on the old worn wayIt is not what is accomplished on these journeys along the outposts of artbut it is the experience that countsIf they have met there one or two who stirred their senses with the impression of bearing afragile and mighty thing who could rise above the earth and shout in a flame light of joyor fall upon the earth and moan with the dark trouble of Thingsif they have caught from these a quickened sense of Lifeand learned a broader observation and consciousness of beautyeven though they cannot create as the artist creates still from this experience they should feel the power to create a new life for those whom they in their turn may meetIf they would so much as teach the childrennot the old formidableFear God and keep his commandments but ratherFind in every foolish little thing that lives but a day Eternal Beauty wandering on its waywe should grow a race with a deep desire for thefreeunsullied things which never fail and never can decay The Artist knows as surely as though he walked with God upon those six days of creation that this He made and nothing more but here He made allOther men fill in the gap between what they are and what they feel they could bewhat they long for and cannot findwhat they attain and aspire towith ReligionThenwalled in with the belief of finding completion in a future lifethey live on unconscious of the passionate splendor and ecstasy of this lifeThe artistrealizing that here we must live our life and our immortalitycries out to men to know allto feel allto be all hereand he strives with his whole soulgives up his life to show men what he has seenBut the turning of great wheelsthe blasts of furnacesand the straining of millions of human beings that a few may be comfortabledrown his voiceAnd because he does not take part in this great struggle for physical contentmentdoes not live the crampeddwarfed life of societythere is no place for him in modern lifeEven though the wisest seem deceivedstill the artist must believe that a consciousness of Art will comeand that even the most stupid will sometime know that he must have Art before breadknow for I have experienced it and perhaps experienced

month they gather together at a handsome club to talk and be talked toOnce a year they foregather at a grand hotel for a handsome dinner and some more talkam inquisitiveGod help meHe and good training have made me soTo gratify my curiosity concerning the makers of American poetryI asked Master Witter Bynnerone of their bandto take me to their monthly meeting at the National Arts ClubI ache still from suppressed laughter Dear sense of humorwhat would I do without you when I visit the habitations of the pretentious and the congregation of the hum bugsIt is the custom of this body of of the word I want will come to me laterIt is their customI sayto ask for unpublished verse to be read aloud to the assemblageThe reader of the evening was Witter BynnerNow Mr Bynner is a poet with a finevibrant voice and a rare appreciation for pause and effectbut when he read the verse of those anonymous poets such feeling did he put into them that his legs quivered and showed great emotionThat distressed and distracted meAfter each poem was read it was criticized by the audienceCriticism of a certain type is the easiest thing in the worldThat typethat pettyemptywordy typewas present in all its gloryIts chief exponent was one Shaemas O Sheela wordy fellow loving the sound of his own voice and giving vent to many empty phrases with much gusto and argumentative fervorMr O Sheel once wrote and

youth named Joyce KilmerPerhaps you have heard of himHe is the author of charming conceitsin verseon trees and delicatessen storesHe has also written some sweet roundels and balladesIncidentally he is a member of the staff of The New York TimesOccasionally he makes excursions to Women s Clubs and other intellectual organizations to tell them all he knows about poetryGod save himAnd God save me from ever hearing another night of such criticism from ponderous youths and knowing old maidsAfter the reading of the poemsand the stupid remarks that followed the readingthere came what was called thesocial intermission During this time insipid punch and silly little biscuits were served to as many of the mob as could grab themand a noise as of a host of parrots in a small place filled the room Curious what bad punch will do to goodrespectable people Following the excitement of the jabber and the near wine the audience settled down to be sobered up by the reading of two seeming epics by Cale Young RiceMr Rice is dull ohvery dull he isNot only sobut his verse is I won t sayand he reads it with the voice of the spirit of a one time virtuous Methodist minister chanting a prayer in the coolest part of HellSo he read his dreary interminable poemsSo I had visions of all the precious Sundays my Presbyterian parents had forced me to wasteThat vision passed and I still heard the whining droneBack to my mind again where I had vicious thoughts of the tortures I would like to play upon bad poets who write bad verse and read it with bad accent and bad voice to good harmless peopleBy the time I had thought out and perfected a most amazing and subtle form of torture for such disturbers of human happinessthe dismal noise had stoppedSome day After the effort of the Rice manLaurence Houseman read some of his fanciful poemsThey were welcomeA Spring wind among the reeds after a prolonged dull thawPoetry flourishes in AmericaThe poets are paid well by the Magazines and strange women

thrilled and moved when we heard the beauty of his playing of the symphony of HamletOn SaturdayApril 22I watchednow from the wingsnow from a side boxthe last public performance of this artist s HamletOh that I could write as well as I feel that my words had the strength and the bursting keenness of my emotionsThen might I tell somethingHave you seen the sudden brilliant leap of a flame sometimes before it finally goes outThere was the same sort of spurt in that past performanceI had seen Robertson play Hamlet a year agoin Brooklyn a week before I had watched him wearily play his partand by the comparison I understood the effort involved in the brilliancy of his playing that dayThere was a heart bursting poignancy about his swan songI cried with the QueenOh Hamletthou hast cleft my heart in twainAnd when at the end of it all he sat there on the throne of Denmark with that unforgettable lookpurged from all the suffering and wearinessand when they bore him off to the

Prints shadow flowers On the stiffness of an amber screenMy dream is like thatAn amber scheme Straining through coldstiff screensImagist Poets GOULD FLETCHER question is being askedre asked and debatedWhat is ImagismThe fact that this question is constantly raised anew proves that it is not an academic oneFor if we are to see clearly the underlying principles of the new poetryand to understand the relationship of the group which call themselves the Imagists to those principleswe must first disassociate Imagismstrictly speakingfrom all that body of verse now being produced in the free verse formsAs a critic not long ago pointed outvers libre and Imagism are not to be confusedVers libre can be produced and has been produced which is not Imagisticbut realisticsymbolisticor merely dullImagism is an attitude of mind which can appear just as well under the guise of metre and rhymeor proseas in verse itselfWhatthenis ImagismBrieflythe doctrine we call Imagism has four cardinal points or principlesThe first of these concerns presentation of the subjectThe Imagist aims to present his subject as an imagethat is to sayhe presents the sum total of the emotions in any given subject in such a way that the reader experiences the self same emotions from themTo do this it is necessary for the Imagist to regard his subject matter from its most imaginative aspectand to present it visuallyFor the readernot having experienced the emotion which moved the author to create his poemis incapable of grasping that emotion save through a direct and complete appeal to his imagination through his higher senses of sight and hearingBy stimulating these sensesthrough appropriate choice of wordsthe Imagist aims to arouse the reader to such a pitch that the reader re creates imaginatively for himself the emotional complex which gave birth to the poemImagism isthereforefirst of all a means of arousing the emotions through the imaginationThe Imagists must therefore be sharply distinguished from the realistic schooland also from the symbolists of the nineteenth centuryfrom which latter they havein some sensederivedThrough the constant insistence on emotion as the underlying essence of poetrythe Imagists approach closely to the Elizabethans of the sixteenth and the early romantics of the nineteenth centuryThe second principle of Imagism concerns styleThe Imagists desire to accomplish that renovation of the English language which is always periodically necessary if good poetry is to continue to be created in itThe Imagists have certain prejudices against inversionsclichésjournalesehighfalutin bombastliterary jargonmessy padding with adjectivesEach word must be an exact wordthat is to say the sole word necessary for its particular place and purpose in the poemThis careful consideration for style relates the Imagists to the classicists of the eighteenth centurywho undoubtedly rescued the English language from the absurdities of themetaphysicalschoolThe Imagists also insist on it as a useful check to too great an exuberance of imaginationThe third principle of Imagism concerns formThe rhythmical form of the poem should not be a mere empty patternbut should followas far as possiblethe ebb and flow of the emotion throughout the poemIt should be an integral part of the poem itselfas indissoluble from it as the substance of the words themselvesTherefore the Imagists hold that the theory and practice of vers libre is necessaryalthough they do not go so far as to demand it in every caseor to say that rhyme and metre have not their usesIn their desire to create a full emotional range of rhythmical nuancesinclusive of both rhyme and metre as well as freer rhythmical figuresthe Imagists derive direct from the first great romantic poets of England Blake and ColeridgeThe last principle of Imagism concerns the attitude of the artist to lifeThe artist should realize that if he is not to be the slave of life he must not attempt to be its judgeHe must not obtrude his petty personal judgments and vanities between the reader and the subject he writes aboutHe must notin shortmoralise about lifeor gush over itor make others feel anything else except what he has felt about itIn this respect the Imagist poets are in very firm reaction against the sentimental and pious optimism of the mid nineteenth centuryagainst the equally sentimental and fallacious aestheticism of the eighties and ninetiesand it may be addedagainst a good deal of the wishy washy suggestiveness and sex obsession that seems to be getting the upper hand of so many writers of todayThe Imagist does not weight the balanceeither formoralityorimmoralityhe statesand lets the reader draw his own conclusionWith these four principles in mindwe may now ask ourselves how the Imagists have carried them into practiceFor practice isafter allthe supreme test of any theory of artThere are signs that Imagism is getting itself taken more seriouslynot as a mere passing fadbut as something that has at least established certain guide posts and land marks for future poetswho wish to renew the traditions of good writingI maintain that it has done moreIt has permitted three poetsat leastto start from the same principles and to produce among them a very respectable body of poetrywhich in each case is filled with the individual flavour of the personality who wrote itThat the Imagist principles should display such applicability and elasticity isI maintainvery remarkableWe shall now see who these three poets areRichard Aldingtonthe first of the three to be consideredhas recently brought together some thirty of his poems in a small volumeentitled ImagesThat this selection does not represent all of Mr Aldington s workmust be apparent to all who are familiar with itHis long poemChildhoodis not here nor is his other long poem on the warwhich surely deserves mention as being one of the few really humorous war poems ever writtenTo come to the shorter piecessurely all admirers of Mr Aldington s talent must deplore the absence of DaisyRound Pond and The Poplar the latter one of the most beautiful poems he has ever writtenBut whether Mr Aldington has omitted these pieces from a too severe critical judgmentor whether because they seem to interfere with the unity of his bookthe fact remains that they were omittedbut that enough is left to give nearly all sides of his achievementAldington is a sophisticateda cultivatedeven a bookish poetHe has translated Anyte of Tegeathe Latin Poets of the Renaissanceand even that astounding farrago of poetry and buffoonery called Les Chansons de MaldororRecently he has given usin the columns of The Egoista glimpse at his library which ranges from Euripidesvia ApuleiusHooker and Crowleyto Ford Madox Hueffer And is it for this I have laboured he cries To be the object of derision of some bibliophile looking at his books as cynically and disgustedly as I look at mine it is not for thisIt is for a handful of strange and satisfying poems that Mr Aldington has labouredEvery artist knows that it takes a great deal of lifean immense amount of experience and appreciationto make even a little artLife is like a many faceted prismWe must walk around itobserve it on every sidesee it not as we ourselves would care to see itbut as others have seen itbefore we can induce it to show a new side to our effortsto cast a few rays which it has not already cast beforeMatthew Arnoldwho was one of the few English critics able to look at literature from the standpoint of its historical developmentdeclared that poetry was a criticism of lifeAnd so it isThe task of a modern poet is not to shut his eyes to the pastbut to see the work of the generations that preceded him as an uncompleted structurethe living intention of whose builders is again born in himand seeks fruition in the additions he can make to itIn this sense Mr Aldington is a modern poetHe is a poet for the well readintelligentcultivated man or womanfirst poem of his I can remember seeing in print was the one entitled ChoricosThe ancient songs Pass deathward mournfullylips that sing no moreand withered wreaths Regretful eyesand drooping breasts and wingsof ancient songsMournfully passing Down to the great white surges Watched by nonewe turn from the Kyprian s breastsAnd we turn from theePhoibos ApollonAnd we turn from the fiery dayAnd the lips that were over sweetFor silentlyBrushing the fields with red shod feetWith purple robeSearing the grass as with a sudden flameDeathhast come upon usDeathThou art the silence of beautyAnd we look no more for the morningWe yearn no more for the sunWe kneel before theeAnd thouleaning towards usCaressingly layest upon us Flowers from thy thin cold handsAnd smiling as a chaste womanKnowing love in her heartThou seelest our eyes And the illimitable quitetude Comes gently upon usis nothing in all the literature I know which can be safely set beside this poemof which I have only quoted a few fragmentsexcept a few lines of Leopardi teMortesi pose Nostra ignuda natura antico dolorthan thatit is uniqueAnd since it is the fashion to despise a poet because he does not write of aeroplanes and locomotives and socialismbut of the eternal verities of lifedeathbeautyironylet us first of all brush away the shallow assumption that Mr Aldington is an imitator of the classics and that all his work seems a derivation from the Greekmood of the poem from which I have just quoted is not a mood which can be found in any Greek poetor which any Greek would ever have understoodI have quoted enough to show what that mood isIt is a mood of mutabilityof the sadness that arises in us when we see the instability of all earthly thingsThe first Occidental poet who ever expressed this moodto my knowledgewas François VillonIn the Eastof courseit was felt and expressed much earlierFor one must have seen kingdoms pass away and empires crumble to the dust andthe owl sing his watch song from the towers of Afrasiabbefore one can feel this moodwhich Mr Aldington has here so beautifully and poignantly expressedhis poetry Mr Aldington has frequently given us this emotion of a civilized mana modernbrought face to face with some beautiful fragment of the pastThus he cries to a Greek marble am thy brotherThy lover of aforetime crying to theeAnd thou hearest me notno one would contend that a Greek could ever have said this And in some quite recent poems we have the same feeling applied to the Renaissanceand even to modernity turn the page and read I dream of silent verses where the rhyme Glides noiseless as an oar heavymusty airthe black desksThe bent heads and the rustling noises VanishThe sun hangs in the cobalt sky The boat drifts over the

tormentedObsessedAlong all this beautyWith a vision of ruinsOf walls tumbling into claya poet is not what we vulgarly choose to call an optimistNoLet us admit once for allMr Aldington is a pessimist Soby the waywere Sophocles and Leopardi and Shakespeare when he wrote King Learand Mr Thomas Hardyto mention only a few but I have never heard they were worse poets for it At times he gives us a very bitter dose indeed to swallowas in his ChildhoodCinema Exitor In the TubeYet he is not devoid of humourplayful and fantasticWitness The Faun Sees Snow for the First Timethe Interludethe Eveninga beautiful grotesque which I am tempted to quote or for a grimmer note the conclusion of LesbiaHe will not admit that life is altogether without compensationsHerein he is honestHe even admits sentiment

get in the other stories a glimpse of the mystic Gogolthe poet of Goyaesque witches and devilsDo not read Viy before bed time lest you go through a heavy nightmareIt is an enormous leap from Gogol to Korolenko2Gorky3and Kuprin4These are living authorsalthough they belong rather to the Little Review 37 past century in their motives and modesVladimir Korolenko is a writer whose very name causes the heart of every Russian to beat with emotionNot for the greatness of his artas an artist he ranks among the lesserIt is the charm of his personality that places him far above all his colleaguesHis long years of exile in Siberiahis never flagging championship of the oppressed classes and raceshis tireless encouragement of the young beginnersand his smilethe deepbroad smile that Mows like a sunny stream through his writingshave endeared him to his countrymen beyond parallelKorolenko is the bridge between the heroicidealistic seventies and the ultra individualistic modernsHis stories are not idyllsyet they smile he deals with tragediesdescribes horrifying situationsbut he bears no ill feeling for the universehe loves it with all its evils and folliesloves it with that keen understanding which spells forgivenessGorky tells us that he owes to Korolenko not only his discovery and introduction to the publicbut also his styleI seldom trust an author s self criticismGorky differs from his alleged teacher in his style as well as in his philosophyKorolenko is gentlemildrefinedlovingforgivingGorky is rudeloudhatingrevengingBoth have known misery and hardshipsboth have rubbed shoulders with the humiliated and down troddenBut came out of the crucible with a radiant smilewith universal compassion and sympathyGorky neither forgets or forgivesHis body and soul shriek out vengeance for

and scorns the weak wormsthe lazy adders who are content to stagnate in the mireGorky s philosophy may appeal to us who have drunk from the waters of Zarathustrabut Korolenko s art is purerfree from

magic attraction and powerHer golden smiles and soft pillows have failed lately to captivate and holdThere is a new breed of young artistsThey seem to be an energetic lotand decline to live in the future of promises andwhat is more horriblethey decline to flirt with the rich aunt through the aid of the honorable societyFor many years she was the bubbling liquid within the life giving bottleThe magic corkscrew was in the safethe combination known to the initiated fewAccording to these fewyoung artists had to go through a certain process of taming and self effacement before they were gradually given the secretA certain amount of artistic ignorance plus an ability to pull strings was required of every aspirantA soft backbone bent by many kicks was also one of the main requirements Don t knockyou ll break the magic bottlewas their watchwordIf you dared to ask questions concerning the sacred duty of the initiated fewyou aroused a hatred that took years to melta hatred that seemed impossible in such delicate soulsThe few artists who refused to be tamed left the city and have settled in other partsAnd the philanthropic auntlike all true philanthropistsacquired all she could get and paid the minimum priceThe paying was usually accompanied by a lot of pompous actions and was supposed to be received like a first class iron cross by a common soldierYou seethe young talented artist was actually compelled to bribe the art patron to get to the secret of the combinationand was compelled to listen to all kinds of insults besidesHere are a favorite fewI have discovered him I helped him to get where he is nowIf it were not for meThe artist was also used as a rare orchid at their dinner tables and as Chinese embroidery at unusual occasionsI know one of these patrons who even resorted to threatswhen a young and independent sculptor refused to bediscovered And such creatures pose as art patrons and connoisseursand hold the combination to the life giving bottle of this cityAs a matter of factalmost all the prestige and almost all the artistic knowledge possessed by these same patrons was given them by their so called protegees at starvation pricesHoweverthe patrons are hardly to be blamed for this state of affairsThey were made by well meaning but mediocre artists whose highest ambitions were foggy imitations of a certain kind of realism practiced abroad when my grandmother s dolls used up most of her timeThe saddest or funniest side of this spectacle is that the patrons havefor the last few yearsadvanced in understanding beyond the possibilities of the artists who have made themAs you can easily seea most discouraging and impossible state of affairsIt reached its climax at the last Chicago Artistsexhibitionwhen those in controlto use a popular sayingrubbed it inIt was a show of the aged and crippledand prizes were awarded on the basis of an Old Age BenefitIt was a slow sickness and positive in retarding all artistic endeavor in this cityBut like a clear and promising path in this dark jungle comes the first International Exhibition of Independent ArtistsIt is a jury free exhibitionand every man is allowed to hang two paintingsprovided he pays for the spaceAnd it was a strong indictment against the old orderIt showed how thoroughly it has managed to kill all originality and individuality in the younger artistsIn spite of the fact that it was a jury free exhibition you could easily see that almost everyone had painted with this little thought in the back of his head This must please MessrsAl brightJuergensand CompanyTo pick out the few who made a good showing this time would be unfair to the restThe whole show was conceived and arranged in six weeksand to me it was more interesting and held more promise than any other show held in this cityIt is a young oak whose knotty brancheslike playful fistsshoot in unexpected directionsIt grows up near a grey solemn mausoleumThe mausoleum acts as if it does not notice the sturdy youngsterbut it knows in its heartif it has onethat it will soon be hidden in the shadow of this tree s branchesVirile roots will crack the walls and decay will be the deserved fate Little Review 41 Reader Critic IS NO FRIEND OF OURSDavison FickeDavenportIowayou be so kind as to ask your friend Virginia York to refrain from re misprinting for a third timea bit hacked from my Café SketchesIf she finds the poem so interestingwhy does she not print it in its entiretyand correctlyThen perhaps her readers could decide just where the joke lies in the light ofVirginia York sOlympian pronouncement thatmaybe you think this is funnybut certainly it is not intended to be Just because a little learning would be dangerous for herI shall never disclose to her what the poem was intended to beBesidesshe wouldn t believe mefor hera thing has to be either Lear or Charley s Auntevidentlyhave harbored doubts as to the value of vers librebut now they are goneFor I see that it does shut out a

legs and bite the starsTell him to write arrogantly of thischarmingworld he seesIt s time enough to be humble when one is oldPROPHET IN HIS OWN COUNTRYand Michael CarrColumbiaMissourihave been greatly enraged by reading Mr Charles Zwaska s articleAn Isaiah without a Christin the April number of TH E LITTLE REVIEWIt reminds us of a review of the same book in JudgeIt ran something like this Vachel Lindsey has out a new book on the Art of the Moving PictureIt might be all rightbut for the fact that the movie can never be Art In just the same sententious way Mr Zwaska seems to be peeved that Lindsay should suggest the possibility of art in a thing which is at present clumsily doneSome one has said that when Miriam led the women of Israel to a dance of rejoicingall of the women who were too fat or too stiff to dance stood back and deplored the immodesty of their nimble sistersPerhaps Mr Zwaska is too fator too stiffor too oldI don t knowmay be he is so young that he still creeps and doesn t think of dancingFor Lindsay has sung out humanly and delightfully a more acceptable ideal of democracy than any American has yet sungThe rest of us would be artists are creating things that can appeal to a small numberLindsay is chanting to all Americaand all America is listening wethe artistsas well as the littlest country school boythe swift black horse To the swift white horseThere goes the alarm There goes the alarmThey are hitchedthey are offThey are gone in a flashAnd they strain at the driver s iron arm shout it when the fire engines fly down the streetWe croon the moon poems together in the eveningsand we chant The Santa Fé Trail as we tramp across countryZwaska seems to catch a glimmering of the fact that Lindsay is a rhyming poetbecause he is singing to all the peopleWhy does he not apply this a little fartherLindsay s messageas I catch itis thisMoving Picture has in it possibilities of a great artFurthermoreit is for all Americafor every farm boyfor every little dish washer as well as for every millionaireLet us make this art as perfectas inspiringas possiblesince it has a wider influencebe it goodbador indifferentthan any other art in the history of humanityThe exquisite ParthenonSophocles s tragedies performed in the theater of Dionysuswere for the Atheniansand for such as could reach AthensFortunatelythat included a large percentage of the GreeksBut how many Americansproportionatelycan see such wonders as New York has to offera moving picture as perfect as the Parthenon has been produced there need be no soul in America who has not seen itbeing the idealwe proceed toward its realizationLindsay points out some means of attaining beauty in the moving picturesThe producers canhe sayslearn from the painters beauties of compositionof symbolismof moodBeautiful sculpture can teach the rhythmthe speedthe grace of motionAnd architecture will help to interpret big social emotionssuch as patriotism and religion in terms of crowdspageantlikeof landscapesandupon occasionof architecture itselfhere Mr Zwaska objectsHe says that Lindsay is making the moving picture a parasite on the other artsI am not going to quote Noah Websteror Dr Johnsonbut it is generally understood that a parasite is an organism that steals its life from its hostweakening the host therebyHas Mr Lorado Taftor Mr Frank Lloyd Wrightor Mr Jerome Blumbeen robbed of any tittle of artistic ideasor of artistic techniqueor of admiration by Lindsay s bookor by the producers who have tried so ineffectually to follow his suggestionsI don t want to quibble with metaphorsbut if horticulture is to be the basis of them I should rather say that Lindsay proposes to burbank a wonderful new nectarine art by crossing paintingsculpturearchitectureand pantomimepresent the difficulty is that there is no one in the producing field with the artistic trainingand feelingand the burning genius withal to produce a wonderful filmMax Reinhardt or Gordon Craig could do itbut even they would be working against the difficulties of a new mediumD Annunzio did pretty well with Cabiria but Have you ever read AeschylusSuppliantsIt was the first and afterwards came Electra anddipusalong in his article Mr Zwaska grows boisterous at Lindsay who hassupposedly working on a suggestion from his friendJames Oppenheimspoken of the possibility of a highly symbolic film production of The Book of the DeadAnd this because Mrs Moore of Chicagohas worked out beautiful dancesand costumes and libretto for a stage production of the wonderful Nile and Sun mythBless Mrs Lou Wall MooreWe love her and her devotionWe have been wonder struck by the loveliness of her Egyptian costume designsWhen she does produce The Book of the Dead we willFate permittingmake a pilgrimage from this movie ridden Missouri town to see it wherever it may beAnd I know that we will be rejoiced to be able to do soBut I am sure that dear Mrs Moore would be the last person to object to a film production of The Book of the DeadIF the production be a beautiful oneForas Lindsay iterates and reiteratesthe stage and the moving pictures MUST be differentMrs Moore s production will havethe splendor of colorspaceheightdistanceand most magical of allthe voice And the worthy moving picture productionwhen it arriveswill havein black and white symphonythe infinite depths of the skywaving palm branchesthe width of the desertand above allbeautifully controlled actorsstreaming hundredsdirected and co ordinated as was the Diaghileff corps de balletAnd this beauty will travel all over the countrytouchingamong othersthis drama starved town of Missouriwhere we suffer for want of visual beautyZwaska deplores the lack of compositionmoving lineshe calls itin the moving picturesHe says that he has seen itonly in the flight of gullsunconscious actorsor in pictures of rivers and treesand the seain short NatureBut Nature is Naturewailed Mr ZwaskaAnd praywhy pervert the facts you bring forthIf the cinematograph can record the beautiful motion of the birdscan it not equally well record the beautiful motion of humans when the producer has learned to direct his actors as MFokine directs his dancersThere is room for Artin the name of all that is lovelymust people howl at any expression of belief in possibilities of a new artThe moving picture is ShakespeareanHugoesqueZolaesquein its methodWe see through it not only Antony and Cleopatrabut the two great hungry struggling groups that each impersonatesWe see not only the typical coal miner and his typical sorrows we see the mass of his comrades under the same oppressionthe same evil conditionsWe see betterbecause more swiftlythan Hugo could paint it with his wonderful vocabularyNotre Dame de Paristhe symbolthe social motif which embodies in a unity all that the story tries to show of the beautythe horrorthe fateand the aspirations of the pre Renaissancean ever present condition behind the actorsAre such possibilities to be shoved aside and denied a place among the arts where pageantry is admittedIs the fact that thousands of badatrociously badfilms are turned out to discredit the few well constructedsymbolic film playsLook at our abominable American poster makersDoes this discredit Mr Blumwhose praises we hear sungis one really vital criticism in Mr Zwaska s hectic articleThat isupon Lindsay stoo ruthless a theoryof no music in the movie theaterFrom the first we shied at thatWe are surprised at the author of poems to be read aloudAnother of our admirable country menwho qualifies not only as a sociologistbut as a philosopher and a poethas his say on the subject quite incidentallyI speak of Max Eastmanwhoin his Enjoyment of Poetrysays I have yet to find one in which the reality of the pictures is not enhanced with the beating of an old pianoNobody notices the pianonobody remembers what the piano playsor how badlybut there it isalways keeping up a metre The audiences voluntary mind is on the canvas but the music slips all the deeper into their beingsand it makes them live the pictures I can well believe Mr Zwaska s account of the after midnight picture showGranted that most picture show music is terriblethat the electric piano is agonizingthat it is deeply shocking to hear the Miserere when sweet Mary Pickford is acting the Un Bel Di Vedremo scene in Butterflythe music is far less dreadful than silenceand we talk through it all the sameI do not know a possible remedybut it is worth the thought of every person interested or disgustedThis is merely one of Vachel Lindsay s acknowledgedpaw paws here we are at the end of our wrathAnd here s a cheer and a hearty greeting for Lindsaywho is scaling the Pike s Peak of idealismAnd here s
