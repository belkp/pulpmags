gather gather bleeding bonnets gather huh  NIGHT  Woeful hear the shadows creep Woeful hear the tread of sleep  Who spoke   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It was a lone whip poor will By the fallen tree chanting mournfully For the dead or stretching a memory thread Between the Now and Other Years  Striking his harp Of tears  Sweetness see the stars appear Sweetness see the eyes draw near  Who winked  It was the smallest fire fly Here and there and now nowhere Dust of star come down so far To the little Below from the great Above  Flashing his signals Of love  Lovely see the moon aflush Lovely see the maiden blush  Who whispered  It was the tiny hidden spring From light caress of tenderness Sending back on a trembling track A kiss from the Here to a golden Sphere  Lifting her lips In fear  Wondrous hear the night wings whir Wondrous hear the phantoms stir   Night  Who sighed  It was the little top most leaf Of aspen bough when rocked somehow By a hand somewhere hearing the air Of that which Is in that which Seems  Wafting its heart  Of dreams  Holy feel the touch of dew Holy feel the kiss anew  Who breathed  It was the humblest flower Whose humid scent in petal tent Turned up the flap and joy enwrapped Escaped the clay to float on air  Nodding her head  In prayer  Sadness touch of the mystic scene Sadness touch of the hand unseen  Who prayed  It was I but a new born babe Whose thoughts unpent in bewilderment Fumbled for light in the web of night A cry of nothingness unto infinite skies  Sweeping my strings  Of sighs  Frank S Gordon   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IN THE DESERT  I  I have seen you O king of the dead More beautiful than sunlight  Your kiss is like quicksilver But I turned my face aside Lest you should touch my lips  In the field with the flowers You stood darkly  My knees trembled and I knew That no other joy would be like this  But the warm field and the sunlight And the few years of my girlhood Came before me and I cried  Not yet Not yet O dark lover  You were patient I know you will come again  I have seen you O king of the dead More beautiful than sunlight   In the Desert  II  Here in the desert under the cottonwoods That keep up a monotonous wind murmur of leaves I can hear the water dripping Through the canals in Venice From the oar of the gondola Hugging the old palaces Beautiful old houses Sinking quietly into decay  O sunlight how many things you gild With your eternal gold Sunlight and night are everlasting  III  Once every twenty four hours Earth has a moment of indecision  Shall I go on Shall I keep turning Is it worth while  Everything holds its breath The trees huddle anxiously On the edge of the arroyo And then with a tremendous heave Earth shoves the hours on towards dawn   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IV  Four o clock in the afternoon A stream of money is flowing down Fifth Avenue  They speak of the fascination of New York Climbing aboard motor busses to look down on the endless  play From the Bay to the Bronx But it is forever the same There is no life there  Watching a cloud on the desert Endlessly watching small insects crawling in and out of  the shadow of a cactus A herd boy on the horizon driving goats Uninterrupted sky and blown sand Space volume silence Nothing but life on the desert Intense life  V  The hill cedars and piñons Point upward like flames Like smoke they are drawn upward From the face of the mountains Over the sunbaked slopes   In the Desert  Patches of sun dried adobes straggle Willows along the acequias in the valley Give cool streams of green Beyond on the bare hillsides Yellow and red gashes and bleached white paths Give foothold to the burros To the black shawled Mexican girls Who go for water  INDIAN SONGS  LISTENING  The noise of passing feet On the prairie Is it men or gods Who come out of the silence  BUFFALO DANCE  Strike ye our land With curved horns Now with cries Bending our bodies Breathe fire upon us   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Now with feet Trampling the earth Let your hoofs Thunder over us Strike ye our land With curved horns  WHERE THE FIGHT WAS  In the place where the fight was Across the river In the place where the fight was Across the river A heavy load for a woman To lift in her blanket A heavy load for a woman To carry on her shoulder In the place where the fight was Across the river In the place where the fight was Across the river The women go wailing To gather the wounded The women go wailing To pick up the dead   The Wind  THE WIND  The wind is carrying me round the sky The wind is carrying me round the sky My body is here in the valley The wind is carrying me round the sky  COURTSHIP  When I go I will give you surely What you will wear if you go with me A blanket of red and a bright girdle Two new moccasins and a silver necklace When I go I will give you surely What you will wear if you go with me  FEAR  The odor of death In the front of my body The odor of death Before me  Is there any one Who would weep for me My wife Would weep for me   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PARTING  Now I go do not weep woman Woman do not weep Though I go from you to die We shall both lie down At the foot of the hill and sleep  Now I go do not weep woman Woman do not weep Earth is our mother and our tent the sky Though I go from you to die We shall both lie down At the foot of the hill and sleep  Alice Corbin   NEITHER SPIRIT NOR BIRD  Shoshone Love Song  Neither spirit nor bird That was my flute you heard Last night by the river When you came with your wicker jar Where the river drags the willows That was my flute you heard Wacoba Wacoba Calling Come to the willows  Neither the wind nor a bird Rustled the lupin blooms That was my blood you heard Answer your garment s hem Whispering through the grasses That was my blood you heard By the wild rose under the willows  That was no beast that stirred That was my heart you heard Pacing to and fro In the ambush of my desire To the flute s four noted call Wacoba Wacoba That was my heart you heard Leaping under the willows   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PRAYER TO THE MOUNTAIN SPIRIT  From the Navajo  Lord of the Mountain Reared within the Mountain Young Man Chieftain Hear a young man s prayer  Hear a prayer for cleanness Keeper of the strong rain Drumming on the mountain Lord of the small rain That restores the earth in newness Keeper of the clean rain Hear a prayer for wholeness  Young Man Chieftain Hear a prayer for fleetness Keeper of the deer s way Reared among the eagles Clear my feet of slothness Keeper of the paths of men Hear a prayer

strong rocks Hear a prayer for staunchness  Young Man Chieftain Spirit of the Mountain  Mary Austin   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SPRING TO THE EARTH WITCH  Pai iya to Swi ya Kwenewesals  My eyes I will not cover I am Pai iya stepping free on the goat hills behind thy  village Blue shadows and white mists like flowers Lie deep in thy green forests Night lingers in thy hair Pools of starred dusk are thine eyes Thy speech is gray fog impenetrable Shrouding the port of the crimson lure  The ships of the trusting one are broken Oh flower red is thy girdle at morning and evening If it were loosened there would be a race of men And thou the harbor of a thousand wondering ships I have lifted dawn before me as a shield Swi ya Kwen e we sals  The Raven pecks beside thy door On thy roof the Thunder Bird claps his wings Thy smile darkles across the skies Thy smile is death My heart is the riven sea beneath If thy scarlet girdle were unknotted would it stem the sea  of my wound Nay Call not me with the wind blowing through thy garments   Spring to the Earth Witch  I have bound the mountains to my feet Swi ya Kwen e we sals  Last night I saw winged stars in flight Circling o er thy dwelling They swung at rest on the points of the shore pine Torches red spanning the bay My wolves at my call In long gray troops fled up from the forest They sphered in guard about me sleeping on my shield  poised on the four world crags As darkened silver cloud mists wind about the moon I have shepherded them into the canyon between us But my eyes I will not cover Wilt thou come daring among my fanged flocks Swi ya Kwen e we sals  What is this warmth stealing to my height Like footsteps of a strange desire Wave on wave of pink and gold breaks over the white The petals open chirring As if they were feathers on the Song bird s swelling throat My wolves with heads hanging and fangs covered slowly  moving moving Huddle in the valley like sky shadows before rain Whose steps flow and ripple over the dark moss Parting the green walls of cedars Blossoming among my mating flocks Whence this unraveling of flame blown loose across the air   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  My eyes I will not cover I have woven thongs of the mountain mists And bound me to the morning star Between the cliffs of Night and Day thou emergest Thy sod brown bosom the mystical craving eyes above The yearning fragrance of thy closed hands The wild winds between thy feet And the rivers under thy girdle I have cast down the great shield of the dawn Come redden its rim with me Swi ya Kwen e we sals  CHIEF CAPILANO

Namesake  O Kia Kunâë Great Spirit One Great Kind One I praise thee for life I serve thee with living  I bless thee that in kindness thou hast made the earth And with love covered it Yea by thy kindness men and trees stand forth  Silently to me speak they the speech of brothers For delights the little rivers come among the hills  Shining with the smiles of women Ay as the merry murmuring of many maidens Are the rivers swift and tender in their coming  Because thou art Kind Kunâë thou madest women It is the morn Kunàë I pray I praise thee Ah how many hundred years hast thou prayed thus  Capilano With thee this day Mountain Father I thank Kunàë for  another dawn I am girt with blanket and rope of cedar fibre In my ear is a ring of fine bark Thou art belted with innumerable pine trees To thee they are smaller than feathers The sun is the cedar ring in thine ear The long sea asleep is the spear in thy hand It is still with pale lights on the distant blade Pointing at rest to islands beyond the dropping sky Thou art come forth as a hunter to the dawn Herding the antlered shadows down the forest slope Their swift fleeing hoofs strike fire from the beaten sand  shores of morning   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And the black wraiths swoon upon the bright opening sea With blood of his proud throat crimsoning the eastern sky The great Stag of the Dark in the van falls dying  Here was I chief ere the coming of the white man Now is his village spread from this sea beyond my sight His canoes are floating villages They go by with a great noise and a black smoke His deeds are mighty they leap with roaring clouds and  thunder fires Into the blue quiet morning and the white moon sky  Yet have I heard no sound mightier Than the sun shattering the night On thy stone shoulder Capilano Yet have I seen no sight more wonderful and fair Than the coming of the light When Day the silver winged gull down swooping finds the  sea Yet have I known no thing sweeter stronger Than the smell of piney winds and blue rippling sea water And the kindness of Kunâë Kia the living One Waking the heart of the old chief To another dawn of life  Constance Lindsay Skinner   POEMS  OLD MAN  Old Man or Lad s love in the name there s nothing To one that knows not Lad s love or Old Man The hoar green feathery herb almost a tree Growing with rosemary and lavender Even to one that knows it well the names Half decorate half perplex the thing it is At least what that is clings not to the name In spite of time And yet I like the names  The herb itself I like not but for certain I love it as some day the child will love it Who plucks a feather from the door side bush Whenever she goes in or out of the house Often she waits there snipping the tips and shrivelling The shreds at last on to the path perhaps Thinking perhaps of nothing till she sniffs Her fingers and runs off The bush is still But half as tall as she though it is as old So well she clips it Not a word she says And I can only wonder how much hereafter She will remember with that bitter scent Of garden rows and ancient damson trees Topping a hedge a bent path to a door A low thick bush beside the door and me Forbidding her to pick   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  As for myself Where first I met the bitter scent is lost I too often shrivel the grey shreds Sniff them and think and sniff again and try Once more to think what it is I am remembering Always in vain I cannot like the scent Yet I would rather give up others more sweet With no meaning than this bitter one  I have mislaid the key I sniff the spray And think of nothing I see and I hear nothing Yet seem too to be listening lying in wait For what I should yet never can remember No garden appears no path no hoar green bush Of Lad s love or Old Man no child beside Neither father nor mother nor any playmate Only an avenue dark nameless without end  THE WORD  There are so many things I have forgot That once were much to me or that were not All lost as is a childless woman s child And its child s children in the undefiled Abyss of what can never be again I have forgot too names of the mighty men That fought and lost or won in the old wars Of kings and fiends and gods and most of the stars   The Word  Some things I have forgot that I forget But lesser things there are remembered yet Than all the others One name that I have not Though tis an empty thingless name forgot Never can die because spring after spring Some thrushes learn to say it as they sing There is always one at midday saying it clear And tart the name only the name I hear While perhaps I am thinking of the elder scent That is like food or while I am content With the wild rose scent that is like memory This name suddenly is cried out to me From somewhere in the bushes by a bird Over and over again a pure thrush word  THE UNKNOWN  She is most fair And when they see her pass The poets ladies Look no more in the glass But after her  On a bleak moor Running under the moon She lures a poet Once proud or happy soon Far from his door   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Beside a train Because they saw her go Or failed to see her Travellers and watchers know Another pain  The simple lack Of her is more to me Than others presence Whether life splendid be Or utter black  I have not seen I have no news of her I can tell only She is not here but there She might have been  She is to be kissed Only perhaps by me She may be seeking Me and no other she May not exist  Edward Eastaway  EDITORIAL COMMENT  ABORIGINAL POETRY  I  IN OFFERING to our readers a number  almost entirely devoted to poems from Amer  ican Indian motives it seems proper to call  their attention to the rich mines of folk lore  still unrevealed or but half revealed among our aboriginal tribes The poems we present are not translations but interpretations they use subjects and rhythms drawn from aboriginal life and song and in Dr Gordon s case at least they should be read or rather chanted to the accompaniment of a posture dance and the strong beat of an instrument  Vivid as such work is in its suggestion of racial feeling and rhythm it gives merely a hint of the deeper resources it is a mere outcropping of the mine But although the mine exists with its stores of treasure the danger is that the tribes in the process of so called civilization will lose all trace of it that their beautiful primitive poetry will perish among the ruins of obliterated states  Thus we owe a special debt of gratitude to the few enthusiasts who have done something to preserve the fast disappearing folk lore of the tribes Few red men are numbered among them though Charles Alexander Eastman has retold two or three volumes of tales from the Ohiyesa and Sioux tribes also many tribal poets have generously cooperated with their white investigators   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  There are of course two methods of approach to this literature that of science and that of art These two overlap however because science often uses an artist to make its researches one who as in Frank Cushing s case uncovers whatever beauty he finds with reverence and without violence Work of great value has been done by the U S Bureau of Ethnology the Peabody Museum of Harvard the Universities of California and other western states the Carnegie Institution of Washington the Field Columbian Museum of Chicago and the American folk lore and antiquarian societies so that we have such books and reports as George A Dorsey s Pawnee Mythology and Traditions of the Arapaho William D Lyman s Oregon Myths Washington Matthews Navajo Legends Stephen C Simms Traditions of the Crows and Henry R Voth s Traditions of the Hopi In addition to these we have a few more or less scientific or philosophic books of comparison or reflection like Jeremiah Curtin s Creation Myths of Primitive America in Relation to the Religious History and Mental Development of Mankind or Ellen R Emerson s Indian Myths of All America Compared with Myths of Other Nations  Then there are books by private investigators and enthusiasts like George Bird Grinnell s careful transcripts of Blackfoot Lodge Tales and Pawnee Hero Stories Charles  F Lummis Pueblo Folk Stories James W Schultz Black  foot Tales of Glacier National Park and others besides the numerous more popular versions for grown ups and children    Aboriginal Poetry  A few investigators however have gone further in an effort to perpetuate the poetry and music of the redskins Miss Natalie Curtis for example cannot be too highly praised for the loving care and painstaking research which have given us The Indian s Book which she calls an offering by the American Indians of Indian lore musical and narrative to form a record of the songs and legends of their race Miss Alice C Fletcher in Indian Story and Song Indian Games and Dances etc has studied the songs and festivals of various tribes transcribing the music with both the original words and literal translations And Mr Sandburg will speak below of the work of Miss Frances Dens more The phonograph is a valuable aid to these modern investigators I myself saw the Snake dance of the Hopis in the lofty sky city of Walpi and I longed to be able to transcribe and translate those ancient chants which rose out of the desert as fitly as the mesa or the sunrise  But of all the students in this field Frank Hamilton Cushing who died too young alas probably had the most sympathetic and creative mind As he accepted the life of the Zuñis and became an adopted son of the tribe so he entered fully into the spirit of their religion and poetry and left us in his beautiful translation of The Creation Myth of the Zunis a masterpiece of primitive song which should rank and undoubtedly will ultimately rank among the great epics of the world At present it is hidden in one of those massive tomes which entomb the annual reports of the U S Bureau of Ethnology and it is a reproach to our civilization that no   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  publisher has yet dug it out for all to see But sooner or later it is sure of a shining resurrection Cushing s Zuni Folk tales published in 1901 fine as they are are not comparable with this heroic epic of a fading race H M  II The researches and translations by Miss Frances Dens more of Red Indian songs have become somewhat known in the musical world where adaptations have been made from her work for orchestral and choral use In the literary world this work has however escaped analysis or even such notice as it deserves in news value The explanation probably is that Miss Densmore s work was done for the United States government and forms two official reports of the Bureau of Ethnology As no efforts are made by that organization to exploit and advertise a writer the researches and translations have slumbered in a more or less innocuous desuetude The woman spent two years among Chippewa tribes and had the help of tribesmen who had lived twenty five years on the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota Chippewa Music is the title of the two volumes containing her notes and observations and they constitute Bulletin 45 and Bulletin 53 of the Bureau of Ethnology In both volumes are songs of tribal games and dances songs composed in dreams and individual songs of forgotten warriors I Have Lost My Sweetheart and Will Not Drink are names of love songs He Killed a Man and Carry It Away   Aboriginal Poetry  are dance songs And Chippewa juveniles have the Song of the Game of Silence and the Song of the Crawfish  Suspicion arises definitely that the Red Man and his children committed direct plagiarisms on the modern imagists and vorticists These are specimens  MY LOVE HAS DEPARTED  A loon I thought it was But it was My love s Splashing oar  To Sault Ste Marie He has departed My love has gone on before me Never again can I see him  LOVE CHARM SONG  What are you saying to me I am arrayed like the roses And beautiful as they  SONG FOR THE CURE OF THE SICK  They are in close consultation With their heads together Wenabojo and his grandmother  DOCTOR S SONG  I am singing and dreaming in my poor way Over the earth I who will again disembark Upon the earth  Carl Sandburg   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  III  In my brief Indian Songs I have taken the Indian key note which is often not more than a phrase a single mage with variations of musical inflection and repetition and expanded it very slightly The Indian song often means more than it says it is content to give the image and not to talk about it it is not journalistic Pantomime in the dances also fills out what is given to us by the bare words  Very little consideration has been given to Indian poetry as poetry The ethnologists who might have done good service in this respect have overlooked the literary significance of the Indian songs and the tendency of others has been to Europeanize both sentiment and form A translation of an Indian song that reads like an Elizabethan lyric gives little idea of the original Of course any addition whatever is taking liberties with the originals but I have tried to keep strictly within the spirit of them I am indebted for my key notes to the literal translations accompanying Miss Densmore s notations of Indian music A C H  EMILE VERHAEREN  May 21st 1855 Nov 29th I916  The death of Verhaeren is one more note in the tragedy  Il est ainsi de pauvres coeurs Avec en eux des lacs de pleurs Qui sont pâles commes les pierres D un cimetière  Il est ainsi de pauvres dos Plus lourds de peine et de fardeaux   Emile Verhaeren  Que les toits des cassines brunes Parmi les dunes  Il est ainsi de pauvres mains Comme feuilles sur les chemins Comme feuilles jaunes et mortes  Devant la porte Il est ainsi de pauvres yeux Humbles et bons et soucieux Et plus tristes que ceux des bêtes Sous la tempête  Il est ainsi de pauvres gens Aux gestes las et indulgents Sur qui s acharne la misère Au long des plaines de la terre  The man should have no epitaph save his own best verses poems of the Flamand country of the dull sorrow of peasants of the oppression of labor  It is time to forget his rhetorical period to forget that he pleased Gilbert Murray and time to remember only his great sincerity his great pity and the simplicity of his heart He was excited by current generalities in his worst moments he wrote such lines as  Le bondissant tocsin des vérités vivantes  In his reality he wrote such poems as the one I have quoted Toward the end he wrote of the new sorrows of warfare of men who had sat at his fireside and who in future would sit there no more  Depuis la guerre Ma chambre est close et solitaire  Car je n ai plus pour compagnon Que mon foyer à qui je parle   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It is extremely difficult to write of Verhaeren at this moment and for the public of a country not at war He was recognized as the greatest poet of Belgium though heretical voices have also been heard acclaiming Max Elskamp There is always danger of overestimating a man and of senitmentalizing over him at the moment of his death especially if it be sudden and violent And such overestimation invariably leads to an equally undue reaction both equitable minds and those tainted with jealousy adding their weight to this latter  I think I am right in saying that Verhaeren carried more weight with the better young poets of Paris five years ago than did most or perhaps any of his contemporaries Fort was also at that time in vogue And Bazalgette had stirred up a fresh flurry of Whitmanism by his very excellent French translation Verhaeren s faults were not those which irritated most during that season He and Whitman were the saints of one temple  I can not feel that he is so great a loss as Remy de Gourmont but this is a personal and not a detached judicial opinion Besides DeGourmont s position was based in great part on his prose  I doubt if there is as much good poetry in Verhaeren as in the earlier books of poems by Francis Jammes I do not know that Verhaeren s pictures of Flemish country are better than Viélé Griffin s Lâche comme le froid et la pluie I am fairly certain that his death leaves Laurent Tailhade the most important of the elder poets in France or at least   Emile Verhaeren  the only one of the elder men from whom we can still expect enjoyable poems Tailhade must not be considered as satirist only though his satires make swiftest appeal  This whole French generation of men born in the late fifties and early sixties has presented the curious phenomenon of a dozen or two poets all running even all producing notable poems none of them notably surpassing or dominating the rest At no time would a company of a dozen intelligent literati have agreed on an order of prominence This state of affairs might easily exist in a time of nonentities It was in this case a sign of France s opulence and though Verhaeren was not French he used the French language and his death must be held a loss to that literature However much one may associate him with his own country one must reckon his gifts in comparison with those of his French contemporaries He was counted peer with the best of them Ezra Pound  REVIEWS  THOSE BRONTES  Bronté Poems edited and with an introduction by A C  Benson G P Putnam s Sons The Complete Works of Emily Bronté Volume I Poetry Edited by W Robertson Nicoli and Clement Shorter Nodder and Stoughton In 1846 the poems of Charlotte Emily and Anne Bronté  under the pseudonyms of Currer Ellis and Acton Bell were   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  published by Aylott and Jones Mr Clement Shorter tells us that the book cost the authors thirty guineas and two copies supplied the public demand In 1850 after the death of Emily and Anne Charlotte issued a new edition of the 1846 volume including other poems of theirs and notes of her own  The little book Mr Benson has arranged so wisely is composed of selections from these publications and from hitherto unprinted verses of Charlotte Emily Anne and Branwell Prefaced by a reproduction of the painting of the four now in the National Portrait Gallery the frank purpose and the chief interest of the collection are biographical  This interest however by no means arises from internal evidence that the poems are autobiographical In Emily Bronte s hounting poem My Ancient Ship composed in her twenty first year she makes her voyaging hero say  Memory how thy magic fingers  With a wild and passing thrill  Wake the chord whose spirit lingers  Sleeping silently and still  Fast asleep and almost dying  Through my days of changeless pain  Till I dream these strings are lying  Never to be waked again  Winds have blown but all unknown  Nothing could arouse a tone  In that heart which like a stone  Senselessly has lain  But Emily Bronte s own heart it seems was not so heavy but that she could scribble gaily in a communicative and humorous outburst along the margin of My Ancient Ship   Those Brontés  I am more terrifically and infernally and idiotically stupid than ever I was in the whole course of my incarnate existence The above precious lines are the fruits of one hour s most agonizing labor between half past six and half past seven in the evening of July 1836  The inclusion in the edition of this remark of Emily s may perform a needed service to letters in aiding to clear that dull literary muddle in which the Brontés lives are read into their work and their work into their lives until neither has any distinct or integral value As Henry James has acutely observed  The personal position of the three sisters of the two in particular had been marked with so sharp an accent that this accent has become for us the very tone of their united production It covers and supplants their spirit their style their taste Literature is an objective a projected result it is life that is the unconscious the agitated the struggling floundering cause But the fashion has been in looking at the Brontés so to confuse the cause with the result that we cease to know in the presence of such ecstasies what we have held or what we are talking about They represent the ecstasies the high water mark of sentimental judgment  While it is true that life gave the Brontés a deep knowledge of sadness it must be remembered that melancholy was the conventional poetical mood of the day the day of the vogue of weeping willow trees and of a species of satisfaction in being deserted When even a person as devoted to inconstancy by nature and it may almost be said by principle as Lord Byron wrote in the literary temper of  Though human thou didst not deceive me Though woman thou didst not forsake Though loved thou forborest to grieve me  do you believe Charlotte Bronté says in Frances   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Unloved I love unwept Ì weep Grief I restrain hope I repress Vain is this anguish fixed and deep Vainer desires and dreams of bliss because she was unloved and unwept and in anguish No more than Shakespeare wrote Farewell a long farewell to all my greatness because he had just lost an archbiscopric or than Mr Sargent painted Carmencita because he had been carrying a fan and dancing the Cachuca Charlotte s verses have a few a very few fine moments and a distant family resemblance to poetry Branwell s verses have for me no interest whatever but the signature of a brother of the Brontes The distinct poetical endowment is Anne s and Emily s The younger sister s contribution is very slight much of it merely formal merely pietistic But in other instances infinitely touching and genuinely religious the material of her poetry is the very stuff of the music that dreams are made of the mystery the inexplicable deep sympathies of life The most vivid element in the book is of course the poetry of Emily Though in Bronte Poems the two heretofore unpublished selections disentangled from the difficult manuscript of her notebook are characteristic and though the whole text of her work in this edition is in my view more sympathetically arranged than in the volume devoted exclusively to her own production yet this volume is naturally more completely representative Emily Bronte s poetry full of the profound charm of the   Those Broutés  shadowed things of life like the stormy twilight she so often evokes for us echoes with the  Wild words of an ancient song Undefined without a name The beauty of the rain the cold the ways of nature that have no benison for man she was one of the first to express The acute sweetness of that song has been too little appreciated She has suffered too untempered a fame for one whose phrase like Shakespeare s has the rich power that swings with a full movement through both the passions and the dearnesses of existence  Redbreast early in the morning Dark and cold and cloudy gray Wildly tender is thy music Chasing angry thought away Pain bereavement defeat freedom and imprisonment the prospect of death a fast allegiance with suffering the love of dumb creatures the passion of human justice the inmost life the will s life the intensest forces of meditation she says them all Some of her expression is clumsy her rhyme weak and forced but the root of the music that speaks inarticulately is always there the communicative power of tonal design though often only roughly sketched On every page something beckons something gleams plunging horse hoofs gallop in the distance a great light splinters on the point of a Valkyrie s spear and deep in the reader s soul the splendor of a woman s voice calls out through the ride down the mountain tops One is glad to see the heroic fragments and the un heroic unfinished designs which the book includes too many and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of too many kinds to tell in detail Death arrested the de  signer s hand that yet left behind it the earnest of immor  tality the very proof as it were of the truth of one of her  most stirring and beautiful stanzas  Nature s deep being thine shall hold  Her spirit all thy spirit fold  Her breath absorb thy sighs  Mortal though soon life s tale is told  Who once lives never dies  Edith Wyatt  A BOOK BY LAWRENCE  Amores by D H Lawrence B W Huebsch New York  The pages of this book are the record of a great struggle Through these poems and over them we feel the beating and lashing of a restless passionate soul passionate in its loves and aspirations that is clogged with flesh caught in meshes of flesh and held prisoner The ache of brown hands the throbbing of blood in the darkness these are with Lawrence always Seldom has anyone expressed with such vividness the tinge that stifled flesh gives to the universe the urge that gives to flowers and stars the wine color of longing and brings into tense passionate relief details that otherwise were meaningless Snap dragon is perhaps the best poem of its kind in English  Yet there is seldom any pagan joy in the things of the flesh They come to him not as light but as darkness as something that clogs and hinders him something that he must fight through and cannot yet And it is the vain   A Book by Lawrence  struggle to free himself that has given us the beauty of this book  His aspirations are as passionate as his loves What could be more spiritually impassioned than this from Dreams Old and Nascenti  Oh the terrible ecstasy of the consciousness that I am life Oh the miracle of the whole the widespread laboring concentration Swelling mankind like one bud to bring forth the fruit of a dream Oh the terror of lifting the innermost I out of the sweep of the  impulse of life And watching the great Thing laboring through the whole round  flesh of the world And striving to catch a glimpse of the shape of the coming dream As it quickens within the laboring white hot metal Catch the scent and color of the coming dream Then to fall back exhausted into the unconscious molten life  Yet though the key note of the book is this passionate struggle there are calmer moments in it moments that presage the later Lawrence who is already emerging from the welter For the poems in this volume are for the most part early work and a number more recent already known to readers of POETRY are not included Here is a steady little picture in a quieter vein called Patience  A wind comes from the north Blowing little flocks of birds Like a spray across the town And a train roaring forth Rushes stampeding down With cries and flying curds Of steam out of the darkening north  Whither I turn and set Like a needle steadfastly Waiting ever to get The news that she is free   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But ever fixed as yet To the lode of her agony And where can we find anything more humanly and poignantly beautiful than A Baby Asleep After Pain  As a drenched drowned bee  Hangs numb and heavy from a bending flower So clings to me  My baby her brown hair brushed with wet tears  And laid against her cheek  Her soft white legs hanging heavily over my arm  Swinging heavily to my movement as I walk  My sleeping baby hangs upon my life  Like a burden she hangs on me  She has always seemed so light  But now she is wet with tears and numb with pain  Even her floating hair sinks heavily  Reaching downwards  As the wings of a drenched drowned bee  Are a heaviness and a weariness  Several of the poems in this book are already known to  American lovers of poetry Snap dragon was in the first  Georgian Verse anthology and four of the other poems  under different titles have been published in POETRY al  though no reference is made to the fact But read as a  whole the book has a cumulative effect that sets Lawrence  definitely in the front rank of English poets E T  H D S VISION  Sea garden by H D The New Poetry Series Boston Houghton Mifflin Co London Constable amp Co The great mystics whether they call themselves Chris  tians or pagans have all this trait in common that they  describe in terms of ordinary experience some super normal   H D s Vision  experience The unpractised reader picking up H D s Sea garden and reading it casually might suppose it was all about flowers and rocks and waves and Greek myths when it is really about the soul or the primal intelligence or the Nous or whatever we choose to call that link that binds us to the unseen and uncreated  This small volume is indeed a garden but of such flowers as not many eyes may see flowers in some way made perfect and unfading through their own exceeding bitterness The light burns sharp here like a sword it is painful to walk in the glare of this beauty Here are useless and beautiful things flowers rootless scentless and beyond the everlasting grind of the sea on the rocks and a lonely temple or statue aloof and unresponding And if we wander here long enough and make our minds receptive to these influences we soon discover that all this is only a veil of beautiful texture hurled before the shrine Behind the veil we can catch with eve increasing brightness the outline of a myth that is to say an eternal reflection of the ephemeral To penetrate H D s inner meaning it is only necessary that we approach her poetry with an open and responsive mind that we make a mirror of ourselves to reflect the light she has caught in her mirror But this state of mind receptive quiescent is also necessary if we are to understand Plotinus or Dionysius the Areopagite or Paracelsus or Behmen or Swedenborg or Blake or any other of the mystics  As I read and re read this small volume for it is necessary to read it many times I cease to care whether this is   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  or is not what the academic critics choose to label Poetry or whether it is or is not Imagism Whatever it is the form is as inevitable as the substance since neither form nor substance has been created independently It is beauty independent of laws holding but to its own hard and bitter perfection Perhaps not to many it will appeal because most of us have the human thirst for imperfection for the sea change and not for the sea peace that follows after the change for the surface dance and glitter and not for the profound calm light of the depth But to some it will appeal and its future is safe in their hands  It were folly to attempt to quote from a book which is so much of one piece tempered as this But if human preferences and prejudices could yet intrude I would select the entire poem entitled The Gift a poem I do not understand and which I feel I am not worthy to understand as my own undoubted preference Yet I have not space for this so I must pick out instead one of those exquisite little flower pieces as an example of the art that H D has made her own  The white violet Is scented on its stalk The sea violet Fragile as agate Lies fronting all the wind Among the torn shells On the sand bank  The greater blue violets Flutter on the hill But who would change for these Who would change for these One root of the white sort   H D s Vision  Violet Your grasp is frail On the edge of the sand hill But you catch the light Frost a star edges with its fire  John Gould Fletcher  WAR AND WOMANHOOD  Harvest Moon by Josephine Preston Peabody Houghton Mifflin Co This book contains perhaps the best work that Mrs Marks has done Her art always delicate responds to the experiences of life so that each thought as it comes falls naturally and surely into its own medium and the reader need have no concern with tools What is the charm that we look for in each new book she brings out It is not easy to define although surely these are some of the things that make for it the heart of a woman of a mother that is nevertheless always the heart of a child subtlety yet down rightness an ear contending for the music of the line power to seize and hold her vision and an intuition embracing what has been and what may never be in the world upon which she looks in which she listens Mrs Marks work is elusive never coarsely obvious With her the tone of a little flute on the air may tell more vital truths than any martial crash of sound I think that notwithstanding denials that the war has developed poets the time has come when we must claim that it has given the world a new poetic intake of breath French poems from   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the trenches prove it and now and then a rare English song has a strength of appeal which is an achievement But no poet of war times except Mrs Marks has given us a clear full rounded wreath of lights to send rays wherever woman bears heavily the burden of war for war is now as it has been throughout the ages the burden of woman In this book tenderly understandingly she gathers to her all womankind She has the power too to enter the very soul of dumb animals and look men through and through with their eyes  W e may linger over these poems singly but they belong together They tell us that there is a higher way of settling the world s disputes than by blood and steel if men would only see Here we have no longer the picture of a mother sending her son forth to battle with a God bless you Go fight for your country Very different is the mother of dead sons who pours out the bitterness of her heart to the harvest moon  You will be laughing now remembering We called you once Dead World and barren thing Yes so we called you then You far more wise Than to give life to men  In all of these poems some of hope some stern with purpose to show men a higher heritage than that of hate not even the darkest shadow is without its gleam of faith to be sought perhaps as radium in pitch blend but unquenchably alive  There are poems we remember and hail anew in book form Who could forget Woman vigil done in sweeping   War and Womanhood  Sapphics with intervening short lines like sobs of children and Men Have Wings at Last and the lovely Cradle Song The following stanzas from Woman vigil suggest the questioning of the modern woman as this poet divines her  What new pride you of the ceaseless vigil Knocks at your heart Or what far folly of questing Stirs you now between the loom and the cradle  Woman unresting  Mind of the moon is yours her song and her strangeness Singing spinning even as her earth born daughters Spin and sing yet laying her strong commandment  Over the waters  The echoes died Around the hour Back flew the doves Back to the tower The house lay dark In sleep within The Shadow turned to spin  Agnes Lee Freer  TRANSLATIONS  The Epic Songs of Russia translated by Isabel F Hapgood Scribner s Has Russia ever created anything original Turgeniev  doubted it he even suspected that Russia s claim to the invention of the samovar was unfounded I think it was Brandes remark that Russia s only originality consisted in her being the least original of all other countries The most patriotic Russian will not deny that his is the arch borrowing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  nation but he will ascribe this feature to the inherent broadness of the Russian mind That vast plain open on all sides to foreign invasions resembles a palm invitingly outstretched to the universe in quest of new ideas in Russia s political order in her religion and art you can trace the influences of all races and civilizations from the Scandinavian Germanic Latin Byzantine in the occident to the Hindu Tartar Persian Chinese in the orient One must bear in mind one essential thing however all those various influences have become Russianized i e intensified broadened in a word universalized  This universalism or if you wish eclecticism is most obviously evident in the Russian epic songs which are to this day sung by the illiterate inhabitants of the marshy provinces north of Petrograd Russian folk lore orally transmitted from generation to generation not until the middle of the nineteenth century were those songs put into writing bears the stamp of European and Asiatic mythologies and yet it is most characteristically Russian in its prevailing motives The Norse sagas transported by the Varangian princes in the ninth century mingled with native Slavic and Finnish mythology merged later with the Byzantine Christianity superimposed on the still vigorous local Paganism absorbed various Asiatic motives imported by the Tartar hordes and so forth The fact that the Tartar invaders had held Russia for three centuries is accountable for a considerable Asiatic strain in the Russian genius Grattez le Russe    Translations  As I said the motives of the epic songs are characteristically Russian The earth or more literally the soil is frequently anthropomorphized the heroes bogatyr hero and polianitza heroine possess the features of all Aryan folk heroes plus the peculiarly Russian Hamletism abandon naivete and anarchic religiousness An ordinary bylina epic song is trochaic with a dactylic ending of five or six feet which may be lengthened to seven or contracted to four it is chanted to a simple yet fugitive recitative  Miss Isabel F Hapgood has conscientiously and lovingly translated some of the most characteristic bylini into excellent English prose The first edition appeared in 1886 it is permissible to hope that the new edition of 1916 will arouse more interest and appreciation than that of thirty years ago Alexander S Kaun  Songs of Ukraina with Ruthenian Poems translated by  Florence Randal Livesay J M Dent amp Sons London  and E P Dutton amp Co New York  POETRY has published many of these peasant songs and we can only emphasize here their extreme beauty Since The Bard of the Dimbovitza over twenty years ago first made us aware of the poetry hidden in the folk lore of eastern Europe our ears have been opened to this vibrant music and Mrs Livesay s book is one of the most intimate of all Like the translators of that earlier collection this Canadian poet has caught the feeling of the songs sung to her in this case by immigrants in Winnipeg and she has been skilful enough to give the very pulse of it in many of her English versions   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  An introduction by Paul Crath and a note by the translator set the scene for these poems which are grouped under Cossack Songs Wedding Songs Robber Songs songs pagan historical etc and simple Folk Songs We should like to quote a number but as space is lacking we must refer the reader to our files or better still to the book H M  Women s Eyes by Arthur William Ryder A M Robertson San Francisco This is a quaint little volume of short classical Hindu  poems mostly by Bhartrihari the greatest of Hindu lyricists The translation is by William Arthur Ryder professor of Sanskrit at the University of California and is done with an engaging dry humor in unusually clean cut English A little book to buy and cherish  The title poem is by King Bhartrihari who lived most royally fifteen hundred years ago The world is full of women s eyes Defiant filled with shy surprise Demure a little overfree Or simply sparkling roguishly It seems a gorgeous lily bed Whichever way I turn my head  D D  NOTES  All but one of the poets represented in this number live or have lived in the wilder West of the United States or British Columbia They have derived their interpretations of tribal folk poetry either from direct contact with the tribes themselves or from love of their art their rhythms and sympathy with their ideas   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Dr Frank S Gordon born in 1877 at Branchville New Jersey has lived much in our Southwest and in Mexico since his graduation from the medical college of New York University He has begun only recently to write verse being moved thereto chiefly he says by a study of aboriginal music He writes of the variety and freedom of Indian rhythm and illustrates his poems with very beautiful and original decorative water color drawings whose motives both of color and form are derived from aboriginal art and from the stark growths of the desert  Dr Gordon who now lives in Blairstown New Jersey has written also poems on Mexican motives and lyric poems more or less interpretative of civilized life But it seemed advisable that he should appear first with a group chosen entirely from the aboriginal poems I want to do my little bit he writes for a vanishing and noble race  In The Tom tom an aged warrior is beating out once more the rhythms of his life living over his loves dreams battles and the tragedy of his race Tirawa is the name of his deity Sa a Naraï is a chant which aims to reflect fairly accurately the Indian s outlook upon life and which is characteristic in its opening and close and in its rhythm full of repetition  Mrs Mary Austin s work in prose places her among the most sympathetic interpreters of our western country with its varied and picturesque life She has published only one book in verse Fires University of Wisconsin Press a play which has been given very effectively by amateurs out of doors in Madison Wis and Carmel Cal  Alice Corbin Mrs William P Henderson who has been from the first an associate editor of POETRY is now staying for a time in New Mexico  Miss Constance Lindsay Skinner has appeared several times in POETRY with poems on aboriginal motives Her inspiration was derived in youth during much travel among the tribes of British Columbia  The only exception to the wild western quality of this number is Mr Edward Eastaway an English poet now in the trenches whose appearance in POETRY had to be immediate lest the next issue of Georgian Verse should have the honor of introducing him  Mr Travis Hoke whose brief poems we printed last month is no longer a mystery to the editor In fact he is revealed as associate editor of The
