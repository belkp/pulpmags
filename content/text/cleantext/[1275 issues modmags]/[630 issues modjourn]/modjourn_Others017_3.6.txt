BROWN, Boston Agent, Cornhill Price 15 Cents 12 Issues, $1.50 ## ## MINA LOY 3 I Spawn of Fantasies Silting the appraisable Pig Cupid his rosy snout Rooting erotic garbage "Once upon a time" Pulls a weed white and star-topped Among wild oats sewn in mucous-membrane I would an eye in a bengal light Eternity in a sky-rocket Constellations in an ocean Whose rivers run no fresher Than a trickle of saliva These are suspect places I must live in my lantern Trimming subliminal flicker Virginal to the bellows Of Experience Coloured glass II The skin-sack In which a wanton duality Packed All the completions of my infructuous impulses Something the shape of a man ## 4 MINA LOY To the casual vulgarity of the merely observant More of a clock-work mechanism Running down against time To which I am not paced My finger-tips are numb from fretting your hair A God's door-mat On the threshold of your mind III We might have coupled In the bed-ridden monopoly of a moment Or broken flesh with one another At the profane communion table Where wine is spill't on promiscuous lips We might have given birth to a butterfly With the daily-news Printed in blood on its wings IV Once in a mezzanino The starry ceiling Vaulted an unimaginable family Bird-like abortions With human throats And Wisdom's eyes Who wore lamp-shade red dresses And woolen hair ## MINA LOY 5 One bore a baby In a padded porte-enfant Tied with a sarsanet ribbon To her goose's wings But for the abominable shadows I would have lived Among their fearful furniture To teach them to tell me their secrets Before I guessed —Sweeping the brood clean out V Midnight empties the street Of all but us Three I am undecided which way back To the left a boy —One wing has been washed in the rain The other will never be clean any more— Pulling door-bells to remind Those that are snug To the right a haloed ascetic Threading houses Probes wounds for souls —The poor can't wash in hot water— And I dont know which turning to take Since you got home to yourself—first ## 6 MINA LOY VI I know the Wire-Puller intimately And if it were not for the people On whom you keep one eye You could look straight at me And Time would be set back VII My pair of feet Smack the flag-stones That are something left over from your walking The wind stuffs the scum of the white street Into my lungs and my nostrils Exhilarated birds Prolonging flight into the night Never reaching — — — — — — — VIII I am the jealous store-house of the candle-ends That lit your adolescent learning Behind God's eyes There might Be other lights ## MINA LOY 7 IX When we lifted Our eye-lids on Love A cosmos Of coloured voices And laughing honey And spermatazoa At the core of Nothing In the milk of the Moon X Shuttle-cock and battle-door A little pink-love And feathers are strewn XI Dear one at your mercy Our Universe Is only A colorless onion You dérobe Sheath by sheath Remaining A disheartening odour About your nervy hands ## 8 MINA LOY XII Voices break on the confines of passion Desire Suspicion Man Woman Solve in the humid carnage Flesh from flesh Draws the inseparable delight Kissing at gasps to catch it Is it true That I have set you apart Inviolate in an utter crystallization Of all the jolting of the crowd Taught me willingly to live to share Or are you Only the other half Of an ego's necessity Scourging pride with compassion To the shallow sound of dissonance And boom of escaping breath ## MINA LOY 9 XIII Come to me There is something I have got to tell you and I can't tell Something taking shape Something that has a new name A new dimension A new use A new illusion It is ambient And it is in your eyes Something shiny Something only for you Something that I must not see It is in my ears Something very resonant Something that you must not hear Something only for me Let us be very jealous Very suspicious Very conservative Very cruel Or we might make an end of the jostling of aspirations Disorb inviolate egos Where two or three are welded together They shall become god Oh that's right Keep away from me Please give me a push Don't let me understand you Don't realise me ## 10 MINA LOY Or we might tumble together Depersonalized Identical Into the terrific Nirvana Me you — you — me XIV Today Everlasting passing apparent imperceptible To you I bring the nascent virginity of —Myself for the moment No love or the other thing Only the impact of lighted bodies Knocking sparks off each other In chaos XV Seldom Trying for Love Fantasy dealt them out as gods Two or three men looked only human But you alone Superhuman apparently I had to be caught in the weak eddy Of your drivelling humanity To love you most ## MINA LOY 11 XVI We might have lived together In the lights of the Arno Or gone apple stealing under the sea Or played Hide and seek in love and cob-webs And a lullaby on a tin-pan And talked till there were no more tongues To talk with And never have known any better XVII I don't care Where the legs of the legs of the furniture are walking to Or what is hidden in the shadows they stride Or what would look at me If the shutters were not shut Red a warm colour on the battle-field Heavy on my knees as a counterpane Count counter I counted the fringe of the towel Till two tassels clinging together Let the square room fall away From a round vacuum Dilating with my breath XVIII Out of the severing Of hill from hill ## 12 MINA LOY The interim Of star from star The nascent Static Of night XIX Nothing so conserving As cool cleaving Note of the Q H U Clear carving Breath-giving Pollen smelling Space White telling Of slaking Drinkable Through fingers Running water Grass haulms Grow to Leading astray Of fireflies Aerial quadrille Bouncing Off one another Again conjoining In recaptured pulses Of light ## MINA LOY 13 You too Had something At that time Of a green-lit glow-worm Yet slowly drenched To raylessness In rain XX Let Joy go solace-winged To flutter whom she may concern XXI I store up nights against you Heavy with shut-flower's nightmares Stack noons Curled to the solitaire Core of the Sun XXII Green things grow Salads For the cerebral Forager's revival ## 14 MINA LOY Upon bossed bellies Of mountains Rolling in the sun And flowered flummery Breaks To my silly shoes In ways without you I go Gracelessly As things go XXIII Laughter in solution Stars in a stare Irredeemable pledges Of pubescent consummations Rot To the recurrent moon Bleach To the pure white Wickedness of pain XXIV The procreative truth of Me Petered out In pestilent Tear drops Little lusts and lucidities And prayerful lies ## MINA LOY 15 Muddled with the heinous acerbity Of your street-corner smile XXV Licking the Arno The little rosy Tongue of Dawn Interferes with our eyelashes We twiddle to it Round and round Faster And turn into machines Till the sun Subsides in shining Melts some of us Into abysmal pigeon-holes Passion has bored In warmth Some few of us Grow to the level of cool plains Cutting our foot-hold With steel eyes XXVI Shedding our petty pruderies From slit eyes ## 16 MINA LOY We sidle up To Nature — — — that irate pornographist XXVII Nucleus Nothing Inconceivable concept Insentient repose The hands of races Drop off from Immodifiable plastic The contents Of our ephemeral conjunction In aloofness from Much Flowed to approachment of — — — — NOTHING There was a man and a woman In the way While the Irresolvable Rubbed with our daily deaths Impossible eyes XXVIII The steps go up for ever And they are white And the first step is the last white Forever ## MINA LOY 17 Coloured conclusions Smelt to synthetic Whiteness Of my Emergence And I am burnt quite white In the climacteric Withdrawal of your sun And wills and words all white Suffuse Illimitable monotone White where there is nothing to see But a white towel Wipes the cymophonous sweat —Mist rise of living— From your Etiolate body And the white dawn Of your New Day Shuts down on me Unthinkable that white over there — — — Is smoke from your house XXIX Evolution fall foul of Sexual equality Prettily miscalculate Similitude ## 18 MINA LOY Unnatural selection Breed such sons and daughters As shall jibber at each other Uninterpretable cryptonyms Under the moon Give them some way of braying brassily For carressive calling Or to homophonous hiccoughs Transpose the laugh Let them suppose that tears Are snowdrops or molasses Or anything Than human insufficiencies Begging dorsal vertebrae Let meeting be the turning To the antipodean And Form a blurr Anything Than seduce them To the one As simple satisfaction For the other Let them clash together From their incognitoes In seismic orgasm ## MINA LOY 19 For far further Differentiation Rather than watch Own-self distortion Wince in the alien ego XXX In some Prenatal plagiarism Foetal buffoons Caught tricks From architypal pantomime Stringing emotions Looped aloft For the blind eyes That Nature knows us with And the most of Nature is green What guaranty For the proto-form We fumble Our souvenir ethics to — — — — — — — XXXI Crucifixion Of a busy-body ## 20 MINA LOY Longing to interfere so With the intimacies Of your insolent isolation Crucifixion Of an illegal ego's Eclosion On your equilibrium Caryatid of an idea Crucifixion Wracked arms Index extremities In vacuum To the unbroken fall XXXII The moon is cold Joannes Where the Mediterranean — — — — — XXXIII The prig of passion — — — — To your professorial paucity Proto-plasm was raving mad Evolving us — — — XXXIV Love — — — the preeminent literateur ##
