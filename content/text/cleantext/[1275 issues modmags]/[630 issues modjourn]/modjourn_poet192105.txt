other men Offer me indigo indignities  Undertaker Indigo indignities The words are like a mermaid and a saint Doubting each other s existence with a kiss  Poet The words of most men kiss With satiated familiarity Indigo is dark and vehement But one word in place of two Angers barmaids and critics Undertaker Straining after originality You argue with its ghost A simple beauty like morning   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Harnessed by a wide sparkle And plodding into the hearts of men Cannot reach your frantic juggling  Poet I can appreciate The spontaneous redundancy of nature Without the aid of an echo From men who lack her impersonal size Undertaker The sweeping purchase of an evening By an army of stars The bold incoherence of love The peaceful mountain roads of friendship These things evade your dexterous epigrams  Poet A statue polished and large Dominates when it stands alone Placed in a huge profusion of statues Its outlines become humiliated Simplicity demands one gesture And men give it endless thousands Complexity wanders through a forest Glimpsing details in the gloom  Undertaker I do not crave the dainty pleasure Of chasing ghosts in a forest Nor do I care to pluck Exaggerated mushrooms in the gloom I have lost myself on roads Crossed by tossing hosts of men Pain and anger have scorched our slow feet Peace has washed our foreheads   Maxwell Bodenheim  Poet Futility massive and endless Captures a stumbling grandeur Embalmed in history In my forest you could see this From a distance and lose Your limited intolerance Simplicity and subtlety At different times are backgrounds for each other Changing with the position of our eyes Death will burn your eyes With his taciturn complexity  Undertaker Death will strike your eyes With his wild simplicity  Poet Words are soldiers of fortune Hired by different ideas To provide an importance for life But within the glens of silence They meet in secret peace Undertaker do you make of death A puffing wretch forever pursued By duplicates of vanquished forms Or do you make him a sneering king Brushing flies from his bloodless cheeks Do you see him as an unappeased brooding Walking over the dust of men Do you make him an eager giant Discovering and blending into his consciousness The tiny parts of his limitless mind   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Undertaker Death and I do not know each other I am the stolid janitor Who cleans the litter he has left And claims a fancied payment  Poet Come to my fantastic forest And you will not need to rise From simple labors asking death For final wages  EMOTIONAL MONOLOGUE  A man is sitting within the enigmatic turmoil of a railroad station His face is narrow and young and his nose lips and eyes carved to a Semitic sharpness have been sundered by a bloodless catastrophe A traveling bag stands at his feet Around him people are clutching farewells and shouting greetings Within him a monologue addresses an empty theatre  I am strangling emotions And casting them into the seats Of an empty theatre When my lifeless audience is complete The ghosts of former emotions Will entertain their dead masters After each short act A humorous ghost will fly through the audience Striking the limp hands into applause   Maxwell Bodenheim  And between the acts Sepulchral indifference will mingle With the dust upon the backs of seats Upon the stage a melodrama And a travesty will romp Against a back drop of fugitive resignation Climax and anti climax Will jilt each other and drift Into a cheated insincerity Sometimes the lights will retire While a shriek and laugh Make a martyr of the darkness When the lights reappear An actor ghost will assure the audience That nothing has happened save The efforts of a fellow ghost To capture life again In his role of usher Another ghost will arrange The lifeless limbs of the audience Into postures of relief Sometimes a comedy will trip The feet of an assassin Declaring that if ghosts were forced To undergo a second death Their thinness might become unbearable At other times indignant tragedy Will banish an intruding farce   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Claiming that life should not retain The luxury of another laugh The first act of the play will show The owner of the theatre Conversing with the ghost of a woman As unresponsive as stone Solidly repelling a spectral world His words will keenly betray The bloodless control of his features He will say With slightly lowered shoulders Because of a knife sticking in my back I shall trifle with crowded highways Buying decorations For an interrupted bridal party This process will be unimportant To the workshop of my mind Where love and death are only Colorless problems upon a chart The ghost of the woman will say Your mind is but the rebellious servant Of sensitive emotions And brings them clearer dominance And what shall I mournfully answer I am strangling emotions And casting them into the seats Of an empty theatre   Maxwell Bodenheim  FEMININE TALK  First Woman Do you share the present dread Of being sentimental The world has flung its boutonnière Into the mud and steps upon it With elaborate gestures Certain people do this neatly Using solemn words for consolation Others angrily stamp their feet Striving to prove their strength  Second Woman Sentimentality Is the servant girl of certain men And the wife of others She scarcely ever flirts With creative minds Striving also to become Graceful and indiscreet  First Woman Sappho and Aristotle Have wandered through the centuries Dressed in an occasional novelty A little twist of outward form They have always been ashamed T o be caught in a friendly talk  Second Woman When emotion and the mind Engage in deliberate conversation One hundred nightingales And intellectuals find a common ground   And curse the meeting of their slaves  First Woman The mind must only play With polished relics of emotion And the heart must never lighten Burdens of the mind  Second Woman I desire to be Irrelevant and voluble Leaving my terse disgust for a moment I have met an erudite poet With a northern hardness Motionless beneath his youthful robes He shuns the quivering fluencies Of emotion and shifts his dominoes Within a room of tortured angles But away from this creative room He sells himself to the whims Of his wife a young virago With a calculating nose Beneath the flagrant pose Of his double life Emotion and the mind Look disconsolately at each other  First Woman Lyrical abandon And mental cautiousness Must not mingle to a magic Glowing yet deliberate Second Woman Never spill your wine Upon a page of mathematics   Maxweìl Bodenheim  Drink it decently Within the usual tavern  PHILOSOPHICAL DIALOGUE  First Man W e gaze upon a negro shoveling coal His muscles fuse into a poem Stifled and sinister Censuring the happy rhetoric of morning air Some day he may pitch his tent Upon the ruins of a civilization Playing with documents and bottles of perfume Found in deserted corridors  Second Man Listen to this song Dipped in the Negro South of America  She brought me collars and shoes She brought me whiskey and tea She brought me everything that I could use But the jail house key  Time inserts the jail house key Into a succession of rusty locks Straining until they open Do you hear beneath the rattling strut Of this city an imperceptible groan Time is turning the jail house key They build larger jails for Time   He makes larger keys of blood and iron But often the labor is delayed By pausing squeals of freedom  First Man An insignificant jest In the wider life of Time He has dropped to this earth To play a barbarous comedy Philosophers loudly explain the scenes But poets with greater restraint Tender them a masquerade  Second Man Once I sat and watched A scientific philosopher Place white lines on a black board Diagraming his mighty system of logic While he worked the wind outside Squandered its derision And offered him a cup he dared not drink Afterwards in the open air The slash of rain on my face Mockingly baptised his words  First Man To him the wind and rain Were trivialities against a brick wall  Second Man To me they were tormented wanderers Quarreling above a doll s house Whose intricate patterns Waited to be kicked aside I changed myself to a height That made them whimpering pygmies   Maxwell Bodenheim  And gave them grotesque costumes  Enjoying the insolence of imagination  First Man The scientific philosopher Raised his umbrella against the rain And communed with venerable argument  Second Man He was interested in improving The lustre of a doll s house In which I had left my small body Walls are enticing black boards to some And neglected prisons to others I prefer the second Of tenuous bravado That turns the prison into a threshold And jests with the wind and rain that survive it Maxwell Bodenheim   THREE SONNETS  OLD WIVES TALE  1 saw my grandmother s shadow on the wall In firelight it danced with queer grimaces As if her serious soul were making faces At me or life or God or at us all And I an urchin lying at her feet Then caught my first glimpse of the secret powers That stir beneath this universe of ours Making a witches carnival when they meet Across the firelit dusk my sensitive mood Dreamed out to mingle with the waifs of Time Whose unsolved stories haunt the poets rhyme And in dark streets of ancient cities brood Like sudden ghosts rising above the grime With beauty and with terror that chills the blood  HOLY WRIT  It does not seem so many years ago Those nights when I lay shivering in my bed And saw the candle light round my aunt s head  Casting its hazy sanctifying glow And heard her read strange story after story  Of Jonah Adam Moses Esau Ruth   Arthur Davison Ficke  Of Solomon s old age and David s youth Things haunting tender terrible or gory Still can I see the Queen of Sheba s hair And all real lions are but mockery To him who once knew Daniel s there s no tree That can with Eve s great Paradise Tree compare A golden light gleamed through that ancient air That leaves me homesick in modernity  THE BOOK OF LU T ANG CHU  In the reign of the great Emperor Lu T ang Chu Wise men were ordered to inscribe in a book All the great body of wisdom that men knew Today I turn the pages and as I look I cannot see anything very new or old And I wonder why it was worth the trouble then Of days and nights and a thousand labors untold Which the volume must have exacted from those wise men But still we write and the Emperor now is blown As grey dust over the limitless Asian plains Still we inscribe all that is humanly known Although no ruler honors us for our pains Recording a thousand wisdoms all our own To celebrate our good and glorious reigns  Arthur Davison Ficke   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THREE POEMS  CHARMIAN S SONG  I m glad I have but a little heart For my heart is very small It makes it free to come and go And no one cares at all  I give my heart for a tender look For a gentle word or touch And the one who has it never knows And it does not hurt me much  If my heart were great and I gave it away Then all the world would see But my heart is only a little thing And it does not trouble me  I may give my little heart unseen  It is so small and light And only very wakeful things Can hear it cry at night  FOR ALL LADIES OF SHALOTT  The web flew out and floated wide Poor lady I was with her then She gathered up her piteous pride But she could never weave again   Aline Kilmer  The mirror cracked from side to side I saw its silver shadows go The curse has come on me she cried Poor lady I had told her so  She was so proud she would not hide She only laughed and tried to sing But singing in her song she died She did not profit anything  THE HEART KNOWETH ITS OWN BITTERNESS  The heart knoweth If this be true indeed Then the thing that I bear in my bosom is not a heart For it knows no more than a hollow whispering reed That answers to every wind I am sick of the thing I think we had better part  My heart would come to any piper s calling A fool in motley that dances for any king But my body knows and its tears unbidden falling Say that my heart has sinned You would have my heart You may I am sick of the thing  Aline Kilmer   BACKWATER  A CHILDISH TALE  Listen to my childish tale My heart was sad today My heart was so sad I could not find Anything to say  I walked out to the city s edge Where the streets all disappear And I thought the fields were sad with me Songless fields and drear  I sat down under a maple tree That rose up lone and bare Its dying colored leaves were strewn About me everywhere  I sat and pondered aimlessly Under the silent tree I pondered sadly under the boughs That I thought were sad with me  Then in a flash I felt a cool And steely serenity Descending from those silent boughs They were not sad with me   Edward Sapir  And I felt the steely calm of their strength Slip in my heart like a breath And I was like a wakened man That had drowsed away in death  I saw that steel was the maple tree It had never been sad with me I saw that the blue of the sky was steel In its cool serenity  We were all steel out there in the field We three beyond the town We three that were strong over the leaves Dying in red and brown  Now you have heard my childish tale My heart was sad today And it lost its sadness under a tree That is all I wanted to say  THE OLD TOWN  Oh let me not enter the old town The straggling street Oh I fear I fear the going down On stumbling feet  Oh let me not grope down the dim way To the pitchy sea   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Unlit of a moon or a dim ray Through a cavernous tree  All all they will take from me By the black shore The ancients will steal me silently The purple I wore  They will steal my love they will steal my hate I shall tremble bare They will make my body cold and straight And lay me there  Where my childhood sleeps forever and ever Oh I fear I fear the town that ever and ever I m coming near  OVERLOOKED  I was nothing though I had a kind of pain or feeling I knew her hair I think it might be said I knew too well but I was nothing To her but air  That other one he knew her eyes with only half a knowing I knew her eyes I think it might be said I knew too well whom he was loving Yes he was wise   Edward Sapir  Oh well and they are wed I might indulge in grieving or in smiling I hardly dare You see it wasn t very much I was to her nothing Nothing but air  SHE SITS VACANT EYED  Surely surely there is something for me There is something to fill my spirit s measure Winds tell rains tell Somewhere somewhere is my treasure  They promised it me when a raven spoke Back in the reaches of maidenhood He spoke for God he spoke well I am groping for what I then understood  Ten thousand pathways ran to treasure The raven spoke I saw the vision Suns burn moons burn God God I am sitting in prison  Surely surely there is something for me There is something to fill my spirit whole Sun burn sun burn Pity me make a blaze of my soul  Edward Sapir   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TONIGHT  SNOW  This night my body is an offering I am carried to you Years I was near you And you were far But tonight of all nights Was not the night To be parted  I would fain go forth  And seek you  And sink down by you  As the flakes falling outside  Sink into the cushioned ground  And that which is me Is also a field Glowing and boundless  PRESENCE  You Your presence Why can I not dip into your presence as I dip into sleep clasp it and bask in it How hold it How savour it It is more than I wanted And less   Muriel Ciolkowska  Now you have left you in whose presence I would steep around whose presence I hover like a gull over the lake And ere I have tasted it your presence is no more your presence  You have left You have returned to me Your presence no longer disturbs me from you  Muriel Ciolkowska  OFF THE HIGHWAY  Lilacs lift leaves of cool satin And blossoms of mother of pearl Against the tarnished silver of the deserted house Tall exquisite grasses fill the door yard with spray Through the sun drenched fragrance drifts the hazy mono  tone of bees Tints of opal and jade the hush of emerald shadows And a sense of the past as a living presence Distil a haunting wistful peace  Julia Weld Huntington   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PAGEANTRY  REVELATIONS  Crystals of light  Like raindrops  Beat down about my head  And I kneel low to receive them  Reverently  POISE  I must step  From star to star  Amid the shadowed planets  That hang in the profound deepness  Of bottomless space  With thin clouded draperies  Filming about my feet  In eddies of motion  My path is as wide  As the pageantry of worlds  That fling themselves out  In the dance of fettered motion  And I shall stride  As though all were still  Amy Bonner   CHARLOTTE BRONTE  On reading her letters to M Héger  O proud O passionate what desperate pain Subdued that haughty soul that iron will Bowed that stiff neck wore that wild spirit till  It bit the dust and broken rose again  What feverish trembling fingers held the pen Which traced those delicate characters the cry Of one too hungry hearted plain and shy  Baffled and stung by the strange moods of men  Discarded fragments eloquent and rare Carelessly torn by man without regret Roughly sewn up with some parts missing yet  How many a woman s heart lies bleeding there  Blanche Dismorr  TRAILING ARBUTUS  Why do you hide beneath the pines and cling to earth Infrequent foolish flower of fragrant breath Your blossoms fresh and pink like babies at their birth Your twigs as brown and brittle as old women at their death  Ruth Mason Rice   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  LONG DAYS  I have watched long days of dawning And long long nights of dread And I am a little weary Of traveling toward the dead When I looked out last evening I thought the wan moonlight Seemed tired and pale with shining A lantern in the night  I heard them whisper this morning As I heard them yesterday Do you think she will last much longer Dragging along this way Her hands are like withered flowers Her face is a strange dried leaf She has stayed too long in her body She is wheat turned dust in the sheaf  HEAPHY HERSELF  When Heaphy the old woman Is not looking Herself trips lightly off to Donegal And there dances in the shadow of Slieve  When Heaphy the old woman Is looking   Dorothy McVickar  Herself has never a chance at the dancing But stays in the kitchen Mopping the floor  Dorothy McVickar  YOUTH AND AGE  Youth has music on his lips And in his hurrying feet Rhythm in his finger tips And in his laughter sweet  Age has silence on his tongue Never a note or sound But his heart is often wrung By music all around  Youth has tongue but lacks an ear He whistles pipes and sings Age is still but he can hear Silence and growing things  Elizabeth Hart Perirteli   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REPETITIONS  I plunge at the rearing hours Life is a steed of pride Who so high above me towers I cannot mount and ride  TWO SEWING  The wind is sewing with needles of rain With shining needles of rain It stitches into the thin Cloth of earth in In in in Oh the wind has often sewed with me One two three  Spring must have fine things To wear like other springs Of silken green the grass must be Embroidered One and two and three Then every crocus must be made So subtly as to seem afraid Of lifting color from the ground And after crocuses the round Heads of tulips and all the fair Intricate garb that Spring will wear The wind must sew with needles of rain With shining needles of rain   Hazel Hall  Stitching into the thin Cloth of earth in In in in For all the springs of futurity One two three  INSTRUCTION  My hands that guide a needle In their turn are led Relentlessly and deftly As a needle leads a thread  Other hands are teaching My needle when I sew I feel the cool thin fingers Of hands I do not know  They urge my needle onward They smooth my seams until The worry of my stitches Smothers in their skill  All the tired women Who sewed their lives away Speak in my deft fingers As I sew today   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THREE SONGS FOR SEWING  I  A fibre of rain on a window pane Talked to a stitching thread  In the heaviest weather I hold together The weight of a cloud  To the fibre of rain on a window pane The talkative stitches said I hold together with the weight of a feather The heaviest shroud  II  My needle says Don t be young Holding visions in your eyes Tasting laughter on your tongue  Be very old and very wise And sew a good seam up and down In white cloth red cloth blue and brown  My needle says What is youth But eyes drunken with the sun Seeing farther than the truth  Lips that call hands that shun The many seams they have to do In white cloth red cloth brown and blue   Hazel Hall  III  One by one one by one Stitches of the hours run Through the fine seams of the day Till like a garment it is done And laid away  One by one the days go by And suns climb up and down the sky One by one their seams are run As Time s untiring fingers ply And life is done  COWARDICE  Discomfort sweeps my quiet as a wind Leaps at trees and leaves them cold and thinned Not that I fear again the mastery Of winds for holding my indifference dear I do not feel illusions stripped from me And yet this is a fear A fear of old discarded fears of days That cried out at irrevocable ways I cower for my own old cowardice For hours that beat upon the wind s broad breast With hands as impotent as leaves are this Robs my new hour of rest   I thought my pride had covered long ago All the old scars like broken twigs in snow I thought to luxuriate in rich decay As some far seeing tree upon a hill But startled into shame for an old day I find that I am but a coward still  FLASH  I am less of myself and more of the sun The beat of life is wearing me To an incomplete oblivion Yet not to the certain dignity Of death They cannot even die Who have not lived  The hungry jaws Of space snap at my unlearned eye And time tears in my flesh like claws  If I am not life s if I am not death s Out of chaos I must re reap The burden of untasted breaths Who has not waked may not yet sleep  Hazel Hall   COMMENT  SOUTHERN SHRINES  EVERY traveler may be his own Columbus for every journey is a voyage of discovery leading mayhap to the promised land The editor setting out for a few talks about poetry in the warm and mellow South discovered rich quarries in the blossoming landscape and ships of magic ready to set sail from the shores all guarded by local loyalties jealously excited and aware  In other words she seemed to find a stirring of new beauty in the hearts of the people as well as in the spring garlanded fields and hills and an enthusiasm of preparation a feeling of expectancy as if efflorescence must be as simple and inevitable in art as in nature Sow the seed till the soil and the harvest will surely follow such would seem to be the faith of the new South the South which loves its traditions but refuses to be enslaved by them which is not satisfied to sit in colonial houses and contemplate its historic and romantic past  To be sure there are spinsters in Charleston and Savannah who still live on tea and toast in the midst of faded splendor rather than sell ancestral portraits by Sully and Romney or even a single mahogany hautboy or old Lowestoft plate grandes dames of the old regime who stay indoors rather than replace the carriage and pair with an automobile And there are college professors to whom Sidney Lanier uttered the last audible word of poetry who even in extreme cases re   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  sent the present neglect of Timrod But the nephews and nieces and grandchildren of these ultra loyalists are forming poetry and art societies and little theatre enterprises and inviting up to date people like Carl Sandburg and Daniel  A Reed to help give them a good start And they are aiming at a frank expression of the locale in their exhibitions and poems and play productions a special stress which is much to be desired because the beauty of that moss hung landscape and the dramatic contrasts of feeling in the spirit of the bi racial people are a sufficient basic motive for putting those south eastern Atlantic states more adequately on the modern artistic map  Columbia South Carolina was the first full stop of the editor s pilgrimage In its little Town Theatre the adroit reformation of a quaint old house Mr Reed trained in the Chicago Little Theatre and seconded by a group of enthusiasts is offering a generous hospitality to all the arts Plays exhibitions lectures readings musicals all find audience room here and a congenial atmosphere of challenging sympathy Even the quiet old University of South Carolina a few steps away up the hill seems to welcome this modern interloper into the old state capital and to cooperate in the stirring up process which its presence implies And it is not easy to be stirred up under the languid southern sun in towns whose every old mossy brick and stone is sacred but whose occasional sky scraper seems an anachronism  Proud Charleston was the second stage Charleston as   Southern Shrines  indomitable as ever as unchangeably a beautiful great lady of heroic spirit and aspect What Charleston wills she does not in the bravoura Chicago manner by a bubbling up of helter skelter democratic forces but by a haughty wave of her queenly hand the grand gesture of the assured aristocrat who never dreams of denial Today she wills the arts she is restoring her old houses summoning her painters to local exhibitions and creating the Poetry Society of South Carolina with its two hundred members professional and amateur and its critical committees to pass on poems and award numerous prizes Du Bose Heyward Beatrice Ravenel and others are leaders in this effort to turn the local ambition toward the arts also one or two painters who recognize the pictorial charm of the colonial houses with their grilled gateways and of the moss draped semi tropical landscape  The wealth of historic tradition and association in Charleston may well be a hope and an agony in the heart of any poet who loves her for no art has yet expressed it adequately The old houses bring something of it home to us houses spaciously planned for patriarchal slave holding families stately enough for eighteenth century banquets and of an elegance befitting the crinoline of Victorian emotions houses therefore inconsiderate of modern needs imprisoning many a pathetic comedy of servantless impecuniosity and perhaps now and then a tragedy of some free spirit beating its wings against ancient barriers One wonders at neither excess of loyalty so beautiful is the curve of old mansions along the Battery against the wide blue water of the harbor   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  so full of charm are the fading memories the lavender scented relics of more leisurely better mannered days  If Charleston is a great lady Savannah is a fine one Charleston commands and Savannah persuades She is tempted to sit dreaming over her past to linger in the two old moss hung graveyards whose mournful beauty is a wonder story all over the world Children were romping in the Colonial Cemetery while I scanned its eloquent monuments but they avoided the most eloquent of all that bitter memorial of a suicide with four coiled serpents carved in the four square stone under the inverted marble urn as the only record of a nameless agonist But Savannah does not forget that she is one of the great ports of the world with all Spanish America to the south of her and now and then she salutes the future with a sky scraper Or even with a poetry society a little one The Prosodists she calls it to show that its five members are students of technique  Jacksonville is frankly modern with more sky scrapers than colonial houses And the cause of modern poetry of modern art is eagerly sponsored by the Round Table Club whose membership is both professional and amateur Marx  G Sabel whose second POETRY group will appear in June is one of its officers  From young Jacksonville it is only an hour or two by motor to old St Augustine But even in St Augustine the invading tourist demands a compromise between old and new and gets a swept and garnished guide regulated museum fort a quaint little gate guarded ancient street for his   Southern Shrines  modern trinket shops and numerous ultra modern hotels disguised in pseudo Spanish architecture St Augustine is on the high road in full season it seems less atmospheric than San Antonio and far less intact than drowsy old Santa Fe still lisping Spanish to her aboriginal pueblos But it has corners to which one may retire with the past a little old graveyard an ancient church or two certain mossy walls And perhaps the most wonderful corner of all is that barrel vaulted guardroom of the old fort whose damp masonry is fringed to the top with delicate maidenhair  A contrasting episode though ultra modern seemed blessed with timelessness like all other simple and elemental experiences This was a flight in a passenger aeroplane over the white sands and blue water of Atlantic Beach The sensation oh merely a feeling of being joyously at ease like a bird as we sailed slowly through the warm blue sky and looked down at the fishes in the rippling sea and the automobiles crawling over the long white strip of sand and at the cottage roofs and the stretch of marsh with its ribbon twist of river It seemed strange that men had waited these thousands of years to do a thing so natural so inevitable  From Jacksonville I followed the northward trail of the blossoming spring stopping at Atlanta s suburb Decatur for a day in the Agnes Scott College which has a course in modern poetry and at Bowling Green Kentucky where new oil wells are piercing the century old farms and new ideas the patriarchal before the war traditions and finally at Louisville where Cale Young Rice Hortense Flexner   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  King and others keep the muse s fires alight and where Otto  A Rothert convinced that Madison Cawein was one of the immortals is devoting years to the preparation of a monumental Life and Letters complete enough to satisfy the demands of the poet s vociferous future fame  The journey was another reminder of the variety and potential richness of culture of imaginative and spiritual life in these far flung United States The problem is of course to make the local loyalties generously productive and creative instead of narrowly exclusive and prejudicial to sweep away hindrances between the imaginative energy of elect souls and the adequate expression of that energy in the arts and in life The energy is there of that I was once more convinced during this southern journey but against its vital force rise always the dead walls of conservative repression  The people there as elsewhere must learn that beauty is created from within it cannot be inherited from the past or imported from over seas or manufactured for passive minds by theatrical and movie syndicates and subserviently popular writers and artists It is an achievement of the individual soul and if the individual soul fails to achieve it to create its own beauty in some one of the innumerable art impulses or spiritual impulses of life something within that soul turns to dust and ashes And what is true of the individual is true of the group hand me down art and literature hand me down ethics morals politics the ready made everywhere the self created crowded out speeded away this is the dusty ashen threat against our modern civilization  H M   The Death of B L T  THE DEATH OF B L T  The Line came to a full stop with the passing of Bert Leston Taylor on the nineteenth of March Who now will carry on the column that made Chicago famous the column of wit and wisdom founded in the old Record by Eugene Field of happy memory and built up in the Tribune as a finely whimsical all American monument by the genial genius who has gone  It would be difficult to set bounds to the influence of this witty wise man who so modestly so humanely so urbanely disguised in kindly humor his good judgment and good taste The warmth of his sympathy mellowed the penetrating keenness of his satire he never expected too much of the so called human race and always felt himself a fellow offender in its inexplicable derelictions and vagaries  In music art literature he was a sane and penetrating critic a word in The Line went further than many long reviews to set some clamorous best seller in its place or promote some shy work of beauty His column was an open book of the amenities Henry Kitchell Webster in his memorial address called it a daily letter to his friends classing him with Gray and Fitzgerald among the great letter writers of the world  But he ranks also with Frederick Locker and Austin Dobson with Oliver Wendell Holmes and Thomas Bailey Aldrich and Eugene Field among the best of the ever to begratefully remembered lyrists of the drawing room and no we don t have drawing rooms now a days of the living   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  room and library One might quote an hundred poems to prove it we choose Canopus because it is not better than many others but possibly a keener self revelation  When quacks with pills political would dope us When politics absorbs the livelong day I like to think about the star Canopus So far so far away  Greatest of visioned suns they say who list era To weigh it science always must despair Its shell would hold our whole dinged solar system Nor ever know twas there  When temporary chairmen utter speeches And frenzied henchmen howl their battle hymns My thoughts float out across the cosmic reaches To where Canopus swims  When men are calling names and making faces And all the world s ajangle and ajar I meditate on interstellar spaces And smoke a mild seegar  For after one has had about a week of The arguments of friends as well as foes A star that has no parallax to speak of Conduces to repose  Thus one felt heights and depths in this man against which he measured sublunary affairs His gayest word was always in scale always had perspective So it is not surprising that he was thoroughly at home in the woods and all wild places of nature as some of the finest of his more serious poems The Road to Anywhere for example prove  He died in the spring time as he wished Let us hope that the white throat whose music is sweet as April s sun will sing over his grave H M   The Poet and Modern Life  THE POET AND MODERN LIFE  The problems confronting the modern poet are exceedingly complex How can poetry which is essentially order affirmation achievement be created in an age a milieu of profound doubt and discouragement How is it possible to build up a spiritual monument when the most necessary elements are lacking in a period of social disorder mental anarchy when so very few are at all concerned with intellectual progress and so many are utterly bounded by material progress How again is the poet to obtain the ideas and knowledge which are the matter he works with when he is simply confused by an immeasurable discord a vast unsynthesized knowledge And does not this situation undeniable I think and so much more acute than it was fifty years ago lend strength to Matthew Arnold s pessimism and force us to conclude that now if ever must be an age of criticism an age of pure conservation if any intellectual life is to survive the dying of the Renaissance The narrow ideas of comfort and utilitarianism which are the motive force of the contemporary revolution must of necessity be unfruitful in the larger sphere of the mind In our progress we have become curiously abased from the Hellenic dream of god like man in harmony with nature from the mediaeval dream of man transcending nature through religion from the Renaissance dream which infused a new life into Hellenism from those centuries when the life of the senses and the intelligence struggled with the life of the spirit and sentiment we have fallen into an apathy of discouragement   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  where we hope for no more than that each individual should conform to modern standards of living Man exists spiritually as he conceives of himself and the modern world conceives of man through a vague deceptive mist of social reform as an animal which eats drinks is clothed travels and needs to be amused add to this a little confused education a little tepid religion and a fair amount of ancient superstition revived as new thought and you get a not too incorrect picture of the modern world and its motives Deep spiritual enthusiasm and energy disinterested thought unfettered intelligence profound culture where will you find a combination of these essentials of poetry  Meanwhile we go on writing many just echoing the words of their predecessors some trying to strike out rough new images of vitality a few trying to add to mere vitality the mellowness of culture the permanence of intelligence Certain writers impatient with that mere aping of a vanished order which is unhappily the mark of modern poetry in England have thrown violently aside the reflective the intellectual aspects of their art to create something which is essentially only vital This is preferable to stagnation but it is not nearly enough I should like to see that vitality more mellow saturated with fertile ideas enlightened for so far it has done little but interpret a violent material activity How indeed could it do more The essential elements are lacking for without an intelligent enlightened cultivated milieu each poet speaks into pandemonium loses himself in confusion or in egotism in provincialism R A    REVIEWS  PASTELS  Poems by Haniel Long Moffat Yard amp Co  In this slim volume Haniel Long presents his rhymed lyrics in their various colors pastel transparents romantic and oriental opaques W e miss the free verse student sketches which Alfred Kreymborg includes in his Others for 1919 As usual the free verse medium seems to make the poet relax and be natural in it Mr Long sees and feels with clean honest lines washing in his emotions with their own colors In the best of his rhymed lyrics he works through a group of imperfect songs played on pipes rather than on a lute or a lyre In this group Madness Midnight Sun With Compliments Song of Young Burbage The Winter Sprite I Gather Treasures of the Dark each has a promise which unfolds to an art achievement in a pagan pastoral idyl of real beauty The Herd Boy  The night I brought the cows home  Blue mist was in the air  And in my heart was heaven  And on my lips a prayer  I raised my arms above me I stretched them wide apart And all the world was pressing In beauty on my heart  The lane led by a river Along an ancient wood And ancient thoughts came softly As with the leaves they should   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I hung the cows with garlands And proud they walked before While mother naked after A laurel branch I bore The other poems in this vein go scurrying through surfaces painted in transparents over nothing rhyming insignificantly The poet s attempt at wilder pagan freedom is weakened by a natural love for pastoral restraint or is it an academic inhibition Mr Long s more colorful dipping into the romantic is rather limp and in the panoramic his sweep is tight The Death of Alexander the Great lacks the freedom and flare of pageantry which we find quite glorious in his free verse Student group when he would have his girl enter his  class room window On the elephant s trunk  In his rhymed pageantry it is as if he were trying to blow a fanfare of trumpets on his pipes However in Dead Men and the Moon Dead Men Tell No Tales and His Deaths there is the swagger and color of truth romantically expressed perhaps romance truthfully expressed  The Cuban in the States lacks Spanish feeling and interest The pitch is too high in his remote tropical effects the tone too thin the touch too cool not enough of the green eyed serpent subtleties There Was a City Where Serpents Writhed comes nearer finding the remote than Gifts And the war poems are too personal they look puny against the conflict War is a stride in the ages an impressionistic record from a gigantic panorama Laura Sherry   Silence Awakening  SILENCE AWAKENING  Terra Italica by Edward Storer The Egoist London  Mr Edward Storer is not typical of the English poets of today he may have some of their virtues and weaknesses but he has others which are peculiar to himself He is English in his clinging to decoration to suavity he is English in a kind of inarticulateness which prevents his saying all the fine things that are in him but he is un English in his profound and unaffected love of beauty he is un English inasmuch as he hates quaintness The rough strength of the vital poet is not his when he tries to interpret modern life he fails because this life is so alien so hostile to his subtler conceptions He makes me think of some pupil of Heine intoxicated by Heine s adoration of Hellenic beauty but most un German in that the ideas he works with are very few and simple Moreover that English love of decoration leads him away from Heine s fine simplicity though one feels how Mr Storer struggles against this national vice how he has lived with the classics to purge and lighten his mind of all the sluggish barbarity still adhering to the English character His earlier work fragile and imaginative lacked strength but never sweetness his new book retains this Ovid like sweetness and has gained strength the strength of brevity and thought and therefore it is his best Intentionally or unintentionally he had criticised his own poetry in these words  It is so near to silence as to seem Silence awakening   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A listening rather sweet A mood evaporating That has entered in To all your spirit Numbing it with peace Oozed to the very core of you With ethereal sweet A vaporous light Luminance rarified Yet dewy with the sap of earth Bitter a little From the great salt sea  But let me not be misunderstood in pointing to a weakness in this fine highly wrought poetry I do not mean to imply any inferiority to the poetry of vitality The weakness in Mr Storer s poetry is the weakness of much thought much emotion much living of a cultivated mind turning in disappointment and discouragement from the present to linger in imagination over the happier past with a charm a lightness an elegance wholly delightful The melancholy the skepticism the discouragement of these poems their sad devotion to a lost ideal of beauty their haunting insistence on the Horatian theme of  the dream called life Rosy with a little love Quick with sharp sorrows  are certainly delightful to react to in certain moods yet typical of that unavowed but deep despair which holds so many sensitive minds in a distracted Europe R A   Country Sentiment  COUNTRY SENTIMENT  Fairies and Fusiliers and Country Sentiment by Robert  Graves Alfred A Knopf  The poetry of Robert Graves compares with the mass of good modern poetry especially in the United States as the trim well ordered English farm compares with the vast cattle ranch of Wyoming or the great wheat farm of North Dakota Mr Graves has chosen a small field withal one chosen by many English poets before him He tills it well and it brings forth lovely blossoms if not always luscious satisfying fruit  Melody everyday humanness fancy quiet whimsy chivalry these are words that come to mind as one reads Mr Graves verse They represent qualities found in Skelton in Surrey or in Herrick poets in whose tradition Mr Graves would probably class himself One gets the impression that the author studies rather than observes as when the boy stays away from church and goes walking  To ponder there in quiet God s Universal Plan  These are the boy s own words Such boys exist only in eighteenth century English paintings Generally however Mr Graves presents clear vivid pictures as in Finland  The skies are jewelled all around The ploughshare snaps in the iron ground The Finn with face like paper And eyes like a lighted taper Hurls his rough rune   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  At the wintry moon And stamps to mark the tune Country Sentiment shows an advance over the author s first book in story telling and dramatic power in hardness and cleanness of expression  Here they lie who once learned here All that is taught of hurt or fear Dead but by free will they died They were true men they had pride

Brace amp Howe  Contemporary Verse Anthology edited by Charles Wharton Stork E P Dutton amp Co The above list is a slight indication of the present rush   Recent Anthologies  of anthologies and incidentally it is proof of a public for modern poetry a public however too eager for pre digested food too eager to lean upon the opinions of editors and publishers Perhaps this is inevitable in these crowded days no one can read everything even in one specialty But the public should choose its anthologies carefully avoiding those whose motives are frankly commercial  Our list may be divided into four groups The first includes those anthologies intended to introduce a group of young poets connected by similar ideals or perhaps merely by acquaintance or propinquity second subject anthologies third resumes of a period or a locale fourth reprints from special magazines  Under the first heading there is no suspicion of a commercial motive The poems included in such collections may be well or ill chosen the new claimants for the laurel may be raw or crude affected or supersophisticated or they may be young geniuses trying their wings but at least the publisher is making room for the unknown and taking a gambler s chance with the public The first two titles listed above are of this kind and although neither pamphlet contains any very exciting evidences of genius a variety of talent fictional critical limnal and musical as well as poetic is displayed in an admirable typographic setting The two miscellanies though of recent work are not confined to undergraduates the first including names like Robert Graves and Edith Sitwell In poetry the most I had almost said the only interesting exhibits are in a mood of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  sarcasm verging on the

grieve these are two curious examples of publishers efforts to attract a special public Lilly gay An Anthology of Anonymous Poems is more intriguing with its lively little wood cuts by Eric and Percy West Its cheering lyrics and ballads must be centuries old at least some of them are the beautiful Lyke wake Dirge for example and no reviewer would be mean spirited enough to guess at a later origin for others  Of our third class Mr Untermeyer s Modern British Poetry is the only example It is a companion to his rather elementary Modern American Poetry both running from 1870 to 1920 and being intended especially for young students In the latter case one was forced to wonder at the poor showing of a rich period but the British volume may be a little more satisfactory  In our fourth class of magazine anthologies the Yale Review book opens with The Passing Strange one of Mr Masefield s finest meditative poems and its other entries by Messrs Robinson Frost Fletcher Sassoon Mmes Teasdale Wharton and other poets show that this magazine has done generous work in this department  As good manners would almost debar us from reviewing the anthology of our most steadfast fellow specialist in modern poetry we shall permit the editor of Contemporary Verse Mr Charles Wharton Stork to speak for himself in regard to his anthology which brings together the more notable poems from several years issues of his magazine In the Introduction he says   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Most of the other magazines we thought were over stressing the appeal of novelty We believed that the growing power of American poetry could be shown to express itself in forms that an average person could enjoy The great universal motives of the race love of home delight in outdoor nature generous human sympathy kindly humor and a quiet first hand religious sense all of these will be found in abundance  However  A moderate number of free verse ventures have been included where genuineness of feeling and beautiful handling of its changing rhythms have seemed to justify the exceptions  And the editor inquires  Where one may ask is one likely to find more American idealism than in a volume such as this  Perhaps one may question Mr Stork s conclusion He  says  The American people has a right to ask that poetry should express the thoughts and emotions of this generation in a style which can be widely understood and appreciated  Do poets worthy of the name take orders even from  that formidable connoisseur the American people  The haphazard arrangement of the book makes appraise  ment difficult the poems are quite ungrouped whether by  subjects or authorship However one may find by search  ing Joyce Kilmer s gay dialogue The Ashman Edwin Ford  Piper s Gee up dar Mules and a few fine lyrics by Sara  Teasdale E Merrill Root Marx G Sabel Helen Hoyt  and one or two others H M   French Poets in English  FRENCH POETS IN ENGLISH  Fleurs de Lys translated and edited by Wilfred Thorley  Houghton Mifflin Co  The introduction to this anthology is so lucid and com  plete that the reader expects equally competent translations It sets forth briefly but well a history of the poets of France from the thirteenth century to the present day showing how their personalities were affected by their times analyzing their methods of work and estimating their values in as fair a manner as is possible to foreign thought And throughout we find those who would translate urged to keep to the spirit rather than the word of the original With all this in mind it is a shock to turn to the opening poem which reads like a Scotch ballad Here is one stanza  The mirk did fa lang syne lang syne  When twa fond systres wi hands that twine  Went doun to bathe whaur the waters shine  Blaw wind bend beugh in the stormy weather  They that be leel sleep saft taegither  Clearly the author of this anthology has as he says attempted to match the French language as closely as possible with that of the same period in English literature He has followed this plan with all his translations of old French and it seems to me a grave mistake even an affectation For the flavor which should infuse its spirit into the English is altogether missed  Mr Thorley has done better with the more modern poems He says is his introduction   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The real task of a translator is that of re creating and unless he can bring to his original as much as he takes from it he had far better leave it alone  But he has sometimes fallen short of his theories as in his  renderings of Gautier L Art the oft attempted has been  translated better by Dobson or Santayana Again he says  It is so difficult to keep rightly informed and critically aloof amid the trumpeting and disparagement of rival clans whose activities seem only to bewilder the native doctors that a mere foreigner may be forgiven for including frankly what happens to appeal to him  And he has given evidence of his critical aloofness in The Cloud considered one of the most delicate of the Émaux et Camées Of this he has done into English only three of the original nine stanzas omitting the whole point of the poem which seems hardly fair to the author  The renderings of Baudelaire are especially fine They have the spirit of the French and yet truly a rare achievement they do not read like translations Mallarmé s Apparition keeps the subtle savor of the original The author has been less happy with the ten versions of Verlaine Maeterlinck is represented by only one poem The Seven Maids of Orlamonde a questionable choice but well translated Autumn and Cleopatra by Samain are beautifully presented Rodenbach s In Tiny Townships is as musical in English as in French Of the translations of de Régnier The Secret and Experience are excellent while good renderings of Vielé Griffin Fort Bataille Gregh Guérin and many other poets give distinction to this anthology  Agnes Lee Freer   Symbolists and Decadents  SYMBOLISTS AND DECADENTS  La Mêlée Symboliste by Ernest Raynaud La Renaissance  du Livre Paris  Here is an example of the fine book making of La Renaissance du Livre Consisting of reminiscences of the author and his poet companions it suggests Gautier s La Fenêtre Ouverte and is equally fascinating  A chapter on Les Zutistes founded by Charles Cros describes the Café de Versailles where every evening this leader gathered about him such men as Coppée Richepin and Raoul Ponchon Here Louis Marsolleau recited sentimental bagatelles or noble poems and here Poussin was made to read over and over again his artistic achievement La Jument Morte which resounded through the breweries of the Latin Quarter for several seasons But what assured this order aside from the renown of Charles Cros a place in history was that it was the cradle of a lyric evolution in which perhaps the two most prominent figures were Laurent Tailhade and Jean Moréas From their fruitful controversies arose the new movement Here is a portrait of Jean Moréas at that time  He always went gloved in white corseted tightly his glossy hair curled in the latest fashion wearing a multicolored cravat and a flower in his buttonhole His timid nature was hidden under brusque mannerisms and he fortified himself with an insolent monocle His hatred of mediocrity was expressed in brief aphorisms And Tailhade draped himself like a Spaniard in a black scarlet lined cape Full of anecdote and wit he offset the disdainful haughtiness of Moréas toward bad poets by firing at them a volley of cleverness No one knew as he did how to use irony and unctuous epigram   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  At this time the two were merely at their début their period of dilettantism Later they were to descend from their ivory tower to write for the periodical Lutèce wherein Verlaine had already begun to print his Poetes Maudits Lutece once a banal gazette of the Latin Quarter was becoming the official organ of advancing symbolism To this paper we are indebted for poems by Paul Adam Rachilde Henri de Régnier Jules Laforgue Francis Vielé Griffin and Ernest Raynaud According to Raynaud Lutece which came to its end in 1886 had the glory of devoting itself entirely to the poets of the new school who wrote for it their best and worst poems  To me one of the most interesting things in this little volume is the discovery of the origin of the word décadent Verlaine was sick in bed his confrères gathered about him On the bed lay a magazine in coarse gray paper Someone took it up and read mockingly from the cover Le Décadent and asked What imbecile invented this ridiculous title I am the imbecile challenged a crisp voice The author turned and saw Anatole Baju a little man with flaming eyes set in a wizened face The history as given by Raynaud of this founder of Le Décadent is very entertaining Verlaine who ardently supported the magazine defines its purpose thus  Décadence is Sardanapalus in the midst of his women setting the torch to his funeral pile it is Seneca reciting poems as he opens his veins it is Petronius masking his agony with flowers it is the marchioness walking to the guillotine with a smile and with care not to disturb her coiffure Décadence is the art of dying beautifully   Symbolists and Decadents  Le Décadent raised a hue and cry from the symbolists yet their aims against the literature then in vogue were alike Both wanted to be freed from form which had outlived itself  A L F  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  TWO NEW MAGAZINES  We welcome two new magazines which are to be devoted wholly or largely to poetry The Measure published by Frank Shay at 4 Christopher Street New York and The Double dealer from 204 Baronne Street New Orleans The former began in March the latter in January  The Measure A Journal of Poetry is thus advertised Edited by Maxwell Anderson Padraic Colum Agnes Kendrick Gray Carolyn Hall Frank Ernest Hill David Morton Louise Townsend Nicholl George O Neil Genevieve Taggard From these nine an acting editor and an assistant are elected quarterly by the board  W e are much interested in this experiment of a shifting editorial board As fellow editors we wonder how it will be arranged will each pair of acting editors accept only the exact number of poems to be used in their own three numbers and return all others or will there be hold overs from one quarterly editorial pair to the next hold overs accepted by the first pair and perhaps despised by the second and third and fourth At any rate so populous an editorial board with a three months elective tenure of office makes for variety relieving the editors of the danger of satiety and the magazine of a too monotonous consistency   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The first number while not exciting is competent and interesting There is nothing revolutionary but there are characteristic poems by Padraic Colum Robert Frost Conrad Aikin Alfred Kreymberg Hazel Hall and others we know besides two or three less familiar entries The longest poem Ice Age by Genevieve Taggard asserts once more her unusual promise and Wallace Stevens Cortège for Rosenbloom is a beautiful airy fling of his magician s wand  Maxwell Anderson the first editor seems not over confident in his initial article This is not an age favorable to great poetry he says there are not any great poets writing at this time in English or none so far uncovered The very value of art of life grows dubious And he confesses  The Measure then is a hope against hope a venture in the face of despair a fiddling while Rome burns If The Measure gets hold of an undoubted masterpiece once in its career it will be lucky POETRY of Chicago has come out uninterruptedly for ten years without doing it This is not the fault of the editors of POETRY If there had been masterpieces to print they would have printed them  Not yet ten years only eight and a half so there is still hope But meantime may we remind this despairing young editor that it takes a master to recognize a masterpiece and a slow procession of masters in accord across spaces of time to pronounce the ultimatum  The Double dealer is an auspicious attempt to give the South a literary organ It ought to succeed we hope and trust it will for the South has a right to speak with its own voice and those members of the staff whom we know for   Two New Magazines  example John McClure the New Orleans poet and Vincent  Starrett Chicago correspondent are certainly competent  The local flavor is not yet very strong in the first three  numbers but no doubt that will come Meantime we have  a gay spirited monthly which

and generous imagination of sense and sensitiveness it ranks as easily the best vehicle of poetry in the English language  In the London Times of Nov 25th 1920 we read  We need not linger over the many English and French contributors to this periodical We do have to note that it has published as it honestly claims much of the best experimental poetry written by Americans in the past eight years They have succeeded in their primary design to create a poetry which should be American in thought feeling subject and form That is after all a distinct achievement  The Chicago Evening Post in commenting on POETRY S eighth birthday said  No editorship is infallible but it is rather interesting and enlightening to look over the old numbers of POETRY and to realize that the first important chance for publication in America was given to many poets almost unknown who have since obtained fame We wonder how many more may yet be helped POETRY is so far as we know unique in the length of its
