SEPTEMBER 1914  MONOLITHS  TH E PRAYER  HAVE cried aloud but truly  There are no Gods in the lowlands  I will go to the high hills  To seek my God  I yearn for him   I am eager As the hawk for the high sun For I have cried to Him loudly and the silence Was like the cloak of a black dream  Let them come quickly  And awake me  With singing lest I dream no more   TH E RED BRIDGE  The arches of the red bridge  Are stronger than ever  The arches of the scarlet bridge  Are of rough bleak stone  Why should such massive arches be the span From cloud to tenuous cloud  Let us not seek omens in the guts  Of newly slain fowls Leaving such play to the children Let us pluck wild swans  From under the moon Or challenging strong terrible men Let us slay them and seek truth In their smoking entrails  Let us fling runners  Across the red bridge Deep lunged runners who will return to us With tidings of the far countries And the strange seas  There be many terrible men  Going out upon the bridge  Through the little door  That is by the steps from the river   Monoliths  THE KING  Seven full paunched eunuchs came to me Bearing before them upon a silver shield The secrets of my enemy  As they crossed my threshold to stand With stately and hypocritical gesture In a row before me One stumbled The dull incurious eyes of the others Blazed into no laughter Only a haggard malice At the discomfiture Of their companion  Why should such Thing s have power Not spoken for in the rules of men  I would not receive them With my head covered I motioned them To go forth from my presence  Where shall I find an enemy Worthy of me as him they defaced  As they left me Bearing with them Lewd shield and scarlet crown One paused upon the threshold   Insolent To sniff a flower  Even him I permitted to go forth Safely  Therefore I have renounced my kingdom In a little bronze boat I have set sail Out Upon the sea  There is no land and the sea Is black like the pool of ink In the palm of a soothsayer Is black like the cypresses waiting At midnight in the place of tombs  My boat Fears the white lipped waves That snatch at her Hungrily Furtively As they steal past like cats Into the night And beneath me in their hidden places The great fishes talk of me In a tongue I have forgotten  Skipwith Cannell   THE BLUE SYMPHONY  I  The darkness rolls upward The thick darkness carries with it Rain and a ravel of cloud The sun comes forth upon earth  Palely the dawn Leaves me facing timidly Old gardens sunken And in the gardens is water  Sombre wreck autumnal leaves Shadowy roofs In the blue mist And a willow branch that is broken  O old pagodas of my soul how you glittered across green  trees  Blue and cool Blue tremulously Blow faint puffs of smoke Across sombre pools The damp green smell of rotted wood And a heron that cries from out the water   II  Through the upland meadows I go alone For I dreamed of someone last night Who is waiting for me  Flower and blossom tell me do you know of her Have the rocks hidden her voice They are very blue and still  Long upward road that is leading me Light hearted I quit you For the long loose ripples of the meadow grass Invite me to dance upon them  Quivering grass Daintily poised For her foot s tripping  O blown clouds could I only race up like you Oh the last slopes that are sun drenched and steep  Look the sky Across black valleys Rise blue white aloft Jagged unwrinkled mountains ranges of death  Solitude Silence   The Blue Symphony  III  One chuckles by the brook for me One rages under the stone One makes a spout of his mouth One whispers one is gone  One over there on the water Spreads cold ripples For me Enticingly  The vast dark trees Flow like blue veils Of tears Into the water  Sour sprites Moaning and chuckling What have you hidden from me  In the palace of the blue stone she lies forever Bound hand and foot  Was it the wind That rattled the reeds together  Dry reeds A faint shiver in the grasses   IV  On the left hand there is a temple And a palace on the right hand side Foot passengers in scarlet Pass over the glittering tide  Under the bridge The old river flows Low and monotonous Day after day  I have heard and have seen All the news that has been Autumn s gold and Spring s green  Now in my palace I see foot passengers Crossing the river Pilgrims of autumn In the afternoons  Lotus pools Petals in the water Such are my dreams  For me silks are outspread I take my ease unthinking   The Blue Symphony V And now the lowest pine branch Is drawn across the disk of the sun Old friends who will forget me soon I must go on Towards those blue death mountains I have forgot so long In the marsh grasses There lies forever My last treasure With the hope of my heart The ice is glazing over Torn lanterns flutter On the leaves is snow In the frosty evening Toll the old bell for me Once in the sleepy temple Perhaps my soul will hear Afterglow Before the stars peep I shall creep into the darkness John Gould Fletcher    TH E SERINGA  The seringa casts its petals across the slanting rays of the  sun There are shadows in the grass where they lie I gather them up in my hand And their perfume distends my nostrils and closes my eyes I crush their sweetness in my palm And scatter them back to the grass But in the night a wind will come And the petals whirl hither and thither And the perfume be no more  Oh I will fashion your beauty into a measure To fling it over the housetops And cast it into the meadows Lo in my heart The song of a bird that liveth not in memory And in the shell of a rose A hundred years of Athens or of Rome Though my song die with my breath  Yes though I am dust Though Rome become as Babylon It shall vibrate on a harp that ceaseth not That gathereth all music into itself As the seas all streams  Yet for my joy and for thy beauty s sake Linger sweet perfume till the sun be set  John AIford   CALLE MEMO O LOREDAN  We were staying that night in a very old palace Very dark very large and sheer to the water below The rooms were silent and strange and you were frightened Alice The silver lamp gave a feeble flickering glow  And the bed had a high dark tester and carved black posts And behind our heads was a glimmer of old brocade Do you remember you thought the shadows were full of ghosts And the sound of the lapping water made you afraid  Ah and your face shone pale in the gleam of that quivering flame And your bosom was rich with the round pearls row on row And you looked proud and jeweled and passionate without shame Like some princess who stooped to her lover a long while ago    HILL HOUSE  I remember so well how the table looked that night The shaded candle flames were gentle and bright Caressing the wine and silver Jewels glowed And bosom and wrist moved softly light words flowed And the surface chatter of dinner ran charmingly on  Then you told me of your dream cities that Venice was one  And looking up quickly at eyes now gray now blue For Venice belongs to me as well as to you I thought for a moment I saw your soul shine through  Is it odd for an hour s companion to think such things Swift But dear see how Love and the Soul have wings  Douglas Goldring   TRAÛMEREI AT OSTENDORFF S  I ate at Ostendorff s and saw a dame With eager golden eyes paired with a red  Bald chilled old man Piercing the clatter came Keen Traiimerei On the sound he bowed his head Covered his eyes and looked on things long sped Her white fierce fingers strained but could not stir His close locked hands nor bring him back to her  Let him alone bright lady for he clips A fairer lass than you with all your fire  Let him alone he touches sweeter lips Than yours he hired as others yet shall hire Leave him the quickening pang of clean desire  Even though vain nor taint those spring winds blown  From banks of perished bloom let him alone  Bitter sweet melody that call st to tryst Love from the hostile dark would God thy breath  Might break upon him now through thickening mist The trumpet summons of imperial Death That now with fire clean lips where quivereth  Atoning sorrow he shall seek the eyes  Long turned towards earth from fields of paradise   In vain By virtue of a far off smile Men may be deaf a space to gross behests  Of nearer voices for some little while Sharp pains of youth may burn in old men s breasts But men must eat though angels be their guests  The waiter brought spaghetti he looked up Hemmed blinked and fiddled with his coffee cup  ASCRIPTION  Well wed him then and though there ne er be folded A son in your long arms you shall not be A barren woman having made and molded Whatever marrow of manhood lies in me  William Laird   THE STEAM SHOVEL  Beneath my window in a city street A monster lairs a creature huge and grim And only half believed the strength of him Steel strung and fit to meet The strength of earth Is mighty as men s dreams that conquer force Steam belches from him He is the new birth Of old Behemoth late sprung from the source Whence Grendel sprang and all the monster clan Dead for an age now born again of man  The iron head Set on a monstrous jointed neck Glides here and there lifts settles on the red Moist floor with nose dropped in the dirt at beck Of some incredible control He snorts and pauses couchant for a space Then slowly lifts and tears the gaping hole Yet deeper in earth s flank A sudden race Of loosened earth and pebbles trickles there Like blood drops in a wound But he the monster swings his load around Weightless it seems as air His mammoth jaw Drops widely open with a rasping sound And all the red earth vomits from his maw   O thwarted monster born at man s decree A lap dog dragon eating from his hand And doomed to fetch and carry at command Have you no longing ever to be free In warm electric days to run a muck Ranging like some mad dinosaur Your fiery heart at war With this strange world the city s restless ruck Where all drab things that toil save you alone Have life And you the semblance only and the strife Do you not yearn to rip the roots of stone Of these great piles men build And hurl them down with shriek of shattered steel Scorning your own sure doom so you may feel You too the lust with which your fathers killed Or is your soul in very deed so tame The blood of Grendel watered to a gruel That you are well content With heart of flame Thus placidly to chew your cud of fuel And toil in peace for man s aggrandizement Poor helpless creature of a half grown god Blind of yourself and impotent At night When your forerunners sprung from quicker sod Would range through primal woods hot on the scent Or wake the stars with amorous delight   The Steam Shovel  You stand a soiled unwieldy mass of steel Black in the arc light modern as your name Dead and unsouled and trite Till I must feel A quicker creator s pity for your shame That man who made you and who gave so much Yet cannot give the last transforming touch That with the work he cannot give the wage For day no joy of night For toil no ecstasy of primal rage  Eunice Tietjens   POEMS OF TRAVEL  THE OCEAN LINER  They went down to the sea in ships In ships they went down to the sea In barks hewn of oak tree strips In galleys with skin sewn sails In triremes caravels brigs Frail flimsily rolling rigs They went down where the huge wave rips Where the black storm lashes and hales They went down to the sea in ships To the sounding sorrowing sea  They go down to the sea oh me What ships that outbrave the sea What ships that outrun the gale With a feather of steam for a sail And a whirling shaft for an oar Are the ships that my brothers build To carry me over the sea That my hand with treasures filled May knock at the morrow s door  Steel hulls impenetrable To the waves that tease and pull   Poems of Travel  Bright engines that answer the beat Of their foam slippered dancing feet Hot fires that shudder and drive Close tended untiring sure Like queen bees deep in the hive Who labor and serve and endure All these are down below Far under the slippery water While the babe sleeps soft in his bed And the banquet table is spread And my neighbor s laughing daughter Trims her hair with a rose red bow  They went down to the sea in ships In ships they went down to the sea And the sea had a million lips And she laughed in her gorge for glee And the floor of the sea is strewn With tempest trophies dread And the deep sea currents croon As they wash through the bones of the dead But the ships that my brothers build Ah they mock at the bleak storm s rage And their fiery hearts are thrilled When he throws them his battle gauge On the sea foam they lean for a pillow They drive without paddle or sail   Straight over the mountainous billow Straight on through the blustering gale Oh they shake out gay flags as they run Flags that flutter and gleam in the sun From the tip of their turrets above They send word of the storm to the shore And they hear from afar through the roar Down the cloud built aisles of the sky Some land bound lady s cry To her ocean wandering love  They go down to the sea in ships In ships they go down to the sea And my brothers the masterful free Fear no more the white foam of her lips The sweet wild kiss of the sea They have won her she harks to their wooing The love of ten thousand years The suing the wild undoing The faith unto death the tears Oh their glory her song shall be Soft soft is the kiss of her lips They go down to the sea in ships In ships they go down to the sea   Poems of Travel  A GARDEN IN THE DESERT  So light and soft the days fall Like petals one by one Down from yon tree whose flowers all Must vanish in the sun  Like almond petals down dear Odorous rosy white Falling to our green world here  Off the thick boughs of night  One like another still lies Tomorrow is today Always the buzzing bee flies Who never flies away  Ever the same blue sky rounds Its chalice for the sun The mountains at the world s bounds Their purple chorals run  And ever you and I friend Free of this mortal scheme Look out beyond desire s end And dream the spacious dream   THE GIANT CACTUS OF ARIZONA  The cactus in the desert stands Like time s inviolate sentinel Watching the sun washed waste of sands Lest they their ancient secrets tell And the lost love of mournful lands It knows alone and guards too well  Wiser than Sphynx or pyramid It points a stark hand at the sky And all the stars alight or hid It counts as they go rolling by And mysteries the gods forbid Darken its heavy memory  I asked how old the world was yea And why yon ruddy mountain grew Out of hell s fire By night nor day It answered not though all it knew But lifted as it stopped my way Its wrinkled fingers toward the blue  Inscrutable and stern and still It waits the everlasting doom Races and years may do their will Lo it will rise above their tomb Till the drugged earth has drunk her fill Of sun and falls asleep in gloom   Poems of Travel  IN THE LOUVRE  Queen Karomana slim you stand In bronze with little flecks of gold Queen Karomana O royal lady lift your hand Shatter the stone museum cold Queen Karomana  The wide Nile sleeps the desert stings With color Shake your tresses free Queen Karomana  The sleepy lotus shines and swings Loose your bound limbs and sail with me In a smooth shallop to the sea  Queen Karomana  Queen Karomana still so mute So delicate yet cold as snow Queen Karomana  An ice wind boldly resolute Rippled your thin robe long ago And froze you into bronze I know  But left your garment s flecks of gold And the slim grace men loved of old Queen Karomana   THE TOWER  He built a tower for all to see With sun washed gardens planted wide And there with pomp of pageantry With men at arms and minstrelsy And moon beam ladies fair and free He reveled in his pride And there with soft prayers muttered slow And wind blown candles burning low And hooded mourners row on row In pomp of peace he died  Now time forgets how many a sun Above the waste has risen and run Since all the feasts were over and done Yet still from rusty pinnacle From cobwebbed pane and broken bell A wind voice murmurs Here am I Twas good to live and die And good to rear these carved stones well Twixt laboring earth and dreaming sky And now tis good to watch and wait While the slow centuries pass in state And make old time my glory tell To you who wander by   Poems of Travel  THE CHILDLESS WOMAN  O mother of that heap of clay so passive on your breast Now do you stare at death woman who yesterday were  blest Now do you long to fare afar and guide him on the way Where he must wander all alone his little feet astray  But I now but I now Sons of me seven and seven The high God seals upon the brow And summons from his heaven  Blest as a bride were you woman that time of years agone When love giver of life came close and led you to his throne And blest were you have you forgot when through the moons of pain The life love given tugged at your heart and bound you with its chain But I now but I now Seared by the high God s scorn Lives that will never come to birth Body of me has borne  And when the hour was come woman your dark and perilous hour When the twin spirits Death and Life clutched you with jealous power    Rent by their war you lay half lost until a baby s cry Summoned you forth past world on world to sit with God on high But I now but I now Never my baby s voice Has called me forth from vales of woe With seraphs to rejoice  You in your arms have clasped him woman and fed him at  your breast You sang him little songs at night and lulled him to his rest The ages gone were yours then and yours the years to be You gave him of your hope and saw the light no eye shall see  But I now but I now Sons of me born in dream Cry out for robes of flesh I see Their wistful eyes agleam  O mother of that heap of clay so passive on your breast Now do you stare at death woman nay peace for you are  blest Blest are you in your joy woman blest are you in your pain Once more he calls you past the worlds to sit with God again  But I now but I now Sons of me nine and nine That looked on life and death with me Are neither God s nor mine   Poems of Travel  THE WONDER OF IT  How wild how witch like weird that life should be That the insensate rock dared dream of me And take to bursting out and burgeoning  Oh long ago yo ho And wearing green How stark and strange a thing That life should be  Oh mystic mad a rigadoon of glee That dust should rise and leap alive and flee A foot a wing and shake the deeps with cries  Oh far away yo hay What moony masque what arrogant disguise That life should be  Harriet Monroe  EDITORIAL COMMENT  POETRY AND CRITICISM  Samuel Butler is nowhere wittier than in his characterization of our peculiar Anglo Saxon smugness in criticism For me observes Miss Skinner daughter of the great Dr Skinner during a call of Ernest Pontifex a simple chord of Beethoven is enough  Perhaps nobody exists who would dream of asserting his enjoyment of a painting or a statue in this ridiculous manner nor of looking at a canvas or a modeled figure inch by inch instead of regarding its whole movement and structure  But if one turns to printed comment on poetry one may find Miss Skinners in plenty Those critics appear rather few who enjoy a poem as a distinct entity and as one enjoys a special cordial or a particular piece of fruit cake or the revelation and fresh breath of some green living scene or one s pleasure in the individuality of an acquaintance Many people regard a poem not at all as a unified piece of expression fused and animated by one musical design and spirit but as a collection of separate lines and look at the poet s canvas only through an inch by inch reading glass  This sort of critic is always wondering why Shakespeare said  Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles   Poetry and Criticism  thus violating the rules of somebody or other s college rhetoric rules about mixing metaphores The lay reader and the play goer who are harking to the full and perturbed motion of the act and the verse and Hamlet s mental state will find the phrase merely fitting and expressive in the natural course of the play and of the mood it evokes in the hearer and will not regard the line in isolation from its context more than the observer of Saint Gaudens statue of Lincoln will focus his gaze on some single unfastened button on the emancipator s coat and find the work of art difficult to understand because the sculptor did not place the button in its corresponding button hole  By such sharp disconcerting pounces on detail college professors have done much to render all poetic text unintelligible and to hypnotize the nation into a sincere nervous ignorance of poetry and highly reasonable aversion from it  These sharp pounces on detail are inspired by a prevalent American literary conception that the instinctive mental action of the reader of a poem is not so much to understand still less to like or enjoy a poem as one may understand and enjoy a song one hears pouring out of the window of a stranger s house on one s way down the street of one s own life as to estimate the poem and put it in its place among the metrical productions of the whole world as arranged in one s own mind  This is partly a heritage from our Protestant habit not to say vice of judgment We arrange our known poets or our known poems competitively according to their distance   from some arbitrary goal often one they had never heard of and certainly had no ambition to reach Our poetical criticism is greatly given over to such statements as that Shelley s Sky Lark is the third greatest lyrical poem since Her rick s Bid me to live or that Keats Hyperion ranks second or sixth or seventh among the seven heroic poems in classic diction since Milton s Lycidas  This making of lists this putting of poets and of poems in their places may be continued almost indefinitely The critic who likes to pursue this strange pastime lives in a hallucination in whose haze he supposes that he has actually read all the books in the world or rather that the books he has read constitute all the books there are As no one on earth has ever read all the books there are he could not have a more secure mania sheltered as it is by everyone s vast if more modest ignorance By a mere act of will he may assert and none will gainsay his authority that Since there s no help come let us kiss and part is the third or nineteenth or forty third greatest sonnet of passion Nobody has read all the world s sonnets still less has he observed which of these were unconscious nominees for the office of the first sonnet of passion nor marked his ballot for them nor heard which of them seemed to be the most successful candidate At first glance it appears a dreary circumstance that anyone should prefer the attempt to arrange sonnets of passion in fixed places among the metrical productions of the universe instead of knowing each creation as a piece of human life and expression But considered more philosoph   Poetry and Criticism  ically the phenomenon appears a wise compensation for an irremediable loss  Who loves his friend according to that friend s standing and place in the world Certainly none but the unfortunate person who has never experienced the profound charm of any real friendship In the same way it may be said that no one has ever had the happiness of really reading poetry unless he has cared for a poem sheerly for the truth and beauty of its own enriching presence E W  TH E POETRY OF WAR  Poets have made more wars than kings and war will not cease until they remove its glamour from the imaginations of men  What is the fundamental the essential and psychological cause of war The feeling in men s hearts that it is beautiful And who have created this feeling Partly it is true kings and their armies with banners but far more poets with their war songs and epics sculptors with their statues the assembled arts which have taken their orders from kings their inspiration from battles Kings and artists have united to give to war its glamour to transmute into sounds and colors and forms of beauty its savagery and horror to give heroic appeal to its unreason a heroic excuse to its rage and lust  All this is of the past The race is beginning to suspect those old ideals to give valor a wider range than war affords to seek danger not at the cannon s mouth but in less noisy labors and adventures When Nicholas of Russia and William of Germany in solemn state the other day invoked the blessing of God upon their armies the emotion that went   round the world was not the old thrill but a new sardonic laughter  As Cervantes smiled Spain s chivalry away so some poet of the new era may strip the glamour from war Tolstoi s War and Peace and many lesser books are chapters of the new revelation and modern science modern invention have aided the race in its half conscious effort to unveil the bitter hideousness of the war god s visage But the final word has not been said the feeling that war is beautiful still lingers in men s hearts a feeling founded on world old savageries love of power of torture of murder love of big stakes in a big game This feeling must be destroyed as it was created through the imagination It is work for a poet  There will be a new poetry of war Now and then one hears if not the coming Cervantes authentic message yet a loud word or two of grim protest against the glamour This from Mr Carl Sandburg is significant in its huge contempt  READY TO KILL  Ten minutes now I have been looking at this I have gone by here before and wondered about it This is a bronze memorial of a famous general Riding horseback with a flag and a sword and a revolver on him I want to smash the whole thing into a pile of junk to be hauled  away to the scrap yard I put it straight to you After the farmer the miner the shop man the factory hand the  fireman and the teamster Have all been remembered with bronze memorials Shaping them on the job of getting all of us Something to eat and something to wear When they stack a few silhouettes  Against the sky Here in the park And show the real huskies that are doing the work of the world and feeding people instead of butchering them   Ready to Kill  Then maybe I will stand here And look easy at this general of the army holding a flag in the air And riding like hell on horseback Ready to kill anybody that gets in his way Ready to run the red blood and slush the bowels of men all over  the sweet new grass of the prairie  War will be over when such feeling as this possesses the imaginations of men H M  SYNGE S MAGIC  John Millington Synge and The Irish Theatre by Maurice Bourgeois Constable amp Co Synge s family his boy life his education his wander  years and his final sweep into fame are a romantic chapter in literary history M Bourgeois writes with thoroughness and sympathy and no lover of Synge but will be grateful for this account of a life dedicated to a great purpose which had a strange fulfilling  We have also a study of his continental culture which gave him facility in manipulating the material that awaited him in Ireland With this may be classed Synge s sources so fully revealed in his note books and further elucidated by  M Bourgeois who makes much of the poet s knowledge of folk drama in other countries and of his predilection for Pierre Loti s fisher stories Synge s style is demonstrated to be due to his first hand knowledge of Gaelic All these he brought to the Abbey Theater whose history is once again given in complete detail  M Bourgeois critic data are plentiful and well organized but his subject suffers from a method which though   scholarly is diffuse Too many minor matters are in the way of real clues which if the author had valiantly followed them would have led to the essential Synge His affinity to George Borrow touched upon in this critique is less than to a more splendid company of wanderers who express people happily or unhappily inarticulate  Synge s Irish countryside is another version of Words worth s Northumberland Whitman s Manhattan Thoreau s Cape Cod Turgenev s rural Russia and Gorky s tramp world Once established in this group Synge s place in it has a peculiar distinction His outcast milieu is his whole inspiration He made Teniers pictures of some of it spirited plays of the rest and of the whole a body of poetry magical in its enchantment M Bourgeois takes issue with critics who make poetry Synge s supreme gift But Synge is a poet above all Poetry is his power and M Bourgeois in emphasizing the dramatic in Synge and studying each play apart from its poetry weakens his criticism Only at times do we feel that he is alive to the beauty of the plays noticeably in the chapter on Riders to the Sea Merely mentioning the love scene in The Playboy as beautiful does not satisfy one It is so beautiful that it adds a fresh rapture to English poetry  All of Synge s plays do this Open The Well of the Saints casually and you come upon such clauses as  to make the blind see clear as the gray hawks do be high up on a still day sailing the sky the Splendor of the Spirit of God you ll see an odd time   Synge s Magic  shining out through the big hills and steep streams falling to  the sea  you won t let down the width of your two feet and not be  crushing fine flowers and making sweet smells in the air  Much of the play is an eclogue M Bourgeois study of this dramatic lyric is typical He is concerned with everything but the poetry yet we have not had such rich out ofdoor feeling in English poetry since Spenser There is some recognition of Synge s passion for nature but its quality that which makes it compelling must be studied organically with the plays M Bourgeois slights the beauty of the Dierdre play which is a play only in form in substance it is an elegy its theme is the grave  M Bourgeois comes close at times to the secret of Synge to his paganism his tragic mood Had he studied these integrally with the plays he would have seen how Synge disturbs to the very core by his passionate thrusts at life He loosed tragedy from a new source His mater dolorosa his lonely broken people young and old and Synge himself as lonely and broken as any are the voice of Ireland s silent centuries  Ellen Fitzgerald  THE POETRY OF GERARD HOPKINS  That Gerard Hopkins is today little known even among rhymers is an inevitable result of his manner of life and work He was a priest of the Catholic Church and a member of the Society of Jesus His faith was the source of his poetry but his arduous labors in its service left him little   time for celebrating it in verse and made him so indifferent to applause that he never published Sir Arthur Quiller Couch put his The Starlight Night in the Oxford Book of  Victorian Verse and he is represented in Orby Shipley s Carmina Mariana and H C Beeching s Lyra Sacra Several of his poems are included in Volume VIII of Poets and Poetry of the Century with a critique by his friend Robert Bridges and Miss Katherine Brégy has made him the subject of an illuminative essay in her admirable book The Poet s Chantry A scant bibliography indeed for a genuinely inspired poet the most scrupulous word artist of the nineteenth century  The world is charged with the grandeur of God It will flame out like shining from shook foil These opening lines of a sonnet illustrate clearly Gerard Hopkins spirit and method Like that other Jesuit Robert Southwell he was a Catholic poet for him to write a poem on a secular theme was difficult almost impossible He sang the grandeur of God and for his song he used a language which in its curious perfection is exclusively his own One may search his writings in vain for a figure that is not novel and true He took from his own experience those comparisons that are the material of poetry and rejected it seems such of them as already bore marks of use For him the grandeur of God flames out from the world not like light from stars but like shining from shook foil He writes not of soft hands not of velvety hands but of feel of primrose hands He writes not that thrush s eggs are blue as   The Poetry of Gerard Hopkins  the sky but that they look little low heavens The starry skies of a winter night are the dim woods quick with diamond wells or the gray lawns cold where quaking gold dew lies In Spring the blue is all in a rush with richness and Summer plashes amid the billowy apple trees his lusty hands  Now it may be that these exquisite figures would not entitle their maker to high praise if they were isolated bits of splendor if like the economical verse makers of our own day he had made each one the excuse for a poem But they come in bewildering profusion Gerard Hopkins poems are successions of lovely images each a poem in itself  This statement may give its reader the idea that of Gerard Hopkins poetry may be said as Charles Ricketts said of Charles Conder s pictures There are too many roses No one who reads his poems however will make this criticism The roses are there of right all of them They are it may be said necessary roses They are the cunningly placed elements of an elaborate pattern a pattern of which roses are the appropriate material And the red and white of their petals come from the blood and tears that nourished their roots  It is the overwhelming greatness of his theme that justifies the lavishness of his method The word mystic is nowadays applied so wantonly to ever gossiper about things supernatural that it is to most people meaningless For the benefit of those who know the difference between Saint Theresa and Miss Evelyn Underhill however it may be   stated that Gerard Hopkins was more nearly a true mystic than either Francis Thompson or Lionel Johnson The desire at any rate for the mystical union with God is evident in every line he wrote and even more than his friend  Coventry Patmore he knew the dark night of the soul  This being the case his theme being God and his writing being an act of adoration it is profitless to criticise him as Mr Robert Bridges has done for sacrificing simplicity and violating those mysterious things the canons of taste A sane editor of a popular magazine would reject everything he wrote A verse writer who does not know that The Habit of Perfection is true poetry is not a poet Here it is  Elected Silence sing to me And beat upon my whorlèd ear Pipe me to pastures still and be The music that I care to hear  Shape nothing lips be lovely dumb It is the shut the curfew sent From there where all surrenders come Which only makes you eloquent  Be shelled eyes with double dark  And find the uncreated light  This ruck and reel which you remark  Coils keeps and teases simple sight  Palate the hutch of tasty lust Desire not to be rinsed with wine The can must be so sweet the crust So fresh that come in fasts divine  Nostrils your careless breath that spend Upon the stir and keep of pride What relish shall the censers send Along the sanctuary side   The Poetry of Gerard Hopkins  O feel of primrose hands O feet That want the yield of plushy sward But you shall walk the golden street And you unhouse and house the Lord And Poverty be thou the bride And now the marriage feast begun And lily colored clothes provide Your spouse not labored at nor spun Walter Pater Gerard Hopkins tutor at Balliol had no keener sensitivity to the color and music of language Gerard Hopkins purpose a purpose impossible of fulfilment but not therefore less worth the effort was to arrange words like so many separate gems to compose a whole expression of thought in which the force of grammar and the beauty of rhythm absolutely correspond There will always be those who dislike the wealth of imagery which characterizes Gerard Hopkins poetry because they do not understand his mental and spiritual attitude Perhaps for some critics an altar cloth may be too richly embroidered and a chalice too golden Ointment of spikenard is very costly Joyce Kilmer  A WORD TO OUR READERS  With this number POETRY completes its fourth volume and its second year Two fifths of the period for which we are endowed having passed it is time perhaps for a confidential talk  Are you convinced of the value of our unique experiment for the support and encouragement of a universal and   indispensable art Do you wish the magazine to continue beyond the five years for which it is subsidized Do you wish its policy to be one of increasing liberality toward the poets and their public working always toward more just appreciation and recompense for the former and for the latter a presentation of the best the art has to offer  The permanence of the magazine lies not with us but with you Given life and health we can pledge to its support our best service and under the usual limitations of human error increasing knowledge and efficiency for there is much education in such work as this But our labor will not avail for permanence unless we can reach the public for poetry which must exist in this vast country and in the wide provinces of the English speaking world And we can not find that public unless you help us  We must be advertised by our friends Other advertising in these days of enormously expensive displays of it is costly and often futile We have preferred to reserve our endowment fund for our contributors the poets in order to increase the intrinsic value of the magazine The direct advertisement of recommendation is the only possible means of increasing its scope and influence  Thus you and you alone can give us really effective aid toward reaching a circulation large enough to enable us to stand alone You can help us in any or all of the following ways  First send or renew your own subscription   A Word to Our Readers  Second persuade one or more of your friends and neighbors to subscribe  Third see that your social and literary clubs subscribe  Fourth see that the public library in your town carries  one or more subscriptions Fifth talk about the magazine either praise or blame will indicate your interest  To those who wish to give more to the magazine than the dollar and a half a year of their subscription we extend a cordial invitation to join our body of guarantors In that list are now one hundred and thirty two names of men and women who have promised us from five to one hundred dollars a year for five years Full guarantors pay fifty dollars or in a few instances one hundred Others pay twenty five ten or five dollars All receive the magazine each month and full reports once a year Our guarantors like members of art institutes and of operatic dramatic and orchestral societies like donors of prizes and scholarships in schools and exhibitions of painting sculpture architecture and music like these our guarantors are patrons of a great art one which equally with the other arts needs public encouragement and even endowment if it is to achieve its triumphs By encouraging the art by staking something on their faith in those who practice it they increase their own enjoyment of it and receive perhaps more than they give so that the adventure is of mutual benefit  Another way of contributing largely is to offer a prize This way is recommended especially to clubs whose commit   tees may wish to select prize winners among the poems contributed to the magazine Givers of prizes if they prefer may make their own conditions subject merely to the editor s agreement We should like to give as many prizes annually as the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh 1 500 1 000 500 or the Art Institute of Chicago 1 000 500 300 and many smaller sums besides annual and traveling scholarships  In this art an especially urgent need is for the endowment of scholarships especially traveling scholarships The modern world modern thought and art is cosmopolitan A young poet even more than a young aspirant in the other arts needs a certain amount of cosmopolitan training and experience For the lack of it he may develop narrowly remaining provincial and laggard minded It is an incredible and inexcusable omission that the expensively endowed American Academy at Rome does not include poets among the young artists it subsidizes indeed they are precisely the ones who would perhaps benefit the most by a few years residence in Rome The editor has in mind now three or four promising young poets to whom a scholarship would be of incalculable benefit  Many inspiring words encouraged me while I was explaining the project of the magazine to possible guarantors One of these a Chicago lawyer said Of course put me down I don t know any better way to pay my debt to Shelley What do you owe you who read this article to Shelley to Coleridge Milton Shakespeare to Molière   A Word to Our Readers  Dante Sappho Homer to all the great poets whose immortal singing has incalculably enriched life become an integral part of the mind of the race Have you ever felt a possible obligation to pay a little of that immeasurable debt Is there any other way to pay your debt to the great dead poets than by supporting and encouraging the poets now alive Among them may be the founders of a renaissance among them may be an immortal In a sense not only actual and immediate but permanent mystic and profound their fate is in your hands H M  NOTES  Three of this month s contributors appear in POETRY for the first time Mr John Alford is an
