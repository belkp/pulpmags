MAY 1913  THE DEATH OF AGRIPPINA I  The courtyard of the Imperial villa at Baiae A moonlit night in late March Occupying the left half of background is seen a portion of the villa A short broad flight of steps leads through the arched doorway to a pillared hall beyond vague but seeming vast in the uncertain lights that flicker in the draught To the right of the doorway is a broad open window at the height of a man s head from the courtyard An urn stands near window in the shadow to the right From within harp music is heard threading the buzzing merriment of a banquet that is being given to celebrate Nero s reconciliation with his mother To the right of stage a glimpse of the moonlit sea is caught through trees  Enter from left walking toward the sea Anicetus and the Captain of a galley Captain Pointing toward sea Yon lies the galley weltering in the moon   A fair ship like a lady in a swoon Of languid passion Never fairer craft Flung the green rustle of her skirts abaft And wooed the dwindling leagues  Anicetus A boat s a boat And were she thrice the fairest keel afloat Tonight she founders sinks make sure of that  Captain And all to drown one lean imperial cat With claws and teeth too sharp despite the purr Ah scan the graceful woman lines of her Fit for the male Wind s love is she alas Scuttled and buried in a sea of glass By her own master It will cost me pain Better a night of lightning riven rain With hell hounds baying in the driven gloom  Anicetus The will of Nero is her wind of doom Woe to the seaman who defies that gale Go now make ready that we may not fail To crown the wish of Caesar with the deed  Captain Aye Master Exit Captain toward sea Anicetus And no brazen wound shall bleed  Red scandal over Rome the nosing mob Shall sniff no poison Just a gulping sob And some few bubbles breaking on the swell Then good night Agrippina rest you well And may the gods revamp the silly fish With guts of brass for coping with that dish   A muffled outburst of laughter in banquet hall Anicetus turns toward window Uproar dies out  They re drinking deep the banquet s at its height And all therein are kings and queens tonight  Goes to urn mounts it and peers in at window  A merry crew Quite drunk quite drunk I fear My noble Romans Burrus eyes are blear One goblet hence good Burrus you will howl E en Seneca sits staring like an owl And strives to pilot in some heavy sea That wisdom laden boat his head Ah me Creperius Gallus you are floundering deep In red Falernian bogs so you shall sleep Quite soundly while your mistress takes the dip Fair Acerronia thinks the place a ship And greenly sickens in the dizzy roll There broods Poppaea certain of her goal Her veil a sea fog clutching at the moon A portent to wise sailors Very soon The sea shall wake in hunger and be fed She smiles the glimmer on a thunderhead That vomits ruin What has made her smile Ah Nero s wine is sugared well with guile So kiss your mother gently fondle her Pet the old she cat till she mew and purr Unto the tender hand that strokes her back So shall there be no sniffing at the sack Would that her eyes like his with wine were dim   Gods What a tragic actor died in him  To make a comic Caesar  I surmise By the too rheumy nature of your eyes Divine imperial Nero and their sunk Lugubrious aspect pardon but you re drunk Drunk as a lackey when the master s out O kingly tears that down that regal snout Pour salty love upon a mother s breast So shall her timid doubts be lulled to rest  Bustle within as of many rising to their feet  They rise The prologue s ended now the play  He gets down from urn and goes off toward sea  Heralds Crying within Make way for Caesar Ho  Make way Make way  The musicians within strike up a martial strain After a few moments within the hall appear Nero and Agrippina arm in arm approaching the flight of steps Nero is robed in a tunic of the color of amethyst with a winged harp embroidered on the front He is crowned with a laurel wreath now askew in his disordered hair Agrippina wears a robe of maroon without decoration Nero endeavors to preserve the semblance of supporting his mother but in fact is supported by her while he caresses her with considerable extravagance They pause half way down the steps and the music within changes to a low melancholy air  Agrippina Lifting her face to the moon seaward  How fair a moon to crown our happy revel   gt  Nero Gazing blankly at the moon Eh Veil the  hussy Agrippina Son son Nero She s a devil Agrippina Placing a loving arm closer about Nero  Just such a night t was Lucius you remember When Claudius spirit like a smouldering ember Struggled twixt flame and ash do you forget  Nero Ha ha t was snuffed ho ho  Agrippina Stroking his hair T was then I set The imperial circlet here t was then I cloaked My boy with world robes  Nero Still staring at moon and pointing unsteadily  Have that vixen choked Her staring makes me stagger where s her veil Agrippina It all comes back like an enchanted tale The moon set and the sun rose Nero Dead and gone The sun set and the moon rose Agrippina Nay at dawn The blear flame died the new flame blossomed up Nero Did someone drop a poison in my cup The windless sea crawls moaning  They move slowly down steps Nero clinging to his mother  Agrippina Son of mine Cast off the evil humors of the wine I am so happy and was so forlorn   Ah not another night since you were born Has flung such purple through me Son at last The haggard hours that parted us are past I ve wept my tears and none are left to shed I live I live I live And I was dead  Nero Clinging closer Dead dead what ails the sea tis going red  Laughter in banquet hall  Who s laughing Mother scourge them from the place Who gave the moon Poppaea s dizzy face To fright the sea  Agrippina Your message gave me life Ah Lucius not for us to mar with strife A world so made for loving  Lucius dear I was too harsh perhaps the fault was here  Placing hand on heart Nero Staring into his mother s eyes Too harsh perhaps  Agrippina Yea so we mothers err Too long we see our babies as they were And last of all the world confess them tall They stride so far we shudder lest they fall They toddle yet  And she who bears a son Shall be two women ever after one The fountain of a seaward cooing stream And one the shrouded virgin of a dream   Whom no man wooes whose heart a muted lyre Pines with a wild but unconfessed desire For him who never understands my son I ll be all fountain kill that other one  Nero That other one  Agrippina Oh like a wind of Spring Wooing the sere grave of a buried thing Your summons came Such happy tendrils creep Out of me in that old ache rooted deep To blossom sunward greener for the sorrow And O my Emperor if on the morrow Your heart could soften toward that gentle one That frail white lily pining for the sun Octavia your patient little wife Smile smile upon that flower and give it life Make of my Lucius emperor in truth Not Passion s bondman  T is the way of youth To drive wild stallions with too slack a rein Toward fleeing goals no fleetness can attain Oh splendid speed that fails for lack of fear The grip of iron makes the charioteer The lyric fury heeds the master beat And is the freer for its shackled feet You who are Law shall be more free than others By seeming less so Lucius  Nero Best of mothers Tomorrow yes tomorrow Mother stay   You must not go so far so far away Agrippina Only to Bauli  They have reached the extreme right of stage The guests now begin to come out of banquet hall scattering a rippling laughter Nero is aroused by the merry sound looks back gathers himself together with a start  Nero Ah The moon is bright The sea is still We ll banquet every night Shall we not Mother  Certain cares of state Weigh heavily tis awful to be great Nay terrible at times Can I be ill It seemed the sea moaned yet tis very still Mother my Mother kiss me Let us go Down to the galley so  They pass out toward the sea Nero caressing his mother The guests now throng down the steps into the courtyard They are in various states of intoxication Many are dressed to represent mythological figures Fauns and Satyrs Bacchus crowned with grape leaves wearing a leopard skin on his shoulders six Bacchantes Psyche with wings Luna in a spangled tunic with silver horns in her hair Mercury with winged sandals and the caduceus Neptune in an emerald robe crowned and bearing the trident Iris rainbow clad Silenus Some are dressed in brilliant oriental garments There are Senators in broad bordered togas with half moons embroidered on their sandals Pages   dressed as Cupids and infant Bacchi Officers of the Praetorian Guard in military uniform Turbaned half nude Numidian slaves with bronze rings in their ears come trotting in with litters attended by torch bearers Some of the guests depart in the litters The music continues in banquet hall  Neptune Staggering against Luna Who d be a  sailor when great Neptune staggers Dashed in the Moon s face Calm me gentle Luna And silver me with kisses  Luna Fleeing from his outstretched arms but regarding him invitingly over her shoulder Fie you wine skin A hiccough s not a tempest Lo I glide Treading a myriad stars  Neptune follows with a rolling gait A Satyr Looking after them as they disappear  Roll eager Tide Methinks ere long the wooing moon shall fall  Those near laugh First Senator To Second Senator Was Nero acting think you Second Senator Not at all  Twas staged no doubt but First Senator Softly lest they hear Second Senator The mimic is in mimicry sincere  The role absorbed the actor So he wept  They pass on talking low   A Praetorian Officer To Psyche leaning on his arm  Was it a vision Psyche Have I slept By the pink nippled Cyprian I swear Our Caesar knows a woman Gods That hair Spun from the bowels of Ophir  Psyche Who s so fair Praetorian Poppaea Psyche She A Circe queen of hogs  A cross road Hecate bayed at by the dogs  A morbid Itch Praetorian Sh Psyche strutting in a cloak  Of what she has not virtue  Praetorian Ha You joke All cloaks are ruses fashioned to reveal What all possess pretending to conceal Who d love a Psyche else  They pass on  Iris To a Satyr who supports her A clever wile Her veil is Ah we women must beguile The stupid male by seeming to withhold What s dross displayed but guarded well is gold Faugh Hunger sells it and the carter buys  Satyr Consume me with the lightning of her eyes  She s Aphrodite Iris Helen Satyr Helen then  A peep behind that veil and once again   The sword flung music of the fighting men Voluptuous ruin and wild battle joy The swooning ache and rapture that was Troy Delirious doom  Iris Laughing O Sorcery of Night  We re all one woman in the morning light Satyr Laughing You re jealous Iris No I rend the veil in twain They mingle with the throng Silenus To a Naval Officer The wind veers and the  moon seems on the wane What bodes it reinstatement for the Queen Naval Officer No seaman knows the wind and moon you mean Yet land were safer when those signs concur  They pass on Mercury To a Bacchante T would rouse compassion in a toad and stir A wild boar s heart with pity  Bacchante Placing a warning hand on his mouth  Hush Beware Mercury Could you not feel the hidden gorgon stare The venom of her laughter dripping slow  The musicians from within having followed the departing throng from the banquet hall and having stationed themselves on the steps now strike up a wild Bacchic air  Bacchus Swinging into the dance Bacchantes wreathe the dance   Bacchantes From various parts of the throng Io Bacche Io  Pirouetting to the music they assemble circling about Bacchus joining hands and singing When the song is finished the circle breaks the dancers wheel facing outward Bacchus endeavors to kiss a Bacchante who regards him with head thrown back The dance music becomes more abandoned and the Bacchante flees pursued by Bacchus who reels as he dances All the other Bacchantes follow weaving in and out between pursuer and pursued The throng laughingly makes way for them At length the pursued Bacchante flings off in a mad whirl toward the grove in the background followed by Bacchus and the Bacchantes Fauns and Satyrs now take up the dance and join in the pursuit The throng follows eagerly enjoying the spectacle All disappear among the trees Laughter in the distance growing dimmer The musicians withdraw into the villa and disappear their music dying out The lights go out in the banquet hall The stage is now lit by the moon alone save for the draughty lamps within the pillared hall After a period of silence re enter Nero walking back  ward from the direction of the sea toward which he gazes  Nero Dimmer dimmer dimmer A shadow melting in a moony shimmer Down the bleak seaways dwindling to that shore Where no heaved anchor drips forevermore Nor winds breathe music in the homing sail   But over sunless hill and fruitless vale Gaunt spectres drag the age long discontent And ponder what this brief bright moment meant The loving and the dreaming and the laughter Ah ships that vanish take what never after Returning ships may carry  Dawn shall flare Make bloom the terraced gardens of the air For all the world but Lucius He shall see The haunted hollow of Infinity Gray in the twilight of a heart s eclipse With our own wishes woven into whips The jealous gods chastise us I m alone About the transient brilliance of my throne The giddy moths flit briefly in the glow But when at last that light shall flicker low A taper guttering in a gust of doom What hand shall grope for Nero s in the gloom What fond eyes shed the fellows of his tears She bore her heart these many troublous years  Before me like a shield And she is dead Her hand twas set the crown upon my head Her heart s blood dyed the kingly robe for me Dank seaweed crowns her and the bitter sea Enshrouds with realmless purple  Round and round Swirled in the endless nightmare of the drowned Her fond soul gropes for something vaguely dear   That lures eludes forever Shapes that leer  Distorted Neros of a tortured sleep  Cry Mother come to Baiae Deep on deep The green death folds her and she can not come Vague gaping mouths that hunger and are dumb Mumble the tired heart so ripe with woe Where night is but a black wind breathing low And daylight filters like a ghostly rain 0 Mother Mother Mother  With arms extended he stares seaward a moment then covers his face turns and walks slowly toward entrance of villa  Vain tis vain How shall one move an ocean with regret  He has reached the steps and pauses  Ah one hope lives in all this bleakness yet Song Mighty Song the hurt of life assuages This fateful night shall fill the vaulted ages With starry grief and men unborn shall sing The mournful measure of the Ancient King I ll write an ode  He stands for a moment glorified with the thought  Great heart of Nero strung Harplike endure till this last song be sung Then break then break  Turns and mounts the steps   Oh Fate to be a bard The way is hard the way is very hard  A dim outburst of laughter from the revellers in the distance  II  The same night Nero s private chamber in his villa at Baiae Nero is discovered asleep in his state robes on a couch where he has evidently thrown himself down overcome by the stupor incident to the feast of the night Beside the couch is a writing stand bearing writing materials A few lights burn dimly Nero groans cries out and as though terrified by a nightmare sits up trembling and staring upon some projected vision of his sleep He is yet only half awake  Nero Oh oh begone blear thing She is not dead You are not she my mother Ghastly head Trunkless and oozing green gore like the sea Wind stabbed Begone Go do not look at me I will not be so tortured Eyes burned out With scorious hell spew Locks that grope about To clutch and strangle  He has got up from the couch and now struggles with something at his throat still staring at the thing  Off Off  In an outburst of terrified tenderness extends his arms as toward a woman  Mother come Into these arms speak to me be not dumb   Stare not so wildly kiss me as of old Be flesh again warm flesh Oh green and cold As the deep grave they gave you  Twas not I Mother twas not my will that you should die Twas hers I hate her Mother pity me Oh is it you Sole goddess of the sea I shall proclaim you Pity I shall pour The hot blood of your foes on every shore A huge libation Hers shall be the first I swear it May my waking be accursed My sleep a swarm with furies if I err  He has advanced a short distance toward what he sees but now shrinks back burying his face in his robe  Go Spare me Guards Guards  Three soldiers who have been standing guard without the chamber rush in and stand at attention  Seize and shackle her There tis eh He stares blankly rubs his eyes It is gone  Blinks at soldiers and cries petulantly  What do you here First Soldier Great Caesar summoned us Nero Glancing nervously about The night is blear  Make lights I will not have these shadow things Crawling about me Poisoners of kings Fatten on shadows Quick there dog eyed scamp Lean offal sniffer Kindle every lamp   Soldier tremblingly takes a lamp and lights a number of others with its flame Stage is flooded with light  By the bronze beard I swear there shall be lights Enough hereafter though I purge the nights With conflagrating cities till the crash Of Rome s last tower beat up the smouldering ash Of Rome s last city  So I breathe again Some cunning faneless god who hated men Devised this curse of darkness What s the hour  Second Soldier The third watch wanes  Nero Too late Too late The power Of Nero Caesar can not stay the sun The stars have marched against me it is done And all Rome s legions could not rout this swarm Of venom footed moments  She was warm One little lost eternity ago With awakening resolution Twas not my deed  did not wish it so Some demon aping Caesar gave the word While Lucius Ahenobarbus eyes were blurred With too much beauty  Oh it shall be done Ere these unmothered eyes behold the sun She shall have vengeance and that gift is mine  To First Soldier Rouse the Praetorians Bid a triple line    Be flung about the palace To Second Soldier Send me wine Strong wine to nerve a resolution To Third Soldier You Summon Poppaea  The Soldiers go out  This deed I mean to do Unties the snarl but broken is the thread Would that the haughty blood these hands will shed Might warm my mother that the breath I crush So clutching air from that throat of sorceries might  rush Into the breast that loved and nurtured me The heart of Nero shivers in the sea And Rome is lorn of pity  Could the world And all her crawling spawn this night be hurled Into one woman s form with eyes to shed Rivers of scalding woe her towering head Jeweled with realms aflare with locks of smoke Huge nerves to suffer and a neck to choke That woman were Poppaea I would rear About the timeless sea my mother s bier A sky roofed desolation groined with awe Where nightly drifting in the stream of law The vestal stars should tend their fires and weep To hear upon the melancholy deep That shipless wind her ghost amid the hush   Alas I have but one white throat to crush With these world hungry fingers From behind Nero enter Page a little boy bearing a goblet of wine on a salver Nero turns startled  Ah You You Page I bring wine mighty Caesar Nero passes his hand across his face and the expression of fright leaves Nero So you do I saw the boy Britannicus One sees Things does one not such eerie nights as these  Page With eager boyish earnestness With woozy heads Nero Irritably The wine  The Page startled presents the salver from which Nero takes the goblet with unsteady hand Page is in the act of fleeing  Stay  Page stops and turns tremblingly  Never dare Again to look like anyone Beware  Page s head shakes a timid negative Nero stares into goblet and muses  Blood s red too Ah a woman is the grape Ripe for the vintage from whose flesh agape Glad feet tonight shall stamp the hated ooze It boils See like some witch s pot that brews Venomous ichor Nay so angry ghost   Hurls bloody breakers on a bleeding coast Tis poisoned Out Locusta s brat Hurls goblet at Page who flees precipitately  Twas she The hand that flung my mother to the sea Now pours me death  Alas great Hercules Too long has plied the distaff at the knees Of Omphale spinning a thread of woe Was ever king of story driven so By unrelenting Fate Lo round on round The slow coils grip and choke a mother drowned Her wrathful spirit rising from the dead A gentle wife outcast discredited With sighs to wake the dread Eumenides Some thunder hearted vaster Sophocles His aeon beating blood the stellar stream Has flung on me the mantle of his dream And Nero grapples Fate O wondrous play With smoking brand aloft the haggard Day Gropes for the world Pursued by subtle foes Superbly tragic mid a storm of woes The fury hunted Caesar takes the cue One time outstaring deed remains to do Then let the pit howl Caesar sings no more Go ask the battered wreckage on the shore Who sought his mother in a sudden sleep To be with her forever on the deep    A twin ship hating tempest  Enter Anicetus excitedly Anicetus Lost We re lost The Roman ship yaws rockward tempest tossed And Nero is but Lucius in the wreck Nero Croak on Each croak s a dagger in that neck You vulture with the hideous dripping beak The clutching tearing talons that now reek With what dear sacred veins Anicetus O Caesar hear So keen the news I bear you that I fear To loose it like the arrow it must be I know not why such wrath you heap on me I know what peril deepens round my lord How riven by the lightning of the sword The doom voiced blackness labors round his head Nero Say what I know that my poor mother s dead So shall your life be briefer Anicetus Would t were so Nero A light coming into his face She lives Anicetus Yea lives and lives to overthrow Nero Not perished Anicetus And her living is our death Nero She moves and breathes Anicetus And potent is her breath To blow rebellion up Nero Rubbing his eyes Still do I sleep Is this a taunting dream that I may weep   More bitterly Or some new foul intrigue Anicetus Tis bitter fact to her who swam a league  And bitter fact to Nero shall it be  At Bauli now still dripping from the sea  She crouches snarling  Nero In an outburst of joy Oh you shall not die My best loved Anicetus Though you lie Sweeter these words are than profoundest truth They breathe the fresh white morning of my youth Upon the lampless night that smothered me O more than human Sea That spared my mother that her son might live What bounty can I give I Caesar falter beggared at this gift Of living words that lift My mother from the regions of the dead Ah I shall set a crown upon your head Snip you a kingdom from Rome s flowing robe I ll temple you in splendors Yea I ll probe Your secret heart to know what wishes pant In wingless yearning there that I may grant  Pause while Anicetus regards Nero with gloomy face  What sight thus makes your face a pool of gloom Anicetus The ghost of Nero crying from his tomb Nero Startled Eh Nero s ghost mine Anicetus Even so I said  The doomed to perish are already dead  Who woo not Fate with swift unerring deeds   That breathless moment when the tigress bleeds Is ours to strike in ere the tigress spring What could it boot your servant to be king While any moment may the trumpets cry Hailing the certain hour when we shall die Caesar the deaf and his untrusted slave Peer deep peer deep into this yawning grave And tell me who shall fill it Wind and fire Harnessed with thrice the ghost of her dead sire Your mother is tonight She knows she knows How galleys founder when no tempest blows And moonlight slumbers on a glassy deep The beast our wound has wakened shall not sleep Till it be gorged with slaughter or be slain Lull not your heart O Caesar It is vain To dream this cub lorn tigress will not turn Lo flaring through the dawn I see her burn A torch of revolution Hear her raise The legions with a voice of other days Worded with pangs to fret their ancient scars And every sword wound of her father s wars Will shriek aloud with pity  Nero During Anicetus speech he has shown growing fear Listen There You heard it Did you hear a trumpet blare  Anicetus Tis but the shadow of a sound to be One rushing hour away Nero In panic Where shall I flee   I the sad poet whom she made a king At last we flesh the ghost of what we sing We bards I sang Orestes  His face softens with a gentler thought  Ah I ll go To my poor heartsick mother Tears shall flow The tears of Lucius not imperial tears I ll heap on her the vast too vast arrears Of filial love The Senate shall proclaim My mother regnant with me write her name Beside Augustus with the demigods Yea lictors shall attend her with the rods And massed Praetorians tramp the rabble down Whene er her chariot flashes through the town One should be kind to mothers  Anicetus Yea and be Kind to the senseless fury of the sea Fondle the tempest in a rotten boat  Nero What would you Anicetus Anicetus Cut her throat Nero gasps and shrinks from Anicetus  Nero No no her ghost one can not stab so deep One can not kill these tortures spawned of sleep No no one can not kill them with a sword  Anicetus Faugh One good thrust the rest is air my lord  Enter Page timorously Nero turns upon him   Page Frightened Spare me good Caesar Agerinus Nero Go Bid Agerinus enter  Page flees Nero to Anicetus menacingly  We shall know What breath from what damned throat tonight shall hiss  Enter Agerinus bowing low  Agerinus My mistress sends fond greetings and a kiss To her most noble son and bids me say She rests and would not see him until day The royal galley through unhappy chance Struck rock and foundered but no circumstance So meagre might deprive a son so dear Of his beloved mother Have no fear The long swim leaves her weary but quite well She knows what tender love her son would tell And yearns for dawn to bring him to her side  Nero To Anicetus So Spell your doom from  that You lied You lied I ll lance that hateful fester in your throat Yea we shall prove who rides the rotten boat And supplicates the tempest  With a rapid motion Nero draws Agerinus sword from its sheath Anicetus shrinks hack Nero cries to Agerinus  Wait to see The loving message you bear back from me  Nero brandishing the sword makes at Anicetus As he   is about to deliver the stroke enter Poppaea from behind She has evidently been quite leisurely about her toilet being dressed gorgeously and wearing her accustomed half veil Her manner is stately and composed She approaches slowly Nero stops suddenly in the act to strike Anicetus and stares upon the beautiful apparition Anger leaves his face which changes as though he had seen a great light  Poppaea Languidly My Nero longed for me Nero with his free hand brushes his eyes in perplexity Nero I can not tell  What twas I wished I wished Poppaea Haughtily Ah very well She walks slowly on across the stage Nero stares  blankly after her The sword drops from his hand As  Poppaea disappears he rouses suddenly as from a stupor Nero Ho Guards Three soldiers enter Nero points to Agerinus  There seize that wretch who came to kill Imperial Caesar  Agerinus is seized Nero turns to Anicetus  Hasten Do your will  Nero turns and with an eager expression on his face goes doddering after Poppaea  III  The same night Agrippina s private chamber in her villa at Bauli near Baiae There is one lamp in the room At the center back is a broad door closed with heavy hangings   At the right is an open window through which the moonlight jails Agrippina is discovered lying on a couch One maid Nina is in attendance and is arranging Agrippina s hair  Agrippina He was so render what should kindness mean  The maid seeming not to hear continues with toilet  I spoke you heard me speak Nina I heard my Queen Agrippina And deemed my voice some ghostly summer wind  Fit for autumnal hushes He was kind Was ever breath in utterance better spent Nina Your slave could scarcely fancy whom you meant There are so many tender to the great  Agrippina When all the world is one sky circled state Pray who should fill it as the sun the sky The mother of that mighty one am I And he caressed me  I shall feel no pain Forever now So drenched with winter rain The friendless marshland knows the boyish South And shivers into color  On the mouth He kissed me as before that other came That Helen of the stews that corpse aflame With lust for life that  Ah he maidened me   What dying wind could sway so tall a tree With such proud music I shall be again That darkling whirlwind down the fields of men That dart unloosed barbed keenly for his sake That living sword for him to wield or break But never sheathe  Lifts herself on elbow  O Nina let me be Robed as the Queen I am in verity Robed as a victrix home from splendid wars Whom mid the rumble of spoil laden cars Trundled by harnessed kings the trumpets hail Let quiet garments be for those who fail Mourning a world ill lost with meek surrenders I would flare bright mid Death s unhuman splendors Dazzle the moony hollows of the dead Ah no Arising and going to window  I shall not die yet Parts the curtains and gazes out  Nina Tis the dread Still clinging from the clutches of the sea That living writhing horror Ugh O er me Almost I feel the liquid terror crawl Through glassy worlds of tortured sleep to fall Where winds blow not nor mornings ever blush But green cold ghastly light wraiths wander  Agrippina Turning from window with nervous anger  Hush  Turns again to window after pause continues musingly   She battles in a surf of spectral fire No like some queen upon a funeral pyre Gasping she withers in a fever swoon Had she a son too  Nina Approaching the window  Who O Queen  Agrippina The moon See she is strangled in a noose of pearl What telltale scars she has  Look yonder girl Your eyes are younger by the winding sea Where Baiae glooms and blanches it may be Old eyes betray not but some horsemen take The white road winding hither by the lake  Nina The way lies plain I see no moving thing  Agrippina Why thus is Agerinus loitering For he was ever true Joyously Ah foolish head My heart knows how my son shall come instead My little Lucius Even now he leaps Into the saddle and the dull way creeps Beneath the spurred impatience of his horse He longs so for me  Pause She scans the moonlit country  Shrouded like a corse Hoarding a mother s secret lies the sea And Capri like a gaint Niobe Outgazes Fate  O sweet too gentle lies   And kisses sword like Would the sun might rise  No more on Baiae Would that earth might burst  Spewing blear doom upon this world accursed  With truth too big for hiding  See He sleeps Beside her and the shame dimmed lamp light creeps Across her wine stained mouth so red so red Like mother blood See hissing round her head Foul hate fanged vipers that he calls her hair Ah no beyond all speaking is she fair Sweet as a sword wound in a gasping foe Her mouth is and too well too well I know Her face is dazzling as a funeral flame Battened on queen s flesh  Turning angrily from window  Oh the blatant shame The bungling drunkard s plot Tonight tonight I shall swoop down upon them by the light Of naked steel Faugh Had it come to that Had Rome no sword that like a drowning rat The mother of a king should meet her end What Gallic legion would not call me friend Did they not love Germanicus my sire Oh I will rouse the cohorts scattering fire Till all Rome blaze rebellion  She has advanced to a place beside the couch stands in a defiant attitude for a moment then covers her face with her hands and sinks to the couch   No no no It could not be I would not have it so Not mine to burn the tower my hands have built And somewhere mid the shadows of his guilt My son is good  Lifts herself on elbow  Look Nina toward the roofs Of sleeping Baiae Say that eager hoofs Beat a white dust cloud moonward  Nina goes to window and peers out  Nina Landward crawls A sea fog Capri s league long shadow sprawls Lengthening toward us soon the moon will set  Agrippina No horsemen Nina None my Queen Agrippina And yet and yet  He called me baby names Ah ghosts that wept Big tears down smiling faces twined and crept About my heart and still I feel their tears They make me joyous After all these years The little boy my heart so often dirged Shivered the man husk beardless and emerged He kissed my breasts and hung upon my going Once more I felt the happy nurture flowing The silvery tingling shivers of delight What though my end had come indeed tonight I was a mother  Have you children   Nina No  My Queen Agrippina Yet you are winsome Nina Lovers go  Like wind as lovers come I am unwed  Agrippina How lonely shall you be among the dead Where hearts remember but are lorn of hope Poor girl No dream of tiny hands that grope And coaxing hunting little mouths shall throw Brief glories round you  Nina I would go Like any brazen bawd along the street Hailing the first stout carter I should meet Ere I would perish childless Though we nurse The cooing thing that some day hurls the curse Forge from our hearts the matricidal sword The act of loving is its own reward We mothers need no pity  Twill be said When this brief war is done and I am dead That I was wanton shameless be it so Unto the swarm of insect scribes I throw The puffed up purple carcass of my name For them to feast on Pointed keen with shame How shall each busy little stylus bite A thing that feels not I have fought my fight That mine were but the weapons of the foe Too well the ragged scars I bear can show    Oh I have triumphed and am ripe to die About my going shall the trumpets cry  Forever and forever  I can thread The twilit under regions of the dead A radiant shadow with a heart that sings Before the myriad mothers of great kings I shall lift up each livid spirit hand Spotted with blood and the shall understand How small the price was  Nina Hark The tramp of soldiery and the clatter of arms are heard from without Nina panic stricken runs to window peers out shrinks back and turning flees by a side door Agrippina Why do you flee Did I not say my son would come to me Tis Nero Nero Caesar Lord of Rome My little boy grown tall is coming home  She goes to window peers out shrinks back then turns toward the door and sees three armed men standing there Anicetus the Captain of a Galley and a Centurion of the Navy The men stare at her without moving  Why come you here  Silence  To know my health Go tell My son your master I am very well And happy   The men make no reply Agrippina straightens her body haughtily  If like cowards in the night You come to stab a woman  Anicetus Drawing his sword and speaking to Captain  Snuff the light  The men spring forward with drawn swords Agrippina does not move The light is stricken out John G Neihardt   EDITORIAL COMMENT  TRADITION  OUR April number has aroused certain critics  to the defence of what they call the grand  old English tradition Their meaning  would seem to be tradition of external form  rather than the larger tradition of  spiritual motive a mere binding tradition of detail for which we confess little reverence Such tradition is not for the strong but for the weak It is invoked by those who need protection not by those who can stand alone The men who made this grand old English tradition little knew what they were doing To them there was nothing sacro sanct in their adventurous experiments they never dreamed of discouraging the adventurous experiments of others  Tradition however grand and old ceases to be of use the moment its walls are strong enough to break a butterfly s wing or keep a fairy immured The freedom of the human spirit is more important to the future of the race than the Greek temples and Gothic cathedrals of the past Art is not a Mosaic dispensation from Mount Sinai but a creation of men s minds The more direct and spontaneous this creation the better The more the artist can sweep away all barriers between his soul and the truth between himself and his particular inspiring god the nearer will he come to complete and   supreme expression Inevitably he inherits his materials and instruments he can not invent words colors sounds the pen he writes with the paints he uses the violin he plays upon If he must inherit also forms and rules better the free foot in the wilderness better the upward flight of danger in a monoplane    However the strong also may march in the ancient highway may hearken for a time to the grand old voices It is in no desire to appease our critics but to open a free road to one of our strongest poets that we present this month Mr Neihardt s essay in poetic tragedy on the old Roman theme There may be value in contrast between April and May the issue is sharply drawn Perhaps both schools have their modern uses and the laurel will go to the stronger whatever his costume and his weapon  IN DANGER  How may a man be a popular poet and yet save his soul and his art this is a question which only the select few of any group or period are called upon to answer Some popular poets of course have no souls to save none at least which emerge above the milk and water current of their verse the Tuppers and Ella Wheeler Wilcoxes of their generation Others have no trouble with their souls they just sing naturally about common   sights and sounds the things all men know or feel or think they know and feel like Mr James Whitcomb Riley Eugene Field Bret Harte in his brief lyric moods or now and then Joaquin Miller that high hearted old democrat who now sleeps in his Sierras  No poet of these two so different kinds need ask himself the question Popularity is wine to these It makes the former more garrulous the latter more genial it is only mildly and amiably intoxicating But there is another class of poets with whom popularity is poison an insidious habit producing drug which dulls their minds and undermines their morals which once they yield to its control they must get and feed on at any cost With these even a little of the intoxicant goes to their heads and heels makes them totter and fall back and repeat themselves  I remember the cry of delight which greeted Paolo and Francesca a dozen years ago A delicate literary exercise was acclaimed as a great tragedy by the thousand and one journalists and woman s club orators who love a twice told tale And so under the insidious stimulus of their prompt applause Mr Stephen Phillips read up other ancient stories and put them into academic dramas of which each inevitably was a little weaker and staler than the last  Today with the same impetuosity Nan is acclaimed  as a great tragedy and Mr Masefield is in the same  danger In this case as in the other the poet s weakest   point derivative plot becomes his strongest with the crowd although Mr Phillips took his plots from old legend while Mr Masefield takes his from current popular convention Derived plot tempts almost inevitably to derived style and any suggestion of an old familiar tune helps with the crowd  POETRY has opened its hospitable door to Mr Masefield s admirers and detractors presenting in each case the extreme opinion Meantime to the more moderate view this poet seems to be in danger and The Daffodil Fields is the danger sign Here his taste for popular melodrama decoys him into a plot so absurd that it utterly destroys the poem And his allegiance to it leaves him in no mood for such stirring organ music as that long description of the ten days storm at sea which is the best of Dauber  In The Daffodil Fields this poet like Mr Phillips in his later plays is merely indulging his weaknesses  H M  POETIC PROSE AND VERS LIBRE  The essential difference between prose and poetry is in the quality of the rhythmic phrase The metric paraphrase of one of Oscar Wilde s prose poems recently published in a Chicago paper gave merely a typographical semblance of poetry Any attempt to turn the following poem into prose by omitting the line divisions would prove unsuccessful   THE POET  Out of the deep and the dark A sparkling mystery a shape Something perfect Comes like the stir of the day One whose breath is an odour Whose eyes show the road to stars The breeze in his face The glory of Heaven on his back He steps like a vision hung in air Diffusing the passion of Eternity His abode is the sunlight of morn The music of eve his speech In his sight One shall turn from the dust of the grave And move upward to the woodland  Yone Noguchi  Prose rhythms differ from poetic rhythms according to the inherent scientific divisions of the rhythmic wave lengths Those of poetry rise to a more concentrative stress regularly or irregularly recurrent and by the law of balance make strenuous demand on the poetic interval the pause The rhythm of prose has less range of rise and fall Its periodic waves cling rather closely to the horizontal level though permitting within this range a great amount of subtle variation It is interesting in this connection to call attention to the extremely limited scope of conventional English prosody A comparison of iambic pentameter lines taken from Shakespeare Milton Keats Swinburne and William Butler Yeats would reveal how inadequate is the old system of digital mensuration   Robert Louis Stevenson was one of the first to call attention to the rhythmic phrase division of poetry Taking a line from Shakespeare he found that apart from the five minor stressed syllables of the line there were three major crests marking the poetic phrase and that these were the more important of the two since around these the minor crests were grouped in sequence The musical analogy to the octave is suggestive and far less sterile than the old system of prosody which is more often proved false than true  A C H  REVIEWS  A Boy s Will by Robert Frost David Nutt London  I had withdrawn in forest and my song Was swallowed up in leaves  There is another personality in the realm of verse another American found as usual on this side of the water by an English publisher long known as a lover of good letters David Nutt publishes at his own expense A Boy s Will by Robert Frost the latter having been long scorned by the great American editors It is the old story  Mr Frost s book is a little raw and has in it a number of infelicities underneath them it has the tang of the New Hampshire woods and it has just this utter sincerity It is not post Miltonic or post Swinburnian or post Kiplonian This man has the good sense to speak naturally and to paint the thing the thing as he sees   it And to do this is a very different matter from gunning about for the circumplectious polysyllable It is almost on this account that it is a difficult book to quote from She s glad her simple worsted gray Is silver now with clinging mist  does not catch your attention The lady is praising the  autumn rain and he ends the poem letting her talk  Not yesterday I learned to know The love of bare November days Before the coming of the snow But it were vain to tell her so And they are better for her praise  Or again There was never a sound beside the wood but one And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground  My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make  I remember that I was once canoeing and thirsty and I put in to a shanty for water and found a man there who had no water and gave me cold coffee instead And he didn t understand it he was from a minor city and he just set there watchin the river and didn t seem to want to go back and he didn t much care for anything else And so I presume he entered into Anunda And I remember Joseph Campbell telling me of meeting a man on a desolate waste of bogs and he said to him It s rather dull here and the man said Faith ye can sit on a middan and dream stars  And that is the essence of folk poetry with distinction between America and Ireland And Frost s book reminded me of these things   There is perhaps as much of Frost s personal tone in the following little catch which is short enough to quote as in anything else It is to his wife written when his grandfather and his uncle had disinherited him of a comfortable fortune and left him in poverty because he was a useless poet instead of a money getter  IN NEGLECT  They leave us so to the way we took  As two in whom they were proved mistaken  That we sit sometimes in a wayside nook  With mischievous vagrant seraphic look  And try if we cannot feel forsaken  There are graver things but they suffer too much by making excerpts One reads the book for the tone which is homely by intent and pleasing never doubting that it comes direct from his own life and that no two lives are the same  He has now and then such a swift and bold expression as The whimper of hawks beside the sun  He has now and then a beautiful simile well used but he is for the most part as simple as the lines I have quoted in opening or as in the poem of mowing He is without sham and without affectation  Helen Redeemed and other Poems by Maurice Hewlett The Macmillan Co  Maurice Hewlett stands among the first dozen of living poets in England but this fact is constantly being obscured by his popular reputation for prose and by   Reviews  his lack of self intolerance albeit he keeps his stuff by him often for more than the seven years prescribed  His chief interest from the technical point of view lies in his skillful use of harsh rime to check the verse suddenly and to keep it in swift motion a system of barring which is efficient in a manner similar to the Anglo Saxon alliterative devices  Somewhat over a year ago The Agonists proved that he could write if not the only at least the most readable Greek Plays in English  The present collection of his verse Helen Redeemed and other Poems The Macmillan Co contains the title poem one hundred and twenty pages long in the regulation pentametric couplets with the usual inversions sometimesfortherime ssake the long similes etc cui amet  The three tales following are good tales well told Oreithyia Clytie and the Lai of Gaubertz so also the Gnatho We do not hesitate to praise them and if there is any stricture to be made it is so minute as to fall under the head of carping Maurice Hewlett at his best has seen the elder gods and known their progeny Such ventures will out No hiding Not even under the mask of the man of letters le grand seigneur or at worst the academician  The Oreithyia is perhaps as a whole the best of the idyls the Gaubertz shows best the knack of riming the Gnatho has I should say the finest single lines   There is also a genuine octave to the sonnet on page 208  that ends  I dare not love fearing my poisonous thought  It is significant or rather it is odd or oddly natural that Mr Hewlett should regard Sturge Moore as the best poet now in England For while no one can deny that Sturge Moore knows the feel of things knows the feel of the grass growing and of the running hare and while no sane man would withhold praise from parts of his work as in The Amazons still his results are not infrequently more like colours mixed on a palette than like a picture displayed  Ezra Pound  The Daffodil Fields by John Masefield The Mac  millan Co  In The Daffodil Fields Macmillan we have another of Mr John Masefield s rhymed histories of sophisticated rustics It is difficult to indicate to an admiring public the sources of discontent aroused by the cheapening of Mr Masefield s talent because in this cheapening Mr Masefield has so obviously hit upon that one touch of nature which makes for popularity  That Mr Masefield uses melodramatic themes is not in itself a sufficient implication of inferiority The Greeks used themes which strictly considered come under this heading but the term has arisen since the time of the Greeks to denote a certain sensational or sentimental rendering of a theme obviously harrowing and playing   upon the most vibrantly commonplace of human emotions It is in this sense that Mr Masefield is a melodramatic author of the first water and by this melodramatic virtue alone has he won popularity No not quite alone by this His poetic virtuosity enables many people to confuse issues and to believe with simple hearted naivete that the source of their enjoyment is their great love of the humanities and of art  Given a melodramatic theme and melodramatic treatment it matters little whether the actors be of flesh and blood or mere puppets worked by wires they will win the same amount of applause from the sentimental sympathies of the audience  And in truth whether in acted drama as in The Tragedy of Nan or in poetic narrative as in The Daffodil Fields Mr Masefield s characters are all puppets They do not move have no life of their own the action is static and this not because of the vast amount of geographical revery filling up the gaps but simply because in all moments of passion the poet endows his characters with the contemplative wisdom of a Greek chorus Not that the wisdom is their own nor that the comparison exists except by implication of design But if the characters were as platitudinously contemplative as the words which their creator puts into their mouths there would be no action whatever there would be no passion no bloodshed no tragedy Of course the contemplative commentary is Mr Masefield s own as   when masquerading in the petticoats of Nan in one of the prevailing high tides of that play he declares  There be three times when no woman can speak when er ears er lover and when er gives erself and when er little one is born  Not only must Mr Masefield s scenes of action be classed with still life his landscapes are equally lacking in spontaneity They are patched and descriptive like a badly painted picture His rhythm is monotonously commonplace and in passing one may note the poverty of a rhyming vocabulary which makes use of dear my dear or my beloved dear as line ends with irritating insistency  As to the story it has elements of Enoch Arden although less pacific and it culminates with the novel touch of a Shropshire Ophelia dabbling in the mingled blood of her daffodil lapped lovers A C H  NOTES  Mr John G Neihardt is one

delightful inquiry into the nature of poetry which will intensify the pleasure of those who love it and may well open the eyes and ears of those insensible to it But its prime value lies in the entertainment it gives for though its intent is serious indeed the wit humor and lightness of the writing make it the reverse of abstruse It should be read for its own sake  The poetic impulse in perception in conversation and in literature is one and the same It is the impulse to realize The author distinguishes this from the practical impulse which is to achieve or adapt oneself to an environment He traces these two impulses and illustrates them in the very beginnings of experience in the play of children in the origin and growth of language in slang and profanity in everyday conversation and finally in books of poetry and science  1 25 net by mail 1 35  CHARLES SCRIBNER S SONS Fifth Ave New York    ALFRED NOYES  latest book  TALES of the MERMAID TAVERN  Now Ready  Stories
