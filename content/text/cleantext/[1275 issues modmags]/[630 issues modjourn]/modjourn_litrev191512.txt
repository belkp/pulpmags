Little Review Sister SHERWOOD ANDERSON THE young artist is a womanand at evening she comes to talk to me 1 in my roomShe is my sisterbut long ago she has forgotten that and I have forgottenNeither my sister nor I live in our father s houseand among all my brothers and sisters I am conscious only of herThe others have positions in the city and in the evening go home to the house where my sister and I once livedMy father is old and his hands trembleHe is not concerned about mebut my sister who lives alone in a room in a house on North Dearborn Street has caused him much unhappinessInto my room in the evening comes my sister and sits upon a low couch by the doorShe sits cross legged and smokes cigarettesWhen she comes it is always the same she is embarrassed and I am embarrassedSince she has been a small girl my sister has always been very strangeWhen she was quite young she was awkward and boyish and tore her clothes climbing treesIt was after that her strangeness began to be noticedDay after day she would slip away from the house and go to walk in the streetsShe became a devout student and made such rapid strides in her classes that my mother who to tell the truth is fat and uninterestingspent the days worryingM y sistershe declaredwould end by having brain feverWhen my sister was fifteen years old she announced to the family that she was about to take a loverI was away from home at the timeon one of the wandering trips that have always been a passion with meM y sister came into the housewhere the family were seated at the tableandstanding by the doorsaid she had decided to spend the night with a boy of sixteen who was the son of a neighborThe neighbor boy knew nothing of my sister s intentionsHe was at home from collegea tallquietblue eyed fellowwith his mind set upon foot ballTo my family my sister explained that she would go to the boy and tell him of her desiresHer eyes flashed and she stamped with her foot upon the floorM y father whipped my sisterTaking her by the arm he led her into the stable at the back of the houseHe whipped her with a long black whip that always stood upright in the whip socket of the carriage in whichon Sundaysmy mother and father drove about the streets of our suburbAfter the whipping my father was illI am wondering how I know so intimately all the details of the whipping of my sisterNeither my father nor my sister have told me of itPerhaps sometimeas I sat dreaming in a chairmy mother gossiped of the whippingIt would be like her to do thatand it is a trick of my mind never to remember her figure in connection with the things she has told meAfter the whipping in the stable my sister was quite changedThe family sat tense and quiet at the table and when she came into the house she laughed and went upstairs to her own roomShe was very quiet and well behaved for several years and when she was twenty one inherited some money and went to live alone in the house on North Dearborn StreetI have a feeling that the walls of our house told me the story of the whippingI could never live in the house afterwards and came away at once to this room where I am now and where my sister comes to visit meAnd so there is my sister in my room and we are embarrassedI do not look at her but turn my back and begin writing furiouslyPresently she is on the arm of my chair with her arm about my neckI am the world and my sister is the young artist in the worldI am afraid the world will destroy herSo furious is my love of her that the touch of her hand makes me trembleMy sister would not write as I am now writingHow strange it would seem to see her engaged in anything of the kindShe would never give the slightest bit of advice to any oneIf you were dying and her advice would save you she would say nothingM y sister is the most wonderful artist in the worldbut when she is with me I do not remember thatWhen she has talked of her adventuresup from the chair I spring and go ranting about the roomI am half blind with angerthinking perhaps that strangefurtive looking youthwith whom I saw her walking yesterday in the streetshas had her in his armsThe flesh of my sister is sacred to meIf anything were to happen to her body I think I should kill myself in sheer madness In the evening after my sister is gone I do not try to work any moreI pull my couch to the opening by the window and lie downIt is then a little that I begin to understand my sisterShe is the artist right to adventure in the worldto be destroyed in the adventureif that be necessaryand Ion my coucham the worker in the worldblinking up at the stars that can be seen from my window when my couch is properly arranged The Little Review 5 Toward Revolution MARGARET CANDERSON Thanksgiving Day some five thousand men and

before he could shoot Joe HillIt might have awakened Capital and LaborOr why didn t five hundred of the five thousand get Joe Hil l out of jailIt could have been doneOr why didn t fifty of the five thousand make a protest that would set the nation gaspingThere are Schmidt and CaplanWhy doesn t some one see to it that they are released Labor could do itAnd there are the Chicago garment strikersWhy doesn t some one arrange for the beating up of the police squadThat would make a good beginningOr set fire to some of the factoriesor start a convincing sabotage in the shopsWhy aren t these things doneFor the same reason that men continue to support institutions they no longer believe inthat women continue to live with men they no longer lovethat youth continues to submit to age it

Review Preparedness Road to Universal SlaughterEMM A GOLDMAN R since the beginning of the European conflagration the people of Europe have thrown themselves into the flames of war like panic stricken cattleAnd now Americapushed to the very brink by unscrupulous politiciansby ranting demagoguesand by military sharksis preparing for the same terrible featIn the face of this approaching disaster it behooves men and women not yet overcome by the war madness to raise their protestto call the attention of the people to the crime and outrage which are about to be perpetrated upon themAmerica is essentially the melting potNo national unit composing it is in a position to boast of superior race purityparticular historic missionor higher cultureYet the jingoes and war speculators are filling the air with the sentimental slogan of hypocritical nationalism America for AmericansAmerica firstlastand all the time This cry has caught the popular fancy from one end of the country to the otherIn order to maintain America military preparedness must be engaged in at onceA billion dollars of the people s sweat and blood is to be expended for dread naughts and submarines for the army and the navyall to protect this precious AmericaThe pathos of it all is that the America which is to be protected by a huge military force is not the America of the peoplebut the America of the privileged classthe class which robs and exploits the massesand controls their livesAnd it is no less pathetic that so few people realize that preparedness never leads to peacebut is indeed the road to universal slaughterThe American military ring with its Rooseveltsits Garrisonsits Danielsand lastly its Wilsonsis moving the very heavens to place the militaristic heel upon the necks of the American people using the same methods of the German diplomats to saddle the masses with Prussian militarismIf it is successful America will be hurled into the storm of blood and tears now devastating the countries of EuropeForty years ago Germany proclaimed the slogan Germany above everythingGermany for the Germansfirstlast and alwaysWe want peacetherefore we must prepare for warOnly a well armed and thoroughly prepared nation can maintain peacecan command respectcan be sure of its national integrity And Germany continued to preparethereby forcing the other nations to do the sameThe European war is the fruition of the gospel of military preparednessSince the war beganmiles of paper and oceans of ink have been used to prove the barbaritythe crueltythe oppression of Prussian militarismConservatives and radicals alike are giving their support to the Allies for no other reason than to help crush that militarismin the presence of whichthey saythere can be no peace or progress in EuropeBut though America grows fat on the manufacture of munition and war loans to the Allies to help crush Prussianismthe same cry is now being raised in America whichif carried into national actionwill build up an American militarism far more terrible than German or Prussian militarism could ever bebecause nowhere in the world has capitalism become so brazen in its greed as in Americaand nowhere is the state so ready to kneel at the feet of capitalLike a plague the mad spirit of militarism is sweeping the countryinfesting the clearest heads and staunchest heartsNational security leagueswith cannon as their emblem of protectionnaval leagues with women in their leadhave sprung up all through the United StatesAmericanization societies with well known liberals as membersthey who but yesterday decried the patriotic clap trap of todayare now lending themselves to the befogging of the minds of the peopleto the building up of the same destructive institutions in America which they are directly and indirectly helping to pull down in Germany militarismthe destroyer of youththe raper of womanthe annihilator of the best in the racethe very mower of lifeEven Woodrow Wilsonwho not so long ago talked ofa nation too proud to fight who in the beginning of the war ordered prayers for peacewho in his proclamations spoke of the necessity of watchful waiting even he has been whipped into lineHe has now joined his worthy colleagues in the jingo movementechoing their clamor for preparedness and their howl ofAmerica for Americans The difference between Wilson and Roosevelt is this Rooseveltthe bullyuses the club Wilsonthe historianthe college professorwears the smooth polished university maskbut underneath it helike Roosevelthas but one aim to serve the big intereststo add to those who are growing phenomenally rich by the manufacture of military preparednessWoodrow Wilsonin his address before the Daughters of the American Revolutiongave his case away when he said I would rather be beaten than ostracized To stand out against the BethlehemDu PontBaldwinRemingtonWinchester metallic cartridges and the rest of the armament ring means political ostracism and deathWilson knows thattherefore he betrays his original positiongoes back on the bombast oftoo proud to fight and howls as loudly as any other cheap politician for preparedness and national gloryfor the silly pledge the Navy League women intend to impose upon every school childI pledge myself to do all in my power 9 The Little Review to further the interests of my countryto uphold its institutions and to maintain the honor of its name and its flagAs I owe everything in life to my countryI consecrate my heartmindand body to its service and promise to work for its advancement and security in times of peace and to shrink from no sacrifice or privation in its cause should I be called upon to act in its defense for the freedompeaceand happiness of our people To uphold the institutions of our country that is itthe institutions which protect and sustain a handful of people in the robbery and plunder of the massesthe institutions which drain the blood of the native as well as of the foreigner and turn it into wealth and power the institutions which rob the alien of whatever originality he brings with him and in return give him cheap Americanismwhose glory consists in mediocrity and arroganceThe very proclaimers ofAmerica firsthave long before this betrayed the fundamental principles of real Americanismof the kind of Americanism Jefferson had in mind when he said that the best government is that which governs leastthe kind of an America David Thoreau worked for when he proclaimed that the best government is the one that doesn t govern at all or the other truly great Americans who aimed to make of this country a haven of refugewho hoped that all the disinherited and oppressed coming to these shores would give characterquality and meaning to the countryThat is not the America of the politicians and the munition speculatorsTheir America has been powerfully portrayed by a young New York sculptor I know he has made a hard cruel hand with long lean merciless fingerscrushing in over the heart of the foreignersqueezing out its blood in order to coin dollarsNo doubt Woodrow Wilson has reason to defend these institutionsBut what an ideal to hold out to the young generation And how is a military drilled and trained people to defend freedompeaceand happinessThis is what Major General O Ryan has to say of an efficiently trained generationThe soldier must be so trained that he becomes a mere automation he must be so trained that it will destroy his initiative he must be so trained that he is turned into a machineThe soldier must be forced into the military noose he must be jacked up he must be ruled by his superiors with pistol in hand This was not said by a Prussian Junker not by a German barbarian not by Treitska or Bernhardibut by an American major generalAnd he is rightYou cannot conduct war with equals you cannot have militarism with free born man you must have slavesautomatonsmachinesobedient disciplined creatureswho will moveactshootand kill at the command of their superiorsThat is preparednessand nothing elseIt has been reported that among the speakers before the Navy League was Samuel GompersI have long ceased to believe what is reported in the pressBut if that is trueit signalizes the greatest outrage upon labor at the hands of its own leadersPreparedness is directed not only against the external enemyit aims much more at the internal enemyIt is directed The Little Review against that element of labor which has learned not to hope for anything from our institutionsthat awakened part of the working people who have realized that the war of the classes underlies all wars among nationsand that if war is justified at all it is the war against economic dependence and political slaverythe two dominant issues involved in the struggle of the classesAlready militarism has been acting its bloody part in every economic conflictwith the approval and support of the stateWhere was the protest from Washington whenour menwomen and childrenwere killed in LudlowWhere was that high sounding outraged protest contained in the note to Germany Or is there any difference in killingour menwomen and childrenin Ludlow or on the high seasYesindeedThe menwomenand children at Ludlow were working peoplebelonging to the disinherited of the earthforeigners who had to be given a taste of the glories of Americanismwhile the passengers of the Lusitania represented wealth and stationtherein lies the differencePreparednessthereforewill only add to the power of the privileged few and help them to subdueto enslaveand crush laborSurely Gompers must know thatand if he joins the howl of the military clique he must stand condemned as a traitor to the cause of laborIt will be with preparedness as it has been with all the other institutions in our confused life which were created for the good of the people and which have accomplished the very reverseSupposedlyAmerica is to prepare for peacebut in reality it will prepare for the cause of warIt has always been so and it will continue to be so until nation refuses to fight against nationand until the people of the world stop preparing for slaughterPreparedness is like the seed of a poisonous plant placed in the soilit will bear poisonous fruitThe European mass destruction is the fruit of that poisonous seedIt is imperative that the American workers realize this before they are driven by the jingoes into the madness that is forever haunted by the spectre of danger and invasionthey must know that to prepare for peace means to invite warmeans to unloose the furies of death over land and seaYou cannot build up a standing army and then throw it back into a box like tin soldiersArmies equipped to the teeth with highly developed instruments of murder and backed by their military interests have their own dynamic functionsWe have but to examine into the nature of militarism to realize the truth of this contentionMilitarism consumes the strongest and most productive elements of each nationMilitarism swallows the largest part of the national revenueEven in times of peace almost nothing is spent on educationartliteratureand science in comparison with the amount devoted to militarism while in times of war everything else is set at naughtall life stagnatesall effort is curtailedthe very sweat and blood of the masses are used to feed this insatiable monster militarismUnder such circumstances it must become The Little Review 11 more arrogantmore aggressivemore bloated with its own importanceIf for no other reasonit is out of surplus energy that militarism must act to remain alivetherefore it will find an enemy or create one artificiallyIn this civilized purpose militarism is sustained by the stateprotected by the laws of the landfostered by the home and the schooland glorified by public opinionIn other wordsthe function of militarism is to killIt cannot live except through murderBut the most dominant factor of military preparednessand the one which inevitably leads to waris the creation of group interests which consciously and deliberately work for the increase of armament whose purposes are furthered by creating the war hysteriaThis group interest embraces all those engaged in the manufacture and sale of munition and in military equipment for personal gain and profitFor instancethe family Kruppwhich owns the largest cannon munition plant in the worldits sinister influence in Germanyand in fact in many other countriesextends to the pressthe schoolthe churchand to statesmen of highest rankShortly before the warCarl Liebknechtthe one brave public man in Germany nowbrought to the attention of the Reichstag the fact that the family Krupp had in its employ officials of the highest military positionnot only in Germanybut in France and in other countriesEverywhere its emissaries have been at worksystematically inciting national hatreds and antagonismsThe same investigation brought to light an international war supply trust which gives a hang for patriotismor for love of the peoplebut which uses both to incite war and to pocket millions of profits out of the terrible bargainIt is not at all unlikely that the history of the present war will trace its origin to this international murder trustBut is it always necessary for one generation to wade through oceans of blood and heap up mountains of human sacrifice that the next generation may learn a grain of truth from it allCan we of today not profit by the cause which led to the European warcan we not learn that it was preparednessthorough and efficient preparedness on the part of Germany and the other countries for military aggrandizement and material gainabove all can we not realize that preparedness in America must and will lead to the same resultthe same barbaritythe same senseless sacrifice of lifeIs America to follow suitis it to be turned over to the American Kruppsthe American military cliquesIt almost seems so when one hears the jingo howls of the pressthe blood and thunder tirades of bully Rooseveltthe sentimental twaddle of our college bred PresidentThe more reason for those who still have a spark of libertarianism and humanity left to cry out against this great crimeagainst the outrage now being prepared and imposed upon the American peopleIt is not enough to claim being neutrala neutrality which sheds crocodile tears with one eye and keeps the other riveted upon the profits from war supplies and war loansis not neutralityIt is merely hypocriticalNor is it enough to join the bourgeois pacifistswho proclaim peace among the nationswhile helping to perpetuate the war among the classesa war which in reality is at the bottom of all other wars It is this war of the classes that we must concentrate uponand in that connection the war against false valuesagainst evil institutionsagainst all social atrocitiesThose who appreciate the urgent need of cooperating in great struggles must oppose military preparedness imposed by the state and capitalism for the destruction of the massesThey must organize the preparedness of the masses for the overthrow of both capitalism and the stateIndustrial and economic preparedness is what the workers needThat alone leads to revolution at the bottom as against mass destruction from on topThat alone leads to true internationalism of labor against Kaiserdomkingdomdiplomaciesmilitary cliquesand bureaucraciesThat alone will give the people the means to take their children out of the slumsout of the sweat shops and the cotton mills that alone will enable them to inculcate in the coming generation a new ideal of brotherhoodto rear them in play and song and beauty to bring up men and womennot automatons that alone will enable woman to become the real mother of the raceto give to the world creative menand not soldiers who destroyThat alone leads to economic and social freedomand does away with warEllie MARY ALDIS She came to do my nailsCame in

PrzybyszewskiALEXANDER SKAUN Out of the effervescent hurricane of light burst forth a terrible songDespairas if thousands of graves had torn openAs if the heavens had rent asunderand the Son of Man had descended upon the earth to judge the good and the wickedMillions of hands rose up to heaven in a mad horror of death hands that prayed for mercy and charityHe heard a beastly roarwhich like a geyser of a smoking sea of blood spurtled upward and above all this he saw bony fingers that twisted and writhed in convulsions of fear and shouted to heavenAd te clamamus exules filii Hevaead te supiramus gementes et fientes And he saw a multitudinous crowd that was lashed with an insane ecstacy of destructionand above them a heaven that yawned with disease and fireHe saw how those miserable creatures wriggled and serpentined in hellish madnesses of lifehe saw the bleeding backs furrowed by the whips into chunkshe saw all humanity dementedobsessedwith an inspired frenzy in the bestialized eyesSlowly disappeared the procession of the doomedwild cries intoxicated with despair died away in a death rattleand a sunred like coppershed a chatoyant green light on the poodles of blood Ad te clamamus exules filii Hevae The Little Review 17 This is a fragment from an early poem of PrzybyszewskiDe ProfundisIt is a proper background to all the works of the Poleto his playsessaysnovelspoemsAt least I see him in that lightA reminiscenceOn a rainy autumn night I went to hear him lectureand if the psychologists will find contradictions in my wordsI shall not feel dismayedThere are contradictions that are dearer to me than most perfect consequentialities From the dim light of the platform ached a face distorted with contempt and sufferingwith the grim clairvoyance of the BeyondAt moments the eyebrows leaped up and bulged the forehead into thickstrained furrowsand the eyes suddenly burst in a flash that revealed unknown worldstwisting your soul with awe and mysteryBut soon the flame would extinguishand the face would resume the masque of contemptuous wearinessthe mouth corners congealed a satanic would be smile that prepared one for his famousHehheh That face haunted me for many days and nightsas if my inner vision had been scalded by an unearthly chimeraM y friendswho have seen his exaggerated portrait painted by Krzyzanowskiwill understand meThose who will read his worksif they are translated will understand meHomo Sapiensis but a nuance of his multiplex creative spiritthough perhaps a most characteristic nuancePszybyszewskilike Nietzschelike Wildeis a unique mosaiquein which the personalitythe artisthis life and his worksare inseparableindivisible units of the wonderful wholeWho can fathom this hellish cosmosthis mare tenebrarum of the modern man s soulwhich the mad Pole has traversed and penetrated to the bottomand has cast out shrieking monsters and gargoyles illuminated with blindingdazzlinginfernal flamesI cannotPerhaps only pale glimpses of reflectionsThose who have heard Przybyszewski play Chopin tell us that no virtuoso can compare with his creative interpretation of his melancholy compatriotIn his profound essay on Chopin and Nietzsche I have been impressed not so much with the morbid theory as with the characteristic feature present in all his work the reflection of his own personalityIn his favorite artistsin his heroesin his womenhe has painfully sought an expression of his restlessboundless selfThus Chopin becomes one of the numerous selves of PrzybyszewskiLet me picture the Composer in the light of the PoetSpecifically Slavic featuresextreme subtility of feelingeasy excitabilitypassionateness and sensuousnesspredilection for luxury and extravaganceandchief of alla peculiar melancholy lyricismwhich is nothing Homo Sapiensby Stanislaw PrzybyszewskiNew YorkAlfred AKnopfbut the expression of the most exalted egoismwhose sole and highest criterion is his ownI Theseand the profound melancholy of his native limitless plains with their desolate sandy expanseswith the lead skies over themhave been influences keenly contradicting his flexiblelight vivaciousness of the Gallichis coquettish effeminacyhis love for life and lightSubtracting the last two strokeswho is itChopin or Przybyszewski The trait most obviously common to both Poles is the unquenchable yearningthe eternal Sehnsuchtwhich niters through all their productionsIn neither of them was it the yearning of healthy naturesin whomas in a mother s wombit bears the embryo of fruitful lifeit is not the yearning of Zarathustrain a sunny rapture of ecstacy greeting newunknown gods with an exaltedEvoiChopin s longingas reflected in Przybyszewskiis tinted with the pale color of anemia peculiar to a representative of a degenerate aristocracythe Poet s progenitor died of delirium tremens with his transparent skin projecting the tiniest veinswith his slender figure and prolongated limbs that breathe with each movement incomparable gracefulnesswith his overdeveloped intellect which shines in his eyesas in the eyes of frail children who are doomed to early deathThis longing is the incessant palpitation of a nervousover delicate naturesomething akin to the constant irritability of open woundsthe continuous change of ebbs and flows of morbid sensitivenessthe eternal dissatisfaction of acute emotionsthe fatigableness of a too susceptible spiritthe weariness of one oversatiated with sufferingYet this longing has in it also wild passion the convulsive agony of deadly horror self damnation and thirst for destructiondelirium and madness of one who strains his gaze into the vast and sees nothingIndeed I should like to hear Chopin s Preludes recreated under the longing fingers of StanislawStanislaw PrzybyszewskiDo pronounce it correctlythat you may hear the sound of rain swishing through tall grassPrzybyszewski has come to know himself so thoroughly and unreservedlyandin himselfto know the modern man of the widest intellectual and artistic horizonsthrough a long excruciating internal purgatoryFrom the study of architecture and general aesthetics his restlessever searching spirit hurled him into natural sciences in the hope of finding positive answers to his burning questionsHe came out loaded with an enormous baggage of facts and informationyet he had not quenched his everlasting

rather sayhas descended into deepest hell ArtAn equipment hardly appropriate for an artist who seesLife Itselfin color and fragrance and petals and varicolored mornings and varicolored nights and Japanese prints andbut you may find the catalogue in the Editor s rhapsody of last monthPrzybyszewski s back ground served him as an Archimedean lever to gauge and fathom the soul of modernityLet me attempt to present the quintessence of Przybyszewski s modern Individuumas he prefers to call an exceptional personalityHe considers himself a supermanaloof from the market interests of the crowdHe is conscious of the fetters of his instincts and of the gradual sapping of his strength hence the history of the Individuum turns into a sad monography of suppressed will and distorted instinctsa history of a mountain torrent which cannot find an outletand rushes into depthdissolving obstructing stratadestroying and washing them awayand ruining the structure of the rocks in their very bowelsHence the longing for liberation and the yearning for expansea perilouspalpitating Sehnsucht and craving of the heightsof the beyond But this longing has another distinctive symptom the consciousness of its hopelessnessthe clear conviction that the passionately desired goal is but an idée fixeIn this longing is expressed a spirit that ruins everything in itself with the corrosive acid of reasona spirit that had long lost faith in itselfthat considers its own activity diffidently and criticallya spirit that spies and searches itselfthat has lost the faculty of taking itself seriouslythat has become accustomed to mock itself and to play with its own manifestations as with a ball a spirit not satisfied with the highest and finest human perceptionsthat has come at lastafter many searchingsto the gloomy decision that all is in vainthat it is incapable of surpassing itselfHence the pursuit of enjoymentBut this morbid seeking of enjoyment lacks that directself sufficient bliss that results from the accumulated surplus of productive strengthThe modern Individuum is deprived of that healthy instincttherefore in place of naive joy experienced from the liberation of surcharged power he plunges into self forgetfulnessAll his life is reduced to pure self narcotizationIn the morbid straining of his abnormally functioning nerves the Individuum decadent rises to those mysterious borders where the joy and the pain of human existence pass into one another and interminglewhere the two are brought in their extreme manifestations to a peculiar feeling of destructive raptureto an ecstatic being

of a stormsomething akin to the passionate tremor of delirious impotencesomething similar to the consumptive flush of spiritual hysteriaIn such clinical terms Przybyszewski sees the modern homo sapiensThrough this prism I perceive his Falkdoomed to utter failure and futilityFalk an erotomaniac NonsenseHis sexual relations are as pathological as the functions of his other facultiesnot moreIn his incessant search for an outletfor dischargefor some quantity that might fill up his hollowed heartFalk grasps woman as a potentional complement to his emptinessHe failsnaturallyTo the artist woman is a narcotizer and wing clipper more often a Dalila or Xantippe than a Cosima Wagner or a Clara SchumannNeither the exoticism of Ysanor the pillow serviceability of Yaninanor the medieval fanaticism of Maritnor Olga s revolutionary resignednesshave the power of checking the hurricane of his questing spirit for more than a momentsuch moments when the tormented man erects for his consolation a phantombe it a superman or a ChristFalk s quest for self forgetfulness is futileHe lacks the healthy capacity of usnormal beingsfor finding salvation in befogging our visionNo matter how we may indulge in self analizationwe usually stop at the perilous point and brake our searching demon with the same happy instinct that closes our eyes automatically at the approach of dangerFalk s mental motor has no brakesit hurls him into the precipice I have never suffered on account of a woman boasts the old rakelitis Because your organism is very tougha peasant s organismmy dear litisYour sensibilities have not yet reached the stage of dependence upon the brainYou are like a hydromedusa which suddenly parts with its feelers stocked with sexual organs and sends them off to seek the femaleand then does not bother about them any moreYou are a very happy creaturemy dear litisBut I don t envy you your happinessI never envy the ox his enjoyment of grassnot even when I am starving Przybyszewski s Individuum seeks in woman the miraculous expression of his most intimatemost preciousI He speaks in one place about the love of theanointed artist which is a painful conception of an awful unknown force that casts two souls together striving to link them into onean intense torment rending the soul in the impossible endeavor to realize the New Covenantthe union of two beingsa matter of absolute androgynismFor such an artist love isthe consciousness of a terrible abyssthe sense of a bottomless Sheol in his soulwhere rages the life of thousands of generationsof thousands of agesof their torments and pangs of reproduction and The Little Review 21 of greed for life Now recall Falk s dream He saw a meadow clearing in his father s forestTwo elks were fightingThey struck at each other with their large hornsseparatedand made another terrific lungeTheir horns interlockedIn great leaps they tried to disentangle themselvesturning round and roundThere was a crunching of hornsOne elk succeeded in freeing himself and ran his horns into the other s breastHe drove them in deeper and deepertore ferociously at his flesh and entrailsThe blood spurtedAnd near the fighting animals a female elk was pasturing unmindful of the savage struggle of the passion mad males In the centre stood the victor trembling and goryyet proud and mightyOn his horns hung the entrails of his rival The epitomy of the sex problemheh heh I don t envy the ox his enjoyment Przybyszewski despises happiness as something unworthy of an artistA happy soulhe believesis a miraclethe squareness of a circlea whip made of sandThe soul is sombrestormyfor it is the aching of passion and the madness of sweepsliving over ecstacies of boiling desirethe stupendous anxiety of depths and the boundless suffering of beingFor the artist who creates the world not with his brainbut with his soulall life is onesale corvee a filthy burdeneternal horrordespairand submissionfruitless struggle and impotent stumblingFor this reason lovethe greatest happiness for ordinary malesbecomes for the artist the profoundest disastrous sufferingTake away from Przybyszewski his ecstacy of painand you rob him of his very essenceof his raison d etreof his creative breathWhen you read his Poems in Prose you face a soul writhing in hopeless despairin futile longingin maddening convulsionsBut you cannot pity the artistYou are aware of the sublime joy in his sorrowof the unearthly bliss that is wrapped in the black wings of his melancholyIn his poem At the Seathe elemental yearning of his soul reaches cosmic dimensionsOnly one other poem approaches it in its surcharged grief Ben Hecht s Night Songif we overlook the latter s redundancyAllow me to give you a pale translation of theIntroiboto At the Seamay the Pole s spirit forgive me my sacrilegious impertinenceINTROIBO Thouwho with ray clad hands wreathest my dreams with the beauty of fading autumnwith the splendor of off blooming grandeurwith

SapiensDiscussed by Readers In another place I called Homo Sapiensthe book of the age Surely there has not been a more stirring work of literature since WertherWill the public respondIs it true that the wall of American indifferentism is impregnableI am still optimistic about the intellectual aristocracy of this countrythat small circle of the young in spiritbrave searchers and earnest liversfor whom art and life are not merely diversions between meals and business transactionsbut the italicized essence of existenceTo those few Przybyszewski s book should appealthose should reactI have been getting curiousand at times interestingopinions of such readersI hope to receive moreand acquaint the Little Review family with themOn the wholethere prevails a note of depression and uneasinessOne writes I had hoped to be left alone on a mountain peak in a blaze of light and in the stress of windinstead there is a sardonic laughand I 23 The Little Review am again hurled into the maelstrom of a

has become imbeddedThat terriblewonderful FalkIt makes you shudder away from all temperamental people with experimental souls in their fingersand few convictions I became paralyzed with horrorAt last I cried outwrithed on the floor and prayed to some Powerany Powerfor pitynot to see myselfnot to see life beneath the superficial surface Go awaytake your Slav fingers out of my soul They force me to look at truthwhen I want to deal in liesThey force me to climb the heights and peer into the hideous crevasseswhen I want to browse fatuously on the hillocks More suchdrunken dreams and the comfortable blinders will fall off the eyes of the happiness by all means fiendsI submit two letters of friends who have read my article and wished to supplement my viewsI humbly think that what they say is included in myreflections but I am also conscious of my inherent fault conciseness which borders on obscurityHence clarification is gratefully welcomeIWhat you say about Przybyszewski I also thinkBut what you do not say about Homo Sapiens is what I feel most of allThere is something very definite about Homo Sapiensthe bookIt rises out of the mass of flaming gibberishdissected nervesand poetical slashingsIt rings in the ears long after the book is closedIt is the most poignant cry of the dying nineteenth centuryand it comes out of lower depths than the cry of Dostoevsky s Raskolnikovshrillermadderand more penetratingEric Falk is not a nuanceHe is the whole of Stanislaw Przybyszewskithe whole of modern wisdom and introspectionwhich is another word for degeneracyCome nowpretend I am not reviewing itPretend I am something of a clairvoyantSee Przybyszewski creating him Erick FalkHe is sitting at his deskHe is going to write a book about mannot a typenot a silhouettebut about Man completeHe wants the final man of his daythe Homo Sapiensthe Zarathustran phantomThis Przybyszewski is a thorough fellowa biologista poeta physicianan historiana psychologistHe lives on an operating tableKnows his own insides Come hereZarathustra chuckles this Przybyszewskiand he coaxes him off the heightsoff the peaks where he is waiting to be fed by the eaglesAnd striding from the peaks comes ZarathustraWho do you suppose it isPrzybyszewskiof courseThey greet each otherAnd Przybyszewski says to this self of his So you are the ultimate clayhaha And this self answers Yeabehold in me the finite evolutionman crowned by his own hard and subtly won gloriesCome here purrs PrzybyszewskiRememberhe is talking to himself at his deskHesitatingfrowningand yet with the pure grimace of superiority stamped on his facethis self approachesAnd the book is onPrzybyszewski s inspiration is the fury of a madmanthe derisivediabolical chuckling of a fanatical cynic Come nowwe will fly whispers Przybyszewskiand off they go the innocent Zarathustra and the steepedslashbuckling PrzybyszewskiAnd remember still they are oneAnd the rest of it is the plot of Homo Sapiensthe bookwhich I will skipThus Eric Falk soars and Przybyszewski shows the sorry mechanics of his wingslaughingchucklingfor they are his ownThus toward the middle of the book you begin wonderingFalk is going to piecesFalk the immutablethe all knowingthe transcenderthe the the the Homo SapiensWhat is the matterWhen he betrays a woman and causes her death a hideous vapor suddenly envelopes his soul and befouls itPrzybyszewski thrusts his radiant leer from behind Zarathrustra s mask and hisses Conscienceha And thus it goes its merry wayTo the edge of the precipice this mad Pole pushes his whirling Falkto the utter edge of known reasonknown psychology and known PassionsAnd then suddenly the soarer fallsThe mechanism comes clattering to earth to the bottom of the precipiceThe lugubrious Stanislaw has led his creation himself to the limitsHe has finished his bookPiled on the desk lies the heap of glowing sentencesthe history of rhapsodic vivisectionPrzybyszewski has expressed himselfHe has uttered his most internal crythe cry of a poeta weaver of plotsan anatomical expertof an introspective vulture minded DisbelieverAnd now I call your attention to MrPrzybyszewski at his desk too tired to riseGone are the golden thrills that quivered in himgone everything but the thin sardonic grin that lights the face of Eric Falk on the last pageAnd only Eric Falk s last cry Vive L Humaniteis left him25 The Little Review So our Stanislawthe idol of Bohemiathe tortured demonsits chucklinga glass of cognac trembling in his fingers Homo Sapiens he sighs with his inevitable sneerthat pierces through his pity and pain like the point of a rapier behold thyselfThouEricart manThou art the creaking vehicle for the golden theoriesthe rainbow fantasies which have sifted out of the mental mists of the centuryAnd beholdthou creakestthou groanestthou breakest under this lightest of burdens The tired Przybyszewski quiversHis lipsmocking their way through the delirious poison of thought and passion have kissed the intangibleHe has stripped his brain to its last cell and looked at itAnd the cry that rises out of the book comes condensed from his lips now after it is doneNowhere is it writtennowhere is it heard except at Stanislaw Przybyszewski s desk in BohemiaIt is the answerhaIs it Homo Sapiensthou art clayThy mind is a super chaosThy soul is a petty mirage IIPrzybyszewski transplants his readers from their ordinary mental environment into those astral regions where metaphysical subtleties are clothed with realityLife is dealt with not on the surface strata of its expressions but at its base where motives and ideas and emotions have their sourceAnd in spite of this factor rather because of the uncanny clairvoyance of its author there is no perversion or befogging of one s point of viewThese nebulous regions are lit up by the ruthless penetration of an artist who is a scientist as wellOne s first sensations are like seeing for the first time with the naked eye the fan of nerves which spread out from the corona radiataor touching the single nerve trunks with the dissecting knifeIn the same manner the pathological Pole brings you into actual contact with the cargos of these nervesideasemotionssensationsAll the concealing layers of evasions and of equivocations have been dissected awaythere lies spread out before you sections of naked consciousnessAnd so subtle has been the dissecting work that there has been no disarrangement and no deathAll is still livingstill functioningAnd your sensation of strangenessalmost of horroris born out of revulsion against a self consciousness so intense as to seem almost morbid I feel said a friend of mine as if I had been vivisected Not so much this as that one has been vivisectingPrzybyszewski compels you to co operate with him in analysing psychological phenomenaAt moments you lift your eyes from the pagepantingalmost physically exhausted from the effort of concentrating on those tortuoussubtle reactions which occur in the farthest recesses of consciousness and spread upward in waves to the surfacewhere they often take on curious irrelevant expressionBut that is sheer morbiditycries your friend the PhilistineIt is introspection carried past the point of decencyBut to the investigator there is no point past which it is indecent to pressIn him there is no affectation of scruple to erect its artificial barricadeHe must have transcended all such petty egotism and have depersonalized himselfHe is constrained to this by that curiosity which is his master passionwhich generates itself and is dynamic in him as hunger or sex are dynamic in the ordinary individualThis curiosity of the artist brooks no boundsshort of the facts against which it brings up abruptlyAnd so Przybyszewski for all his uncanny subtlety cannot be accused of morbidity since he uses it not to distort but merely to reveal the truthIf he has no false reverence neither has he irreverenceHis scalpelalways flashing and leapingpauses a moment on a state of emotion andpointingcalls it by name For I am I says Falk I am a criminal diabolic nature Or again And so a certain man is suffering from love induced by auto suggestionVery wellBut at the same time he loves his wife unqualifiedlyAnd he loves her so much that there can be no doubt of the reality of his loveIn a word he loves both the one and the other But such a condition isn t possiblethe Philistine will cry outwounded at his most vulnerable pointhis inflexible principlesA man can t love two women at the same time This isolated case would undermine the whole monagamistic theoryHe sees one of his cherished institutions totteringAnd so he takes fright and refutes the fact It can t beit isn t possible But Przybyszewski continues to stand with the scalpel wearily pointing M y dear Sirthis is no question of postulatesit s a question of an individual instanceIt is possiblebecause it occursFalk does love two women at the same moment And the Philistine will doubtless turn away snorting furiously and unconvinced Przybyszewski he will sneer that degenerate Polealways half drunk with cognaca Slav to bootWhat does he know of life or realityThey were all neurasthenicsLook at Artzibashev and Andreyev and DostoevskyYeslet us look at themand remembering Dostoevsky s epilepsyremember also RaskolnikovA criminal s psychology lifted onto paper out of the limbo regions of consciousness by the mammouth Russian s bloody penSomething more than neurastheniathis gift of analysisWhatfinallyis Homo Sapiens Who is this writter fellowFalkwith no consciencewith hiscriminaldiabolic nature Does he only exist to analyse himselfand his tortuouspainful psychologizings Why is hewhat is heHe is the self conscious manpar excellenceThis book is the epic of consciousness The thing must be thought out says FalkAnd nuance by nuance it is thought outrapidly but faithfullyunder your very eyesYou are invitednocompelledto take part in the operationHence your feeling of fatigueAnd againafter a page or two He examined his own feelings 27 The Little ReviewBut why a Falk the Philistine demands Falk is no average manHe is a geniusand as such his psychology is specialized and distinctFalk is a neurasthenicvictim of erotomaniaEven his lucidity is not to his creditSince he is a writer it is implicit in himas muscle is in the circus riderHe is bound to analyse his actsto trace them back to their motivesFalk presents an isolated caseIf one is going to deal with consciousness why not choose a less precocious exponentWhy not the everyday consciousness of the average human being And by the same tokenwhy not a FalkMrPhilistinesince we are agreed that this is a drama of consciousnessOf what use is the average man in this extremity The artist is the Homo Sapiens par excellencefor it is in him that consciousness has reached its most complex differentiation I am says Falk what they call a highly differentiated individualI havecombined in meeverything designambitionsincerity of knowledge and ignorancefalsehood and truthA thousand heavensa thousand worlds are in me And recognizing this fact he wrestles with it through some four hundred odd pagesThat Falk loved two womenor ten womenis not only possiblebut probably inevitableWhat in the average man is a temperate reaching out for a few specific joys becomes in a Falk the impulse of his whole being for self expressionIt bursts out along a thousand channelsrequiring as many outward aspects as there are sources in his personalityAnd it is this devious stream of a human consciousness that we are following outward to its expression in words or actsand backward to its sourceas we dissect with Przybyszewski Falk s mental protoplasm Futile sneers the Philistine utterly futileIf that is a Homo Sapiensgive me a submanYour Falk knew no happiness and he gave noneHe only strewed suffering in his wake both for himself and othersHe was without scruples and without conscienceWhere did he get to with all his differentiationHe wrote a few booksto be surebut what were they in the scale of the women he ruinedthe men he did to deathEven of his own miseryHis gift of introspection was a sharp knife turned against himselfsince he cried out in the endto be chemically purified of all thoughts Homo Sapiens indeedYou can see Przybyszewski wearily twisting the scalpel in his nerveless handsyou can see the smile that twists his lips just before they curve about the waiting cognac glass Nohe was not happyit is true he did strew misery in his wakeHe was neurasthenic and degenerate and criminalHe was all these things and all the other things which you have forgotten or never perceivedFor he was Homo SapiensAnd such as he is I have drawn himHaha Vive l Humanité The Spring RecitalTHEODORE DREISER

the memorable occasions of your lifeThe Foreigner in America ANTIN is talking all through the country of the wonderful things America does for the foreignerThese things are not trueI went the other night to an affair given by a Norwegian woman and her husband before a gathering of Chicago s representative intellectualsThe woman Was Borgny Hammeran actress of tremendous power from the National TheatreChristianiaMmeHammer plays Ibsen so well that there is not much chance of her playing it very oftenOn this particular evening she gave some Björnson things and talked with naive fervor of Norway as compared with this commercialized landHer intensity was so authentic and so beautiful and so moving that it became almost pitiable in that stiffself contained roomMmeHammer could be playing Ghosts and Master Builder and Beyond Human Powercould be giving nightly inspiration to thousands of unimaginative Americans if America had was able to offer the foreigner one tenth of what the foreigner brings to AmericaNot long ago the Hebrew Institute of Chicago refused its platform to Alexander Berkman who was to speak there on the Schmidt and Caplan caseSome one who sympathized with the action of the directors explained to me that it was a wise move on their part because the foreignersespecially the Russian Jewsare so easily inflamedThank heaven they areIf only something could be done to inflame the AmericanWell there is always the flagThe Russian Class group for the study of Russian literature will have a preliminary meeting in room 612 Fine Arts Building on FridayJanuary 141916at 8 pmAll interested are invitedThe Little Review 37 The Illusions ofThe Art StudentE has made its appearance in this city of ours a new magazineThe Art StudentIts desireaccording to the editor s announcementis tohelp establish a bond of understanding between the American student of the allied arts and the public This aim is commendable and deserves the co operation of everybody unselfishly interested in the promotion of American artThe reason for this publication at the present time is also given in that announcementIt says there With all Europe at war and its art centers crippledit is not only America s opportunitybut her dutyto preserve and promote art in its various forms I am afraid the youthful enthusiasm of The Art Student is the cause both of this exaggeration as concerns Europe and the illusion as concerns AmericaWe have heard much and read more about America s opportunity these last fourteen monthsFirst it was the trade fields deserted by the warring nations in South America and the Orientthen it was the sea routes closed to the second biggest merchant fleet of the world the opportunity for an American merchant marineand now it is our opportunity in the field of ArtWhat has become of the first illusions of which our papers and magazines were fullEngland expanded her commerce in South Americahaving forced for the time being her German rival from that field of hottest competitionand Japan practically monopolized the commerce of ChinaEngland increases her merchant fleet by capering American shipsand the Pacific Mail retires voluntarily from the Pacific oceanThat is the result of our boasted opportunity in the realm of trade and commerceWhyBecause we underestimated others and because we talked about our own foreign methods instead of changing our own and actingAnd now in Art we are doing exactly the same thingWe point with horror to the war that cripples European art and acclaim loudly the superiority of our civilizationGentlemenyou are all wrongArt is not crippled in Europe through the warInter arma silent musaeThe arts are silentthey sleepSilence and sleep we all understand are good thingsThe first helps us to concentrate and find ourselvesthe latter gives us new strengthAnd that is the worst that the war does to Art in EuropeArt is at present less activea self imposed inactivityowing to circumstancesnot crippleda result of

Europe GarnerinThe TheatreGrotesquesCloyd Head Maurice Brownecomparatively misty namesfar below the golden monolith at whose base is carefully engraved the wordGranville BarkerMrBarker resurrects Greek tragedies and Shakespeare plays and produces them acceptablyGoyd Head and Maurice Brown have evolved an absolutely new stage method and draped it about a poetic conceptTherefore Cloyd Head and Maurice Browne will probably be heralded and worshipped ten years from nowat the earliestThey must pay the penalty of originality and the ability of appreciating itIn Grotesques recently produced at the Chicago Little Theatrefor the first timeactors posed as black and white marionettes in a series of decorations created by Fatemasquerading as a sardonic artistThe idea of 39 The Little Review Fate moving human beings together as one shuffles a pack of cards is oldBut the portraying of this shuffling through conventional decorations with the actors giving the jerking semblance of puppetsand with Fate personifieddirectly addressing the audienceis sparklingly newCapulchardthe artisthas made a decoration symbolizing the background of life an utterly simple picture composed of a conventionalized black and white wave effecta black skya round white moonstiff white treesan owl on one of their branchesand a lotus flowerFrom his marionette boxes at both sides of the decoration he drags forth his puppets man motifwoman motifcrone motifsprite motifgirl motifand carelessly waves them into various posesthe main incidents of their livesBut they gradually become aware of himthey begin to speak out of their linesto burst into tiny rebellions which he controls with difficultyThey show increasing determination to mar his series of decorationsFinally in a moment of sublime defianceheaded by the man motifthey slash their stringsThe result DeathCapulchard carelessly erases the decoration it has served its purposeI shall probably fully drain Grotesques after slowly reading it again and againBut even nowCloyd Head s huge child whose face is like the pointed petals of sun flowershas aroused a little cluster of reactions within meTo sharply visualise the playyou need not see the actual black and white of the decorationand the uber marionettes who move stiffly through itThe words of the play themselves are black and white you feel them as an inextricable part of the picturethere is something in their stacatto rising and falling that suggests light and darkness evenly spread upon a canvassSomething in the even placing and sounding of phrases like this Who am I that cometenderly the sign of birdGirlin whitealonebeside the pattern brookwander without fearof fear not having heard It is not easily explainedIt is a feeling that can only come to one after repeated reading of the playA second reaction comes to one while loitering with the images in their jerking processionEach imagewith its absolute minimum of wordshas two clear virtues the expression of emotion half human and half artificialand the concentration of just enough of this emotion to produce an illusion of the wholeConsider this speech of the sprite motif Tiptoe a tread thru the wood by the brookthe sprite enters ohho Dancecrinkled stream Ha a dragon fly poised upon air BlowsBegoneIt is nightMadame OwlTo whoo A n actual sprite soul in life would babblewould use more extravagant phrasingIn this sprite passagejust enough of the babbling and exuberance has been givento suggest the essence of itjust enough words have been givento suggest the steady motion of the invisible stringsThese equalities run throughout the speeches of all the uber marionettesBook Discussion Plays for Small Stagesby Mary AldisNew YorkDuffield and CompanyThese plays are among those acted by the Lake Forest Playersandwritten especially for themthey exemplify certain qualities of drama and stage craft which are of special value in amateur productionFirst of all they are real in situationTwo of the fiveMrsPat and the Law and Extreme Unctiondeal with slum lifebut with phases of it which the amateur can study at first handand isindeedthe better for studyingThe juxtaposition in both types of the submerged tenth and the reachers of helping hands suggests that the plays have in factgrown out of such studyThe former sketch is done with a brilliancy of Irish humor and fancy that reminds the reader of Lady Gregory s bestThe latter is the grim tragedy of a dying prostitute a situation relieved first by the mordant irony of the conventional religious pouncet box of the well meaning lady visitorand later by the sympathetic imagination of the physicianA third playThe Drama Classpresents with broad humor an occasion familiar to all uplifters of the drama in regions which on theculture mapare lightly shadedthe discussion of a modern European play by a woman s clubThe Letter and Temperament represent the maladjustments of monogamy the one with tragic emphasisthe other in pure farceThe point should be notedhoweverthat all five are plays of situationstatic rather than dynamicexpository and revealing rather than developing the type most suited to the dimensions of the one act playand made familiar by the playwrights of the Abbey and Manchester TheatresAs MrsAldis says in her preface41 The Little Review speaking of the general policy of the Lake Forest Players In selecting plays we have departed radically from the amateur tradition of resuscitatingplays with a punch which have fared well in the hands of professionalsIn the established tricks of the tradeof course the amateur cannot compete with the professional In writing as well as in selecting plays for amateur performance MrsAldis has wisely preferred truth of situation to thepunch In the second place MrsAldis has made her characters speak the language of life rather than that of the stageThis trait again fits her plays for amateur productionespecially in a small theatre where effects can be gained without the emphasis of stage talkWorking as she says for a small stage MrsAldis has been able to reproduce with striking fidelity not only the vocabulary but the movementthe rhythmeven the intonations of human speechThis kind of naturalism is of great importance in the drama of situationThe words in which MrsAldis calls attention to this connectionand to the possibilities of artistic success in amateur acting depending thereon might have occurred in Maeterlinck s essay The Drama in Daily Life We seek she says plays in which the mental attitude and the interplay of character are more important than the physical actionHereif anywherelies the amateur s opportunitySo we are not afraid of plays with little action and much talkIt is in talklow and intensegay and railingbitter and despairing as the case may bethat we moderns carry on the drama of lifethe foundation of the drama of the stageRobert MLovettThe State ForbidsA Play in One Actby CowanNew YorkMitchell Kennerley The mother speaks The State won t let us

hampered and bound by conventionalities and surroundingsNo one is bound down who knows that freedom comes from withinnot from withoutThe girl in the factorythe girl in collegethe girl in her own homeor the girl out of doors can be just as free as she makes up her mind to beFreedom is not a matter of clothes or environmentAs to conventionalities most of them have been formed because time and culture have taught us to have regard for our fellow beingsThere is nothing immorally wrong in a man going to the opera in his shirt sleeves but it might not be agreeable to the gentleman seated next to himThen the psychology of the close relationship between thoughts and actions free thoughts result in free actionslikewise carelessness in our habits of daily life make careless thinkingI believe in keeping your own individuality above all things if you can back up your ideas by good reasonsbut you will find that there is a reason for most conventionalities that can t be overthrownIf we were not an integral part of a whole we could do just as we pleased because no one would be affected and no one would carebut everything we doevery move we makeaffects some part of the wholeand that is why we care and why everybody caresStick to your idea of freedom and of being naturalbut be careful how you apply it and of its effect on othersWhatever is good and helpful will live and what is not good

strange poetand in his desire to learn the life story of the man the traveler finds a hidden history of love and tragedyIt is the story of Anthony Sorel and Anna Quartermaine whose romantic love and its woeful ending is ever the theme of the stories of these simple country folkWith hushed voices they tell how Anthony s determination to seek the ideal life sent him away in fear lest he should transgress in loving a woman of the worldof Anna s love for him that bade her follow him to his hut in the mountainswhere they met at twilightSorel believed her to be the fairy woman of his dreams and when he realized that the woman before him was Anna he was maddened at his failure to escape her charms and the terrible things that happened then haunt the place forever like a banshee never at
