FOREWORD ANDANNOUNCEMENT WITH this number we close the fifteenth volume of thisMagazine." The Mask " has preached a good bit — but ithas also done as it preached. Not always, but whenever possible.It serves — as best it can, and we believe that there is no truetheatre lover who is not its friend.With its next number The Mask begins a new volume. Butnot only a new Volume.A NEW PERFORMANCEIT intends to revise its entire programme.— It may be twice the size or half its size — and its price willprobably be new.It may not appear until April, it may come out in June: it mayappear as before in Florence or it may shift its head quarters to Paris,Rome, or London: and it may offer its readers some surprises; but itwill let you hear of what ever it does in good time.Why this indecision ?The Mask generally worn is inscrutable — we never knew a maskthat wasn* t.Let this fleeting expression of indecision lend life then for the momentto these its old and steady features. THE MASK Publishers• HENRY IRVINGHIS VOICE BY GORDON CRAIG. IT was brought against Irving that hecould not speak our English tongue,the English language, his mother-tongue,our mother-tongue.This accusation lasted for some twentyyears or so, after which folk gave up tryingto teach Irving how English should bespoken.Irving, never deaf to criticism, triedto speak as neatly, as nicely, as any suck- ing dove, but, when ever he grew excited,as is customary with great actors, he wouldreturn to his old way of utterance.He would say " for God;thrut dug for "cutthroat dog"; "the rup frum mey nek" for Take therope from my neck ; " " Riz " is how hepronounced the word "rich"riz -riz - riz, he repeated, this as some will re- member, during the Dream scene in " The Bells " where he imagines he is in a fieldand, axe in hand, awaiting the coming ofthe Polish Jew.He hears the bells of his sledgeafar off coming nearer and nearer andRiz -riz - riz - riz,he went on growling andhissing as they went on ringing. The effectof the z instead of ch was this : insteadof the sound reminding us of an old housewife shooing the fowls from the kitchendoor, we were horribly thrilled, as at theominous sound of the serpent (theabout to spring, and we were aware thata duet between the regular throb of thebells and this voice was being sung. Atthe end of a long-sustained series of thesesounds, riz-riz-riz, he did spring — he struckdown the imaginary Jew, and fell in aheap on top of him. Again, in " Mac- beth the passage "To trammel up the consequence " became in his mouth " tram- mell up-p the cuncequnce " — a sharpdivision of the two M's, a brief stop afterthe first, second, and the fourth words.To our English ears other English actorswere less curious — they were easier. Withthese speakers, it was " do drammel ub zegonseqvence,"or " to tr"— and if this last was a simplification ofa puzzle, it will be admitted that ' tis adifficult word to hear, to believe in, andremember.For " good, " Irving said " godsight " was " seyt " stood " wasstod " smote " became " smot" hand " was often " hond " or " hend ".In short, he seemed to make wordsricher rather than poorer — it may havebeen an illusion but to us speech becameexpressive instead of what in England isthought to be refined.And I was far away from Irving, when,one day in 1919, I rode from Sabbionetato Casalmaggiore, and as I rode, beganto read a 16 th century ballad aboutRobin and the potter. The good oldEnglish song begins like this: -In schomer, when the leves spryng,The bloschems on every bowe,So merey doyt the berdys synge,In wodys merey now.It is not too easy to read smoothly asyou ride in an old four-wheeled rackettycarrozza on the billowy side-road leadingout of Sabbioneta, so I took the balladtwice as slowly line by line, reading eachword aloud to myself, so that the soundswould strike above the noise of the car- rozza, keep tune and time, to my earand make good through the hearing whatwas strange and puzzling to the eyes.I had not read more than four to" jiveverses when I felt I was in Nottingham- shire ; it was summer, green willows andaspens were on each side, birds sang in the wood —it was pleasant. I went on untilsomething like the fourteenth verse, whenI was up to an old trick of mine and mypencil was marking the book, and down inthe margin went the two initialsnot once, but five or six times. But 1went on quickly, and forgot H. I. forRobin Hood.Opening this book some years later, Isee these pencil marks, and 1 think I willcopy out the verses around which, forsome evident purpose, they flutter as thoughsome little nest was hidden there.These were two of the verses besidewhich 1 find my pencilled H. I. s: — andthe words underlined which reminded meof his voice: —Togeder then went thes twoHet was a god seyt to se;Therof low Robyn hes men,Ther they siod onder a tre.Leytell John to hes felow hes seydeYend potter Welle stonde.The potter, with a caward stroke,Smot the bokeler out of hes honde.Then come several more /. s, againstsuch lines as: - " Hes bokeler at feltewhat we call " his " but whichis here pronounced fette, like wet-t: and" I well prey the, potter and" what ys they name seyde the potter ".On reading the whole ballad again, thistime indoors, 1 am no longer in Notting- hamshire, 1 am at the Lyceum Theatre,and 1 become very aware of Irving, andI hear again as it were the fine voice ;and as I listen to this pure old Englishstrain, 1 think how odd it is that alwaysfor preserving the best do men laythemselves open to the attacks of theirfellows.For this is the old English speech, andIrving brought back to us something ofthose ripe old sounds — and damme ifwe didn't object. Some fifty years before Irving' s time,2,000,000 English school boys were beingtaught by some 8,000 English school masters,mistresses and ushers to say " God " andmean the Almighty; the o was insisted on;it was to sound noble - i.e., frozen; itwas to sound like the word " Gourd "." Once again, Billy, Gourd ".... " No,Billy, Gourd ".... Billy tries, and then says" Guud ".... " Now Billy, I give you twomore chances before 1 use my prerogative ".Billy, trembling before the whistling shadowof the prerogative, drops one u the more -then another, and, in a burst of religiousfervour and dashing for it comes outwith " Gorrd "; and the deadly and thehard once more triumph over the real andthe beautiful.And so by Irving's time all " o " swere hard and deadly, all "e"s werebrayed or mewed, all double "oo "s be- came " u " s, and " a"s were flattened;all kinds of contortions were employed tobring out the full nobility of every voweland the sweetness of each consonant, andnow on the day of victory, the nation hugsto its breast its immense defects.It comes to it, that it was becauseIrving's calling permitted, even expected,him to boil when about to speak, that,availing himself of this permission and doingas he was expected, he came to speakEnglish as I believe it should be spoken,that same good rich English spoken in thedays of Robin Hood, and long before andafter.It was an unfortunate thing for Irvingand his critics; for while they both agreed,theoretically, that " ° " should be pronoun- ced like " o" and not like " u , Ir- ving fell from grace every time he gotnear an "o": and uttered it like a "u'and his critics, while theoretically quitein sympathy with him, had in the presenceof an enlightened public to rap him sharply over the knuckles for what they con- sidered sheer carelessness. "Do I say"Gud " when I say " Gud" ? " askedIrving ; and it had to be admitted withsundry apologetic coughs that hethough some had the grace to add "butyer Inglish is perfict, mi dear fellar".And so, while Irving's was " perfictInglish", it was none the less asseveratedthat he could not speak our mothertongue — that his amazing range of soundwas monotonous !" Apres Fesprit de discernement, ce" qu'il y a au monde de plus rare, ce" sont les diamants et les perles", saysLa Bruyere ; and indeed, if something rarebe worth the having, it is well to waita long time before asserting that an Irvingcannot speak English, a Lope de Vegacannot write plays, a Rossini cannotcompose an Opera, and a Bruegel cannotdraw. Yet this is what we hear, andhave heard continually, year in and yearout — and Byron is no poet, Mozart nomusician, and Mussolini cannot rule.To sum up, Irving was not only agreat actor, he was a polished actor inas much as he spoke perfectly, and movedfaultlessly, amongst people who for themost part spoke sloppily and moved with- out significance.Late in life, he said to an old friendone day, on reading in a newspaper afresh attack on his "de" of speechand deportment, "For one who can nei- ther speak English nor carry himself likea human being, I seem to have gotpretty far". GIOVANNANTONIOSELVA VISITSENGLAND.LEAVES FROM ANARCHITECT'SITINERARY BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE P. B. SPACCATO OF SELVA'S "TEATRO LA FENICE" IOVANNI ANTONIO SELVA was born, according tomost authorities, on June 13, 1753 in Venice;some however put the year as 1 755.He died in Venice January 22, 1819.Selva was architect and art historian. He was pupilof Temanza (1705-1789) 44 a man of extraordinarymerit " who in 1 778 published a work on the 44 Livesof the most excellent Architects and Sculptors of Venice ".Selva is perhaps best known as being the successfulentrant in the 1788-1790 competition for the buildingof the Teatro La Fenice in Venice, inaugurated onMay 17 1792.This competition was an interesting one for severalreasons. To begin with not one of the first 39competitors is mentioned by Milizia in his 44 Lives".Nor by Russell Sturgis A. M. Ph. D. in his Dictionary of Architecture; yet several famous archi- tects competed, among whom were CosimoMorelli of Imola, Pistocchi of Faenza andCossetti of Colorno.ijj There were eighteen designs sentin and twelve models. Where can anyof these models be? They would be allworth seeing. I possess the original setof Designs, by Cossetti. It is a verylarge oblong book containing some dozendrawings in colour which are certainlytechnical achievements of no mean order rthe text, though written, looks as if it wereprinted. But I keep on wondering whoit is can possess the other designs and themodels ?There is one set of designs whichshould be curious, those by a certainOnorato Vigano. Filippi does not mention him, nor does Sturgis; nor Milizia.Could it possibly be the dancer OnoratoVigano who, for this once, so ambitiouslypirouetted into the realms of architec- ture ? who knows ? if so he was stillwriting Ballets, making up Ballets, in 1 799in Venice, in the very Teatro Feniceerected by his rival Selva, and his sonSalvatore Vigano was dancing in them.Onorato had even designed the Balletfor the opening night in 1792, May 16or 1 7 (the authorities differ as to the day).When Onorato died, or when hewas born, 1 have not discovered in anyof the seventy books which 1 possess onthe Dance. What is the matter withthese historians! ...or Onorato?Besides all this, the Teatro la Fenicearoused a good deal* of discussion whenit was put up, and even before.His Excellency the Procurator AndreaMemo came out with a volume of a hundredpages, which would seem to caution folkagainst the project by Selva which wasinteresting the people who were to payfor it.Selva's project was submitted in theform of a model, not designs; doubtlesshis designs were under lock and key, safein his own house — and they call artistsunpractical !Cosimo Morelli, always enthusiasticallyactive in building Theatres, came out withhis design and the explanation of it in avolume which has an interesting foldingplate — which " The Mask " must re- produce unless forestalled now that I'vedrawn the attention of the ferrets to itsexistence. — Also for " The Mask " Ishall search to discover something aboutthe dancer Onorato's designs; — they mayhave been his, or may be he had speculatedin a design and put his name to it.But to return to Selva.In 1780 he visited London and Paris; when in Paris for the second timein 1 781 he carried out " with satisfactionto the Ambassador Dolfin " an illuminatedtransparency of an allegorical nature in theambassador's palace to celebrate the birthof the first son to the king in the monthof October — that poor Dauphin whodied on June 3rd 1 789.In November 1 781, taking the Alsaceroute, Selva returned to Venice, wherehe prepared the Box at the TeatroSan Benedetto for the reception of the" Conti del Nord " under which title thehereditary Grand Duke of Russia and hiswife travelled in Europe in that year.In 1791 he began building theTeatro la Fenice, first contemplated in1 788, and completed by May when itopened with " I Giuochi d'Agrigento ",a Drama in Musicain three acts byConte Alessandro Pepoli : Music byGiovanni Paisiello. Also a ballet," Amore e Psiche " by Onorato Vigano.In 1 799-1800 Selva submitted designsfor a new Theatre to be built at Trieste,which were accepted; the builder wasFrancesco Zucca, and the Theatre openedon April 2 I st 1801.Selva died in Venice on January 221819, of apoplexy, while walking alongthe Riva degli Schiavoni, but they didnot close the Fenice in his honour that day or on the day of his funeral. LordByron who was in Venice at the time,does not mention the fact of his deathin any of his letters.Selva was not so very famous, thoughfew better Theatres were built at that orat any later day than his Fenice.In 1836 the great opera house wasutterly destroyed by fire on the night ofthe 1 2th of December 0) and the Medunabrothers assisted by Tranquillo Orsi (1 791 -1844J erected it afresh in seven monthsupon Selva's plans, and it was openedon January 30th 1838. How faithfullythe Medunas followed Selva is madeevident for the first time by printing sideby side the two designs — that of I 790and that of 1837. (See pg. 139).I have come across Selva's Notes onAstley's Amphitheatre with a rough planof interest to English students, even thoughthe notes are in the hand of Baccani hispupil, for the Theatre he visited was thefirst one built by Philip Astley in 1 773and burnt in 1 794. (2)Three times Astley had fires whichwere devastating, and three times he rebuilthis circus.Interesting too are Selva's notes onfamous English houses. Cav. Giovanni Baccani made a copyof this Selva manuscript and it is this copywhich I possess and from which these extractshave been taken: it consists of eighteendouble leaves of paper, sewn looselytogether. Whether the original in Selva'shandwriting still exists I do not know.In the year 1837 F. Lazzari, writinga biographical Note on Selva in the " Bio- grafie degli Italiani Illustri " says it is in hispossession.This copy of Baccani's was madesomewhere near the year 1833.Baccani was born in Florence about1 792 and flourished in the first half ofthe 19th century, and flourished so wellhe became almost as well known as hismaster and probably more successful.In 1824 he reconstructed the PalazzoBorghese later called the Casino; in 1832he designed the monument for the funeralof the Grand Duchess of Tuscany. Hewas living at Casa Baccani No. 4604Piazza Santa Maria Novella in Florence inthe year 1838, and in 1845 designedand built the campanile of Santa Croce.I don't care much for Baccani's work,but a few sketch books of his which cameinto my possession contain a number ofvery endurable pen drawings of bits ofarchitecture — not sketches, but carefuldrawings — many plans — and, whatpleased, and decided me to purchase thebooks, many Theatres.Beyond this I have been able to gatherlittle information regarding this diligentpupil of Selva's, this enthusiastic youngman who later in life lost perhaps someof his buoyancy as he settled down atNumber 4604 Piazza Santa Maria No- vella in 1845, to jolly well damn Florencewith the ugliest campanile it possesses,but to remind all sentimental lovers oflate English architecture of the beauties of the Earl's Court Road.

June 11th 1798 the magistrateof the town accepted the plansof the architect Giannantonio Selva*This Theatre, the largest in Trieste,changed its name five times. Firstit was called " Teatro Nuovo then44 Teatro di Trieste "; in 1820 "TeatroGrande"; in 1861 "Teatro Commu- nale ", and, by unanimous vote of thecity Council on January 29th 1901 itwas renamed, presumably for the lasttime, " Teatro Giuseppe Verdi ".It is curious, in the little Guide toTrieste published about 1907 to findthe secretary to the Magistrate, IgnazioKollmann, writing that the project ofthe Teatro Nuovo was executed fromthe design of Matteo Pertsch, honorarymember of the Academies of Roma,Venezia, Bologna and Firenze and cor- responding associate of those of Parmaand Napoli. The documents possessedby the archives of Trieste do not,according to Giuseppe Caprin, whopublished a brochure on the subjectin 1801, in any way indicate thiscollaboration, attributing the work tothe Venetian artist Selva. In fact, sofar as the exterior of the building goeswe suspect that all that Pertsch didwas to make a few modifications ofthe first plan by Selva.Selva had, without in any waydeserving it, many enemies, who recog- nized neither his vast culture nor hislofty and noble taste, but only enviedhim his influential relationships and hisfriendship with Canova, and lost noopportunity of wounding him.When the Teatro Fenice of Ve- nezia was brought to completion theinscription SOCIETAS was set uponthe attico as a reminder that the buil- ding had risen by the will of the membersof the Teatro S. Benedetto. Selva's en- emies at once composed this epigram;—SINEORDINECUMIRREGULAR1TATEEREX1TTHEATRUMANTONIUSSELVAAnd when, after his death, as aperpetual memorial, his bust was setin the atrium, the same foes of thearchitect manifested their ill-will afresh.

SELVA IN ENGLAND.EXTRACTS TRANSLATED FROM THEMANUSCRIPT ACCOUNT OF HIS TRAVELS r I 1HE Fine Arts in England, although pro- tected, have never attained perfection.In Painting the English have only beenLandscape and Portrait Painters; now theybegin to devote themselves to the Historic,but are not very successful in Heroic subjects,even in the History of their own country. OfSculpture one may judge from those works inWestminster Abbey ; there are few whichdo honour to the Nation. (The Fine Artscannot endure mediocrity). The two pieceswhich are now being erected to MilordChantan will be the best, and SignorBacon, who is their author, does himselfmuch honour, although he has not been inRome.Architecture is in little better state. TheEnglish character is dry and poor. They areobservers of the good rules but withoutunderstanding in what consist the ultimaterefinements of the Arts; thus, although theycopy the works of Palladio existing in theVenetian state, they do not produce the sameeffect. Inigo Jones has been their bestArchitect, and, if he truly entered into, andsucceeded in, the Art, Palladio was his guide;and, had the English carried out his projectfor the Palace for the King of England, hecould boast of a fine achievement. One mayknow this from the portion accomplished,which is called White-Hall or Bang nettingHall; in it the whole and the parts are inadmirable accord. The and thework are executed with understanding. Ibelieve it to be the best piece of Archi- tecture which the English possess. Fromthis Palace the unfortunate King Charlescame out when he was beheaded.Horse-Guards. The House for themounted guards is too heavy.€| The Palace of the King could not bemore clearly indicated for a sovereign. It wasonce a convent. It looks upon St. James'sPark, and, in the same park there is thePalace of the Queen. The Palace of theQueen belonged to a Duke who had built it for himself, nor is there anything Royalabout it.St. Paul's is by the Cav. Cristofolo Wren,begun in 1670 and completed in 1725. Iexpected to see an amazing thing but foundthe descriptions given of it to be exaggerated.The interior could not be worse in bothdesign and execution. The exterior is muchbetter, but of two orders, which robs it of themajesty which it might possess were it of oneorder only. That which pleases me is thecupola which has a stately drum with isolatedintercolumns. Inside it is entirely bare ofpaintings and sculptures.The churches in London are very numerous,and, especially in their exteriors, magnificent,but of bad Architecture.The Reformed religion does not usepainting in their decoration, or at most apicture on the communion Altar, and this,perhaps is one great reason for the scarcityof Historic Painters in England, owing tolack of exercise. (l)St. Stephen's is a very clebrated church,but is not a building which impresses itselfupon connoisseurs ....At Covent Garden, a piazza in whichthere is the fruit market, there is a church ofInigo Jones which is very beautiful in itsexterior fagade, which is like a vestibule ofthe Tuscan Temples described by Vitruvio.Westminster Abbey.The church isGothic, and magnificent for those times.What principally distinguishes it is the tombsof the illustrios personages of England. It isa monument to the robust thought of theNation because the Sovereign, the Philosopher,the Artist&lt;2) is there not distinguished save byhis own merit, in the Chapel of St. Michaelthere is the monument of Giuseppe GascoigneNightingalle and his wife, of picturesque&lt;lesign, executed by Rubliac.The Bridges are which cross theThames : that of Westminster, Ponte Nuovo(New Bridge) and the other of London(London Bridge) : the first is the most elegantand the second the most magnificent.La Rotonda,or the Pantheon is a buildingwhere, in the winter, masquerades are held, concerts and balls given. The principal sala(saloon) is a Rotonda where the Architecthas sought to imitate, and perhaps, according tohimself, to perfect, the Pantheon of Rome, butit is very far from it. None the less onecan regard it as a whole as one of the bestbuildings erected in this century in London.The said sala,for its vast size and itsdecorations must, especially when illuminated,produce an amazing effect. The subterraneanspace below it, supported by a pilastrone (a largecolumn) in the centre, serves for dispensingthe Tea or other refreshment. Other roomsare not lacking, appointed to necessary uses,but it is a pity that the external Fagade doesnot indicate a place destined to pleasure.In the said building I have seen theexhibition of various paintings on glass byMa. Pearson. The principal of these is for awindow of Salisbury Cathedral 1 7 feet wide,21 high, representing the lifting up of thebronze serpent in the wilderness. Thesingular artefice of this painting is that themetal and the lead which hold together thevarious pieces of glass do not interrupt theoutline either of the figures or the robesbecause they follow the outlines of the partsof both the one and the other. The ironties are high rather than wide, and the leadis on the outer side. For example, so as notto surround a head in profile, one makes atthat point a mass of hair and similar devices.The specchio (l) is laid on upon either sideand serves the purpose of white. Greens, reds,blues and yellows are the colours reproducedbecause they come out well.Renelach (Ranelagh) is a garden outsidethe city where one can go to promenade,after dinner, paying a shilling a head. Thereis also an immense round two-storied woodensala. The first story is a series of arcades;between there are some arcades with openrecesses. There is a loggia all round above.The vault is supported by a central pillarwhich contains the fireplace; in all therecesses of the arcades and around the hearththere are tables prepared for taking tea andcoffee, which may be taken as one pleases,without further payment than the two and ahalf shillings (half a crown) as the entranceadmission. The illumination is lavish. Thereare some lamp-holders which, two by two, form a balance, so that as one rises the otherdescends; they are formed of circles andhinges of iron, and, upon the circles, restglass vases in which the candles are set;thus there is no danger that they drip overthose who pass beneath.At the bottom of the garden there is acasino with an upper terrace from which oneoverlooks a wide extent of country. Fromthis casino one descends to the river and,with boats, one can cross over to Fox-all(V auxhall ?) which is a garden beyondWestminster Bridge, near to Georges Fields,which is open in the summer, and where en- trance is permitted on payment of one shilling.At night it is all illuminated with lanterns,and there are great avenues of coloured lightsin patterns. In the middle of a great avenueof trees which encircles the enclosure thereis another covered passage as protection fromthe damp, and there are a number of tablesat which to eat, both in the succession ofrooms which adjoin the covered passage, andscattered about the garden. In the middlethere is a loggia with an orchestra where theysing canzoneite, arte and some(At Renelach too it seems there is music).At the end of a viale there is a transparency;at the end of another an illuminated pyramid,and like entertaining objects. There is ascene depicting a well imitated water-fall,in case of rain there are two large halls,where everyone can stroll about, and thereis there another loggia for music.The Teatro di (TheHaymarket Theatre) serves for the King'splayers during the summer. The constructionof the English Theatres differs from the Italianand French methods. In the afore-mentionedthere are three tiers of open loggie (boxes)in the French style. The first runs all round,but the two others, after a certain number ofboxes, incline to follow the oblique line oftwo amphitheatres which are opposite thestage and above the first tier of boxes which,as has been said, run without a break. Theceiling also follows the curve of the boxesand the amphitheatre.In the Teatro d'Astley^(Astley's(2) Thea- tre) beyond Westminster Bridge one sees per- formances of horses; and views of London,and of the labours of Hercules, are also shown. The Theatre is of good construction sinceit is round. The one half serves to containtwo tiers of gradinate in the form of anAmpitheatre, and the other half is occupiedby the stage and by two lateral decorations.The flat central space, or platea, is forthe use of the horses. The roof seems as ifmade of sugar and has but amongus they are called alia and thissugar loaf is sustained by a drum-like structurewhich contains various windows. It is a goodTheatre and could inspire good ideas for asmall theatre for tragic and comic representa- tions.L Accademia Reale (The Royal Academy)of painting, sculpture and architecture is thebest London building of these times. TheArchitect is Sig. Chambers, a Man of genius;it is called Somerset House. In the principalfagade which is in the Strand the entranceis not nobly emphasized because it is a suc- cession of equal arcades ; the opposite fagadeis better. The vestibule is adorned withmodels taken from the antique, and, on thesomewhat steep staircase, there are somechiara-oscuri painted by Sig. Cipriani. Onthe ground floor there is the hall of thegessi (plaster casts) and another appointedfor the reception of the pictures that aresent in by the Academicians; in this theceiling is in various compartments in antiquestyle, and there are two pieces painted by thesignorina Angelica Kaufmann, the others beingby Mr. West.On the second floor there is a large hall,where the exhibitions are held, the win- dows which light it being of opaque glass.The most magnificent things, and thebest as Architecture, are the Palaces ofNorthumberland, of Milord Spencer, of the •Duke of Marlborough, of Burlington, ofCarlton, Leicester, York, etc. In that of theDuke of Devonshire there is a superb Galleryof pictures.The house of Miledi Hume in PortmanSquare, is a piece of architecture by Mr. Adamand is held to be the finest work of thisEnglishman. It is all painted by sig. AntonioZucchi. It is rich in material and loadedwith ornaments, but too minute and lackscharacter.La Casa di Mortega (Montague House?) near there is the design of sig. Stuart. Thevestibule preceding the Staircase is decoratedwith ionic columns, and, in the angles, Doricpilasters. It also is loaded with ornament,in the doors are set mirrors, and picturespainted upon copper and varnished.The house of Mr. Locke is also on thesame site. It possesses various fine ancientmarbles, but, above all, a quoit-player whohas just thrown one quoit and holds theother in his hand: a Torso of Venus whichcan bear comparison with that of the Medi- cean Venus: a fine head expressive of grief,and many models from the best Italian sculptors. NOTES ON SOME ARTISTS. MR. Copley, in the great sala of Spring Gar- dens, exhibits a picture representing thedeath of Lord Chatam called Pitt who diedsuddenly in the House of Lords. Pitt issurrounded by his three sons and supportedby the Duke of Cumberland and the Dukeof Portland, this forming the first group. Thesecond group is composed of the great Offi- cials of State, and the third of the bishopsand other Peers. All the heads are portraitstaken from life painted with great truth, onlythe perspective is not well observed in thegradation of colour because the last groupcomes too far forward.Sig. Cipriani Fiorentino. t2' His drawingis most correct, but his colour is not alwaysquite happy. Sig. Adam, Architect-Authorof the book Antichita della Grecia that isto say di Spalatro: but since those Antiqui- ties are not of pure style, he has formed amanner somewhat trite and minute.Sig. West, Historic Painter of merit.He composes well but his colouring is notfine. To me it seems that he composes andsucceeds better in national subjects than Inthe Heroic. Sig. Gainsborough, an excellentPortrait-painter, has an admirable touch withthe brush and much force. His pictures seemsimply sketched with uncertain outline, but,when seen from a distance, they produce theeffect. He also paints Landscapes and Ani- mals. Sig. Bacon is the best English sculptor.At the present time he is doing two (4) for Lord Chadan.One will go toWestminster Abbey, the other to the city.He is an artist who, although he has notseen Rome, has attained a high rank.Sig. Giuseppe Reynolds is a manneredpainter. He seeks the Venetian colouring butadopts colours which quickly over-load the sha- dows. His reputation surpasses his merit. Ihave not seen muhc in his composition.Sig.Lottemhourg, Landscape Painter. Hismanner is a little crude because he does sovery well on the stage. Sig. Burch is the mostable engraver in gems. Sig. Nelechen 2) is amediocre Sculptor. Sig. Flaizman is anothersculptor who promises much. The Sig. An- gelica Kaufmann, a clever paintress, has leftLondon this year for Italy; she is married toa Venetian Painter Sig. Antonio Zucchi whohas applied himself to painting views of Archi- tecture.Sig. Bonomi is a Roman Architect andis first Giovane (Apprentice) of Sig. Adam.f41Mr. Webbs is another Architect who doesvarious things.Signer Tiberio Cavallo, a Neapolitan, is aman who has been for some time past inLondon and who has devoted himself tophysics, particularly to Electricity....Signor Paradisi is a learned man. Sotoo Dr. Sheper.Signor Townley (1737-1807), 7 ParkLane, Westminster (B. D. O.) is a very richindividual who has a fine collection of ancientstatues among which, is a superb bust ofChizia. |N the shops of wooden Furniture such aschests of drawers, cupboards etc. the workhad not a fine finish.There are however some fine woodsof natural tints, and the pieces in colouredinlay please me more than those of Franceboth for design and execution. Often theyadd a varnish to the woods, especially whenthe ornaments of the piece of Furniture arepainted.In the midst of the Piazza known asChariss Cross, which is the most elevated site of Westminster, there is the equestrianstatue of Charles I.The Temple is a fine quarter of the Citywhere the jurisconsults and students of lawreside. It is adorned with Courts and walks.It is divided into the Inner Temple andMiddle Temple: both have their Librariesand halls in which the Advocates live incommon during term time, that is, in thefour periods of the year in which the Lawcourts are held at Westminster.Temple Bar is the most modern Post;the heads of the rebels are set on it.Parco di James (St. James's Park) hasabout two miles of circumference; there is agreat canal which is fed by subterraneanwater, which comes from the ebb and flowof the Tamigi (Thames).Grean Pare is different from this ; in italso there is a good promenade, and whenone comes out, traversing a great roadway,one enters Hyde Parkmuch larger than theother two, and which extends to Kensington.The principal piazzas of London arePortman, Grovenor, BerklGolden, Cavendis, Bedford etc. Allthese piazzas have a garden in the centre sur- rounded by iron railings, and everyone can enterwho has a window looking on. the saidPortman Place is a superb street, mag- nificent in size and truly Royal. Thesignori Adams have erected the buildingsthere, and in Adelphi they have built someprivate houses magnificently. GREEN WICK. I—IERE is the famous Hospital of the InvalidSailors, a Building divided into fourseparate parts. The part which overlooksthe Thames is of better architecture than therest which forms as it were the greatcourtyard. Each sailor in the greatcorridors has his own wooden room separatedfrom the others, and all is kept with muchpropriety. Upon an eminence there is theobservatory. OXFORD. J HE Colleges which together form theUniversity are twenty in number. Thereare moreover five academic establishments orhouses not incorporated in the University. The Public School of the University isa Building of a bad Gothic, where, in thegreat court, there are various halls for thedifferent schools.The Library of the University, calledBodleian from Tommaso Bodley the founder,is not fine on account of its structure but forthe quantity and value of the books and Ma- nuscripts. The collection of A rundel marblesis singular, especially for that sculpturedshortly after the battle of Marathon. Thereis also a numerous collection of Statues,busts and other antique things, but allpretty bad.The Amphitheatre is divided inside intothree loggie (tiers) each with its own gradini.There debates are held, and the public actscalled Comitia and Enegria are read. TheArchitect of this Edifice was the Sig. Cri- stoforo Wren. In the ceiling they havewished to imitate the cord upon which theancients extended the velarium.The new Library called fromthe name of its Founder is a considerablebuilding and of good design. The rusticbase is a double octagon, and the upperOrder is a perfect cylinder decorated withtwin Corinthian columns, sopraomato andbalustrade. All is crowned by a cupolawhich rests upon a drum. The inner designis less happy than the outer and the booksare not yet set in place. The Architect wasa certain Gibbs.The greater number of the Colleges areof Gothic Architecture, some because builtin the time when that style reigned, andothers expressly so built although constructedin the last century. Generally the Englishlove the Gothic, which is perhaps the causeof the dryness and poorness of their Works;and then too they believe that it is suited tobuildings serving for Religion and Study....The new Observatory is a building of muchmerit. AFTER this Seha visits Blenheim, ColebrookDale, Chester, Liverpool, Manchester,Chatsworth, Darby on Crumpet, and otherplaces in England. And then, after stayingfor a time in Paris, returns to Italy and tenyears later begins the building of theLa Fenice. (I) Presumably Lord Chatham.

THE THEATRE IN BUDRIO. BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE TOWN OF BUDRIO. Plate 13. 13 EADERS of "The Mask'* will have heard of a performance gi- "*■ ven in the town of Budrio reported as far back as 1923 in theTealrino of the Palazzo Lazzone (1), a modern performance.I have nothing to do with the modernity of Budrio here — Imerely bring to light for the first time in any journal the existenceof the town itself and its twenty-two streets and its two theatres.The average two in twenty-two is not bad for a bit of a townin the first quarter of the 18th century.On the plan the theatres are marked 9 and I 5. No. 9 is Tea- tro Sgargi ; N. 1 3 is Teatto Medosi.There was (it appears) also a " Teatre da Commedie " built byGiambattista Fracassari for the " comodo della Gioventu di Budrio ;this theatre is not marked on the birdseye view, but I believe itto be the same as No. 15.These two Theatres are referred to by Golinelli (1720) as duevaghi Teatri * and of Teatro Sgarbi he writes. 4 Paolo Jogarbi...built in his house and entirely at his own expense a vast leatro",In Budrio was an Accademia degli Affidati.Here in 1788 was born Francesco Cocchi a celebrated scenogra- pher who travelled as far as St Petersberg and Lisbon, Berlin andHamburg and died in 1865. Giuseppe Gotti is another scenographerborn in Budrio, in 1726.The population in 1907 was 2.400 persons, but at the timethe birdseye view was drawn there were 5000 ; but that includedthose who dwelt in the commune as well as in the town.Today there is a Teatro Consorziale, but 1 have no notionwhether it be one of the tv/o theatres of the 18th century restored,rebuilt and ruined or a bran new affairs. But I am going to findout next month. A. C. (1) See 44 The Mask " Volume IX pg. 43. COSTUME VERSUSCLOTHES BY HILAIRE HILER. MAN CONSIDERED ARCHITECTURALLY \Y/ HEN I was about six, 1 was the proud* * owner of a policeman suit. It had acardboard helmet of the form then correspon- ding to the regulation ones used by the force,a breast-plate covered with blue cloth whichwas embellished with a badge and brassbuttons, a whistle, and a club. Donningthis outfit, not without the aid of my mother,I would mount my trusty tricycle and proudlypedal about in imitation of the bicycle copwho frequently passed our door.One day my diminutive club becameentangled in the front wheel of the tricyclewhile I was chasing imaginary robbers at areckless pace. It brought my machine to toosudden a stop and I went over onto theasphalt, head first. Tears were wiped offmy insignia with some sympathy and anattempt made to repair the larger dents inthe helmet, but the morale of the tricyclepersonnel had been injured beyond repair.1 never resumed my constabulary activities.At seven or so, I was an Indian, anuncle having presented me with a suit ofbrown twill fringed with red; but havinglost a part of the headdress which went withthis, in slipping out of an apple tree whichwas being ascended for purposes of longrange scouting, I obtained a wide brimmedhat several sizes too large for me in placeof it, and for a considerable period becamealmost simultaneously a desperate outlawand brave sheriff — being thus somewhatinconveniently forced several times to chasemyself around an adjacent lot.Later we had a theatre in the barn, andtable cloths, feather dusters, old clothing of all sorts, curtain rings (used for earrings),corks (for " blacking up"), pot and kettlecovers (for shields), and other materials ofdivers nature, would disappear from the houseto find their way to the hayloft which servedas a dressing room every time we gave a play.Sometimes there were masquerade balls.There was Halloween — and when excuseswere not there ready-made, I would findone. Always eager to " dress up ", I seldomhad much trouble in persuading my littleplaymates to do likewise. When, later on,an opportunity offered itself in " real " schooland college theatricals, I always liked tohelp design and make the necessary costumes.In short — as long as I can remember, Ihave had a lively interest in costume.In art school I started patiently to tracethe hundreds of figures in the two volumework of Hottenroth, being at the time unableto afford a copy, and in day dreams wouldgo back into different historic epochs andlook admiringly at the dress of the people ofthese periods as they appeared (more or lessaccurately) in my fancy.Some ten years ago, going to Europe, Ibought books and plates concerning costumewherever I found them. They were scarce,Proud when I had some fifty volumes, I feltmy collection nearing completion at fivehundred, and gave up all idea of completingit when owner of twelve hundred books andbetween six and ten thousand plates.I wrote a book on prehistoric, primitiveand barbaric costume and ornament, andwhile doing so collected a bibliography oncostume, dress, clothing, adornment andapparel — including over ten thousand booksprinted in fifteen different languages, aboutman's bodily covering. It was then apparentthat I was not the only person nor the firstperson to have been interested in " dressing»» «up ! CLOTHING VERSUS COSTUME. |f]T " Dressing up" implies a dressing inTU a style distinct from that worn habitually.One is costumed rather than merely clothed.Between the terms clothing and costume thereis a great distinction. Clothing is bodilycovering; costume, raiment.To elucidate. Let's assume that we havea nice clean blank white page. Drawing a line down the centre, it is divided into twoequal parts. The half on the left will haveprinted at the top the word MATERIAL;on the right the word MENTAL willappear.Under the word Material, we will writethe terms Apparel, Clothing and Dress;under the word Mental, the terms Costume,Adornment and Body Ornament. Thus ifwe were making a study of the subject wemight continue to write in the rest of theleft-hand side such phrases as " Environmentmakes clothing necessary ". " Climate fur- nishing in flora and fauna sufficient to providematerials for the fabrication of garments toprotect man from its own temperatures".Economic side of clothing ". " Physiologyof clothing ". " Technique of manufacturefrom felting to tanning". "Bodily comfort;physical health ".Then we might cross the line and arriveon the Mental side where we would seesuch terms as Sex, Religion, Magic, Totem,Trophyism, Taboo, Ego, Aesthetics, Prestige,Imitation, et cetera, all tied up with thesubject of clothes.Clothes are economically, of course, ofprimary importance. Food, Clothing andShelter are the three economic " goods "needed, in the order named..Man is born naked but dies and is putaway with clothes on. Clothes have a prac- tical material hygienic side of great scientificimportance. Nothing warmer than fur, ouncelor ounce, has ever been discovered. Woolis warmer than silk, silk than cotton, andcotton than linen. Dr. Dearborn, of theU. S. Army Medical Corps says that thecomfort, or lack of it, in clothing meansimmeasurable loss or gain in the efficiencyof people in all sorts of jobs. Measured interms of money, collectively estimated, it:makes the head swim.But luckily this is not the side of the- subject we are studying. I started out totalk about " dressing up The term hasan oddly theatrical implication. PUTZ. THOMAS CARLYLE had his studious cha- racter Diogenes Teufelsdrockh take a»look into this business a long while ago. In.his book Sartor Resartus, Herr Teufelsdrockh rather long-windedly came to the conclusionthat barbarous man spiritually craved deco- ration while he showed considerable indiffe- rence about the warmth and protective qualitiesof his clothes. He was strong on the aestheticside, and craved that touch of ne sais quoiof necessary decoration (Putz). It was hintedthat man, as Diogenes T. states, changedfrom a " naked animal " to a clothed animalfor some obscure artistic reason.1 think that man took to costume beforehe took to clothing ; he " dressed up " beforehe clothed himself. Carlyle's Heir was rightwhen he said or hinted that ornament, notcovering, was the preoccupation of the " hairysavage ".There is much evidence that the savage,hard-boiled concerning the vagaries of tempe- rature, showed downright indifference abouthis clothing. The ancient Chinese and theold Greek commentators thought that clothingwas adopted for warmth, but this is not amodern scientific view of the matter.An early traveller describes a Mangaiislander as " being clothed v/ith a huntingknife which was stuck through the lobe ofhis ear ". Darwin speaks of giving a good- sized piece of red cloth to a Fuegian who,although " he certainly stood in need of pro- tective clothing " tore it up and distributedit among his companions who used it deco- ratively.African Safari porters wear all the oddsand ends of clothing they can get hold ofin the heat of the day, and throw them offin the cool of the evening when camp isreached. The evidence all over the primitiveworld, with few exceptions, seems to showthat clothing plays a secondary role to costume.Decoration first, protection afterward. Man'sorigin in the tropics does not point to anadaptation of clothing for economic reasons.The primitives do not " wear clothes .They " dress up ". THE PSYCHOLOGY OF "DRESSING UP". THE assumption of the dressing up procli- vity puts by the board theories such asthat held by Ratzel and the older school ofethnologists, that clothing was forced uponwomen by their lords and masters as a meansof diminishing the force of their charms. Italso does not agree with the Mosaic assumption explained naively by St. Augustine in con- nection with the apple-eating act — thatmodesty is at the bottom of dress. RobertBurton in his somewhat sour " Anatomy ofMelancholy ", Dumaurier, Stendhal, Remy deGourmont, Westermarck, Havelock Ellis andmany others deny this possibility emphatically.Modesty came after clothing. Ornamentpreceded clothing and was worn to attractand not to hide. Salomon Reinach deniesthis possibility, favouring the explanation ofa blood taboo as reason for the origin ofdress ; but it is simpler and just as probableto accept, at least in part, the more intriguingtheory that men and woman started " dressingup " to make themselves mutually attractive.The behavior of many savages supports suchan assumption, for more than one peopleamong whom nudity is the habitual state,don body ornaments and garments whenabout to engage in licentious ceremonies orlewd dances. They do, in fact, " dress up "for every sort of ceremony.Ceremonial and dressing up scent of thetheatre in embryo. Frazer, who gives suchan excellent idea of these activities in theGolden Bough, hints that magic may havesomething to do with it. Tree sprites, beingpresent in the tree and in its bark, are presentin bark clothing. Clothing is again pictures- quely connected with the worship of theserpent, which was the only animal whichcould change its dress — and therefore itspersonality. Elliot Smith, whose theorieshave somewhat lately romantically revolutio- nized ethnology, claims that costume originatedthrough the wearing of amulets of sexualpower, near the appropriate spot. Crawley,differing with him, yet agrees — in hisMystic Rose.Perhaps a hunter carrying his trophyproudly thought of hanging it about his neck,or more conveniently, wearing its skin.Shining ornaments may have been wornbecause of a purely aesthetic attraction whichsuch objects seem to have exerted uponcreatures as diversified as jackdaws, monkeys,Australian bower birds and Park Avenuedowagers.Anyway — our material, physical side ofthe affair seems, at first at least, to have hadvery little to do with " dressing up ". It ison the mental side of our paper that we findall our terms, now somewhat explained, which have to do with costume as opposed toclothing. Raiment as opposed to mere Ap- parel ; Adornment, as opposed to Dress." Dressing up " then, is the whole artisticside of clothing, the psychological side in itspurest connotation — Sexually Attractive, Ma- gico-Religious, Prestige imitational, Ego-Lotzean-stimulating, Aesthetic, Architectural,War, Theatrical, Ceremonial, Caste-marking,Armorial, T otem-influencing, TrophyisticalDressing Up. COSTUME DEVELOPING. IF people are assumed as having begun todress with ornament: the girdle grewinto kilt, skirt and trousers; the necklace intocape, robe, cloak and coat. Around thediadem or head-band, feathers sprang up,flaps hung down. Bracelets, rings, anklets,earrings, labrets, garters and armlets prettywell complete the list of ornaments fromwhich clothing stemmed, because theyexhaust the places where ornaments could beconveniently worn.The architecture of the human body, asSemper remarks, forms the architecture ofcostume.Two pendantiy pendicular ornamentalearrings, one on each side. A nodding plumeor floating feather leaning backward toaccentuate its wearer's movement forward.Corresponding with the axes of the humanbody, as explained in the illustrations.Costume, following the paths of the otherarts, becomes architectural. It reacts mu- tually with the human body. CLOTHES AND CASTE. CLOTHES artistically satisfying, were insur-ficient. Norman Douglas, in his SirenBook, recalls Lotze's observations on the mannerin v/hich man enlarged his personality, extendingit by a huge headdress and a walking stick.Happy coincidence that economically theheaddress and walking stick could so uiifittheir wearer to perform anything in the natureof productive labour.Veblen shows that the " canon of wastedeffort", when it lent value to the chief'scloak, which was made of the difficultlycollected feathers of the what-you-may-call-itPacificus, lent value to the chief. A leisured man was he, with the leisure of others at hisdisposal. The rich one then hung his richesround his neck. A mighty man's riches weretoo mighty to do this? Well then, othernecks were provided — wives, concubines andservants each did their share in aiding thedisplay.If one was " dressed up " — that is tosay, dressed up from every point of view —then one was aesthetically satisfying, thenatural aesthetic assets being properly stressed;therefore, sexually attractive, with a maximumexpansion of the ego in all directions ; magi- cally protected by the proper amulets, withmetamorphasized trophies visible somewhereabout one's person (having taken on the de- sirable qualities of brightness and shinyness);economically conspicuous because of the abilityto wear rare and therefore valuable materials;fearless, because protected from demons, pos- sible accusation of poverty, insignificance, ornonconformity; en regie, provided with theproper papers for one's class and epoch,pointing always toward the appropriate ideal. CHANGES THROUGH THE AGES. f" ca change, pluschose. "All those things which so elusivelythrough the ages went to make up that inde- finable thing called taste. Reflected there,and everywhere. The tightly corseted figuresof the anatomically dressed Aegeans. Thebeautiful gravitational folds of the Greek robes.Architectural forms repeated on.... or fromhumanity, as pointed out by Viollet, le Due,Webb and Heard. The Assyrian mitre andthe Assyrian Juggenaut. Hat ends and roofends bending upward in China. The roundlybulging mosque dome and the roundly bulgingturban. Gothic steeples and steepled hennins.The flat Tudor arch, silhouette and shoe.An old print showing factory chimneys, andan old locomotive puffing wood smoke througha black stove pipe as it pulls a train ofbewhiskered passengers in " stove pipe "hats. The melon shaped dome of thePalais in front of which men stand on theroof to be photographed in chapeaux melons.But it seems to me lately that men atleast (and they have until yesterday, with oneexception, set the styles) are becoming moreclothed and less and less " dressed up ".Does this point to a return to the uniformity of savagery, as Havelock Ellis sometimesseems to fear ? Man's choice of clothingappears to be getting instinctively selbverst- andlich.There is seemingly little hope offered bya future in a civilization dominated by ma- chinery.Trotter's rationalization of the belief inthe herd idea is here appropriate. It servesto justify the assumption of herd suggestion,which is so rapidly taking on a universalforce and scope. " This mechanism ", hesays, " enables the English lady who, to" escape the stigma of having normal feet," subjects them to a formidable degree of" lateral compression, to be aware of no" log inconsequence when she subscribes" to missions to teach the Chinese lady how" absurd it is to compress her feet longitudi- " nally ; it enables the European lady who" wears rings in her ears, to smile at the" barbarism of the colored lady who wears" rings in her nose; it enables the Englishman" who is amused by the African chieftain's" regard for the top hat as an essential pieceof the furniture of state to ignore theidentity of his own behavior when he"to church beneath the same tremendous" ensign ".But the tendency is toward a devolutionfrom costume toward clothing. The " tre- mendous ensign" itself is becoming old- fashioned. Ever there is less of the realcostume psychology in clothes. " Dressing ",as a conventional art, is dead or dying.Costume is too close to dancing, music,poetry and ceremonial to occupy a place ina world given over more and more exclusivelyto mass production. It must give way toclothing, and that quickly. The headgear(the' last article of costume to be given upis the hat) is made to disappear when notsacrificed, as it usually is without a struggle.Turkey and Persia lately have suppressedthe national top piece by stern sumptuaryedict. The " Whisker Rebellion " inAfghanistan still threatens, echoes. Verlaine'sdire prophecy of the time " when madmenwalk the streets all clothed in black" isbeing everywhere fulfilled.The effect of unaesthetic clothing uponmorale is too well known to need stressing.It is certainly in youth and the virile periodthat the individual is preoccupied with dress. Which of us might not sneakingly enjoy areal costume, if he dared ? — real costume,which is now confined to the theatre.May the theatre keep the spark of sug- gestion alive until some more leisured agewhen the play spirit reawakens, and we mayall again " dress up " IParis, January 1929. DRURY LANE MEDITATIONS UPON WHY THE WEAZELDOES NOT ALWAYS GO POP. Scotson Umbridge. WHEN writing of Drury Lane, of Sir Al-* fred Butt's doings, and of the Theatreas business, I have always had in mind toenquire into and see how the best-managedtheatre — that is to say, Drury Lane (best- managed from the point of view of business)— compares with other businesses.Mr. Gordon Craig has recently writtenan article entitled " Little Business Men inthe Big Theatre," which appeared in " VanityFair " and was reprinted in a German daily.His article had a rather cryptic title, but whatit meant was that the Theaire is bigger thanthose business men who dabble in it; andhe says that there is no great business manwho ever touches the Theatre, except toendow it, for to make money out of it wouldseem ridiculous to a great business man. Itis this point in the Craig article which seemsto me to be uncontrovertible.€$ I have taken a glance — only a glance,by the bye — into the business affairs ofLondon. I wanted to compare Theatr9 asbusiness, with Trade proper as business.I only looked at the reports of two of themost popular houses which occurred to meoff-hand — Selfridges and Lyons. I hadno notion whether these two would prove tobe but paltry business concerns by the sideof Drury Lane. 1 must admit I hadrather a hope that they would do so, andthat after all I should be entirely confounded, and that the grand old Drury Lane, thoughturning out stuff for the public which isunworthy both of Drury Lane and of ourpublic, would at any rate be doing it at aterrific profit, so that at least one thing wouldbe established — that the Theatremake money.tj The figures which are published belowprove that the Theatre cannot make money.Cjj No business man who has respect forhimself as a business man will go into Thea- tre business to make money — for himselfor for shareholders — if only for the one reasonthat it renders the ancient and steady tradi- tions of great business farcical.Enquiry shows that in 1926, Drury Laneis making a profit of £ 49.000, and in thesame year Selfridges a profit of 490.000.In 1927, Drury Lane is making a profit of£ 37.000 odd, and Selfridge is making aprofit of £ 821.000.It amounts to this then; that business andthe Theatre are misfits. It is as though aboy went out with his father's large top haton, and it covered his eyes: and Drury Laneseems to be wandering about in this ridiculousplight and no steps are taken to alter it.This cross between business and art is notonly ridiculous, the result is pitiful. Itcreates as pitiful results as a crossbetween an Arabian steed and a giraffewould do. There is a remedy for it whichis to exterminate the breed, and prevent it infuture; don't go on crossing business and theTheatre. Let us at any rate have the purestrain of the Theatre: though the Theatrecome not into the highest category of creation,let it be good of its fand. Let us be rid ofthis mongrel state of affairs, this under-breedingof an already under-bred species.The following figures may interest you.They have interested and vastly entertained me.THEATRE ROYAL, DRURY LANE, LTD. .(Registered in 1897).Issued Capital, £ 125,000.

They are trying to make moneyout of Shakespeare, down there. I haverecently seen " The Shakespeare Pictorial: amonthly illustrated chronicle of events inShakesoeare land. " I do not know whether£.this Monthly is worthy of Stratford-upon-Avon,in 1929 but it would even do honour to thelocal Brewers Union, if there were such aUnion, and it had its headquarters at Paisleyin Scotland, it bustles Shakespeare alongjust as if he were a jolly old Brewer: itjollies up the actors as though they were alot of melancholy unsuccessful tradesmenwho had to be taught that Shakespeare haddone England a power of good.This also can be said for the journal: onits title-page it advertises the Stratford-on-Avon Hippodrome, and its many attractions.Thus, on May 6th we get " THE GIRLFROM REVUE " and " SOMETHINGALWAYS HAPPENS; " on May 22nd," THE FIFTY FIFTY GIRL; " from May30th to June 1 st, " RED HAIR " and " THENIGHT OF HER LIFE. "€jj This is presumably the leading picture- house of the bard's birthplace.€J Side by side with this announcement,which runs down a column, is another column,saying what is to be done at the ShakespeareMemorial Temporary Theatre — " Much AdoAbout Nothing, " " Macbeth " " TwelfthNight, " and some other plays: but thiscolumn looks just a little stuck-up and foreign by the side of the Stratford-on-Avon Hippodrome advertisement. Thus thatold fashioned Shakespeare, the English one, isworsted in the first round on the first page: andyou heard them playing "Ol man River"on Shakespeare's birthday didn't you, Mr Han- nen Swaffer, while waiting to see the unfurling,of the sixty four flags — colours of all nations.Another thing that possibly tells againstShakespeare (comparing these two columnsof the Hippodrome and the Temporary Thea- tre) is that the Hippodrome oilers its merryentertainment at 1 /6d. to 6d., whereas theShakespeare prices are higher; they are8 6d., and the lowest is 1 /2d. One won- ders who will waste 1 / 2d. — the minimumsum — on Shakespeare, when he couldsee " BABY MINE " on the screen for 6d. ?€j At Stratford too!@ Unless you can sell Shakespeare at alower figure, or at least at the same price asthat for which the Pictures are sold, difficultiesmay soon crop up. Of course a wholesaleattack on the Pictures, since it is Shakespeare'stown, might be successful, if you could getall England to agree that the Pictures wereto be excluded from Stratford-on-Avon."

" — so you get yourquestions and your answers in the samenumber; a sort of crib, so that Jackie maycome down in the morning and explain thathe knows all about Shakespeare without havingany trouble over it. A suspicion is arousedby this publication, which is whether anyoneknows why Shakespeare was born, or whatsort of thing Shakespeare liked.We might have doubts about whether hewould have much pleasure in the kind ofgame being played at Stratford on Avon.There is an excellent page or " StratfordGossip, " some pieces of which are boundto interest Italian readers — for example. " Mr. and. Mrs. T. S. Waldron are at present in Italy. Theywill visit Rome, Florence, and Venice before their return.Miss Blue is visiting Biarritz.When I say this will interest Italy, I mean,naturally, that northern Italy will be disappointedthat Miss Blue isn't visiting Bologna.On the other hand, *' Stratford Gossip "does not merely lay itself out to pleaseforeigners (who presumably can find " TheShakespeare Pictorial " on all the railwaystations between Stratford and Constantinople)— it pokes the home fire all right. Example: —" Congratulations to Canon and Mrs. Melville uponattaining the dignity of grandparentsge. The baby is to bechristened With Jordan water brought home by Captain ManleyJames, V. C. and presented by Miss Ashwin for the occasion.It omits to say what will be done with thewater after the occasion. Another paragraphwill surely interest everyone who has sub- scribed to the Memorial Theatre : —" The annual Tennis Tournament on the Southern Lane courtsWill be held from Tuesday, 23rd July, to Saturday, 27th July,inclusive. That will he a busy Week for Stratford-upon-Avon, asthe Agricultural Show will he in progress at the same timed'How tactful is the writer of this Gossip, innot saying at all brutally that there will berather less time for anyone to get bored byShakespeare thai week — anyhow.A few lapses occur in this excellentjournal — from one of which it will bedifficult for the Editor to extricate it. Thereis a mention of Mr. William Poel: nowwhat has Mr. Poel to do with Shakespeare?On the other hand, there is a charmingportrait of Miss Joyce Bland, " as Opheliain ' Hamlet' " (you are not to confuse therole with the other ' Ophelia' which, aseverybody knows, is in " Caprice"). MissBland has won a scholarship at the RoyalAcademy of Dramatic Art; she has understudiedMiss Tallulah Bankhead at the Globe Theatre,and has played in " The Constant Nymph "on tour. " A graceful figure of sweet inno- cence in the first blush of love" was Mr.George W. Stark's tribute in theNews. It does not say whether Miss Blandis American or English; but the pictureshows her in the well-fitting traditionalcostume, with the traditional expression, andmaking a nice traditional gesture. — Well....poor Ophelia !There is an interesting report of theShakespeare Birthday celebrations, and, thoughit lack the brilliance of Hannen Swaffer's report of the same event, it tells us how ablyevery land in the world has been beaten upto send in its flag. A Birthday Luncheonwas held as usual, and a flashlight photographtaken immediately prior to the Luncheon.It reminds one of those photographs ofCollege Commemoration Day, with all thehappy parents assembled in a miserable sortof way : not a very fortunate photograph.One of strangest omissions from thisShakespeare Pictorial " is that there isnothing in it which informs you about thefamous beer that is brewed at Stratford-on-Avon, and I must say that Shakespeare wouldnot have liked that to be omitted. SubtleShakespeare may have been, but he was alsodownright; and we have heard that the beerthere is so much improved since the newspring of water was discovered, that it is apity should this world-wide advertisementdrawing attention to Stratford-on-Avon fail atthe same time to draw attention to the beer.We may understand Shakespeare or notas we like, but let there be no possiblechance of misunderstanding about the beer.After all it is the main thing, isn't it?Business should be business. C. BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE PALAIS ROYAL, PARIS. Plate 14. In the right lower corner we see the first Opera Housebuilt in the Palais Royal — though not the first home ofOpera in Paris.It was built by le Mercier and opened in 1641 on Ja- nuary 14 as a theatre for plays.Its position was the corner which today is formed bythe meeting of Rue de Valois with the Rue Saint-Honore.Constructed for Cardinal Richelieu when he built the Pa- lais Royal (then called the Palais Cardinal) it was at firsta somewhat small theatre and was only enlarged and mademagnificent during the last years of his life. He was not a fool, this Cardinal, and did not consider two to threethousand ecus over-much to pay for the stage fittings.The carpenters, on receiving the order from the builderfor eight large oak beams for the ceiling of this playhouselaughed on reading the measurements; — each of these beamscost 8000 francs to transport from the royal forests of Moulins.In 1661 it passed into the hands of Moliere, and in 1673out of his hands into those of Lulli who established theOpera there.It was destroyed by fire on April 6th-7th 1763, dying an Opera House though born a Theatre. THE MYTH. William Addicote. WHAT is a myth ? It is, says the OxfordDictionary " A primitive tale, imaginativelydescribing or accounting for natural phenomena,especially by personification " ; it is "a tale ofgods or demi-gods ; an old wives' tale " ; it isa prevalent but false belief " ; it is "a personor thing falsely supposed to exist'', and the mythShakespeare is most of all this.Shakespeare is one of the most interesting,yet baffling, enigmas of history ", writes SirDunbar Plunket Barton ; and adds that " Hismyriad-minded soul has mysterious recesses whichwe can never fathom ".Brushing aside all doubt as to whether itwould be wise ever to attempt to fathom a recess,one is forced to admit that Shakespeare bafflesall those writers who will write books about thatpart of him which is mythical -— and to my mind,utterly uninteresting. The only thing that I findin the very least interesting about the being wecall Shakespeare, is, that he wrote plays andpoems. The only thing with which I think Englishpeople should concern themselves, is to see thatthese plays and poems are as correctly printed aspossible, and that they are continually played.It is to the credit of England that much time* and money is given to the printing of Shake- speare's works : it is to the discredit of Englandthat practically nothing is done towards the per- forming of his plays. As for the time, money,intelligence, energy, and everything else, that isspent on bringing out new books on this myth —what can be said of that?For my part, I do not doubt that Sir Dunbar Plunket Barton's notes, linking Shakespeare upwith the law, are full of truthful statements: butI simply cannot believe any of them, because theman is a myth, and because until his plays arehonoured by perfect performance, we renderourselves foolish in writing books about him —and we render him no service in doing so.I much prefer a volume, such as that by Mr.Charles Williams, published by the OxfordPress — a play which brings Ben Jonson, Burbage,Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Shakespeare, Sir TobyBelch, and the Clown into the same scene,makes them all sit round the same table at theMermaid Tavern, makes these Shakespeareancharacters run through the things that they sayin the play of "Twelfth Night", and makesJonson, Shakespeare and Burbage butt in after- wards with a few foolish remarks of their own.We know the kind of play, though this isbetter of the kind than such plays are as a rule.But what is it for ?— to what end written ? —no one could act it — would anyone ? why thiseccentric English way of going qn about thismajestic mythical figure, Shakespeare ? Why notdevote the same energy, intelligence, and therest — if you are so fond of Shakespeare —toendeavouring to bring about the performance ofhis plays ?This play of Mr. Williams is prettily printed,but it has the most extraordinary cover, on whichseventy-three heads of Shakespeare (and more handsthan should go with that number of heads) are madeinto a kind of wallpaper — that special kind whichevery poor sick man or woman knows all about.It is a sort of mesmeric cover — you keep oncomparing the left eye of the fifth head with theleft eye of the fifty-ninth — these two comingupon the back portion of the cover, that portionwhich looks at you when the book is in its shelf.The two eyes are not quite alike — there issomething a little different about them. And thereis also this about the top figure — it has notgot a pen, whereas the three figures underneathit all have got pens; but one of them has thetips of his fingers off. I mean, it's beautifullyvaried, this effect of seventy-three Shakespeares.There's one of the Shakespeares I have found thathas its little finger curled up — no, I have foundtwo of them — three of them. It should prove oneof the games of the season. I have foundanother one with the little finger curled up ; sothat makes four. Has anybody found any more ?There is a French book on Shakespeare, byM. Constantin-Weyer. He does not figure as amyth on the cover. He is described there as oneof the " Maxtres des Litteratures ", and bee ideshis being credited with having written " Hamletit is asserted that he had a son called Hamlet(born 1585, died 1596). Yes, I have not madea mistake, it is written clearly, " H-A-M-L-E-T " — I may not know what I am talking about,but I know what 1 see. And I see a very excellentnumber of plates in collotype at the end of thislittle volume — sixty such. They show views ofStratford, views of the Myth's house, the chamberin which the Myth was born, the grammar-schoolwhere he never studied, the house of AnneHathaway, with the mythical bed mentioned inthe Myth's will, a portrait of the Earl ofSouthampton (a mere glance at whose face causesyou to murmur "The plot thickens") — andthen the catastrophe four portraits of the Mythitself, no more Shakespeare, any one of them,than my hat.The delightful way in which the book iswritten, the excellent way in which it is broughtout, the charming way in which we shall allread it, and linger on phrases such as " Sir TobyBelch est une voix distante de Falstaff", isnothing to the conviction that we should closeall these books, convinced of the terrible — thefarcical — distance of Shakespeare himself.And yet, why terrible and why so funny ?The mere wasting of what the wrong people havecalled '' the divine creations of a poet " — is itnot quite ordinary ? and wouldn't it be still betterif poetry were suppressed once and for all ?Couldn't something be done in the matter —practically done by practical people ? 1 know whatit is to keep all the scraps that come into the house,all the prospectuses, all the press-cuttings, all thejournals : I have got a barn full of them, and soonthey will go into sacks and be boiled down andmade into pulp from which plates or trouserswill be made. Could not the fine poems thatwill be written in the next hundred years beprevented twice as easily, and at one-fiftieth thecost if the poets are allowed to live, write, beprinted, and, for all we know, become myths ?1 don't like being too optimistic, or 1 should saythat in this enlightened age this will not be merelya possibility but that in a few years, it willactually be done.It is an awful thing to think that the GranvilleBarkers and the W. J. Lawrences of the years tocome will bring out their books about some verygreat author of to-morrow, and that these bookswill be as delightfully written as are Mr. Law- rence's " Shakespeare's Workshop " and Mr.Barker's " Prefaces to Shakespeare ". Mr.Barker comically promises us that this is onlythe '' first series ''. He only prefaces three ofthe plays. He does it so charmingly, so reason- ably, in such a scholarly manner that it is heart- breaking. For it is quite useless."We need not claim for him (Shakespeare)impeccability as a playwright'', says Mr. Barker;and he really might have added " But he's top- notch as a myth In other passages Mr. Barkeris not so happy ; for example : " This last scene of Lear's madness may be redundant, then, tothe strict action of the play, but to its largerissues it is most germane " . And like unfortunatetouches are to be found on many pages : thistaking the thing to be reality is what is sounhappy. For is there a last scene of Lear'smadness ? I begin not to believe it. There wasa scene which I once read, I believe in a dream,— so terrible and so wonderful that had it beena reality, no nation with any sense of football,any appreciation of Test Matches, could possiblyhave passed it over. A nation seriously inclinedlike that would have brought such a scene to theattention of the many millions of men — damn se- rious, fine men, too — who light their pipes sooften, as they sit watching the game —in adrizzle, may be — and thinking about all sorts offine things. No, no, it really is a myth, the wholething. The man never existed and the playsnever existed : no nation could possibly possesssuch plays, and be such great and such blitheringfools as not to play them before the millions to whom they belong.

Constantin-WeyerLes Editions Rieder, 18 fr.). NO MYTH William Addicote IT is so pleasant to realise that /Eschylus wasno myth, and that his nation honoured him.This is not the least part of the happiness whichcomes to you on opening any translation of theAgamemnon.Five such translations are open on the tableas I write, and this version by Sir Henry Sharp,the fifth of my five, has many of the good thingsof the others. The first page, with its wonderfulscene of the watchman couched on the Atridae'shouse-top, like a dog, is enough for me to speakof: I-should need a whole year, or longer, tocompare these five translations, to swim in sucha sea — one page enough for me.One of the translations I am looking at is byLewis Campbell (1890), and although GilbertMurray's (1920) is good, and the Headlams'version (1909) is good, and good the versionby Morshead, (1911) I never can like any ofthem better than Campbell's. - It is interesting to note that of the whole five,only Murray misses the word "dog"; ("likea _ dog " dog-like " watch-dog "), andmisses, too, " head on arms ", " with head onhand ", " propped on one arm ''. Murraygives us —44 watching elbow-stayed,As sleuthhounds watch, above the Atreidae's hall **,44 while couched upon the Atreidae's roof dogfashion on my arms'says Headlam.** Propped on one arm, upon the palace-roofOf Atreus* race",says Morshead. And Campbell —4 Couched on the Airidae's house-top, like a dog,With head on hand, and ever-wakeful eye ",Sir Henry Sharp's line runs —44 Upon the Atreidae's roof, where, head on arms,Dog-like, I learn — " etc.While I like much in Sir Henry Sharp'stranslation, I do not like his stage directions atall. Of the translators I have mentioned, onlyGilbert Murray and Sir Henry indulge in thesedirections. If /Eschylus has not clearly drawnthe scene, described the position of the solitarywatchman in the scene, given his gestures, hisface, and — though I cannot read Greek, I'dswear to it — even given us each tone of hisvoice, then /Eschylus too is in danger of becom- ing a myth.Now how does Sir Henry Sharp describe thisfirst scene ? —" The scene shows the front of the palace of Agamemnon at Argus,Before the palace are ranged altars and images of the Gods. Onthe roof stands the Watchman. It is night ".How does Gilbert Murray describe it ? —44 The Scene represents a space in front of the Palace of Aga- memnon in Argos, with an Altar of Zeus in the centre and manyother altars at the sides. On a high terrace of the roof stands aWatchman. It is night ".Now both of these descriptions of the sceneand the Watchman are either too much or shouldbe fifty times more — which Heaven forbid. Tobegin with, why omit to say that it is winter,and that it is the season of storm? Why saythe Watchman is standing, when he is " couchedlike a dog, head on arms " ? A dog doesn'tstand up on his hind legs with his chin on hispaws, except he be badly bred, and asking forsomething from the table — perhaps /Eschylusmeant that.And why does Murray say that there aremany other altars besides the chief altar, withoutsaying how many : it might lead Mr. Bel Geddesto put a hundred there, and then there would bea scandal at once and Mr. Ivor Brown wouldbe furious. And if there are images of the Gods, according to Sir Henry Sharp, why is itthat according to Sir Gilbert Murray there areno images of the Gods ?The fact is that Sir Gilbert and Sir Henryare too clever. Presumably their intention is tohelp a perishing people : but if the words of/Eschylus, even in translation, do not fan ourvision, the blandest explanation in the world willnot fire it.The next stage direction comes 22 linesfurther on in one version, and 21 in the other :both have reached the same spot, yet one of themhas taken longer to do it. But when they arriveat the spot, they go running around it like micedo at night , in between the ceiling and the floorabove, in summer, when the storm is over.Sir Gilbert writes: " " (that is, theWatchman) " is silent, watching. Suddenly, ata distance in the night there is a glimmer offire, increasing presently to a blaze ".On the other hand, Sir Henry says that theWatchman '' Composes himself for sleep ",which is in flat contradiction, by the bye, toSir Gilbert, who assures us not only that heis silent, but that he is watching. Then SirHenry comes out hot and strong, or rather,delicate and mysterious, as a stage-manager, andsays —"Faint music is heard, heralding the approach of the Chorus.As the music grows clearer a red flame shoots up in the hack-ground.The Watchman moves uneasily, then starts to his feet and gazesat the flame ".I have known stage-managers and producers,and will not, in my pride at the fact, put onany airs with Sir Gilbert or Sir Henry. It mustbe exceedingly difficult to translate so beautifullyas either of them does. Yet not one of themdoes it like my old friend Campbell — old friendin the bookish sense. But if difficult to translateit is obviously far too easy for these fine scholarswhen it comes to writing stage directions. Theintention is very good indeed, and their intentionis to be abreast of the times. Unfortunately,these stage directions are about sixty years behindthe times and belong to the age of Charles Kean.The two tasks, directing a stage and transla- ting a play, are over much for one man — thoughI think that the translating is the easier of thetwo, because the translator has the words of /Es- chylus to translate from. He has rather less to helphim when he wishes to explain what is being done,and how it is being done.Sir Henry is really somewhat curious in sayingthat " faint music is heard " — especiallysince Sir Gilbert has said no such thing. SirGilbert has said that there is "a glimmer offire, increasing presently... " etc. — nothing aboutfaint music. Sir Gilbert says that the fire is" at a distance '' and '' in the night ". — whydoesn't Sir Henry tell us that it's in the night, and at a distance ? No, Sir Henry rather fanciesmusic at a distance — sort of coming in gradually,effectively, mysteriously. There are signs, infact, that Sir Henry is getting rather bitten bythe stage-management of the Agamennon ; and ifhe doesn't take care, before he comes to an endhe will be becoming positively expressionistic.I just turn over rapidly, to have a glance, and Isee that he is very fond of these distance ef- fects — for later on, " A sound of distant shout- ing, mingled with music, gradually approaches ".But to return to the first scene ; why he shouldsay that " a red flame shoots up in the back- ground and cause the Watchman to turn hisback on us and gaze at the flame (for he saysthis is what he does) — well, I don't know thatthis isn't going too far: I don't like to say it,but I feel that it is almost taking liberties withthe author. An author taking liberties with theauthor ! !It is quite true that the Watchman immediatelysays, M Hail, day-star of the night ". — and ofcourse, the imagination of everyone will instantlyturn to the thought of a good red star : " Thered light signifies danger, the green light safety— but I needn't bore you with that story, thoughI am not so sure that I wouldn't have put alittle yellow light somehow ; for then they wouldhave known that the show was on fire.And indeed, this great Agamemnon is on firefrom the very start — what a fire ! I must giveyou the first lines, they are so full ; —I ask the gods deliverance from the toilOf these long watchings. Through twelve weary moonsCouched on the Atridae's housetop, like a dog,With head on hand, and ever-wakeful eye,[ have conned the nightly concourse of the starsThat shine majestical in yon clear heavenAnd bv their risings and their settings bringSummer and winter to the world.Who is there, even if Shakespeare is awash-out, who can resist buying this half-crownbook, in which is the world, and the seven seas,and all the constellations — and more.

POOR old Nollekins — Nollekins and hisDinah — he who had the misfortune tohave Mr. John Thomas Smith as pupil, poorold Nollekins. The name is that of a Punchand Judy showman — a name born for thatjob. My poor old Nollekins, you were cursedto become a sculptor! a sculptor!! and yourPunch's heads and Hangman's hands wouldhave been such bonny bits of carving — yourold voice issuing from behind the curtain of your show would have amazed even thevery ordinary faculties of John Thomas Smith,had a momentary recollection of dignity al- lowed the said Smith to stop before yourbooth.But you became a sculptor and had thedeuced hard luck to be misinterpreted byJ. T. Smith.Was he a good sculptor,(,) this Mr. JosephNollekins? Goodness knows : his work hasnever been pointed out to me — I have, tomy knowledge seen none of it. His life boresme, for Mr. Smith is a bore in the way hepresents it to us. I never come to know Mr.Nollekins — his pupil prevents this — he isfor ever putting things badly and so we getbut a portrait of Smith.I think one has always known Smith —who without sneering teaches us to sneer.This little cockney born in a hackney coachon July 23 1766 is a forerunner, one of thepioneers of the talkies. His voice is commonand what he says is not carefully considered.He tells of the London twixt 1737 and 1823and some interesting people come into therecital, and a few of these are actors and itfollows that the book will have an interest forthe readers of " The Mask ".But I doubt Smith's veracity; — his talkabout Mrs Nollekins' meanness — his chatterabout the Venuses, and' so I doubt if any- thing he reports about the stage is to berelied on.Mr. Nollekins became very rich later inlife, and, dying, left Smith £ 100 — Smithhad hoped for more. Personally I consider£ 100 was £ 95 too muck THE SECOND. T\ HIS nobody was anyhow more than Smithwho was not even a nobody: he was anyhowLord Chesterfield's son.This nice dull fellow of course never readany of the letters of advice that arrived forhim week by week; had he done so he wouldhave possibly benefited — possibly gone mad.Yet his father wrote sense about most things- even about the Theatre, a thing few peoplein his position can bother to do.The publish ers of this series as usual have made it almost faultless — no one cares tohave an obvious fault pointed out, but to haveit pointed out over and over again must bea joy,The design on the back of the cover isthe fault I have touched on at times.Antimacassars can be lovely things, thougha bit out of date — ill - designed antima- cassars are the limit; the design on the backof the World's Classics is like an ill-designedantimacassar.But to return to Lord Chesterfield.This is good sense:" I could wish there were a treaty made" between the French and the English" ires, in which both parties should make con- " siderable concessions. The English ought"to give up their notorious violations of all" the unities', and all their massacres, racks," dead bodies, and mangled carcases, which" they so frequently exhibit upon their stage." The French should engage to have more" action and less declamation; and not to cramand crowd things together, to almost a de- " gree of impossibility, from a too scrupulous" adherence to the unities..." And this is positive understanding: —" Tragedy must be something bigger thanlife, or it would not affect us. In nature" the most violent passions are silent: in" gedy they must speak, and speak With"dignity too ".... and so on."It is quite otherwise with Comedy, which" should be mere common life, and not one jot"bigger. Every character should speak upon" the stage, not only what it would utter in" the situation there represented, but in the" same manner in which it would express it..."There is something not quite right in thesewords about Comedy; taken too literally hisblithe remarks on Comedy would mislead us."As for Operas, "he goes on, " they are' essentially too absurd and extravagant to'mention: I look upon them as a magic scene," contrived to please the eyes and the ears,' at the expense of the understanding; and I con- " sider singing, rhyming, and chiming heroes, and" princesses, and philosophers, as Ido the hills," the trees, the birds, and the beasts, who ami- 'cably joined in one common country dance,"to the irresistible tune of Orpheus's lyre.Whenever I go to an Opera, I leave my" sense and reason at the door with my " guinea, and deliver myself up to my eyes" and my ears."My Lord Chesterfield even in his insipi- dity does not often fluster, but here he doesfluster.He reveals a chirk—those of us who knowwhat Opera was in Italy in the 17th and 18thcenturies, know what purpose it ser ved and howfrom Monteverdi to Malipiero the musicianshave been anything but absurd, and the de- corators from Torelli to Bakst just as grave ;the singers and dancers must not have it alltheir own way.Just because the singers and dancers ofChesterfield's day were trivial (and all of themwere not that), the danseuseandtoo amiable, Lord Chesterfield need not growagitated and commit himself to stupidities.Opera is an immense and very seriousbranch of Theatrical art. The tree has buttwo branches — Prose and Lyric — andthis Opera is the first off-shoot from the branchwe call the Lyric Theatre.Lord Chesterfield adores the extravaganceof Ariosto, and Ariosto is the very godfatherof Opera.Well then —But after all I prefer the faulty Chester- field, parodied so fatally by Dickens in" BarnabyRudge", to the more perfect nobody his son.Lord Chesterfield and Nollekins seem notto have noted one another — but a certainSelva, an Italian architect travelling in Londonin 1780, does mention Nollekins. Once.He writes in his day book: " Sig. Nelechinmediocre scultore" — but then Nelechin doesen't mention Selva at all. 1. Nollekins and his Times by J. T. Smith.2. Lord Chesterfield s Letters.

[HO knows anything about the Teatro Granari of Roma?* It was known to Nolli the cartographer, who marksit clearly on his plan by the number 618. That was in 1748.Near by is the Teatro Pace, no. 611 of the plan. This alsois a theatre not universally well-known, but compared withthe Granari it is a notorious theatre.A thousand selected books will hardly yield a referenceto the Teatro Granari of the Vicolo De' Granari. Yet herein 174.8 was perfomed the intermezzo " II bravo e il bello "written by Rinaldo di Capua. So much we will say to helpany student.Indeed, we point to this little playhouse because here isa historical corner so obscure that any theatre magazine withcapital to back it might feel impelled to do some work andspend some time discovering all about it. If they fail " The Mask " will solve the difficulty. WANTED - A PRODUCER.STAGING THE GILBERT-SULLIVANCOMIC OPERAS BY JOHN FURSE FOREIGN visitors to Britain interested in the theatre havea thin time of it. If they want, for instance, tosee Shakespeare done in English, as they naturally oftendo, one can but send them to the Old Vic. — and really,that's rather hard on someone who is used to the artisticamenities of a German capital. Not so long ago, asked bya German to recommend a show to him, I rashly sent himto the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's production of" The Gondoliers ", the best show I'd seen for a monthor two. A few days later he told me about it; "Soquaint ", he said, " so Victorian Now the Gilbert-Sullivan operas have a unique impor- tance in Britain. Not only are they performed by theD'Oyly Carte Company at more or less regular intervalsin London, but they are toured throughout ihe whole ofBritain, and there is not a town of any note in the countrywhere every year or two the local theatre isn't packed to thedoors for a week or more while the operas are being done.The productions are among the most popular on theBritish stage; they are among the best; and they are" so quaint, so Victorian "." The Mikado" was re-dressed a year or two agoand new sets designed for it. Mr Charles Ricketts, R. A.,everyone admitted, improved considerably on the work ofthe previous person responsible for the wcrk. But stillthe production of " The Mikado "as a whole is morethan a trifle distressing. (One daren't say that in anEnglish paper, of course: the Gilbert-Sullivan-D'OylyCarte idolaters number millions, and are unrelenting.Mr Henry Lytton acts Ko-Ko with infinite skill; MissBertha Lewis sings Katisha's numbers magnificently ; andthe part of Pooh-Bah never found a better interpreterthan in Mr Leo Sheffield. Without a firstrate producer,however, the ensemble is atrocious. If Mr Ricketts hadbeen a man of the theatre as well as a painter of tasteand learning, he might have actually modernised " TheMikado" to the extent the newspapers said he did.The opera has now new mis-en-scene — otherwise it's still" quaint and Victorian ".When the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company nextappears in London '6 The Gondoliers " will be redressedby Mr Ricketts and " The Pirates of Penzance" byMr George Sheringham Mr Sheringham has also, Iunderstand, done new sets for " Patience ". I can thusforesee numberless articles in praise of the modernisedproductions, and unless I'm vastly mistaken not a singlecritic will rise on his hind legs and, looking at theproductions with fresh eyes, say "No good. This is 1929— and I've seen what Russia can do — and the RussianBallet has been here — and there's a Gordon Craig inItaly". Because there's a widespread belief here insomething called " the tradition", which the D'OylyCarte Company is reputed to uphold.Of course the Beverley Nicholses of dramatic criticismmay believe that a decade or two can establish a tradition.Surely it's patent enough, however, that the D'Oyly CarteCompany is not upholding a tradition but merely perpe- tuating the rather circumscribed views of Sir WilliamGilbert. The new scenery and dresses are a step in theright direction, but only the first of very many essentialsteps towards the satisfactory presentation of the operas.Who is in charge of the D'Oyly Carte productions? I'venever heard of him. I think there is only a stage manager— the English stand-by. It would do the English theatrea world of good were a producer of genuine talent calledin to tackle the presentation of the operas, so vast is theirpublic. It is for the same reason we all hope Sir ThomasBeecham is to take expert advice before staging his operasunder the aegis of the League of Opera. GETTING ON WITH IT. J. S. fUlR. Bel Geddes has been producing a "Hamlet,* inAmerica, the whole piece being arranged so as toplay well within two hours.This has entailed a little judicious condensation of thetext of the play which is one of Shakespeare's longest.It is, by the way, the Shakespeare version that was used.The First Scene, which we reprint here, was cabledacross to us, though we cannot vouch for its being correctto a comma.

The bookfrom which We have taken this piece measures only about 4 1/2 inches;hy 3 inches; the paper on which it is printed is cheap stuff and thetype small and often damaged ; the pages are not numbered. It is an informalbooklet and in the kind of pocket edition anyone could buy and everyonecarried. Whether it cost 3d or 6d is not clear.We understand that books like this cannot be printed today for thereWould not be a sufficient sale at such a price.It was over that wild beaten track a friend of bold Buonaparte,Did pace the sands and lofty rocks of St. Helena's shore,The wind it blew a hurricane, the lightning's Sash around did dart,The sea-gulls were shrieking, and the waves around did roar,Ah ! hush, rude winds, the stranger cried awhile I rove the dreary spot,Where last a gallant hero his envied eyes did close,But whilst his valued limbs do rot, his name will never be forgot,This grand conversation on Napoleon arose.Ah England, he cried, did you persecute that hero bold,Much better had you slain him on the plains of Waterloo;Napoleon he was a friend to heroes all, both young and old,He caus d the money for to fly wherever he did go;When plans were ranging night and day, the bold commander to betray,He cried, I 11 go to Moscow, and then 'twill ease my woes,If fortune shines without delay, tnen all the world shall me obey,This grand conversation on Napoleon arose.Thousands of men he then did rise, to conquer Moscow by surprise,He led his men across the Alps, oppress'd by frost and snow,But being near the Russian land he then began to ope his eyes,For Moscow was a burning, and the men drove to and fro;Napoleon dauntless viewed the flame, and wept in anguish for the same,He cried, retreat my gallant men, for time so wiftly goes,What thousands died on that retreat, some forced their horses for to eatThis grand conversation on Napoleon arose.At his men they fought commanded by great Bonaparte,Attended oy field-marshall Ney, and he was bribed by gold,When Blucher led the Russians in, it nearly broke Napoleon's heart,He cried my thirty thousand men are kill'd and I am sold;He viewe d the plain and cried its lost, he then his favourite charger cross'd,The plain was in confusion with blood and dying woes,The bunch of roses did advance, and boldly entered into France,This grand conversation on Napoleon arose.Then Bonaparte was plann'd to be a prisoner across the sea,The rocks of St. Helena, it was the fatal spot,Doom'd as a prisoner there to be till death did end his misery,His son soon followed to the tomb, it was an awful plot,Long enough have they been dead, the blast of war around is spread,And may our shipping float again to face the daring foes,Now my boys, when honour calls we'll boldly mount the wooden walls,This grand conversation on Napoleon arose.

BOOK REVIEWS. ALEXANDRE DUMAS FILSDRAMA TIST by H. StanleySchwarz. The New York Univer- sity Press. Price $ 4S0Q. DUIMAS FILS was popular for twen- ty-five years or more: Dumas perewas popular for thirty to forty years:Molier6 was popular, Shakespeare too;— but these things belong to the past.Not even one of the seventy mil- lion ants which are busy today, 1929,in my garden can bother to concernitself with that which was once the year1918; so how can the Public be expec- ted to bother its many heads about thepast so long passed by — about 1873,the year in which Dumas gave it 44 LaFemme de ClaudeThe public, like the ants, prefersthis year to any other.Today is June 1st 1929: I am inItaly: it is unpleasantly close — noblue sky and the thunder seems lurkingaround — all dreary and depressing.June 1st of 1918 was in Italy veryhot; the sea was calm and delicious,the sky blue and clear; a cool breezekept the whole day fresh.Yet the Public of 1929 prefersthe inferior day of today to the vastlymore delicious day of eleven years ago.I don't.Were I a writer striving to improvea public I would, on perceiving theant-like sense of the Public, give itall up and go off and pick up crumbsand tiny bits of straw in the hope ofsetting it a good example.But Alexandre Dumas fils neversaw this: I doubt if he ever saw any- thing. He lived so in touch withthings. He had a vague notion of thesethings gleaned by hearing differentreports day by day. These scraps hekept, recorded them — and referred tothem later on.I suppose he did this: even as Ionce kept a record of what was hap- pening to the sky, the sea, the sunand the wind in 1918-19-20. My re- cord has little pictures added to it hereand there so as to force people who shall see it in 1938 to prefer one dayto another even be the day 7392 daysmore out of date than the day theyare living through at that moment.And if Dumas fils had made moreattractive his Reasonable Conclusions— and that is the title I would giveto all his works — made them hap- pier things by a little inconsequent em- phasis here and there about nothing,had the tail pieces to his books beenlittle designs, plain or coloured, insteadof words, those final words, I dobelieve that some day the Public,looking back like the celebrated wife,would turn into pillars of sugar, becomeall sweetness for a moment... intent,absorbed... and then of course backto its own far sweeter human shapeand its humanity.But Dumas fils was bent upon re- forming the world, a world determined,come what come might, never to bereformed,Fils was weak: fils somehow feltthat he was born out of wedlock, — thatwedlock which so bores the Publicwhen past, is so necessary to it inthe Present, and let us hope inevitableto it in the Future.Fils was not exactly one of thePublic; to him the present was not onlyan important thing, it was everything.Fils was in fact limited to the pre- sent — and now he is in the pastwhile his pere is still going strong.THIS book on Dumas fils in in- teresting in a not quite dull way. Itappears to be the only book in En- glish on the younger Dumas whichgives a proper smattering of his life, anotion of his ideas and something ofhis technique.It is very interesting to me because1 like to witness the spectacle of Pa- ris accepting a moralist who teaches itwhat it ought to do by means of ser- mons from the boards. I love to seeand hear all that going on in Paristwixt 1844 and 1895 ... Paris. Andto think, too, that he, the son of oldAlexandre, took up writing, — evenwrote plays — succeeded very well,and yet spite of all in the last estimatefailed. This passion for teaching moralsthrough dramatic sermons, never foundin the father, grew strong in theson; the son sported with moral things;the father was only Dumas pere, ... thanwhich anything more moral withoutbothering to know of it never was orwill be.Those old tales of Musketeers andKings and Cardinals, of the Due de Ri- chelieu, ... those long and, to me, ma- sterly conversations out of which you feel the life of the persons emergingtill you fancy you are with them andthey breathing, walking, visible.But you've not read one of theseconversations for years — if ever.Those between the Due de Richelieu,and ... I forget in which book, delightme even in translation. It is, of course,in one of the Louis XV books, notLouis XIII or XIV: — that's theCardinal Richelieu. Quite another mor- sel. It is such fine stuff, this Dumas stuff.It's not Proust, I know, nor Bal- zac nor Stendhal: it's not Wilde orWilder : it's ordinary Dumas — plainBeaujolais au carafe. Everyone drinksit and enjoys it and so it* s not evenon the wine list. It's like the uncon- sidered air one breathes, the good breadand salt one eats — these things sounconsidered are too common to con- sider. Who ever spoke of bread?...did you know anyone stop to say akind word about salt? These are thingsabout which even a kind word is notnecessary,Enfold your little son who didtry so hard, enfold him in your bigarms and sleep well, you delicate oldgiant. I for one find you a very greatartist. THE STORY OF MY LIFE —MY MEMOIRS, by Yvette Guilbert.George G. Harrap. Price 2 / /-net.

Does she notremember Haldane MacFall or JohnMasefield, or even Max Beerbohm?She remembers a number of thea- trical and social people: — Sir AlfredButt 44 who neglected my publicity forthe sake of my fellow actor, Consul,the chimpanzee"; 44 Fred Terry andMiss Neilson so beautiful BeerbohmTree, Bourchier, Boucicault, come infor mention — for the barest mentionpossible.Then there is Theresa — Englishreaders would have liked to learn whoexactly was 44 La Grande Theresa ".Being a reviewer of books byprofession I, Drury Pervil, have anodd collection of paper-bound books— some 2300 books line the walls of my little den in Fleet Street whichmeasures eleven feet square. Theyhelp to warm my room in the winter,for they act as do those fur linings ofthe celebrated coats worn by successfulperformers —- and amongst these booksI find 44 Memoires de Theresa ecniespar Elle-Meme (3rd Edition) Paris EDentu 1865I have never read the book, and,had I the time, now would be themoment — if only to see if she forgetsany of her friends ...those who, anyhow,were artists of sorts ...or any artistes.Artistes and artists are not very muchalike.Several films of a nice thick pro- tective lining cover the perceptions ofperformers — artistes — or they wouldretreat sooner than they do from thepublic stage and forget who Bernhardtwas while intent upon who Goethe is.Artistes have to be less sensitive -—though Madame Guilbert all throughher book is ever more than sensitiveto the sufferings of her fellow artistesand unmindful of the feelings of ordi- nary millionaires, artists and othercommon folk. But Madame Guilberthas a tender corner in her heart forthe big middle class — although shedoes not say so she lets you see thatit is the middle class she understandsthe best.It is a charming book by a charmingperformer.

V/henever possible, I have44 accepted invitations outside, and have44 thus played in theatres of London44 (including the Haymarket and Strand),44 Stratford-on-Avon, Cardiff, Brighton,44 and (by way of a novel holiday in44 1926) as far afield as Bayes Theatre,44 New York, with a 44 Gloucester44 Vale " Company, visiting also Glou- 44 cester, MassachusettsAfter years of this acting, startingafter the day's work to 44 drive a loadedcar " to some neighbouring or distantplace, 44 bear the strain of an evening'sentertainment and drive home again,next morning starting out at 8.30 ",and after the 44 playing of nearly two hundred parts (two or them over onehundred times) " Mr. Hannam-Clarkfelt that 44 coming middle age " askedfor some rest, and so decided to *devote his leisured evenings to thepreparation of the notes which makeup this book, a task, the accomplish- ment of which entitles him to thegratitude of theatre students.Starting from the earliest recordsof old religious plays, he works downto the performance in February 1863at the Corn Hall, Cirencester by MissEllen T erry and her mother, of whichthe account in the 44 Wilts and Glos.Gazette is worth quoting from : —44 Mrs. Terry does not yet wish her44 young daughter to go out by herself,44 and although she (Mrs. T.) has not44 acted for 15 years, she consented44 to do so on this occasion .... In44 Miss Ellen Terry, although almost44 a child, being only 1 5 years of age,44 we see an actress who will shortly44 shine in the highest rank of her44 profession. We consider her acting44 wonderfully good, particularly when44 we know that, with an unselfishness44 which did her much credit, she only44 fixed a small share of her attention44 on herself and her own acting, and44 by far the largest share on everybody44 and everything else, always on the44 look out to help an actor out of a44 difficulty, even to taking his sentence44 and ingeniously making it her own,64 and ever and anon keeping a44 watchful eye on the scenery and44 stage business ... ".It is to be wished that many menof like enthusiasm and affection for thehistory of the English theatre wouldget to work in their own counties, sothat we might have a complete series ofthese regional histories and records ofthe drama and the theatre.But we hope, if they do this, theywill do it without being organized todo it — for the Drama League is allvery well.... but. EASTER AND OTHER PLAYS,by AUGUST STRINDBERG (An- glo-Swedish Literary Foundation. Jo- nathan Cape, 7/6. Hj HIS is the first publication of the* Anglo-Swedish foundation, thecreation of which is due to Mr. GeorgeBernard Shaw. As it will be remem- bered, he was awarded the NobelPrize in literature by the SwedishAcademy in 1928, when he offeredto give the whole sum — 1 18,165Swedish crowns — 44 for the purposeof encouraging cultural intercoursebetween Sweden and the British Islands and promoting a knowledge andappreciation of the literature and art ofSweden in Great Britain. " So saysMr. Erik Palmstiema in the Foreword.And then, almost as wishing todamn Strindberg in the eyes of theEnglish purchaser of this first volume,someone or other selects for it the fourleast representative plays and someoneelse permits the dastardly blunder. Noenemy of Strindberg could have actedwith more jealous care for his discom- fiture than the two, whoever they maybe, who selected and approved thisselection. Was no English Dramatistat hand with whom to take counsel ?no true admirer of this great Swedishwriter. Two plays which should havebeen in this first volume are 44 TheFather " and 44 Miss Julie ". Tobegin with, 44 The Father " was writtenin 1887, and 44 Miss Julie " in 1888 "whereas the four plays which we havebeen given were written in 1901 and after.The Introduction by ProfessorJ. G. Robertson is also unfortunate.What but this can one say for it inits lame attempt 44 to promote a know- ledge and appreciation of the literatureand art of Sweden in Great BritainDr. Robertson writes of Strindbergthat he was 44 Crushed and broken,despairing, mad ", and asks 44 is it to bewondered at that his life is strewnwith unforgivable sins against the HolyGhost ? " If I should not be thought tobe irreverent, I should murmur 44 HolyWillie! " Really, Dr. Robertson! and tosay that44 his genius was perverted by themisfortunes of birth and upbringingthat 44 he was helplessly at the mercyof passions — of hate as of love —-over which he had no control " ; oragain, 44 He found in life no sympathy,no permanent friends, no love of thekind that could resolve his distraughtcomplexes into harmony I wonderif Dr. Robertson ever knew Strindberg,or ever knew one of his many friends.Did he ever see him 44 crushed andbroken " or is it only a bad guess ?We are a little surprised that Mr.George Bernard Shaw allowed suchan Introduction to appear: but thenperhaps our noisy egoist has ceasedto have any interest in the Englishsuccess of his brother Strindberg.

Literaturein Europe is either terribly vagueaccording to these critics or it is thecritics who are vague.What I would have liked to learnis whether one of these can writewell, and what is the kind of goodwriting the said one writes: a little ofit analyzed; I would very much liketo know about a writer and goodwriting and what goes towards makingthe writing good. The writers in this book are concerned with conception —subject — tendencies of thought. It'sthe delivery would interest me.In a past age and a grander age— an age when it went withoutsaying that if you wrote at all youhad to write well — really well —any opinion would have been wellworth hearing expressed — or ratherreading its written expressien.

THE OXFORD BOOK OFCAROLS by Percy Dearmers R.Vaughan Williams and Martin Shaw.Oxford University Press. WHEN the Reverend Percy Dearmerwrites 44 Carols are songs with areligious impulse that are simple, hila- rious, popular and modem " he isthinking of the words.Now a Carol to so many of us isany old words so long as it can boast a rattling tune — to rattle us towardsChristianity — or, if it have a paganrattle, towards a nice Bacchic breakdownLet me get on.In this Collection of 204 carolsthe words and the music are set downand perfectly printed and published atan absurdly low price.I've heard Martin Shaw play someof these carols — so I know the musicis fine stuff ; but, on coming to reviewthis book so full of them, I want tohear the best songs over again andsome of the bad ones too.Bad there are none, so I meanrather, that I want to be reminded ofthe peculiarly empty bits — one wouldsuppose that music should never beand could never be dull.Yet even music can be dull...even music.It can meander on — as I'mmeandering here. It can fall intothe dreariest of moods, and, once incan trickle with dull notes, and rhythmswhich have lost delight and rhythmswhich falter through the habit of lollingalong.Sometimes one seems to be ableto anticipate what noise the old carolleris about to make: one feels by thesound of his weary tread that he'sgoing home again — tired out... yes,there he goes — yet to carol is toutter a joyous song, a warble ofbirds. That's why the Christmastunes were especially called carols.Music books in the future will besent out for review with two or threegramophone 44 records" of the musicto be reviewed, — for in Fleet Streetwe haven't enough pianos — and whenin a hurry we can't always rememberwhere we've put our penny whistle ;we know we put it into our waistcoatpocket with the fountain pen — we re- member it was sticking out just as welooked at our watch in the train ...butwhere it is now....And so here am I longing to geta thrill or two of Mr. Martin Shaw'sCarol No. 29.44 This new Christmas CarolLet us cheerfully sing"because Mr. Shaw has a way withhim with a carol which is inimitable,and I am unable to know what thatsounds like, for I have no 44 record " tohelp me out — no piano.And Mr. Vaughan Williams,gloomy as a Dane at times, can beso exquisitely lively at other times —and my intent had been to get at all theliveliness in these pretty things and toconvey to you how lively they had made me — the tunes I mean — as theystruck 44 up ...and all I am haunted byis the unutterable weakness of thewords. For example :— 44 the sevenVirgins THE SEVEN VIRGINS All under the leaves, the leaves of life,I met with virgins seven,And one of them was Mary mild,Our Lord's mother from heaven." O what are you seeking, you seven fair maids,All under the leaves of life?Come tell, come tell me what seek youAll under the leaves of life."" We're seeking for no leaves, Thomas,But for a friend of thine ;We re seeking for sweet Jesus Christ,To be our guide and thine."44 Go you down, go you down to yonder town,And sit in the gallery ;And there you'll find sweet Jesus Christ,Nailed to a big yew-tree."So down they went to yonder town,As fast as foot could fall,And many a grievous bitter tearFrom the virgins' eyes did fall.44C&gt; peace, mother, O peace, mother,Your weeping doth me grieve;0 1 must suffer this," he said,&lt;4 For Adam and for Eve."44 O how can I my weeping leave,Or my sorrows undergo,Whilst I do see my own Son die,When sons I have no mo'?"44 Dear mother, dear mother, you must takeJohn,All for to be your son,And he will comfort you sometimes,Mother, as I have done."44 O, come, thou John Evangelist,Fnou'rt welcome unto me,But more welcome my own dear son,That I nursed upon my knee."Then he laid his head on his right shoulder,Seeing death it struck him nigh :The Holy Ghost be with your soul, —I die, mother dear, I die."Oh the rose, the rose, the gentle rose,And the fennel that grows so green !God give us grace in every placeTo pray for our king and queen.Furthermore for our enemies allOur prayers they should be strong.Amen, Good Lord! your charityIs the ending of my song,I will pray for the King andQueen all right, but the rose the roseand the virgins seven and praying forthe enemy simply won't do — at least1 can't do it to the command of thesinger. That's why I like an oldPagan carol best — the words, I mean.But if I had a piano — if I hadthe gift for reading music at sight -—I know I should write somethingwhich would cause 30,000 copies ofThe Oxford Book of Carols to besold in one day... on anyhow three co- pies.Why doesn't the Oxford Univer- sity Press know how to advertise —just a little more, rather better?I confess to being utterly ignorantabout the management of the OxfordUniversity Press, and it may be a poorimpression I have received. Yet whileentirely an admirer of its organization,its creative output, I somehow findmyself wondering whether it has mas- tered the awful art of distribution asit might do — and as it surely will doin time.Distribution is essentially a cunningAmerican art as is advertising. I readamazing good notices of an OxfordPress book in 44 The Times ", in44 The Telegraph ", in the 44 DailyNews ", the 44 Daily Mail ", 44 Ex- press 44 Manchester Guardian44 Yorkshire Post"; yet when I gointo a bookseller's shop and lookaround for a copy of the amazinglywell noticed book, dash it, I can'tfind one.I go out and peer in at a window— not one displayed.I did this about a book I was keento see everywhere and found nowhere,although from the 44 l imes " to the44 Express" every paper had said itwas a first-class, British, manly, top- ping book.The Oxford University Press is anoble institution, but thai is no reasonfor its not realizing the essential ma- terial practicalism of this age.It is an honour to have a bookpublished by the Oxford UniversityPress, printing, paper, binding, courtesyof the whole management being per- fection; — but business is after allsomething : and I can suppose that anauthor, even the most British spiritedof British, might feel that after allbusiness results are what are desirable.The great firm, I have heard, alwaysdeals in a most businesslike way abouteverything: its contracts are all thatcould be desired by the two contractingparties — Publisher and Author —but results — what of these ?Anyhow, I, for one, would seesuch an exceptionally sound Publishingconcern better advertised and its booksbetter displayed. SHAKESPEARE AND CHAP- MAN AS TOPICAL DRAMA- TISTS, by Percy Allen (Cecil Palmer,Price 7/6). _______ THIS book purposes to say thatChapman had got Shakespeare sonicely on the brain that he did 44 withsurprising ingenuity and felicity, trans- mute, at will " certain scenes fromthe plays of the said Shakespeare -— and there you are. He transmuted 44 theirphraseology and ideas " only, says theauthor.He gives a few examples of preciselywhat he means. Shakespeare wrote44 Heaven's cherubim horsed upon thesightless couriers of the air and thenChapman writes :" Like death,Mounted on earthquakesIs that middle stump or not? Why,the man's a beastly thief.Again:" Fair is foul and foul is fair:Tover through the fog and filthy air/'Now who wrote that? Don't allsay at once 44 Chapman " — Shake- speare wrote it: but what did Chap- man write ? -Through foul and fair...Toss you into the air,If that isn't 1. b. w., I don't knowwhat is.q Of course there will be peo- ple who will say that the first pieceby Shakespeare, about 44 Heaven' scherubim," has ten or twelve differentreadings, no two of which are alikeand that 44 Fair and foul " was put inby somebody later, and that the word44 air " was really hair — 44 filthy hairbut then those are people who treat thematter without sufficient thought. Thisbook I am glad to say is one whichimpels thought.To take another and better example,Shakespeare's" You have displaced the mirth, brokethe good meetingWith most admired disorder ; "has so got into Chapman's brain, soutterly possessed him, that withoutknowing what he is doing, he writes ;44 Ladies, ye have not done our ban- quet right I think the case for theplaintiff is proved: but if there is thefaintest doubt remaining in any reader'scharitable heart, it will be instantly di- spelled by the following: -Shakespeare: I have seen her... unlock hercloset, fakeforth paper.Chapman: - " Make hasteTo see the dangerous paper/'1 ask you ! THE LONE HOUSE MYSTERY,by Edgar Wallace. W. CollinsSons &amp; Co., London, Price 3J6. IT is not as though I go unwillingly toa thriller by Mr. Wallace, for Ibelong to that strange crowd of English readers who occasionally like to wastethe unforgiving hour with sixty minutesworth of duty dodged and I like athriller. And I have ever enjoyed a faintthrill from the books of Mr. Wallace— from those I bought and those I havehad sent me to review.But somehow the elements andthe English climate conspire againstMr. Wallace. Fog — mist — rain —damp are bad for books. Perhaps adetective story should not be laid inEngland — the Detectives shouldanyhow not be Britons and the writermust never be too clever or too dull.Mr. Wallace is a mosaic of twentydifferent clevernesses : like the fox of thefable who, had he written a tale ofcrime and detection, would haveemployed ail his tricks and forgottenthe main one. The cat would neverhave done that. She would have beenout of the bag in a second. Mr. Wal- lace, to my mind, forgets that main trick— which is, to carry us on to the con- tinent, and to do it all there. We canbe far more easily fooled about thingsthere, for we know its shimmering sur- face only, and these tales, after all, dealwith Hash surface things.And this is one of the reasonswhy I so vastly prefer Mr. A. E. W.Mason's 44 House of the Arrow ",44 No Other Tiger", and 44 Villa Rose",to Mr. Wallace's 44 The Ringer44 Terror Keep", and 45 The LoneHouse Mystery Wallace brings inthe foreign element now and again butfrom the wrong foreign parts. In theshape of Indians — brown, not red —and these poor souls only emphasise thedamp and foggy nature of the placeinto which he has dragged them andwhere in he dumps his story.No firework will go off properlywhen damp — the display will bemore dismal than is necessary. Butin the crisp air of Mentone, or travellingswiftly in the Paris-Lyon express —arriving at the Hotel International atBeauvantage, that charming villagethree and a half miles, or a littlefurther, from Beaujeu — what maynot click happily —- what not be putupon the spongy readers — who darereceive it other than the author wills.Again, the British detective is reallynot the kind to sit for a full-lengthportrait — he is too genuine. To us— to me — the Frenchman is thefellow: he who shows a heart evenif he have none — is a brilliant withoutever having been a rough diamond —understands human nature — is awalking Montaigne, Voltaire. andChopin, rolled all in one — is aHercules of strength — a Machiavelli of cunning — loses his head — histemper — is " human " — and aboveall, is not real enough to spoil the fun.Wallace's policemen are cold vividrealistic portraits — one cannot see theman for the likeness.But " The Lone House Mystery,"bound in nice blue cloth, is well worththe 3/6 Messrs Collins ask for it —and ask in these words, saying on thewrapper " This is a thriller whichgives us all we have learnt to expect ofEdgar Wallace — Murder, Mystery, De- tection, Excitement, and a little Love."

May I entreat Mr. Parsons,Mr. Swaffer and Mr. Darlington, thebrilliant dramatic critics of the " DailyMail the "Express" and the "DailyTelegraph " to draw the attention ofall actors to this work and to go ondrawing their attention to it until theylisten and get the book.May I beseech other critics whocare for our English stage to recognizethe value of this study and to urgeactors to really study it.May I request all publishers, editors,those who care to see all the artsrevive, to first revive the dramatic artby telling actors to buy, read, study,and digest this book. May I invite allthese who lecture on the Theatre totake this book round England andlecture on what this book contains.May I supplicate these lecturers torealize that in this book can be foundone of the great secrets England isanxious to discover.M. Ducharire, the author, has donewell to get Mr. Harrap the publisherto issue this volume in English andMr. Weaver has translated it well.It is a book about the Theatre whenDrama was made by the Theatre, inthe Theatre and for the Theatre and notby outsiders, outside the playhouse andto impoverish the playhouse.This history of the true and onlyProfessional Comedy is the history ofour house doing its own work.In 1906, 1907 and 1908 one theatrealone paid £134,000 to three outsiders because the managers pretended tha*the insiders ...the actors ...couldn t dotheir own work.If the Cinema and the Talkies aredeveloping at our Theatre's expenseit is because actors will not wake upand stop dreaming.This book proves it. It shows us apowerful Theatre with over a hundredfirst-rate men of talent supporting thattheatre by their genius. May I suggestthat the Theatre can do that and becomethat again without outside assistance.But some of you actors must stopbeing so witless as to be found givingharbour in your own house to men whoWrite plays ...when you don't need themand you do need the £ 1 34,000 thatthree of them at your special invitationrobbed you of between 1906 and 1908.

EDITORIAL NOTESOCTOBER: NOVEMBER: DECEMBER THE PLAYS OF TCHEKOV. '"J"1 CHEKOV'S Plays are now beingperformed at the Fortune TheatrePlayhouse London.Are the plays of Tchekov trage- dies, comedies or what are they ?J They cannot be tragedies if themean, the little, way in which theyare handled by all producers is theright way. Tchekov would seem tohave created some ordinary men andwomen, mostly dishonest, or goodlittle fellows in parts, living in theworld we recognize as the most usualexpressionless of all worlds — thatwhere experience has failed to openany doors. It is a cooped-in world :nothing tragic can enter it becausetragedy can only come in if theheroic is admitted.Strindberg often creates a figure ofthis stature: he may surround hisfigure with petty ones; it does notmatter ; the whole play assumes heroicproportions because of the centralfigure. It therefore becomes tragic orcomic, but nothing betwixt or between.Not so Tchekov, who seems notto write tragedies or comedies butsomething in between ; — delicate heis, — a kindly doctor not willing toscare his patient: he seems to createthings like prescriptions to be left inthe bottle or taken solemnly in thebelief that in any case it is bound todo us good. And like every goodprescription it does us no harm. Hisdoses prefer to do their level leastrather than to attempt anything more.We think we prefer this to quack reme- dies roaringly prescribed by one of theShavian school of medicine.And so we suppose after all that thestage producers who prepare the dose,even as the chemist makes up thedraught, are doing quite the right thingin bottling it with modesty — quietlabel and all, with " a teaspoonfulafter meals three times daily ". No- thing tragic could result from this —and nothing comic either unless one isgiven to giggling — when it would be*s well to consult Dr. Sheridan andget done with the business.That English actors can playTchekov as well as do the usual run of Russian actors is probable: butwhat is not probable is that they canplay it perfectly as did M. Stani- slavsky's troupe in 1900 and thereabouts.If they could do so, wherein wouldlie the value of Stanislavsky, Moquin,Katchaloff, Dancheno, Knipper andLilina ? and their theatre in the Ka- mergersky Pereulok? A NATIONAL THEATRE. \Y7HAT is to be said about the** recent absurd attempt to saddleEngland with a manufactured NationalTheatre ?The best way to make a realNational Theatre (like that of Molierein France, for example,) is to waituntil the nation can single out thebest Theatre in London from thethirty worst, to discover if possible agreat artist at work there, and then tomake the thing national by law — anddo it quietly.First get the man, the place andthe twenty plays — a reality, — aworking theatre (as was Moliere'sshow) and then make that National.But to set about it as it is now beingdone —- and through the poor littleDrama League, is ridiculous.But really!!!....? Is it not ridiculous }We don't think very much of theOld Vic, and we think poorly ofDrury Lane Theatre as it is runnowadays, but we would a dozen timessooner see either institution given£ 400,000 and dubbed " National "than this soapbubble which is beingblown by the Drama League.Organization is all very well espe- cially when there is something whichneeds controlling — wrhen somethingreally exists to control. But to orga- nize so as to puff a bubble of soapis a bit thin.Mr. Whitworth the Secretary of theDrama League has a real talent fororganizing and we have always wishedhim well. It is because Mr. Whit- worth was at work with the DramaLeague that we controlled ourselves anddidn't laugh loudly at the silly affair.But now things have gone too far.Mr. Whitworth has been overwhelm- ed by the preposterous idea of the Committee, (if there really be a Com- mittee), and the British Drama Leaguehas developed a pomposity which canonly be equalled by the fanatics inIndia who think they know how togovern their ungovernable selves.The Drama League is a joke — butthe National Theatre isn't a joke atall. It will cost over a million, saywhat you will — more likely twomillions. If it doesn't it will becomea kind of after joke — when we laughno more. There is the Channel Tunnelwhich will be asking for funds sooneror later and to which all the NationalTheatre funds could be given.The British Drama Leaguers mightall drop fooling with Theatres andlend a hand at burrowing under theChannel : — give them something todo anyhow — fill in their spare time.Decidedly anyone in power and inhis senses who is taken in by thesolemn but not serious folk cf the BritishDrama League deserves to lose hisplace ... for it's a fatuous idea, fan- tastically thought out, fanatically pursuedand not worth a fig, SMOKING IN THE THE A TRE. A very excellent thing prevails (maybe it increases too) in the EnglishTheatre. Smoking is permitted in sometheatres. The Official 1 heatre Guidegiving a list of forty-four London Thea- tres tells us that in seventeen of thesesmoking is permitted.It used to be allowed in ItalianTheatres —in nearly all: but the Fa- scist! have done away with the custom.One can suppose that for the Ita- lian Theatre this is a good thing: butwe are pleased to see that seventeenout of forty-four London Theatres en- courage the custom.The central London Theatres inwhich you make smoke are:The Adelphi PavilionCarlton MaskelynesDominion PalaceDuke of York's PalladiumGaiety PiccadillyHippodrome Prince of WalesKingsway ShaftesburyWinter Garden,and the two outlying theatres, one atGolders Green, one atLewisham, followfollow the custom.We would see smoking permittedat all the theatres where Shakespeareis played. Smoking is not an idle habitwith most men — as a rule it accom- panies them in their more seriours hours— it settles them.Actors want men to feel settled ata performance of a Shakespeare play. LAST WORDS. PLAY DOWNREMEMBER QUINCTILIANI J. B. " Care should be takers not thai the: readermay understand if he will, but that he mustunderstand, whether he will or not.Quinctilian.HP HE most interesting thing, to me, about thegreat Hatry sensation, is that I was notable to understand one word of what it wasabout, from the great London journals whichwere sent to me. I grant you that 1 only re- ceived one, hut it was one of the widest-cir- culated, and has a continental edition, and isa journal I am always very pleased with.!s it possible that the great master minds ofjournalism have a blind spot in them ?Is it possible that they can suppose that alltheir readers understand every reference to finan- cial things as easily as ABC ?Perhaps this is so.The excellent paper to which I refer had itsfront pages for three days almost packed fullof news about Hatry and what he had done,and it forgot to tell us the most elementalfacts about the affair. It forgot to explain whatthe Stock Exchange is, what its action mightbe, who its Committee is, why it has a Com- mittee, what shares are, and how it is thatone town can be involved and suffer througha Mr. Hatry, and how it is that such a di- saster is possible, on this same Stock Exchangeand how possible for four people, Hairy* Da- niels, Tabor, Dixon, to conspire.Now if it had been anything about thea- tres, or anything about painting, sculpture, ar- chitecture, and, to go further than this, aboutfood, about religion, about tailoring, aboutcosmetics — anything you like — the great journalwould have been careful to sink its intelligencethe level of babies and to explain every termthat it used. Had it been writing about thea- tres, and something had happened at the greatComedie Francaise, which is the most im- portant theatre in Europe, it would have ex- plained what the Comedie was, when founded,when built, whst its functions were, what thechances were of success and failure in such aplace; and it would have left no possible loop- hole for anyone to misunderstand. But owingto this blind spot in the modern mind of thegreat editors of to-day, since they buy andsell, presumably, in this place called the StockExchange, they imagine that everybody mustunderstand what an Exchange is, what stockis, what this place's Committee is, and soforth.The journal I refer to gave a list of enor- mous sums of money, the capitals of a dozenor so big business affairs — £ 68,000,000schemes ". it said in its headline — butit did not explain what a scheme was, orhow £ 68,000.000 could be put in to a44 scheme ", by a fool or a rogue and the restof the people back up that scneme and ap- plaud the putting in of &lt;£ 68,000,000.To a fairly poor man what was printed ap- peared like a farcical talk or a nightmare —what must the million readers down in Dorsetor up in Cumberland have thought as theyread this abracadabra ? These big journals, arethey perhaps becoming just a trifle high-brow ?— are they not a little above our heads ?We who adore our Edgar Wallace andhis perfect lucidity, we do not deserve to bedazzled — teazed by the subtlety of ourmorning paper.I was reading Edgar Wallace only today...his 44 The Ringer '. What a masterpiece it is.Enter Detective to Villain. 44 I am a detective— you have a villainous face — I suspect you —- good morning *\ Villain says as theDetective goes away 44 I almost believe thatman suspects something Telegram arrivesnext moment for Villain: 44 I said so hedoes suspect something — he suspects me ".Detective by now on the way to station;4 There's a thing that puzzles me and it'sthis... that villain, though it would be hardto make anyone believe me, I suspect him ofbeing the villain of this piece ".I recall seeing Edgar Wallace's successfulplay 44 The Flying Squad 44 — it ran on andon and on — a wonderful success. I sat a- mazed at the author's astounding capacity toguage the intelligence of his vast audience —never for a moment did he over-estimate theirunderstanding, their desire for originality, theirwish for a thrill, their capacity to follow him.It seemed to me as I watched that EdgarWallace had said to himself '4 The public isa very great fool indeed — but indeed a verygreat fool. Don t be a greater one and give'em anything new, witty, human, touching,heroic, grand or melodramatic, for if you doit will be all thrown away on them. Justbring on characters known since the first playwas written, but be careful to bring forwardinto prominence those overlooked supers of thethird row of the chorus — the featurelessexpressionless, forlorn people who never hada chance: centre these: tell them to be na- tural and never to over-do it: thus our dearlyloved audience of 3000 dullards will see a per- fect reflection of themselves; they deserve that— it's not their fault they are dull but itwould be mine if I didn4t play right down tothem ".Well, ; I feel like Edgar Wallace. I feelit is that "great newspaper's fault that it didn'tplay down to my intelligence when it reportedall about the Hatry affair and told me nothing. MISS ANGNA ENTERS D. P. | have never seen this lady perform, buteveryone seems to speak well of her... 1 hateto discover that I have said what someone inThe School for Scandal " says of JosephSurface. There is some critical use in theline, when applied to any celebrated success- ful performer: the performer must have stoopedrather, bent a little, been of a coming-on dispo- sition for every one to find the performerwonderful. What a ridiculous creature thespectators form themselves into — that mon- strous thing called an audience; fancy beingdisposed to stoop to it.I always like a conquering actor betterthan a winning actress, for the reason that hecomes at them — he doesn't bend to them :and indeed, for all 1 know, Miss Enters maybe like Mrs Siddons and do just that; I wouldeven be prepared to believe that she ignoresthem entirely — that she is so concerned withher art of composition that she never givesthem a thought. If so, she will he certainlyone of the unique persons of the stage.1 very much wish that those who writeabout performers would cease to talk of themas artists, would invent a new name for them,if they are not content with the word 44 per- former, " and would refer to what they doby using any other word except that of 44 art. "Miss Enters seems to be a dancer, and, so faras I can gather, her dance is more like thatof Emma Hamilton, and much less like that of La Taglione. I can almost suppose thatwhat she does is rather more acting than dan- cing. She seems also to dress up a great deal:she likes to look each part and she has anumber of them. We are told that 44 She hasa gift of expression " and that hadshe employed the most perfect speaking voicein the world, she would not have added oneiota to the effectiveness of her presentation. "AH critics praise her to the skies ; but it is alittle bit embarrassing to find one of themsaying It is not dance, it is not drama, itis divination. " That won't do, and that iswhy I want to see her to discover what it is. REVIEW COPIES OF BOOKS. J. S. It was with a copy of Monsieur Duchar- tre's The Italian Comedy " that we receivedfrom Messrs Harrap a printed letter in whichthese publishers make a special and reasonablerequest: and we think that it is to the interestof authors, public, publishers, and indeed, eve- ryone else, to reprint that " request " — be- cause it is quite likely that very few otherjournals or magazines will reprint it:- A SPECIAL REQUEST. The practice of selling review copiesof books at less than the published price ap- pears to be on the increase, and is a sourceof much trouble and misunderstanding topublishers and booksellers. Cases have beenknown in which such books have been soldto booksellers at a low rate before publication.While recognizing that it is impossibleto prevent the sale of review copies publishersearnestly request editors and reviewers to usetheir influence to prevent such sales, at anyrate until one month after publication." 44 The Mask " has for years now issuedstrict injunctions that no reyiew copies what- ever are to be sold, at least within two yearsafter publication. We know that reviewerslook on the copies of the books they are obligedto review as perquisites, but we don't likethat notion at all. Of course, if they did notsell these copies, and fairly cheaply, a sectionof the public could not obtain them from thesecond-hand bookseller for the very few shil- lings it is willing to pay. But then nobodyshould be able to buy a 30 /- book for 12/-the same year in which the book is issued, thesame month — the same week : and we thinkthat some law might be passed to prevent anyunder-selling of a book within a given time.We suppose the Society of Authors has long agolooked into the matter, but if so we should liketo know what results have been achieved -—for it must be a pretty bad state of affairswhen Messrs Harrap are obliged to send round this special but reasonable request.
