In this Teatro we see a " Barriera " being performed on a scale worthy of a great city. The inventer of the Teatro and the big ship seen in the right hand corner was Francesco Guitti of Ferrara who also invented some of the songs. This same Guitti invented for the Carnival in Ferrara (1638) a stage with an interesting arrangement op steps leading down to the floor of the auditorium.

Plate 9. THEATRE AND ENGLISH THEATRE J. S. THESE are not one and the same thing.The Theatre is a world thing: the theatre of Englandis a local thing. In the World Theatre the theatre of Englandhas a place, but not the first place. Its place is near theFrench Theatre. The French Theatre will not protest when weremind it that Shakespeare (though exiled by us) is still a member ofour Theatre, and a name we use to conjure with.WHILE the Russian, German and Italian Theatres cannot showa star of such magnitude and brilliance as Shakespeare orMoliere, they are today taking more forward positions than those towhich the French and English manipulators are happy to see theirtwo theatres relegated.The Russians, Germans and Italians use the best brains of theirTheatres*The American Theatre is awake to possibilities.THE English Theatre concerns us most. We would like to see itin a more leading position.The English Theatre is hide-bound. It continues to allow the sameold underhand manipulators of the last forty years to muddle things.Its critics, if old, mutter the same contented platitudes; if young, a fiveyears course of the underhand Professionalism soon brings them to toethe line and mumble what they are told to mumble. JF this be good enough for you, it is not good enough for us.But how get along with things, ....how get things better....how esta- blish a theatre that is worth while?By establishing a National Theatre ? That might prove to be merelya waste of Public money, for some of those interested in seeing it estab- lished are too self-interested. We are not ready for a National Theatre,for we have nothing to put into it. Names are nothing. Shakespeare isa name and we have rendered it a valueless one today, for we cannotdo justice to one of his works ; at best we can but vamp happily, orsentimentally, through one or two. By saying this we would not un- dervalue the work of the " Old Vic " whose members we believe tobe an honest group of workers. The '* Old Vic " may do goodwork; it is spoken of as one of the best companies at present in harness;but it is not greatly gifted enough, not powerful enough, to restoreto Shakespeare his old values. Which are immense.Honest men working without thought of self, we must have; butwe must also have an honest man of brains and imagination as theirleader.NOT until England chooses to drive away the hundreds of pettysomebodies, ceases straining an ear to the mumbling of certaincritics, those poseurs who have kept our Theatre under for these lasttwenty years, not till then will there be room for the better workers.Until England clears out the underhand Professional " manipulators "and invites the new men in, the English Theatre will be forced intothe background by other European theatres.UNTIL all the artists, and the whole art of the Theatre, be rein- stated in the English Theatre, and placed under one leader, theold critics may mumble in good prose and the young critics may cry outfor mild reforms; ....all is useless. The English Theatre will remain inthe place it now fills with such unnecessary distinction,—a back seat. JOHN EVELYN AND THE THEATREIN ENGLAND, FRANCE, AND ITALY.

PART ONE. BEFORE ITALY HAS it not been admitted long ago thatJohn Evelyn is one of the mostcharming, one of the best of English tra- vellers ? No great traveller in the sensethat he goes great distances ; but wher- ever he does go he behaves better thananyone else. Coryat, who races throughItaly, France, Germany, England and theNetherlands in five months, hastily gob- bling up, as he admits, these morsels, " and now ", he adds, " dispensing tothe nourishment of the traveling man ofthis kingdome " Coryat must be grum- bling at all he sees, five months for fivelands, ....a month a-piece.... always findingthings " begarly ", always comparing un- favourably, always showing an astonishedopen mouth (if not an open mind), at" things that I never saw before " ; in short,always rude.But Evelyn, enjoying himself, nevergrumbles that he is abroad; and whatbetter behaviour than this were possible ?His travels take him no-further than Italy.Starting on Wednesday, the 1 1 thNovember, 1643, at the age of twenty- three, he stops a while in Paris, goesdown to Genoa; on to Siena; arrives inRome, getting there on Friday, November4th., 1644. So he has taken a full yearto reach the fine city, and there he loiterstill the end of January, 1645, that is tosay, for three months.Now to begin with, this is good be- haviour ; for to rush to, and through a place, a place which is not your own, is to be ina hurry. To do a thing in a hurry is apity, and to visit a place like Italy, whichmen have laboured for centuries to perfect,with haste as your guide, unless you bea monarch, a great person, whose time isnot his own but his People's, or a courieror a commercial traveller, is to be a donkey:such a donkey as was Coryat, as wasLithgow, as were neither Byron nor Goethe.Yet, for me, Evelyn is a better travellerthan either of these two. He is so staid,yet so able to enjoy.Again, Evelyn does not potter aroundlooking for trouble ; no one tortures Eve- lyn, whereas Mr. William Lithgow, whospent nineteen years afoot, went 36,000miles, seemed unable to rest until he wason the rack.After leaving Rome, Evelyn goes downto Naples, but returns to Rome, recollec- ting in time that if he once sees Naplesproperly he must die, preferring to havea last glance at Rome, and to live to seeVenice. So he is back in Rome byMonday, February 1 3th., and stays thereuntil Thursday, May 18th., enjoying theearly Spring " purchasing many bookspictures and curiosities ". Then Venicecalls, and he moves in that direction soas to be there " if possible, by the Ascen- sion ", in May, regretfully " turning aboutto behold this once and yet glorious city(Rome) from an eminence.... to give it mylast farewell . Is he not charming as atraveller? Who understands so well, thesecret of this youthful, ancient city, " This once and yet glorious city ". Others wouldnot have risen to the " and yet ".While purchasing books and pictureshe had met all the men of note, seen mostthings, enjoying all the things he had seen,without unusual surprise, yet without mis- sing a spark of the novelty of it all; gar- dens, houses, grottoes, hangings and otherexecutions, carnival impertinences, fireworks,ruins, sermons, jewels, sculpture, men andwomen, all these things are immenselypleasing to Mr. John Evelyn; and it isjust because he is such a gentleman of theworld, never in a hurry, always at his easeand keen about all that is happening, thatI value so highly all that he writes aboutthe Theatres which he found pleasant tovisit. And he writes of them as he writesof Cardinals or of ruins, of pictures orthe fire-works; to him they all live, andeach lives with its own life, and is there- fore not to be confounded with the others.Never does he fail to understand andso never is he rude. Indeed, a charmingEnglishman; and, after he had left Italy,assuredly those Italians who had met himmust have been forced to revise their judg- ments of the northern savages.I cannot imagine old Pepys toddlingdown to Rome. He evidently could notimagine himself doing that, and so he didnot g0.... wise old man: and surely thisPepys was born old even as Evelyn diedyoung at 86. Pepys' words are so oftenquoted, his chatty bits about Nell Gwynne,Drury Lane and so home to bed, withall the rest of it. He has grown so staleand parochial that he has ceased for meto be anything but a bore. He is theDemocrat's blessing, I know it; still I wouldlike to ship him to Germany in exchangefor Shakespeare. He is so comfortable,and gemutlich he could remain.... in Ger- many.A dear old man, perhaps; and without him so much would be lost when we cometo the passages in Evelyn's hook when thetwo men meet long after Evelyn's travelsare over forever and a day. At thesemoments my mind's eye glances back acrossthe Alps, and I look at Evelyn. We arein Pepys' snug smug r00m.... outside thewindow, a grey mist, and lanterns and themoving torches.... here, this little traveller,now grown old, stands against the man- telpiece listening to " the rare voice ofMr. Pule, who was lately come fromItaly ", singing " several compositions ofthe late Dr. Purcell ". Mr. Pule (plainPaoli, or Paul, in Venice without any Mr.)is doing his best with the sad sweet Irishairs of Purcell. When he returns hometo Venice he will tell them of Purcell andof sadness : of that no doubt whatever.But will he speak of il Signor Pepys ?" Yes ", he may say, " In Londra, c'eun Signore.... molto ricco.... vada, Bruno,vada, a Londra ".... adding, " and do notforget when you do go to call yourselfMr. Brun. It's only over here that we,the Vincis and the Cellinis, are known byour christian names Paolo, Leonardo, Ben- venuto. In London it isn't done ". Andas Evelyn stands there, he knows this, buthe will not undeceive poor old Pepys; thethought brings back to him a glimpse ofhis early days in ItalyNo, he will not undeceive poor oldPepys : Pepys so ready to believe all hehears about Drury Lane or Nell Gwynne,but almost unaware that Italy is a realplace.What Pepys tells us of the Theatreis not worth the telling. He had no ears,and no eyes even when his sight wasgood (k). Evelyn had taken care to acquire acutesenses before he left for Italy, as you willsee when I remind you of what he did,and what he heard and saw, and howhe received it all. I cannot write of itall: I may not make a big book, norcould I if I might, but I wish to lingera short while on all that he speaks ofconcerning the Theatre, even if I make asmall book in doing so, and 1 will repeatall he says, and begin at the beginning.FIRST of all I will hazard a reason forEvelyn's interest in the Theatre.The earliest record of his about aplay is one associated with pain.... and,as we know, there is nothing so surelybrings back a clear remembrance of a thingas pain does. (c)Something we had not loved so verymuch (not having noted it) becomes dearto us, not because of the pain, but be- cause our mind must return, and returnagain, to consider this unnoted thing.Lying wounded in a field of dandelions,dandelions at which we had looked withoutinterest all our life long, we shall neverforget them—their form—their colour—their movement—their scent. They willbecome dear, for we shall have come toknow them at last. And, so it was withEvelyn and the Theatre. Evelyn is se- venteen years old : " The Christmas en- suing being at a comedy, which thegentlemen of Exeter College presentedto the University, and standing, for thebetter advantage of seeing, upon a ta- ble the Hall, which was near toanother, in the dark being constrainedby the extraordinary press to quit mystation, in leaping down to save myself1 dashed my right leg with such vio- lence against the sharp edge of the otherboard, as gave me a hurt which heldme in cure till almost Easter, and con- fined me to my studyOXFORD, DEC. 9, 1637.Confined in his study for thirteen tofourteen weeks, his thoughts turn againand again to the Comedy.... to this stagevision which was suddenly blotted outwithout reason and the last glimpse of itbitten into the brain.... into the wholebeing rather.tf The first Theatre entry in his diaryrecords a comedy seen in England, thesecond records a perspective—the thirdsome marionettes—the fourth a theatre :all seen in Paris as he lingers there onhis way to 1ta1y.... play, scene, perfor- mers and theatre, all in the right order.He stays in the French capital fromthe beginning of December, 1643, untilthe middle of April, 1644. Four-and- a-half months is a long time ; there isample margin to see things, many littlethings, in eighteen weeks, more especiallysince things were really happening in 1 644in Paris. Moliere is in Paris, he is be- ginning to play comedies, but he is notattracting much attention, so no one seems tohave taken Evelyn to see him. On Ja- nuary 1 st. of this year Evelyn could haveseen Moliere at the Faubourg St. Ger- main, and seen " The Illustrious Theatre "at work, for it was founded that year :or he could have seen him at the Jeu de Paume de la Croix Noire on the QuaiSt. Paul. (Plate 10, fig. 2). But neitherMoliere nor " the Illustrious Theatre seemto have been quite ripe. Moliere is notyet even taking his lessons from the greatItalian comedian, 1 iberio Fiorilli, (plate 9)and it is only after he has done so in1645 that he perceives how long the craftof Italian acting will take to master, andthat, as life is as short as ever, seven oreight years will not be too long a timeto devote to the study and practice ofthe craft. And so, off he goes into theFrench provinces to hide his blunderingfirst steps, concocting at the end of thattime his first comedy, more or less a copyof an Italian comedy called " The Blun- derer ".Evelyn looking around, overlooks thislittle beginner, Moliere. Yet he has hiseyes wide open, and one or two curiousthings are noted down by him. The firstof these is a piece of skilful perspective,not this time in a theatre, but on a wall,in Cardinal Richelieu's villa at Ruell. Inthe Orangery there he is pulled up byperceiving at the end of it, " the Arch" of Constantine, painted on a wall in" oil (?) as large w as the real one in" Rome, so well done, that even a man" skilled in painting, may mistake it for" stone and sculpture. The sky and hills,*( which seem to be between the arches," are so natural, that swallows and other" birds, thinking to fly through, have dash- "ed themselves against the wall. I was" infinitely taken with this agreable cheat ".Here we have an example of that per- spective painting which was soon to playan important part in the Theatre of thenext hundred years or so.It had not yet become the fashion in the north to paint perspectives in the Thea- tres, but it was occasionally employed tolengthen or vary the appearance of smallcourtyards. (Plate 10, Fig. 1) (Mr. Poveyhad an elegant house in Lincoln's Inn Fieldsin 1664 with a perspective painted byStreeter in his court. Count de Lain- court had one as we shall see, in his gar- den in the Rue de Seine in 1644. InItaly they were the fashion). And someperspective scenes were being done at thistime in Italy, and by painters, althoughthe artists interested in the Theatre werestriving to perfect a different kind of per- spective scene there. This was a thingbuilt, according to the rules of false per- pective. (e)This painting on the wall at Ruellwas, to Evelyn, an " agreable cheat ".Well, so long as it was agreeable to him,who shall find fault ? Evelyn is a gentle- man who is able to persuade me, by hisplain way, to many a pleasant folly em- ployed by our ancestors in their life andin their Theatres, against which all thedull logic of more cynical men could notpersuade me.Evelyn's quiet delight in devoting fifteenlines to recording this glimpse of a smallMarionette Theatre in Paris, delights me,too, in just the same way, and in like mea- sure no less, no more.I have not come across his " find inany other record; even the historians Ma- gnin (1852) and Maindron (circa 1890),Rehm (circa 1892), Joseph (1920), (9seem to have been, unaware of this Tea- trino, and it is no usual one. I hope some day to find a design showing us what it look- ed like : here is something for a student tosearch for in the archives of Paris. Andthis is Evelyn's entry : 44 1 went to see the44 Count de Laincourt's Palace in the44 Rue de Seine (See Page 101) which44 is well built. Towards his study and44 bedchamber joins a little garden, which,44 though very narrow, by the addition of44 a well painted perspective, is to appea- -44 ranee greatly enlarged ; to this there is44 another part, supported by arches in44 which runs a stream of water, rising in44 the aviary, out of a statue, and seeming44 to flow for some miles, by being arti- -44 ficially continued in the painting, when44 it sinks down at the wall. It is a very44 agreeable deceit. At the end of the44 garden is a little theatre, made to change44 with divers pretty scenes, and the stage44 so ordered, with figures of men and wo- -44 men painted on light boards, and cut44 out, and, by a person who stands un- -44 derneath, made to act as if they were 44 speaking, by guiding them, and reciting44 words in different tones, as the parts44 require. We were led into a round44 cabinet, where was a neat invention for44 reflecting lights by lining divers sconces44 with thin shining plates of gilded cop- -44 per". ST. GERMAIN, MARCH Ist. 1644.Obviously one of the most interesting re- cords of a 1 7th. century marionnette theatrewhich exists. Evelyn has seven moreentries which touch on this little branchof Theatre work.While in Paris, Evelyn 44 often wentto the Palais Cardinal " and saw its thea- tre ; of this he says no more than that hesaw it. Of the performances there, if hewas present at any, he has nothing tosay.In fact, he is struck by no dramaticperformance at all in Paris. Yet Riche- lieu's theatre was just opened (January1641) and the Cardinal liked things doneproperly, and as Evelyn moved in highcircles he would have had little difficultyin being present at the properest of Courtperformances.In the Marais Tennis court, in Paris,performances were to be seen with Mon- dory (a fine actor, one hears) in the chief parts. Tiberio Fiorilli G) was in Paris in1639 and 1645.Yet Evelyn speaks of none of these.Perhaps he is waiting until he sees theItalian Theatre work. When he comesupon this, he speaks to some purpose, aswe shall see later. PART TWO. ITALY. AND now he goes down towards Italy,stopping here and there on his wayto make a note of a theatre or two. OnThursday, September 15th., " a singingtheatre " is noted in the Cardinal's oldhouse at Richelieu ; another, an amphi- theatre, in ruins but " pretty entire ", atVienne in Dauphine; this on Friday Sep- tember 30th ; and on Sunday, October9th., " the ruins of a most stately am- phitheatre " at Peigneux " which I wentout to design " and which was called theRolsies.Then at last—Italy ! He passesthrough Genoa, Pisa, Livorno—and on toFlorence, arriving there on Sunday, Octo- ber 23rd., and leaving in a few days forSiena, or Sienna, as he writes it. Herehe seems for the first time to get wordof Italian opera, for he writes : " In the Senate House is a very fair Hall, wherethey sometimes entertain the people withpublic shows and operas, G) as they callthem ". OCTOBER, 1654. SIENA.The " very fair Hall " here spokenof by Evelyn, is seen in the plan whichI give here of the Senate House (Plate 1 1,fig. 2). It was a theatre built in 1 560by Bartolomeo Neroni, detto Riccio, tobe rebuilt in 1 753 by Antonio Bibiena, ason of " il Famoso " Fer- dinando Galli of Bibiena. A theatre isstill there but it does not look very inte- resting, and as most of Antonio Bibiena'sexisting Theatres look most interesting Idoubt if the Siena remains are those ofthe 1 753 play-house.So far, Evelyn seems to have seen noperformances, probably for the reason thatit is not yet Carnival time when he ar- rives in Italy, and it was usually only atCarnival time that the Italian theatreswere in full swing.From Siena he goes on through MonteOlivetto, Buon Convento, Torrinieri, toSt. Quirico. Here was born much laterthat abominable scenographer Sanquirico.Evelyn would not have called his work" abominable" ; what would he havesaid of it, I wonder ? Here Evelyn seesnothing of any theatre, but he writes," .... we lay at a private osteria near"it (the village) where, after we wereprovided of lodging, came in Cardi- " nal Donghi, a Genoese by birth, now" come from Rome ; he was so civil as" to entertain us with great respect, hea- " ring we were English, for that he told"us he had been once in our coun- " try.... He came with great state with" his own bedstead and all the furniture, " yet would by no means suffer us to re- '' sign the room we had taken up in the" lodging before his arrival ". The si- lence of this little place, the bustle of acoloured Cardinal coming laden with bedsand things from one direction, meetingwith our plain Evelyn, coming bedlessfrom another; the one old, knowing Romeand most things else so well ; the otheryoung, and spruce and all so polite andand polished. I like it, for it reminds meof an unwritten chapter by Dumas.On goes Evelyn, and up to Radico- fani, 12 miles further to Acquapendente,down to the Lake of Bolsena, to Mon- tefiascone, to Viterbo. Then a rest, thenon to Capranica, and, arriving in Romeon Friday, November 4th., he enters it bythe Vatican gate " wet to the skinowing to a violent shower.Evelyn stayed at the house of Mon- sieur Petit (at 20 crowns a month), wentto bed, caused a good fire to be made,and so got dry. This house was near thePiazza Spagnola, or Piazza di Spagna,{shown below)where ' forestieri ' of notewere wont to lodge. It was here that Byron, Keats, de Brosses, and MonteCristo.... but I must not mix the real andthe fanciful... back to our Evelyn.The next morning he quickly getsacquainted with several English, Scotch,and Irish men who dwelt in Rome, andto whom he had brought letters of re- commendation. To Father John, superiorof the English college of Douay ; toMr. Patrick Cary, brother of Lord Falk- land ; to Dr. Bacon and Dr. Gibbs, aScotchman; to Father Courtney of theJesuit College, and my Lord of Somerset,from whom he received " instructions howto behave in town ", and all else hewished to learn.He engages a cicerone, to take himround, and on his second day, Sunday,November 6th., sees so much (recordingit all) that to anyone who has been inRome it is a wonder how he did it. Onthe day following he sees his first Thea- tre.... the Theatre Marcello :—" We" went into the Theatre of Marcellus," which would hold 80,000 persons," built by Augustus and dedicated to his" nephew; the architecture, from what" remains, appears to be inferior to none." It is now wholly converted into the" house of the Savelli, one of the old" Roman Families ".That which remained on November 7,1644, more or less remains now. ThePalace built in the Theatre and on it,now belongs to the Orsini family. Thesame day that Evelyn saw this old clas- sic masterpiece he went on to the Pa- lazzo Barberini designed by Cavaliero Ber- nini, went through it and somehow mis- sed seeing the Theatre in the Palacebuilt by Bernini in 1634. It must havelooked splendid, being then but ten yearsold, and one of the earliest of that shape. Still, on Saturday, November 19th., hehas this entry when alluding to the Bal- dacchino in St. Peter's. 44 It is the work" of Bernini, a Florentine sculptor, archi- " tect, painter, and poet, who, a little" time before my coming to the city, gave44 a public opera (for so they call shows44 of that kind) (*) wherein he painted the" scenes, cut the statues, invented the en- -44 gines, composed the music, writ the co- " medy, and built the theatre as, ofcourse, anyone will have to do in the fu- ture who would create a Drama all of apiece. Interesting to know it has alreadybeen done in 1644.On Tuesday, November 8, he comesacross something very closely related tothe Italian theatre, though not actually ina theatre. " This evening I was invited44 to hear rare music at the Chiesa Nova...." the tapers being lighted, one of the4' order preached; after him stepped up44 a child of eight or nine years old, who44 pronounced an oration with so much45 grace that I never was better pleased44 than to hear Italian so well and so in- -44 telligently spoken. This course it seems44 they frequently use, to bring their scho- -44 lars to a habit of speaking distinctly44 and forming their action and assurance,44 which none so much wants as ours in44 England. This being finished, began44 their Motettos, which, in a lofty cupola,44 richly painted, were sung by eunuchs44 and other rare voices, accompanied by44 theorboas harpischords, and viols, so44 that we were even ravished with the44 entertainment of the evening ". v) When in Rome, Evelyn does notseem to have noted down anything aboutthe Theatre built in the Vatican by Bra- mante in 1514, although it appears hepassed through it. It looks so untheatrical,maybe that is why, like someone well- dressed, it escaped observation.He went further south for a few weeks,but even in Naples does not speak of theTeatro dei Fiorintini, which, built in 1618,was renovated in 1707, and so was atEvelyn's service more especially since hewas there during the Carnival.He returned to Rome on Monday,February 13, 1645, and on the 17th.is invited, after dinner, to the Academyof the Humorists. 44 I was invited after44 dinner he writes to the Academy of44 the Humorists, kept in a spacious Hallbelonging to Signor Paolo Mancini, " where the wits of the towns meet on" certain days to recite poems, and de- " bate on several subjects. The first thatspeaks is called the Lord, and stands inan eminent place, and then the rest ofthe Virtuosi recite in order. By theseingenious exercises, besides the learneddiscourse, is the purity of the Italianlanguage daily improved. The room isbeing hung round with devices, or em- blems, with mottoes under them. There" are several other Academies of this na~" ture, bearing like fantastical titles. Inthis of the Humorists is the picture ofGuarini the famous author of the ' Pa- stor Fido ' , once of this society. Thechief part of the day we spent in hearingthe academic exercises ". ROME,FEBRUARY 17, 1645.I should say that actors, living atthis time in Italy, who wished to holdtheir own with an audience who went infor " these ingenious exercises \ and whodaily improved the Italian tongue ", musthave been rathdr fine speakers, and ratherexceptional in most other ways. I wellunderstand, after reading this passage in theDiary, how it was that the actress Isa- bella Andreini could speak many langua- ges, write sonnets, invent plays, and pensuch " letters " as she published in 1 588and 1607 and reprinted four times.... in1612, 1617, 1625 and 1634.One turns to Tarleton's Jest Book(161 1), and, however funny one may findsome of the jokes, it must be confessed theylack grace ; possibly owing to the factthat in England those " ingenious exer- cises " of speech did not daily improveour English tongue, and actors had there- fore less to keep them conscious of afine standard in the way of speech andcarriage : who knows ?On Saturday the 28th. of February,Evelyn goes out into the street to see what a Roman Carnival is like. "We were" taken up next morning in seeing the" impertinences of the Carnival, when all" the world are as mad at Rome as atother places ; but the most remarkable" were the three races of the Barbary" horses, that run in the Strada dell Corso" without riders, only having spurs so" placed on the backs, and hanging down" by their sides, as by their motion to" stimulate them ; then of mares, then of" asses, of buffaloes, naked men, old andyoung, and boys, and abundance ofidle ridiculous pastime. One thing is" remarkable, their acting comedies on a" stage placed on a cart or plaustrum,where the scene or tiring-place, is madeof boughs in a rural manner, which" they drive from street to street with a" yoke or two of oxen, after the ancient" guise. The streets swarm with prosti- tutes, buffoons, and all manner of rab- " ble ROME, FEBRUARY 28, 1645.Ademollo has a word to say on thispassage in the Diary (n) What comedies were acted, and whe- ther by professional actors or young col- lege students, whether it was a genuinesurvival of the ancient mode, or a " re- vival " like the Elizabethan Society orlike some " League of True Art ", orwhether merely a group of masqueraderspretending to be acting comedies, seemsvery uncertain.On May-day he goes to his first playsince his arrival in Italy, and curiouslyenough it is an English play. "We wereentertained at night with an Englishplay at the Jesuits where we before haddined ". The next evening he is at PrinceGalicano's palace. There he witnesses hisfirst Italian opera. The name he does notgive, but it was " Proserpina Rapita". PrinceGalicano composed the music and therewere present Cardinal Pamphilio, thePope's nephew, the Governors of Rome,Girolamo Lomellino of Rome, the Car- dinal's ambassadors, ladies, and a num- ber of nobility and strangers ". Oneof the ambassadors is De Valengoy. Eve- lyn calls it "a magnificent opera " andthere an end.There was also a Barriera that day.There had been in the morning a joustand tournament of several young gent- lemen on a formal defy, to which we had been invited ; the arizes being di- stributed by the ladies, after the knight- errantry way. The lancers and swords- men running at tilt against the barriers,with a great deal of clatter, but withoutany bloodshed, giving much diversion tothe spectators, and was new to us tra- " vellers ".And this well describes the playful- ness of a Barriera, performed, it seems,as often as not, in the great room of thePalace. The design by Sacchi (Plate 12)gives us the appearance of a Barriera inthe open air, but whether indoors or outdoors it was ever a formal ceremony wherethe arts of war were made amusing. Callothas engraved at least one such indoorsbarriera." A magnificent opera ' ', was allEvelyn wrote of the evening performance,and we may add a magnificent audience.This opera was performed in the privatetheatre of Prince Galicano ; it was not a12-foot stage with a proscenium, andsome footlights hired from the theatricaloutfitter in Rome (if such a farce of abusiness existed in those days) ; it was aspecially constructed " teatro " like thatin Parma in the Palazzo Farnese (1619) ;or like those in the court at Torino(1638); or in the Palazzo Barberiniin Rome (1634) ; or in the PalazzoDucale in Milano (1598); or like thosein Ferrara (1606-1612). As large asthe largest in Parma, it probably was not;nor so small as the Teatro in the CollegioRomano. Still " a magnificent operameans from Evelyn something, a greatdeal more than private theatricals. TheTheatres built for Princes in the first halfof the 17th. century were generally intheir palaces, not added on to them atone side as after-thought, and were finelydeveloped pieces of work. There wasno longer anything haphazard about them, nothing at all in the nature of makeshift.Already in 1545, Serlio had brought outhis second volume of Architecture in whichhe had clearly stated in words, and shownby diagrams, how a theatre should bebuilt, how a stage was to be constructed,and how the matter of scenes and lightingcould be dealt with. In 1614, Chiara- monte had written his book, to be pub- lished in 1675. &lt;°)And thus when F. Carini Motta comesout with his treatise on theatre buildingin 1676, thirty years before Evelyn'sdeath, the whole question has been prac- tically solved.I give a plan of a Court Theatre asconceived by Motta (Plate 13).So we must remember that the Thea- tres that Evelyn saw in 1644-46 wereno early improvised attempts to make thebest of a bad job, such as the Frenchand English architects were making at thattime, but buildings intended for a seriousand definite purpose; and that purposethe housing of Drama (both prose andlyric) in the very best possible way, ar- rived at without haste, without delays,without thought of cost: and without theopposition of that intolerable Puritanismwhich considers that all things, even faces,are best when plain.Before leaving Rome, Evelyn circlesround it like a bird ere it swings awayto its destination. He calls at the greathouse built for Cardinal Scipio Borgheseat Mondragone (Plate 1 1 fig. 1). "We went" hence to another house and garden not" far distant, on the side of a hill called" Mondragone, finished by Cardinal Sci- " pio Borghese, an ample and kingly edi- " fice. It kas a very long gallery, and at the end a theatre for pastimes, spaciouscourts, rare grots, vineyards, olive- grounds, groves and solitudes ". TIVOLI,FRIDAY MAY 5, 1645.Then at Tivoli in the Villa D'Estehe notes that most theatrical model " ofRome as it was in its beauty, of smallmodels, representing that city, with its" amphitheatres, naumachia, thermae, tem- " pies, etc. ".Thursday, May 18, 1645, Evelynleaves Rome. He goes through Capra- rola, dines there, and gets to Monti Rossi,20 miles from Rome ", by night; nextday is at Viterbo, dines there, and on toSt. Laurenzo; next day, Saturday the20th. at Radicofani and on to Turnera.On Sunday, the 21st., he is in Siena,where he dines ; then on to Pisa ; backto Leghorn, where he is obliged to gofor some money for the rest of the jour- ney. Then on to Lucca, where he stopsto note that ".... the inhabitants are excee- dingly civil to strangers, above all placesin Italy, and they speak the purest Ita- lian ". LUCCA. MAY 21st., 1645.And this every visitor to Lucca musthave discovered for himself. Even thePresident Dupaty in 1785 seems to havecome under the charm of these people.In Lucca he does not linger to noteanything about the theatre, although hecould have heard a musical Drama at thePalla Corda in the Palazzo dei Borghi.Nor does he stop for entertainment atany of the cities between Lucca and Venice.It is to Venice he hastens, and so we donot hear what he thought of the TeatroGustavillani, built by Seghizzi in 1640,a theatre with a new idea in it, an ideato be later adopted by the Bibiena family in the theatres in Verona and Mantua,and in the Falconi Theatre in Genoa, bysome Architect at present unknown.Still Evelyn does make one note on hisway to Venice. It is while stopping fora moment or two in Florence, that herecords the existence of the Ducal Thea- tre in the Palace which is now the Uf- fizi Gallery fa). " Then, passing the OldPalace, which has a very great hall forfeasts and comedies, the roof rarely pain- ted, and the side walls with six verylarge pictures representing battles, theworks of Gio. Vassari ". WThe best engraving to be found, show- ing this theatre, is the design by JacquesCallot (Plate 15).Now Evelyn quickens his pace. Offto Scarperia, up and over the Appenines,down to Fiorenzuola, that tiny little plea- sant town in the form of a cross; throughPianura, Scaragalismo, Loiano, and, after arest at Bologna, on to Ferrara, to Corbua byboat, past Chioza and Palestina and Ma- lamocca, and at last he is in Venice,where I am too, as I write this.The journey from Rome to Venice ",says he, " cost me seven pistoles andthirteen julios ". What a fine man this Evelyn is : would I were wealthy enoughto stop to reckon what my trip has cost.It is June when Evelyn arrives in thislovely place. This is no city, it is no ordina- ry thing related to anything else upon earth.It is just another world where thisworld seems not to have intruded, exceptwhen Bonaparte came and fell with allthe grace with which even a conquerorcould fall ; leaving the place as it was,unchanged, unaltered, so mysteriously po- werful is its spirit.I was looking to-day for some smallrecognition of Bonaparte's visit. I sup- pose I have not looked long enough.I imagine I shall find some little Venetianstatue raised to him in one of the littleside streets ; and some acknowledgement ofhis refraining from doing what every con- queror does elsewhere, stripping the place,burning, pillaging, ruining its beauty (s).About the sixth day after his arrivalin Venice, Evelyn is taken to a theatre,the Teatro Novissimo (0, and which, sinceit was built in 1641, was then but fouryears old, and therefore in superb condition.It was demolished in 1647, so it wasalways ' NovissimoThe opera " Ercole in Lidia " byConte M. Bisaccioni and Giov. Rovettais being performed, and Evelyn goes withLord Bruce, first Earl of Elgin.The details of this evening's entertain- ment are given in the Diary, and seemto have been enjoyable. " This night,having with my Lord Bruce fa) taken our " places before, we went to the Opera," where comedies and other plays are" represented in recitative music, by most" excellent musicians, vocal and instru- " mental, with variety of scenes painted" and contrived with no less art of per- '' spective, and machines for flying in the" air, and other wonderful motions ; ta- " ken together, it is one of the most mag- " nificent and expensive diversions the" wit of man can invent. The history" was ' Hercules in Lydia the scenes" changed thirteen times. The famous" voices, Anna Rencia, a Roman, andreputed the best treble of women ;" but there was an eunuch who, in my" opinion, surpassed her ; also a Genoese" that sang an incomparable bass. This" held us by the eyes and ears until twoin the morning, when we went to theGhetto de san Felice, to see the no- blemen and their ladies at basset, a" game at cards which is much used ;" but they play not in public, and all" that have an inclination to do it are in" masquerade, without speaking one word," and so they come in, play, lose orgain, and go away as they please." This time of licence is only in Carnivaland this Ascension Week ; neither are" their theatres open for that other mag- " nificence, or for ordinary comedians," save on these solemnities, they being a" frugal and wise people, and exact ob- " servers of all sumptuary laws'*. VENICE, ( )MAY-JUNE 1645.So much for Venice in 1645. Ve- nice in April, 1922 is, in such matters,rather different. On the walls are bigplacards announcing the great attraction atsome vast cinema hall: "Le Tre Illus- sioni: Illusione dell'oro, Illlusione dell'amore,Illusione della felicitaConceive the astonishment of any 1 7 th.century gentleman on coming to this cityof realized dreams, at being met withsuch a piece of sceptical audacity, suchawful fibs. For with all due respect tothe value of shadows, it is the light whichcreates them, and gold, love, and hap- piness are no illusions. The only illusionis the ass who finds them so. This or- dinary piece of knowledge was familiarto the Venetians in 1645, and why mo- dern Venetians should have found it amu- sing or necessary to spoil their city bybecoming sceptical like those who live inthe north east of Europe I cannot say.The liars who make money in this way(the cinema merchants are liars when theyplacard the towns with this rubbish) wouldin 1645 have been called before theCouncil of Ten and quietly removed in asack as dangerous to the Republic. Whynot to-day ? Why should we see nodanger in such fearful cynicism doled outto a credulous public, which is made topay and suffer for such wretched lies ?We do ", you say. Then why tole- rate it ? "It pays us ", you answer.Then Buona Notte "." The scenes changed thirteen times ",says Evelyn, and " this opera held usby the eyes and ears till two in the mor- ning ". Meantime in England, the Pro- tector Cromwell was preventing our stagefrom developing, while building ships withportraits of himself in wood at the prow,and a Fame holding the laurel wreathover his insulting head ; with the words" God with Us ". " Gott mit Uns ",then, is not so new after all, nor so German. He goes to Padua for a brief visit,and one day, " After dinner we walkedto the Palace of Foscari all' Arena, there" remaining yet some appearances of anancient theatre, though serving now for" a court only before the house PADUA1645.He now plies to and fro between Ve- nice and Padua. In Padua, he could haveseen the Teatro delle Stallone, the onlytheatre of the place built in 1642. Hewas thfre long enough, but it is quitelikely that, during his visit, nothing wasbeing performed. I can find no recordsof any performances at that Teatro be- tween 1642, and about 1651. Theoutside of the Theatre can be very cleailyseen in an engraving by Canaletto of LoStallone del Prato della Valle.January 20, 1646, is a Saturday, andSignor Francesco da Molin is electeddoge of Venice, and at Shrovetide Evelynslips over to Venice and witnesses threemore operas and other things, and oncemore hears his enchanting Anna Renciasing, and what is more, in true 1880style, asks her out to supper. One al- most sees an eyeglass, a top hat, andthe Gaiety Stage-Door.Here is Evelyn's entry. ".... The greatbanks are set up for those who willplay at basset ; the comedians haveliberty, and the operas are open ; witty" pasquils are thrown about, and themountebanks W have their stages atevery corner. The diversions which chieflytook me up was three noble operas, (y) where were excellent voices and music," the most celebrated of which was thefamous Anna Rencia O, whom we invited" to a fish-dinner after four days in Lent," when they had given over at the theatre.Accompanied with an eunuch whom shebrought with her, she entertained us withrare music, both of them singing to a har- " pischord. It growing late, a gentlemanof Venice came for her, to show herthe galleys, now ready to sail for Can- dia. This entertainment produced a se- " cond, given us by the English consulof the merchants, inviting us to his" house, where he had the Genoese, (xx)the most celebrated bass in Italy, who"was one of the late opera-band. This" diversion held us so late at night, that,conveying a gentlewoman who had sup- ped with us to her gondola at the usual" place of landing, we were shot at bytwo carbines from another gondola, in" which were a noble Venetian and hiscourtezan unwilling to be disturbed," which made us run in and fetch otherweapons, not knowing what the matterwas, till we were informed of the dan- " ger we might incur by pursuing it far- " ther PADUA. SHROVETIDE 1646.He leaves for Padua, after one lastglimpse of Venice, and then he makesfor home, going slowly through Vicenza,Verona and Brescia; avoiding Parma,Piacenza, Mantua, and that whole routefrom a fear of banditti, (for, even in1 646, ' every day, people say, there'sa robbery in the park "), making for Mi- lan in a roundabout way.And these banditti had no right torob us of the records Evelyn would have left us of the Teatro Farnese in Parma,and the Teatro di Corte in Mantua.Still, at Vicenza he halts to tell us aboutthe Teatro Olympico (Plate 1 6 figs. 1 &amp;2).But what he tells us is, alas, not quite asexact as usual. He is there on, or about,Tuesday, March 27th. "The next mor- " ning, we visited the theatre, as being ofthat kind the most perfect now standing," and built by Palladio, in exact imita- tion of the ancient Romans, and capa- ble of containing 5,000 spectators. Thescene, which is all of stone, representsan imperial city, the order Corinthian,decorated with statues. Over the Sce- " nario is inscribed, Virtuti GenioOlympior: Academia Theatrum hoc a" fundamentis erexit Paladio Architect:" 1584. The scene declines elevenfeet the soffito painted with clouds."To this there joins a spacious hall for" solemn days to ballott in, and a se- cond for the Academics ".Evelyn errs about this theatre builtby Palladio because, though he is givingmore time to Italy than Coryat gave, heis not giving quite enough time, nor payingquite enough attention to Vicenza. Inthis, he is courteous to me, for if he hadmade no mistakes, how could I show offmy scrap of wisdom ?He notes with precision little factsabout the basset playing, for he has giventime to it ; and he is correct about MissRencia (except for the way he spells hername) for he had paid her attention ; but,of the Teatro Olympico, he is incorrectin saying that it is " an exact imitationof the ancient Romans ", and that it cancontain " 5,000 spectators ", and thatthe scene is " all of stone ".It is an imitation of nothing, and al- though the works of Vitruvio have been well studied by Palladio, the Italian hasmade his theatre indoors, more than halfof it with wood and stucco, and hassomehow or other managed to avoid allthe essentials and most of the details of agood Roman theatre. The gradinata, orflight of steps on which the spectators sit,is taken from Serlio and others of thattime, who experimented in theatre buil- ding. The idea of separate chairs foreach spectator, and boxed-in places forgroups of four to eight, had not occur- red to anyone ; and in this, just so farand no further, is Palladio Roman. Thathe uses arches, pillars and statues to adornhis auditorium and stage, is no more Ro- man than Italian or Greek. What Iwould insist on is that Palladio did notset out to build a Roman theatre, but aPalladian theatre. Doubtless he spoke andwrote much of Vitruvio, but his wholeaim was to create afresh, as freshly aswas possible for him ; and he was sur- rounded by a large group of academi- cians obviously obsessed by the ancientsand their fine, but even then, dusty wayof doing things, doubtless forgetful of thepleasant trees and brooks, of Vicenza, andobsequious to the pushful princes of theyear 1560. So the pedants as usual haveruined another good thing. As for 5,000persons being able to sit and stand to seethe play, we can place the number at3,000.... and we shall still be on theside of those who want to prove it a lar- ger theatre than it i 5.... certainly largerthan it looks.The space it occupies is quite small,and the way in which the architect hasused every inch of his space is very re- markable.The scene is principally of wood,brick and stucco: very little stone is used.On the stage, we find stone up to thelevel of our hip, but this only in the proscenium. The seven streets shown inthe plan (Plate 16, fig. 2) are of woodand stucco. I speak after examining them.Patte, in 1830, writes in his " Storiae Descrizione " that " questo edificio none construtto alia leggiera, ma in pietrabella"; and Milizia, 1768, Filippi, 1860,and Signorelli, 1813, indeed, most writers,seem for some unknown reason to beagreed that the scene is of stone or mar- ble. This is all the more curious sinceMontenari, the best authority, had stated,in 1749, that " questa gradini nel Tea- tro Olympico non sono di pietra.... mason di legname.... le scene del nostraT eatro sono scene stabili disegnate inlegno e rilevate, e a vari colori di- pinte ". (zz) Evelyn then goes to Verona where" The first thing that engaged our atten- " tion and wonder, too, was the amphithea- " tre, which is the most entire of ancient" remains now extant. The inhabitants call"it the Arena : it has two porticos, onewithin the other, and is thirty four rodslong, twenty-two in breadth, with forty- two ranks of stone benches, or seats," which reach to the top. The vast- ness of the marble stones is stupendous.L. V. Flaminius, Consul., anno. urb.con. LIII. This I esteem to be one of" the noblest antiquities in Europe, it is sovast and entire, having escaped the ruin"of so many other public buildings forover 1400 yearsAnd now, in May, he comes to Mi- lan, which he speaks of as "a sweetplace " and which at this time contained 40,000 inhabitants. Here he sees anopera. " This afternoon ", he writes," we were wholly taken up in seeing an" opera represented by some Neapolitans,performed all in excellent music with rare" scenes, in which there acted a celebrated" beauty ".Now what was this opera, whereperformed, and who the beauty ? Of theplace, all 1 have been able to discover isthat at this time there were only three theatres. One was in the Ducal Palace,and one in the house of Messer AngeloLucchese in Via Rastelli and one in ahouse " degli Incarnatini " near PortaTosa. It is the actor Francesco Andreiniwho, in 1624, refers to this last theatrein his " Bravure del Capitano Spaventa ",(Venice).A plan of Milano (circa 1740), ofwhich plate 1 7 shows the central part ofthe city, marks clearly in the Ducal Palacetwo theatres; one for opera, that in ViaRastelli, the famous and well-known buil- ding of which some few rare engravingsexist ; the other, a smaller building at theother corner of the Palace and near theDuomo. According to Brozzi there wasalso a smaller court theatre (so they say)for plays in Via delle Ore, but I can findno visual proof of the existence of this smalltheatre. The first court theatre (whicheverone of these two it was), was built in 1598;I believe it to have been the smaller of thetwo. (Was this smaller built beforethe larger one ?) It was about sixty bracciasin length and about sixteen to twentybraccias wide. In 1 740 it was considereduseless, but it still stood and was even inplace in 1763. All the historians seemto have overlooked this theatre.To discover who was " the celebra- ted beauty ", we must enquire as to whatactress-singer was then living. IsabellaAndreini of the " Fideli " company died in1604 , so it could not have been she.In May, 1605, the company of the" Uniti " seem to have received permis- sion from Don Juan Fernandez de Vela- sco Condestable of Castaglia to performin Milan. In May, 1646, a like per- mission was granted to some company bythe same Condestable.In 1646, on Monday the 30th. ofApril, their actor Buffeto, and the actressDiana were in the state of Milan, passing with their baggage and four or five per- sons with them, through to Paris.Was Diana the " celebrated beauty "Let him who has any beauty to sparewaste twenty years hunting for what isabsolutely of no importance. 1 hear Evelyncalling, he is off, he is biddingfarewell to Italy.He is obliged to leave Milan ratherhurriedly, owing to an incident which hedescribes admirably, but which, as it hasnothing to do with the Theatre, I willnot linger behind to retell. He is off.I catch him up at Castellanza and wego sorrowfully out of this pleasant land,stopping but a moment or two at Arona,Isola Bella and Margazza ; where poorEvelyn, unable to get a horse, is obligedto straddle an ass, which he bridles witha valuable " Turkish bridle woven withsilk and curiously embossed with othersilk trappings "—a present from a gentle- man, a great horseman, in Milan.Thus mounted, he leaves Italy forever.But as you will see when he reachesParis and London, and is obliged to listento singing and to look at acting in theseplaces, he is always well-nigh silent.... Itwas so beautiful in Rome, and in Venicemore beautiful still: the fine Italian speechat the Umoristi in Roma.... the noble operain Venezia.... the voice of Anna Rencia....he seems to be thinking of all these ashe goes upward out of Italy into themountains on the caparisoned ass.To be continued (a) Well, to be strict to history there was a largefamily called Polo in Venice; so he could be one ofthese ; a Mr. Polo, but Mr Pule, never.(b) 1 have read his Diary and I find it not readable*Yet how vastly more popular than Evelyn's. (c) 44 One day wnen I (Benvenuto Cellini) was aboutfive years old, my father was sitting in a ground-floorroom of ours in which washing had been going on,and where a large fire of oak logs had been left. Gio- vanni, his viola on his arm, was playing and singing byhimself near the fire, for it was very cold. Looking intothe fire, he chanced to see in the middle of the most ar- dent flames, a litttle creature like a lizard disporting him- self in the midst of the intensest heat. Suddenly awareof what it was, he called my sister and me and pointedit out to us children. Then he gave me a sound box onthe ears, which made me cry bitterly, at which he soothedme with kind words, saying 4 Carina mio, I do not hurtyou for any harm you had done ; but only that you mightremember that lizard in the fire there is a Salamander,which has never been seen for a certainty by anyone be- fore. Then he kissed me and gave me some farthings44 Vita di Benvenuto Cellini (d) He had not yet seen the " real one in Romeand so it is likely that he only reports what he is told byhis guide.

(g) Perhaps The Count de Laincourt should be put downas eccentric because he finds pleasure in having such thingsas marionnettes in his palace. Magnin, the historian, tellsus that the Due de Guise, in 1650, had such little figuresin his chateau at Meudon ; that Charles V had them inthe monastery of Saint Justin ; that Mme. la Duchesse deBerry, in 1713, had them at Versailles; the Duchesse duMaine, in 1705, at Sceaux ; Voltaire at Cirey had themand wrote for them ; Cosimo I cf Florence at the Pa- lazzo Vecchio and Francesco I at the Uffizi enjoy thesespectacles; Lorenzo de' Medici too. The long list of la- dies and gentlemen who have understood these beings isunending. Charles Perrault (1628-1703) in his 44 Contede Peau d'Ane " writes ;Pour mot, fose poser en faitQiden de certains mom ens Vesprit le plus parfaitPent aimer sans rougir jusqu'aux marionnettes,Et quHl est des temps et des lieuxOil le grave et le serieuxNe valent pas d'agreables sorneties.and 44 an entire day " writes Girolamo Cardan, the cele- brated mathematician and physician, (1550) 44 would not besufficient in which to describe these puppets that psay,fight, shoot, dance and make music; while BernadinoBaldi in 1575 pens a sonnet to Urbin the great mathe- matician who loved them, wherein he praises the puppets.By ail this we see that Puppets of distinction were disco- vered before 1923. (h) 1644. This is by no means an early record, foreven in England, in 1573, Italian marionnettes or pupazziestablished themselves in London, and the Lord Mayorauthorizes them to 44 be allowed to settle in the city andto carry on their strange motions, as in the past and fromtime immemorial And can't one see and hear the eagerItalian, as he applies for a licence, whispering to the LordMayor's secretary, saying, 44 Tell him, Signer, tell him thatsince Gesii Cristo, nay even since the Padre Eterno him- self, this noble company of little people have praised thecreation. Tell him that the Pope in Roma sanctions mycousin's marionnettes... and his are not a patch on mine.Tell him this "....

" 44 Yes, it's rather strange of a Pope....5ti11.... " and he signs, and rather happily smiles as he signs.The secretary returns to the Showman in two momentswith a charter. (i) The name of this actor is sometimes incorrectlyspelt and this brings to the student a large slice of trouble.There were two other actors of Italy born in Napoli andwho wrote their names FIORILLO. Our actor's name isspelt FIORILLI.Maurice Sand for no known reason misspelt it asFIURELLI, and H. Maynard Smith, Andrew de Ternant,Alladice Nicoll, J. A. Symonds and M. Moland makethe same error.On the other hand those who spell it correctly are;Co3tantini (1695); F. Bartoli (1701); Campardon (1871);A. Bartoli (1880); Pougin (1885); Rasi (1897); Mant- zius (1903); Toldo (1910); and Tonelli (1924).On seeing a document signed by this Actor in 5667on March 25th, and noting that he too spells his nameletter for letter as do these nine authorities, our opinion ofthem as careful Historians is not weakened.M. Andrew de Ternant was so particular, recently, to* correct' a correspondant in " Notes and Queries , sayingthat Fiorilli's name must be spelt Fiurilli that these fewwords will not be amiss. (For Fiorilli s portrait see Plate 9). (j) Such operas had not yet been seen or heard inEngland, and it is not until thirty years later on January 5,1674, that Evelyn, then 54 years of age, reports the arri- val of the first Italian opera in England. (k) For a view of this Teatro Marcello see " TheMask M Vol 10, No. 1, page 17. (*) See Siena, pag, 104.(1) " Which none so much wants as ours in En- gland wrote Evelyn on Nov. 8, 1644. Which noneso much wants as ours in England, I echo to-day.And why not get what we so much need, all will surelyask ? I have written elsewhere of this. I am preparinga small book about those colleges wherein so many youngprinces and even those less highly born, were trained toact, to speak, to carry themselves, to achieve the assurance which Evelyn speaks of. These colleges contained thea- tres, real theatres. They did not fear the theatre in thosedays. It would seem they understood some of its values,one of which is to train young men who will have to takepart in the play of Public life how to stand, move andspeak before a public like Princes.(m) About the year 1600, some beaux esprits, whoassisted at the marriage of Paolo Lucio Mancini, a Romangentleman, exercised their wit, in the course of the eve- ning, in composing sonnets and epigrammatic verses, on theladies who were present. Pleased with this amusementMancini, a man of learning and of taste, invited his gueststo a further exercise of their talents. Regular meetingswere now established, and the plan of amusement exten- ded. Though the hasty ebullitions of wit were not sup- pressed or discouraged, the members, says Muratori, chieflydevoted themselves to the composition and recital of beau- tiful and ingenious (" vaghe ed ingegnosi ") comedies.At these *' merry meetings " all the principal nobility andgentry of Rome attended. The fame of the academyspread, and the associates were universally denominated" i begli umori ". This name was afterwards changed intothat of Umoristi or Humorists, on the theatrical exhibitionsgiving place to the recitations of poetical compositionson various subjects. The sala, or spacious apartment inwhich these meetings were held, still existed in the timeof Muratori, decorated with the arms of the principal mem- bers. Tassoni, a distinguished associate, thus immortalisesthis academy in the eleventh canto of his Secchio Rapita :Sped! il corriere a Gaspar SalvianiDecan de Faccademia de* Mancini." Historical Memoir of Italian Tragedy " JosephCooper Walker, (1798). Pages 158-159.What 44 i begli umori " means Mr. Walker doesnot explain. (n) Passing over ihe whole of the sixteenth century,we find another experiment, also in the open air, at thebeginning of the following century. In fact, while Riario'smusic, sung in the open air or in an enclosed place, had ascenic setting, this second one has for theatre a car whichmoves from one piazza to another. The invention is dueto Pietro Delia Valle, a celebrated traveller, artist andman of learning, and perhaps also the author of the poem,who in his well known letter of the 16th January 1640to Lelio Guidiccioni speaks in the following terms of themusical composition, the work of Paolo Quagliati, and ofthe performance given of it in the Carnival of 1606;" And in regard to the music of my Car composedby Quagliati for the most part in my room, according ashe saw it pleased me, with which I went out in mask inthe Carnival of the year 1606. And it was one of thefirst actions (so to speak) performed in music to be heardin Rome. Although there did not take part more than fivevoices and five instruments, just so many as, in a movingchoir, could have place, they did not for this reason singonly one at a time, but the personages sang now alone, nowtwo together, now three, and, at the end, five, which pro- duced a very fine effect; and the music of that song, asmay be seen in the printed volumes in circulation, althoughthe greater part was composed in such manner as to berepresented, was not altogether of that simple and over- trivial recitative style which many use, and which soonbecomes tiresome to the audience; but was adorned and full of grace with charm, without departing at all from anelevated and studied manner of representation, so that itpleased extremely; and this could be well seen by theconcourse of almost the whole city which followed it; andit not only never wearied the hearers, but many of themwished to hear it four or six times, and there were somewho followed it always to all the ten or twelve placeswhere the singing went on from twenty-four o'clock (J)until after midnight.It is known that the use of these theatrical cars con- tinued in Rome. The Englishman John Evelyn, who washere in 1645, that is forty years after the car of PietroDelia Valle, tells in his Memoirs of having seen them, anddescribes them: 44 On the car or plaustrum the scene isformed by branches rustically disposed* and these ambulanttheatres go about the streets drawn by two or four oxen."A.

Although Furtenbach isthe earlier of the two, he is, I think, merely repeatingwhat is known in Italy for some years. I think Sabbattiniis probably more important. (p) " Farewell, Lucca 1 Adieu to M.

Compare the two designs, figs. 1 &amp; 2Plate 16. Palladio thinks too long about it all andarrives at less than Buontalenti achieves; and look howmuch Callot adds to the whole movement towards theatreconstruction. By this one etching, I find Callot does moreto bring about the modern horse-shoe form than anyone else.How valuable is a little touch of inspiration ! and here comesCallot into the Medician theatre in 1616, and, seeing thatthe people curve the floor to make room for the performers,he emphasises this fine curve, and fixes it once and for allin a lovely etching with such a way about it that everyonebuys a copy. It is in 1616, and slowly it enters thebrains of the architects that exactly this curve is prettyfine; and for good or ill they follow the lines of theetching in their future ground plans, the first being 1627in Bologna so far as I have been able to trace the thing,and the second—in Rome—at the Tordinona Theatre in1671—Specchi the architect.(r) J found none while I was there ; but I find it exis- ted, or exists some where, recorded in the History of Italy. (s) I am reminded that he carried off a gold horseor two: but compare Ypres for what he might havedone : or Paris itself in 1871-2.(t) Galvani tells us that we must not confound thisTeatro Novissimo with another theatre of the same name builtentirely of wood. This one which Evelyn went to was alsoknown as the Teatro della Cavallerizza ; Tassini says itwas built in 1640.(u) It was another Lord Bruce who in 1827 collectedfor Ebers of the King's Theatre a number of dancers inParis for the London Ballet; so the Bruces seem to havebeen fond of theatricals. (*) It is Evelyn who writes 41 Venice " instead ofVenezia, and 44 Padua 44 Rome " and 44 Florence " in- stead of 44 Padova 44 Roma " and 44 Firenze so in thisessay we have followed the Englishman's spelling so as tosave confusion.

The theatres which are open in 1645 are theTeatro San Cassiano, Teatro SS. Giovanni e Paolo, andthe Teatro Novissimo. The theatres which are open in 1646are the Teatro SS. Giovanni e Paolo, and the Teatro No- vissimo. (z) A writer in " Notes and Queries (1922) tells usthat four years later, (1650) Anna Rencia married Ales- sandro Leardini, d'Urbino ".

I was standing under the immense portico ofthe Teatro Carlo Felice (a) in Genova, heldup by its great marble pillars from Carrara.What is it that is so good about this,...what is this sense of space and loftiness worth?to me something I will not attempt to explainbecause already sufficiently explained by greatpoets for some several hundred years. But toothers ? To a hundred, say even three hundredwho will be passing under this portico betweenthis evening and tomorrow midday and it isa public way this sense of the lofty lines andthe space within the lines may count; ....to nomore. And certainly not to those three gen- tlemen who are now passing me. Three mer- chants,... an automobile manufacturer, a tyre- maker, and a cloth merchant.Three able men with every excellent qualityand quite without a scrap of imagination. Menwho are useful, ....and there an end.Born to be employed, to be told what todo and to carry out a difficult order admirably,they have by some odd trick of chance come tobe giving the orders and others put to the executionof 'em. And these three big able fellows receivenot the least impression as they pass along underthis portico, between these mighty pillars.When it comes to them deciding upon thebuilding of the new Theatre next year ....orwhenever the hour arrives.... they will have nothought of pillars with them; and if the architectemployed (and a mild one will be set on tothat work, no architect of power and value being known to them or they to him), ....ifthis mild architect should dream* of suggestingsome big pillars, these will be cut outNo money for pillars; no space for pillars; nosense in pillars.But no sense for pillars would be morecorrect.Now it seemed to me as I stood there that,if only a sound commercial reason could befound for the use of pillars once more, the ar- chitecture could be saved.I went nearer to one of the pillars. Andit seemed to me, as I looked at it, that I hadfound the right use and away to convinceone of the three merchants that it would payhim and Well —to insist on pillars.For who but a rich merchant would payfor such useless things as pillars ?But a rich merchant is no tool. He wouldwant to see money in the pillars. I wouldshow him money and more. —As he is ahuman being I would show that these pillars,besides paying him all the year round, wouldpay his sons and his sons' sons, provided theycept at the business.He would have to be a motor tyre manu- facturer.And this is what I should say as I led himup to a full-sized model of the pillars to be: I would say, 51 See there, close to yourboots 11; he would look down 11 a pneu- matic tyre lying down and a fluted columnstanding on it. I intend to engrave the wordsBRIGHT'S UN-SLIP-ABLE TYRES around this bul- ging bit, -....the architects call it by the sillyname of Torus.On the fluted column would be added yearby year a mark cut in the marble. "Uphere indicating where his knee came would be a mark cut and the words " 33,000,000 tyreswere made and sold from the day this column waserected, until now, January MDCCCCXXVII".These words would be engraved in largeRoman letters.Further up, some two feet or so, and afterfour years had passed, would come a secondsuch mark and also cut the Roman letters say- ing " 48,237,202 more tyres were sold byJanuary MDCCCCXXXIIIProbably things would have advanced in theworld in those four years and we should beinclined to add " signed Josephus Bright ". Andat each succeeding four to six years a newrecord would be cut in the pillar.In 150 years the pillar would be full andwe would commence on pillar No. 2 at theother side of the collonade.Thus, while the firm lasted, an eternal ad- vertisement would be rising, living art indeed,before the population ; and, when the firmended, and the ages had rolled by, some ar- cheologist would come along and read the writingand declare that the words signified most importantevents in the reigns of King George and hisSuccessors.This is the sole chance I see for theatresto be erected in this age on a grand scale, andwith pillars, by famous merchants of our day.

YESTERDAY I was present at arepresentation of the opera Pal- mira, which, taken as a whole, wasvery well and properly given.What especially pleased me was thatI had a good opportunity of examiningone part of it most thoroughly, namely,the scenery ; it is the work of a Mila- nese, Fuentes by name, who is atpresent living here.The great difficulty as regards scenicarchitecture is that one must have aknowledge of the principles of genuinearchitecture and yet be able to deviatefrom them in order to attain the endin view.Architecture, in the higher sense,ought to have an earnest, lofty, andsteadfast character and expression—itcan scarcely attend to what is gracefulwithout becoming weak—and yet uponthe stage everything has to present agraceful appearance. Theatrical archi- tecture should be light, ornamental, andvaried, and yet should at the same timerepresent the gorgeous, the lofty, andthe noble. The decorations, especiallyof the background, ought in fact to betableaux ; the scene-painter has to goa step further than the landscape-pain- ter, who must also understand how tomodify architecture according to hisrequirements,The scenic decorations to Palmirafurnish instances from which the rulesof scene painting might be deduced ;there are six scenes which follow oneanother in two acts without any singleone being repeated ; they are designedwith judicious variety and gradation.One sees from them that the artistis acquainted with all the resourcesof genuine architecture, even when hebuilds as never would or should bebuilt ; everything retains the semblanceof possibility, and all his constructionsare based upon the idea of what isdemanded by reality. His ornamentationsare very rich, but applied and distri- buted with genuine taste.In the case of the artist in ques- tion we have an example of the greatstucco-school which exists in Milan,and of which a knowledge can be gotfrom the prints of Alberiolli. Allproportions tend to what is slender, asdo likewise all the figures, statues, bas- reliefs, and painted lookers-on ; theexcessive length and powerful gesturesof many of the figures are not meremannerism, but have been required tobe thus by necessity and taste. Thecolouring is faultless, and the style or ik'.L.ibtaaii'Se ap.V«Se It. trivances, ail the charms of masses ar- ranged according to tne different points of direction. The several parts are perfectly distinct and clear without being hard, and the whole is most admirably consistent. One perceives in the endless details the result of the studies of a great school and the knowledge which has been acquired by several generations of men, and it may doubtless be said that this style of Art is here brought to its highest Sb »d .hatehu'S is despaired of 0). 1 will see that what 1 have here given as a mere hurried sketch shall be arranged and worked out in a better manner.

THE Theatre is CHEAP. It is still ascheap today as it was in 1900 althoughgreat efforts have been made by many theatreworkmen to make their work finer.To restore values great changes are morenecessary than ever. But great changes.It is not a small defect, this cheapness ofTheatrical work.Theatrical work can be and shall be asfine in quality as any other work ; but to makeit so we must look quick about it and lay ourplans to that end. Too many of the newyoung critics with their emotional outpouringsabout the work their gush about Bernhardtand Marie Lloyd and a half-dozen fairly goodperformers help to cheapen what is quitecheap enough as it is.You disdain the lead given you by thebest brains in the Theatre and are happy andhonoured to act the page to an actress ; youcarry her long tail with a certain page-likemock dignity.Carry it by all means one hour more:don't drop it; but do clear off the stage andthat rapidly.Make room for men younger than you canever be; men who have not been brought up onwhat Giuliotti calls " cristianesimo coldcream".You are not well, it seems. You take thingseasily as though you were tired : as you pos- sibly are. Make room then for men who arenot tired.Your standard of theatrical art is thelowest: you are still in the gushing stage.If you have no convictions that is really notat all surprising, for you are far too cleverto have any.The actors too. The playwrights, thescenic men, with some rare exceptions, allare cheapening the work seen on the stage.As the standard set by Irving is no longerbefore you, you can easily afford to praisehim (or rather yourselves for your venerationof and affection for him), while doing workthe quality of which he would have consideredeighth-rate. As for any higher standard thanthat set by Irving let us say Shakespeare'sown standard you seem unaware of itsexistence. If the values of the stage matter at all toyou, if it matters what is performed and howit be performed, make this more evident.What seems to matter more to you is yourpercentages and salaries. Authors, actors, cri- tics are all alike in this : all but a handful.THEN it is to the handful that we addressourselves. Trundle the others off theboards we beg of you : have no further dea- lings with them and prevent the stage beingcheapened.You are not making way: you are notpushing the cheapeners out sufficiently firmly:some of you say your say: we have heardyou : you show courage and often. The mostcourage is shown by the women. But nowyou must begin to do something. You areunhappy about the way things are going. Butwhat can you do? you ask.You can, to begin with, entirely changethe stage. That to begin with.Of the drama we do not speak.... but ofthe stage. You think it an overwhelmingtask, and yet we know you to be courageous.We will tell you where we think you failand what you could do to begin things seriously.Unite and follow your leaders.Do not huddle one on the heels of theothers, all talking, all eager to show courage,and what you each can do. No one doubtsthat you possess spirit and talent. But youmust show what they are worth. Not by rushingon but by steadily holding back.Allow one man to speak for you; backhis word; do as he says ; follow his lead ;and keep following it and be steady. Thenyou will win; then you will restore to thestage its old values.And if you like " The Mask " will giveyou that lead. But " The Mask " cannotdrag you on.When men of purpose, even it they lackan objective, unite, it denotes at any rate thatseriousness, without which, no changes can bemade, no values restored, no cheapness drivenaway.United to some serious end, be it what- ever it may, and a leader chosen, you willthen see how serious you all are, and howunited.The first thing you should refuse to dowould make it clear that you are still the oldgang. It's not gangs the European and Ame- ncan Theatres need any more: it is two unitedbodies of men that are needed, Europeanand American.Do you doubt it ? and you harrassed, per- plexed month by month about the work. Howmany are the insoluble puzzles. Never doyou take part in a production but up glidesix or seven puzzles and begin to strangle you.TWO moments' pause to say we are not spea- king to any but artists be they dra- matists, actors, stage managers, scenic menand the best assistants in the staffs.WE are not tired are you ?When in 1908 we began to speak aboutthese things, these perplexing obstructions whichlittered the way towards a new Theatre, wedid not mean that they were mere trifles tobe solved by a hundred more productionsdone a bit better. You have done many pro- ductions and done them more than a bitbetter.Do you suppose we did not credit you withthat amount of ability ? Believe us, we knewquite well how brilliant you could be.But that is not the point.That was not what was either doubtedor counted on. And we think you have cometo see now that after a ten years' fling atTheatricals you are just where you were withsome ten years' experience added.Since you were willing to listen to us welong ago suggested more steadiness.But there you did not quite follow us.After these ten years we again suggest thesame thing more steadiness,What do we mean ? we will attempt totell you.When a dangerous thing is undertaken bya large group of men say the overthrowof tyrannical usurpers of power, (call themwhat you will, communists, anarchists, aristo- crats, plutocrats or any other name whichexpresses what you consider tyranny) and thereestablishment of order and- a fair chance toanyone who has something in him, this largegroup of men allow themselves to be led :they follow the more serious and more capable,who, in turn, elect and follow a leader.No one acts for himself because he knowsthat to do so may imperil the safety of theothers.That is what is being steady. They work, they advance, together. Werethey to advance singly each one would bebefore long dragged down, as (with sorrow,but without mincing matters) we assert youhave been dragged down.You will be dragged down and draggedright in to the old and false order of Theatreconditions if you cannot stop what you arenow doing and look around you.What was it you wanted ?A new Theatre wasn't it ?What is it you've achieved ?This. You have done what we did: broughtideas into the old Theatre ; these have beenconsiderably cut, trimmed, recut, altered inshape, feeling, purpose, all: some remnantof what you dreamed has been preserved....and that remnant has been hailed by themoney-makers and the stalls and boxes anddress circles as glorious. We have heard themtalking, these people who do not care. Wher- ever we have been strangers have come to ustelling us of how marvellous, how amazingan artist you are.We know what you thought,We knew what had happened to yourideas, your work, your most ordinary practicalsuggestions.It would have been useless to tell thesemouthy and excited nincompoops what wethought.You were over in America or in Berlinor Paris or in our own London: until wecould get once more into touch with you wecould barely even convey to you the upper- most thoughts about all these doings and chat- terings; until we could actually see and speakwith you we could not come to anything worthwhile.That is where we are n0w.... and evenhere .... although this shall reach you somehow.And yet how, when you read this, will youeven then come to know what we mean bysteadiness ?We cannot give the show away in frontof the audience.But there is away to begin. You ineach of these lands are able to get togetherand know one another. You can actuallytalk together.And there is such a thing as the telegraphand the post.We write for and to you month by monthand have done so for ten years now, or lon- ger. But we hear too seldom from you.Though we hear from people far and nearthat does not mean that we hear from enough.Moreover, we not only want to hear: wewant to see things done.They are not being done so far as we can see.We see, let us say, X.... beaten down atBergamo. Why? Solely because, while unitedto us all by all the ties we artists understand,there is no practical clearly defined unity." What, an organized unity; is that whatyou propose ?" Assuredly "." But what about ' sack the organizers ',stop organizing create " in Volume 9 of " TheMask "?On which let us have a word.First of all didn't you find " sack the or- ganizers " good fun? Mustn't we keep thefun going anyhow. We thought the suggestionin " The Mask " to sack the people whosack us quite in style. No?And as for stopping organizing, by that wesurely took " The Mask " to be addressingthe incompetents who are always organizinglittle societies amateur companies LittleTheatres little journals and the rest.That they should stop all that and get tothe difficult task of pronouncing vowels cor- rectly, and drawing straight lines, wouldmean for them the nearest possible thing tocreating something someday.But " The Mask " does not address itselfto the same type of man all the time. It isright we suppose in believing that you willknow when and where you are addressed.As you are here. You the artists, andnone others yet.And to you most assuredly and most se- riously we suggest that plans for a genuine or- ganization be prepared without any delaywhatever, and without any haste.An organization to what end?First of all to unite us all.Secondly to bring us all together.Thirdly to chose our leaders.Fourthly, to follow these.And this will bring us the new Theatre ?Assuredly not.But it will bring us it.€J We are all a strange group of con- trary natures, opinions and gifts.These could be better combined than theyare now. There are the so-called Idealists whowant the Kingdom of Heaven at a blowso they are described by the good Barker.Then there is Appia; there is Stani- slawsky and his company; there is Reinhardtand his group; Gessner and his; your Ame- rican groups, the Guild, Equity, and theothers: the Italian groups, (for the moment weare not including playwriters, not out of anydisrespect but for practical reasons). Then inRussia the Kamerny company: then IsadoraDuncan, Yvette Guilbert, our two great ladies,.... the only two great ladies still in thefield.(We have been slow or we would dearlyhave loved we could say three. Cannot youaid us that no more time be lost!).Then there is the admirable Copeau and hisgroup. And others are to be found in Paris....not Frenchmen. And in Switzerland andGermany not a few; in Holland too ; and inIreland of course.Who knows may be in old Scotland.Of England we will not speak, except toname Barker and Poel, in passing; andthey are not at work. If men of spirit existin the work which the rest of us have alreadyproved we are devoted to, we see none in En- gland.... We hear none. We see and hear toomuch denial there.IS that too sharp ? Some day we may tell you the story of avisit paid by one of us to London and ofactors spoken with.England can and may any day reassert itscapacity to see and speak.... to hear andspeak.... to not avoid all tasks. At presentmen we thought able to express something, andmore able to attempt difficult things, all shirkthese and become humdrum and are forcedto agree with the moderates who wish onlyto pull them well down, net them, and renderthem useless.The Old Vic ?... well, we don't respondto the Old Vic for we have never heard froman Old Vic-ite or seen one. Were we tosee their work doubtless we could valueit. Would the Old Vic ally itself to anyoneor anything for the sake of the Cause we allhave at heart a New Theatre?And now lest we too easily poohpoohthis same Old Vic, what of the others?Of you first, then of Appia, of Isadora, of Yvette, of Stanislawsky, Reinhardt; do yousee all these uniting?" We'll say neither Bo nor Ba " as the Manfrom Gotham put it, but we leave it to you.But what we will venture to say and repeatlest there remain a doubt, is, that until thesecan unite, and until we all can unite, nothingserious can be done; nothing valuable canbe restored or added to the old Theatre no New Theatre can possibly come to exist. TWO AMERICANTHEATRE MAGAZINES."THE THEATRE MAGAZINE"THE THEATRE ARTS MONTHLY BY JOHN SEMAR GIUSEPPA CORTESIFROM A PORTRAIT ENGRAVED BY OLDANI.In the History of the Stage La Cortesi figures as a dancer of incomparable merit. AMERICA has made immense efforts theselast ten years, to shake itself free fromthe humbug which prevents the developmentof its Theatre,—that humbug which resemblesthe European growth as one ear of the assis like the other ear.And if certain centres like New York keepus only too well informed that the humbug inthat city is as prominent as ever it was, this isdue in great measure to the admirable TheatreMagazine edited by Mr Hornblow, numberone of the two above-named publications.Those of our readers who know the" Theatre Magazine " with its photographicdisplay of Moeller or Morgan dancers, knowthat the " Theatre Magazine " is quite sincerein its protests against " Obscene BroadwayShows which must stop ". These protests ap- pear regularly in its columns.It is not to be doubted for a moment butthat Messrs Meyers's handsomely printed Ma- gazine is all for good : all for good art; allfor the best artists.No one could possibly assert that it is outto make money; that its desire is not to getthings better.The very covers themselves demonstratethe fact of this aim and the precise extent ofachievement.The December number for 1923 is be- fore us. Could anyone say that the pictureof the girl on the cover in what appears tobe three to five colours is anything but thevery highest art? We ask? Its healthiness"isapparent, is it not ? Added to this it is a dis- tinguished piece of colour-printing: or are wemistaken ?Yet someone only yesterday picked upthis journal and ridiculed the whole thing be- ginning with these smooth coloured covers,saying that it was a tenth-rate affair from everypoint of view.Yet what are its contents ? Let us turnthe pages.To begin with it consists of 76 pages.Of these some 51 are filled with letter-pressand photographs and a few sketches ; nearlyall the rest are advertisements. Now 30 pagesof advertisements out of 76 pages of maga- zine leaves not a bad balance.The odd 50 pages contain six leadingarticles.1. The Sewer on the Stage.2. What we are looking for, by FourTheatrical Managers.3. In Search of an American Siddons.4. Vices and Virtues of the AmericanTheatre.5. Broadway's King of the Chorus.6. Ballyhooing the Burlesque Business." The Sewer of the Stage" by MrSumner is written with the direct purpose ofuplifting the City of New York, and pro- tests very forcibly against the plays which theNew York managers, we suppose, are produ- cing, and which have received good noticesin the New York journals and possibly inMessrs Meyers's " Theatre Magazine ".It protests no less forcibly against " picturesof half naked stage beauties" which thenewspapers and magazines print. This is onpage 9. On the page facing this, page 8,is a large page reproduction of "The Graces",four girls certainly half naked, four membersof the Moeller Dancers.So here you see the tendency of the ma- gazine. It is obviously to give an illustra- tion of the very thing Mr Sumner protestsagainst, so as to show that he is quite cor- rect in what he asserts.The next article is written by Mr Belasco,Mr Woods, Mr Miller and Mr Hopkins,four celebrated managers of New York Thea- tres. They say what they are looking for. Mr Belasco, the doyen of the Managers,says he is looking for plays, and admits that,while he is " generally engaged in writing aplay " of his own, he also " assists by advicea number of young writers who submit ideasor plots " which impress him " as capable ofdevelopment into good plays". That's allright. It's what Shakespeare did, and mostother playwriters dislike doing. It's whatDumas did. He adds that he always triesto get " material adapted to the special re- quirements " of his star performers.This he admits is why he has to do somuch altering, He winds up by saying thatit is often an artistic joy to him to indulgehimself and put on a play which wont pay.Mr Belasco is well known, has done goodwork, is a picturesque figure, and to knowwhat he is looking for is satisfactory.Mr A. H. Woods is on the other handunknown to us of " The Mask ". Yet hisfirst sentence helps us to know him a little." I have no sympathy for or interest in aspi- ring playwrights or aspiring anything". It'sbadly put, but it's modest." I want plays that interest me " he goeson. What sounder common sense ? Andthere are people not alone in Europe but inthe States who assert that American theatricalmanagers have too refined senses and notenough hard-headed practicality." I am receptive to the emotion thescript can give me "; this is his third state- ment : adding, " I bought (by wire) " KickIn " on the strength of a fifty word scenariosent me from Los Angeles "—which seemsby every rule of the game to breathe commonsense."I bought 'A Voice in the Dark' thesame way. The telegram in this case didnot even give me the complete scenario; itmerely suggested an idea which I thoughtnovel enough to take a- chance on ".The future of the American Drama seemsassured if only more such managers as MrA. H. Woods can come into power.Mr Gilbert Miller is the next to step for- ward and gives away the secret of what hewishes, what he is " looking for "." I do not know that 1 can truthfully sayat any one time that I am looking for anyone or any several certain things ".Now at the first glance we recognizeMr Miller to be a careful man. He'll con- fess right and good to what he's not look- ing for.And he is positive that he has " a weak- ness " for the English language. Yet withhis genius for being careful he quickly makesit clear that his strength lies in his interest• J f X Tfor " American Plays for America . Verycautiously he comes in his very last line toconfess, that if (our under-line) he is " look- ing for anything, it is [for association withmore such capital native penmen as Richman,Hopwood and Field ".Next, Mr Arthur Hopkins.He says more or less what Mr Woodssaid. But he seems to say that he has sym- pathy for aspirations (whereas Mr Woodssays he hasn't any), because, says Mr Hop- kins, he has more than a mere desire tomake money."My primary reason for putting on anyplay is that 1 like it so much 1 want to seeit on the stageBut after reading carefully these four re- plies to the question " What are you look- ing for ? " we find that not a single practicalanswer has been given.We must admit that it is Mr Woods,hitherto unknown to us, whose replies pleaseus the most. This apparently quite scepticalman with his easy way of buying playsby telegraph, strikes a rash note we ratherlike.Cjf But to the consideration of the restof this " Theatre Magazine ".Leading Article 3 states that someone is" In Search of an American Siddons ". Itcan't be Mr Belasco, Mr Woods, Mr Milleror Mr Hopkins or they would have said so.Who is it then that is looking for a fig ona thistle or a thistle on a figtree ?The author proceeds to say that MrsFiske, Miss Anglin and Miss Le Gallienneare none of them Mrs Siddons, but are very goodactresses ; and what a good actress Miss Mar- lowe was;—and how Miss O'Neil flirted withfame—and how Miss Keane's chances werespoiled—and charming Miss This and deli- cious Miss Tother were all right but no good" for the future Of Miss Menken he asks" will some producer please gamble on herpotentialities in classic tragedy or high-classdrama?" because, says he, we want to seeher extended" ; and of Miss Alice Brady" She may do something really great one day " : but " has she that within her to carryher upward and onward ? " he asks. "Wemust watch Miss Lord" he winds up. Ifsome manager could be brought to " gambleon her potentialities " would that, we wonder," carry her upward and onward ? " Unfor- tunately Miss Cowl is one who is " close "to being Mrs Siddons, though Mr Willis has" grave doubts about her . So he turns toask what people may expect from PhyllisPovah.... "a most painstaking young actressand passes on to Miss Helen Mackellarand on to Miss Eldridge, and to MissSadie Thompson, Miss Leonore Ulric andothers.But not once does he ask to see theseadmirable performers in a part which wouldtest their peculiar Siddons quality; LadyMacbeth, for example, or Queen Katharineor some such difficult piece of work. Neitherdoes he show much courage. Miss MarjorieRambeau, whom, alas, we have never seen, hasbeen spoken of, by people who know immedia- tely if there be genius or no in an actress, aspossessing undoubted genius;—yet Mr Willisspeaks of her as " without inspiration .How interesting it is to find the " TheatreMagazine" showering its praises around solavishly, telling us of so many ladies with somuch talent, and yet doubting if any will bea second Siddons.Is there in all this any criticism of Ame- rica itself ? Where talent exists so widely yetdoes not develope and come to its own, some- thing is generally wrong with the place— notthe talent. Yet Mr Willis says not a wordto lead us to suppose that America is not themost perfect of places for the development oftalent and genius. All he is sceptical aboutis the talent and genius. Hmm!...Mr Hornblow the Editor then takes thenext four pages for himself and in these hewrites us all about Sir John Martin Harvey'sproduction of CEdipus, ending up with " theReinhardtian touches were well done andpasses on to " The Swan , " Launziand Galsworthy's " Windows " produced bythe " Theatre Guild", to all of which heis polite. Then " The Dancers , of whichhe says that " the distinguished author ofTrilby would assuredly turn in his grave couldhe guess the sort of play his son has turnedout". He adds that " the standard of En- glish audiences was never lower than today ; and that its " pretty poor stuff for a Du Mau- rier", for the dialogue is " wholly withoutdistinction " and so on.Mr Hornblow then goes for " The Zieg- feld Follies" which do not seem to pleaseany more. We are sorry for that as we hopedto see them in 1934 when we purpose goingacross to see whether Mrs Siddons has beenfound or not.That we have doubts at all about this isdue to the article which follows Mr Horn- blow's critiques, and which is called " Vicesand Virtues of the American Theatre " andis written by Melchior Lengyel.This article attacks the system of em- ploying a " play doctor" to cut and slashthe dialogue of a play for a manager; atthe same time it praises Mr Belasco andMr Hopkins. So the Vices are the " play doc- tors ", the Virtues Belasco and Hopkins.But that gets us not one jot nearer MrsSiddons.€J Then comes what we consider to bequite the best article in the number. It is a veryclever piece of work by Miss Ada Patterson,describing the talents of Mr Ned Wayburn.Need we remind anyone that Mr. Ned Way- burn is the King of the Chorus-girls.He is the only man whose name is inthe New York telephone book four times.A man of incredible energy, of good family,went on the stage, was crowned as King ofBuck Dancers ; and so we may suppose himas able to teach chorus girls how to dance.But not as Fokine teaches them; that iswasting precious time: Wayburn is swifter.Miss Patterson called on Mr Wayburnand was admitted."I am the official picker of Ziegfeld Fol- " lies girls "he said. "In that capacity I saw" six thousand seven hundred and forty three" girls last month. Out of that number I se- " lected ninety-seven for the present Follies." Out of the six thousand odd four thousand" had never had stage experience. Not one" of them but could have been made into an" actress. Any girl who has good features" and a sense of rhythm and hasn't a hump" can be made into an actress ".Miss Patterson reminds him that he "omittedintelligence"."I meant to" he re plied."Do you really mean", she went on," that any woman can become an actress? " I do. just that " (a).&lt;1 Miss Patterson asked Mr Wayburn howhe selected future stars."As they arrive in the outer office andapply, they are card indexed and divided intogroups." The division is made as to size." Girls of from five feet, to five feet three" inches, are listed as dancers. Those whose" height is from five feet three to five feet" seven, as mediums. The girls who are from" five feet seven, to five feet eleven, are show" girls." Squads of 'em are sent into my office".(By the way Mr Wayburn's card indexcontains the name, addi ess, and personalhistory of every chorus girl who ever invadedManhattan Island (ie New York City) or de- serted it).Miss Patterson describes his office as" more worthy of the name studio ". So finea place it is that " Miss Raw Material onentering it feels piteably insignificant. Stan- ding in line with her group, be it dancers ormediums or towering showgirls, she firstlistens to a lecture ". Here she quotes MrWayburn's lecture to the showgirls :"If you have a sense of rhythm, which" presently we will discover, you are fortu- " nate Your features are good. It will be" necessary for you to learn to stand better." You must neither sway back nor slump" forward. You must learn to lift your feet" easily and not to be conscious of them." And the same of your hands. Your height"is your fortune. If you had been a dancer" you would have earned thirty-five to fifty" dollars a week. If you had been a me- " dium fifty to seventy-five. But because of" your height and the scarcity of showgirls" you may earn from seventy-five to a hun- " dred dollars a week ".This is all refreshing nowadays when scep- ticism is so much on the increase.&lt;| Miss Patterson's last question was" What is the average life of a chorus girl ? "to which Mr Wayburn replied sententiously"Five years"." Why so short ? " said she. " For one tiling " he answered " because" ambition takes some of them into principal" parts. Many of them marry. One reason" is, that girls grow old fast in the chorus".And the interview closes.§ Who is not left with wholesale admira- tion for this remarkable man of a remarkablecontinent ? What speed he has, what system,what absolute common-sense." 1 saw 6743 girls last month " he hassaid.That was so as to pick ninety-seven forMr Ziegfeld. And we ask how can we in Eu- rope ever hope to compete with this. We almostfeel that after all they are sure to discoverthat second Mrs Siddons in less than fiveyears, for in that time Mr Wayburn will haveindexed another four hundred and four thou- sand, five hundred and eighty (404,580) girls,and one is bound to be the Siddons.If this isn't the way to find her, we askthe world, what is ?We have heard Mr Arthur Hopkins de- scribed by Americans as an artist and wenever could understand what was meant bythis. Mr J ones is an artist: Mr Geddes,Mr Rosse, are artists. That we could under- stand.But now we see what was meant by MrHopkins being described as an artist. Heis an artist more or less in the same way asMr Wayburn is an artist—but is he, can hereally be considered, such a great artist as thiswonderful King of the Chorus?€J But we must get on to the other pagesof the " Theatre Magazine ".After a few incomprehensible leaves,which, however, contain one very prettypicture showing Miss Marlowe and her hus- band Mr Sothern in " Cymbeline andshort articles on Vaudeville and Music, wecome to a portrait of Miss Jean Howard ofthe Ziegfeld Follies, talking with a Parrot.We had to stop and take a long look, spiteof our wish to keep hustling on. So this,this is one of the ninety-seven chosen ones.Complimenti, Signor Wayburn!There are quite a few pages given to de- scribing the doings of the amateur Stage, astage which, among other things, can boastThe Pasadena Community Players.Then one very dry anecdote of Sir HenryIrving and Mansfield, and a few more pagesof advertisements, and the experience is over. WE have read through this whole numberof " The Theatre Magazine " and aredelighted with the impression we have re- ceived.We are convinced that America had notthe slightest need for the visits of Salvmi,Henry Irving, Madame Eleonora Duse, TheMoscow Art Theatre, Reinhardt and Co, orany European examples of old fashioned stageArt;—and by this we would not have it sup- posed that we mean any disrespect towardsour best European products. But America isdifferent from Europe.Read the following passage which is inbig letters on the announcement page of thesame Theatre Magazine."We have seen the Moscow Art Thea- tre troupe and hailed them as the finest ofworld players." But there is another theatrical organi- zation even greater than Stanislavsky andhis associates—a new theatre whose pro- ductions are the best yet achieved in thedirection of a new and distinctively mo- dern form of drama." Read about it in the next issue ".That's the spirit—surely.Never give a thing time to take root inAmerica—it might take root and blossom andeven bear fruit. And unless it be home- grown, after all, why it bear fruit,blossom or take root ?€j} And this brings us to the second Ame- rican Theatrical Magazine. (a) Reading this remarkable interview with a man of suchimmense practical experience as Mr Wayburn's and comingto this point, my mind turned to thoughts of Maria Carmiand Lady Diar.a Cccper arid then returned to MrsSiddons. * J. S. THE THEATRE ARTS MONTHLY.The number for January 1924 is the copychosen.Avoiding all talk of Mr Way burn, forwhich we are sorry, it devotes its pages (veryhandsome pages too, on good paper) to whatperhaps some Americans might dub high-browstuff.We must admit we rather like this sortof high-brow ; the brow suits the figure—andthe figure is an athletic one. Different fromthe " Theatre Magazine ", it is its complement.It stands for what it believes in, and we cannotthink that, because it stands firm, walks withbearing, speaks well and generally conducts itself like everyone else, it need be dubbedhigh-brow or taken for anything at all resem- bling that eccentric and unusual object.There are some forty—or is it eighty?—different peoples on our earth. Hindoos, En- glish, New Zealanders, Germans, Hottentots—how many? Well, the people who formthe small group of " Theatre Arts Monthly "are like those we have met of every othernationality.They seem to like a hundred dollarswithout forgetting that there are other things.For they like Theatres as do so many others,in those eighty different lands. But they donot like money, see money, live, sleep andwake, money; curse and bless money, or sellwhat's worth much to them for one dollar ahalf-ounce.In this they are like everyone else onearth—except the eccentric ones.These eccentrics are like all other eccen- trics, born to keep us jolly. They concernthemselves with card indexes so amusinglyat times that we almost die with laughing.They sell all sorts of precious things (weneed not enumerate them) for a few dollars;a percentage of a hundred dollars a week,for example. And when they do that it issmart fun. But a still greater joke is whenthese jolly fellows come forth robed inthe majesty of seriousness and solemnly an- nounce what they are doing— —and why.At times we see them looking for something." What are we looking for ? " they ask eachother. " Artistic joy " they reply. The housecomes down.But our friends in " Theatre Arts Month- ly " need never say what they are lookingfor, since we know they have found it. Andthey have shouldered the heavy thing. Theyare not the comedians of our stage-world;they do not split our sides with laughter,though anyone who is ass enough to laugh may.To draw any comparison between thesetwo journals, " The Theatre Magazine andthe "Theatre Arts Monthly" would be thevery last thing we should wish to do; butthose who chance to see the two, side byside, cannot help noticing slight differences.We mean of course in paper, type, andsuch-like externals.We have already stated the number ofpages and so forth, of which the " TheatreMagazine " consists. The " Theatre Arts Monthly" has asmany pages, and slightly smaller; but not apage is split up to make room for advertise- ments. "Highbrow" is it? Silly ass.... it splaying the game properly.So it comes to it that this " Theatre ArtsMonthly " has more pages devoted to textand designs than has the " Theatre Magazine ".And the text is very readable and the designsare by the best artists.If there are not twenty-three pictures ofchorus girls that is only because " TheatreArts Monthly" does not care to intrude will not poach on the other journal's pre- serves.We will not bore our readers by any fer- vid expressions of enthusiasm, or " sympathyas others would put it, for the group of or- dinary good workers who have flocked roundthe American representatives of the thing calledThe New Movement in the Art of the Theatre.From Sheldon Cheney, the original editor,through Robert Jones, down to Ceddes andMacGowan, and on to the latest recruits,one and all of them are doing what the worldhas for centuries known as the thing the goodworkman and the artist always does. Mr. StarkYoung too : and last and certainly not leastMiss Isaacs.It is quite ordinary, being but a naturalyet a sincere affection for that plain unvar- nished thing The Theatre. They have giventheir lives to enjoying this thing ; and, if some- thing good happens to be made while theyare enjoying themselves, well, they hope theworld will like it and a few people will atany rate not be the losers.We put it badly.... but just for the mo- ment cannot put it any better.At the end of 1924 those who subscribenow for a year s twelve numbers of the"Theatre Arts Monthly" will have a veryhandsome volume indeed.Most Theatre Journals are a bit of gaudyfun for the moment (let us thank them for that)but they are not particularly worth keeping.Some things wont keep, what with the changesin the climate, and the flies, and the rest of it.The " Theatre Arts Monthly " will keep.Allow us to be as serious as possible onthat point. At the end of a year you willbind up your twelve numbers and have avolume to which you can turn very often.The writers and draughtsmen, architects, painters and stage-managers who contributeto it are a rather discontented lot of people.As are we of " The Mask ". Discon- tented does not mean gloom. They, and we,are always in the highest spirits.We, and they, are perhaps more grave whendiscontented with ourselves and what we do,than with the eccentrics who keep us jolly ;—sono one need suspect us of being cross aboutwhat the merry outsiders are doing. They arethere and we hope they will stay there ; banjoat breast may they strum till kingdom come, theWarries and the other Wanglers, the Wopkinsand the whole excrutiating race of take-me- serious-artists who are no artists but just jollyold merchants, dealing in this and in that:never working, just trading nicely, you know.But we work in our studios, theatres,or wherever we happen to be. We workon even if in a Palace in Venice or in aHotel in Amsterdam or by the Nile. Ourwork is not dependent on a studio or an of- fice, or a card index, or even a theatre.If we have a theatre, meno male. If none,all's one.That is the touch of comedy we add tothe general merriment; it settles, balances thehorror of the words Art and Artist. Theyare terrifying words it must be admitted.Still, there they are, like "agent" or "ma- nager", "King" or "Pope";—words willbe words.Being able to do our work even on top of abus or under a haystack balances it all,—makesit pleasant, and settles all differences.Remember this, you jolly merchants inBroadway, when next inclined to poke fun atour friends in Number 7 East 42nd Street.You have the laugh but, after all, theyhave the melon. GIUSEPPA CORTESI. GIOVANNI MEZZOGIORNO. IF we are asked to name the great European dancers of thepast, although never having seen them dance, we comeout pat with Fanny Ellsler or La Guimard, La Barbarinaor Taglioni. Allow me to come out as pat with La Cor- tesi, not having seen her either.She was born sometime about the year 1780, andBernardino Mezzanotte speaks of her name as destined tobe eternal: yet it is today forgotten by all but a rare few,and, (so far as my search of two and a half years goes)has not been heard of out of Italy.But listen to Mezzanotte: I SERTI NOBILICHE SON QUI' APPESIIL NOME ETERNINODELLA CORTESI;and this he prints as I have done in capital letters in hisANACREONTICA made to her in 1804 and printedthat year in Perugia, on that well-remembered summer'sday when she came to dance at the Teatro Civico delVerzaro in that city " con applauso universale " as PRIMABALLERINA ASSOLUTA.Then it was that the great Oldani was prevailed onto engrave the celebrated portrait which is reproduced here,{page 129) which reproduction, alas, merely gives her head,but in no way shows us that Divine Pepa who inspiredMezzanotte to pen his Anacreontica:Vegeti I* EderaCresca il virgultoBambino abbracciloLo stringa adulto.Venga col TEVEREII TRASIMENOFecondi TArboreD'Arcadia in senoII Nome celebreSu questa RivaDi PEPPA amabileMai sempre viva—The name of II Mezzanotte is almost as eternal as thatof La Cortesi, yet he too awaits his Biographer. He mustnot be confounded with A. Mezzanotte the author of"La Disposizione della Croce etc., Perugia 1818.The evidence of La Cortesi's immense powers to en- chant the Italian nation will be given to " The Mask"readers in due time: "daughter of Terpsichore 99 she wascalled, even as La Guimard, Taglioni and La Barbarina; for her the sun arose, the birds sang, in the middle of thenight. I should be much surprised if even the greatMile. Virginie (a), a name hardly less celebre, be proved tohave won more hearts, gained greater applause, or mademore money.Giuseppa Cortesi seems to have been married to AntonioCortesi some time about the year 1802. (a) In 1773 Mile. Virginie made over 60,000 livres in sixmonths in the city of Lyons, says the Historian of Mile. Rau- court. THE POET IN THE THEATRE. Hill Crest, Boar's Hill. Oxford. Yours sincerely,JOHN MASEFIELD. Dear Sir,Isee that, in The Mask, you discuss the place of a poetin a theatre.In this country, poets have the supreme precedent ofShakespeare, who settled this point by calling some of theother artists, who worked in the theatre with him, " hisfellows ".A poet should be " the fellow" of the other artistsworking in the theatre. He and the other artists shouldbe working together to give to each other the greatestpossible opportunities for the exercise of their powers.Whenever this happens in any theatre something noble isachieved.No worker in the theatre can do without the art ofhis fellow workers, each should bring all that he can tothe common stock, which thereby becomes uncommon. BOOK REVIEWS. THE SHAKESPEAREAN STAGEby E. K. Chambers. 4 Vols. £ 3.10.0Clarendon Press. E. G. C. Shakespeare Stage and Georgian Stage.HOW I would like to know exactlywhat Mr E. K. Chambers feelsand thinks about the Theatre of ourage, the Georgian stage, now that hehas finished his amazing book on theElizabethan Stage.I am aware that this curiosity ofmine may be rather out of place: maybe in the worst of taste, but there it is.It is at its best only a word put in,on behalf of today, for these four vo- lumes of 44 The Elizabethan Stage **are all for yesterday and for tomorrw.Chambers is a giant of sorts. Iwas always greatly impressed by him; inhis 44 Mediaeval Stage " he surprisedme by his power to stretch backsome centuries and take up in hishand the whole of the ancient stageand lift it up and over the centuries andspread it out for us to see — but hedelighted me at the same time as hetold of things he had seen and heardgoing on in the Churches and on themarket places; these he made to liveagain as though seen by him onlyyesterday.But this time I really am terrifiedby him. First by his awe full capacity to devote twenty years to this onebook. Secondly by his refusal to be at allhuman about this old stage of Eliza'stime; and thirdly by his manner ofmaking a snowball of the dust till itbecomes a piece of granite and then,with a one-two-three, the ball is at us.If he had thrown it as dust, thedust in our eyes would only haveconfused us, may be blinded us; butto hurl the entire edifice at us is anexhibition of strength I hope never towitness again.It has hit me, anyhow.I had almost forgotten about His- torians, for I had perceived that His- tory was growing too alluring to me.I was at the time prying in a gingerly way into a charming corner of histo- rical dust and had just discovered onespangle and was about to pick it upand declare that it was the sun of1612 when I was struck down bythis piece of granite weighing 1570tons; and curiously enough it hasnot killed me.But it has certainly killed all beliefthat I might ever have had in myself asa historian. Fled is any hope that Imight some day write a famous History,which, 1 will now admit, I did oncecontemplate writing. It was to havebeen in about sixteen pages, this Historyof mine. It would have weighed threeounces and a half at most. Its light- ness would have been principally dueto its utter incorrectness, but also notentirely unrelated to the fact, that I hadpromised myself there was to be noword, no date in it, which was notabsolutely true.By this double process I felt I couldsoon get my little tome ready. I wouldhave spent the preparatory years cuttingdown all other Histories of the Stage,slicing out every fact which could notpossibly be sworn to before an En- glish Judge and Jury; and thus out of500 pages of Vancona's book about108 lines would remain over for me;out of 267 pages of Rilag's book Ishould have swept away 265 pages,leaving 3 over for me; out of Nan- tius s five volumes 4 pages would havebeen left, and so on and so on through135 books in all.That which remained would still beopen to so very much doubt, that aboutthree quarters of it would have had togo and at last the world would havehad my sixteen-page History of theStage, and the veracity of every lineeven then would have lain in question.But it would have been a light easybook to doubt. An example, for in- stance ; I would at first, possibly, have al- lowed to remain in the two dateswhich we take to be those on whichShakespeare was born and died; butsince I believe that no one can positive- ly swear to either, out they would go.u But there are documents whichprove , etc., Documents prove noth- ing. 44 Then why not enter the factsthat " William Shakespeare was pro- bably born on April 22 in 1564 atStratford and that .... "But the word probable should neverbe allowed to be seen inside a bookof History; as for 44 it is possible",what is that? Everything is possible,anything is probable,44 Well then, skip his birthday andput down that William Shakespeare was baptised on April 26th 1564 atStratford" says the man who likesreading histories, if not writing them.I would assuredly do so; but howdo I know that he Was baptized, oron April 26th? Did you see him bap- tized in the church?44 I did not—but I have seen thedocuments signed by—Documents?—signed?—But anyonecan falsify documents, and anyone cansign them in place of witnesses whohave suddenly dropped the pen andrun terrified out of the vestry, on hearingsome imaginary ghost swearing in thecellarage—or gone off may be to get acup of tea or a stoup of ale.But leaving that myth Shakespearealone (mythical only in the Historicalsense) how about Queen Elizabeth?There we tread on sacred 18thcentury ground; soil which cries to usthat there never be any scandal abouther;—and what would be more scan- dalous than to discover that she hadnever existed?People have been found bold enoughto whisper that our Virgin Queennever did exist. As well assert thatMr Drinkwater's plays do not containsome moral platitudes. Yet how provethis or anything? What we take for aVirgin Queen may not be all it seems;what is apparently a moral platitudemay be, after all, no such thing.How prove it; that is all I wishto know.The mystery of the Man in the IronMask is not at all mysterious becausehe is an obvious mystery, an odd ro- mantic thing, invented, we take it, forfun. The great Leblanc does thisyearly and does it better.Whereas Shakespeare, and QueenEliza, and all the more solemn myste- ries, are such prim orderly mysteries,that all the world imagines they knowall about them.But all the world may be utterlywrong: for who knows?Only yesterday, January 16th 1924,someone swore to having seen some- thing he had never seen, and a secondbeing told me that he had not seenwhat was before him as he spoke,and he touching it and looking at it.I weary you thus solely to suggestthat nothing ever was or will be, butonly is: that what's gone doesn't count,nor what's to come, but what is countsa little.... and what is perceived countsmore.And, to come to Hecuba, I wouldonly reassert, that which so many othershave stated or felt, which is, that it isa work of art which counts most of allfor it is perfectly real. Art deceives, whereas History pretends not to. Artis a real deceiver.It is even as real as the few thingsno one in his senses will deny realityto,—the bottle of wine, the blanket, asmile, the sea and the other materialglories.The flask of wine is good to see—to see it tipped up and its red or whitecontents flowing into the glass is good;but perfection only is achieved as thiswine passes into us. While it passesand for the moments then and there,and the 3600 subsequent moments,presuming every second of the hourwhich follows a glass of wine is potent.After that it is nil.TTTe blanket, a blessing on the coldnight, a delicious reality, is a curse inthe hot summer and autumn nightswhen we kick off this beastly reality.The sea, delicious to look at, is some- times unbearable to hear; it moans toolong and too often in the rough season;a dip in it in summer is a delight, but tcolong in it tires or cramps you or killsyou. But it is always real—pleasantor not.I know of few things which are allthe time perfect, as assuredly the workof art is. This, however slight it be,is itself and unchangeable: and it isperfect as such, because it is perfectlyreal. Even a fragment is worth somuch that some of the world's wisestmen fight to obtain the fragment,bidding and outbidding one another.And the victorious connoisseur on get- ting it home sits in his chair, turns hishead sideways to discover his immensecontent that there is the fragment. Yourecall how Daumier, (or someone callinghimself Daumier) gives you this sense ofperfect contentment in his lithograph or is it a drawing?Argue how it will, the whole po- pulation of the earth cannot say 44 yourfragment is non-existent ".ON coming to read for the secondtime this book on 44 The ElizabethanStage" we learn that it is, in the purehistorical sense, a masterly work; morenear to perfection than any work inEnglish on the stage that has preceededit, except the same author's 44 The Me- diaeval Stage ".As for faults; well, perhaps thework is three limes too long; likeVanburgh's houses; may be there istoo much space: possibly too manyrooms for a twentieth century familyto live in it comfortably. If I wantto go to breakfast I have a twenty- five minute walk before I get to thedining-room; if I wish to catch a trainI have to allow half an hour extra to get out of the house. And so withthis book.The period of time covered isnot several centuries; it all happenedbetween 1558 and 1616 ; fifty-eightyears in all (if it really happened).Yet as we read we wish the authorcould be more curt, a little less ro- mantic and more human with his pen;something more in the style of that mostfamous of all the histories which begins.William the Conqueror 1066William Rufus 1087and which endsGeorge V 1910.Whereas Mr Chambers begins hisbook by talking delightfully to us about"the psychology of the folk", "thenation's destiny", and 4 4 Elizabeth"who was 44 a young and attractivequeen ".All of which I, masquing as anadamantine critic for the moment, con- tend has nothing to do with stark history.The same may be said of Monnier'ssuperb 44 Venice in the 18th Century"and Strachey's 44 Queen Victoria ":those were masterpieces constructed outof facts and coloured by fancy; not afact but was 44 a fact ", but—and hereit was they triumphed—not one factthat wasn't lost in the delicious fantasyof two great artists.The path Chambers might have takenwould have led him away from temp- tation. But he thought that a middlecourse was best, and many a wise manhas thought like him.The result is that what should havebeen a swift two hundred pages ofbrilliant prose or a slow hundred pagesof bony fact in chronological order, isnor one nor t'other, but a long drawn- out sequence of brilliant pages whichflicker and go out and have to be re- lighted by the continual use of thosecross references, the close packed littleallumets in the Appendixes, Notes andother, too-well, hidden places.And here in these hidden awayplaces we do come to the splendidhistory pure history ; to somethingwhich, while it is obviously open todoubt, is not made more doubtful byany covering; its facts are laid bare.I refer to the Lists. Appendix Aconsists of a Court Calendar for 1558to 1616 and is contained in fifty-fivepages. Appendix B consists of CourtPayments 1558 to 1616; and this inforty-one pages.Then in Vol. 11l we have a list ofPlaywrights in Alphabetical order, threehundred and eighteen pages.But I find this is too long a list, andnot as easy to read as the liberty ofthree hundred and eighteen pages ought to have made it,—or; had the Histo- rical spirit been sterner, as fifty wouldhave made it.For if I am to have a long three- hundred-page list the author mustsweeten it by imagination even asMonnier calls in Imagination to thatend. Three hundred pages without itis somehow a pity.ALL this has been merely to suggestthat what is, is a reality, and onlyfor the Hour that it lives; and that theactualities of the Hour, and the art ofall time, come into the same categoryof the Hour—the real: and History,however perfect, belongs to another ca- tegory, that of the unreal: so my lastas my first thoughts resolve themselvesinto one question, 44 What, I wonder,does this masterly student of the unrealTheatre think of the real Theatre—ofthe Theatre as the home of an art, ie,the Dramatic art, the theatre of thehour? ' Those two unrealities, thePast and the Future, put me oftenunder their spell, but to me their rela- tion to the Present is like that of theEast to the West. I live in the cen- tral part of the world, and whether Ilike or dislike the civilization of ourpart of the globe, it is the only realone for me. All else is past or future.China or America, however fulfilled orpromising, are but fragments, incom- plete unless I bring all I know of themto bear upon the problems of thisplace—Europe, and this day, 1924.And so I feel I have some right inexpressing my curiosity as to whatMr Chambers thinks of the Stagetoday. Should we go back and revivethe conditions of the stage of Eliza- beth's time? and if so how may thatbe done? Are we fso hopelessly *ina muddle that we can neither returnto better conditions, nor even find ascholar something good for his enter- tainment? Or has he found somethingin our Theatre which entertains himafter his work is now done? Will henot relax now, and, breaking the ice,tell us frankly what it is which doesentertain him in the Georgian stage? A LIVING UNIVERSE. ThreeHibhert Lectures by L. P. Jacks, D. D.,L. L. D., D. Lit.; Hodder &amp; Stough- ton. London.Dr. Jacks writes of Education, ofReligion, of Christianity, of Go- vernment, of Immortality, of mostthings. He says some noble thingsand practical things. Someone, Ithink it was the Dramatic Critic of "The Times0 again, twisting Dr. Jacks'swords somehow or other, made him outto be uttering nonsense: said he had" a new view of Shakespeare ".This was because Dr. Jacks expres- sed one of the oldest " views " everheld by man: which was, that a thingacted conveys to the spectator some- thing which the same thing when merelyread does not convey."Go thou and do likewise" saysDr. Jacks, is a motto worth while:whereas "go thou and say likewise "never possessed the same value.And he holds that the action of aplay can reveal more than the merewords can. Seen happenning, the actstrikes home to us; read of in the armchair it loses much of its power.I think this is what he means.But his concern is with the greaterstage, Lear's Stage of fools, ratherthan with the stage of the theatre.Mine, begins and ends with thetheatre.Dr. Jacks dislikes the notion thatartists should talk of art instead ofpractising it, which is a very naturaldislike ; but what would you have ?The artist does a good deal, it seemsto me, under the circumstances. Iknow quite a number of artists, veryordinary folk, with this remarkablething about them; they live practicallyupon air. It is therefore not surprisingif they indulge in a good deal of talk.On the Gontinent they sit in cafes brea- thing in their food and talking of artbecause may-be their bedroom lookson to a wet wall of an inner court, iswithout air, or is infested with things,... mice, etc. ... and they cannot finda better. It is not so jolly as a welllighted cafe in the winter, and in thespring they begin to sing and to talkof other things: in the summer theyforget what it is they said; in the autumnthey remember that winter is comingon apace. And they buy one another'sdrawings. These are the little artists.Of course the great artists are other- wise : they have a special liking forhot drinks and good luncheons and atbanquets they too talk of art,... neverforgetting to act in a very strangeway almost regularly ; ie. they buy theless successful artists' drawings andpaintings.As time goes by, and worries increase,and money does not come in as re- gularly as it would if they could beonly a bit more civilized and-educated,they notice this stand-offishness ofmoney, and begin to think things outfor themselves afresh. In short, theybegin to educate themselves when it'sa little late. This leads them in time to realizethat if they are to get through theyear without too much discomfort tothemselves, wives and children, (forthey often have families) they mustpositively manage to make £2OO forthe three of them.Now how to make £2OO. Alltalk of art must go on if the sum isnot to dwindle to £lOO, for it is upto every artist to become his own pressagent nowadays, ....a luxury Head-mas- ters and Generals and other useful menare spared. The artist is an absolutelyuseless person. Trust Democracy tohave made that certain.No doubt Dr. Jacks has carefullyread a book on and by a mad fellowcalled Van Gogh; those " Letters of aPost-Impressionist ". Constable is thepublisher. The poor wretch is thewhole time talking about art. Heworks at his art daily, but as no onewants it he doesn't sell it, ... and hetalks on and on. Then he dies. Instantlyeveryone buys up cheaply all he hasdone to sell it before long for thous- ands of pounds. Just the amount heneeded to let him live and be of use.If Dr. Jacks could give a series oflectures on how naughty it is for peopleto speculate in the work of painters,sculptors and others, would life beeasier for any of the artists ? No.Something would have to be done, notmerely said.Meantime if art is on the decline it isnot because the artists talk but becausenothing is done by those in power,—at Oxford —let alone in London.The artists are a pious lot of rogues,I know, and not worth much; buttheir work is sometimes rather happy.Prevent that traffic in it, Dr. Jacks,which renders it unhappy and ugly :if you have it in your power; it wouldindeed be doing something every one istalking about.And as for speech, give us somemore Hibbert Lectures, one being onPrime Minister Mussolini, a man who" goes and does likewise ". W. S. GILBERT, HIS LIFE ANDLETTERS. Sidney Dark and Row- land Grey. Illustrated. Methuen. 15/—THERE are enchanting verses andsketches by Gilbert in this volume.Numbers of amusing anecdotes andmany a valuable one too; shrewdjudgements on English Theatres' andactors, make up a book which couldonly have been better had Gilbertwritten it all himself. As it is, abouthalf of it is from his pen, and theother half is well and carefully done. OUR AMERICAN THEATRE byOliver Sayler. Brentano's.THE title is wrong to begin with.It might be more reasonably called" The Theatre in America An- other title might have been " Push, ....or how to spoil everythingThe fault is not Mr. Sayler's forhis other books have been very inte- resting. The fault is Broadway's. TheAmerican Theatre will come alongassuredly, but it is yet too early towrite a book about it. When the bookis written, all the facts will clusterround some one name.Had Mr, Sayler thought for somemoments and asked himself, " who isfar and away the greatest Americanfigure that has appeared in our land ?—who next?—how related ", and thenlooked around and found the othersix or seven related to these andavoided all mention of Europeans, hewould have written a small book butone which would live. We hope hemay yet come to write it. FLOWER IN DRAMA by StarkYoung. Scribner's, $1.50.IT will interest many of those wholike to learn that the Theatre is notwholly the blatant place they still suspectit is. The writer has woven fifteenessays into a small book, and eachessay is graceful, and a number ofsensible things are said in each.Everyone should buy the book andput it by the side of his collection ofNathan. Nathan and Young are not atall alike. Nathan cannot help slapstick- ing; Young cannot help being restrained.An excellent pair for New York, PL A YS FOR A FOLDING THEA- TRE by C. C. Clements. StewartKidd Co. $2.00,IN these trifles we see the writer hasbeen tempted by a large canvas andhas filled it with a little picture. Tak- ing a small field as a theme,.... someeveryday happening in America .... andgetting rid of his own personal emo- tions, the writer should make us agood play in time. I like beginningswhich do not quite succeed. I preferthose which entirely fail to those whichare perfect. Mr. Clements will go onand do better. ANTON CHEHOV by W. Ger- hardi. R. Cobden-Sanderson. 7/6 net.I was unfortunate and my criticalspirit was weaker than ever when I struggled with this book, for I hadjust been reading Regnard and Lesageand I found that Chehov would notdo, No, he will not do. And Mr.Gerhardi's book sounds all the timeas though it were propaganda.I do not like art which depresses.Gogol has given us 44 Rivisor ", so thatwe know that Russia is able to writea real play, .... can realize what is aTheatre and why people go to Theatres.In a Russian Theatre I, of course,tumble to Chehov immediately; it isall so prettily sad; so whispered andwistful, and it can be exceedinglybeautiful. But it wont do out of Rus- sia. Even in Russia I found that themore aristocratic people had no usewhatever for these plays. Grief, suf- fering and medicine are not enough,.... and a very very little goes a longway on the stage.These plays preceeded the Revolu- tion, and I should say helped verygreatly towards making it inevitable.That Chehov is immensely clever,has the soul of a poet, and musthave been a delightful being, does notalter my impression that such work ashe produced is not what is wanted ina Theatre. It helps to kill the specta- tor; it gives him nothing. A HISTORY OF THE REFOR- MATION DRAMA 1660-1700by Allardyce Nicoll. Cambridge Uni- versity Press. 16/-net.A BOOK of four hundred pagesdevoted to forty years of ourEnglish Drama and its Playhouse withvaluable lists and a good index. Ob- viously the book on this subject, al- though I shall always have a specialliking for Mr. John Palmer's 44 TheComedy of Manners" in which thewriters and their way of thinking andwriting comes out to me more clearly.I envy Mr. Nicoll his powers. Thisit is which reminds me how good ishis work even if I should ever doubtit; but I wish he would spell the nameof one of my favourite actors properly.Tiberio Fiorilli should never have hissurname written Fiorelli.

MASKS AND DEMONS by K.McGotoan and H. Rosse. HarcourtBrace &amp; Co.THIS is a first-class collection ofphotographs of some of the bestMasks in existence. Arlechino's andPantalone's are missing .... which is agreat pity.There is room for another book bythese authors on the same subject, inrather lighter vein, less about Godsand more about Masks and how theycome to be made.

Con- stable. 21/-.IT is all very well, but there are toomany lives of this man and I wantto see them all rendered null and voidby the appearance of a book of fortyto fifty pages recording all that is ab- solute fact and nothing such as 44 whenShakespeare retired from acting wecannot say for evidence is lacking.Yet we may suspect that it precededhis withdrawal from the less taxingand more congenial labour of compo- sition ".I quote from this, the latest, Lifeof William Shakespeare; and, while Imust admit that I have enjoyed readinga good part of the book, I have onlybeen able to do this by telling myselfthat it was all gospel. And of courseit is no such thing.But I do not believe the legend hasever before been told quite as well,and so this is the Life to purchase.The book has an excellent Index,some sixty excellent plates. It is wellprinted and costs only twenty-one shillings, which for Constable and Cois an improvement, some of their booksbeing unnecessarily costly. SARAH BERNHARDT by SirGeorge Arthur. Heinemanri. 6/-net.THE REAL SARAH BERN- HARDT by Mme Pierre Bertonand Basil Woon. Boni &amp; Liveright.U. S. A. $3.50.TWO books on Sarah Bernhardt,and both are readable.Sir George Arthur's is the best, andis a very agreable little volume of 178small pages on a complicated persona- lity, (it's the acting which complicates),which could hardly be done justice toin less than 300 large pages. But Iknow of no biography which gives abetter picture or a truer one of thegreat actress and the celebrated woman.It contains many a new fact, andthe author makes his points well. Itis not without significance that he wasbut nineteen years old when Bernhardtfirst came to London in 1879. Hewrites with all the charm of a youngman of nineteen and with the addedgrace of years.Mme. Pierre Berton writes differently:she prefers not to write at all: she talksto Mr Basil Woon and tells him anumber of things which interest me,and others which remind me that itis an actress who is speaking. Forexample, she begins in this fashion:"For all my intimacy with Sarah44 Bernhardt I find it difficult to believe" that she loved me. I think that," on the contrary, she distrusted me,44 and I even believe that at times she4 4 hated me, because it was I, and not44 she, who married Pierre Berton.44 Yet she confided in me ", etc., etc.These are the first five lines of thebook, and the rest of it is like these fivelines; sparkling incidents, secrets, bril- liant pictures, threaded on to a tape.There is a very great deal aboutBernhardt's violence: in this book sheis made to abuse people right andleft in the language used by 44 Nana ",that amazing book on the Theatrewritten by Zola about the time ofBernhardt's prime.Madame Berton is curiously rude toM. Maurice Bernhardt; but then, inmy opinion, she is as rude to the Mo- ther. Altogether a whiff of les cou- lisses ; small-minded, false minded andmalicious.If this story of Bernhardt reflect thelife of the French Theatre of our age,it is indeed time for actors andactresses to begin to exercise theirminds ; for there seem to be a half dozen important things about life andabout art which they have failed toapprehend, and which, when realizedby them, will help greatly towardsbringing the work of the Theatre inline with the other arts.In short, the book is a revelationof how limited is the intelligence ofthe actor and actress, especially theactress; and for this reason I naturallydislike the book intensely, and wish toexpress clearly that I consider it afalse portrait of this remarkable ladywho is but lately dead. BRITISH DRAMA LEAGUEPLAYS Published by Basil Black- well. Oxford. 3/6 each.OF the first eight volumes of Playspublished by Mr Blackwell ofOxford for the British Drama League,I think the best two are, Mr. W. J.Turner's 44 Popomack " and Miss GwenJohn's 44 The Prince ".Miss John does all so nicely, sodelicately : she is original but not out- rageously original, and if much in herplay is dramatic and theatrical, all isdistinguished. Where things halt atall, it is for the theatre folk to busyabout and use their wits. I hope thegifted authoress is planning more plays.On page 51, says Miss John in her44 Emendations ", we are to delete thecomma after the word 44 Juno ". Nocomma has turned up so far, but, ifit dares to, we will delete. There isone after the word 44 Diana ". Iwonder if we may delete that.Mr. W. J. Turner in his 44 Popo- mack " play does enough to provethat he knows how to write a play.That is not always one of the concernsof the modern playwriter, and I canbut be grateful when I am madeaware of this.To begin with he does not hesitate;he does not chatter; he raises his cur- tain and at once you are delighted.His people talk and you listen eagerly.I cannot say as much for mostplay writers, who, even if they can beall things on earth, and yet fail to bringyou to listen eagerly, have failed inall which counts.Having got you to look and to lis- ten, Mr Turner goes on to to interestyou by all sorts of devices, and thenyou begin to smile and grow excited.Were he to bring an elephant on tothe stage or show you a meeting ofangels in Paradise you would be held ;and what duller theme, what sillierlcoking animal ?Add to all this that, when he iscomic he is ever grave, and when se- rious always merry, and you have someidea of what I mean when I say thathere is someone who knows how towrite a play, ....a modern play ...,evenif this be not yet the play which isto prove it to you.

Itresembles the Review of Reviews(London) which, under the editorshipof Mr Wickham Steed seems to havetaken on a new lease of life.Ord och Bild (Stockholm) alwayspleases us greatly, for its excellent arti- cles on the Swedish Stage and for theway it is printed. An ordinary pub- lication, it yet takes care to set upits pages with some style. It is still pub- lished by Wahlstrom and Widsstrandin Stockholm, and its illustrations arealways refreshingly Swedish. Soderhelm,Paasche and Behrens are still its editors.Most magnificent of all illustratedmonthly magazines known to us is TheArchitectural Review. Its size is thesize of the architect. What fellowsthey are, to be sure, these architects.All of them have a sense of power ;none of them seems bothered by afoot-rule. Ask them to build a pyra- mid or design a programme or issue ajournal, and something better thananyone else can ever conceive is boundto come. Their vision is always alarge one. And so this Review oftheirs is a huge one ; its plates spreadthemselves around without stint ; its ar- ticles are boldly conceived and written ;the type the best, the margins superb.Wren looms largely through its numbers,...and the Queen's Dolls' House in theMarch number looked a full sized pa- lace ; no hint of it being only a model.For us the Architects then, for theyhave those rare things, a sense of po- wer, vision; and still walk with thestride known in the days when InigoJones, Wren and and Vanburgh pa- trolled old England. WORK AND PLEASURE.A LEADING ARTICLE REPRINTED FROM THE TIMESMAY 2,1924. J. S. WHILE a certain section of the Press, a Sectiongrowing smaller year by year, is misrepresentingall that Gordon Craig stands for in his work&gt; hissupporters will have experienced a distinct sense of pride and pleasure in seeing the old " Times re- presenting and interpreting it as it does in this deaderpublished on May 2nd, and which, hy the courteous permission of the Editor, we reprint here. IN a recently published book, 44 Woodcuts and someWords Mr. Edward Gordon Craig, a confir- med and incurable artist, speaks of his wood-cuttingas his means of keeping from heart-break, as his(inadequate) livelihood, and as his source of enjoyment.Most of us are familiar with the idea of work underthe first two of those aspects. Work, we know, is anefficacious drug: a soporific, under the influence ofwhich we forget our domestic worries, our failures inlove or on the golf links, all the unhappiness thatpounces upon us in spare moments. Work, we knowalso, is for most people the source of income ; and sostrongly has this idea laid hold of us that he alone isthe 44 practical " man who does work only for thesake of the money that it brings him; and, conversely,the only work that deserves the name of work isthat which the practical man does. Because the exi- guous stipends of the clergy bear no relation to thework they do, and because that work is not done atfixed hours and in a fixed place, the notion is pre- valent—and not only among the uneducated that theclergy do no work at all. 44 All that for a song ! "said Cecil of Queen Elizabeth's gift to EdmundSpenser. Poems are not practical things : the writingof them is not work. The only man who works ishe who reaches the office every morning at ten andleaves it not before five; though experience seems tohint that not every moment of every office hour isfilled with arduous labour, except, of course, in thecase of the lordly principals, whose profound contem- plation of matters too hard for the general is notinterrupted by their meals, scarcely even by their sleep.Work is not work unless it is, in that sense, practical, and unless it is also remunerative. Should it be dis- tasteful as well—a drug that is as nasty as the old- fashioned medicines—then it is work indeed. -Mr. Gordon Craig found his wobd-cutting mode- rately remunerative and a drug so pleasant that heenjoyed taking it. And he goes on to declare thathe, the artist, to whom the work was more importantthan the pay, is the practical man. He enjoyed, aswood-engraver, the finest pleasure that life has tooffer: the pleasure of doing what he liked. Hiswork was neither a means of buying pleasure nor anobstacle to the obtaining of pleasure. It was pleasure.That is an idea which has escaped both our reformersand our reactionaries. Even William Morris did notclaim that the Golden Dustman's work was a pleasureto him. It was a disagreeable necessity, to be com- pensated for by fine clothes in off-hours. And it isan idea that is obviously incompatible with our presentstate of society. In a mechanical age, most work,even among the brain-workers, must be mechanical;and mechanical work, however effectual a drug, can- not be a pleasure in itself. Yet it is cheering to therebel who lurks in each one of us to see the practicalman flouted as a dreamer and the artist upheld aspractical: work declared to be not a disagreeablenecessity, nor a mere means of livelihood, but a plea- sure. We cannot all be artists; but, after chucklingover the paradox, the humblest of us might be cheeredby it into seeing how much of pleasure can be squee- zed out of his own dull and trivial round, and howmuch he may do to deserve that pleasure by exerci- sing some of the artist's perseverance and self-disci- pline. EDITORIAL NOTES. 44 SOMETHING CONCRETE ".October 24. / 923 - May I. / 924. ON the first of these dates Mr Ar- nold Bennett came out with astaunch blast of trumpet headed 44 AShakespeare Theatre AT LAST".The man his staunch blast heralded,was Mr Dion Calthrop:—44 Mr DionCalthrop, out of his own head, has donesomething concrete " cried Mr Bennett,determined to be heard in the last rowof the Gallery. What Mr Calthrophad done he then told us was to esta- blish a mainly Shakespeare Theatre atthe Kingsway.On May Ist of this year, sevenmonths later, it is announced that44 Mr Dion Calthrop intends to reopenthe Kingsway Theatre with a revuenamed 4 At Honje \ "€| We have always had a fancy for44 something concrete "; we like staunchblasts from the heralds; but we like ourheralds to know what is 44 concrete"in the Theatre, and to be not quite sostaunch to the wrong thing.We should hardly imagine that 44 theboy Donald Calthrop " as Mr Bennettcalls him, was young or stupid enoughto have any fixed and unshakeablebelief in drama which is as concreteas the Shakespeare drama, or any othertroublesome but satisfactory work ofhis kind.Mr. Calthrop is a delightful come- dian, an excellent stage manager, anenergetic director; and some there arewho class him with Mr. Play fair andMr. Dean and consider them togetherthe hope of the English stage.Calthrop is just the very man toproduce 44 The Young Person in Pink—which he did produce and perfectly but we think that he has not quite, yet,been visited by those other moods inwhich it becomes possible, to produce the Young Person in Black, .... orKing Lear, or A Midsummer Night'sDream.What then possessed Mr. Bennettto come out with his staunch blast oftrumpet.... announcing next to nothing?Such valuable heralds as Mr. Ben- nett should not waste themselves. Acontinuous, a steady blast of trumpetsfrom ten men of his capacity, and theWalls of Jerico would indeed erectthemselves, after having first dipped toa salute.But there would have to be steadi- ness in their blasts; to tootle first inpraise of Nihil and then on the partof Dionysus is not either playing thetrumpet, or the game, to any concreteresult.There are a number of little groupsin or around London, anyone of whichif trumpeted steadily by ten men ofMr. Bennett's standing would be esta- blished and become concrete with timehelping things along: add a good dealof time.These are: Mr Nigil Playfair's group.Mr Calthrop's group.The Old Vic. group.The Birmingham group.The Reandean group.The Fagan group.The McDougal group.The Bridges Adams group.Are any of these people or groupsfirst class, and, if so, which? Theycan't all be equal in value; is any ofthem the best? if so, which?That decided, why do not Mr Ben- nett and nine other men who know,(we grant it takes a bit of knowing)trumpet and trumpet again for the shopthey decide on as the very best, andget that concretely established beforebeginning on the second.Why trumpet every year for a dif- ferent shop?The concrete is assuredly just whatis wanted: 44 something concrete";....The best of Mr. A. B. Walkley is,that he always has trumpeted the sameold firm: that's the style : and Fidelitythe trademark. CLARITY. FROM AN ENGLISHo DAILY JOURNAL, oTO BE READ SLOWLY. Liverpool, Saturday.44 HTHE first half of this morming's ses-A sion showed further weakness on44 bull liquidation, in view of the easiness44 of New York overnight. With the44 exception, however, of stop-loss exe- 44 cutions, there was little fresh selling44 in the market, and when short cove- -44 ring commenced later a farthing a44 pound was easily recovered. The44 statistical position is gaining in strength,44 and there is a rather better inquiry44 for actual cotton ".And there are some people in theworld who say that 44 The Mask " isdifficult to understand. INCORRECT. J. S. THE 44 Glasgow Herald *\ one ofour most intelligent British jour- nals, contained the following old tar- radiddle on April 10th 1924 : 44 Ob- -44 viously Gordon Craig lacks common- -44 sense he would blow up every44 theatre in London or 4 Gordon- -44 Craigise ' everything in it ".As well flare out with 44 Obviously4 4 4 The Glasgow Herald ' is a horribly44 stupid paper ". There would be asmuch sense in the statement as in theone which it makes and we havequoted.How does the 4 Glasgow Herald 'know that Craig 44 lacks commonsense ",and 44 would blow up every theatre inLondon or 44 4 Gordon-Craigise * every- thing in it " ?This is a typical bit of carelessjournalism for which everyone whowishes well to the British Theatre hasto pay; and it is for this reason weobject.Until Gordon Craig has at least onetheatre in which to prove how little hewould blow it up, the 4 Glasgow He- rald's ' statement remains a blunder.English theatrical information is ata very low ebb : the perpetrator ofthe above blunder later on proceededto speak of 44 Artists such as Mr. Coch- ran and Mr. Basil Dean *\Mr. Cochran and Mr. Dean cannotbe spoken of as artists. The first is arare good impresario and the secondis a proper kind of 44 producerMr Gest 44 produces " 44 The Miracle "in New York : Mr Dean 44 produces "many plays in London: and, if thatmeans anything today, Professor Rein- hardt 44 produces ", ....so what valuehas the word 44 produce " today ?Anyhow, a valuless paragraph onMr. Craig has been produced by the44 Glasgow Herald " and has been anutter frost. We wonder who was the producer.
