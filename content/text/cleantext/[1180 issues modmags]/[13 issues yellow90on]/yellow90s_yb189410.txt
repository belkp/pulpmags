BALLANTYNE PRESS  LONDON &amp; EDINBURGH Mantegna By Philip Broughton Women—Wives or Mothers By A Woman WE believe it to be well within the truth to say that most  men cherish, hidden away in an inner pocket of conscious- ness, their own particular ideal of the perfect woman. Sole  sovereign she of that unseen kingdom, and crowned and sceptred  she remains long after her faithful subject has put aside the other  playthings of his youth. The fetish is from time to time regarded  rapturously, though sorrowfully, by its possessor, but it is never  brought forth for public exhibition. If to worship and adore were the beginning and end of the pastime, no cavilling word  need be said, for the power to worship is a great and good gift,  and, save in the fabulous region of politics, is nowadays so rare an  one, that when discovered in the actual world its steady encour-  agement becomes a duty. But to this apparently innocent diver-  sion there is another side. Somewhat grave consequences are apt  to follow, and it is to this point of view that we wish to call  attention. When the woman uncreate becomes the measuring rod by which  her unconscious living rivals are judged, and are mostly found  wanting, then we are minded to lift up our voice and put in  a plea for fair-play. To the shrined deity are given by the acolo-  thyst, not only all the perfections of person demanded by a severely aesthetic 12  Women—Wives or Mothers aesthetic sense, but all the moral qualities as well. Every grace of  every fair woman he has ever met—the best attributes of his  mother, his sister, and his aunt—are freely hers. None of the  slight blemishes which occasionally tarnish the high lustre of  virtue, none of the caprices to which sirens are constitutionally  liable, are permitted. Faultless wife and faultless mother must she  be, faithful lover and long-suffering friend, or he will have none  of her in his temple. Now, this is surely a wholly unreasonable,  an utterly extravagant demand on the part of man, and if analysed  carefully, will, we believe, be found to yield egoism and gluttony  in about equal parts. How, we venture to inquire, would he meet  a like claim, were it in turn presented to him ? A witty and light-  hearted lady—a remnant yet remains, in spite of the advent of the  leaping, bounding, new womanhood—once startled a selected  audience by the general statement, "All men are widowers."  But even if this generous utterance can be accepted as absolutely  accurate, it can hardly be taken as a proof of man's fitness for  both the important roles involved. For our own part, we are convinced that, broadly speaking,  the exception only proving the rule—whatever that supporting  phrase may mean—woman, fresh from Nature's moulding, is, so far  as  intention is concerned, a predestined wife  or  mother. She  is not both, though doubtless by constant endeavour, art and duty  taking it turn and turn about, the dual end may, with hardness, be  attained unto. For Nature is not economic. Far from her is  the fatal utilitarian spirit which too often prompts the improver  man (or—dare we confess it ?—still more frequently woman) to  attempt to make one object do the work of two. From all such  sorry makeshifts Nature, the great modeller in clay, turns contemp-  tuously away. Not long ago we read in a lady's journal of a 'combination gown' which by some cunning arrangement, the secret By a Woman  13 secret whereof was only known to its lucky possessor, would do  alternate day and night duty with equal credit and despatch. We  have no desire to disparage the varied merits of this ingenious con-  trivance, but at the best it must remain an unlovely hybrid thing.  Probably it knew this well, for gowns, too, have their feelings, and  before now have been seen to go limp in a twinkling, overcome  by a sudden access of despondency. Such a moment must certainly  have come to the omnibus garment referred to above, when it  found itself breakfasting with a severe and one-idea'd "tailor-made,"  or, more cruel experience still, dining skirt by skirt with a  "mysterious miracle"—the latest label—in gossamer and satin. We dare to go even further, and to declare that every woman  knows in her heart—though never, never will she admit it to you—  within which fold she was intended to pass. Is it an exaggeration  to say that many a girl marries out of the superabundance of the  maternal instinct, though she may the while be absolutely ignorant  of the motive power at work ? Believing herself to be wildly  enamoured of the man of her (or her parents') choice, she is in  reality only in love with the nursery of an after-day. Of worship  between husband and wife, as a factor in the transaction, she knows nothing, or likely enough she imagines it present when it  is the sweet passion of pity, or the more subtle patronage of  bestowal, one or both, which are urging her forward into marriage.  Gratitude, none the less real because unrealised, towards the man  who thus enables her to fulfil her true destiny—the saving of souls  alive—has also its share in the complex energy. Well for the  husband of this wife if he allows himself gradually to occupy the  position of eldest and most important of her children, to whom  indeed a somewhat larger liberty is accorded, but from whom also more is required. In return for this submission boundless will be  the care and devotion bestowed upon his upbringing day by day. He 14  Women—Wives or Mothers He will be foolish if he utters aloud, or even says in the silence of  his heart, that motherhood is good, but that wifehood was what he  wanted. It would be but a bootless kicking against the pricks.  For he has chosen the mother-woman, and it is beyond his  power, or that of any other specialist, to effect the fundamental  change for which his soul may long. It only remains for him to  make the best of a very good bargain, and one to which it is very  probable his strict personal merits may hardly have entitled him. If such a marriage is childless, it may still be a very useful one.  Nature's accommodations often verge on the miraculous. The  unemployed maternal instincts of the wife easily work themselves  out in an unlimited and universal auntdom. It must be confessed  that bad blunders are apt to ensue, but where the intentions are  good, the pavement should not be too closely scanned. In fiction  these are the Dinahs, the Romolas, the Dorotheas, the Mary  Garths. Dear to the soul of the female writer is the maternal type. With loving, if tiresome frequency, she is presented to us  again and yet again. In truth we sometimes grow a little weary  of her saintly monotony. But as it is given to few of us to have  the courage of our tastes, we bear with her, as we bear with other  not altogether pleasing appliances, presented to us by earnest  friends, with the assurance that they are for our good, or for our  education, or some other equally superfluous purpose. With the male artist this female model is not nearly so popular.  It may be that he feels himself wholly unequal to cope with her  countless perfections. Certain it is that he makes but a sad  muddle of it when he tries. Witness Thackeray's faded, bloodless  Lady Esmond, as set against his glowing wayward Trix—she,  by the way, a beautifully-marked specimen of the wife-woman—  though whether it would be pure wisdom to take her to wife must be left an open question. Still, we have in our time loved her By a Woman  15 her well, and some of us have found it hard to forgive the black  treachery done in bringing her back in her old age, a painted  and scolding harridan. For these, well-loved of the gods, should, in  fiction at least, die young. Truth compels us to own regretfully that man in his self-indul-  gence shrinks from both the giving and receiving of dull moments,  whilst woman, believing devoutly in their saving grace, is altruistic  enough to devote herself with enthusiasm to the task of their ad-  ministration. Now, dull moments are apt to lie hidden about the  creases of the severely classic robe, which, in the story-books at  any rate, these heroines always wear. We must all agree that  during the last twenty years this type, with its portentous accumu-  lation of self-conscious responsibility has increased alarmingly.  To what is the increase to be attributed ? The too rapid growth  of the female population stands out plainly as prime cause. Legis-  lators are athirst for things practical. Is it beyond their power to  devise some method of dealing with this problem ? The Chinese  plan is painfully obvious, but only as a last and despairful resource,  when the wise men of Westminster sitting on committees and  commissions have failed, can it be mentioned for adoption in  Europe. We are, alas ! Science-ridden, and are likely to remain  thus bridled and saddled for weary years to come. Every bush  and every bug grows its own specialist, and yet we, the patient,  the long-suffering public, are left to endure both the fogs that  make of London one murky pit, and the redundant female birth- rate which threatens more revolutions than all the forces of the  Anarchists in active combination. Meanwhile these devotees of  the abstract play about with all sorts of trifles, masquerading as  grave thinkers, hoping thus to escape their certain judgment-day.  The identification of criminals by the variation of thumb-prints  is a pretty conceit ; so too is the record of the influence of the moon 16  Women—Wives or Mothers moon on the tides, which, we are informed, employs all to itself a  whole and highly paid professor with a yearly average of three  pupils at Cambridge. But what are these save mere fads, on a par  with leapfrog and skittles, in the presence of the momentous  problems about and around us ? Let these gentlemen jockeys look  to it. The hour is not far distant when public opinion shall  discover their uselessness and send them about their business. In humbler ways, too, much might be done to stem the morbid  activity of the collective female conscience. Big sins lie at the  doors of the hosts of good men and women who turn out year by  year tons of "books for the young" to serve as nutriment for the  hungry nestlings of culpable, thoughtless parents. It is hard to  overstate the pernicious effect of this class of motif  literature. Féerie  in old or new dress is the only nourishing food for the  happy child who is to remain happy. The little girl, aged seven,  who lately wrote in her diary before going to bed, "Of what  real use am I in the world ?" had, it is certain, been denied her Andersen, her Grimm, her Carroll, even her Blue fairy book.  Turned in to browse on " Ministering Children," "Agatha's   Prayer," and the fatal "Eric"—into how many editions has this  last well-meaning but poisonous romance not passed—the little  victim of parental stupidity is thus left with an organ damaged for  life by over-much stimulation at the start. This new massacre of  the innocents is of purely nineteenth-century growth. It dates  from the era of the awakened conscience, and is coincident  with the formation of all the societies for the regeneration of the  human race. Per contra , the wife-woman, though but seldom to be met  with in the multitudinous pages written by women, is the well- beloved, the chosen of the male artist. Week-days and Sundays  he paints her portrait. Shakespeare returns to her again and again, as By a Woman  17 as though it were hard to part from her. Wicked Trix stands out  as bold leader of one bad band. Tess belongs to the family, though  she is of another branch ; so does Cathy of Wuthering Heights,  and Lyndall of the African Farm ; whilst latest and slightest scamp  of the lot comes dancing Dodo of Lambeth. Save in a strictly  specialised sense, none of this class can be said to contrive the  greatest good of the greatest number. These are the women to  whom the nursery is at best but an interlude, and at worst a real  interruption of their life's strongest interests. They are not skilled in dealing with early teething troubles, nor in the rival  merits of Welsh and Saxony flannel stuffs. Their crass ignorance  of all this deep lore may, it is true, go far to kill off superfluous  offspring, but, unjust as it would appear, these are the mothers  who each succeeding year become more and more adored of their  sons. Fribblers though they be, they sweeten the world's corners  with the perfume of their charm. And the bit of world's work in  which they excel is the keeping alive the tradition of woman's witchery. Who, then, can deny them their plain uses ? When  Fate is kind and bestows the fitting partner, the fires of their love  never die down. They remain lovers to the end. Their husbands  need fear no rival, not even in the person of their own superior  son. When Fate is unkind and things go crookedly, these are the  women whose wreckage strews life's high road, and from whom  their wiser sisters turn reprovingly away. For the good woman  who has to "work for her living," and who pretends to enjoy the healthful after-pains in her moral system, is rarely tolerant of the existence of the  leichtsinriige  sister for whom, as to Elijah at the  brook, dainty morsels without labour are cheerfully provided by  that inconsequent raven, man. This lady goes gaily, wearing  what she has not spun, reaping where she has not sown. Sad reflections these for the high-souled woman whose enlightened demand 18  Women—Wives or Mothers demand for justice turns in its present day impotency to wrath and bitterness. Wisdom and foresight are never the "attributes of the wife-  woman. Charm, beguilement, fascination of sorts, form her poor  equipment for life's selective struggle. These gifts cannot be said  to promise, save when the stars are in happiest conjunction, long  life and useful days for her intimates. Variations of the two types  of Primitive Woman may abound, but the broad distinction  between them is clearly cut and readily to be made out by  the dullest groper after truth. We can imagine a modern Daniel addressing (quite uselessly) a modem disciple thus : "Look to it now, O young man ! that your feet go straight, and  slip not in search for the pearl that may be hid away for you.  For she who loveth you best may work you all evil, and she who  loveth her own soul's travail best will hardly fail you in the days  and the years. But Love remaineth, and the way of return  is not." "Tell me not Now" By William Watson TELL me not now, if love for love Thou canst return, Now while around us and above Day's flambeaux burn. Not in clear noon, with speech as clear, Thy heart avow, For every gossip wind to hear ; Tell me not now ! Tell me not now the tidings sweet, The news divine ; A little longer at thy feet Leave me to pine. I would not have the gadding bird Hear from his bough ; Nay, though I famish for a word, Tell me not now ! The Yellow Book—Vol. III.  B But 20  "Tell me not Now" But when deep trances of delight All Nature seal ; When round the world the arms of Night Caressing steal ; When rose to dreaming rose says, " Dear , Dearest  ;" and when Heaven sighs her secret in Earth's ear, Ah, tell me then ! From a Lithograph By George Thomson The Headswoman By Kenneth Grahame I IT was a bland sunny morning of a mediaeval May—an old-style  May of the most typical quality ; and the Council of the little  town of St. Radegonde were assembled, as was their wont at that  hour, in the picturesque upper chamber of the Hotel de Ville, for  the dispatch of the usual municipal business. Though the date was  early sixteenth century, the members of this particular town-  council possessed some resemblance to those of similar assemblies  in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and even the nineteenth centuries,  in a general absence of any characteristic at all—unless a pervading  hopeless insignificance can be considered as such. All the character,  indeed, in the room seemed to be concentrated in the girl who  stood before the table, erect, yet at her ease, facing the members in  general and Mr. Mayor in particular ; a delicate-handed, handsome girl of some eighteen summers, whose tall, supple figure was well set  off by the quiet, though tasteful mourning in which she was clad. "Well, gentlemen," the Mayor was saying ; "this little business  appears to be—er—quite in order, and it only remains for me to— er—review the facts. You are aware that the town has lately had  the misfortune to lose its executioner—a gentleman who, I may say, 26  The Headswoman say, performed the duties of his office with neatness and dispatch,  and gave the fullest satisfaction to all with whom he—er—came in  contact. But the Council has already, in a vote of condolence,  expressed its sense of the—er—striking qualities of the deceased.  You are doubtless also aware that the office is hereditary, being  secured to a particular family in this town, so long as any one of its  members is ready and willing to take it up. The deed lies before  me, and appears to be—er—quite in order. It is true that on this  occasion the Council might have been called upon to consider and  examine the title of the claimant, the late lamented official having  only left a daughter—she who now stands before you ; but I am happy to say that Jeanne—the young lady in question—with what  I am bound to call great good-feeling on her part, has saved us all  trouble in that respect, by formally applying for the family post,  with all its—er—duties, privileges, and emoluments ; and her  application appears to be—er—quite in order. There is therefore,  under the circumstances, nothing left for us to do but to declare  the said applicant duly elected. I would wish, however, before I— er—sit down, to make it quite clear to the—er—fair petitioner,  that if a laudable desire to save the Council trouble in the matter  has led her to a—er—hasty conclusion, it is quite open to her to  reconsider her position. Should she determine not to press her claim, the succession to the post would then apparently devolve  upon her cousin Enguerrand, well known to you all as a practising  advocate in the courts of this town. Though the youth has not,  I admit, up to now proved a conspicuous success in the profession  he has chosen, still there is no reason why a bad lawyer should  not make an excellent executioner ; and in view of the close friend-  ship—may I even say attachment ?—existing between the cousins,  it is possible that this young lady may, in due course, practically  enjoy the solid emoluments of the position without the necessity of By Kenneth Grahame  27 of discharging its (to some girls) uncongenial duties. And so,  though not the rose herself, she would still be—er—near the  rose !" And the Mayor resumed his seat, chuckling over his little  pleasantry, which the keener wits of the Council proceeded to  explain at length to the more obtuse. "Permit me, Mr. Mayor," said the girl, quietly, " to thank  you for what was evidently the outcome of a kindly though mis-  directed feeling on your part ; and then to set you right as to the  grounds of my application for the post to which you admit my  hereditary claim. As to my cousin, your conjecture as to the  feeling between us is greatly exaggerated ; and I may further say  at once, from my knowledge of his character, that he is little quali-  fied either to adorn or to dignify an important position such as this.  A man who has achieved such indifferent success in a minor and less exacting walk of life, is hardly likely to shine in an occupation demanding punctuality, concentration, judgment—all the qualities,  in fine, that go to make a good business man. But this is beside  the question. My motives, gentlemen, in demanding what is my  due, are simple and (I trust) honest, and I desire that you should  know them. It is my wish to be dependent on no one. I am  both willing and able to work, and I only ask for what is the  common right of humanity—admission to the labour market. How many poor toiling women would simply jump at a chance  like this which fortune lays open to me ! And shall I, from any  false deference to that conventional voice which proclaims this  thing as "nice," and that thing as "not nice," reject a handicraft  which promises me both artistic satisfaction and a competence ?  No, gentlemen ; my claim is a small one—only a fair day's wage  for a fair day's work. But I can accept nothing less, nor consent  to forgo my rights, even or any contingent remainder of possible  cousinly favour !" There 28  The Headswoman There was a touch of scorn in her fine contralto voice as she  finished speaking ; the Mayor himself beamed approval. He was  not wealthy, and had a large family of daughters ; so Jeanne's  sentiments seemed to him entirely right and laudable. "Well, gentlemen," he began, briskly, "then all we've got to  do, is to——" "Beg pardon, your worship," put in Master Robinet, the  tanner, who had been sitting with a petrified, Bill-the-Lizard sort  of expression during the speechifying ; "but are we to understand  as how this here young lady is going to be the public  executioner ?" "Really, neighbour Robinet," said the Mayor somewhat  pettishly, "you've got ears like the rest of us, I suppose ; and  you know the contents of the deed ; and you ve had my assurance  that it's—er—quite in order ; and as it's getting towards lunch-  time——" "But it's unheard-of," protested honest Robinet. "There  hasn't ever been no such thing—leastways not as I've heard  tell." "Well, well, well," said the Mayor, "everything must have a  beginning, I suppose. Times are different now, you know.  There's the march of intellect, and—er—all that sort of thing.  We must advance with the times—don't you see, Robinet ?— advance with the times !" "Well I'm——" began the tanner. But no one heard, on this occasion, the tanner's opinion as to  his condition, physical or spiritual ; for the clear contralto cut  short his obtestations. "If there's really nothing more to be said, Mr. Mayor," she  remarked, "I need not trespass longer on your valuable time. I  propose to take up the duties of my office to-morrow morning, at the By Kenneth Grahame  29 the usual hour. The salary will, I assume, be reckoned from the  same date ; and I shall make the customary quarterly application  for such additional emoluments as may have accrued to me during  that period. You see I am familiar with the routine. Good  morning, gentlemen !" And as she passed from the Council  chamber, her small head held erect, even the tanner felt that she  took with her a large portion of the May sunshine which was condescending that morning to gild their deliberations. II One evening, a few weeks later, Jeanne was taking a stroll on  the ramparts of the town, a favourite and customary walk of hers  when business cares were over. The pleasant expanse of country  that lay spread beneath her—the rich sunset, the gleaming sinuous  river, and the noble old château that dominated both town and  pasture from its adjacent height—all served to stir and bring out  in her those poetic impulses which had lain dormant during the  working day ; while the cool evening breeze smoothed out and obliterated any little jars or worries which might have ensued  during the practice of a profession in which she was still something  of a novice. This evening she felt fairly happy and content.  True, business was rather brisk, and her days had been fully  occupied ; but this mattered little so long as her modest efforts  were appreciated, and she was now really beginning to feel that,  with practice, her work was creditably and artistically done. In  a satisfied, somewhat dreamy mood, she was drinking in the  various sweet influences of the evening, when she perceived her  cousin approaching. "Good 30  The Headswoman "Good evening, Enguerrand," cried Jeanne pleasantly ; she  was thinking that since she had begun to work for her living, she  had hardly seen him—and they used to be such good friends.  Could anything have occurred to offend him ? Enguerrand drew near somewhat moodily, but could not help  relaxing his expression at sight of her fair young face, set in its  framework of rich brown hair, wherein the sunset seemed to have  tangled itself and to cling, reluctant to leave it. "Sit down, Enguerrand," continued Jeanne, "and tell me what  you've been doing this long time. Been very busy, and winning  forensic fame and gold ? " "Well, not exactly," said Enguerrand, moody once more.  "The fact is, there's so much interest required nowadays at  the courts, that unassisted talent never gets a chance. And you,  Jeanne ?" "Oh, I don't complain," answered Jeanne, lightly. "Of course  it's fair-time just now, you know, and we're always busy then.  But work will be lighter soon, and then I'll get a day off, and  we'll have a delightful ramble and picnic in the woods, as we  used to do when we were children. What fun we had in  those old days, Enguerrand ! Do you remember when we  were quite little tots, and used to play at executions in the back- garden, and you were a bandit and a buccaneer, and all sorts of  dreadful things, and I used to chop off your head with a paper-  knife ? How pleased dear father used to be !" "Jeanne," said Enguerrand, with some hesitation, "you've  touched upon the very subject that I came to speak to you about.  Do you know, dear, I can't help feeling—it may be unreasonable,  but still the feeling is there—that the profession you have adopted  is not quite—is just a little——" "Now, Enguerrand !" said Jeanne, an angry flash sparkling in her By Kenneth Grahame  31 her eyes. She was a little touchy on this subject, the word she  most affected to despise being also the one she most dreaded—the  adjective "unladylike." "Don't misunderstand me, Jeanne," went on Enguerrand,  imploringly : "You may naturally think that, because I should  have succeeded to the post, with its income and perquisites, had  you relinquished your claim, there is therefore some personal  feeling in my remonstrances. Believe me, it is not so. My own  interests do not weigh with me for a moment. It is on your own account, Jeanne, and yours alone, that I ask you to consider  whether the higher aesthetic qualities, which I know you possess,  may not become cramped and thwarted by 'the trivial round, the  common task,' which you have lightly undertaken. However  laudable a professional life may be, one always feels that with a  delicate organism such as woman, some of the bloom may possibly  get rubbed off the peach." "Well, Enguerrand," said Jeanne, composing herself with an  effort, though her lips were set hard, "I will do you the justice  to belive that personal advantage does not influence you, and I will  try to reason calmly with you, and convince you that you are  simply hide-bound by old-world prejudice. Now, take yourself,  for instance, who come here to instruct me : what does your  pro-  fession amount to, when all's said and done ? A mass of lies,  quibbles, dodges, and tricks, that would make any self-respecting  executioner blush ! And even with the dirty weapons at your  command, you make but a poor show of it. There was that  wretched fellow you defended only two days ago. (I was in  court during the trial professional interest, you know.) Well,  he had his regular  alibi  all ready, as clear as clear could be ; only you must needs go and mess and bungle the thing up, so that, as I  expected all along, he was passed on to me for treatment in due course. 32  The Headswoman course. You may like to have his opinion—that of a shrewd,  though unlettered person. 'It's a real pleasure, miss,' he said,  'to be handled by you. You knows  your work, and you  does  your  work—though p'raps I ses it as shouldn't. If that blooming fool  of a mouthpiece of mine'—he was referring to you, dear, in your  capacity of advocate—'had known his business half as well as you do yours, I shouldn't a bin here now !' And you know,  Enguerrand, he was perfectly right." "Well, perhaps he was," admitted Enguerrand. "You see, I  had been working at a sonnet the night before, and I couldn't get  the rhymes right, and they would keep coming into my head in  court and mixing themselves up with the alibi . But look here,  Jeanne, when you saw I was going off the track, you might have  given me a friendly hint, you know—for old times' sake, if not  for the prisoner's !" "I daresay," replied Jeanne, calmly : "perhaps you'll tell me  why I should sacrifice my interests because you're unable to look  after yours. You forget that I receive a bonus, over and above  my salary, upon each exercise of my functions !" "True," said Enguerrand, gloomily : "I did forget that. I  wish I had your business aptitudes, Jeanne." "I daresay you do," remarked Jeanne. "But you see, dear,  how all your arguments fall to the ground. You mistake a  prepossession for a logical base. Now if I had gone, like that  Clairette you used to dangle after, and been waiting-woman to  some grand lady in a château—a thin-blooded compound of drudge  and sycophant—then, I suppose, you'd have been perfectly satisfied.  So feminine ! So genteel !" "She's not a bad sort of girl, little Claire," said Enguerrand,  reflectively (thereby angering Jeanne afresh) : "but putting her  aside,—of course you could always beat me at argument, Jeanne ; you'd By Kenneth Grahame  33 you'd have made a much better lawyer than I. But you know,  dear, how much I care about you ; and I did hope that on that  account even a prejudice, however unreasonable, might have some  little weight. And I'm not alone, let me tell you, in my views.  There was a fellow in court only to-day, who was saying that  yours was only a  succès d'estime  and that woman, as a naturally  talkative and hopelessly unpunctual animal, could never be more  than a clever amateur in the profession you have chosen." "That will do, Enguerrand," said Jeanne, proudly ; "it seems  that when argument fails, you can stoop so low as to insult me  through my sex. You men are all alike—steeped in brutish  masculine prejudice. Now go away, and don't mention the  subject to me again till you're quite reasonable and nice." III Jeanne passed a somewhat restless night after her small scene  with her cousin, waking depressed and unrefreshed. Though she  had carried matters with so high a hand, and had scored so  distinctly all around, she had been more agitated than she had  cared to show. She liked Enguerrand ; and more especially did  she like his admiration for her ; and that chance allusion to  Clairette contained possibilities that were alarming. In embracing a professional career, she had never thought for a moment that it  could militate against that due share of admiration to which, as a  girl, she was justly entitled ; and Enguerrand's views seemed this  morning all the more narrow and inexcusable. She rose languidly,  and as soon as she was dressed sent off a little note to the Mayor,  saying that she had a nervous headache and felt out of sorts, and begging 34  The Headswoman begging to be excused from attendance on that day ; and the  missive reached the Mayor just as he was taking his usual place at  the head of the Board. "Dear, dear," said the kind-hearted old man, as soon as he had  read the letter to his fellow-councilmen : "I'm very sorry. Poor  girl ! Here, one of you fellows, just run round and tell the gaoler  there won't be any business to-day. Jeanne's seedy. It's put off  till to-morrow. And now, gentlemen, the agenda——" "Really, your worship," exploded Robinet, "this is simply  ridiculous !" "Upon my word, Robinet," said the Mayor, "I don't know  what's the matter with you. Here's a poor girl unwell—and a  more hardworking girl isn't in the town—and instead of sym-  pathising with her, and saying you re sorry, you call it ridiculous !  Suppose you had a headache yourself! You wouldn't like——" "But it  is  ridiculous," maintained the tanner stoutly. "Who  ever heard of an executioner having a nervous headache ? There's no precedent for it. And 'out of sorts,' too! Suppose the  criminals said they were out of sorts, and didn't feel up to being  executed ?" "Well, suppose they did," replied the Mayor, "we'd try and  meet them halfway, I daresay. They'd have to be executed  some time or other, you know. Why on earth are you so  captious about trifles ? The prisoners won't mind, and  I  don't  mind : nobody's inconvenienced, and everybody's happy !" "You're right there, Mr. Mayor," put in another councilman.  "This executing business used to give the town a lot of trouble  and bother ; now it's all as easy as kiss-your-hand. Instead of  objecting, as they used to do, and wanting to argue the point and  kick up a row, the fellows as is told off for execution come  skipping along in the morning, like a lot of lambs in Maytime. And By Kenneth Grahame  35 And then the fun there is on the scaffold ! The jokes, the back-  answers, the repartees ! And never a word to shock a baby !  Why, my little girl, as goes through the market-place every morn-  ing—on her way to school, you know—she says to me only  yesterday, she says, 'Why, father,' she says, 'it's as good as the  play-actors,' she says." "There again," persisted Robinet, "I object to that too.  They ought to show a properer feeling. Playing at mummers is  one thing, and being executed is another, and people ought to  keep 'em separate. In my father's time, that sort of thing wasn't  thought good taste, and I don't hold with new-fangled notions." "Well, really, neighbour," said the Mayor, "I think you're out  of sorts yourself to-day. You must have got out of bed the  wrong side this morning. As for a little joke, more or less, we  all know a maiden loves a merry jest when she's certain of having  the last word ! But I'll tell you what I'll do, if it'll please you ;  I'll go round and see Jeanne myself on my way home, and tell  her—quite nicely, you know—that once in a way doesn't matter,  but that if she feels her health won't let her keep regular business hours, she mustn't think of going on with anything that's  bad for her. Like that, don't you see ? And now, gentlemen,  let's read the minutes !" Thus it came about that Jeanne took her usual walk that  evening with a ruffled brow and a swelling heart ; and her little  hand opened and shut angrily as she paced the ramparts. She  couldn't stand being found fault with. How could she help  having a headache ? Those clods of citizens didn't know what a  highly-strung sensitive organisation was. Absorbed in her re-  flections, she had taken several turns up and down the grassy foot-  way, before she became aware that she was not alone. A youth,  of richer dress and more elegant bearing than the general run of the 36  The Headswoman the Radegundians, was leaning in an embrasure, watching the  graceful figure with evident interest. "Something has vexed you, fair maiden ?" he observed, coming  forward deferentially as soon as he perceived he was noticed ;  "and care sits but awkwardly on that smooth young brow." "Nay, it is nothing, kind sir," replied Jeanne ; "we girls who  work for our living must not be too sensitive. My employers  have been somewhat exigent, that is all. I did wrong to take it  to heart." "Tis the way of the bloated capitalist," rejoined the young  man lightly, as he turned to walk by her side. "They grind us,  they grind us ; perhaps some day they will come under your hands  in turn, and then you can pay them out. And so you toil and  spin, fair lily ! And yet methinks those delicate hands show little  trace of labour ?" "You wrong me, indeed, sir," replied Jeanne merrily. "These  hands of mine, that you are so good as to admire, do great execu-  tion !" "I can well believe that your victims are numerous," he  replied ; "may I be permitted to rank myself among the latest of  them ?" "I wish you a better fortune, kind sir," answered Jeanne  demurely. "I can imagine no more delightful one," he replied; "and  where do you ply your daily task, fair mistress ? Not entirely out  of sight and access, I trust ?" "Nay, sir," laughed Jeanne, "I work in the market-place most  mornings, and there is no charge for admission ; and access is far  from difficult. Indeed, some complain—but that is no business  of mine. And now I must be wishing you a good evening.  Nay"—for he would have detained her—"it is not seemly for an unprotected By Kenneth Grahame  37 unprotected maiden to tarry in converse with a stranger at this  hour.  Au revoir , sir ! If you should happen to be in the market-  place any morning"——And she tripped lightly away. The youth, gazing after her retreating figure, confessed himself strangely  fascinated by this fair unknown, whose particular employment, by  the way, he had forgotten to ask ; while Jeanne, as she sped  homewards, could not help reflecting that for style and distinction,  this new acquaintance threw into the shade all the Enguerrands  and others she had met hitherto—even in the course of business. IV The next morning was bright and breezy, and Jeanne was early  at her post, feeling quite a different girl. The busy little market-  place was full of colour and movement, and the gay patches of  flowers and fruit, the strings of fluttering kerchiefs, and the piles  of red and yellow pottery, formed an artistic setting to the quiet  impressive scaffold which they framed. Jeanne was in short  sleeves, according to the etiquette of her office, and her round  graceful arms showed snowily against her dark blue skirt and scarlet tight-fitting bodice. Her assistant looked at her with admiration. "Hope you're better, miss," he said respectfully. "It was just  as well you didn't put yourself out to come yesterday ; there was  nothing particular to do. Only one fellow, and he said  he  didn't  care ; anything to oblige a lady !" "Well, I wish he'd hurry up now, to oblige a lady," said  Jeanne, swinging her axe carelessly to and fro : "ten minutes past  the hour ; I shall have to talk to the Mayor about this." The Yellow Book—Vol. III. C "It's 38  The Headswoman "It's a pity there ain't a better show this morning," pursued  the assistant, as he leant over the rail of the scaffold and spat  meditatively into the busy throng below. "They do say as how  the young Seigneur arrived at the Château yesterday—him as has  been finishing his education in Paris, you know. He's as likely as  not to be in the market-place to-day ; and if he's disappointed, he  may go off to Paris again, which would be a pity, seeing the  Château's been empty so long. But he may go to Paris, or  anywheres else he's a mind to, he won t see better workmanship  than in this here little town !" "Well, my good Raoul," said Jeanne, colouring slightly at the  obvious compliment, "quality, not quantity, is what we aim at  here, you know. If a Paris education has been properly assimi-  lated by the Seigneur, he will not fail to make all the necessary  allowances. But see, the prison-doors are opening at last !" They both looked across the little square to the prison, which  fronted the scaffold ; and sure enough, a small body of men, the  Sheriff at their head, was issuing from the building, conveying, or  endeavouring to convey, the tardy prisoner to the scaffold. That  gentleman, however, seemed to be in a different and less obliging  frame of mind from that of the previous day ; and at every pace  one or other of the guards was shot violently into the middle of  the square, propelled by a vigorous kick or blow from the struggling  captive. The crowd, unaccustomed of late to such demonstrations  of feeling, and resenting the prisoner's want of taste, hooted  loudly ; but it was not until that ingenious mediaeval arrangement  known as  la marche aux crapauds  had been brought to bear  on him, that the reluctant convict could be prevailed upon  to present himself before the young lady he had already so unwarrantably detained. Jeanne's profession had both accustomed her to surprises and By Kenneth Grahame  39 and taught her the futility of considering her clients as drawn  from any one particular class : yet she could hardly hel  feeling some astonishment on recognising her new acquaintance  of the previous evening. That, with all his evident amiability of  character, he should come to this end, was not in itself a special  subject for wonder ; but that he should have been conversing with  her on the ramparts at the hour when—after courteously excusing  her attendance on the scaffold— he was cooling his heels in prison  for another day, seemed hardly to be accounted for, at sight.  Jeanne, however, reflected that the reconciling of apparent contra-  dictions was not included in her official duties. The Sheriff, wiping his heated brow, now read the formal procѐs  delivering over the prisoner to the executioner's hands ;  "and a nice job we've had to get him here," he added on  his own account. And the young man, who had remained  perfectly tractable since his arrival, stepped forward and bowed  politely. "Now that we have been properly introduced," said he  courteously, "allow me to apologise for any inconvenience you  have been put to by my delay. The fault was entirely mine, and  these gentlemen are in no way to blame. Had I known whom I  was to have the pleasure of meeting, wings could not have con-  veyed me swiftly enough." "Do not mention, I pray, the word inconvenience," replied  Jeanne with that timid grace which so well became her : "I only  trust that any slight discomfort it may be my duty to cause you  before we part, will be as easily pardoned. And now—for the  morning, alas ! advances—any little advice or assistance that I  can offer is quite at your service ; for the situation is possibly new,  and you may have had but little experience." "Faith, none worth mentioning," said the prisoner, gaily. "Treat 40  The Headswoman "Treat me as a raw beginner. Though our acquaintance has been  but brief, I have the utmost confidence in you." "Then, sir," said Jeanne, blushing, "suppose I were to assist  you in removing this gay doublet, so as to give both of us more  freedom and less responsibility ?" "A perquisite of the office ?" queried the prisoner with a smile,  as he slipped one arm out of the sleeve. A flush came over Jeanne's fair brow. "That was un-  generous," she said. "Nay, pardon me, sweet one," said he, laughing : "twas but a  poor jest of mine—in bad taste, I willingly admit." "I was sure you did not mean to hurt me," she replied kindly,  while her fingers were busy in turning back the collar of his shirt.  It was composed, she noticed, of the finest point lace ; and she  could not help a feeling of regret that some slight error—as must,  from what she knew, exist somewhere—should compel her to take  a course so at variance with her real feelings. Her only comfort  was that the youth himself seemed entirely satisfied with his  situation. He hummed the last air from Paris during her minis-  trations, and when she had quite finished, kissed the pretty fingers  with a metropolitan grace. "And now, sir," said Jeanne, "if you will kindly come this  way : and please to mind the step—so. Now, if you will have  the goodness to kneel here—nay, the sawdust is perfectly clean ;  you are my  client this morning. On the other side of the  block you will find a nick, more or less adapted to the human chin,  though a perfect fit cannot of course be guaranteed in every case.  So ! Are you pretty comfortable ?" "A bed of roses," replied the prisoner. "And what a really  admirable view one gets of the valley and the river, from just this  particular point !" "Charming By Kenneth Grahame  41 "Charming, is it not ?" replied Jeanne. " I'm so glad you do  justice to it. Some of your predecessors have really quite vexed  me by their inability to appreciate that view. It's worth coming  here to see it. And now, to return to business for one moment, —would you prefer to give the word yourself ? Some people do ;  it's a mere matter of taste. Or will you leave yourself entirely  in my hands ?" "Oh, in your fair hands," replied her client, "which I beg you  to consider respectfully kissed once more by your faithful servant  to command." Jeanne, blushing rosily, stepped back a pace, moistening her  palms as she grasped her axe, when a puffing and blowing behind  caused her to turn her head, and she perceived the Mayor hastily  ascending the scaffold. "Hold on a minute, Jeanne, my girl," he gasped. "Don't be  in a hurry. There's been some little mistake." Jeanne drew herself up with dignity. "I'm afraid I don't  quite understand you, Mr. Mayor," she replied in freezing  accents. "There's been no little mistake on my part that I'm  aware of." "No, no, no," said the Mayor, apologetically ; "but on some-  body else's there has. You see it happened in this way : this  here young fellow was going round the town last night ; and he'd  been dining, I should say, and he was carrying on rather free. I  will only say so much in your presence, that he was carrying on  decidedly free. So the town-guard happened to come across him,  and he was very high and very haughty, he was, and wouldn't  give his name nor yet his address—as a gentleman should, you know, when he's been dining and carrying on free. So our  fellows just ran him in—and it took the pick of them all their  time to do it, too. Well, then, the other chap who was in prison— the 42  The Headswoman the gentleman who obliged you yesterday, you know—what does  he do but slip out and run away in the middle of all the row  and confusion ; and very inconsiderate and ungentlemanly it was  of him to take advantage of us in that mean way, just when we  wanted a little sympathy and forbearance. Well, the Sheriff  comes this morning to fetch out his man for execution, and he  knows there's only one man to execute, and he sees there's only  one man in prison, and it all seems as simple as A B C—he never  was much of a mathematician, you know—so he fetches our friend  here along, quite gaily. And—and that's how it came about, you  see ;  hinc illae lachrymae  as the Roman poet has it. So now I  shall just give this young fellow a good talking to, and discharge  him with a caution ; and we shan't require you any more to-day,  Jeanne, my girl." "Now, look here, Mr. Mayor," said Jeanne severely, "you  utterly fail to grasp the situation in its true light. All these little  details may be interesting in themselves, and doubtless the press  will take note of them ; but they are entirely beside the point.  With the muddleheadedness of your officials (which I have  frequently remarked upon) I have nothing whatever to do. All I  know is, that this young gentleman has been formally handed over  to me for execution, with all the necessary legal requirements ; and  executed he has got to be. When my duty has been performed,  you are at liberty to re-open the case if you like ; and any 'little  mistake' that may have occurred through your stupidity you can  then rectify at your leisure. Meantime, you've no  locus standi here at all ; in fact, you've no business whatever lumbering up my scaffold. So shut up and clear out." "Now, Jeanne, do be reasonable," implored the Mayor. "You  women are so precise. You never will make any allowance for  the necessary margin of error in things." "If By Kenneth Grahame  43 "If I were to allow the necessary margin for all  your errors,  Mayor," replied Jeanne, coolly, " the edition would have to be a  large-paper one, and even then the text would stand a poor chance. And now, if you don t allow me the necessary margin to swing  my axe, there may be another 'little mistake'—" But at this point a hubbub arose at the foot of the scaffold, and  Jeanne, leaning over, perceived sundry tall fellows, clad in the  livery of the Seigneur, engaged in dispersing the municipal guard  by the agency of well-directed kicks, applied with heartiness  and anatomical knowledge. A moment later, there strode on to the  scaffold, clad in black velvet, and adorned with his gold chain of  office, the stately old seneschal of the Château, evidently in a  towering passion. "Now, mark my words, you miserable little bladder-o'-lard," he  roared at the Mayor (whose bald head certainly shone provokingly  in the morning sun), "see if I don't take this out of your skin  presently !" And he passed on to where the youth was still  kneeling, apparently quite absorbed in the view. "My lord," he said, firmly though respectfully, "your hair-  brained folly really passes all bounds. Have you entirely lost your  head ?" "Faith, nearly," said the young man, rising and stretching him-  self. "Is that you, old Thibault ? Ow, what a crick I've got  in my neck ! But that view of the valley was really de-  lightful !" "Did you come here simply to admire the view, my lord ?"  inquired Thibault severely. "I came because my horse would come," replied the young  Seigneur lightly : "that is, these gentlemen here were so pressing ;  they would not hear of any refusal ; and besides, they forgot to  mention what my attendance was required in such a hurry for. And 44  The Headswoman And when I got here, Thibault, old fellow, and saw that divine  creature—nay, a goddess,  dea certé —so graceful, so modest, so anxious to acquit herself with credit—— Well, you know my  weakness ; I never could bear to disappoint a woman. She had  evidently set her heart on taking my head ; and as she had my  heart already——" "I think, my lord," said Thibault with some severity, "you  had better let me escort you back to the Château. This appears  to be hardly a safe place for light-headed and susceptible persons !" Jeanne, as was natural, had the last word. "Understand me,  Mr. Mayor," said she, " these proceedings are entirely irregular.  I decline to recognise them, and when the quarter expires I shall  claim the usual bonus !" V When, an hour or two later, an invitation arrived—courteously  worded, but significantly backed by an escort of half-a-dozen tall  archers—for both Jeanne and the Mayor to attend at the Château  without delay, Jeanne for her part received it with neither sur-  prise nor reluctance. She had felt it especially hard that the only  two interviews fate had granted her with the one man who had  made some impression on her heart, should be hampered, the one  by considerations of propriety, the other by the conflicting claims  of her profession and its duties. On this occasion, now, she would have an excellent chaperon in the Mayor ; and business  being over for the day, they could meet and unbend on a common  social footing. The Mayor was not at all surprised either, consider-  ing what had gone before ; but he was exceedingly terrified, and  sought some consolation from Jeanne as they proceeded together to By Kenneth Grahame  45 to the Château. That young lady's remarks, however, could  hardly be called exactly comforting. "I always thought you'd put your foot in it some day, Mayor,"  she said. "You are so hopelessly wanting in system and method.  Really, under the present happy-go-lucky police arrangements, I  never know whom I may not be called upon to execute. Between  you and my cousin Enguerrand, life is hardly safe in this town.  And the worst of it is, that we other officials on the staff have to  share in the discredit." "What do you think they'll do to me, Jeanne ?" whimpered  the Mayor, perspiring freely. "Can't say, I'm sure," pursued the candid Jeanne. "Of course,  if it's anything in the  rack  line of business, I shall have to super-  intend the arrangements, and then you can feel sure you're in  capable hands. But probably they'll only fine you pretty smartly, give you a month or two in the dungeons, and dismiss you from  your post ; and you will hardly grudge any slight personal incon-  venience resulting from an arrangement so much to the advantage  of the town." This was hardly reassuring, but the Mayor's official reprimand  of the previous day still rankled in this unforgiving young person's  mind. On their reaching the Château, the Mayor was conducted aside,  to be dealt with by Thibault ; and from the sounds of agonised  protestation and lament which shortly reached Jeanne's ears, it  was evident that he was having a mauvais quart d'heure . The  young lady was shown respectfully into a chamber apart, where  she had hardly had time to admire sufficiently the good taste of  the furniture and the magnificence of the tapestry with which the  walls were hung, when the Seigneur entered and welcomed her  with a cordial grace that put her entirely at her ease. "Your 46  The Headswoman "Your punctuality puts me to shame, fair mistress," he said,  "considering how unwarrantably I kept you waiting this morning,  and how I tested your patience by my ignorance and awkward-  ness." He had changed his dress, and the lace round his neck was even  richer than before. Jeanne had always considered one of the  chief marks of a well-bred man to be a fine disregard for the  amount of his washing-bill ; and then with what good taste he  referred to recent events—putting himself in the wrong, as a  gentleman should ! "Indeed, my lord," she replied modestly, "I was only too  anxious to hear from your own lips that you bore me no ill-will  for the part forced on me by circumstances in our recent interview.  Your lordship has sufficient critical good sense, I feel sure, to  distinguish between the woman and the official." "True, Jeanne," he replied, drawing nearer; "and while I  shrink from expressing, in their fulness, all the feelings that the  woman inspires in me, I have no hesitation—for I know it will  give you pleasure—in acquainting you with the entire artistic  satisfaction with which I watched you at your task !" "But, indeed" said Jeanne, "you did not see me at my best.  In fact, I can't help wishing—it's ridiculous, I know, because the  thing is hardly practicable—but if I could only have carried my  performance quite through, and put the last finishing touches to  it, you would not have been judging me now by the mere  'blocking-in' of what promised to be a masterpiece !" "Yes, I wish it could have been arranged somehow," said the  Seigneur reflectively; "but perhaps it's better as it is. I am con-  tent to let the artist remain for the present on trust, if I may only  take over, fully paid up, the woman I adore !" Jeanne felt strangely weak. The official seemed oozing out at her By Kenneth Grahame  47 her fingers and toes, while the woman's heart beat even more dis- tressingly. "I have one little question to ask," he murmured (his arm  was about her now). "Do I understand that you still claim your  bonus ?" Jeanne felt like water in his strong embrace ; but she nerved  herself to answer faintly but firmly : "Yes !" "Then so do I," he replied, as his lips met hers. ***** Executions continued to occur in St. Radegonde ; the Rade-  gundians being conservative and very human. But much of the  innocent enjoyment that formerly attended them departed after  the fair Chatelaine had ceased to officiate. Enguerrand, on suc-  ceeding to the post, wedded Clairette, she being (he was heard to  say) a more suitable match in mind and temper than others of  whom he would name no names. Rumour had it, that he found his match and something over ; while as for temper—and mind  (which she gave him in bits)—— But the domestic trials of high-  placed officials have a right to be held sacred. The profession, in  spite of his best endeavours, languished nevertheless. Some said  that the scaffold lacked its old attraction for criminals of spirit ;  others, more unkindly, that the headsman was the innocent cause,  and that Enguerrand was less fatal in his new sphere than  formerly, when practising in the criminal court as advocate for  the defence. Credo By Arthur Symons EACH, in himself, his hour to be and cease Endures alone, yet few there be who dare Sole with himself his single burden bear, All the long day until the night's release. Yet, ere the night fall, and the shadows close, This labour of himself is each man's lot ; All a man hath, yet living, is forgot, Himself he leaves behind him when he goes. If he have any valiancy within, If he have made his life his very own, If he have loved and laboured, and have known A strenuous virtue, and the joy of sin ; Then, being dead, he has not lived in vain, For he has saved what most desire to lose, And he has chosen what the few must choose, Since life, once lived, returns no more again. For By Arthur Symons  49 For of our time we lose so large a part In serious trifles, and so oft let slip The wine of every moment at the lip Its moment, and the moment of the heart. We are awake so little on the earth, And we shall sleep so long, and rise so late, If there is any knocking at that gate Which is the gate of death, the gate of birth. Four Drawings By Aubrey Beardsley I. Portrait of Himself II. Lady Gold's Escort III. The Wagnerites IV. La Dame aux Camélias White Magic By Ella D'Arcy I SPENT one evening last summer with my friend Mauger, pharmacien  in the little town of Jacques-le-Port. He pro-  nounces his name Major, by-the-bye, it being a quaint custom of the Islands to write proper names one way and speak them another,  thus serving to bolster up that old, old story of the German  savant's account of the difficulties of the English language "where  you spell a man's name Verulam," says he reproachfully, "and  pronounce it Bacon." Mauger and I sat in the pleasant wood-panelled parlour behind  the shop, from whence all sorts of aromatic odours found their  way in through the closed door to mingle with the fragrance of  figs, Ceylon tea, and hot  gôches-à-beurre  constituting the excellent  meal spread before us. The large old-fashioned windows were  wide open, and I looked straight out upon the harbour, filled with  holiday yachts, and the wonderful azure sea. Over against the other islands, opposite, a gleam of white  streaked the water, white clouds hung motionless in the blue sky,  and a tiny boat with white sails passed out round Falla Point. A  white butterfly entered the room to flicker in gay uncertain curves  above the cloth, and a warm reflected light played over the slender  rat-tailed forks and spoons, and raised by a tone or two the colour of 60  White Magic of Mauger's tanned face and yellow beard. For, in spite of a  sedentary profession, his preferences lie with an out-of-door life,  and he takes an afternoon off whenever practicable, as he had done  that day, to follow his favourite pursuit over the golf-links at Les  Landes. While he had been deep in the mysteries of teeing and putting,  with no subtler problem to be solved than the judicious selection of  mashie and cleek, I had explored some of the curious cromlechs or pouquelayes  scattered over this part of the island, and my thoughts  and speech harked back irresistibly to the strange old religions and  usages of the past. "Science is all very well in its way," said I ; "and of course  it's an inestimable advantage to inhabit this so-called nineteenth  century ; but the mediaeval want of science was far more pic-  turesque. The once universal belief in charms and portents, in  wandering saints, and fighting fairies, must have lent an interest  to life which these prosaic days sadly lack. Madelon then would  steal from her bed on moonlight nights in May, and slip across the  dewy grass with naked feet, to seek the reflection of her future  husband's face in the  running stream she passed ; now, Miss  Mary Jones puts on her bonnet and steps round the corner, on  no more romantic errand than the investment of her month's  wages in the savings bank at two and a half per cent." Mauger laughed. "I wish she did anything half so prudent !  That has not been my experience of the Mary Joneses." "Well, anyhow," I insisted, "the Board school has rationalised  them. It has pulled up the innate poetry of their nature to replace  it by decimal fractions." To which Mauger answered "Rot !" and offered me his  cigarette-case. After the  few silent whiffs, he went on as  follows : "The innate poetry of Woman ! Confess now, there is no By Ella D'Arcy  61 no more unpoetic creature under the sun. Offer her the sublimest  poetry ever written and the  Daily Telegraph's  latest article on  fashions, or a good sound murder or reliable divorce, and there's no  betting on her choice, for it's a dead certainty. Many men have  a love of poetry, but I'm inclined to think that a hundred women  out of ninety-nine positively dislike it." Which struck me as true. "We'll drop the poetry, then," I  answered ; "but my point remains, that if the girl of to-day has no  superstitions, the girl of to-morrow will have no beliefs. Teach  her to sit down thirteen to table, to spill the salt, and walk under  a ladder with equanimity, and you open the door for Spencer and  Huxley, and—and all the rest of it," said I, coming to an impotent  conclusion. "Oh, if superstition were the salvation of woman—but you are  thinking of young ladies in London, I suppose ? Here, in the  Islands, I can show you as much superstition as you please. I'm  not sure that the country-people in their heart of hearts don't still  worship the old gods of the  pouquelayes . You would not, of  course, find any one to own up to it, or to betray the least glimmer  of an idea as to your meaning, were you to question him, for ours is  a shrewd folk, wearing their orthodoxy bravely ; but possibly the  old beliefs are cherished with the more ardour for not being openly  avowed. Now you like bits of actuality. I'll give you one, and  a proof, too, that the modern maiden is still separated by many a  fathom of salt sea-water from these fortunate isles. "Some time ago, on a market morning, a girl came into  the shop, and asked for some blood from a dragon. 'Some what ?'  said I, not catching her words. 'Well, just a little blood from a  dragon,' she answered very tremulously, and blushing. She meant  of course, 'dragon's blood,' a resinous powder, formerly much used  in medicine, though out of fashion now. The Yellow Book—Vol. III.  D "She 62  White Magic "She was a pretty young creature, with pink cheeks and dark  eyes, and a forlorn expression of countenance which didn't seem at  all to fit in with her blooming health. Not from the town, or I  should have known her face ; evidently come from one of the  country parishes to sell her butter and eggs. I was interested to  discover what she wanted the 'dragon's blood' for, and after a  certain amount of hesitation she told me. 'They do say it's good,  sir, if anything should have happened betwixt you an' your young  man. 'Then you have a young man ?' said I. 'Yes, sir.'  'And you've fallen out with him ?' 'Yes, sir.' And tears rose  to her eyes at the admission, while her mouth rounded with awe  at my amazing perspicacity. And you mean to send him some  dragon's blood as a love potion ?' 'No, sir ; you've got to mix  it with water you ve fetched from the Three Sisters Well, and  drink it yourself in nine sips on nine nights running, and get into  bed without once looking in the glass, and then if you've done everything properly, and haven't made any mistake, he'll come  back to you, an' love you twice as much as before.' 'And la  mѐre Todevinn (Tostevin) gave you that precious recipe, and  made you cross her hand with silver into the bargain,' said I  severely ; on which the tears began to flow outright. "You know the old lady," said Mauger, breaking off his narra-  tion, " who lives in the curious stone house at the corner of the  market-place ? A reputed witch who learned both black and  white magic from her mother, who was a daughter of Hélier  Mouton, the famous sorcerer of Cakeuro. I could tell you some  funny stories relating to la Mѐre Todevinn, who numbers more  clients among the officers and fine ladies here than in any other class ; and very curious, too, is the history of that stone house, with  the Brancourt arms still sculptured on the side. You can see them,  if you turn down by the Water-gate. This old sinister-looking building, By Ella D'Arcy  63 building, or rather portion of a building, for more modern houses  have been built over the greater portion of the site, and now press  upon it from either hand, once belonged to one of the finest man-  sions in the islands, but through a curse and a crime has been  brought down to its present condition ; while the Brancourt  family have long since been utterly extinct. But all this isn't the  story of Elsie Mahy, which turned out to be the name of my little  customer. "The Mahys are of the Vauvert parish, and Pierre Jean, the  father of this girl, began life as a day-labourer, took to tomato-  growing on borrowed capital, and now owns a dozen glass-houses  of his own. Mrs. Mahy does some dairy-farming on a minute  scale, the profits of which she and Miss Elsie share as pin-money.  The young man who is courting Elsie is a son of Toumes the  builder. He probably had something to do with the putting up of Mahy's greenhouses, but anyhow, he has been constantly over at  Vauvert during the last six months, superintending the alterations  at de Câterelle's place. "Toumes, it would seem, is a devoted but imperious lover, and  the Persian and Median laws are as butter compared with the  inflexibility of his decisions. The little rift within the lute, which  has lately turned all the music to discord, occurred last Monday  week—bank-holiday, as you may remember. The Sunday school  to which Elsie belongs—and it's a strange anomaly, isn't it, that  a girl going to Sunday school should still have a rooted belief in  white magic ?—the school was to go for an outing to Prawn Bay,  and Toumes had arranged to join his sweetheart at the starting- point. But he had made her promise that if by any chance he  should be delayed, she would not go with the others, but would  wait until he came to fetch her. "Of course, it so happened that he was detained, and, equally of course. 64  White Magic course, Elsie, like a true woman, went off without him. She did  all she knew to make me believe she went quite against her own  wishes, that her companions forced her to go. The beautifully  yielding nature of a woman never comes out so conspicuously as  when she is being coerced into following her own secret desires.  Anyhow, Toumes, arriving some time later, found her gone. He  followed on, and under ordinary circumstances, I suppose, a sharp  reprimand would have been considered sufficient. Unfortunately,  the young man arrived on the scene to find his truant love deep  in the frolics of kiss-in-the-ring. After tea in the Câterelle Arms, the whole party had adjourned to a neighbouring meadow,  and were thus whiling away the time to the exhilarating strains of  a French horn and a concertina. Elsie was led into the centre of  the ring by various country bumpkins, and kissed beneath the eyes  of heaven, of her neighbours, and of her embittered swain. "You may have been amongst us long enough to know that  the Toumes family are of a higher social grade than the Mahys,  and I suppose the Misses Toumes never in their lives stooped to  anything so ungenteel as public kiss-in-the-ring. It was not sur-  prising, therefore, to hear that after this incident 'me an' my  young man had words,' as Elsie put it. "Note," said Mauger, "the descriptive truth of this expression  'having words.' Among the unlettered, lovers only do have  words when vexed. At other times they will sit holding hands  throughout a long summer's afternoon, and not exchange two  remarks an hour. Love seals their tongue ; anger alone unlooses  it, and, naturally, when unloosened, it runs on, from sheer want of  practice, a great deal faster and farther than they desire. "So, life being thorny and youth being vain, they parted late  that same evening, with the understanding that they would meet  no more ; and to be wroth with one we love worked its usual harrowing By Ella D'Arcy  65 harrowing effects. Toumes took to billiards and brandy, Elsie to  tears and invocations of Beelzebub ; then came Mѐre Todevinn's  recipe, my own more powerful potion, and now once more all is  silence and balmy peace." "Do you mean to tell me you sold the child a charm, and  didn't enlighten her as to its futility ?" "I sold her some bicarbonate of soda worth a couple of doubles , and charged her five shillings for it into the bargain,"  said Mauger unblushingly. " A wrinkle I learned from once over-  hearing an old lady I had treated for nothing expatiating to a crony, 'Eh, but, my good, my good ! dat Mr. Major, I don't  t'ink much of him. He give away his add-vice an' his meddecines  for nuddin. Dey not wort nuddin' neider, for sure.' So I  made Elsie hand me over five British shillings, and gave her the  powder, and told her to drink it with her meals. But I threw  in another prescription, which, if less important, must nevertheless  be punctiliously carried out, if the charm was to have any effect.  'The very next time,' I told her, 'that you meet your young man in the street, walk straight up to him without looking to the  right or to the left, and hold out your hand, saying these words :  "Please, I so want to be friends again !" Then if you've been a  good girl, have taken the powder regularly, and not forgotten  one of my directions, you'll find that all will come right.' "Now, little as you may credit it," said Mauger, smiling, "the  charm worked, for all that we live in the so-called nineteenth  century. Elsie came into the shop only yesterday to tell me the  results, and to thank me very prettily. 'I shall always come to  you now, sir,' she was good enough to say, 'I mean, if anything  was to go wrong again. You know a great deal more than Mѐre  Todevinn, I'm sure.' 'Yes, I'm a famous sorcerer,' said I, 'but  you had better not speak about the powder. You are wise enough to 66  White Magic to see that it was just your own conduct in meeting your young  man rather more than halfway, that did the trick—eh ?' She  looked at me with eyes brimming over with wisdom. 'You  needn't be afraid, sir, I'll not speak of it. Mѐre Todevinn  always made me promise to keep silence too. But of course I  know it was the powder that worked the charm.' "And to that belief the dear creature will stick to the last day  of her life. Women are wonderful enigmas. Explain to them  that tight-lacing displaces all the internal organs, and show them  diagrams to illustrate your point, they smile sweetly, say, 'Oh,  how funny !' and go out to buy their new stays half an inch  smaller than their old ones. But tell them they must never pass  a pin in the street for luck's sake, if it lies with its point towards  them, and they will sedulously look for and pick up every such  confounded pin they see. Talk to a woman of the marvels of science, and she turns a deaf ear, or refuses point-blank to believe  you ; yet she is absolutely all ear for any old wife's tale, drinks  it greedily in, and never loses hold of it for the rest of her  days." "But does she ?" said I; "that's the point in dispute, and  though your story shows there's still a commendable amount of  superstition in the Islands, I'm afraid if you were to come to  London, you would not find sufficient to cover a threepenny-  piece." "Woman is woman all the world over," said Mauger senten-  tiously, "no matter what mental garb happens to be in fashion at  the time.  Grattez la femme et vous trouvez la folle . For see here :  if I had said to Mademoiselle Elsie, 'Well, you were in the wrong ;  it's your place to take the  step towards reconciliation,' she  would have laughed in my face, or flung out of the shop in a rage.  But because I sold her a little humbugging powder under the guise By Ella D'Arcy  67 guise of a charm, she submitted herself with the docility of a pet  lambkin. No ; one need never hope to prevail through wisdom  with a woman, and if I could have realised that ten years ago, it  would have been better for me." He fell silent, thinking of his past, which to me, who knew it,  seemed almost an excuse for his cynicism. I sought a change of  idea. The splendour of the pageant outside supplied me with  one. The sun had set ; and all the eastern world of sky and water,  stretching before us, was steeped in the glories of the after-glow.  The ripples seemed painted in dabs of metallic gold upon a  surface of polished blue-grey steel. Over the islands opposite hung  a far-reaching golden cloud, with faint-drawn, up-curled edges, as  though thinned out upon the sky by some monster brush ; and  while I watched it, this cloud changed from gold to rose-colour,  and instantly the steel mirror of the sea glowed rosy too, and was  streaked and shaded with a wonderful rosy-brown. As the colour grew momentarily more intense in the sky above, so did the sea  appear to pulse to a more vivid copperish-rose, until at last it was  like nothing so much as a sea of flowing fire. And the cloud  flamed fiery too, yet all the while its up-curled edges rested  in exquisite contrast upon a background of most cool cerulean  blue. The little sailing-boat, which I had noticed an hour previously,  reappeared from behind the Point. The sail was lowered as it  entered the harbour, and the boatman took to his oars. I watched  it creep over the glittering water until it vanished beneath the  window-sill. I got up and went over to the window to hold it  still in sight. It was sculled by a young man in rosy shirt-sleeves,  and opposite to him, in the stern, sat a girl in a rosy gown. So long as I had observed them, not one word had either spoken. In 68  White Magic In silence they had crossed the harbour, in silence the sculler had  brought his craft alongside the landing-stage, and secured her to a  ring in the stones. Still silent, he helped his companion to step  out upon the quay. "Here," said I, to Mauger, "is a couple confirming your  'silent' theory with a vengeance. We must suppose that much  love has rendered them absolutely dumb." He came, and leaned from the window too. "It's not  a  couple, but  the couple," said he ; "and after all, in  spite of cheap jesting, there are some things more eloquent  than speech." For at this instant, finding themselves alone upon  the jetty, the young man had taken the girl into his arms, and she had  lifted a frank responsive mouth to return his kiss. Five minutes later the sea had faded into dull greys and sober  browns, starved white clouds moved dispiritedly over a vacant sky,  and by cricking the back of my neck I was able to follow  Toumes' black coat and the white frock of Miss Elsie until they  reached Poidevin's wine-vaults, and, turning up the Water-gate,  were lost to view.

No sound awakes the summit, voiceless, vast, The bird now sips where rained the ashes dire, The soil is moveless, and Earth's blood on fire, The lava—hardening—gives it peace at last.

When I am King By Henry Harland "Qu'y faire, mon Dieu, qu'y faire ? " I HAD wandered into a tangle of slummy streets, and began to  think it time to inquire my way back to the hotel ; then,  turning a corner, I came out upon the quays. At one hand there  was the open night, with the dim forms of many ships, and stars  hanging in a web of masts and cordage ; at the other, the garish  illumination of a row of public-houses :  Au Bonheur du Matelot , Café de la Marine ,  Brasserie des Quatre Vents , and so forth ;  rowdy-looking shops enough, designed for the entertainment of  the forecastle. But they seemed to promise something in the  nature of local colour ; and I entered the  Brasserie des Quatre  Vents. It proved to be a  brasserie-à-femmes  ; you were waited upon by  ladies, lavishly rouged and in regardless toilets, who would sit  with you and chat, and partake of refreshments at your expense. The front part of the room was filled up with tables, where half a  hundred customers, talking at the top of their voices, raised a  horrid din—sailors, soldiers, a few who might be clerks or trades-  men, and an occasional workman in his blouse. Beyond, there  was a cleared space, reserved for dancing, occupied by a dozen couples, 72  When I am King couples, clumsily toeing it ; and on a platform, at the far end, a  man pounded a piano. All this in an atmosphere hot as a furnace-  blast, and poisonous with the fumes of gas, the smells of bad  tobacco, of musk, alcohol, and humanity. The musician faced away from the company, so that only his  shoulders and the back of his grey head were visible, bent over his  keyboard. It was sad to see a grey head in that situation ; and  one wondered what had brought it there, what story of vice or  weakness or evil fortune. Though his instrument was harsh, and  he had to bang it violently to be heard above the roar of conversa-  tion, the man played with a kind of cleverness, and with certain  fugitive suggestions of good style. He had once studied an art,  and had hopes and aspirations, who now, in his age, was come to serve the revels of a set of drunken sailors, in a disreputable tavern, where they danced with prostitutes. I don't know why, but from  the  he drew my attention ; and I left my handmaid to count  her charms neglected, while I sat and watched him, speculating  about him in a melancholy way, with a sort of vicarious shame. But presently something happened to make me forget him—  something of his own doing. A dance had ended, and after a  breathing spell he began to play an interlude. It was an instance  of how tunes, like perfumes, have the power to wake sleeping  memories. The tune he was playing now, simple and dreamy  like a lullaby, and strangely at variance with the surroundings,  whisked me off in a twinkling, far from the actual—ten, fifteen  years backwards—to my student life in Paris, and set me to thinking, as I had not thought for many a long day, of my hero,  friend, and comrade, Edmund Pair ; for it was a tune of Pair's  composition, a melody he had written to a nursery rhyme, and  used to sing a good deal, half in fun, half in earnest, to his lady-  love, Godelinette : "Lavender's By Henry Harland  73 "Lavender's blue, diddle-diddle, Lavender's green ; When I am king, diddle-diddle, You shall be queen." It is certain he meant very seriously that if he ever came into his  kingdom Godelinette should be queen. The song had been  printed, but, so far as I knew, had never had much vogue ; and it  seemed an odd chance that this evening, in a French seaport town  where I was passing a single night, I should stray by hazard into  a sailors pothouse and hear it again. Edmund Pair lived in the Latin Quarter when I did, but he  was no longer a mere student. He had published a good many  songs ; articles had been written about them in the newspapers ;  and at his rooms you would meet the men who had "arrived"— actors, painters, musicians, authors, and now and then a politician — who thus recognised him as more or less one of themselves.  Everybody liked him ; everybody said, "He is splendidly gifted ;  he will go far." A few of us already addressed him, half-playfully perhaps, as  cher maître . He was three or four years older than I—eight or nine  and twenty to my twenty-five—and I was still in the schools ; but for  all that we were great chums. Quite apart from his special talent,  he was a remarkable man—amusing in talk, good-looking, generous,  affectionate. He had read ; he had travelled ; he had hob-and-  nobbed with all sorts and conditions of people. He had wit,  imagination, humour, and a voice that made whatever he said a  cordial to the ear. For myself I admired him, enjoyed him, loved him, with equal fervour ; he had all of my hero-worship and the  lion's share of my friendship ; perhaps I was vain as well as glad  to be distinguished by his intimacy. We used to spend two or three 74  When I am King three evenings a week together, at his place or at mine, or over  the table of a café, talking till the small hours—Elysian sessions,  at which we smoked more cigarettes and emptied more  bocks than  I should care to count. On Sundays and holidays we would take long walks arm-in-arm in the Bois, or, accompanied by Gode-  linette, go to Viroflay or Fontainebleau, lunch in the open, bedeck  our hats with wildflowers, and romp like children. He was tall  and slender, with dark waving hair, a delicate aquiline profile, a  clear brown skin, and grey eyes, alert, intelligent, kindly. I fancy  the Boulevard St. Michel, flooded with sunshine, broken here and  there by long crisp shadows ; trams and omnibuses toiling up the  hill, tooting their horns ; students and  étudiantes  sauntering gaily  backwards and forwards on the  trottoir  ; an odour of asphalte, of caporal tobacco ; myself one of the multitude on the terrace of a  café ; and Edmund and Godelinette coming to join me—he with  his swinging stride, a gesture of salutation, a laughing face ; she  in the freshest of bright-coloured spring toilets : I fancy this, and  it seems an adventure of the golden age. Then we would drink  our  apéritifs , our Turin bitter, perhaps our absinthe, and go off to  dine together in the garden at Lavenue's. Godelinette was a child of the people, but Pair had done  wonders by way of civilising her. She had learned English, and  prattled it with an accent so quaint and sprightly as to give point  to her otherwise perhaps somewhat commonplace observations.  She was fond of reading ; she could play a little ; she was an  excellent housewife, and generally a very good-natured and quite  presentable little person. She was Parisian and adaptable. To meet her, you would never have suspected her origin ; you would  have found it hard to believe that she had been the wife of a  drunken tailor, who used to beat her. One January night, four  or five years before, Pair had surprised this gentleman publicly pummelling By Henry Harland  75 pummelling her in the Rue Gay-Lussac. He hastened to remon-  strate ; and the husband went off, hiccoughing of his outraged  rights, and calling the universe to witness that he would have the  law of the meddling stranger. Pair picked the girl up (she was  scarcely eighteen then, and had only been married a sixmonth), he  picked her up from where she had fallen, half fainting, on the  pavement, carried her to his lodgings, which were at hand, and  sent for a doctor. In his manuscript-littered study for rather more than nine weeks she lay on a bed of fever, the consequence  of blows, exhaustion, and exposure. When she got well there  was no talk of her leaving. Pair couldn't let her go back to her  tailor ; he couldn't turn her into the streets. Besides, during the  months that he had nursed her, he had somehow conceived a great  tenderness for her ; it made his heart burn with grief and anger  to think of what she had suffered in the past, and he yearned to  sustain and protect and comfort her for the future. This perhaps  was no more than natural ; but, what rather upset the calculations  of his friends, she, towards whom he had established himself in the  relation of a benefactor, bore him, instead of a grudge therefor, a  passionate gratitude and affection. So, Pair said, they were only waiting till her tailor should drink himself to death, to get married;  and meanwhile, he exacted for her all the respect that would have  been due to his wife ; and everybody called her by his name. She  was a pretty little thing, very daintily formed, with tiny hands and  feet, and big gipsyish brown eyes ; and very delicate, very fragile—  she looked as if anything might carry her off. Her name, Gode-  leine, seeming much too grand and mediaeval for so small and actual  a person, Pair had turned it into Godelinette. We all said, "He is splendidly gifted ; he will do great things."  He had studied at Cambridge and at Leipsic before coming to  Paris. He was learned, enlightened, and extremely modern ; he was 76  When I am King was a hard worker. We said he would do great things ; but I  thought in those days, and indeed I still think—and, what is more  to the purpose, men who were themselves musicians and composers,  men whose names are known, were before me in thinking—that  he had already done great things, that the songs he had already  published were achievements. They seemed to us original in  conception, accomplished and felicitous in treatment ; they were full of melody and movement, full of harmonic surprises ; they had  style and they had "go." One would have imagined they must  please at once the cultivated and the general public. I could never  understand why they weren't popular. They would be printed ;  they would be praised at length, and under distinguished signatures,  in the reviews ; they would enjoy an unusual success of appro-  bation ; but—they wouldn't  sell , and they wouldn't get themselves  sung at concerts. If they had been too good, if they had been  over the heads of people—but they weren't. Plenty of work quite  as good, quite as modern, yet no whit more tuneful or interesting,  was making its authors rich. We couldn't understand it, we had  to conclude it was a fluke, a question of chance, of accident. Pair  was still a very young man ; he must go on knocking, and some day—to-morrow, next week, next year, but some day certainly—  the door of public favour would be opened to him. Meanwhile  his position was by no means an unenviable one, goodness knows.  To have your orbit in the art world of Paris, and to be recognised  there as a star ; to be written about in the  Revue des Deux-  Mondes  ; to possess the friendship of the masters, to know that  they believe in you, to hear them prophesy, "He will do great  things"—all that is something, even if your wares don't "take  on" in the market-place. "It's a good job, though, that I haven't got to live by them,"  Pair said ; and there indeed he touched a salient point. His people By Henry Harland   77 people were dead ; his father had been a younger son ; he had  no money of his own. But his father's elder brother, a squire  in Hampshire, made him rather a liberal allowance, something like  six hundred a year, I believe, which was opulence in the Latin  Quarter. Now, the squire had been aware of Pair's relation with  Godelinette from its inception, and had not disapproved. On his  visits to Paris he had dined with them, given them dinners, and  treated her with the utmost complaisance. But when, one fine  morning, her tailor died, and my quixotic friend announced his intention of marrying her,  dans les délais légaux , the squire  protested. I think I read the whole correspondence, and I remember that in the beginning the elder man took the tone of  paradox and banter." Behave dishonourably, my dear fellow. I  have winked at your mistress heretofore, because boys will be  boys ; but it is the  man  who marries. And, anyhow, a woman is  so much more interesting in a false position." But he soon  became serious, presently furious, and, when the marriage was an  accomplished fact, cut off the funds. "Never mind, my dear," said Pair. "We will go to London  and seek our fortune. We will write the songs of the people,  and let who will make the laws. We will grow rich and famous,  and 'When I am king, diddle-diddle, You shall be queen !'" So they went to London to seek their fortune, and—that was the  last I ever saw of them, nearly the last I heard. I had two letters  from Pair, written within a month of their hegira—gossipy,  light-hearted letters, describing the people they were meeting,  reporting Godelinette's quaint observations upon England and  English things, explaining his hopes, his intentions, all very The Yellow Book—Vol. III. E confidently 78  When I am King confidently—and then I had no more. I wrote again, and still  again, till, getting no answer, of course I ceased to write. I  was hurt and puzzled ; but in the spring we should meet in  London, and could have it out. When the spring came, however,  my plans were altered : I had to go to America. I went by way  of Havre, expecting to stay six weeks, and was gone six years. On my return to England I said to people, "You have a  brilliant young composer named Pair. Can you put me in the  way of procuring his address ?" The fortune he had come to  seek he would surely have found ; he would be a known man.  But people looked blank, and declared they had never heard of him.  I applied to music-publishers—with the same result. I wrote to his uncle in Hampshire ; the squire did not reply. When I  reached Paris I inquired of our friends there ; they were as  ignorant as I. "He must be dead," I concluded. "If he had  lived, it is impossible we should not have heard of him." And I  wondered what had become of Godelinette. Then another eight or ten years passed, and now, in a water-  side public at Bordeaux, an obscure old pianist was playing Pair's  setting of "Lavender's blue," and stirring a hundred bitter-sweet  far-away memories of my friend. It was as if fifteen years were  erased from my life. The face of Godelinette was palpable before  me—pale, with its sad little smile, its bright appealing eyes.  Edmund might have been smoking across the table—I could hear  his voice, I could have put out my hand and touched him. And  all round me were the streets, the lights, the smells, the busy youthful  va-et-vient  of the Latin Quarter ; and in my heart the  yearning, half joy and all despair and anguish, with which we  think of the old days when we were young, of how real and dear  they were, of how irrecoverable they are. And then the music stopped, the Brasserie des Quatre Vents became By Henry Harland  79 became a glaring reality, and the painted female sipping  eau-de-vie at my elbow remarked plaintively, "Tu n'es pas rigolo, toi.  Vieux-tu faire une valse ?" "I must speak to your musician," I said. " Excuse me." He had played a bit of Pair's music. It was one chance in a  thousand, but I wanted to ask him whether he could tell me  anything about the composer. So I penetrated to the bottom  of the shop, and approached his platform. He was bending  over some sheets of music—making his next selection, doubt- less. "I beg your pardon——" I began. He turned towards me. You will not be surprised—I was  looking into Pair's own face. You will not be surprised, but you will imagine what it was  for me. Oh, yes, I recognised him instantly ; there could be no  mistake. And he recognised me, for he flushed, and winced, and  started back. I suppose for a little while we were both of us speechless,  speechless and motionless, while our hearts stopped beating. By-  and-by I think I said—something had to be said to break the  situation—I think I said, "It's you, Edmund?" I remember he  fumbled with a sheet of music, and kept his eyes bent on it, and  muttered something inarticulate. Then there was another speech-  less, helpless suspension. He continued to fumble his music,  without looking up. At last I remember saying, through a sort of sickness and giddiness, "Let us get out of here—where we  can talk." "I can't leave yet. I've got another dance," he answered. "Well, I'll wait," said I. I sat down near him and waited, trying to create some kind of order 80  When I am King order out of the chaos in my mind, and half automatically watching  and considering him as he played his dance—Edmund Pair playing  a dance for prostitutes and drunken sailors. He was not greatly  changed. There were the same grey eyes, deep-set and wide  apart, under the same broad forehead ; the same fine nose and  chin, the same sensitive mouth. The whole face was pretty much  the same, only thinner perhaps, and with a look of apathy, of  inanimation, that was foreign to my recollection of it. His hair had turned quite white, but otherwise he appeared no older than  his years. His figure, tall, slender, well-knit, retained its vigour  and its distinction. Though he wore a shabby brown Norfolk  jacket, and his beard was two days old, you could in no circum-  stances have taken him for anything but a gentleman. I waited  anxiously for the time when we should be alone—anxiously,  yet with a sort of terror. I was burning to understand, and yet  I shrunk from doing so. If to conjecture even vaguely what experiences could have brought him to this, what dark things  suffered or done, had been melancholy when he was a nameless  old musician, now it was appalling, and I dreaded the explana-  tion that I longed to hear. At last he struck his final chord, and rose from the piano. Then  he turned to me and said, composedly enough, "Well, I'm ready."  He, apparently, had in some measure pulled himself together. In  the street he took my arm. "Let's walk in this direction," he  said, leading off, "towards the Christian quarter of the town."  And in a moment he went on : "This has been an odd meeting.  What brings you to Bordeaux ?" I explained that I was on my way to Biarritz, stopping for the  night between two trains. "Then it's all the more surprising that you should have  stumbled into the Brasserie des Quatre Vents. You've altered very By Henry Harland  81 very slightly. The world wags well with you ? You look  prosperous." I cried out some incoherent protest. Afterwards I said, "You  know what I want to hear. What does this mean ?" He laughed nervously. "Oh, the meaning's clear enough. It  speaks for itself." "I don't understand," said I. "I'm pianist to the Brasserie des Quatre Vents. You saw me  in the discharge of my duties." "I don't understand," I repeated helplessly. "And yet the inference is plain. What could have brought a  man to such a pass save drink or evil courses ?" "Oh, don't trifle," I implored him. "I'm not trifling. That's the worst of it. For I don't drink,  and I'm not conscious of having pursued any especially evil courses." "Well ?" I questioned. "Well ?" "The fact of the matter simply is that I m what they call a  failure. I never came off." "I don't understand," I repeated for a  time. "No more do I, if you come to that. It's the will of Heaven,  I suppose. Anyhow, it can't puzzle you more than it puzzles  me. It seems contrary to the whole logic of circumstances, but  it's the fact." Thus far he had spoken listlessly, with a sort of bitter levity,  an affectation of indifference ; but after a little silence his mood  appeared to change. His hand upon my arm tightened its grasp,  and he began to speak rapidly, feelingly. "Do you realise that it is nearly fifteen years since we have  seen each other ? The history of those fifteen years, so far as I  am concerned, has been the history of a single uninterrupted déveine —one continuous run of ill-luck, against every probability of 82  When I am King of the game, against every effort I could make to play my cards  effectively. When I started out, one might have thought, I had  the best of chances. I had studied hard ; I worked hard. I  surely had as much general intelligence, as much special know-  ledge, as much apparent talent, as my competitors. And the  stuff I produced seemed good to you, to my friends, and not  wholly bad to me. It was musicianly, it was melodious, it was sincere ; the critics all praised it ; but—it never took on ! The  public wouldn't have it. What did it lack ? I don't know. At  last I couldn't even get it published—invisible ink ! And I had a  wife to support." He paused for a minute ; then : "You see," he said, "we made  the mistake, when we were young, of believing, against wise  authority, that it  was  in mortals to command success, that he  could command it who deserved it. We believed that the race  would be to the swift, the battle to the strong ; that a man was  responsible for his own destiny, that he'd get what he merited.  We believed that honest labour couldn t go unrewarded. An  immense mistake. Success is an affair of temperament, like faith,  like love, like the colour of your hair. Oh, the old story about  industry, resolution, and no vices ! I was industrious, I was  resolute, and I had no more than the common share of vices.  But I had the unsuccessful temperament ; and here I am. If my  motives had been ignoble—but I can't see that they were. I  wanted to earn a decent living ; I wanted to justify my existence  by doing something worthy of the world's acceptance. But the  stars in their courses fought against me. I have tried hard to con-  vince myself that the music I wrote was rubbish. It had its  faults, no doubt. It wasn't great, it wasn't epoch-making. But,  as music goes nowadays, it was jolly good. It was a jolly sight  better than the average." "Oh, By Henry Harland  83 "Oh, that is certain, that is certain," I exclaimed, as he paused  again. "Well, anyhow, it didn't sell, and at last I couldn't even get it  published. So then I tried to find other work. I tried every-  thing. I tried to teach—harmony and the theory of composition.  I couldn't get pupils. So few people want to study that sort of  thing, and there were good masters already in the place. If I had  known how to play, indeed ! But I was never better than a fifth-  rate executant ; I had never gone in for that ; my 'lay' was com-  position. I couldn't give piano lessons, I couldn't play in public— unless in a  gargotte  like the hole we have just left. Oh, I tried  everything. I tried to get musical criticism to do for the news-  papers. Surely I was competent to do musical criticism. But  no—they wouldn't employ me. I had ill luck, ill luck, ill luck— nothing but ill luck, defeat, disappointment. Was it the will of  Heaven ? I wondered what unforgiveable sin I had committed to  be punished so. Do you know what it is like to work and pray  and wait, day after day, and watch day after day come and go and  bring you nothing ? Oh, I tasted the whole heart-sickness of  hope deferred ; Giant Despair was my constant bed-fellow." "But—with your connections——" I began. "Oh, my connections !" he cried. "There was the rub,  London is the cruellest town in Europe. For sheer cold blood  and heartlessness give Londoners the palm. I had connections  enough for the  month or so, and then people found out  things that didn't concern them. They found out some things that were true, and they imagined other things that were false.  They wouldn't have my wife ; they told the most infamous lies  about her ; and I wouldn't have  them . Could I be civil to people who insulted and slandered  her  ? I had no connections in London,  except with the underworld. I got down to copying parts for theatrical 84  When I am King theatrical orchestras ; and working twelve hours a day, earned  about thirty shillings a week." "You might have come back to Paris." "And fared worse. I couldn't have earned thirty pence in  Paris. Mind you, the only trade I had learned was that of a  musical composer ; and I couldn't compose music that people  would buy. I should have starved as a copyist in Paris, where  copyists are more numerous and worse paid. Teach there ? But  to one competent master of harmony in London there are ten in  Paris. No ; it was a hopeless case." "It is incomprehensible—incomprehensible," said I. "But wait—wait till you've heard the end. One would think  I had had enough—not so ? One would think my cup of bitterness  was full. No fear ! There was a stronger cup still a-brewing  for me. When Fortune takes a grudge against a man, she never lets  up. She exacts the uttermost farthing. I was pretty badly off,  but I had one treasure left—I had Godelinette. I used to think  that she was my compensation. I would say to myself, 'A fellow  can't have all blessings. How can you expect others, when you've  got her ? And I would accuse myself of ingratitude for com- plaining of my unsuccess. Then she fell ill. My God, how I  watched over, prayed over her ! It seemed impossible—I could  not believe—that she would be taken from me. Yet, Harry, do  you know what that poor child was thinking ? Do you know  what her dying thoughts were—her wishes ? Throughout her long painful illness she was thinking that she was an obstacle in  my way, a weight upon me ; that if it weren't for her, I should  get on, have friends, a position ; that it would be a good thing for  me if she should die ; and she was hoping in her poor little heart  that she wouldn't get well ! Oh, I know it, I knew it—and you  see me here alive. She let herself die for my sake—as if I could care By Henry Harland  85 care for anything without her ! That's what brought us here, to  France, to Bordeaux—her illness. The doctors said she must pass  the spring out of England, away from the March winds, in the  South ; and I begged and borrowed money enough to take her.  And we were on our way to Arcachon ; but when we reached  Bordeaux she was too ill to continue the journey, and—she died  here." We walked on for some distance in silence, then he added :  "That was four years ago. You wonder why I live to tell you  of it, why I haven't cut my throat. I don't know whether it's  cowardice or conscientious scruples. It seems rather inconsequent  to say that I believe in a God, doesn't it ?—that I believe one's life  is not one's own to make an end of? Anyhow, here I am, keeping  body and soul together as musician to a  brasserie-à-femmes . I  can't go back to England, I can't leave Bordeaux—she's buried  here. I've hunted high and low for work, and found it nowhere  save in the  brasserie-à-femmes . With that, and a little copying  now and then, I manage to pay my way." "But your uncle ?" I asked. "Do you think I would touch a penny of his money ?" Pair  retorted, almost fiercely. "It was he who began it. My wife  let herself die. It was virtual suicide. It was he who created the  situation that drove her to it." "You are his heir, though, aren't you ?" "No, the estates are not entailed." We had arrived at the door of my hotel. "Well, good-night  and  bon voyage ," he said. "You needn't wish me  bon voyage ," I answered. "Of course  I'm not leaving Bordeaux for the present." "Oh, yes, you are. You're going on to Biarritz to-morrow  morning, as you intended." And 86  When I am King And herewith began a long and most painful struggle. I could  persuade him to accept no help of any sort from me. "What I  can't do for myself," he declared, "I'll do without. My dear fellow,  all that you propose is contrary to the laws of Nature. One man  can't keep another—it's an impossible relation. And I won't be  kept ; I won't be a burden. Besides, to tell you the truth, I've  got past caring. The situation you find me in seems terrible to  you ; to me it's no worse than another. You see, I'm hardened ;  I ve got past caring." "At any rate," I insisted, "I shan't go on to Biarritz. I'll  spend my holiday here, and we can see each other every day.  What time shall we meet to-morrow ?" "No, no, I can't meet you again. Don't ask me to ; you  mean it kindly, I know, but you're mistaken. It's done me good  to talk it all out to you, but I can't meet you again. I've got  no heart for friendship, and—you remind me too keenly of many  things." "But if I come to the  brasserie  to-morrow night ?" "Oh, if you do that, you'll oblige me to throw up my employ-  ment there, and hide from you. You must promise not to come  again—you must respect my wishes." "You're cruel, you know." "Perhaps, perhaps. But I think I'm only reasonable. Any-  how, good-bye." He shook my hand hurriedly, and moved off. What could I  do ? I stood looking after him till he had vanished in the night,  with a miserable baffled recognition of my helplessness to help  him. To a Bunch of Lilac By Theo Marzials "Dis-moi la fleur, je te dirai la femme " Is it the April springing, Or the bird in the breeze above ? My throat is full of singing, My heart is full of love. O heart, are you not yet broken ? O dream, so done with and dead, Is life's one word not spoken, And the rede of it all not read ? No hope in the whole world over ! No hope in the infinite blue ! Yet I sing and laugh out like a lover— Oh, who is it, April—who ? And the glad young year is springing ; And the birds, and the breeze above, And the shrill tree-tops, are singing— And I am singing—of love. * * * * O beautiful 88  To a Bunch of Lilac O beautiful lilac flowers, Oh, say, is it you, is it you The sun-struck, love-sick hours Go faint for murmuring through ?

From a Pastel By Albert Foschter Apple Blossom in Brittany By Ernest Dowson I IT was the feast of the Assumption in Ploumariel, at the hottest  part of the afternoon. Benedict Campion, who had just  assisted at vespers, in the little dove-cotted church—like every-  thing else in Ploumariel, even vespers were said earlier than is the  usage in towns—took up his station in the market-place to watch  the procession pass by. The head of it was just then emerging  into the Square : a long file of men from the neighbouring  villages, bare-headed and chaunting, followed the crucifer. They  were all clad in the picturesque garb of the Morbihan peasantry, and were many of them imposing, quite noble figures with their  clear-cut Breton features, and their austere type of face. After  them a troop of young girls, with white veils over their heads,  carrying banners—children from the convent school of the  Ursulines ; and then, two and two in motley assemblage (peasant  women with their white coifs walking with the wives and  daughters of prosperous  bourgeois  in costumes more civilised but  far less pictorial) half the inhabitants of Ploumariel—all, indeed,  who had not, with Campion, preferred to be spectators, taking  refuge from a broiling sun under the grateful shadow of the chest- nuts 94  Apple Blossom in Brittany nuts in the market-place. Last of all a muster of clergy, four  or five strong, a small choir of bullet-headed boys, and the Curé or  the parish himself, Monsieur Letêtre chaunting from his book,  who brought up the rear. Campion, leaning against his chestnut tree, watched them  defile. Once a smile of recognition flashed across his face, which  was answered by a girl in the procession. She just glanced from  her book, and the smile with which she let her eyes rest upon him  for a moment, before she dropped them, did not seem to detract  from her devotional air. She was very young and slight—she  might have been sixteen—and she had a singularly pretty face ;  her white dress was very simple, and her little straw hat, but both of these she wore with an air which at once set her apart from her companions, with their provincial finery and their rather common-  place charms. Campion's eyes followed the little figure until it  was lost in the distance, disappearing with the procession down a  by-street on its return journey to the church. And after they  had all passed, the singing, the last verse of the "Ave Maris  Stella," was borne across to him, through the still air, the voices of  children pleasantly predominating. He put on his hat at last, and  moved away ; every now and then he exchanged a greeting with somebody—the communal doctor, the mayor ; while here and there  a woman explained him to her gossip in whispers as he passed, "It  is the Englishman of Mademoiselle Marie-Ursule—it is M. le  Curé's guest." It was to the dwelling of M. le Curé, indeed,  that Campion now made his way. Five minutes' walk brought  him to it ; an unpretentious white house, lying back in its large  garden, away from the dusty road. It was an untidy garden,  rather useful than ornamental ; a very little shade was offered by  one incongruous plane-tree, under which a wooden table was placed and some chairs. After  déjeûner , on those hot August days, Campion By Ernest Dowson  95 Campion and the Curé took their coffee here ; and in the evening  it was here that they sat and talked while Mademoiselle Hortense,  the Curé's sister, knitted, or appeared to knit, an interminable  shawl ; the young girl, Marie-Ursule, placidly completing  the quartet with her silent, felicitous smile of a convent-bred child,  which seemed sometimes, at least to Campion, to be after all a  finer mode of conversation. He threw himself down now on the  bench, wondering when his hosts would have finished their de- votions, and drew a book from his pocket as if he would read.  But he did not open it, but sat for a long time holding it idly in  his hand, and gazing out at the village, at the expanse of dark pine-  covered hills, and at the one trenchant object in the foreground,  the white façade of the convent of the Ursuline nuns. Once and  again he smiled, as though his thoughts, which had wandered a  long way, had fallen upon extraordinarily pleasant things. He was  a man of barely forty, though he looked slightly older than his  age : his little, peaked beard was grizzled, and a life spent in  literature, and very studiously, had given him the scholar's premature stoop. He was not handsome, but, when he smiled,  his smile was so pleasant that people credited him with good looks.  It brought, moreover, such a light of youth into his eyes, as to  suggest that if his avocations had unjustly aged his body, that had  not been without its compensations—his soul had remained re-  markably young. Altogether, he looked shrewd, kindly and  successful, and he was all these things, while if there was also a certain sadness in his eyes—lines of lassitude about his mouth— this was an idiosyncracy of his temperament, and hardly justified  by his history, which had always been honourable and smooth.  He was sitting in the same calm and presumably agreeable reverie,  when the garden gate opened, and a girl—the young girl of the  procession, fluttered towards him. The Yellow Book.—Vol. III.  F "Are 96  Apple Blossom in Brittany "Are you quite alone?" she asked brightly, seating herself at  his side. "Has not Aunt Hortense come back ?" Campion shook his head, and she continued speaking in English,  very correctly, but with a slight accent, which gave to her pretty  young voice the last charm. "I suppose she has gone to see  la mѐre Guémené . She will not  live another night they say. Ah ! what a pity," she cried, clasping  her hands ; "to die on the Assumption—that is hard." Campion smiled softly. "Dear child, when one's time comes,  when one is old as that, the day does not matter much." Then  he went on : "But how is it you are back ; were you not going to  your nuns ?" She hesitated a moment. "It is your last day, and I wanted to  make tea for you. You have had no tea this year. Do you think  I have forgotten how to make it, while you have been away, as I  forget my English words ?" "It's I who am forgetting such an English habit," he pro-  tested. "But run away and make it, if you like. I am sure it  will be very good." She stood for a moment looking down at him, her fingers  smoothing a little bunch of palest blue ribbons on her white dress.  In spite of her youth, her brightness, the expression of her face in  repose was serious and thoughtful, full of unconscious wistfulness.  This, together with her placid manner, the manner of a child who  has lived chiefly with old people and quiet nuns, made her beauty  to Campion a peculiarly touching thing. Just then her eyes fell  upon Campion's wide-awake, lying on the seat at his side, and  travelled to his uncovered head. She uttered a protesting cry :  "Are you not afraid of a  coup de soleil ? See—you are not  fit to be a guardian if you can be so foolish as that. It is I  who have to look after you." She took up the great grey hat and set By Ernest Dowson  97 set it daintily on his head ; then with a little laugh she disappeared  into the house. When Campion raised his head again, his eyes were smiling,  and in the light of a sudden flush which just died out of it, his  face looked almost young. II This girl, so foreign in her education and traditions, so foreign  in the grace of her movements, in everything except the shade of  her dark blue eyes, was the child of an English father ; and she  was Benedict Campion's ward. This relation, which many  persons found incongruous, had befallen naturally enough. Her  father had been Campion's oldest and most familiar friend ; and  when Richard Heath's romantic marriage had isolated him from so  many others, from his family and from his native land, Campion's attachment to him had, if possible, only been increased. From  his heart he had approved, had prophesied nothing but good of an  alliance, which certainly, while it lasted, had been an wholly ideal  relation. There had seemed no cloud on the horizon—and yet  less than two years had seen the end of it. The birth of the  child, Marie-Ursule, had been her mother's death ; and six months  later, Richard Heath, dying less from any defined malady than  because he lacked any longer the necessary motive to live,  was laid by the side of his wife. The helpless child remained, in  the guardianship of Hortense, her mother's sister, and elder by  some ten years, who had already composed herself contentedly, as  some women do, to the prospect of perpetual spinsterhood, and the  care of her brother's house—an ecclesiastic just appointed curé  of Ploumariel. And here, ever since, in this quiet corner of Brittany, in 98  Apple Blossom in Brittany in the tranquil custody of the priest and his sister, Marie-Ursule  had grown up. Campion's share in her guardianship had not been onerous,  although it was necessarily maintained ; for the child had inherited,  and what small property would come to her was in England, and  in English funds. To Hortense Letêtre and her brother such  responsibilities in an alien land were not for a moment to be  entertained. And gradually, this connection, at formal and  impersonal, between Campion and the Breton presbytery, had  developed into an intimacy, into a friendship singularly satisfying  on both sides. Separate as their interests seemed, those of the  French country-priest, and of the Englishman of letters, famous already in his own department, they had, nevertheless, much  community of feeling apart from their common affection for a  child. Now, for many years, he had been established in their  good graces, so that it had become an habit with him to spend his  holiday—it was often a very extended one—at Ploumariel ;  while to the Letêtres, as well as to Marie-Ursule herself, this  annual sojourn of Campion's had become the occasion of the year, the one event which pleasantly relieved the monotony of life in  this remote village ; though that, too, was a not unpleasant routine.  Insensibly Campion had come to find his chief pleasure in con-  sideration of this child of an old friend, whose gradual growth  beneath influences which seemed to him singularly exquisite and  fine, he had watched so long ; whose future, now that her child-  hood, her schooldays at the convent had come to an end, threatened  to occupy him with an anxiety more intimate than any which  hitherto he had known. Marie-Ursule's future ! They had  talked much of it that summer, the priest and the Englishman,  who accompanied him in his long morning walks, through green  lanes, and over white, dusty roads, and past fields perfumed with the By Ernest Dowson  99 the pungently pleasant smell of the blood-red  sarrasin , when he  paid visits to the sick who lived on the outskirts of his scattered  parish. Campion became aware then of an increasing difficulty  in discussing this matter impersonally, in the impartial manner  becoming a guardian. Odd thrills of jealousy stirred within him  when he was asked to contemplate Marie-Ursule's possible suitors.  And yet, it was with a very genuine surprise, at least for the  moment, that he met the Curé's sudden pressing home of a more personal contingency—he took this freedom of an old friend with  a shrewd twinkle in his eye, which suggested that all along this  had been chiefly in his mind. " Mon bon ami , why should you  not marry her yourself ? That would please all of us so much."  And he insisted, with kindly insistence, on the propriety of the  thing : dwelling on Campion's established position, their long  habit of friendship, his own and his sister's confidence and esteem,  taking for granted, with that sure insight which is the gift of many  women and of most priests, that on the ground of affection alone the  justification was too obvious to be pressed. And he finished with  a smile, stopping to take a pinch of snuff with a sigh of relief— the relief of a man who has at least seasonably unburdened him- self. "Surely,  mon ami , some such possibility must have been in your  mind ?" Campion hesitated for a moment ; then he proffered his hand,  which the other warmly grasped. "You read me aright," he said  slowly, "only I hardly realised it before. Even now—no, how  can I believe it possible—that she should care for me.  Non sum  dignus, non sum dignus . Consider her youth, her inexperience ;  the best part of my life is behind me." But the Curé smiled reassuringly. "The best part is before  you, Campion ; you have the heart of a boy. Do we not know you ? 100  Apple Blossom in Brittany you ? And for the child—rest tranquil there ! I have the word of  my sister, who is a wise woman, that she is sincerely attached to  you ; not to speak of the evidence of my own eyes. She will be  seventeen shortly, then she can speak for herself. And to whom  else can we trust her ?" The shadow of these confidences hung over Campion when he  next saw Marie-Ursule, and troubled him vaguely during the  remainder of his visit, which this year, indeed, he considerably  curtailed. Inevitably he was thrown much with the young girl,  and if daily the charm which he found in her presence was  sensibly increased, as he studied her from a fresh point of view, he  was none the less disquieted at the part which he might be called  upon to play. Diffident and scrupulous, a shy man, knowing little of women ; and at least by temperament, a sad man, he  trembled before felicity, as many at the palpable breath of mis-  fortune. And his difficulty was increased by the conviction,  forced upon him irresistibly, little as he could accuse himself of  vanity, that the decision rested with himself. Her liking for him  was genuine and deep, her confidence implicit. He had but to  ask her and she would place her hand in his and go forth with  him, as trustfully as a child. And when they came to celebrate her  fête , Marie-Ursule's seventeenth birthday—it occurred a little  before the Assumption— it was almost disinterestedly that he had  determined upon his course. At least it was security which he could promise her, as a younger man might not ; a constant and single-minded kindness ; a devotion not the less valuable, because  it was mature and reticent, lacking, perhaps, the jealous ardours of  youth. Nevertheless, he was going back to England without  having revealed himself; there should be no unseasonable haste in  the matter ; he would give her another year. The Curé smiled  deprecatingly at the procrastination ; but on this point Campion was By Ernest Dowson  101 was firm. And on this, his last evening, he spoke only of trivial  things to Marie-Ursule, as they sat presently over the tea—a mild  and flavourless beverage— which the young girl had prepared.  Yet he noticed later, after their early supper, when she strolled up  with him to the hill overlooking the village, a certain new shyness  in her manner, a shadow, half timid, half expectant in her clear  eyes which permitted him to believe that she was partly prepared.  When they reached the summit, stood clear of the pine trees by  an ancient stone Calvary, Ploumariel lay below them, very fair  in the light of the setting sun ; and they stopped to rest themselves,  to admire. "Ploumariel is very beautiful," said Campion after a while.  "Ah ! Marie-Ursule, you are fortunate to be here." "Yes." She accepted his statement simply, then suddenly:  "You should not go away." He smiled, his eyes turning from  the village in the valley to rest upon her face : after all, she was  the daintiest picture, and Ploumariel with its tall slate roofs, its  sleeping houses, her appropriate frame. "I shall come back, I shall come back," he murmured. She  had gathered a bunch of ruddy heather as they walked, and her  fingers played with it now nervously. Campion stretched out his  hand for it. She gave it him without a word. "I will take it with me to London," he said ; "I will have  Morbihan in my rooms." "It will remind you—make you think of us sometimes ?" For answer he could only touch her hand lightly with his lips.  "Do you think that was necessary ?" And they resumed their  homeward way silently, although to both of them the air seemed  heavy with unspoken words. When 102  Apple Blossom in Brittany III When he was in London—and it was in London that for nine  months out of the twelve Benedict Campion was to be found—he  lived in the Temple, at the top of Hare Court, in the very same  rooms in which he had installed himself, years ago, when he gave  up his Oxford fellowship, electing to follow the profession of  letters. Returning there from Ploumariel, he resumed at once,  easily, his old avocations. He had always been a secluded man, living chiefly in books and in the past ; but this year he seemed  less than ever inclined to knock at the hospitable doors which were  open to him. For in spite of his reserve, his diffidence, Campion's  success might have been social, had he cared for it, and not purely  academic. His had come to be a name in letters, in the higher  paths of criticism ; and he had made no enemies. To his success  indeed, gradual and quiet as this was, he had never grown quite  accustomed, contrasting the little he had actually achieved with all  that he had desired to do. His original work was of the slightest,  and a book that was in his head he had never found time to write.  His name was known in other ways, as a man of ripe knowledge, of impeccable taste ; as a born editor of choice reprints, of  inaccessible classics : above all, as an authority—the greatest, upon  the literature and the life (its flavour at once courtly, and  mystical, had to him an unique charm) of the seventeenth century.  His heart was in that age, and from much lingering over it, he  had come to view modern life with a curious detachment, a sense  of remote hostility : Democracy, the Salvation Army, the novels of  M. Zola—he disliked them all impartially. A Catholic by long  inheritance, he held his religion for something more than an heirloom ; By Ernest Dowson  103 heirloom ; he exhaled it, like an intimate quality ; his mind being essentially of that kind to which a mystical view of things comes easiest. This year passed with him much as any other of the last ten years  had passed ; at least the routine of his daily existence admitted little  outward change. And yet inwardly, he was conscious of alteration,  of a certain quiet illumination which was a new thing to him. Although at Ploumariel when the prospect of such a marriage  had dawned on him, his  impression had been one of strange-  ness, he could reflect now that it was some such possibility as this  which he had always kept vaguely in view. He had prided himself  upon few things more than his patience ; and now it appeared that  this was to be rewarded ; he was glad that he had known how  to wait. This girl, Marie-Ursule, had an immense personal charm  for him, but, beyond that, she was representative—her traditions  were exactly those which the ideal girl of Campion's imagination  would possess. She was not only personally adorable; she was also  generically of the type which he admired. It was possibly because this type was, after all, so rare, that looking back, Campion in his  middle age, could drag out of the recesses of his memory no  spectre to compete with her. She was his  love precisely  because the conditions, so choice and admirable, which rendered it  inevitable for him to love her, had never occurred before. And  he could watch the time of his probation gliding away with a  pleased expectancy which contained no alloy of impatience. An  illumination—a quite tranquil illumination : yes, it was under  some such figure, without heart-burning, or adolescent fever,  that love as it came to Campion was best expressed. Yet if  this love was lucent rather than turbulent, that it was also deep  he could remind himself, when a letter from the priest, while  the spring was yet young, had sent him to Brittany, a month or 104  Apple Blossom in Brittany or two before his accustomed time, with an anxiety that was  not solely due to bewilderment. "Our child is well, mon bon, "  so he wrote.  "Do not alarm  yourself. But it will be good for you to come, if it be only because of  an idea she has, that you may remove. An idea ! Call it rather a  fancy—at least your coming will dispel it. Petites entêtées : I have  no patience with these mystical little girls. " His musings on the phrase, with its interpretation varying to  his mood, lengthened his long sea-passage, and the interminable  leagues of railway which separated him from Pontivy, whence he  had still some twenty miles to travel by the  Courrier , before he  reached his destination. But at Pontivy, the round, ruddy face  of M. Letêtre greeting him on the platform dispelled any serious  misgiving. Outside the post-office the familiar conveyance  awaited them : its yellow inscription "Pontivy-Ploumariel,"  touched Campion electrically, as did the cheery greeting of the  driver, which was that of an old friend. They shared the interior  of the rusty trap—a fossil among vehicles—they chanced to be the only travellers, and to the accompaniment of jingling harness,  and the clattering hoofs of the brisk little Carhaix horses,  M. Letêtre explained himself. "A vocation,  mon Dieu  ! if all the little girls who fancied them-  selves with one, were to have their way, to whom would our poor  France look for children ? They are good women,  nos Ursulines ,  ah, yes ; but our Marie-Ursule is a good child, and blessed  matrimony also is a sacrament. You shall talk to her, my Campion.  It is a little fancy, you see, such as will come to young girls; a  convent ague, but when she sees you"... He took snuff with  emphasis, and flipped his broad fingers suggestively. " Craque !  it is a betrothal, and a  trousseau , and not the habit of religion, that  Mademoiselle is full of. You will talk to her ?" Campion By Ernest Dowson  105 Campion assented silently, absently, his eyes had wandered  away, and looked through the little square of window at the sad-  coloured Breton country, at the rows of tall poplars, which  guarded the miles of dusty road like sombre sentinels. And the  priest with a reassured air pulled out his breviary, and began to  say his office in an imperceptible undertone. After a while he  crossed himself, shut the book, and pillowing his head against the hot, shiny leather of the carriage, sought repose ; very soon his  regular, stertorous breathing, assured his companion that he was  asleep. Campion closed his eyes also, not indeed in search of  slumber, though he was travel weary ; rather the better to isolate  himself with the perplexity of his own thoughts. An indefinable  sadness invaded him, and he could envy the priest's simple logic,  which gave such short shrift to obstacles that Campion, with his  subtle melancholy, which made life to him almost morbidly an  affair of fine shades and nice distinctions, might easily exaggerate. Of the two, perhaps the priest had really the more secular mind,  as it certainly excelled Campion's in that practical wisdom, or  common sense, which may be of more avail than subtlety in the  mere economy of life. And what to the Curé was a simple matter  enough, the removal of the idle fancy of a girl, might be to  Campion, in his scrupulous temper, and his overweening tender-  ness towards just those pieties and renunciations which such a  fancy implied, a task to be undertaken hardly with relish, perhaps  without any real conviction, deeply as his personal wishes might  be implicated in success. And the heart had gone out of his journey long before a turn of the road brought them in sight of Ploumariel. Up 106  Apple Blossom in Brittany IV Up by the great, stone Calvary, where they had climbed nearly  a year before, Campion stood, his face deliberately averted, while  the young girl uttered her hesitating confidences ; hesitating, yet  candid, with a candour which seemed to separate him from the  child by more than a measurable space of years, to set him with  an appealing trustfulness in the seat of judgment—for him, for her.  They had wandered there insensibly, through apple-orchards white  with the promise of a bountiful harvest, and up the pine-clad hill,  talking of little things—trifles to beguile their way—perhaps, in a  sort of vain procrastination. Once, Marie-Ursule had plucked a  branch of the snowy blossom, and he had playfully chided her that the cider would be less by a  litre  that year in Brittany.  "But the blossom is so much prettier," she protested ; "and there  will be apples and apples—always enough apples. But I like the blossom best—and it is so soon over." And then, emerging clear of the trees, with Ploumariel lying in  its quietude in the serene sunshine below them, a sudden strenuous-  ness had supervened, and the girl had unburdened herself, speaking  tremulously, quickly, in an undertone almost passionate ; and  Campion, perforce, had listened. ... A fancy ? a whim ? Yes,  he reflected ; to the normal, entirely healthy mind, any choice of  exceptional conditions, any special self-consecration or withdrawal  from the common lot of men and women must draw down upon  it some such reproach, seeming the mere pedantry of inexperience.  Yet, against his reason, and what he would fain call his better  judgment, something in his heart of hearts stirred sympathetically  with this notion of the girl. And it was no fixed resolution, no deliberate By Ernest Dowson  107 deliberate justification which she pleaded. She was soft, and  pliable, and even her plea for renunciation contained pretty,  feminine inconsequences ; and it touched Campion strangely.  Argument he could have met with argument ; an ardent con-  viction he might have assailed with pleading ; but that note of  appeal in her pathetic young voice, for advice, for sympathy, disarmed him. "Yet the world," he protested at last, but half-heartedly, with  a sense of self-imposture ; "the world, Marie-Ursule, it has its  disappointments ; but there are compensations." "I am afraid, afraid," she murmured. Their eyes alike sought instinctively the Convent of the  Ursulines, white and sequestered in the valley—a visible symbol  of security, of peace, perhaps of happiness. "Even there they have their bad days : do not doubt it." "But nothing happens," she said simply; "one day is like  another. They can never be very sad, you know." They were silent for a time: the girl, shading her eyes with one  small white hand, continued to regard the convent ; and Campion  considered her fondly. "What can I say ?" he exclaimed at last. "What would you  put on me ? Your uncle—he is a priest—surely the most natural  adviser—you know his wishes." She shook her head. "With him it is different—I am one of  his family—he is not a priest for me. And he considers me a  little girl—and yet I am old enough to marry. Many young  girls have had a vocation before my age. Ah, help me, decide  for me !" she pleaded ; "you are my  tuteur ." "And a very old friend, Marie-Ursule." He smiled rather  sadly. Last year seemed so long ago, and the word, which he had  almost spoken then, was no longer seasonable. A note in his voice, 108  Apple Blossom in Brittany voice, inexplicable, might have touched her. She took his hand  impulsively, but he withdrew it quickly, as though her touch had  scalded him. "You look very tired ; you are not used to our Breton rambles  in this sun. See, I will run down to the cottage by the chapel  and fetch you some milk. Then you shall tell me." When he was alone the smile faded from his face and was  succeeded by a look of lassitude, as he sat himself beneath the  shadow of the Calvary to wrestle with his responsibility. Perhaps  it was a vocation : the phrase, sounding strangely on modern ears,  to him, at least, was no anachronism. Women of his race, from  generation to generation, had heard some such voice and had  obeyed it. That it went unheeded now was, perhaps, less a proof that it was silent, than that people had grown hard and deaf,  in a world that had deteriorated. Certainly the convent had to  him no vulgar, Protestant significance, to be combated for its  intrinsic barbarism ; it suggested nothing cold nor narrow nor  mean, was veritably a gracious choice, a generous effort after  perfection. Then it was for his own sake, on an egoistic impulse,  that he should dissuade her ? And it rested with him ; he had no  doubt that he could mould her, even yet, to his purpose. The  child ! how he loved her.... But would it ever be quite the  same with them after that morning ? Or must there be hence-  forth a shadow between them ; the knowledge of something  missed, of the lower end pursued, the higher slighted ? Yet, if  she loved him ? He let his head drop on his hands, murmured  aloud at the hard chance which made him at once judge and  advocate in his own cause. He was not conscious of praying, but his mind fell into that condition of aching blankness which is,  perhaps, an extreme prayer. Presently he looked down again at  Ploumariel, with its coronal of faint smoke ascending in the perfectly By Ernest Dowson  109 perfectly still air, at the white convent of the Dames Ursulines,  which seemed to dominate and protect it. How peaceful it was !  And his thought wandered to London : to its bustle and noise, its  squalid streets, to his life there, to its literary coteries, its politics,  its society ; vulgar and trivial and sordid they all seemed from  this point of vantage. That was the world he had pleaded for, and  it was into that he would bring the child.... And suddenly,  with a strange reaction, he was seized with a sense of the wisdom  of her choice, its pictorial fitness, its benefit for both of them.  He felt at once and finally, that he acquiesced in it ; that any other ending to his love had been an impossible grossness, and that  to lose her in just that fashion was the only way in which he  could keep her always. And his acquiescence was without bitter-  ness, and attended only by that indefinable sadness which to a  man of his temper was but the last refinement of pleasure. He  had renounced, but he had triumphed ; for it seemed to him that  his renunciation would be an aegis to him always against the  sordid facts of life, a protest against the vulgarity of instinct, the  tyranny of institutions. And he thought of the girl's life, as it should be, with a tender appreciation—as of something precious  laid away in lavender. He looked up to find her waiting before  him with a basin half full of milk, warm still, fresh from the cow ;  and she watched him in silence while he drank. Then their eyes  met, and she gave a little cry. "You will help me ? Ah, I see that you will ! And you  think I am right ?" "I think you are right, Marie-Ursule." "And you will persuade my uncle ?" "I will persuade him." She took his hand in silence, and they stood so for a minute,  gravely regarding each other. Then they prepared to descend.

G Second Thoughts By Arthur Moore I As the clock struck eight Sir Geoffrey Vincent cast aside the  dull society journal with which he had been beguiling the  solitude of his after-dinner coffee and cigar, and abandoned, with  an alacrity eloquent of long boredom, his possession of one of the  capacious chairs which invited repose in the dingy smoking-room  of an old-fashioned club. It had been reserved for him, after  twenty monotonous years of almost unbroken exile, spent, for the most part, amid the jungles and swamps of Lower Burma, to  realise that a friendless man, alone in the most populous city of the  world, may encounter among thousands of his peers a desolation  more supreme than the solitude of the most ultimate wilderness ;  and he found himself wondering, a little savagely, why, after all,  he had expected his home-coming to be so different from the  reality that now confronted him. When he landed at Brindisi, a  short ten days ago, misgivings had already assailed him vaguely ;  the fact that he was practically homeless, that, although not altogether bereft of kith and kin, he had no family circle to  welcome him as an addition to its circumference, had made it  inevitable that his rapid passage across the Continent should be haunted By Arthur Moore  113 haunted by forebodings to which he had not cared to assign a  shape too definite ; phantoms which he exorcised hopefully, with  a tacit reliance on a trick of falling on his feet which had seldom  failed his need. He consoled himself with the thought that  London was home, England was home ; he would meet old  comrades in the streets perhaps, assuredly at his club, and such  encounters would be so much the more delightful if they were fortuitous, unexpected. The plans which he had laid so carefully  pacing the long deck of the P. and O. boat in the starlight, or,  more remotely, lying awake through the hot night hours under a  whining punkah in his lonely bungalow, had all implied, however  vaguely and impersonally, a certain companionship. He was dimly  conscious that he had cousins somewhere in the background ; he  had long since lost touch with them, but he would look them up.  He had two nieces, still in their teens, the children of his only sister who had died ten years ago ; he had never seen them, but  their photographs were charming—they should be overwhelmed  with such benefactions as a bachelor uncle with a well-lined purse  may pleasantly bestow. His friends—the dim legion that was to  rise about his path—should take him to see Sarah Bernhardt (a  mere name to him as yet) at the Gaiety, to the new Gilbert and  Sullivan opera at the Savoy ; they should enlighten him as to the  latent merits of the pictures at Burlington House ; they should dine with him, shoot with him, be introduced to his Indian  falcons ; in a word, he would keep open house, in town and  country too, for all good fellows and their pretty wives. It had  even occurred to him, as a possibility neither remote nor unattrac-  tive, that he might himself one day possess a pretty wife to  welcome them. His sanguine expectations encountered their  rebuff when  he found the Piccadilly Club, which had figured so often in the dreams 114  Second Thoughts dreams of its exiled member, abandoned to a horde of workmen,  a mere wilderness of paint and whitewash ; and it was with a  touch of resentment that he accepted the direction of an indifferent  hall-porter to an unfamiliar edifice in Pall Mall as its temporary  substitute. Entering the smoking-room, a little diffidently, on  the evening of his arrival in London, he found himself eyed, at   with faint curiosity, by two or three of the men upon whom  his gaze rested expectantly, but in no case was this curiosity—  prompted doubtless by that touch of the exotic which sometimes  clings to dwellers in the East—the precursor of the kindly recognition, the surprised, incredulous greeting which he had  hoped for. After a few days he was simply ignored ; his face,  rather stern, with its distinctive Indian tan through which the  grey eyes looked almost blue, his erect figure, and dark hair  sparsely flecked with a frosty white, had become familiar ; he had  visited his tailor, and his garments no longer betrayed him to the  curious by their fashion of Rangoon. The Blue-book, which he had been quick to interrogate,  informed him that his old friend Hibbert lived in Portman Square,  and that the old lady who was the guardian of his nieces had a  house at Hampstead : further inquiry at the addresses thus  obtained left him baffled by the intelligence that Colonel  Hibbert was in Norway, his nieces at school in Switzerland. Mackinnon, late of the Woods and Forests, whom he met at  Burlington House, raised his hopes for an instant by a greeting  which sounded precisely the note of cordiality that he yearned for,  only to dash them by expressing a hope that he should see more  of his old friend in the autumn ; he was off to Southampton to  join a friend's yacht on the morrow, and after his cruise he had  designs on Scotland and the grouse. Sir Geoffrey, chained to the neighbourhood of London by legal business By Arthur Moore  115 business, already too long deferred, connected with the succession  which had made him a rich man and brought him home, could  only rebel mutely against the ill-fortune which left him solitary  at a time when he most longed for fellowship, acknowledging the  while, with a touch of self-reproach, that the position which he  resented was very largely due to his own shortcomings ; he had  always figured as a lamentably bad correspondent, and his invete-  rate aversion to letter-writing had allowed the links of many old  friendships to fall asunder, had operated to leave such friends as were still in touch with him in ignorance of his home-coming. Now, as he paused in the hall of his club to light a cigarette  before passing out into the pleasant July twilight, he told himself  that for the present he had done with London ; he would shake  the dust of the inhospitable city from off his feet, and go down to  the place in Wiltshire which was learning to call him master, to  await better days in company with his beloved falcons. He even  found himself taking comfort from this prospect while a hansom  bore him swiftly to the Savoy Theatre, and when he was safely  ensconced in his stall he beguiled the interval before the rising of  the curtain—a period which his impatience to escape from the club  rather than any undue passion for punctuality had made somewhat lengthy—by considering, speculatively, the chances of society  which the Willescombe neighbourhood seemed to afford. He  enjoyed the  act of the extravaganza with the zest of a man to  whom the work of the famous collaborators was an entire novelty,  his pleasure unalloyed by the fact, of which he was blissfully uncon-  scious, that one of the principal parts was played by an understudy.  His  ennui  returning with the fall of the curtain, he prepared to  spend the entr'acte in contemplation of the people who composed  the house, rather than to incur the resentment of the placid  dowagers who were his neighbours, by passing and repassing, like the 116  Second Thoughts the majority of his fellow-men, in search of the distant haven where cigarettes and drinks, obtained with difficulty, could be hastily appreciated. More than once his wandering eyes returned to a  box next the stage on a dress-circle tier, and finally they rested  rather wistfully on its occupants, or, to be more accurate, on the  younger of the two ladies who were seated in front. It was not  simply because the girl was pretty, though her beauty, the flower-  like charm of a young Englishwoman fresh from the schoolroom,  a fine example of a type not particularly rare, would have furnished  a sufficient pretext : he was struck by a resemblance, a haunting  reminiscence, which at  exercised his curiosity, and ended by  baffling and tantalising him. There was something vaguely  familiar, he thought, in the manner of her smile, the inclination of  her head as she turned now and then to address a remark to her  companion, the lady in grey, whose face was hidden from him by  the drapery at the side of the box. When she laughed, furling a  feathery fan, and throwing a bright glance back at the gentleman  whose white shirt-front was dimly visible in the background, Sir  Geoffrey felt himself on the verge of solving his riddle, but at this  point, while a name seemed to tremble on his lips, the lights of the  auditorium were lowered, and the rising of the curtain on the fairyland of the second scene diverted his attention to the stage.  Later, when he had passed into the crowded lobby, and was making  his way slowly through a jungle of pretty dresses towards the  door, he recognised in front of him the amber-coloured hair and  dainty, pale-blue opera cloak of the damsel who had puzzled him.  The two ladies (her companion of the grey dress was close at  hand) halted near the door while their cavalier passed out in search  of their carriage ; the elder lady turned, adjusting a cloud of soft  lace about her shoulders, and Sir Geoffrey was struck on the instant  by a swift thrill. Here, at last, was an old friend—that face could belong By Arthur Moore  117 belong to no one else than Margaret Addison. It was natural that  her maiden name should  occur to him, but he remembered, as  he edged his way laboriously towards her, that she had married just  after he sailed for Burma ; yes, she had married that amiable scape-  grace Dick Vandeleur, who had met his death in the hunting-field  nearly fifteen years ago. As he drew near, Mrs. Vandeleur's gaze fell upon him for a  brief instant ; he thought that she had not recognised him, but  before his spirits had time to suffer any consequent depression, her  eyes returned to him, and as he smiled in answer to the surprise  which he read in them, he saw her face flush, and then grow a little  pale, before a responsive light of recognition dawned upon it. She  took his hand silently when he offered it, eyeing him with the  same faint smile, an expression in which welcome seemed to be  gleaming through a cloud of apprehension. "I'm not a ghost," he said, laughing ; "I'm Geoffrey Vincent.  Don't be ashamed of owning that you had quite forgotten me !" "I knew you at once," she said simply. "So you are home at  last : you must come and see me as soon as you can. This is my  daughter Dorothy, and here is my brother—of course you re-  member Philip ?—coming to tell us that the carriage is waiting.  You will come, to-morrow—to prove that you are not a ghost ?  We shall expect you." II A fortnight later Sir Geoffrey was sitting in a punt, beguiling  the afternoon of a rainy day by luring unwary roach to their de-  struction with a hair-line and pellets of paste, delicately kneaded  by the taper fingers of Miss Dorothy Vandeleur. He was the guest 118  Second Thoughts guest of Mrs. Vandeleur's brother, his school friend, Philip Addison  the Q.C., and Mrs. Vandeleur and her daughter were also staying  at the delighful old Elizabethan house which nestled, with such an  air of immemorial occupation, halfway down the wooded side of  one of the Streatley hills, its spotless lawn sloping steeply to the  margin of the fairest river in the world. Miss Vandeleur had  enshrined herself among a pile of rugs and cushions at the stern of  the punt, where the roof of her uncle's boat-house afforded shelter  from the persistent rain. She was arrayed in the blue serge dear  to the modern water-nymph ; and at intervals she relieved her feel-  ings by shaking a small fist at the leaden vault of sky. For the rest, her attention was divided impartially between her novel, with  which she did not seem to make much progress, her fox-terrier  Sancho, and the slowly decreasing lump of paste, artfully compounded  with cotton-wool for consistency, with which, as occasion arose, she  ministered to her companion's predatory needs. The capture of a  fish was followed inevitably by a disarrangement of her nest of  cushions, and a pathetic petition for its instant release and restora-  tion to the element from which it had been untimely inveigled.  Occasionally, the rain varied the monotony of the dolorous drizzle  by a vehement and spirited downpour, lasting for some minutes,  prompting one of the occupants of the punt to remark, with mis-  placed confidence, that it must clear up soon, after that. Then Sir Geoffrey would abandon his rod, and beat a retreat to the stern  of the punt ; and during these interludes, much desultory conver-  sation ensued. Once, Miss Vandeleur startled her companion by  asking, suddenly, how it was that he seemed so absurdly young ? "I hope I am not rude ?" she added, "but really you do strike  me as almost the youngest person I know. You are much younger  than Jack—Mr. Wilgress—for instance, and it's only about three  years since he left Eton." Sir By Arthur Moore  119 Sir Geoffrey smiled, wondering a little whether the girl was  laughing at him ; for though a man of forty-seven, who has for  twenty years successfully resisted a trying climate, may consider  himself as very far from the burden of old age, it was conceivable  that the views of a maiden in her teens might be very different. "It's because I am having such a good time," he hazarded.  "You and your mother are responsible, you know ; before I met  you at the Savoy, on that memorable evening, I was feeling as  blue as—as the sky ought to be if it had any decency, and at least  as old as the river. I suppose it's true that youth and good spirits  are contagious." Dorothy gazed at him for a moment reflectively."How lucky  it was that Uncle Philip took us to the theatre on that evening !  It was just a chance. And we might never have met you." "It was lucky for me!" declared the other simply. "But  would you have cared ?" "Of course!" said the girl promptly, but lowering her blue  eyes. "You see, I have never known a real live hero before.  Do tell me about your fight in the hill-fort, or how you caught  the Dacoits ! Uncle Philip says that you ought to have had the  V.C." Sir Geoffrey replied by a little disparaging murmur. "Oh, it  was quite a commonplace affair—all in the day's work. Any one  else would have done the same." Dorothy settled herself back among her cushions resentfully,  clasping her hands, rather sunburned, across her knees. "I should like to see them !" she declared contemptuously.  "That's just what that Jack Wilgress said—at least he implied  it. It is true, he apologised afterwards. How I despise Oxford  boys !" "I thought he was a very good fellow," said Sir Geoffrey, diplomatically 120  Second Thoughts diplomatically turning the subject from his own achievements,  "I suppose it might improve him to have something to do ; but he  strikes me as a very good specimen of the ornamental young  man." "Ornamental !" echoed Dorothy sarcastically. " It would do  him good to have to work for his living." "Poor beggar, he couldn't help being born with a silver spoon  in his mouth—it isn't his fault." "Spoon!" exclaimed Miss Vandeleur. "A whole dinner  service I should think. A soup-ladle at the very least. It's quite  big enough : perhaps that accounts for it !" The girl laughed, swaying back, with the grace of her years,  against her cushions ; then, observing that her companion's grave  grey eyes were fixed upon her, she grew suddenlv demure, sighing  with a little air of penitence. "I am very wicked to-day," she confessed. "It's the rain, I  suppose, and want of exercise. Do you ever feel like that, Sir  Geoffrey ? Do you ever get into an omnibus and simply loathe  and detest every single person in it ? Do you long to swear—  real swears, like our army in Flanders—at everybody you meet,  just because it's rainy or foggy, and because they are all so ugly  and horrid ? I do, frequently." "I know, I know," said the other sympathetically, while he  reeled in his line and deftly untied the tiny hook. "Only, the  omnibus has not figured very often in my case ; it has generally  been a hot court-house, or a dusty dak-bungalow full of com-  mercial travellers. But I don't feel like that now, at all. I hope  I am not responsible for your frame of mind ?" "Oh," protested Dorothy, "don't make me feel such an  abandoned wretch ! I should have been much worse if you had  not been here. I should have quarrelled with Uncle Phil, or been By Arthur Moore  121 been rude to my mother, or something dreadful. I'm perfectly  horrid to her sometimes. And as it is, I have let her go up to  town all alone—to see my dressmaker." Sir Geoffrey stood up and began to take his rod to pieces.  "And are you quite sure that you haven't been 'loathing and  detesting' me all the afternoon ?" Dorothy picked up her novel and smoothed its leaves reflectively. "I—— But no. I won't make you too conceited. Look, the  sun is actually coming out ! Don't you think we might take the  Canadian up to the weir ? You really ought to be introduced to  the big chub under the bridge." The rain had almost ceased, and when they had transferred  themselves into the dainty canoe, a few strokes of the paddle  which Miss Vandeleur wielded with such effective grace swept  them out into a full flood of delicate evening sunlight. The sky  smiled blue through rapidly increasing breaks in the clouds ; the  sunbeams, slanting from the west, touched with pale gold the  quivering trees, which seemed to lift their wet branches and spread their leaves to court the warm caress. A new radiance of  colour crept into the landscape, as if it had been a picture from  which a smoky glass was withdrawn ; the water grew very still—  this too was in the manner of a picture—with the peace of a  summer evening, brimming with an unbroken surface luminously  from bank to bank. Strange guttural cries of water-birds  sounded from the reed-beds ; from the next reach came the rhythmic pulse of oars, faint splashes, and the brisk rattle of row-  locks ; voices and laughter floated down from the lock, travelling  far beyond belief in the hushed stillness of the evening. The  wake of the light canoe trailed unbroken to the shadows of the  boathouse, and the wet paddle gleamed as it slid through the  water. Presently Dorothy stayed her hand. "What 122  Second Thoughts "What an enchanting world it is !" she murmured, with wide eyes  full of the glamour of the setting sun. "Beautiful, beautiful——!  How soon one forgets the fogs, and rain, and cold ! I feel as if I  had lived in this fairyland always." Her lips trembled a little as she spoke, and Sir Geoffrey found  something in the pathos of her youth which held him silent.  When they broke the spell of silence, their words were trivial,  perhaps, but the language was that of old friends, simple and  direct. Sir Geoffrey at least, for whom the charm of the occasion  was a gift so rare that he scarcely dared to desecrate it by mental  criticism, was far from welcoming the interruption which presently  occurred, in the shape of a youth, arrayed in immaculate flannels and  the colours of a popular rowing club, who hailed them cheerfully from a light skiff, resting on his sculls and drifting alongside while  he rolled a cigarette. III Dorothy sank down, rather wearily, in the low basket-chair  which stood near the open window of her mother's bedroom—  a tall French window, with a wide balcony overrun by climbing  roses, and a view of the river, and waited for Mrs. Vandeleur to  dismiss her maid. As she lay there, adjusting absently the loose  tresses of her hair, she could feel the breath of the faint breeze as  it wandered, gathering a light burden of fragrance, through the  dusky roses ; she could see the river, dimly, where the moonbeams touched its ripples, and once or twice the sound of voices reached  her from the distant smoking-room. The closing of the door as  the maid went out disturbed her reverie, and turning a little in her  chair she found her mother regarding her thoughtfully. "No," By Arthur Moore  123 "No," said Dorothy, swiftly interpreting her mother's glance.  "You mustn't send me away, my pretty little mother. I'll promise  not to catch cold. I haven't been able to talk to you all day." Mrs. Vandeleur half closed the window, and then seated herself  with an expression of resignation on the arm of her daughter's  chair. In the dim light shed by the two candles on the dressing-  table, one would have thought them two sisters, plotting innocently  the discomfiture of man. The occasion did not prove so stimu-  lating to conversation as might have been expected. For a few  minutes both were silent ; Dorothy began to hum an air from the  Savoy opera, rather recklessly ; she kicked off one of her slippers,  and it fell on the polished oak floor with a little clatter. "Little donkey !" murmured her mother sweetly. "So much  for your talking. I'm going to bed at once." Then she added,  carelessly, "Did you see Jack to-day ?" The humming paused abruptly ; then it went on for a second,  and paused again. "Oh yes, the inevitable Mr. Wilgress was on the river, as  usual. He nearly ran us down in that idiotic skiff of his." Mrs. Vandeleur raised her eyebrows, gazing at her unconscious  daughter reflectively. "You didn't see him alone, then ?" she inquired presently. "Who ? Mr. Wilgress ? Ye-es, I think so. When we got  back to the boathouse he insisted on taking me out again in the  canoe, to show me the correct Indian stroke. Much he knows  about it ! That's why I was so late for dinner. Oh, please  don't talk about Mr. Wilgress." "Mr. Wilgress again?" murmured Mrs. Vandeleur. "I  thought it always used to be 'Jack.'" "Only, only by accident, said the girl weakly. "And when  he wasn't there." "Well, 124  Second Thoughts "Well, he isn't here now. At least I hope not. You—you  haven't quarrelled, have you Dolly ?" "No—yes. I don't know. He—he asked me—oh, he was  ridiculous. How I hate boys—and jealousy." Mrs. Vandeleur shivered, then rose abruptly and closed the  window against which she leaned, gazing down at the formless  mass of the shrubs which cowered over their shadows on the lawn.  Her mind, vaguely troubled for some days past, and now keenly on  the alert, travelled swiftly back, bridging a space of nearly twenty  years, to a scene strangely like this, in which she and her mother  had held the stage. She too, a girl then of Dorothy's eighteen  years, had brought the halting story of her doubts and scruples to  her natural counsellor : she could remember still how the instinct of reticence had struggled with the yearning for sympathy, for the  comfort of the confessional. She could recall now and appreciate  her mother's tact and patient questioning, her own perversity, the  dumbness which seemed independent of her own volition. A  commonplace page of life. Two men at her feet, and the girl  unskilled to read her heart : one had spoken—that was Dick  Vandeleur, careless, brilliant, the heir to half a county ; the other — her old friend ; she could not bear to think of him now. Knowledge had come too late, and the light which made her  wonder scornfully at her blindness. And her mother—she of  course had played the worldly part ; but her counsel had been  honest, without bias : it were cruel to blame her now. Loyal  though she was, Margaret Vandeleur had asked herself an hundred  times, yielding to that love of threading a labyrinth which rules  most women, what would have been the story of her life if she had  steeled herself to stand or fall by her own judgment, if she had refused to allow her mother to drop into the wavering scale the  words which had turned it, ever so slightly, in favour of the richer By Arthur Moore  125 richer man, the man whom she had married, whose name she  bore. It seemed plain enough, to a woman's keen vision—what sense  so subtle, yet so easily beguiled—that Dorothy's choice was  embarrassed, just as her own had been. The girl and her two  admirers—how the old story repeated itself !—one, Jack Wilgress,  the good-natured, good-looking idler, whose devotion to the river  threatened to make him amphibious, and whose passion for scribbling verse bade fair to launch him adrift among the cockle-  shell fleet of Minor Poets ; the other—Geoffrey Vincent ! To  call upon Margaret Vandeleur to guide her daughter's choice  between two men of whom Geoffrey Vincent was one—surely  here was the end and crown of Fate's relentless irony. She felt  herself blushing as she pressed her forehead against the cool  window-pane, put to shame by the thoughts which the comparison suggested, which would not be stifled. Right or wrong, at least  her mother had been impartial : there was a sting in this, a  failure of her precedent. She sighed, concluding mutely that silence  was her only course ; even if she would, she could not follow in her  mother's footsteps—the girl must abide by her own judgment. When she turned, smiling faintly, the light of the flickering  candles fell upon her face, betraying a pallor which startled  Dorothy from her reverie. She sprang from her chair, reproaching  her selfishness. "You poor, tired, little mother," she murmured penitently, with  a hasty kiss. "How could I be so cruel as to keep you up after  your journey ! I'm a wretch, but I'm really going now. Good-  night." "Good-night," said her mother, caressing the vagrant coils of the  girl's amber-coloured hair. "Don't worry yourself; everything  will come right if—if you listen to your own heart." Dorothy's 126  Second Thoughts Dorothy's answer was precluded by another kiss. "It's so full  of you that it can't be bothered to think of any one else," she  declared plaintively, as she turned towards the door. Then she  paused, fingering nervously a little heap of books which lay upon  a table. "He—he isn't so very old, you know," she murmured  softly before she made her escape. When she was alone Mrs. Vandeleur sank into the chair which  her daughter had just quitted, nestling among the cushions and  knitting her brows in thought. The clock on the mantelpiece  had struck twelve before she rose, and then she paused for an  instant in front of the looking-glass, gazing into it half timidly  before she extinguished the candles. The face which she saw  there was manifestly pretty, in spite of the trouble which lurked in  the tired eyes, and when she turned away, a hovering smile was struggling with the depression at the corners of the delicate,  mobile lips. IV When Sir Geoffrey returned to Riverside, three days later,  after a brief sojourn in London, spent for the most part at the  office of his solicitor in Lincoln's Inn, he found Mrs. Vandeleur  presiding over a solitary tea-table in a shady corner of the garden.  A few chairs sociably disposed under the gnarled walnut-tree, and  a corresponding number of empty tea-cups, suggested that her  solitude had not been of long duration, and this impression was  confirmed when Mrs. Vandeleur told her guest that if he had  presented himself a short quarter of an hour earlier he would have been welcomed in a manner more worthy of his deserts. Sir Geoffrey drew one of the low basket chairs up to the table, protesting, By Arthur Moore  127 protesting, as he accepted a cup of tea, that he could not have  wished for better fortune. "This is very delightful," he declared. "I don't regret the  tardiness of my train in the least. The other charming people are  on the river, I suppose ?" Mrs. Vandeleur nodded. "Yes, the Patersons have just taken  up their quarters in that house-boat, which you must have noticed,  near the lock, and my brother and Dorothy have gone with Jack  Wilgress and his sisters to call upon them. You ought to have  seen Daisy Wilgress ; she is very pretty." Sir Geoffrey smiled gravely, sipping his tea. "If she is prettier than your daughter, Miss Wilgress must be  very dangerous. But I must see her with my own eyes before I  believe that." "Oh, she is !" declared Mrs. Vandeleur, laughing lightly, but  throwing a quick glance at him. "Ask Philip; he is more  wrapped up in her than he has been in anything since his   brief." "Poor Philip !" said the other quietly, stooping to pick a fallen  leaf from the grass at his feet. "I—I have a fellow-feeling for  him." "You know you may smoke if you want to," interposed Mrs.  Vandeleur, rather hurriedly. "And perhaps—if you really won't  have any more tea—you might like to go in pursuit of the other  people ; I don't think they have taken all the boats. But I  daresay you are tired ? London is so fatiguing—and business." Sir Geoffrey smiled, his white teeth showing pleasantly against  the tan of his lean, good-humoured face. "I  am  rather tired, I believe," he owned. "I have been  spending a great deal of time in my solicitor's waiting-room, pretending to read  The Times . And I have been thinking—that is The Yellow Book—Vol. III.  H always 128   Second Thoughts always fatiguing. If I am not in your way, I should like to stay  here." Mrs. Vandeleur professed her satisfaction by a polite little  murmur, leaning forward in her chair to marshal the scattered  tea-cups on the tray, while Sir Geoffrey watched her askance,  rather timidly, with a keen appreciation of the subtle charm of her  personality ; her face, like a perfect cameo, or some rare pale flower,  seeming to have gained rather in beauty by the deliberate passage  from youth ; winning, just as some pictures do, an added grace of  refinement, a delicacy, which the slight modification of contours  served only to intensify. "I told you just now that I had been thinking," he said  presently, when she had resumed her task of embroidering initials  in the corner of a handkerchief : "would it surprise you if I said  that I had been thinking of you ?" Mrs. Vandeleur raised her eyebrows slightly, her gaze still intent  upon her patient needle. "Perhaps it was natural that you should think of us," she  hazarded. "But I meant you," he continued ; "you, the Margaret of the  old days, before I went away. For I used to call you 'Margaret'  then. We were great friends, you know." "I have always thought of you as a friend," she said simply.  "Yes, we were great friends before—before you went away." "It doesn't seem so long ago to me," he declared, almost plain-  tively, struck by something in the tone of her voice. Mrs.  Vandeleur smiled tolerantly, scrutinising her embroidery, with  her head poised on one side, a little after the manner of a  bird. "And now that I have found you again," he added with inten-  tion, dropping his eyes till they rested on the river, rippling past the By Arthur Moore  129 the wooden landing-stage below in the sunshine, "I—I don't  want to lose you, Margaret !" Mrs. Vandeleur met this declaration with a smile, which was  courteous rather than cordial, merely acknowledging, as of right,  the propriety of the aspiration, treating it as quite conventional.  The simplicity of the gesture testified eloquently of the discipline  of twenty years ; only a woman would have detected the shadow  of apprehension in her eyes, the trembling of the hands which  seemed so placidly occupied. Her mind was already anxiously on the  alert, racing rapidly over the now familiar ground which she had  quartered of late so heedfully. For her, his words were ominous ;  it was of Dorothy surely that he wished to speak, and yet——! In the stress of expectation her thoughts took strange flights,  following vague clues fantastically. The inveterate habit of retro-  spection carried her back, in spite of her scruples; her honest desire  to think singly of Dorothy, regarding the fortune of her own  life as irrevocably settled, impelled her irresistibly to call to the  stage of her imagination a scene which she had often set upon it,  a duologue, entirely fictive, which might, but for her perversity,  have been enacted—twenty years ago. Sir Geoffrey rose, and stood leaning with one hand on the back  of his chair. This interruption—or perhaps it was the sound of  oars and voices which floated in growing volume from the river—  served to recall his companion to the present. The silence, of  brief duration actually, seemed intolerable. She must break it,  and when she spoke it was to name her daughter, aimlessly. "Dorothy ?" repeated Sir Geoffrey, as she paused. "She is  extraordinarily like you were before I went away. Not that you  are changed—it is delightful to come back and find you the same.  It's only when she is with you that I can realise that there is a  difference, a——" "I was 130   Second Thoughts "I was never so good as Dorothy," put in Mrs. Vandeleur  quickly ; "she will never have the same reason to blame her-  self—— I don't think you could imagine what she has been  to me." "I think I can," said Sir Geoffrey simply. Then he added,  rather shyly : "Really, we seem to be very good friends already :  it's very nice of her—it would be so natural for her to—to resent  the intrusion of an old fellow like me." "You need not be afraid of that ; she looks upon you as—as a  friend already." "Thank you !" murmured the other. "And you think she  might grow to—to like me, in time ?" Mrs. Vandeleur nodded mutely. Sir Geoffrey followed for a  moment the deliberate entry and re-entry of her needle, reflect-  ively ; then, as his eyes wandered, he realised vaguely that a boat  had reached the landing-stage, and that people were there : he  recognised young Wilgress and Miss Vandeleur. "You said just now that you always thought of me as a friend,"  he began. "I wonder—— Oh ! it's no good," he added quickly,  with a nervous movement of his hands, "I can't make pretty  speeches ! After all, it's simple ; why should I play the coward ?  I can take 'no' for answer, if the worst comes to the worst,  and—— Margaret, I know it's asking a great deal, but—I want you to marry me." She cast a swift, startled glance at him, turning in her chair,  and then dropped her eyes, asking herself bewilderedly whether this  was still some fantasy. The words which he murmured now,  pleading incoherently with her silence, confirmed the hopes which,  in spite of her scrupulous devotion, refused to be gainsaid, thrusting  themselves shamelessly into the foreground of her troubled thoughts.  An inward voice, condemned by her wavering resolution as a whisper By Arthur Moore  131 whisper from the lips of treachery, suggested plausibly that after  all Dorothy might have made a mistake ; she repelled it fiercely,  taking a savage pleasure in her pain, accusing herself, with vehe-  ment blame, as one who would fain stand in the way of her  daughter's happiness. Even if she had deserved these fruits of late  harvest which seemed to dangle within her grasp, even if her  right to garner them had not been forfeited long ago by her  folly of the past, how could she endure to figure as a rival, triumphing in her own daughter's discomfiture ? Womanly  pride and a thousand scruples barred the way. "I love you," she heard him say again ; "I believe I have  always loved you since—— But you know how it was in the  old days." "Don't remind me of that !" she pleaded, almost fiercely ; "I  was—I can't bear to think of what I did ! You ought not to  forgive me ; I don't deserve it." "Forgive ?" he echoed, blankly. "Oh, you are generous—but it is impossible, impossible ; it is  all a mistake ; let us forget it." "I don't understand ! Is it that—that you don't care for me ?" Margaret gave a despairing little sigh, dropping her hands on  the sides of her chair. "You don't know," she murmured. "It isn't right. No—  oh, it must be No !" Sir Geoffrey echoed her sigh. As he watched her silently, the  instinct of long reticence making his forbearance natural, he saw  a new expression dawn into her troubled face. Her eyes were  fixed intently on the river ; that they should be fixed was not  strange, but there was a light of interest in them which induced  Sir Geoffrey, half involuntarily, to bend his gaze in the same  direction. He saw that Dorothy had now disembarked, and was standing, 132  Second Thoughts standing, a solitary figure, close to the edge of the landing-stage. Something in her pose seemed to imply that she was talking, and  just at this moment she moved to one side, revealing the head and  shoulders of Jack Wilgress, which overtopped the river-bank in  such a manner as to suggest that he was standing in the punt, of  which the bamboo pole rose like a slender mast above his head.  The group was certainly pictorial : the silhouette of Dorothy's  pretty figure telling well against the silvery river, and the young  man's pose, too, lending itself to an effective bit of composition ;  but Sir Geoffrey felt puzzled, and even a little hurt, by the interest  that Margaret displayed at a moment which he at least had found  sufficiently strenuous. He turned, stooping to pick up his hat ; then he paused, and was about to speak, when Mrs. Vandeleur  interrupted him, mutely, with a glance, followed swiftly by the  return of her eyes to the river. Acquiescing patiently, Sir  Geoffrey perceived that a change had occurred in the grouping of  the two young people. Wilgress had drawn nearer to the girl ;  his figure stood higher against the watery background, apparently  he had one foot on the step of the landing-stage. Dorothy extended a hand, which he clasped and held longer than one would  have reckoned for in the ordinary farewell. The girl shook her  head ; another movement, and the punt began to glide reluctantly  from the shore ; then it turned slowly, swinging round and  heading down-stream. Dorothy raised one hand to the bosom of  her dress, and before she dropped it to her side threw something  maladroitly towards her departing companion. Wilgress caught the flower—it was evidently a flower—making a dash which  involved the loss of his punt-pole ; a ripple of laughter, and  Dorothy, unconscious of the four eyes which watched her from  the shadows of the walnut tree, turned slowly, and began to climb  the grassy slope. Mrs. Vandeleur's By Arthur Moore  133 Mrs. Vandeleur's eyelids drooped, and her lips, which had been  parted for an instant in a pensive smile, trembled a little ; she  sighed, tapping the ground lightly with her foot, then sank back in  her chair and seemed lost in contemplation of the needlework that  lay upon her lap. Sir Geoffrey began to move away, but turned  suddenly, and stooping, took one of her hands reverently in his  own, clasping it as it lay upon the arm of her chair. "Margaret," he said, "forgive me; but must it be good-bye,  after all these years, or is there a chance for me ?" Mrs. Vandeleur's reply was inaudible ; but her hand, though it  fluttered for a moment, was not withdrawn. Twilight By Olive Custance Mother of the dews, dark eyelashed Twilight !  Low-lidded Twilight o'er the valley's brim.  MEREDITH. SPIRIT of Twilight, through your folded wings I catch a glimpse of your averted face, And rapturous on a sudden, my soul sings "Is not this common earth a holy place ?" Spirit of Twilight, you are like a song That sleeps, and waits a singer, like a hymn That God finds lovely and keeps near Him long, Till it is choired by aureoled cherubim. Spirit of Twilight, in the golden gloom Of dreamland dim I sought you, and I found A woman sitting in a silent room Full of white flowers that moved and made no sound. These By Olive Custance  135 These white flowers were the thoughts you bring to all, And the room's name is Mystery where you sit, Woman whom we call Twilight, when night's pall You lift across our Earth to cover it. Three Pictures By Walter Sickert I. Collins's Music Hall, Islington II. The Lion Comique III. Charley's Aunt Tobacco Clouds By Lionel Johnson CLOUD upon cloud : and, if I were to think that an image of  life can lie in wreathing, blue tobacco smoke, pleasant  were the life so fancied. Its fair changes in air, its gentle  motions, its quiet dying out and away at last, should symbolise  something more than perfect idleness. Cloud upon cloud : and I  will think, as I have said : it is amusing to think so. It is that death, out and away upon the air, which charms me :  charms more than the manner of the blown red rose, full of dew  at morning, upon the grass at sunset. The clouds' end, their  death in air, fills me with a very beauty of desire ; it has no  violence in it, and it is almost invisible. Think of it ! While  the cloud lived, it was seemly and various ; and with a graceful  change it passed away : the image of a reasonable life is there,  hanging among tobacco clouds. An image and a test : an image, because elaborated by fancy : a true and appealing image, and so,  to my present way of life, a test. That way is, to walk about the old city, with "a spirit in my  feet," as Shelley and Catullus have it, of joyous aims and energies ;  and to speed home to my solitary room over the steep High  Street ; in an arm-chair, to read Milton and Lucretius, with  others. There is nothing unworthy in all this : there is open air, an 144  Tobacco Clouds an ancient city, a lonely chamber, perfect poets. Those should  make up a passing life well : for death ! I can watch tobacco  clouds, exploring the secret of their beautiful conclusion. And,  indeed, I think that already this life has something of their  manner, those wheeling clouds ! It has their light touch upon  the world, and certainly their harmlessness. Early morning,  when the dew sparkles red ; honey, and coffee, and eggs for a breakfast ; the quick, eager walk between the limes, through the  Close of fine grass, to the river fields ; then the blithe return to  my poets ; all that, together, comes to resemble the pleasant  spheres of tobacco cloud ; I mean, the circling hours, in their  passage, and in their change, have something of a dreamy order  and progression. Such little incidents ! Now, grey air and  whistling leaves : now, a marketing crowd of country folk round the Cross : and presently, clear candles ; with Milton, in  rich Baskervile type, or Lucretius, in the exquisite print of early  Italy. Such little incidents, in a world of battles and of plagues : of  violent death by sea and land ! Yet this quiet life, too, has diffi-  culties and needs : its changes must be gone through with a  ready pleasure and a mind unhesitating. For, trivial though they  be in aspect and amount, yet the consecration of them, to be an  holy discipline of experience, is so much the greater an attempt :  it is an art. Each thing, be it man, or book, or place, should  have its rights, when it encounters me : each has its proper  quality, its peculiar spirit, not to be misinterpreted by me in carelessness, nor overlooked with impatience. That is clear : but  neither must I vaunt my just view of common life. Meditation,  at twilight, by the window looking toward the bare downs, is  very different from that anxious examination of motives, dear to  sedulous souls. My meditation is only still life : the clouds of smoke By Lionel Johnson  145 smoke go up, grey and blue ; the earlier stars come out, above  the sunset and the melancholy downs ; and deep, mournful bells  ring slowly among the valley trees. Then, if my day have been  successful, what peace follows, and how profound a charm ! The  little things of the day, sudden glances of light upon grey stone,  pleasant snatches of organ music from the church, quaint rustic  sights in some near village : they come back upon me, gentle  touches of happiness, airs of repose. And when the mysteries come about me, the fearfulness of life, and the shadow of night ;  then, have I not still the blue, grey clouds,  occultis de rebus quo  referam ? So I escape the tribulations of doubt, those gloomy  tribulations : and I live in the strength of dreams, which never  doubt. Is it all a delusion ? But that is a foolish wonder : nothing is  a delusion, except the extremes of pleasure and of pain. Take  what you will of the world ; its crowds, or its calms : there is  nothing altogether wrong to every one. Lucretius, upon his  watch-tower, deny it as he may, found some exultation and  delight in the lamentable prospect below : it filled him with a  magnificent darkness of soul, a princely compassion at heart. And Milton, in his evil days, felt himself to be tragic and austere :  he knew it, not as a proud boast, but as a proud fact. No ! life  is never wrong, altogether, to every one : you and I, he and she,  priest and penitent, master and slave : one with another, we  compose a very glory of existence before the unseen Powers.  Therefore, I believe in my measured way of life ; its careful  felicities, fashioned out of little things : to you, the change of  Ministries, and the accomplishment of conquests, bring their  wealth of rich emotion : to me, who am apart from the louder concerns of life, the flowering of the limes, and the warm autumn  rains, bring their pensive beauty and a store of memories. Is 146   Tobacco Clouds Is it I, am indolent ? Is it you, are clamorous ? Why should  it be either ? Let us say, I am the lover of quiet things, and  you are enamoured of mighty events. Each, without undue  absorption in his taste, relishes the savour of a different ex-  perience. But I think, I am no egoist : no melancholy spectator of  things, cultivating his intellect with old poetry, nourishing his  senses upon rural nature. There are times, when the swarms of  men press hard upon a solitary ; he hears the noise of the streets,  the heavy vans of merchandise, the cry of the railway whistle :  and in a moment, his thoughts travel away, to London, to Liver-  pool ; to great docks and to great ships ; and away, till he is  watching the dissimilar bustle of Eastern harbours, and hearing the discordant sounds of Chinese workmen. The blue smoke curls  and glides away, with blue pagodas, and snowy almond bloom, and  cherry flowers, circling and gleaming in it, like a narcotic vision.  O magic of tobacco ! Dreams are there, and superb images, and  a somnolent paradise. Sometimes, the swarms of humanity press  wearily and hardly ; with a cruel insistence, crushing out my right  to happiness. I think, rather I brood, upon the fingers that  deftly rolled the cigarette, upon the people in tobacco plantations,  upon all the various commerce involved in its history : how do  they all fare, those many workers ? Strolling up and down, devouring my books through their lettered backs ; remembering  the workers with leather, paper, ink, who toiled at them, they  frighten me from the peace. What a full world it is ! What  endless activities there are ! And, oh, Nicomachean Ethics !  how much conscious pleasure is in them all ! Things, mere  tangible things, have a terrible power of education : of calling out  from the mind innumerable thoughts and sympathies. Like childish catechisms and categories— Whence have we sago? —plain substances By Lionel Johnson  147 substances introduce me to swarms of men, before unrealised.  And they all lived and died, and cared for their children, or not,  and led reasonable lives, or not : and, without any alternative, had  casual thoughts and constant passions. Did each one of them  ever stop in his work, and think that the world revolved about  him alone ; and all was his, and for him ? Most men may have  thought so, and shivered a little afterwards ; and worked on  steadily. Or did each one of them ever think that he was always beset with companions, hordes of men and women, necessary and  inevitable ? Then, he must have struggled a little in his mind, as  a man fights for air, and worked on steadily. It does not do :  this interrogation of mysteries, which are also facts. Nor am I  called upon, from without or from within, to write an Essay upon  the Problem of Economic Distribution.  Praesentia temnis  !  Nature says to me : it is the stir of the world, and the great play  of forces, that I am wailing, to no end. Let the great life  continue, and the sun shine upon bright palaces ; and geraniums,  red geraniums, glow at the windows of dingy courts ; death and  sorrow come upon both, and upon me. And on all sides there is infinite tenderness ; the invincible good-will, which says kind and cheerful things to every one sometimes, by a friend's mouth ; the  humane pieties of the world, which make glad the  Civitas Dei ,  and make endurable the  Regnum Hominis . I need not make  myself miserable. Full night at last ; the dead of night, as dull folk have it ;  ignorant persons, who know nothing of nocturnal beauty, of night's  lively magic. It was a good thought, to come out of my lonely  room, to look at the cloisters by moonlight, and to wander round  the Close, under the black shadows of the buttresses, while the  moon is white upon their strange pinnacles. There is no noise,  but only a silence, which seems very old ; old, as the grey monu- ments 148  Tobacco Clouds ments and the weathered arches. The wreathing, blue tobacco  clouds look thin and pale, like breath upon a dark frosty night ;  they drift about these old precincts, with a kind of uncertainty and  discomfort ; one would think, they wanted a rich Mediterranean  night, heavy odours of roses, and very fiery stars. Instead, they break  upon mouldering traceries, and doleful cherubs of the last century;  upon sunken headstones, and black oak doors with ironwork over  them. Perhaps the cigarette is southern and Latin, southern and  Oriental, after all; and I am a dreamer, out of place in this northern  grey antiquity. If it be so, I can taste the subtle pleasures of contrast:  and, dwelling upon the singular features of this old town, I can  make myself a place in it, as its conscious critic and adopted alien. There is a curious apprehension of enjoyment, a genuine  touch of luxury, in this nocturnal visit to these old northern  things ! I consider, with satisfaction, how the Stuart king, who  spurned tobacco contumeliously, put a devoted faith in witches,  those northern daughters of the devil ; northern, and very different  from the dames of Thessaly ; from the crones of Propertius, and  of Horace, and of Apuleius the Golden. Who knows, but I may  hear strange voices in the near aisle before cockcrow ? By  night, night in the north, happen cold and dismal things ; and  then, what a night is this ! Chilly stars, and wild, grey clouds,  flying over a misty moon. At last, here comes a great and solemn sound ; the commanding  bells of the cathedral tower, in their iron, midnight toll. Through  the sombre strokes, and striking into their long echoes, pierce  the thin cries of bats, that wheel in air, like lost creatures who  hate themselves ; the uncanny flitter-mice ! They trace superb,  invisibles circles on the night ; crying out faintly and plaintively,  with no sort of delight in their voices : things of keen teeth, furry  bodies, and skeleton wings covered scantily in leather. The big moths By Lionel Johnson  149 moths, too : they blunder against my face, and dash red trails of  fire off my cigarette ; so busily they spin about the darkness. Sadducismus triumphatus  ! Yes, truly : here are little, white  spirits awake and at some faery work ; white, as heather upon the  Cornish cliffs is white, and all innocent, rare things in heaven and  earth. There is nothing dreadful, it seems, about this night, and this place ; no glorious fury of evil spirits, doing foul and ugly  things ; only the quiet town asleep under a wild sky, and gentle  creatures of the night moving about ancient places. And the  wind rises, with a sound of the sea, murmuring over the earth  and sighing away to the sea : the trembling sea, beyond the downs,  which steals into the land by great creeks and glimmering  channels ; with swaying, taper masts along them, and lantern  lights upon black barges. Certainly, this is no Lucretian night :  not that tremendous Nox, et noctis signa severa Noctivagaeque faces caeli, flammaeque volantes. Rather, it reminds me of the Miltonic night, which is peopled  alluringly with "faery elves, Whose midnight revels by a forest side Or fountain, some belated peasant sees, Or dreams he sees, while overhead the moon Sits arbitress :" a Miltonic night, and a Shakespearean dawn ; for the white  morning has just peered along the horizon, white morning, with  dusky flames behind it ; and the spirits, the visions, vanish away,  "following darkness, like a dream." The streets are very still, with that silence of sleeping cities,  which seems ready to start into confused cries ; as though the The Yellow Book—Vol. III.  I Smiter 150  Tobacco Clouds Smiter of the born were travelling through the households.  There is the Catholic chapel, in its Georgian, quaint humility ;  recalling an age of beautiful, despised simplicity ; the age of  French emigrant old priests and vicars-apostolic, who stood for  the Supreme Pontiff, in grey wigs. The sweet limes are swaying  against its singular, umbered windows, with their holy saints and  prophets in last-century design ; ruffled, querulous persons looking  very bluff and blown. I wonder, how it would be inside ; I  suppose, night has a little weakened that lingering smell of daily incense, which seems so immemorial and so sad. Wonderful  grace of the mighty Roman Church ! This low square place,  where the sanctuary is poor and open, without any mystical touch  of retirement and of loftiness, has yet the unfailing charm, the  venerable mystery, which attend the footsteps of the Church ; the  same air of command, the same look of pleading, fill this homely,  comfortable shrine, which simple country gentlemen set up for the  ministrations of harassed priests, in an age of no enthusiasm. I like  to think that this quiet chapel, in the obedience of Rome, in communion with that supreme apostolate, is always open to me  upon this winding little by-street ; it fills me with perfect  memories, and it seems to bless me. But here is a benediction of light ! the quick sun, reddening  half the heavens, and rising gloriously. In the valley, clusters of  elm rock and swing with the breeze, quivering for joy : far away,  the bare uplands roll against the sunrise, calm and pastoral;  otia dia of the morning. Surely the hours have gone well, and according  to my preference ; one dying into another, as the tobacco clouds  die. My meditations, too, have been peaceful enough ; and,  though solitary, I have had fine companions. What would the  moral philosophers, those puzzled sages, think of me ? An harm-  less hedonist ? An amateur in morals, who means well, though meaning By Lionel Johnson  151 meaning very little ? Nay ! let the moralist by profession give, to  whom he will,  sa musique, sa flamme  : to any practical person, who  is a wise shareholder and zealous vestryman. For myself, my  limited and dreamy self, I eschew these upright businesses ; upright  memories and meditations please me more, and to live with as little action as may be. Action : why do they talk of action ?  Match me, for pure activity, one evening of my dreams, when life  and death fill my mind with their messengers, and the days of old  come back to me. And now, homewards, for a little sleep ; that  profound and rich slumber at early dawn which is my choice  delight. A sleep, bathed in musical impressions, and filled with  fresh dreams, all impossible and happy ; four hours, and five, and  six perhaps : then the cathedral matin bell will chime in with my  fancies, and I shall wake harmoniously. I shall feel infinitely cheerful, after the spirit of the  Compleat Angler  ; I shall remember  that I was once at Ware, and at Am well, those placid haunts of  Walton. A conviction of beauty, and contentment in life will lay hold on me, more than commonly ; it is probable that I shall read The Spectator , and Addison, rather than Steele, at breakfast. And  I know which paper it will be : it will be about  Will Wimble coming up to the house, with two or three hazel twigs in his hand, fresh cut in  Sir Roger' s woods. Or, if I prove faithful to my great  Lucretius : the man, not the book, for I read him in the Giuntine :  I will read that marvellous  It ver et Venus  ; that dancing masque  of beauty. For  L'Allegro , I do not read that ; it is read aloud to  me by the morning, with exquisite, bright cadences. After my  honey from the flowers of a very rustic farm, and my coffee, from  some wonderful Eastern place ; and my eggs, marked by the careful  housewife as she took them from her henhouse, covered with  stonecrop over its old tiles ; after all these delicates, now comes the   cigarette, pungent and exhilarating. As the grey blue clouds 152  Tobacco Clouds clouds go up, the ruddy sunlight glows through them, straight as  an arrow through the gold. Away they wander, out of the window,  flung back upon the air, against the roses, and disappear in the  buoyant morning. My thoughts go with them, into the morning, into all the  mornings over the world. They travel through the lands, and  across the seas, and are everywhere at home, enjoying the presence  of life. And past things, old histories, are turned to pleasant  recollections : a  pot-pourri , justly seasoned, and subtly scented ;  the evil humours and the monstrous tyrannies pass away, and leave  only the happiness and the peace. Call me, my dear friend, what reproachful name you please ;  but, by your leave, the world is better for my cheerfulness. True,  should the terrible issues come upon me, demanding high courage,  and finding but good temper, then give me your prayers, for I  have my misdoubts. Till then, let me cultivate my place in life,  nurturing its comelier flowers ; taking the little things of time  with a grateful relish and a mind at rest. So hours and years pass  into hours and years, gently, and surely, and orderly ; as these  clouds, grey and blue clouds, of tobacco smoke, pass up to the air, and away upon the wind ; incense of a goodly savour, cheering  the thoughts of my heart, before passing away, to disappear at  last. Reiselust By Annie Macdonell NAY, Love, but stay thy blame ; For if men have their claim, The day's but theirs— Poor gift, the day of heat and cares ! Thou hast the night, the calm cool night, When the soul's garden blooms in sight, With roses tinted by the moon's soft smile, On that far fringed horizon isle. The night, the long sweet night is thine, Then I awake, and find thee, soul of mine. Ah, rushing hours beneath the sun ! Ah, fevered crying haste, have done ! Yet let your coursing swifter run ! Now let the still night fall. I hear the water lapping 'gainst the wall, I open wide my door unto the sea Whence Death, thy keeper, brings thee back to me. So mild he waits without, yet laughs at Life, That cannot give her hirelings such a wife. Day 154  Reiselust Day, have I not paid the toll ? My body given the whole That will let pass my soul ? The roses of the morn lie thick on my Love's bier, And she is risen ; she is no longer here. A star upon the stern she beckons me. Sweet Death, one dawn, let me go back with thee, Sweet Death, take me from out the noisy light Into thy night, thy comforting still night. Yea, soon, for my Love's sake, Sweet Death my hand will take, And I shall not awake Till past the blooming isle. Then shall my eyelids quiver 'neath her smile, And I shall gaze, and from my Love's clear eyes Shall learn her slow wide learning, and be wise, Shall learn the speech they speak across the sea : Tis a large language my Love speaks to me. Then far beyond to sail, And further further coasts to hail, And ventures shall not fail. And missionary dreams my Love and I We ll hover mid the world's troubled sky, And sleeping men to discontent shall tease, To venture further skies and wider seas. Have I not guessed the meaning of the dark ? Thy hand, O Death ! To-night let me embark. "To Every Man a Damsel or Two" By C. S. HE wandered up the carpeted steps, rather afraid all the while of  the two tall men in uniform who opened the great doors wide  to let him into the soft warm light and babble of voices within. At  the top he paused, and slowly unbuttoned his overcoat, not know-  ing which way to turn ; but the crowd swept him up, and carried  him round, until he found himself leaning against a padded wall  of plush, looking over a sea of heads at the stage far beneath.  He turned round, and stood watching the happy crowd, which  laughed, and talked, and nodded ceaselessly to itself. Near him, on a sofa, with a table before her, was a woman spreading herself  out like some great beautiful butterfly on a bed of velvet pansies.  He stood admiring her half unconsciously for some time, and at  last, remembering that he was tired and sleepy, and seeing that  there was still plenty of room, he threaded his way across and sat  down. The butterfly began tossing a wonderful little brown satin shoe,  and tapping it against the leg of the table. Then the parasol  slipped across him, and fell to the ground. He hastened to pick  it up, lifting his hat as he did so. She seemed surprised, and  glancing at a man leaning against the wall, caught his eye, and  they both laughed. He blushed a good deal, and wondered what he 156  "To Every Man a Damsel or Two" he had done wrong. She spread herself out still further in his  direction, and cast side glances at him from under her Gains-  borough. "What were you laughing at just now ?" he said impulsively. "My dear boy, when ?" "With that man." "Which man ?" "It doesn't matter," he said, blushing again. She looked up, and winked at the man leaning against the  wall. "Have I offended you by speaking to you ?" he said, looking  with much concern into her eyes. She put a little scented net of a handkerchief up to her mouth,  and went into uncontrollable fits of laughter. "What a funny boy you are !" she gasped. "Do do it again." He looked at her in amazement, and moved a little further  away. "I'm going to tell the waiter to bring me a port—after that  last bit of business." "I don't understand all this," he said desperately : "I wish I  had never spoken to you ; I wish I had never come in here  at all." "You're very rude all of a sudden. Now don't be troublesome  and say you're too broke to pay for drinks," she added as the  waiter put the port down with great deliberation opposite her, and  held out the empty tray respectfully to him. He stared. "Why don't you pay, you cuckoo ?" Mechanically he put down a florin, and the waiter counted out  the change. There was a pause. She fingered the stem of her wine-glass,  taking little sips, and watching him all the while. "How By C. S.  157 "How often have you been here before ?" she said, suddenly  catching at his sleeve. "You must tell me. I fancy I know your  face : surely I've met you before somewhere ?" "This is the  time I have ever been to a music-hall," he  said doggedly. She drank off her port directly. "Come—come away at once. Yes, all right—I'm coming with  you ; so go along." "But I've only just paid to come in," he said hesitatingly. "Never mind the paying," and she stamped her little satin foot,  "but do as I tell you, and go." And taking his arm, she led him  through the doors down to the steps, where the wind blew cold,  and the gas jets roared fitfully above. "Go," she said, pushing him out, "and never come here again ;  stick to the theatres, you will like them best." And she ran up  the steps and was gone. He rushed after her. The two tall men in uniform stepped  before the doors. "No re-admission, sir," said one, bowing respectfully and  touching his cap. "But that lady," he said, bewildered, and looking from one to  the other. The men laughed, and one of them, shrugging his shoulders,  pointed to the box-office. He turned, and walked down the steps. Was it all a dream ?  He glanced at his coat. The flower in his buttonhole had gone. A Song and a Tale By Nora Hopper I—Lament of the Last Leprechaun FOR the red shoon of the Shee, For the falling o' the leaf, For the wind among the reeds, My grief !

For dishonoured whitethorn-tree, For the runes that no man reads, Where the grey stones face the sea, My grief !

For By Nora Hopper  159 For the empty fairy shoon, Hollow rath and yellow leaf; Hands unkissed to sun or moon : My grief—my grief ! II—Aonan-na-Righ AINAN-NA-RIGH they called him in Tir Ailella*—"Darling  of the King"—but it was in idle sport, for Cathal the Red  hated the son of his old age as men now have forgotten to hate ;  and once Aonan had sprung from his sleep with a sharp skene  thrust through his arm, that had meant to drink his life-blood ;  and once again he had found himself alone in the heart of the  battle, and he had scarcely won out of the press with his life—and  with the standard of the Danish enemy. Thus it was seen that  neither did the Danish spears love the "King's Darling"; and the sennachies made a song of this, and it was chanted before the  King for the  time when he sat robed and crowned for the  Beltane feast, and Aonan stood at his left hand, pouring out  honey-wine into his father's cup. And before he drank, Cathal  the King stared hard at the cup-bearer, and the red light that  burned in his eyes was darkened because of the likeness in  Aonan's face to his mother Acaill (dead and buried long since),  whom Cathal had loved better than his  wife Eiver, who was  a king's daughter, and better than the Danish slave Astrild, who  bore him five sons, elder and better-loved than Aonan, for all the  base blood in their veins. And of these, two were dead in the  battle that had spared Aonan, and there were left to Cathal the * Now Tirerrill, Co. Sligo. King 160  A Song and a Tale King only the Druid Coloman, and Toran the boaster, and  Guthbinn of the sweet voice, who as yet was too young to fight. "Drink, Aonan-na-Righ," shrilled Astrild from her seat at the  King's left hand. "Drink : lest there be death in the cup." Aonan took up the golden cup, and gave her back smile for  smile. "I drink," he said, "to my mother, Acaill of Orgiall." But the King snatched the cup from his fingers, and dashed it  down on the board, so that the yellow mead spilled and stained  Astrild's cloak ; but she did not dare complain, for there was the  red light in Cathal's eyes that was wont to make the boldest  afraid. "Bring me another cup," he said to one that stood near.  "And now, will none of ye do honour to the toast of Aonan-na-  Righ ? Bring ye also a cup for the prince ; and, Guthbinn, put  your harp aside." So in silence they drank to the memory of Acaill of Orgiall,  and afterwards they sought to spin together the threads of their  broken mirth, but not easily, for Astrild, who was wont to be  gayest, sat pale, with her hand on the knife hidden in her breast ;  and the King sat dumb and frowning, thinking, as Astrild knew,  of dead Acaill : how he had loved and hated her, and, having slain  her father and brothers, and brought her to Dunna Scaith a Golden  Hostage wearing a golden chain, he had wedded her for her  beauty's sake ; and how until her child was born she had never so  much as smiled or frowned for him ; and how, when her babe lay  in her arms, she sent for her husband, and said : "I thank thee,  Cathal, who hast set me free by means of this babe. I bless thee  for this last gift of thine, who for all thine other gifts have cursed  thee." And Cathal remembered how he had held babe and mother to his heart, and said : "Good to hear soft words from thy  mouth at last, O Acaill ! Speak again to me, and softly. But she By Nora Hopper  161 she had not answered, for her  soft words to him were her  last. And Astrild, watching him, saw his face grow black and  angry, and she smiled softly to herself, and aloud she said : "Oh, Guthbinn, sing again, and sing of thy brothers who fell  to-day—sing of Oscar, the swift in battle, and Uaithne, of the  dark eyes. And will my lord give leave that I, their mother, go  to weep for them in my own poor house where they were born ?" "No," said Cathal. "I bought you and your tears, girl, with  gold rings, from Ocaill of Connaught. Sing to me now, and keep  thy tears for to-morrow." So Astrild drove back her sorrow, and  began to sing, while her son Guthbinn plucked slow music from his  harpstrings. "Earrach, Samhradh, Foghmhar, and Geimhridh, Are over all and done : And now the web forgets the weaver, And earth forgets the sun. I sowed no seed, and pulled no blossom, Ate not of the green corn : With empty hands and empty bosom, Behold, I stand forlorn. Windflower I sang, and Flower o' Sorrow, Half-Summer, World's Delight : I took no thought o' the coming morrow, No care for the coming night." Guthbinn's hand faltered on the harpstrings, and the singer stopped swiftly : but King Cathal stayed the tears in her heart with an  angry word. "Have I had not always had my will ? And it is  not my will now for you to weep." So Astrild sat still, and she  looked at her sons : but Toran was busy boasting of the white  neck and blue eyes of the new slave-girl he had won, and Coloman was 162  A Song and a Tale was dreaming, as he sat with his eyes on the stars that showed  through the open door : and only Guthbinn met her eyes and  answered them, though he seemed to be busy with his harp. And  presently Cathal rose up, bidding all keep their seats and finish  out the feast, but Astrild and Aonan he bade follow him. And  so they went into the farthest chamber of the House of Shields,  which looked upon a deep ditch. Now the end of the chamber  was a wall of wattles, and here there was cut a door that led out  on a high bank which overlooked the ditch. And the King went  out upon the bank, where there was a chair placed ready for him,  and Astrild sat at his knee, and Aonan-na-Righ stood a little way off. And Cathal sat still for a time, holding Astrild's hand  in his, and presently he said : "Who put the death in the cup  to-night, Astrild, thou or Guthbinn ?" And Astrild tried to  draw her hand away and to rise, but he held her in her place, and  asked again, "Guthbinn, or thou ?" until she answered him  sullenly as she knelt, "King, it was I." "Belike, Guthbinn's hand did thy bidding," he said, in laughing  fashion. "Was the death for me or for Aonan yonder, thou Red-  Hair ?" And Astrild laughed as she answered, "For Aonan-na-Righ,  my lord." And then she shrieked and sought to rise, for she saw  death in the king's face as it bent over her. "If thou hadst sought to slay thy master, Red-Hair, I might  have forgiven thee," Cathal said ; "but what had my son to do  with thee, my light-o'-love ?" "Give me a day," Astrild said desperately, "and I will kill father  and son, and set the light-o'-love's children on your throne, Cathal." "I doubt it not, my wild-cat, but I will not give ye the day :"  Cathal laughed. "Good courage, girl—and call thy Danish gods  to aid, for there is none other to help thee, now." "What By Nora Hopper  163 "What will my lord do?" Aonan said quickly, as the Dane  turned a white face and flaming eyes to him. "Wouldst kill  her ?" "Ay," said Cathal the King. "But  she shall leave her  beauty behind her, lest she meet thy mother in the Land of Youth,  and Acaill be jealous." "Leave her beauty and breath, lord," Aonan said, drawing  nearer. "If my mother Acaill lived she would not have her slain.  My king, she pleased thee once ; put her from thee if she vexes  thee now ; but leave her life, since something thou owest  her." "She would have slain thee to-day, Aonan, and if I have dealt  ill by thee, I let no other deal thus. Yet if thou prayest me for  thy life, girl, for love of Acaill I will give it thee." And Cathal laughed, for he knew the Dane would not plead in  that name. Astrild laughed too. "Spare thy breath, son of  Acaill," she said scornfully. "To-morrow the cord may be round  thy neck, and thou be in need of breath ; now lord, the cord for  mine——" Cathal smiled grimly. "Blackheart," he said, "thou hast no lack of courage. Now  up," and he loosened her hands, "and fly if thou wilt—swim the  ditch, and get thee to Drumcoll-choille—and Guthbinn shall die  in thy stead. What ! Thou wouldst liefer die ? Back then to  yonder chamber, where my men will deal with thee as I have  ordered, and be as patient as in thee lies. A kiss , Red-Hair ;  and hearken from yonder chamber if thou wilt, while Aonan sings  a dirge for thee." She went ; and presently there rang from within the chamber  the shrill scream of a woman's agony, and Cathal laughed to see  Aonan's face turn white. "She is not as patient as thou," he said, 164  A Song and a Tale said, "but she will learn. Keep thou my word to her, Aonan ;  sing a dirge for her beauty a-dying." "I cannot sing," Aonan-na-Righ said, shivering as there rose  another shriek. "Let them slay her, my lord, and have done." "My will runs otherwise," said Cathal, smiling. "Sing, if  thou lovest thy life." "My lord knows that I do not," Aonan answered ; and Cathal  smiled again. "Belike not ; but sing and lessen the Dane's punishment.  When the song is finished she shall be released, and even tended  well." So Aonan sang the song of the Dane-land over the water, and  the Danes that died in the Valley of Keening—which is now called  Waterford ; of the white skin and red hair of Astrild ; of her  grace and daring ; of the sons that lay dead on the battle-place ;  of Coloman the dreamer that read the stars ; and of the beautiful  boy whose breast was a nest of nightingales. And then he sang—  more softly—of the Isle of the Noble where Acaill dwelt, and how  she would have shadowed Astrild with her pity if she had lived ;  and then he stopped singing and knelt before the King, dumb for  a moment with the passion of his pity, for from the open door  they could hear a woman moaning still. "Lord," he said, "make an end. My life for hers—if a life  the King must have ; or my pain for hers—if the King must needs  feed his ears with cries." "Graciously spoken, and like Acaill's son," King Cathal said.  "And Astrild shall be set free. You within the chamber take  the Dane to her son the lord Coloman's keeping ; and thou, my  son Aonan, tarry here till I return. I may have a fancy to send  thee with a message to thy mother before dawn. Nay, but come  with me, and we will go see Coloman, and ask how his mother does. By Nora Hopper  165 does. Give me thine arm to lean on ; I am tired, Aonan, I am old,  and an end has come to my pleasure in slaying .... Coloman !" They were in Coloman's chamber now, and the Druid turned  from star-gazing to greet the King, with a new dark look in his  gentle face. "Coloman, how does thy mother do now ? She had  grown too bold in her pride, but we did not slay her because of  Aonan here. How works our medicine that we designed to  temper her beauty ?" "Well, lord. No man will kiss my mother's beauty more." "Good : now she will turn her feet into ways of gentleness,  perhaps. Thou boldest me a grudge for this medicine o' mine,  my son Coloman ?" "Lord, she is my mother," the Druid said, looking down. "The scars will heal," Cathal said ; "but—Aonan here has only  seen her beautiful. Coloman, wouldst thou have him see her  scarred and foul to see ?" "No, lord," the Druid said fiercely. Cathal laughed. "Have a gift of me, then, O Coloman," he said. "Spare him  from sight of a marred beauty, in what way thou canst. I give  thee his eyes for thy mother's scars." The two young men looked at each other steadily : then  Aonan spoke. "Take the payment that the King offers thee,  Coloman, without fear : a debt is a debt." "And the debt is heavy." Coloman said hoarsely : "Lord, wilt thou go and leave Aonan-  na-Righ to me ? And wilt thou send to me thy cunning men,  Flathartach and Fadhar ? I must have help." "Aonan-na-Righ will not hinder thee, Coloman," said the  King, mockingly. "He desires greatly to meet with his mother :  and do thou commend me also to the Lady Eivir, whom I wedded  , and who loved me well." The Yellow Book—Vol. III.  K "Call 166  A Song and a Tale "Call me also to thy mother's memory," Toran the boaster  cried presently, when all was made ready, and Coloman bade draw  the irons from the brazier—"if thou goest so far, Darling of the  King." "I will remember," Aonan said : and then fire and flesh met. * * * * * At the next Beltane feast Cathal the Red slept beside Acaill in  the burial-place of the kings at Brugh, and Guthbinn sat in the  high seat, Toran the boaster at his right hand. But Coloman the  Druid stood on the tower-top, reading the faces of the stars ; and  along the road that wound its dusty way to the country of the  Golden Hostages there toiled two dark figures : a woman and a  man. Now the woman was hooded and masked, but under the  grey hood the moonlight found a gleam of ruddy hair ; and the  man she led by the hand and watched over as a mother watches  her son. Yet the woman was Danish Astrild, and the blind man  was Aonan-na-Righ. "De Profundis" By S. Cornish Watkins THE hot white road winds on and on before, The hot white road fades into haze behind, With clinging dust each hedge is powdered o'er, The sun is high, no shelter can we find. A dusty bird upon a dusty spray Sings o'er and o'er a little dreary song, There is no rest, no rest, the livelong day, And we are weary, and the way is long. We know not whence we come, or whither wend, What goal may be to which our journey draws, Fate binds this burden on us, and the end We know not, care not, and we must not pause. A motley train we move. The young, the old, Women and men, with feeble steps or strong, Driven, like herded sheep, from fold to fold— Oh, we are weary, and the way is long. Vain whispers have we known, and hopes as vain ; And one, he bore a banner with a cross, And spake wild words of comfort after pain, And future gain to balance present loss. But 168  "De Profundis" But where he is we wot not. We have lost All hopes we had, all faiths or right or wrong, We have been shaken, shattered, tempest-tost, And we are weary, and the way is long. Yet still, within each bosom smoulders there Some little spark that might have been divine, Something that will not let us quite despair, Something we cannot, if we would, resign. Some day the spark may quicken and may guide, And fire the soul within us, dead so long, So may there be, when falls the eventide, A joyous ending to a grievous song. Two Pictures By P. Wilson Steer I. The Mirror II. Skirt Dancing A Study in Sentimentality By Hubert Crackanthorpe A PHANTOM regiment of giant mist-pillars swept silently  across the valley ; beaded drops loaded each tuft of coarse,  dull-tinted grass ; the peat-hags gaped like black, dripping flesh-  wounds in the earth's side; the distance suggested rectangular fields  and wooded slopes—vague, grey, phantasmagoric ; and down over  everything floated the damp of fine rain. Alec's heavy tread crunched the turfed bridle-path rhythmically,  and from the stiff rim of his clerical hat the water dribbled on to  his shoulders. It was a rugged, irregular, almost uncouth face, and now the  features were vacantly huddled in a set expression, obviously  habitual. The cheeks were hunched up, almost concealing the  small eyes ; a wet wisp of hair straggled over the puckered  forehead, and the ragged, fair moustache was spangled by the  rain. At his approach the sheep scampered up the fell-side ; then,  stood staring through the mist in anxious stupidity. And Alec,  shaking the water from his hat, strode forward with an almost  imperceptible gleam on his face. It was so that he liked the valley —all colourless and blurred, with the sky close overhead, like a low,  leaden ceiling. By-and-by 176   A Study in Sentimentality By-and-by, a cluster of cottages loomed ahead—a choppy pool  of black slate roofs, wanly a-glimmer in the wet. As he entered  the village, a group of hard-featured men threw him a curt  chorus of greetings, to which he raised his stick in response,  mechanically. He mounted the hill. Three furnace-chimneys craned their  thin necks to grime the sky with a dribbling, smoky breath ;  high on a bank of coal-dust, blurred silhouettes of trucks stood  waiting in forlorn strings ; women, limp, with unkempt hair,  and loose, bedraggled skirts, stood round the doorways in gossiping  groups. "Which is Mrs. Matheson's ?" he stopped to ask. "There—oop there, Mr. Burkett—by yon ash—where them  childer's standin'," they answered, all speaking together, eagerly.  "Look ye ! that be Mrs. Matheson herself." Alec went up to the woman. His face clouded a little, and the  puffs from his pipe came briskly in rapid succession. "Mrs. Matheson, I've only just heard——Tell me, how did  it happen ?" he asked gently. She was a stout, red-faced woman, and her eyes were all bloodshot  with much crying. She wiped them hastily with the corner of  her apron before answering. "It was there, Mr. Burkett, by them rails. He was jest playin'  aboot in t'road wi' Arnison's childer. At half-past one, t'grand-  moother stepped across to fetch me a jug o' fresh water an'  she see'd him settin' in door there. Then—mabbee twenty minutes  later—t' rain coome on an' I thought to go to fetch him in.  But I could'na see na sign of him anywhere. We looked oop  and doon, and thought, mabbee, he'd toddled roond to t' back.  An' then, all at once, Dan Arnison called to us that he was leein'  in t' water, doon in beck-pool. An' Dan ran straight doon, an' carried By Hubert Crackanthorpe  177 carried him oop to me ; but t'was na use. He was quite cold  and drownded. An' I went——" But the sobs, rising thickly,  swallowed the rest. Alec put his hand on her shoulder soothingly. "Ay, I know'd ye'd be grieved, Mr. Burkett. He was the  bonniest boy in all t' parish." She lifted the apron to her eyes again, while he crossed to the railings. The wood of the posts was splintered and worm-eaten,  and the lower rail was broken away. Below, the rock shelved  down some fifteen feet to the beck-pool, black and oily-looking. "It's a very dangerous place," he said, half to himself. "Ay, Mr. Burkett, you're right," interrupted a bent and  wizened old woman, tottering forward. "This be grandmoother, Mr. Burkett," Mrs. Matheson ex-  plained. "'Twas grandmoother that see'd him last——" "Ay, Mr. Burkett," the old woman began in a high, tremulous  treble. "When I went fer to fill t' jug fer Maggie he was  a-settin' on t' steps there playin with t' kitten, an' he called after  me, 'Nanny !' quite happy-like ; but I took na notice, but jest  went on fer t' water. I shawed Mr. Allison the broken rail  last month, when he was gittin' t' rents, and I told him he  ought to put it into repair, with all them wee childer playin' all  daytime on t' road. Didn't I, Maggie?" Mrs. Matheson  assented incoherently. "An' he was very civil-like, was Mr.  Allison, and he said he'd hev' it seen to. It's alus that way, Mr. Burkett," the old woman concluded, shaking her head wisely.  "Folks wait till some accident occurs, and then they think to  bestir themselves." Alec turned to the mother, and touched her thick, nerveless hand. "There, there, Mrs. Matheson, don't take on so," he said. At 178  A Study in Sentimentality At his touch her sobbing suddenly ceased, and she let her apron fall. "Will ye na coome inside, Mr. Burkett ?" she asked. And they all three went in together. The little room had been scrubbed and tidied, and a number of  chairs, ranged round the table, blocked the floor. "We've bin busy all marnin', gitting' things a bit smartened  oop for t'inquest. T' coroner's cooming at twelve," the grand-  mother explained. "Will ye coome oopstairs, Mr. Burkett—jest—jest to tak' a  look at him ? " Mrs. Matheson asked in a subdued voice. Alec followed her, squeezing his burly frame up the narrow,  creaking staircase. The child lay on the clean, white bed. A look of still serenity  slept on his pallid face. His tawny curls were smoothed back,  and some snowdrops were scattered over the coverlet. All was  quite simple. Mrs. Matheson stood in the doorway, struggling noisily with  her sobs. "It is God's will," Alec said quietly. "He was turned four last week," she blurted out. "Ye'll  excuse me, Mr. Burkett, but I'm that overdone that I jest canna'  help myself," and she sank into a chair. He knelt by the dead child's side and prayed, while the slow  rise and fall of the mother's sobs rilled the room. When he rose  his eyes were all moist. "God will help you, if you ask Him. His ways are secret. We  cannot understand His purpose. But have faith in Him. He has  done it for the best," he said. "Ay, I know, I know, Mr. Burkett. But ye see he was the  youngest, and that bonny——" "Let By Hubert Crackanthorpe  179 "Let me try to comfort you," he said. ***** When they came downstairs again, her face was calmer and her  voice steadier. The coroner, a dapper man with a bright-red tie,  was taking off his gloves and macintosh ; the room was fast filling  with silent figures, and the old grandmother was hobbling to and  fro with noisy, excited importance. "Will ye na' stay for t' inquest ?" Alec shook his head. "No, I can't stop now. I have a School-  board meeting to go to. But I will come up this afternoon." "Thank'ee, Mr. Burkett, God bless thee," said Mrs. Matheson. He shook hands with the coroner, who was grumbling con-  cerning the weather ; then strode out back down the valley. Though long since he had grown familiar with the aspects of  suffering, that scene in the cottage, by reason of its very simplicity,  had affected him strangely. His heart was full of slow sorrow for  the woman's trouble, and the image of the child, lying beautiful  in its death-sleep, passed and repassed in his mind. By-and-bye, the moaning of the wind, the whirling of lost  leaves, the inky shingle-beds that stained the fell-sides, inclined his  thoughts to a listless brooding. Life seemed dull, inevitable, draped in sombre, drifting shadows,  like the valley-head. Yet in all good he saw the hand of God, a  mysterious, invisible force, ever imperiously at work beneath the  ravages of suffering and of sin. It was close upon six o' clock when he reached home. He was  drenched to the skin, and as he sat before the fire, dense clouds of  steam rose from his mud-stained boots and trousers. "Now, Mr. Burkett, jest ye gang and tak off them things,  while I make yer tea. Ye'll catch yer death one of these days—  I know ye will. I sometimes think ye haven't more sense than a boy, 180  A Study in Sentimentality a boy, traipsin' about all t' day in t' wet, and niver takin' yer meals proper-like." A faint smile flickered across his face. He was used to his  landlady's scoldings. "A child was drowned yesterday in the beck up at Beda  Cottages. I had to go back there this afternoon to arrange about  the funeral," he mumbled, half-apologetically. Mrs. Parkin snorted defiantly, bustling round the table as she  spread the cloth. Presently she broke out again : "An' noo, ye set there lookin' as white as a bogle. Why  don't ye go an' git them wet clothes off. Ye're fair wringin'." He obeyed ; though the effort to rise was great. He felt  curiously cold : his teeth were clacking, and the warmth from the  flames seemed delicious. In his bedroom a dizziness caught him, and it was a moment  before he could recognise the familiar objects. And he realised  that he was ill, and looked at himself in the glass with a dull, scared  expression. He struggled through his dressing however, and went  back to his tea. But, though he had eaten nothing since the  morning, he had no appetite ; so, from sheer force of habit, he lit  a pipe, wheeling his chair close to the fire. And, as the heat penetrated him, his thoughts spun aimlessly  round the day's events, till these gradually drifted into the back-  ground of his mind, as it were, and he and they seemed to have  become altogether detached. His forehead was burning, and a  drowsy, delicious sense of physical weakness was stealing over his  limbs. He was going to be ill, he remembered ; and it was with  vague relief that he looked forward to the prospect of long days of  monotonous inactivity, long days of repose from the daily routine  of fatigue. The details of each day's work, the accomplishment  of which, before, had appeared so indispensable, now, he felt in his lassitude, By Hubert Crackanthorpe  181 lassitude, had faded to insignificance. Mrs. Parkin was right :  he had been overdoing himself; and with a clear conscience he  would take a forced holiday in bed. Things in the parish would  get along without him till the end of the week. There was  only the drowned child's funeral, and, if he could not go, Milner,  the neighbouring vicar, would take it for him. His pipe slipped  from his hand to the hearthrug noiselessly, and his head sank  forward. . . . He was dreaming of the old churchyard. The trees were  rocking their slim, bare arms ; drip, drip, drip, the drops pattered  on to the tombstones, tight-huddled in the white, wet light of the  moon ; the breath of the old churchyard tasted warm and moist,  like the reek of horses after a long journey. The child's funeral was finished. Mrs. Matheson had cried  noisily into her apron ; the mourners were all gone now ; and  alone, he sat down on the fresh-dug grave. By the moonlight he  tried to decipher the names carved on the slabs ; but most of the  letters had faded away, and moss-cushions had hidden the rest.  Then he found it—"George Matheson, aged four years and five  days," and underneath were carved Mrs. Matheson's words :  "He was the bonniest boy in all the parish." He sat on, with  the dread of death upon him, the thought of that black senseless-  ness ahead, possessing him, so sudden, so near, so intimate, that it  seemed entirely strange to have lived on, forgetful of it. By-  and-bye, he saw her coming towards him—Ethel, like a figure from a picture, wearing a white dress that trailed behind her,  a red rose pinned at the waist, and the old smile on her lips. And  she came beside, him, and told him how her husband had gone  away for ever, and he understood at once that he and she were  betrothed again, as it had been five years ago. He tried to answer  her, but somehow the words would not come ; and, as he was striving 182  A Study in Sentimentality striving to frame them, there came a great crash. A bough  clattered down on the tombstones ; and with a start he awoke. A half-burned coal was smoking in the fender. He felt as if he  had been sleeping for many hours. He fell to stupidly watching the red-heat, as it pulsed through  the caves of coal, to imagining himself climbing their ashen mountain-ridges, across dark defiles, up the face of treacherous precipices. . . . Hundreds of times, here, in this room, in this chair, before this  fire, he had sat smoking, picturing the old scenes to himself,  musing of Ethel Fulton (Ethel Winn she had been then ; but,  after her marriage, he had forced himself to think of her as bearing  her husband's name—that was a mortification from which he had  derived a sort of bitter satisfaction). But now, with the long  accumulation of his solitude—five years he had been vicar of  Scarsdale—he had grown so unconscious of self, so indifferent to  the course of his own existence, that every process of his mind  had, from sheer lack of external stimulation, stagnated, till, little  by little, the growth of mechanical habit had come to mould its  shape and determine its limitations. And hence, not for a  moment had he ever realised the grip that this habit of senti-  mental reminiscence had taken on him, nor the grotesque extent  of its futile repetition. Such was the fervour of his attitude  towards his single chapter of romance. Five years ago, she and he had promised their lives to one  another. And the future had beckoned them onward, gaily,  belittling every obstacle in its suffusion of glad, alluring colour.  He was poor : he had but his curate's stipend, and she was used to  a regular routine of ease. But he would have tended her wants,  waiting on her, watching over her, indefatigably ; chastening all  the best that was in him, that he might lay it at her feet. And together, By Hubert Crackanthorpe  183 together, hand in hand, they would have laboured in God's service.  At least so it seemed to him now. Then had come an enforced separation ; and later, after a  prolonged, unaccountable delay, a letter from her explaining, in  trite, discursive phrases, how it could never be—it was a mistake —she had not known her own mind—now she could see things  clearer—she hoped he would forgive and forget her. A wild determination to go at once to her, to plead with her,  gripped him ; but for three days he was helpless, bound fast by  parish duties. And when at last he found himself free, he had  already begun to perceive the hopelessness of such an errand, and,  with crushed and dogged despair, to accept his fate as irrevocable. In his boyhood—at the local grammar-school, where his ugli-  ness had made him the butt of his class, and later, at an insignificant  Oxford college, where, to spare his father, whose glebe was at the  time untenanted, he had set himself grimly to live on an impossibly  slender allowance—at every turn of his life, he had found himself  at a disadvantage with his fellows. Thus he had suffered much,  dumbly—meekly many would have said—without a sign of resent-  ment, or desire for retaliation. But all the while, in his tenacious,  long-suffering way, he was stubbornly inuring himself to an  acceptance of his own disqualifications. And so, once rudely  awakened from his dream of love, he wondered with heavy  curiosity at his faith in its glamorous reality, and, remembering  the tenour of his life, suffered bitterly like a man befooled by his  own conceit. Some months after the shattering of his romance, the rumour  reached him that James Fulton, a prosperous solicitor in the town,  was courting her. The thing was impossible, a piece of idle  gossip, he reasoned with himself. Before long, however, he heard  it again, in a manner that left no outlet for doubt. It 184  A Study in Sentimentality It seemed utterly strange, unaccountable, that she, whose eager  echoing of all his own spiritual fervour and enthusiasm for the  work of the Church still rang in his ears, should have chosen a  man, whose sole talk had seemed to be of dogs and of horses, of  guns and of game ; a man thick-minded, unthinking, self-com-  placent ; a man whom he himself had carelessly despised as devoid  of any spark of spirituality. And, at this moment, when the  smartings of bitter bewil-  derment were upon him, the little living of Scarsdale fell vacant,  and his rector, perhaps not unmindful of his trouble, suggested  that he should apply for it. The valley was desolate and full of sombre beauty ; the parish, sparsely-peopled but extensive ; the life there would be monotonous, almost grim, with long hours of lonely brooding. The living was  offered to him. He accepted it excitedly. And there, busied with his new responsibilities, throwing him-  self into the work with a suppressed, ascetic ardour, news of the  outside world reached him vaguely, as if from afar. He read of her wedding in the local newspaper : later, a few  trite details of her surroundings ; and then, nothing more. But her figure remained still resplendent in his memory, and, as  time slipped by, grew into a sort of gleaming shrine, incarnating  for him all the beauty of womanhood. And gradually, this incar-  nation grew detached, as it were, from her real personality, so that,  when twice a year he went back to spend Sunday with his old  rector, to preach a sermon in the parish church, he felt no shrink-  ing dread lest he should meet her. He had long ceased to bear any  resentment against her, or to doubt that she had done what was  right. The part that had been his in the little drama seemed  altogether of lesser importance. ***** All By Hubert Crackanthorpe  185 All night he lay feverishly tossing, turning his pillow aglow  with heat, from side to side ; anxiously reiterating whole inco-  herent conversations and jumbled incidents. At intervals, he was dimly conscious of the hiss of wind-swept  leaves outside, and of rain-gusts rattling the window-panes ; and  later, of the sickly light of early morning streaking the ceiling  with curious patterns. By-and-bye, he dropped into a fitful sleep,  and forgot the stifling heat of his bed. Then the room had grown half full of daylight, and Mrs.  Parkin was there, fidgetting with the curtains. She said some-  thing which he did not hear, and he mumbled that he had slept  badly, and that his head was aching. Some time later—how long he did not know—she appeared again,  and a man, whom he presently understood to be a doctor, and who  put a thermometer, the touch of which was deliciously cool, under  his armpit, and sat down at the table to write. Mrs. Parkin  and he talked in whispers at the foot of the bed : they went away ;  Mrs. Parkin brought him a cup of beef-tea and some toast ; and  then he remembered only the blurred memories of queer, un-  finished dreams. Consciousness seemed to return to him all of a sudden ; and,  when it was come, he understood dimly that, somehow, the fatigue of  long pain was over, and he tasted the peaceful calm of utter lassitude. He lay quite still, his gaze following Mrs. Parkin, as she moved  to and fro across the room, till it fell on a basket-full of grapes  that stood by the bedside. They were unfamiliar, inexplicable ;  they puzzled him ; and for awhile he feebly turned the matter  over in his mind. Presently she glanced at him, and he lifted his  hand towards the basket. "Would ye fancy a morsel o' fruit noo ? 'Twas Mrs. Fulton  that sent 'em," she said. The Yellow Book—Vol. III.  L She 186  A Study in Sentimentality She held the basket towards him, and he lifted a bunch from it.  They were purple grapes, large and luscious-looking. Ethel had  sent them. How strange that was ! For an instant he doubted  if he were awake, and clutched the pillow to make sure that it was  real. "Mrs. Fulton sent them ?" he repeated. "Ay, her coachman came yesterday in t' forenoon to inquire  how ye were farin', and left that fruit for ye. Ay, Mr. Burkett,  but ye've had a mighty quantity o' callers. Most all t' parish has  been askin for news o' ye. An' that poor woman from t' factory  cottages has been doon forenoon and night." "How long have I been in bed ?" he asked after a pause. "Five days and five nights. Ye've bin nigh at death's door,  ravin' and moanin' like a madman. But, noo, I must'na keep ye  chatterin'. Ye should jest keep yeself quiet till t' doctor coomes.  He'll be mighty surprised to find ye so much improved, and in  possession of yer faculties." And she left him alone. He lay staring at the grapes, while excitement quickened every  pulse. Ethel had sent them—they were from Ethel—Ethel had  sent them through his brain, to and fro, boisterously, the thought  danced. And then, he started to review the past, dispassionately,  critically, as if it were another man's ; and soon, every detail, as he  lingered on it, seemed to disentangle itself, till it all achieved a curious  simplification. The five years at Scarsdale became all blurred : they  resembled an eventless waste-level, through which he had been  mechanically trudging. But the other day, it seemed, he was with  her—he and she betrothed to one another. A dozen scenes passed  before his eyes : with a flush of hot, intolerable shame, he saw  himself, clumsy, uncouth, devoid of personal charm, viewing her  bluntly, selfishly through the cumbrous medium of his own personality. By Hubert Crackanthorpe  187 personality. And her attitude was clear too : the glamour, woven  of habitual, sentimental reminiscence, faded, as it were, from her  figure, and she appeared to him simply and beautifully human ;  living, vibrating, frail.  Now  he knew the meaning of that last  letter of hers—the promptings of each phrase ; the outpourings of  his ideals, enthusiasms, aspirations—callow, blatant, crude, he named them bitterly—had scared her : she had felt herself unequal  to the strain of the life he had offered her : in her loveable,  womanish frailty, she had grown to dread it ; and he realised all  that she had suffered before she had brought herself to end it—the  long struggles with doubt and suspense. The veil that had  clogged his view was lifted : he knew her now : he could read  the writing on her soul : he was securely equipped for loving her ;  and now, she had passed out of his life, beyond recall. In his  blindness he had not recognised her, and had driven her away. How came it that to-day, for the  time, all these things were  made clear ? The clock struck ; and while he was listening to its fading  note, the door-handle clicked briskly, and the doctor walked in.  He talked cheerily of the crops damaged by the storm, and the  sound of his voice seemed to vibrate harshly through the  room. "There's a heavy shower coming up," he remarked. "By the  way, you're quite alone here, Mr. Burkett, I believe. Have you  no relatives whom you would like to send for ?" "No—no one," Alec answered. "Mrs. Parkin will look after  me." "Yes—but you see," and he came and sat down by the bedside,  "I don't say there's any immediate danger ; but you've had a very  near touch of it. Now isn't there any old friend ?—you ought  not to be alone like this." He spoke the last words with emphasis. Alec 188  A Study in Sentimentality Alec shook his head. His gaze had fallen on the basket of  grapes again : he was incoherently musing of Ethel. "Mind, I don't say there's any immediate danger," he heard the  man repeating; "but I must tell you that you're not altogether  out of the wood yet." He paused. "You ought to be prepared for the worst, Mr. Burkett." The last phrase lingered in Alec's mind ; and slowly its  meaning dawned upon him. "You mean I might die at any moment ? " he asked. "No, no—I don't say that," the other answered evasively.  "But you see the fever has left you very weak ; and of course in  such cases one can never be quite sure——" The rest did not reach Alec's ears ; he was only vaguely aware  of the murmur of the man's voice. Presently he perceived that he had risen. "I will come back in the afternoon," he was saying. "I'll tell  Mrs.—Mrs. Parker to bring you in some breakfast." After the doctor had gone he dozed a little . . . Then remembered the man's words—"No immediate danger,  but you must be prepared for the worst." The sense of it all  flashed upon him : he understood what the man had meant : that  was the way doctors always told such things he guessed. So the  end was near . . . He wondered, a little curiously, if it would  come before to-night, or to-morrow ... It was near, quite near,  he repeated to himself; and gradually, a peacefulness permeated  his whole being, and he was vaguely glad to be alone. . . . A little while, and he would be near God. He felt himself  detached from the world, and at peace with all men. His life, as he regarded it trailing behind him, across the stretch  of past years, seemed inadequate, useless, pitiable almost ; of his own By Hubert Crackanthorpe  189 own personality, as he now realised it, he was ashamed—petty mortifications, groping efforts, a grotesque capacity for futile, melancholy brooding—he rejoiced that he was to have done with  it. The end was near, quite near, he repeated once again. Then, afterwards, would come rest—the infinite rest of the  Saviour's tenderness, and the strange, wonderful expectation  of the mysterious life to come . . . A glimpse of his own serenity, of  his own fearlessness, came to him ; and he was moved by a quick  flush of gratitude towards God. He thought of the terror of the  atheist's death—the world, a clod of dead matter blindly careering  through space ; humanity, a casual, senseless growth, like the  pullulating insects on a rottening tree. . . . A little while, only a little while, and he would be near God.  And, softly, under his breath, he implored pardon for the countless shortcomings of his service. . . . The German clock on the mantel-piece ticked with methodical  fussiness : the flames in the grate flickered lower and lower ; and one  by one dropped, leaving dull-red cinders. Through the window,  under the half-drawn blind, was the sky, cold with the hard, white  glare of the winter sun, flashing above the bare, bony mountain-  backs ; and he called to mind spots in the little, desolate parish,  which, with a grim, clinging love, he had come to regard as his  own for always. Who would come after him, live in this house  of his, officiate in the square, grey-walled church, move and work  in God's service among the people ? . . . And, while he lay drowsily musing on the unfinished dream,  a muffled murmur of women's voices reached his ears. By an  intuition, akin perhaps to animal instinct, he knew all at once  that it was she, talking with Mrs. Parkin down in the room below.  Prompted by a rush of imperious impulse he raised himself on his  elbow to listen. There 190  A Study in Sentimentality There was a rustling of skirts in the passage and the sound of  the voices grew clearer. "Good day, ma'am, and thank ye very kindly, I'm sure," Mrs.  Parkin was saying. No reply came, though he was straining every nerve to  catch it ... At last, subdued, but altogether distinct,  her voice : "You're sure there's nothing else I can send ?" The door of his room was ajar. He dug his nails into the  panel-edge, and tried to swing it open. But he could scarcely  move it, and in a moment she would be gone. Suddenly he heard his own voice—loud and queer it sounded: "Ethel—Ethel." Hurried steps mounted the stairs, and Mrs. Parkin's white cap  and spectacled face appeared. "What be t'matter, Mr. Burkett ?" she asked breathlessly. "Stop her—tell her." "Dearie, dearie me, he's off wanderin' agin." "No, no ; I'm all right—tell—ask Mrs. Fulton if she would  come up to see me ?" "There, there, Mr. Burkett, don't ye excite yeself. Ye're not  fit to see any one, ye know that. Lie ye doon agin, or ye'll be  catchin' yer death o' cauld." "Ask her to come, please—just for a minute." "For Heaven's sake lie doon. Ye'll be workin' yeself into a  fever next. There, there, I'll ask her for ye, though I've na  notion what t'doctor 'ud say." She drew down the blind and retired, closing the door quietly  behind her. The next thing he saw was Ethel standing by his bedside. He lay watching her without speaking. She wore a red dress trimmed By Hubert Crackanthorpe  191 trimmed with fur ; a gold bracelet was round her gloved wrist, and  a veil half-hid her features. Presently he perceived that she was very white, that her mouth  was twitching, and that her eyes were full of tears. "Alec—I'm so sorry you're so ill ... Are you in pain ?" He shook his head absently. Her veil and the fur on her cloak  looked odd, he thought, in the half-light of the room. "You will be better soon : the worst is over." "No," he answered, with a dreary smile. "I am going to  die." She burst into sobs. "No, no, Alec . . . You must not think that." He stretched his arm over the coverlet towards her, and felt the  soft pressure of her gloved hand. "Forgive me, Ethel, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pain you.  But it is so ; the doctor told me this morning." She sat down by the bedside, still crying, pressing her handker-  chief to her eyes. "Ethel, how strange it seems. Do you know I haven't seen  you since I left Cockermouth ?" The words came deliberately,  for his mind had grown quite calm. "How the time has  flown !" Her grasp on his hand tightened, but she made no answer. "It was very kind of you to come all this way, Ethel, to  see me. Will you stay a little and let me talk to you ? It's  more than five years since we ve talked together, you know," and  he smiled faintly. "Don't cry so, Ethel, dear. I did not mean  to make you cry. There's no cause to cry, dear ; you've made  me so happy." "My poor, poor Alec," she sobbed. "You'd almost forgotten the old days, perhaps," he continued dreamily, 192  A Study in Sentimentality dreamily, talking half to himself; "for it's a long while ago now.  But to me it seems as if it had all just happened. You see I've  been vegetating rather, here in this lonely, little place . . . Don't  go on crying, Ethel dear ... let me tell you about things a little.  There's no harm in it now, because you know I'm——" "Oh ! don't—don't say that. You'll get better. I know you  will." "No, Ethel, I sha'n't. Something within me tells me that my  course is done. Besides, I don't want to get better. I'm so  happy . . . Stay a little with me, Ethel ... I wanted to  explain ... I was stupid, selfish, in the old days——" "It was I—I who—" she protested through her tears. "No, you were quite right to write me that letter. I've  thought that almost from the  . . . I'm sure of it," he added,  as if convincing himself definitely. "It could never be . . . it was  my fault ... I was stupid and boorish and wrapped up in myself.  I did not try to understand your nature ... I didn't understand  anything about women ... I never had a sister ... I took  for granted that you were always thinking and feeling just as I  was. I never tried to understand you, Ethel ... I was not fit  to be entrusted with you." "Alec, Alec, it is not true. You were too good, too noble-  hearted. I felt you were far above me. Beside you I felt I  was silly and frivolous. Your standards about everything seemed  so high——" But he interrupted, unheeding her : "You don't know, Ethel, how happy you've made me. ... I  have thought of you every day. In the evenings, I used to sit  alone, remembering you and all the happy days we had together,  and the remembrance of them has been a great joy to me. I used  to go over them all, again and again. The day that we all went to By Hubert Crackanthorpe  193 to Morecambe, and that walk along the seashore, when the tide  caught us, and I carried you across the water . . . the time that  we went to those ruins, and you wore the primroses I picked for  you. And I used to read over all your letters, and remember all  the things you used to say. Downstairs, under the writing-table,  there is a black, tin cash-box—the key is on my bunch—Mrs.  Parkin will give it you. It's where I've kept everything that has  reminded me of you, all this time. Will you take it back with  you ? . . . You don't know how you've helped me all these years—  I wanted to tell you that . . . When I was in difficulties, I used to  wonder how you would have liked me to act . . . When I was lonely and low-spirited, I used to tell myself that you were happy."  He paused for breath, and his voice died slowly in the stillness of  the room. "You were quite right," he murmured almost inaudibly,  "I see it all quite clearly now." She was bending over him, and was framing his face in her two  hands. "Say I was wrong," she pleaded passionately. "Say I was  wicked, wrong. I loved you, Alec ... I was promised to you. I  should have been so happy with you, dear . . . Alec, my Alec,  do not die . . . God will not let you die . . . He cannot be so  cruel . . . Come back, Alec ... I love you . . . Do you hear,  my Alec ? I love you . . . Ethel loves you . . . Before God I  love you ... I was promised to you ... I broke my word . . .  I loved you all the time, but I did not know it ... Forgive me, my Alec . . . forgive me ... I shall love you always." He passed his fingers over her forehead tentatively, as if he were  in darkness. "Ethel, every day, every hour, all these years, you have been  with me. And now I am going away. Kiss me—just once—  just once. There can be no wrong in it now." She 194  A Study in Sentimentality She tore her veil from her face : their lips met, and her head  rested a moment, sobbing on his shoulder. "Hush ! don't cry, Ethel dear, don't cry. You have made me  so glad. . . . And you will remember to take the box . . . And  you will think of me sometimes . . . And I shall pray God to  make you happy, and I shall wait for you, Ethel, and be with you  in thought, and if you have trouble, you will know that I shall be  sorrowing with you. Isn't it so, dear ? . . . Now, good-bye,  dear one—good-bye. May God watch over you." She had moved away. She came back again, however, and  kissed his forehead reverently. But he was not aware of her  return, for his mind had begun to wander. She brushed past Mrs. Parkin in the passage, bidding her an  incoherent good-bye : she was instinctively impatient to escape to  the protection of familiar surroundings. Inside the house, she felt  helpless, dizzy : the melodrama of the whole scene had stunned  her senses, and pity for him was rushing through her in waves of  pulsing emotion. As she passed the various landmarks, which she had noted on  her outward journey—a group of Scotch firs, a roofless cattle-shed,  a pile of felled trees—each seemed to wear an altered aspect.  With what a strange suddenness it had all happened ! Yesterday  the groom had brought back word that he was in delirium, and  had told her of the loneliness of the house. It had seemed so sad,  his lying ill, all alone : the thought had preyed on her conscience,  till she had started to drive out there to inquire if there were any-  thing she could do to help him. Now, every corner round which  the cart swung, lengthened the stretch of road that separated her  from that tragic scene in his room . . . Perhaps it was not right for  her to drive home and leave him? But she couldn't bear to stay :  it was all so dreadful. Besides, she assured herself, she could do no By Hubert Crackanthorpe  195 no good. There was the doctor, and that old woman who nursed  him—they would see to everything . . . Poor, poor Alec—alone in  that grey-walled cottage, pitched at the far end of this long, bleak  valley—the half-darkened room—his wasted, feverish face—and his knowing  that he could not live—it all came back to her vividly, and  she shivered as if with cold. Death seemed hideous, awful, almost  wicked in the cruelty of its ruthlessness. And the homeward  drive loomed ahead, interminably—for two hours she would have  to wait with the dreadful, flaring remembrance of it all—two hours—for the horse was tired, and it was thirteen miles, a man by  the roadside had told her. . . . He was noble-hearted, saint-like . . . Her pity for him welled up  once more, and she convinced herself that she could have loved  him, worshipped him, been worthy of him as a husband—and now  he lay dying. He had revealed his whole nature to her, it seemed.  No one had ever understood, as she did now, what a fine character  he was in reality. Her cheeks grew hot with indignation and  shame, as she remembered how she had heard people laugh at him  behind his back, refer to him mockingly as the 'love-sick curate.'  And all this while—for five whole years—he had gone on caring  for her—thinking of her each day, reading her letters, recalling  the things she used to say—yes, those were his very words.  Before, she had never suspected that it was in his nature to  take it so horribly tragically ; yet, somehow, directly he had fixed his eyes on her in that excited way, she had half-guessed  it. . . . The horse's trot slackened to a walk, and the wheels crunched  over a bed of newly-strewn stones . . . She was considering how  much of what had happened she could relate to Jim. Oh ! the  awfulness of his  knowing beforehand  like that ! She had kissed him : she had told him that she cared for him : she hadn't been 196  A Study in Sentimentality been able to help doing that. There was no harm in it ;  she had made him happier—he had said so himself . . . But  Jim wouldn't understand : he would be angry with her for  having gone, perhaps. He wouldn't see that she couldn't have  done anything else. No, she couldn't bear to tell him : besides,  it seemed somehow like treachery to Alec . . . Oh ! it must be  awful to  know beforehand  like that ! . . . The doctor should never  have told him. It was horrible, cruel ... In the past how she  had been to blame—she saw that now : thoughtless, selfish, alto-  gether beneath him. It was like a chapter in a novel. His loving her silently all  these years, and telling her about it on his deathbed. At the  thought of it she thrilled with subtle pride : it illuminated the  whole ordinariness of her life. The next moment the train of  her own thoughts shamed her. Poor, poor Alec. . . . And to  reinforce her pity, she recalled the tragic setting of the scene. That woman—his landlady—could she have heard anything, she  wondered with a twinge of dread ? No, the door was shut, and  his voice had been very low. The horse turned on to the main road, and pricking his ears,  quickened his pace. She would remember him always. Every day, she would think  of him, as he had asked her to do—she would never forget to do  that. And, if she were in trouble, or difficulty, she would turn  her thoughts towards him, just as he had told her he used to do.  She would try to become better—more religious—for his sake.  She would read her Bible each morning, as she knew had been his  habit. These little things were all she could do now. Her  attitude in the future she would make worthy of his in the  past ... He would become the secret guiding-star of her life :  it would be her hidden chapter of romance. . . . The By Hubert Crackanthorpe  197 The box that box which he had asked her to take. She had  promised, and she had forgotten it. How could she get it ? It  was too late to turn back now. Jim would be waiting for her.  She would only just be in time for dinner as it was . . . How  could she get it ? If she wrote to his landlady, and asked her to  send it it was under the writing-table in the sitting-room he  had said . . . She  must get it, somehow. . . . It was dark before she reached home. Jim was angry with her  for being late, and for having driven all the way without a servant.  She paid no heed to his upbraiding ; but told him shortly that  Alec was still in great danger. He muttered some perfunctory  expression of regret, and went off to the stables to order a bran-  mash for the horse. His insensibility to the importance of the  tragedy she had been witnessing, exasperated her : she felt bitterly  mortified that he could not divine all that she had been suffering. ***** The last of the winter months went, and life in the valley swept  its sluggish course onwards. The bleak, spring winds rollicked,  hooting from hill to hill. The cattle waited for evening, huddled  under the walls of untrimmed stone ; and before the fireside, in  every farmhouse, new-born lambs lay helplessly bleating. On  Sundays the men would loaf in churlish groups about the church  door, jerk curt greetings at one another, and ask for news of  Parson Burkett. It was a curate from Cockermouth who took  the services in his stead—one of the new-fangled sort ; a young  gentleman from London way, who mouthed his words like a girl,  carried company manners, and had a sight of strange clerical practices. Alec was slowly recovering. The fever had altogether left  him : a straw-coloured beard now covered his chin, and his cheeks  were grown hollow and peaky-looking. But by the hay-harvest, the 198  A Study in Sentimentality the doctor reckoned, he would be as strong as ever again—so it was commonly reported. Mrs. Parkin declared that the illness had done him a world o'  good. "It's rested his mind like, and kept him from frettin'.  He was alus ower given to studyin' on his own thoughts, till he got  dazed like and took na notice o' things. An' noo," she would  conclude, "ye should jest see him, smilin' as free as a child." So, day after day, floated vaguely by, and to Alec the calm of  their unbroken regularity was delicious. He was content to lie  still for hours, thinking of nothing, remembering nothing, tasting  the torpor of dreamy contemplation ; watching through the  window the slow drifting of the shadows ; listening to the cackling  of geese, and the plaintive bleating of sheep. . . . By-and-bye, with returning strength, his senses quickened, and  grew sensitive to every passing impression. To eat with elaborate deliberation his invalid meals ; to watch the myriad specks of gold dancing across a bar of sunlight—these were sources of keen,  exciting delight. But in the foreground of his mind, transfiguring  with its glamour every trivial thought, flashed the memory of Ethel's  visit. He lived through the whole scene again and again, picturing  her veiled figure as it had stood by the bedside, wrapped in the red,  fur cloak ; and her protesting words, her passionate tears, seemed  to form a mystic, indissoluble bond between them, that brightened  all the future with rainbow colours. God had given him back to her. Whether circumstances  brought them together frequently, or whether they were forced to  live their lives almost wholly apart, would, he told himself, matter  but little. Their spiritual communion would remain unbroken.  Indeed, the prospect of such separations, proving, as it did to him,  the sureness of the bond between them, almost elated him. There  would be unquestioning trust between them, and, though the world By Hubert Crackanthorpe  199 world had separated them, the best that was in him belonged to  her. When at length they met, there would be no need for  insistance on common points of feeling, for repeated handling of  past threads, as was customary with ordinary friendships. Since  each could read the other's heart, that sure intuition born of  chastened, spiritual love would be theirs. If trouble came to her,  he would be there to sacrifice all at a moment's bidding, after the  fashion of the knights of old. Because she knew him, she would  have faith in him. To do her service would be his greatest  joy. At  the immobile, isolated hours of his convalescence made  all these things appear simple and inevitable, like the events of a  great dream. As time went on, however, he grew to chafe  against his long confinement, to weary of his weakness, and of the  familiar sight of every object in the room ; and in the mornings,  when Mrs. Parkin brought him his breakfast, he found himself  longing for a letter from her—some brief word of joy that he was  recovering. He yearned for some material object, the touch of  which would recall her to him, as if a particle of her personality  had impregnated the atoms. Sometimes, he would force himself into believing that she would  appear again, drive out to learn the progress of his recovery . . .  After luncheon she would leave home . . . about half-past one,  probably . . . soon after three, he would see her . . . Now,  she was nearing the cross-roads . . . now climbing the hill past  Longrigg's farm . . . she would have to walk the horse there . . .  now, crossing the old bridge. He would lie watching the clock ;  and when the suspense grew intolerable, to cheat it, he would bury  his head in the pillow to count up to a thousand, before glancing at  the hands again. So would slip by the hour of her arrival ; still,  he would struggle to delude himself with all manner of excuses for 200  A Study in Sentimentality for her—she had been delayed—she had missed the turning, and  had been compelled to retrace her steps. And, when at length  the twilight had come, he would start to assure himself that  it was to be to-morrow, and sink into a fitful dozing, recounting  waking dreams of her, subtly intoxicating. . . . ***** In April came a foretaste of summer, and, for an hour or two  every day, he was able to hobble downstairs. He perceived the  box at once, lying in its accustomed place, and concluded that on  learning that he was out of danger, she had sent it back to him.  The sight of it cheered him with indefinable hope : it seemed to  signify a fresh token of her faith in him: it had travelled with her  back to Cockermouth on that wonderful day which had brought  them together ; and now, in his eyes, it was invested with a new  preciousness. He unlocked it, and, somehow, to discover that its  contents had not been disturbed, was a keen disappointment. He  longed for proof that she had been curious to look into it, that she  had thus been able to realise how he had prized every tiny object  that had been consecrated for him by her. Then it flashed across  him that she herself might have brought the box back, and fearing to disturb him, had gone home again without asking to  see him. All that evening he brooded over this supposition ; yet  shrank from putting any question to Mrs. Parkin. But the  following morning, a sudden impulse overcame his repugnance ;  and the next moment he had learned the truth. Untouched,  unmoved, the box had remained all the while—she had never  taken it—she had forgotten it. And depression swept through  him ; for it seemed that his ideal had tottered. His prolonged isolation and his physical lassitude had quickened  his emotions to an abnormal sensibility, and had led him to a  constant fingering, as it were, of his successive sentimental phases. And By Hubert Crackanthorpe  201 And these, since they constituted his sole diversion, he had un- consciously come to regard as of supreme importance. The cum-  bersome, complex details of life in the outside world had assumed  the simplification of an indistinct background : in his vision of  her figure he had perceived no perspective. But now the grain of doubt was sown : it germinated in-  sidiously ; and soon, the whole complexion of his attitude  towards her was transformed. All at once he saw a whole net-  work of unforeseen obstacles, besetting each detail of the prospect  he had been planning. Swarming uncertainty fastened on him at  every turn ; till at last, goaded to desperation, he stripped the gilding  from the accumulated fabric of his idealised future. And then his passion for her flamed up—ardent, unreasoning,  human. After all, he loved as other men loved—that was the  truth : the rest was mere calfish meandering. Stubbornly he  vindicated to himself his right to love her . . . He was a man—  a creature of flesh and blood, and every fibre within him was  crying out for her—for the sight of her face ; the sound of her  voice ; the clasp of her hand. Body and soul he loved her ; body  and soul he yearned for her . . . She had come back to him— she was his again—with passionate tears she had told him that she  loved him. To fight for her, he was ready to abandon all else.  At the world's laws he jibed bitterly ; before God they were man  and wife. The knowledge that it lay in his power to make her his for life,  to bind her to him irrevocably, brought him intoxicating relief.  Henceforward he would live on, but for that end. Existence  without her would be dreary, unbearable. He would resign his  living and leave the church. Together they would go away,  abroad : he would find some work to do in the great cities of  Australia . . . She was another man's wife—but the sin would The Yellow Book.—Vol. III.  M be 202  A Study in Sentimentality be his— his , not hers—God would so judge it ; and for her sake he  would suffer the punishment. Besides, he told himself exultantly,  the sin was it not already committed ? "Whosoever looketh on a  woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already  in his heart." He would go to her, say to her simply that he was come for  her. It should be done openly, honestly in the full light of day.  New strength and deep-rooted confidence glowed within him.  The wretched vacillation of his former self was put away like an  old garment. Once more he sent her words of love sounding  in his ears—the words that had made them man and wife before  God. And on, the train of his thoughts whirled : visions  of a hundred scenes flitted before his eyes—he and she together as  man and wife, in a new home across the seas, where the past  was all forgotten, and the present was redolent of the sure joy of  perfect love. . . . ***** He was growing steadily stronger. Pacing the floor of his  room, or the gravel-path before the house, when the sun was  shining, each day he would methodically measure the progress of  his strength. He hinted of a long sea voyage to the doctor : the  man declared that it would be madness to start before ten days had  elapsed. Ten days—the stretch of time seemed absurd, intolerable.  But a quantity of small matters relating to the parish remained to  be set in order : he had determined to leave no confusion behind  him. So he mapped out a daily task for himself: thus he could  already begin to work for her : thus each day's accomplishment  would bring him doubly nearer to her. The curate, who had  been taking his duty, came once or twice at his request to help him ;  for he was jealously nursing his small stock of strength. He broke  the news of his approaching departure to Mrs. Parkin, and asked her to By Hubert Crackanthorpe  203 to accept the greater portion of his furniture, as an inadequate token of his gratitude towards her for all she had done for him. The  good creature wept copiously, pestered him with questions  concerning his destination, and begged him to give her news of  him in the future. Next he sent for a dealer from Cockermouth  to buy the remainder, and disputed with him the price of each  object tenaciously. One afternoon his former rector appeared, and with tremulous  cordiality wished him God-speed, assuming that the sea voyage  was the result of doctor's advice. And it was when the old man  was gone, and he was alone again, that, for the  time, with a  spasm of pain, he caught a glimpse of the deception he was prac-  tising. But some irresistible force within him urged him forward—  he was powerless—to look back was impossible now—there was  more yet to be done—he must go on—there was no time to stop  to think. So to deaden the rising conscience-pangs, he fiercely  reminded himself that now, but five days more separated her from  him. He sat down to write to his bishop and resign his living,  struggling with ambiguous, formal phrases, impetuously attributing  to his physical weakness his inability to frame them. The letter at length finished, instinctively dreading fresh  gnawings of uneasiness, he forced himself feverishly into thinking  of plans for the future, busying his mind with, time-tables, searching  for particulars of steamers, turning over the leaves of his bank-  book. All the money which his father had left to him had  remained untouched : for three years they could live comfortably on  the capital ; meanwhile he would have found some work. At last, when, with the growing twilight, the hills outside were hurriedly darkening, he sank back wearily in his chair. And all  at once he perceived with dismay that nothing remained for him  to do, nothing with which he could occupy his mind. For the moment 204  A Study in Sentimentality moment he was alone with himself, and looking backwards,  realisation of the eager facility with which he had successively  severed each link, and the rapidity with which he had set himself  drifting towards a future, impenetrable, with mysterious uncertainty,  stole over him. He had done it all, he told himself, deliberately,  unaided ; bewildered, he tried to bring himself face to face with  his former self, to survey himself as he had been before the fever—  that afternoon when he had gone up to Beda Cottages—plodding  indifferently through life in the joyless, walled-in valley, which, he  now understood, had in a measure reflected the spirit of his own  listless broodings. Scared remorse seized him. The prospect of  departure, now that it was close at hand, frightened him ; left him  aching as with the burden of dead weight, so that, for a while, he  remained inert, dully acquiescing in his accumulating disquietude. Then, in desperation, he invoked her figure, imagining a dozen incoherent versions of the coming scene—the tense words of  greeting, his passionate pleading, her impulsive yielding, and the  acknowledgment of her trust in him. . . . By-and-bye, Mrs. Parkin brought him his dinner. He chatted  to her with apparent unconcern, jested regarding his appetite ; for  a curious calm, the lucidity evoked by suppressed elation, pervaded  him. But through the night he tossed restlessly, waking in the dark-  ness to find himself throbbing with triumphant exhilaration ; each  time striking matches to examine the face of his watch, and  beginning afresh to calculate the hours that separated him from the  moment that was to bind them together—the irrevocable starting  towards the future years. ***** She stood in the bow-window of her drawing-room, arranging  some cut flowers in slender pink and blue vases, striped with enamel of By Hubert Crackanthorpe  205 of imitation gold. Behind her, the room, uncomfortably orna-  mental, repeated the three notes of colour—gilt paper shavings  filling the grate ; gilt-legged chairs and tables ; stiff, shiny, pink  chintzes encasing the furniture ; on the wall a blue-patterned  paper, all speckled with stars of gold. Outside, the little lawn, bathed in the fresh morning sunlight,  glowed a luscious green, and the trim flower-beds swelled with  heightened colours. A white fox-terrier came waddling along the  garden path : she lifted the animal inside the window, stroking his  sleek sides with an effusive demonstration of affection. Would  Jim remember to be home in good time, she was idly wondering ;  she had forgotten to remind him before he went to his office, that  to-night she was to sing at a local concert. Suddenly, she caught sight of a man's figure crossing the lawn.  For an instant she thought it was an old clerk, whom Jim some-  times employed to carry messages. Then she saw that it was  Alec—coming straight towards her. Her  impulse was to  escape from him ; but noticing that his gaze was fixed on the  ground, she retreated behind an angle of the window, and stood  watching him . . . Poor Alec ! He was going away on a sea-  voyage for his health, so Jim had heard it said in the town ; and  she formed a hasty resolve to be very kind to the poor fellow. Yet her vanity felt a prick of pique, as she noticed that his gait  was grown more gaunt, more ungainly than ever ; and she resented  that his haggard face, his stubbly beard, which, when he lay ill,  had signified tense tragedy, should now seem simply uncouth.  Still, she awaited his appearance excitedly ; anticipating a renewed  proof of his touching, dog-like devotion to her, and with a fresh  thrill of unconscious gratitude to him for having supplied that  scene to which she could look back with secret, sentimental pride. The maid let him into the room. As he advanced towards her, 206  A Study in Sentimentality her, she saw him brush his forehead with his hand impatiently,  as if to rid his brain of an importunate thought. He took her  outstretched hand : the forced cheeriness of her phrase of  greeting died away, as she felt his gaze searching her face. "Let us sit down," he said abruptly. "I'm all right again, now," he began with a brisk, level laugh ;  and it occurred to her that perhaps the illness had affected his mind. "I'm so glad of that," she stammered in reply ; "so very glad.  . . . And you're going away, aren't you, for a long sea voyage ?  That will do you ever so much good——" But before she had finished speaking, he was kneeling on the  carpet before her, pouring out incoherent phrases. Bewildered,  she gazed at him, only noticing the clumsy breadth of his shoulders. "Listen to me, Ethel, listen," he was saying. "Everything  is ready—I've given it all up—my living—the Church. I  can't bear it any longer—life without you, I mean . . . You are  everything to me—I only want you—I care for nothing else  now. I am going away to Australia. You will come with me,  Ethel—you said you loved me . . . We love one another—come  with me—let us start life afresh. I can't go on living without  you ... I thought it would be easy for you to come ; I see now  that perhaps it's difficult. You have your home : I see that . . .  But have trust in me—I will make it up to you. Together we  will start afresh— make a new home—a new life. I will give you  every moment ; I will be your slave . . . Listen to me, Ethel ; let  us go away. Everything is ready—I've got money—I've arranged  everything. We can go up to London to-morrow. The steamer  starts on Thursday." The sound of his voice ceased. She was staring at the door,  filled with dread lest it should open, and the maid should see him  kneeling on the carpet. "Don't, By Hubert Crackanthorpe  207 "Don't," she exclaimed, grasping his coat. "Get up, quick." He rose, awkwardly she thought, and stood before her. "We were so happy together once, dear—do you remember—  in the days, when you promised yourself to me ? And now I  know that in your heart you still care for me. You said so. Say  you will come—say you will trust me—you will start to-morrow.  If you can't come so soon I will wait, wait till you can come,"  he added, and she felt the trembling touch of his hands on hers,  and his breath beating on her face. "Don't, please," and she pushed back his hands. "Some one  might see." "What does it matter, my darling ? We are going to belong  to one another for always. I am going to wait for you, darling—  to be your slave—to give up every moment of my life to you . . .  It's the thought of you that's made me live, dear . . . You  brought me back to life, that day you came . . . I've thought of  nothing but you since. I've been arranging it all——" "It's impossible," she interrupted. "No, dear, it's not impossible," he pleaded. "You've resigned your living—left the Church?" she asked incredulously. "Yes, everything," he answered proudly. "And all because you cared so for me ?" "I can't begin to live again without you. I would suffer  eternal punishment gladly to win you . . . You will trust yourself  to me darling ; say you will trust me." "Of course, Alec, I trust you. But you ve no right to——" "Oh ! because you're married, and it's a sin, and I'm a  clergyman. But I'm a man . And for you I've given it  all up—everything. You don't understand my love for you." "Yes, yes, I do," she answered quickly, alarmed by the earnest- ness 208  A Study in Sentimentality ness of his passion, yet remembering vaguely that she had read of  such things in books. "You will come to-morrow, darling—you will have trust in  me ?" "You are mad, Alec. You don't know what you are saying.  It would be absurd." "It's because you don't understand how I love you, that you  say that," he broke out fiercely. "You can't understand—you  can't understand. "Yes, I can," she protested, instinctively eager to vie with his display of emotion. "Then say you will come—promise it promise it," he cried ;  and his features were all distorted by suspense. But at this climax of his insistance, she lost consciousness of  her own attitude. She seemed suddenly to see all that clumsiness  which had made her refuse him before. "It's altogether ridiculous," she answered shortly. He recoiled from her: he seemed to stiffen a little all over ;  and she felt rising impatience at his grotesque denseness in per-  sisting. "You say it's altogether ridiculous ?" he repeated after her  slowly. "Yes, of course it's ridiculous," she repeated with uneasy  emphasis. "I'm very sorry you should mind—feel it so—but it  isn't my fault." "Why did you say than that before God you loved me,  when you came that day ?" he burst out with concentrated  bitterness. "Because I thought you were dying." The bald statement  of the truth sprang to her lips—a spontaneous, irresistible  betrayal. "I see By Hubert Crackenthorpe  209 "I see—I see," he muttered. His hands clenched till  the knuckles showed white. "I'm very sorry," she added lamely. Her tone was gentler, for  his dumb suffering moved her sensibilities. In her agitation, the  crudity of her avowal had slipped her notice. "That's no use," he answered wearily. "Alec, don't be angry with me. Can't we be friends? Don't  you see yourself now that it was mad, absurd?" she argued, eager  to reinstate herself in his eyes. Then, as he made no answer,  "Let us be friends, Alec, and you will go back to Scarsdale, when  you are well and strong. You will give up nothing for my sake.  I should not wish that, you know, Alec." "Yes," he assented mechanically, "I shall go back." "I shall always think of this morning," she continued,  growing sentimentally remorseful as the sensation of rising relief pervaded her. "And you will soon forget all about it," she added, with a cheeriness of tone that rang false ; and pause, awaiting his answer. "And I shall forget all about it," he repeated after her. To mask her disappointment, she assumed a silly, nervous  gaiety. "And I shall keep it quite secret that you were so naughty as  to ask me to run away with you. I sha'n't even tell Jim." He nodded stupidly. With a thin, empty smile on her face, she was debating how best  to part with him, when, of a sudden, he rose, and, without a word,  walked out of the room. He strode away across the lawn, and, as she watched his retreating figure, she felt for him a shallow compassion, not unmingled with contempt.

A Sunset By William Hyde Jeanne-Marie By Leila Macdonald I JEANNE-MARIE lived alone in the white cottage at the far end of  the village street. It was a long narrow street of tall houses, stretching each side  of the white shining road, for two hundred yards or more. A  street that was cool and shadeful even in the shadeless summer  days, when the sun burned most hotly, when the broad roads  dazzled between their avenues of plane-tree and poplar, and the  mountains disappeared from the horizon in the blue haze of  heat. From her little garden Jeanne-Marie liked to look at the  mountains each morning, and, when for two or three days follow-  ing they were not to be seen, she would shake her head reproach-  fully, as at the failing of old friends. "My boys, Jeanne-Marie is only thirty-seven," Bourdet the  innkeeper said to his companions, as they sat, one May afternoon,  smoking under the chestnut-trees in front of the café. They all  looked up as he spoke, and watched Jeanne-Marie, as she walked  slowly past them to her cottage. "Bourdet has been paying court," said Leguillon, the fat, red- faced 216  Jeanne-Marie faced butcher, with a chuckle, as he puffed at his long pipe.  "You see, he is anxious we should think her of an age suitable,  before he tells us the betrothals are arranged." "For my part I should give many congratulations," said the  village postman and tobacconist, gruffly. "Jeanne-Marie is worth  any of our girls of the village, with their bright dresses and silly  giggles." Bourdet laughed. "You shall come to the wedding, my  friends," he said, with a wink and a nod of the head to the  retreating figure ; "and since our friend Minaud there finds the  girls so distasteful, he shall wait till our babies are old enough, and  be betrothed to one of them." The postmaster laughed with the rest. "But seriously," he  said, "Bourdet will pardon me if I tell him our Jeanne-Marie is a  good deal past the thirties." Laurent, the good-looking young farmer, who stood leaning  against the tree round which their chairs were gathered, answered  him gravely. "Wait,  beau-pѐre , till you see her on Sunday coming from Mass on M. Bourdet's arm ; the cap that hides the  grey knot of hair at the back of the head is neat and bright—oh !  so bright—pink or blue for choice, and if M. Bourdet chances  to compliment the colour of the stockings—he is gay, you know,  always—the yellow face turns rosy and all the wrinkles go."  And laughing maliciously at Bourdet, the young fellow turned  away homewards. Bourdet looked grave. "'Tis your son-in-law that speaks like  that, Minaud," he said, "otherwise I would say that in my day  the young fellows found it better to amuse themselves with the  young girls than to mock at the old ones." "You are right, my friend," said Minaud. "Tis the regiment  that taught Laurent this, and many other things. But it is a good By Leila Macdonald  217 good boy, though with a sharp tongue. To these young ones it  seems all foolishness to be an old girl." And the others nodded agreement. So they sat, chatting, and drawing at their long pipes, while the afternoon sun gleamed on the little gardens and on the closed  green shutters of the houses ; and the slow, large oxen lumbered  through the village street, their yoked heads pressed well down,  and their tails flicking unceasingly at the swarm of flies. Jeanne-Marie stood in her garden, blinking thoughtfully at the  flowers, while she shaded her eyes with her hand. On her bare  head the sparse brown hair was parted severely and neatly to each  side, and the deep southern eyes looked steadily out of the tanned  and wrinkled face. Her light cotton bodice fell away from the  thin lines of her neck and shoulders, and her sabots clicked harshly  as she moved about the garden. "At least the good God has given me a fine crab-apple bloom  this year," Jeanne-Marie said, as she looked at the masses of rich  blossom. On the wall the monthly roses were flowering thickly,  and the Guelder roses bent their heads under the weight of their  heavy bunches. " In six days I shall have the peonies, and the  white rose-bush in the corner is coming soon," said Jeanne-Marie  contentedly. II It was four and a half years ago that Jeanne-Marie had come to  the white cottage next to the mill, with the communal school  opposite. Till that autumn day, when a pair of stout oxen had  brought her goods to the door, she had lived with her brother, who  was  métayer  to M. François, the owner of the big villa a quarter of 218  Jeanne-Marie of a mile beyond the village. Her father had been  métayer  ; and  when he died, his son Firman—a fine-looking young man, not  long home from his service—had taken his place. So the change  at the  métairie  had very little affected Jeanne-Marie. But she missed her father sorely every day at mid-day, when she remembered that there was one less to cook for ; that the tall, straight old figure would not come in at the door, and that the  black pudding might remain uncooked for all Firman's noticing ;  and Jeanne-Marie would put the bouillon by the fire, and sit down  and cry softly to herself. They were very kind to her at the villa, and at night, when  Firman was at the café, she would take the stockings and the  linen and darn them in the kitchen, while she listened to the  servants' talk, and suppressed her  patois  as much as possible, for  they were from the North, and would not understand. Two years after her father's death, Jeanne-Marie began to  notice that Firman went no more to the café in the evening,  and had always his shirt clean, and his best black smocked  cape for the market in the town on Mondays, and for Mass on  Sundays. "It astonishes me," she had said, when she was helping  M. François' cook that day the château-folk had come to déjeûner , unexpectedly—for Jeanne-Marie's cooking was very  good indeed— "because, you understand, that is not his way at  all. Now, if it were Paul Puyoo or the young André, it would  be quite ordinary ; but with Firman, I doubt with him it is a  different thing." And Anna had nodded her black head sagely over the  omelette  aux fines herbes  as she answered : "Jeanne-Marie, Firman wishes  to marry ; Jeanne-Marie, for my own part, I say it's that little  fat blue-eyed Suzanne from the  métairie  on the hill." Suzanne By Leila Macdonald  219 III Suzanne looked very pretty the day she came home to Mr.  François'  métairie , leaning on her husband's arm ; but Jeanne-Marie  was not there to see ; she was sitting in the large chair in the  kitchen of the white cottage, and she was sobbing with her head  in her hands. "And indeed the blessed Virgin herself must have  thought me crazy, to see me sitting sobbing there, with the house  in confusion, and not a thing to cook with in the kitchen," she  said, shamefacedly, to Marthe Legrand from the mill, when she came in, later, to help her. "You should have remained," Marthe answered, nodding at her pityingly. "You should have remained, Jeanne-Marie ; the old house is the old house, and the good God  never meant the wedding of the young ones to drive away the old  ones from the door." Jeanne-Marie drew in her breath at the words "old ones."  "But the book says I am only thirty-four!" she told herself;  and that night she looked in the old Mass-book, to be sure if it  could be true ; and there was the date set down very clearly, in  the handwriting of Dubois, her father's oldest friend ; for Jeanne-  Marie's father himself could neither read nor write—he was, as he  said with pride, of the old school, "that kissed our sweethearts,  and found that better than writing them long scribbles on white  paper, as the young ones do now ; and thought a chat with a  friend on Sundays and holidays worth more than sitting cramped  up, reading the murders and the adulteries in the newspapers."  So it was Dubois who wrote down the children's births in the old  Mass book. Yes, there they were. Catherine  of all ; poor  Catherine, who was so bright and pretty, and died that rainy The Yellow Book—Vol. III.  N winter 220  Jeanne-Marie winter when she was just twelve years old. Then "Jeanne-Marie,  née le 28 Novembre 1854, à minuit," and added, in the same hand-  writing, "On nous raconte qu'à cette heure-là nous étions en  train de gagner une grande bataille en Russie ! Que ça lui porte  bonheur !" Eight years later; "Jacques Firman, né le 12  Fѐvrier à midi." It all came back to Jeanne-Marie as she read ;  that scene of his birth, when she was just eight years old. She  was sitting alone in the kitchen, crying, for they had told her her  mother was very ill, and had been ill all the night, and just as the  big clock was striking twelve she heard the voice of the neighbour  who had spent the night there, calling to her ; "Jeanne-Marie,  viens vite, ta mere veut te voir" ; and she had gone, timid and  hesitating, into the darkened room. The  thing she noticed  was the large fire blazing on the open hearth—she had never  known her father and mother have a fire before—and she wondered  much whether it was being too cold that had made her mother ill,  as it had little Catherine. She looked towards the bed and saw  her mother lying there, her eyes closed, and very pale—so pale that Jeanne-Marie was frightened and ran towards her father ; but  he was smiling where he stood by the bed, and the child was  reassured. She saw him stoop and kiss his wife on the forehead,  and call her his "bonne petite femme," and taking Jeanne-Marie  by the hand he showed her the  sage-femme —the  sage-femme  who  had come the night before to make her mother well—sitting near  the fire with a white bundle in her arms, and thanked the good  God aloud that he had sent him a fine boy at last. Old Dubois  had come in gently, his béret in his hand, as Jeanne-Marie's father  was speaking, and turning to the bed had reiterated emphatically,  "Tu as bien fait, chѐre dame, tu as bien fait." Jeanne-Marie sat silently going over it all in her mind. "Té,"  she murmured, "how quickly they all go ; the father, the mother, old By Leila Macdonald  221 old Dubois, even Jeanne the  voisine , is gone. I alone am left,  and the good God knows if there will be any to cry for me when  my turn comes to go." She shut the old Mass-book, and put it  carefully back on the shelf, and she went to the old looking-glass  and the tanned wrinkled face met its reflection very calmly and  patiently. "I think it was the hard work in the fields when I  was young," she said; "certainly Marthe was right. It is the face of an old woman, a face more worn than hers, though she is  beyond forty and has borne so many children." IV Firman had urged his sister to stay on at the  métairie  after his  marriage. "You should not go, it is not natural," he said one  evening a few weeks before his wedding, while they were piling  the small wood in the shed. "The old house will not be the old  house without you. Suzanne wishes it also.  Parbleu  ! Is it  the custom for the fathers to turn their sons out, when they marry ?  Then, why should I let the old sister go, now my time for  marrying has come ? Suzanne is a good girl and pretty ; and has  never even looked at any young fellow in the village—for I, as you  know, am particular, and I like not the manners in some villages,  where a girl's modesty is counted nothing—but blood is worth the  most,  ma foi , as the old father used to say ; and badly must he  think of me to see the old sister making room even for the little  Suzanne." But Jeanne-Marie shook her head. "I cannot well explain it,  Firman," she said. "It's not that your Suzanne comes unwelcome  to me—no, the good God knows it's not that—but it would be so 222  Jeanne-Marie so strange. I should see the old mother's shadow, at the table  where you sat, and in the bed where you lay. I might get foolish,  and angry, Firman. So let me go, and, when the little ones come,  I shall be their grandmother, and Suzanne will forgive me." That was four and a half years ago, and it was a very lonely  four and a half years at the white cottage. Even the cooking,  when it was for herself alone, became uninteresting, and the zest  went out of it. Jeanne-Marie, in her loneliness, hungered for the  animal life that had unconsciously formed a great part of her  existence at the  métairie . Every springtime she would sit, some-  times for hours, in her garden, watching the flocks of callow geese,  as they wandered along the road in front of the mill, pecking at  the ground as they went, and uttering all the time their little plaintive cries, that soothed her with its echo of the old home.  When the boys in their bérets, with their long poles and their loud  cries of "guà, guà," drove the cows and the oxen home from the  fields at sunset, Jeanne-Marie would come out of her cottage, and  watch the patient, sleek beasts, as they dawdled along. And she  would think longingly of the evenings at the  métairie , when she  never missed going out to see the oxen, as they lay contentedly on  their prickly bedding, moving their heavy jaws slowly up  and down, too lazy even to look up as she entered. Firman loved his oxen, for they were well trained and strong,  and did good work ; but Jeanne-Marie would have laughed in  those days, had she been told she loved the animals of the farm.  "I remember," she said to Marthe of the mill one day, "how I  said to the old father years ago : When the children of M.  François came to the  métairie , it is—"Oh, Jeanne-Marie, you will  not kill that pretty little grey hen with the feathered legs," and "Oh ! Jeanne-Marie, you must not drown so many kittens this time" :  but I say to them always : "My children, the rich have their toys and By Leila Macdonald  223 and have the time and money to make toys of their animals ; but  to us poor folk they are the useful creatures God has given us  for food and work, and they are not playthings."' : So I said then ; but  now, ah, now Marthe, it is different. Do you remember how  old Dubois for ever quarrelled with young Baptiste, but when they  wrote from the regiment to tell him the boy was dead of fever,  during the great manoeuvres, do you remember how the old father  mourned, and lay on his bed for a whole day, fasting ? So it  always is, Marthe. The cow butts the calf with her horns, but  when the calf is gone, the mother moans for it all the day." Firman was too busy with his farm and his new family ties to  come much to see his sister, or to notice how rarely she came  up to the  métairie  now. For Suzanne had never forgiven, and  that was why Jeanne-Marie walked up so seldom to M. François's métairie . Did not all the village say that it was Suzanne's doing that  Firman's sister left the farm on his marriage ? That Suzanne's  jealousy had driven Jeanne-Marie away ? And when this came  to the ears of Firman's wife, and the old folks shook their heads in  her presence over the strange doings of young couples now-a-  days, the relief that the dreaded division of supremacy with her  husband's sister was spared her, was lost in anger against Jeanne-  Marie, as the cause of this village scandal. The jealousy that she  had always felt for the "chѐre soeur," whom Firman loved and  respected, leapt up within her. "People say he loves his sister,  and that it is I who part them ; they shall see—yes, they shall  see." And bit by bit, with all a woman's subtle diplomacy, she drew  her husband away from his sister's affection, until in a year or two  their close intimacy had weakened to a gradually slackening  friendship. At 224  Jeanne-Marie At night-time, when Firman's passionate southern nature lay  under the thrall of his wife's beauty, she would whisper to him in  her soft  patois , "Love me well, my husband, for I have only you  to love ; others are jealous of my happiness, and even Jeanne- Marie is envious of your wife, and of the babe that is to come." And the hot Spanish blood, that his mother had given him,  would leap to Firman's face as he took her in his arms, and swore  that all he loved, loved her ; and those who angered her, he cared  not for. In the  year of their marriage, when Jeanne-Marie came  almost every day, Suzanne would show her with pride all the  changes and alterations in the old house. "See here, my sister,"  she said to her one day, only six months after the wedding, when  she was taking her over the house, "this room that was yours, we  have dismantled for the time ; did it not seem a pity to keep an  unused room all furnished, for the sun to tarnish, and the damp to  spoil ?" And Jeanne-Marie, as she looked round on the bare  walls and the empty corners of the little room, where she and  Catherine had slept together in the old days, answered quietly,  "Quite true, Suzanne, quite true ; it would be a great pity." That night when she and Marthe sat together in the kitchen  she told her of the incident. "But, Jeanne-Marie," Marthe interrupted eagerly, "how was  it you had left your furniture there, since it was yours ?" "How was it? But because little Catherine had slept in the  old bed, and sat in the old chairs, and how could I take them  away from the room ?" "Better that than let Suzanne break them up for firewood,"  Marthe replied shortly. When little Henri was born, a year after the marriage, Suzanne  would not let Jeanne-Marie be at the  métairie , and she sent Firman By Leila Macdonald  225 Firman down beforehand to tell her that she feared the excitement  of her presence. Jeanne-Marie knew she was disliked and dis-  trusted ; but this blow fell very heavily : though she raised her  head proudly and looked her brother full in the face when he  stammered out his wife's wishes. "For the sake of our name, and what they will say in the  village, I am sorry for this," she said ; and Firman went without a  word. But when he was gone Jeanne-Marie's pride broke down, and  in the darkness of the evening she gathered her shawl round her,  and crept up to the  métairie  door. Hour after hour she sat there, not heeding the cold or the damp,  her head buried in her hands, her body rocked backwards and  forwards. "I pray for Firman's child," she muttered without  ceasing. "O dear Virgin! O blessed Virgin! I pray for my  brother's child." And when at length an infant's feeble cry pierced  through the darkness, Jeanne-Marie rose and tottered home, saying  to herself contentedly, "The good God himself tells me that all is  well." Perhaps the pangs of maternity quickened the capabilities for  compassion in Suzanne's peasant mind. She sent for Jeanne-  Marie two days later, and watched her with silent wonder, but  without a sneer, as she knelt weeping and trembling before the  small new bundle of humanity. From that day little Henri was the idol of Jeanne-Marie's  heart. All the sane instincts of wifehood and motherhood, shut  up irrevocably within the prison of her maiden life, found vent in  her devotion to her brother's child. The natural impulses, so  long denied freedom, of whose existence and force she was not  even aware, avenged their long suppression in this worship of  Firman's boy. To 226  Jeanne-Marie To watch the growth of the childish being, the unveiling of  his physical comeliness, and the gradual awakening of his percep-  tions, became the interest and fascination of her life. Every  morning at eleven o'clock, when the cottage showed within the  open door all white and shining after her energetic scrubbings, she  would put on a clean bodice, and a fresh pink handkerchief for  the little coil of hair at the back of her head, and sit ready and  impatient, knitting away the time, till one o'clock struck, and she  could start for the farm. She would always arrive at the same hour, when the  métairie dinner was finished, and Suzanne's fretful complaints: "Jeanne- Marie, you are so proud, you will not come for the dinner or stay  for the supper," met only a smile and a deprecating shake of the  head. On her arrival, if Suzanne were in a good temper, she would  surrender Henri to her, and Jeanne-Marie's hour of heaven  reached her. If it were cold, she would sit in the kitchen,  crooning snatches of old tunes, or chattering soft nothings in patois  to the sleeping child. If fine, she would wander round the  garden with him in her arms, sometimes as far as the road, where  a chance passer's exclamation of "Oh, le beau bébé !" would  flush her face with pleasure. If Suzanne's temper chanced to be ruffled, if Firman had dis-  pleased her, or if the fitful jealousy that sprang up at times against  her belle-soeur , happened to be roused, she would insist that little  Henri was tired, and must not be moved ; and Jeanne-Marie would  sit for hours sadly watching the cot, in which the child lay, not  daring to touch him or comfort him, even when he moaned and  moved his arms restlessly in his sleep. So her life went on till Henri was about a year old, when  Suzanne's gradually increasing exasperation reached an ungovern- able By Leila Macdonald  227 able pitch. To her jealous imagination it had seemed for some  time that the boy clung more to her sister than to her, and one  day things reached a climax. Jeanne-Marie had arrived with a toy bought for three sous from  a travelling pedlar, and the child had screamed, and cried, because  his mother, alleging that he was tired, refused to allow Jeanne-  Marie to take him or show him the toy. The boy screamed  louder and louder, and Jeanne-Marie sat, silent and troubled, in her  corner. Even Firman, who was yoking his oxen in the yard,  came in hurriedly, hearing the noise, and finding nothing wrong,  pleaded with his wife. "Mais, voyons, Suzanne," he began,  persuasively, "if le petit wants to see his toy, la tante may show  it him, n'est ce pas ?" And Suzanne, unable to bear it any  longer, almost threw her child into Jeanne-Marie's lap, bursting  out, "Take him, then, and draw my baby's love from me, as you  please. I want no child who hates his mother." And sobbing loudly, she rushed out. Firman followed her, his handsome face  puckered with perplexity, and Jeanne-Marie and the baby were  left alone. She bent low down over the deep Spanish eyes that  were so like her own, and, while her tears dropped on his face,  she held him to her feverishly. "Adieu," she whispered,  "adieu, petit Henri. La tante must not come to see him any  more, and Henri must be a good boy and love his mother."  And with one long look at the child's eyes fixed on her so  wonderingly, Jeanne-Marie rose softly and left the farm. From that day started the great conflict between her love and  her pride. Though, to her simple nature, the jealousy of a woman  who seemed to her to have in abundance everything that made life  worth living, was utterly incomprehensible, she said to herself  over and over as she went home, that such a scene as that should  never happen again. And as she lay in her narrow bed that night, and 228  Jeanne-Marie and made her resolution for the future, she seemed to feel the very fibres of her heart break within her. Firman came down next day to beg his sister to behave as if  nothing had happened. "You are pale and your face is all drawn, chѐre soeur ," he told her reproachfully ; "but you must not take  the things like that. If poor Suzanne were herself and well, she  would never have spoken as she did." But Jeanne-Marie smiled  at him. "If I am pale, Firman, it is not for worrying over Suzanne.  Tell her from me, I have been selfish all this time. I will not be  so again. When she can spare the little Henri, she shall send him  to play here with me, by Anna." Anna was Suzanne's sixteen-  year-old sister, who lived almost entirely at the  métairie  since her  sister's marriage. "And every Sunday afternoon I will come up, and will sit with him in the garden as I used to do. Tell this to Suzanne, with my love." And Firman told her ; and mingled with the relief that  Suzanne felt, that the face and figure which had become like a  nightmare to her strained nerves, would appear only once a week  at the farm, was gratitude that her sister had taken things so well.  "Anna shall take him every other day," she observed to Firman,  "she shall see I am not jealous; it was the pain that took me  suddenly yesterday, while you were speaking. For that matter,  in the afternoon there is always much for me to do, and little  Henri can very well go with Anna to the cottage." And no doubt she meant to keep her promise, but she was  occupied mind and body with other things. The second baby  would be born in a month, and in the afternoons, when she sat,  languid and tired, she liked to have her sister Anna by her, and  Henri playing by her side. And after little Catherine was born, there was much for Anna to By Leila Macdonald  229 to do. "I could not well spare her if I would," Suzanne would  say to herself; "what with two babies and me so long in getting  on my feet this time." And Jeanne-Marie put on the clean white bodice every day  before her dinner, and sat in the little garden with her eyes fixed  on the turning in the white road that led to M. François's  métairie ,  but it was not more than one day a week that Anna would come  in sight, with little Henri in her arms. The other days Jeanne-  Marie would sit, shading her eyes and watching, till long after the  hour when she could expect them to appear. At , after the quarrel, she had believed in Suzanne's reiterated assurances that "Anna would come every other day or so," and  many were the wasted afternoons of disappointment that she courted  in her little garden. Sometimes she would rise to her feet, and a  sudden impulse to go up to the farm, not a mile away, if only to  kiss  le petit  and come home again, laid hold of her ; but the memory  of Suzanne's cold looks of surprise, and the "Is anything wrong,  Jeanne-Marie ?" that would meet her, was sufficient to force her  into her chair again with a little hopeless sigh. "When the calf  is gone, the mother mourns for it all the day," Marthe said grimly,  when she surprised her one day watching the white turning. But Jeanne-Marie answered her miserably: "Ah, but I never  butt at my calf, and they have taken it from me all the  same." There was great rejoicing in the cottage the day that Anna's  white blouse and large green umbrella came in sight, and the three  sat in the kitchen together : Anna eating smilingly the cakes and  biscuits that grateful Jeanne-Marie made specially for her, and  Henri crawling happily on the floor. "He said 'Maman' to  Suzanne yesterday," Anna would announce, as Jeanne-Marie  hurried to meet her at the gate ; or, "Firman says he heard him 230  Jeanne-Marie him say 'Menou,' when the white cat ran across the yard this  morning." And many were the attempts to induce Henri to  make these utterances again. "Je t'aime, je t'aime," Jeanne-  Marie would murmur to him, as she kissed him again and again,  and the little boy would look up at her with his dark eyes, and  smile encouragingly. All too quickly the time would go, and all too soon would come  Anna's glance at the clock, and the dreaded words : "Suzanne  will make herself angry ; we must go." And as Jeanne-Marie watched them disappear along the white  road, the clouds of her loneliness would gather round her again. The Sunday afternoons at the farm were looked forward to  through all the week. There was little Catherine to admire,  and in the summer days there was the orchard, where  Henri loved to play, and where he and his aunt would sit  together all the afternoon. If Suzanne were in a good temper,  she would bring Catherine out in her arms, and the children would  tumble about together in the long grass. And so the time wore on, and as Henri grew in mind and  body, and was able to prattle and run about the fields, Jeanne-  Marie hungered for him with a love more absorbing than  ever. Two years had passed since Catherine's birth, and for the last  year Anna would often bring her, when she came down to Jeanne-  Marie's cottage. The one day a week had dropped gradually to  every ten days ; it was sometimes only every fortnight that one  or both children would appear, and the days that little Henri came  were marked white days on the simple calendar of Jeanne-Marie's  heart. Now, By Leila Macdonald  231 V Now, as Jeanne-Marie stood in her garden this hot May after-  noon, and shaded her eyes, as she gazed at the broad white road, her  face was troubled, and there was a drawn line of apprehension round  the corners of her mouth. For lately Suzanne's jealous temper  had flamed up again, and this alert jealousy boded evil days for  Jeanne-Marie. Several times within the last two months, little Henri—now  going on for four years old—had come toddling down to the  cottage by himself, to his aunt's unbounded amazement and delight.  "Maman is at market," he explained with dignity the  time,  in answer to the wondering queries. "Papa yoked the oxen to  the big cart after dinner, and they went ; Anna is talking all the  afternoon to Pierre Puyoo in the road ; and Henri was alone. So  Henri came ; Henri loves his aunt, and would like some biscuits."  Great was the content of that hour in the cottage, when Jeanne-  Marie sat in the big arm-chair, and the boy prattled and ate his  biscuits on her knee. Anna's hard young smile, that scorned  emotion, was always a  gêne  to this harmony of old and young ;  also, there was no need to glance anxiously at the clock ;  for the oxen take two hours to get home from the market, and  who leaves the town till late in the afternoon ? "Anna will miss le petit ," Jeanne-Marie suggested the  time ; but he answered  proudly : "She will think  le petit  takes care of the geese in  the meadow ; do I not have charge of all the geese many  afternoons ? And when I am six years old, papa has pro-  mised I may guard the cows, and bring them home to milk  at sundown, as André Puyoo and Georges Vidal do, each day. 232  Jeanne-Marie day. Also, why cannot Henri come to see  la tante when he  likes ?" But nevertheless, the second and  occasions of these happy  visits, always on market-days, Jeanne-Marie became uneasy. Did  Suzanne know of the boy's absences ? Were those fitful jealousies  she now displayed almost every Sunday, the result of her know-  ledge ? And if she did not know, would there not be a burst of  rage when she heard ? Should Jeanne-Marie risk this joy by  telling her of its existence, and asking her permission for its con-  tinuance ? How well the hard tones of Suzanne's voice, framing  each plausible objection, came to her mind, as she thought. No,  she could not do it. Let the child come, and go on coming every  market-day, for as long as he could. She would say no word to  encourage his keeping it secret from his mother ; he would tell her  one day, if he had not told her already, and then, if anger there  was, surely the simple words, "May not your child visit his aunt  alone ?" must bring peace again. So Jeanne-Marie reasoned away her fears. But now, as she  stood in her garden, her lips were trembling with anxiety. Last Sunday she had been too ill to go up to the farm. A  sudden agonising breathlessness, together with great dizziness,  had forced her to bed, and Marthe's boy had gone up with the  message. But neither that day nor the next, which was market-  day, nor any following day, had Suzanne, or Anna, or little Henri  come to see her. And to-day was Saturday. And she realised  wearily that to-morrow she could not get to the farm ; she felt too  ill and feeble. "My heart aches," she said to Marthe each day,  "my heart aches." The afternoon waned slowly, and the little group at the café  increased in numbers, as the men sauntered through the village at  sundown. The women stood at their doors, laughing and chatting with By Leila Macdonald  233 with one another. M. le Curé passed down the street, smiling at  the children. From the meadows came the cows and oxen, driven  slowly along, their bells beating low harmonies as they went.  The festive air of evening after a hot day touched all the tiny  town. And Jeanne-Marie stood in her garden, waiting. Suddenly, while she watched, her heart bounded within her,  and a spasm of sudden pain drove the colour from her face, for she  recognised the figure that was passing from the white turning  into the broad road. Suzanne—Suzanne, who had not been near  her cottage for a year—Suzanne, alone. She pressed her two hands  under her left breast, and moved forward to the gate. She felt  now she had known it for long. All the suspense of many days  had given way to a dull certainty : little Henri was ill, was  dying perhaps, and Suzanne had come with the news. Jeanne-Marie had her hand on the latch to let her through ;  but she stood outside the gate, and said hoarsely, "I will not come  in." Her face was flushed, there was no cap over her coil of  brown hair, and she had on the dark dress she never wore except  at the farm. All this Jeanne-Marie noticed mechanically, while  that suffocating hurry at her heart seemed to eat away her energy  and her power of speech. But Suzanne was going to speak. The colour flamed into her  face, and her teeth ground together, as if to force down the violence  of her feeling, and then she spoke : "Jeanne-Marie, you have  done your work well. We knew you loved our boy. You were  careful always to show us how far greater was your love for him  than ours. And as you could not well turn him against me  before my eyes, you waited— ma foi , how well you did it !—you  waited till I was well away, and then, you taught him to sneak  down to see you, and sneak home again before my return.  Mon  Dieu  ! it was a worthy son to us you wished to make of him. But 234  Jeanne-Marie But it could not be, Jeanne-Marie. Your good God, you love  so well, would not have it and so ;"—there came a sob in her voice  that she choked down, and Jeanne-Marie's face went a shade greyer  as she listened—"it happened that I was long at the market last  week, and you, knowing this would be so, because it was a big  market, brought him home late, when the fever was springing  from the marshes—it was Marguerite Vallée saw him and came  and told me—and now these four days he has lain with fever, and  the officier de santé tells us there grows something in his throat  that may kill him in four days." The hard tones left her voice in the last phrase. A shadow  of the love she persuaded herself she felt for Henri sprang up, and  choked her anger. She forgot Jeanne-Marie for the moment, and  saw only the little figure tossing with fever and delirium, and  pity for her own sorrow filled her eyes with tears. She was  surprised at the calm cruelty of her own words. Looking up  curiously to see how her sister would take it, she started, for  Jeanne-Marie's face seemed suddenly to have grown old and grey.  She was struggling breathlessly to speak, and when her voice  came, it sounded far off, and weak like the voice of a sick child : "You know well that in your anger you have lied to me.  Henri may be ill—and dying ; it is not I who have made him so.  You shall listen to me now, though I will not keep you here  long ; for the hand that struck my mother suddenly through  the heart, struck me while you were speaking. You have kept  me all these days in suspense, and now you have given the  blow. Be satisfied, Suzanne." She paused, and the sound of her heavy breathing struck  Suzanne's frightened senses like the knell of a doom. "Listen to me. Henri came to me of his own will, and  never did I persuade him or suggest to him to come. Never did By Leila Macdonald  235 did he go home later than four o'clock; there was nothing done in  secret ; neither I, nor any in the village, thought it a crime he  came to visit me. Often I have seen him keeping the geese in  the long grass of the meadows at six, at seven o'clock. Seek  the fever there—not on the village road before the sunset. As  the good God hears me, never have I stood between that boy  and his mother. Gradually you took from me every privilege  my affection knew ; but I said nothing. Ah, I loved him dearly ; I was content to wait. But all that is over. If God  grants me life—but He is good, and I think He knows my  suffering all these years—I swear before Him your house shall be  to me a house of strangers, Henri the child of strangers, and my  brother's face unknown to me. Never shall my father's daughter  hear again what I have heard from you to-day. All these years  you have played upon my heart. You have watched the suffering;  you have known how each word seemed so innocent, but stabbed  so deep. You have seen your child wind himself round my  heart, and every day, every hour, you have struggled to pluck  him from me. Now, I tell you I tear your children from my heart ; you have killed not only my body, but my love. Go,  and leave me for ever, or by my father, I will curse you where  you stand." She tottered forward, and with one horrified look at the agony of  her menacing face, Suzanne turned and ran. And Jeanne-Marie fell all her length on the garden soil. The Yellow Book—Vol. III.  o The 236   Jeanne-Marie VI The miller's boy saw her there, when he came past a few  minutes later, and not daring to touch her, ran to the mill  for help. Marthe and her husband came immediately and carried  her into the cottage. At , they thought she was dead, her  face was so grey and sunken ; but she came to herself, as they  laid her on the bed, and shook her head faintly when Marthe  suggested fetching the officier de santé. As soon as she could speak she whispered : "No, Marthe, it  is the illness of the heart that killed my mother. The doctor  told her she might have lived to be old, with much care, and if  no great trouble or excitement had come to her ; but, you see, I  was much troubled just now, and so it has come earlier. Do  not send for any doctor ; he could but call it by the long name  they called it when my mother died, and trouble one with vain  touches and questions." So Marthe helped her to undress, and to get to bed quickly.  The breathlessness and the pain had gone for a time, though she  was very feeble, and could scarcely stand on her feet. But it was  the grey look of her face that frightened Marthe, and her strained  quietness. No questions could get out of her the story of the  afternoon. "Suzanne came to tell me little Henri was ill," was all she  would say ; but Marthe only shook her head, and made her own  deductions. Jeanne-Marie would not hear of her staying with her for the  night, and leaving her young children alone, and so it was settled  the miller's boy should sleep below in the kitchen, and if Jeanne- Marie By Leila Macdonald  237 Marie felt ill in the night, she would call to him, and he would  fetch Marthe immediately. Also, Marthe promised to call at the house of M. le Curé on  her way home. He would be out late, since he had started only an  hour ago to take the Host to old Goupé, who lay dying four  kilometres away ; but she would leave a message, and certainly,  when he returned, however late, he would come round. It was  nine o'clock before Marthe would leave, and even then she  stopped reluctantly at the door, with a last look at the thin figure  propped up on her pillows. "Let me stay, Jeanne-Marie," she  said ; "you are so pale, and yet your eyes burn. I do not like to  think of the long night and you sitting here." "It is easier than when I lie down, which brings the breathless-  ness. Do not worry yourself, Marthe, I shall sleep perhaps, and  if I need anything, I have but to call to Jean below. Good-night,  and thank you, Marthe." The little house was very quiet. Jean had been asleep on his  chair this hour past, and not a sound came from the slumbering  village. There was no blind to the window of the bedroom, and  Jeanne-Marie watched the moon, as it escaped slowly from the  unwilling clouds, and threw its light on to the foot of the narrow bed. For a long while she lay there, without moving, while through  all her troubled, confused thoughts ran like an under-current the  dull pain that wrenched at her heart. It seemed to take the  coherency from her thinking, and to be the one unquiet factor in  the calm that had come over her. She was surprised, herself, at  this strange fatigue that had swept away even her suffering.  She thought of little Henri and his illness without a pang. He  seemed like some far-off person she had read about, or heard of,  long ago. She 238  Jeanne-Marie She thought to herself, vaguely, that she must be dying, since  she seemed to have lost all feeling. Bit by bit, various little scenes between her and Henri came to  her mind, with an extraordinary vividness. He was sitting on her  knee in the cottage, and his clear child's voice rang like a bell in  the silent room—so clearly, that Jeanne-Marie started, and  wondered if she were light-headed or had been dreaming. Then  the voice faded away, and she saw the cool, high grass of the  orchard, and there was Henri laughing at her, and rolling among  the flowers. How cool and fresh it looked ; and Henri was  asking her to come and play : "Tante Jeanne-Marie, viens jouer  avec ton petit. Tante Jeanne-Marie, tante Jeanne-Marie !" She  must throw herself on the grass with him—on the cool, waving grass. And she bent forward with outstretched arms ; but the  movement brought her to herself, and as she lay back on her  pillows, suddenly the reality of suffering rushed back upon her,  with the agonising sense of separation and of loss. Little Henri  was dying ; was dead perhaps ; never to hear his voice, or feel his  warm little arms round her neck. She could do nothing for him ;  he must die without her. "Tante Jeanne-Marie ! Tante Jeanne-  Marie !" Was he calling her, from his feverish little bed ? If he  called, she must go to him, she could not lie here, this suffering  was choking her. She must have air, and space to breathe in; this  room was suffocating her. She must go to Henri. With a  desperate effort she struggled to her feet, and stood supporting  herself by the bed-post. The moon, that had hidden itself in the  clouds, struggled out, the long, old-fashioned glass hanging on the  wall opposite the bed became one streak of light, and Jeanne- Marie, gazing at herself, met the reflection of her own face, and  knew that no power on earth could make her reach the farm where  little Henri lay. She By Leila Macdonald  239 She stood, as if spell-bound, marking the sunken look of the  eyes, the grey-blue colour of the cheeks, the face that was the face  of an old woman. A sudden, fierce revolt against her starved life swept through  her at the sight, and conquered even the physical pain raging at  her heart. Still struggling for breath, she threw up her arms and  tore the cotton nightgown from her shoulders, and stood there  beating her breast with her hands. "Oh, good God ! good God ! see here what I am. How old  and shrunken before my time ! Cursed be these breasts, that no  child has ever suckled ; cursed be this withered body, that no man  has ever embraced. I could have loved, and lived long, and been  made beautiful by happiness. Ah, why am I accursed ? I die,  unloved and neglected by my own people. No children's tears,  no husband to close my eyes ; old, worn out, before my time. A  woman only in name—not wife, not mother. Despised and  hideous before God and men—God and men." Her voice died away in a moan, her head fell forward on her  breast, and she stumbled against the bed. For a long time she  lay crouched there, insensible from mere exhaustion, until, just  as the clocks were striking midnight, the door opened gently,  and Marthe and M. le Curé came in. Jean, awakened by the  sounds overhead, had run quickly for Marthe, and coming back  together, they had met M. le Curé on his way. They raised her gently, and laid her on the bed, and finding  she still breathed, Marthe ran to fetch brandy, and the Curé knelt  by the bed in prayer. Presently, the eyes opened quietly, and M. le Curé saw her  lips move. He bent over her, and whispered : "You are troubled,  Jeanne-Marie ; you wish for the absolution ?" But her voice came back to her, and she said clearly : "To 240  Jeanne-Marie "To die unloved, unmourned ; a woman, but no wife ; no  mother." She closed her eyes again. There were noises singing in her  head, louder and louder ; but the pain at her heart had ceased,  She was conscious only of a great loneliness, as if a curtain had  risen, and shut her off from the room ; and again the words came,  whispered from her lips : "A woman, accursed and wasted ; no  mother and no wife." But some one was speaking, speaking so loudly that the sounds  in her head seemed to die away. She opened her eyes, and saw  M. le Curé, where he knelt, with his eyes shining on her face, and  heard his voice saying : "And God said, 'Blessed be the virgins  above all women ; give unto them the holy places ; let them be  exalted and praised by My church, before all men, and before Me.  Worthy are they to sit at My feet—worthy are they above all  women.'" A smile of infinite happiness and of supreme relief lit up Jeanne- Marie's face. "Above all women," she whispered : "above all women." And Jeanne-Marie bowed her head, and died. Parson Herrick's Muse By C. W.

George the By Max Beerbohm A Note on George the By Max Beerbohm THEY say that when King George was dying, a special form  of prayer for his recovery, composed by one of the Arch-  bishops, was read aloud to him, and that his Majesty, after saying  Amen "thrice, with great fervour," begged that his thanks  might be conveyed to its author. To the student of royalty in  modern times there is something rather suggestive in this  incident. I like to think of the drug-scented room at Windsor,  and of the King, livid and immobile among his pillows, waiting,  in superstitious awe, for the near moment when he must stand, a  spirit, in the presence of a perpetual King. I like to think of him  following the futile prayer with eyes and lips, and then, custom  resurgent in him and a touch of pride that, so long as the blood moved ever so little in his veins, he was still a king, expressing a desire that the dutiful feeling and admirable taste of  the Prelate should receive a suitable acknowledgment. It would  have been impossible for a real monarch like George, even after  the gout had turned his thoughts heavenward, really to abase him-  self before his Maker. But he could, so to say, treat with him,  as he might have treated with a fellow-sovereign, long after  diplomacy was quite useless. How strange it must be to be a king !  How delicate and difficult a task it is to judge him ! So far as 248  A Note on George the as I know, no fair attempt has been made to form an estimate  of George the . The hundred and one eulogies and  lampoons, published irresponsibly during and immediately after  his reign, are not worth a wooden hoop in Hades. Mr. Percy  Fitzgerald has published a history of George's reign, in which  he has so artistically subordinated his own personality to his  subject, that I can scarcely find from beginning to end of the  two bulky volumes a single opinion expressed, a single idea, a  single deduction from the admirably arranged facts. All that most of us know of George is from Thackeray's brilliant denun-  ciation. Now, I yield to few in my admiration of Thackeray's  powers. He had a charming style. We never find him searching  for the  mot juste  as for a needle in a bottle of hay. Could he  have looked through a certain window by the river at Croisset,  or in the quadrangle at Brasenose, how he would have laughed !  He blew on his pipe, and words came tripping round him, like  children, like pretty little children who are perfectly drilled for  the dance, or came, did he will it, treading in their precedence,  like kings, gloomily. And I think it is to the credit of the  reading mob that, by reason of his beautiful style, all that he  said was taken for the truth, without questioning. But truth  after all is eternal, and style transient, and now that Thackeray's  style is becoming, if I may say so, a trifle 1860, it may not  be amiss that we should inquire whether his estimate of George  is in substance and fact worth anything at all. It seems to me  that, as in his novels, so in his history of the four Georges, Thackeray made no attempt at psychology. He dealt simply  with types. One George he insisted upon regarding as a buffoon,  another as a yokel. The  George he chose to hold up  for reprobation as a drunken, vapid cad. Every action, every  phase of his life that went to disprove this view, he either suppressed By Max Beerbohm  249 suppressed or distorted utterly. "History," he would seem to  have chuckled, "has nothing to do with the  Gentleman.  But I will give him a niche in Natural History. He shall be  king of the Beasts." He made no allowance for the extraordinary  conditions under which any monarch finds himself, none for the  unfortunate circumstances by which George was from the   hampered. He judged him as he judged Barnes Newcome and  all the scoundrels he created. Moreover, he judged him by the  moral standard of the Victorian Age. In fact he applied to  his subject the wrong method in the wrong manner, and at the  wrong time. And yet every one has taken him at his word. I  feel that my essay may be scouted as a paradox ; but I hope  that many may recognise that I am not, out of mere boredom,  endeavouring to stop my ears against popular platitude, but rather,  in a spirit of real earnestness, to point out to the mob how it has  been cruel to George. I do not despair of success. I think I  shall make converts. For the mob is notoriously fickle, and so  occasionally cheers the truth. None, at all events, will deny that England to-day stands other-  wise than she stood a hundred and thirty-two years ago, when  George was born. We to-day are living a decadent life. All  the while that we are prating of progress, we are really so deterio-  rate ! There is nothing but feebleness in us. Our youths who  spend their days in trying to build up their constitutions by sport or  athletics, and their evenings in undermining them with poisonous  and dyed drinks, our daughters who are ever searching for some  new quack remedy for new imaginary megrim, what strength is  there in them ? We have our societies for the prevention of this  and the promotion of that and the propagation of the other, because  there are no individuals among us. Our sexes are already nearly  assimilate. Real women are becoming nearly as rare as real ladies, and 250  A Note on George the and it is only at the music halls that we are privileged to see  strong men. We are born into a poor, weak age. We are not  strong enough to be wicked, and the Nonconformist Conscience  makes cowards of us all. But this was not so in the days when George was walking by  his tutor's side in the gardens of Kew or of Windsor. London  must have been a splendid place in those days—full of life and  colour and wrong and revelry. There was no absurd press nor  vestry to see that everything should be neatly ordered, nor to  protect the poor at the expense of the rich. Every man had to  shift for himself and, in consequence, men were, as Mr. Clement  Scott would say, manly, and women, as Mr. Clement Scott would  say, womanly. A young man of wealth and family in that period  found open to him a vista of such license as had been unknown  to any since the barbatuli of the Roman Empire. To spend the  early morning with his valet, gradually assuming the rich apparel  that was not then tabooed by a false sumptuary standard ; to  saunter round to White's for ale and tittle-tattle and the making  of wagers ; to attend a "drunken déjeûner" in honour of "la très belle Rosaline" or the Strappini ; to drive a friend out into  the country in his pretty curricle, "followed by two well-dressed  and well-mounted grooms, of singular elegance certainly," and stop  at every tavern on the road to curse the host for not keeping better  ale and a wench of more charm ; to reach St. James' in time for  a random toilet and so off to dinner. Which of  our  dandies could  survive a day of pleasures such as this ? Which would be ready,  dinner done, to scamper off again to Ranelagh and dance and skip  and sup in the rotunda there ? Yet the youth of this period would  not dream of going to bed before he had looked in at White's or  Crockford's for a few hours' faro. This was the kind of life that young George found opened to him, By Max Beerbohm  251 him, when, in his nineteenth year, he at length was given an estab- lishment of his own in Buckingham House. How his young eyes  must have sparkled, and with what glad gasps must he have taken  the air of freedom into his lungs. Rumour had long been busy  with the confounded surveillance under which his childhood had  been passed. A paper of the time says significantly that "the  Prince of Wales, with a spirit which does him honour, has three  times requested a change in that system." For a long time King  George had postponed permission for his son to appear at any balls,  and the year before had only given it, lest he should offend the  Spanish Minister, who begged it as a personal favour. I know few  pictures more pathetic than that of George, then an overgrown  boy of fourteen, tearing the childish frill from around his neck  and crying to one of the royal servants, "See how they treat me !" Childhood has always seemed to me the tragic period of  life—to be subject to the most odious espionage at the one age when  you never dream of doing wrong, to be deceived by your parents,  thwarted of your smallest wish, oppressed by the terrors of manhood  and of the world to come, and to believe, as you are told, that child- hood is the only happiness known : all this is quite terrible. And all  Royal children, of whom I have read, particularly George, seem to  have passed through greater trials in childhood than do the children  of any other class. Mr. Fitzgerald, hazarding for once an opinion,  thinks that "the stupid, odious, German, sergeant-system of disci-  pline that had been so rigorously applied, was, in fact, responsible for  the blemishes of the young Prince's character." Even Thackeray,  in his essay upon George III., asks what wonder that the son,  finding himself free at last, should have plunged, without looking,  into the vortex of dissipation. In Torrens's "Life of Lord Mel-  bourne" we learn that Lord Essex, riding one day with the King,  met the young prince wearing a wig, and that the culprit, being sternly 252  A Note on George the sternly reprimanded by his father, replied that he had "been  ordered by his doctor to wear a wig, for he was subject to cold."  Whereupon the King, whether to vent the aversion he already felt  for his son or in complacence at the satisfactory result of his  discipline, turned to Lord Essex and remarked, "A lie is ever  ready when it is wanted." George never lost this early-engrained  habit of lies. It is to George's childish fear of his guardians  that we must trace that extraordinary power of bamboozling his  courtiers, his ministry and his mistresses that distinguished him  through his long life. It is characteristic of the man that he  should himself have bitterly deplored his own untruthfulness.  When, in after years, he was consulting Lady Spencer upon the  choice of a governess for his child he made this remarkable speech,  "Above all, she must be taught the truth. You know that I don't speak the truth and my brothers don't, and I find it a great defect, from which I would have my daughter free.  We have  been brought up badly, the Queen having taught us to equivocate ."  You may laugh at the picture of the little chubby, curly-heeded  fellows learning to equivocate at their mother's knee, but you  must remember that the wisest master of ethics himself, in his  theory of έξεις άποϭείκτικαι, similarly raised virtues, such as telling  the truth, to the level of regular accomplishments, and before you  judge poor George harshly, in his entanglements of lying, re- member the cruelly unwise education he had undergone. However much we may deplore this exaggerated tyranny, by  reason of its evil effect upon his moral nature, we cannot but feel  glad that it existed, to afford a piquant contrast to the life awaiting  him. Had he passed through the callow dissipations of Eton and  Oxford, like other young men of his age, he would assuredly have  lacked much of that splendid pent vigour with which he rushed  headlong into London life. He was so young and so handsome, and By Max Beerbohm  253 and so strong, that can we wonder if all the women fell at his feet ? "The graces of his person," says one whom he honoured by an  intrigue, "the irresistible sweetness of his smile, the tenderness of  his melodious, yet manly voice, will be remembered by me till every  vision of this changing scene are forgotten. The polished and  fascinating ingenuousness of his manners contributed not a little  to enliven our promenade. He sang with exquisite taste, and the  tones of his voice, breaking on the silence of the night, have often  appeared to my entranced senses like more than mortal melody."  But besides his graces of person, he had a most delightful wit, he  was a scholar who could bandy quotations with Fox or Sheridan ;  and, like the young men of to-day, he knew all about Art. He  spoke French, Italian, and German perfectly, and Crossdill had  taught him the violoncello. At , as was right for one of  his age, he cared more for the pleasures of the table and of the  ring, for cards and love. He was wont to go down to Ranelagh  surrounded by a retinue of bruisers—rapscallions, such as used to  follow Clodius through the streets of Rome, and he loved to join  in the scuffles like any commoner. He learnt to box from Angelo,  and was considered by some to be a fine performer. On one occasion, too, at an  exposition d'escrime , he handled the foils against  the  maître , and "was highly complimented upon his graceful  postures." In fact, in spite of his accomplishments, he seems to  have been a thoroughly manly young fellow. He was just the  kind of figure-head Society had long been in need of. A certain  lack of tone had crept into the amusements of the haut monde ,  and this was doubtless due to the lack of an acknowledged  leader. The King was not yet mad, but he was always bucolic,  and socially out of the question. So at the coming of his son  Society broke into a gallop. Balls and masquerades were given in  his honour night after night. Good Samaritans must have The Yellow Book—Vol. III.  P approved 254  A Note on George the approved when they found that at these entertainments great  ladies and courtesans brushed beautiful shoulders in utmost  familiarity, but those who delighted in the high charm of society  doubtless shook their heads. We need not, however, find it a  flaw in George's social bearing that he did not check this kind of  freedom. At the , as a young man full of life, of course he  took everything as it came, joyfully. No one knew better than  he did, in later life, that there is a time for laughing with great  ladies and a time for laughing with courtesans. But as yet it  was not possible for him to exert influence. How great that influence became I will indicate later on. I like to think of him as he was at this period, charging about,  in pursuit of pleasure, like a young bull. The splendid taste for  building had not yet come to him. His father would not hear of  him patronising the turf. But already he was implected with a  passion for dress, and seems to have erred somewhat on the side  of dressing up, as is the way of young men. It is fearful to think  of him, as Cyrus Redding saw him, "arrayed in deep-brown  velvet, silver embroidered, with cut-steel buttons, and a gold net  thrown over all." Before that "gold net thrown over all," all the  mistakes of his after-life seem to me to grow almost insignificant.  Time, however, toned his too florid sense of costume, and we  should at any rate be thankful that his imagination never deserted  him. All the delightful munditis? that we find in the contem-  porary "fashion-plates for gentlemen" can be traced to George  himself. His were the much-approved "quadruple stock of great  dimension," the "cocked grey-beaver," the pantaloons of mauve  silk "negligently crinkled" and any number of other little pomps  and foibles of the kind. As he grew older and was obliged to abandon many of his more vigorous pastimes, he grew more and  more enamoured of the pleasures of the wardrobe. He would spend By Max Beerbohm  255 spend hours, it is said, in designing coats for his friends and  liveries for his servants, and even uniforms. Nor did he ever  make the mistake of giving away outmoded clothes to his valets,  but kept them to form what must have been the finest collection  of clothes that has been seen in modern times. With a sentiment-  ality that is characteristic of him he would often, as he sat,  crippled by gout, in his room at Windsor, direct his servant to  bring him this or that coat, which he had worn ten or twenty or  thirty years before, and, when it was brought to him, spend much  time in laughing or sobbing over the memories that lay in its  folds. It is pleasant to know that George, during his long and various life, never forgot a coat, however long ago worn, however seldom. But in the early days of which I speak he had not yet touched  that self-conscious note which, in manner and mode of life, as well  as in costume, he was to touch later. He was too violently  enamoured of all around him to think very deeply of himself.  But he had already realised the tragedy of the voluptuary, which  is, after a little time, not that he must go on living, but that he  cannot live in two places at once. We have, at this end of the  century, tempered this tragedy by the perfection of railways,  and it is possible for that splendid exemplar of the delectable life,  our good Prince, whom Heaven bless, to waken to the sound of the  Braemar bagpipes, while the music of Mdlle. Guilbert's latest song,  cooed over the footlights of the Concerts Parisiens, still rings in his  ears. But in the time of our Prince's illustrious great-uncle there  were not railways ; and we find George perpetually driving, for  wagers, to Brighton and back (he had already acquired that taste  for Brighton which was one of his most loveable qualities) in  incredibly short periods of time. The rustics who lived along the  road were well accustomed to the sight of a high, tremulous phaeton, 256  A Note on George the phaeton, flashing past them, and the crimson face of the young  prince bending over the horses. There is something absurd in  representing George as, even before he came of age, a hardened  and cynical profligate, an Elagabalus in trousers. His blood  flowed fast enough through his veins. All his escapades were those  of a healthful young man of the time. Need we blame him if  he sought, every day, to live faster and more fully ? In a brief essay like this, I cannot attempt to write, as I hope  one day to do, in any detail a history of George's career, during  the time when he was successively Prince of Wales and Regent  and King. Merely is it my wish at present to examine some of the  principal accusations that have been brought against him, and  to point out in what ways he has been harshly and hastily judged.  Perhaps the greatest indignation against him was, and is to this  day, felt by reason of his treatment of his two wives, Mrs.  Fitzherbert and Queen Caroline. There are some scandals that  never grow old, and I think the story of George's married life is  one of them. I can feel it. It has vitality. Often have I wondered whether the blood with which the young Prince's shirt  was covered when Mrs. Fitzherbert  was induced to visit  him at Carlton House, was merely red paint, or if, in a frenzy  of love, he had truly gashed himself with a razor. Certain  it is that his passion for the virtuous and obdurate lady was  a very real one. Lord Holland describes how the Prince used  to visit Mrs. Fox, and there indulge in "the most extravagant  expressions and actions—rolling on the floor, striking his fore-  head, tearing his hair, falling into hysterics, and swearing that  he would abandon the country, forego the crown, &amp;c." He was indeed still a child, for royalties, not being ever brought  inco contact with the realities of life, remain young longer than  most people. He had a truly royal lack of self-control, and was By Max Beerbohm  257 was unable to bear the idea of being thwarted in any wish. Every  day he sent off couriers to Holland, whither Mrs. Fitzherbert  had retreated, imploring her to return to him, offering her formal  marriage. At length, as we know, she yielded to his importunity  and returned. It is difficult indeed to realise exactly what was  Mrs. Fitzherbert's feeling in the matter. The marriage must be,  as she knew, illegal, and would lead, as Charles James Fox pointed  out in his powerful letter to the Prince, to endless and intricate  difficulties. For the present she could only live with him as his  mistress. If, when he reached the legal age of twenty-five, he  were to apply to Parliament for permission to marry her, how  could permission be given, when she had been living with him  irregularly ? Doubtless, she was flattered by the attentions of the  Heir to the Throne, but, had she really returned his passion, she  would surely have preferred "any other species of connection with His Royal Highness to one leading to so much misery and  mischief." Really to understand her marriage, one must look at  the portraits of her that are extant. That beautiful and silly face  explains much. One can well fancy such a lady being pleased to  live after the performance of a mock-ceremony with a prince for  whom she felt no passion. Her view of the matter can only  have been social, for, in the eyes of the Church, she could  only live with the Prince as his mistress. Society, however, once  satisfied that a ceremony of some kind had been enacted, never  regarded her as anything but his wife. The day after Fox, inspired by the Prince, had formally denied that any ceremony  had taken place, "the knocker of her door," to quote her own  complacent phrase, "was never still." The Duchesses of  Portland, Devonshire, and Cumberland were among her visitors. Now, much pop-limbo has been talked about the Prince's  denial of the marriage. I grant that it was highly improper to 258  A Note on George the to marry Mrs. Fitzherbert at all. But George was always weak  and wayward, and he did, in his great passion, marry her. That  he should afterwards deny it officially seems to me to have been  utterly inevitable. His denial did her not the faintest damage, as  I have pointed out. It was, so to speak, an official quibble,  rendered necessary by the circumstances of the case. Not to  have denied the marriage in the House of Commons would have  meant ruin to both of them. As months passed, more serious  difficulties awaited the unhappily wedded pair. The story of the  Prince's great debts and desperation need not be repeated. It was  clear that there was but one way of getting his head above water,  and that was to yield to his father's wishes and contract a real  marriage with a foreign princess. Fate was dogging his footsteps  relentlessly. Placed as he was, George could not but offer to  marry, as his father willed. It is well, also, to remember that George was not ruthlessly and suddenly turning his shoulder upon  Mrs. Fitzherbert. For some time before the British pleni-  potentiary went to fetch him a bride from over the waters, his  name had been associated with that of the beautiful and un-  scrupulous Countess of Jersey. Poor George ! Half-married to a woman whom he no longer  worshipped, compelled to marry a woman whom he was to hate at   sight ! Surely we should not judge a prince harshly.  "Princess Caroline very  gauche  at cards," "Princess Caroline  very missish  at supper," are among the entries made in his diary  by Lord Malmesbury while he was at the little German Court.  I can conceive no scene more tragic than that of her presentation  to the Prince, as related by the same nobleman. "I, accordingly  to the established etiquette," so he writers, "introduced the  Princess Caroline to him. She, very properly, in consequence of  my saying it was the right mode of proceeding, attempted to kneel By Max Beerbohm  259 kneel to him. He raised her gracefully enough, and embraced  her, said barely one word, turned round, retired to a distant part of  the apartment, and, calling to me, said: 'Harris, I am not well :  pray get me a glass of brandy.'" At dinner that evening, in the  presence of her betrothed, the Princess was "flippant, rattling,  affecting wit." Poor George, I say again ! Deportment was  his ruling passion, and his bride did not know how to behave.  Vulgarity—hard, implacable, German vulgarity—was in every-  thing she did to the very day of her death. The marriage was  solemnised on Wednesday, April 8th, 1795, and the royal bride-  groom was drunk. So soon as they were seperated, George became implected with  a morbid hatred for his wife, that was hardly in accord with his  light and variant nature, and shows how bitterly he had been  mortified by his marriage of necessity. It is sad that so much of  his life should have been wasted in futile strainings after divorce.  Yet we can scrcely blame him for seizing upon every scrap of  scandal that was whispered of his wife. Besides his not unnatural  wish to be free, it was derogatory to the dignity of a Prince and a  Regent that his wife should be living an eccentric life at Black-  heath with a family of singers named Sapio. Indeed, Caroline's  conduct during this time was as indiscreet as ever. Wherever  she went she made ribald jokes about her husband, "in such a  voice that all, by-standing, might hear." "After dinner," writes one of her servants, "Her Royal Highness made a wax figure as  usual, and gave it an amiable pair of large horns ; then took three  pins out of her garment and stuck them through and through, and  put the figure to roast and melt at the fire. What a silly piece of  spite! Yet it is impossible not to laugh when one sees it done."  Imagine the feelings of the  Gentleman in Europe when  such pranks were whispered to him! For 260  A Note on George the For my own part, I fancy Caroline was innocent of any in-  fidelity to her unhappy husband. But that is neither here nor  there. Her behaviour was certainly not above suspicion. It  fully justified him in trying to establish a case for her divorce.  When, at length, she went abroad, her vagaries were such that  the whole of her English suite left her, and we hear of her  travelling about the Holy Land attended by another family,  named Bergami. When her husband succeeded to the throne, and her name was struck out of the liturgy, she despatched expostulations in absurd English to Lord Liverpool. Receiving  no answer, she decided to return and claim her right to be  crowned Queen of England. Whatever the unhappy lady did,  she always was ridiculous. One cannot but smile as one reads of  her posting along the French roads in a yellow travelling-chariot  drawn by cart-horses, with a retinue that included an alderman, a  reclaimed lady-in-waiting, an Italian Count, the eldest son of the  alderman, and "a fine little female child, about three years old,  whom her Majesty, in conformity with her benevolent practices  on former occasions, had adopted." The breakdown of her  impeachment, and her acceptance of an income, formed a fitting  anti-climax to the terrible absurdities of her position. She died  from the effects of a chill caught when she was trying vainly to force a way to her husband's coronation. Unhappy woman !  Our sympathy for her is not misplaced. Fate wrote her a most  tremendous tragedy, and she played it in tights. Let us pity  her, but not forget to pity her husband, the King, also. It is  another common accusation against George that he was an  undutiful and unfeeling son. If this was so, it is certain that not  all the blame is to be laid upon him alone. There is more than  one anecdote which shows that King George disliked his eldest  son, and took no trouble to conceal his dislike, long before the boy By Max Beerbohm  261 boy had been freed from his tutors. It was the coldness of his  father and the petty restrictions he loved to enforce that   drove George to seek the companionship of such men as the  Duke of Cumberland and the Duc d'Orleans, each of whom were  quick to inflame his impressionable mind to angry resentment.  Yet when Margaret Nicholson attempted the life of the King, the  Prince immediately posted off from Brighton that he might wait  upon his father at Windsor—a graceful act of piety that was  rewarded by his father's refusal to see him. Hated by the Queen,  who at this time did all she could to keep her husband and his son  apart, surrounded by intriguers, who did all they could to set him  against his father, George seems to have behaved with great discretion. In the years that follow, I can conceive no position  more difficult than that in which he found himself every time his  father relapsed into lunacy. That he should have by every means  opposed those who through jealousy stood between him and the  regency was only natural. It cannot be said that at any time did  he show anxiety to rule, so long as there was any immediate  chance of the King's recovery. On the contrary, all impartial  seers of that chaotic Court agreed that the Prince bore himself  throughout the intrigues, wherein he himself was bound to be, in  a notably filial way. There are many things that I regret in the career of George IV.,  and what I most of all regret is the part that he played in  the politics of the period. Englishmen to-day have at length  decided that royalty shall not set foot in the political arena. I do  not despair that some day we shall place politics upon a sound  commercial basis, as they have already done in America and  France, or leave them entirely in the hands of the police, as they  do in Russia. It is horrible to think that under our existing régime  all the men of noblest blood and highest intellect should waste 262  A Note on George the waste their time in the sordid atmosphere of the House of  Commons, listening for hours to nonentities talking nonsense, or  searching enormous volumes to prove that somebody said some-  thing some years ago that does not quite tally with something he  said the other day, or standing tremulous before the whips in the  lobbies and the scorpions in the constituencies. In the political  machine are crushed and lost all our best men. That Mr. Glad-  stone did not choose to be a cardinal is a blow under which the  Roman Catholic Church still staggers. In Mr. Chamberlain  Scotland Yard missed its smartest detective. What a fine volup-  tuary might Lord Rosebery have been ! It is a platitude that  the country is ruled best by the permanent officials, and I look  forward to the time when Mr. Keir Hardie shall hang his cap in the hall of No. 10 Downing Street, and a Conservative  working man shall lead her Majesty's Opposition. In the life-  time of George, politics were not a whit finer than they are  to-day. I feel a genuine indignation that he should have  wasted so much of tissue in mean intrigues about ministries and  bills. That he should have been fascinated by that splendid  fellow, Fox, is quite right. That he should have thrown himself  with all his heart into the storm of the Westminster election is  most natural. But it is inverideed sad to find him, long after  he had reached man's estate, indulging in back-stair intrigues with  Whigs and Tories. It is, of course, absurd to charge him with  deserting his  friends, the Whigs. His love and fidelity were  given, not to the Whigs, but to the men who led them. Even after the death of Fox, he did, in misplaced piety, do all he could  for Fox's party. What wonder that, when he found he was  ignored by the Ministry that owed its existence to him, he turned  his back upon that sombre couple, the "Lords G. and G.," whom  he had always hated, and went over to the Tories ? Among the Tories By Max Beerbohm  263 Tories he hoped to find men who would faithfully perform their  duties and leave him leisure to live his own beautiful life. I  regret immensely that his part in politics did not cease here.  The state of the country and of his own finances, and also, I  fear, a certain love that he had imbibed for political manipula- tion, prevented him from standing aside. How useless was all the  finesse he displayed in the long-drawn question of Catholic  Emancipation ! How lamentable his terror of Lord Wellesley's  rude dragooning ! And is there not something pitiable in the  thought of the Regent at a time of ministerial complications  lying prone on his bed with a sprained ankle, and taking, as was  whispered, in one day as many as seven hundred drops of lauda-  num ? Some said he took these doses to deaden the pain. But others, and among them his brother Cumberland, declared that  the sprain was all a sham. I hope it was. The thought of a  voluptuary in pain is very terrible. In any case, I cannot but  feel angry, for George's own sake and that of his kingdom,  that he found it impossible to keep further aloof from the  wearisome troubles of political life. His wretched indecision  of character made him an easy prey to unscrupulous ministers,  while his extraordinary diplomatic powers and almost extrava-  gant tact made them, in their turn, an easy prey to him. In  these two processes much of his genius was uselessly spent. I must confess that he did not quite realise where his duties ended.  He wished always to do too much. If you read his repeated  appeals to his father that he might be permitted to serve actively  in the British army against the French, you will acknowledge  that it was through no fault of his own that he did not fight. It  touches me to think that in his declining years he actually thought  that he had led one of the charges at Waterloo. He would often  describe the whole scene as it appeared to him at that supreme moment, 264  A Note on George the moment, and refer to the Duke of Wellington, saying, "Was it  not so, Duke ?" "I have often heard you say so, your Majesty,"  the old soldier would reply, grimly. I am not sure that the old  soldier was at Waterloo himself. In a room full of people he  once referred to the battle as having been won upon the playing-  fields of Eton. This was certainly a most unfortunate slip,  seeing that all historians are agreed that it was fought on a  certain field situate a few miles from Brussels. In one of his letters to the King, craving for a military appoint-  ment, George urges that, whilst his next brother, the Duke of  York, commanded the army, and the younger branches of the  family were either generals or lieutenant-generals, he, who was  Prince of Wales, remained colonel of dragoons. And herein,  could he have known it, lay the right limiting of his life. As  royalty was and is constituted, it is for the younger sons to take  an active part in the services, whilst the eldest son is left as the  ruler of Society. Thousands and thousands of guineas were given  by the nation that the Prince of Wales, the Regent, the King,  might be, in the best sense of the word, ornamental. It is not for  us, at this moment, to consider whether Royalty, as a wholly Pagan  institution, is not out of place in a community of Christians. It  is enough that we should inquire whether the god whom our grandfathers set up and worshipped and crowned with offerings,  gave grace to his worshippers. That George was a moral man, in our modern sense, I do not for  one moment pretend. When he died there were found in one of  his cabinets more than a hundred locks of women's hair. Some of  these were still plastered with powder and pomatum, others were  mere little golden curls, such as grow low down upon a girl's neck,  others were streaked with grey. The whole of this collection  subsequently passed into the hands of Adam, the famous Scotch henchman By Max Beerbohm  265 henchman of the Regent, and in his family, now resident in  Glasgow, it is treasured as an heirloom. I myself have been  privileged to look at all these locks of hair, and I have seen a clairvoyante  take them one by one, and, pinching them between  her lithe fingers, tell of the love that each symbolised. I have  heard her tell of long rides by night, of a boudoir hung with  grass-green satin, and of a tryst at Windsor ; of one, the wife of a  hussar at York, whose little lap-dog used to bark angrily whenever  the Regent came near his mistress ; of a milk-maid who, in her  great simpleness, thought that her child would one day be king of  England ; of an arch-duchess with blue eyes, and a silly little flautist from Portugal ; of women that were wantons and fought  for his favour, great ladies that he loved dearly, girls that gave  themselves to him humbly. If we lay all pleasures at the feet of  our prince, we can scarcely hope he will remain virtuous. Indeed,  we do not wish our prince to be an exemplar of godliness, but a  perfect type of happiness. It may be foolish of us to insist upon  apolaustic happiness, but that is the kind of happiness that we can  ourselves, most of us, best understand, and so we offer it to our  ideal. In Royalty we find our Bacchus, our Venus. Certainly George was, in the practical sense of the word, a fine  king. His wonderful physique, his wealth, his brilliant talents, he  gave them all without stint to Society. His development from the  time when, at Madame Cornely's, he gallivanted with rips and  demireps, to the time when he sat, a stout and solitary old king,  fishing in the artificial pond at Windsor, was beautifully ordered.  During his life he indulged himself to the full in all the delights  that life could offer him. That he should have, in his old age,  suddenly abandoned his career of vigorous enjoyment is, I confess,  rather surprising. The royal voluptuary generally remains young  to the last. No one ever tires of pleasure. It is the pursuit of pleasure, 266  A Note on George the pleasure, the trouble to grasp it, that makes us old. Only the  soldiers who enter Capua with wounded feet leave it demoralised.  And yet George, who never had to wait or fight for a pleasure,  most certainly broke up long before his death. I can but attribute  this to the constant persecution to which he was subjected by  duns and ministers, parents and wives. Not that I regret the manner in which he spent his last years.  On the contrary, I think it was exceedingly cosy. I like to think  of the King, at Windsor, lying a-bed all the morning in his dark-  ened room, with all the newspapers scattered over his quilt, and a  little decanter of the favourite cherry-brandy within easy reach.  I like to think of him sitting by his fire in the afternoon and  hearing his ministers asking for him at the door and piling  another log upon the fire, as he hears them sent away by his ser-  vant. After all, he had lived his life ; he had lived more fully than  any other man. And it is right that we should remember him  as a  voluptuary. Only let us note that his nature never became, as do  the natures of most voluptuaries, corroded by a cruel indifference  to the happiness of others. When all the town was agog for the fête  to be given by the Regent in honour of the French King,  Sheridan sent a forged card of invitation to Romeo Coates, the  half-witted dandy, who used at this time to walk about in absurd  ribbons and buckles, and was the butt of all the streetsters. When  the poor fellow arrived at the entrance of Carlton House, proud as  a peacock, he was greeted with a tremendous cheer from the by- standing mob, but when he came to the lacqueys he was told that  his card was a hoax, and was sent about his business. The tears  were rolling down his cheeks as he shambled back into the street.  The Regent heard later in the evening of this sorry joke, and next  day despatched a kindly-worded message, in which he prayed that Mr. Coates By Max Beerbohm  267 Mr. Coates would not refuse to come and "view the decorations, nevertheless." Though he does not appear to have treated his  inferiors with that extreme servility that is now in vogue, George  was beloved by the whole of his household, and many are the little  tales that are told to illustrate the kindliness and consideration  he showed to his valets and his jockeys and his stable-boys. That  from time to time he dropped certain of his favourites is no cause  for blaming him. Remember that a Great Personage, like a great  genius, is dangerous to his fellow-creatures. The favourites of  Royalty live in an intoxicant atmosphere. They become  unaccountable for their behaviour. Either they get beyond them-  selves, and, like Brummel, forget that the King, their friend,  is also their master ; or they outrun the constable, and go bankrupt,  or cheat at cards in order to keep up their position, or do some  other foolish thing that makes it impossible for the King to favour them more. Remember, too, that old friends are generally  the refuge of unsociable persons, and how great must be the  temptation besetting the head of Society to form fresh friendships,  when all the cleverest and most charming persons in the land are  standing ready, like supers at the wings, to come on and please  him. At Carlton House there was a constant succession of wits.  Minds were preserved for the Prince of Wales, as coverts are  preserved for him to-day. For him Sheridan would say his best  bon-mot, and Theodore Hook contrive his most practical jokes,  his swiftest chansonette. And Fox would talk, as only he could,  of Liberty and of Patriotism, and Byron would look more than  ever like Isidore de Lara as he recited his own bad verses, and Sir  Walter Scott would "pour out with an endless generosity his store of old-world learning, kindness, and humour." Of such men  George was a splendid patron. He did not merely sit in his chair,  gaping princely at their wit and their wisdom, but quoted with the scholars 268  A Note on George the scholars, and argued with the statesmen, and jested with the wits. Doctor Burney, an impartial observer, says that he was amazed by  the knowledge of music that the Regent displayed in a half-  hour's discussion over the wine. Croker says that "the Prince  and Scott were the two most brilliant story-tellers, in their  several ways, he had ever happened to meet. Both exerted them-  selves, and it was hard to say which shone the most." The  Prince seems indeed to have been a fine conversationalist, with a  wide range of knowledge and great humour. We, who have  come at length to look upon stupidity as one of the most sacred  prerogatives of Royalty, can scarcely realise that, if George's  birth had been never so humble, he would have been known to us  as a fine scholar and wit or as a connoisseur of the arts. It is  pleasing to think of his love for the Flemish school of painting,  for Wilkie and Sir Thomas Lawrence. The splendid portraits of  foreign potentates that hang in the Banqueting Room at Windsor bear witness to his sense of the canvas. In his later years he  exerted himself strenuously in raising the tone of the drama.  His love of the classics never left him. We know he was fond of  quoting those incomparable poets, Homer, at great length, and  that he was prominent in the "papyrus-craze." Indeed, he  inspired Society with a love of something more than mere  pleasure, a love of the "humaner delights." He was a giver of  tone. The bluff, disgusting ways of the Tom and Jerry period  gave way to those florid graces that are still called Georgian. A pity that George's predecessor was not a man, like the Prince  Consort, of strong chastening influence ! Then might the bright  flamboyance which George gave to Society have made his reign  more beautiful than any other—a real renaissance. But he found  London a wild city of taverns and cock-pits, and the grace which  in the course of years he gave to his subjects never really entered into By Max Beerbohm  269 into them. The cock-pits were gilded and the taverns painted  with colour, but the heart of the city was vulgar, even as before.  The simulation of higher things did indeed give the note of a  very interesting period, but how shallow that simulation was, and  how merely it was due to George's own influence, we may see in  the light of what happened after his death. The good that he  had done died with him. The refinement he had laid upon vul-  garity fell away, like enamel from withered cheeks. It was only  George himself who had made the sham endure. The Victorian  Era came soon, and the angels rushed in and drove the nymphs  away and hung the land with reps. I have often wondered whether it was with a feeling that his  influence would be no more than life-long, that George allowed  Carlton House, that dear structure, the very work of his life and  symbol of his being, to be rased. I wish that Carlton House were  still standing. I wish we could still walk through those corridors,  whose walls were "crusted with ormolu," and parquet-floors were  "so glossy that, were Narcissus to come down from heaven, he  would, I maintain, need no other mirror for his  beauté ." I wish  that we could see the pier-glasses and the girandoles and the  twisted sofas, the fauns foisted upon the ceiling and the rident  goddesses along the wall. These things would make George's  memory dearer to us, help us to a fuller knowledge of him. I am  glad that the Pavilion still stands here in Brighton. Its trite  lawns and cheeky minarets have taught me much. As I write  this essay, I can see them from my window. Last night I sat there in a crowd of vulgar people, whilst a band played us tunes.  Once I fancied I saw the shade of a swaying figure and of a wine-  red face. The Yellow Book—Vol. III.  Q Study of a Head By an Unknown Artist A Ballad of a Nun By John Davidson FROM Eastertide to Eastertide For ten long years her patient knees Engraved the stones—the fittest bride Of Christ in all the diocese. She conquered every earthly lust ; The abbess loved her more and more ; And, as a mark of perfect trust, Made her the keeper of the door. High on a hill the convent hung Across a duchy looking down, Where everlasting mountains flung Their shadows over tower and town. The jewels of their lofty snows In constellations flashed at night ; Above their crests the moon arose ; The deep earth shuddered with delight. Long 274  A Ballad of a Nun Long ere she left her cloudy bed, Still dreaming in the orient land, On many a mountain's happy head Dawn lightly laid her rosy hand. The adventurous sun took Heaven by storm ; Clouds scattered largesses of rain ; The sounding cities rich and warm, Smouldered and glittered in the plain. Sometimes it was a wandering wind, Sometimes the fragrance of the pine, Sometimes the thought how others sinned, That turned her sweet blood into wine. Sometimes she heard a serenade Complaining sweetly far away : She said, "A young man woos a maid" ; And dreamt of love till break of day. Then would she ply her knotted scourge Until she swooned ; but evermore She had the same red sin to purge, Poor, passionate keeper of the door ! For still night's starry scroll unfurled, And still the day came like a flood : It was the greatness of the world That made her long to use her blood. In By John Davidson  275 In winter-time when Lent drew nigh, And hill and plain were wrapped in snow, She watched beneath the frosty sky The nearest city nightly glow. Like peals of airy bells outworn Faint laughter died above her head In gusts of broken music borne : "They keep the Carnival," she said. Her hungry heart devoured the town : "Heaven save me by a miracle ! Unless God sends an angel down, Thither I go though it were Hell." She dug her nails deep in her breast, Sobbed, shrieked, and straight withdrew the bar : A fledgling flying from the nest, A pale moth rushing to a star. Fillet and veil in strips she tore ; Her golden tresses floated wide ; The ring and bracelet that she wore As Christ's betrothed, she cast aside. "Life's dearest meaning I shall probe ; Lo ! I shall taste of love at last ! Away !" She doffed her outer robe, And sent it sailing down the blast. Her 276  A Ballad of a Nun Her body seemed to warm the wind ; With bleeding feet o'er ice she ran : "I leave the righteous God behind ; I go to worship sinful man." She reached the sounding city's gate ; No question did the warder ask : He passed her in : "Welcome, wild mate !" He thought her some fantastic mask. Half-naked through the town she went ; Each footstep left a bloody mark ; Crowds followed her with looks intent ; Her bright eyes made the torches dark. Alone and watching in the street There stood a grave youth nobly dressed ; To him she knelt and kissed his feet ; Her face her great desire confessed. Straight to his house the nun he led : "Strange lady, what would you with me ?" "Your love, your love, sweet lord," she said ; "I bring you my virginity." He healed her bosom with a kiss ; She gave him all her passion's hoard ; And sobbed and murmured ever, "This Is life's great meaning, dear, my lord. "I care By John Davidson  277 "I care not for my broken vow, Though God should come in thunder soon ; I am sister to the mountains now, And sister to the sun and moon." Through all the towns of Belmarie, She made a progress like a queen. "She is," they said, "whate'er she be, The strangest woman ever seen. "From fairyland she must have come, Or else she is a mermaiden." Some said she was a ghoul, and some A heathen goddess born again. But soon her fire to ashes burned ; Her beauty changed to haggardness ; Her golden hair to silver turned ; The hour came of her last caress. At midnight from her lonely bed She rose, and said : "I have had my will." The old ragged robe she donned, and fled Back to the convent on the hill. Half-naked as she went before, She hurried to the city wall, Unnoticed in the rush and roar And splendour of the Carnival. "No 278  A Ballad of a Nun No question did the warder ask : Her ragged robe, her shrunken limb, Her dreadful eyes ! "It is no mask ; It is a she-wolf, gaunt and grim !" She ran across the icy plain ; Her worn blood curdled in the blast ; Each footstep left a crimson stain ; The white-faced moon looked on aghast. She said between her chattering jaws, "Deep peace is mine, I cease to strive ; Oh, comfortable convent laws, That bury foolish nuns alive ! "A trowel for my passing-bell, A little bed within the wall, A coverlet of stones ; how well I there shall keep the Carnival !" Like tired bells chiming in their sleep, The wind faint peals of laughter bore ; She stopped her ears and climbed the steep, And thundered at the convent door. It opened straight : she entered in, And at the wardress' feet fell prone : "I come to purge away my sin, Bury me, close me up in stone." The By John Davidson  279 The wardress raised her tenderly ; She touched her wet and fast-shut eyes ; "Look, sister ; sister, look at me ; Look ; can you see through my disguise ?" She looked and saw her own sad face, And trembled, wondering, "Who art thou ?" "God sent me down to fill your place : I am the Virgin Mary now." And with the word, God's mother shone ; The wanderer whispered, "Mary, hail !" The vision helped her to put on Bracelet and fillet, ring and veil. "You are sister to the mountains now, And sister to the day and night ; Sister to God ;" and on the brow She kissed her thrice, and left her sight. While dreaming in her cloudy bed, Far in the crimson orient land, On many a mountain's happy head Dawn lightly laid her rosy hand. The Yellow Book Index to Publisher's Announcements Page  W.
