BALLANTYNE PRESS  LONDON &amp; EDINBURGH Study of a Head By H. J. Draper Home... By   Richard Le Gallienne " WE'RE going home ! " I heard two lovers say, They kissed their friends and bade them bright good-byes ; I hid the deadly hunger in my eyes, And, lest I might have killed them, turned away. Ah, love, we too once gambolled home as they, Home from the town with such fair merchandise,-- Wine and great grapes--the happy lover buys : A little cosy feast to crown the day. Yes ! we had once a heaven we called a home, Its empty rooms still haunt me like thine eyes When the last sunset softly faded there ; Each day I tread each empty haunted room, And now and then a little baby cries, Or laughs a lovely laughter worse to bear. The Bohemian Girl By   Henry Harland I I WOKE up very gradually this morning, and it took me a little  while to bethink myself where I had slept--that it had not  been in my own room in the Cromwell Road. I lay a-bed, with  eyes half-closed, drowsily looking forward to the usual procession  of sober-hued London hours, and, for the moment, quite forgot  the journey of yesterday, and how it had left me in Paris, a guest  in the smart new house of my old friend, Nina Childe. Indeed,  it was not until somebody tapped on my door, and I roused myself to call out, " Come in," that I noticed the strangeness of  the wall-paper, and then, after an instant of perplexity, suddenly  remembered. Oh, with a wonderful lightening of the spirit, I can  tell you. A white-capped, brisk young woman, with a fresh-coloured,  wholesome peasant face, came in, bearing a tray--Jeanne, Nina's  femme-de-chambre " Bonjour, monsieur," she cried cheerily. " I bring monsieur  his coffee." And her announcement was followed by a fragrance  --the softly-sung response of the coffee-sprite. Her tray, with its  pretty freight of silver and linen, primrose butter, and gently- browned By Henry Harland  13 browned pain-de-gruau, she set down on the table at my elbow ;  then she crossed the room and drew back the window-curtains,  making the rings tinkle crisply on the metal rods, and letting in a  gush of dazzling sunshine. From where I lay I could see the  house-fronts opposite glow pearly-grey in shadow, and the crest of  the slate roofs sharply print itself on the sky, like a black line on  a sheet of scintillant blue velvet. Yet, a few minutes ago, I had  been fancying myself in the Cromwell Road. Jeanne, gathering up my scattered garments, to take them off  and brush them, inquired, by the way, if monsieur had passed a  comfortable night. " As the chambermaid makes your bed, so must you lie in it,"  I answered. " And you know whether my bed was smoothly made." Jeanne smiled indulgently. But her next remark--did it imply  that she found me rusty ? " Here's a long time that you haven't  been in Paris." " Yes," I admitted ; " not since May, and now we're in  November." " We have changed things a little, have we not? " she de-  manded, with a gesture that left the room, and included the house,  the street, the quarter. " In effect," assented I. " Monsieur desires his hot water? " she asked, abruptly irre-  levant. But I could be, or at least seem, abruptly irrelevant too.  " Mademoiselle--is she up ? " " Ah, yes, monsieur. Mademoiselle has been up since eight.  She awaits you in the salon. La voilà qui joue," she added, point-  ing to the floor. Nina had begun to play scales in the room below. " Then you may bring me my hot water," I said. The 14  The Bohemian Girl II The scales continued while I was dressing, and many desultory  reminiscences of the player, and vague reflections upon the unlike-  lihood of her adventures, went flitting through my mind to their  rhythm. Here she was, scarcely turned thirty, beautiful, brilliant,  rich in her own right, as free in all respects to follow her own will  as any man could be, with Camille happily at her side, a well-  grown, rosy, merry miss of twelve,--here was Nina, thus, to-day ;  and yet, a mere little ten years ago, I remembered her .... ah,  in a very different plight indeed. True, she has got no more than  her deserts ; she has paid for her success, every pennyweight of it,  in hard work and self-denial. But one is so expectant, here below,  to see Fortune capricious, that, when for once in a way she  bestows her favours where they are merited, one can't help feeling  rather dazed. One is so inured to seeing honest Effort turn empty-handed from her door. Ten little years ago--but no. I must begin further back. I  must tell you something about Nina's father. III He was an Englishman who lived for the greater part of his life  in Paris. I would say he was a painter, if he had not been equally  a sculptor, a musician, an architect, a writer of verse, and a  university coach. A doer of so many things is inevitably suspect ;  you will imagine that he must have bungled them all. On the contrary, By Henry Harland  15 contrary, whatever he did, he did with a considerable degree of accomplishment. The landscapes he painted were very fresh and  pleasing, delicately coloured, with lots of air in them, and a  dreamy, suggestive sentiment. His brother sculptors declared  that his statuettes were modelled with exceeding dash and direct-  ness ; they were certainly fanciful and amusing. I remember one  that I used to like immensely--Titania driving to a tryst with  Bottom, her chariot a lily, daisies for wheels, and for steeds a pair  of mettlesome field-mice. I doubt if he ever got a commission  for a complete house ; but the staircases he designed, the fire-  places, and other bits of buildings, everybody thought original and  graceful. The tunes he wrote were lively and catching, the words never stupid, sometimes even strikingly happy, epigrammatic ; and  he sang them delightfully, in a robust, hearty baritone. He  coached the youth of France, for their examinations, in Latin and  Greek, in history, mathematics, general literature--in goodness  knows what not ; and his pupils failed so rarely that, when one  did, the circumstance became a nine days' wonder. The world  beyond the Students' Quarter had never heard of him, but there  he was a celebrity and a favourite ; and, strangely enough for a  man with so many strings to his bow, he contrived to pick up a sufficient living. He was a splendid creature to look at, tall, stalwart, full-  blooded, with a ruddy open-air complexion ; a fine bold brow and  nose ; brown eyes, humorous, intelligent, kindly, that always  brightened flatteringly when they met you ; and a vast quantity  of bluish-grey hair and beard. In his dress he affected (very  wisely, for they became him excellently) velvet jackets, flannel  shirts, loosely-knotted ties, and wide-brimmed soft felt hats.  Marching down the Boulevard St. Michel, his broad shoulders  well thrown back, his head erect, chin high in air, his whole person 16  The Bohemian Girl person radiating health, power, contentment, and the pride of  them : he was a sight worth seeing, spirited, picturesque, pre-  possessing. You could not have passed him without noticing  him--without wondering who he was, confident he was somebody  --without admiring him, and feeling that there went a man it  would be interesting to know. He was, indeed, charming to know ; he was the hero, the idol,  of a little sect of worshippers, young fellows who loved nothing  better than to sit at his feet. On the Rive Gauche, to be sure,  we are, for the most part, birds of passage ; a student arrives,  tarries a little, then departs. So, with the exits and entrances of  seniors and  nouveaux , the personnel of old Childe's following varied  from season to season ; but numerically it remained pretty much  the same. He had a studio, with a few living-rooms attached,  somewhere up in the fastnesses of Montparnasse, though it was  seldom thither that one went to seek him. He received at his café,  the Café Bleu--the Café Bleu which has since blown into the  monster café of the Quarter, the noisiest, the rowdiest, the most flamboyant. But I am writing (alas) of twelve, thirteen, fifteen  years ago ; in those days the Café Bleu consisted of a single  oblong room--with a sanded floor, a dozen tables, and two  waiters, Eugène and Hippolyte--where Madame Chanve, the patronne , in lofty insulation behind her counter, reigned, if you  please, but where Childe, her principal client, governed. The  bottom of the shop, at any rate, was reserved exclusively to his use. There he dined, wrote his letters, dispensed his hospitalities;  he had his own piano there, if you can believe me, his foils and  boxing-gloves ; from the absinthe hour till bed-time there was  his habitat, his den. And woe to the passing stranger who, mis-  taking the Café Bleu for an ordinary house of call, ventured,  during that consecrated period, to drop in. Nothing would be said, By Henry Harland  17 said, nothing done ; we would not even trouble to stare at the  intruder. Yet he would seldom stop to finish his consommation,  or he would bolt it. He would feel something in the air ; he  would know he was out of place. He would fidget a little, frown  a little, and get up meekly, and slink into the street. Human  magnetism is such a subtle force. And Madame Chanve didn't  mind in the least ; she preferred a bird in the hand to a brace in  the bush. From half a dozen to a score of us dined at her long table every evening ; as many more drank her appetisers in the  afternoon, and came again at night for grog or coffee. You see,  it was a sort of club, a club of which Childe was at once the  chairman and the object. If we had had a written constitution,  it must have begun : " The purpose of this association is the  enjoyment of the society of Alfred Childe." Ah, those afternoons, those dinners, those ambrosial nights !  If the weather was kind, of course, we would begin our session on  the  terrasse , sipping our vermouth, puffing our cigarettes, laugh- ing our laughs, tossing hither and thither our light ball of gossip, vaguely conscious of the perpetual ebb and flow and murmur of  people in the Boulevard, while the setting sun turned Paris to a  marvellous water-colour, all pale lucent tints, amber and alabaster  and mother-of-pearl, with amethystine shadows. Then, one by  one, those of us who were dining elsewhere would slip away ;  and at a sign from Hippolyte the others would move indoors,  and take their places down either side of the long narrow table,  Childe at the head, his daughter Nina next him. And presently with what a clatter of knives and forks, clinking of glasses, and  babble of human voices, the Café Bleu would echo. Madame  Chanve's kitchen was not a thing to boast of, and her price, for  the Latin Quarter, was rather high--I think we paid three francs,  wine included, which would be for most of us distinctly a  prix - de-luxe. 18  The Bohemian Girl de-luxe . But oh, it was such fun ; we were so young ; Childe  was so delightful. The fun was best, of course, when we were few, and could all sit up near to him, and none need lose a word.  When we were many there would be something like a scramble  for good seats. I ask myself whether, if I could hear him again to-day, I  should think his talk as wondrous as I thought it then. Then I  could thrill at the verse of Musset, and linger lovingly over the  prose of Théophile, I could laugh at the wit of Gustave Droz,  and weep at the pathos .... it costs me a pang to own it, but  yes, I m afraid .... I could weep at the pathos of Henry Mürger ; and these have all suffered such a sad sea-change since.  So I could sit, hour after hour, in a sort of ecstasy, listening to  the talk of Nina's father. It flowed from him like wine from a  full measure, easily, smoothly, abundantly. He had a ripe,  genial voice, and an enunciation that made crystals of his words ;  whilst his range of subjects was as wide as the earth and the sky.  He would talk to you of God and man, of metaphysics, ethics, the  last new play, murder, or change of ministry ; of books, of  pictures, specifically, or of the general principles of literature and  painting ; of people, of sunsets, of Italy, of the high seas, of the  Paris streets--of what, in fine, you pleased. Or he would spin  you yarns, sober, farcical, veridical, or invented. And, with transitions infinitely rapid, he would be serious, jocose--solemn, ribald--earnest, flippant--logical, whimsical, turn and turn about.  And in every sentence, in its form or in its substance, he would  wrap a surprise for you--it was the unexpected word, the un-  expected assertion, sentiment, conclusion, that constantly arrived.  Meanwhile it would enhance your enjoyment mightily to watch his physiognomy, the movements of his great, grey, shaggy head,  the lightening and darkening of his eyes, his smile, his frown, his By Henry Harland  19 his occasional slight shrug or gesture. But the oddest thing was  this, that he could take as well as give ; he could listen--surely a  rare talent in a monologist. Indeed, I have never known a man  who could make  you  feel so interesting. After dinner he would light an immense brown meerschaum  pipe, and smoke for a quarter-hour or so in silence ; then he  would play a game or two of chess with some one ; and by and by  he would open his piano, and sing to us till midnight. IV I speak of him as old, and indeed we always called him Old  Childe among ourselves ; yet he was barely fifty. Nina, when I   made their acquaintance, must have been a girl of sixteen or  seventeen ; though--tall, with an amply rounded, mature-seeming  figure--if one had judged from her appearance, one would have  fancied her three or four years older. For that matter, she looked  then very much as she looks now ; I can perceive scarcely any  alteration. She had the same dark hair, gathered up in a big  smooth knot behind, and breaking into a tumult of little ringlets  over her forehead ; the same clear, sensitive complexion ; the  same rather large, full-lipped mouth, tip-tilted nose, soft chin, and  merry, mischievous eyes. She moved in the same way, with the  same leisurely, almost lazy grace, that could, however, on  occasions, quicken to an alert, elastic vivacity ; she had the same  voice, a trifle deeper than most women's, and of a quality never so  delicately nasal, which made it racy and characteristic ; the same  fresh, ready laughter. There was something arch, something a  little sceptical, a little quizzical, in her expression, as if, perhaps, she The Yellow Book--Vol. IV.  B 20  The Bohemian Girl she were disposed to take the world, more or less, with a grain of  salt ; at the same time there was something rich, warm-blooded,  luxurious, suggesting that she would know how to savour its  pleasantnesses with complete enjoyment. But if you felt that she  was by way of being the least bit satirical in her view of things,  you felt too that she was altogether good-natured, and even that,  at need, she could show herself spontaneously kind, generous,  devoted. And if you inferred that her temperament inclined  rather towards the sensuous than the ascetic, believe me, it did not  lessen her attractiveness. At the time of which I am writing now, the sentiment that  reigned between Nina and Old Childe's retinue of young men  was chiefly an  esprit-de-corps . Later on we all fell in love with her ; but for the present we were simply amiably fraternal. We  were united to her by a common enthusiasm ; we were fellow-  celebrants at her ancestral altar--or, rather, she was the high  priestess there, we were her acolytes. For, with her, filial piety  did in very truth partake of the nature of religion ; she really,  literally, idolised her father. One only needed to watch her for  three minutes, as she sat beside him, to understand the depth and  ardour of her emotion : how she adored him, how she admired  him and believed in him, how proud of him she was, how she rejoiced in him. " Oh, you think you know my father," I  remember her saying to us once. " Nobody knows him. No-  body is great enough to know him. If people knew him they  would fall down and kiss the ground he walks on." It is certain  she deemed him the wisest, the noblest, the handsomest, the most  gifted, of human kind. That little gleam of mockery in her eye died out instantly when she looked at him, when she spoke of him  or listened to him ; instead, there came a tender light of love and  her face grew pale with the fervour of her affection. Yet, when he By Henry Harland  21 he jested, no one laughed more promptly or more heartily than  she. In those days I was perpetually trying to write fiction ; and  Old Childe was my inveterate hero. I forget in how many  ineffectual manuscripts, under what various dread disguises, he  was afterwards reduced to ashes ; I am afraid, in one case, a  scandalous distortion of him got abroad in print. Publishers are  sometimes ill-advised ; and thus the indiscretions of our youth may  become the confusions of our age. The thing was in three  volumes, and called itself a novel ; and of course the fatuous  author had to make a bad business worse by presenting a copy to  his victim. I shall never forget the look Nina gave me when I  asked her if she had read it ; I grow hot even now as I recall it.  I had waited and waited, expecting her compliments ; and at last  I could wait no longer, and so asked her ; and she answered me  with a look ! It was weeks, I am not sure it wasn't months,  before she took me back to her good graces. But Old Childe  was magnanimous ; he sent me a little pencil-drawing of his  head, inscribed in the corner, " To Frankenstein from his  Monster." V It was a queer life for a girl to live, that happy-go-lucky life of  the Latin Quarter, lawless and unpremeditated, with a café for her  school-room, and none but men for comrades ; but Nina liked it ;  and her father had a theory in his madness. He was a Bohemian,  not in practice only, but in principle ; he preached Bohemianism  as the most rational manner of existence, maintaining that it   developed what was intrinsic and authentic in one's character,  saved one from the artificial, and brought one into immediate contact 22  The Bohemian Girl contact with the realities of the world ; and he protested he could  see no reason why a human being should be " cloistered and  contracted " because of her sex. " What would not hurt my son,  if I had one, will not hurt my daughter. It will make a man of  her--without making her the less a woman." So he took her  with him to the Café Bleu, and talked in her presence quite as  freely as he might have talked had she been absent. As, in the  greater number of his theological, political, and social convictions,  he was exceedingly unorthodox, she heard a good deal, no doubt,  that most of us would scarcely consider edifying for our daughters'  ears ; but he had his system, he knew what he was about. " The  question whether you can touch pitch and remain undefiled," he said, " depends altogether upon the spirit in which you approach  it. The realities of the world, the realities of life, the real things  of God's universe--what have we eyes for, if not to envisage  them ? Do so fearlessly, honestly, with a clean heart, and, man  or woman, you can only be the better for it." Perhaps his  system was a shade too simple, a shade too obvious, for this  complicated planet ; but he held to it in all sincerity. It was in  pursuance of the same system, I daresay, that he taught Nina to  fence, and to read Latin and Greek, as well as to play the piano,  and turn an omelette. She could ply a foil against the best  of us. And then, quite suddenly, he died. I think it was in March, or April ; anyhow, it was a premature  spring-like day, and he had left off his overcoat. That evening  he went to the Odéon, and when, after the play, he joined us for  supper at the Bleu, he said he thought he had caught a cold, and  ordered hot grog. The next day he did not turn up at all ; so  several of us, after dinner, presented ourselves at his lodgings in  Montparnasse. We found him in bed, with Nina reading to him. He By Henry Harland  23 He was feverish, and Nina had insisted that he should stop at  home. He would be all right to-morrow. He scoffed at our  suggestion that he should see a doctor ; he was one of those men  who affect to despise the medical profession. But early on the  following morning a commissionnaire brought me a note from  Nina. " My father is very much worse. Can you come at  once ? " He was delirious. Poor Nina, white, with frightened  eyes, moved about like one distracted. We sent off for Dr.  Rénoult, we had in a Sister of Charity. Everything that could  be done was done. Till the very end, none of us for a moment  doubted he would recover. It was impossible to conceive that  that strong, affirmative life could be extinguished. And even after the end had come, the end with its ugly suite of material circumstances, I don t think any of us realised what it meant. It  was as if we had been told that one of the forces of Nature had  become inoperative. And Nina, through it all, was like some  pale thing in marble, that breathed and moved : white, dazed,  helpless, with aching, incredulous eyes, suffering everything,  understanding nothing. When it came to the worst of the dreadful necessary businesses  that followed, some of us, somehow, managed to draw her from  the death-chamber into another room, and to keep her there,  while others of us got it over. It was snowing that afternoon, I  remember, a melancholy, hesitating snowstorm, with large moist  flakes, that fluttered down irresolutely, and presently disintegrated  into rain ; but we had not far to go. Then we returned to Nina,  and for many days and nights we never dared to leave her. You  will guess whether the question of her future, especially of her immediate future, weighed heavily upon our minds. In the end,  however, it appeared to have solved itself--though I can't pretend  that the solution was exactly all we could have wished. Her 24  The Bohemian Girl Her father had a half-brother (we learned this from his papers),  incumbent of rather an important living in the north of England.  We also learned that the brothers had scarcely seen each other  twice in a score of years, and had kept up only the most fitful  correspondence. Nevertheless, we wrote to the clergyman, de-  scribing the sad case of his niece ; and in reply we got a letter,  addressed to Nina herself, saying that of course she must come at  once to Yorkshire, and consider the rectory her home. I don't  need to recount the difficulties we had in explaining to her, in  persuading her. I have known few more painful moments than  that when, at the Gare du Nord, half a dozen of us established  the poor, benumbed, bewildered child in her compartment, and  sent her, with our godspeed, alone upon her long journey-- to her  strange kindred, and the strange conditions of life she would have  to encounter among them. From the Café Bleu to a Yorkshire  parsonage ! And Nina's was not by any means a neutral personality, nor her mind a blank sheet of paper. She had a will  of her own ; she had convictions, aspirations, traditions, prejudices,  which she would hold to with enthusiasm because they had been  her father's, because her father had taught them to her ; and she  had manners, habits, tastes. She would be sure to horrify the  people she was going to ; she would be sure to resent their criti-  cism, their slightest attempt at interference. Oh, my heart was  full of misgivings ; yet--she had no money, she was eighteen  years old--what else could we advise her to do ? All the same,  her face, as it looked down upon us from the window of her rail- way carriage, white, with big terrified eyes fixed in a gaze of  blank uncomprehending anguish, kept rising up to reproach me  for weeks afterwards. I had her on my conscience as if I had  personally wronged her. It By Henry Harland  25 VI It was characteristic of her that, during her absence, she hardly  wrote to us. She is of far too hasty and impetuous a nature to  take kindly to the task of letter-writing ; her moods are too incon-  stant ; her thoughts, her fancies, supersede one another too  rapidly. Anyhow, beyond the telegram we had made her promise  to send, announcing her safe arrival, the most favoured of us got  nothing more than an occasional scrappy note, if he got so much ;  while the greater number of the long epistles some of us felt in  duty bound to address to her, elicited not even the semblance of an acknowledgment. Hence, about the particulars of her experience  we were quite in the dark, though of its general features we were  informed, succinctly, in a big, dashing, uncompromising hand,  that she " hated " them. VII I am not sure whether it was late in April or early in May that  Nina left us. But one day towards the middle of October, coming  home from the restaurant where I had lunched, I found in my  letter-box in the concierge's room two half-sheets of paper, folded,  with the corners turned down, and my name superscribed in pencil.  The handwriting startled me a little--and yet, no, it was im-  possible. Then I hastened to unfold and read, and of course it  was the impossible which had happened. " Mon cher, I am sorry not to find you at home, but I'll wait at  the café at the corner till half-past twelve. It is now midi juste." That 26  The Bohemian Girl That was the . The second ran : " I have waited till a  quarter to one. Now I am going to the Bleu for luncheon. I  shall be there till three." And each was signed with the initials,  N. C. It was not yet two, so I had plenty of time. But you will  believe that I didn't loiter on that account. I dashed out of the loge --into the street--down the Boulevard St. Michel--into the  Bleu, breathlessly. At the far end Nina was seated before a marble  table, with Madame Chanve in smiles and tears beside her. I heard a  little cry ; I felt myself seized and enveloped for a moment by some-  thing like a whirlwind--oh, but a very pleasant whirlwind, warm and  fresh, and fragrant of violets ; I received two vigorous kisses, one on  either cheek ; and then I was held off at arm's length, and examined  by a pair of laughing eyes. And at last a voice--rather a deep voice for a woman's, with just  a crisp edge to it, that might have been called slightly nasal, but  was agreeable and individual--a voice said : " En voilà assez.  Come and sit down." She had finished her luncheon, and was taking coffee ; and if  the whole truth must be told, I'm afraid she was taking it with a petit-verre  and a cigarette. She wore an exceedingly simple black  frock, with a bunch of violets in her breast, and a hat with a  sweeping black feather and a daring brim. Her dark luxurious  hair broke into a riot of fluffy little curls about her forehead, and  thence waved richly away to where it was massed behind ; her  cheeks glowed with a lovely colour (thanks, doubtless, to Yorkshire  breezes ; sweet are the uses of adversity) ; her eyes sparkled ; her  lips curved in a perpetual play of smiles, letting her delicate little  teeth show themselves furtively ; and suddenly I realised that this  girl, whom I had never thought of save as one might think of  one's younger sister, suddenly I realised that she was a woman, and By Henry Harland  27 and a radiantly, perhaps even a dangerously handsome woman. I  saw suddenly that she was not merely an attribute, an aspect of  another, not merely Alfred Childe's daughter ; she was a person-  age in herself, a personage to be reckoned with. This sufficiently obvious perception came upon me with such  force, and brought me such emotion, that I dare say for a little  while I sat vacantly staring at her, with an air of preoccupation.  Anyhow, all at once she laughed, and cried out, " Well, when you  get back . . . ? " and, " Perhaps," she questioned, " perhaps you  think it polite to go off wool-gathering like that ? " Whereupon  I recovered myself with a start, and laughed too. " But say that you are surprised, say that you are glad, at least,"  she went on. Surprised! glad! But what did it mean? What was it all  about ? " I couldn't stand it any longer, that's all. I have come home.  Oh, que c'est bon, que c'est bon, que c'est bon ! " " And--England ?--Yorkshire ?--your people ? " " Don't speak of it. It was a bad dream. It is over. It  brings bad luck to speak of bad dreams. I have forgotten it. I am  here--in Paris--at home. Oh, que c'est bon ! " And she smiled  blissfully through eyes filled with tears. Don't tell me that happiness is an illusion. It is her habit, if  you will, to flee before us and elude us ; but sometimes, sometimes  we catch up with her, and can hold her for long moments warm  against our hearts. " Oh, mon père ! It is enough--to be here, where he lived,  where he worked, where he was happy," Nina murmured afterwards. She had arrived the night before ; she had taken a room in the  Hôtel d'Espagne, in the Rue de Médicis, opposite the Luxem-  bourg Garden. I was as yet the only member of the old set she had 28  The Bohemian Girl had looked up. Of course I knew where she had gone   --but not to cry--to kiss it--to place flowers on it. She  could not cry--not now. She was too happy, happy, happy.  Oh, to be back in Paris, her home, where she had lived with  him, where every stick and stone was dear to her because of  him ! Then, glancing up at the clock, with an abrupt change of key,  " Mais allons donc, paresseux !--You must take me to see the  camarades. You must take me to see Chalks." And in the street she put her arm through mine, laughing and  saying, " On nous croira fiancés." She did not walk, she tripped,  she all but danced beside me, chattering joyously in alternate  French and English. " I could stop and kiss them all--the men,  the women, the very pavement. Oh, Paris ! Oh, these good,  gay, kind Parisians ! Look at the sky ! look at the view--down  that impasse--the sunlight and shadows on the houses, the door-  ways, the people. Oh, the air! Oh, the smells! Oue c'est bon  --que je suis contente ! Et dire que j'ai passé cinq mois, mais  cinq grands mois, en Angleterre. Ah, veinard, you--you don't  know how you're blessed." Presently we found ourselves labour- ing knee-deep in a wave of black pinafores, and Nina had plucked  her bunch of violets from her breast, and was dropping them  amongst eager fingers and rosy cherubic smiles. And it was con-  stantly, " Tiens, there's Madame Chose in her kiosque. Bonjour,  madame. Vous allez toujours bien ? " and " Oh, look ! old  Perronet standing before his shop in his shirt-sleeves, exactly as he  has stood at this hour every day, winter or summer, these ten  years. Bonjour, M'sieu Perronet." And you may be sure that  the kindly French Choses and Perronets returned her greetings  with beaming faces. " Ah, mademoiselle, que c'est bon de vous  revoir ainsi. Que vous avez bonne mine!" " It is so strange," she By Henry Harland  29 she said, " to find nothing changed. To think that everything  has gone on quietly in the usual way. As if I hadn't spent an  eternity in exile ! " And at the corner of one street, before a vast  flaunting " bazaar," with a prodigality of tawdry Oriental wares  exhibited on the pavement, and little black shopmen trailing like  beetles in and out amongst them, " Oh," she cried, " the ' Mecque  du Quartier ' ! To think that I could weep for joy at seeing the  ' Mecque du Quartier ' ! " By and by we plunged into a dark hallway, climbed a long,  unsavoury corkscrew staircase, and knocked at a door. A gruff  voice having answered, " 'Trez!" we entered Chalks's bare,  bleak, paint-smelling studio. He was working (from a lay-figure)  with his back towards us ; and he went on working for a minute  or two after our arrival, without speaking. Then he demanded,  in a sort of grunt, " Eh bien, qu'est ce que c'est ? " always with-  out pausing in his work or looking round. Nina gave two little ahems , tense with suppressed mirth ; and slowly, indifferently,  Chalks turned an absent-minded face in our direction. But, next  instant, there was a shout--a rush--a confusion of forms in the  middle of the floor--and I realised that I was not the only one to  be honoured by a kiss and an embrace. " Oh, you're covering  me with paint," Nina protested suddenly ; and indeed he had  forgotten to drop his brush and palette, and great dabs of colour  were clinging to her cloak. While he was doing penance,  scrubbing the garment with rags soaked in turpentine, he kept  shaking his head, and murmuring, from time to time, as he  glanced up at her, " Well, I ll be dumned." " It's very nice and polite of you, Chalks," she said, by and by,  " a very graceful concession to my sex. But, if you think it  would relieve you once for all, you have my full permission to  pronounce it --amned." Chalks 30  The Bohemian Girl Chalks did no more work that afternoon ; and that evening  quite twenty of us dined at Madame Chanve's ; and it was almost  like old times. VIII " Oh, yes," she explained to me afterwards, " my uncle is a good  man. My aunt and cousins are very good women. But for me,  to live with them--pas possible, mon cher. Their thoughts were  not my thoughts, we could not speak the same language. They  disapproved of me unutterably. They suffered agonies, poor  things. Oh, they were very kind, very patient. But--! My  gods were their devils. My father--my great, grand, splendid  father-- was ' poor Alfred,' ' poor uncle Alfred.' Que voulez-  vous ? And then--the life, the society ! The parishioners--the  people who came to tea--the houses where we sometimes dined !  Are you interested in crops ? In the preservation of game ? In  the diseases of cattle ? Olàlà ! (C'est bien le cas de s'en servir,  de cette expression-là.) Olàlà, làlà ! And then--have you ever  been homesick ? Oh, I longed, I pined, for Paris, as one suffocating would long, would die, for air. Enfin, I could not  stand it any longer. They thought it wicked to smoke cigarettes.  My poor aunt--when she smelt cigarette-smoke in my bed-room !  Oh, her face ! I had to sneak away, behind the shrubbery at the  end of the garden, for stealthy whiffs. And it was impossible to  get French tobacco. At last I took the bull by the horns, and  fled. It will have been a terrible shock for them. But better  one good blow than endless little ones ; better a lump-sum, than  instalments with interest." But what was she going to do ? How was she going to live ? For, By Henry Harland  31 For, after all, much as she loved Paris, she couldn't subsist on its  air and sunshine. " Oh, never fear! I'll manage somehow. I'll not die of  hunger," she said confidently. IX And, sure enough, she managed very well. She gave music  lessons to the children of the Quarter, and English lessons to  clerks and shop-girls ; she did a little translating ; she would pose  now and then for a painter friend--she was the original, for  instance, of Norton's " Woman Dancing," which you know.  She even--thanks to the employment by Chalks of what he called  his " in floo ence "--she even contributed a weekly column of Paris  gossip to the  Palladium , a newspaper published at Battle Creek, Michigan, U.S.A., Chalks's native town. " Put in lots about  me, and talk as if there were only two important centres of  civilisation on earth, Battle Crick and Parus, and it'll be a boom,"  Chalks said. We used to have great fun, concocting those  columns of Paris gossip. Nina, indeed, held the pen and cast a  deciding vote ; but we all collaborated. And we put in lots about  Chalks--perhaps rather more than he had bargained for. With  an irony (we trusted) too subtle to be suspected by the good people of Battle Creek, we would introduce their illustrious fellow- citizen, casually, between the Pope and the President of the  Republic ; we would sketch him as he strolled in the Boulevard  arm-in-arm with Monsieur Meissonier, as he dined with the Per-  petual Secretary of the French Academy, or drank his bock in the  afternoon with the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour ; we 32  The Bohemian Girl we would compose solemn descriptive criticisms of his works,  which almost made us die of laughing ; we would interview him  --at length--about any subject ; we would give elaborate bulletins  of his health, and brilliant pen-pictures of his toilets. Sometimes  we would betroth him, marry him, divorce him ; sometimes,  when our muse impelled us to a particularly daring flight, we  would insinuate, darkly, sorrowfully, that perhaps the great man's  morals---- But no ! We were persuaded that rumour accused him  falsely. The story that he had been seen dancing at Bullier's  with the notorious Duchesse de Z---- was a baseless fabrication.  Unprincipled ? Oh, we were nothing if not unprincipled. And  our pleasure was so exquisite, and it worried our victim so. " I  suppose you think it's funny, don't you ? " he used to ask, with a  feint of superior scorn which put its fine flower to our hilarity.  " Look out, or you'll bust," he would warn us, the only uncon-  vulsed member present. " By gum, you're easily amused." We  always wrote of him respectfully as Mr. Charles K. Smith ; we  never faintly hinted at his sobriquet. We would have rewarded  liberally, at that time, any one who could have told us what the K  stood for. We yearned to unite the cryptic word to his surname  by a hyphen ; the mere abstract notion of doing so filled us with  fearful joy. Chalks was right, I dare say ; we were easily amused.  And Nina, at these moments of literary frenzy--I can see her  now : her head bent over the manuscript, her hair in some dis- array, a spiral of cigarette-smoke winding ceilingward from  between the fingers of her idle hand, her lips parted, her eyes  gleaming with mischievous inspirations, her face pale with the  intensity of her glee. I can see her as she would look up, eagerly,  to listen to somebody's suggestion, or as she would motion to us  to be silent, crying, " Attendez--I've got an idea." Then her  pen would dash swiftly, noisily, over her paper for a little, whilst we By Henry Harland  33 we all waited expectantly ; and at last she would lean back,  drawing a long breath, and tossing the pen aside, to read her  paragraph out to us. In a word, she managed very well, and by no means died of  hunger. She could scarcely afford Madame Chanve's three-franc  table d'hôte, it is true ; but we could dine modestly at Leon's,  over the way, and return the Bleu for coffee,--though, it must  be added, that establishment no longer enjoyed a monopoly of  our custom. We patronised it and the Vachette, the Source, the  Ecoles, the Souris, indifferently. Or we would sometimes spend  our evenings in Nina's rooms. She lived in a tremendously swagger house in the Avenue de l'Observatoire--on the sixth  floor, to be sure, but " there was a carpet all the way up." She  had a charming little salon, with her own furniture and piano  (the same that had formerly embellished our café), and no end  of books, pictures, draperies, and pretty things, inherited from  her father or presented by her friends. By this time the inevitable had happened, and we were all in  love with her--hopelessly, resignedly so, and without internecine  rancour, for she treated us, indiscriminately, with a serene, im-  partial, tolerant derision ; but we were savagely, luridly, jealous  and suspicious of all new-comers and of all outsiders. If  we  could  not win her, no one else should ; and we formed ourselves round  her in a ring of fire. Oh, the maddening mock-sentimental,  mock-sympathetic face she would pull, when one of us ventured  to sigh to her of his passion ! The way she would lift her eye-  brows, and gaze at you with a travesty of pity, shaking her head  pensively, and murmuring, " Mon pauvre ami ! Only fancy ! "  And then how the imp, lurking in the corners of her eyes, with  only the barest pretence of trying to conceal himself, would  suddenly leap forth in a peal of laughter ! She had lately read Mr. Howells's 34  The Bohemian Girl Mr. Howells's " Undiscovered Country," and had adopted the  Shakers' paraphrase for love : " Feeling foolish."--" Feeling pretty  foolish to-day, air ye, gentlemen ? " she inquired, mimicking the  dialect of Chalks. " Well, I guess you just ain't feeling any  more foolish than you look ! "--If she would but have taken us  seriously ! And the worst of it was that we knew she was  anything but temperamentally cold. Chalks formulated the  potentialities we divined in her, when he remarked, regretfully,  wistfully, as he often did, " She could love like Hell." Once,  in a reckless moment, he even went so far as to tell her this point-  blank. " Oh, naughty Chalks ! " she remonstrated, shaking her ringer at him. " Do you think that's a pretty word ? But--I  dare say I could." " All the same, Lord help the man you marry," Chalks con-  tinued gloomily. " Oh, I shall never marry," Nina cried. " Because, , I  don't approve of matrimony as an institution. And then--as you  say--Lord help my husband. I should be such an uncomfortable  wife. So capricious, and flighty, and tantalising, and unsettling,  and disobedient, and exacting, and everything. Oh, but a horrid  wife ! No, I shall never marry. Marriage is quite too out-of-date.  I shan't marry ; but, if I ever meet a man and love him--ah ! "  She placed two fingers upon her lips, and kissed them, and waved  the kiss to the skies. This fragment of conversation passed in the Luxembourg  Garden ; and the three or four of us by whom she was accom-  panied glared threateningly at our mental image of that not-  impossible upstart whom she might some day meet and love.  We were sure, of course, that he would be a beast ; we hated him  not merely because he would have cut us out with her, but  because he would be so distinctly our inferior, so hopelessly unworthy By Henry Harland  35 unworthy of her, so helplessly incapable of appreciating her. I  think we conceived of him as tall, with drooping fair moustaches,  and contemptibly meticulous in his dress. He would probably  not be of the Quarter ; he would sneer at  us . " He'll not understand her, he'll not respect her. Take her  peculiar views. We know where she gets them. But he--he'll  despise her for them, at the very time he's profiting by 'em,"  some one said. Her peculiar views of the institution of matrimony, the speaker  meant. She had got them from her father. " The relations of  the sexes should be as free as friendship," he had taught. " If  a man and a woman love each other, it is nobody's business but  their own. Neither the Law nor Society can, with any show  of justice, interfere. That they do interfere, is a survival of  feudalism, a survival of the system under which the individual,  the subject, had no liberty, no rights. If a man and a woman  love each other, they should be as free to determine for themselves  the character, extent, and duration of their intercourse, as two  friends should be. If they wish to live together under the same  roof, let them. If they wish to retain their separate domiciles, let  them. If they wish to cleave to each other till death severs them  --if they wish to part on the morrow of their union--let  them, by heaven. But the couple who go before a priest or a  magistrate, and bind themselves in ceremonial marriage, are  serving to perpetuate tyranny, are insulting the dignity of human  nature." Such was the gospel which Nina had absorbed (don't,  for goodness' sake, imagine that I approve of it because I cite it),  and which she professed in entire good faith. We felt that the  coming man would misapprehend both it and her--though he  would not hesitate to make a convenience of it. Ugh, the  cynic ! We The Yellow Book--Vol. IV.  c 36  The Bohemian Girl We formed ourselves round her in a ring of fire, hoping to  frighten the beast away. But we were miserably, fiercely  anxious, suspicious, jealous. We were jealous of everything in  the shape of a man that came into any sort of contact with her :  of the men who passed her in the street or rode with her in the  omnibus ; of the little  employés de commerce  to whom she gave  English lessons ; of everybody. I fancy we were always more or  less uneasy in our minds when she was out of our sight. Who could  tell what might be happening ? With those lips of hers, those  eyes of hers--oh, we knew how she could love : Chalks had said  it. Who could tell what might already have happened ? Who  could tell that the coming man had not already come ? She was  entirely capable of concealing him from us. Sometimes, in the  evening, she would seem absent, preoccupied. How could we be  sure that she wasn't thinking of him ? Savouring anew the hours  she had passed with him that very day ? Or dreaming of those  she had promised him for to-morrow ? If she took leave of us--  might he not be waiting to join her round the corner ? If she  spent an evening away from us..... And she--she only laughed ; laughed at our jealousy, our fears,  our precautions, as she laughed at our hankering flame. Not  a laugh that reassured us, though ; an inscrutable, enigmatic  laugh, that might have covered a multitude of sins. She had  taken to calling us collectively  Loulou  " Ah, le pauv' Loulou--  so now he has the pretension to be jealous." Then she would be  interrupted by a paroxysm of laughter ; after which, " Oh, qu'il  est drôle," she would gasp. " Pourvu qu'il ne devienne pas  gênant ! " It was all very well to laugh ; but some of us, our personal  equation quite apart, could not help feeling that the joke was of a  precarious quality, that the situation held tragic possibilities. A young By Henry Harland  37 young and attractive girl, by no means constitutionally insus-  ceptible, and imbued with heterodox ideas of marriage--alone in  the Latin Quarter. X I have heard it maintained that the man has yet to be born, who,  in his heart of hearts, if he comes to think the matter over, won't  find himself at something of a loss to conceive why any given  woman should experience the passion of love for any other man ;  that a woman's choice, to all men save the chosen, is, by its very  nature, as incomprehensible as the postulates of Hegel. But, in  Nina's case, even when I regard it from this distance of time, I  still feel, as we all felt then, that the mystery was more than  ordinarily obscure. We had fancied ourselves prepared for any-  thing ; the only thing we weren't prepared for was the thing that befell. We had expected " him " to be offensive, and he wasn't.  He was, quite simply, insignificant. He was a South American,  a Brazilian, a member of the School of Mines : a poor, undersized,  pale, spiritless, apologetic creature, with rather a Teutonic-looking  name, Ernest Mayer. His father, or uncle, was Minister of  Agriculture, or Commerce, or something, in his native land ; and  he himself was attached in some nominal capacity to the Brazilian  Legation, in the Rue de Téhéran, whence, on State occasions, he  enjoyed the privilege of enveloping his meagre little person in a very gorgeous diplomatic uniform. He was beardless, with vague  features, timid light-blue eyes, and a bluish an&#xE6;mic skin. In  manner he was nervous, tremulous, deprecatory--perpetually  bowing, wriggling, stepping back to let you pass, waving his  hands, palms outward, as if to protest against giving you trouble. And 38  The Bohemian Girl And in speech--upon my word, I don't think I ever heard him  compromise himself by any more dangerous assertion than that  the weather was fine, or he wished you good-day. For the most  part he listened mutely, with a flickering, perfunctory smile.  From time to time, with an air of casting fear behind him and  dashing into the imminent deadly breach, he would hazard an  " Ah, oui," or a " Pas mal." For the rest, he played the piano  prettily enough, wrote colourless, correct French verse, and was reputed to be an industrious if not a brilliant student--what we called  un sérieux . It was hard to believe that beautiful, sumptuous Nina Childe,  with her wit, her humour, her imagination, loved this neutral little  fellow ; yet she made no secret of doing so. We tried to frame  a theory that would account for it. " It's the maternal instinct,"  suggested one. " It's her chivalry," said another ; " she's the sort  of woman who could never be very violently interested by a man  of her own size. She would need one she could look up to, or  else one she could protect and pat on the head." " 'God be thanked, the meanest of His creatures boasts two soul-sides, one to  face the world with, one to show a woman when he loves her,'"  quoted a . " Perhaps Coco "--we had nicknamed him Coco  --" has luminous qualities that we don't dream of, to which he  gives the rein when they're à deux ." Anyhow, if we were mortified that she should have preferred  such a one to us, we were relieved to think that she hadn't fallen  into the clutches of a blackguard, as we had feared she would.  That Coco was a blackguard we never guessed. We made the  best of him, because we had to choose between doing that and  seeing less of Nina ; in time, I am afraid--such is the influence  of habit--we rather got to like him, as one gets to like any  innocuous, customary thing. And if we did not like the situation --for By Henry Harland  39 --for none of us, whatever may have been our practice, shared  Nina's hereditary theories anent the sexual conventions-- we  recognised that we couldn't alter it, and we shrugged our shoulders  resignedly, trusting it might be no worse. And then, one day, she announced, " Ernest and I are going to  be married." And when we cried out why, she explained that--  despite her own conviction that marriage was a barbarous institu-  tion--she felt, in the present state of public opinion, people owed  legitimacy to their children. So Ernest, who, according to both  French and Brazilian law, could not, at his age, marry without  his parents' consent, was going home to procure it. He would  sail next week ; he would be back before three months. Ernest  sailed from Lisbon ; and the post, a day or two after he was safe  at sea, brought Nina a letter from him. It was a wild, hysterical,  remorseful letter, in which he called himself every sort of name.  He said his parents would never dream of letting him marry her. They were Catholics, they were very devout, they had prejudices,  they had old-fashioned notions. Besides, he had been as good as  affianced to a lady of their election ever since he was born. He  was going home to marry his second cousin. XI Shortly after the birth of Camille I had to go to London, and  it was nearly a year before I came back to Paris. Nina was  looking better than when I had left, but still in nowise like her  old self--pale and worn and worried, with a smile that was the  ghost of her former one. She had been waiting for my return,  she said, to have a long talk with me. " I have made a little plan. I want 40  The Bohemian Girl I want you to advise me. Of course you must advise me to stick  to it." And when we had reached her lodgings, and were alone in the  salon, " It is about Camille, it is about her bringing-up," she  explained. " The Latin Quarter ? It is all very well for you,  for me ; but for a growing child ? Oh, my case was different ;  I had my father. But Camille ? Restaurants, cafés, studios, the  Boul' Miche, and this little garret--do they form a wholesome  environment ? Oh, no, no--I am not a renegade. I am a  Bohemian ; I shall always be ; it is bred in the bone. But my daughter--ought she not to have the opportunity, at least, of being different, of being like other girls ? You see, I had my father ;  she will have only me. And I distrust myself ; I have no  ' system.' Shall I not do better, then, to adopt the system of the  world ? To give her the conventional education, the conventional  ' advantages ' ? A home, what they call home influences.  Then, when she has grown up, she can choose for herself.  Besides, there is the question of francs and centimes. I have been able to earn a living for myself, it is true. But even that is  more difficult now ; I can give less time to work ; I am in debt.  And we are two ; and our expenses must naturally increase from  year to year. And I should like to be able to put something  aside. Hand-to-mouth is a bad principle when you have a growing  child." After a little pause she went on : "So my problem is, , how  to earn our livelihood, and, secondly, how to make something like  a home for Camille, something better than this tobacco-smoky,  absinthe-scented atmosphere of the Latin Quarter. And I can  see only one way of accomplishing the two things. You will  smile--but I have considered it from every point of view. I have  examined myself, my own capabilities. I have weighed all the chances. By Henry Harland  41 chances. I wish to take a flat, in another quarter of the town,  near the Etoile or the Pare Monceau, and--open a  pension . There  is my plan." I had a much simpler and pleasanter plan of my own, but of  that, as I knew, she would hear nothing. I did not smile at hers,  however ; though I confess it was not easy to imagine madcap  Nina in the rôle of a landlady, regulating the accounts and pre-  siding at the table of a boarding-house. I can't pretend that I  believed there was the slightest likelihood of her filling it with  success. But I said nothing to discourage her ; and the fact that  she is rich to-day proves how little I divined the resources of her  character. For the boarding-house she kept was an exceedingly  good boarding-house ; she showed herself the most practical of  mistresses ; and she prospered amazingly. Jeanselme, whose  father had recently died, leaving him a fortune, lent her what  money she needed to begin with ; she took and furnished a flat in  the Avenue de l'Alma ; and I--I feel quite like an historical  personage when I remember that I was her  boarder. Others  soon followed me, though, for she had friends amongst all the peoples of the earth--English and Americans, Russians, Italians, Austrians, even Roumanians and Servians, as well as French ;  and each did what he could to help. At the end of a year she  overflowed into the flat above ; then into that below ; then she  acquired the lease of the entire house. She worked tremendously,  she was at it early and late, her eyes were everywhere ; she set an  excellent table ; she employed admirable servants ; and if her  prices were a bit stiff, she gave you your money's worth, and  there were no " surprises." It was comfortable and quiet ; the street was bright, the neighbourhood convenient. You could  dine in the common salle-à-manger if you liked, or in your  private sitting-room. And you never saw your landlady except for 42  The Bohemian Girl for purposes of business. She lived apart, in the entresol, alone  with Camille and her body-servant Jeanne. There was the  " home " she had set out to make. Meanwhile another sort of success was steadily thrusting itself  upon her--she certainly never went out of her way to seek it ; she  was much too busy to do that. Such of her old friends as remained  in Paris came frequently to see her, and new friends gathered  round her. She was beautiful, she was intelligent, responsive,  entertaining. In her salon, on a Friday evening, you would meet  half the lions that were at large in the town--authors, painters,  actors, actresses, deputies, even an occasional Cabinet minister.  Red ribbons and red rosettes shone from every corner of the  room. She had become one of the oligarchs of  la haute Bohème , she  had become one of the celebrities of Paris. It would be tiresome  to count the novels, poems, songs, that were dedicated to her, the  portraits of her, painted or sculptured, that appeared at the  Mirlitons or the Palais de l'Industrie. Numberless were the partis  who asked her to marry them (I know one, at least, who  has returned to the charge again and again), but she only laughed,  and vowed she would never marry. I don't say that she has never had her fancies, her experiences ; but she has consistently  scoffed at marriage. At any rate, she has never affected the least  repentance for what some people would call her " fault." Her  ideas of right and wrong have undergone very little modification.  She was deceived in her estimate of the character of Ernest Mayer,  if you please ; but she would indignantly deny that there was  anything sinful, anything to be ashamed of, in her relations with  him. And if, by reason of them, she at one time suffered a good deal of pain, I am sure she accounts Camille an exceeding great compensation. That Camille is her child she would scorn to  make a secret. She has scorned to assume the conciliatory title of By Henry Harland  43 of Madame. As plain Mademoiselle, with a daughter, you must  take her or leave her. And, somehow, all this has not seemed to  make the faintest difference to her  clientèle , not even to the primmest of the English. I can't think of one of them who  did not treat her with deference, like her, and recommend  her house. But  her  house they need recommend no more, for she has sold it.  Last spring, when I was in Paris, she told me she was about to do  so. " Ouf ! I have lived with my nose to the grindstone long enough. I am going to 'retire.'" What money she had saved from  season to season, she explained, she had entrusted to her friend  Baron C * * * * * for speculation. " He is a wizard, and so  I am a rich woman. I shall have an income of something like  three thousand pounds, mon cher ! Oh, we will roll in it. I have  had ten bad years--ten hateful years. You don't know how I  have hated it all, this business, this drudgery, this cut-and-dried,  methodical existence--moi, enfant de Bohème ! But, enfin, it was  obligatory. Now we will change all that. Nous reviendrons à  nos premières amours. I shall have ten good years--ten years of  barefaced pleasure. Then--I will range myself--perhaps. There  is the darlingest little house for sale, a sort of châlet, built of red  brick, with pointed windows and things, in the Rue de Lisbonne.  I shall buy it--furnish it--decorate it. Oh, you will see. I shall  have my carriage, I shall have toilets, I shall entertain, I shall  give dinners--olàlà ! No more boarders, no more bores, cares,  responsibilities. Only, my friends and-- life!  I feel like one  emerging from ten years in the galleys, ten years of penal  servitude. To the Pension Childe--bonsoir ! " " That's all very well for you," her listener complained sombrely.  " But for me ? Where shall I stop when I come to Paris ? " " With me. You shall be my guest. I will kill you if you ever 44  The Bohemian Girl ever go elsewhere. You shall pass your old age in a big chair in  the best room, and Camille and I will nurse your gout and make  herb-tea for you." " And I shall sit and think of what might have been." " Yes, we'll indulge all your little foibles. You shall sit and  ' feel foolish '--from dawn to dewy eve." XII If you had chanced to be walking in the Bois-de-Boulogne this  afternoon, you might have seen a smart little basket-phaeton flash  past, drawn by two glossy bays, and driven by a woman--a  woman with sparkling eyes, a lovely colour, great quantities of  soft dark hair, and a figure-- " Hélas, mon père, la taille d'une déesse "-- a smiling woman, in a wonderful blue-grey toilet, grey driving-  gloves, and a bold-brimmed grey-felt hat with waving plumes.  And in the man beside her you would have recognised your  servant. You would have thought me in great luck, perhaps you  would have envied me. But-- esse, quam videri ! --I would I were  as enviable as I looked. A Landscape By William Hyde Vespertilia By   Graham R. Tomson IN the late autumn's dusky-golden prime, When sickles gleam, and rusts the idle plough, The time of apples dropping from the bough, And yellow leaves on sycamore and lime. O'er grassy uplands far above the sea Often at twilight would my footsteps fare, And oft I met a stranger-woman there Who stayed and spake with me : Hard by the ancient barrow smooth and green, Whose rounded burg swells dark upon the sky Lording it high o'er dusky dell and dene, We wandered--she and I. Ay, many a time as came the evening hour And the red moon rose up behind the sheaves, I found her straying by that barren bower, Her fair face glimmering like a white wood-flower That gleams through withered leaves : Her mouth was redder than the pimpernel, Her eyes seemed darker than the purple air 'Neath brows half hidden--I remember well-- 'Mid mists of cloudy hair. And 50  Vespertilia And all about her breast, around her head, Was wound a wide veil shadowing cheek and chin, Woven like the ancient grave-gear of the dead : A twisted clasp and pin Confined her long blue mantle's heavy fold Of splendid tissue dropping to decay, Faded like some rich raiment worn of old, With rents and tatters gaping to the day. Her sandals, wrought about with threads of gold, Scarce held together still, so worn were they, Yet sewn with winking gems of green and blue, Where pale as pearls her naked feet shone through. And all her talk was of some outland rare, Where myrtles blossom by the blue sea's rim, And life is ever good and sunny and fair ; " Long since," she sighed, " I sought this island grey. Here where the wind moans and the sun is dim, When his beaked galleys cleft the ocean spray, For love I followed him." Once, as we stood, we heard the nightingale Pipe from a thicket on the sheer hillside, Breathless she hearkened, still and marble-pale, Then turned to me with strange eyes open wide-- " Now I remember ! .... Now I know ! " said she, " Love will be life .... ah, Love  is  Life ! " she cried, " And thou--thou lovest me ? " I took her chill hands gently in mine own, " Dear, but no love is mine to give," I said, " My heart is colder than the granite stone That By Graham R. Tomson  51 That guards my true-love in her grassy bed ; My faith and troth are hers, and hers alone, Are hers .... and she is dead." Weeping, she drew her veil about her face, And faint her accents were and dull with pain ; " Poor Vespertilia ! gone her days of grace, Now doth she plead for love--and plead in vain : None praise her beauty now, or woo her smile ! * * * * * Ah, hadst thou loved me but a little while, I might have lived again. Then slowly as a wave along the shore She glided from me to yon sullen mound ; My frozen heart, relenting, smote me sore-- Too late--I searched the hollow slopes around, Swiftly I followed her, but nothing found, Nor saw nor heard her more. And now, alas, my true-love's memory Even as a dream of night-time half-forgot, Fades faint and far from me, And all my thoughts are of the stranger still, Yea, though I loved her not : I loved her not--and yet--I fain would see, Upon the wind-swept hill, Her dark veil fluttering in the autumn breeze ; Fain would I hear her changeful voice awhile, Soft as the wind of spring-tide in the trees, And watch her slow, sweet smile. Ever 52  Vespertilia Ever the thought of her abides with me Unceasing as the murmur of the sea ; When the round moon is low and night-birds flit, When sink the stubble-fires with smouldering flame, Over and o'er the sea-wind sighs her name, And the leaves whisper it. "  Poor Vespertilia ," sing the grasses sere, "  Poor Vespertilia ," moans the surf-beat shore ; Almost I feel her very presence near-- Yet she comes nevermore. The House of Shame By   H. B. Marriott Watson THERE was no immediate response to his knock, and, ere he rapped  again, Farrell turned stupidly and took in a vision of  the street. The morning sunshine streamed on Piccadilly ; a snap of air shook the tree-tops in the Park ; and beyond, the  greensward sparkled with dew. The traffic roared along the road-  way, but the cabs upon the stand rode like ships at anchor on a  windless ocean. Below him flowed the tide of passengers. The dis-  passion of that drifting scene affected him by contrast with his own  warm flood of emotions ; the picture--the trees, the sunlight, and  the roar--imprinted itself sharply upon his brain. His glance flitted  among the faces, and wandered finally to the angle of the crossway,  by which his cab was sauntering leisurely. With a shudder he  wheeled face-about to the door, and raised the clapper. For a  moment yet he stood in hesitation. The current of his thoughts  ran like a mill-race, and a hundred discomforting impressions  flowed together. The house lay so quiet ; the sunlight struck the  window-panes with a lively and discordant glare. He put his  hand into his pocket and withdrew a latchkey, twiddling it  restlessly between his fingers. With a thrust and a twist the door  would slip softly open, and he might enter unobserved. He  entertained the impulse but a moment. He dared not enter in that The Yellow Book--Vol. IV.  D 54  The House of Shame that nocturnal fashion ; he would prefer admittance publicly, in  the eye of all, as one with nothing to conceal, with no black  shame upon him. His return should be ordinary, matter-of-fact ;  he would choose that Jackson should see him cool and unperturbed.  In some way, too, he vaguely hoped to cajole his memory, and  to ensnare his willing mind into a belief that nothing unusual had  happened. He knocked with a loud clatter, feet sounded in the hall, and  the door fell open. Jackson looked at him with no appearance  of surprise. " Good morning, Jackson," he said, kicking his feet against the  step. He entered, and laid his umbrella in the stand. " Is your  mistress up yet ? " he asked. " Yes, sir," said the servant, placidly; " she's in the morning-  room, sir, I think." There was no emotion in the man's voice ; his face wore no  aspect of suspicion or inquiry, and somehow Farrell felt already  relieved. To-day was as yesterday, unmarked by any grave event. " Ah ! " he said, and passed down the hall. At the foot of the  stairs he paused again, with a pretence of dusting something from  his coat, and winced at the white gleam of his dress-shirt.  Nothing stirred in the house save a maid brushing overhead, and  for a while he lingered. He still shrank from encountering his  wife, and there was his room for refuge until he had put on a quieter  habit of mind. His clothes damned him so loudly that all the  world must guess at a glance. And then again the man resumed  his manliness ; he would not browbeat himself for the mere know-  ledge of his own shame ; and, passing rapidly along the hall, he  pushed open the door of the morning-room. A woman rose on his entrance, with a happy little cry. " George ! " she said, " Dear George, I'm so glad." She By H. B. Marriott Watson  55 She put up her arms and lifted her face to him. Farrell  shivered ; the invitation repelled him ; in the moment of that  innocent welcome the horror of his sin rose foul before him. He  touched her lightly on the cheek and withdrew a little distance. " I'm not a nice object, Letty," he faltered ; " see what a mess  the beastly mud has made of me. And look at my fine dress-  clothes." He laughed with constraint. " You'd think I lived in  them." " Oh, dearest, I was so disappointed," said the girl ; " I sat up  ever so late for you. But I was so tired. I'm always tired now.  And at last I yawned myself to sleep. Where ever have you been ? " The colour flickered in Farrell's face, and his fingers trembled  on the table. " Oh, I couldn't get away from Fowler's, you know. Went  there after the club, and lost my train like a fool." His uneasy eyes rose furtively to her face. He was invested  with morbid suspicions, suspicions of her suspicion ; but the girl's  gaze rested frankly upon him, and she smiled pleasantly. " That dreadful club ! You shan't go there again for a week,  darling. I'm so glad you've come. I was nearly being very  frightened about you. I've been so lonely." She took him by  the arm. " Poor dear, and you had to come all through London  with those things on. Didn't people stare ? " " I will change them," he said abruptly, and turned to leave. " What ! " she said archly, " Would you go without--and I  haven't seen you for so long." She threw her arms about his neck. " For God's sake--No, no, Letty, don't touch me," he broke  out harshly. The girl's lips parted, and a look of pain started into her face. " I mean " he explained quickly, " I am so very dirty, dear.  You'd soil your pretty frock." " Silly ! " 56  The House of Shame " Silly ! " she returned smiling, " and it isn't a pretty frock. I  can't wear pretty frocks any longer," she added mournfully. He dropped his eyes before the flush that sprang into her cheeks,  and left the room hurriedly. His shame followed him about all day, dogging him like a  shadow. It lurked in corners and leaped out upon him. Some-  times it crept away and hovered in the remoter distance ; he had  almost forgotten its attendance ; and then in the thick of his  laughing conversation it fell upon him black once more. It  skulked ever within call, dwindled at times, grey and insignificant.  When he stopped to exchange a sentence in the street, it slid  away ; he moved on solitary, and it ran out before him, dark  and portentous. Remorse bit deep into him, remorse and a  certain fear of discovery. The hours with his wife were filled  with uneasy thoughts, and he would fain have variegated the  cheerless monotony of his conscience by adding a guest to his  dinner-table. But from this course he was deterred by delicacy ;  for, at his suggestion, Letty looked at him, winced a little, smiled  ever so faintly, and, with an ineffable expression of tender em-  barrassment, drew her dressing-gown closer round her body. He could not press the indignity upon her young and sensitive  mind. But the fall of night, which he had so dreaded, brought him a  change of mood. The table was stocked with the fine fruits of a  rare intelligence ; the plate shone with the white linen ; and  all the comforts waited upon his appetite. It was no gross  content that overtook him, but the satisfaction of a body gently  appeased. His sin had faded wonderfully into the distance, had  grown colder, and no longer burned intolerably upon his con- science. He found himself at times regarding it with reluctant  equanimity. He stared at it with the eyes of a judicial stranger. Men By H. B. Marriott Watson  57 Men were so wide apart from women ; they were ruled by  another code of morals. If this were a pity, it fell at least of  their nature and their history. Was not this the prime lesson  science had taught the world ? But still the shame flickered up  before him ; he could watch its appearances more calmly, could  reason and debate of it, but it was still impertinently persistent.  And yet he was more certain of himself. To-morrow the discom-  fort would return, no doubt, but with enfeebled spirit ; he would  suffer a very proper remorse for some time--perhaps a week--and  then the affair would dismiss itself, and his memory would own  the dirty blot no longer. As the meal went forward his temper rose. He smiled upon his wife with less diffidence ; he conversed  with less effort. But strangely, as he mended, and the  horror  of his guilt receded, he had a leaning to confession. Before, he  had felt that pardon was impossible, but now that he was come  within range of forgiving himself, he began to desire forgiveness  from Letty also. The inclination was vague and formless, yet  it moved him towards the subject in an aimless way. He found  himself wondering, with a throb in his blood, how she would receive his admissions, and awoke with the tail of her last  sentence in his ears. " I'm so glad the servants have gone. I much prefer being  alone with you, George." " Yes," he murmured absently, " they're a nuisance, aren't  they ? " She pushed the claret to him, and he filled his glass abstractedly.  Should he tell her now, he was thinking, and let penitence and  pardon crown a terrible day ? At her next words he looked up,  wondering. " Had Mr. Fowler any news of Edward ? " she asked idly. The direction of her thoughts was his ; he played with the thought 58  The House of Shame thought of confession ; his mind itched to be freed of its  burden. " Oh no, we were too busy," he laughed uneasily. " The fact  is, you see, Letty dear--I have a confession to make---- She regarded him inquiringly, even anxiously. He had taken  the leap without his own knowledge ; the words refused to frame  upon his tongue. Of a sudden the impulse fled, screaming for its  life, and he was brought up, breathless and scared, upon the brink  of a giddy precipice. " What confession, darling ? " she asked in a voice which showed  some fear. The current of his ideas stopped in full flow ; where a hundred  explanations should have rushed about his brain, he could find not  one poor lie for use. " What do you mean, dearest ? " said his wife, her face  straightened with anxiety. Farrell paled and flushed warm. " Oh nothing, my darling  child," he said with a hurried laugh ; " we played baccarat." " George ! " she cried reproachfully. " How could you, when  you had promised ? " " I don't know," he stumbled on feverishly. " I was weak, I  suppose, and they wanted it, and--God knows I've never done it  before, since I promised, Letty," be broke off sharply. The girl said nothing at the moment, but sat staring at the  table-cloth, and then reached out a hand and touched his tremulous  fingers. " There, there, dear boy," she murmured soothingly, " I won't  be cross ; only please, please, don't break your word again," " No, I won't, I won't," muttered the man. " I daresay it was hard, but it cost you your train, George, and  you were punishe by losing my society for one whole night. So there By H. B. Marriott Watson  59 there--it's all right." She pressed the hand softly, her face glow- ing under the candle-light with some soft emotion. Farrell withdrew his arm gently. " Have some more wine, dear," said his wife. She raised the bottle, and was replenishing his glass when he  pushed it roughly aside. " No more," he said shortly, " no more." The wound broke open in his conscience, red and raw. The  peace which had gathered upon him lifted ; he was shaken into  fears and tremors, and that devilish memory, which had retired so  far, came back upon him, urgent and instant, proclaiming him a  coward and a scoundrel. He sat silent and disturbed, with his  eyes upon the crumbs, among which his fingers were playing rest-  lessly. Letty rose, and passed to the window. " How dark it has fallen ! " she said, peeping through the  blinds, " and the rain is pelting so hard. I'm glad I'm not out.  How cold it is ! Do stir the fire, dearest." Farrell rose, and went to the chimneypiece. He struck the  poker through the crust of coal, and the flames leapt forth and  roared about the pieces. The heat burned in his face. There came  upon him unbidden the recollection of those days, a year ago,  when he and Letty had nestled side by side, watching for fortunes  in the masses of that golden core. She had seen palaces and stately  domes ; her richer imagination culled histories from the glowing  embers ; while he, searching and searching in vain, had been  content to receive her fancies and sit by simply with his arm about her. The thought touched him to a smile as he mused in  the flood of the warmth. Letty still stood peering out upon the street, and her voice  came to him, muffled, from behind the curtain. " Oh, those poor creatures ! How cold and how wet they must be ! 60  The House of Shame be ! Look, George, dear. Why don't they go indoors out of  the rain ? " Farrell, the smile still upon his lips, turned his face towards  her as he stooped. " Who, child ? " " Why, those women," said his wife, pitifully, " why don't they  go home ? They keep coming backwards and forwards. I've seen  the same faces pass several times. And they look so bleak and  wretched, with those horrid tawdry dresses. No one ought to be  out to-night." The poker fell from Farrell's hand with a clatter upon the  fender. " Damn them ! " he cried, in a fierce, harsh voice. The girl pulled the curtain back, and looked at him. " Darling," she said, plaintively, " what is it ? Why do you  say such horrible things ? " Farrell's face was coloured with passion ; he stood staring  angrily at her. " George, George," she said, coming to him, " why are you so  angry with me ? Oughtn't I to be sorry for them ? I can't help  it ; it seems so sad. I know they're not nice people. They're  dreadful, dear, of course. I've always heard that," and she laid her  face against his breast. " But it can't be good for them to be out  this wretched night, even if they are wicked." She pressed against him as for sympathy, but Farrell made no  response. A fearful tension held his arms and body in a kind of  paralysis ; but presently he patted her head softly, and put her  gently from him. " I'm in a very bad temper to-night, dear " he said, slowly. " I  suppose I ought to go to bed and hide myself till I'm better." She clung to him still. " Don't put me away, George. I don't mind By H. B. Marriott Watson  61 mind if you are in a bad temper. I love you, dearest. Kiss me,  dear, kiss me ; I get so frightened now." A spasm contracted his features ; he bent over and kissed her ;  then he turned away. " I will go and read," he said ; " I shall be better then." She ran after him. " Let me come too, George. I will sit  still and won't disturb you. You can't think how I hate being  alone now. I can't understand it. Do let me come, for you  know I must go to bed early, I was up so late last night." The pleading words struck him like a blow. " Come, then,"  he answered, taking her hand. " And you may swear if you want to very much," she whispered,  laughing, as they passed through the door. The sun rose bright and clear ; the sky, purged of its vapours,  shone as fine as on a midsummer day. With this complaisance of  the weather Farrell's blacker mood had passed. His weak nature,  sensitive as it was to the touch of circumstances, recovered easily  from their influences. Sleep had renewed the elastic qualities of  his mind, and the smiling heaven set him in great spirits. Letty,  too, seemed better, and ate and talked with a more natural gaiety.  The nightmare of the previous evening was singularly dim and characterless. He tried to recall the terror of it, and wondered  why it had so affected him, with every circumstance of happiness  around--his smiling wife, a comfortable house, and the pleasant  distractions of fortune. The gulf that opened between Letty  and himself was there by the will of nature. He had but flung  aside the conventions that concealed it. It was a horrid gap, but  he had not contrived it. The sexes kept different laws, and he  himself, in all likelihood, came nearer to what she would require of  him than any other man. He assured himself with conviction that he would forget altogether in a few days. The 62  The House of Shame The day was pleasantly filled, but not too full for the elaboration  of these arguments. They soothed him ; he grew philosophic ; he  discussed the conditions of love with himself ; he even broached  the problem in an abstract way over his coffee at the club. For  the  time he thought that he had clearly determined the nature  of his affection for Letty. It was integral and single, it was  built upon a pack of sentiments, it was very tender, and it would  wear extremely well ; but it was not that high passion which  he had once supposed. The unfamiliarity of that earlier  exaltation had deceived him into a false definition of Love. There  was none such in circulation among human bodies. There were degrees upon degrees of affection, and Letty and he stood very  high in rank ; but to conceive of their love as something emanating  from a superior sphere outside relation to the world and other human  beings was the absurd and delightful flight of heedless passion. He had laid his ghost, and came home to his dinner in an  excellent humour. The girl looked forlorn and weary, but  brightened a good deal on his return. With her for audience he  chattered in quite a sparkling temper. Letty said little, but  regarded him often with great shy eyes. He looked up some-  times to find them upon him with a wistful, even a pleading, gaze.  She watched every movement he took jealously. But she was obviously content, and even gay in a sad little fashion. He did not understand, but his spirits were too newly blythe to dwell upon a  puzzle. He noticed with scarce a wonder little starts of pettishness  which he had never seen before. They flashed and were gone, and  the large eyes still followed him with tenderness. She rested her  arm across the table in the middle of a story he was telling, and  rearranged his silver. " You must not cross your knives," she said playfully. " That's  a bad omen." He laughed and continued his narrative. Left By H. B. Marriott Watson  63 Left to himself, Farrell lit a cigarette and filled his glass with  wine. The current of his spirits had passed, but he felt extremely  comfortable, and very shortly his mind stole after his wife, who  was playing softly in the further room. He could see the yellow  fabric of the distant curtains gleaming softly in the lamp-light.  He had a desire for a certain air, but could not bring himself to  interrupt. An atmosphere of content enwrapped him, and he  leaned back lazily in his chair. Reflections came to him easily.  Surely there was no greater comfort than this serene domestic happiness with its pleasant round of change. He had set Letty's  love and his in a place too low for justice. It held a sweeter  fragrance, it was touched with higher light, than the commoner  affections of common people. A genial warmth flooded his soul,  and his heart nestled into the comfort of desire. He was hot  with wine, and his whole being thrilled with the content of his own  reflections. He asked no better than this quiet ecstacy, repeated  though a suave untroubled life. The personal charm of that fine  body, the intimate distinctions of its subtle grace, the flow of that  soft voice, the sweet attention of that devoted human soul--these  were his lot by fortune. They conducted him upon a future  which was strangely attractive. He had loved her for some months  more than a year, and earlier that day he had summoned his bridal thoughts down to a pedestrian level ; but how in this hour of  sudden illumination, flushed with the kindly influence of his wine,  his afternoon fancy seemed to him ungenerously clipt and tame.  Letty stood for what was noble in his narrow life ; she invited  him upon a high ideal way. If he were framed of grosser clay,  it was she who would refine the fabric. The thought struck  him sharply. He had learned to dispose his error in its proper  place, among the sins, and he was not going to assign penalties unduly ; but the bare fact came home to him that he was unworthy 64  The House of Shame unworthy of this woman's love, that no man deserved it. He  had evilly entreated her, but he would rise to a new level in her  company and with her aid. She should renew in him the faded  qualities of innocence and pure-heartedness which as a child he  had once possessed. He would ask her mercy, and use her help.  Her pardon should purge him of his dishonour ; she should take him  to her heart, and perfect faith should rest between them. The vision he had conceived drew his attention strongly ; he  seemed to himself, and in a measure was, ennobled by this aspira-  tion. Out of the fulness of his penitence he now desired the  confession he had feared but a little time before. And, as he  reflected, the notes of the piano changed, and Letty shot into  a gay  chansonnette , trilling softly over the sharp little runs. The  careless leisure of the air took off his thoughts with it. It  would be a bad world in which they might not be happy. The  story would hurt her, he was sure ; indeed, he could conjure before  him the start of pain in her eyes. But after the shock she would  resume her trust, and forget, as he was forgetting. He was entirely  certain of her love, and, that secure, nothing could divide them.  Perhaps she were better left to herself till she recovered from the  blow ; he would go away for a day or two. It might even take  her worse than he expected, and he would have dull faces and  tearful reproaches for a week or more. If this fell out, it was his  punishment, and he would bear it in humility. As his thoughts ran he had not noticed that the music ceased,  and Letty's voice broke on his reverie. " Mayn't I sit with you, dear," she pleaded. " It's so solitary  in the big room ! " " Why, of course, sweetheart," said Farrell gently ; " come in,  and close the door ; we'll be snug for a little while in here." Letty stood by his chair and stroked his head. " You By H. B. Marriott Watson  65 " You never came to say good-night to me last night," she said reproachfully. Farrell put up his hand and took hers. " Dearest, you must forgive me. I--I was very tired, and had  a headache." " Ah, that was the penalty for staying up so late," she replied playfully. Farrell smiled and patted her hand. " But you will come to-night, won't you ? " she urged. " Dear heart, of course I will," he said, smiling indulgently.  " I'll come and have a long talk with you." His wife sighed, in part, as it seemed, with satisfaction, and  leaned her chin upon his hair. " Life is very curious, isn't it, George ? " she said meditatively,  her eyes gazing in abstraction at the wall. " There are so many  things we don't know. I never dreamed---- Farrell patted her hand again, affectionately, reassuringly. " I couldn't have guessed," she went on, dreamily. " It is all  so strange and painful, and yet not quite painful. I wonder if  you understand, George." " I think I do, dear," said he softly. " Ah, but how can you quite ? Girls are so ignorant. Do  you think they ought to be told ? I shouldn't have liked to be  told, though. I should have been so afraid, but now somehow I'm  not afraid--not quite." A note of pain trembled through her voice ; she drew a sharp  breath and shivered. " George, you don't think I shall die, do you, George ? Oh,  George, if I should die ! " She fell on her knees at his feet, looking into his face  with searching eyes that pleaded for comfort. He drew her head 66  The House of Shame head towards him, a gulp in his throat, and caressed her  hair. " There, child, there ! " he said soothingly, " you are frightening yourself. Of course not, silly one, of course not." She crouched against his knees, and he stroked her hair tenderly.  Pity pulled at his heart, and at the touch of her he was warmed  with affection. He had no means of consolation save this  smoothing motion of the palm, but he yearned for some deeper  expression of his love and sympathy. In the silence his thoughts  turned to their former occupation, and he felt nearer than ever  to his wife. He would tell her when she had recovered. She raised her head at length and looked at him. " Oh, you will think I'm not brave " she said tremulously,  " but I am brave--indeed, George. It is only sometimes that I  get this fit of depression, and it overbears me. But it isn't me ;--  it is something quite foreign within me : I was never a coward,  dear." " No, darling," he answered, " of course you are not a coward.  You're brave, very brave ; you're my dear brave wife." She  smiled at him faintly. " And you know, Letty," he went on,  still with his hand upon her head. " I think we've been very  happy together, and shall be very happy together, always. There  is so much that binds us to one another. You love me, dear, don't you ? and you could never doubt that I love you, could  you ? " Letty shook her head. He cast down his eyes, patting the  tresses softly. " And I think you know that well enough and are certain  enough of that not to misjudge me," he resumed quietly. " If I  have made a mistake, Letty, it is not you who will be hardest  on me, I am sure. It is I myself. If I have fallen into a seeming By H. B. Marriott Watson  67 seeming disloyalty, it is not I, as you will believe and understand,  but something, as you said just now, quite foreign within me.  For I could only be true and loyal and--" He hesitated, raising his shameful eyes to her. " What--what is it, George ? " she asked anxiously, " what  have you done ? " His hand rose and fell mechanically upon her  head. He parted his lips with an effort, and continued. The  task was harder than he had thought. " It is right " he said slowly, " that we should have no secrets  from one another; it is necessary, dear, that we should bear all things  in common. To be man and wife, and to love each other, calls for  this openness between us." He stumbled on the threshold of his  confession ; the pain of this slow progression suddenly unnerved  him ; all at once he took it with a rush. " Darling," he cried  quickly and on a sharper note, " I want to confess something to  you, and I want your forgiveness. That night I was away I did not spend with Fowler. I spent it-- " You spent it gambling ? " she asked, in a low voice. " No," he said with a groan, " I spent it in another house--I  spent it--I spent it in shame." He breathed the better for the words, even though a terrible  silence reigned in the room. At least the worst part of his  penalty was undergone, for the explanation was over. But when she spoke he realised, with a sense of dread, that he  had not passed the ordeal. " I don't understand, George," she said in a voice thick with  trouble. " What is it ? Where did you stay ? " The strain was too great for his weak nerves. " For God's  sake, Letty," he broke out, " try to understand me and forgive  me. I dined too well ; I was almost drunk. I left the club with  Fowler very late. Oh, it's hideous to have to tell you. I met some 68  The House of Shame some one I had never seen since--Oh, long before I loved you. I  could not pass her. I--O God ! can't you understand ? Don't  make me explain so horribly." The tale ran from him in short and broken sentences. His  fingers twisted nervously about a wisp of her hair ; his gaze had  nowhere rest. She looked full into his face with frightened  eyes. " Do you mean--those women--we saw ? " she asked at last,  in a voice pitched so low that he hardly heard. " Yes," he whispered ; and then again there was silence. The  agony of the suspense was intolerable. " You will never forgive  me," he muttered. He felt her trembling hands grow cold under his touch ; and as  she still kept silence, he dropped his slow, reluctant glance to meet  hers. At the sight of the terrified eyes he put his hands towards  her quickly. " Letty, Letty," he cried, " for God's sake, don't look like that.  Speak to me ; say you forgive me. Dearest, darling, forgive me." She rose as if unconscious of her action, and, walking slowly to  the fireplace, stood looking at the red flames. " Letty," he called, " don't spurn me like this. Darling,  darling ! " His attitude, as he waited for her response, there in the centre of  the room, was one of singular despair. His mouth was wried  with an expression of suffering ; he endured all the pangs of a  sensitive nature which has been always wont to shelter itself from  pain. But still she made no answer. And then she seemed  suddenly taken with a great convulsion ; her body trembled and  shivered ; she wheeled half-way round with a cry ; her eyes shone  with pain. " George, George ! " she screamed on a horrid note of agony, and By H. B. Marriott Watson  69 and swaying for a second to and fro, fell hard across the fender and  against the live bars of the grate. Farrell sprang across the intervening space and swung her head  away from the angry flames. She lay limp and still upon the  hearth-rug, a smear of black streaking her white arm from the  elbow, the smell of her frizzled gown fusing with the odour of  burned hair. Her face was set white, the mouth peaked with a  spasm of pain ; the eyelids had not fully fallen, and a dreadful  glimmer of light flickered from a slit in the unconscious eyes. He  stood, struck weak and silent for a moment, and then flung himself upon the floor, and hung over the body. " Letty, Letty ! " he cried. " Letty, Letty ! Oh, my God !  have I killed you ? " The flesh twitched upon the drawn face, and  a moan issued from her lips. Farrell leapt to the bell-rope and  pulled fast ; and away in some distant depth the peals jangled in  alarm. A servant threw open the door and rushed into the room. " A doctor, a doctor ! " cried Farrell, vehemently. " Get a  doctor at once. Your mistress is ill. Do you hear, Jackson.  God, man, don't stare at me. Go, go ! " As the door closed Farrell's glance stole back to the floor. His  breath came fast as he contemplated the body. It lay there as  though flung by the hand of death, and wore a pitiful aspect. It  forbade him ; it seemed to lower at him ; he could not associate it  with life, still less with Letty. It owned some separate and  horrible existence of itself. The flames mounting in the fire  threw out great flashes upon the recumbent figure, and the pale flesh took on a moving colour. Hours seem to pass as he  stood beside her, and not until the quivering eyelids denoted a  return of life did he gain courage to touch her. With that  she became somehow familiar again ; she was no more the blank  eidolon of a woman. He put his arms beneath her and slowly lifted The Yellow Book--Vol. IV.  E 70  The House of Shame lifted the reviving body to the sofa. The blood renewed its  course in the arteries, and she opened her eyes dully and closed  them again. The entrance of the doctor dispelled for a while the gloomy  thoughts that environed him. The man was a stranger, but was  welcomed as an intimate. " She has had a shock," said Farrell. " You will understand.  It was my doing," he added. The sharp change from the dreadful reveries of his solitude  turned Farrell to a different creature. He was animated with  action ; he bustled about on errands ; he ran for brandy, and his  legs bore him everywhere, hardly with his knowledge. And as  the examination proceeded he grew strangely cheerful, watching  the face of the physician and drawing inferences to his fancy. He  laughed lightly at the doubt if she could be lifted to her room. " Yes, of course," said he. " The stairs are steep, sir," said Letty's maid. He smiled, and drew back the cuffs from his strong wrists.  Stooping, he picked up his wife lightly, and strode upstairs. As the doctor was leaving, Farrell waylaid him in the hall,  and took him to the door. The visitor drew on his gloves and  spoke of the weather ; the sky threatened rain again and the night  was growing black. Farrell agreed with him hurriedly, adding a  few remarks of no interest, as though to preserve that air of un-  concern which the doctor seemed to take for granted ; and then,  with his hand on the door, abruptly touched his subject. " Is there any danger ? " he asked. The doctor paused and buttoned his glove. " She is very sensitive," said the doctor. " It was my doing," said Farrell after a moment, dropping his  eyes to the floor. " It By H. B. Marriott Watson  71 " It is a dangerous time," said the doctor. " Very little may  do damage. We can't be too careful in these affairs." He finished with his gloves, and put out his hand. " Have I," stammered Farrell, " have I done irreparable  harm ? " " She is very delicate," said the doctor. " What will it mean ? " asked the husband, lowering his voice. The doctor smiled and touched him with his fingers. " If you  were to cut your finger, my friend, a doctor would never prophesy.  Events are out of all proportions to causes." He put his own  hand upon the latch. " I will call to-morrow early," he said,  " and will send a nurse at once." Farrell took his arm in a hard grip. " Is she dying ? " he asked hoarsely. The doctor moved impatiently. " My dear sir, certainly not,"  he answered hastily. He threw open the door and emerged into  the night. " I would not distress myself with unnecessary fancies,  Mr. Farrell," said he, as he dropped down the steps. Farrell walked down the hall to the foot of the stairs. He laid a  hand upon the balustrade uncertainly. The house was engrossed in  silence ; then from the floor above came a sharp cry, as of a  creature in pain, and a door shut softly. Trembling, he rushed  into the dining-room, and hid his face in his hands. Yet that  weak device was no refuge from his hideous thoughts. His  brain was crowded with fears and terrors ; in the solitude of that chamber he was haunted by frightful ghosts. The things stood  upon the white cloth, like spectres ; the lamp burned low, and  splashes of flame rose and fell in the ashes. He rose and poured  some brandy into a glass. The muscles jumped in his hands, and  the liquor spilled over the edges and stained his shirt, but the  draught strung up his nerves, and brighter thoughts flowed in his mind. 72  The House of Shame mind. He pulled out a chair before the fire and sat down,  meditating more quietly. An hour later he was disturbed from his reflections by the  passage of feet along the hall. His ears took in the sound with  a fret of new anxiety ; it portended fresh horrors to him. But  in a little he realised from the voices without that the nurse had  arrived, and a feeling of relief pervaded him. The footsteps  passed upstairs. He sat passive within the arms of his chair and  listened. A fresh hope of succour lay in those feet. The doctor and the nurse and the maid were doing what was vital ; in their  attentions was the promise of rescue. It was as if he himself  took no part in the tragedy ; he sat as a spectator in the stalls,  and viewed the action only with the concern of an interested  visitor. He filled another tumbler with spirit. The alcohol fired his blood, and raised him superior to the petty  worry of his nerves. He drank and stared in the embers and con-  sidered. Letty was ill in a manner not uncommon ; even though  it threatened the sacrifice of one life the malady was not inevitably  mortal. He had been bidden to discharge his fears, and brandy  had discharged them for him. He turned to fill his glass again ;  the fumes were in his head, but at that moment the recollection  of his last excess flashed suddenly upon him, and, with an inarticu-  late scream of rage, he dashed the bottle to the floor, and ground  the glass under his feet. Rising irresolutely he made his way up-  stairs, and paused before Letty's door. At his knock the nurse came out and greeted him--a strange tall woman with hard  eyes. " My wife," he asked--" is Mrs. Farrell better ? " She pushed him gently away. " I think so," she said ; " we shall  see. The worst is over, perhaps. You understand. Hush, she is  sleeping now at last." He lingered still, and she made a gesture to By H. B. Marriott Watson  73 to dismiss him, her voice softening. " Doctor Green will tell  you best to-morrow." Farrell entered his room and took off his coat. His ears, grown  delicate to the merest suspicion, seemed to catch a sound upon  the stillness, and opening the door he looked out. All was quiet ;  the great lamp upon the landing swung noiselessly, shedding its  dim beams upon the pannelled walls. He shut to the door, and  once more was in the wilderness of his own thoughts. The doctor came twice that next day. In the morning a white  and anxious face met him on the stairs and scanned him eagerly. " She is going on, going on " said he deliberately. " Then the danger is past ? " cried Farrell, his heart beating  with new vigour. " No doctor can say that," said the doctor slowly. " She is as  well as I expected to find her. It was very difficult." " But will she--" began Farrell, stammering. " Well ? " exclaimed the doctor sharply. " Will she live ? " The doctor's eye avoided his. " Those things are never certain,"  he said. " You must hope. I know more than you, and I  hope." " Yes, yes," cried Farrell impatiently. " But, my God, doctor,"  he burst forth, " will she die ? " The doctor glanced at him and then away. " It is possible,"  he said gravely. Farrell leaned back against the handrail and mechanically  watched him pass the length of the hall and let himself out. Some  one touched his arm, and he looked up. " Come, sir, come," said the nurse. " You musn't give way.  Nothing has happened. She is very weak, but I've seen weaker  folk pull through." He 74  The House of Shame He descended the stairs and entered the drawing-room. The  room looked vacant ; the inanimate furniture seemed to keep silence  and stare at him ; he felt every object in that place was privy to  his horrible story. They regarded him sternly ; he seemed to  feel the hush in which they had talked together, ere he entered.  He could not bear the condemnation of that silence, and sat  down at the piano, softly fingering the notes. But the voices of those chords cried to him of Letty. It was her favourite instru-  ment, the purchase of her own means, and every resonance  reminded him of her. It was by her hand that melodies had been  framed and fashioned from the strings ; his was an alien touch.  They wept for their mistress underneath his fingers ; he struck at  random, and melancholy cadences mourned at him. They knew  his secret, too. With a horrid, miserable laugh he got up, and putting on his hat, went forth and down to his club. The change did not distract his thoughts ; the burden lay as  heavy upon his mind, but at least the walk was an occupation.  He came back with a bundle of letters which his indolent nature  had allowed to accumulate with the porter, and, retiring to his  smoking-room, made a manful effort to re-engage his attention.  With this work and the hour of lunch, the time passed until the  doctor's second visit. He heard the arrival, and, putting down his  pen, waited in a growing fever for the sound of feet descending on  the stairs. The smoking-room lay back from the hall, but  Farrell flung open his door and listened. The day was falling in  and the shadows were deepening about him, but still the doctor  made no sign. At length he left his chair and called Jackson.  The doctor had gone. He must have left without noise, for  Jackson had not heard him ; it was a maid who had seen  him go. The discovery threw Farrell into fresh agitation ; his anger mingled with terror. He had wanted a report of the illness ; he By H. B. Marriott Watson  75 he would have the doctor back at once ; he had a thousand ques-  tions to put. Rushing up the stairs he rapped at the door of the  sick room, softly and feverishly. When the nurse presented her-  self he burst out impetuously. He must come in ; he would see  his wife ; he was persistently held in ignorance of her condition,  and he demanded admittance as a right. The nurse stood aside  and beckoned him forward without a word. Her face was set  harder than ever ; she looked worn and weary. Farrell entered softly, and with furtive fears. " You may stay if you will be still," said the nurse. Farrell  looked at her inquiringly, beseechingly. " No," she added, " you  will not disturb her. She has been put to sleep. She suffered a  good deal. It is a bad case." " Will she live ? " whispered Farrell. The nurse shook her head. " She will not suffer much more.  She will sleep. But the doctor will come in the morning. We  have done everything." Farrell shuddered, and drew near the bed. The lamp burned  low upon the dressing-table, and the chamber was in a soft  twilight. He could not see her face, but her dark hair was  scattered over the white pillows. A slow slight breathing filled  the room. The window rattled with a passing noise. Farrell sat  down upon a chair beyond the bed, and the nurse resumed her  place by the fire, warming her hands. Outside, the traffic passed with low and distant rumbling. * * * * * At the sound the nurse stole stealthily to the door and  opened it. " It is your dinner," she whispered, turning to Farrell.  He shook his head. " I will stay here," said he in a monotone. " You had better go," she urged. " You will want it. You can 76  The House of Shame can do nothing." He shook his head again, impatiently. She  yawned, closed the door, and, with a little sigh of weariness,  retraced her steps to the hearth. Farrell rose and followed her. " Come," he said, bending over her, " you are very tired. Go  and rest in the next room. There is nothing to be done. I will  call you. Let me watch. I wish it." She looked at him in  doubt. " Yes, yes," he pleaded. " Don't you see ? I must be  here, and you want sleep." She glanced round the room, as if to assure herself that there  was nothing to require her. " Very well," she assented ; " but call me soon." And she  vanished through the doorway like a wraith. Farrell took his seat and regarded his wife. The breathing came  gently ; masses of dark hair swarmed over the head that  crouched low upon the pillow ; one arm, crossing the face with  shadow, lay reaching toward the brow. The room glowed with a  luminous gloom rather than with light. The figure rested upon its  side, and the soft rise of the hip stood out from the hollows of the  coverlet. In the grate the ashes stirred and clinked ; the street mumbled without; but within that chamber the stillness hung heavily. Farrell seemed to hear it deepen, and the quiet air spoke louder to  him, as though charged with some secret and mysterious mission.  He followed the hush with a mind half-vacant and wholly irrele-  vant. But presently the faintest rustle came with a roar upon his  senses, and he sprang to his feet, stricken with sudden terror.  The body moved slightly under its wrappings ; the arm dropped  slowly down the pillow into the darker hollows of the counter-  pane ; the hair fell away ; and the face, relapsing, softly edged  into the twilight. Farrell stood staring, mute and distracted, upon this piteous  piece of poor humanity. Its contrast with the woman he had known By H. B. Marriott Watson  77 known and loved appalled him. His jaw fell open, his nails  scored into his palms, his eyes bulged beneath his brows. The  face rested, white and withered, among the frillings of her gown ;  unaccustomed lines picked out the cheeks ; the mouth was  drawn pitifully small and pinched with suffering. Even as he  looked she seemed to his scared gaze to shrink and shrivel under  pain. This was not the repose of sleep, releasing from the  burden of sickness ; surely he could see her face and body pricked over with starts and pangs under his eyes. It seemed to his  morbid thoughts that he could read upon her moving features  the horrible story of that slow disintegration ; in his very sight  the flesh appeared to take on the changing colours of decay. He  withdrew aghast from the proximity ; he blanched and was wrung  with panic. In what place within that breathing human fabric  was death starting upon his dreadful round ? She respired gently,  the heart beat softly, the tissues, yet instinct with life, were re-  builded piece by piece. Wherein lay the secret of that fading life ? The counterpane stirred faintly, and drew his attention. His  wandering glance went down the length of that swathed body.  The limbs still beat warm with blood, and yet to-morrow they  must stretch out in stiff obedience to strange hands. The fancy  was horrible--a cry burst from him and rang in the still and  changeless chamber. The sound terrified him anew, breaking thus  rudely upon the silence. He feared that she would awake, and  he trembled at the prospect of her speechless eyes. And yet he  had withal a passionate desire to resolve her from this deathly calm,  and to see her once more regarding him with love. She hung  still upon the verge of that great darkness, and one short call  would bring her sharply back. He had but to bend to her ears  and whisper loudly, and that hovering spirit would return. He  stood, a coward, by the bed. And 78  The House of Shame And now the lips in that shrunken face parted suddenly, the  bosom quickened, and the throat rattled with noises. It flashed  upon him that this at last was the article of death, and vainly he  strove to call for help ; his voice stifled in his mouth. She  should not so dissolve at least ; she should breathe freely ; he  would give her air--and, springing with an effort to the window,  he flung it back. The cool air flowed in, and, turning quickly, he  looked down upon the bed. The eyes had fallen open, and were set upon him, full and wide.  Unnerved already as he was, the change paralysed him, and he  stood for a moment stark and motionless. The fire flared up and  lit the face with colour ; the eyes shone brightly, and he seemed  to see into their deepest corners. There was that in them  from which he recoiled at length slowly and with horror. They  fastened upon him mutely, pleading with him for mercy. They  were like the eyes of a creature hunted beyond a prospect of  defence. Dumbly they dwelt on him, as though in his presence  they had surrendered their last hope. They seemed to wait for  him, submissive to their fate, yet luminous with that despair.  He tried to speak, but the wheels of his being were without his  present rule, and he might only stand and shudder and give back  glance for glance. He looked away, but his fascinated gaze returned again to those reproaching eyes. They did not waver ;  it was as if they dared not lose their sight of a pitiless enemy. They  recognised him as their butcher. Even through her sleep this  poor weary soul had come to understand his proximity, and had  woke up, in fright at his unseemly neighbourhood. The lamp sputtered, a tongue of flame shot up the chimney,  and the rank smell of smoke stole through the room. Farrell  retreated to the table, and dressed the wick with trembling fingers.  The act relieved the strain, but when he turned the eyes were watch- ing By H. B. Marriott Watson  79 ing still. They bereaved him of his powers, and under the spell of  their strange and horrible attraction he sweated in cold beads.  They burned upon him from the distance, two great hollows of  light, like shining stars, holding that awful look of wistful fear.  There was no room in his mind for any sensation save the one ;  he could not think ; he had no reckoning of the time his agony  endured. But outside, at last, the bell of a clock-tower boomed  far away and some hour was struck. And suddenly it seemed  to him that the lustre of those great eyes grew dimmer ; the look  of sad expectation died slowly away. They stared with a kinder  light. It was his fancy, perhaps, but at least it seemed that  no strange creature now regarded him with unfamiliar terror, but  his own dear Letty watched him again with soft affectionate eyes.  His limbs grew laxer under him, and, with a little sob of relief,  he stole forward, an uncertain smile of greeting growing round his  mouth. " Letty " he whispered, " my darling, are you better ? " He drew near the bed, and put out his arm eagerly and  gently ; but in an instant a start rose quickly in her face, the  eyes kindled with a horrible look of panic, and with a faint  repulsive gesture of the hands she shrank deeper into the wrap-  pings. A little sigh followed ; the limbs fell slowly back, and  the eyes, with their dreadful terror, stared vacantly into Farrell's  ghastly face. The coverlet went on rustling as the bed-clothes settled down. Three Pictures By Walter Sickert I. Hôtel Royal, Dieppe II. Bodley Heads. No. I: Mr. Richard Le Gallienne III. Portrait of George Moore Rondeaux d'Amour By Dolf Wyllarde I BEFORE the night come, and the day expire, The blossoms redden with the sun's desire-- Only the passion-flowers are colourless, Burnt up and wasted with their own excess, And tinted like the ashes of their fire. Look down and see the reddest rose aspire To touch your hand--he climbs the trellis-wire, Burning to reach your indolent caress, Before the night. Ah, Love, be wise ! for all too soon we tire, When once the longed-for guerdon we acquire. The wonder that we think not to possess, Once in our keeping, holds us less and less. Nay--let us love, nor all too much inquire, Before the night. During 88  Rondeaux d'Amour II During the night I felt you breathing deep Against my heart--and yet I did not weep With perfect passion !--fearing only this, One golden moment of the night to miss-- The sacred night that was not made for sleep ! The stairs of life stretch upward, dim and steep, Midway between a grief and joy I creep-- But let us just for once have tasted bliss, During the night. Strained to my breast I felt your pulses leap, And this is the remembrance I shall keep When all the serpents of oblivion hiss-- Of two who only clung too close to kiss. We sowed in love--in passion do we reap, During the night. III After the night Love wearied of his powers, He fell asleep among the passion-flowers. I felt the darkness solemnly withdrawn. A dewy whiteness glimmered on the lawn, Day weeping for this dear dead night of ours. Vague By Dolf Wyllarde  89 Vague, greyish lights, that  had threatened showers, Deepened to golden, till the rosy hours Trembled with tender passion to the dawn, After the night. Wan in the daylight looked our crystal towers, Rising above the blossom-tinted bowers. The world looked strangely on us in the morn. Love shuddered in his sleep as one forsworn-- Poor Love ! who trembles at himself, and cowers, After the night. Wladlislaw's Advent By   Ménie Muriel Dowie I WHEN I  saw Wladislaw he was sitting on a high tabouret  near a hot iron sheet that partially surrounded  the tall coke stove ; the arches of his feet were curved over the  top bar, toes and heels both bent down, suggestive of a bird clasping its perch. This position brought the shiny knees of his  old blue serge trousers close up to his chest--for he was bending  far forward towards his easel--and the charcoal dust on the knee  over which he occasionally sharpened his  fusain  was making a dull smear upon the grey flannel shirt which his half-opened  waistcoat exposed. He wore no coat : it was hanging on the edge of the iron  screen, and his right shirt-sleeve, rolled up for freedom in his  work, left a strong, rather smooth arm bare. He always chose a corner near the stove ; the coke fumes never  gave him a headache, it seemed. It was supposed that he felt the  cold of Paris severely ; but this can hardly have been the case,  considering the toughening winters of his youth away in Poland  there. My observation led me to believe that the proximity was  courted on account of the facilities it afforded for lighting his cigarette By Ménie Muriel Dowie  91 cigarette. When he rolled a new one and had returned the flat,  shabby, red leather case to a pocket, he would get up, open the  stove door and pick up a piece of coke--one whose lower half was  scarlet and its upper still black--between his finger and thumb,  and, holding it calmly to the cigarette, suck in a light with a  single inhalation, tossing the coke to its place and re-seating him-  self upon his tabouret, completely unaware of the amused pairs of  eyes that watched quizzically to see his brow pucker if he burnt  himself. Wladislaw was his  name ; naturally he had another by  which he was generally known, but it is useless to record a  second set of Polish syllables for the reader to struggle with, so I  leave it alone. His name is pronounced Vladislav as nearly  as one may write it ; and this is to be remembered, for I prefer  to retain the correct spelling. He had been working quite a  fortnight in the studio before the day when I strolled in and  noticed him, and I do not think that up till then any one had the excitement of his acquaintance. One or two sketch-books contained hasty and furtive pencil  splashes which essayed the picturesqueness of his features ; but he  was notably shy, and if he observed any one to be regarding him  with the unmistakable measuring eye of the sketcher, he would  frown and dip behind the canvas on his easel with the silly  sensitiveness of a dabchick. At the dingy  crèmerie  where he ate  herrings  marinés --chiefly with a knife--the curious glances of  other  déjeuneurs  annoyed him extremely ; which was absurd, of  course, for as a rule no artist objects to being made the victim of a  brother's brush. He would colour--I was going to write, like a  girl, but why not like the boy that he was ?--when the lively  Louise, who changed the plates, or swept the knife and fork of such as did not know the habits of the place back on the crumby marble The Yellow Book-- Vol. IV.  F 92  Wladislaw's Advent marble table with a " V'lá M'sieu," sent a smile accurately  darted into his long eyes. He didn't know how to respond to  Louise, or any other glances of the same sort in those days ; but if  I am encouraged to tell further of him, I can give the history of  his initiation, for I am bold to say none knows it better--unless  it be Louise herself. What puzzled me about his face, which was a beautiful one, of  the pure and refined Hebrew type so rarely met with-- the type  that was a little commoner, let us hope, in the days when God  singled out His People--what puzzled me about it was that it  should seem so familiar to me, for, as I say, the type is seldom  found. When I came upon Wladislaw, hurrying down the  street to the studio with the swiftness of a polecat--no sort of  joke intended--it would flash upon me that surely I knew the  face, yet not as one feels when one has met some one in a train  or sat near him in a tramcar. The mystery of this was explained before ever I had analysed to  myself exactly how the face affected me and where I could have  seen it before. It was at the eleven o'clock rest one morning,  when the strife of tongues was let loose and I was moving among  the easels and stools, talking to the various students that I knew.  One of them, her book open, her eyes gleaming and her pencil  avid of sketches, was lending a vague ear to the model, who had  once been in England, and was describing his experiences with a Royal Academician. They were standing near the stove, the  model, careless of the rapid alteration which the grateful heat was  effecting in his skin tones, steadily veering from the transparent  purple which had gratified an ardent impressionist all the morning,  to a dull, hot scarlet upon the fronts of his thighs. While she  was talking to the model, my friend was sketching Wladislaw,  who ranged remotely at the cold end of the room. The impres- sionist By Ménie Muriel Dowie  93 sionist joined the group to remonstrate in ineffectual French with  the model, and glanced into the sketch-book in passing. " Just the church-window type, isn't he ? " said this flippant  person, alluding to the Pole; " and I have seen him behind the  altar too, painted on the wall with a symmetrical arrangement of  stars in the background, and his feet on a blue air-balloon." The sketcher nodded, and swept in a curved line for the coat  collar just as a controlling voice announced that the rest was up. And I wondered how I had been so dull as never to think of  it ; for it was perfectly true, and oh, so obvious now that I knew  it ! Wladislaw's beautiful head, with the young light-brown  beard, the pure forehead, and the long sorrowful eyes, was an ideal  presentment of the Nazarene ; without the alteration of either  feature or expression, he stood up a gloriously simple realisation of  the Christ as all pictures have tried to show Him. I was so amazed by this illumination, that I sat down beside  the disconsolate impressionist, who " couldn't do a thing till that  idiot cooled down," and was " losing half the morning--the  Professor's morning, too," and talked it over. " H'm yes--he is. Hadn't you noticed it ? I said it the very  day he came in. I wonder if he sees it himself? Do you know,  I think I could get rather a good thing of him from here ? Yes,  you wait ; I've nothing to do till that beastly hectic colour fades  off the model. I'm not going to bother about the background ;  I've painted that old green curtain till I'm tired. Get a tabouret  and sit down while I design a really good window." She sketched away rapidly, and I watched her as she worked. " Funny," she remarked, as she blocked in the figure with  admirable freedom ; " I've never seen the Christ treated in profile,  have you ? It's rather new--you watch." It is my regret that I did not disregard every rule and every courtesy 94  Wladislaw's Advent courtesy and snatch that sketch from her, half-finished though it  was ; but of a sudden the door opened and the Professor came in.  The impressionist, with a sour look at the model's thighs and a  despairing consciousness that she would have to hear that her  colour was too cold, shut her book with a snap and resumed her  brushes. I had to manoeuvre cautiously a retreat to the stairway--for  idlers were publicly discouraged during the Professor's visits--and  people who would leave off work at any minute when I dropped  in to hear the news on ordinary mornings, looked up and frowned  studiously over the creaking of my retreating boots. It may have been about a week later that my acquaintance  with Wladislaw commenced, and again the detailing of that cir-  cumstance is to serve another purpose one of these days ; at any  rate, we came across one another in a manner which is to a friend-  ship what a glass frame is to a cucumber, and soon studio friends  came to me for news of him, and my protection of him was an  openly admitted fact. At  I had been somewhat burdened by  a consciousness of his curious beauty ; one is not often in the way of talking to a beautiful man of any kind, but I can imagine that  classical beauty or historic beauty might be more easily sup-  ported. No particular deep would be touched by a meeting with  Apollo or Antinous ; neither awe, nor reverence, however dis-  credited and worn-out its tradition, has ever attached to them.  The counterpart of Montrose or the bonnie Earl o' Murray,  much as one would like to meet either, would arouse only picturesque sentimental reflection ; but to walk through the  Jardin du Luxembourg on a sunny day eating  gaufres , with--and  I say it without the faintest intention of irreverence--with a  figure of the Saviour of mankind beside you, is--is arresting.  When the eye reposes unintentionally upon it in the silent moments By Ménie Muriel Dowie  95 moments of conversation, it gives pause. Distinctly, it gives  pause. I have never held it an excuse for anything in art or  literature that one should turn upon a public about to scoff, to be  offended, to be frightened, and announce that " it is true " : that  the incident in either a picture or a story should be "true" is not  a sufficient excuse for the painting or the telling of it. But when  I insist courteously to readers of certain religious convictions that  I am not " making up " either my scenes, my characters, or what,  for want of a better name, shall be called my story, I am only  desirous that they shall absolve me from any desire to be irreverent  and to shock their feelings. They might remember that what is  reverent to them may not be so to me ; but I do not hope to  secure so great a concession by any means. What I would  finally point out is that the irreverence goes back further than the  mere writing down of the story ; they must accuse a greater than  I if they object to the facts of the case--they must state their  quarrel to the controlling power which designed poor Wladislaw's  physiognomy : to use some of the phrases beloved of the very  class I am entreating, I would suggest that the boy did not  " make himself " ; he was " sent into the world " like that. I daresay--considering what I am going to relate--I daresay he wished he had not been ; he was so very shy a fellow, and it led  to his being a great deal observed and commented upon. What  encouraged me to feel at home with him in spite of his appearance  was the real youngness of his nature. He was extraordinarily  simple and--well, fluffy. For he really suggested a newly-  hatched chicken to me ; bits of the eggshell were still clinging to  his yellow down, if I may hint at the metaphor. His cleverness was tremendously in advance of his training and  his executive powers. Some day, one could see, he was  going  to paint marvellously, if he would wait and survive his failures and forbear 96  Wladislaw's Advent forbear to cut his throat by the way. His mind was utterly and  entirely on his work ; I never heard him speak of much else ;  work and the difficulty of producing oneself, no matter with the  help of what medium, was our everyday topic. And when  desperate fits overtook us we bewailed the necessity of producing  ourselves at all. Why was it in us ? We didn't think anything  good that we did ; we didn't suppose we were ever going to compass anything decent, and work was a trouble, a fever of  disappointment and stress, which we did not enjoy in the least.  The pleasure of work, we assured one another again and again,  was a pleasure we had never felt. By nature, inclination and  habit we were incorrigibly idle ; yet inside us was this spirit, this  silly, useless, hammering beast that impelled us to the handling of  pen and pencil, and made us sick and irritable and unhappy, and  prevented us taking any pleasure in our dinner. That was how we used to talk together when we were striding  through the woods round Versailles or idling among storied tombs  in the cemetery at Montmorency ; and, dear me ! what a lot of  enjoyment we got out of it, and how good the sandwiches were  when we rested for our luncheon ! Sometimes Wladislaw talked  of his mother, whom I apprehended to be a teak-grained Calvinistic  lady with a certain resemblance to the hen who had reared a  duckling by mistake. I wish now that I had heard more stories  of that rigorous household of his youth, where the fires in winter  were let out at four in the afternoon because his mother had the  idea that one did not feel the cold so much in bed if inured to it  by a sustained chill of some eight hours' duration. She was  probably quite right : one only wonders why she did not pursue  the principle further and light no fires in the day, because pro-  portionately, of course---- But no matter. And, indeed, there  are no proportions in the case. Once reach the superlative frozen, By Ménie Muriel Dowie  97 frozen, and there is nothing left to feel. His  subject was the frivolity of Paris, of which we knew everything by hearsay and  nothing by experience, so were able to discuss with a " wet sheet  and a flowing sea," so to speak. He hated Paris, and he hated  frivolity, even as he hated French. Our conversations, I ought  to say, were carried on in German, which we spoke with almost a  common measure of inaccuracy ; and I think that he probably  knew as little of the French language as he knew of the frivolity  of Paris. I tried to encourage him to take long walks and long tours on tramways--it should never be forgotten that you can go all over  Paris for threepence--and when his work at the studio was  sufficiently discouraging he would do so, sometimes coming with  me, sometimes going alone. We explored Montmartre together,  both by day and gas light ; we fared forth to the Abattoirs, to  the Place de la Roquette, to the Boulevard Beaumarchais and the  Boulevard Port Royal, the Temple and " les Halles." But Wladislaw was alone the day he set out to inspect the Bois  de Boulogne, the Pare Monceau, the Madeleine, and the  grands Boulevards . I remember seeing him start. If he had been coming with me  he would have had on a tie and collar (borrowed from another  student) and his other coat ; he would, in fact, have done his best  to look ordinary, to rob himself, in his youthful pride and ignorant  vanity, of his picturesque appearance. I am sorry to say it, since  he was an artist ; but it is true--he would. As it was, he sallied out in the grey woollen shirt, with its  low collar, the half-buttoned waistcoat, the old, blue, sloppily-  hanging coat, with one sleeve obstinately burst at the back, and  the close astrakhan cap on one side of his smooth straight hazel  hair. When I ran across him next day in the neighbourhood of the 98  Wladislaw's Advent the oleander tubs that surrounded with much decorative ability  the doors of the Café Amadou, he agreed to come to my rooms  and have a cup of coffee, in order to narrate the exciting and  mysterious incident of the day before. Sitting on each side of my stove, which was red-hot and threat-  ening to crack at any minute, Wladislaw, with cautions to me  " not to judge too soon : I should see if it had not been strange,  this that had happened to him," told me this ridiculous story. He had started up the Bois ; he had found the Pare Monceau ;  he had come down a big street to the Madeleine ; he had looked  in ; it had reminded him of a concert-hall, and was not at all  impressive ( gar nicht imponirend ) ; he had walked along the left-  hand side of the Boulevard des Capucines. It was as poor a  street as he could have imagined in a big town, the shops  wretched ; he supposed in London our shops were better ? I  assured him that in London the shops were much better ; that it  was a standing mystery to me, as to all the other English women  I knew, where the pretty things for which Paris is celebrated were to be bought. And I implored him to tell me his adven-  ture. Ah ! Well--now the point was reached ; now I was to hear !  One minute !--Well, he had come opposite the Café de la Paix,  and he had paused an instant to contemplate the unrelieved  commonplace ugliness of the average Frenchman as there to be  observed--and then he had pursued his way. It was getting dusk in the winter afternoon, and when he came  through the Place de l'Opéra all the lights were lit, and he was  delighted, as who must not be, by the effect of that particular bit  of Paris ? He was just crossing the Place to go down the left-  hand side of the Avenue, when it occurred to him that he was  being followed. It By Ménie Muriel Dowie  99 It here struck me that the beginning of Wladislaw's   adventure in Paris was highly unoriginal ; but I waited with a  tempered interest to hear how he had dealt with it. Here are his  own words, but losing much of their quaintness by being rendered  in an English which even I cannot make quite ungrammatical. " I went on very quickly a little way, then I walked slowly, slowly--very slow, and turned suddenly sharp round. Yes, I was  being followed : there he was, a man in a black frock coat, and----" " A man ? " I blurted out, having been somehow unprepared  for this development. "What else ? " said Wladislaw. " Did you think it was going  to be a cat ? " Well, more or less, I  had  fancied .... but I wouldn't in-  terrupt him. " Black coat and grey trousers, black bow tie and one of those  hats, you know ? " With his cigarette hand he made a rapid  pantomime about his head that outlined sufficiently the flat-  brimmed top hat of the artistic Frenchman, so often distinguished,  but more usually a little ridiculous. " I went on at an ordinary pace till I came to the Rue de  Rivoli, then at that Café where the omnibus for St. Sulpice stops  I waited "--Wladislaw's eyes were gleaming with an unwonted  mischief, and he had quite lost his Judaic majesty--" to get a  good look. There he was. A man not yet forty ; dark, interest-  ing, powerful face ; a red ribbon in his button-hole." " A red ribbon? " But then I remembered that every second  Frenchman has a red ribbon. " I thought, ' Shall I take him a nice walk this cold evening ?  Shall I go down and cross the river to Notre Dame, then home  up the Boulevard St. Michel ? ' But no, it was late. I had had nothing 100  Wladislaw's Advent nothing to eat ; I wanted to get to the Bouillon Robert before  dinner would be over. I ran into the Bureau and got a number ;  then I watched, and the omnibus that had room I climbed up  on the  impériale  and  watched him try for a seat inside !  Ah, I  knew he was after me. I felt as if I had stolen something !  Then the omnibus started. He had not got a seat. When it is  already six you cannot get a seat inside, you know ? " I knew. " He came up with you ? " I said. " On the  impériale  also there was no room. I lost sight of  him, but on the Pont du Carrousel I saw a  fiacre  ! " In spite of my earlier feeling I was a little interested , more so  when Wladislaw told of his walking into a certain restaurant near  the Gare Montparnasse--a restaurant where you dine with  hors  d'oeuvres  and dessert at a scoured wood table for 80 centimes,  sitting down beside several  ouvriers --and seeing the stranger  saunter in and take a seat at a corner table. I feel quite incapable of rendering in English the cat-and-  mouse description of the dinner which Wladislaw gave me ; so  I come to the time when he paid his  addition , and turning up his coat collar, made his way out and up the Boulevard Montparnasse  in the ill-lighted winter night, the stranger appearing inevitably in  his wake at each gas-lamp, till the side street was reached in which  Wladislaw lived on the  floor of a certain number thirteen.  At his door Wladislaw, of course, paused, and looked the street up  and down without seeing his pursuer. " But no doubt," said my sly Pole, " he was hiding inside a  courtyard door. And now, what do you make of that ? " I had to own that I made nothing of it ; and we sat and  speculated foolishly for fully half an hour, till we tired of the effort  and returned to our equally vapid haverings about " work " and  our common difficulties. Four By Ménie Muriel Dowie  101 Four days later--I had meantime confided the story to no one-- four days later Wladislaw approached me mysteriously from  behind as I was returning one morning from a visit to the Rue  de la Gaieté, with a bunch of onions, half a loaf of black bread,  and two turkey-thighs in a string bag. I knew from the set of his cap that something unusual had  happened ; and besides, it was the hour at which he should have  been scraping at his  fusain  in the men's studio. He put a letter  in my hand. " You will say nothing to anybody? I want you to translate  it. I can't understand it all. But you will tell no one ? " I responded with an eager denial and the question as to who  there could be for me to tell. He seemed to overlook the half-hundred of students we both  knew, as readily as I did ; and we opened the letter. This was it : " Monsieur,--My name may perhaps be a sufficient assurance to you  that my unusual conduct of the other evening in discovering for  myself your residence and profession had no unworthy motive. The  explanation is simple. I am painting a large canvas, to be called  ' The Temptation. ' I cannot proceed for want of a model for my  Christ. When my eyes fell upon you, I realised instantly that yours  was the only face in the world that could satisfy my aspiration. It  was impossible for me not to follow you, at the risk of any and every  misunderstanding. I beg you to receive my complete apologies.  Will you sit to me ? I appeal to you as a brother of the brush--  permit me to leave behind me the most perfect Christ-face that has  ever been conceived. Times and terms shall be as you will. " Accept, Monsieur and colleague, the assurance of my most  distinguished sentiments. " DUFOUR." I looked 102  Wladislaw's Advent I looked at it, laughing and gasping. I repeated some of the  sounding phrases. So this artist--well I knew his name at the Mirlitons--this genius of the small red fleck had pursued Wladis-  law for miles on foot and in fiacre, had submitted himself and his  digestion to an 80-centime dinner of blatant horse-flesh, had tracked  the student to his lodgings, got his style and title from Madame in  the  rez-de-chaussée , and finally written him this letter to ask--to  implore, rather, that Wladislaw should be the model for his con-  templated picture of the Redeemer ! It was really interesting enough ; but what struck me as curious was that Dufour of the  tulle skirt and tarlatan celebrity--the portraitist of the  filles de joie   --should conceive it possible to add to his reputation by painting  the Man of Sorrows. II It will have been gathered that Wladislaw was poor ; just how  poor, I think no one among us ever knew. He would sit all the  evening long without a fire, and his habit of keeping a large piece  of bread in a coat pocket and breaking bits off to nibble during  the morning or afternoon's work very naturally gave rise to a  legend that he lived upon bread alone. I, for one, would sooner believe that to have been the case than  have credited for a moment the story of the student who claimed  to have noticed a heap of fish heads and tails in a corner of his  room, the disagreeable residue of a small barrel of raw dried  herring which he had kept by him. I suppose that he paid his classes and boarding charges out of  money sent at intervals from home, like any other student ; but  the final outward evidence of any shortness in cash was the colour of By Ménie Muriel Dowie  103 of the packet in which he bought his tobacco. A careful observer  might have accurately dated the arrival of his funds by noting the  orange paper which inclosed his " Levant Supérieur." Then, as  it behoved him to be careful, the canary yellow of the cheaper  " Levant " ; and finally the sign manual of approaching destitu-  tion in the common brown wrapper of his " Caporal." I am  inclined to say that I noticed his leisurely but inevitable descent  of these pecuniary steps every month. Further, if moderately affluent, he would indulge in five sous'  worth of roasted chestnuts whenever we went out together, and  only on one occasion did it occur to me to provide him with a  tram fare. Despite this poverty, I am very sure that when he  arranged ultimately, at my instance, to sit to Monsieur Dufour  for his picture of " Christ led up into the Wilderness to be  tempted of the Devil," Wladislaw was very far from thinking of  the remuneration. The fact was, he had differed rather pointedly with a big  Russian at the evening class, a man preternaturally irritable  because eternally afflicted by the toothache ; there had been  words, the Russian had announced his intention of throwing the  Pole from the top of the stairs, and being a taller, more muscular  fellow, had picked him up and carried him to the door, when  Wladislaw wriggled dexterously from his grasp, and jerked him  down no fewer than eleven steps upon his spine. He described to me afterwards with less truth than artistic sympathy the neat bobbing  sound as each individual vertebra knocked upon the wooden  stairs. This incident, and the fact that the Russian had taken an oath  in public to pay his defeat a round dozen of times, served to cool  Wladislaw's interest in the evening class. He told me also that  the light tried his eyes ; and he would come up in the morning with 104  Wladislaw's Advent with a fine vermilion point in their corners, the result, as I  insisted, of his dipping locks of hair. With a choice of reasons for his coming, I was yet surprised  when he came, late one evening, and having whistled the opening  bars of Chopin's " Dirge of Poland " below my seventh-floor  window, decoyed me to the roadway, and described his  visit  to the studio of Dufour in the Rue de Vaugirard. Out of mere curiosity we had wandered to the number, one  afternoon after the reception of the letter ; and I well remembered  the living stench of the impasse , the dead trails of an enterprising Virginia creeper, the broken mass of plaster casts which suffi-  ciently located a young sculptor near at hand, and the cracked  Moorish lamp which lay upon its side in the half-choked drain.  All we had seen of the studio's furnishings was the silk-threaded  back of a magnificent curtain which blocked an upper square of  lights ; but I knew that inside all must be on a much greater  scale of artistic beauty than the queer, draughty barns of art-  student friends, where I often juggled with a cup of tea--tea  produced from a corner shrouded modestly in the green canvas  covering of a French waggon and the dusty, bellying folds of a brown fishing-net. I was now to hear from Wladislaw what the  interior was really like ; how the great Dufour appeared when  seen from the front instead of the rear, so to say, and upon what  terms the negotiations were begun. A certain indecisiveness in Wladislaw's painting was reflected  in his conversation : he never could describe anything. Perhaps  this is to do him an injustice ; I would rather say that he had no  idea of giving a detailed description. By whiles you might get a  flash equivalent to one of his illuminative brush-strokes, which  was very certain to be an unsurpassable appreciation of the fact or  the circumstances ; but bid him begin at the beginning and go coolly By Ménie Muriel Dowie  105 coolly to the end, and you had him useless, flurried, monosyllabic  and distraught. I had early learned this ; so I stood pretty patiently, although  in thin slippers, on our half-made road, a red clay slough by reason  of much carting, and listened to half-intelligible fragments of bad  German, from which I gleaned quite a good deal that I wanted to  know.  of all, it seemed the studio had another door ; one  we had never seen : you made your way round the back of the  sculptor's white powdery habitation, and discovered yourself  opposite a little annexe where the artist kept his untidier  properties, and the glass and china which served for any little  refreshment he might be disposed to take in working hours. The door here had been opened by an untidy, half-dressed French-  woman, with her boots unbuttoned and a good deal of cigarette ash  upon her high-braced bust ; she appeared unaware of Wladislaw's  arrival, for she came to the door to empty something, and he nearly  received the contents of a small enamelled tin thing in his face. A moment later, much shaken by the off-hand insolence of her  remarks, he penetrated to the presence of Dufour himself, and  was agreeably soothed by the painter's reception of him. Of  Dufour's manner and remarks, or the appearance of his workshop,  I could get no idea. He had a canvas, twelve feet by nine, upon  an easel, and it seems he made a rapid  croquis  of his picture upon a  smaller upright, and had a few masterly skirmishes with the  fusain for the position of his Christ's head, begging the model to walk  naturally up and down the studio, so as to expose unconsciously  various attitudes of face. During these saunterings Wladislaw should have come by some  idea of his surroundings ; but he was continually harassed and  distracted by the movements of the woman in the unbuttoned  boots, and seemed to have observed very little. Upon 106  Wladislaw's Advent Upon a high point of an easel was hung a crown of thorns,  and beside this leaned a reed ; but Dufour explained that he had  abandoned that more conventional incident in favour of the  Temptation in the Wilderness, and explained at some length the  treatment that he contemplated of the said Temptation. No-  thing, of course, was to be as it had ever been before ; the  searching light of modern thought, of modern realism, was to be let in upon this old illustration, from which time had worn the  sharpness long ago. " They must feel it ; it must come right down to them--to  their lives ; they must find it in their path as they walk--  irrefutable, terrible--and the experience of any one of them ! "  Dufour had said. " And for that, contrast ! You have here the  simplicity of the figure ; the man, white, assured, tense, un-  assailable. Then, here and there, around and above, the thousand  soft presentments of temptation. And these, though imaginatively  treated, are to be real--real. He was a man ; they say He had a  man's temptations ; but where do we really hear of them ? You will see them in my picture ; all that has ever come to you or  me is to be there. Etherealised, lofty, deified, but . . . our  temptations." " And you see what a subject ? The advantages, the oppor-  tunities ? The melting of the two methods ? The  plein air  for the figure, and all that Art has ever known or imagined outside  this world--everything a painter's brain has ever seen in dreams-- for the surroundings. Is it to be great ? Is it to be final ? Ah,  you shall see ! And yours is the face of all the world for it. You  are a re-incarnation. One moment so. I must have the head trois quarts  with the chin raised." Dufour talked himself to perspiration, so Wladislaw said, and  even I at hand was warmed and elated. Surely By Ménie Muriel Dowie  107 Surely it was a striking achievement. I don't think it occurred  to me then to reflect how large a practice Dufour had had with  the " temptations " realistically treated ; certainly he had a name  for the painting of them which no one could outdo ; and if his  new departure from the direction of gas and limelight to  plein air   went well, there was everything to hope. " And when are you to go again ? " I asked, as I scraped the  clay from my slippers on the wide door mat in our draughty entresol . " Not for three days ; he goes out of town, to Nancy. On  Sunday night I go again, and am to pose in costume. He is to  have me after, every night for a week, while he draws only, to  choose his exact position ; after that, I have to give up some day-  light ; but it won't matter, for I can join the evening class  again for black and white. I have often thought of it, and  meant to." " And you don't think it is going to tire you horribly--stand-  ing and not saying anything ?" " Tire ? Nothing could tire me. I could pose on one leg for  him like a stork, for hours at a time, and never complain." " I don't think it likely that a position of that kind----" I began ; but he struck in : " But not if that woman is about. She makes me nervous.  You should see her hands : they are all white and swollen. When  I ran a thorn in my thumb and it swelled, it went like that--all  dead and cooked-looking." " Don't! " I shouted. " Of course she won't be there. It  isn't likely he would have a servant about when he worked." " She isn't a servant ; she called him ' Toni, ' and she took hold--" " She was a  model ," I said ; and Wladislaw, who was so head- long The Yellow Book--Vol. IV.  G 108  Wladislaw's Advent long because so very young, heard the note of finality in my voice,  and looking puzzled but complaisant, reserved further comment  on the woman in the unbuttoned boots. * * * * * All that follows this, I am unable to tell in Wladislaw's own  words ; the facts were not given me at one, nor yet at two  recitals--they were piled heterogeneously in my mind, just as he  told them at odd moments in the months that followed ; and that  they have arranged themselves with some sort of order is to be  accounted for  of all by their dramatic nature, and secondly by  the inherent habit of my memory, which often straightens and  adjusts, although unbidden, all that is thrown into it, so that I may  take things out neatly as I would have them : thus one may pick articles, ordered in one's absence, from the top left-hand drawer in  a dressing table. At half-past eight upon the Sunday it was a very black night  indeed in the Rue de Vaugirard. Wladislaw had well-nigh fallen  prone over the broken Moorish lamp, now frozen firmly in the  gutter which was the centre of the impasse  ; he had made his way  round by the sculptor's studio, found the door unlocked, and being  of a simple, unquestioning temperament, had strolled into the  untidy, remote little annexe which communicated by a boarded  passage with the handsome  atelier . A small tin lamp of the kind a concierge usually carries, glass-  less, flaming at a cotton wick with  alcoöl à brûler , was withstand-  ing an intermittent buffeting by a wind which knew the best hole  in the window to come in at. Wladislaw nearly lost half of his long light-brown moustache by lighting his cigarette at it in a draught. It was cold, and he had to undress to his skin ; the comfort of a cigarette By Ménie Muriel Dowie  109 a cigarette was not to be denied. Also he was late for his  appointment, and this annoyed him. He picked up the lamp  when he had taken coat and cap off, and searched for the costume  he was to wear. A row of pegs upon the wall offered encouragement. With a  certain awkwardness, which was the result of his shyness of touch-  ing unfamiliar garments, he knocked down two hats--women's  hats : one a great scooped thing with red roses below the rim ;  the other like a dish, with green locusts, horribly lifelike (and no  wonder, since they were the real insects), crawling over it. He  hastily replaced these, and took up a white thing on another nail,  which might have been the scant robe he was to wear. It was a fine and soft to his hand ; it exhaled an ineffable  perfume of a sort of sweetness which belonged to no three-franc  bottle, and had loose lace upon it and ribbons. He dropped this  upon the ground, thinking shudderingly of the woman in the  unbuttoned boots. At last he came upon the garment he was to  wear ; it seemed to him that he knew it at once when he touched  it ; it was of a thick, coarse, resistant woollen fabric, perhaps  mohair, with a dull shine in the rather unwilling folds ; there was  very little stuff in it--just a narrow, poor garment, and of course  white ; wool-white. Wladislaw wondered vaguely where Dufour could have come by this wonderfully archaic material, ascetic  even to the touch. Then he sat down upon a small disused stove  and took off his boots and socks. Still hanging upon the nail was  a rope cord, frayed rather, and of hemp, hand-twisted. That was  the whole costume : the robe and the cord. He was out of his shirt and ready to put on the Hebrew dress,  when he was arrested again by some half-thought in his mind,  and stood looking at it as it lay thrown across a heap of dusty toiles . It seemed so supremely real a thing--just what The Man must 110  Wladislaw's Advent must have worn ; he could imagine the old story more nearly  than ever he had done before. He could see Him, His robes of red or purple laid aside, clothed  only in the white under-garment ; the beautiful purity, the  unimpeachable holiness of Him only the greater to see ; young,  perfect, without sin or soil ; the veritable " Jesus led up of the  Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the Devil." And he himself, Wladislaw, was the true image of that grand  figure as He has come down through all the histories to the eyes  of an indifferent world. When he lifted his hand to his head, bewildered and held by it,  the old blue trousers fell to the ground, and he stood there naked  in the cold, taking his mind back along the familiar lines of the  wonderful story, entering into the feelings of that Jew-Man who  was persecuted ; who, whether man or God, lived the noblest life,  left the finest example--who walks to-day, as He did then, beside  the few who may be called His disciples. A blast that caught the little lamp full in its foul, yellow  flame-tongue, left Wladislaw in the dark. He felt about for  matches ; perhaps no act could have so certainly restored him to  this world, from which his thoughts had wandered. He found  none anywhere. His straying hand came upon the garment ; he  caught it up and slipped it over his head, half horrified to feel that  it came below his collar-bone in the neck, and left his arms with  only half-a-dozen inches of sleeve. Matches were lurking in his trousers pocket, and he had the  sulphury splutter going in a moment and the lamp re-lit. Turning to place it in a quieter corner, he faced a dusty square  of looking-glass, unframed, such as painters usually have, its edges  sunk into the dusty wall ; he had quite a surprise to see himself. More than half fascinated, he made a swift arrangement of his hair, By Ménie Muriel Dowie  111 hair, smoothed the soft flow of his moustache and beard, knotted  the rope cord round his waist, and stood there only a second or  two longer. Then, nerved by the startling simplicity, the con-  vincing faithfulness of his whole appearanee, he opened the door  and went down the passage to the studio, frowning and stepping  gingerly on the cold boards. * * * * * The curious murmur of sounds that struck his ear ; voices, the  music of glasses and silver, the slap, as it might have been a hand  upon a cheek, and the vagrant notes of some untuned musical  instrument--these all he barely noticed, or supposed they came  from the sculptor's adjacent studio. He opened the doorand brushed aside the dark  portière that screened  out draughts ; he stepped into the studio, into a hot, overcharged air,  thick with the flat smell of poured wines and fruit rind, coloured  with smoke, poisoned with scent, ringing harshly to voices--an air  that of itself, and if he had seen nothing, would have nauseated him. He saw dimly, confusedly ; orange and yellow blobs of light  seemed to be swinging behind grey-blue mists that rolled and  eddied round the heads of people so wild, he did not know if he  looked at a dream-picture, a picture in a bad dream. If he made  another step or two and stood, his arms straight at his sides, his  head up, his long eyes glaring beneath drawn perplexed brows, he  did not know it. There was a sudden pause, as though by a chemical process the air had been purged of sounds. Then a  confused yell burst from among the smoke clouds, mixed with  the harsh scrape of chairs shot back upon the floor ; that, too,  ceased, and out of the frozen horror of those halted people,  some incoherent, hysteric whimpering broke out, and a few faint  interrupted exclamations. At a table heaped with the  débris  of a careless feast he saw Dufour, 112  Wladislaw's Advent Dufour, his coat off, his waistcoat and shirt unbuttoned, his head  rolled weakly back upon the gilded wood-scroll of his Louis  Quinze chair : his face flushed and swollen, strangely broadened,  coarsened and undone, with sick, loose expressions rolling over it  as shallow water rolls above a stone ; he had in his hands an old  lute, a studio property, from which he had been picking poor  detached, discordant notes. There were other men, with wild arrested merriment in their  faces, the merriment of licence. Mixed among them, tangling  like the serpents and reptiles in an allegorical picture, were women  of whom the drapery or the bareness seemed indifferently lewd. One had fainted with a glass at her lips, and the splash of  spilled liquor was on her neck and dripping from her chin. No  one heeded her. Another had dashed her head upon the table, her hands were  clutched in her hair, shaking with a palsy of terror ; and from her  arose the sobs which were no more than the dull moaning of a  beast in labour. One other, in a dress all Paris would have recognised as being  the orange ballet-muslins in which Dufour had painted his  celebrated " Coquelicot," was lying with long white arms spread  on the back of a chair ; above her low black satin bodice the  waves of her dead-white breast were heaving convulsively ; her  red hair blazed from under the live fantastic orange-poppy horns  that spread out from her head ; her clever, common little face was  twitching to recover a vinous courage, the black eyes were blinking,  the crooked lines of her mouth--more fascinating than any  fancied bow-curve--were moving in irresponsible striving to open  on one side, as they had a habit of doing, and let out some daring  phrase. All that they saw, these miserable revellers, was the white figure By Ménie Muriel Dowie  113 figure of the Christ standing in the chastened light at the far end  of the studio. There had been a slight rattling sound--a curtain  had been drawn, and then the beautiful form had stepped out and  stood before them--the very type of manhood Christ had chosen,  if pictures may be trusted, when He came to this earth : the pure  forehead, the patient sorrowful eyes, reproach in the expression of  the eyebrows and the mouth, the young beard and brown soft  hair--in a word, the Nazarene. When Dufour raised a wavering arm, and with a smile of  drunken intelligence exclaimed, " Ah, c'est mon Jésus-Christ !  Bonsoir, monsieur ! " a renewed shiver of apprehension went  round among the madly frightened people. Then he rose,  throwing off a cowering woman, staggering a little, holding to  his chair, and turned to address to his guests a mock speech  of introduction : " Mesdames et Messieurs, je vous présente mon modèle, l'excel-  lent Ladislas ! " When he had declaimed thus, rising superior to a thickened  stammer, " La Coquelicotte," as the orange lady had at once been  named, bounded from her chair with a scream. It was the signal  for a lightning change of emotion : the hysterics rose to an aban-  doned shout of uncontrollable laughter ; the moaning woman raised  her head ; the men banged the table and exclaimed according to  their mood. One caught a handful of green stuff from a vase  that had already been knocked over, and dashed them to the  ground in front of the rock-still white figure. The dark-haired woman--Wladislaw had not recognised her, and she wore  shoes this time--laid her swollen hand upon Dufour's shoulder  and cried harshly, " Va, Toni ! Monsieur a besoin d'un  âne ! " More screams greeted this pleasantry, and " La Coquelicotte " flew 114  Wladislaw's Advent flew towards the figure with a  pas de cancan  ; one arm tightened  round his neck like a lasso. Then his frozen quiet left him ; there was a sort of fight  between them. An oath in his own tongue burst from him, but she twisted  her fingers below his arms and dragged him towards the table,  meeting every effort at resistance with a kiss. His head swam as  he saw her face come close to him, its crooked mouth open, and  the blank in her line of even teeth which was supposed to be a  charm ; her coarse hair seemed to singe his neck as it brushed  upon him, and in a moment he was pushed into a chair at the table and received a handful of red rose-petals in his face from a  woman opposite. Dufour was murmuring some apologies about forgetting the  appointment. He had been away ; had come back in time for  this supper, long arranged--a farewell to his old manner and his  old loves ; but Wladislaw barely listened. When " La Coqueli-  cotte " sat upon his knee, he threatened to strike her, and then  bethought him with shame that she was a woman. He took a glass that was pushed to him, and drank to steady  himself. It was Chartreuse they had given him--Chartreuse,  more deadly and more insidious than pure spirit--and in a very  little while his head failed him, and he remembered nothing after.  Perhaps it was as well. The wild laughter and indecent jokes  surged up hotter than before ; every one strove to forget the stun  of that terrible moment, when, at the jarring scrape of the curtain-  rings upon their rod, the white figure of the Christ had interrupted  them ; when it had seemed, indeed, that the last day had come,  that judgment and retribution, harsher than all hell to those taken  in their sinning, had fallen on them as they shrieked and howled like human swine amid the refuse of their feast. That By Ménie Muriel Dowie  115 That was a moment they never forgot. It carried no lesson,  it gave no warning, it altered nothing, and was of no use ; but it  frightened them, and they were not strong enough to wipe out its  cold memory. There is perhaps a moral in Wladislaw's story ; if so, I have  has no thought to write it. Certainly the world has turned and  made mock, like those men and women, at the Christ-figure ; and  as I write I find myself wondering about the great promise which  is still the Hope of some. When He comes, if He is to come, will it be upon some such  scene that He will choose to enter ? Castle Campbell , September , 1891. The Waking of Spring By   Olive Custance SPIRIT of Spring, thy coverlet of snow Hath fallen from thee, with its fringe of frost, And where the river late did overflow Sway fragile white anemones, wind-tost, And in the woods stand snowdrops, half asleep, With drooping heads--sweet dreamers so long lost. Spirit, arise ! for crimson flushes creep Into the cold grey east, where clouds assemble To meet the sun : and earth hath ceased to weep. Her tears tip every blade of grass, and tremble, Caught in the cup of every flower. O Spring ! I see thee spread thy pinions, they resemble Large delicate leaves, all silver-veined, that fling Frail floating shadows on the forest sward ; And all the birds about thee build and sing ! Blithe By Olive Custance  117 Blithe stranger from the gardens of our God, We welcome thee, for one is at thy side Whose voice is thrilling music, Love, thy Lord, Whose tender glances stir thy soul, whose wide Wings wave above thee, thou awakened bride ! Rustem Firing the  Shot By Patten Wilson Mr. Stevenson's Forerunner By   James Ashcroft Noble FOR a long time--I can hardly give a number to its years--I  have been haunted by a spectre of duty. Of late the visita-  tions of the haunter have recurred with increasing frequency and  added persistence of appeal ; and though, like Hamlet, I have long  dallied with the ghostly behest, like him I am at last compelled to  obedience. Ghosts, I believe, have a habit of putting themselves  in evidence for the purpose of demanding justice, and my ghost  makes no display of originality : in this respect he follows the time-honoured example of his tribe, and if peace of mind is to  return to me the exorcism of compliance must needs be uttered. Emerson in one of his gnomic couplets proclaims his conviction  that " One accent of the Holy Ghost  This heedful world hath never lost " -- a saying which, shorn of its imaginative wings and turned into a  pedestrian colloquialism, reads something like this--" What de-  serves to live the world will not let die." It is a comforting  belief yet there are times when Tennyson's vision of the " fifty  seeds," out of which Nature " often brings but one to bear,"  seems nearer to the common truth of things ; and all the world's heedfulness 122  Mr. Stevenson's Forerunner heedfulness will not exclude Oblivion with her poppies from some  spot which should have been sacred to Fame with her amaranth  and asphodel. Still there will always be those who will stretch out  a hand to repel or evict the intruder--even as in Mr. Watts's  noble allegory Love would bar the door against Death--and I  would fain play my little part in one not inglorious eviction. I want to write of a wholly-forgotten prose-man (forgotten,  that is, by all save a solitary enthusiast here and there), but I  must  speak of a half-forgotten singer. Only people who are  on the shady side of middle-age can remember the intense  enthusiasm excited by the  work of the young Glasgow poet,  Alexander Smith. He had been discovered by that mighty hunter  of new poets, the Rev. George Gilfillan ; and in the columns of Mr. Gilfillan's journal  The Critic  had been published a number of  verses which whetted the appetite of connoisseurs in the early  fifties for the maiden volume of a bard who, it was broadly hinted,  might be expected to cast Keats into shadow. The prediction was a daring one ; but the fifties, like the nineties, were a hey-day  of new reputations ; and when that brilliant though somewhat  amorphous work, A Life Drama , saw the light, a good many people, not wholly indiscriminating, were more than half inclined  to think that it had been fulfilled. The performance of the new  poet, taken as a whole, might be emotionally crude and intel-  lectually ineffective, but its affluence in the matter of striking  imagery was amazing, and the critical literature of the day was  peppered with quotations of Alexander Smith's " fine passages."  Very few people open  A Life Drama  now, though much time is  spent over books that are a great deal poorer ; but if any reader,  curious to know what kind of thing roused the admiration of  connoisseurs in the years 1853-4, will spend an hour over the  volume, he will come to the conclusion that it is a very remarkable specimen By James Ashcroft Noble  123 specimen of what may be called the decorated style of poetic architecture. " An opulent soul Dropt in my path like a great cup of gold, All rich and rough with stories of the gods." " The sun is dying like a cloven king In his own blood ; the while the distant moon, Like a pale prophetess that he has wronged, Leans eager forward with most hungry eyes Watching him bleed to death, and, as he faints, She brightens and dilates ; revenge complete She walks in lonely triumph through the night." " My drooping sails Flap idly 'gainst the mast of my intent ; I rot upon the waters when my prow Should grate the golden isles." " The bridegroom sea Is toying with the shore, his wedded bride, And, in the fulness of his marriage joy, He decorates her tawny brow with shells, Retires a space to see how fair she looks, Then, proud, runs up to kiss her." These and such things as these were what the admiring critics  loved to quote, and that they were indeed " fine passages " could not  be denied even by people whose tastes were for something a little  less gaudy. What was denied by those who were able to preserve  some calmness of judgment amid the storm of enthusiasm was  that this kind of fineness was the kind that goes to the making  of great poetry. The special fine things were ingenious, striking, and 124  Mr. Stevenson's Forerunner and sometimes beautiful conceits ; they were notable  tours de force   of poetic fancy ; but they bore little if any witness to that illumi-  nating revealing imagination of which great poetry is all compact.  The young writer's images were happy discoveries of external and  accidental resemblances ; not revelations of inherent and inter- pretative affinity. Howsoever graceful and pretty in its way were  the figure which likened the sea and the shore to a bridegroom  and his bride, it gave no new insight into the daily mystery of the  swelling and ebbing tide--no such hint of a fine correspondence  between the things of sense and of spirit as is given in the really  imaginative utterance of Whitman : " Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her I shall follow,  As the water follows the moon silently with fluid steps anywhere  around the globe." What was most characteristic therefore in the verse of Alex-  ander Smith was a winning or arresting quality of fancy; and, in  poetry, fancy, though not to be despised, exercises a subordinate  sway--" she is the second, not the ." It may be that Smith  came to see this : it is more probable that he came to feel it, as a  man feels many things which he does not formulate in a clearly  outlined thought : at any rate, after the publication of  Edwin of  Deira , his  volume of verse, he ceased almost entirely from  song, and chose as his favourite vehicle of expression a literary form  in which his special gift counted for more, and carried greater  weight of value, than it could ever count or carry in the poems  by which he  caught the world's ear. And yet, curiously enough, while Smith's reputation as a poet  still lingers in a faint after-glow, the essays in which he expressed himself By James Ashcroft Noble  125 himself with so much more of adequacy and charm cannot be said  to have won fame at all. They have had from the  their  little circle of ardent admirers, but it has never widened ; its  circumference has never touched, never even approximated to,  the circumference of that larger circle which includes all lovers of  letters. To be unacquainted with Lamb or Hunt, Hazlitt or  De Quincey, would be recognised as a regrettable limitation of  any man's knowledge of English literature : non-acquaintance  with Alexander Smith as a writer of prose is felt to be one of  those necessary ignorances that can hardly be lamented because  they are rendered inevitable by the shortness of life and the  multiplicity of contending appeals. The fact that Smith as a  poet achieved little more than a  succès d'estime  may have pre-  judiced his reputation as an essayist ; but whatever theory be  constructed to account for it, recent literary history presents no  more curious instance of utter refusal to really admirable work of  deserved recognition and far-reaching fame. For it must be noted and insisted upon that the essays of  Alexander Smith are no mere caviare literature. They have  neither the matter nor the manner of coterie performance--the  kind of performance which appeals to an acquired sense, and gives  to its admirer a certain pleasing consciousness of aloofness from  the herd. He is in the true line of descent from the great pre-  decessors just named ; and as they were his lineal forerunners, so  are Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson and Mr.  Richard Le Gallienne   his lineal descendants. Indeed the name of Mr. Stevenson  suggests, or rather re-suggests, a thought which is more or less  familiar to most of us--that in the world of letters there are  seasons uncongenial to certain growths of fame which in another spring and autumn might have blossomed and borne much fruit.  Only by some such consideration is it possible to account for the curious The Yellow Book--Vol. IV.  H 126  Mr. Stevenson's Forerunner curious fact that while  Virginibus Puerisque  and  Men and Books   found their audience at once,  Dreamthorp  and  Last Leaves are  still so largely unknown, and can now only be procured by diligent search of the catalogues of the second-hand booksellers. The  fact is all the more curious because Alexander Smith may be  roughly described as a Stevenson born out of due time. Roughly,  of course, for the individuality of thinking and utterance which  is so important in all pure literature is, in the essay, not only  important but essential--the one thing needful, apart from which  all other things are, comparatively speaking, of no account ; and  in both Smith's work and Mr. Stevenson's the note of personality  always rings clear and true. Their essays are what the essay in its purest form always tends  to be--the prose analogue of the song of self-expression, with its explicit or implicit autobiography, that touches us as we are  never touched by external splendours of epic or drama. In Mon-  taigne, the father of the essay, the personal confession has an  almost boyish incontinence of frankness : in Smith, as in all the  modern men, it has more of reticence and reserve, but it is there  all the time ; and even when the thought seems most abstract  and impersonal the manner of its utterance has not the coldness  of disquisition, but the warmth of colloquy. We learn something  of the secret of this quality of the work from a few sentences in  which Smith discourses of his favourite craft and of his fellow- craftsmen. Just as two or three of our best sonneteers--Words-  worth and Rossetti to wit--have written admirable sonnets in  celebration of the sonnet, so Alexander Smith is seldom seen to  greater advantage than in the pages where he magnifies his office  and makes himself the essayist of the essay. " The essay, as a literary form, resembles the lyric, in so far as it is By James Ashcroft Noble  127 is moulded by some central mood--whimsical, serious, or satirical.  Give the mood, and the essay, from the  sentence to the last, grows  around it as the cocoon grows around the silkworm. . . . The essayist  is a kind of poet in prose, and if harshly questioned as to his uses, he  might be unable to render a better apology for his existence than a  flower might. The essay should be pure literature, as the poem is  pure literature. The essayist wears a lance, but he cares more for the  sharpness of its point than for the pennon that flutters upon it, than  for the banner of the captain under whom he serves. He plays with  death as Hamlet played with Yorick's skull, and he reads the morals--  strangely stern, often, for such fragrant lodging--which are folded up  in the bosoms of roses. He has no pride, and is deficient in a sense  of the congruity and fitness of things. He lifts a pebble from the  ground, and puts it aside more carefully than any gem ; and on a nail  in a cottage door he will hang the mantle of his thought, heavily  brocaded with the gold of rhetoric." It may be remarked in parenthesis that the above sentences  were published in 1863, and they provide what is probably the   statement by an English writer with any repute of the famous  doctrine " Art for art's sake " to which Smith seems to have  worked his own way without the prompting of Gallican sugges-  tion. Indeed, even in 1869, when Mr. Patrick Proctor Alexander edited Smith's posthumous volume,  Last Leaves , he  remarked in his introduction that he had thought of excluding  the essay entitled " Literary Work," in which the same doctrine  was more elaborately advocated, apparently on the ground that it  was a new heresy which might expose Smith to the pains and penalties of literary excommunication. How curious it seems.  In ten years the essay which Mr. Alexander printed with an  apology became the accepted creed of all or nearly all the younger  men of letters in England, and now it is no longer either a dangerous 128  Mr. Stevenson's Forerunner dangerous luxury or an article of orthodox faith, but one of those uninteresting commonplaces which applied in one way is a truism,  in another a fatuous absurdity. So does fortune turn her wheel  for theories as well as for men and women. In the passage just quoted Smith deals with the essay mainly as  simple literature, but he loves and praises it not as literature only,  but as autobiography ; not merely as something that is in itself  interesting and attractive, but as a window through which he can  peer in upon something more interesting still--the master who  built the house after his own design and made it an architectural  projection of himself. " You like, to walk round peculiar or important men as you like to walk round a building, to view it from different points and in different  lights. Of the essayist, when his mood is communicative, you obtain  a full picture. You are made his contemporary and familiar friend.  You enter into his humours and his seriousness. You are made heir  of his whims, prejudices, and playfulness. You walk through the  whole nature of him as you walk through the streets of Pompeii,  looking into the interior of stately mansions, reading the satirical  scribblings on the walls. And the essayist's habit of not only giving  you his thoughts, but telling you how he came by them, is interesting,  because it shows you by what alchemy the ruder world becomes  transmuted into the finer. We like to know the lineage of ideas,  just as we like to know the lineage of great earls and swift race-  horses. We like to know that the discovery of the law of gravitation  was born of the fall of an apple in an English garden on a summer  afternoon. Essays written after this fashion are racy of the soil in  which they grow, as you taste the lava in the vines grown on the  slopes of Etna, they say. There is a healthy Gascon flavour in Montaigne's Essays ; and Charles Lamb's are scented with the prim- roses of Covent Garden." In By James Ashcroft Noble  129 In the  of these passages Alexander Smith speaks of the  mantle of the essayist's thought " heavily brocaded with the gold  of rhetoric," and he himself was a cunning embroiderer. It was  a gift of nature, but he did not learn at once how he could best  utilise it. He brocaded his poetry, and on poetry brocade even of  gold is an impertinence, just as is paint-- pace  Gibson--on the  white marble of the sculptured group or figure. In the essay he  found a form which relies less exclusively upon body of imagina-  tion and perfectness of pure outline--which is more susceptible to  legitimate adornment by the ornamentation of a passing fancy.  It is a form in which even the conceit is not unwelcome : to use  the language of science the conceit finds in the essay its fit  environment. Thus, in Smith's pages Napoleon dies at St.  Helena " like an untended watch-fire " ; Ebenezer Elliot, the  Corn Law rhymer, is " Apollo, with iron dust upon his face,  wandering among the Sheffield knife-grinders " ; the solitary  Dreamthorp doctor has a fancy for arguing with the good simple  clergyman, but though " he cannot resist the temptation to hurl a  fossil at Moses," " he wears his scepticism as a coquette wears her  ribbons--to annoy if he cannot subdue--and when his purpose is  served, he puts aside his scepticism--as the coquette puts her  ribbons." When the black funeral creeps into Dreamthorp from  some outlying hamlet, the people reverently doff their hats and stand aside, for, as Smith puts it, " Death does not walk about  here often, but when he does, he receives as much respect as the  squire himself." There is, in this last sentence, a touch of quiet  Addisonian irony ; and, indeed, Smith reminds us at times of  almost all his great predecessors in the art of essay-writing of  his prime favourites Montaigne and Bacon (" our earliest essayists  and our best " is his own eulogium) ; and also of Addison, Steele,  Lamb, Hazlitt, and Leigh Hunt. But it is never a reminder that 130  Mr. Stevenson's Forerunner that brings with it a suggestion of imitation. The methods and  graces of these distinguished forerunners are to be found in  Smith's pages only by patient analysis, and then never in their  crude state, for his personality fuses them into a new amalgam  and stamps them with a new hall-mark. Perhaps the most purely individual qualities of Smith's work  are given to it partly by his remarkable aptitude for the presenta-  tion of his thought in simile and metaphor ; partly by his fine  feeling for colour, and, indeed, for all the elements of picturesque-  ness ; and partly by a native tendency to sombreness of reflection  which makes such a theme as that of the essay, " On Death and  the Fear of Dying," attractive rather than repellent, or--to  speak, perhaps, with greater accuracy--repellent, yet irresistibly  fascinating, as is the eye of the rattlesnake to its prey. The  image-making endowment makes itself manifest in almost every passage that it would be possible to quote as characteristic ; and it  may be noted that the associative habit of mind betrays itself not  merely in the sudden simile which transfixes a resemblance on the  wing, but in the numerous pages in which Smith showed his love  for tracing the links of the chain that connects the near and the  far, the present and the past, the seen and the unseen. Thus he  writes in his Dreamthorp cottage : " That winter morning when Charles lost his head in front of the banqueting-hall of his own palace, the icicles hung from the eaves of the houses here, and the clown kicked the snowballs from his clouted shoon, and thought but of his supper when at three o'clock the red  sun set in the purple mist. On that Sunday in June, while Waterloo  was going on, the gossips, after morning service, stood on the country roads discussing agricultural prospects, without the slightest suspicion  that the day passing over their heads would be a famous one in the  calendar. . . . The last setting sun that Shakspeare saw reddened the windows By James Ashcroft Noble  131 windows here, and struck warmly on the faces of the hinds coming  home from the fields. The mighty storm that raged while Cromwell  lay a-dying, made all the oak-woods groan round about here, and tore  the thatch from the very roofs that I gaze upon. When I think  of this I can almost, so to speak, lay my hand upon Shakspeare  and upon Cromwell. These poor walls were contemporaries of  both, and I find something affecting in the thought. The mere  soil is, of course, full older than either, but  it  does not touch one in  the same way. A wall is the creation of a human hand ; the soil is not." Smith's picturesqueness is fully in evidence here, though the  passage was not quoted to illustrate it. Indeed, there are few  writers who satisfy so largely the visual sense of the imagination.  Even his literary appraisements--witness the essays on Dunbar  and Chaucer, and that charming paper " A Shelf in my Book-  case "--have a pictorial quality, as if he must  see  something as  well as think  something. Here is Dreamthorp where the essayist,  the transfigured Alexander Smith--" Smith's Smith " as the  Autocrat of the Breakfast-table would put it--lives his ideal life : " This place suits my whim, and I like it better year after year.  As with everything else, since I began to love it I find it growing beautiful. Dreamthorp--a castle, a chapel, a lake, a straggling strip  of grey houses, with a blue film of smoke over all--lies embosomed in  emerald. Summer with its daisies runs up to every cottage door.  From the little height where I am now sitting I see it beneath me.  Nothing could be more peaceful. The wind and the birds fly over  it. A passing sunbeam makes brilliant a white gable-end, and brings  out the colours of the blossomed apple-tree beyond, and disappears. I  see figures in the street, but hear them not. The hands on the church  clock seem always pointing to one hour. Time has fallen asleep in  the afternoon sunshine. I make a frame of my fingers and look at my 132  Mr. Stevenson's Forerunner my picture. On the walls of the next Academy's exhibition will  hang nothing half so beautiful." This is the  tout ensemble , but every detail has its own pictorial  charm. There is the canal--a prosaic unpicturesque thing is a  canal; but this particular canal has " a great white water-lily  asleep on its olive-coloured face," while to the picture-making eye  " a barge trailing up through it in the sunset is a pretty sight ; and the heavenly crimsons and purples sleep quite lovingly upon  its glossy ripples. Nor does the evening star disdain it, for as I  walk along I see it mirrored as clearly as in the waters of the  Mediterranean itself." The sombreness of reflection noted as one of the characteristic  features of Smith's work as an essayist gives to that work a  recognisable autumnal feeling. It is often difficult to think of  it as the work of a young man full of the ordinary buoyant life of  youth ; though when the difficulty presents itself one may remember  also that the young man was destined to die at thirty-seven--that  fatal age for the children of imagination--and it is, perhaps, not  too fanciful to indulge the thought that some presentiment of early  doom may have given to Smith's meditative moods much of their  pensive seriousness. However this may be, it is certain that  Alexander Smith, with a constancy which the most careless reader  cannot fail to note, recurred again and again, both when oppor- tunity offered and when opportunity had to be made, to the theme  of death, its mystery, its fear, and its fascination. In one of his  poems, which I quote from memory, he speaks of his life as a  highway which, at some unknown point, has his grave cut across ;  and even in the joyous " Spring Chanson " the poet, addressing the  singing merle, drops suddenly from the major into the minor key,  and ends upon the note by which the key is dominated : " Men By James Ashcroft Noble  133 " Men live and die, the song remains ; and when I list the passion of thy vernal breath Methinks thou singest best to Love and Death-- To happy Lovers and to dying Men." Autumn and death must needs be naturally allied in human  thought, though to the joyous-minded even autumn will be  associated with its present fruitage rather than with its presage of  dissolution ; but this intrusion of death into a celebration of the  life and growth of spring seems irrelevant, almost morbid : it may  even seem artificial, as if the poet were deliberately striving after a  strong literary effect by the expedient of an unnatural juxtaposition   of incongruous ideas. To a man of Smith's mind and tempera-  ment it has certainly neither irrelevance nor artificiality ; whether  we can rightly call it morbid depends upon the meaning we attach to a word to which the personal feeling rather than the  common reason gives a definition. Smith's habit was to endeavour  to realise death that he might more fully and richly realise life.  " To denude death of its terrible associations," he writes, " were  a vain attempt, the atmosphere is always cold around an iceberg " ;  and yet in imagination he loves to draw near the iceberg for some  shivering moments that he may enjoy more exquisitely the warmth  of summer sun or piled-up winter fire. To his constant thought " There are considerations which rob death of its ghastliness, and help to reconcile us to it. The thoughtful happiness of a human being is complex, and in certain moved moments which, after they have gone, we can recognise to have been our happiest, some subtle thought of death has been curiously intermixed. And this subtle admixture it is that gives the happy moment its character--which makes the difference  between the gladness of a child, resident in mere animal health and  impulse, and too volatile to be remembered, and the serious joy of a man, 134  Mr. Stevenson's Forerunner man who looks before and after, and takes in both this world and the next. Speaking broadly, it may be said that it is from some obscure recognition of the fact of death that life draws its final sweetness. .... This recognition does not always terrify. The spectre has  the most cunning disguises, and often when near us, we are unaware  of the fact of proximity. Unsuspected, this idea of death lurks in the  sweetness of music ; it has something to do with the pleasure with  which we behold the vapour of morning ; it comes between the  passionate lips of lovers; it lives in the thrill of kisses. 'An inch  deeper, and you will find the emperor.' Probe joy to its last fibre  and you will find death." To preserve always in the background of the mind some great  thought or momentous interest, tends to ensure a certain fine  justice in a man's estimate of the relative proportions of smaller  things lying in the front of it, and Alexander Smith's essays have  a restful quality of measure, balance, and sanity. In the " Essay  on an Old Subject," published in  Last Leaves , the young man who  had but recently gone into the thirties writes with imaginative  prescience--or possibly from a premature experience--of the joys  and gains of middle-age (by which he means the forty-fifth year or  thereabouts) ; and there is in most of his essays, especially in the Dreamthorp  papers which came earliest, a middle-aged maturity  which charms and satisfies, and never disturbs. But it is not a  middle-age which has ossified into routine and become dead to youth's enthusiasms--witness the fine ardour of the concluding sentence of the essay in which he " memorises " Carlyle's appear-  ance at Edinburgh to deliver his Rectorial address : " When I  saw him for the time stand up amongst us the other day, and  heard him speak kindly, brotherly, affectionate words .... I am  not ashamed to confess that I felt moved towards him as I do not  think, in any possible combination of circumstances, I could have felt By James Ashcroft Noble  135 felt moved towards any other living man." And yet, though he has  not lost youth's ardour, he has freed himself from youth's arrogant  impatience ; he can be moved by enthusiasms, but not driven help-  lessly before them ; he can project himself from himself and survey  his own thought " in the round " ; he has learned the lessons of  Clough's pregnant words, " and yet--consider it again." At the  same time his manner it never that tantalising, irritating manner  of explicit guards, reserves, limitations--the manner of the writer  who is always making himself safe by the sudden " but " or  " nevertheless " or " notwithstanding." The due limitation is con-  veyed implicitly, in the primal statement of the thought--in the  touch of irony or humorous extravagance which hints with  sufficing clearness that this or that is not to be interpreted  au pied  de la lettre . The delightful essay " On Vagabonds," at the close of  the  Dreamthorp volume, might be described roughly as a glorifica-  tion of the life of Bohemia, and an impeachment, or at any rate a  depreciation of commonplace Philistine respectability. In dealing  with such a theme with such a bent of mind, the temptation to  force the note, to overcharge the colour, would be to most men--  to all young men, impatient of restricting conventions--well-nigh  irresistible ; but Smith resists it with no apparent effort of  resistance. There is no holding of himself in lest he should speak  unadvisedly with his tongue ; on the contrary, he lets himself go  with perfect abandonment. The " genuine vagabond," he says,  " takes captive the heart," and he declares it " high time that a  moral game law were passed for the preservation of the wild and  vagrant feelings of human nature " ; but just when we expect the  stroke of exaggeration there comes instead the light touch of saving  humour, and we know that the essayist is in less danger even than  we of losing his head, or, as the expressive cant phrase has it,  " giving himself away." Some 136  Mr. Stevenson's Forerunner Some of the few (and if I could succeed in increasing their  number I should be greatly content) who know Alexander  Smith's prose well, and love it even as they know, have probably  favourite papers or favourite groups. Some may feel especially  drawn to the essays of pure reflection, such as " Death and the  fear of Dying " and " The Importance of a Man to Himself " ; others to that delightful group in which the familiar simplicities  of nature supply texts for tranquil meditation--" Dreamthorp,"  " Christmas," and " Books and Gardens," in which last there is  also some delightful character-portraiture in the vignettes of the  village doctor and clergyman ; others to the essays in literary  appreciation, such as " Dunbar," " Geoffrey Chaucer," " Scottish  Ballads," and " A Shelf in my Bookcase." In the words applied  by Charles Lamb, with a certain free unscrupulousness to the  whole world of books, I must say with regard to Alexander  Smith's essays, " I have no preferences." To me they all have a  charm which somewhat dulls the edge of discrimination, for the writer rather than the theme is the centre of interest ; he is the  hero of the play, and he is never off the stage. Still in some  torture chamber of inquiry certain names might be extracted from  me, and I think they would be " Dreamthorp," " Books and  Gardens," and " A Lark's Flight." This last study, which has  not been previously named, is one of the most noteworthy of  Smith's essays, and will be grateful to the more lazy readers inasmuch as it tells a story. It is the story of a murder and an  execution, the murder vulgar and commonplace enough--a crime  of brutal violence, the execution a sombrely picturesque function,  with one striking incident which seized and held the imagination  of the boy who witnessed it ; and the story is told with an arrest-  ing vividness to which I know only one parallel in English  literature, the narrative appendix to De Quincey's famous essay, " On By James Ashcroft Noble  137 " On Murder, considered as one of the Fine Arts." The execu-  tion took place, after the old custom in Scotland, on the spot  where the crime had been committed--a lonely stretch of grass-  land, some distance outside the city of Glasgow. The criminals  were Irish navvies, members of a large gang employed in the  neighbourhood, and as there were some rumours of a rescue, a  detachment of cavalry, supplemented by field-pieces, surrounded  the scaffold. Of the scene itself, and the one occurrence round  which its latent pathos crystallised, Smith gives the recollections  of boyhood. The men were being brought in a cart to the place  of execution, and when they reached the turn of the road where they could  see the black cross-beam with its empty halters,  the boy noted the eager, fascinated gaze the doomed men cast  upon it. At last the place was reached, and Smith writes : " Around it a wide space was kept clear by the military ; the cannon were placed in position ; out flashed the swords of the dragoons ; beneath and around on every side was the crowd. Between two brass helmets I could see the scaffold clearly enough, and when in a little while the men, bareheaded and with their attendants, appeared upon  it, the surging crowd became stiffened with fear and awe. And now it  was that the incident, so simple, so natural, so much in the ordinary course of things, and yet so frightful in its tragic suggestions, took place. Be it remembered that the season was early May, that the day  was fine, that the wheatfields were clothing themselves in the green  of the young crop, and that around the scaffold, standing on a sunny  mound, a wide space was kept clear. When the men appeared  beneath the beam, each under his own proper halter, there was a dead  silence,--every one was gazing too intently to whisper to his neighbour  even. Just then, out of the grassy space at the foot of the scaffold, in  the dead silence audible to all, a lark rose from the side of its nest,  and went singing upward in its happy flight. O heaven ! how did that 138  Mr. Stevenson's Forerunner that song translate itself into dying ears ? Did it bring, in one wild  burning moment, father and mother, and poor Irish cabin, and prayers  said at bedtime, and the smell of turf fires, and innocent sweet-  hearting, and rising and setting suns ? Did it--but the dragoon's  horse has become restive, and his helmet bobs up and down and blots  everything ; and there is a sharp sound, and I feel the great crowd  heave and swing, and hear it torn by a sharp shiver of pity, and the  men whom I saw so near but a moment ago are at immeasurable distance, and have solved the great enigma,--and the lark has not yet  finished his flight : you can see and hear him yonder in the fringe of  a white May cloud. . . . . There is a stronger element of terror in  this incident of the lark than in any story of a similar kind I can remember." Gasps of admiration are amateurish, provincial, ineffective, but  after reading such a passage as this, the words that come --at  any rate to me--are not in the least critical but simply exclama-  tory. It is wonderful writing ! Then comes a calmer and more  analytical moment in which one discovers something of the secret  of the art in what has seemed at  not art at all but sheer nature.  Mr.  Pater , in one of his most instructive essays, has shown that  the " classical " element in art is " the quality of order in beauty,"  and that " it is that addition of strangeness to beauty that con-  stitutes the romantic character," romantic art at its best being  moreover distinguished by a fine perfection of workmanship.  This surely then is an impressive miniature example of romantic  art with its combination of strangeness and beauty, and its flaw-  less technique--its absolute saturation of the vehicle of expression  with the very essence of the thing, the emotion that is to be  expressed. Note the directness and simplicity of the early narrative sentences ; they are a mere recital of facts, and their  very baldness only mitigated by a single emotional phrase, " the surging By James Ashcroft Noble 139 surging crowd became stiffened with fear and awe," prepares the  mind for what is to follow. And then, the sudden break in the  second sentence beginning " Did it,"--how perfectly natural it  seems, and yet how dexterous it really is ; how it renders perfectly  and at a single stroke what the best-chosen words of narrative  would have rendered jumblingly, the brevity of the interval  between the lark's rising and the consummation of doom--the  sharp bewildering suddenness of the end. Then, lastly, the  curious in these things may notice a certain peculiarity in the construction of the concluding sentence of the story--the penulti- mate sentence of the quotation. There are in the volume barely  nine lines, and in these lines the word " and " occurs eleven times.  All frequent and close repetitions of a single word are generally  avoided by good writers, and the repetition of an insignificant  conjunction such as " and " is, as a rule, something to be specially  avoided. Smith habitually avoided as carefully as any of us, but  here he had to give the feeling of impetuosity, of eager hurry to  get the ghastly story told, and the " and " which rapidly accumu-  lates detail upon detail recurs as naturally and inevitably as in the  voluble speech of a little child bursting into her mother's room with some marvellous recital of adventure encountered in her  morning walk. This is the high literary art which instinctively  and perfectly adapts the means of language--of word, sound, pause,  and cadence--to the end of absolute expression. Alexander Smith himself is never wearisome ; and it would ill  become me to weary those whom I would fain interest by sur-  plusage of comment ; but I should like to add a word or two con-  cerning those essays in which he appears as a critic of literature.  Mr.  Oscar Wilde has said that all good criticism is simply auto-  biography--that is, I suppose, a statement of personal pre-  ferences. I accept the definition if I may enlarge it by saying that 140  Mr. Stevenson's Forerunner that criticism is not merely a statement of personal preferences  but of justifications for such preferences presented with a view to  persuasion. Of course even with this rider the definition still  leaves autobiography the main element in criticism, and of such  autobiographical appraisement Smith was a master. Whether he  formulated the rule never to write of any authors whose work he  did not enjoy I cannot say : he certainly acted upon it with the  most delightful results. So keen in his gusto, so adequate and appetising his expression of it, that one may dare to say the next  best thing to reading Montaigne, Bacon, Chaucer, and the  Scottish Ballads, is to read what Alexander Smith has to say about  them. His talk about books is always so human that it will  delight people whom one would not think of calling literary. He  discourses on  The Canterbury Tales  not as a man weighing and  measuring a book, but as a wayfarer sitting in the inn-yard of the  Tabard at Southwark, watching the crowd of pilgrims with the  eye of an acute and good-natured observer, taking notes of their  appearance, and drawing from it shrewd inferences as to habit and  character. He has certain favourite volumes upon which he ex-  patiates in the essay entitled " A Shelf in my Bookcase " ; and the  principle of selection is obvious enough. They are books full of  a rich humanity ; beneath their paragraphs or stanzas he can  feel the beating heart. The literary vesture is  simply  a vesture which half reveals and half conceals the objects of his love--the  man or woman who lives and breathes behind. He reveals in the  old Scotch ballads and German hymns, for in them the concealing  veil is thin, and the thoughts and loves and pains of simple souls  in dead centuries are laid open and bare. He prefers Hawthorne's Twice-told Tales  to his longer and more elaborate works, such as Transformation  and  The Scarlet Letter , because he finds more of  the man in them, the solitary author who had no public to think of, By James Ashcroft Noble 141 of, and who wrote because he must. He has a genuine catholicity,  but it is not that uninteresting catholicity which lacks defined  circumferences ; and his general sensibility to excellence is em-  phasised by frank confession of his limitations. The author of Paradise Lost  evidently lies a little outside the reach of Alexander  Smith's tentacles of sympathy. " Reading Milton is like dining off gold plate in a company of  kings ; very splendid, very ceremonious, and not a little appalling.  Him I read but seldom, and only on high days and festivals of the  spirit. Him I never lay down without feeling my appreciation  increased for lesser men--never without the same kind of comfort that  one returning from the presence feels when he doffs respectful attitude  and dress of ceremony, and subsides into old coat, familiar arm-chair,  and slippers. After long-continued organ-music the jangle of the  ew's harp is felt as an exquisite relief." There is a trace of Philistinism here--the Philistinism which is  not ashamed but rather complacent ; and it may seem a strange whim  on the part of one who loves Smith's work to choose as a final sample  of it a passage which, some of the elect may think, does not show  him at his best. But Danton's commendation of audacity, though  not universally valid, is a word of wisdom to the advocate with a  strong case. Alexander Smith's best is good with such a rare and  delightful quality of goodness that his appreciator shows no great  temerity in abandoning all reserves and concealments. He is not  afraid of painting the wart, because it is overpowered by strength  of feature and charm of expression. Alexander Smith, as he shows  himself in his prose--in  Dreamthorp , in  Last Leaves , and in that  entrancing book  A Summer in Skye --is one of those writers con-  cerning whom even a lover may tell not only the truth, but the  whole truth. For myself, I read his essays when I was young and found The Yellow Book--Vol. IV.  I 142  Mr. Stevenson's Forerunner found them full of stimulation ; I have read them again since I  have become middle-aged, and have found them satisfyingly rest-  giving. At no time have they been found wanting in something  of rare and delicate delight. If criticism be indeed autobiography,  no verdict upon the essays of Alexander Smith could well be at  once more critical or more praiseful than this confession. I love  Mr. Stevenson and my later contemporaries ; but I think I must  confess that I love my early contemporary, Mr. Stevenson's countryman and forerunner, better still. Red Rose By   Leila Macdonald WHY do your leaves uncurl invisibly ? Is it mere pride ? When I behold your petals, They lie immovably against your breast ; Or opened wide, Your shield thrown wide. But none may watch the unveiling of your pride. Why do you die so soon, so certainly ? Death is disgrace ; You should stay dying half your life ; Your drooping face Gives you when dying your divinest face. But death's pale colours are your sole disgrace. A Westmorland Village By W. W. Russell Margaret By   C. S. THE street was feebly lighted, but by the glare from the public-  house at the corner I could see her coming towards me,  holding a jug in one hand and running the other along the  railings in front of the houses as a boy does a stick. She walked  swiftly but cautiously, and rather as if measuring a distance by  counting the paces. As I came nearer, she shrank against the  railings, and almost stopped ; but as soon as I had passed she went  on again more quickly than before. She must have heard me stop  to look after her ; for she paused for a moment, and turned her head  as if listening, and then glided on through the darkness into the  glare ; and as she went into the public-house I caught sight of a  tangle of heavy golden hair hanging down her back. Presently she came back, keeping close to the houses as before,  and in front of one of them about half-way down the street she  stopped, and passed her hand along the tops of the railings as if  feeling for something. She seemed satisfied, and pushing open  the area gate went down the steps. " Is that you, Maggie ? "  cried a woman's voice--and a flood of light came up from the  area. A door was hastily slammed, and all was dark again ; but  as I passed the house I noticed that the spike on the top of one of  the railings was missing. * * * * * As 148  Margaret As I came round the corner by the public-house, I heard a  hoarse shouting and clashing of pewter pots ; and looking in  through the ill-fitting flap doors, I saw a confused crowd of dirty,  greasy men, straggling to get near the counter. I walked on more  quickly down the street, hoping to be in time. " Stop," I cried suddenly to the little figure creeping along by  the houses. " You mustn't go there to-night. Stay here and  give me the jug, and I'll bring the beer back to you." She started, and caught hold of the railings with one hand.  " Who are you ? " she said, turning a pair of curiously dull eyes  towards me. " Come," said I, " stay here ; I'll tell you all about that when I  come back ; " and I took hold of the jug. " Why shouldn't I get it to-night ? I go nearly every night,  and often during the day as well ; I know the way--and it isn't  far." " It's full of drunken men," I said ; " you'd better stay here." She gave up the jug and leant listlessly against the railings,  keeping her eyes on the ground. " Don't be long please ; they re waiting for me at home. It's  the  door on the left, and there's ' Jug and Bottle Entrance '  on the glass in raised letters." " This is an empty house," I said ; " you can sit on the steps  while I'm gone." When I came back I found her standing by the door with one  hand on the bell-handle. " Did you say this house was empty ? " she asked, as I held  out the beer jug. " Yes," I answered, glancing at the dirty windows in which  bills were posted ; " but why ? " " Because I've been ringing the bell all the time you've been away, By C. S.  149 away, for fun ; and because I don't like being left all alone in the  dark street." " You queer child ! Besides it isn't dark a bit here--there's  a lovely moon." She gave a little shiver, and was silent. " Why don't you take your beer ? " and I offered her the jug  once more. She groped towards me and put her hands on my shoulders  turning those large dull eyes up to mine. " Can't you see I'm blind ? " said she impatiently. * * * * * " It's rather wet to sit here to-night "--and I looked doubtfully  at the doorway up which the wind blew the rain in gusts.  She sat down on the top step, and spread her dress over the damp  stone. " Sit down here ; we can lean against the pillar and be as dry as anything." " How did you know there was a pillar ? " She pouted contemptuously. " Do you think I haven't my  ways of seeing as well as you ? I could describe this street much  better than you for all your wonderful sight ; besides, I found out  all about this particular doorway that night when you  went  and got the beer." " Mind the jug ! " I cried ; but I was too late ; for with a  sweep of her arm the jug toppled over, and the beer rushed down  the steps across the pavement into the gutter. She bit her lip.  " Now don't crow over me : it doesn't follow that I shouldn't  have done it even if I could see." I kissed her forehead lightly. " Never mind, dear heart ; sit still. I won't be long getting  some more." "How 150  Margaret " How aunt would have abused poor Maggie if she hadn't had  her beer," she remarked, as I sat down again after putting the jug  against the door for safety. " I shan't call you Maggie, as they call you that at home. I  shall call you Margaret--Margaret with the glorious hair." " Do you think it's really pretty--very pretty I mean ? " she asked. " Pretty," I echoed ; " why it's the most wonderful and  beautiful thing I have ever seen." She gave a nervous little laugh, and shook her head so that her  face was hidden in masses of gold. " I wish I could see it : I can only feel it and know I have  plenty of it ; " and she frisked her head round so that the warm  waves of colour rippled down my coat into my lap. " You may  cut a little piece off if you like," she added with a sigh. I got out  a pair of pocket scissors, and she folded her hands before her. " You may take one skein ; and mind you don't cut it off too  near my head and leave an ugly gap with a stump at the top." I put my hands gently under the soft warm hair, and choosing  a strand rather darker than the rest cut a piece off the end. " Let me feel it," she said--and I put the wisp into her hand. She nodded contentedly and began fumbling at one of her  stockings. I heard a snap, and presently she gave me a long  cotton thread with which I tied the hair while she held it at each  end. " Aunt talks about giving up the house," she said, jerking her  head in the direction of her home ; " the lodgings don't pay much,  and I heard her say that if she did she'd have to try and get me  into some place for blind people--an asylum or something. Isn't  it horrible ? " " Fancy shutting a sweet little golden darling like you up in an By C. S.  151 an asylum ! " I cried : " it makes me sick to think of it." And  catching her in my arms I pulled her back, and covered her face  and neck and hair with kisses. " Good-night, little golden thing," I said as she got up to go :  " I shall come to-morrow as usual." And I put the jug into her  hand, and set her by the railings. "Take care of that little piece of my hair," she called ; and I  watched her gliding by the houses till she vanished down the area  of her home. * * * * * But alas ! It was fully a fortnight before I was able to visit  the doorway again, and after waiting there in vain for some time  I walked down the deserted street to the house where the spike  was missing from the top of one of the railings. The windows were quite dark, and on the door just above the  letter-box was a piece of paper freshly pasted on. I went up the  steps and struck a match and read : "TO LET FOR KEYS APPLY No. 3 NEWLAND STREET." I walked slowly back till I came to the empty house. The  sight of the familiar doorway was too much for me, and sitting  down I leant against the pillar and gave way to my grief. The Knockout By A. S. Hartrick Of One in Russia By   Richard Garnett, LL.D. DOVE that of old fraught with the olive-spray Toldest of earth arisen from the flood, And how the grove in ancient station stood, And badest man take courage and be gay ; Vain for new leaf this January day To search the savage waste of Scythian wood ; Yet thither wend, of Clara's ill or good Bringing back tidings on thy westering way. Tell her the flame the brand should blithely fling Dies on the hearth in ashes chill and drear, And season vainly lengthens unto Spring Since she forsook the love that held her here, Sorrow and dread and many a joyless thing Leaving in place of her that was so dear. Theodora  A Fragment By   Victoria Cross . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . I DID not turn out of bed till ten o'clock the next morning, and  I was still in dressing-gown and slippers, sitting by the fire,  looking over a map, when Digby came in upon me. " Hullo, Ray, only just up, eh ? as usual ? " was his   exclamation as he entered, his ulster buttoned to his chin, and  the snow thick upon his boots. " What a fellow you are ! I  can't understand anybody lying in bed till ten o'clock in the  morning." " And I can't understand anybody driving up at seven," I  said, smiling, and stirring my coffee idly. I had laid down the  map with resignation. I knew Digby had come round to jaw  for the next hour at least. " Can I offer you some breakfast ? " " Breakfast ! " returned Digby contemptuously. " No, thanks.  I had mine hours ago. Well, what do you think of her ? " " Of whom ?--this Theodora ? " " Oh, it's Theodora already, is it ? " said Digby, looking at me.  " Well, never mind : go on. Yes, what do you think of her ? " "She seems rather clever, I think." "Do By Victoria Cross  157 " Do you ? " returned Digby, with a distinct accent of regret,  as if I had told him I thought she squinted. " I never noticed it.  But her looks, I mean ? " " She is very peculiar," I said, merely. " But you like everything extraordinary. I should have thought  her very peculiarity was just what would have attracted you." " So it does," I admitted ; " so much so, that I am going to  take the trouble of calling this afternoon expressly to see her  again." Digby stared hard at me for a minute, and then burst out  laughing. " By Jove ! You've made good use of your time.  Did she ask you ? " " She did," I said. " This looks as if it would be a case," remarked Digby lightly,  and then added, " I'd have given anything to have had her myself.  But if it's not to be for me, I'd rather you should be the lucky  man than any one else." " Don't you think all that is a little ' previous ' ? " I asked  satirically, looking at him over the coffee, which stood on the map  of Mesopotamia. " Well, I don't know. You must marry some time, Cecil." " Really ! " I said, raising my eyebrows and regarding him with  increased amusement. " I think I have heard of men remaining  celibates before now, especially men with my tastes." " Yes," said Digby, becoming suddenly as serious and thoughtful  as if he were being called upon to consider some weighty problem,  and of which the solution must be found in the next ten minutes.  " I don't know how you would agree. She is an awfully religious  girl." " Indeed ? " I said with a laugh. " How do you know ? " Digby thought hard. " She 158  Theodora "She is," he said with conviction, at last. " I see her at church  every Sunday." " Oh then, of course she must be--proof conclusive," I  answered. Digby looked at me and then grumbled, " Confounded sneering  fellow you are. Has she been telling you she is not ? " I remembered suddenly that I had promised Theodora not to  repeat her opinions, so I only said, " I really don't know what she  is ; she may be most devout for all I know--or care." "Of course you can profess to be quite indifferent," said Digby ungraciously. "But all I can say is, it doesn't look like it--your going there this afternoon ; and anyway, she is not indifferent to  you. She said all sorts of flattering things about you." " Very kind, I am sure," I murmured derisively. " And she sent round to my rooms this morning a thundering  box of Havannahs in recognition of my having won the bet about  your looks." I laughed outright. " That's rather good biz for you ! The  least you can do is to let me help in the smoking of them, I  think." " Of course I will. But it shows what she thinks of you,  doesn't it ? " " Oh, most convincingly," I said with mock earnestness.  " Havannahs are expensive things." " But you know how awfully rich she is, don't you ? " asked  Digby, looking at me as if he wanted to find out whether I were  really ignorant or affecting to be so. " My dear Charlie, you know I know nothing whatever about  her except what you tell me--or do you suppose she showed me  her banking account between the dances ? " " Don't know, I am sure," Digby grumbled back. " You sat in By Victoria Cross  159 in that passage long enough to be going through a banking  account, and balancing it too, for that matter ! However, the  point is, she is rich--tons of money, over six thousand a year." " Really ? " I said, to say something. " Yes, but she loses every penny on her marriage. Seems such  a funny way to leave money to a girl, doesn't it ? Some old pig of  a maiden aunt tied it up in that way . Nasty thing to do, I think ;  don't you ? " " Very immoral of the old lady, it seems. A girl like that, if  she can't marry, will probably forego nothing but the cere-  mony." " She runs the risk of losing her money, though, if anything  were known. She only has it  dum casta manet , just like a separa- tion allowance." " Hard lines," I murmured sympathetically. " And so of course her people are anxious she should make a  good match--take some man, I mean, with an income equal to  what she has now of her own, so that she would not feel any loss.  Otherwise, you see, if she married a poor man, it would be rather  a severe drop for her." " Conditions calculated to prevent any fellow but a millionaire  proposing to her, I should think," I said. " Yes, except that she is a girl who does not care about money.  She has been out now three seasons, and had one or two good  chances and not taken them. Now myself, for instance, if she  wanted money and position and so on, she could hardly do better,  could she ? And my family and the rest of it are all right ; but  she couldn't get over my red hair--I know it was that. She's  mad upon looks--I know she is ; she let it out to me once, and  I bet you anything, she'd take you and chuck over her money and  everything else, if you gave her the chance." " I am 160  Theodora " I am certainly not likely to," I answered. " All this you've  just told me alone would be enough to choke me off. I have always  thought I could never love a decent woman unselfishly enough,  even if she gave up nothing for me ; and, great heavens ! I should  be sorry to value myself, at--what do you say she has ?--six  thousand a year ? " " Leave the woman who falls in love with the cut of your nose  to do the valuation. You'll be surprised at the figure ! " said  Digby with a touch of resentful bitterness, and getting up  abruptly. " I'll look round in the evening," he added, buttoning  up his overcoat. " Going to be in ? " " As far as I know," I answered, and he left. I got up and dressed leisurely, thinking over what he had said,  and those words " six thousand " repeating themselves unpleasantly  in my brain. The time was in accordance with strict formality when I found  myself on her steps. The room I was shown into was large,  much too large to be comfortable on such a day ; and I had to  thread my way through a perfect maze of gilt-legged tables and  statuette-bearing tripods before I reached the hearth. Here burnt  a small, quiet, chaste-looking fire, a sort of Vestal flame, whose heat  was lost upon the tesselated tiles, white marble, and polished brass  about it. I stood looking down at it absently for a few minutes,  and then Theodora came in. She was very simply dressed in some dark stuff that fitted  closely to her, and let me see the harmonious lines of her figure as  she came up to me. The plain, small collar of the dress opened  at the neck, and a delicious, solid, white throat rose from the dull  stuff like an almond bursting from its husk. On the pale, well-  cut face and small head great care had evidently been bestowed.  The eyes were darkened, as last night, and the hair arranged with infinite By Victoria Cross  161 infinite pains on the forehead and rolled into one massive coil at  the back of her neck. She shook hands with a smile--a smile that failed to dispel the  air of fatigue and fashionable dissipation that seemed to cling to  her ; and then wheeled a chair as near to the fender as she  could get it. As she sat down, I thought I had never seen such splendid  shoulders combined with so slight a hip before. " Now I hope no one else will come to interrupt us," she said  simply. " And don't let's bother to exchange comments on the  weather nor last night's dance. I have done that six times over  this morning with other callers. Don't let's talk for the sake of  getting through a certain number of words. Let us talk because  we are interested in what we are saying." " I should be interested in anything if you said it," I  answered. Theodora laughed. " Tell me something about the East, will  you ? That is a nice warm subject, and I feel so cold." And she shot out towards the blaze two well-made feet and  ankles. " Yes, in three weeks' time I shall be in a considerably warmer  climate than this," I answered, drawing my chair as close to hers  as fashion permits. Theodora looked at me with a perceptibly startled expression  as I spoke. " Are you really going out so soon ? " she said. " I am, really," I said with a smile. " Oh, I am so sorry ! " " Why ? " I asked merely. " Because I was thinking I should have the pleasure of meeting  you lots more times at different functions." " And The Yellow Book-- Vol. IV.  K 162  Theodora " And would that be a pleasure ? " " Yes, very great," said Theodora, with a smile lighting her  eyes and parting faintly the soft scarlet lips. She looked at me, a seducing softness melting all her face and  swimming in the liquid darkness of the eyes she raised to mine.  A delicious intimacy seemed established between us by that smile.  We seemed nearer to each other after it than before, by many  degrees. A month or two of time and ordinary intercourse may  be balanced against the seconds of such a smile as this. A faint feeling of surprise mingled with my thoughts, that she  should show her own attitude of mind so clearly, but I believe  she felt instinctively my attraction towards her, and also undoubt-  edly she belonged, and had always been accustomed, to a fast set.  I was not the sort of man to find fault with her for that, and  probably she had already been conscious of this, and felt all the  more at ease with me. The opening-primrose type of woman,  the girl who does or wishes to suggest the modest violet unfolding  beneath the rural hedge, had never had a charm for me. I do not  profess to admire the simple violet ; I infinitely prefer a well- trained hothouse gardenia. And this girl, about whom there was  nothing of the humble, crooked-neck violet--in whom there was  a dash of virility, a hint at dissipation, a suggestion of a certain  decorous looseness of morals and fastness of manners--could  stimulate me with a keen sense of pleasure, as our eyes or hands  met. " Why would it be a pleasure to meet me ? " I asked, holding  her eyes with mine, and wondering whether things would so turn  out that I should ever kiss those parting lips before me. Theodora laughed gently. " For a good many reasons that it would make you too con-  ceited to hear," she answered. " But one is because you are more interesting By Victoria Cross  163 interesting to talk to than the majority of people I meet every  day. The castor of your chair has come upon my dress. Will  you move it back a little, please ? " I pushed my chair back immediately and apologised. " Are you going alone ? " resumed Theodora. " Quite alone." " Is that nice ? " " No. I should have been very glad to find some fellow to go  with me, but it's rather difficult. It is not everybody that one  meets whom one would care to make such an exclusive com-  panion of, as a life like that out there necessitates. Still, there's  no doubt I shall be dull unless I can find some chum there." " Some Englishman, I suppose ? " " Possibly ; but they are mostly snobs who are out there." Theodora made a faint sign of assent, and we both sat silent,  staring into the fire. " Does the heat suit you ? " Theodora asked, after a pause. " Yes, I like it." " So do I." " I don't think any woman would like the climate I am going  to now, or could stand it," I said. Theodora said nothing, but I had my eyes on her face, which  was turned towards the light of the fire, and I saw a tinge of  mockery come over it. We had neither said anything farther, when the sound of a  knock reached us, muffled, owing to the distance the sound had to  travel to reach us by the drawing-room fire at all, but distinct in  the silence between us. Theodora looked at me sharply. " There is somebody else. Do you want to leave yet ? " she  asked, and then added in a persuasive tone, " Come into my own study, 164  Theodora study, where we shan't be disturbed, and stay and have tea with  me, will you ? " She got up as she spoke. The room had darkened considerably while we had been sitting  there, and only a dull light came from the leaden, snow-laden sky  beyond the panes, but the firelight fell strongly across her figure  as she stood, glancing and playing up it towards the slight waist,  and throwing scarlet upon the white throat and under-part of the  full chin. In the strong shadow on her face I could see  merely the two seducing eyes. Easily excitable where once a usually hypercritical or rather hyperfanciful eye has been attracted,  I felt a keen sense of pleasure stir me as I watched her rise and  stand, that sense of pleasure which is nothing more than an  assurance to the roused and unquiet instincts within one, of  future satisfaction or gratification, with, from, or at the expense of  the object creating the sensation. Unconsciously a certainty of  possession of Theodora to-day, to-morrow, or next year, filled me  for the moment as completely as if I had just made her my wife.  The instinct that demanded her was immediately answered by a mechanical process of the brain, not with doubt or fear, but  simple confidence. " This is a pleasant and delightful object to  you--as others have been. Later it will be a source of enjoy-  ment to you--as others have been." And the lulling of this  painful instinct is what we know as pleasure. And this instinct  and its answer are exactly that which we should not feel within us  for any beloved object. It is this that tends inevitably to degrade  the loved one, and to debase our own passion. If the object is  worthy and lovely in any sense, we should be ready to love it as  being such, for itself, as moralists preach to us of Virtue, as theologians preach to us of the Deity. To love or at least to  strive to love an object for the object's sake, and not our own sake, By Victoria Cross  165 sake, to love it in its relation to  its  pleasure and not in its relation  to our own pleasure, is to feel the only love which is worthy of  offering to a fellow human being, the one which elevates--and  the only one--both giver and receiver. If we ever learn this  lesson, we learn it late. I had not learnt it yet. I murmured a prescribed " I shall be delighted," and followed  Theodora behind a huge red tapestry screen that reached half-way  up to the ceiling. We were then face to face with a door which she opened, and  we both passed over the threshold together. She had called the room her own, so I glanced round it with a  certain curiosity. A room is always some faint index to the  character of its occupier, and as I looked a smile came to my face.  This room suggested everywhere, as I should have expected, an  intellectual but careless and independent spirit. There were two  or three tables, in the window, heaped up with books and strewn  over with papers. The centre-table had been pushed away, to  leave a clearer space by the grate, and an armchair, seemingly of  unfathomable depths, and a sofa, dragged forward in its place. Within the grate roared a tremendous fire, banked up half-way  to the chimney, and a short poker was thrust into it between the  bars. The red light leapt over the whole room and made it  brilliant, and glanced over a rug, and some tumbled cushions on  the floor in front of the fender, evidently where she had been  lying. Now, however, she picked up the cushions, and tossed  them into the corner of the couch, and sat down herself in the  other corner. " Do you prefer the floor generally ? " I asked, taking the  armchair as she indicated it to me. " Yes, one feels quite free and at ease lying on the floor,  whereas on a couch its limits are narrow, and one has the con- straint 166  Theodora straint and bother of taking care one does not go to sleep and  roll off." " But suppose you did, you would then but be upon the  floor." " Quite so ; but I should have the pain of falling." Our eyes met across the red flare of the firelight. Theodora went on jestingly : " Now, these are the ethics of  the couch and the floor. I lay myself voluntarily on the floor,  knowing it thoroughly as a trifle low, but undeceptive and favourable  to the condition of sleep which will probably arise, and suitable to  my requirements of ease and space. I avoid the restricted and  uncertain couch, recognising that if I fall to sleep on that raised  level, and the desire to stretch myself should come, I shall awake  with pain and shock to feel the ground, and see above me the  couch from which I fell--do you see ? " She spoke lightly, and with a smile, and I listened with one.  But her eyes told me that these ethics of the couch and floor  covered the ethics of life. " No, you must accept the necessity of the floor, I think, unless  you like to forego your sleep and have the trouble of taking care to  stick upon your couch ; and for me the difference of level between  the two is not worth the additional bother." She laughed, and I joined her. " What do you think ? " she asked. I looked at her as she sat opposite me, the firelight playing all  over her, from the turn of her knee just marked beneath her skirt  to her splendid shoulders, and the smooth soft hand and wrist  supporting the distinguished little head. I did not tell her what  I was thinking ; what I said was : " You are very logical. I am  quite convinced there's no place like the ground for a siesta." Theodora laughed, and laid her hand on the bell. A second By Victoria Cross  167 A second or two after, a door, other than the one we had entered  by, opened, and a maid appeared. " Bring tea and pegs," said Theodora, and the door shut again. " I ordered pegs for you because I know men hate tea," she  said. " That's my own maid. I never let any of the servants  answer this bell except her ; she has my confidence, as far as one  ever gives confidence to a servant. I think she likes me. I like  making myself loved," she added impulsively. " You've never found the least difficulty in it, I should think,"  I answered, perhaps a shade more warmly than I ought, for the  colour came into her cheek and a slight confusion into her eyes. The servant's re-entry saved her from replying. " Now tell me how you like your peg made, and I'll make it,"  said Theodora, getting up and crossing to the table when the  servant had gone. I got up, too, and protested against this arrangement. Theodora turned round and looked up at me, leaning one hand  on the table. " Now, how ridiculous and conventional you are ! " she said.  " You would think nothing of letting me make you a cup of tea,  and yet I must by no means mix you a peg ! " She looked so like a young fellow of nineteen as she spoke  that half the sense of informality between us was lost, and there  was a keen, subtle pleasure in this superficial familiarity with her  that I had never felt with far prettier women. The half of nearly  every desire is curiosity, a vague, undefined curiosity, of which we  are hardly conscious ; and it was this that Theodora so violently  stimulated, while her beauty was sufficient to nurse the other half.  This feeling of curiosity arises, of course, for any woman who  may be new to us, and who has the power to move us at all. But  generally, if it cannot be gratified for the particular one, it is more or 168  Theodora or less satisfied by the general knowledge applying to them all ;  but here, as Theodora differed so much from the ordinary feminine  type, even this instinctive sort of consolation was denied me. I  looked down at her with a smile. " We shan't be able to reconcile Fashion and Logic, so it's no  use," I said. " Make the peg, then, and I'll try and remain in the  fashion by assuming it's tea." " Great Scott ! I hope you won't fancy it's tea while you are  drinking it ! " returned Theodora laughing. She handed me the glass, and I declared nectar wasn't in it with  that peg, and then she made her own tea and came and sat  down to drink it, in not at all an indecorous, but still informal  proximity. " Did you collect anything in the East ? " she asked me, after a  minute or two. " Yes ; a good many idols and relics and curiosities of sorts," I  answered. " Would you like to see them ? " " Very much," Theodora answered. " Where are they ? " " Well, not in my pocket," I said smiling. " At my chambers.  Could you and Mrs. Long spare an afternoon and honour me with  a visit there ? " " I should like it immensely. I know Helen will come if I  ask her." " When you have seen them I must pack them up, and send  them to my agents. One can't travel about with those things." A sort of tremor passed over Theodora's face as I spoke, and  her glance met mine, full of demands and questionings, and a very  distinct assertion of distress. It said distinctly, " I am so sorry  you are going." The sorrow in her eyes touched my vanity  deeply, which is the most responsive quality we have. It is  difficult to reach our hearts or our sympathies, but our vanity is always By Victoria Cross  169 always available. I felt inclined to throw my arm round that  supple-looking waist--and it was close to me--and say, " Don't  be sorry ; come too." I don't know whether my looks were as  plain as hers, but Theodora rose carelessly, apparently to set her  teacup down, and then did not resume her seat by me, but went  back to the sofa on the other side of the rug. This, in the state  of feeling into which I had drifted, produced an irritated sensation,  and I was rather pleased than not when a gong sounded some-  where in the house and gave me a graceful opening to rise. " May I hope to hear from you, then, which day you will like  to come ? " I asked, as I held out my hand. Now this was the moment I had been expecting, practically,  ever since her hand had left mine last night, the moment when it  should touch it again. I do not mean consciously, but there are  a million slight, vague physical experiences and sensations within  us of which the mind remains unconscious. Theodora's white  right hand rested on her hip, the light from above struck upon it,  and I noted that all the rings had been stripped from it ; her left  was crowded with them, so that the hand sparkled at each movement, but not one remained on her right. I coloured violently  for the minute as I recollected my last night's pressure, and the  idea flashed upon me at once that she had removed them expressly  to avoid the pain of having them ground into her flesh. The next second Theodora had laid her hand confidently in  mine. My mind, annoyed at the thought that had just shot  through it, bade me take her hand loosely and let it go, but  Theodora raised her eyes to me, full of a soft disappointment  which seemed to say, " Are you not going to press it, then, after  all, when I have taken off all the rings entirely that you may ? "  That look seemed to push away, walk over, ignore my reason, and appeal directly to the eager physical nerves and muscles. Spontaneously, 170  Theodora Spontaneously, whether I would or not, they responded to it, and  my fingers laced themselves tightly round this morsel of velvet-  covered fire. We forgot in those few seconds to say the orthodox good-byes ;  she forgot to answer my question. That which we were both  saying to each other, though our lips did not open, was, " So I  should like to hold and embrace you ; " and she, " So I should like  to be held and embraced." Then she withdrew her hand, and I went out by way of the  drawing-room where we had entered. In the hall her footman showed me out with extra obsequiousness.  My three-hours' stay raised me, I suppose, to the rank of more  than an ordinary caller. It was dark now in the streets, and the temperature must have  been somewhere about zero. I turned my collar up and started  to walk sharply in the direction of my chambers. Walking always  induces in me a tendency to reflection and retrospection, and now,  removed from the excitement of Theodora's actual presence, my  thoughts lapped quietly over the whole interview, going through it  backwards, like the calming waves of a receding tide, leaving  lingeringly the sand. There was no doubt that this girl attracted  me very strongly, that the passion born yesterday was nearing  adolescence ; and there was no doubt, either, that I ought to strangle  it now before it reached maturity. My thoughts, however, turned  impatiently from this question, and kept closing and centring round  the object itself, with maddening persistency. I laughed to myself  as Schopenhauer's theory shot across me that all impulse to love is  merely the impulse of the genius of the genus to select a fitting object which will help in producing a  Life. Certainly the  genius of the genus in me was weaker than the genius of my own  individuality, in this instance, for Theodora was as unfitted, according By Victoria Cross  171 according to the philosopher's views, to become a co-worker with  me in carrying out Nature's aim, as she was fitted to give me as  an individual the strongest personal pleasure. I remember Schopenhauer does admit that this instinct in man   to choose some object which will best fulfil the duty of the race,  is apt to be led astray, and it is fortunate he did not forget to make  this admission, if his theory is to be generally applied, considering  how very particularly often we are led astray, and that our strongest,  fiercest passions and keenest pleasures are constantly not those  suitable to, nor in accordance with, the ends of Nature. The  sharpest, most violent stimulus, we may say, the true essence of  pleasure, lies in some gratification which has no claim whatever, in  any sense, to be beneficial or useful, or to have any ulterior motive,  conscious or instinctive, or any lasting result, or any fulfilment of  any object, but which is simple gratification and dies naturally in its own excess. As we admit of works of pure genius that they cannot claim  utility, or motive, or purpose, but simply that they exist as joy-  giving and beautiful objects of delight, so must we have done with  utility, motive, purpose, and the aims of Nature, before we can  reach the most absolute degree of positive pleasure. To choose an  admissible instance, a naturally hungry man, given a slice of bread,  will he or will he not devour it with as great a pleasure as the  craving drunkard feels in swallowing a draught of raw brandy ? In the  case a simple natural desire is gratified, and the aim  of Nature satisfied ; but the individual's longing and subsequent  pleasure cannot be said to equal the furious craving of the  drunkard, and his delirious sense of gratification as the brandy  burns his throat. My inclination towards Theodora could hardly be the simple,  natural instinct, guided by natural selection, for then surely I should 172  Theodora should have been swayed towards some more womanly individual,  some more vigorous and at the same time more feminine physique.  In me, it was the mind that had  suggested to the senses, and  the senses that had answered in a dizzy pleasure, that this passionate,  sensitive frame, with its tensely-strung nerves and excitable pulses,  promised the height of satisfaction to a lover. Surely to Nature it  promised a poor if possible mother, and a still poorer nurse. And  these desires and passions that spring from that border-land between  mind and sense, and are nourished by the suggestions of the one  and the stimulus of the other, have a stronger grip upon our  organisation, because they offer an acuter pleasure, than those  simple and purely physical ones in which Nature is striving after  her own ends and using us simply as her instruments. I thought on in a desultory sort of way, more or less about  Theodora, and mostly about the state of my own feelings, until I  reached my chambers. There I found Digby, and in his society,  with his chaff and gabble in my ears, all reflection and philosophy  fled, without leaving me any definite decision made. The next afternoon but one found myself and Digby standing  at the windows of my chambers awaiting Theodora's arrival. I  had invited him to help me entertain the two women, and also to  help me unearth and dust my store of idols and curiosities, and  range them on the tables for inspection. There were crowds of  knick-knacks picked up in the crooked streets and odd corners of  Benares, presents made to me, trifles bought in the Cairo bazaars,  and vases and coins discovered below the soil in the regions of the  Tigris. Concerning several of the most typical objects Digby  and I had had considerable difference of opinion. One highly  interesting bronze model of the monkey-god at Benares he had  declared I could not exhibit on account of its too pronounced  realism and insufficient attention to the sartorial art. I had insisted By Victoria Cross  173 insisted that the god's deficiencies in this respect were not more  striking than the objects in flesh-tints, hung at the Academy, that  Theodora viewed every season. " Perhaps not," he answered. " But this is  not  in pink and  white, and hung on the Academy walls for the public to stare at, and therefore you can't let her see it." This was unanswerable. I yielded, and the monkey-god was  wheeled under a side-table out of view. Every shelf and stand and table had been pressed into the  service, and my rooms had the appearance of a corner in an  Egyptian bazaar, now when we had finished our preparations. " There they are," said Digby, as Mrs. Long's victoria came  in sight. Theodora was leaning back beside her sister, and it struck me  then how representative she looked, as it were, of herself and her  position. From where we stood we could see down into the  victoria, as it drew up at our door. Her knees were crossed  under the blue carriage-rug, on the edge of which rested her two  small pale-gloved hands. A velvet jacket, that fitted her as its  skin fits the grape, showed us her magnificent shoulders, and the  long easy slope of her figure to the small waist. On her head, in the least turn of which lay the acme of distinction, amongst the  black glossy masses of her hair, sat a small hat in vermilion velvet,  made to resemble the Turkish fez. As the carriage stopped, she  glanced up ; and a brilliant smile swept over her face, as she  bowed slightly to us at the window. The handsome painted  eyes, the naturally scarlet lips, the pallor of the oval face, and each  well-trained movement of the distinguished figure, as she rose  and stepped from the carriage, were noted and watched by our  four critical eyes. " A typical product of our nineteenth-century civilisation," I said, 174  Theodora said, with a faint smile, as Theodora let her fur-edged skirt draw  over the snowy pavement, and we heard her clear cultivated tones,  with the fashionable drag in them, ordering the coachman not to  let the horses get cold. " But she's a splendid sort of creature, don't you think ? " asked  Digby. " Happy the man who----eh ? " I nodded. " Yes," I assented. " But how much that man  should have to offer, old chap, that's the point ; that six thousand  of hers seems an invulnerable protection." " I suppose so," said Digby with a nervous yawn. " And to  think I have more than double that and yet-- It's a pity. Funny  it will be if my looks and your poverty prevent either of us having  her." " My own case is settled," I said decisively. " My position  and hers decide it for me." " I'd change places with you this minute if I could," muttered  Digby moodily, as steps came down to our door, and we went  forward to meet the women as they entered. It seemed to arrange itself naturally that Digby should be  occupied in the few seconds with Mrs. Long, and that I  should be free to receive Theodora. Of all the lesser emotions, there is hardly any one greater than  that subtle sense of pleasure felt when a woman we love crosses  for the  time our own threshold. We may have met her a  hundred times in her house, or on public ground, but the sensa-  tion her presence then creates is altogether different from that  instinctive, involuntary, momentary and delightful sense of  ownership that rises when she enters any room essentially our own. It is the very illusion of possession. With this hatefully egoistic satisfaction infused through me, I drew By Victoria Cross  175 drew forward for her my own favourite chair, and Theodora  sank into it, and her tiny, exquisitely-formed feet sought my  fender-rail. At a murmured invitation from me, she unfastened  and laid aside her jacket. Beneath, she revealed some purplish,  silk-like material, that seemed shot with different colours as  the firelight fell upon it. It was strained tight and smooth  upon her, and the swell of a low bosom was distinctly defined below it. There was no excessive development, quite the con-  trary, but in the very slightness there was an indescribably  sensuous curve, and a depression, rising and falling, that seemed  as if it might be the very home itself of passion. It was a  breast with little suggestion of the duties or powers of Nature,  but with infinite seduction for a lover. " What a marvellous collection you have here," she said throw-  ing her glance round the room. " What made you bring home  all these things ? " " The majority were gifts to me--presents made by the different natives whom I visited or came into connection with in various  ways. A native is never happy, if he likes you at all, until he has  made you some valuable present." " You must be very popular with them indeed," returned  Theodora, glancing from a brilliant Persian carpet, suspended on  the wall, to a gold and ivory model of a temple, on the console by  her side. " Well, when one stays with a fellow as his guest, as I have  done with some of these small rajahs and people, of course one tries  to make oneself amiable." " The fact is, Miss Dudley," interrupted Digby, " Ray  admires these fellows, and that is why they like him. Just look  at this sketch-book of his--what trouble he has taken to make  portraits of them." And 176  Theodora And he stretched out a limp-covered pocket-album of mine. I reddened slightly and tried to intercept his hand. " Nonsense, Digby. Give the book to me," I said ; but  Theodora had already taken it, and she looked at me as I spoke  with one of those delicious looks of hers that could speak so clearly.  Now it seemed to say, " If you are going to love me, you must  have no secrets from me." She opened the book and I was  subdued and let her. I did not much care, except that it was some time now since I had looked at it, and I did not know what  she might find in it. However, Theodora was so different from  girls generally, that it did not greatly matter. " Perhaps these are portraits of your different conquests amongst  the Ranees, are they ? " she said. " I don't see ' my victims,'  though, written across the outside as the Frenchmen write on  their albums." " No," I said, with a smile, " I think these are only portraits of  men whose appearance struck me. The great difficulty is to  persuade any Mohammedan to let you draw him." The very  leaf she turned seemed to give the lie to my  words. Against a background of yellow sand and blue sky, stood  out a slight figure in white, bending a little backward, and holding  in its hands, extended on either side, the masses of its black hair  that fell through them, till they touched the sand by its feet.  Theodora threw a side-glance full of derision on me, as she raised  her eyes from the page. " I swear it isn't," I said hastily, colouring, for I saw she  thought it was a woman. " It's a young Sikh I bribed to let  me paint him." " Oh, a young Sikh, is it ? " said Theodora, bending over the  book again. " Well it's a lovely face ; and what beautiful hair ! " " Yes, almost as beautiful as yours," I murmured, in safety, for the By Victoria Cross  177 the others were wholly occupied in testing the limits of the  flexibility of the soapstone. Not for any consideration in this world could I have restrained  the irresistible desire to say the words, looking at her sitting  sideways to me, noting that shining weight of hair lying on the  white neck, and that curious masculine shade upon the upper lip.  A faint liquid smile came to her face. " Mine is not so long as that when you see it undone," she said,  looking at me. " How long is it? " I asked mechanically, turning over the  leaves of the sketch-book, and thinking in a crazy sort of way  what I would not give to see her with that hair unloosed, and have  the right to lift a single strand of it. " It would not touch the ground," she answered, " it must be  about eight inches off it, I think." " A marvellous length for a European," I answered in a con-  ventional tone, though it was a difficulty to summon it. Within my brain all the dizzy thoughts seemed reeling together  till they left me hardly conscious of anything but an acute painful  sense of her proximity. " Find me the head of a Persian, will you ? " came her voice next. " A Persian ? " I repeated mechanically. Theodora looked at me wonderingly and I recalled myself. " Oh, yes," I answered, " I'll find you one. Give me the  book." I took the book and turned over the leaves towards the end.  As I did so, some of the intermediate pages caught her eye, and  she tried to arrest the turning leaves. " What is that ? Let me see." " It is nothing," I said, passing them over. " Allow me to find  you the one you want." Theodora The Yellow Book--Vol. IV.  L 178  Theodora Theodora did not insist, but her glance said : " I will be re-  venged for this resistance to my wishes ! " When I had found her the portrait, I laid the open book back  upon her knees. Theodora bent over it with an unaffected ex-  clamation of delight. " How exquisite ! and how well you have  done it ! What a talent you must have ! " " Oh no, no talent," I said hastily. " It's easy to do a thing  like that when your heart is in it." Theodora looked up at me and said simply, " This is a  woman." And I looked back in her eyes and said as simply, " Yes, it is a  woman." Theodora was silent, gazing at the open leaf, absorbed. And half-unconsciously my eyes followed hers and rested with hers on  the page. Many months had gone by since I had opened the book ; and  many, many cigars, that according to Tolstoi deaden every mental  feeling, and many, many pints of brandy that do the same thing,  only more so, had been consumed, since I had last looked upon  that face. And now I saw it over the shoulder of this woman.  And the old pain revived and surged through me, but it was dull--  dull as every emotion must be in the near neighbourhood of a  new object of desire--every emotion except one. " Really it is a very beautiful face, isn't it ? " she said at last,  with a tender and sympathetic accent, and as she raised her head  our eyes met. I looked at her and answered, " I should say yes, if we were not  looking at it together, but you know beauty is entirely a question  of comparison." Her face was really not one-tenth so handsome as the mere  shadowed, inanimate representation of the Persian girl, beneath our By Victoria Cross  179 our hands. I knew it and so did she. Theodora herself would  have been the to admit it. But nevertheless the words were  ethically true. True in the sense that underlay the society com-  pliment, for no beauty of the dead can compare with that of the  living. Such are we, that as we love all objects in their relation  to our own pleasure from them, so even in our admiration, the  greatest beauty, when absolutely useless to us, cannot move us as  a far lesser degree has power to do, from which it is possible to  hope, however vaguely, for some personal gratification. And to  this my words would come if translated. And I think Theodora  understood the translation rather than the conventional form of  them, for she did not take the trouble to deprecate the flattery. I got up, and, to change the subject, said, " Let me wheel up  that little table of idols. Some of them are rather curious." I moved the tripod up to the arm of her chair. Theodora closed the sketch-book and put it beside her, and  looked over the miniature bronze gods with interest. Then she  stretched out her arm to lift and move several of them, and her  soft fingers seemed to lie caressingly--as they did on everything  they touched--on the heads and shoulders of the images. I  watched her, envying those senseless little blocks of brass. " This is the Hindu equivalent of the Greek Aphrodite," I said,  lifting forward a small, unutterably hideous, squat female figure,  with the face of a monkey, and two closed wings of a dragon on  its shoulders. " Oh, Venus," said Theodora. " We must certainly crown  her amongst them, though hardly, I think, in this particular case,  for her beauty ! " And she laughingly slipped off a diamond half-hoop from her  middle finger, and slipped the ring on to the model's head. It  fitted exactly round the repulsive brows of the deformed and stunted 180  Theodora stunted image, and the goddess stood crowned in the centre of the  table, amongst the other figures, with the circlet of brilliants,  flashing brightly in the firelight, on her head. As Theodora  passed the ring from her own warm white finger on to the forehead  of the misshapen idol, she looked at me. The look, coupled with  the action, in my state, went home to those very inner cells of the  brain where are the springs themselves of passion. At the same  instant the laughter and irresponsible gaiety and light pleasure on  the face before me, the contrast between the delicate hand and the  repellent monstrosity it had crowned--the sinister, allegorical  significance--struck me like a blow. An unexplained feeling of  rage filled me. Was it against her, myself, her action, or my own  desires ? It seemed for the moment to burn against them all.  On the spur of it, I dragged forward to myself another of the  images from behind the Astarte, slipped oft" my own signet-ring,  and put it on the head of the idol. " This is the only one for me to crown," I said bitterly, with a  laugh, feeling myself whiten with the stress and strain of a host  of inexplicable sensations that crowded in upon me, as I met  Theodora's lovely inquiring glance. There was a shade of apprehensiveness in her voice as she said,  " What is that one ? " " Shiva," I said curtly, looking her straight in the eyes. " The  god of self-denial." I saw the colour die suddenly out of her face, and I knew I had  hurt her. But I could not help it. With her glance she had  summoned me to approve or second her jesting act. It was a  challenge I could not pass over. I must in some correspondingly  joking way either accept or reject her coronation. And to reject  it was all I could do, since this woman must be nothing to me.  There was a second's blank pause of strained silence. But, super- ficially By Victoria Cross  181 ficially, we had not strayed off the legitimate ground of mere  society nothings, whatever we might feel lay beneath them.  And Theodora was trained thoroughly in the ways of fashion. The next second she leant back in her chair, saying lightly,  " A false, absurd, and unnatural god ; it is the greatest error to  strive after the impossible ; it merely prevents you accomplishing  the possible. Gods like these," and she indicated the abominable  squint-eyed Venus, "are merely natural instincts personified, and  one may well call them gods since they are invincible. Don't  you remember the fearful punishments that the Greeks represented  as overtaking mortals who dared to resist nature's laws, that they  chose to individualise as their gods ? You remember the fate of Hippolytus who tried to disdain Venus, of Pentheus who tried to  subdue Bacchus ? These two plays teach the immortal lesson  that if you have the presumption to try to be greater than nature  she will in the end take a terrible revenge. The most we can do  is to guide her. You can never be her conqueror. Consider  yourself fortunate if she allows you to be her charioteer." It was all said very lightly and jestingly, but at the last phrase  there was a flash in her eye, directed upon me--yes, me--as if  she read down into my inner soul, and it sent the blood to my  face. As the last word left her lips, she stretched out her hand and  deliberately took my ring from the head of Shiva, put it above her  own diamonds on the other idol, and laid the god I had chosen,  the god of austerity and mortification, prostrate on its face, at the  feet of the leering Venus. Then, without troubling to find a transition phrase, she got up  and said, " I am going to look at that Persian carpet." It had all taken but a few seconds ; the next minute we were  over by the carpet, standing in front of it and admiring its hues in the 182  Theodora the most orthodox terms. The images were left as she had  placed them. I could do nothing less, of course, than yield to a  woman and my guest. The jest had not gone towards calming  my feelings, nor had those two glances of hers--the  so tender  and appealing as she had crowned the Venus, the second so virile  and mocking as she had discrowned the Shiva. There was a  strange mingling of extremes in her. At one moment she seemed will-less, deliciously weak, a thing only made to be taken in one's  arms and kissed. The next, she was full of independent uncon-  trollable determination and opinion. Most men would have found  it hard to be indifferent to her. When beside her you must either  have been attracted or repelled. For me, she was the very worst  woman that could have crossed my path. As I stood beside her now, her shoulder only a little below my  own, her neck and the line of her breast just visible to the side  vision of my eye, and heard her talking of the carpet, I felt there  was no price I would not have paid to have stood for one half-hour  in intimate confidence with her, and been able to tear the veils  from this irritating character. From the carpet we passed on to a table of Cashmere work and  next to a pile of Mohammedan garments. These had been packed  with my own personal luggage, and I should not have thought of  bringing them forth for inspection. It was Digby who, having  seen them by chance in my portmanteau, had insisted that they  would add interest to the general collection of Eastern trifles. " Clothes, my dear fellow, clothes ; why, they will probably please  her more than anything else." Theodora advanced to the heap of stuffs and lifted them. " What is the history of these ? " she said laughing. " These  were not presents to you ! " " No," I murmured. " Bought in the native bazaars." " Some By Victoria Cross  183 " Some perhaps," returned Theodora, throwing her glance over  them. " But a great many are not new." It struck me that she would not be a woman very easy to  deceive. Some men value a woman in proportion to the ease with  which they can impose upon her, but to me it is too much trouble  to deceive at all, so that the absence of that amiable quality did  not disquiet me. On the contrary, the comprehensive, cynical,  and at the same time indulgent smile that came so readily to  Theodora's lips charmed me more, because it was the promise of  even less trouble than a real or professed obtuseness. " No," I assented merely. " Well, then ? " asked Theodora, but without troubling to seek  a reply. " How pretty they are and how curious ! this one, for  instance." And she took up a blue silk zouave, covered with gold  embroidery, and worth perhaps about thirty pounds. " This has  been a good deal worn. It is a souvenir, I suppose ? " I nodded. With any other woman I was similarly anxious to  please I should have denied it, but with her I felt it did not  matter. " Too sacred perhaps, then, for me to put on ? " she asked with  her hand in the collar, and smiling derisively. " Oh dear no ! " I said, " not at all. Put it on by all means." " Nothing is sacred to you, eh ? I see. Hold it then." She gave me the zouave and turned for me to put it on her.  A glimpse of the back of her white neck, as she bent her head  forward, a convulsion of her adorable shoulders as she drew on the  jacket, and the zouave was fitted on. Two seconds perhaps,  but my self-control wrapped round me had lost one of its skins. " Now I must find a turban or fez," she said, turning over  gently, but without any ceremony, the pile. " Oh, here's one ! "  She drew out a white fez, also embroidered in gold, and, removing her 184  Theodora her hat, put it on very much to one side, amongst her black hair,  with evident care lest one of those silken inflected waves should be  disturbed ; and then affecting an undulating gait, she walked over  to the fire. " How do you like me in Eastern dress, Helen ? " she said,  addressing her sister, for whom Digby was deciphering some old  coins. Digby and I confessed afterwards to each other the  impulse that moved us both to suggest it was not at all complete  without the trousers. I did offer her a cigarette, to enhance  the effect. " Quite passable, really," said Mrs. Long, leaning back and  surveying her languidly. Theodora took the cigarette with a laugh, lighted and smoked  it, and it was then, as she leant against the mantel-piece with her  eyes full of laughter, a glow on her pale skin, and an indolent  relaxation in the long, supple figure, that I  said, or rather an  involuntary, unrecognised voice within me said, " It is no good ;  whatever happens I must have you." " Do you know that it is past six, Theo ? " said Mrs. Long. " You will let me give you a cup of tea before you go ? " I said. " Tea ! " repeated Theodora. " I thought you were going to  say haschisch or opium, at the least, after such an Indian  afternoon." " I have both," I answered, "would you like some ? " thinking,  " By Jove, I should like to see you after the haschisch." " No," replied Theodora, " I make it a rule not to get  intoxicated in public." When the women rose to go, Theodora, to my regret, divested  herself of the zouave without my aid, and declined it also for  putting on her own cloak. As they stood drawing on their gloves  I asked if they thought there was anything worthy of their acceptance By Victoria Cross  185 acceptance amongst these curiosities. Mrs. Long chose from the  table near her an ivory model of the Taj, and Digby took it up  to carry for her to the door. As he did so his eye caught the table  of images. " This is your ring, Miss Dudley, I believe," he said. I saw him grin horridly as he noted the arrangement of the  figures. Doubtless he thought it was mine. I took up my signet-ring again, and Theodora said carelessly,  without the faintest tinge of colour rising in her cheek, " Oh, yes,  I had forgotten it. Thanks." She took it from him and replaced it. I asked her if she would honour me as her sister had done. " There is one thing in this room that I covet immensely," she  said, meeting my gaze. " It is yours, of course, then," I answered. " What is it ? " Theodora stretched out her open hand. " Your sketch-book." For a second I felt the blood dye suddenly all my face. The  request took me by surprise, for one thing ; and immediately after  the surprise followed the vexatious and embarrassing thought that  she had asked for the one thing in the room that I certainly did  not wish her to have. The book contained a hundred thousand  memories, embodied in writing, sketching, and painting, of those  years in the East. There was not a page in it that did not reflect  the emotions of the time when it had been filled in, and give a  chronicle of the life lived at the date inscribed on it. It was a sort of diary in cipher, and to turn over its leaves was to re-live  the hours they represented. For my own personal pleasure I liked  the book and wanted to keep it, but there were other reasons too why  I disliked the idea of surrendering it. It flashed through me, the  question as to what her object was in possessing herself of it.  Was it jealousy of the faces or any face within it that prompted her, and 186  Theodora and would she amuse herself, when she had it, by tearing out the  leaves or burning it ? To give over these portraits merely to be  sacrificed to a petty feminine spite and malice, jarred upon me.  Involuntarily I looked hard into her eyes to try and read her  intentions, and I felt I had wronged her. The eyes were full of  the softest, tenderest light. It was impossible to imagine them  vindictive. She had seen my hesitation and she smiled faintly. " Poor Herod with your daughter of Herodias," she said, softly.  " Never mind, I will not take it." The others who had been standing with her saw there was some  embarrassment that they did not understand, and Mrs. Long  turned to go slowly down the corridor. Digby had to follow.  Theodora was left standing alone before me, her seductive figure  framed in the open doorway. Of course she was irresistible. Was  she not the new object of my desires ? I seized the sketch-book from the chair. What did anything  matter ? " Yes," I said hastily, putting it into that soft, small hand  before it could draw back. " Forgive me the hesitation. You  know I would give you anything." If she answered or thanked me, I forget it. I was sensible of  nothing at the moment but that the blood seemed flowing to my  brain, and thundering through it, in ponderous waves. Then I  knew we were walking down the passage, and in a few minutes  more we should have said good-bye, and she would be gone. An acute and yet vague realisation came upon me that the  corridor was dark, and that the others had gone on in front, a  confused recollection of the way she had lauded Nature and its  domination a short time back, and then all these were lost again  in the eddying torrent of an overwhelming desire to take her in  my arms and hold her, control her, assert my will over hers, this exasperating By Victoria Cross  187 exasperating object who had been pleasing and seducing every  sense for the last three hours, and now was leaving them all  unsatisfied. That impulse towards some physical demonstration,  that craving for physical contact, which attacks us suddenly with  its terrific impetus, and chokes and stifles us, ourselves, beneath it,  blinding us to all except itself, rushed upon me then, walking  beside her in the dark passage ; and at that instant Theodora  sighed. " I am tired," she said languidly. " May I take your arm ? "  and her hand touched me. I did not offer her my arm, I flung it round her neck, bending  back her head upon it, so that her lips were just beneath my own  as I leant over her, and I pressed mine on them in a delirium of  passion. Everything that should have been remembered I forgot. Knowledge was lost of all, except those passive, burning lips  under my own. As I touched them, a current of madness  seemed to mingle with my blood, and pass flaming through all my  veins. I heard her moan, but for that instant I was beyond the reach  of pity or reason, I only leant harder on her lips in a wild,  unheeding, unsparing frenzy. It was a moment of ecstasy that I  would have bought with years of my life. One moment, the  next I released her, and so suddenly, that she reeled against the  wall of the passage. I caught her wrist to steady her. We  dared neither of us speak, for the others were but little ahead of us ; but I sought her eyes in the dusk. They met mine, and rested on them, gleaming through the  darkness. There was no confusion nor embarrassment in them,  they were full of the hot, clear, blinding light of passion ; and I  knew there would be no need to crave forgiveness. The 188  Theodora The next moment had brought us up to the others, and to the  end of the passage. Mrs. Long turned round, and held out her hand to me. " Good-bye," she said. " We have had a most interesting  afternoon." It was with an effort that I made some conventional remark. Theodora, with perfect outward calm, shook hands with myself  and Digby, with her sweetest smile, and passed out. I lingered some few minutes with Digby, talking ; and then he  went off to his own diggings, and I returned slowly down the  passage to my rooms. My blood and pulses seemed beating as they do in fever, my  ears seemed full of sounds, and that kiss burnt like the brand of  hot iron on my lips. When I reached my rooms, I locked the  door and flung both the windows open to the snowy night. The  white powder on the ledge crumbled and drifted in. . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . .

Design for a Fan By Charles Conder A Falling Out By   Kenneth Grahame HAROLD told me the main facts of this episode, some time  later--in bits, and with reluctance. It was not a recollec-  tion he cared to talk about. The crude blank misery of a moment  is apt to leave a dull bruise which is slow to depart, if indeed it ever  does so entirely ; and Harold confesses to a twinge or two, still, at  times, like the veteran who brings home a bullet inside him from  martial plains over sea. He knew he was a brute the moment after he had done it ; Selina  had not meant to worry, only to comfort and assist. But his  soul was one raw sore within him, when he found himself shut up  in the schoolroom after hours, merely for insisting that 7 times 7  amounted to 47. The injustice of it seemed so flagrant. Why  not 47 as much as 49 ? One number was no prettier than the  other to look at, and it was evidently only a matter of arbitrary  taste and preference, and, anyhow, it had always been 47 to him,  and would be to the end of time. So when Selina came in out of the sun, leaving the Trappers of the Far West behind her, and  putting off the glory of being an Apache squaw in order to hear  him his tables and win his release, Harold turned on her venom-  ously, rejected her kindly overtures, and even drove his elbow into  her sympathetic ribs, in his determination to be left alone in the glory The Yellow Book.--Vol. IV.  M 196  A Falling Out glory of sulks. The fit passed directly, his eyes were opened, and  his soul sat in the dust as he sorrowfully began to cast about for  some atonement heroic enough to salve the wrong. Needless to say, Selina demanded no sacrifice nor heroics what-  ever ; she didn't even want him to say he was sorry. If he  would only make it up, she would have done the apologising part  herself. But that was not a boy's way. Something solid, Harold  felt, was due from him ; and until that was achieved, making up  must not be thought of, in order that the final effect might not be  spoilt. Accordingly, when his release came, and poor Selina hung  about, trying to catch his eye, Harold, possessed by the demon of a distorted motive, avoided her steadily--though he was bleeding inwardly at every minute of delay--and came to me instead. Of course I approved his plan highly; it was so much better  than just going and making it up tamely, which any one could do ;  and a girl who had been jobbed in the ribs by a hostile elbow  could not be expected for a moment to overlook it, without the  liniment of an offering to soothe her injured feelings. " I know what she wants most," said Harold. " She wants that  set of tea-things in the toy-shop window, with the red and blue  flowers on 'em ; she's wanted it for months, 'cos her dolls are  getting big enough to have real afternoon tea ; and she wants it  so badly that she won't walk that side of the street when we go  into the town. But it costs five shillings ! " Then we set to work seriously, and devoted the afternoon to a  realisation of assets and the composition of a Budget that might  have been dated without shame from Whitehall. The result  worked out as follows : By By Kenneth Grahame 197 s .  d . By one uncle, unspent through having been lost for nearly a week--turned up at last in the straw of the dog- kennel . . . . . . . . 2 6 By advance from me on security of next uncle, and failing that, to be called in at Christmas . . . . 1 0 By shaken out of missionary-box with the help of a knife- blade.

The rest promised to be easy. Selina had a tea-party at five on  the morrow, with the chipped old wooden tea-things that had  served her successive dolls from babyhood. Harold would slip  off directly after dinner, going alone, so as not to arouse  suspicion, as we were not allowed to go into the town by our-  selves. It was nearly two miles to our small metropolis, but there would be plenty of time for him to go and return, even  laden with the olive-branch neatly packed in shavings ; besides, he  might meet the butcher, who was his friend and would give him  a lift. Then, finally, at five, the rapture of the new tea-service,  descended from the skies ; and then, retribution made, making  up at last, without loss of dignity. With the event before us,  we thought it a small thing that twenty-four hours more of  alienation and pretended sulks must be kept up on Harold's part ;  but Selina, who naturally knew nothing of the treat in store for her, 198  A Falling Out her, moped for the rest of the evening, and took a very heavy  heart to bed. When next day the hour for action arrived, Harold evaded  Olympian attention with an easy modesty born of long practice,  and made off for the front gate. Selina, who had been keeping  her eye upon him, thought he was going down to the pond to catch  frogs, a joy they had planned to share together, and slipped out  after him ; but Harold, though he heard her footsteps, continued  sternly on his high mission, without even looking back ; and Selina was left to wander disconsolately among flower-beds that  had lost--for her--all scent and colour. I saw it all, and, although  cold reason approved our line of action, instinct told me we were  brutes. Harold reached the town--so he recounted afterwards--in  record time, having run most of the way for fear lest the tea-  things, which had reposed six months in the window, should be  snapped up by some other conscience-stricken lacerator of a  sister's feelings ; and it seemed hardly credible to find them still  there, and their owner willing to part with them for the price  marked on the ticket. He paid his money down at once, that  there should be no drawing back from the bargain ; and then, as the things had to be taken out of the window and packed, and  the afternoon was yet young, he thought he might treat himself  to a taste of urban joys and  la vie de Bohème . Shops came ,  of course, and he flattened his nose successively against the  window with the india-rubber balls in it, and the clock-work  locomotive : and against the barber s window, with wigs on  blocks, reminding him of uncles, and shaving-cream that looked  so good to eat ; and the grocer's window, displaying more currants  than the whole British population could possibly consume with-  out a special effort ; and the window of the bank, wherein gold was By Kenneth Grahame  199 was thought so little of that it was dealt about in shovels. Next  there was the market-place, with all its clamorous joys ; and  when a runaway calf came down the street like a cannon-ball,  Harold felt that he had not lived in vain. The whole place was  so brimful of excitement that he had quite forgotten the why and  the wherefore of his being there, when a sight of the church  clock recalled him to his better self, and sent him flying out of  the town, as he realized he had only just time enough left to get back in. If he were after his appointed hour, he would not only  miss his high triumph, but probably would be detected as a  transgressor of bounds--a crime before which a private opinion on  multiplication sank to nothingness. So he jogged along on his  homeward way, thinking of many things, and probably talking to  himself a good deal, as his habit was. He must have covered nearly  half the distance, when suddenly--a deadly sinking in the pit of the  stomach--a paralysis of every limb--around him a world extinct  of light and music--a black sun and a reeling sky--he had for-  gotten the tea-things ! It was useless, it was hopeless, all was over, and nothing could  now be done ; nevertheless he turned and ran back wildly, blindly,  choking with the big sobs that evoked neither pity nor comfort  from a merciless, mocking world around ; a stitch in his side, dust  in his eyes, and black despair clutching at his heart. So he  stumbled on, with leaden legs and bursting sides, till--as if Fate  had not yet dealt him her last worst buffet--on turning a corner  in the road he almost ran under the wheels of a dog-cart, in which,  as it pulled up, was apparent the portly form of Farmer Larkin,  the arch-enemy whose ducks he had been shying stones at that  very morning ! Had Harold been in his right and unclouded senses, he would  have vanished through the hedge some seconds earlier, rather than pain 200  A Falling Out pain the farmer by any unpleasant reminiscences which his appear-  ance might call up ; but as things were he could only stand and  blubber hopelessly, caring, indeed, little now what further ill might  befall him. The farmer, for his part, surveyed the desolate figure  with some astonishment, calling out in no unfriendly accents,  " What, Master Harold ! whatever be the matter ? Baint runnin'  away, be ee ? " Then Harold, with the unnatural courage born of desperation,  flung himself on the step, and, climbing into the cart, fell in the  straw at the bottom of it, sobbing out that he wanted to go back,  go back ! The situation had a vagueness ; but the farmer, a man  of action rather than words, swung his horse round smartly, and  they were in the town again by the time Harold had recovered  himself sufficiently to furnish some details. As they drove up to  the shop, the woman was waiting at the door with the parcel ;  and hardly a minute seemed to have elapsed since the black crisis,  ere they were bowling along swiftly home, the precious parcel  hugged in a close embrace. And now the farmer came out in quite a new and unexpected  light. Never a word did he say of broken fences and hurdles,  trampled crops and harried flocks and herds. One would have  thought the man had never possessed a head of live stock in his  life. Instead, he was deeply interested in the whole dolorous  quest of the tea-things, and sympathised with Harold on the disputed point in mathematics as if he had been himself at the  same stage of education. As they neared home, Harold found  himself, to his surprise, sitting up and chatting to his new friend  like man to man ; and before he was dropped at a convenient gap  in the garden hedge, he had promised that when Selina gave her   public tea-party, little Miss Larkin should be invited to come  and bring her whole sawdust family along with her, and the farmer By Kenneth Grahame  201 farmer appeared as pleased and proud as if he had been asked to a garden-party at Marlborough House. Really those Olympians  have certain good points, far down in them. I shall leave off  abusing them some day. At the hour of five, Selina, having spent the afternoon searching  for Harold in all his accustomed haunts, sat down disconsolately  to tea with her dolls, who ungenerously refused to wait beyond  the appointed hour. The wooden tea-things seemed more chipped  than usual ; and the dolls themselves had more of wax and saw-  dust, and less of human colour and intelligence about them, than  she ever remembered before. It was then that Harold burst in,  very dusty, his stockings at his heels, and the channels ploughed by tears still showing on his grimy cheeks ; and Selina was at last permitted to know that he had been thinking of her ever since  his ill-judged exhibition of temper, and that his sulks had not been  the genuine article, nor had he gone frogging by himself. It  was a very happy hostess who dispensed hospitality that evening to  a glassy-eyed stiff-kneed circle ; and many a dollish  gaucherie , that would have been severely checked on ordinary occasions, was as  much overlooked as if it had been a birthday. But Harold and I, in our stupid masculine way, thought all  her happiness sprang from possession of the long-coveted tea-  service. Hor. Car.

Bodley Heads No. 2:  Mr. John Davidson By Will Rothenstein Henri Beyle By   Norman Hapgood THE fact that none of his work has been translated into English  is probably a source of amused satisfaction to many of the  lovers of Beyle. Though he exercised a marked influence on  Mérimée, was wildly praised by Balzac, was discussed twice by  Sainte-Beuve, was pointed to in Maupassant's famous manifesto-  preface to  Pierre et Jean  ; though he has been twice eulogised by  Taine, and once by Bourget ; and though he has been carefully  analysed by Zola, he is read little in France and scarcely at all  elsewhere. While his name, at his death scarcely heard beyond his little circle of men of letters, has become rather prominent,  his books are still known to very few. His cool prophecy that a  few leading spirits would read him by 1880 was justified, and the  solution of his doubt whether he would not by 1930 have sunk  again into oblivion seems now at least as likely as it was then to  be an affirmative. " To the happy few," he dedicated his latest  important novel, and it will be as it has been, for the few, happy  in some meanings of that intangible word, that his character and  his writings have a serious interest. In one of the  Edinburgh Review's  essays on Mme. du Deffand  is a rather striking passage in which Jeffrey sums up the con- ditions that made conversation so fascinating in the salons of the France 208  Henri Beyle France of Louis XV. In  Rome ,  Florence ,  et Naples , published shortly afterward by Beyle, under his most familiar pseudonym  of Stendhal, is a conversation, with all the marks of a piece  of genuine evidence on the English character, between the author  and an Englishman ; and yet a large part of what is given as  the opinion of this acquaintance of Beyle is almost a literal  translation of Jeffrey's remarks on the conditions of good con-  versation. Such a striking phrase as " where all are noble all are  free " is taken without change, and the whole is stolen with almost equal thoroughness. This characteristic runs through all of  his books. He was not a scholar, so he stole his facts and many  of his opinions, with no acknowledgments, and made very pleasing  books. Related, perhaps, to this characteristic, are the inexactness of  his facts and the unreliability of his judgments. Berlioz some-  where in his memoirs gives to Stendhal half-a-dozen lines, which  run something like this : " There was present also one M. Beyle,  a short man with an enormous belly, and an expression which he  tries to make benign and succeeds in making malicious. He is  the author of a Life of Rossini, full of painful stupidities about  music." Painful indeed, to a critic with the enthusiasm and the  mastery of Berlioz, a lot of emphatic judgments from a man who was ignorant of the technique of music, who took it seriously but  lazily, and who could make such a delicious comment at the end  of a comparison of skill with inspiration, as, " What would not  Beethoven do, if, with his technical knowledge, he had the ideas  of Rossini ? " Imagine the passionate lover of the noblest  in music hearing distinctions drawn between form and idea in  music, with condescension for Beethoven, by a man who found in Cimarosa and Rossini his happiness night after night through  years. Imagine Beyle talking of grace, sweetness, softness, voluptuousness, By Norman Hapgood  209 voluptuousness, ease, tune, and Berlioz growing harsh with rage  and running away to hide from these effeminate notions in the  stern poetry of Beethoven's harmonies. Imagine them crossing  over into literature and coming there at the height to the same  name, Shakespeare. What different Shakespeares they are. Berlioz,  entranced, losing self-control for days, feeling with passion the  glowing life of the poet's words, would turn, as from something  unclean, from the man whose love for Macbeth showed itself  mostly in the citation of passages that give fineness to the feelings  which the school of Racine thought unsuited to poetry. " You use it as a thesis," the enthusiast might cry. " The grandeur,  the wealth, the terror of it escape you. You see his delicacy, his  proportion, a deeper taste than the classic French taste, and it  forges you a weapon. But you are not swept on by him, you  never get into the torrent of him, you are cool and shallow, and  your praise is profanation." Stendhal read Shakespeare with some  direct pleasure, no doubt, but he was always on the look-out for  quotations to prove some thesis, and he read Scott and Richardson,  probably all the books he read in any language, in the same  unabandoned restricted way. In painting it is the same. It is with a narrow and  dilettante   intelligence that he judges pictures. The painter who feeds  certain sentiments, he loves and thinks great. Guido Reni is suave ; therefore only one or two in the world's history can com-  pare with him. One of them is Correggio, for his true voluptuous-  ness. These are the artists he loves. Others he must praise, as  he praised Shakespeare, to support some attack on French canons of  art. Therefore is Michelangelo one of the gods. The effort is  apparent throughout, and as he recalls the fact that Mme. du  Deffand and Voltaire saw in Michelangelo nothing but ugliness,  and notes that such is the attitude of all true Frenchmen, the lover of 210  Henri Beyle of Beyle smiles at his effort to get far enough away from his own  saturated French nature to love the masculine and august painter  he is praising. Before the Moses, Mérimée tells us, Beyle could  find nothing to say beyond the observation that ferocity could not  be better depicted. This vague, untechnical point of view was no  subject of regret to Stendhal. He gloried in it. " Foolish as  a scholar," he says somewhere, and in another place, " Vinci is a  great artist precisely because he is no scholar." Add to these qualities of lack of truthfulness, lack of thorough-  ness, and lack of imagination, a total disregard for any moral view  of life, in the sense of a believing, strenuous view, and you have,  from the negative side, the general aspects of Stendhal's character.  He was not vicious--far from it--though he admires many things  that are vicious. He is not indecent, for " the greatest enemy of  voluptuousness is indecency," and voluptuousness tests all things.  The keen Duclos has said that the French are the only people among  whom it is possible for the morals to be depraved without either the  heart being depraved or the courage being weakened. It would  be almost unfair to speak of Beyle's morals as depraved, as even in  his earliest childhood he seems to have been without a touch of  any moral quality. " Who knows that the world will last a  week ? " he asks, and the question expresses well the instinct in  him that made him deny any appeal but that of his own ends.  Both morals and religion really repel him. It is impossible to  love a supreme being, he says, though we may perhaps respect  him. Indeed, he believes that love and respect never go together,  that grace, which he loves, excludes force, which he respects ; and  thus he loves Reni and respects Michelangelo. Grace and force  are the opposite sides of a sphere, and the human eye cannot see  both. As for him, he fearlessly takes sympathy and grace and  abandons nobility. In the same manner that he excludes strenuous By Norman Hapgood  211 strenuous feelings of right altogether, he makes painting, which  he thinks the nobler art, secondary to music, which is the more  comfortable. For a very sensitive man, he goes on, with real  coherence to the mind of a Beylian, painting is only a friend, while  music is a mistress. Happy indeed he who has both friend and  mistress. In some of his moods, the more austere, the nobler and  less personal tastes and virtues, interest him, for he is to some  extent interested in everything ; but except where he is supporting  one of his few fundamental theses he does not deceive himself into  thinking he likes them, and he never takes with real seriousness anything he does not like. Elevation and ferocity are the two  words he uses over and over again in explaining that Michelangelo,  alone could paint the Bible, and the very poverty of his vocabulary,  so discriminating when he is on more congenial subjects, suggests  how external was the acquaintance of Beyle with elevation or  ferocity, with Michelangelo or the Bible. He has written  entertainingly on such subjects, but it all has the sound of guess-  work. These two qualities, with which he sums up the sterner aspects of life, are perhaps not altogether separable from a , dignity, and his view of this last may throw some light on the  nature of his relations with the elevation and ferocity he praises.  Here is a passage from  Le Rouge et le Noir : " Mathilde thought  she saw happiness. This sight, all-powerful with people who  combine courageous souls with superior minds, had to fight long  against dignity and all vulgar sentiments of duty." Equally lofty  is his tone towards other qualities that are in reality part of the  same attitude ; a tone less of reproach than of simple contempt.  The heroine of  Le Rouge et le Noir  is made to argue that " it is  necessary to return in good faith to the vulgar ideas of purity and  honour." Two more of the social virtues are disposed of by him  in one extract, which, by the way, illustrates also the truly logical and 212  Henri Beyle and the apparently illogical nature of Stendhal's thought. It will  take a little reflection to see how he gets so suddenly from industry  to patriotism in the following judgment, but the coherence of the  thought will be complete to the Beylian : " It is rare that a young  Neapolitan of fourteen is forced to do anything disagreeable. All  his life he prefers the pain of want to the pain of work. The  fools from the North treat as barbarians the citizens of this country,  because they are not unhappy at wearing a shabby coat. Nothing  would seem more laughable to an inhabitant of Crotona than to  suggest his fighting to get a red ribbon in his button-hole, or to  have a sovereign named Ferdinand or William. The sentiment  of loyalty, or devotion to dynasty, which shines in the novels of  Sir Walter Scott, and which should have made him a peer, is as unknown here as snow in May. To tell the truth, I don't see  that this proves these people fools. (I admit that this idea is in  very bad taste.)" For himself, he hated his country, as he curtly  puts it, and loved none of his relatives. Patriotism, for which his  contempt is perhaps mixed with real hatred, is in his mind allied to the  most of all stupid tyrants, propriety, or, as he more often calls it,  opinion, his most violent aversion. Napoleon, he thinks, in  destroying the custom of  cavaliere serviente  simply added to the  world's mass of  ennui  by ushering into Italy the flat religion of pro-  priety. He is full of such lucid observations as that the trouble with  opinion is that it takes a hand in private matters, whence comes  the sadness of England and America. To this sadness of the  moral countries and the moral people he never tires of referring.  His thesis carries him so far that he bunches together Veronese and  Tintoretto under the phrase, " painters without ideal," in whom  there is something dry, narrow, reasonable, bound by propriety ;  in a word, incapable of rapture. This referring to some general  standard, this lack of directness, of fervour, of abandonment, is illustrated By Norman Hapgood  213 illustrated by the Englishman's praise of his mistress, that there  was nothing vulgar in her. It would take, Beyle says, eight days  to explain that to a Milanese, and then he would have a fit of  laughter. These few references illustrate fairly the instincts and beliefs  that are the basis of Stendhal's whole thought and life. The  absolute degree of moral scepticism that is needed to make a  sympathetic reader of him is--especially among people refined  and cultivated enough to care for his subjects--everywhere rare.  I call it a moral rather than an intellectual scepticism, because,  while he would doubtless deny the possibility of knowing the  best good of the greatest number, a more ultimate truth is that he  is perfectly indifferent to the good of the greatest number. It is  unabashed egotism. The assertion of his individual will, absolute  loyalty to his private tastes, is his principle of thought and action,  and his will and his tastes do not include the rest of the world,  and its desires. " What is the ME ? I know nothing about it. One day I awoke upon this earth, I found myself united to a  certain body, a certain fortune. Shall I go into the vain amuse-  ment of wishing to change them, and in the meantime forget to  live ? That is to be a dupe ; I submit to their failings. I  submit to my aristocratic bent, after having declaimed for ten  years, in good faith, against all aristocracy. I adore Roman noses, and yet, if I am a Frenchman, I resign myself to having  received from heaven only a Champagne nose : what can I do  about it ? The Romans were a great evil for humanity, a deadly  disease which retarded the civilisation of the world .... In spite  of so many wrongs, my heart is for the Romans." Thus, in all  the details of his extended comparison, Beyle tries to state with  fairness the two sides, the general good and the personal, the need  of obedience to its rules if some general ends of society are to be attained The Yellow Book--Vol. IV.  N 214  Henri Beyle attained, and the individual's loss from obedience. He states with  fairness, but his own choice is never in doubt. He goes to what  directly pleases him. " Shall I dare to talk of the bases of  morals ? From the accounts of my comrades I believe that there  are as many deceived husbands at Paris as at Boulogne, at Berlin  as at Rome. The whole difference is that at Paris the sin is caused  by vanity, and at Rome by climate. The only exception I find  is in the middle classes in England, and all classes at Geneva. But, upon my honour, the drawback in  ennui  is too great. I  prefer Paris. It is gay." His tastes, his sympathies, are unhesi-  tatingly with the Roman in the following judgment : " A  Roman to whom you should propose to love always the same  woman, were she an angel, would exclaim that you were taking  from him three-quarters of what makes life worth while. Thus,  at Edinburgh, the family is , and at Rome it is a detail. If  the system of the Northern people sometimes begets the mono-  tony and the  ennui  that we read on their faces, it often causes a  calm and continuous happiness." This steady contrast is noted  by his mind merely, his logical fairness. His mind is judicial in a  sort of negative, formal sense ; judicial without weight, we  might almost say. He does not feel, or see imaginatively, sympathetically, the advantages of habitual constancy. He feels  only the truths of the other side, or the side of truth which he  expresses when he says that all true passion is selfish : and  passion and its truth are the final test for him. This selfishness,  which is even more self-reliance than it is self-seeking, which has  his instinctive approval in all moods, is directly celebrated by him  in most. The more natural genius and originality one has, he  says, the more one feels the profound truth of the remark of the  Duchesse de Ferté, that she found no one but herself who was always right. And not only does natural genius, which we might By Norman Hapgood  215 might sum up as honesty to one's instincts, or originality, make  us contemptuous of all judgments but our own ; it leads us (so  far does Beyle go) to esteem only ourselves. Reason, he argues,  or rather states, makes us see, and prevents our acting, since  nothing is worth the effort it costs. Laziness forces us to prefer  ourselves, and in others it is only ourselves that we esteem. With this principle as his broadest generalisation it is not un-  natural that his profoundest admiration was for Napoleon. I am  a man, he says in substance, who has loved a few painters, a few  people, and respected one man--Napoleon. He respected a man  who knew what he wanted, wanted it constantly, and pursued it  fearlessly, without scruples and with intelligence, with constant  calculation, with lies, with hypocrisy, with cruelty. Beyle  used to lie with remarkable ease even in his youth. He makes  his almost autobiographical hero, Julien Sorel, a liar throughout  and a hypocrite on the very day of his execution. Beyle lays  down the judgments about Napoleon, that he liked argument, because he was strong in it, and that he kept his peace, like a  savage, whenever there was any possibility of his being seen to be  inferior to any one else in grasp of the topic under discussion. It  is in his Life of Napoleon that Beyle dwells as persistently as any-  where on his never-ceasing principle : examine yourself ; get at your  most spontaneous, indubitable tastes, desires, ambitions ; follow  them ; act from them unceasingly ; be turned aside by nothing. It is possible, in going through Beyle's works for that purpose,  to find a remark here and there that might possibly indicate a  basis of faith under this insistence, a belief that in the end a thorough  independence of aim in each individual would be for the good of  all ; but these passing words really do not go against the truth  of the statement that Beyle was absolutely without the moral  attitude ; that the pleasing to himself immediately was all he gave interest 216  Henri Beyle interest to, and that of the intellectual qualities those that had  beauty for him were the crueller ones--force, concentration,  sagacity, in the service of egotism. But here are a few of the  possible exceptions. " Molière," he says, in a dispute about that  writer's morality, " painted with more depth than the other poets.  Therefore, he is more moral. Nothing could be more simple."  With this epigram he leaves the subject ; but it is tolerably clear  that he means to deny any other moral than truth, not to say that the  truth is an inevitable servant of good. If it did mean the latter, it was  thrown off at the moment as an easy argument, for his belief is pro-  nounced through his works, that his loves are the world's banes, and  that any interest in the world's good, in the moral law, is bour- geois and dull. Here is another phrase that perhaps might suggest  that the generalisation was unsafe : " He is the greatest man in  Europe because he is the only honest man." This, like the other,  is clear enough to a reader of him ; and it is really impossible to  find in him any identification of the interesting, the worthy,  with the permanently and generally serviceable. Where the  social point of view is taken for a moment it is by grace of logic  purely, for a formal fairness. A more unmitigated moral rebel, a  more absolute sceptic, a more thoroughly isolated individual than  the author of  Le Rouge et le Noir  could not exist. Nor could  a more unhesitating dogmatist exist, despite his sneering apologies,  for dogmatism is as natural an expression of absolute scepticism as  it is of absolute faith. When a man refuses to say anything  further than, " This is true for me, at this moment," or perhaps,  " This is true of a man exactly such as I describe, in exactly these  circumstances," he is likely to make these statements with un-  shakable firmness. This distinctness and coherence of the mind,  which is entirely devoted to relativity, is one of the charms of  Stendhal for his lovers. It makes possible the completeness and the By Norman Hapgood  217 the originality of a perfect individual, of an entirely unrestrained  growth. It is the kind of character that we call capricious or  fantastic when it is weak, but when it is strong it has a value for  us through its emphasis of interesting principles which we do not  find so visible and disentangled in more conforming people. The  instincts which in Stendhal have such a free field to expatiate seem  to some readers rare and distinguished, and to these readers it is a  delight to see them set in such high relief. This, in its most  general aspect, is what gave him his short-lived glory among the  young writers of France. They hailed him as the discoverer of  the doctrine of relativity, or as the  who applied it to the par-  ticular facts they wished to emphasise--the environment and its  influence on the individual. This has been overworked by great  men and little men until we grow sad at the sound of the word ;  but it was not so in Beyle's time, and he used the principle with  moderation, seldom or never forgetting the incalculable and inex-  plicable accidents of individual variations. He does not forget  either that individuals make the environment, and he is really  clearer than his successors in treating race-traits, the climate and  the local causes, individual training, and individual idiosyncrasies, as  a great mixed whole, in which the safest course is to stick pretty closely to the study of the completed product. For this reason  Zola very properly removed him from the pedestal on which Taine  had put him, for what is a solvent of all problems to the school  for which Taine hoped to be the prophet is in Stendhal but one  principle, in its place on an equality with others. Zola's analysis  of this side of Beyle is really masterly ; and he proves without  difficulty that the only connection between Beyle and the present  naturalists is one of creed, not of execution--that Beyle did not  apply the principle he believed in. The setting of his scenes is not distinct. Sometimes it is not even sketched in ; and here Zola 218  Henri Beyle Zola draws an illustration from a strong scene in  Le Rouge et le  Noir , and shows how different the setting would have been  in his own hands. Beyle is a logician, abstract ; Zola thinks him-  self concrete, and concrete he is--often by main force. This is a  sad failure to apply the doctrine of relativity to oneself. Beyle errs sometimes in the same way, and some of his attempts at local  colour are very tiresome, but on the whole he remains frankly the  analyser, the introspective psychologist, the man of distinct but  disembodied ideas. He recognised the environment as he recog-  nised other things in his fertile reflections, but he was as a rule  too faithful to his own principles to spend much time in trying to  reproduce it in details which did not directly interest him. It  was therefore natural that his celebration by the extremists should  be short-lived. Most of them do him what justice they can with  effort, like Zola, or pass him over with some such word as the  " dry " of Goncourt. His fads were his own. None of them  have yet become the fads of a school, though some principles that  were restrained with him have become battle-cries in later times.  His real fads are hardly fitted to be banners, for they are too  specific. In very general theories he generally kept rather sane.  His real difference from the school that claimed him for a father  half a century after his death, is well suggested in the awkward  word that Zola is fond of throwing at him, " ideologist." The idea, the abstract truth and the intellectual form of it, its clearness, its stateableness, its cogency and consistency, is the final interest  with him. The outer world is only the material for the ex-  pression of ideas, only the illustrations of them, and the ideas are  therefore not pictorial or dramatic, but logical. The arts are  ultimately the expression of thought and feeling, and colour and  plastic form are means only. You never find him complaining,  as his friend Mérimée did, that the meaning of the plastic arts cannot By Norman Hapgood  219 cannot be given in words because for a slight difference in shade  or in curve there is no expression in language. All that Beyle  got out of art he could put into words. He made no attempt to  compete with the painter like the leading realists of the past half-  century. Other arts interested him only as far as they formed,  without straining, illustrations for expression in language of the  feelings they appeal to. It was with him in music as it was in  painting, and often his musical criticism is as charming to the unattached  dilettante  as it is annoying to the technical critic who  judges it in its own forms. Beyle names the sensation with  precision always. His vocabulary has fine shades without weakening  fluency. In choosing single words to name single sensations is  his greatest power, and it is a power which naturally belongs to a man whose eye is inward, a power which the word-painters of the  environment lack. Everything is expression for Beyle, and  within the limits of the verbally-expressible he steadfastly remains.  His truth is truth to the forms of thought as they exist in the  reason--the clear eighteenth-century reason--disembodied truth.  " It is necessary to have bones and blood in the human machine  to make it walk. But we give slight attention to these necessary  conditions of life, to fly to its great end, its final result--to think  and to feel. " That is the history of drawing, of colour, of light and shade,  of all the various parts of painting, compared to expression. " Expression is the whole of art." This reminds one again of Mérimée's statement, that Beyle  could see in the Moses nothing but the expression of ferocity;  and an equally conclusive assertion (for it is in him no confession)  is made by Beyle in reference to music, which he says is excellent  if it gives him elevated thoughts on the subjects that are occupying  him, and if it makes him think of the music itself it is mediocre. Thus 220  Henri Beyle Thus Beyle is as far from being an artist as possible. He cares  for the forms of the outer world, he spends his life in looking at  beauty and listening to it, but only because he knows that that is  the way to call up in himself the ideas, the sensations, the  emotions that he loves almost with voluptuousness. The basis of  genius, he says, in speaking of Michelangelo, is logic, and if this  is true--as in the sense in which he used it, it probably is--Beyle's  genius was mostly basis. Mérimée says that though Beyle was constantly appealing to  logic, he reached his conclusions not by his reason but by his  imagination. This is certainly making a false distinction. Beyle  was not a logician in the sense that he got at conclusions indirectly  by syllogisms. He did not forget his premisses in the interest of  the inductive process. What he calls logic is an attitude or quality  of the mind, and means really abstract coherence. Of what he  himself calls ideology, with as much contempt as Zola could put  into the word, he says that it is a science not only tiresome but impertinent. He means any constructive, deductive system of  thought. He studied Kant and other German metaphysicians,  and thought them shallow--superior men ingeniously building  houses of cards. His feet seldom if ever got off the solid ground  of observations into the region of formal, logical deduction.  " Facts ! facts ! " he cried, and his love of facts at  hand,  keeps him from some of the defects of the abstract mind. Every  statement is independent of the preceding and the succeeding  ones, each is examined by itself, each illustrated by anecdote,  inexact enough, to be sure, but clear. There is no haze in his  thought. When Mérimée says that it is Beyle's imagination and  not his logic that decides, he is right, in the sense that Beyle has  no middle terms, that his vision is direct, that the  a priori process  is secondary and merely suggestive with him. " What should we logically By Norman Hapgood  221 logically expect to find the case here ? " he will ask before a new  set of facts, but if his expectation and his observation differ, he  readjusts his principles. It is no paradox to call a mind both  abstract and empirical, introspective and scientific ; and Beyle's  was both. This quality of logic without constructiveness shows, of course,  in his style. There is lucidity of transition, of connection, of  relation, among the details, but the parts are not put together to  form an artistic whole. They fall on to the paper from his mind  direct, and the completed book has no other unity than has the  mind of the author. As he was a strong admirer of Bacon and  his methods, it is safe enough to say that he would have accepted  entirely this statement about composition as his own creed : " ly, whereas I could have digested these rules into a certain  method or order, which, I know, would have been more admired,  as that which would have made every particular rule, through its  coherence and relation unto other rules, seem more cunning and  more deep ; yet I have avoided so to do, because this delivering of  knowledge in distinct and disjoined aphorisms doth leave the wit  of man more free to turn and toss, and to make use of that which  is so delivered to more several purposes and applications." He is  the typical suggestive critic, formless, uncreative, general and specific, precise and abstract : chaotic to the artist, satisfactory to  the psychologist. It makes no difference where the story begins,  whether this sentence follows that, or where the chapter ends.  There are no rules of time and place. His style is a series of  epigrams, and the order of their presentation is almost accidental.  " To draw out a plot freezes me," he says, and one could guess it  from his stories, which are in all essentials like his essays. To  this analytic, unplastic mind the plot, the characters, are but  illustrations of the general truths. The characters he draws have separate 222  Henri Beyle separate individual life only so far as they are copies. There is  no invention, no construction, no creation. Moreover, there is no  style, or no other quality of style than lucidity. He not only  lacks other qualities, he despises them. The " neatly turned "  style and the rhetorical alike have his contempt. Most rhetoricians  are " emphatic, eloquent, and declamatory." He almost had a  duel about Chateaubriand's " cime indéterminée des forêts." Rous-  seau is particularly irritating to him. " Only a great soul knows  how to write simply, and that is why Rousseau has put so much rhetoric into the New Eloïse, which makes it unreadable after  thirty years." In another place he says he detests, in the arrange-  ment of words, tragic combinations, which are intended to give  majesty to the style. He sees only absurdity in them. His style  fits his thought, and his failure to comprehend colour in style is  not surprising in a man whose thought has no setting, in a man  who remarks with scorn that it is easier to describe clothing than  it is to describe movements of the soul. He cares only for move-  ments of the soul. The sense of form might have given his work  a larger life, but it is part of his rare value for a few that he talks  in bald statements, single-word suggestions, disconnected flashes.  This intellectual impressionism, as it were, is more stimulating to  them than any work of art. These are not poetic souls, it is  needless to say, however much they may love poetry. Beyle is  the essence of prose and it is his strength. He loved poetry, but  he got from it only the prose, so much of the idea as is in-  dependent of the form, Mérimée tells us that Beyle murdered  verse in reading aloud, and in his treatise  De l'Amour  he informs us  that verse was invented to help the memory and to retain it in  dramatic art is a remnant of barbarity. The elevation, the abandon , the passion of poetry--all but the psychology--were  foreign to this mind, whose unimaginative prose is its distinction. Perhaps By Norman Hapgood  223 Perhaps this limitation is kin to another : that as novelist Beyle  painted with success only himself. Much the solidest of his  characters is Julien Sorel, a copy trait for trait of the author,  reduced, so to speak, to his essential elements. Both Julien and  Beyle were men of restless ambition, clear, colourless minds, and  constant activity. Julien turned this activity to one thing, the  study of the art of dominating women, and Beyle to three, of  which this was the principal, and the other two were the compre- hension of art principles and the expression of them. In his  earlier days he had followed the army of Napoleon, until he  became disgusted with the grossness of the life he saw. What  renown he won in the army was for making his toilet with com-  plete care on the eve of battle. From the Moscow army he wrote  to one of his friends that everything was lacking which he needed,  " friendship, love (or the semblance of it), and the arts. " For sim-  plicity, friendship may be left out in summing up Beyle's interests,  for while his friendships were genuine they did not interest him  much, except as an opportunity to work up his ideas. Of the two interests that remain, the one expressed in Julien, the psychology  of love, illustrated by practice, is much the more essential. Julien  too had Napoleon for an ideal, and when he found he could not  imitate him in the letter he resigned himself to making in his  spirit the conquests that were open to him. The genius that  Napoleon put into political relations he would put into social  ones. All the principles of war should live again in his intrigues  with women. This spirit is well enough known in its outlines. Perhaps the  most perfect sketch of it in its unmixed form is in  Les Liaisons Dangereuses , a book which Beyle knew and must have loved. He must have admired and envied the Comte de Valmont and the  Marquise de Merteuil. There is here none of the grossness of the Restoration 224  Henri Beyle Restoration comedy in England. It is the art of satisfying  vanity in a particular way, in its most delicate form. It is  an occupation and an art as imperative, one might almost say as  impersonal, were not the paradox so violent, as any other. What  makes Stendhal's account of this art differ from that of Delaclos  and the other masters is the fact that, deeply as he is in it, he is  half outside of it : he is the psychologist every moment, seeing  his own attitude as coldly as he sees the facts on which he is forming his campaign. Read the scene, for instance, where  Julien takes the hand of the object of his designs, absolutely  as a matter of duty, a disagreeable move necessary to the success  of the game. The cold, forced spirit of so much of intrigue is  clearly seen by Beyle and accepted by him as a necessity. He  used to tell young men that if they were alone in a room five  minutes with a beautiful woman without declaring they loved her,  it proved them poltroons. Two sides of him, however, are always present ; for this is the same man who repeats for ever in his book  the cry that there is no love in France. He means that this  science, better than no love at all, is inferior to the  abandon  of  the Italians. The love of 1770, for which he often longs, with  its gaiety, its tact, its discretion, " with the thousand qualities of savoir-vivre ," is after all only second.  Amour-gout , to point out  the distinction in two famous phrases of his own, is for ever  inferior to  amour-passion . Stendhal, admiring the latter, must have  been confined to the former, though not in its baldest form, for  to some of the skill and irony of Valmont he added the softness,  the sensibility, of a later generation, and he added also the will to  feel, so that his study of feeling and his practice of it grew more  successful together. Psychology and sensibility are mutual aids  in him, as they not infrequently are in " observers of the  human heart," to quote his description of his profession. " What consideration By Norman Hapgood  225 consideration can take precedence, in a sombre heart, of the never-  flagging charm of being loved by a woman who is happy and  gay ? " The voluptuary almost succeeds in looking as genuine as  the psychologist. " This nervous fluid, so to speak, has each day  but a certain amount of sensitiveness to expend. If you put it  into the enjoyment of thirty beautiful pictures you shall not use  it to mourn the death of an adored mistress." You cannot dis-  entangle them. Love, voluptuousness, art, psychology, sincerity, effort, all are mixed up together, whatever the ostensible subject.  It is a truly French compound, perhaps made none the less  essentially French by the author's constant berating of his country  for its consciousness and vanity : a man who would be uneasy if  he were not exercising his fascinating powers on some woman,  and a man whose tears were ready ; a man who could not live with-  out action, soaking in the  dolce far niente  ; a man all intelligence,  and by very force of intelligence a man of emotion. He would  be miserable if he gave himself up to either side. " In the things  of sentiment perhaps the most delicate judges are found at Paris--  but there is always a little chill." He goes to Italy, and as he  voluptuously feels the warm air and sees the warm blood and the  free movements, the simplicity of heedlessness and passion, his  mind goes back longingly to the other things. " All is decadence here, all in memory. Active life is in London and in Paris.  The days when I am all sympathy I prefer Rome : but staying  here tends to weaken the mind, to plunge it into stupor. There  is no effort, no energy, nothing moves fast. Upon my word, I  prefer the active life of the North and the bad taste of our  barracks." But among these conflicting ideals it is possible perhaps to pick the strongest, and I think it is painted in this  picture : " A delicious salon, within ten steps of the sea, from  which we are separated by a grove of orange-trees. The sea breaks 226  Henri Beyle breaks gently, Ischia is in sight. The ices are excellent." The  last touch seems to me deliciously characteristic. What is more  subtle to a man whose whole life is an experiment in taste, what  more suggestive, what more typical, than an ice ? There is a per-  vading delight in it, in the unsubstantiality, the provokingness, the  refinement of it. " In the boxes, toward the middle of the  evening, the  cavaliere servante  of the lady usually orders some ices.  There is always some wager, and the ordinary bets are sherbets,  which are divine. There are three kinds,  gelati ,  crepè  and pezzidiere . It is an excellent thing to become familiar with. I  have not yet determined the best kind, and I experiment every  evening." Do not mistake this for playfulness. The man who cannot take an ice seriously cannot take Stendhal sympathetically. Such, in the rough, is the point of view of this critic of character  and of art. Of course the value of judgments from such a man in  such an attitude is dependent entirely on what one seeks from  criticism. Here is what Stendhal hopes to give : " My end is to  make each observer question his own soul, disentangle his own  manner of feeling, and thus succeed in forming a judgment for  himself, a way of seeing formed in accord with his own character,  his tastes, his ruling passions, if indeed he have passions, for  unhappily they are necessary to judge the arts." The word  " passion," here as elsewhere, is not to be given too violent a  meaning. " Emotion " would do as well--sincere personal feeling.  That there is no end of art except to bring out this sincere  individual feeling is his ultimate belief. He is fond of the story  of the young girl who asked Voltaire to hear her recite, so as to  judge of her fitness for the stage. Astonished at her coldness,  Voltaire said : " But, mademoiselle, if you yourself had a lover  who abandoned you, what would you do ? " " I would take  another," she answered. That, Stendhal adds, is the correct point of By Norman Hapgood  227 of view for nineteen-twentieths of life, but not for art. " I care  only for genius, for young painters with fire in the soul and open  intelligence." For disinterested, cool taste, for objective justness  and precision, he has only contempt. Indeed, he accepts Goethe's  definition of taste as the art of properly tying one's cravats in  things of the mind. Everything that is not special to the speaker,  personal, he identifies with thinness, insincerity, pose. " The best  thing one can bring before works of art, is a natural mind. One  must dare to feel what he does feel." To be one's self, the   of rules, means to follow one's primitive sentiments. " Instead of  wishing to judge according to literary principles, and defend correct doctrines, why do not our youths content themselves with  the fairest privilege of their age, to have sentiments ? " There is  no division into impersonal judgment and private sentiment. The  only criticism that has value is private, personal, intimate. Less special to Stendhal now, though rare at the time in which  he lived, is the appeal to life as the basis of art. " To find the  Greeks, look in the forests of America." Go to the swimming-  school or the ballet to realise the correctness and the energy of  Michelangelo. Familiarity is everything. " The work of  genius is the sense of conversation," and as " the man who takes  the word of another is a cruel bore in a salon, " so is he as a critic.  " What is the antique bas-relief to me ? Let us try to make good  modern painting. The Greeks loved the nude. We never see it,  and moreover it repels us." This conclusion shows the weakness,  or the limitation, of this kind of criticism, which as Stendhal  applies it would keep us from all we have learned from the revived  study of the nude, because the  impression to one unused to  seeing it is not an artistic one. But the limitations of Stendhal and  his world are obvious enough. It is his eloquence and usefulness  within his limits that are worth examination. " Beauty," 228  Henri Beyle " Beauty," to Stendhal, " is simply a promise of happiness," and  the phrase sums up his attitude. Here is his ideal way of taking  music. He asked a question of a young woman about somebody  in the audience. The young woman usually says nothing during the  evening. To his question she answered, " Music pleases when it  puts your soul in the evening in the same position that love put it  in during the day." Beyle adds : " Such is the simplicity of language and of action.  I did not answer, and I left her. When one feels music in such a  way, what friend is not importunate ? " When he leaves this field  for technical judgments he is laughable to any one who does not  care for the texture of his mind, whatever his expression ; for  music to him is really only a background for his sensibility.  " How can I talk of music without giving the history of my  sensations ? " This is, doubtless, maudlin to the sturdy masculine mind, this religion of sensibility, this fondling of one's sentimental susceptibilities, and it certainly has no grandeur and no morality.  " Sensibility," Coleridge says, " that is, a constitutional quickness  of sympathy with pain and pleasure, and a keen sense of the  gratifications that accompany social intercourse, mutual endear-  ments, and reciprocal preferences .... sensibility is not even a  sure pledge of a good heart, though among the most common  meanings of that many-meaning and too commonly misapplied  expression." It leads, he goes on, to effeminate sensitiveness by  making us alive to trifling misfortunes. This is just, with all its severity, and the lover of Stendhal has only to smile, and quote  Rousseau, with Beyle himself: " I must admit that I am a great  booby ; for I get all my pleasure in being sad." Naturally enough, ennui plays a great part in such a nature,  thin, intelligent, sensitive, immoral, self-indulgent. It lies behind  his art of love and his love of art. " Ennui, this great motive power By Norman Hapgood  229 power of intelligent people," he says ; and again : " I was much  surprised when, studying painting out of pure ennui, I found it a balm  for cruel sorrows." He really loves it. " Ennui ! the god whom I  implore, the powerful god who reigns in the hall of the  Français ,  the only power in the world that can cause the Laharpes to be  thrown into the fire." Hence his love for Madame du Deffand,  the great expert in ennui, and for the whole century of ennui,  wit, and immorality. Certainly the lack of all fire and enthu-  siasm, the lack of faith, of hope, of charity, does go often with a  clear, sharp, negative freshness of judgment, which is often seen  in the colder, finer, smaller workmen in the psychology of social  relations. It is a great exposer of pretence. It enables Stendhal  to see that most honest Northerners say in their hearts before the  statues of Michelangelo, " Is that all ? " as they say before their  accomplished ideal, " Good Lord ! to be happy, to be loved, is it  only this ? " But just as Stendhal keeps in the borderland between vice and  virtue, shrinking from grossness, and laughing at morality, so he  cannot really cross into the deepest unhappiness any more than he  could into passionate happiness. Tragedy repelled him. " The  fine arts ought never to try to paint the inevitable ills of humanity.  They only increase them, which is a sad success .... Noble and  almost consoled grief is the only kind that art should seek to  produce." To these half-tones his range is limited through the  whole of his being. Of his taste in architecture, of which he  was technically as ignorant as he was of music, Mérimée tells us  that he disliked Gothic, thinking it ugly and sad, and liked the  architecture of the Renaissance for its elegance and coquetry ;  that it was always graceful details, moreover, and not the general  plan that attracted him ; which is a limitation that naturally goes  with the other. Of The Yellow Book--Vol. IV.  O 230  Henri Beyle Of course the charm and the limitations that are everywhere  in Beyle's art criticism are the same in his judgments of national  traits, which form a large part of his work. Antipathy to the  French is one of his fixed ideas, thorough Frenchman that he was ;  for his own vanity and distrust did not make him hate the less  genuinely those weaknesses. Vanity is bourgeois, he thinks, and  there is for him no more terrible word. It spoils the best things,  too--conversation among others ; for the French conversation is  work. " The most tiresome defect in our present civilisation is  the desire to produce effect." So with their bravery, their love,  all is calculated, there is no abandonment. This annoys him  particularly in the women, who are always the most important  element to him. He gives them their due, but coldly : " France,  however, is always the country where there are always the most  passable women. They seduce by delicate pleasures made  possible by their mode of dress, and these pleasures can be appre-  ciated by the most passionless natures. Dry natures are afraid of  Italian beauty." Of course this continual flinging at the French is only partly vanity, self-glorification in being able, almost alone  of foreigners, to appreciate the Italians. It is partly contempt  for his leading power, for mere intelligence. In his youth he  spoke with half-regret of his being so reasonable that he would go  to bed to save his health even when his head was crowded with  ideas that he wanted to write. It was his desperate desire to be  as Italian as he could, rather than any serene belief that he had  thrown off much of his French nature, that made him leave  orders to have inscribed on his tombstone : Qui Giace Arrigo Beyle Milanese Visse, scrisse, amò. It By Norman Hapgood  231 It comes dangerously near to a pose, perhaps, and yet there is  genuineness enough in it to make it pathetic. He praises the  Italians because they do not judge their happiness. He never  ceased to judge his. Nowhere outside of Italy, he thinks, can  one hear with a certain accent, " O Dio ! com'e bello ! " But  the implication is quite unfair. I have heard a common French- woman exclaim, under her breath, before an ugly peacock,  " Dieu ! comme c'est beau," with an intensity that was not less  because it was restrained. But restraint was Beyle's bugbear.  From his own economical, calculating nature he flew almost with  worship to its opposite. He is speaking of Julien, and therefore  of himself, when he says, in  Le Rouge et le Noir  : "Intellectual  love has doubtless more cleverness than true love, but it has only  moments of enthusiasm. It knows itself too well. It judges  itself unceasingly. Far from driving away thought, it exists  only by force of thought." He calls Julien mediocre, and he  says of him : " This dry soul felt all of passion that is possible in a person raised in the midst of this excessive civilisation which  Paris admires." Beyle saves Julien from contempt at the end  (and doubtless he consoled himself with something similar) by  causing him, while remaining a conscious hypocrite, to lose his  life unhesitatingly, absurdly, perversely, for the sake of love.  Once he has shown himself capable of the divine unreason, of  exaltation, he is respectable. Where the enthusiasm is he is  blinded ; he cannot see the crudity and stupidity of passion. Before this mad enthusiasm the French fineness and proportion is insignificant. He loses his memory of the charm he has told so  well. " Elsewhere there is no conception of this art of giving  birth to the laugh of the mind, and of giving delicious joys by  unexpected words." As might be expected, Beyle is even more unfair to the Germans 232  Henri Beyle Germans than he is to his countrymen ; for the sentiment, of  which he is the epicure and the apologist has nothing in common  with the reverent and poetic sentiment in which the Germans are  so rich. This last Beyle hates as he hates Rousseau and Madame  de Staël. It is phrase, moonshine, and the fact that it is bound up  in a stable and orderly character but makes it the more irritating.  They are sentimental, innocent, and unintelligent, he says, and he  quotes with a sneer, as true of the race : " A soul honest, sweet,  and peaceful, free of pride and remorse, full of benevolence and  humanity, above the nerves and the passions." In short, quite anti-Beylian, quite submissive, sweet, and moral. For England  he has much more respect and even a slight affection. He likes  their anti-classicism, and he likes especially the beauty of their  women, which he thinks second only to that of the Italians. The  rich complexions, the free, open countenances, the strong forms  rouse him sometimes almost to enthusiasm ; but of course it is all  secondary in the inevitable comparison. " English beauty seems  paltry, without soul, without life, before the divine eyes which  heaven has given to Italy." The somewhat in the submissive  faces of the Englishwomen that threatens future ennui, Stendhal  thinks has been ingrained there by the workings of the terrible  law of propriety which rules as a despot over the unfortunate  island. It is the vision of caprice in the face of the Italian  woman that makes him certain of never being bored. It is not surprising that women should be the objects through  which Beyle sees everything. A man who sees in relativity,  arbitrariness, caprice, the final law of nature, and who feels a sym-  pathy with this law, not unnaturally finds in the absolute, personal,  perverse nature of women his most congenial companionship. He  finds in women something more elemental than reasonableness.  He finds the basal instincts. They best illustrate his psychology of By Norman Hapgood  233 of final, absolute choice. Of course there is the other side too,  the epicure's point of view, from which their charm is the centre  of the paradise of leisure, music, and ices. His hyperbole in  praising art is " equal to the  handshake of the woman one  loves." In politics he sees largely the relations of sex ; and in  national character it is almost always of the women he is talking.  Their influence marks the advance of civilisation. " Tenderness  has made progress among us because society has become more  perfect," and tenderness here is this soft or, if you choose,  effeminate, sensibility. " The admission of women to perfect equality would be the surest sign of civilisation. It would double  the intellectual forces of the human race and its probabilities of happiness..... To attain equality, the source of happiness for  both sexes, the duel would have to be open to women ; the pistol  demands only address. Any woman, by subjecting herself to  imprisonment for two years would be able, at the expiration of the  term, to get a divorce. Towards the year Two Thousand these ideas  will be no longer ridiculous." In this passage is the whole man, intelligent and fantastic, sincere  and suspicious, fresh, convincing, absurd. He is rapidly settling  back into obscurity, to which he is condemned as much by the  substance of his thought as by the formlessness of its expression.  Entirely a rebel, and only slightly a revolutionist, he is treated by  the world as he treated it. A lover of many interesting things  inextricably wound up together, his earnest talk about them will  perhaps for some time longer be an important influence on the lives  of a few whose minds shall be of the kind to which a sharp,  industrious, capricious, and rebellious individual is the best stimulant  to their own thought. Day and Night By   E. Nesbit ALL day the glorious Sun caressed Wide meadows and white winding way, And on the Earth's soft heaving breast Heart-warm his royal kisses lay. She looked up in his face and smiled, With mists of love her face seemed dim ; The golden Emperor was beguiled, To dream she would be true to him. Yet was there, 'neath his golden shower, No end of love for him astir ; She waited, dreaming, for the hour When Night, her love, should come to her ; When 'neath Night's mantle she should creep And feel his arms about her cling, When the soft tears true lovers weep Should make amends for everything. Plein Air By Miss Sumner A Thief in the Night By   Marion Hepworth Dixon SHE had watched the huge rectangular shadow of the water-  jug on the ceiling for over an hour and three-quarters, and  still the nightlight on the washstand burnt uneasily on to the  accompaniment of her husband's heavy breathing. The room  had loomed black and foreboding on blowing out the candles an hour  or two ago, but now the four white walls, hung here and there  with faded family photographs, grew strangely luminous as her eyes grew accustomed to the semi-darkness. Yet shifting from  left to right, and again from right to left on the tepid pillows, the  outlines of the unfamiliar room gained no sort of familiarity as the  hours wore on, but remained as blank and unmeaning as the house  of death itself. The silence alone was terrible, speaking as it did of the austere  silence of the death-chamber below--a chamber where a white  figure, once her husband's brother, lay stretched in awful  rigidity on the bed. The October night was dank, the atmosphere numb and heavy.  As the roar of London died in the larger and enwrapping silences,  the crack of a piece of furniture or the tapping of a withered leaf  on the window-pane grew to be signs portentous and uncanny. Yet, turning and twisting on the rumpled sheet, every moment sleep 240  A Thief in the Night sleep seemed more impossible. In the stagnant air her head felt  hot, her limbs feverish. She longed to jump out of bed and throw  open the window, and made as if to do so, but hesitated, fearing  the sound might waken the sleeping man beside her. But the  thought of movement made her restless, and, slipping cautiously  out on to her feet, she took her watch from the little table beside  her and peered at it until she made out that the hands indicated  five-and-twenty minutes to three. Nearing the light, she revealed herself a lean, spare woman, with  the leathery skin of the lean, and with hair now touched with grey,  which grew sparsely and with no attempt at flourish or ornament,  on the nape of an anxious neck. For the rest, a woman agitated  and agitating, a woman worn with the fret of a single idea. Five-and-twenty minutes to three ! A clock downstairs somewhere  in the great silent house struck the half-hour, and Mrs. Rathbourne,  with one of those parentheses of the mind which occur in nervous  crises, found herself wondering if her watch had gained since she  set it right by the station clock at Sheffield. The journey South  since they had received that startling telegram summoning them  to town had seemed, indeed, a vague blur, varied only by the  remembrance of fields splashed with yellow advertisements of  divers infallible cures, of a quarrel between her husband and a  porter about a bag, and later by the din and roar of the crowded streets and the flare of dingy lights which danced by in procession  as the hansom dashed through London from King's Cross. They had been too late. Too late ! After four and a half hours'  incessant prayer to Providence--a Providence of whom she had asked  and expected so few boons of late--that she should be permitted to  be in time. They were too late ! Had not the thud, thud, thud of  the train said the ugly words in that dreary journey past flying  factory-chimneys, scudding hedges, and vanishing jerry-built suburbs ? By Marion Hepworth Dixon  241 suburbs ? Too late ! The blank face of the London house, the scrupulously-drawn blinds, advertised the fact even before she  jumped from the cab, smudging her dress on the muddy wheel in  her anxiety to gain the door. They were too late, irretrievably too  late, she knew, a few minutes later, when the young wife, rising  from an armchair in the dimly-lighted dining-room, greeted  them in her usual smooth, suave, unemotional tones. She remem-  bered the commonplaces that followed like things heard in a dream. Her husband's dreary inquiries, the young widow's  explanations of how Colonel Rathbourne had rallied, and had  actually died sitting in his chair in a dressing-gown, and how  thoughtful he had been in alluding, some quarter of an hour before  his death, to an alteration he had made in his will. The words  reached her, but conveyed little meaning to her dazed percep-  tions. The very sound of the two voices seemed to come as  from a distance, as the sound of other voices had once done, when  she lay ill as a little child. A bewildered sense of the unreality of  things substantial rocked in her brain. A great gap, a vague but  impassable gulf lay surely between her and these living, breathing  people, so concerned with the material trivialities of life. It was  this something dual in her consciousness which made her wonder,  half-an-hour later, if in very truth it were she, or some other woman,  who mechanically followed her sister-in-law upstairs to the dead  man's bedside. If it were she who recoiled so suddenly and with  so agonised a cry at the sight of that shrouded form ? She felt  certain of nothing, except that she hated this wife of six months'  standing, with her assured voice, her handsome shoulders,  and her manoeuvred waist. For six whole months she had been his wife..... Mrs. Rathbourne shivered, the square wrists shook with such  violence that the watch she held nearly slipped from her fingers. To 242  A Thief in the Night To avoid the possibility of noise she placed it on the washstand,  and, as she approached the light, her eye was caught by the faded  photograph which hung directly above on the wall. It was of Colonel Rathbourne, the dead man below-stairs. Out-  wardly the portrait was a thing of little beauty. A mere drabbish  presentment of a young man, dressed in the fashion of the sixties,  with somewhat sloping shoulders, and whiskers of extravagant  shape. Not that Mrs. Rathbourne saw either the whiskers or  the shoulders. Long familiarity with such accessories made them  part of the inevitable, part of all fixed and determined concrete  things, part, indeed, of the felicitous " had been " of her youth.  Had she thought of them at all, she would have thought of them  as beautiful, as everything connected with the dead man had always seemed, then, thirty years ago, in the rare intervals he  had been at home on leave, and now on the night of his sudden  death. To look at this portrait meant to ignore all intervening time, to  forget that dread thing, that shrouded and awful something  stretched on the bed in the room below. To look at it meant to  be transported to a garden in Hampshire, to a lawn giving on  Southampton Water, a lawn vivid and green in the shadow of  the frothing hawthorns, grey in the softer stretches dotted with  munching cattle which swept out to the far-off, tremulous line intersected with distant masts. She had dreaded to look or to  think of that line. It meant the sea--that ugly void of wind and  wave that was to carry him away from her. How determinedly  she had put the thought aside, rejoicing in the moment, the soft  atmosphere, the persistent hum of bees, the enervating cooing of  the wood-pigeons. Yet the eve of the day had come when the regiment was to  sail, and when, across the intimacies of the cottage dining-table, they By Marion Hepworth Dixon  243 they looked at each other and avoided each other's eyes. Her  husband had been in London on business for three or four days (it  was some years before they finally settled in the North), and was  to return by the last train. He had returned, punctually, as he  did everything, and she recalled, as if it had been yesterday, the  sound of his monotonous breathing through that last night. She  had been unable to sleep, waiting for the morning, the morning  when the dead man, then a slim young lieutenant, was to creep down to meet her in the little wood they reached by the orchard  gate. Yes, in looking back she remembered everything. Her  foolish fear of being too soon at the trysting-place, her dread of  being too late. She recalled how she had strained her ears to  listen for awakening sounds, how she had at last caught the click  of an opening door, followed by cautious footsteps in the hall.  To creep down was the work of a moment. Once below, and outside the cottage walls, the scent of the new-mown hay was  in her nostrils, and in her limbs the intoxicating freshness of  morning. She could see his figure in front of her on the narrow  winding path, and heard her own welcoming cry, as she caught up  her gown in the dewy grass, and darted towards him in the strange,  westward-trending shadows. And now he was dead. The white mockery of a man below-  stairs, that shrouded thing, so numbing in its statue-like immobility,  was all that remained. What had she left ? What tangible  remembrance of that lost possession, that she might finger and  gloat over in secret? To unhook the photograph with its tarnished  wire and dusty frame was her  impulse, but even when she  clasped it in her hands the protrait seemed, in a fashion, to evade  her. The modelling of the features had evaporated, the face was almost blank. She craved for something more tangible, more  human, something more intimately his. The 244  A Thief in the Night The nightlight, which she had raised to look at the photograph,  guttered and diminished to little more than a spark. Throwing  on a wrap, she pinched the wick with a hair-pin to kindle the  flame, and then, with a swift glance at the sleeping man, turned  with a stealthy movement to the door. What if her husband  should wake ? A crack, at the moment, from the great oak cupboard at the other side of the room made her start with  trembling apprehension. It sounded loud enough to waken fifty  sleepers, but the noise died away in the corner from which it came,  and the steady breathing of the man continued as if nothing had  disturbed the strained and looming silence. Catching her breath  she again moved forward, though assailed by the dread of the  door-handle rattling, and the fear that there might be a loose board on the stairs. Screening the light from the sleeping man's  eyes, Mrs. Rathbourne made her way round the bed, and, pulling  the door noiselessly to behind her, steadied herself to listen. In the gloom of the empty passages a sinister faintness seemed  to hover ; the mist had eked in at the long landing window, and  added a mystery all its own to the unfamiliar lines of the house.  There was silence everywhere--in the room she had left and in  the one her sister-in-law now occupied facing the stairs. Only  from the lower hall came the harsh, mechanical tick, tick, tick  (with a slight hesitation or hitch in every tick) of the eight-  day clock which fronted the hall-door. Down towards it she crept, shading the dim light to see in  front of her, while the great shadow of her own figure rose, as  she turned the corner of the staircase, and filled the obscure  corners of the lower passage walls. Beneath it was the dead man's room. She saw, with a catch at  the heart, that the latch had slipped, and knew by the long inch-  strip of ominous darkness, that the door stood ajar. With averted eyes By Marion Hepworth Dixon  245 eyes--for she dreaded with an unaccountable dread that shrouded something on the bed--she leant her elbow on one of the upper  panels, and with the stealthy movement of a cat slipped inside. An  insatiable desire mastered her. The nervous hands twitched, her  eyes travelled hungrily from one object to another, round the  room. It was  his  room. The room in which he had slept, and lived, and died .... in it there must be something which he  had used, that he had touched, and handled, that she could seize  and call her own ? But the mortuary chamber wore that rigid, unfathomable look  peculiar to rooms where the dead lie. Everything had been  tidied, straightened ; the dressing-table was bare, the books,  papers, even the medicine-bottles had been cleared away. His  favourite armchair--the chair, she remembered with a shiver, in  which he had died--had been ranged stiffly, itself a dead thing,  against the wall. There was no trace of life, or suggestion of  it, in an emptiness which ached. Mrs. Rathbourne gazed at  the mechanically arranged furniture in a baffled way, dimly  realising that the soul of the room had fled from it, as it had from  the body of the man she loved. Nothing remained but the shell.  The kindly, loyal, and withal quaintly sarcastic man, who had  struggled with disease within those four walls, had been posed,  too, in the foolishly conventional attitude of the dead, the white  sheet transforming the body into the mere shapeless outline of a  man. He was hidden, covered up, put away, as he would soon be beneath the earth, to be forgotten. Mrs. Rathbourne drew near the bed, holding the feeble light  aloft with a trembling hand. With dilated eyes she stooped over the  shrouded thing, and then, when about to raise the coverlid, fell  back, as earlier in the evening, with a renewed sense of horror.  Her pulse leapt, and then seemed to cease altogether. The strange- ness 246  A Thief in the Night ness of death paralysed the very muscles of her arm. She  wanted .... she wanted the living, not the dead. It was the  living man who, though so rarely seen, had rilled the dreary  emptiness of her life. She wanted the man, not the clay.  Dazed, unstrung, and with the odd sensation of a hand clutching  at her heart, she dropped into one of the cretonne-covered chairs  beside the bed, and, as she did so, became conscious that her arm  touched something warm. It was a well-worn dressing-gown which had been thrown over  the chair-back, the sleeve still bulging and round with the form of  the man who had worn it that very day. In one of the wide-open  pockets there was a crumpled handkerchief, while about it there  hovered the vague odour of cigars. The button at the breast,  she noticed, was loose and hung by a thread as if he had been in  the habit of playing with it, even the bit of frayed braid on the  cuff spoke in some unaccountable way of palpitating, everyday, intimate life. A gush of tears--the  she had shed--rose to the wretched woman's eyes. She pressed her pinched lips to the warm, woolly  sleeve, and then, with a convulsive movement, seized the dressing-  gown and pressed it passionately against her flat chest. With the  bundle in her arms, hugged close in guilty exultation, Mrs. Rath-  bourne stole to the door, and so noiselessly out and up the stair. As before, the dank night swooned in the dour passages.  With a hurrying beat, a beat which seemed to speak of the  inexorable passage of time, the hall clock ticked, while behind, in  the silent room, the motionless figure with the upturned feet  loomed grim and aloof in the faint gleam of the vanishing light. An Autumn Elegy By   C. W. Dalmon Now it is fitting, and becomes us all To think how fast our time of being fades. The Year puts down his mead-cup, with a sigh, And kneels, deep in the red and yellow glades, And tells his beads like one about to die ; For, when the last leaves fall, He must away unto a bare, cold cell In white St. Winter's monastery ; there To do hard penance for the joys that were, Until the New Year tolls his passing-bell. And 'tis in vain to whisper, " Be of cheer, There is a resurrection after death ; When Autumn tears will turn to Spring-time rain, As through the earth the Spirit quickeneth Toward the old, glad Summer-life again ! " He will not smile to hear, But only look more sorrowful, and say, " How can you mock me if you love me ? No ; The day draws very nigh when I must go ; The new will be the new ; I pass away." Yet, The Yellow Book--Vol. IV.  P 248  An Autumn Elegy Yet, kneeling with him, still more sad than he, I saw him once turn round and smile as sweet As in the happy rose and lily days, When, from between the stubble of the wheat, A skylark soared up through the clouds to praise The sun's eternity. Hope seemed to flash a moment in his eyes ; And, knowing him so well, I know he thought-- " How fair the legend through the ages brought, That still to live is Death's most sweet surprise ! " Two Pictures By P. Wilson Steer I. A Lady in Grey II. Portrait of Emil Sauer The End of an Episode By   Evelyn Sharp ALAN DREW, the novelist, had gone blind. And the ladies  who had come to inquire after him sat and discussed the  matter over their afternoon tea. Most of the people from the  country round who had come with the same object had gone away  baffled by his uncompromising attitude ; for Allan Drew had  never cultivated the particular set of social emotions which were demanded by his present situation ; and he had no intention of  helping the people, who bored him, to get through a formula of  compassion that he did not want. So this afternoon he sat and  listened in silence while his visitors talked with conviction about a  trial of which they had not the least experience. " It is difficult, sometimes, to understand the workings of  Providence, but--" said the Rector's wife. In spite of the years  of practice that she must have had in the work of consolation, she  did not seem to be getting on very well now. To the novelist she appeared to be wavering between an  inclination to treat him like a villager who had to be patronised  and a Parish Councillor who had to be propitiated. " Almost impossible, yes," said Allan Drew, and he shifted his  position wearily. " I think Fate is sometimes kinder than she seems at  sight," said 256  The End of an Episode said the Squire's wife, who had read some modern novels, and  therefore did not talk of Providence. " No doubt there are instances," assented the blind man  patiently, and he wondered vaguely why the  lady whom they  had indistinctly mentioned to him on their arrival had not spoken  at all. He had not lost his sight long, and it worried him to be  unable to attach any kind of personality to her. " Loss of physical sight may sometimes mean a gain of spiritual  perception," the Rector's wife laboured onwards. She sometimes  copied out her husband's sermons for him, and she had dropped  unawares into the phraseology. " It is to be hoped there are compensations," said her host, and  he turned towards the sofa where he imagined his unknown guest  to be sitting. The  lady spoke at last. " I suppose there's some good in being blind, as you both  seem to think so, but I don't know where it comes in, I'm  sure ; and I'm perfectly certain nothing can make up for it  for all that," she said, not very clearly ; but the novelist hailed  her incoherence with relief, and recognised the human note  in it. " Nothing can," he said, and nodded in her direction. The  lady went on : " I wonder, have you tried Dr. Middleton ? " His countenance  fell again. After all, she was only like everybody else. " Oh no, I haven't tried him, nor any one else you are likely to  mention," he answered with a touch of impatience. " Haven't you, really ? Now I call that rather a pity; don't you ? " " Oh, very likely," he said indifferently, and waited for them  to go. The Squire's wife was the  to move, and she pressed  his hand warmly and made the unnecessary remark that her husband By Evelyn Sharp  257 husband would come and read the paper to him as usual in the  morning. The Squire had a blatant voice, and thought it  necessary to read with a great deal of expression, and always  mistook the novelist's affliction for deafness. " I shall be delighted," said Allan in a spiritless voice. But after all it was not the Squire who came to read the Times  to him on the following morning. It was the unknown  lady of the night before ; and she knocked at his door just as the  housekeeper was clearing away the breakfast. " The Squire has a cold," she explained, with the faintest  suggestion of laughter in her voice, " and I said I would come  instead. It is so unpleasant to read to any one if you've got a  cold, isn't it ? It makes so many interruptions." " It is very unpleasant to be read to by the Squire when the  Squire has got a cold," said Allan, boldly. Somehow the reading  did not promise to be quite as dull as usual. " Where shall I begin ? " she said, disregarding his remark  altogether ; " I read atrociously, you know, but I hope you won't  mind that." " How do you expect me to believe it ? " he said, and suggested  that she should begin with the Foreign News. She had not under-estimated her powers. She had all the  tricks of which a bad reader is capable. She made two or three  attempts at every word that baffled her, and said, " Oh, bother ! "  at the end of each. She forgot to read out any of the explanatory  headings, and she rushed through the politics on the Continent as  though they all related to one nation whose name she had not  mentioned. She frequently read a few lines to herself and then  continued aloud further on, while her listener had to supply the context for himself. " That's the end of the Foreign News," she said presently, to Allan's 258  The End of an Episode Allan's intense relief. " I think politics are very difficult to  understand ; don't you ? " " I find them most bewildering," he confessed, and he had to  wait patiently a little longer while she read the rest of the news  to herself and made many comments on it out aloud ; and he was  quite willing to believe her when she told him presently that  there was absolutely nothing in the paper. " Never mind about the paper, I've had quite enough," he said ;  " won't you talk instead ? " " What a good idea," she said ; " I'll tell you all the news, shall I ? There's going to be a temperance meeting in the schoolroom to-  morrow, and I'm going for a walk on Blackcliff Hill this afternoon." " I always walk on Blackcliff Hill myself in the afternoon,"  murmured Allan in parenthesis. " The Squire has got a cold--oh, I told you that," she went on.  " And let me see, is there anything else ? I know there was a  tremendous fuss about something before I got up this morning ;  somebody took a horse somewhere and broke it somehow or  another, its knees or the harness or something, and I came down  late to breakfast. That really is all. Did you ever know such a  place as this ? " " Oh, but that isn't nearly all," he protested with a smile. " Why, what else ? " " Well--yourself," he said, and put his leg over the arm of his  chair and turned his face in her direction. " Oh, but that's so dull," she said hastily ; " and besides, there  isn't anything to tell--there isn't really." " Yet you have lived," he said slowly, " lived, and perhaps  suffered a little as well." " Well, I suppose I have had my share," she said with the  necessary sigh. " And By Evelyn Sharp  259 " And in all probability loved." " Loved ! Oh, well, of course, every one has--and besides "----  she interrupted again. " Very possibly hated," he went on deliberately. " We-ell, perhaps, I don't--well." " Then let's hear all about it," he said encouragingly. It seemed really unkind to refuse any one in so sad a situation. " But," she said wavering, " there's such a lot: where shall I  begin ? " " I acknowledge that is a difficulty," he said, weighing the  matter carefully, " but perhaps if you were to choose one episode." " One episode, yes," she said, pondering. " Taken from an interesting period of your life, before you  were so old as to----" " I really do think----" she burst out angrily. Allan hastened to explain that his estimate of her age, being  based entirely upon what he knew of her wit and understanding,  and not upon her personal appearance, was most probably ex-  aggerated. " But what kind of episode ? " she pursued reluctantly. " Oh, well, that I will leave to you," he said politely; and he  found his way to the window, still with his face towards her. " Before I was married or after ? " she asked. " Well, I should say decidedly after. The probability is that  you married very young, so that the episodes, if there really were  any, came later on. And I should say that, not very long after  either, you may have gone away together to the seaside, where  the weather was bad and the days were long, and you began to  feel rather bored. And then, let us suppose that your husband  was called up to town unexpectedly ; and some one else, who was  young too, and bored too, staying in the same seaside place----" " Really, 260  The End of an Episode " Really, Mr. Drew ! " cried the other, " one might almost  suppose that you knew more about it than I do ! " " One almost might," he agreed, " shall I go on ? Let me see,  where was I ? Oh, the advent of the other young person, who  was also bored. He would probably be an artist of some kind, or  perhaps dabble in a profession." " A novelist ? " she suggested. He bowed his head smilingly. " For the purposes of argument we will call him a novelist.  And this young novelist may have met you perhaps, and you may  have gone for long walks together." " All along the cliff," she murmured. " And talked Art together ? " " All about the novel that wasn't published then," she added. " And your husband became still more neglectful." " And the novelist still more persistent," she put in. " And the situation developed daily and hourly until your husband--" " Came back by the midday train one Saturday," she said,  resting her chin on her hand. " And the aspiring novelist had to pack up the novel that was  not then published and--" " And he had to go right away, and he never came back," she  cried, suddenly starting up and walking over to the other window,  where she remained standing with her back to him. " Yes ? " said Allan with a smile, " then it was nothing but an  ordinary episode after all." There was a little pause, which she occupied by throwing the  blind-tassel about. " Mr. Drew, why did you make up all that nonsense ? " she  said suddenly. "It By Evelyn Sharp  261 " It was nonsense then ? " " Why did you make it up, and talk as if--as if it really happened--to somebody--once. " Why ? " he said carelessly. " Oh, because I suppose it did  really happen to somebody--once. Didn't it ? " The next pause lasted longer. " I thought you didn't know," she muttered presently. The blind-tassel was flying wildly through the air. He laughed  slightly. " I didn't. At least, not until you began to read." " At all events,  you  have not altered much," she retorted, and  the blind-tassel came off in her hand. " Well, I never," said the Squire's wife from the door-  way. " I have knocked three times. And you don't seem to be  reading the paper either. You were talking just as though you  had known one another all your lives." " I believe we were," assented the novelist. " You see," exclaimed his companion elaborately, " we have  just discovered that we met on the East Coast once, ever so long  ago, soon after I was married. Isn't it odd ? " " In fact, a coincidence," said Allan, to help her out. The Squire's wife looked as though she did not believe in  coincidences much. " How very strange," she said ; " but why in the world didn't  you say so last night, Everilde ? " After that, the Squire's wife and Mrs. Witherington did all the  talking between them. But Allan managed to get in a word just  as they were leaving. " And what time did you say you would be walking on Black-  cliff Hill ? " he murmured. " Ah," 262  The End of an Episode " Ah," she answered with a laugh. "But I am older now, and  Blackcliff Hill is not the East Coast." " And the novel is published," he said ; and he added to himself  as they walked away : " I wonder if her husband is still----  Anyhow, I'm not going to find out." But Everilde Witherington was careful to let him know at  their next meeting, which, by the way, did not take place on  Blackcliff Hill, that her husband had gone abroad, and that she  had come to stay with her great friend, the Squire's wife, to  recover from the effects of influenza. After that the conversation  flagged a little, and the interview was not such a success as the  last one had been. " You two don't seem to have much to talk about," said the  Squire's wife, who was present ; " what's the use of being old  friends ? " " There isn't any use," said the novelist, " all the old subjects  are used up, and we are not in touch with the new ones." " And besides," added Mrs. Witherington, " the fact of your  supposing us to be old friends prevents your joining in the conver-  sation, although you are there all the time, don't you see." " Oh, yes I see, thank you," said the Squire's wife; " two's  company, three's none." " Oh dear, no, I didn't mean that, really," said her friend; " and  besides, that entirely depends on the other two. Some of the best  times I have ever had have been with two other people." " I should like to ask the two other people about that," said  Allan. About a month later they really did meet one evening on  Blackcliff Hill, and this time without the Squire's wife. Blackcliff Hill was a smooth, round chalk rising, covered with  gorse and bramble and springy turf, a broad expanse of green slopes By Evelyn Sharp  263 slopes and hollows without a peak or a suggestion of grandeur or  barrenness, a hill like a hundred other hills, with a soft fresh breeze  that lingered over it without ruffling its surface. " How did you know it was me ? " she said when he called out  to her. " I always know," he answered in a tone which sounded as  though he had not wasted his time during the past month. " Oh," she said as their hands met, " I came up to see the sun-  set, you know." " So did I--at least," he said, and smiled. " The air is very pleasant up here ; you can see three counties  --I mean one can--I'm so sorry," she stammered. " It's a favourite walk of mine," he went on as they strolled  through the bracken ; " I like the placid conventionality of the  place." " That's just what I don't like," she burst out impatiently ; " I  would much rather have boulders, and miles of heather, and no  haystacks, or cornfields, or chimneys." " The East Coast for instance ? " he suggested, and she subsided  into a careful study of the three counties. " Why do you look at me as though you could see my face ? "  she asked him presently. " I like to think I can, for the sake of the old times," he  answered lightly. " Oh, those old times ! " she cried; " how fond you are of  dragging them up. Why can't you leave them alone ? " " Yes, I suppose it is rather invidious," he said solemnly, " now  that they are gone." " Yes, now that they are gone," she echoed, also solemnly. He laughed outright. " What a comedy it all is ! Do you remember how we lived for 264  The End of an Episode for days, with that midday train on Saturday hanging over our  heads ? And now that there is no one else to prevent us from  loving each other--" " What do you mean ? " she said quickly. He laughed again  and felt for her hand, and took it between his. " Mean ? Do you suppose I haven't known it for a whole  month, you foolish--" " Who told you," she asked, and her thoughts flew to the  Squire's wife. " Oh, never mind that. Now, please, I want to know why  you didn't tell me you were a widow ? Were you afraid of  me ? " " What an idea ! " " Then I suppose it was a miserable truce with respectability  to enable you to patronise the broken-down novelist without  implicating--" " Allan ! How dare you ? " she cried, and snatched her hand  away. He put his into his pockets, and strolled on. " Well, you must own it is slightly unaccountable. I thought  it was one of your impetuous freaks at . But you kept it up  too long for that. And then I put it down in my vanity to your  liking me a little still, and wishing to conceal it. But I was soon  dispossessed of that idea. And then finally--" " How prosy you are," she grumbled, " you are not half so  amusing as you used to be." " No, we don't seem to hit it quite so well as we did then, do  we ? You see, you were in love with me, and I--" " You know I never said so once ! " " And we had plenty to talk about. But our conversation is  mostly sticky now." " There isn't the novel any more," she said. " Nor By Evelyn Sharp  265 " Nor the husband," he rejoined ruthlessly. They sat down near the top of the hill, and wished for the  Squire's wife. " It's very odd," said the novelist. " Odd ?  I  call it dull." " Dull, then, if you like. I wonder who invented the ridicu-  lous idea of two people marrying and living happily ever after.  It must have been the man who wrote for money." " All the same, I'm rather disappointed," said Mrs. Withering-  ton, gazing steadily at the three counties. " What about ? That you can't fall in love with me now  that there is nothing against our marrying ? " " Oh no, not that," she said. " What then ? " " Oh, well, only that I hoped, just a little you know, that you  might still like me enough to--to ask me, so that I could--oh,  bother ! " " So that you could have the intense pleasure of refusing me ?  Sorry I disappointed you." " We can go on being chums, though, can't we ? " she sug-  gested, pulling up handfuls of moss. " Oh, don't," he groaned, " do be a little more original than  that.  You  are not writing for money, are you ? " " Then," she cried desperately, " there  is  nothing left but the  sunset ; and what's the use of that when you can't see it ? " " Can't I ? " he said in a curious tone, " don't I know that it  has just got down to the line of fir-trees along the canal, and is  streaking across the cornfield, and making the hills on this side  look warm ? " He was sheltering his eyes from the sun with his hand as he  spoke, and Everilde turned and stared at him suddenly. " Allan," 266  The End of an Episode " Allan," she cried, catching at his hand and pulling it down,  " Allan, you can--you--" " Yes," he said with a laugh, squeezing her fingers indiffer-  ently because they happened to be in his, " yes. I did try Dr.  Middleton after all." " I never thought you could be blind for long," she muttered,  " if it had been any one else, now--but why did you keep it to  yourself ? " He laughed heartily as he stretched himself out lazily on the  grass and tilted his hat forward. " Do you really want to know ? Because I wanted to have  my secret too--that's all. You see, I thought that if I were blind  and helpless and all that sort of thing, you might get to care a  little, don't you see, and--" " Then we were both disappointed," she said with a note of  triumph in her voice. " I'm rather glad of that." " Dr. Middleton ? " she said presently to the three counties.  " Then, if it hadn't been for me--" But no one finished her sentence, for Allan Drew had suddenly  bethought him of a cigarette. Three Drawings By Aubrey Beardsley I. The Mysterious Rose Garden II. The Repentance of Mrs. * * * * III. Portrait of Miss Winifred Emery 1880 By   Max Beerbohm Say, shall these things be forgotten  In the Row that men call Rotten,  Beauty Clare ? -- Hamilton Aïdé . I SUPPOSE that there is no one, however optimistic, that has not  wished, from time to time, that he had been born into some  other age than this. Poor Professor Froude once admitted that  he would like to have been a prehistoric man. Don Quixote is  only one of many who have tried to revive the days of chivalry.  A desire to have lived in the eighteenth century is common to all  our second-rate  litterateurs . But, for my own part, I have often  felt that it would have been nice to live in that bygone epoch  when society was  inducted into the mysteries of art and, not  losing yet its old and elegant  tenue , babbled of blue china and  white lilies, and of the painter Rossetti and of the poet Swinburne.  It would have been a fine thing to see the  tableaux  at Cromwell  House or the Pastoral Plays at Coombe Wood, to have strained  my eyes for a glimpse of the Jersey Lily, clapped holes in my  gloves for Connie Gilchrist, and danced all night long to the  strains of the Manola Valse. The period of 1880 must have been delicious. It 276  1880 It is now so remote from us that much therein is hard for  us to understand, much must remain mobled in the mists of  antiquity. The material upon which any historian, grappling with  any historical period, chiefly relies is, as he himself would no  doubt admit, whatever has already been written by other  historians. Strangely enough, no historian has yet written of this most vital epoch. Nor are the contemporary memoirs, though  indeed many, very valuable. From such writers as  Montague Williams ,  Frith , or the  Bancrofts , you gain little peculiar know-  ledge. That quaint old chronicler, H. W. Lucy, describes  amusingly enough the frown of Sir Richard (afterwards Lord)  Cross or the tea-rose in the Premier's button-hole. But what can  he tell us of the negotiations that preceded Mr. Gladstone's return  to public life, or of the secret councils of the  Party, whereby  Sir Stafford was gradually eclipsed ? At such things as these  we can but guess. Good memoirs must always be the cumulation  of gossip, but gossip, alas, was killed by the Press. In the tavern  or the barber's shop, all secrets passed into every ear, but from the  morning paper little is to be culled. Manifestations are made manifest to us, but the inner aspect of things is sacred. I have  been seriously handicapped by having no real material, save such  newspapers of the time as  Punch ,  or the London Charivari ,  The  Queen ,  The Lady's Newspaper , and others. The idea of excava-  tion, which in the East has been productive of such rich material  for the historian, was indeed suggested to me, but owing to obvious difficulties had to be abandoned. I trust then that the  reader may pardon any deficiencies in so brief an excursus by  reason of the great difficulties of research and the paucity of  intimate authorities. The period of 1880 and of the four years immediately succeed-  ing it must always be memorable to us, for it marks a great change By Max Beerbohm  277 change in the constitution of society. It would seem that  during the five or six years that preceded it, the " Upper Ten  Thousand," as they were quaintly called by the journals of the  day, had taken a somewhat more frigid tone. The Prince  of Wales had inclined for a while to be restful after the revels of  his youth. The continued seclusion of Queen Victoria, who  during these years was engaged upon that superb work of intro- spection and self-analysis,  More Leaves from the Highlands , had  begun to tell upon the social system. Balls and entertainments,  both at Court and in the houses of the nobles, were notably  fewer. The vogue of the opera was passing. Even in the top  of the season, Rotten Row, so I read, was not intolerably crowded.  Society was becoming dull. In 1880, however, came the Dissolution and the tragic fall of  Disraeli, and the sudden triumph of the Whigs. How great  was the change that came upon Westminster thenceforward must  be known to any one who has studied the annals of the incompar-  able Parliament of 1880 and the succeeding years. Gladstone,  with a monstrous majority behind him and revelling in the old  splendour of speech that neither the burden of age nor six years' sulking had made less ; Parnell, pale, deadly, mysterious, with his  crew of wordy peasants that were to set at naught all that had been  held sacred by the Saxon--the activity of these two men alone  would have sufficed to raise this Parliament above all others.  What of young Randolph Churchill, who, despite his halting  speech, foppish mien and rather coarse fibre of mind, was yet  the most brilliant parliamentarian of the century ? What pranks  he and his little band played upon the House ! How they fright- ened poor Sir Stafford and infuriated the Premier. What of the  eloquent atheist, Charles Bradlaugh, pleading at the Bar, striding  forward to the very mace, while the Tories yelled and mocked at him, 278  1880 him, hustled down the stone steps with the broadcloth torn to  tatters from his back ? Imagine the existence of God being made  a party question ! I wonder if such scenes can ever be witnessed  again at St. Stephen's as were witnessed then. Whilst these  curious elements were making themselves felt in politics, so too  in Society were the primordia of a great change. The aristocracy  could not live by good-breeding alone. The old delights seemed  vapid, waxen. Something new was wanted. And thus came it  that the spheres of fashion and of art met, thus began the great  social renascence of 1880. Be it remembered that long before this time there had been  in the heart of Chelsea a kind of cult of Beauty. Certain  artists had settled there, deliberately refusing to work in the  ordinary official way, and " wrought," as they were wont to put it,  " for the pleasure and sake of all that is fair." Swinburne,  Morris, Rossetti, Whistler, Burne-Jones, were of this little  community--all of them men of great industry and caring for little but their craft. Quietly and unbeknown they produced  their poems or their pictures or their essays, read them or  showed them to one another and worked on. In fact, Beauty  had existed long before 1880. It was Mr. Oscar Wilde  who   trotted her round. This remarkable youth, a student at the  University of Oxford, began to show himself everywhere, and even  published a volume of poems in several editions as a kind of decoy  to the shy artificers of Chelsea. The lampoons that at this period  were written against him are still extant, and from them, and  from the references to him in the contemporary journals, it would  appear that it was to him that Art owed the great social vogue she  enjoyed at this time. Peacock feathers and sunflowers glittered  in every room, the curio shops were ransacked for the furniture of  Annish days, men and women, fired by the fervid words of the young Oscar By Max Beerbohm  279 Oscar, threw their mahogany into the streets. A few smart women  even dressed themselves in suave draperies and unheard-of greens.  Into whatever ballroom you went, you would surely find, among  the women in tiaras and the fops and the distinguished foreigners,  half a score of comely ragamuffins in velveteen, murmuring  sonnets, posturing, waving their hands. " Nincompoopiana " the  craze was called at , and later " Æstheticism." It was in 1880 that Private Views became necessary functions  of fashion. I should like to have been at a Private View of the  Old Grosvenor Gallery. There was Robert Browning, the poet,  button-holing a hundred friends and doffing his hat with a courtly  sweep to more than one duchess. There, too, was Theo  Marzials, poet and eccentric, and  Walter Sickert , the impres-  sionist, and Charles Colnaghi, the hero of a hundred tea-fights,  and young Brookfield, the comedian, and many another good  fellow. My Lord of Dudley, the  virtuoso , came there leaning  for support upon the arm of his fair young wife. Disraeli, with  his lustreless eyes and face like some seamed Hebraic parchment,  came also and whispered behind his hand to the faithful Corry.  What interesting folk ! What a wonderful scene ! A chronicler of the time thus writes of it : " There were quaint, beautiful, extraordinary costumes walking about--ultra-æsthetics, artistic-æsthetics, æsthetics that made up their  minds to be daring, and suddenly gave way in some important point--  put a frivolous bonnet on the top of a grave and glowing garment that  Albert Dürer might have designed for a mantle. There were fashion-  able costumes that Mrs. Mason or Madame Elise might have turned  out that morning. The motley crowd mingled, forming into groups,  sometimes dazzling you by the array of colours that you never thought  to see in full daylight..... Canary-coloured garments flitted cheerily  by garments of the saddest green. A hat in an agony of pokes and angles 280  1880 angles was seen in company with a bonnet that was a gay garland of flowers. A vast cape that might have enshrouded the form of a Mater Dolorosa hung by the side of a jauntily-striped Langtry-hood." Of the purely aesthetic fads of Society were also the Pastoral  Plays at Coombe Wood, and a very charming fad they must  have been. There was one specially great occasion when Shake-  speare's play, " As you like it," was given. The day was as hot as  a June day  can  be, and every one drove down in open carriages  and hansoms, and in the evening returned in the same way. It  was the very Derby Day of æstheticism. " To every character  in the play was given a perfectly appropriate attire, and the brown  and green of their costumes harmonised exquisitely with the ferns  through which they wandered, the trees beneath which they lay, and the lovely English landscape that surrounded the Pastoral  Players." It must have been a proud day for the Lady Archibald  Campbell, who gave this fête, and for E. W. Godwin, who  directed its giving. Fairer to see than the mummers were the  guests who sat and watched from under the dark and griddled elms.  The women wore jerseys and tied-back skirts. Zulu hats shaded  their faces from the sun. Bangles shimmered upon their wrists. And the men of fashion wore light frock-coats and light top-hats  with black bands, and the aesthetes were in velveteen, carrying  lilies. Nor does it seem that Society went entirely to the æsthetes  for instruction in life. There was actively proceeding, at this  time, an effort to raise the average of aristocratic loveliness, quite  independently of the æsthetes. The Professional Beauty was,  more strictly, a Philistine production. What exactly this term,  Professional Beauty, signifies, how any woman gained a right to  it, we do not and may never know. It is certain, however, that there By Max Beerbohm  281 there were at this time a number of women to whom it was  applied. They received special attention from the Prince of Wales,  and hostesses would move heaven and earth to have them at their  receptions. Their portraits were exhibited in every shop. Crowds  assembled before their door every morning to see them start for  Rotten Row. Mrs. Langtry, the incomparably beautiful, Mrs.  Wheeler, who always appeared in black, and Lady Lonsdale, after-  wards Lady de Grey, were all of them famous Professional Beauties. We may doubt whether the movement, symbolised by  these ladies, was quite in accord with the dignity and elegance  that always should mark the best society. Any effort to make  Beauty compulsory robs Beauty of its chief charm. But, at the  same time, we do believe that this movement, so far as it came of  a real wish to raise a practical standard of feminine loveliness for  all classes, does not deserve the strictures that have been passed  upon it by posterity. One of its immediate consequences was the incursion of American ladies into London. Then it was that  these pretty little creatures, " clad in Worth's most elegant con-  fections," drawled their way into the drawing-rooms of the  great. Appearing, as they did, with the especial favour of the  Prince of Wales, they had an immediate success. They were so  wholly new that their voices and their dresses were mimicked partout . The English beauties were very angry, especially with  the Prince, whom alone they blamed for the vogue of their rivals.  History credits the Prince of Wales with many notable achieve- ments. Not the least of these is that he discovered the inhabitants  of America. It will be seen that in this renascence the keenest students of  the exquisite were women. Nor, however, were men wholly  idle. Since the days of King George the noble art of self-  adornment had been sadly neglected by them. Great fops, like D'Orsay, 282  1880 D'Orsay, had come upon the town, but never had they formed a  school. Dress, therefore, had become simpler, wardrobes  smaller, fashions apt to linger. In 1880 arose the sect that was  soon to win for itself the title of " The Mashers." What exactly  this title signified I suppose no two etymologists will ever agree.  But we can learn clearly enough from the fashion-plates and  caricatures of the day what the Mashers were in outward  semblance, from the lampoons what was their mode of life.  Unlike the Dandies of the Georgian era they made no pretence  to any qualities of the intellect, and, wholly contemptuous of the  aesthetes, recognised no art save the art of dress. Much might be  written about the Mashers. The Music Hall was unknown to  them, but nightly they gathered at the Gaiety Theatre. Nightly  the stalls were fulfilled with row after row of small, sleek heads,  surmounting collars of monstrous height. Nightly in the  foyer   were lisped the praises of Kate Vaughan, her graceful dancing, or  of Nellie Farren, her matchless fooling. Never a night passed  but the dreary stage-door was surrounded by a crowd of fools bearing bouquets and fools incumbent upon canes. A strange  cult ! I used to know a lady whose father was actually present at  the  night of "The Forty Thieves," and fell enamoured of one  of the  coryphées . By such links is one age joined to another. There is always something rather absurd about the past. It is  easy to sneer at these Mashers, with their fantastic raiment and  vacuous lives. It is easy to laugh at all that ensued when   the mummers and the stainers of canvas strayed into Mayfair.  To me the most wonderful moment of the pantomime has always  seemed to come when the winged and wired fairies begin to fade  away and, as they fade, clown and pantaloon tumble on joppling and grimacing. The social condition of 1880 fascinates me in  the same manner. Its contrasts are irresistible. Perhaps, By Max Beerbohm  283 Perhaps, in my study of the period, I may have fallen so deeply  beneath its spell that I have tended, now and again, to exaggerate  its real importance. I lay no claim to the true historical spirit. I  fancy it was a red-chalk drawing of a girl in a mob-cap, signed  " Frank Miles, 1880," that impelled me to research. To  give an accurate and exhaustive account of the period would need  a far less brilliant pen than mine. But I hope that, by dealing,  even so briefly as I have dealt, with its more strictly sentimental  aspects, I may have lightened the task of the scientific historian.  And I look to Professor Gardiner and to the Bishop of Oxford. Proem to " The Wonderful Mission of Earl Lavender " By   John Davidson THOUGH our eyes turn ever waveward Where our sun is well-nigh set ; Though our Century totters graveward We may laugh a little yet. Oh ! our age-end style perplexes All our elders time has tamed ; On our sleeves we wear our sexes, Our diseases, unashamed. Have we lost the mood romantic That was once our right by birth ? Lo ! the greenest girl is frantic With the woe of all the earth. But we know a British rumour, And we think it whispers well : " We would ventilate our humour In the very jaws of Hell." Though By John Davidson  285 Though our thoughts turn ever Doomwards, Though our sun is well-nigh set, Though our Century totters tombwards, We may laugh a little yet.

"They are thoroughly considered ; seen as solid wholes ; seen not only in front, but round at the   back. . . . Both the 'Ballad in Blank Verse ' and the 'Ballad of a Nun ' contain very strong morals very stoutly driven home. In each the poet has made up his mind : he has a theory of life, and presents that   theory to us under cover of a parable of tremendous force."-- A. T. Q. C., in the Speaker.  "An abundant vigour, a lusty vitality, is the mark of all his work. He does not versify for the sake  of versifying, but because his intensity of feeling seeks an outlet in the most vehement and concentrated  form of expression."--Daily Chronicle.  "We must acknowledge that Mr. Davidson's work in this volume displays great power. . . . There  is strength and to spare."--Times.  "Mr. Davidson's new book is the best thing he has done, and to say this is a good deal. . . . Here,  at all events, is a poet who is never tame or dull : who, at all events, never leaves us indifferent.

THE constantly widening connection of "Scribner's Magazine" in both literary and artistic work will be drawn upon during the coming year in novel and stimulating directions to make each issue represent the highest type of a progressive and popular American Magazine. ANNOUNCEMENTS.  The Amazing Marriage, A NEW SERIAL NOVEL by GEORGE MEREDITH, will BEGIN in the January Number of  "SCRIBNER." The History of the Last Quarter-Century in the United States Will be an important feature, extending over a number of months .  To undertake the preparation of this history the Magazine has been fortunate in securing President E BENJAMIN ANDREWS, of Brown University, who unites the closest study  of American history with the broad grasp of a man of affairs. He possesses especially the fresh   point of view and picturesque narrative which mean everything in a work of this character. The Story of a Play  Will be a short novel by WILLIAM D. HOWELLS, the experience of young playwright,  and one of Mr. Howell's most delightful pictures of New York life in a new field. Another undertaking of interest in quite a different field will be ROBERT GRANT'S  Papers on the Practical Problems of Life, under the title of   "The Art of Living."  "The Income." "The Commissariat." "The Summer Problem."  "The Dwelling." "Education." "Married and Single Life."  "The Case of Man" AND "The Case of Woman." "American Party Politics"  Will be a series of three articles by NOAH BROOKS, dealing with the history of party  politic with the clearness, entertaining quality and personal reminiscences of a man who has been  for years a leading journalist and student of the subject. No attempt will be made to give here a detailed announcement of the miscellaneous articles which will  give permanence and lively interest to the numbers of the Magazine for 1895. By their varied suggestiveness  and individuality they will maintain its traditions of excellence and of close interest in the activities of  contemporary life. But among the papers which will appear in early numbers of the year may be especially  mentioned: Life at the Athletic Clubs, by DUNCAN EDWARDS, illustrated by C. D. Gibson ; Country  and Hunt Clubs, by EDWARDS S. MARTIN, illustrated ; A Tuscan Shrine, by Mrs. EDITH WHARTON,   with superb illustrations recording an important artistic discovery; Old-fashioned Gardens, by Mrs.  ALICE MORSE EARL, abundantly illustrated from the finest of our old gardens; The Portraits of J. M.  W. Turner, by COSMO MONKHOUSE; Coney Island, by JULIAN RALPH, illustrated by Henry McCarter;  a story of Labrador, by GILBERT PARKER, illustrated by Albery Lynch; Country Roads, written and   illustrated by FRANK FRENCH, the well-known engraver; Sawney's Deer-lick, by CHARLES D.

Pall Mall Budget . "Really the best of the Art  Magazines."--Daily Chronicle. "No other English magazine   covers the field which this one  adopted in its  number and  has cultivated ever since in issues  preserving a high standard of  artistic excellence. For anyone  who wishes to follow the doings  of the emancipated wing in  English art, especially English decorative art, it is the best maga-  zine printed." New York Tribune . "Bien écrite, bien éditée, d'un  artistique aspect dans sa robe  vert olive, le 'STUDIO' est sans  contredit la plus neuve et la plus originale revue d'art illustrée  qu'on puisse signaler . . . nulle autre revue d'art ne lui est com-  parable, ni en Angleterre ni  surtout sur le continent." L'Art Moderne . It is the Mission of "THE STUDIO" to treat upon Modern Art in all its phases --Art in Painting, Art in Books, Art in Decoration, Art in the Home ; and to  illustrate not only the best pictures, but also the best decorative designs of  the day.

Crown 8v0, cloth, 3s. 6d. net. KEYNOTES.  By GEORGE EGERTON. Sixth Edition now ready . "A rich, passionate temperament vibrates through every line. . . . We have met nothing so lovely in its tenderness since Mr. Kipling's 'Without Benefit of Clergy.'" Daily Chronicle "The author of these able word sketches is manifestly a close observer of Nature's   moods, and one, moreover, who carefully takes stock of the up-to-date thoughts that  shake mankind."-- Daily Telegraph . "Not since 'The Story of an African Farm' was written has any woman delivered  herself of so strong, so forcible a book."-- Queen . "A work of genius. There is upon the whole thing a stamp of downright inevitable-  ness as of things which must be written, and written exactly in that way."-- Speakers . "'Keynotes' is a singularly clever book."-- Truth . A CHILD OF THE AGE.  By FRANCIS ADAMS. Ready . "The love incident is exquisite, and exquisitely told. 'Rosy' lives ; her emotions  stir us. . . . One is grateful for the artistic revelation of the sweet wormwood of pain." Saturday Review . There is a bloom of romance upon their story which recalls Lucy and Richard Feverel. . . . It is rarely that a novelist is able to suffuse his story with the  rosy  purity of passion as Mr. Adams has done in this book."-- Realm . "Only a man of big talent could have produced it."-- Literary World . "It comes recognizably near to great excellence."-- Pall Mall Gazette . "Possesses a depth and clearness of insight, a delicacy of touch, and a brilliancy and  beauty of style very remarkable in so young a writer."-- Scotsman . LONDON: JOHN LANE, THE BODLEY HEAD. The Yellow Book Advertisements  15 The Keynote Series .  Each Volume with specially designed Title-page by AUBREY BEARDSLEY.  Crown 8vo, cloth, 3s. 6d. net. THE DANCING FAUN.  By FLORENCE FARR. Ready . "We welcome the light and merry pen of Miss Farr as one of the deftest that has been wielded in the style of to-day. She has written the cleverest and the most cynical  sensation story of the season."-- Liverpool Daily Post . "No one can deny its freshness and wit. Indeed there are things in it here and  there which John Oliver Hobbes herself might have signed without loss of reputation." Woman . "There is a lurid power in the very unreality of the story. One does not quite  understand how Lady Geraldine worked herself up to shooting her lover, but when she  has done it, the description of what passes through her mind is magnificent."-- Athen&#x00E6;um "As a work of art the book has the merit of brevity and smart writing ; while the dénouement  is skilfully prepared, and comes as a surprise. If the book had been intended  as a satire on the 'new woman' sort of literature, it would have been most brilliant ; but  assuming it to be written in earnest, we can heartily praise the form of its construction without agreeing with the sentiments expressed."-- St. James's Gazette . "Shows considerable power and aptitude."--Saturday Review. THE GREAT GOD PAN AND THE  INMOST LIGHT.  By ARTHUR MACHEN. Ready . "The supernatural element is utilized with extraordinary power and effectiveness in  both these blood-chilling masterpieces."-- Daily Telegraph . "Since Mr. Stevenson played with the crucibles of Science in 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr.  Hyde,' we have not encountered a more successful experiment of the sort." Pall Mall Gazette . "Nothing more striking or more skilful than this book has been produced in the way  of what one may call Borderland fiction since Mr. Stevenson's indefatigable Brownies  gave the world 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.'"-- Glasgow Herald . "Capital reading, we should say, for ghosts and vampires in their leisure moments." Daily Chronicle . "For sheer gruesome horror Mr. Machen's story surpasses anything that has been  published for a long time."-- Scotsman .

POOR FOLK.  Translated from the Russian of F. DOSTOIEVSKY.  By LENA MILMAN.  WITH A PREFACE BY GEORGE MOORE. Ready . "These things seem small, but in the hands of Dostoievsky they make a work of  genius."-- Black and White . "One of the most pathetic things in literature, heart-rending, just because its  tragedy is so repressed."-- Bookman . "As to novels, the very finest I have read of late or for long is 'Poor Folk,' by  Fedor Dostoievsky, translated by Miss Lena Milman."-- Truth . "Dostoievsky's novel has met with that rare advantage, a really good translator."-- Queen . "This admirable translation of a great author."-- Liverpool Mercury . "'Poor Folk' Englished does not read like a translation--indubitably a master-  piece."-- Literary World . DISCORDS.  By GEORGE EGERTON. Ready . "The student who would keep his finger on the pulse of the time cannot afford to  ignore it."-- Speaker . "It is another note in the great chorus of revolt . . . on the whole clearer, more   eloquent, and braver than almost any I have yet heard."--T.P. ("Book of the Week"), Weekly Sun , December 30. "These masterly word sketches."-- Daily Telegraph . "It will be called immoral, it may even be preached against in actual pulpits . . .  but here it is, and must be scanned, a lurid picture of the seamy side, painted in colours  mixed with tears and blood."-- Realm . "On the whole we congratulate George Egerton."-- Pall Mall Gazette . LONDON : JOHN LANE, THE BODLEY HEAD.
