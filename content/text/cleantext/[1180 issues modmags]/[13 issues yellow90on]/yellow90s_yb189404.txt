Reproduced by the Swan Electric Engraving Company The Death of the Lion By   Henry James I I HAD  simply, I suppose, a change of heart, and it must have  begun when I received my manuscript back from   Mr. Pinhorn  . Mr. Pinhorn   was my chief, as he was called in the office: he  had accepted the high mission of bringing the paper up. This  was a weekly periodical, and had been supposed to be almost past  redemption when he took hold of it. It was  Mr. Deedy  who had  let it down so dreadfully -- he was never mentioned in the office  now save in connection with that misdemeanour. Young as I  was I had been in a manner taken over from  Mr. Deedy , who  had been owner as well as editor; forming part of a promiscuous  lot, mainly plant and office-furniture, which poor  Mrs. Deedy , in  her bereavement and depression, parted with at a rough valuation.  I could account for my continuity only on the supposition that  I had been cheap. I rather resented the practice of fathering  all flatness on my late protector, who was in his unhonoured  grave; but as I had my way to make I found matter enough for  complacency in being on a  "staff."  At the same time I was aware that I was exposed to suspicion as a product of the old  lowering system. This made me feel that I was doubly bound to have 8 The Death of the Lion have ideas, and had doubtless been at the bottom of my proposing  to Mr. Pinhorn  that I should lay my lean hands on  Neil Paraday .  I remember that he looked at me  as if he had never heard of  this celebrity, who indeed at that moment was by no means in the  middle of the heavens; and even when I had knowingly explained  he expressed but little confidence in the demand for any such  matter. When I had reminded him that the great principle on  which we were supposed to work was just to create the demand  we required, he considered a moment and then rejoined:  "I see;  you want to write him up." "Call it that if you like." "And what's your inducement?" "Bless my soul -- my admiration!" Mr. Pinhorn  pursed up his mouth.  "Is there much to be done  with him?" "Whatever there is, we should have it all to ourselves for he   hasn't been touched." This argument was effective, and  Mr. Pinhorn  responded: "Very well, touch him."  Then he added:  "But where can you  do it?" "Under the fifth rib!"  I laughed. Mr. Pinhorn  stared.  "Where's that?" "You want me to go down and see him?"  I inquired, when I  had enjoyed his visible search for this obscure suburb. "I don't  "want"  anything -- the proposal's your own. But you must remember that that's the way we do things  now ,"  said  Mr. Pinhorn , with another dig at  Mr. Deedy . Unregenerate as I was, I could read the queer implications o of this speech. The present owner's superior virtue as well as his  deeper craft spoke in his reference to the late editor as one of that baser sort who deal in false representations.  Mr. Deedy Mr. Deedy By Henry James 9 would as soon have sent me to call on  Neil Paraday  as he would  have published a holiday-number; but such scruples presented  themselves as mere ignoble thrift to his successor, whose own  sincerity took the form of ringing door-bells and whose definition  of genius was the art of finding people at home. It was as if Mr.  Deedy  had published reports without his young men's having, as Mr. Pinhorn  would have said, really been there. I was unre-  generate, as I have hinted, and I was not concerned to straighten  out the journalistic morals of my chief, feeling them indeed to be  an abyss over the edge of which it was better not to peer. Really to be there this time moreover was a vision that made the idea of  writing something subtle about  Neil Paraday  only the more  inspiring. I would be as considerate as even  Mr. Deedy  could  have wished, and yet I should be as present as only  Mr. Pinhorn   could conceive. My allusion to the sequestered manner in which Mr. Paraday  lived (which had formed part of my explanation,  though I knew of it only by hearsay) was, I could divine, very  much what had made  Mr. Pinhorn  bite. It struck him as in-  consistent with the success of his paper that any one should be so  sequestered as that. Moreover, was not an immediate exposure of  everything just what the public wanted?  Mr. Pinhorn  effectually called me to order by reminding me of the promptness with which  I had met Miss Braby  at  Liverpool , on her return from her fiasco in  the  States . Hadn't we published, while its freshness and flavour  were unimpaired,  Miss Braby 's own version of that great inter-  national episode? I felt somewhat uneasy at this coupling of the  actress and the author, and I confess that after having enlisted  Mr. Pinhorn 's sympathies I procrastinated a little. I had succeeded  better than I wished, and I had, as it happened, work nearer at  hand. A few days later I called on  Lord Crouchley  and carried  off in triumph the most unintelligible statement that had yet appeared 10 The Death of the Lion appeared of his lordship's reasons for his change of front. I thus  set in motion in the daily papers columns of virtuous verbiage.  The following week I ran down to  Brighton  for a chat, as Mr.  Pinhorn  called it, with Mrs. Bounder , who gave me, on the subject of her divorce, many curious particulars that had not been articulated in court. If ever an article flowed from the primal  fount it was that article on  Mrs. Bounder . By this rime, however,  I became aware that  Neil Paraday 's new book was on the point of  appearing, and that its approach had been the ground of my  original appeal to  Mr. Pinhorn , who was now annoyed with me for having lost so many days. He bundled me off--we would at  least not lose another. I have always thought his sudden alertness a  remarkable example of the journalistic instinct. Nothing had  occurred, since I spoke to him, to create a visible urgency,  and no enlightenment could possibly have reached him. It was a  pure case of professional  flair --he had smelt the coming glory as  an animal smells its distant prey. II I may as well say at once that this little record pretends in no  degree to be a picture either of my introduction to  Mr. Paraday   or of certain proximate steps and stages. The scheme of my  narrative allows no space for these things and in any case a pro-  hibitory sentiment would be attached to my recollection of so rare  an hour. These meagre notes are essentially private, and if they see the light the insidious forces that, as my story itself shows,  make at present for publicity will simply have overmastered my  precautions. The curtain fell lately enough on the lamentable drama By Henry James 11 drama. My memory of the day I alighted at  Mr. Paraday 's door  is a fresh memory of kindness, hospitality, compassion, and of the  wonderful illuminating talk in which the welcome was conveyed.  Some voice of the air had taught me the right moment, the moment of his life at which an act of unexpected young allegiance  might most come home. He had recently recovered from a long,  grave illness. I had gone to the neighbouring inn for the night,  but I spent the evening in his company, and he insisted the next  day on my sleeping under his roof. I had not an indefinite leave: Mr. Pinhorn  supposed us to put out victims through on the  gallop. It was later, in the office, that the step was elaborated  and regulated. I fortified myself however, as my training had  taught me to do, by the conviction that nothing could be more advantageous for my article than to be written in the very atmo-  sphere. I said nothing to  Mr. Paraday  about it, but in the  morning, after my removal from the inn, while he was occupied in  his study, as he had notified me that he should need to be, I com- mitted to paper the quintessence of my impressions. Then  thinking to commend myself to  Mr. Pinhorn  by my celerity, I  walked out and posted my little packet before luncheon. Once  my paper was written I was free to stay on, and if it was designed  to divert attention from my frivolity in so doing I could reflect  with satisfaction that I had never been so clever I don't mean to  deny of course that I was aware it was much too good for  Mr.  Pinhorn ; but I was equally conscious that  Mr. Pinhorn  had the  supreme shrewdness of recognising from time to time the cases in  which an article was not too bad only because it was too good,  There was nothing he loved so much as to print on the right  occasion a thing he hated. I had begun my visit to  Mr. Paraday   on a Monday, and on the Wednesday his book came out. A copy  of it arrived by the  post, and he let me go out into the garden with 12 The Death of the Lion with it immediately after breakfast. I read it from beginning to  end that day, and in the evening he asked me to remain with him  the rest of the week and over the Sunday. That night my manuscript came back from  Mr. Pinhorn ,  accompanied with a letter, of which the gist was the desire to  know what I meant by sending him such stuff. That was the  meaning of the question, if not exactly its form, and it made my mistake immense to me. Such as this mistake was I could now  only look it in the face and accept it. I knew where I had failed,  but it was exactly where I couldn't have succeeded. I had been  sent down there to be personal, and in point of fact I hadn't been  personal at all; what I had sent up to London  was merely a little finicking, feverish study of my author's talent. Anything less  relevant to Mr. Pinhorn 's purpose couldn't well be imagined, and  he was visibly angry at my having (at his expense, with a second-  class ticket) approached the object of our arrangement only to be  so deucedly distant. For myself, I knew but too well what had happened, and how a miracle -- as pretty as some old miracle of legend -- had been wrought on the spot to save me. There had  been a big brush of wings, the flash of an opaline robe, and then,  with a great cool stir of the air, the sense of an angel's having  swooped down and caught me to his bosom. He held me only  till the danger was over, and it all took place in a minute. With  my manuscript back on my hands I understood the phenomenon  better, and the reflections I made on it are what I meant, at the  beginning of this anecdote, by my change of heart. Mr. Pinhorn 's  note was hot only a rebuke decidedly stern, but an invitation   immediately to send him (it was the case to say so) the genuine  article, the revealing and reverberating sketch to the promise of   which -- and of which alone -- I owed my squandered privilege. A  week or two later I recast my peccant paper, and giving it a particular By Henry James 13 particular application to  Mr. Paraday 's new book, obtained for it  the hospitality of another journal, where, I must admit,  Mr. Pin-  horn  was so far justified that it attracted not the least attention. III I was frankly, at the end of three days, a very prejudiced critic,  so that one morning when, in the garden,  Neil Paraday  had  offered to read me something I quite held my breath as I listened.  It was the written scheme of another book--something he had  put aside long ago, before his illness, and lately taken out again to  reconsider. He had been turning it round when I came down  upon him, and it had grown magnificently under this second hand. Loose, liberal, confident, it might have passed for a great gossiping, eloquent letter--the overflow into talk of an artist's amorous plan. The subject I thought singularly rich, quite the  strongest he had yet treated; and this familiar statement of it, full  too of fine maturities, was really, in summarised splendour, a mine  of gold, a precious, independent work. I remember rather pro-  fanely wondering whether the ultimate production could possibly  be so happy. His reading of the epistle, at any rate, made me  feel as if I were, for the advantage of posterity, in close corre-  spondence with him -- were the distinguished person to whom it had  been affectionately addressed. It was high distinction simply to  be told such things. The idea he now communicated had all the  freshness, the flushed fairness of the conception untouched and  untried: it was  Venus rising from the sea, before the airs had  blown upon her. I had never been so throbbingly present at such  an unveiling. But when he had tossed the last bright word after the 14 The Death of the Lion the others, as I had seen cashiers in banks, weighing mounds of  coin, drop a final sovereign into the tray, I became conscious of a  sudden prudent alarm. "My dear toaster, how, after all, are you going to do it?"  I  asked. "It's infinitely noble, but what rime it will take, what  patience and independence, what assured, what perfect conditions  it will demand! Oh for a lone isle in a tepid sea!" "Isn't this practically a lone isle, and aren't you, as an encircling medium, tepid enough?"  he replied; alluding with a laugh to the wonder of my young admiration and the narrow limits of his little provincial home.  "Time isn't what I’ve lacked hitherto: the  question hasn't been to find it, but to use it. Of course my  illness made a great hole, but I daresay there would have been a  hole at any rate. The earth we tread bas more pockets than a  billiard-table. The great thing is now to keep on my feet." "That's exactly what I mean." Neil Paraday  looked at me with eyes -- such pleasant eyes as he  had -- in which, as I now recall their expression, I seem to have  seen a dim imagination of his fate. He was fifty years old, and  his illness had been cruel, his convalescence slow. "It isn't as if  I weren't all right." "Oh, if you weren't all right I wouldn't look at you!"  I  tenderly said. We had both got up, quickened by the full sound of it all, and  he had lighted a cigarette. I had taken a fresh one, and, with an  intenser smile, by way of answer to my exclamation, he touched it  with the flame of his match.  "If I weren't better I shouldn't have  thought of  that !"  He flourished his epistle in his hand. "I don't want to be discouraging, but that's not true,"  I re-  turned. " I'm sure that during the months you lay here in pain  You had visitations sublime. You thought of a thousand things. You By Henry James 15 You think of more and more all the while. That's what makes  you, if you will pardon my familiarity, so respectable. At a time  when so many people are spent you come into your second wind.  But, thank God, all the same, you're better! Thank God, too,  you're not, as you were telling me yesterday,  'successful.'  If  you   weren't a failure, what would be the use of trying? That's my  one reserve on the subject of your recovery -- that it makes you "score,"  as the newspapers say. It looks well in the newspapers, and almost anything that does that is horrible.  'We are happy  to announce that  Mr. Paraday , the celebrated author, is again in  the enjoyment of excellent health.'  Somehow I shouldn't like to  see it." "You won't see it; I'm not in the least celebrated -- my  obscurity protects me. But couldn't you bear even to see I was  dying or dead?"  my companion asked. "Dead --  passe encore ; there's nothing so safe. One never  knows what a living artist may do -- one has mourned so many.  However, one must make the worst of it; you must be as dead as   you can." "Don't I meet that condition in having just published a book?" "Adequately, let us hope; for the book is verily a master- piece." At this moment the parlour-maid appeared in the door that  opened into the garden:  Paraday  lived at no great cost, and the  frisk of petticoats, with a timorous  "Sherry, sir?"  was about his  modest mahogany. He allowed hall his income to his wife, from  whom he had succeeded in separating without redundancy of legend. I had a general faith in his having behaved well, and I had once, in London , taken  Mrs. Paraday  down to dinner. He now turned to  speak to the maid, who offered him, on a trait, some card or note, while 16 The Death of the Lion while agitated, excited, I wandered to the end of the garden.  The idea of his security became supremely dear to me, and I asked  myself if I were the same young man who had come down a few  days before to scatter him to the four winds. When I retraced  my steps he had gone into the house and the woman (the second London  post had come in) had placed my letters and a newspaper  on a bench. I sat down there to the letters, which were a brief  business, and then, without heeding the address, took the paper  from its envelope. It was the journal of highest renown,  The  Empire  of that morning. It regularly camee to  Paraday , but I remembered that neither of us had yet looked at the copy already  delivered. This one had a great mark on the editorial page,  and, uncrumpling the wrapper, I saw it to be directed to my host  and stamped with the name of his publishers. I instantly divined  that  The Empire  had spoken of him, and I have not forgotten the  odd little shock of the circumstance. It checked all eagerness and  made me drop the paper a moment. As I sat there, conscious of  a palpitation, I think I had a vision of what was to be. I had  also a vision of the letter I would presently address to  Mr. Pinhorn , breaking as it were with  Mr. Pinhorn . Of course, however,  the next minute the voice of  The Empire  was in my ears. The article was not, I thanked Heaven, a review; it was a  leader, the last of three, presenting  Neil Paraday  to the human  race. His new book, the fifth from his hand, had been but a day or two out, and  The Empire , already aware of it, fired, as if on the  birth of a prince, a salure of a whole column. The guns had been  booming these three hours in the house without out suspecting  them. The big blundering newspaper had discovered him, and now he was proclaimed and anointed and crowned. His place was  assigned him as publicly as if a fat usher with a wand had pointed  to the topmost chair; he was to pass up and still up, higher and higher, By Henry James 17 higher, between the watching faces and the envious sounds -- away  up to the daïs and the throne. The article was a date; he had  taken rank at a bound -- waked up a national glory. A national  glory was needed, and it was an immense convenience he was there.  What all this meant rolled over me, and I fear I grew a little faint  --it meant so much more than I could say  "yea"  to on the spot.  land a flash, somehow, all was different; the tremendous wave I  speak of had swept something away. It had knocked down, I  suppose, my little customary altar, my twinkling tapers and my  flowers, and had reared itself into the likeness of a temple vast and  bare. When  Neil Paraday  should come out of the house he would  come out a contemporary. That was what had happened -- the  poor man was to be squeezed into his horrible age. I felt as if  he had been overtaken on the crest of the hill and brought back  to the city. A little more and he would have dipped down to posterity and escaped. IV When he came out it was exactly as if he had been in custody,  for beside him walked a stout man with a big black beard, who,  save that he wore spectacles, might have been a policeman, and  in whom at a second glance I recognised the highest contemporary  enterprise. "This is  Mr. Morrow ,"  said  Paraday , looking, I thought,  rather white; "he wants to publish heaven knows what about  me." I winced as I remembered that this was exactly what I myself  had wanted. "Already?"  I exclaimed, with a sort of sense that  my friend had fled to me for protection. The Yellow Book--Vol. I.  B Mr. Morrow 18 The Death of the Lion Mr. Morrow  glared, agreeably, through his glasses: they  suggested the electric headlights of some monstrous modern ship,  and I felt as if  Paraday  and I were tossing terrified under his  bows. I saw that his momentum was irresistible,  "I was  confident that I should be the  in the field,"  he declared. "A great interest is naturally felt in  Mr. Paraday 's surroundings." "I hadn't the least idea of it,"  said  Paraday , as if he had been  told he had been snoring. "I find he has not read the article in  The Empire ," Mr. Morrow   remarked to me.  "That's so very interesting -- something to  start with,"  he smiled. He had begun to pull off his gloves,  which were violently new, and to look encouragingly round the  little garden. As a  "surrounding"  I felt that I myself had  already been taken in; I was a little fish in the stomach of a  bigger one.  "I represent,"  our visitor continued,  "a syndicate of  influential journals, no less than thirty-seven, whose public --  whose publics, I may say -- are in peculiar sympathy with  Mr.  Paraday's  line of thought. They would greatly appreciate any  expression of his views on the subject of the art he so brilliantly  practises. Besides my connection with the syndicate just men-  tioned, I hold a particular commission from  The Tatler , whose  most prominent department,  Smatter and Chatter  -- I daresay  you've often enjoyed it -- attracts such attention. I was honoured  only last week, as a representative of  The Tatler , with the confi-  dence of  Guy Walsingham , the author of ' Obsessions .' She  expressed herself thoroughly pleased with my sketch of her  method; she went so far as to say that I had made her genius  more comprehensible even to herself." Neil Paraday  had dropped upon the garden-bench and sat there,  at once detached and confused; he looked hard at a bare spot in   the lawn, as if with an anxiety that had suddenly made him grave. His By Henry James 19 His movement had been interpreted by his visitor as an invitation  to sink sympathetically into a wicker chair that stood hard by,  and as  Mr. Morrow  so settled himself I felt that he had taken  official possession and that there was no undoing it. One had heard of unfortunate people's having  a man in the house, and  this was just what we had. There was a silence of a moment,  during which we seemed to acknowledge in the only way that  was possible the presence of universal fate; the sunny stillness  took no pity, and my thought, as I was sure  Paraday 's was doing,  performed within the minute a great distant revolution. I saw just how emphatic I should make my rejoinder to  Mr. Pinhorn ,  and that having come, like  Mr. Morrow , to betray, I must  remain as long as possible to save. Not because I had brought  my mind back, but because our visitor's last words were in my  ear, I presently inquired with gloomy irrelevance if  Guy Wals- ingham  were a woman. "Oh yes, a mere pseudonym; but convenient, you know, for  a lady who goes in for the larger latitude.  Obsessions , by Miss  So-and-So would look a little odd, but men are more naturally indelicate. Have you peeped into  Obsessions ?" Mr. Morrow   continued sociably to our companion. Paraday , still absent, remote, made no answer, as if he had not  heard the question: a manifestation that appeared to suit the  cheerful  Mr. Morrow  as well as any other. Imperturbably bland,  he was a man of resources -- he only needed to be on the spot.  He had pocketed the whole poor place while  Paraday  and I were woolgathering, and I could imagine that he had already got his heads.  His system, at any rate, was justified by the in-  evitability with which I replied, to save my friend the trouble: "Dear, no; he hasn't read it. He doesn't read such things!"  I unwarily added. Things 20 The Death of the Lion "Things that are too far over the fence, eh?"  I was indeed a  godsend to  Mr. Morrow . It was the psychological moment; it  determined the appearance of his notebook, which, however, he at   kept slightly behind him, as the dentist, approaching his victim, keeps his horrible forceps.  " Mr. Paraday  holds with the  good old proprieties -- I see!"  And, thinking of the thirty-seven  influential journals, I found myself, as I found poor  Paraday , help-  lessly gazing at the promulgation of this ineptitude. "There's  no point on which distinguished views are so acceptable as on this  question -- raised perhaps more strikingly than ever by Guy Wals-  ingham  -- of the permissibility of the larger latitude. I have an  appointment, precisely in connection with it, next week, with Dora Forbes , the author of  'The Other Way Round,'  which  everybody is talking about. Has  Mr. Paraday  glanced at 'The  Other Way Round' ?" Mr. Morrow  now frankly appealed to me. I took upon myself to repudiate the supposition, while our  companion, still silent, got up nervously and walked away. His  visitor paid no heed to his withdrawal; he only opened out the  notebook with a more motherly pat. " Dora Forbes , I gather, takes  the ground, the same as  Guy Walsingham 's, that the larger  latitude has simply got to come. He holds that it bas got to  squarely faced. Of course his sex makes him a less prejudiced  witness. But an authoritative word from Mr. Paraday  -- from the point of view of his sex, you know -- would go right round the globe. He takes the line that we haven't got to face it?" I was bewildered; it sounded somehow as if there were three  sexes. My interlocutor's pencil was poised, my private responsi-  bility great. I simply sat staring, however, and only, found  presence of mind to say: "Is this  Miss Forbes  a gentleman?" Mr. Morrow  hesitated an instant, smiling: "It wouldn't be "Miss"  -- there's a wife!" I By Henry James 21 "I mean is she a man?" "The wife?"  --  Mr. Morrow , for a moment, was as confused  as myself. But when I explained that I alluded to Dora Forbes   in person he informed me, with visible amusement at my being  so out of it, that this was the pen-name of an indubitable male  -- he had a big red moustache.  "He only assumes a feminine  personality because the ladies are such popular favourites. A great  deal of interest is felt in this assumption, and there's every pro-  spect of its being widely imitated."  Our host at this moment  joined us again, and  Mr. Morrow  remarked invitingly that he  should be happy to make a note of any observation the movement  in question, the bid for success under a lady’s name, might suggest  to  Mr. Paraday . But the poor man, without catching the allu-  tion, excused himself, pleading that, though he was greatly  honoured by his visitor's interest, he suddenly felt unwell and  should have to take leave of him -- have to go and lie down and  keep quiet. His young friend might be trusted to answer for  him, but he hoped  Mr. Morrow  didn't expect great things even  of his young friend. His young friend, at this moment, looked  at  Neil Paraday  with an anxious eye, greatly wondering if he were  doomed to be ill again; but  Paraday 's own kind face met his ques-  tion reassuringly, seemed to say in a glance intelligible enough: "Oh, I'm not ill, but I'm scared: get him out of the house as  quietly as possible."  Getting newspaper-men out of the house was  odd business for an emissary of  Mr. Pinhorn , and I was so exhila-  rated by the idea of it that I called after him as he left us: "Read the article in  The Empire , and you'll soon be all  right!" 22 The Death of the Lion V "Delicious my having come down to tell him of it!" Mr.  Morrow  ejaculated.  "My cab was at the door twenty minutes  after  The Empire  had been laid upon my breakfast-table. Now  what have you got for me?"  he continued, dropping again into  his chair, from which, however, the next moment he quickly  rose.  "I was shown into the drawing-room, but there must be  more to see--his study, his literary sanctum, the little things he  has about, or other domestic objects or features. He wouldn't be  lying down on his study-table? There's a great interest always  felt in the scene of an author's labours. Sometimes we're favoured  with very delightful peeps.  Dora Forbes  showed me all his table- drawers, and almost jammed my hand into one into which I made  a dash! I don't ask that of you, but if we could talk things  over right there where he sits I feel as if I should get the  keynote." I had no wish whatever to be rude to  Mr. Morrow , I was  much too initiated not to prefer the safety of other ways; but I  had a quick inspiration and I entertained an insurmountable, an  almost superstitious objection to his crossing the threshold of my  friend's little lonely, shabby, consecrated workshop. "No,  we sha'n't get at his lire that way,"  I said.  "The way to get at  his lire is to -- But wait a moment!"  I broke off and went  quickly into the house; then, in three minutes, I reappeared before Mr. Morrow  with the two volumes of Paraday 's new book. "His life's here"  I went on,  "and I'm so full of this admirable thing that I can't talk of anything else. The artist's life's his  work, and this is the place to observe him. What he has to tell us By Henry James 23 us he tells us with  this  perfection. My dear sir, the best inter-  viewer's the best reader." Mr. Morrow  good-humouredly protested. "Do you mean to  say that no other source of information should be opened to us?" "None other till this particular one -- by far the most copious --  has been quite exhausted. Have you exhausted it, my dear sir  Had you exhausted it when you came down here? It seems to  me in our time almost wholly neglected, and something should  surely be done to restore its ruined credit. It's the course to  which the artist himself at every step, and with such pathetic  confidence, refers us. This last book of  Mr. Paraday 's is full of  revelations." "Revelations."  panted  Mr. Morrow , whom I had forced  again into his chair. "The only kind that count. It tells you with a perfection that  seems to me quite final all the author thinks, for instance, about the  advent of the larger latitude." "Where does it do that?"  asked  Mr. Morrow , who had picked  up the second volume and was insincerely thumbing it. "Everywhere -- in the whole treatment of his case. Extract the opinion, disengage the answer -- those are the real acts of homage." Mr. Morrow , after a minute, tossed the book away.  "Ah, but  you mustn't take me for a reviewer." "Heaven forbid I should take you for anything so dreadful!  You came down to perform a little act of sympathy, and so, I  may confide to you, did I. Let us perform our little act together.  These pages overflow with the testimony we want: let us read  them and taste them and interpret them. You will of course  have perceived for yourself that one scarcely does read  Neil  Paraday  till one reads him aloud; he gives out to the ear an extra-  Ordinary quality, and it's only when you expose it confidently to that 24 The Death of the Lion that test that you really get near his style. Take up your book  again and let me listen, while you pay it out, to that wonderful  fifteenth chapter. If you feel that you can't do it justice, compose  yourself to attention while I produce for you -- I think I can! --  this scarcely less admirable ninth." Mr. Morrow  gave me a straight glance which was as hard as a  blow between the eyes; he had turned rather red and a question had  formed itselfin his mind which reached my sense as distinctly as if  he had uttered it:  "What sort of a damned fool are you?" Then  he got up, gathering together his hat and gloves, buttoning his coat, projecting hungrily all over the place the big transparency of  his mask. It seemed to flare over  Fleet Street and somehow  made the actual spot distressingly humble: there was so little for  it to feed on unless he counted the blisters of our stucco or saw his way to do something with the roses. Even the poor roses  were common kinds. Presently his eyes fell upon the manuscript  from which  Paraday  had been reading to me and which still lay on  the bench. As my own followed them I saw that it looked promising, looked pregnant, as if it gently throbbed with the lire  the reader had given it.  Mr. Morrow  indulged in a nod toward  it and a vague thrust of his umbrella.  "What's that?" "Oh, it's a plan -- a secret." "A secret!"  There was an instant's silence, and then  Mr.  Morrow  made another movement. I may have been mistaken,  but it affected me as the translated impulse of the desire to lay  hands on the manuscript, and this led me to indulge in a quick  anticipatory grab which may very well have seemed ungraceful, or even impertinent, and which at any rate left  Mr. Paraday 's two  admirers very erect, glaring at each other while one of them held  a bundle of papers well behind him. An instant later Mr.  Morrow  quitted me abruptly, as if he had really carried some- thing By Henry James 25 thing away. To reassure myself, watching his broad back recede,  I only grasped my manuscript the tighter. He went to the  back-door of the house, the one he had come out from, but on  trying the handle he appeared to find it fastened. So he passed  round into the front garden, and, by listening intently enough, I  could presently hear the outer gate close behind him with a bang.  I thought again of the thirty-seven influential journals and  wondered what would be his revenge. I hasten to add that he was rnagnanimous: which was just the most dreadful thing he could  have been. The Tatler  published a charming, chatty, familiar  account of  Mr. Paraday 's "Home-life," and on the wings of the  thirty-seven influential journals it went, to use  Mr. Morrow 's own  expression, right round the globe. VI A week later, early in May, my glorified friend came up to  town, where, it may be veraciously recorded, he was the king of  the beasts of the year. No advancement was ever more rapid, no  exaltation more complete, no bewilderment more teachable. His  book sold but moderately, though the article in  The Empire  had  done unwonted wonders for it; but he circulated in person in a  manner that the libraries might well have envied. His formula  had been found -- he was a revelation. His momentary terror  had been real, just as mine had been -- the overclouding of his  passionate desire to be left to finish his work. He was far from  unsociable, but he had the finest conception of being let alone  that I have ever met. For the time, however, he took his profit  where it seemed most to crowd upon him, having in his pocket the 26 The Death of the Lion the portable sophistries about the nature of the artist's task.  Observation too was a kind of work and experience a kind of  success;  London  dinners were all material and  London  ladies  were fruitful toil.  "No one has the faintest conception of what  I'm trying for,"  he said to me, "and not many have read three  pages that I've written; but they're all enthusiastic, enchanted,  devoted."  He found himself in truth equally amused and fatigued;  but the fatigue had the merit of being a new sort, and the phantas-  magoric town was perhaps after all less of a battlefield than the  haunted study. He once told me that he had had no personal life  to speak of since his fortieth year, but had had more than was  good for him before.  London  closed the parenthesis and exhibited  him in relations; one of the most inevitable of these being that in  which he found himself to  Mrs. Weeks Wimbush , wife of the  boundless brewer and proprietress of the universal menagerie.  In this establishment, as everybody knows, on occasions when the  crush is great, the animais rub shoulders freely with the spectators  and the lions sit down for whole evenings with the lambs. It had been ominously clear to me from the  that in  Neil  Paraday  this lady, who, as all the world agreed, was tremendous  fun, considered that she had secured a prime attraction, a creature  of almost heraldic oddity. Nothing could exceed ber enthusiasm  over ber capture, and nothing could exceed the confused apprehen-  sions it excited in me. I had an instinctive fear of her which I  tried without effect to conceal from her victim, but which I let  her perceive with perfect impunity.  Paraday heeded it, but she  never did, for her conscience was that of a romping child. She was  a blind, violent force, to which I could attach no more idea of  responsibility than to the hum of a spinning-top. It was difficult to say what she conduced to but to circulation. She was constructed  of sted and leather, and all I asked of her for our tractable friend was By Henry James 27 was not to do him to death. He had consented for a time to be  of indiarubber, but my thoughts were fixed on the day he should  resume his shape or at least get back into his box. It was evi-  dently all right, but I should be glad when it was well over. I  was simply nervous -- the impression was ineffaceable of the hour  when, after  Mr. Morrow 's departure, I had found him on the sofa  in his study. That pretext of indisposition had not in the least been meant as a snub to the envoy of  The Tatler  -- he had gone  to lie down in very truth. He had felt a pang of his old pain, the \  result of the agitation wrought in him by this forcing open of a  new period. His old programme, his old ideal even had to be  changed. Say what one would, success was a complication and recognition had to be reciprocal. The monastic life, the pious  illumination of the missal in the convent cell were things of the  gathered past. It didn't engender despair, but it at least required  adjustment. Before I left him on that occasion we had passed a  bargain, my part of which was that I should make it my business  to take care of him. Let whoever would represent the interest in  his presence (I had a mystical prevision of  Mrs. Weeks Wimbush ),  I should represent the interest in his work -- in other words, in his  absence. These two interests were in their essence opposed; and  I doubt, as youth is fleeting, if I shall ever again know the  intensity of joy with which I felt that in so good a cause I was  willing to make myself odious. One day, in  Sloane Street , I found myself questioning  Paraday 's  landlord, who had come to the door in answer to my knock. Two  vehicles, a barouche and a smart hansom, were drawn up before  the house. "In the drawing-room, sir?  Mrs. Weeks Wimbush." "And in the dining-room?" "A young lady, sir -- waiting: I think a foreigner." It 28 The Death of the Lion It was three o'clock, and on days when  Paraday  didn't lunch  out he attached a value to these subjugated hours. On which  days, however, didn't the dear man lunch out? Mrs. Wimbush ,  at such a crisis, would have rushed round immediately after her  own repast. I went into the dining-room , postponing the  pleasure of seeing how, upstairs, the lady of the barouche would,  on my arrival, point the moral of my sweet solicitude. No one  took such an interest as herself in his doing only what was good  for him, and she was always on the spot to see that he did it.  She made appointments with him to discuss the best means of economising his time and protecting his privacy. She further  made his health her special business, and had so much sympathy  with my own zeal for it that she was the author of pleasing  fictions on the subject of what my devotion had led me to give  up. I gave up nothing (I don't count  Mr. Pinhorn ) because I  had nothing, and all I had as yet achieved was to find myself  also in the menagerie. I had dashed in to save my friend, but I  had only got domesticated and wedged; so that I could do nothing  for him but exchange with him over people's heads looks of  intense but futile intelligence. VII The young lady in the dining-room had a brave face, black  hair, blue eyes, and in her lap a big volume.  "I've come for his  autograph,"  she said, when I had explained to her that I was  under bonds to see people for him when he was occupied.  "I've  been waiting half an bout, but I'm prepared to wait all day."  I  don't know whether it was this that told me she was American, for By Henry James 29 for the propensity to wait all day is not in general characteristic  of her race. I was enlightened probably not so much by the  spirit of the utterance as by some quality of its sound. At an y rate I saw she had an individual patience and a lovely frock, to-  gether with an expression that played among her pretty features  as a breeze among flowers. Putting her book upon the table, she  showed me a massive album, showily bound and full of autographs  of price. The collection of faded notes, of still more faded "thoughts,"  of quotations, platitudes, signatures, represented a  formidable purpose. "Most people apply to  Mr. Paraday  by letter, you know,"  I said. "Yes, but he doesn't answer, I’ve written three times." "Very true,"  I reflected;  "the sort of letter you mean goes straight into the fire." "How do you know the sort I mean?"  my interlocutress  asked. She had blushed and smiled and in a moment she added: "I don't believe he gets many like them!" "I'm sure they're beautiful, but he burns without reading."  I  didn't add that I had told him he ought to. "Isn't he then in danger of burning things of importance?" "He would be, if distinguished men hadn't an infallible nose for  a petition."  She looked at me a moment -- her face was sweet and gay. "Do  you  burn without reading, too?"  she asked; in answer to  which I assured her that if she would trust me with her repository  I would see that  Mr. Paraday  should write his name in it.  She considered a little.  "That's very well, but it wouldn't  make me see him." "Do you want very much to see him?"  It seemed ungracious  to catechise so charming a creature, but somehow I had never yet  taken my duty to the great author so seriously. Enough 30 The Death of the Lion "Enough to have come from  America  for the purpose."   I stared.  "All alone?" "I don't see that that's exactly your business; but if it will  make me more appealing I will confess that I am quite by myself.  I had to come alone or not at all." She was interesting; I could imagine that she had lost parents,  natural protectors -- could conceive even that she had inherited  money. I was in a phase of my own fortunes when keeping  hansoms at doors seemed to me pure swagger. As a trick of  this frank and delicate girl, however, it became romantic -- a part  of the general romance of her freedom, her errand, her innocence.  The confidence of young Americans was notorious, and I speedily  arrived at a conviction that no impulse could have been more  generous than the impulse that had operated here. I foresaw at that moment that it would make her my peculiar charge, just as cir- cumstances had made  Neil Paraday . She would be another person  to look after, and one's honour would be concerned in guiding  her straight. These things became clearer to me later; at the  instant I had scepticism enough to observe to her, as I turned the pages of her volume, that her net had, all the same, caught many a  big fish. She appeared to have had fruitful access to the great  ones of the earth; there were people moreover whose signatures  she had presumably secured without a personal interview. She  couldn't have waylaid  George Washington  and  Friedrich Schiller   and  Hannah More . She met this argument, to my surprise, by  throwing up the album without a pang. It wasn't even her own;  she was responsible for none of its treasures. It belonged to a girl-friend in  America , a young lady in a western city. This  young lady had insisted on her bringing it, to pick up more auto-  graphs: she thought they might like to see, in  Europe , in what  company they would be. The girlfriend,  the western city, the By Henry James 31 the immortal names, the curious errand, the idyllic faith, all made  a story as strange to me, and as beguiling, as some tale in the Arabian Nights . Thus it was that my informant had encum-  bered herself with the ponderous tome; but she hastened to as sure me that this was the  time she had brought it out. For her visit to  Mr. Paraday  it had simply been a pretext. She didn't  really care a straw that he should write his name; what she did  want was to look straight into his face. I demurred a little.  "And why do you require to do that?" "Because I just love him!"  Before I could recover from the  agitating effect of this crystal ring my companion had continued: "Hasn't there ever been any face that you've wanted to look into?" How could I tell her so soon how much I appreciated the  opportunity of looking into hers? I could only assent in general  to the proposition that there were certainly for every one such  faces; and I felt that the crisis demanded all my lucidity, all my  wisdom.  "Oh, yes, I'm a student of physiognomy. Do you  mean,"  I pursued,  "that you've a passion for Mr. Paraday 's  books?" "They've been everything to me -- I know them by heart.  They've completely taken hold of me. There's no author about  whom I feel as I do about  Neil Paraday ." "Permit me to remark then,"  I presently rejoined,  "that  you're one of the right sort." "One of the enthusiasts? Of course I am!" "Oh, there are enthusiasts who are quite of the wrong. I  mean you're one of those to whom an appeal can be made." "An appeal?"  Her face lighted as if with the chance of some  great sacrifice. If she was ready for one it was only waiting for her, and in a moment 32 The Death of the Lion moment I mentioned it.  "Give up this rigid purpose of seeing  him. Go away without it. That will be far better." She looked mystified; then she turned visibly pale.  "Why,  hasn't he any personal charm?"  The girl was terrible and laugh-  able in her bright directness. "Ah, that dreadful word  personal !"  I exclaimed; "we're  dying of it, and you women bring it out with murderous effect.  When you encounter a genius as fine as this idol of ours, let him  off the dreary duty of being a personality as well. Know him only by what's best in him, and spare him for the same sweet sake." My young lady continued to look at me in confusion and mis-  trust, and the result of her reflection on what I had just said  was to make her suddenly break out:  "Look here, sir -- what's the  matter with him?" "The matter with him is that, if he doesn't look out, people  will eat a great hole in his life." She considered a moment.  "He hasn't any disfigurement?" "Nothing to speak of!" "Do you mean that social engagements interfere with his occu- pations?" "That but feebly expresses it." "So that he can't give himself up to his beautiful imagin-  ation?" "He's badgered, bothered, overwhelmed, on the pretext of  being applauded. People expect him to give them his time, his  golden time, who wouldn't themselves give five shillings for one of  his books." "Five? I'd give five thousand!" "Give your sympathy -- give your forbearance. Two-s of  those who approach him only do it to advertise themselves." Why By Henry James 33 "Why, it’s too bad!"  the girl exclaimed, with the face of an angel. I followed up my advantage.  "There's a lady with him now  who's a terrible complication, and who yet hasn't read, I am sure,  ten pages that he ever wrote." My visitor's wide eyes grew tenderer.  "Then how does she  talk?" "Without ceasing. I only mention her as a single case. Do  you want to know how to show a superlative consideration?  Simply, avoid him." "Avoid him?"  she softly wailed. "Don't force him to have to take account of you; admire him  in silence, cultivate him at a distance and secretly, appropriate his  message. Do you want to know,"  I continued, warming to  my idea,  "how to perform an act of homage really sublime?"   Then as she hung on mg words:  "Succeed in never seeing  him!" "Never?"  she pathetically gasped. "The more you get into his writings the less you'll want to;  and you'll be immensely sustained by the thought of the good  you're doing him." She looked at me without resentment or spite, and at the truth  I had put before her with candour, credulity and pity. I was  afterwards happy to remember that she must have recognised in  my face the liveliness of my interest in herself.  "I think I see  what you mean." "Oh, I express it badly; but I should be delighted if you would  let me come to see you -- to explain it better." She made no response to this, and her thoughtful eyes fell on  the big album, on which she presently laid her hands as if to take  it away.  "I did use to say out West that they might write a little The Yellow Book -- Vol. I.  C less 34 The Death of the Lion less for autographs (to all the great poets, you know) and study  the thoughts and style a little more." "What do they care for the thoughts and style? They didn't  even understand you. I'm not sure,"  I added,  "that I do myself,  and I daresay that you by no means make me out."  She had got  up to go, and though I wanted her to succeed in not seeing  Neil  Paraday  I wanted her also, inconsequently, to remain in the house.  I was at any rate far from desiring to hustle her off. As Mrs.  Weeks Wimbush , upstairs, was still saving our friend in her own  way, I asked my young lady to let me briefly relate, in illustration  of my point, the little incident of my having gone clown into the  country for a profane purpose and been converted on the spot to  holiness. Sinking again into her chair to listen, she showed a deep  interest in the anecdote. Then, thinking it over gravely she ex-  claimed with her odd intonation: "Yes, but you do see him!"  I had to admit that this was the  case; and I was not so prepared with an effective attenuation as I  could have wished. She eased the situation off, however, by the  charming quaintness with which she finally said:  "Well, I  wouldn't want him to be lonely!"  This time she rose in earnest,  but I persuaded her to let me keep the album to show to  Mr.  Paraday . I assured her I would bring it back to her myself. "Well, you'll find my address somewhere in it, on a paper!"  she sighed resignedly, as she took leave. VIII I blush to confess it, but I invited  Mr. Paraday  that very day  to transcribe into the album one of his most characteristic passages. I By Henry James 35 I told him how I had got rid of the strange girl who had brought  it -- her ominous name was  Miss Hurter  and she lived at an hotel;  quite agreeing with him moreover as to the wisdom of getting  rid with equal promptitude of the book itself. This was why I carried it to  Albemarle Street  no later than on the morrow. I  failed to find her at home, but she wrote to me and I went again:  she wanted so much to hear more about  Neil Paraday . I returned  repeatedly, I may briefly declare, to supply her with this informa-  tion. She had been immensely taken, the more she thought of it,  with that idea of mine about the act of homage: it had ended by  filling her with a generous rapture. She positively desired to do  something sublime for him, though indeed I could see that, as this  particular flight was difficult, she appreciated the fact that my visits  kept her up. I had it on my conscience to keep her up; I  neglected nothing that would contribute to it, and her conception  of our cherished author's independence became at last as fine as his  own conception.  "Read him, read him,"  I constantly repeated;  while, seeking him in his works, she represented herself as con-  vinced that, according to my assurance, this was the system that  had, as she expressed it, weaned her. We read him together when  I could find time, and the generous creature's sacrifice was fed by  our conversation. There were twenty selfish women, about whom  I told her, who stirred her with a beautiful rage. Immediately  after my  visit her sister,  Mrs. Milsom , came over from  Paris ,  and the two ladies began to present, as they called it, their letters.  I thanked our stars that none had been presented to  Mr. Paraday .  They received invitations and dined out, and some of these occa-  sions enabled Fanny Hurter  to perform, for consistency's sake,  touching feats of submission. Nothing indeed would now have  induced her even to look at the object of her admiration. Once, hearing his name announced at a party, she instantly left the room by 36 The Death of the Lion by another door and then straightway quitted the house. At  another time, when I was at the opera with them ( Mrs. Milsom   had invited me to their box) I attempted to point Mr. Paraday   out to her in the stalls. On this she asked her sister to change  places with her, and, while that lady devoured the great man  through a powerful glass, presented, all the rest of the evening,  her inspired back to the house. To torment her tenderly I pressed  the glass upon her, telling her how wonderfully near it brought our  friend's handsome head. By way of answer she simply looked at me  in grave silence; on which I saw that tears had gathered in her eyes.  These tears, I may remark, produced an effect on me of which  the end is not yet. There was a moment when I felt it my  duty to mention them to  Neil Paraday ; but I was deterred by the reflection that there were questions more relevant to his happiness. These questions indeed, by the end of the season, were reduced  to a single one -- the question of reconstituting, so far as might be  possible, the conditions under which he had produced his best  work. Such conditions could never all come back, for there was  a new one that took up too much place; but some perhaps were  not beyond recall. I wanted above all things to see him sit down  to the subject of which, on my making his acquaintance, he had  read me that admirable sketch. Something told me there was no security but in his doing so before the new factor, as we used to say  at Mr. Pinhorn 's, should render the problem incalculable. It only  half reassured me that the sketch itself was so copious and so eloquent  that even at the worst there would be the making of a small but com-  plete book, a tiny volume which, for the faithful, might well become  an object of adoration. There would even not be wanting critics  to declare, I foresaw, that the plan was a thing to be more thankful  for than the structure to have been reared on it. My impatience for By Henry James 37 for the structure, none the less, grew and grew with the interrup-  tions. He had, on coming up to town, begun to sit for his portrait  to a young painter,  Mr. Rumble , whose little game, as we used to  say at  Mr. Pinhorn 's, was to be the  to perch on the shoulders  of renown.  Mr. Rumble 's studio was a circus in which the man  of the hour, and still more the woman, leaped through the hoops  of his showy frames almost as electrically as they burst into tele-  grams and "specials."  He pranced into the exhibitions on their  back; he was the reporter on canvas, the  Vandyke  up to date,  and there was one roaring year in which Mrs. Bounder  and  Miss  Braby ,  Guy Walsingham  and  Dora Forbes proclaimed in chorus  from the same pictured walls that no one had yet got ahead of  him. Paraday  had been promptly caught and saddled, accepting with  characteristic good-humour his confidential hint that to figure in  his show was not so much a consequence as a cause of immortality.  From  Mrs. Wimbush  to the last  "representative"  who called to  ascertain his twelve favourite dishes, it was the same ingenuous  assumption that he would rejoice in the repercussion. There  were moments when I fancied I might have had more patience  with them if they had not been so fatally benevolent. I hated,  at all events,  Mr. Rumble 's picture, and had my bottled resent-  ment ready when, later on, I found my distracted friend had  been stuffed by  Mrs. Wimbush  into the mouth of another cannon.  A young artist in whom she was intensely interested, and who  had no connection with  Mr. Rumble , was to show how far he  could shoot him. Poor  Paraday , in return, was naturally to write  something somewhere about the young artist. She played her  victims against each other with admirable ingenuity, and her establishment was a huge machine in which the tiniest and the  biggest wheels went round to the same treadle. I had a scene with 38 The Death of the Lion with her in which I tried to express that the function of such a  man was to exercise his genius -- not to serve as a hoarding for  pictorial posters. The people I was perhaps angriest with were  the editors of magazines who had introduced what they called new  features, so aware were they that the newest feature of all would  be to make him grind their axes by contributing his views on  vital topics and taking part in the periodical prattle about the  future of fiction. I made sure that before I should have done  with him there would scarcely be a current form of words left  me to be sick of; but meanwhile I could make surer still of my  animosity to bustling ladies for whom he drew the water that  irrigated their social flower-beds. I had a battle with  Mrs. Wimbush  over the artist she protected,  and another over the question of a certain week, at the end of  July, that  Mr. Paraday appeared to have contracted to spend with  her in the country. I protested against this visit; I intimated  that he was too unwell for hospitality without a  nuance , for caresses  without imagination; I begged he might rather take the time in  some restorative way. A sultry air of promises, of reminders hung  over his August, and he would great]y profit by the interval of  test. He had not told me he was ill again -- that he had a  warning; but I had not needed this, and I found his reticence  his worst symptom. The only thing he said to me was that he  believed a comfortable attack of something or other would set him  up: it would put out of the question everything but the exemp- tions he prized. I am afraid I shall have presented him as a  martyr in a very small cause if I fail to explain that he surren-  dered himself much more liberally than I surrendered him. He  filled his lungs, for the most part, with the comedy of his queer  fate: the tragedy was in the spectacles through which I chose to  look. He was conscious of inconvenience, and above all of a great By Henry James 39 great renouncement; but how could he have heard a mere dirge  in the bells of his accession? The sagacity and the jealousy were  mine, and his the impressions and the anecdotes. Of course, as  regards  Mrs. Wimbush ; I was worsted in my encounters, for was  not the state of his health the very reason for his coming to her  at  Prestidge ? Wasn't it precisely at Prestidge  that he was to  be coddled, and wasn't the dear  Princess  coming to help her to  coddle him? The dear  Princess , now on a visit to  England , was  of a famous foreign house, and, in her gilded cage, with her retinue  of keepers and feeders, was the most expensive specimen in the  good lady's collection. I don't think her august presence had had  to do with  Paraday 's consenting to go, but it is not impossible  that he had operated as a bait to the illustrious stranger. The  party had been made up for him,  Mrs. Wimbush  averred, and  every one was counting on it, the dear  Princess  most of all. If he  was well enough he was to read them something absolutely fresh,  and it was on that particular prospect the  Princess  had set her  heart. She was so fond of genius, in  any  walk of life, and she was  so used to it, and understood it so well; she was the greatest of Mr. Paraday 's admirers, she devoured everything he wrote. And  then he read like an angel.  Mrs. Wimbush  reminded me that he  had again and again given her,  Mrs. Wimbush , the privilege of  listening to him. I looked at her a moment.  "What has he read to you"  I  crudely inquired. For a moment too she met my eyes, and for the fraction of a  moment she hesitated and coloured,  "Oh, all sorts of things!" I wondered whether this were a perfect fib or only an imperfect Recollection, and she quite understood my unuttered comment on  her perception of such things. But if she could forget  Neil  Paraday 's beauties she could of course forget my rudeness, and three 40 The Death of the Lion three days later she invited me, by telegraph, to join the party at Prestidge . This time she might indeed have had a story about  what I had given up to be near the toaster. I addressed from  that fine residence several communications to a young lady in London , a young lady whom, I confess, I quitted with reluctance  and whom the reminder of what she herself could give up was  required to make me quit at all. It adds to the gratitude I owe  her on other grounds that she kindly allows me to transcribe from my letters a few of the passages in which that hateful sojourn is   candidly commemorated. IX &quot;I suppose I ought to enjoy the joke,&quot; I wrote, &quot;of what's going on here, but somehow it doesn't amuse me. Pessimism on  the contrary possesses me and cynicism solicits. I positively feel  my own flesh sore from the brass nails in  Neil Paraday 's social  harness. The house is full of people who like him, as they mention, awfully, and with whom his talent for talking nonsense  has prodigious success. I delight in his nonsense myself; why is  it therefore that I grudge these happy folk their artless satisfac-  tion? Mystery of the human heart -- abyss of the critical spirit! Mrs. Wimbush  thinks she can answer that question, and as my  want of gaiety has at last worn out her patience she has given me  a glimpse of her shrewd guess. I am made restless by the selfish-  ness of the insincere friend -- I want to monopolise Paraday  in  order that he may push me on. To be intimate with him is a  feather in my cap; it gives me an importance that I couldn't  naturally pretend to, and I seek to deprive him of social refresh-  ment because I fear that meeting more disinterested people may enlighten By Henry James 41 enlighten him as to my real spirit. All the disinterested people  here are his particular admirers and have been carefully selected as  such. There is supposed to be a copy of his last book in the   house, and in the hall I come upon ladies, in attitudes, bending  gracefully over the  volume. I discreetly avert my eyes, and  when I next look round the precarious joy has been superseded by  the book of life. There is a sociable circle or a confidential  couple, and the relinquished volume lies open on its face, as if it  had been dropped under extreme coercion. Somebody else pre- sently finds it and transfers it, with its air of momentary deso-  lation, to another piece of furniture. Every one is asking every  one about it all day, and every one is telling every one where they  put it last. I'm sure it's rather smudgy about the twentieth page.  I have a strong impression too that the second volume is lost --  has been packed in the bag of some departing guest; and yet  everybody has the impression that somebody else has read to the  end. You see therefore that the beautiful book plays a great  part in our conversation. Why should I take the occasion of  such distinguished honours to say that I begin to see deeper into Gustave Flaubert's  doleful refrain about the hatred of literature?  I refer you again to the perverse constitution of man. &quot;The  Princess  is a massive lady with the organisation of an  athlete and the confusion of tongues of a  valet de place . She  contrives to commit herself extraordinarily little in a great many  languages, and is entertained and conversed with in detachments  and relays, like an institution which goes on from generation to  generation or a big building contracted for under a forfeit. She  can't have a personal taste, any more than, when her husband  succeeds, she can have a personal crown, and her opinion on any  matter is rusty and heavy and plain -- made, in the night of ages,  to last and be transmitted. I feel as if I ought to pay some one a fee 42 The Death of the Lion fee for my glimpse of it. She has been told everything in the  world and has never perceived anything, and the echoes of her  education respond awfully to the rash footfall -- I mean the casual  remark -- in the cold Valhalla of her memory.  Mrs. Wimbush delights in her wit and says there is nothing so charming as to  hear Mr. Paraday  draw it out. He is perpetually detailed for this  job, and he tells me it has a peculiarly exhausting effect. Every  one is beginning -- at the end of two days -- to sidle obsequiously  away from her, and  Mrs. Wimbush  pushes him again and again into  the breach: None of the uses I have yet seen him put to irritate me quite so much. He looks very fagged, and has at last confessed  to me that his condition makes him uneasy -- has even promised  me that he will go straight home instead of returning to his final  engagements in town. Last night I had some talk with him  about going to-day, cutting his visit short; so sure am I that he  will be better as soon as he is shut up in his lighthouse. He told  me that this is what he would like to do; reminding me, how-  ever, that the  lesson of his greatness has been precisely that  he can't do what he likes.  Mrs. Wimbush  would never forgive  him if he should leave her before the  Princess  has received the last hand. When I say that a violent rupture with our hostess  would be the best thing in the world for him he gives me to  understand that if his reason assents to the proposition his courage  hangs wofully back. He makes no secret of being mortally afraid  of her, and when I ask what harm she can do him that she hasn't  already done he simply repeats:  "I'm afraid, I'm afraid! Don't   inquire too closely,"  he said last night;  "only believe that I feel  a sort of terror. It's strange, when she's so kind! At any rate,  I would as soon overturn that piece of priceless  Sèvres  as tell her  that I must go before my date."  It sounds dreadfully weak, but  he has some reason, and he pays for his imagination, which puts him By Henry James 43 him (I should hate it) in the place of others and makes him feel,  even against himself, their feelings, their appetites, their motives.  He's so beastly intelligent. Besides, the famous reading is still to  come off, and it has been postponed a day, to allow  Guy Walsing-  ham  to arrive. It appears that this eminent lady is staying at a  house a few miles off, which means of course that  Mrs. Wimbush   has forcibly annexed her. She's to come over in a day or two -- Mrs. Wimbush  wants her to hear  Mr. Paraday . &quot;To-day's wet and cold, and several of the company, at the  invitation of the Duke, have driven over to luncheon at  Bigwood .  I saw poor  Paraday  wedge himself, by command, into the little supplementary seat of a brougham in which the  Princess  and our  hostess were already ensconced. If the front glass isn't open on  his dear old back perhaps he'll survive. Bigwood , I believe, is very  grand and frigid, all marble and precedence, and I wish him well  out of the adventure. I can't tell you how much more and more  your attitude to him, in the midst of all this, shines out by contrast.  I never willingly talk to these people about him, but see what a  comfort I find it to scribble to you! I appreciate it; it keeps me  warm; there are no fires in the house. Mrs. Wimbush  goes by  the calendar, the temperature goes by the weather, the weather  goes by God knows what, and the  Princess  is easily heated. I  have nothing but my acrimony to warm me, and have been out under an umbrella to restore my circulation. Coming in an hour  ago, I found Lady Augusta Minch  rummaging about the hall.  When I asked her what she was looking for she said she had mislaid something that  Mr. Paraday  had lent her. I ascertained  in a moment that the article in question is a manuscript and I  have a foreboding that it's the noble morsel he read me six weeks  ago. When I expressed my surprise that he should have passed about anything so precious (I happen to know it's his only copy -- in 44 The Death of the Lion in the most beautiful hand in all the world)  Lady Augusta  confessed  to me that she had not had it from himself, but from  Mrs.  Wimbush , who had wished to give her a glimpse of it as a salve  for her not being able to stay and hear it read. &quot; "Is that the piece he's to read,"  I asked,  "when  Guy Wals-  ingham  arrives?" &quot; "It's not for  Guy Walsingham they're waiting now, it's for Dora Forbes ," Lady Augusta  said.  "She's coming, I believe, early  to-morrow. Meanwhile  Mrs. Wimbush  has found out about  him and is actively wiring to him. She says he also must hear him." &quot; "You bewilder me a little,"  I replied;  "in the age we live in  one gets lost among the genders and the pronouns. The clear thing is that  Mrs. Wimbush  doesn't guard such a treasure as  jealously as she might." &quot; "Poor dear, she has the  Princess to guard!  Mr. Paraday  lent  her the manuscript to look over." &quot; "Did she speak as if it were the morning paper?" &quot; Lady Augusta  stared -- my irony was lost upon her.  "She  didn't have time, so she gave me a chance ; because unfor-  tunately I go to-morrow to  Bigwood ." &quot; "And your chance has only proved a chance to lose it?" &quot; "I haven't lost it. I remember now -- it was very stupid of me to have forgotten. I told my maid to give it to Lord Dori-  mont -- or at least to his man." &quot; "And  Lord Dorimont  went away directly after luncheon." &quot; "Of course he gave it back to my maid -- or else his man did," "       ask syd and julia --> said  Lady Augusta .  "I daresay it's all right." &quot;The conscience of these people is like a summer sea. They  haven't time to  look over  a priceless composition; they've only  time to kick it about the house. I suggested that the  man,  fired  with a noble emulation, had perhaps kept the work for his own perusal; By Henry James 45 perusal; and her ladyship wanted to know whether, if the thing  didn't turn up again in time for the session appointed by out  hostess, the author wouldn't have something else to read that would  do just as well. Their questions are too delightful! I declared  to  Lady Augusta  briefly that nothing in the world can ever do as well as the thing that does best; and at this she looked a little  confused and scared. But I added that if the manuscript had gone  astray our little circle would have the less of an effort of attention  to make. The piece in question was very long -- it would keep  them three hours. &quot; "Three hours! Oh, the  Princess will get up!"  said Lady  Augusta. &quot; "I thought she was  Mr. Paraday 's greatest admirer." "'I daresay she is -- she's so awfully clever. But what's the  use of being a  Princess  --" " "If you can't dissemble your love?"  I asked, as  Lady Augusta   was vague. She said, at any rate, that she would question her  maid; and I am hoping that when I go down to dinner I shall  find the manuscript has been recovered." &quot; X "It has not been recovered,"  I wrote early the next day,  "and  I am moreover much troubled about out friend. He came back  from  Bigwood  with a chill and, being allowed to have a tire in his  room, lay down a while before dinner. I tried to send him to  bed and indeed thought I had put him in the way of it; but after  I had gone to dress  Mrs. Wimbush  came up to see him, with the  inevitable result that when I returned I found him under arms and flushed 46 The Death of the Lion flushed and feverish, though decorated with the rare flower she  had brought him for his button-hole. He came down to dinner,  but  Lady Augusta  Minch was very shy of him. To-day he's in  great pain, and the advent of those ladies -- I mean of Guy  Walsingham and  Dora Forbes  -- doesn't at all console me. It  does Mrs. Wimbush , however, for she has consented to his re-  maining in bed, so that he may be all right to-morrow for the séance .  Guy Walsingham  is already on the scene, and the doctor,  for Paraday , also arrived early. I haven't yet seen the author of 'Obsessions,'  but of course I’ve had a moment by myself with  the doctor. I tried to get him to say that out invalid must go  straight home -- I mean to-morrow or next day; but he quite  refuses to talk about the future. Absolute quiet and warmth and  the regular administration of an important remedy are the points  he mainly insists on. He returns this afternoon, and I'm to go  back to see the patient at one o'clock, when he next takes his medicine. It consoles me a little that he certainly won't be able  to read -- an exertion he was already more than unfit for.  Lady  Augusta  went off after breakfast: assuring me that her  care  would be to follow up the lost manuscript. I can see she thinks  me a shocking busybody and doesn't understand my alarm, but  she will do what she can, for she's a good-natured woman.  "So  are they all honourable men."  That was precisely what made her  give the thing to  Lord Dorimont  and made  Lord Dorimont  bag  it. What use  he has for it God only knows. I have the worst  forebodings, but somehow I'm strangely without passion -- des-  perately calm. As I consider the unconscious, the well-meaning  ravages of our appreciative circle I bow my head in submission to  some great natural, some universal accident; I'm rendered almost  indifferent, in fact quite gay (ha-ha!) by the sense of immitigable  rate.  Lady Augusta  promises me to trace the precious object and let By Henry James 47 let me have it, through the post, by the time  Paraday  is well  enough to play his part with it. The last evidence is that her  maid did give it to his lordship's valet. One would think it was  some thrilling number of  The Family Budget .  Mrs. Wimbush ,  who is aware of the accident, is much less agitated by it than she  would doubtless be were she not for the hour inevitably engrossed  with  Guy Walsingham ."  Later in the day I informed my correspondent, for whom   indeed I kept a sort of diary of the situation, that I had made the  acquaintance of this celebrity and that she was a pretty little girl  who wore her hair in what used to be called a crop. She looked  so juvenile and so innocent that if, as  Mr. Morrow  had announced,  she was resigned to the larger latitude, her fortitude must have  come to her early. I spent most of the day hovering about   Neil  Paraday 's room, but it was communicated to me from below that Guy Walsingham , at  Prestidge , was a success. Towards evening  I became conscious somehow that her resignation was contagious  and by the time the company separated for the night I was sure  that the larger latitude had been generally accepted. I thought of Dora Forbes  and felt that he had no time to lose. Before dinner  I received a telegram from  Lady Augusta Minch .  "Lord  Dorimont thinks he must have left bundle in train -- inquire."   How could I inquire -- if I was to take the word as a command?  I was too worried and now too alarmed about  Neil Paraday .  The doctor came back, and it was an immense satisfaction to me  to feel that he was wise and interested. He was proud of being  called to so distinguished a patient, but he admitted to me that night that my friend was gravely iii. It was really a relapse, a recrudescence of his old malady. There could be no question of  moving him: we must at any rate see , on the spot, what  turn his condition would take. Meanwhile, on the morrow, he was 48 The Death of the Lion was to have a nurse. On the morrow the dear man was easier,  and my spirits rose to such cheerfulness that I could almost laugh  over  Lady Augusta 's second telegram:  " Lord Dorimont 's servant  been to station -- nothing found. Push inquiries."  I did laugh, I  am sure, as I remembered this was the mystic scroll I had scarcely  allowed poor Mr. Morrow  to point his umbrella at. Fool that  I had been: the thirty-seven influential journals wouldn't have  destroyed it, they would only have printed it. Of course I said nothing to  Paraday .  When the nurse arrived she turned me out of the room, on  which I went downstairs. I should premise that at breakfast the  news that our brilliant friend was doing well excited universal  complacency, and the  Princess  graciously remarked that he was  only to be commiserated for missing the society of  Miss Collop . Mrs. Wimbush , whose social gift never shone brighter than in the  dry decorum with which she accepted this blemish on her perfec-  tion, mentioned to me that  Guy Walsingham  had made a very  favourable impression on her Imperial Highness . Indeed I think every one did so and that, like the money-market or the national  honour, her  Imperial Highness  was constitutionally sensitive.  There was a certain gladness, a perceptible bustle in the air, how-  ever, which I thought slightly anomalous in a house where a great author lay critically ill.  " Le roy est mort -- vive le roy " : I was  reminded that another great author had already stepped into his  shoes. When I came down again after the nurse had taken  possession I found a strange gentleman hanging about the hall  and pacing to and fro by the closed door of the drawing-room.  This personage was florid and bald, he had a big red moustache  and wore showy knickerbockers -- characteristics all that fitted into  my conception of the identity of  Dora Forbes . In a moment I  saw what had happened: the author of  'The Other Way Round' had By Henry James 49 had just alighted at the portals of  Prestidge , but had suffered a  scruple to restrain him from penetrating further. I recognised his  scruple when, pausing to listen at his gesture of caution, I heard a  shrill voice lifted in a prolonged monotonous quaver. The famous  reading had begun, only it was the author of  'Obsessions'  who  now furnished the sacrifice. The new visitor whispered to me  that he judged something was going on that he oughtn't to  interrupt. " Miss Collop  arrived last night"  I smiled,  "and the  Princess   has a thirst for the  inédit ." Dora Forbes  lifted his bushy brows. " Miss Collop ?" " Guy Walsingham , your distinguished confrère  -- or shall I say  your formidable rival?" "Oh!"  growled  Dora Forbes . Then he added:  "Shall I  spoil it if I go in?" "I should think nothing could spoil it!"  I ambiguously  laughed. Dora Forbes  evidently felt the dilemma; he gave an irritated  crook to his moustache.  " Shall  I go in?"  he presently asked.  We looked at each other hard a moment; then I expressed  something bitter that was in me, expressed it in an infernal "Yes!"  After this I got out into the air, but not so quickly as  not to hear, as the door of the drawing-room opened, the dis-  concerted drop of Miss Collop 's public manner: she must have  been in the midst of the larger latitude. Producing with extreme rapidity,  Guy Walsingham  has just published a work in which  amiable people who are not initiated have been pained to see the  genius of a sister-novelist held up to unmistakable ridicule; so  fresh an exhibition does it seem to them of the dreadful way men  have always treated women.  Dora Forbes , it is true, at the  present hour, is immensely pushed by  Mrs. Wimbush , and has sat The Yellow Book--Vol. I,  D for 50 The Death of the Lion for his portrait to the young artists she protects, sat for it not  only in oils but in monumental alabaster. What happened at  Prestidge  later in the day is of course con-  temporary history. If the interruption I had whimsically sanc-  tioned was almost a scandal, what is to be said of that general dispersal of the company which, under the doctor's rule, began to  take place in the evening? His rule was soothing to behold, small  comfort as I was to have at the end. He decreed in the interest  of his patient an absolutely soundless house and a consequent  break-up of the party. Little country practitioner as he was, he  literally packed off the  Princess . She departed as promptly as if  a revolution had broken out, and  Guy Walsingham  emigrated with  her. I was kindly permitted to remain, and this was not denied  even to  Mrs. Wimbush . The privilege was withheld indeed  from  Dora Forbes ; so  Mrs. Wimbush  kept her latest capture  temporarily concealed. This was so little, however, her usual way  of dealing with her eminent friends that a couple of days of it  exhausted her patience, and she went up to town with him in  great publicity. The sudden turn for the worse her afflicted  guest had, after a brief improvement, taken on the night  raised an obstacle to her seeing him before her retreat; a fortunate  circumstance doubtless, for she was fundamentally disappointed in  him. This was not the kind of performance for which she had  invited him to  Prestidge , or invited the Princess . Let me hasten  to add that none of the generous acts which have characterised her  patronage of intellectual and other merit have done so much for  her reputation as her lending  Neil Paraday  the most beautiful of  her numerous homes to die in. He took advantage to the utmost  of the singular favour. Day by day I saw him sink, and I roamed  alone about the empty terraces and gardens. His wife never came  near him, but I scarcely noticed it: as I paced there with rage in my By Henry James 51 my heart I was too full of another wrong. In the event of his  death it would fall to me perhaps to bring out in some charming  form, with notes, with the tenderest editorial care, that precious  heritage of his written project. But where  was that precious  heritage, and were both the author and the book to have been  snatched from us?  Lady Augusta  wrote me that she had done  all she could and that poor  Lord Dorimont , who had really been  worried to death, was extremely sorry. I couldn't have the matter  out with  Mrs. Wimbush , for I didn't want to be taunted by her  with desiring to aggrandise myself by a public connection with Mr. Paraday 's sweepings. She had signified her willingness to  meet the expense of all advertising, as indeed she was always ready  to do. The last night of the horrible series, the night before  he died, I put my ear closer to his pillow. "That thing I read you that morning, you know." "In your garden -- that dreadful day? Yes!" "Won't it do as it is?" "It would have been a glorious book." "It  is  a glorious book," Neil Paraday  murmured.  "Print it as  it stands -- beautifully." "Beautifully!"  I passionately promised.  It may be imagined whether, now that he has gone, the promise  seems to me less sacred. I am convinced that if such pages had  appeared in his lifetime the Abbey would hold him to-day. I  have kept the advertising in my own hands, but the manuscript  has not been recovered. It's impossible, and at any rate intoler-  able, to suppose it can have been wantonly destroyed. Perhaps some chance blundering hand, some brutal ignorance has lighted kitchen-fires with it. Every stupid and hideous accident haunts  my meditations. My undiscouragable search for the lost treasure  would make a long chapter. Fortunately I have a devoted associate 52 The Death of the Lion associate in the person of a young lady who has every day a fresh indignation and a fresh idea and who maintains with intensity  that the prize will still turn up. Sometimes I believe her, but I  have quite ceased to believe myself. The only thing for us, at  all events, is to go on seeking and hoping together; and we should  be closely united by this firm tie even were we not at present by  another. L'Education Sentimentale By   Aubrey Beardsley Reproduced by the Swan Electric Engraving Company Tree-Worship By   Richard Le Gallienne V  AST  and mysterious brother, 'ere was yet of me So much as men may poise upon a needle's end, Still shook with laughter all this monstrous might of thee, And still with haughty crest it called the morning friend. Thy latticed column jetted up the bright blue air, Tall as a mast it was, and stronger than a tower ; Three hundred winters had beheld thee mighty there, Before my little life had lived one little hour. With rocky foot stern-set like iron in the land, With leafy rustling crest the morning sows with pearls, Huge as a minster, half in heaven men saw thee stand, Thy rugged girth the waists of fifty Eastern girls. Knotted and warted, slabbed and armoured like the hide Of tropic elephant ; unstormable and steep As some grim fortress with a princess-pearl inside, Where savage guardian faces beard the bastioned keep : So 58 Tree-Worship So hard a rind, old tree, shielding so soft a heart, A woman's heart of tender little nestling leaves ; Nor rind so hard but that a touch so soft can part, And spring s  baby-bud an easy passage cleaves. I picture thee within with dainty satin sides, Where all the long day through the sleeping dryad dreams, But when the moon bends low and taps thee thrice she glides, Knowing the fairy knock, to bask within her beams. And all the long night through, for him with eyes and ears, She sways within thine arms and sings a fairy tune, Till, startled with the dawn, she softly disappears, And sleeps and dreams again until the rising moon. But with the peep of day great bands of heavenly birds Fill all thy branchy chambers with a thousand flutes, And with the torrid noon stroll up the weary herds, To seek thy friendly shade and doze about thy roots ; Till with the setting sun they turn them once more home : And, ere the moon dawns, for a brief enchanted space, Weary with million miles, the sore-spent star-beams come, And moths and bats hold witches sabbath in the place. And then I picture thee some bloodstained Holyrood, Dread haunted palace of the bat and owl, whence steal, Shrouded all day, lost murdered spirits of the wood, And fright young happy nests with homeless hoot and squeal. Some By Richard Le Gallienne 59 Some Rizzio nightingale that plained adulterous love Beneath the boudoir-bough of some fast-married bird, Some dove that cooed to some one else s lawful dove, And felt the dagger-beak pierce while his lady heard. Then, maybe, dangling from thy gloomy gallows boughs, A human corpse swings, mournful, rattling bones and  chains-- His eighteenth century flesh hath fattened nineteenth century cows-- Ghastly AEolian harp fingered of winds and rains. Poor  Rizpah  comes to reap each newly-fallen bone That once thrilled soft, a little limb, within her womb ; And mark yon alchemist, with zodiac-spangled zone, Wrenching the mandrake root that fattens in the gloom. So rounds thy day, from maiden morn to haunted night, From larks and sunlit dreams to owl and gibbering ghost ; A catacomb of dark, a sponge of living light, To the wide sea of air a green and welcome coast. I seek a god, old tree : accept my worship, thou ! All other gods have failed me always in my need. I hang my votive song beneath thy temple bough, Unto thy strength I cry--Old monster, be my creed ! Give me to clasp this earth with feeding roots like thine, To mount yon heaven with such star-aspiring head, Fill full with sap and buds this shrunken life of mine, And from my boughs O might such stalwart sons be shed ! With 60 Tree-Worship With loving cheek pressed close against thy horny breast, I hear the roar of sap mounting within thy veins ; Tingling with buds, thy great hands open towards the west, To catch the sweetheart wind that brings the sister rains. O winds that blow from out the fruitful mouth of God, O rains that softly fall from his all-loving eyes, You that bring buds to trees and daisies to the sod, O God s best Angel of the Spring, in me arise.

Artifice must queen it once  more in the town, and so, if there be any whose hearts chafe  at her return, let them not say,  "We have come into evil times,"   and be all for resistance, reformation or angry cavilling. For did  the king's sceptre send the sea retrograde, or the wand of the  sorcerer avail to turn the sun from its old course ? And what man or what number of men ever stayed that reiterated process by   which the cities of this world grow, are very strong, fail and grow  again ? Indeed, indeed, there is charm in every period, and only   fools and flutterpates do not seek reverently for what is charming   in their own day. No martyrdom, however fine, nor satire, how   ever splendidly bitter, has changed by a little tittle the known   tendency of things. It is the times that can perfect us, not we   the times, and so let all of us wisely acquiesce. Like the little  wired marionettes, let us acquiesce in the dance. For behold ! The Victorian era comes to its end and the day  of sancta simplicitas is quite ended. The old signs are here and  the portents to warn the seer of life that we are ripe for a new  epoch of artifice. Are not men rattling the dice-box and ladies   dipping their fingers in the rouge-pots ? At  Rome , in the keenest  time of her degringolade, when there was gambling even in the holy temples, 66 A Defence of Cosmetics temples, great ladies (does not  Lucian tell us ?) did not scruple to   squander all they had upon unguents from Arabia .  Nero 's mistress   and unhappy wife,  Poppaea , of shameful memory, had in her travel   ling retinue fifteen -or, as some say, fifty- she-asses, for the sake   of their milk, that was thought an incomparable guard against cosmetics with poison in them. Last century, too, when life was  lived by candle-light, and ethics was but etiquette, and even art a  question of punctilio, women, we know, gave the best hours of the  day to the crafty farding of their faces and the towering of their  coiffures. And men, throwing passion into the wine-bowl to sink  or swim, turned out thought to browse upon the green cloth.  Cannot we even now in our fancy see them, those silent exquisites  round the long table at  Brooks  , masked, all of them,  "lest the  countenance should betray feeling,"  in quinze masks, through  whose eyelets they sat peeping, peeping, while macao brought them  riches or ruin ? We can see them, those silent rascals, sitting there  with their cards and their rouleaux and their wooden money-  bowls, long after the dawn had crept up St. James  and pressed its  haggard face against the window of the little club. Yes, we can  raise their ghosts--and, more, we can see manywhere a devotion  to hazard fully as meek as theirs. In  England  there has been a  wonderful revival of cards. Roulette may rival dead faro in the  tale of her devotees. Her wheel is spinning busily in every house  and ere long it may be that tender parents will be writing to  complain of the compulsory baccarat in our public school. In fact, we are all gamblers once more, but our gambling is on  a finer scale than ever it was. We fly from the card-room to the  heath, and from the heath to the City, and from the City to the  coast of the  Mediterranean . And just as no one seriously en-  courages the clergy in its frantic efforts to lay the spirit of chance,  that has thus resurged among us, so no longer are many faces set against By Max Beerbohm 67 against that other great sign of a more complicated life, the love  for cosmetics. No longer is a lady of fashion blamed if, to escape  the outrageous persecution of time, she fly for sanctuary to the  toilet-table ; and if a damosel, prying in her mirror, be sure that  with brush and pigment she can trick herself into more charm, we  are not angry. Indeed, why should we ever have been ? Surely  it is laudable, this wish to make fair the ugly and overtop fairness,  and no wonder that within the last five years the trade of the  makers of cosmetics has increased immoderately--twentyfold, so  one of these makers has said to me. We need but walk down  any modish street and peer into the little broughams that flit  past, or (in  Thackeray 's phrase) under the bonnet of any woman  we meet, to see over how wide a kingdom rouge reigns. We  men, who, from  Juvenal  down to that discourteous painter of  whom  Lord Chesterfield  tells us, have especially shown a dislike of  cosmetics, are quite yielding ; and there are, I fancy, many such  husbands as he who, suddenly realising that his wife was painted,  bad her sternly,  "Go up and take it all off,"  and, on her reappear  ance, bad her with increasing sternness,  "Go up and put it all  on again." But now that the use of pigments is becoming general, and  most women are not so young as they are painted, it may be asked  curiously how the prejudice ever came into being. Indeed, it is  hard to trace folly, for that it is inconsequent, to its start ; and  perhaps it savours too much of reason to suggest that the prejudice  was due to the tristful confusion man has made of soul and surface.  Through trusting so keenly to the detection of the one by keeping  watch upon the other, and by force of the thousand errors following,  he has come to think of surface even as the reverse of soul. He  supposes that every clown beneath his paint and lip-salve is moribund  and knows it, (though in verity, I am told, clowns are as cheerful a 68 A Defence of Cosmetics a class of men as any other), that the fairer the fruit's rind and the  more delectable its bloom, the closer are packed the ashes within it.  The very jargon of the hunting-field connects cunning with a  mask. And so perhaps came man's anger at the embellishment of  women--that lovely mask of enamel with its shadows of pink  and tiny pencilled veins, what must lurk behind it ? Of what  treacherous mysteries may it not be the screen ? Does not the  heathen lacquer her dark face, and the harlot paint her cheeks,  because sorrow has made them pale ? After all, the old prejudice is a-dying. We need not pry into  the secret of its birth. Rather is this a time of jolliness and glad  indulgence. For the era of rouge is upon us, and as only in an  elaborate era can man by the tangled accrescency of his own  pleasures and emotions reach that refinement which is his highest  excellence, and by making himself, so to say, independent of  Nature, come nearest to God, so only in an elaborate era is woman  perfect. Artifice is the strength of the world, and in that same mask of paint and powder, shadowed with vermeil tinct and most  trimly pencilled, is woman's strength. For see ! We need not look so far back to see woman under  the direct influence of Nature. Early in this century, our grand  mothers, sickening of the odour of faded exotics and spilt wine,  came out into the daylight once more and let the breezes blow  around their faces and enter, sharp and welcome, into their lungs.  Artifice they drove forth, and they set Martin Tupper  upon a  throne of mahogany to rule over them. A very reign of terror set  in. All things were sacrificed to the fetish Nature. Old ladies  may still be heard to tell how, when they were girls, affectation  was not ; and, if we verify their assertion in the light of such  literary authorities as  Dickens , we find that it is absolutely true.  Women appear to have been in those days utterly natural in their conduct By Max Beerbohm 69 conduct--flighty, gushing, blushing, fainting, giggling and shaking their curls. They knew no reserve in the  days of the  Victorian era. No thought was held too trivial, no emotion too  silly, to express. To Nature everything was sacrificed. Great  heavens! And in those barren days what influence was exerted  by women? By men they seem not to have been feared nor loved,  but regarded rather as  "dear little creatures"  or " wonderful little  beings,"  and in their relation to life as foolish and ineffectual as the  landscapes they did in water-colour. Yet, if the women of those  years were of no great account, they had a certain charm and they  at least had not begun to trespass upon men's ground ; if they  touched not thought, which is theirs by right, at any rate they refrained from action, which is ours. Far more serious was it  when, in the natural trend of time, they became enamoured of  rinking and archery and galloping along the  Brighton Parade . Swiftly they have sped on since then from horror to horror. The  invasion of the tennis-courts and of the golf-links, the seizure of  the tricycle and of the type-writer, were but steps preliminary in  that campaign which is to end with the final victorious occupation  of  St. Stephen's . But stay ! The horrific pioneers of womanhood who gad hither and thither and, confounding wisdom with the  device on her shield, shriek for the unbecoming, are doomed.  Though they spin their tricycle-treadles so amazingly fast, they  are too late. Though they scream victory, none follow them.  Artifice, that fair exile, has returned. Yes, though the pioneers know it not, they are doomed already.  For of the curiosities of history not the least strange is the manner  in which two social movements may be seen to overlap, long after  the second has, in truth, given its deathblow to the . And,  in like manner as one has seen the limbs of a murdered thing in  lively movement, so we need not doubt that, though the voices of The Yellow Book, Vol. I  E those 70 A Defence of Cosmetics those who cry out for reform be very terribly shrill, they will soon  be hushed. Dear Artifice is with us. It needed but that we   should wait. Surely, without any of my pleading, women will welcome their  great and amiable protectrix, as by instinct. For (have I not  said ?) it is upon her that all their strength, their life almost,  depends. Artifice's command to them is that they should  repose. With bodily activity their powder will fly, their enamel  crack. They are butterflies who must not flit, if they love their  bloom. Now, setting aside the point of view of passion, from  which very many obvious things might be said, (and probably have  been by the minor poets), it is, from the intellectual point of view, quite necessary that a woman should repose. Hers is the  resupinate sex. On her couch she is a goddess, but so soon as  ever she put her foot to the ground--lo, she is the veriest little  sillypop and quite done for. She cannot rival us in accion, but she  is our mistress in the things of the mind. Let her not by second-  rate athletics, nor indeed by any exercise soever of the limbs,  spoil the pretty procedure of her reason. Let her be content to  remain the guide, the subtle suggester of what  we  must do, the  strategist whose soldiers we are, the little architect whose work  men. " After all,"  as a pretty girl once said to me,  "women are a sex by themselves, so to speak,"  and the sharper the line between their worldly functions and ours, the better. This greater  swiftness and less erring subtlety of mind, their forte and privilege,  justifies the painted mask that Artifice bids them wear. Behind  it their minds can play without let. They gain the strength of  reserve. They become important, as in the days of the Roman  Empire were the Emperor's mistresses, as was the Pompadour  at Versailles , as was our  Elizabeth . Yet do not their faces become lined By Max Beerbohm 71 lined with thought ; beautiful and without meaning are their  faces. And, truly, of all the good things that will happen with the  full renascence of cosmetics, one of the best is that surface will  finally be severed from soul. That damnable confusion will be  solved by the extinguishing of a prejudice which, as I suggest,  itself created. Too long has the face been degraded from its rank  as a thing of beauty to a mere vulgar index of character or  emotion. We had come to troubling ourselves, not with its charm of colour and line, but with such questions as whether the  lips were sensuous, the eyes full of sadness, the nose indicative of  determination. I have no quarrel with physiognomy. For my  own part, I believe in it. But it has tended to degrade the face  Aesthetically, in such wise as the study of cheirosophy has tended  to degrade the hand. And the use of cosmetics, the masking of  the face, will change this. We shall gaze at a woman merely because she is beautiful, not stare into her face anxiously, as into  the face of a barometer. How fatal it has been, in how many ways, this confusion of  soul and surface ! Wise were the Greeks in making plain masks  for their mummers to play in, and dunces we not to have done the  same ! Only the other day, an actress was saying that what she  was most proud of in her art--next, of course, to having appeared  in some provincial pantomime at the age of three--was the deft  ness with which she contrived, in parts demanding a rapid succes-  sion of emotions, to dab her cheeks quite quickly with rouge from  the palm of her right hand, or powder from the palm of her left.  Gracious goodness! why do not we have masks upon the stage ? Drama is the presentment of the soul in action. The mirror of  the soul is the voice. Let the young critics, who seek a cheap  reputation for austerity, by cavilling at  " incidental music,"  set their 72 A Defence of Cosmetics their faces rather against the attempt to justify inferior dramatic  art by the subvention of a quite alien art like painting, of any art,  indeed, whose sphere is only surface. Let those, again, who sneer,  so rightly, at the  " painted anecdotes of the Academy,"  censure  equally the writers who trespass on painter's ground. It is a  proclaimed sin that a painter should concern himself with a good  little girl's affection for a Scotch greyhound, or the keen enjoyment  of their port by elderly gentlemen of the early forties. Yet, for a  painter to prod the soul with his paint-brush is no worse than for  a novelist to refuse to dip under the surface, and the fashion of  avoiding a psychological study of grief by stating that the owner's  hair turned white in a single night, or of shame by mentioning a  sudden rush of scarlet to the cheeks, is as lamentable as may  be. But ! But with the universal use of cosmetics and the  consequent secernment of soul and surface, which, at the risk of  irritating a reader, I must again insist upon, all those old properties  that went to bolster up the ordinary novel the trembling lips, the  flashing eyes, the determined curve of the chin, the nervous trick of  biting the moustache--aye and the hectic spot of red on either  cheek--will be made spiflicate, as the puppets were spiflicated by Don Quixote . Yes, even now  Demos  begins to discern. The same  spirit that has revived rouge, smote his mouth as it grinned at  the wondrous painter of mist and river, and now sends him  sprawling for the pearls that Meredith  dived for in the deep waters of romance. Indeed the revival of cosmetics must needs be so splendid an  influence, conjuring boons innumerable, that one inclines almost  to mutter against that inexorable law by which Artifice must  perish from time to time. That such branches of painting as the  staining of glass or the illuminating of manuscripts should fall into  disuse seems, in comparison, so likely ; these were esoteric arts ; they By Max Beerbohm 73 they died with the monastic spirit. But personal appearance is  art's very basis. The painting of the face is the  kind of  painting man can have known. To make beautiful things  is it not an impulse laid upon few ? But to make oneself beautiful  is an universal instinct. Strange that the resultant art could ever  perish ! So fascinating an art too ! So various in its materials  from stimmis, psimythium and fuligo to bismuth and arsenic, so  simple in that its ground and its subject-matter are one, so marvellous in that its very subject-matter becomes lovely when an  artist has selected it ! For surely this is no idle nor fantastic  saying. To deny that  "making-up"  is an art, on the pretext  that the finished work of its exponents depends for beauty and  excellence upon the ground chosen for the work, is absurd. At  the touch of a true artist, the plainest face turns comely. As  subject-matter the face is no more than suggestive, as ground,  merely a loom round which the beatus artifex may spin the threads of any golden fabric :  Quae nunc nomen habent operosi signa Maronis  Pondus iners quondam duraque massa fuit. Multa viros nescire decet ; pars maxima rerum  Offendat, si non interiora tegas,   and, as  Ovid  would seem to suggest, by pigments any tone may be  set aglow on a woman's cheek, from enamel the features take any  form. Insomuch that surely the advocates of soup-kitchens and  free-libraries and other devices for giving people what providence  did not mean them to receive, should send out pamphlets in the  praise of self-embellishment. For it will place Beauty within  easy reach of many who could not otherwise hope to attain it But of course Artifice is rather exacting. In return for the  repose she forces so--wisely !--upon her followers when the sun is high 74 A Defence of Cosmetics high or the moon is blown across heaven, she demands that  they should pay her long homage at the sun's rising. The initiate  may not enter lightly upon her mysteries. For, if a bad com-  plexion be inexcusable, to be ill-painted is unforgivable; and when  the toilet is laden once more with the fulness of its elaboration, we  shall hear no more of the proper occupation for women. And  think, how sweet an energy, to sit at the mirror of coquetry !  See the dear merits of the toilet as shown upon old vases, or upon  the walls of Roman dwellings, or, rather still, read  Bottiger's   alluring, scholarly description of  " Morgenscenen im Puttzimmer  Einer Reichen R&#x61686;merin. "  Read of  Sabina 's face as she comes   through the curtain of her bed-chamber to the chamber of her   toilet. The slave-girls have long been charing their white feet  upon the marble floor. They stand, those timid Greek girls,  marshalled in little battalions. Each has her appointed task, and  all kneel in welcome as  Sabina  stalks, ugly and frowning, to the  toilet chair. Scaphion  steps forth from among them, and, dipping a  tiny sponge in a bowl of hot milk, passes it lightly, ever so lightly,  over her mistress face. The Poppaean pastes melt beneath it like  snow. A cooling lotion is poured over her brow and is fanned with feathers.  Phiale  comes after, a clever girl, captured in some  sea-skirmish in the  Aegean . In her left hand she holds the ivory  box wherein are the phucus and that white powder, psimythium;  in her right a sheaf of slim brushes. With how sure a touch does  she mingle the colours, and in what sweet proportion blushes  and blanches her lady's upturned face. Phiale  is the cleverest of all the slaves. Now  Calamis  dips her quill in a certain powder that  floats, liquid and sable, in the hollow of her palm. Standing upon  tip-toe and with lips parted, she traces the arch of the eyebrows.  The slaves whisper loudly of their lady's beauty, and two of them  hold up a mirror to her. Yes, the eyebrows are rightly arched. But By Max Beerbohm 75 But why does  Psecas  abase herself? She is craving leave to powder Sabina 's hair with a fine new powder. It is made of the grated rind  of the cedar-tree, and a Gallic perfumer, whose stall is near the Circus , gave it to her for a kiss. No lady in  Rome  knows of it.  And so, when four special slaves have piled up the head-dress, out  of a perforated box this glistening powder is showered. Into every  little brown ringlet it enters, till  Sabina 's hair seems like a pile of  gold coins. Lest the breezes send it flying, the girls lay the powder with sprinkled attar. Soon  Sabina  will start for the Temple of Cybele . Ah ! Such are the lures of the toilet that none will for long  hold aloof from them. Cosmetics are not going to be a mere  prosaic remedy for age or plainness, but all ladies and all young girls  will come to love them. Does not a certain blithe  Marquise , whose  lettres intimes  from the Court of  Louis Seize  are less read than their wit would merit, tell us how she was scandalised to see " même les toutes jeunes demoiselles émaillées comme ma tabatière? "   So it shall be with us. Surely the common prejudice against  painting the lily can but be based on mere ground of economy.  That which is already fair is complete, it may be urged--urged  implausibly, for there are not so many lovely things in this world  that we can afford not to know each one of them by heart.  There is only one white lily, and who that has ever seen--as I have  a lily--really well painted could grudge the artist so fair a ground  for his skill ? Scarcely do you believe through how many nice metamorphoses a lily may be passed by him. In like manner, we  all know the young girl, with her simpleness, her goodness, her  wayward ignorance. And a very charming ideal for  England   must she have been, and a very natural one, when a young girl  sat even on the throne. But no nation can keep its ideal for ever  and it needed none of Mr. Gilbert 's delicate satire in " Utopia "  to remind 76 A Defence of Cosmetics remind us that she had passed out of our ken with the rest of  the early Victorian era. What writer of plays, as lately  asked some pressman, who had been told off to attend many   nights and knew what he was talking about, ever dreams of  making the young girl the centre of his theme ? Rather he seeks  inspiration from the tried and tired woman of the world, in all her  intricate maturity, whilst, by way of comic relief, he sends the  young girl flitting in and out with a tennis-racket, the poor Ɛίδωλοv ảμɑvрόv  of her former self. The season of the unsophis-  ticated is gone by, and the young girl's final extinction beneath the  rising tides of cosmetics will leave no gap in life and will rob art of  nothing. "Tush,"  I can hear some damned flutterpate exclaim,  "girlish-  ness and innocence are as strong and as permanent as womanhood  itself ! Why, a few months past, the whole town went mad over Miss Cissie Loftus ! Was not hers a success of girlish innocence  and the absence of rouge? If such things as these be outmoded,  why was she so wildly popular?"  Indeed, the triumph of that  clever girl, whose dbut made  London  nice even in August, is but  another witness to the truth of my contention. In a very  sophisticated time, simplicity has a new dulcedo. Hers was a  success of contrast. Accustomed to clever malaperts like  Miss  Lloyd  or  Miss Reeve , whose experienced pouts and smiles under  the sun-bonnet are a standing burlesque of innocence and girlish-  ness,  Demos  was really delighted, for once and away, to see the  real presentment of these things upon his stage. Coming after all  those sly series, coming so young and mere with her pink frock  and straightly combed hair,  Miss Cissie Loftus  had the charm  which things of another period often do possess. Besides, just as  we adored her for the abrupt nod with which she was wont at   to acknowledge the applause, so we were glad for her to come upon By Max Beerbohm 77 upon the stage with nothing to tinge the ivory of her cheeks. It  seemed so strange, that neglect of convention. To be behind  footlights and not rouged ! Yes, hers was a success of  contrast. She was like a daisy in the window at  Solomons' . She  was delightful. And yet, such is the force of convention, that  when last I saw her, playing in some burlesque at the  Gaiety , her fringe was curled and her pretty face rouged with the best of  them. And, if further need be to show the absurdity of having  called her performance "a triumph of naturalness over the jaded  spirit of modernity" let us reflect that the little mimic was not a  real old-fashioned girl after all. She had none of that restless  naturalness that would seem to have characterised the girl of the  early Victorian days. She had no pretty ways--no smiles--nor  blushes nor tremors. Possibly  Demos  could not have stood a pre-  sentment of girlishness unrestrained. But with her grave insouciance,  Miss Cissie Loftus  had much  of the reserve that is one of the factors of feminine perfection, and  to most comes only, as I have said, with artifice. Her features  played very, very slightly. And in truth, this may have been one  of the reasons of her great success. For expression is but too often the ruin of a face ; and, since we cannot as yet so order the circumstances of life that women shall never be betrayed into  "an unbecoming emotion,"  when the brunette shall never have cause  to blush, and the lady who looks well with parted lips be kept in a  permanent state of surprise, the safest way by far is to create, by  brush and pigments, artificial expressions for every face. And this--say you?--will make monotony? You are mis-  taken, toto ccelo mistaken. When your mistress has wearied you  with one expression, then it will need but a few touches of that  pencil, a backward sweep of that brush, and lo, you will be  revelling in another. For though, of course, the painting of the face 78 A Defence of Cosmetics face is, in manner, most like the painting of canvas, in outcome it  is rather akin to the art of music lasting, like music's echo, not  for very long. So that, no doubt, of the many little appurte-  nances of the Reformed Toilet Table, not the least vital will be  a list of the emotions that become its owner, with recipes for  simulating them. According to the colour she wills her hair to  be for the time--black or yellow or, peradventure, burnished red  --she will blush for you, sneer for you, laugh or languish for you.  The good combinations of line and colour are nearly numberless,  and by their means poor restless woman will be able to realise her  moods in all their shades and lights and dappledoms, to live many  lives and masquerade through many moments of joy. No mono-  tony will be. And for us men matrimony will have lost its  sting. But be it remembered ! Though we men will garner these  oblique boons, it is into the hands of women that Artifice gives her  pigments. I know, I know that many men in a certain sect of  society have shown a marked tendency to the use of cosmetics. I  speak not of the countless gentlemen who walk about town in the  time of its desertion from August to October, artificially bronzed,  as though they were fresh from the moors or from the  Solent .  This, I conceive, is done for purely social reasons and need not  concern me here. Rather do I speak of those who make them  selves up, seemingly with an aesthetic purpose. Doubtless--I  wish to be quite just--there are many who look the better  for such embellishment ; but, at the hazard of being thought old-  fashioned and prejudiced, I cannot speak of the custom with any thing but strong disapproval. If men are to lie among the  rouge-pots, inevitably it will tend to promote that amalgamation of  the sexes which is one of the chief planks in the decadent platform  and to obtund that piquant contrast between him and her, which is By Max Beerbohm 79 is one of the redeeming features of creation. Besides, really, men  have not the excuse of facial monotony, that holds in the case of  women. Have we not hair upon our chins and upper lips ? And  can we not, by diverting the trend of our moustache or by growing  our beard in this way or that, avoid the boredom of looking the same  for long ? Let us beware. For if, in violation of unwritten  sexual law, men take to trifling with the paints and brushes that  are feminine heritage, it may be that our great ladies will don false  imperials, and the little doner deck her pretty chin with a Newgate  fringe ! After all, I think we need not fear that many men will  thus trespass. Most of them are in the City nowadays, and the great wear and tear of that place would put their use of rouge--  that demands bodily repose from its dependents--quite outside the  range of practical aesthetics. But that in the world of women they will not neglect this art,  so ripping in itself, in its result so wonderfully beneficent, I am  sure indeed. Much, I have said, is already done for its full  renascence. The spirit of the age has made straight the path of  its professors. Fashion has made  Jezebel  surrender her monopoly  of the rouge-pot. As yet, the great art of self-embellishment is  for us but in its infancy. But if Englishwomen can bring it to  the flower of an excellence so supreme as never yet has it known,  then, though Old  England  may lose her martial and commercial supremacy, we patriots will have the satisfaction of knowing that  she has been advanced at one bound to a place in the councils of  aesthetic Europe . And, in sooth, is this hoping too high of my  countrywomen ? True that, as the art seems always to have  appealed to the ladies of  Athens , and it was not until the waning  time of the Republic that Roman ladies learned to love the practice  of it, so  Paris , Athenian in this as in all other things, has been noted  hitherto as a far more vivid centre of the art than  London . But it was in 80 A Defence of Cosmetics in  Rome , under the Emperors, that unguentaria reached its zenith,  and shall it not be in  London , soon, that unguentaria shall outstrip  its Roman perfection ? Surely there must be among us artists as  cunning in the use of brush and puff as any who lived at  Versailles. Surely the splendid, impalpable advance of good taste, as shown in  dress and in the decoration of houses, may justify my hope of the  preeminence of Englishwomen in the cosmetic art. By their  innate delicacy of touch they will accomplish much, and much, of  course, by their swift feminine perception. Yet it were well that  they should know something also of the theoretical side of the craft.  Modern authorities upon the mysteries of the toilet are, it is true,  rather few ; but among the ancients many a writer would seem to  have been fascinated by them.  Archigenes , a man of science at  the Court of  Cleopatra , and Criton at the Court of the Emperor Trajan , both wrote treatises upon cosmetics doubtless most  scholarly treatises that would have given many a precious hint.  It is a pity they are not extant. From  Lucian  or from  Juvenal ,  with his bitter picture of a Roman  levée  , much may be learnt ;  from the staid pages of  Xenophon  and Aristophanes ' dear farces.  But best of all is that fine book of the  Ars Amatoria  that  Ovid   has set aside for the consideration of dyes, perfumes and pomades.  Written by an artist who knew the allurements of the toilet and  understood its philosophy, it remains without rival as a treatise  upon Artifice. It is more than a poem, it is a manual ; and if  there be left in  England  any lady who cannot read Latin in the  original, she will do well to procure a discreet translation. In the  Bodleian Library  there is treasured the only known copy of a  very poignant and delightful rendering of this one book of  Ovid 's  masterpiece. It was made by a certain  Wye Waltonstall , who  lived in the days of  Elizabeth , and, seeing that he dedicated it to "the  Vertuous Ladyes and Gentlewomen of  Great Britain  ,"  I am sure By Max Beerbohm 81 sure that the gallant writer, could he know of our great renascence  of cosmetics, would wish his little work to be placed once more  within their reach.  " Inasmuch as to you, ladyes and gentle women, "  so he writes in his queer little dedication, " my booke of  pigments doth addresse itself, that it may kisse your hands and  afterward have the lines thereof in reading sweetened by the odour  of your breath, while the dead letters formed into words by your  divided lips may receive new life by your passionate expression,  and the words marryed in that Ruby coloured temple may thus  happily united, multiply your contentment. "  It is rather sad to  think that, at this crisis in the history of pigments, the  Vertuous  Ladyes and Gentlewomen  cannot read the libellus of Wye Walton-  stall , who did so dearly love pigments. But since the days when these great critics wrote their treatises,  with what gifts innumerable has Artifice been loaded by Science !  Many little partitions must be added to the narthecium before it  can comprehend all the new cosmetics that have been quietly  devised since classical days, and will make the modern toilet chalks  away more splendid in its possibilities. A pity that no one has  devoted himself to the compiling of a new list ; but doubtless all the  newest devices are known to the admirable unguentarians of  Bond  Street , who will impart them to their clients. Our thanks, too,  should be given to Science for ridding us of the old danger that  was latent in the use of cosmetics. Nowadays they cannot, being  purged of any poisonous element, do harm to the skin that they  make beautiful. There need be no more sowing the seeds of destruction in the furrows of time, no martyrs to the cause like Georgina Gunning , that fair dame but infelix, who died, so they  relate, from the effect of a poisonous rouge upon her lips. No,  we need have no fears now. Artifice will claim not another  victim from among her worshippers. Loveliness 82 A Defence of Cosmetics Loveliness shall sit at the toilet, watching her oval face in the  oval mirror. Her smooth fingers shall flit among the paints and  powder, to tip and mingle them, catch up a pencil, clasp a phial,  and what  not  and what not, until the mask of vermeil tinct has been  laid aptly, the enamel quite hardened. And, heavens, how she will charm us and ensorcel our eyes ! Positively rouge will rob us for  a time of all our reason ; we shall go mad over masks. Was it  not at  Capua  that they had a whole street where nothing was sold  but dyes and unguents ? We must have such a street, and, to fill our new Seplasia, our Arcade of the Unguents, all herbs and minerals  and live creatures shall give of their substance. The white cliffs  of Albion  shall be ground to powder for loveliness, and perfumed  by the ghost of many a little violet. The fluffy eider-ducks, that  are swimming round the pond, shall lose their feathers, that the  powder-puff may be moonlike as it passes over loveliness's lovely  face. Even the camels shall become ministers of delight, giving their hair in many tufts to be stained by the paints in her  colour-box, and across her cheek the swift hare's foot shall fly as of  old. The sea shall offer her the phucus, its scarlet weed. We  shall spill the blood of mulberries at her bidding. And, as in  another period of great ecstasy, a dancing wanton, la belle  Aubrey ,  was crowned upon a  Lucy Rimmerton 's lighted altar, so Arsenic, that  "green-  tress'd goddess,"  ashamed at length of skulking between the soup  of the unpopular and the test-tubes of the Queen 's analyst, shall be exalted to a place of highest honour upon loveliness's toilet-table.  ! All these things shall come to pass. Times of jolliness and  glad indulgence ! For Artifice, whom we drove forth, has returned  among us, and, though her eyes are red with crying, she is  smiling forgiveness. She is kind. Let us dance and be glad, and  trip the cockawhoop ! Artifice, sweetest exile, is come into her  kingdom. Let us dance her a welcome ! Δαιμονζσμενος By   Arthur Christopher Benson Y  OU  were clear as a sandy spring After a drought, when its waters run Evenly, sparingly, filtering Into the eye of the sun.

Dismal visitants, suddenly, Pulled the doors in your house of clay ; Out of the windows there stared at me Something horrible, grey. The Old Oxford Music Hall By   Walter Sickert Reproduced by the Swan Electric Engraving Company Irremediable By   Ella D'Arcy A   YOUNG  man strolled along a country road one August evening  after a long delicious day--a day of that blessed idleness  the man of leisure never knows : one must be a bank clerk forty-  nine weeks out of the fifty-two before one can really appreciate  the exquisite enjoyment of doing nothing for twelve hours at a  stretch.  Willoughby  had spent the morning lounging about a  sunny rickyard ; then, when the heat grew unbearable, he had  retreated to an orchard, where, lying on his back in the long cool  grass, he had traced the pattern of the apple-leaves diapered above  him upon the summer sky ; now that the heat of the day was over he had come to roam whither sweet fancy led him, to lean over  gates, view the prospect and meditate upon the pleasures of a well-  spent day. Five such days had already passed over his head,  fifteen more remained to him. Then farewell to freedom and  clean country air ! Back again to  London  and another year's  toil. He came to a gate on the right of the road. Behind it a foot  path meandered up over a glassy slope. The sheep nibbling on  its summit cast long shadows down the hill almost to his feet.  Road and field-path were equally new to him, but the latter offered  greener attractions ; he vaulted lightly over the gate and had so The Yellow Book--Vol. I.  F little 88 Irremediable little idea he was taking thus the  step towards ruin that he  began to whistle  " White Wings "  from pure joy of life. The sheep stopped feeding and raised their heads to stare at him  from pale-lashed eyes ;  one and then another broke into a  startled run, until there was a sudden woolly stampede of the entire  flock. When Willoughby  gained the ridge from which they had  just scattered he came in sight of a woman sitting on a stile at  the further end of the field. As he advanced towards her he saw that she was young and that she was not what is called  "a lady" --  of which he was glad : an e arlier episode in his career having  indissolubly associated in his mind ideas of feminine refinement  with those of feminine treachery. He thought it probable this girl would be willing to dispense  with the formalities of an introduction and that he might venture  with her on some pleasant foolish chat. As she made no movement to let him pass he stood still, and,  looking at her, began to smile. She returned his gaze from unabashed dark eyes and then  laughed, showing teeth white, sound, and smooth as split hazel-nuts. " Do you wanter get over ?"  she remarked familiarly. " I'm afraid I can't without disturbing you." "Dontcher think you're much better where you are ? "  said the  girl, on which  Willoughby  hazarded : "You mean to say looking at you ? Well, perhaps I am ! " The girl at this laughed again, but nevertheless dropped herself  down into the further field ; then, leaning her arms upon the cross  bar, she informed the young man :  "No, I don't wanter spoil your  walk. You were goin' p'raps ter  Beacon Point  ? It's very pretty  that wye." "I was going nowhere in particular,"  he replied :  "just exploring, so to speak. I m a stranger in these parts." "How By Ella D'Arcy 89 " How funny ! Imer stranger here too. I only come down  larse Friday to stye with a Naunter mine in  Horton . Are you  stying in  Horton  ? " Willoughby  told her he was not in Orton , but at  Povey Cross   Farm out in the other direction. " Oh,  Mrs. Payne 's, ain't it ? I've heard aunt speak ovver. She  takes summer boarders, don't chee ? I egspec you come from London , heh ?" "And I expect you come from  London  too ? "  said  Willoughby , recognising the familiar accent. " You're as sharp as a needle,"  cried the girl with her un- restrained laugh ;  " so I do. I'm here for a hollerday 'cos I was  so done up with the work and the hot weather. I don't look as  though I'd bin ill, do I ? But I was, though : for it was just  stifflin' hot up in our workrooms all larse month, an' tailorin's  awful hard work at the bester times." Willoughby  felt a sudden accession of interest in her. Like  many intelligent young men, he had dabbled a little in Socialism  and at one time had wandered among the dispossessed ; but since  then, had caught up and held loosely the new doctrine--It is a good  and fitting thing that woman also should earn her bread by the sweat of her brow. Always in reference to the woman who,  fifteen months before, had treated him ill, he had said to himself  that even the breaking of stones in the road should be considered  a more feminine employment than the breaking of hearts. He gave way therefore to a movement of friendliness for this  working daughter of the people, and joined her on the other side  of the stile in token of his approval. She, twisting round to face  him, leaned now with her back against the bar, and the sunset fires  lent a fleeting glory to her face. Perhaps she guessed how  becoming the light was, for she took off her hat and let it touch to gold 90 Irremediable gold the ends and fringes of her rough abundant hair. Thus and  at this moment she made an agreeable picture, to which stood as  background all the beautiful wooded  Southshire  view. " You don't really mean to say you are a tailoress ? "  said Willoughby  with a sort of eager compassion. " I do, though ! An I've bin one ever since I was fourteen.  Look at my fingers if you don't b'lieve me." She put out her right hand, and he took hold of it, as he was  expected to do. The finger-ends were frayed and blackened by  needle-pricks, but the hand itself was plump, moist, and not un-  shapely. She meanwhile examined Willoughby 's fingers enclosing hers. "It's easy ter see you've never done no work ! "  she said, half admiring, half envious.  "I s'pose you re a tip-top swell, ain't you?" "Oh, yes ! I'm a tremendous swell indeed ! "  said  Willoughby   ironically. He thought of his hundred and thirty pounds salary;  and he mentioned his position in the British and Colonial Banking house, without shedding much illumination on her mind ; for she  insisted : " Well, anyhow, you're a gentleman. I've often wished I was  a lady. It must be so nice ter wear fine clo'es an never have ter  do any work all day long." Willoughby  thought it innocent of the girl to say this; it re-  minded him of his own notion as a child--that kings and queens  put on their crowns the  thing on rising in the morning. His  cordiality rose another degree. " If being a gentleman means having nothing to do," said he,  smiling, "I can certainly lay no claim to the title. Life isn't all  beer and skittles with me, any more than it is with you. Which  is the better reason for enjoying the present moment, don't you think By Ella D'Arcy 91 think? Suppose, now, like a kind little girl, you were to  show me the way to  Beacon Point , which you say is so  pretty ? " She required no further persuasion. As he walked beside her  through the upland fields where the dusk was beginning to fall,  and the white evening moths to emerge from their daytime  hiding-places, she asked him many personal questions, most of  which he thought fit to parry. Taking no offence thereat, she   told him, instead, much concerning herself and her family. Thus  he learned her name was  Esther Stables , that she and her people  lived  Whitechapel  way ; that her father was seldom sober, and  her mother always ill ; and that the aunt with whom she was staying kept the post-office and general shop in  Orton village .  He learned, too, that  Esther  was discontented with life in general ;  that, though she hated being at home, she found the country  dreadfully dull ; and that, consequently, she was extremely glad to  have made his acquaintance. But what he chiefly realised when  they parted was that he had spent a couple of pleasant hours  talking nonsense with a girl who was natural, simple-minded, and  entirely free from that repellently protective atmosphere with which a woman of the  " classes"  so carefully surrounds herself.  He and  Esther  had  " made friends " with the ease and rapidity  of children before they have learned the dread meaning of " etiquette,"  and they said good-night, not without some talk  of meeting each other again. Obliged to breakfast at a quarter to eight in town,  Willoughby   was always luxuriously late when in the country, where he took  his meals also in leisurely fashion, often reading from a book  propped up on the table before him. But the morning after his meeting with  Esther Stables  found him less disposed to read than  usual. Her image obtruded itself upon the printed page, and at length 92 Irremediable length grew so importunate he came to the conclusion the only  way to lay it was to confront it with the girl herself. Wanting some tobacco, he saw a good reason for going into Orton .  Esther  had told him he could get tobacco and everything else at her aunt's. He found the post-office to be one of the   houses in the widely spaced village-street. In front of the cottage  was a small garden ablaze with old-fashioned flowers ; and in a  larger garden at one side were apple-trees, raspberry and currant  bushes, and six thatched beehives on a bench. The bowed  windows of the little shop were partly screened by sunblinds ;  nevertheless the lower panes still displayed a heterogeneous collec-  tion of goods--lemons, hanks of yarn, white linen buttons upon  blue cards, sugar cones, warden pipes, and tobacco jars. A  letter-box opened its narrow mouth low down in one wall, and  over the door swung the sign,  "Stamps and money-order office,"   in black letters on white enamelled iron. The interior of the shop was cool and dark. A second glass-  door at the back permitted  Willoughby  to see into a small  sitting-room, and out again through a low and square-paned window to the sunny landscape beyond. Silhouetted against  the light were the heads of two women : the rough young head  of yesterday's  Esther , the lean outline and bugled cap of Esther 's  aunt. It was the latter who at the jingling of the door-bell rose from  her work and came forward to serve the customer ; but the girl,  with much mute meaning in her eyes and a finger laid upon her  smiling mouth, followed behind. Her aunt heard her footfall. " What do you want here,  Esther  ? " she said with thin disapproval ; "get back to your sewing." Esther  gave the young man a signal seen only by him and  slipped out into the side-garden, where he found her when his purchases By Ella D'Arcy 93 purchases were made. She leaned over the privet-hedge to inter-  cept him as he passed. "Aunt's an awful ole maid,"  she remarked apologetically ;  "I b'lieve she'd never let me say a word to enny one if she could  help it." " So you got home all right last night ? " Willoughby  inquired ; " what did your aunt say to you ? " " Oh, she arst me where I'd been, and I tolder a lotter lies ! " Then, with woman's intuition, perceiving that this speech  jarred,  Esther  made haste to add,  "She's so dreadful hard on me !  I dursn't tell her I'd been with a gentleman or she'd never have let  me out alone again." " And at present I suppose you'll be found somewhere about  that same stile every evening ? "  said  Willoughby  foolishly, for he  really did not much care whether he met her again or not. Now  he was actually in her company he was surprised at himself for  having given her a whole morning's thought ; yet the eagerness of  her answer flattered him, too. " To-night I can't come, worse luck ! It's Thursday, and the  shops here close of a Thursday at five. I'll havter keep aunt  company. But to-morrer ?--I can be there to-morrer. You'll  come, say ?" "  Esther  ! "  cried a vexed voice, and the precise, right-minded  aunt emerged through the row of raspberry-bushes ;  " whatever are  you thinking about, delayin the gentleman in this fashion ?"  She  was full of rustic and official civility for  " the gentleman,"  but in  dignant with her niece.  "I don't want none of your  London manners  down here," Willoughby  heard her say as she marched the girl off. He himself was not sorry to be released from  Esther 's too  friendly eyes, and he spent an agreeable evening over a book, and  this time managed to forget her completely. Though 94 Irremediable Though he remembered her  thing next morning, it was to  smile wisely and determine he would not meet her again. Yet by  dinner-time the day seemed long ; why, after all, should he not  meet her ? By tea-time prudence triumphed anew--no, he would  not go. Then he drank his tea hastily and set off for the  stile. Esther  was waiting for him. Expectation had given an  additional colour to her cheeks, and her red-brown hair showed  here and there a beautiful glint of gold. He could not help admiring the vigorous way in which it waved and twisted, or the  little curls which grew at the nape of her neck, tight and close as  those of a young lamb's fleece. Her neck here was admirable, too,  in its smooth creaminess ; and when her eyes lighted up with such  evident pleasure at his coming, how avoid the conviction she was a  good and nice girl after all ? He proposed they should go down into the little copse on the  right, where they would be less disturbed by the occasional passer  by. Here, seated on a felled tree-trunk,  Willoughby  began that  bantering silly meaningless form of conversation known among  the "classes"  as flirting. He had but the wish to make himself agreeable, and to while away the time.  Esther , however, mis-  understood him. Willoughby 's hand lay palm downwards on his knee, and she  noticing a ring which he wore on his little finger, took hold of it. " What a funny ring ! "  she said ;  " let's look ? " To disembarrass himself of her touch he pulled the ring off and  gave it her to examine. " What s that ugly dark green stone ?"  she asked. " It s called a sardonyx." " What's it for ? "  she said, turning it about. " It's a signet ring, to seal letters with." By Ella D'Arcy 95 " An' there's a sorter king's head scratched on it, an' some  writin' too, only I carn't make it out ?" "It isn't the head of a king, although it wears a crown," Willoughby  explained,  "but the head and bust of a Saracen  against whom my ancestor of many hundred years ago went to  fight in the  Holy Land . And the words cut round it are the  motto of our house,  Vertue vaunceth , which means virtue prevails." Willoughby  may have displayed some slight accession of dignity  in giving this bit of family history, for  Esther  fell into uncontrolled  laughter, at which he was much displeased. And when the girl  made as though she would put the ring on her own finger, asking, " Shall I keep it ? "  he coloured up with sudden annoyance. "It was only my fun ! "  said  Esther hastily, and gave him the  ring back, but his cordiality was gone. He felt no inclination to  renew the idle-word pastime, said it was time to go back, and,  swinging his cane vexedly, struck off the heads of the flowers and  the weeds as he went.  Esther walked by his side in complete  silence, a phenomenon of which he presently became conscious.  He felt rather ashamed of having shown temper. " Well, here s your way home,"  said he with an effort at friend- liness.  "Good-bye, we've had a nice evening anyhow. It was  pleasant down there in the woods, eh ? " He was astonished to see her eyes soften with tears, and to hear  the real emotion in her voice as she answered,  " It was just heaven  down there with you until you turned so funny-like. What had  I done to make you cross ? Say you forgive me, do ! " "Silly child ! "  said  Willoughby , completely mollified,  "I'm not  the least angry. There ! good-bye !" and like a fool he kissed  her. He anathematised his folly in the white light of next morning, and, 96 Irremediable and, remembering the kiss he had given her, repented it very  sincerely. He had an uncomfortable suspicion she had not  received it in the same spirit in which it had been bestowed, but,  attaching more serious meaning to it, would build expectations  thereon which must be left unfulfilled. It were best indeed not to  meet her again ; for he acknowledged to himself that, though he  only half liked, and even slightly feared, her, there was a certain  attraction about her--was it in her dark unflinching eyes or in  her very red lips ?--which might lead him into greater follies  still. Thus it came about that for two successive evenings  Esther   waited for him in vain, and on the  evening he said to himself  with a grudging relief that by this time she had probably trans-  ferred her affections to some one else. It was Saturday, the second Saturday since he left town. He  spent the day about the farm, contemplated the pigs, inspected the  feeding of the stock, and assisted at the afternoon milking. Then  at evening, with a refilled pipe, he went for a long lean over the  west gate, while he traced fantastic pictures and wove romances in  the glories of the sunset clouds. He watched the colours glow from gold to scarlet, change to  crimson, sink at last to sad purple reefs and isles, when the sudden  consciousness of some one being near him made him turn round.  There stood  Esther , and her eyes were full of eagerness and anger. " Why have you never been to the stile again ? "  she asked him. "You promised to come faithful, and you never came. Why  have you not kep your promise ? Why ?--why ? "  she persisted,  stamping her foot because  Willoughby  remained silent. What could he say ! Tell her she had no business to follow  him like this ; or own, what was, unfortunately, the truth, he was  just a little glad to see her ? "P'raps By Ella D'Arcy 97 " P'raps you don't care to see me ?"  she said.  " Well, why did  you kiss me, then ? " Why, indeed ! thought  Willoughby , marvelling at his own  idiotcy, and yet--such is the inconsistency of man--not wholly  without the desire to kiss her again. And while he looked at her  she suddenly flung herself down on the hedge-bank at his feet and  burst into tears. She did not cover up her face, but simply pressed  one cheek down upon the grass while the water poured from her eyes with astonishing abundance.  Willoughby  saw the dry earth  turn dark and moist as it drank the tears in. This, his   experience of  Esther  s powers of weeping, distressed him horribly ;  never in his life before had he seen any one weep like that; he  should not have believed such a thing possible, and he was alarmed, too, lest she should be noticed from the house. He opened the  gate ; " Esther ! "  he begged, "don't cry. Come out here, like  a dear girl, and let us talk sensibly." Because she stumbled, unable to see her way through wet eyes,  he gave her his hand, and they found themselves in a field of corn,  walking along the narrow grass-path that skirted it, in the shadow  of the hedgerow. " What is there to cry about because you have not seen me for  two days ? "  he began ;  " why,  Esther , we are only strangers, after  all. When we have been at home a week or two we shall scarcely  remember each other's names." Esther  sobbed at intervals, but her tears had ceased.  "It's fine  for you to talk of home,"  she said to this. " You've got some  thing that is a home, I s'pose ? But me! my home's like hell,  with nothing but quarrellin' and cursin', and father who beats us  whether sober or drunk. Yes ! "  she repeated shrewdly, seeing  the lively disgust on  Willoughby 's face,  " he beat me, all ill as I  was, jus' before I come away. I could show you the bruises on my 98 Irremediable my arms still. And now to go back there after knowin' you !  It ll be worse than ever. I can't endure it and I won't ! I'll  put an end to it or myself somehow, I swear ! " " But, my poor  Esther , how can I help it, what can I do ? "  said Willoughby . He was greatly moved, full of wrath with her  father, with all the world which makes women suffer. He had  suffered himself at the hands of a woman, and severely, but this, instead of hardening his heart, had only rendered it the more  supple. And yet he had a vivid perception of the peril in which  he stood. An interior voice urged him to break away, to seek  safety in flight even at the cost of appearing cruel or ridiculous ;  so, coming to a point in the field where an elm-bole jutted out  across the path, he saw with relief he could now withdraw his  hand from the girl's, since they must walk singly to skirt round it. Esther  took a step in advance, stopped and suddenly turned to  face him ; she held out her two hands and her face was very near  his own. "Don't you care for me one little bit ? "  she said wistfully, and surely sudden madness fell upon him. For he kissed her again, he  kissed her many times, and pushed all thoughts of the consequences  far from him. But some of these consequences already called loudly to him as  he and Esther  reached the last gate on the road to  Orton . "You know I have only &#0000163;130 a year ? "  he told her :  "it s no  very brilliant prospect for you to marry me on that." For he had actually offered her marriage, although such  conduct to the mediocre man must appear incredible or at least  uncalled for. But to Willoughby  it seemed the only course  possible. How else justify his kisses, rescue her from her father's  brutality, or bring back the smiles to her face ? As for  Esther , sudden exultation had leaped in her heart ; then By Ella D'Arcy 99 then 'ere fifty seconds were gone by, she was certain she would  never have consented to anything less. "O ! I'me used to managin',"  she told him confidently, and  mentally resolved to buy herself, so soon as she was married, a  black feather boa, such as she had coveted last winter. Willoughby  spent the remaining days of his holiday in thinking  out and planning with  Esther  the details of his return to  London   and her own, the secrecy to be observed, the necessary legal steps  to be taken, and the quiet suburb in which they would set up  housekeeping. And, so successfully did he carry out his arrange ments, that within five weeks from the day on which he had   met Esther Stables  he and she came out one morning from a Lucy Rimmerton  in  Highbury  husband and wife. It was a mellow Septem-  ber day, the streets were filled with sunshine, and  Willoughby ,  in reckless high spirits, imagined he saw a reflection of his own  gaiety on the indifferent faces of the passers-by. There being no  one else to perform the office he congratulated himself very warmly,  and  Esther 's frequent laughter filled in the pauses of the day. Three months later  Willoughby  was dining with a friend, and  the hour-hand of the clock nearing ten the host no longer resisted  the guest s growing anxiety to be gone. He arose and exchanged  with him good wishes and good-byes. " Marriage is evidently a most successful institution,"  said he,  half jesting, half sincere ;  "you almost make me inclined to go  and get married myself. Confess now your thoughts have been  at home the whole evening ? " Willoughby  thus addressed turned red to the roots of his hair,  but did not deny the soft impeachment. The other laughed.  " And very commendable they should be,"   he continued,  " since you are scarcely, so to speak, out of your honeymoon." With 100 Irremediable With a social smile on his lips Willough by calculated a moment  before replying,  " I have been married exactly three months and  three days ; "  then, after a few words respecting their next meeting,  the two shook hands and parted, the young host to finish the  evening with books and pipe, the young husband to set out on a  twenty minutes walk to his home. It was a cold clear December night following a day of rain. A  touch of frost in the air had dried the pavements, and  Willoughby 's  footfall ringing upon the stones re-echoed down the empty  suburban street. Above his head was a dark remote sky thickly  powdered with stars, and as he turned westward Alpherat hung for a moment  " comme le point sur un  i , " over the slender spire of St. John's . But he was insensible to the worlds about him ; he  was absorbed in his own thoughts, and these, as his friend had  surmised, were entirely with his wife. For  Esther 's face was  always before his eyes, her voice was always in his ears, she filled  the universe for him ; yet only four months ago he had never  seen her, had never heard her name. This was the curious part  of it--here in December he found himself the husband of a girl  who was completely dependent upon him not only for food,  clothes, and lodging, but for her present happiness, her whole future life ; and last July he had been scarcely more than a boy  himself, with no greater care on his mind than the pleasant difficulty  of deciding where he should spend his annual three weeks holiday. But it is events, not months or years, which age.  Willoughby ,  who was only twenty-six, remembered his youth as a sometime  companion irrevocably lost to him ; its vague, delightful hopes  were now crystallised into definite ties, and its happy irresponsi-  bility displaced by a sense of care inseparable perhaps from the  most fortunate of marriages. As he reached the street in which he lodged his pace involun- tarily By Ella D'Arcy 101 tarily slackened. While still some distance off his eye sought out  and distinguished the windows of the room in which  Esther   awaited him. Through the broken slats of the Venetian blinds  he could see the yellow gaslight within. The parlour beneath  was in darkness ; his landlady had evidently gone to bed, there  being no light over the hall door either. In some apprehension he consulted his watch under the last street-lamp he passed, to  find comfort in assuring himself it was only ten minutes after  ten. He let himself in with his latch-key, hung up his hat and  overcoat by the sense of touch, and, groping his way upstairs,  opened the door of the  floor sitting-room. At the table in the centre of the room sat his wife, leaning upon  her elbows, her two hands thrust up into her ruffled hair ; spread  out before her was a crumpled yesterday's newspaper, and so  interested was she to all appearance in its contents that she neither  spoke nor looked up as Willoughby  entered. Around her were  the still uncleared tokens of her last meal : tea-slops, bread-crumbs,  and an eggshell crushed to fragments upon a plate, which was one  of those trifles that set  Willoughby 's teeth on edge--whenever  his wife ate an egg she persisted in turning the egg-cup upside  down upon the tablecloth, and pounding the shell to pieces in her  plate with her spoon. The room was repulsive in its disorder. The one lighted  burner of the gaselier, turned too high, hissed up into a long  tongue of flame. The fire smoked feebly under a newly adminis-  tered shovelful of  " slack," and a heap of ashes and cinders  littered the grate. A pair of walking boots, caked in dry mud, lay  on the hearthrug just where they had been thrown off. On the  mantelpiece, amidst a dozen other articles which had no business  there, was a bedroom-candlestick ; and every single article of  furniture stood crookedly out of its place. Willoughby 102 Irremediable Willoughby  took in the whole intolerable picture, and yet spoke  with kindliness.  "Well,  Esther  ! I'm not so late, after all. I hope  you did not feel the time dull by yourself ? "  Then he explained  the reason of his absence. He had met a friend he had not seen for  a couple of years, who had insisted on taking him home to dine. His wife gave no sign of having heard him ; she kept he eyes  rivetted on the paper before her. "You received my wire, of course," Willoughby  went on, "and did not wait ? " Now she crushed the newspaper up with a passionate move-  ment, and threw it from her. She raised her head, showing cheeks  blazing with anger, and dark, sullen, unflinching eyes. " I did wyte then ! "  she cried.  "I wyted till near eight before  I got your old telegraph ! I s'pose that's what you call the  manners of a gentleman, to keep your wife mewed up here,  while you go gallivantin' off with your fine friends ?" Whenever  Esther  was angry, which was often, she taunted Willoughby  with being  "a gentleman,"  although this was the  precise point about him which at other times found most favour  in her eyes. But to-night she was envenomed by the idea he had  been enjoying himself without her, stung by fear lest he should  have been in company with some other woman. Willoughby , hearing the taunt, resigned himself to the inevit-  able. Nothing that he could do might now avert the breaking  storm, all his words would only be twisted into fresh griefs. But  sad experience had taught him that to take refuge in silence was more fatal still. When  Esther  was in such a mood as this it was  best to supply the fire with fuel, that, through the very violence of  the conflagration, it might the sooner burn itself out. So he said what soothing things he could, and  Esther  caught  them up, disfigured them, and flung them back at him with scorn. By Ella D'Arcy 103 scorn. She reproached him with no longer caring for her ;  she vituperated the conduct of his family in never taking the  smallest notice of her marriage ; and she detailed the insolence of  the landlady, who had told her that morning she pitied  " poor  Mr. Willoughby ,"  and had refused to go out and buy herrings for Esther 's early dinner. Every affront or grievance, real or imaginary, since the dayshe  and Willoughby  had  met, she poured forth with a fluency due  to frequent repetition, for, with the exception of to-day's added  injuries,  Willoughby had heard the whole litany many times  before. While she raged and he looked at her, he remembered he had  once thought her pretty. He had seen beauty in her rough brown  hair, her strong colouring, her full red mouth. He fell into  musing .... a woman may lack beauty, he told himself, and yet  be loved.... Meantime  Esther  reached white heats of passion, and the strain  could no longer be sustained. She broke into sobs and began to  shed tears with the facility peculiar to her. In a moment her face  was all wet with the big drops which rolled down her cheeks faster and faster and fell with audible splashes on to the table, on  to her lap, on to the floor. To this tearful abundance, formerly a  surprising spectacle,  Willoughby  was now acclimatised ; but the  remnant of chivalrous feeling not yet extinguished in his bosom  forbade him to sit stolidly by while a woman wept, without seeking to console her. As on previous occasions, his peace-  overtures were eventually accepted.  Esther 's tears gradually  ceased to flow, she began to exhibit a sort of compunction, she  wished to be forgiven, and, with the kiss of reconciliation, passed  into a phase of demonstrative affection perhaps more trying to Willoughby 's patience than all that had preceded it.  " You don't The Yellow Book--Vol. I. G love 104 Irremediable love me ?"  she questioned,  "I'm sure you don't love me ?"  she reiterated ; and he asseverated that he loved her until he loathed  himself. Then at last, only half satisfied, but wearied out with vexation--possibly, too, with a movement of pity at the sight of  his haggard face--she consented to leave him ; only what was he  going to do ? she asked suspiciously : write those rubbishing  stories of his ? Well, he must promise not to stay up more than  half an hour at the latest only until he had smoked one pipe ! Willoughby  promised, as he would have promised anything on  earth to secure to himself a half-hour s peace and solitude.  Esther   groped for her slippers, which were kicked off under the table ;  scratched four or five matches along the box and threw them away  before she succeeded in lighting her candle ; set it down again to  contemplate her tear-swollen reflection in the chimney-glass, and  burst out laughing. " What a fright I do look, to be sure ! "  she remarked com- placently, and again thrust her two hands up through her dis-  ordered curls. Then, holding the candle at such an angle that the  grease ran over on to the carpet, she gave  Willoughby another  vehement kiss and trailed out of the room with an ineffectual attempt to close the door behind her. Willoughby  got up to shut it himself, and wondered why it was  that  Esther  never did any one mortal thing efficiently or well.  Good God ! how irritable he felt ! It was impossible to write.  He must find an outlet for his impatience, rend or mend  something. He began to straighten the room, but a wave or  disgust came over him before the task was fairly commenced. What was the use ? To-morrow all would be bad as ever.  What was the use of doing anything ? He sat down by the table  and leaned his head upon his hands. &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; The By Ella D'Arcy 105 The past came back to him in pictures : his boyhood's past   of all. He saw again the old home, every inch of which was  familiar to him as his own name ; he reconstructed in his thought  all the old well-known furniture, and replaced it precisely as it had  stood long ago. He passed again a childish finger over the rough  surface of the faded  Utrecht  velvet chairs, and smelled again the  strong fragrance of the white lilac-tree, blowing in through the  open parlour-window. He savoured anew the pleasant mental  atmosphere produced by the dainty neatness of cultured women,  the companionship of a few good pictures, of a few good books.  Yet this home had been broken up years ago, the dear familiar  things had been scattered far and wide, never to find themselves  under the same roof again ; and from those near relatives who still  remained to him he lived now hopelessly estranged. Then came the past of his  love-dream, when he worshipped  at the feet of  Nora Beresford , and, with the wholeheartedness of  the true fanatic, clothed his idol with every imaginable attribute of  virtue and tenderness. To this day there remained a secret shrine  in his heart wherein the Lady of his young ideal was still enthroned, although it was long since he had come to perceive she  had nothing whatever in common with the  Nora of reality. For  the real  Nora  he had no longer any sentiment : she had passed  altogether out of his life and thoughts ; and yet, so permanent is  all influence, whether good or evil, that the effect she wrought  upon his character remained. He recognised to-night that her  treatment of him in the past did not count for nothing among the  various factors which had determined his fate. Now the past of only last year returned, and, strangely enough,  this seemed farther removed from him than all the rest. He had  been particularly strong, well and happy this time last year. Nora  was dismissed from his mind, and he had thrown all his energies into 106 Irremediable into his work. His tastes were sane and simple, and his dingy,  furnished rooms had become through habit very pleasant to him.  In being his own they were invested with a greater charm than  another man s castle. Here he had smoked and studied, here he  had made many a glorious voyage into the land of books. Many  a home-coming, too, rose up before him out of the dark un-  genial streets to a clean blazing fire, a neatly laid cloth, an evening  of ideal enjoyment ; many a summer twilight when he mused at the open window, plunging his gaze deep into the recesses of his neighbour's lime-tree, where the unseen sparrows chattered with  such unflagging gaiety. He had always been given to much day-dreaming, and it was in  the silence of his rooms of an evening that he turned his phantas-  mal adventures into stories for the magazines ; here had come to  him many an editorial refusal, but, here, too, he had received the  news of his  unexpected success. All his happiest memories  were embalmed in those shabby, badly furnished rooms. Now all was changed. Now might there be no longer any  soft indulgence of the hour's mood. His rooms and everything he  owned belonged now to  Esther , too. She had objected to most of his photographs, and had removed them. She hated books, and were  he ever so ill-advised as to open one in her presence, she im-  mediately began to talk, no matter how silent or how sullen her  previous mood had been. If he read aloud to her she either  yawned despairingly, or was tickled into laughter where there was  no reasonable cause. At ,  Willoughby  had tried to educate  her and had gone hopefully to the task. It is so natural to think  you may make what you will of the woman who loves you. But Esther  had no wish to improve. She evinced all the self-  satisfaction of an illiterate mind. To her husband's gentle  admonitions she replied with brevity that she thought her way quite By Ella D'Arcy 107 quite as good as his ; or, if he didn't approve of her pronunciation,  he might do the other thing, she was too old to go to school again.  He gave up the attempt, and, with humiliation at his prerious  fatuity, perceived that it was folly to expect a few weeks of his  companionship could alter or pull up the impressions of years,  or rather of generations. Yet here he paused to admit a curious thing : it was not only Esther 's bad habits which vexed him, but habits quite unblame-  worthy in themselves, and which he never would have noticed in  another, irritated him in her. He disliked her manner of standing,  of walking, of sitting in a chair, of folding her hands. Like a  lover he was conscious of her proximity without seeing her. Like  a lover, too, his eyes followed her every movement, his ear noted  every change in her voice. But, then, instead of being charmed  by everything as the lover is, everything jarred upon him. What was the meaning of this ? To-night the anomaly pressed  upon him : he reviewed his position. Here was he quite a young  man, just twenty-six years of age, married to  Esther , and bound to  live with her so long as life should last twenty, forty, perhaps fifty years more. Every day of those years to be spent in her  society ; he and she face to face, soul to soul ; they two alone  amid all the whirling, busy, indifferent world. So near together in  semblance, in truth so far apart as regards all that makes life dear. Willoughby  groaned. From the woman he did not love, whom  he had never loved, he might not again go free ; so much he  recognised. The feeling he had once entertained for  Esther , strange  compound of mistaken chivalry and flattered vanity, was long since  extinct ; but what, then, was the sentiment with which she inspired  him ? For he was not indifferent to her--no, never for one instant  could he persuade himself he was indifferent, never for one instant  could he banish her from his thoughts. His mind's eye followed her 108 Irremediable her during his hours of absence as pertinaciously as his bodily eye  dwelt upon her actual presence. She was the principal object of  the universe to him, the centre around which his wheel of life  revolved with an appalling fidelity. What did it mean ? What could it mean ? he asked himself  with anguish. And the sweat broke out upon his forehead and his hands grew  cold, for on a sudden the truth lay there like a written word upon  the tablecloth before him. This woman, whom he had taken to  himself for better for worse, inspired him with a passion intense  indeed, all-masterful, soul-subduing as Love itself -- . . . But when  he understood the terror of his Hatred, he laid his head upon his  arms and wept, not facile tears like  Esther 's, but tears wrung out  from his agonising, unavailing regret.

The Reflected Faun By   Laurence Housman Reproduced by Messrs Carl Hentschel&amp;Co. A Sentimental Cellar By   George Saintsbury [It would appear from the reference to a  " Queen "  that the following piece was written in or with a view to the reign of Queen Anne , though an anachronism or two (such as a reference to the '45 and a quotation from  Adam Smith ) may be noted. On the other hand, an occasional mixture of  " you "  and " thou "  seems to argue a date before  Johnson . It must at any rate have been composed for, or in imitation of the style of, one or other of the eighteenth-century collections of Essays.] I  T  chanced the other day that I had a mind to visit my old  friend  Falernianus . The maid who opened the door to me  showed me into his study, and apologised for her master's absence  by saying that he was in the cellar. He soon appeared, and I  rallied him a little on the gravity of his occupation.  Falernianus ,  I must tell you, is neither a drunkard nor a man of fortune. But  he has a pretty taste in wine, indulges it rather in collection than  in consumption, and arranges his cellar (or, as he sometimes calls  it,  " cellaret " ) himself, having no butler or other man-servant.  He took my pleasantry very good-humouredly ; and when I asked him further if I might behold this temple of his devotions  he complied at once.  " Tis rather a chantry than a temple, Eugenius A Sentimental Cellar 120 Eugenius ,"  said he,  " but you are very welcome to see it if you  please ; and if you are minded to hear a sermon, perhaps I can  preach one different from what you may expect at an Oracle of  the Bottle." We soon reached the cavern, which, indeed, was much less  magnificent than that over which  Bacbuc  presided ; and I  perused, not without interest (for I had often tasted the contents), the various bins in which bottles of different shapes and sizes were  stowed away with a modest neatness.  Falernianus amused him-  self, and did not go so far as to weary me, with some tales of luck  or disappointment in his purchases, of the singular improvement of this vintage, and the mortifying conduct of that. For these  wine-lovers are curious in their phrase ; and it is not disgusting to  hear them say regretfully that the claret of such and such a year "has not spoken yet" ; or that another was long  "under the  curse of the seventies."  This last phrase, indeed, had a grandilo  quent and romantic turn which half surprised me from my friend,  a humourist with a special horror of fine speech or writing, and  turning sharply I saw a smile on his lips. " But,"  said I,  " my  Falernianus , your sermon ? For I scarce  think that this wine-chat would be dignified by you with such a  name." "You are right,  Eugenius ,"  answered he,  " but I do not quite  know whether I am wise to disclose even to you the ruling fancy  under which I have formed this little liquid museum, or Baccheum  if you prefer it." " I think you may,"  said I,  " for in the  place we are old enough friends for such confidences, and in the second I know  you to be too much given to laugh at your own foibles to be  greatly afraid of another's ridicule." " You say well,"  he said,  " so mark ! For if my sermon inflicts what By George Saintsbury 121 what our toasts call ennui upon you, remember that in the  words of their favourite  Molière ,  "You have willed it." " "I do not,  Eugenius , pretend to be indifferent to good wine in  itself. But when I called this little cellar of mine just now a  museum I did no dishonour to the daughters of Mnemosyne .  For you will observe that wine, by the fact of its keeping powers  and by the other fact of its date being known, is a sort of calendar  made to the hand of whoso would commemorate, with a festive  solemnity, the things that are, as  Mr. Dryden  says," " Hid in the sacred treasure of the past." "If not the mere juice of the grape (for the merit of the strongest  wine after fifty or sixty years is mostly but itself a memory), strong waters brewed on the day of a man's birth will keep their fire  and gain ever fresh mellowness though he were to outlive the  longest lifetime ; and in these little flasks here, my  Eugenius ,  you will find a cup of Nantz that was born with me, and that  will keep its virtues long after thou and I have gone to solve  the great enigma. Again, thou seest those pints of red port  which nestle together ? Within a few days,  Eugenius , of the  time when that must was foaming round the  Douro  peasants, I  made mine entrance at the  University . You can imagine with  what a mixture of tender and humorous feelings I quaff them now  and then. When their juice was tunned, what amiable visions,  what boyish hopes floated before my eyes ! I was to carry off  all that  Cam  or  Isis  had of honours or profit, all that either  could give of learning. I was to have my choice of learned  retirement on the one hand, or of ardent struggle at the hoarse  bar on the other, with the prizes of the senate beyond. They  were scarce throwing down their crust when that dream faded ; they 122 A Sentimental Cellar they had scarce become drinkable by a hasty toper before I  saw clearly that metaphysical aid was wanting, and that a very  different fate must be mine. I make no moan over it,  Eugenius ,  and I puff away like a worse than prostitute as she is, the demon  Envy when she whispers in my ear the names of Titius  or  Seius ,  and adds, Had they better parts, or only better stars than you ?  But as they fable that the wine itself throbs with the early move  ment of the sap in the vines, so,  Eugenius , when I sip that cordial  (and truth tis a noble vintage) the old hopes, the old follies, the  old dreams waken in me, and I am once more eighteen." " Look yonder again at those cobwebbed vessels of various  shapes that lie side by side, although of different vineyards, in the  peaceful bins. They all date from a year in which the wheel of  fortune brought honest men to the top in  England  ; and if only  for a brief space, as, I am told, they sing in  North Britain , the  de'il went hame wi a the Whigs before him (I must tell you,  Mr.----, that Falernianus , though a loyal subject to our good Queen , is a most malignant Tory, and indeed I have heard him  impeached of Jacobitism by ill-willers). But no more of politics."   He paused a moment and then went on: "I think I see you smile  again,  Eugenius , and say to yourself, These are but dry-lipped subjects for so flowing a calendar. And to tell the truth, my  friend, the main part of my ephemerides of this kind has been filled  by the aid of the goddess who was ever nearest and kindest to Bacchus . In yonder bin lie phials of the mightiest port that  Lusitanian summers ever blackened, and flasks of sack from the  more southern parts of that peninsula, which our Ben  or his son Herrick  would have loved. In the same year which saw the  pressing of these generous juices the earth was made more fair by  the birth of  Bellamira  and  Candiope . The blackest purple of the  Lusitanian grape is not so black as the tresses of  Candiope 's hair, nor By George Saintsbury 123 nor doth the golden glow of the sherris approach in flame the  locks of Bellamira  ; but if I let the sunlight play through both,  Love, with fantastic triumph, shows me, as the bright motes  flicker and flee through the sack, the tawny eyes of Candiope , and  the stain, no longer black or purple, but rosy red, that floats from  the Oportian juice on the white napery, recalls the velvet blush of Bellamira 's cheek." " And this ? "  I said, pointing to a bin of Bordeaux near me. " Thou shalt try it this very day,"  said  Falernianus  with a laugh,  which I thought carried off some feelings a little overstrained ; " tis a right pleasant wine, and they made it in the year when I saw the lips of  Damaris . The flavour is not unlike theirs, and if  it should fluster thine head a little, and cause thee what men call  heartburn, I will not say that the effects are wholly dissimilar "   It is not like  Falernianus  even to jest at women, and I turned to  another. His face cleared.  " Many a year has passed,"  he said, "since the grape that bore that juice was gathered, and even as it  was ripening it chanced that I met  Lalage and won her. The  wine was always good and the love likewise ; but in neither in  their early years was there half the pleasure that there is now. But  I weary you,  Eugenius , and perhaps the philosopher speaks truly  in saying that these things are not matters of sympathy, or, as the  Scripture saith, a stranger is not partaker of them. Suffice it to  say that these imprisoned rubies and topazes, amethysts and  jacinths, never flash in the glass, nor collect their deeper body of  colour in the flagon, without bringing a memory with them, that  my lips seldom kiss them without recalling other kisses, my  eye never beholds them without seeing other colours and other  forms in &quot;the sessions of sweet silent thought.&quot; At the refining  of this elixir I assumed the virile gown ; when that nectar was fit  for drinking I made my  appearance in the field of letters ; and The Yellow Book--Vol. I.  H this 124 A Sentimental Cellar this again recalls the death of dear friends and the waning of idle hopes. When I am dead, or if any reverse of fortune makes me  part with this cabinet of quintessence, it will pass to heirs or pur-  chasers as so much good wine and nothing more. To me it is  that and much more--a casket of magic liquors, a museum, as I  have called it, of glasses like that of  Dr. Dee , in which I see again  the smile of beauty and the hope of youth, in which once more I  win, lose, possess, conquer, am defeated ; in which I live over  again in the recesses of fantasy the vanished life of the past." " But it is not often that I preach in this fashion. Let us take  a turn in the garden while they get dinner ready, that you may  taste,"  and he smiled,  "that you may taste--if you dare--the wine  that I have likened to the lips of  Damaris ."

I know Your heart holds many a  Romeo . And I, who call to mind your face In so serene a pausing-place, Where the bright pure expanse of sea, The shadowy shore's austerity, Seems a reproach to you and me, I too have sought on many a breast The ecstasy of love's unrest, I too have had my dreams, and met (Ah me !) how many a  Juliet . Why is it, then, that I recall You, neither  nor last of all ? For, surely as I see to-night The glancing of the lighthouse light, Against the sky, across the bay, As turn by turn it falls my way, So 130 Stella Marris So surely do I see your eyes Out of the empty night arise, Child, you arise and smile to me Out of the night, out of the sea, The Nereid of a moment there, And is it seaweed in your hair ? O lost and wrecked, how long ago, Out of the drowned past, I know, You come to call me, come to claim My share of your delicious shame. Child, I remember, and can tell One night we loved each other well ; And one night's love, at least or most, Is not so small a thing to boast. You were adorable, and I Adored you to infinity, That nuptial night too briefly borne To the oblivion of morn. Oh, no oblivion ! for I feel Your lips deliriously steal Along my neck, and fasten there ; I feel the perfume of your hair, And your soft breast that heaves and dips, Desiring my desirous lips, And that ineffable delight When souls turn bodies, and unite In the intolerable, the whole Rapture of the embodied soul. That joy was ours, we passed it by ; You have forgotten me, and I Remember By Arthur Symons 131 Remember you thus strangely, won An instant from oblivion. find I, remembering, would declare That joy, not shame, is ours to share, Joy that we had the will and power, In spite of fate, to snatch one hour, Out of vague nights, and days at strife, So infinitely full of life. And tis for this I see you rise, A wraith, with starlight in your eyes, Here, where the drowsy-minded mood Is one with Nature's solitude ; For this, for this, you come to me Out of the night, out of the sea. A Study By   Sir Frederic Leighton, P.R.A. Reproduced by the Swan Electric Engraving Company Two Sketches By   Henry Harland I--Mercedes W  HEN  I was a child some one gave me a family of white  mice. I don't remember how old I was, I think about  ten or eleven ; but I remember very clearly the day I received  them. It must have been a Thursday, a half-holiday, for I had  come home from school rather early in the afternoon.  Alexandre ,  dear old ruddy round-faced Alexandre , who opened the door for  me, smiled in a way that seemed to announce,  " There's a surprise  in store for you, sir."  Then my mother smiled too, a smile, I  thought, of peculiar promise and interest. After I had kissed her  she said,  " Come into the dining-room. There's something you  will like."  Perhaps I concluded it would be something to eat.  Anyhow, all agog with curiosity, I followed her into the dining-  room--and  Alexandre followed me, anxious to take part in the  rejoicing. In the window stood a big cage, enclosing the family  of white mice. I remember it as a very big cage indeed ; no doubt I should  find it shrunken to quite moderate dimensions if I could see it  again. There were three generations of mice in it : a fat old  couple, the founders of the race, dozing phlegmatically on their laurels 136 Two Sketches laurels in a corner ; then a dozen medium-sized, slender mice,  trim and youthful-looking, rushing irrelevantly hither and thither,  with funny inquisitive little faces ; and then a squirming mass of  pink things, like caterpillars, that were really infant mice, new  born. They didn't remain infants long, though. In a few days  they had put on virile togas of white fur, and were scrambling  about the cage and nibbling their food as independently as their  elders. The rapidity with which my mice multiplied and grew  to maturity was a constant source of astonishment to me. It  seemed as if every morning I found a new litter of young mice in  the cage--though how they had effected an entrance through the wire gauze that lined it was a hopeless puzzle--and these would  have become responsible, self-supporting mice in no time. My mother told me that somebody had sent me this soul-  stirring present from the country, and I dare say I was made to  sit down and write a letter of thanks. But I'm ashamed to own  I can't remember who the giver was. I have a vague notion that  it was a lady, an elderly maiden-lady-- Mademoiselle ..... some  thing that began with P--  who lived near Tours , and who used  to come to Paris  once or twice a year, and always brought me a  box of prunes. Alexandre  carried the cage into my play-room, and set it up  against the wall. I stationed myself in front of it, and remained  there all the rest of the afternoon, gazing in, entranced. To watch  their antics, their comings and goings, their labours and amuse-  ments, to study their shrewd, alert physiognomies, to wonder  about their feelings, thoughts, intentions, to try to divine the  meaning of their busy twittering language--it was such keen,  deep delight. Of course I was an anthropomorphist, and read a  great deal of human nature into them ; otherwise it wouldn t have  been such fun. I dragged myself reluctantly away when I was called By Henry Harland 137 called to dinner. It was hard that evening to apply myself to  my school-books. Before I went to bed I paid them a parting  visit ; they were huddled together in their nest of cotton-wool,  sleeping soundly. And I was up at an unheard-of hour next  morning, to have a bout with them before going to school. I  found  Alexandre , in his nightcap and long white apron, occupied  with the  soins de propret&#x61673;,  as he said. He cleaned out the cage, put in fresh food and water, and then, pointing to the fat old  couple, the grandparents, who stopped lazily abed, sitting up and  rubbing their noses together, whilst their juniors scampered merrily  about their affairs,  "  Tiens ! On dirait  Monsieur et Madame Denis,  "  he cried. I felt the appositeness of his allusion ; and the  old couple were forthwith officially denominated  Monsieur and  Madame Denis , for their resemblance to the hero and heroine of the song--though which was Monsieur, and which Madame, I'm  not sure that I ever clearly knew. It was a little after this that I was taken for the  time in  my life to the play. I fancy the theatre must have been the  Porte  St. Martin  ; at any rate, it was a theatre in the Boulevard, and  towards the East, for I remember the long drive we had to reach  it. And the piece was  The Count of Monte Cristo . In my  memory the adventure shines, of course, as a vague blur of light  and joy ; a child s  visit to the play, and that play  The Count  of Monte Cristo ! It was all the breath-taking pleasantness of  romance made visible, audible, actual. A vague blur of light and  joy, from which only two details separate themselves. , the  prison scene, and an aged man, with a long white beard, moving a  great stone from the wall ; then--the figure of  Mercedes . I went  home terribly in love with  Mercedes . Surely there are no such grande passions  in maturer life as those helpless, inarticulate ones  we burn in secret with before our teens ; surely we never love again 138 Two Sketches again so violently, desperately, consumedly. Anyhow, I went  home terribly in love with  Mercedes . And--do all children lack  humour ?--I picked out the prettiest young ladyish-looking mouse  in my collection, cut off her moustaches, adopted her as my  especial pet, and called her by the name of my  dea cert&#x61672; , All of my mice by this time had become quite tame. They  had plenty to eat and drink, and a comfortable home, and not a  care in the world ; and familiarity with their master had bred  assurance ; and so they had become quite tame and shamefully,  abominably lazy. Luxury, we are taught, was ever the mother of  sloth. I could put my hand in amongst them, and not one would  bestir himself the littlest bit to escape me. Mercedes  and I were inseparable. I used to take her to school with me every day ; she  could be more conveniently and privately transported than a lamb.  Each lyce&#x61673;n  had a desk in front of his form, and she would spend  the school-hours in mine, I leaving the lid raised a little, that she  might have light and air. One day, the usher having left the  room for a moment, I put her down on the floor, thereby creating  a great excitement amongst my fellow-pupils, who got up from  their places and formed an eager circle round her. Then suddenly  the usher came back, and we all hurried to our seats, while he,  catching sight of  Mercedes , cried out,  " A mouse ! A white  mouse ! Who dares to bring a white mouse to the class ? "  And  he made a dash for her. But she was too quick, too cute, for "the likes of" Monsieur le Pion . She gave a jump, and in the  twinkling of an eye had disappeared up my leg, under my trousers.  The usher searched high and low for her, but she prudently  remained in her hiding-place ; and thus her life was saved, for  when he had abandoned his ineffectual chase, he announced,  " I  should have wrung her neck."  I turned pale to imagine the doom   she had escaped as by a hair's breadth.  " It is useless to ask which of By Henry Harland 139 of you brought her here,"  he continued.  " But mark my words : if ever I find a mouse again in the class  I will wring her neck ! "   And yet, in private life, this bloodthirsty  pion  was a quite gentle, kindly, underfed, underpaid, shabby, struggling fellow, with literary aspirations, who would not have hurt a fly. The secrets of a schoolboy's pocket! I once saw a boy  surreptitiously angling in  Kensington Gardens , with a string and  a bent pin. Presently he landed a fish, a fish no bigger than your  thumb, perhaps, but still a fish. Alive and wet and flopping as  it was, he slipped it into his pocket. I used to carry  Mercedes   about in mine. One evening, when I put in my hand to take her  out, I discovered to my bewilderment that she was not alone.  There were four little pink mites of infant mice clinging to her. I had enjoyed my visit to the theatre so much that at the  jour  de l'an  my father included a toy-theatre among my presents. It  had a real curtain of green baize, that would roll up and down,  and beautiful coloured scenery that you could shift, and footlights,  and a trap-door in the middle ot the stage ; and indeed it would  have been altogether perfect, except for the Company. I have  since learned that this is not infrequently the case with theatres.  My company consisted of pasteboard men and women who, as  artists, struck me as eminently unsatisfactory. They couldn't  move their arms or legs, and they had such stolid, uninteresting  faces. I don t know how it  occurred to me to turn them all  off, and fill their places with my mice.  Mercedes , of course, was  leading lady ; Monsieur and Madame Denis  were the heavy  parents ; and a gentlemanlike young mouse named  Leander  was jeune premier . Then, in my leisure, they used to act the most  tremendous plays. I was stage-manager, prompter, playwright,  chorus, and audience, placing the theatre before a looking-glass, so  that, though my duties kept me behind, I could peer round the edge, 140 Two Sketches edge, and watch the spectacle as from the front. I would invent  the lines and deliver them, but, that my illusion might be the  more complete, I would change my voice for each personage  The lines tried hard to be verses ; no doubt they were  vers libres .  At any rate, they were mouth-filling and sonorous. The   play we attempted, I need hardly say, was  Le Comte de Monte  Cristo , such version of it as I could reconstruct from memory.  That had rather a long run. Then I dramatised  Aladdin and  the Wonderful Lamp ,  Paul et Virglnie ,  Quentin Durward , and La Dame de Monwreau . Mercedes  made a charming  Diane , Leander  a brilliant and dashing Bussy ;  Monsieur Denis  was cast  for the role of  Fr&#x61672;re Gorenflot  ; and a long, thin, cadaverous-  looking mouse,  Don Quichotte  by name, somewhat inadequately  represented Chicot . We began, as you see, with melodrama ;  presently we descended to light comedy, playing  Les M&#x61673;moires d'un Ane, Jean qui rit , and other works of the immortal  Madame de  S&#x61673;gur . And then at last we turned a new leaf, and became  naturalistic. We had never heard of the naturalist school,  though  Monsieur Zola  had already published some volumes of the Rougon-Macquart  ; but ideas are in the air ; and we, for our  selves, discovered the possibilities of naturalism simultaneously,  as it were, with the acknowledged apostle of that form of art.  We would impersonate the characters of our own world--our  schoolfellows and masters, our parents, servants, friends--and carry  them through experiences and situations derived from our impres-  sions of real life. Perhaps we rather led them a dance ; and I  dare say those we didn't like came in for a good deal of  retributive justice. It was a little universe, of which we were the  arch-arbiters, our will the final law. I don't know whether all children lack humour ; but I'm sure  no grown-up author-manager can take his business more seriously than By Henry Harland 141 than I took mine. Oh, I enjoyed it hugely ; the hours I spent at  it were enraptured hours ; but it was grim, grim earnest. After a  while I began to long for a less subjective public, a more various  audience. I would summon the servants, range them in chairs at  one end of the room, conceal myself behind the theatre, and spout  the play with fervid solemnity. And they would giggle, and make  flippant commentaries, and at my most impassioned climaxes burst  into guffaws. My mice, as has been said, were overfed and  lazy, and I used to have to poke them through their parts with  sticks from the wings ; but this was a detail which a superior  imagination should have accepted as one of the conventions of the  art. It made the servants laugh, however ; and when I would  step to the front in person, and, with tears in my eyes, beseech  them to be sober, they would but laugh the louder.  " Bless you, sir,  they're only mice-- ce ne sont que des souris ,"  the cook called out on one  such occasion. She meant it as an apology and a consolation, but  it was the unkindest cut of all. Only mice, indeed ! To me  they had been a young gentleman and lady lost in the  Desert of  Sahara , near to die for the want of water, and about to be attacked,  captured, and sold into slavery, by a band of Bedouin Arabs. Ah,  well, the artist must steel himself to meet with indifference or  derision from the public, to be ignored, misunderstood, or jeered  at ; and to rely for his real, his legitimate, reward on the pleasure  he finds in his work. And now there befell a great change in my life. Our home in Paris  was broken up, and we moved to St. Petersburg . It was impossible to take my mice with us ; their cage would have hope  lessly complicated our impedimenta. So we gave them to the  children of our concierge,  Mercedes , however, I was resolved I  would not part with, and I carried her all the way to the Russian  capital by hand. In my heart I was looking to her to found another 142 Two Sketches another family she had so frequently become a mother in the  past. But month succeeded month, and she forever disappointed  me, and at last I abandoned hope. In solitude and exile  Mercedes   degenerated sadly ; got monstrously fat ; too indolent to gnaw, let  her teeth grow to a preposterous length ; and in the end died of a  surfeit of  smetana . When I returned to  Paris , at the age of twenty, to faire mon droit   drolt in the  Latin Quarter , I paid a visit to our old house, and discovered the same old concierge in the  loge . I asked her about  the mice, and she told me her children had found the care of them  such a bother that at they had neglected them, and at last  allowed them to escape. "They took to the walls, and for a long  time afterwards, Monsieur, the mice of this neighbourhood were  pied. To this day they are of a paler hue than elsewhere." II--A Broken Looking-Glass H  E  climbed the three flights of stone stairs, and put his key  into the lock ; but before he turned it, he stopped--to rest,  to take breath. On the door his name was painted in big white  letters,  Mr. Richard Dane . It is always silent in the  Temple  at  midnight ; to-night the silence was dense, like a fog. It was  Sunday night ; and on Sunday night, even within the hushed  precincts of the  Temple , one is conscious of a deeper hush. When he had lighted the lamp in his sitting-room, he let him  self drop into an arm-chair before the empty fireplace. He was  tired, he was exhausted. Yet nothing had happened to tire him.  He had dined, as he always dined on Sundays, with the  Rodericks ,  in  Cheyne Walk ; he had driven home in a hansom. There was no By Henry Harland 143 no reason why he should be tired. But he was tired. A deadly  lassitude penetrated his body and his spirit, like a fluid. He was  too tired to go to bed. " I suppose I am getting old,"  he thought. To a second person the matter would have appeared one not of  supposition but of certainty, not of progression but of accomplish  ment. Getting old indeed ? But he  was  old. It was an old man, grey and wrinkled and wasted, who sat there, limp, sunken  upon himself, in his easy-chair. In years, to be sure, he was  under sixty ; but he looked like a man of seventy-five. " I am getting old, I suppose I am getting old." And vaguely, dully, he contemplated his life, spread out behind  him like a misty landscape, and thought what a failure it had been.  What had it come to ? What had it brought him ? What had  he done or won ? Nothing, nothing. It had brought him  nothing but old age, solitude, disappointment, and, to-night  especially, a sense of fatigue and apathy that weighed upon him  like a suffocating blanket. On a table, a yard or two away, stood  a decanter of whisky, with some soda-water bottles and tumblers ;  he looked at it with heavy eyes, and he knew that there was what  he needed. A little whisky would strengthen him, revive him, and make it possible for him to bestir himself and undress and go  to bed. But when he thought of rising and moving to pour the  whisky out, he shrunk from that effort as from an Herculean  labour ; no--he was too tired. Then his mind went back to the  friends he had left in Chelsea  half an hour ago ; it seemed an  indefinably long time ago, years and years ago ; they were like blurred phantoms, dimly remembered from a remote past. Yes, his life had been a failure ; total, miserable, abject. It had  come to nothing ; its harvest was a harvest of ashes, If it had  been a useful life, he could have accepted its unhappiness ; if it The Yellow Book Vol.--I.  I had 144 Two Sketches had been a happy life, he could have forgotten its uselessness ; but  it had been both useless and unhappy. He had done nothing for  others, he had won nothing for himself. Oh, but he had tried,  he had tried. When he had left  Oxford  people expected great  things of him ; he had expected great things of himself. He was  admitted to be clever, to be gifted ; he was ambitious, he was in  earnest. He wished to make a name, he wished to justify his existence by fruitful work. And he had worked hard. He had  put all his knowledge, all his talent, all his energy, into his work ;  he had not spared himself; he had passed laborious days and  studious nights. And what remained to show for it ? Three or  four volumes upon Political Economy, that had been read in their  day a little, discussed a little, and then quite forgotten super  seded by the books of newer men.  " Pulped, pulped,"  he reflected  bitterly. Except for a stray dozen of copies scattered here and  there--in the  British Museum , in his  College library , on his own  bookshelves his published writings had by this time (he could  not doubt) met with the common fate of unsuccessful literature,  and been  " pulped." " Pulped--pulped ; pulped --pulped."  The hateful word beat  rhythmically again and again in his tired brain ; and for a little  while that was all he was conscious of. So much for the work of his life. And for the rest ? The  play ? The living ? Oh, he had nothing to recall but failure.  It had sufficed that he should desire a thing, for him to miss it ;  that he should set his heart upon a thing, for it to be removed  beyond the sphere of his possible acquisition. It had been so  from the beginning ; it had been so always. He sat motionless as  a stone, and allowed his thoughts to drift listlessly hither and  thither in the current of memory. Everywhere they encountered  wreckage, derelicts : defeated aspirations, broken hopes. Languidly ho By Henry Harland 145 he envisaged these He was too tired to resent, to rebel. He  even found a certain sluggish satisfaction in recognising with what  unvarying harshness destiny had treated him, in resigning himself  to the unmerited. He caught sight of his hand, lying flat and inert upon the  brown leather arm of his chair. His eyes rested on it, and for the  moment he forgot everything else in a sort of torpid study of it.  How white it was, how thin, how withered ; the nails were  parched into minute corrugations ; the veins stood out like dark  wires ; the skin hung loosely on it, and had a dry lustre : an old  man's hand. He gazed at it fixedly, till his eyes closed and his  head fell forward. But he was not sleepy, he was only tired and  weak. He raised his head with a start, and changed his position. He  felt cold ; but to endure the cold was easier than to get up, and  put something on, or go to bed. How silent the world was ; how empty his room. An immense  feeling of solitude, of isolation, fell upon him. He was quite cut  off from the rest of humanity here. If anything should happen  to him, if he should need help of any sort, what could he do ?  Call out ? But who would hear ? At nine in the morning the  porter's wife would come with his tea. But if anything should  happen to him in the meantime ? There would be npthing for it  but to wait till nine o clock. Ah, if he had married, if he had had children, a wife, a home or  his own, instead of these desolate bachelor chambers ! If he had married, indeed ! It was his sorrow's crown of sorrow  that he had not married, that he had not been able to marry, that  the girl he had wished to marry wouldn't have him. Failure ?  Success ? He could have accounted failure in other things a trifle,  he could have laughed at what the world calls failure, if  Elinor Lynd 146 Two Sketches Lynd  had been his wife. But that was the heart of his misfortune,  she wouldn't have him. He had met her for the  time when he was a lad of twenty,  and she a girl of eighteen. He could see her palpable before him  now : her slender girlish figure, her bright eyes, her laughing  mouth, her warm brown hair curling round her forehead. Oh,  how he had loved her. For twelve years he had waited upon her,  wooed her, hoped to win her. But she had always said,  " No--I  don't love you. I am very fond of you ; I love you as a friend f  we all love you that way--my mother, my father, my sisters.  But I can't marry you."  However, she married no one else, she  loved no one else ; and for twelve years he was an ever-welcome  guest in her father's house ; and she would talk with him, play to  him, pity him ; and he could hope. Then she died. He called  one day, and they said she was ill. After that there came a blank  in his memory--a gulf, full of blackness and redness, anguish and  confusion ; and then a sort of dreadful sudden calm, when they  told him she was dead. He remembered standing in her room, after the funeral, with  her father, her mother, her sister  Elizabeth . He remembered the  pale daylight that filled it, and how orderly and cold and forsaken  it all looked. And there was her bed, the bed she had died in ;  and there her dressing-table, with her combs and brushes ; and  there her writing-desk, her bookcase. He remembered a row of medicine bottles on the mantelpiece ; he remembered the fierce  anger, the hatred of them, as if they were animate, that had welled  up in his heart as he looked at them, because they had failed to do  their work. " You will wish to have something that was hers,  Richard ,"   her mother said.  " What would you like ? " On her dressing-table there was a small looking-glass in an ivory By Henry Harland 147 ivory frame. He asked if he might have that, and carried it away  with him. She had looked into it a thousand times, no doubt ; she  had done her hair in it ; it had reflected her, enclosed her, contained  her. He could almost persuade himself that something of her  must remain in it. To own it was like owning something of  herself. He carried it home with him, hugging it to his side with  a kind of passion. He had prized it, he prized it still, as his dearest treasure ; the looking-glass in which her face had been reflected a thousand  times ; the glass that had contained her, known her ; in which  something of herself, he felt, must linger. To handle it, look at  it, into it, behind it, was like holding a mystic communion with  her ; it gave him an emotion that was infinitely sweet and bitter,  a pain that was dissolved in joy. The glass lay now, folded in its ivory case, on the chimney-shelf  in front of him. That was its place ; he always kept it on his chimney-shelf, so that he could see it whenever he glanced round  his room. He leaned back in his chair, and looked at it ; for  a long time his eyes remained fixed upon it.  " If she had married  me, she wouldn t have died. My love, my care, would have healed  her. She could not have died."  Monotonously, automatically,  the phrase repeated itself over and over again in his mind, while  his eyes remained fixed on the ivory case into which her looking-  glass was folded. It was an effect of his fatigue, no doubt, that  his eyes, once directed upon an object, were slow to leave it for  another ; that a phrase once pronounced in his thought had this  tendency to repeat itself over and over again. But at last he roused himself a little, and leaning forward, put  his hand out and up, to take the glass from the shelf. He wished  to hold it, to touch it and look into it. As he lifted it towards  him, it fell open, the mirror proper being fastened to a leather back, 148 Two Sketches back, which was glued to the ivory, and formed a hinge. It fell  open ; and his gasp had been insecure ; and the jerk as it opened  was enough. It slipped from his fingers, and dropped with a crash  upon the hearthstone. The sound went through him like a physical pain. He sank  back into his chair, and closed his eyes. His heart was beating as  after a mighty physical exertion. He knew vaguely that a calamity  had befallen him ; he could vaguely imagine the splinters of  shattered glass at his feet. But his physical prostration was so  great as to obliterate, to neutralise, emotion. He felt very cold.  He felt that he was being hurried along with terrible speed through  darkness and cold air. There was the continuous roar of rapid  motion in his ears, a faint, dizzy bewilderment in his head. He  felt that he was trying to catch hold of things, to stop his progress,  but his hands closed upon emptiness ; that he was trying to call  out for help, but he could make no sound. On--on--on, he was  deing whirled through some immeasurable abyss of space. &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; "Ah, yes, he's dead, quite dead,"  the doctor said.  " He has been dead some hours. He must have passed away peacefully  sitting here in his chair." " Poor gentleman,"  said the porter's wife.  " And a broken looking-glass beside him. Oh, it s a sure sign, a broken looking- glass." Portrait of a Lady By   Will Rothenstein Reproduced by the Swan Electric Engraving Company Two Poems By   Edmund Gosse I-- Alere Flammam To A. C. B. I  N  ancient Rome, the secret fire,-- An intimate and holy thing, -- Was guarded by a tender choir Of kindred maidens in a ring; Deep, deep within the house it lay, No stranger ever gazed thereon, But, flickering still by night and day, The beacon of the house, it shone ; Thro birth and death, from age to age, It passed, a quenchless heritage ; And there were hymns of mystic tone Sung round about the family flame, Beyond the threshold all unknown, Fast-welded to an ancient name ; There sacrificed the sire as priest, Before that altar, none but he, Alone 154 Two Poems Alone he spread the solemn feast For a most secret deity ; He knew the god had once been sire, And served the same memorial fire. Ah ! so, untouched by windy roar Of public issues loud and long, The Poet holds the sacred door, And guards the glowing coal of song ; Not his to grasp at praise or blame, Red gold, or crowns beneath the sun, His only pride to tend the flame That Homer and that Virgil won, Retain the rite, preserve the act, And pass the worship on intact. Before the shrine at last he falls ; The crowd rush in, a chattering band But, 'ere he fades in death, he calls Another priest to ward the brand ; He, with a gesture of disdain, Flings back the ringing brazen, gate, Reproves, repressing, the profane, And feeds the flame in primal statt ; Content to toil and fade in turn, If still the sacred embers burn. Far By Edmund Gosse 155 II--A Dream of November F  AR , far away, I know not where, I know not how, The skies are grey, the boughs are bare, bare boughs in flower : Long lilac silk is softly drawn from bough to bough, With flowers of milk and buds of fawn, a broidered shower. Beneath that tent an Empress sits, with slanted eyes, And wafts of scent from censers flit, a lilac flood ; Around her throne bloom peach and plum in lacquered dyes, And many a blown chrysanthemum, and many a bud. She sits and dreams, while bonzes twain strike some rich bell, Whose music seems a metal rain of radiant dye ; In this strange birth of various blooms, I cannot tell Which spring from earth, which slipped from looms, which sank from sky; Beneath her wings of lilac dim, in robes of blue, The Empress sings a wordless hymn that thrills her bower ; My trance unweaves, and winds, and shreds, and forms anew Dark bronze, bright leaves, pure silken threads, in triple flower.

Lucy. Oh ! don't tantalise me. Have you seen it ? What is   it like ! Harold. It is printed, and very much like other books. Lucy. You are horrid. I believe you have it with you. Have  you ? Harold. And what if I say yes ? Lucy. You have. Do let me see it. Harold. And will you be very good if I do ! Lucy. I'll be angelic. Harold. Then on that condition only--There ! take it gently.

There, there, there ! Harold. And there. Lucy. Oh ! don't ! You ll stifle me. And is this for me ;  may I really keep it ? Harold. Of course you may ; I brought it expressly for you. Lucy.

Don't talk nonsense, although it is my fault for beginning  it. And now sit down no, here in the arm-chair and you shall  have some nice tea.

It isn't only that  everybody who has read it, likes it ; it's something else that I can't  describe, not even to you ; a feeling inside, that--call it conceit if  you like, but it isn't conceit ; it isn't conceit to feel confidence in oneself. Why, look at the trash, the arrant trash, that succeeds every day ; you will say, perhaps, that it succeeds because it is trash,  that trash is what people want they certainly get it. But no  book that ever had real stuff in it has failed yet, and I feel  that--Ha ! ha ! the same old feeling mentioned above. Don't  think me an awful prig,  Luce  I don't talk to anybody else  as I do to you ; and if you only knew what a relief it is to me By Fred M. Simpson 163 me to let myself go a bit occasionally, you would excuse every thing. Lucy. You have a right to be conceited. Harold. Not yet. I have done nothing yet ; but I mean to. [ Takes up the book. ]  I wonder what will become of you and  your fellows ; what will be your future ? Will you one day  adorn the shelves of libraries, figure in catalogues of "  Rare books and  editions, " and be contended for by snuffy, long-clothed  bibliomaniacs, who will bid one against the other for the honour of  possessing you ? Or will you descend to the tables of secondhand  book-stalls marked at a great reduction ; or lie in a heap, with  other lumber, outside the shop-front, all this lot sixpence each,  awaiting there, uncared for, unnoticed, and unknown, your ultimate  destination, the dust-hole ? Lucy. You are horrid. What an idea! Harold. No, I don't think that will be your end.  [ Puts down  the book. ]  You are not going to the dustbin, you are going to  be a success. No more hack work for me after this. Why, sup-  posing only the edition is sold, I more than clear expenses,  and if it runs to two--ten--twenty editions, I shall receive--the amount fairly takes my breath away. Twentieth thousand ;  doesn't it sound fine ?

No, not at all. Harold. Then what is it ? Lucy. I was only thinking that--  [ hesitates ]  , Harold. Thinking what ? About me : Lucy. Yes, about you and--and also about myself Harold. That is just as it should be, about us two together. Lucy. Yes, but I was afraid---- Harold. [ Smiling. ] Afraid ! what of? Lucy. Nothing, nothing really. I am ashamed that let me give  you some more tea. Harold. No, thanks. Come, let me hear, make a clean breast  of it. Lucy. I can't, really ; you would only laugh at me. Harold. Then why deny me a pleasure, for you know I love to  laugh ? Lucy. Well, then--if you become famous--and rich---- Harold. If I do ; well ? Lucy. You won 't--you won't forget me, will you ? Harold. Forget you, what an idea ! Why do I want to become  famous ? why do I want to become rich ? For my own sake ?  for the sake of the money ? Neither. I want it for your sake, so  that you can be rich ; so that you can have everything you can  possibly want. I don't mind roughing it a bit myself, but---- Lucy. No more do I : I am sure we might be very happy living  even here. Harold. No, thank you ; no second pair fronts for me, or, rather By Fred M. Simpson 165 rather, none for my wife. I want you to forget all about this  place, as though it had never existed ; I want you to only  remember your giving lessons as a nightmare which has passed  and gone. I want you to take a position in the world, to go into society---- Lucy. But, Harold---- Harold. To entertain, receive, lead---- Lucy. But I could never lead. I detest receiving. I hate entertaining---- Harold. Except me. Lucy. I often wonder if I do. You are so clever and I---- Harold. Such a goose. Whatever put such ideas into your  head ? Why, you are actually crying.

You would like their house,  it's a beauty, a seventeenth or eighteenth century one, with such a 166 The Dedication a gorgeous old staircase. He's awfully rich, and just a little bit vulgar-- "wool"  I think it was, or  "cottons,"  or some other  commodity ; but his daughter is charming--I should say daughters,  as there are two of them, so you needn't be jealous. Lucy. Jealous ? of course I am not. Have you known them long ? Harold. Oh ! some little time. They are awfully keen to see  my book. I am going to take--send them a copy. You see I  must be civil to these people, they know such an awful lot of the  right sort ; and their recommendation of a book will have more  weight than fifty advertisements. So good-bye.  [ Takes his  overcoat. ] Lucy. Let me help you. But you are going without noticing  my flowers. Harold. I have been admiring them all along, except when I  was looking at you. Lucy. Don't be silly. Harold. They are charming.  Sir Humphrey has some orchids  just the same colours ; you ought to see them ; he has basketsful  sent up every week from his place in  Surrey . Lucy. No wonder my poor little chrysanthemums didn't impress  you. Harold. What nonsense ! I would give more for one little  flower from you, than for the contents of all his conservatories. Lucy. Then you shall have that for nothing. Harold. Don't, it will destroy the bunch. Lucy. What does that matter ? they are all yours. Harold. You do your best to spoil me. Lucy.

Would you like it ? Lucy. Above all things, but--but don't spend all your money  on me. Harold. Bother the money ! I am going to be rich. Good  bye till Sunday. Lucy.

I don't want you to do that, and I don't want either to  prevent your enjoying yourself ; but--but, I do want to see you occasionally. Harold. And so you do. Lucy. Yes, very--perhaps I should say I want to see you often. Harold. And so do I you, but I can't be in two places at once.  This is what I mean when I say you are unreasonable. I must  go out. If I am to write, I must study people, character, scenes.  I can't do that by stopping at home : I can't do that by coming  here ; I know you and I know your landlady, and there is nobody  else in the house, except the slavey and the cat ; and although the slavey may be a very excellent servant and the cat a most original  quadruped, still, I don't want to make elaborate studies of animals  --either four-legged or two. One would imagine, from the way  you talk, that I did nothing except enjoy myself. I only go out in  the evenings. Lucy. Still you might spare a little time, now and then, to come  and see me, if only for half an hour. Harold. What am I doing now ? I gave up a dinner-party to  come here to-night. Lucy. Do you know it is exactly a month yesterday since you were here last ? Harold. By Fred M. Simpson 169 Harold. I can't be always dangling at your apron-strings. Lucy. Harold  ! Harold. If we are going to be married, we---- Lucy. If? Harold. Well, when, if you like it better ; we shall see enough  of one another then. I have written to you, it isn't as though I hadn't done that. Lucy. But that is not the same thing as seeing you ; and your letters, too, have been so scrappy.  [ Harold throws himself into the arm-chair. ]  They used to be so different before your book came out. Harold. I had more time then. Lucy. I sometimes wish that it had never been published at all,  that you had never written it, or, at all events, that it had never been such a success. Harold. That's kind, at all events--deuced kind and considerate ! Lucy. It seems to have come between us as a barrier. When I  think how eagerly we looked forward to its appearance, what  castles in the air we built as to how happy we were going to be,  and all the things we were going to do, if it were a success, and  now to think that---- Harold. [ Jumps up. ]  Look here, Lucy, I'm damned if I can't  stand this much longer ! Nag, nag, nag ! I can't stand it. I am  worked off my head during the day, I am out half the night,  and when I come here for a little quiet, a little rest, its--  [ Breaks  off suddenly ] . Lucy. I am so sorry. If I had thought---- Harold. Can't you see that you are driving me mad ? I have  been here half an hour, and the whole of the time it has been  nothing but reproaches. Lucy. I don't think they would hove affected you so much if  you hadn't felt that you deserved them ! Harold. 170 The Dedication Harold. There you go again ! I deserve them--  [ Laughs harshly  ] . It is my fault, I suppose, that it is the season ; it is my fault that  people give dinner-parties and balls ; it is my fault, I suppose, that  you don't go out as much as I do ? Lucy. Certainly not ; although, as a matter of fact, I haven't  been out one single evening for the last three--nearly four--  months. Harold. That's right ; draw comparisons ; say I'm a selfish  brute. You'll tell me next that I am tired of you, and---- Lucy. Harold ! don't, don't you you hurt me! Of course  I never thought of such a-- [ she rises ] --You are not, are you ?   I--I couldn't bear it ! Harold. Of course I am not. Don't be so silly.  [ He sits. ] Lucy. It was silly of me, I confess it. I know you better than  that. Why, it's rank high treason, I deserve to lose my head ; and  my only excuse is that thinking such a thing proves I must have lost it already. Will your majesty deign to pardon ? Harold. [ Testify. ] Yes, yes, that's all right ! There, look out,  you'll crumple my tie. Lucy. I am so sorry ! And now tell me all about your grand  friends and---- Harold. They are not grand to me. Simply because a person  is rich or has a title, I don't consider them any  "grander"  than I --by jove, no ! These people are useful to me, or else I should't  stand it. They  "patronise"  me, put their hand on my shoulder  and say,  "My dear young friend, we predict great things for you."   The fools, as though a single one of them was capable even of  forming an opinion, much less of prophesying. They make  remarks about me before my face ; they talk of, and pet, me as  though I were a poodle. I go through my tricks and they applaud ;  and they lean over with an idiotic simper to the dear friend next to them By Fred M. Simpson 171 them and say,  "Isn't he clever ? "  as though they had taught me  themselves. Bah ! They invite me to their houses, I dine with  them once a week ; but if I were to tell them to-morrow that I  wanted to marry one of their daughters, they would kick me out  of the room, and consider it a greater insult than if the proposal had  come from their own footman. Lucy. But that doesn't matter, because you don't want to marry  one of them, do you ? Was that  Miss Mockton  with you in the  Park last Sunday ? Harold. How do you know I was in the Park at all ? Lucy. Because I saw you there. Harold. You were spying, I suppose. Lucy. Spying ? I don't know what you mean. I went there  for a walk after  Lucy Rimmerton . Harold. Alone ? Lucy. Of course not, I was with  Mrs. Glover Harold. Your landlady ? Lucy. Why not ?--Oh ! you need not be afraid. I shouldn't  have brought disgrace upon you by obliging you to acknowledge  me before your grand friends. I took good care to keep in the background. Harold. Do you mean to insinuate that I am a snob ? Lucy. Be a little kind. Harold. Well, it is your own fault, you insinuate that---- Lucy. I was wrong. I apologise, but--but--  [ begins to cry ] , Harold. There, don't make a scene don't, there's a good girl.  There, rest your head here, I suppose I am nasty. I didn't  mean it, really. You must make allowances for me. I am  worried and bothered. I can't work--at least I can't do work that satisfies me--and altogether I am not quite myself. Late hours  are playing the very deuce with my nerves. There, let me kiss away 172 The Dedication away the tears now give me your promise that you will never be so foolish again. Lucy. I--I promise. It is silly of me--now I am all right. Harold. Giboul&#x00E9;es d'Avril  ! The sun conies out once more,  the shower is quite over. Lucy. Yes, quite over ; you always are so kind. It is my  fault entirely. I--I think my nerves must be a little upset, too. Harold. We shall make a nice couple, sha'n't we ? if we are often  going to behave like this ! Now, are you quite calm ? Lucy. Yes, quite. Harold. That s right, because I want you to listen patiently for  a few minutes to what I am going to say ; it is something I want  to talk to you about very seriously. You won't interrupt me until I have quite finished, will you ? Lucy. What is it ? not that--no, I won't. Harold. You know we talked about--I mean it was arranged  we should be married the beginning of July--wasn't it ? Lucy. Yes. Harold. Well, I want to know if you would mind very much  putting it off a little--quite a little only till--the autumn ? I'll  tell you why. Of course if you  do  mind very much, I sha'n't  press it, but--it's like this : the scene of my new book is, as you know, laid abroad. I have been trying to write it, but can't get  on with it one little bit. I want some local colour. I thought  I should be able to invent it, I find I can't. It is hampering  and keeping me back terribly. And so--and so I thought if  you didn't mind very much that that if I were to go to  France   for--for six months or so--alone, that in fact it would be the making of me. I have never had an opportunity before ; it has always been grind, grind, grind, and if I am prevented from going By Fred M. Simpson 173 going now, I may never have a chance again. What do you  say ? Lucy. But why shouldn't we be married as arranged, and spend  our honeymoon over there ? Harold. Because I want to work. Lucy. And would my being there prevent you ? You used to  say you always worked so much better when I was---- Harold. But you don't understand. This is different. I want  to work hard  and no man could do that on his honeymoon--at  least I know I couldn't. Lucy. No, but--And and till when did you want to put off our--our marriage ? Until your return ? Harold. Well, that would depend on circumstances. You don't  suppose I would postpone it for a second, if I could help it ; but  Until my return ? I hope sincerely that it can be managed  then, but, you see, over there I shall be spending money all the  time, and not earning a  sou , and--and so we  might  have to wait a  little bit longer, just until I could replenish the locker, until I had  published and been paid for my new book. Lucy. But I have given notice to leave at midsummer. Harold. Has  Mrs. Duncan  got another governess ! Lucy. No, but---- Harold. Then you can stop on, can't you ! They will surely  be only too delighted to keep you. Lucy. Yes--I can stop on.  [ He tries to kiss her. ]  No, don't ;  not now. Harold. And you don't really mind the postponement very  much, do you ? Lucy. Not if it will assist you. Harold. I thought you would say that, I knew you would. It  will assist me very much. I shouldn't otherwise suggest it. It does 174 The Dedication does seem too bad though, doesn't it ? To have to postpone it after waiting all these years, and just as it was so near, too. I  have a good mind not to go, after all--only, if I let this chance  slip, I may never have another. Besides, six months is not so  very long, is it ? And when they are over, then we won't wait  any longer. You will come and see me off, won't you ? It would  never do for an engaged man to go away for even six months,  without his lady love coming to see him start. Lucy. Yes, I will come. When do you go ? Harold. The end of next week, I expect ; perhaps earlier if I  can manage it. But I shall see you before then. We'll go and  have dinner together at our favourite little restaurant. When  shall it be ! Let me see, I am engaged on--I can't quite remember  what my engagements are, Lucy. I have none. Harold. Then that's settled. Good-bye,  Luce  ; you don't mind  very much, do you ? The time will soon pass. You are a little  brick to behave as you have done.  [ Going. ]  It will be Monday or  Tuesday next for our dinner, but I will let you know. Good  bye. Lucy. Good-bye. Thirty Years elapse between Scene II. and Scene III. Scene By Fred M. Simpson 175 Scene III -- Lucy Rimmerton  ,  Agnes Rimmerton (her niece) A well-furnished comfortable room in   Lucy Rimmerton 's  house. She is seated in front of the fire, in an easy-chair, reading. The door opens, without her noticing it, and   Agnes   comes in, closes the door gently, crosses the room, and bends over her. Agnes. A happy New Year to you, Aunt  Luce . Lucy. What !  Agnes , is that you ? I never heard you come in.  I really think I must be getting deaf. Agnes. What nonsense ! I didn't intend you should hear me.  I wanted to wish you a happy New Year . Lucy. So as to make your Aunt play second fiddle. The same  to you, dear. Agnes. Thank you.  [ Warms her hands at the fire ]  Oh, it  is   cold ; not here I mean, but out of doors ; the thermometer is  down I don't know how many degrees below freezing Lucy. It seems to agree with you, at all events. You look as  bright and rosy as though you were the New Year itself come to  visit me. Agnes. [ Laughs merrily ]  So I ought to. I ran nearly all the way, except when I slid, to the great horror of an old gentleman  who was busily engaged lecturing some little boys on the enormity  of their sins in making a beautifully long slide in the middle of the  pavement. Lucy. And what brought you out so early ? Agnes. To see you, of course. Besides, the morning is so lovely it 176 The Dedication it seemed a sin to remain indoors. I do hope the frost continues all the holidays. Lucy. It is all very well for you, but it must be terribly trying  for many people--the poor, for instance. Agnes. Yes.  [ A pause. ]  Auntie, you don't know anything, do you, about how how poor people live ? Lucy. Not so much as I ought to. Agnes. I didn't mean very poor people, not working people. I  meant a person poor like--like I am poor. Lucy. [ Smiling ] Don't you know how you live yourself? Agnes. Of course I do, but--I was thinking of--of a friend of  mine, a governess like myself, who has just got engaged ; and I  I was wondering on how much, or, rather, how little, they could  live. But you don't know of course. You are rich, and---- Lucy. But I wasn't always rich. Thirty years ago when I was  your age---- Agnes. When you were my age ! I like that ! why you are  not fifty. Lucy. Little flatterer. Fifty-two last birthday. Agnes. Fifty-two ! Well, you don't look it, at all events. Lucy. Gross flatterer. When I was your age I was poor and a  governess as you are. Agnes. But I thought that your Aunt  Emily  left you all her  money. Lucy. So she did, or nearly all ; but that was afterwards. It  isn't quite thirty years yet since she came back from  India , a  widow, just after she had lost her husband and only child. I was  very ill at the time--I almost died ; and she, good woman as she  was, came and nursed me. Agnes. Of course, I know. I have heard father talk about it.  And then she was taken ill, wasn't she ? Lucy. By Fred M. Simpson 177 Lucy. Yes, almost before I was well. It was very unfair that  she should leave everything to me ; your father was her nephew, just as I was her niece, but he wouldn't hear of my sharing it with---- Agnes. I should think not indeed ! I should be very sorry to  think that my father would ever allow such a thing. Although,  at the same time, it is all very well for you to imagine that you don't share it, but you do. Who pays for  Lillie 's and  May 's and George 's schooling ? Who sent Alfred  to  Cambridge , and  Frank  to---- Lucy. Don't, please. What a huge family you are, to be sure. Agnes. And last, but not least, who gave me a chance of going  to Girton  ? Oh, we are not supposed to know anything about it,  I know, but you see we do. You thought you had arranged it  all so beautifully, and kept every one of us entirely in the dark,  but you haven't one little bit. Lucy. Nonsense, Agnes, you---- Agnes. Oh, you are a huge big fraud, you know you are ; I  am quite ashamed of you. [ Lucy   is going to speak. ] You are  not to be thanked, I know ; and you needn't be afraid, I am not  going to do so ; but if you could only hear us when we are talking quietly together, you would find that a certain person, who shall  be nameless, is simply worship-- Lucy. Hush ! you silly little girl. You don't know what you   are saying. You have nothing to thank me for whatsoever. Agnes. Haven't we just ? I know better. Lucy. Young people always do. So you see I do know some  thing of how "the poor"  live. Agnes. Yes, but you were never married. Lucy. No, dear. Agnes. That is what I want to--Why weren't you married? 178 The Dedication married ? Oh, I know I have no business to ask such a question : it is fearfully rude I know, but I have wondered so often. You are lovely now, and you must have been beautiful when you were a girl. Lucy. No, I wasn't--I was barely pretty. Agnes. I can't believe that. Lucy. And I am not going to accept your description of me  now as a true one ; although I confess I am vain enough--  even in my present old age--to look in the glass occasionally, and say to myself:  "You are better-looking now than you ever were." Agnes. Well, at all events you were always an angel. Lucy. And men don't like angels ; besides--I was poor. Agnes. You were not poor when you got Aunt  Emily 's money, Lucy. No, but then it was too---- I mean I then had no wish to marry. Agnes. You mean you determined to sacrifice yourself for us,  that is what you mean. Lucy. I must have possessed a very prophetic soul then, or  been gifted with second sight, as none of you, except  Reginald ,  were born. But to come back to your friend,  Agnes  ; has she no  money ? Agnes. No, none. Lucy. Nor he ? Agnes. Not a penny. Lucy. And they want to get married ? Agnes. Yes. Lucy. And are afraid they haven't enough. Agnes. They certainly haven't. Lucy. Then why don't they apply to some friend or relative  who has more than enough ; say, to--an aunt, for instance. Agnes By Fred M. Simpson 179 Agnes. Auntie ! Lucy. And what is his name ? Agnes. Geo ---- Mr. Reddell . Lucy. And hers is ? Agnes. Oh, I never intended to tell you. I didn't mean to say  a word. Lucy. When did it happen ? Agnes. Three days ago. That is to say, he proposed to me  then, but of course it has been going on for a long time. I could  see that he at least--I thought I could see. But I can hardly realise it yet. It seems all so strange. And I  did  intend telling  you, I felt I must tell somebody, although  George doesn't want it  known yet, because, as I told you, he--and so I haven't said a word  to father yet ; but I must soon and you won't say anything, will  you ? and--and oh, I am silly. Lucy. There, have your cry out, it will do you good. Now  tell me about  Mr. Reddell . What is he ? Agnes. He is a writer--an author. Don't you remember I  showed you a story of his a little time ago ? Lucy. I thought I knew the name. Agnes. And you said you liked it ; I was so pleased. Lucy. Yes, I did. I thought it clever and---- Agnes. He is clever ; and I do so want you to know him. He   wants to know you, too. You will try to like him, won't you,  for my sake I Lucy. I have no doubt I shall. Agnes. He is just bringing out a book. Some of the stories  have been published before ; the one you read was one, and if that  proves a success then it will be all right ; we shall be able to get married and---- Lucy. Wait a minute, Agnes. How long have you known him ? The Yellow Book Vol.--I.  L Agnes 180 The Dedication Agnes. Over a yea-- nearly two years. Lucy. And do you really know him well ? Are you quite  certain you can trust him ? Agnes. What a question ! How can you doubt it ? You  wouldn't for a minute if you knew him. Lucy. I ought not to, knowing you, you mean. And supposing  this book is a success. May it not spoil him make him con-  ceited ? Agnes. All the better if it does. He is not conceited enough,  and so I always tell him. Lucy. But may it not make him worldly ? May he not, after a  time, regret his proposal to you if he sees a chance of making a  more advantageous---- Agnes. Impossible. What a dreadful opinion you must have of  mankind. You don't think it really, I know. I have never heard  you say or hint anything nasty about anybody before. Lucy. I only do it for your own good, my dear. I once knew  a man--just such another as you describe  Mr. Reddell  to be. He  was an author, too, and--and when I knew him his  book was also just about to appear. He was engaged to be married to  to quite a nice girl too, although she was never so pretty as  you are. Agnes. Who is the flatterer now ? Lucy. The book was published. It was a great success. He  became quite the lion of the season--it is many years ago now.  The wedding-day was definitely fixed. Two months before the  date he suggested a postponement--for six months. Agnes. How horrible ! Lucy. And just about the time originally fixed upon for the  wedding she received a letter from him he was abroad at the time--suggesting that their engagement had better be broken off. Agnes. By Fred M. Simpson 181 Agnes. Oh, the brute ! the big brute ! But she didn't consent,  did she ? Lucy. Of course. The man she had loved was dead. The new  person she was indifferent to. Agnes. But how--but you don't suggest that  Mr. Reddell  could  behave like that ? he couldn't. He wouldn't, I feel certain. But  there must surely have been something else ; I can't believe that  any man would behave so utterly unfeelingly--so brutally. They  say there are always two sides to every story. Mayn't there have been some reason that you knew nothing about ? Mayn't she  have done something ? She must have been a little bit to blame, too, and this side of the story you never heard. Lucy. Yes--it is possible. Agnes. I can't think that any man would deliberately behave so  like a cad as you say he did. Lucy. It may have been her fault. I used to think it might be --just a little, as you say. Agnes. Well, it sha'n't be mine at all events. I won't give  any cause--besides even if I did---- Oh, no, it is utterly  impossible to imagine such a thing ! Lucy. I hope it is, for your sake. Agnes. Of course it is ; of that I am quite certain. And you  don't think it is very wrong of me to--to---- Lucy. To say Yes to a man you love. No, my dear, that can  never be wrong, although it may be foolish. Agnes. From a worldly point of view, perhaps ; but I should  never have thought that you---- Lucy. I didn't mean that. But love seems to grow so quickly  when you once allow it to do so, that it is sometimes wiser to----  but never mind, bring him to see me, and--and may you be  happy.  [ long pause. ] Agnes 182 The Dedication Agnes. You are crying now, Auntie ! You have nothing---- Lucy. Haven't I ? What, not at the chance of losing you ?  So this is what brought you out so early this morning and occa-  sioned your bright, rosy cheeks ? You didn't only come to see  me. Agnes. To see you and talk to you, yes, that was all. No,  by-the-by, it wasn't all. Have you seen a paper this morning ?  No ? I thought it would interest you so I brought it round. It  is bad news, not good news ; your favourite author is dead. Lucy. I am afraid my favourite authors have been dead very  many years. Agnes. I should say the author of your favourite book. Lucy. You mean---- Agnes. Sir Harold Sekbourne .  [Lucy  leans back in her chair. ]   He died last night. Here it is ; here is the paragraph.  [ Reads ] We egret to announce the death of  Sir Harold Sekbourne , the  well-known novelist, which occurred at his town house, in  Prince's  Gate , late last evening."  Shall I read it to you ? Lucy. No no, give me the paper. And and,  Agnes , do you  mind going down to  Franklin 's room, and telling her that receipt  you promised her ? Agnes. For the Japanese custard ? Of course I will ; I quite  forgot all about it. There it is.  [ Gives her the paper, indicating  the paragraph with her finger, then goes out. ] Lucy. [ Sits staring at the paper for a few seconds, then reads  slowly. ] Sir Harold  had been slightly indisposed for some weeks,  but no anxiety was felt until two days ago, when a change for the  worse set in, and despite all the care, attention, and skill of  Drs.  Thornton  and  Douglas , who hardly left his bedside, he never  rallied, and passed peacefully away, at the early age of fifty-eight,  at the time above mentioned. It is now thirty years ago since the deceased By Fred M. Simpson 183 deceased baronet published his  book,  'Grace : a Sketch,'   which had such an immediate and great success. This was followed  nearly a year afterwards by  'Alain Treven,'  the scene of which is  laid in  Brittany  ; and from that time until his death his pen was  never idle. His last work,  'The Incoming Tide' , has just been  published in book form, it having appeared in the pages of  The  Illustrated Courier  during the last year. Despite the rare power  of his later works, disclosing thoroughly, as they do, his scholarly  knowledge, his masterly construction, vivid imagination, and his  keen insight into character and details of every-day life, they none  of them can, for exquisite freshness and rare delicacy of execution,  compare with his  publication,  'Grace : a Sketch.'   We have  before us, as we write, a  edition of this delightful story, with  its curiously sentimental dedication 'To my Lady Luce ,' which in the subsequent editions was omitted. A baronetcy was conferred on  Sir Harold  by her Majesty  two years ago, at the personal insti-  gation, it is said, of the Prime Minister, who is one of his greatest  admirers, but the title is now extinct, as  Sir Harold  leaves no son.  He married in June, 1866 , a daughter of the late  Sir Humphrey   Mockton, who survives him. His two daughters are both mar-  ried one to Lord Duncan , eldest son of the Earl of Andstar  ;  the other to  Sir Reginald de Laver . His loss will be greatly felt,  not only in the literary world, but wherever the English tongue is  spoken and read. [ Lucy goes to the bookcase takes out a book, and opens it Agnes comes in. ] Agnes. Franklin  is silly. I had to repeat the directions three  times, and even now I doubt if she understands them properly. [ Comes behind Lucy and looks over her shoulder. ] Why, I never  knew you had a  edition.  [ Lucy starts and closes the book,  then opens it again. ]  May I look at it ? But this is written ; the 184 The Dedication the ink is quite faded.  To my Lady  Luce .  Harold Sek-  bourne ,  3rd November, 1863.   What a strong handwriting it  is ! Luce ! how strange that the name should be the same as---- [ Looks suddenly at Lucy.]  Oh, Auntie, forgive me. I never dreamt---- I am so sorry. The Head of Minos By   J. T. Nettleship A Lost Masterpiece A City Mood, Aug. '93 By   George Egerton I   REGRET  it, but what am I to do ? It was not my fault--I can  only regret it. It was thus it happened to me. I had come to town straight from a hillside cottage in a lonely  ploughland, with the smell of the turf in my nostrils, and the  swish of the scythes in my ears ; the scythes that flashed in the  meadows where the upland hay, drought-parched, stretched thirstily  up to the clouds that mustered upon the mountain-tops, and  marched mockingly away, and held no rain. The desire to mix with the crowd, to lay my ear once more to  the heart of the world and listen to its life-throbs, had grown too  strong for me ; and so I had come back--but the sights and sounds  of my late life clung to me--it is singular how the most opposite  things often fill one with associative memory. That  gamin  of the bird-tribe, the Cockney sparrow, recalled  the swallows that built in the tumble-down shed ; and I could almost see the gleam of their white bellies, as they circled  in ever narrowing sweeps and clove the air with forked wings,  uttering a shrill note, with a querulous grace-note in front  of it. The 190 A Lost Masterpiece The freshness of the country still lurked in me, unconsciously  influencing my attitude towards the city. One forenoon business drove me citywards, and following an  inclination that always impels me to water-ways rather than road  ways, I elected to go by river steamer. I left home in a glad mood, disposed to view the whole world  with kindly eyes. I was filled with a happy-go-lucky   insouciance    that made walking the pavements a loafing in Elysian fields.  The coarser touches of street-life, the oddities of accent, the  idiosyncrasies of that most eccentric of city-dwellers, the Lon-  doner, did not jar as at other times--rather added a zest to enjoy  ment ; impressions crowded in too quickly to admit of analysis, I  was simply an interested spectator of a varied panorama. I was conscious, too, of a peculiar dual action of brain and  senses, for, though keenly alive to every unimportant detail of the  life about me, I was yet able to follow a process by which delicate  inner threads were being spun into a fanciful web that had nothing  to do with my outer self. At  Chelsea  I boarded a river steamer bound for London Bridge .  The river was wrapped in a delicate grey haze with a golden sub-  tone, like a beautiful bright thought struggling for utterance  through a mist of obscure words. It glowed through the turbid  waters under the arches, so that I feared to see a face or a hand  wave through its dull amber--for I always think of drowned  creatures washing wearily in its murky depths--it lit up the great  warehouses, and warmed the brickwork of the monster chimneys  in the background. No detail escaped my outer eyes not the  hideous green of the velveteen in the sleeves of the woman on my  left, nor the supercilious giggle of the young ladies on my right,  who made audible remarks about my personal appearance. But what cared I ? Was I not happy, absurdly happy ?-- because By George Egerton 191 because all the while my inner eyes saw undercurrents of beauty  and pathos, quaint contrasts, whimsical details that tickled my  sense of humour deliciously. The elf that lurks in some inner  cell was very busy, now throwing out tender mimosa-like threads  of creative fancy, now recording fleeting impressions with delicate  sure brushwork for future use ; touching a hundred vagrant things  with the magic of imagination, making a running comment on  the scenes we passed. The warehouses told a tale of an up-to-date  Soll und Haben , one  of my very own, one that would thrust old Freytag  out of the  book-mart. The tall chimneys ceased to be giraffic throats  belching soot and smoke over the blackening city. They were  obelisks rearing granite heads heavenwards ! Joints in the bricks,  weather-stains ? You are mistaken ; they were hieroglyphics,  setting down for posterity a tragic epic of man the conqueror, and  fire his slave ; and how they strangled beauty in the grip of gain.  A theme for a  Whitman  ! And so it talks and I listen with my inner ear--and yet nothing outward escapes me--the slackening of the boat the stepping on  and off of folk--the lowering of the funnel--the name " Stanley "  on the little tug, with its self-sufficient puff-puff, fussing by with  a line of grimy barges in tow ; freight-laden, for the water  washes over them--and on the last a woman sits suckling her  baby, and a terrier with badly cropped ears yaps at us as we pass.... And as this English river scene flashes by, lines of association  form angles in my brain ; and the point of each is a dot of light  that expands into a background for forgotten canal scenes, with  green-grey water, and leaning balconies, and strange crafts  Cana- letti  and  Guadi  seen long ago in picture galleries A delicate featured youth with gold-laced cap, scrapes a prelude on a thin- 192 A Lost Masterpiece a thin-toned violin, and his companion thrums an accompaniment  on a harp. I don't know what they play, some tuneful thing with an under-  note of sadness and sentiment running through its commonplace--  likely a music-hall ditty ; for a lad with/a cheap silk hat, and the  hateful expression of knowingness that makes him a type of his  kind, grins appreciatively and hums the words. I turn from him to the harp. It is the wreck of a handsome  instrument, its gold is tarnished, its white is smirched, its stucco  rose-wreaths sadly battered. It has the air of an antique beauty  in dirty ball finery ; and is it fancy, or does not a shamed wail lurk  in the tone of its strings ? The whimsical idea occurs to me that it has once belonged to  a lady with drooping ringlets and an embroidered spencer ; and that  she touched its chords to the words of a song by  Thomas Haynes  Baily , and that  Miss La Creevy  transferred them both to ivory. The youth played mechanically, without a trace of emotion ;  whilst the harpist, whose nose is a study in purples and whose  bloodshot eyes have the glassy brightness of drink, felt every touch  of beauty in the poor little tune, and drew it tenderly forth. They added the musical note to my joyous mood ; the poetry of  the city dovetailed harmoniously with country scenes too recent to  be treated as memories--and I stepped off the boat with the melody  vibrating through the city sounds. I swung from place to place in happy, lightsome mood, glad as  a fairy prince in quest of adventures. The air of the city was  exhilarating ether--and all mankind my brethren--in fact I felt  effusively affectionate. I smiled at a pretty anaemic city girl, and only remembered that  she was a stranger when she flashed back an indignant look of  affected affront. But By George Egerton 193 But what cared I ? Not a jot ! I could afford to say  pityingly :  " Go thy way, little city maid, get thee to thy  typing." And all the while that these outward insignificant things occu-  pied me, I knew that a precious little pearl of a thought was  evolving slowly out of the inner chaos. It was such an unique little gem, with the lustre of a tear, and  the light of moonlight and streamlight and love smiles reflected in  its pure sheen--and, best of all, it was all my own--a priceless possession, not to be bartered for the Jagersfontein diamond--a  city childling with the prepotency of the country working in it--  and I revelled in its fresh charm and dainty strength ; it seemed  original, it was so frankly natural. And as I dodged through the great waggons laden with wares  from outer continents, I listened and watched it forming inside,  until my soul became filled with the light of its brightness ; and a  wild elation possessed me at the thought of this darling brain-child,  this offspring of my fancy, this rare little creation, perhaps embryo  of genius that was my very own. I smiled benevolently at the passers-by, with their harassed  business faces, and shiny black bags bulging with the weight of  common every-day documents, as I thought of the treat I would  give them later on ; the delicate feast I held in store for them,  when I would transfer this dainty elusive birthling of my brain to  paper for their benefit. It would make them dream of moonlit lanes and sweethearting ;  reveal to them the golden threads in the sober city woof; creep  in close and whisper good cheer, and smooth out tired creases  in heart and brain ; a draught from the fountain of  Jouvence   could work no greater miracle than the tale I had to unfold.  Aye, they might pass me by now, not even give me the inside of 194 A Lost Masterpiece of the pavement, I would not blame them for it !--but later on,  later on, they would flock to thank me. They just didn't realise,  poor money-grubbers ! How could they ? But later on . . .   I grew perfectly radiant at the thought of what I would do for  poor humanity, and absurdly self-satisfied as the conviction grew  upon me that this would prove a work of genius no mere  glimmer of the spiritual afflatus--but a solid chunk of genius. Meanwhile I took a bus and paid my penny. I leant back  and chuckled to myself as each fresh thought-atom added to the  precious quality of my pearl. Pearl ? Not one any longer--a  whole quarrelet of pearls, Oriental pearls of the greatest price!   Ah, how happy I was as I fondled my conceit ! It was near  Chancery Lane  that a foreign element cropped up  and disturbed the rich flow of my fancy. I happened to glance at the side-walk. A woman, a little woman,  was hurrying along in a most remarkable way. It annoyed me,  for I could not help wondering why she was in such a desperate  hurry. Bother the jade ! what business had she to thrust herself  on my observation like that, and tangle the threads of a web of  genius, undoubted genius ? I closed my eyes to avoid seeing her ; I could see her through  the lids. She had square shoulders and a high bust, and a white  gauze tie, like a snowy feather in the breast of a pouter pigeon. We stop--I look again--aye, there she is ! Her black eyes  stare boldly through her kohol-tinted lids, her face has a violet  tint. She grips her gloves in one hand, her white-handled umbrella  in the other, handle up, like a knobkerrie. She has great feet, too, in pointed shoes, and the heels are under  her insteps ; and as we outdistance her I fancy I can hear their  decisive tap-tap above the thousand sounds of the street. I breathe a sigh of relief as I return to my pearl--my pearl that By George Egerton 195 that is to bring mt kudos and make countless thousands rejoice.  It is dimmed a little, I must nurse it tenderly. Jerk, jerk, jangle--stop.--Bother the bell ! We pull up to  drop some passengers, the idiots ! and, as I live, she overtakes us !  How the men and women cede her the middle of the pavement !  How her figure dominates it, and her great feet emphasise her  ridiculous haste ! Why should she disturb me ? My nerves are  quivering pitifully ; the sweet inner light is waning, I am in  mortal dread of losing my little masterpiece. Thank heaven, we  are off again.... "  Charing Cross ,  Army and Navy ,  V'toria !" --Stop ! Of course, naturally! Here she comes, elbows out, umbrella  waning ! How the steel in her bonnet glistens ! She recalls  something, what is it ?--what is it ? A-ah ! I have it !--a strident  voice, on the deck of a steamer in the glorious  bay of Rio ,  singing : " Je suis le vr-r-rai pompier,  Le seul pompier . . . ." and  la milla  snaps her fingers gaily and trills her  r's  s ; and the  Corcovado is outlined clearly on the purple background as if bending to listen ; and the palms and the mosque-like buildings,  and the fair islets bathed in the witchery of moonlight, and the  star-gems twinned in the lap of the bay, intoxicate as a dream of  the East. " Je suis le vr-r-rai pompier,  Le seul pompier . . . ." What in the world is a  pompier  ? What connection has the  word with this creature who is murdering, deliberately murdering,  a delicate creation of my brain, begotten by the fusion of country  and town ? "Je suis le vr-r-rai pompier, . . . ." I am 196 A Lost Masterpiece I am convinced  pompier  expresses her in some subtle way--  absurd word ! I look back at her, I criticise her, I anathematise  her, I  hate  her ! What is she hurrying for ? We can't escape her always we  stop and let her overtake us with her elbowing gait, and tight skirt  shortened to show her great splay feet--ugh ! My brain is void, all is dark within ; the flowers are faded, the  music stilled ; the lovely illusive little being has flown, and yet she  pounds along untiringly. Is she a feminine presentment of the wandering Jew, a living  embodiment of the ghoul-like spirit that haunts the city and  murders fancy ? What business had she, I ask, to come and thrust her white-  handled umbrella into the delicate net work of my nerves and untune  their harmony ? Does she realise what she has done ? She has trampled a rare  little mind-being unto death, destroyed a precious literary gem.  Aye, one that, for aught I know, might have worked a revolution  in modern thought ; added a new human document to the archives  of man ; been the keystone to psychic investigations ; solved  problems that lurk in the depths of our natures and tantalise us  with elusive gleams of truth ; heralded in, perchance, the new era ;  when such simple problems as Home Rule, Bimetallism, or the Woman Question will be mere themes for schoolboard composi- tions--who can tell ? Well, it was not my fault. No one regrets it more, no one  --but what could I do ? Blame her, woman of the great feet and dominating gait, and  waving umbrella-handle !--blame her ! I can only regret it--  regret it ! Portrait of a Lady By   Charles W. Furse Reproduced by the Swan Electric Engraving Company The Yellow Book Vol.--I.  M Reticence in Literature By   Arthur Waugh H  E  never spoke out.  Upon these four words, gathered by  chance from a private letter,  Matthew Arnold , with that  super-subtle ingenuity which loved to take the word and play upon it and make it of innumerable colours, has constructed, as one may conjecture some antediluvian wonder from its smallest fragment, a  full, complete, and intimate picture of the poet  Thomas Gray .  He  never spoke out . Here, we are told, lies the secret of  Gray 's limita-  tion as much in life as in literature : so sensitive was he in private  life, so modest in public, that the thoughts that arose in him never  got full utterance, the possibilities of his genius were never ful-  filled ; and we, in our turn, are left the poorer for that nervous  delicacy which has proved the bane of the poet, living and dead  alike. It is a singularly characteristic essay--this paper on  Gray , showing the writer's logical talent at once in its strongest and  its weakest capacities, and a complete study of  Arnold 's method  might well, I think, be founded upon its thirty pages. But in the  present instance I have recurred to that recurring phrase,  He never  spoke out , not to discuss  Matthew Arnold 's estimate of Gray , nor,  indeed, to consider Gray 's relation to his age ; but merely to point  out, what the turn of  Arnold 's argument did not require him to  consider, namely, the extraordinarily un-English aspect of this reticence 202 Reticence in Literature reticence in  Gray , a reticence alien without doubt to the English  character, but still more alien to English literature. Reticence is  not a national characteristic--far otherwise. The phrase "  national  characteristic " is, I know well, a cant phrase, and, as such, full of  the dangers of abuse. Historical and ethnographical criticism,  proceeding on popular lines, has tried from time to time to fix  certain tendencies to certain races, and to argue from individuals  to generalities with a freedom that every law of induction belies.  And so we have come to endow the Frenchman, universally and  without exception, with politeness, the Indian, equally univer- sally, with cunning, the American with the commercial talent, the  German with the educational, and so forth. Generalisations of  this kind must, of course, be accepted with limitations. But it is  not too much, perhaps, to say that the Englishman has always  prided himself upon his frankness. He is always for speaking out ;  and it is this faculty of outspokenness that he is anxious to  attribute to those characters which he sets up in the market-places  of his religion and his literature, as those whom he chiefly delights  to honour. The demigods of our national verse, the heroes of our  national fiction, are brow-bound, above all other laurels, with this  glorious freedom of free speech and open manners, and we have come to regard this broad, untrammelled virtue of ours, as all  individual virtues will be regarded with the revolution of the cycle  of provinciality, as a guerdon above question or control. We have  become inclined to forget that every good thing has, as  Aristotle   pointed out so long ago, its corresponding evil, and that the cor  ruption of the best is always worst of all. Frankness is so great a  boon, we say : we can forgive anything to the man who has the courage of his convictions, the feailessness of freedom--the man,  in a word, who speaks out. But we have to distinguish, I think, at the outset between a national By Arthur Waugh 203 national virtue in the rough and the artificial or acquired fashion  in which we put that virtue into use. It is obvious that, though  many things are possible to us, which are good in themselves,  many things are inexpedient, when considered relatively to our  environment.  Count Tolstoi  may preach his gospel of non-  resistance till the beauty of his holiness seems almost  Christ -like ;  but every man who goes forth to his work and to his labour  knows that the habitual turning of the right cheek to the smiter  of the left, the universal gift of the cloak to the beggar of our coat,  is subversive of all political economy, and no slight incentive to  immorality as well. In the same way, it will be clear, that this  national virtue of ours, this wholesome, sincere outspokenness, is  only possible within certain limits, set by custom and expediency, and it is probably a fact that there was nevera truly wise man yet  but tempered his natural freedom of speech by an acquired habit  of reticence. The man who never speaks out may be morose ;  the man who is always speaking out is a most undesirable  acquaintance. Now, I suppose every one is prepared to admit with  Matthew  Arnold  that the literature of an age (we are not now speaking of  poetry alone, be it understood, but of literature as a whole), that  this literature must, in so far as it is truly representative of,  and therefore truly valuable to, the time in which it is produced, reflect and criticise the manners, tastes, development, the life, in  fact, of the age for whose service it was devised. We have, of  course, critical literature probing the past : we have philosophical  literature prophesying the future ; but the truly representative  literature of every age is the creative, which shows its people its  natural face in a glass, and leaves to posterity the record of the  manner of man it found. In one sense, indeed, creative literature  must inevitably be critical as well, critical in that it employs the double 204 Reticence in Literature double methods of analysis and synthesis, dissecting motives and  tendencies , and then from this examination building up a  type, a sample of the representative man and woman of its epoch.  The truest fiction of any given century, yes, and the truest poetry,  too (though the impressionist may deny it), must be a criticism  of life, must reflect its surroundings. Men pass, and fashions  change ; but in the literature of their day their characters, their  tendencies, remain crystallised for all time : and what we know of  the  England  of  Chaucer  and  Shakespeare , we know wholly and  absolutely in the truly representative, truly creative, because truly  critical literature which they have left to those that come after. It is, then, the privilege, it is more, it is the duty of the man of  letters to speak out, to be fearless, to be frank, to give no ear to  the puritans of his hour, to have no care for the objections of  prudery ; the life that he lives is the life he must depict, if his work  is to be of any lasting value. He must be frank, but he must be  something more. He must remember--hourly and momently he  must remember--that his virtue, step by step, inch by inch, im-  perceptibly melts into the vice which stands at its pole ; and that  (to employ Aristotelian phraseology for the moment) there is a  sort of middle point, a centre of equilibrium, to pass which is to  disturb and overset the entire fabric of his labours. Midway  between liberty and license, in literature as in morals, stands the  pivot of good taste, the centre-point of art. The natural inclina- tion of frankness, the inclination of the virtue in the rough, is to blunder on resolutely with an indomitable and damning sincerity,  till all is said that can be said, and art is lost in photography.  The inclination of frankness, restrained by and tutored to the  limitations of art and beauty, is to speak so much as is in accord  ance with the moral idea : and then, at the point where ideas melt  into mere report, mere journalistic detail, to feel intuitively the restraining, By Arthur Waugh 205 restraining, the saving influence of reticence. In every age there  has been some point fits exact position has varied, it is true, but  the point has always been there) at which speech stopped short ;  and the literature which has most faithfully reflected the manners  of that age, the literature, in fine, which has survived its little  hour of popularity, and has lived and is still living, has inevitably,  invariably, and without exception been the literature which stayed  its hand and voice at the point at which the taste of the age, the  age s conception of art, set up its statue of reticence, with her  finger to her lips, and the inscription about her feet : " So far shall  thou go, and no further. " We have now, it seems, arrived at one consideration, which  must always limit the liberty of frankness, namely, the standard of  contemporary taste. The modesty that hesitates to allign itself  with that standard is a shortcoming, the audacity that rushes  beyond is a violence to the unchanging law of literature. But  the single consideration is insufficient. If we are content with  the criterion of contemporary taste alone, our standard of judg-  ment becomes purely historical : we are left, so to speak, with a  sliding scale which readjusts itself to every new epoch : we have  no permanent and universal test to apply to the literature of different ages : in a word, comparative criticism is impossible.  We feel at once that we need, besides the shifting standard of  contemporary taste, some fixed unit of judgment that never  varies, some foot-rule that applies with equal infallibility to the  literature of early  Greece  and to the literature of later  France  ;  and such an unit, such a foot-rule, can only be found in the final  test of all art, the necessity of the moral idea. We must, in  distinguishing the thing that may be said fairly and artistically  from the thing whose utterance is inadmissible, we must in such  a decision control our judgment by two standards--the one, the shifting 206 Reticence in Literature shifting standard of contemporary taste : the other, the permanent  standard of artistic justification, the presence of the moral idea,  With these two elements in action, we ought, I think, to be able  to estimate with tolerable fairness the amount of reticence in any  age which ceases to be a shortcoming, the amount of frankness  which begins to be a violence in the literature of the period. We  ought, with these two elements in motion, to be able to employ a  scheme of comparative criticism which will prevent us from  encouraging that retarding and dangerous doctrine that what was expedient and justifiable, for instance, in the dramatists of the Restoration is expedient and justifiable in the playwrights of our  own Victorian era ; we ought, too, to be able to arrive in  stinctively at a sense of the limits of art, and to appreciate the  point at which frankness becomes a violence, in that it has de-  generated into mere brawling, animated neither by purpose nor  idea. Let us, then, consider these two standards of taste and art  separately : and , let us give a brief attention to the contem-  porary standard. We may, I think, take it as a rough working axiom that  the point of reticence in literature, judged by a contemporary  standard, should be settled by the point of reticence in the  conversation of the taste and culture of the age. Literature is,  after all, simply the ordered, careful exposition of the thought  of its period, seeking the best matter of the time, and setting it  forth in the best possible manner ; and it is surely clear that what  is written in excess of what is spoken (in excess I mean on the  side of license) is a violence to, a misrepresentation of, the period  to whose service the literature is devoted. The course of the highest thought of the time should be the course of its literature,  the limit of the most delicate taste of the time the limit of literary expression : whatever falls below that standard is a shortcoming, whatever By Arthur Waugh 207 whatever exceeds it a violence. Obviously the standard varies  immensely with the period. It would be tedious, nor is it  necessary to our purpose, to make a long historical research into the  development of taste ; but a few striking examples may help us to  appreciate its variations. To begin with a very early stage of literature, we find among  the Heracleidae of  Herodotus  a stage of contemporary taste which  is the result of pure brutality. It is clear that literature adjusted  to the frankness of the uxorious pleasantries of Candaules  and Gyges  would justifiably assume a degree of license which, reason  able enough in its environment, would be absolutely impossible,  directly the influences of civilisation began to make themselves  felt. The age is one of unrestrained brutality, and the literature  which represented it would, without violence to the contemporary  taste, be brutal too. To pass at a bound to the  Rome  of  Juvenal   is again to be transported to an age of national sensuality : the  escapades of  Messalina  are the inevitable outcome of a national  taste that is swamped and left putrescent by limitless self-  indulgence ; and the literature which represented this taste would,  without violence, be lascivious and polluted to its depth. In con-  tinuing, with a still wider sweep, to the  England  of  Shakespeare ,  we find a new development of taste altogether. Brutality is  softened, licentiousness is restrained, immorality no longer stalks  abroad shouting its coarse phrases at every wayfarer who passes  the  Mermaid  or the  Globe . But, even among types of purity,  reticence is little known. The innuendoes are whispered under the breath, but when once the voice is lowered, it matters little  what is said.  Rosalind  and  Celia  enjoy their little  doubles entendres   together.  Hero 's wedding morning is an occasion for delicate  hints of experiences to come. Hamlet plies the coarsest sugges-  tions upon  Ophelia  in the intervals of a theatrical performance. The 208 Reticence in Literature The language reflects the taste : we feel no violence here. To  take but one more instance, let us end with  Sheridan . By his  time speech had been refined by sentiment, and the most graceful  compliments glide, without effort, from the lips of the adept  courtier. But even still, in the drawing-rooms of fashion, delicate  morsels of scandal are discussed by his fine ladies with a freedom  which is absolutely unknown to the  Mayfair  of the last half-  century, where innuendo might be conveyed by the eye and  suggested by the smile, but would never, so reticent has taste  become, find the frank emphatic utterance which brought no  blush to the cheek of  Mrs. Candour and  Lady Sneerwell . In the  passage of time reticence has become more and more pronounced ;  and literature, moving, as it must, with the age, has assumed in its  normal and wholesome form the degree of silence which it finds  about it. The standard of taste in literature, then, so far as it responds to contemporary judgment, should be regulated by the normal taste of  the hale and cultured man of its age : it should steer a middle  course between the prudery of the manse, which is for hiding  everything vital, and the effrontery of the pot-house, which makes  for ribaldry and bawdry ; and the more it approximates to the  exact equilibrium of its period, the more thoroughly does it become  representative of the best taste of its time, the more certain is it of  permanent recognition. The literature of shortcoming and the  literature of violence have their reward : "  They have their day, and cease to be  " ; the literature which reflects the hale and wholesome frankness of  its age can be read, with pleasure and profit, long after its openness  of speech and outlook has ceased to reproduce the surrounding life. The By Arthur Waugh 209 The environment is ephemeral, but the literature is immortal.  But why is the literature immortal ? Why is it that a play like Pericles  , for instance, full as it is of scenes which revolt the moral  taste, has lived and is a classic forever, while innumerable con-  temporary pieces of no less genius (for Pericles   is no masterpiece)  have passed into oblivion ? Why is it that the impurity of Pericles  strikes the reader scarcely at all, while the memory dwells  upon its beauties and forgets its foulness in recollection of its  refinement ? The reason is not far to seek.   Pericles   is not only  free of offence when judged by the taste of its age, it is no less  blameless when we subject it to the test by which all literature is  judged at last ; it conforms to the standard of artit is permeated  by the moral idea. The standard of art--the presence of the  idea--the two expressions are, I believe, synonymous. It is easy  enough to babble of the beauty of things considered apart from  their meaning, it is easy enough to dilate on the satisfaction of art  in itself, but all these phrases are merely collocations of terms,  empty and meaningless. A thing can only be artistic by virtue of  the idea it suggests to us ; when the idea is coarse, ungainly , unspeakable, the object that suggests it is coarse, ungainly,  unspeakable ; art and ethics must always be allied in that the  merit of the art is dependent on the merit of the idea it prompts. Perhaps I shall show my meaning more clearly by an example  from the more tangible art of painting ; and let me take as an  instance an artist who has produced pictures at once the most  revolting and most moral of any in the history of English art.  I mean  Hogarth . We are all familiar with his coarsenesses ; all these have we known from our youth up. But it is only the  schoolboy who searches the  Bible  for its indecent passages ; when  we are become men, we put away such childish satisfactions. Then 210 Reticence in Literature Then we begin to appreciate the idea which underlies the subject :  we feel that  Hogarth -- "  Whose pictured morals charm the mind, And through the eye correct the heart "-- was, even in his grossest moments, profoundly moral, entirely sane, because he never dallied lasciviously with his subject,  because he did not put forth vice with the pleasing semblance of  virtue, because, like all hale and wholesome critics of life, he  condemned excess, and pictured it merely to portray the worth-  lessness, the weariness, the dissatisfaction of lust and license.  Art, we say, claims every subject for her own ; life is open to her  ken ; she may fairly gather her subjects where she will. Most  true. But there is all the difference in the world between  drawing life as we find it, sternly and relentlessly, surveying it all  the while from outside with the calm, unflinching gaze of criticism, and, on the other hand, yielding ourselves to the warmth  and colour of its excesses, losing our judgment in the ecstasies of  the joy of life, becoming, in a word, effeminate. The man lives by ideas ; the woman by sensations ; and while  the man remains an artist so long as he holds true to his own view  of life, the woman becomes one as soon as she throws off the  habit of her sex, and learns to rely upon her judgment, and not  upon her senses. It is only when we regard life with the un-  trammelled view of the impartial spectator, when we pierce below  the substance for its animating idea, that we approximate to the  artistic temperament. It is unmanly, it is effeminate, it is in artistic to gloat over pleasure, to revel in immoderation, to become passion's slave ; and literature demands as much calmness of  judgment, as much reticence, as life itself. The man who loses reticence By Arthur Waugh 211 reticence loses self-respect, and the man who has no respect for  himself will scarcely find others to venerate him. After all, the  world generally takes us at our own valuation. We have now, I trust, arrived (though, it may be, by a rather  circuitous journey) at something like a definite and reasonable law  for the exercise of reticence ; it only remains to consider by what  test we shall most easily discover the presence or absence of the  animating moral idea which we have found indispensable to art.  It seems to me that three questions will generally suffice. Does  the work, we should ask ourselves, make for that standard of taste  which is normal to wholesomeness and sanity of judgment ?  Does it, or does it not, encourage us to such a line of life as is  recommended, all question of tenet and creed apart, by the experience of the age, as the life best calculated to promote  individual and general good ? And does it encourage to this life  in language and by example so chosen as not to offend the  susceptibilities of that ordinarily strong and unaffected taste which,  after all, varies very little with the changes of the period and  development ? When creative literature satisfies these three  requirements--when it is sane, equable, and well spoken, then it  is safe to say it conforms to the moral idea, and is consonant with  art. By its sanity it eludes the risk of effeminate demonstration ;  by its choice of language it avoids brutality ; and between these two poles, it may be affirmed without fear of question, true taste  will and must be found to lie. These general considerations, already too far prolonged, become  of immediate interest to us as soon as we attempt to apply them to  theliterature of our own half-century, and I propose concluding what  I wished to say on the necessity of reticence by considering, briefly  and without mention of names, that realistic movement in English  literature which, under different titles, and protected by the aegis of variou {sic} 212 Reticence in Literature various schools, has proved, without doubt, the most interesting and suggestive development in the poetry and fiction of our time.  During the last quarter of a century, more particularly, the  English man-of-letters has been indulging, with an entirely new  freedom, his national birthright of outspokenness, and during the  last twelve months there have been no uncertain indications that  this freedom of speech is degenerating into license which some of  us cannot but view with regret and apprehension. The writers  and the critics of contemporary literature have, it would seem,  alike lost their heads ; they have gone out into the byways and hedges in search of the new thing, and have brought into the  study and subjected to the microscope mean objects of the road  side, whose analysis may be of value to science but is absolutely  foreign to art. The age of brutality, pure and simple, is dead  with us, it is true ; but the age of effeminacy appears, if one is to  judge by recent evidence, to be growing to its dawn. The day  that follows will, if it fulfils the promise of its morning, be very  serious and very detrimental to our future literature. Every great productive period of literature has been the result of  some internal or external revulsion of feeling, some current of  ideas. This is a commonplace. The greatest periods of produc-  tion have been those when the national mind has been directed  to some vast movement of emancipation the discovery of new  countries, the defeat of old enemies, the opening of fresh possi-  bilities. Literature is best stimulated by stirrings like these. Now,  the last quarter of a century in English history has been singularly  sterile of important improvements. There has been no very inspiring  acquisition to territory or to knowledge : there has been, in con-  sequence, no marked influx of new ideas. The mind has been  thrown back upon itself ; lacking stimulus without, it has sought  inspiration within, and the most characteristic literature of the time By Arthur Waugh 213 time has been introspective. Following one course, it has  betaken itself to that intimately analytical fiction which we  associate primarily with America  ; it has sifted motives and probed  psychology, with the result that it has proved an exceedingly clever, exact, and scientific, but scarcely stimulating, or progressive school of literature. Following another course, it has sought for subject-matter in the discussion of passions and sensations, common, doubtless, to every age of mankind, interesting and necessary, too,  in their way, but passions and sensations hitherto dissociated with literature, hitherto, perhaps, scarcely realised to their depth and intensity. It is in this development that the new school of realism  has gone furthest ; and it is in this direction that the literature of  the future seems likely to follow. It is, therefore, not without  value to consider for a moment whither this new frankness is  leading us, and how far its freedom is reconciled to that standard  of necessary reticence which I have tried to indicate in these pages.  This present tendency to literary frankness had its origin, I  think, no less than twenty-eight years ago. It was then that the  dovecotes of English taste were tremulously fluttered by the  coming of a new poet, whose naked outspokenness startled his readers into indignation. Literature, which had retrograded into  a melancholy sameness, found itself convulsed by a sudden access  of passion, which was probably without parallel since the age of  the silver poets of Rome . This new singer scrupled not to revel  in sensations which for years had remained unmentioned upon the printed page ; he even chose for his subjects refinements of lust,  which the commonly healthy Englishman believed to have become  extinct with the time of  Juvenal . Here was an innovation which  was absolutely alien to the standard of contemporary taste--an  innovation, I believe, that was equally opposed to that final  moderation without which literature is lifeless. Let 214 Reticence in Literature Let us listen for one moment: " By the ravenous teeth that have smitten Through the kisses that blossom and bud, By the lips intertwisted and bitten Till the foam has a savour of blood, By the pulse as it rises and falters, By the hands as they slacken and strain, I adjure thee, respond from thine altars, Our Lady of Pain . As of old when the world s heart was lighter, Through thy garments the grace of thee glows, The white wealth of thy body made whiter By the blushes of amorous blows, And seamed with sharp lips and fierce fingers, And branded by kisses that bruise ; When all shall be gone that now lingers, Ah, what shall we lose I Thou wert fair in thy fearless old fashion, And thy limbs are as melodies yet, And move to the music of passion With lithe and lascivious regret. What ailed us, O gods, to desert you For creeds that refuse and restrain ; Come down and redeem us from virtue, Our Lady of Pain ." This was twenty-eight years ago ; and still the poetry lives. At   sight it would seem asthough the desirable reticence,upon which   we have been insisting, were as yet unnecessary to immortality.  A quarter of a century has passed, it might be argued, and the verse By Arthur Waugh 215 verse is as fresh to-day and as widely recognised as it was in its  morning : is not this a proof that art asks for no moderation ? I  believe not. It is true that the poetry lives, that we all recognise,  at some period of our lives, the grasp and tenacity of its influence;  that, even when the days come in which we say we have no  pleasure in it, we still turn to it at times for something we do not  find elsewhere. But the thing we seek is not the matter, but the  manner. The poetry is living, not by reason of its unrestrained  frankness, but in spite of it, for the sake of something else. That  sweet singer who charmed and shocked the audiences of 1866 ,  charms us, if he shocks us not now, by virtue of the one new  thing that he imported into English poetry, the unique and as yet  imperishable faculty of musical possibilities hitherto unattained. There is no such music in all the range of English verse, seek  where you will, as there is in him. But the perfection of the one  talent, its care, its elaboration, have resulted in a corresponding  decay of those other faculties by which alone, in the long run,  poetry can live. Open him where you will, there is in his poetry  neither construction nor proportion ; no development, no sustained  dramatic power. Open him where you will, you acquire as much  sense of his meaning and purpose from any two isolated stanzas  as from the study of a whole poem. There remains in your ears, when you have ceased from reading, the echo only of a beautiful  voice, chanting, as it were, the melodies of some outland tongue. Is this the sort of poetry that will survive the trouble of the  ages ? It cannot survive. The time will come (it must) when  some newer singer discovers melodies as yet unknown, melodies  which surpass in their modulations and varieties those poems  and ballads of twenty-eight years ago ; and, when we have found  the new note, what will be left of the earlier singer, to which we  shall of necessity return ? A message ? No. Philosophy ? No, The Yellow Book Vol.--I.  N A new 216 Reticence in Literature A new vision of life ? No. A criticism of contemporary existence ?  Assuredly not. There remains the melody alone ; and this, when  once it is surpassed, will charm us little enough. We shall forget  it then. Art brings in her revenges, and this will be of them. But the new movement did not stop here. If, in the poet we  have been discussing, we have found the voice among us that  corresponds to the decadent voices of the failing Roman Republic,  there has reached us from France  another utterance, which I should be inclined to liken to the outspoken brutality of Restora-  tion drama. Taste no longer fails on the ground of a delicate,  weakly dalliance, it begins to see its own limitations, and springs  to the opposite pole. It will now be virile, full of the sap of life,  strong, robust, and muscular. It will hurry us out into the fields,  will show us the coarser passions of the common farm-hand ; at  any expense it will paint the life it finds around it ; it will at least  be consonant with that standard of want of taste which it falsely  believes to be contemporary. We get a realistic fiction abroad,  and we begin to copy it at home. We will trace the life of the  travelling actor, follow him into the vulgar, sordid surroundings which he chooses for the palace of his love, be it a pottery-shed or  the ill-furnished lodging-room with its black horsehair sofa--we  will draw them all, and be faithful to the lives we live. Is that  the sort of literature that will survive the trouble of the ages ? It  cannot survive. We are no longer untrue to our time, perhaps, if  we are to seek for the heart of that time in the lowest and meanest  of its representatives ; but we are untrue to art, untrue to the  record of our literary past, when we are content to turn for our own  inspiration to anything but the best line of thought, the highest  school of life, through which we are moving. This grosser  realism is no more representative of its time than were the elaborate pastiches of classical degradation ; it is as though one should By Arthur Waugh 217 should repeople  Eden  with creatures imagined from a study of the  serpent s head. In the history of literature this movement, too,  will with the lapse of time pass unrecognised ; it has mourned  unceasingly to an age which did not lack for innocent piping and  dancing in its market-places. The two developments of realism of which we have been  speaking seem to me to typify the two excesses into which frank  ness is inclined to fall ; on the one hand, the excess prompted by  effeminacy--that is to say, by the want of restraints which starts  from enervated sensation ; and on the other, the excess which  results from a certain brutal virility, which proceeds from coarse  familiarity with indulgence. The one whispers, the other shouts ;  the one is the language of the courtesan, the other of the bargee.  What we miss in both alike is that true frankness which springs  from the artistic and moral temperament ; the episodes are no part  of a whole in unity with itself; the impression they leave upon the reader is not the impression of  Hogarth 's pictures ; in one  form they employ all their art to render vice attractive, in the  other, with absolutely no art at all, they merely reproduce, with  the fidelity of the kodak, scenes and situations the existence of  which we all acknowledge, while taste prefers to forget them. But the latest development of literary frankness is, I think, the  most insidious and fraught with the greatest danger to art. A  new school has arisen which combines the characteristics of  effeminacy and brutality. In its effeminate aspect it plays with  the subtler emotions of sensual pleasure, on its brutal side it has  developed into that class of fiction which for want of a better word  I must call chirurgical. In poetry it deals with very much the   same passions as those which we have traced in the verse to which  allusion has been made above ; but, instead of leaving these refine  ments of lust to the haunts to which they are fitted, it has intro- duced 218 Reticence in Literature duced them into the domestic chamber, and permeated marriage  with the ardours of promiscuous intercourse. In fiction it infects  its heroines with acquired diseases of names unmentionable, and  has debased the beauty of maternity by analysis of the process  of gestation. Surely the inartistic temperament can scarcely  abuse literature further. I own I can conceive nothing less  beautiful. It was said of a great poet by a little critic that he wheeled his  nuptial couch into the area ; but these small poets and smaller  novelists bring out their sick into the thoroughfare, and stop the  traffic while they give us a clinical lecture upon their sufferings.  We are told that this is a part of the revolt of woman, and certainly  our women-writers are chiefly to blame. It is out of date, no  doubt, to clamour for modesty ; but the woman who describes  the sensations of childbirth does so, it is to be presumed--not as the  writer of advice to a wife--but as an artist producing literature for  art's sake. And so one may fairly ask her : How is art served by  all this ? What has she told us that we did not all know, or could  not learn from medical manuals ? and what impression has she left  us over and above the memory of her unpalatable details ? And  our poets, who know no rhyme for " rest " but that " breast "  whose snowinesses and softnesses they are for ever describing with  every accent of indulgence, whose eyes are all for frills, if not for  garters, what have they sung that was not sung with far greater  beauty and sincerity in the days when frills and garters were  alluded to with the open frankness that cried shame on him who evil thought. The one extremity, it seems to me, offends against  the standard of contemporary taste ; ( " people,"  as  Hedda Gabler   said,  " do not say such things now " ) ; the other extremity rebels  against that universal standard of good taste that has from the days  of  Milo  distinguished between the naked and the nude. We are lose By Arthur Waugh 219 losing the distinction now ; the cry for realism, naked and un-  ashamed, is borne in upon us from every side : "Rip your brother's vices open, strip your own foul passions bare ; Down with Reticence, down with Reverence--forward--naked-- let them stare." But there was an Emperor once (we know the story) who went  forth among his people naked. It was said that he wore fairy  clothes, and that only the unwise could fail to see them. At last  a little child raised its voice from the crowd !  " Why, he has  nothing on,"  it said. And so these writers of ours go out from  day to day, girded on, they would have us believe, with the  garments of art ; and fashion has lacked the courage to cry out with the little child :  "They have nothing on."  No robe of art,  no texture of skill, they whirl before us in a bacchanalian dance  naked and unashamed. But the time will come, it must, when  the voices of the multitude will take up the cry of the child, and  the revellers will hurry to their houses in dismay. Without  dignity, without self-restraint, without the morality of art, literature  has never survived ; they are the few who rose superior to the  baser levels of their time, who stand unimpugned among the  immortals now. And that mortal who would put on immortality  must assume that habit of reticence, that garb of humility by  which true greatness is best known. To endure restraint-- that   is to be strong. A Lady Reading By   Walter Sickert Reproduced by Messrs. Carl Hentschel &amp; Co. Modern Melodrama By   Hubert Crackanthorpe T  HE  pink shade of a single lamp supplied an air of subdued  mystery ; the fire burned red and still ; in place of door  and windows hung curtains, obscure, formless; the furniture,  dainty, but sparse, stood detached and incoordinate like the furni-  ture of a stage-scene ; the atmosphere was heavy with heat,  and a scent of stale tobacco ; some cut flowers, half withered,  tissue-paper still wrapping their stalks, lay on a gilt, cane-bottomed  chair. " Will you give me a sheet of paper, please ? " He had crossed the room, to seat himself before the prin-  cipal table. He wore a fur-lined overcoat, and he was tall,  and broad, and bald ; a sleek face, made grave by gold-rimmed  spectacles. The other man was in evening dress ; his back leaning against  the mantelpiece, his hands in his pockets : he was moodily scraping  the hearthrug with his toe. Clean-shaved ; stolid and coarsely  regular features ; black, shiny hair, flattened on to his head ;  under-sized eyes, moist and glistening ; the tint of his face uniform,  the tint of discoloured ivory ; he looked a man who ate well and  lived hard. " Certainly, sir, certainly,"  and he started to hurry about the room. " Daisy ," 224 Modern Melodrama "  Daisy ,"  he exclaimed roughly, a moment later,  " where the  deuce do you keep the note-paper ? " " I don't know if there is any, but the girl always has some."   She spoke in a slow tone--insolent and fatigued. A couple of bed-pillows were supporting her head, and a scarlet  plush cloak, trimmed with white down, was covering her feet, as  she lay curled on the sofa. The fire-light glinted on the metallic  gold of her hair, which clashed with the black of her eyebrows ;  and the full, blue eyes, wide-set, contradicted the hard line of her  vivid-red lips. She drummed her ringers on the sofa-edge,  nervously. " Never mind,"  said the bald man shortly, producing a note  book from his breast-pocket, and tearing a leaf from it. He wrote, and the other two stayed silent ; the man returned to  the hearthrug, lifting his coat-tails under his arms ; the girl went  on drumming the sofa-edge. "There,"  sliding back his chair, and looking from the one to  the other, evidently uncertain which of the two he should address. " Here is the prescription. Get it made up to-night, a table-  spoonful at a time, in a wine-glassful of water at lunch-time, at  dinner-time and before going to bed. Go on with the port wine  twice a day, and (to the girl, deliberately and distinctly) you must  keep quite quiet ; avoid all sort of excitement--that is extremely  important. Of course you must on no account go out at night.  Go to bed early, take regular meals, and keep always warm." "I say,"  broke in the girl,  " tell us, it isn't bad--dangerous, I  mean?" " Dangerous !--no, not if you do what I tell you." He glanced at his watch, and rose, buttoning his coat. " Good-evening,"  he said gravely. At  she paid no heed ; she was vacantly staring before her : then, By Hubert Crackanthorpe 225 then, suddenly conscious that he was waiting, she looked up at  him. " Good-night, doctor." She held out her hand, and he took it. " I'll get all right, won't I ? "  she asked, still looking up at him. " All right--of course you will--of course. But remember  you must do what I tell you." The other man handed him his hat and umbrella, opened the  door for him, and it closed behind them. &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; The girl remained quiet, sharply blinking her eyes, her whole  expression eager, intense. A murmer of voices, a muffled tread of footsteps descending  the stairs--the gentle shutting of a door--stillness. She raised herself on her elbow, listening ; the cloak slipped  noiselessly to the floor. Quickly her arm shot out to the bell-  rope : she pulled it violently ; waited, expectant ; and pulled again. A slatternly figure appeared a woman of middle-age her  arms, bared to the elbows, smeared with dirt ; a grimy apron  over her knees. " What's up ?--I was smashin' coal,"  she explained. " Come here,"  hoarsely whispered the girl-- " here--no--nearer  --quite close. Where's he gone ?" "Gone? 'oo?" "That man that was her." " I s'ppose ee's in the downstairs room. I ain't 'eard the front  door slam." "And  Dick , where's he?" "They're both in there together, I s'ppose." " I want you to go down quietly without making a noise  listen at the door--come up, and tell me what they're saying." "What? 226 Modern Melodrama "What? down there?"  jerking her thumb over her  shoulder. "Yes, of course--at once,"  answered the girl, impatiently. "And if they catches me--a nice fool I looks. No, I'm jest  blowed if I do ! "  she concluded.  " Whatever's up ? " "You must,"  the girl broke out excitedly.  "I tell you, you must." " Must--must--an' if I do, what am I goin' to git out of it ? "   She paused, reflecting ; then added :  " Look 'ere--I tell yer  what--I'll do it for half a quid, there?" " Yes--yes--all right--only make haste." "An' 'ow d' I'know as I'll git it?"  she objected doggedly. " It's a jolly risk, yer know." The girl sprang up, flushed and feverish. " Quick--or he'll be gone. I don't know where it is but you   shall have it--I promise--quick--please go--quick." The other hesitated, her lips pressed together ; turned, and  went out. And the girl, catching at her breath, clutched a chair. &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; A flame flickered up in the fire, buzzing spasmodically. A   creak outside. She had come up. But the curtains did not move.  Why didn't she come in ? She was going past. The girl hastened  across the room, the intensity of the impulse lending her strength. " Come--come in,"  she gasped.  "Quick--I'm slipping." She struck at the wall ; but with the flat of her hand, for  there was no grip. The woman bursting in, caught her, and led  her back to the sofa. "There, there, dearie,"  tucking the cloak round her feet. "Lift up the piller, my 'ands are that mucky. Will yer 'ave anythin'?" She By Hubert Crackanthorpe 227 She shook her head.  " It's gone,"  she muttered.  " Now--tell me." " Tell yer ?--tell yer what! Why--why--there ain't jest  nothin' to tell yer." " What were they saying ? Quick." " I didn't 'ear nothin' . They was talking about some ballet- woman." The girl began to cry, feebly, helplessly, like a child in pain. " You might tell me,  Liz . You might tell me. I've been a   good sort to you." "That yer 'ave. I knows yer'ave, dearie. There, there,  don't yer take on like that. Yer'll only make yerself bad again." "Tell me--tell me,"  she wailed.  "I've been a good sort to you,  Liz ." " Well, they wasn't talkin' of no ballet-woman--that's straight,"   the woman blurted out savagely. " What did he say ?--tell me,"  Her voice was weaker now. " I can't tell yer--don't yer ask me--for God's sake, don't yer  ask me." With a low crooning the girl cried again. " Oh ! for God's sake, don't yer take on like that--it's awful--  I can't stand it. There, dearie, stop that cryin' an' I'll tell yer--I  will indeed. It was jest this way--I slips my shoes off, an' I goes  down as careful--jest as careful as a cat--an' when I gets to  the door I crouches myself down, listenin' as 'ard as ever I  could. The  things as I 'ears was Mr. Dick  speakin' thick- like--like as if 'ee'd bin drinkin'--an' t'other chap 'ee says some-  thin' about lungs, using some long word--I missed that--there  was a van or somethin' rackettin' on the road. Then 'ee says  'gallopin' , gallopin' , jest like as 'ee was talkin' of a 'orse. An'  Mr.  Dick ,'ee says,'ain't there no chance--no'ow ?' and 'ee give a sort 228 Modern Melodrama sort of a grunt. I was awful sorry for 'im, that I was, 'ee must  'ave been crool bad, 'ee's mostly so quiet-like, ain't ee ? An', in  a minute, 'ee sort o' groans out somethin , 'an t'other chap 'es  answer 'im quite cool-like, that 'ee don't properly know ; but,  anyways, it 'ud be over afore the end of February. There I've  done it. Oh ! dearie, it s awful, awful, that's jest what it is.  An I 'ad no intention to tell yer--not a blessed word--that I  didn't--may God strike me blind if I did ! Some 'ow it all come  out, seein' yer chokin' that 'ard an' feelin' at the wall there. Yer  'ad no right to ask me to do it--'ow was I to know 'ee was a  doctor ? " She put the two corners of her apron to her eyes, gurgling  loudly. "Look e're, don't yer b'lieve a word of it--I don't--I tell yer  they're a 'umbuggin' lot, them doctors, all together. I know it.  Yer take my word for that--yer'll git all right again. Yer'll be  as well as I am, afore yer've done--Oh, Lord ! it's jest awful--I  feel that upset I'd like to cut my tongue out, for 'avin' told yer  --but I jest couldn't 'elp myself."  She was retreating towards  the door, wiping her eyes, and snorting out loud sobs-- " An',  don't you offer me that half quid--I couldn't take it of yer--that  I couldn't." &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; She shivered, sat up, and dragged the cloak tight round her  shoulders. In her desire to get warm she forgot what had  happened. She extended the palms of her hands towards the  grate : the grate was delicious. A smoking lump of coal clattered  onto the fender: she lifted the tongs, but the sickening remembrance  arrested her. The things in the room were receding, dancing  round : the fire was growing taller and taller. The woollen scarf  chafed her skin : she wrenched it off. Then hope, keen and bitter, By Hubert Crackanthorpe 229 bitter, shot up, hurting her.  " How could he know ? Of course  he couldn't know. She'd been a lot better this last fortnight--  the other doctor said so--she didn't believe--it she didn't care--  Anyway, it would be over before the end of February ! " Suddenly the crooning wail started again : next, spasms of  weeping, harsh and gasping. By-and-by she understood that she was crying noisily, and that  she was alone in the room : like a light in a wind, the sobbing  fit ceased. "Let me live--let me live--I'll be straight--I'll go to Lucy Rimmerton   --I'll do anything ! Take it away--it hurts--I can't bear it !" Once more the sound of her own voice in the empty room  calmed her. But the tension of emotion slackened, only to  tighten again: immediately she was jeering at herself. What  was she wasting her breath for ? What had Jesus  ever done for  her ? She'd had her fling, and it was no thanks to Him. " ' Dy-sy -- Dy-sy- ----' " From the street below, boisterous and loud, the refrain came up.  And, as the footsteps tramped away, the words reached her once  more, indistinct in the distance ; "  'I'm jest cryzy, all for the love o'you.'  " She felt frightened. It was like a thing in a play. It was as  if some one was there, in the room--hiding--watching her. Then a coughing fit started, racking her. In the middle, she  struggled to cry for help; she thought she was going to suffocate. Afterwards she sank back, limp, tired, and sleepy. The end of February--she was going to die--it was important, exciting--what would it be like ? Everybody else died.  Midge   had died in the summer--but that was worry and going the pace.  And they said that  Annie Evans  was going off too. Damn it ! she wasn't going to be chicken-hearted. She'd face it. She'd had 230 Modern Melodrama had a jolly time. She d be game till the end. Hell-fire--that  was all stuff and nonsense--she knew that. It would be just nothing--like a sleep. Not even painful : she'd be just shut  down in a coffin, and she wouldn't know that they were doing it.  Ah ! but they might do it before she was quite dead ! It had  happened sometimes. And she wouldn't be able to get out. The  lid would be nailed, and there would be earth on the top. And if  she called, no one would hear. Ugh ! what a fit of the blues she was getting ! It was beastly,  being alone. Why the devil didn't  Dick  come back? That noise, what was that ? Bah ! only some one in the street. What a fool she was ! She winced again as the fierce feeling of revolt swept through  her, the wild longing to fight. It was damned rough four  months ! A year, six months even, was a long time. The pain  grew acute, different from anything she had felt before. " Good Lord ! what am I maundering on about ? Four  months--I'll go out with a fizzle like a firework. Why the  devil doesn't  Dick  come ? or Liz or somebody ? What do  they leave me alone like this for ? " She dragged at the bell-rope. &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; He came in, white and blear-eyed. " Whatever have you been doing all this time ? "  she began angrily. "I've been chatting with the doctor."  He was pretending to  read a newspaper : there was something funny about his voice. "It's ripping. He says you'll soon be fit again, as long as you  don't get colds, or that sort of thing. Yes, he says you'll soon be  fit again " --a quick, crackling noise--he had gripped the news paper in his fist. She By Hubert Crackanthorpe 231 She looked at him, surprised, in spite of herself. She would  never have thought he'd have done it like that. He was a good  sort, after all. But--she didn't know why--she broke out  furiously : " You infernal liar--!--I know. I shall be done for by the end  of February--ha ! ha ! " Seizing a vase of flowers, she flung it into the grate. The  crash and the shrivelling of the leaves in the flames brought her  an instant's relief. Then she said quietly : "There--I've made an idiot of myself; but"  (weakly)  "I didn't know--I didn't know--I thought it was different." He hesitated, embarrassed by his own emotion. Presently he  went up to her and put his hands round her cheeks. " No,"  she said,  "that's no good, I don't want that. Get me something to drink. I feel bad." He hurried to the cupboard and fumbled with the cork of a  champagne bottle. It flew out with a bang. She started  violently. " You clumsy fool ! "  she exclaimed. She drank off the wine at a gulp. "  Daisy ,"  he began. She was staring stonily at the empty glass. "  Daisy ,"  he repeated. She tapped her toe against the fender-rail. At this sign, he went on : " How did you know ? " " I sent  Liz  to listen,"  she answered mechanically. He looked about him, helpless. "I think I'll smoke,"  he said feebly. She made no answer. " Here, put the glass down,"  she said. He 232 Modern Melodrama He obeyed. He lit a cigarette over the lamp, sat down opposite her, puffing  dense clouds of smoke. And, for a long while, neither spoke. " Is that doctor a good man ? " "I don't know. People say so,"  he answered. Two Songs By   John Davidson I-- London A   THWART  the sky a lowly sigh From west to east the sweet wind carried ; The sun stood still on  Primrose Hill  ; His light in all the city tarried : The clouds on viewless columns bloomed Like smouldering lilies unconsumed. "Oh, sweetheart, see, how shadowy, Of some occult magician's rearing, Or swung in space of Heaven's grace, Dissolving, dimly reappearing, Afloat upon ethereal tides St. Paul above the city rides !

The Love-Story of Luigi Tansillo By   Richard Garnett Now that my wings are spread to my desire, The more vast height withdraws the dwindling land, Wider to wind these pinions I expand, And earth disdain, and higher mount and higher Nor of the fate of Icarus inquire, Or cautious droop, or sway to either hand ; Dead I shall fall, full well I understand ; But who lives gloriously as I expire ? Yet hear I my own heart that pleading cries, Stay, madman ! Whither art thou bound ? Descend ! Ruin is ready Rashness to chastise. But I, Fear not, though this indeed the end ; Cleave we the clouds, and praise our destinies, If noble fall on noble flight attend. T  HE  above sonnet, one of the finest in Italian literature, is  already known to many English readers in another transla-   tion by the late  Mr. J. Addington Symonds , which originally   appeared in the  Cornhill Magazine , and is prefixed to his trans- lation of the sonnets of  Michael Angelo and  Campanella  ( London ,   1878), under the title of  " The Philosopher's Flight ."  In his   preface  Mr. Symonds  says :  "The sonnet prefixed as a proem to 236 The Love-Story of Luigi Tansillo to the whole book is generally attributed to  Giordano Bruno , in  whose Dialogue in the " Eroici Furori " it occurs. There seems, however, good reason to suppose that it was really written by Tansillo , who recites it in that dialogue. Whoever may have   been its author, it expresses in noble and impassioned verse the   sense of danger, the audacity, and the exultation of those pioneers   of modern thought, for whom philosophy was a voyage of dis-  covery into untravelled regions." Mr. Symonds 's knowledge of  Italian literature was so extensive that he must have had ground   for stating that the sonnet is generally attributed to  Giordano Bruno  ; as it certainly is by  De Sanctis , though it is printed as Tansillo 's in all editions of his works, imperfect as these were   before the appearance of  Signor Fiorentino's  in 1882. It is, nevertheless, remarkable that he should add :  "   There seems good   reason to suppose  that it was really written by Tansillo  ,"  as if there   could be a shadow of doubt on the matter.  " Eroici Furori "  is   professedly a series of dialogues between  Luigi Tansillo  the Nea-   politan poet, who had died about twenty years before their com-  position, and  Cicero , but is in reality little more than a monologue, for Tansillo does nearly all the talking, and  Cicero  receives   his instructions with singular docility. The reason of  Tansillo 's  selection for so great an honour was undoubtedly that, although   born at  Venosa , he belonged by descent to  Nola , Bruno's own   city. In making such free use of  Tansillo 's poetry as he has done throughout these dialogues,  Bruno  was far from the least   idea of pillaging his distinguished countryman. In introducing   the four sonnets he has borrowed (for there are three besides that  already quoted) he is always careful to make  Tansillo  speak of   them as his own compositions, which he never does when  Bruno 's  own verses are put into his mouth. If a particle of doubt could   remain, it would be dispelled by the fact that this sonnet, with other 237 By Richard Garnett other poems by  Tansillo , including the three other sonnets intro-   duced into  Bruno 's dialogue, is published under his name in the " Rime di diversi illustri  Signori Napoletani  ," edited by  Lodovico   Dolce  at Venice , in  1555 , when Bruno  was about seven years old! Mr. Symonds 's interpretation of the sonnet also is erroneous--  in so far, at least, as that the meaning assigned by him never   entered into the head of the author. It is certainly fully suscep-   tible of such an exposition. But  Tansillo , no philosopher, but  a cavalier, the active part of whose life was mainly spent in naval expeditions against the Turks, no more thought with  Mr. Symonds of  " the pioneers of modern philosophy,"  than he thought with Bruno  of  " arising and freeing himself from the body and sensual   cognition."  On the contrary, the sonnet is a love-sonnet, and   depicts with extraordinary grandeur the elation of spirit, combined   with a sense of peril, consequent upon the poem having conceived   a passion for a lady greatly his superior in rank. The proof of   this is to be found in the fact that the sonnet is one of a series,   unequivocally celebrating an earthly passion ; and especially in the   sonnet immediately preceding it in  Dolce 's collection, manifestly   written at the same time and referring to the same circumstance,   in which the poet ascribes his Icarian flight, not to the   influence of Philosophy, but of Love : Love fits me forth with wings, which so dilate, Sped skyward at the call of daring thought, I high and higher soar, with purpose fraught Soon to lay smiting hand on Heaven's gate. Yet altitude so vast might well abate My confidence, if Love not succour brought, Pledging my fame not jeopardised in aught, And promising renown as ruin great. If 238 The Love-Story of Luigi Tansillo If he whom like audacity inspired, Falling gave name immortal to the flood, As sunny flame his waxen pinion fired ; Then of thee too it shall be understood, No meaner prize than Heaven thy soul required, And firmer than thy life thy courage stood. The meaning of the two sonnets is fully recognised by Muratori , who prints them together in his treatise,   "Delia per-   fetta poesia," and adds :  "  volea dire costui che Sera imbarcato in un   amor troppo alto, e s andava facendo coraggio  " This is surely one of the most remarkable instances possible to adduce of the infinite significance of true poetry, and its capacity   for inspiring ideas and suggesting interpretations of which the   poet never dreamed, but which are nevertheless fairly deducible   from his expressions. It is now a matter of considerable interest to ascertain the   identity of this lady of rank, who could inspire a passion at once   so exalted and so perilous. The point has been investigated by Tansillo 's editor,  Signor F. Fiorentino , who has done so much to rescue his unpublished compositions from oblivion, and his   view must be pronounced perfectly satisfactory. She was  Maria   d'Aragona, Marchioness del Vasto,  whose husband, the Marquis   del Vasto , a celebrated general of Spanish descent, famous as Charles the Fifth 's right hand in his successful expedition against Tunis , and at one time governor of the Milanese, was as remark   able for his jealousy as the lady, grand-daughter of a King of Naples , was for her pride and haughtiness. Fiorentino  proves   his case by showing how well all personal allusions in  Tansillo 's.   poems, so far as they can be traced, agree with the circumstances   of the Marchioness, and in particular that the latter is represented   as at one time residing on the  island of Ischia , where  del Vasto was 239 By Richard Garnett was accustomed to deposit his wife for security, when absent on   his campaigns. He is apparently not aware that the object of Tansillo 's affection had already been identified with a member of   the house of  Aragon  by Faria e Sousa , the Portuguese editor of Camo&#x000EB;ns , who, in his commentary on  Camo&#x000EB;ns 's sixty-ninth sonnet, gives an interminable catalogue of ladies celebrated by   enamoured poets, and says,  "  Tansillo  sang Donna Isabel de Aragon ."  This lady, however, the niece of the  Marchioness   del Vasto , was a little girl in  Tansillo 's time, and is only men   tioned by him as inconsolable for the death of a favourite dwarf. The sentiment, therefore, of the two sonnets of  Tansillo  which   we have quoted, is sufficiently justified by the exalted station of   the lady who had inspired his passion, and the risk he ran from   the power and jealousy of her husband. It seems certain, how-   ever, that the Marquis had on his part no ground for apprehension. Maria d'Aragona  does not seem to have had much heart to bestow   upon anyone, and would, in any case, have disdained to bestow   what heart she had upon a poor gentleman and retainer of  Don   Garcia de Toledo , son of the Viceroy of  Naples . She would   think that she honoured him beyond his deserts by accepting his   poetical homage. Tansillo , on his part, says in one of his sonnets   that his devotion is purely platonic ; it might have been more   ardent, he hints, but he is dazzled by the splendour of the light he contemplates, and intimidated by the richness of the band by which he is led. So it may have been at , but as time wore on the   poet naturally craved some proof that his lady was not entirely   indifferent to him, and did not tolerate him merely for the sake of   his verses. This, in the nature of things, could not be given ;   and the poet's raptures pass into doubt and suspicion, thence into   despairing resignation ; thence into resentment and open hostility,   terminating in a cold reconciliation, leaving him free to marry a much 240 The Love-Story of Luigi Tansillo a much humbler but probably a more affectionate person, to whom   he addresses no impassioned sonnets, but whom he instructs in a   very elegant poem (  "La Balia"  ) how to bring up her infant children. These varying affections are depicted with extreme liveliness in a series of sonnets, of which we propose to offer some translated specimens. The order will not be that of the editions   of Tansillo , where the pieces are distributed at random, but the   probable order of composition, as indicated by the nature of the   feeling expressed. It is, of course, impossible to give more than a   few examples, though most deserve to be reproduced. Tansillo had the advantage over most Italian poets of his time of being in love with a real woman ; hence, though possibly inferior in style   and diction to such artists in rhyme as  Bembo  or  Molza , he greatly   surpasses them in all the qualities that discriminate poetry from the   accomplishment of verse. The  sonnet which we shall give is still all fire and rapture : -- I Lady, the heart that entered through your eyes Returneth not. Well may he make delay, For if the very windows that display Your spirit, sparkle in such wondrous wise, Of her enthroned within this Paradise What shall be deemed ! If heart for ever stay, Small wonder, dazzled by more radiant day Than gazers from without can recognise. Glory of sun and moon and silver star In firmament above, are these not sign Of things within more excellent by far ? Rejoice then in thy kingdom, heart of mine, While Love and Fortune favourable are, Nor thou yet exiled for default of thine. Although 241 By Richard Garnett Although, however,  Tansillo 's heart might well remain with its   lady,  Tansillo 's person was necessitated to join the frequent mari- time expeditions of the great nobleman to whom he was attached, Don Garcia de Toledo , against the Turks. The constant free-   booting of the Turkish and Barbary rovers kept the  Mediterranean in a state of commotion comparable to that of the Spanish Main   in the succeeding age, and these expeditions, whose picturesque   history remains to be written, were no doubt very interesting ;   though from a philosophical point of view it is impossible not   to sympathise with the humane and generous poet when he   inquires :-- Che il Turco nasca turco, e'l Moro moro, E giusta causa questa, ond altri ed io Dobbiam incrudelir nel sangue loro ? With such feelings it may well be believed that in his enforced   absence he was thinking at least as much of love as of war, and   that the following sonnet is as truthful as it is an animated picture   of his feelings : -- No length of banishment did e'er remove My heart from you, nor if by Fortune sped I roam the azure waters, or the Red, E'er with the body shall the spirit rove : If by each drop of every wave we clove, Or by Sun's light or Moon's encompassed, Another Venus were engendered, And each were pregnant with another Love: And 242 The Love-Story of Luigi Tansillo And thus new shapes of Love where'er we went Started to life at every stroke of oar, And each were cradled in an amorous thought ; Not more than now this spirit should adore ; That none the less doth constantly lament It cannot worship as it would and ought. Before long, however, the pangs of separation overcome this   elation of spirit, while he is not yet afraid of being forgotten :-- III Like lightning shining forth from east to west, Hurled are the happy hours from morn to night, And leave the spirit steeped in undelight In like proportion as themselves were blest. Slow move sad hours, by thousand curbs opprest, Wherewith the churlish Fates delay their flight ; Those, impulses of  Mercury  incite, These lag at the Saturnian star s behest. While thou wert near, ere separation's grief Smote me, like steeds contending in the race, My days and nights with equal speed did run : Now broken either wheel, not swift the pace Of summer's night though summer's moon be brief; Or wintry days for brevity of sun. IV Now that the Sun hath borne with him the day, And haled dark Night from prison subterrene, Come forth, fair Moon, and, robed in light serene, With thy own loveliness the world array. Heaven's 243 By Richard Garnett Heaven's spheres, slow wheeled on their majestic way, Invoke as they revolve thy orb unseen, And all the pageant of the starry scene, Wronged by thy absence, chides at thy delay. Shades even as splendours, earth and heaven both Smile at the apparition of thy face, And my own gloom no longer seems so loth ; Yet, while my eye regards thee, thought doth trace Another's image ; if in vows be troth, I am not yet estranged from Love's embrace. Continual separation, however, and the absence of any marked  token that he is borne in memory, necessarily prey more and more   on the sensitive spirit of the poet. During the  part, her   husband's tenure of office as Governor of the Milanese, the   Marchioness, as already mentioned, took up her residence in the island of Ischia , where she received her adorer's eloquent aspira-   tions for her welfare--heartfelt, but so worded as to convey a   reproach : V That this fair isle with all delight abound, Clad be it ever in sky's smile serene, No thundering billow boom from deeps marine, And calm with  Neptune  and his folk be found. Fast may all winds by  &#x61683;olus  be bound, Save faintest breath of lispings  Zephyrene  ; And be the odorous earth with glowing green Of gladsome herbs, bright flowers, quaint foliage crowned. All ire, all tempest, all misfortune be Heaped on my head, lest aught thy pleasure stain, Nor 244 The Love-Story of Luigi Tansillo Nor this disturbed by any thought of me, So scourged with ills innumerable train, New grief new tear begetteth not, as sea Chafes not the more for deluge of the rain. The  "quaint foliage"  is in the original  "Arab leaves," arabe   frondi , an interesting proof of the cultivation of exotic plants at   the period. The lady rejoins her husband at  Milan , and Tansillo , landing   on the Campanian coast , lately devastated by earthquakes and   eruptions, finds everywhere the image of his own bosom, and   rejoices at the opportunity which yawning rifts and chasms of earth afford for an appeal to the infernal powers : -- VI Wild precipice and earthquake-riven wall ; Bare jagged lava naked to the sky ; Whence densely struggles up and slow floats by Heaven's murky shroud of smoke funereal ; Horror whereby the silent groves enthral ; Black weedy pit and rifted cavity ; Bleak loneliness whose drear sterility Doth prowling creatures of the wild appal : Like one distraught who doth his woe deplore, Bereft of sense by thousand miseries, As passion prompts, companioned or alone ; Your desert so I rove ; if as before Heaven deaf continue, through these crevices, My cry shall pierce to the Avernian throne. The poet's melancholy deepens, and he enters upon the stage of   dismal and hopeless resignation to the inevitable : As 245 By Richard Garnett VII As one who on uneasy couch bewails Besetting sickness and Time's tardy course, Proving if drug, or gem, or charm have force To conquer the dire evil that assails : But when at last no remedy prevails, And bankrupt Art stands empty of resource, Beholds Death in the face, and scorns recourse To skill whose impotence in nought avails. So I, who long have borne in trust unspent That distance, indignation, reason, strife With Fate would heal my malady, repent, Frustrate all hopes wherewith my soul was rife, And yield unto my destiny, content To languish for the little left of life. A lower depth still has to be reached ere the period of salutary   and defiant reaction : -- VIII So mightily abound the hosts of Pain, Whom sentries of my bosom Love hath made, No space is left to enter or evade, And inwardly expire sighs born in vain, If any pleasure mingle with the train, By the  glimpse of my poor heart dismayed, Instant he dies, or else, in bondage stayed, Pines languishing, or flies that drear domain. Pale semblances of terror keep the keys, Of frowning portals they for none displace Save messengers of novel miseries : All thoughts they scare that wear a gladsome face ; And, were they anything but Miseries, Themselves would hasten from the gloomy place. Slighted 246 The Love-Story of Luigi Tansillo Slighted love easily passes from rejection into rebellion, and we   shall see that such was the case with  Tansillo . The following   sonnet denotes an intermediate stage, when resignation is almost   renunciation, but has not yet become revolt : IX Cease thy accustomed strain, my mournful lute ; New music find, fit for my lot forlorn ; Henceforth be Wrath and Grief resounded, torn The strings that anciently did Love salute, Not on my own weak wing irresolute But on Love's plumes I trusted to be borne, Chanting him far as that remotest bourne Whence strength Herculean reft Hesperian fruit. To such ambition was my spirit wrought By gracious guerdon Love came offering When free in air my thought was bold to range : But otherwhere now dwells another's thought, And Wrath has plucked Love's feather from my wing, And hope, style, theme, I all alike must change. This, however, is not a point at which continuance is possible,   the mind must go either backward or forward. The lover for a   time persuades himself that he has broken his mistress's yoke, and   that his infatuation is entirely a thing of the past. But the poet,  like the lady, protests too much : -- X If Love was miser of my liberty, Lo, Scorn is bounteous and benevolent, Such scope permitting, that, my fetter rent, Not lengthened by my hand, I wander free. The 247 By Richard Garnett The eyes that yielded tears continually Have now with  Lethe 's drops my fire besprent. And more behold, Illusion's glamour spent, Than fabled  Argus  with his century. The tyrant of my spirit, left forlorn As vassal thoughts forsake him, doth remove, And back unto her throne is Reason borne, And I my metamorphosis approve, And, old strains tuning to new keys, of Scorn Will sing as anciently I sang of Love. Several solutions of this situation are conceivable.  Tansillo 's   is that which was perhaps that most likely in the case of an   emotional nature, where the feelings are more powerful than the   will. He simply surrenders at discretion, retracts everything dis-   paraging that he has said of the lady (taking care, however, not to   burn the peccant verses, which are much too good to be lightly   parted with), and professes himself her humble slave upon her own   terms : -- XI All bitter words I spoke of you while yet My heart was sore, and every virgin scroll Blackened with ire, now past from my control, These would I now recall ; for tis most fit My style should change, now Reason doth reknit, Ties Passion sundered, and again make whole ; Be then Oblivion's prey whate'er my soul Hath wrongly of thce thought, spoke, sung, or writ. Not, Lady, that impeachment of thy fame With tongue or pen I ever did design ; But 248 The Love-Story of Luigi Tansillo But that, if unto these shall reach my name, Ages to come may study in my line How year by year more streamed and towered my flame, And how I living was and dying thine. There is no reason to doubt the perfect sincerity of these lines   at the period of their composition ; but  Tansillo 's mistress had   apparently resolved that his attachment should not henceforth have   the diet even of a chameleon ; and it is small wonder to find him   shortly afterwards a tender husband and father, lamenting the   death of an infant son in strains of extreme pathos, and instructing   his wife on certain details of domestic economy in which she   might have been supposed to be better versed than himself. His marriage took place in  1550 , and in one of his sonnets he says that his unhappy attachment had endured sixteen years, which, allowing for a decent interval between the  Romeo  and the  Bene- dict , would date its commencement at  1532  or 1533 . Maria d'Aragona  died on  November 9, 1568 , and  Tansillo , whose services had been rewarded by a judicial appointment in the   kingdom of  Naples , followed her to the tomb on December 1 . If   her death is really the subject of the two poems in terza rima which   appear to deplore it, he certainly lost no time in bewailing her,   but the interval is so brief, and the poems are so weak, that they may   have been composed on some other occasion. With respect to the   latter consideration, however, it must be remembered that he was himself, in all probability, suffering from disabling sickness, having made his will on  November 29 . It is also worthy of note that the  sonnets composed by  Petrarch upon the death of  Laura are in general much inferior in depth of tenderness to those written years after the event.   "In Memoriam "   is another proof that the   adequate poetical expression of grief, unlike that of life, requires   time and study.  Tansillo , then, may not have been so completely disillusioned 249 By Richard Garnett disillusioned as his editor thinks. If the poems do not relate to Maria d'Aragona , we have no clue to the ultimate nature of his   feelings towards her. A generally fair estimate of  Tansillo 's rank as a poet is given  in  Ginguene 's   "History of Italian Literature,"  vol. ix. , pp. 340-343.   It can scarcely be admitted that his boldness and fertility of imagi-  nation transported him beyond the limits of lyric poetry-- for this   is hardly possible -- but it is true that they sometimes transcended   the limits of good taste, and that the germs may be found in him   of the extravagance which so disfigured Italian poetry in the seventeenth century . On the other hand, he has the inestimable advantage over most Italian poets of his day of writing of genuine passion from genuine experience. Hence a truth and vigour   preferable even to the exquisite elegance of his countryman, Angelo di Costanzo , and much more so to the mere amatory   exercises of other contemporaries. After  Michael Angelo  he   stands farther aloof than any contemporary from  Petrarch , a merit   in an age when the study of  Petrarch  had degenerated into slavish   imitation. His faults as a lyrist are absent from his didactic   poems, which are models of taste and elegance. His one unpar-   donable sin is want of patriotism ; he is the dependant and   panegyrist of the foreign conqueror, and seems equally uncon-   scious of the past glories, the actual degradation, or the prospec-   tive regeneration of  Italy . Born a Spanish subject, his ideal of   loyalty was entirely misplaced, and he must not be severely   censured for what he could hardly avoid. But Italy  lost a Tyrtaeus  in him.

The scene represents a richly-furnished but somewhat oppressive   room. The chairs and tables are all narrow, the lamp-shades   stiff, the windows have double glasses. Lord Doldrummond  ,  a   man of middle-age, handsome, but with a dejected, browbeaten air, sits with a rug over his knees, reading  " The Church Times ." The  Butler  announces "  Sir Digby Soame ." Sir Digby is   thin and elderly ; has an easy smile and a sharp eye ; dresses   well ; has two manners--the abrupt with men, the suave with   women , smiles into his beard over his own witticisms. Lord Dol. Ah,  Soame , so you are here at last ? Soame. [ Looking at his watch. ]  I am pretty punctual, only a few   minutes late. Lord Dol. I am worried, anxious, irritable, and that has made the time seem long. Soame. Worried, anxious ? And what about ? Are you not   well ? Have you found that regularity of life ruins the constitu-  tion ? Lord Dol. No, my dear  Soame , no. But I am willing to own   that the existence which my wife enjoys, and which I have learnt   to endure, would not suit every one. Soame. I am glad to find you more tolerant. You used to hold  the very harshest and most crude opinions. I remember when we   were boys, I could never persuade you to accept the admirable   doctrine that a reformed rake makes the best husband ! Lord Dol. [ Timidly .] Repentance does not require so large an  income as folly ! This may explain that paradox. You know, in my 255 By John Oliver Hobbes and George Moore my way, I, too, am something of a philosopher ! I married very   young, whereas you entered the Diplomatic Service and resolved   to remain single : you wished to study women. I have lived with   one for five-and-twenty years.  [ Sighs .] Soame. Oh, I admit at once that yours is the greater achievement   and was the more daring ambition. Lord Dol. I know all I wish to know about women, but men   puzzle me extremely. So I have sent for you. I want your   advice. It is  Cyril  who is the cause of my uneasiness. I am   afraid that he is not happy. Soame. Cyril  not happy ? What is he unhappy about ? You   have never refused him anything ? Lord Dol. Never ! No man has had a kinder father ! When   he is unreasonable I merely say  "You are a fool, but please your-  self !"  No man has had a kinder father ! Soame. Does he complain ? Lord Dol. He has hinted that his home is uncongenial --yet   we have an excellent cook ! Ah, thank heaven every night and   morning, my dear Digby , that you are a bachelor. Praying   for sinners and breeding them would seem the whole duty of man. I was no sooner born than my parents were filled with uneasiness lest I should not live to marry and beget an heir of my own. Now I have an heir, his mother will never know peace   until she has found him a wife ! Soame. And will you permit  Lady Doldrummond to use the   same method with  Cyril  which your mother adopted with such   appalling results in your own case ? Lord Dol. It does not seem my place to interfere, and love-  affairs are not a fit subject of conversation between father and   son ! Soame. But what does  Cyril  say to the matrimonial prospect ? Lord 256 The Fool's Hour Lord Dol. He seems melancholy and eats nothing but oranges.  Yes,  Cyril  is a source of great uneasiness. Soame. Does  Lady Doldrummond  share this uneasiness ? Lord Dol. My wife would regard a second thought on any   subject as a most dangerous form of temptation. She insists that Cyril  has everything which a young man could desire, and when  he complains that the house is dull, she takes him for a drive ! Soame. But  you  understand him ? Lord Dol. I think I do. If I were young again -- Soame. Ah, you regret ! I always said you would regret it if you  did not take your fling ! The pleasures we imagine are so much   more alluring, so much more dangerous, than those we experience.   I suppose you recognise in  Cyril  the rascal you might have been,   and feel that you have missed your vocation ? Lord Dol. [ Meekly .]  I was never unruly, my dear  Soame . We all have our moments, I own, yet -- well, perhaps  Cyril  has   inherited the tastes which I possessed at his age, but lacked the   courage to obey. Soame. And so you wish me to advise you how to deal with   him ! Is he in love ? I have constantly observed that when   young men find their homes unsympathetic, it is because some   particular lady does not form a member of the household. It is  usually a lady, too, who would not be considered a convenient   addition to any mother's visiting-list ! Lord Dol. Lady Doldrummond  has taught him that women   are the scourges of creation. You, perhaps, do not share that view ! Soame. Certainly not. I would teach him to regard them as the   reward, the compensation, the sole delight of this dreariest of all   possible worlds. Lord Dol. [ Uneasily .] Reward! Compensation! Delight! I beg 257 By John Oliver Hobbes and George Moore beg you will not go so far as that. What notion would be more upsettting ? Pray do not use such extreme terms ! Soame. Ha ! ha ! But tell me,  Doldrummond , is it true that   your wife insists on his retiring at eleven and rising at eight ?   I hear that she allows him nothing stronger than ginger ale and   lemon ; that she selects his friends, makes his engagements, and superintends his amusements ? Should he marry, I am told she will even undertake the office of best man ! Lord Dol. Poor soul ! she means well ; and if devotion could   make the boy a saint he would have been in heaven before he was   out of his long clothes. As it is, I fear that nothing can save him. Soame. Save him ? You speak as though you suspected that he   was not such a saint as his mother thinks him. Lord Dol. I suspect nothing. I only know that my boy is   unhappy. You might speak to him, and draw him out if occasion   should offer but do not say a word about this to  Lady Dol- drummond . [ Enter Lady Doldrummond.  .  She is a tall, slight, but not angular   woman. Her hair is brown, and brushed back from her temples   In the simplest possible fashion. Self-satisfaction (of a gentle   and ladylike sort) and eminent contentment with her lot are the  only writings on her smooth, almost girlish countenance. She   has a prim tenderness and charm of manner which soften her   rather cutting voice. ] Lady Dol. What !  Cyril  not here ? How do you do, Sir   Digby ?  I am looking for my tiresome boy. I promised to take   him to pay some calls this afternoon, and as he may have to talk I   must tell him what to say. He has no idea of making himself   pleasant to women, and is the shyest creature in the world ! Soame. You have always been so careful to shield him from all responsibility, 258 The Fool's Hour responsibility,  Lady Doldrummond . Who knows what eloquence,   what decision, what energy he might display, if you did not   possess these gifts in so pre-eminent a degree as to make any   exertion on his part unnecessary, and perhaps disrespectful. Lady Dol. Ah ! mothers are going out of fashion. Even  Cyril   occasionally shows a certain impatience when I venture to correct   him. As if I would hurt any one's feelings unless from a sense   of duty ! And pray, where is the pleasure of having a son if you   may not direct his life ? Lord Dol. Cyril  might ask, where is the pleasure of having  parents if you may not disobey them. Lady Dol. [ To  Soame.]  When Herbert  is alone with me he never makes flippant remarks of this kind.  [ To  Lord Doldrum-  mond.]  I wonder that you like to give your friends such a wrong   impression of your character.  [ Turning to  Sir Digby.]  But I   think I see your drift,  Sir Digby . You wish to remind me that Cyril  is now at an age when I must naturally desire to see him   established in a home of his own. Soame. You have caught my meaning. As he is now two-and-   twenty, I think he should be allowed more freedom than may have  been expedient when he was--say, six months old. Lady Dol. I quite agree with you, and I trust you will convince   Herbert that women understand young men far better than   their fathers ever could. I have found the very wife for  Cyril , and I hope I may soon have the pleasure of welcoming her as a daughter. Soame. A wife ! Good heavens ! I was suggesting that the   boy had more liberty. Marriage is the prison of all emotions, and   I should be very sorry to ask any young girl to be a man's gaol-   keeper. Lord Dol. Sir Digby  is right. Lady 259 By John Oliver Hobbes and George Moore Lady Dol. The presence of a  person has the strangest  effect on  Herbert 's moral vision. As I have trained my son with   a care and tenderness rarely bestowed nowadays even on a girl, I   think I may show some resentment when I am asked to believe him a being with the instincts of a ruffian and the philosophy of a middle-aged bachelor. No,  Sir Digby ,  Cyril  is not my  child if   he does not make his home and his family the happiest in the   world ! Soame. Yes ? Lady Dol. He has no taste for cards, horses, brandy, or actresses.   We read together, walk together, and drive together. In the   evening, if he is too tired to engage in conversation, I play the   piano while he dozes. Lately he has taken a particular interest in Mozart 's classic light opera. Any interest of that kind is so   elevating, and I know of nothing more agreeable than a musical   husband. Lord Dol. You see she is resolved on his marriage, and she has  had  Julia de Trappe  on a visit with us for the last five weeks in   the hope of bringing matters to a crisis. Lady Dol. And why not ? Our marriage was arranged for   us, and what idle fancies of our own could have led to such perfect   contentment ? [Lord Doldrummond  avoids her eyes .] Soame. Julia de Trappe  ? She must be the daughter of that Mrs. Howard de Trappe  who gives large At Homes in a small   house, and who spends her time hunting for old lovers and new   servants. Lady Dol. I own that dear  Julia  has been allowed to meet men  and women who are not fit companions for a young girl, no matter how interesting they may be to the general public. Only yesterday 260 The Fool's Hour yesterday she told me she was well acquainted with  Mr. Mande-   ville , the tenor.  Mrs. de Trappe , it seems, frequently invites him   to dinner. Still,  Julia herself is very sensible, and the family is of  extraordinary antiquity. Soame. But the mother ? If she has not been in the divorce   court, it is through no fault of her own. Lady Dol. [ Biting her lip .] Mrs. de Trappe  is vain and silly, I admit; but as she has at last decided to marry  Mr. Banish , the   banker, I am hoping she will live in his house at  Hampstead , and   think a little more about her immortal soul. Soame. Does  Cyril  seem at all interested in Miss Julia  ? Lady Dol. Cyril  has great elegance of mind, and is not very   strong in the expression of his feelings one way or the other.  But I may say that a deep attachment exists between them. Soame. A man must have sound wisdom before he can appre-   ciate innocence. But I have no desire to be discouraging, and I   hope I may soon have the pleasure of congratulating you all on   the wedding. Good-bye. Lord Dol. What ! Must you go ? Soame. Yes. But  [ aside to Lord Dol .]  I shall bear in mind   what you say. I will do my best. I have an engagement in   town to-night.  [ Chuckles .]  An amusing one. Lord Dol. [ With envy .]  Where ? Soame. At the  Parnassus . Lady Dol. [ With a supercilious smile .]  And what is the  Par- nassus  ? Soame. A theatre much favoured by young men who wish to  be thought wicked, and by young ladies who  are . Good-bye, good-bye.  [  Shakes hands with  Lord  and  Lady Doldrummond and   goes out ] Lady Dol. Thank goodness, he is gone ! What a terrible example 261 By John Oliver Hobbes and George Moore example for  Cyril . I was on thorns every second lest he should   come in.  Soame  has just those meretricious attractions which appeal to youth and inexperience. That you should encourage   such an acquaintance, and even discuss before him such an   intimate matter as my hope with regard to  Julia , is, perhaps, more   painful than astonishing. Lord Dol. They are both too young to marry. Let them   enjoy life while they may. Lady Dol. Enjoy life  ? What a degrading suggestion ! I have often observed that there is a lurking taste for the vicious in every Doldrummond.  [ Picking up  Cyril's  miniature from the table .] Cyril  is pure Bedingfield  : my second self! [ The Butler announces  Mrs. De Trappe, Mr. Arthur Featherleigh,   Mr. Banish. Mrs. de Trappe  is a pretty woman with big   eyes and a small waist ; she has a trick of biting her under-lip,   and looking shocked, as it were, at her own audacity. Her   manner is a little effusive, but always well-bred. She does not   seem affected, and has something artless, confiding, and pathetic.    Mr. Featherleigh  has a nervous laugh and a gentlemanly appear-   ance ; otherwise inscrutable . Mr. Banish  is old, well-preserved,   rather pompous, and evidently mistakes deportment for dignity . ] Mrs. de Trappe. [ Kissing  Lady Dol.  on each cheek .]  Dear  Edith ,   I knew we should surprise you. But  Mr. Banish  and I are house-hunting, and I thought I must run in and see you and Julia , if only for a second. I felt sure you would not mind my   bringing  Arthur [ indicating  Featherleigh.] He is so lonely at the   prospect of my marriage that  Mr. Banish  and I have promised to   keep him always with us. We have known each other so long.   How should we spend our evenings without him ?  James admits   they would be tedious, don't you,  James ?  [ Indicating  Banish.] Banish. 262 The Fool's Hour Banish. Certainly, my dear. Lady Dol. [ Stiffly ]  I can well understand that you have   learned to regard  Mr. Featherleigh  as your own son. And as we advance in years, it is so pleasant to have young people   about us. Mrs. de Trappe. [ After a slight pause .]  How odd that it should   never have struck me in that light before ! I have always thought   of  Arthur  as the trustee, as it were, of my poor fatherless  Julia [ To Banish .]  Have I not often said so,  James  ? Banish. [ Dryly .]  Often. In fact I have always thought that Julia  would never lack a father whilst Arthur  was alive. But I admit that he is a little young for the responsibility. Feather. [ Unmoved .]  Do not forget,  Violet , that our train leaves in fifty-five minutes. Lord Dol. [ Catching a desperate glance from  Lady Doldrum-   mond.]  Then I shall have time to show you the Russian poodles   which the  Duke of Camdem  brought me from  Japan . Mrs. de Trappe. [ Peevishly .]  Yes, please take them away. [ Waving her hand in the direction of  Banish  and  Featherleigh.] Edith  and I have many secrets to discuss. Of course she will tell   you  [ to  Lord Dol.]  everything I have said when we are gone,   and I shall tell  Arthur  and  James  all she has said as we go home.   But it is so amusing to think ourselves mysterious for twenty   minutes.  [ As the men go out laughing, she turns to  Lady Doldrummond with a sigh .]  Ah,  Edith , when I pause in all these gaieties and   say to myself,  Violet , you are about to marry a second husband, I   cannot feel sufficiently thankful that it is not the . Lady Dol. The  ? Mrs. de Trappe. To face the possibility of a  honeymoon,   a  disappointment, and a  funeral would tax my courage   to the utmost ! And I am not strong. Lady 263 By John Oliver Hobbes and George Moore Lady Dol. I am shocked to see you so despondent. Surely you   anticipate every happiness with  Mr. Banish  ? Mrs. de Trappe. Oh, yes. He has money, and  Arthur thinks   him a very worthy sort of person. He is a little dull, but then middle-class people are always so gross in their air when they attempt to be lively or amusing ; so long as they are grave I can   bear them well enough, but I know of nothing so unpleasant as   the sight of a banker laughing. As  Arthur  says, City men and   butlers should always be serious. Lady Dol. Do you think that the world will quite understand -- Arthur  ? Mrs. de Trappe. What do you mean,  Edith  ? A woman must  have an adviser.  Arthur  was my late husband's friend, and he is   my future husband's friend. Surely that should be enough to   satisfy the most exacting. Lady Dol. But why marry at all ? why not remain as you are ? Mrs. de Trappe. How unreasonable you are,  Edith  ! How often   have you urged me to marry  Mr. Banish , and now that it is all   arranged and  Arthur  is satisfied, you begin to object. Lady Dol. I thought that you liked  Mr. Banish better. Mrs. de Trappe. Better than  Arthur  ? No, I am not so unkind   as that, nor would  James wish it. I am marrying because I am   poor. My husband, as you know, left nearly all his money to Julia , and I feel the injustice so acutely that the absurd settlement   he made on me is spent upon doctor's bills alone. If it were not   for  Arthur  and one or two other kind friends who send me game and other little things from time to time, I could not exist at all. [ Draws off her gloves, displays a diamond ring on each finger, and   wipes her eyes with a point-lace pocket-handkerchief . ]  And when I think of all that I endured with  De Trappe  ! How often have I been   roused from a sound sleep to see the room illuminated and  De Trappe, 264 The Fool's Hour Trappe , rolled up in flannel, sitting by the fire reading  "Lead,   kindly Light."  What an existence ! But now tell me about Julia . I hope she does not give you much trouble. Lady Dol. I only hope that I may keep her always with me. Mrs. de Trappe. How she must have improved ! When she is  at home I find her so depressing. And she does not appeal to   men in the least. Lady Dol. I could wish that all young girls were as modest. Mrs. de Trappe. Oh, I daresay  Julia  has all the qualities we like  to see in some other woman's daughter. But if you were her   mother and had to find her a husband, you would regard her virtues   in another light. Fortunately she has eight thousand a year, so   she may be able to find somebody. Still, even money does not tempt men as it once did. A girl must have an extraordinary   charm. She is so jealous of me. I cannot keep her out of the   drawing-room when I have got callers, especially when  Mr. Mandeville  is there. Lad Dol. I have heard of  Mr. Mandeville . He is an actor, a   singer. Mrs. de Trappe. A lovely tenor voice. All the women are in   love with him, except me. I would not listen to him. And now   they say he is going to marry Sarah Sparrow -- a great mistake. I   should like to know who would care about him or his singing,   once he is married. Lady Dol. And who is  Sarah Sparrow  ? Mrs. de Trappe. Don't you know ? She is the last great   success. She has two notes : B flat and the lower G-- the   orchestra plays the rest. You must go to the  Parnassus  and hear   her. To-night is the dress rehearsal of the new piece. Lady Dol. And do you receive  Miss Sparrow  ? Mrs. de Trappe. No, women take up too much time. They say, 265 By John Oliver Hobbes and George Moore say, too, that she is frantically jealous because  Mandeville  used to   come and practise in my boudoir. He says no one can accom-  pany him as I do ! Lady Dol. I hope  Cyril  does not meet  Mr. Mandeville  when he   goes to your house. Mrs. de Trappe. Let me see. I believe I introduced them.   At any rate, I know I saw them at luncheon together last week. Lady Dol. At luncheon together !  Cyril  and this person who   sings ? What could my boy and  Mr. Mandeville  have in common ? Mrs. de Trappe. They both appear to admire  Sarah Sparrow very much. And I cannot find what men see in her. She is not tall and her figure is most innocent ; you would say she was still   in pinafores. As for her prettiness, I admit she has fine eyes, but   of course she blackens them. I think the great attraction is her atrocious temper. One never knows whom she will stab next. Lady Dol. [ Half to herself .] Last week  Cyril  came in after midnight. He refused to answer my questions. Mrs. de Trappe. You seem absent-minded, my dear  Edith . [ Pause .]  I must be going now. Where are  Arthur  and James  ?   We have not a moment to lose. We are going to choose wedding   presents.  James  is going to choose  Arthur 's and  Arthur  is going   to choose  James 's, so there can be no jealousy. It was I who thought of that way out of the difficulty. One does one's best to   be nice to them, and then something happens and upsets all one's   plans. Where is  Cyril  ? Lady Dol. I am afraid  Cyril  is not at home. Mrs. de Trappe. Then I shall not see him. Tell him I am   angry, and give my love to Julia . I hope she does not disturb you when you are in the drawing-room and have visitors. So difficult to keep a grown-up girl out of the drawing-room. Where   can those men be ?  [ Enter  Lord Doldrummond, Mr. Feather- leigh, 266 The Fool's Hour leigh,  and  Mr. Banish.]  Ah ! here they are. Now, come   along ; we haven't a moment to lose. Good-bye, Edith . [ Exeunt (after wishing their adieux)  Mrs. de Trappe, Mr.  Featherleigh,  and  Mr. Banish, Lord Doldrummond following them .] Lady Dol. [ Stands alone in the middle of the room repeating .] Cyril  and--  Sarah Sparrow  ! My son and  Sarah Sparrow  ! And   he has met her through the one woman for whom I have   been wrong enough to forget my prejudices. What a punish-   ment ! [Julia  enters cautiously. She is so unusually beautiful that she barely   escapes the terrible charge of sublimity. But there is a certain   peevishness in her expression which adds a comfortable smack of   human nature to her classic features .] Julia. I thought mamma would never go. I have been hiding   in your boudoir ever since I heard she was here. Lady Dol. Was  Cyril  with you ? Julia. Oh, no ; he has gone out for a walk. Lady Dol. Tell me, dearest, have you and  Cyril had any dis-   agreement lately ? Is there any misunderstanding ? Julia. Oh, no.  [ Sighs .] Lady Dol. I remember quite well that before I married  Herbert he often suffered from the oddest moods of depression. Several times he entreated me to break off the engagement. His affection   was so reverential that he feared he was not worthy of me. I   assure you I had the greatest difficulty in overcoming his scruples,   and persuading him that whatever his faults were I could help him   to subdue them. Julia. But  Cyril  and I are not engaged. It is all so uncertain,  so humiliating. Lady 267 By John Oliver Hobbes and George Moore Lady Dol. Men take these things for granted. If the truth   were known, I daresay he already regards you as his wife. Julia. [ With an inspired air .]  Perhaps that is why he treats   me so unkindly. I have often thought that if he were my   husband he could not be more disagreeable ! He has not a word   for me when I speak to him. He does not hear. Oh,  Lady   Doldrummond , I know what is the matter. He is in love, but I   am not the one. You are all wrong. Lady Dol. No, no, no. He loves you ; I am sure of it. Only   be patient with him and it will come all right. Hush ! is that his   step ? Stay here, darling, and I will go into my room and write   letters.  [ Exit, brushing the tears from her eyes .] [Butler  ushers in  Mr. Mandeville.  Neither of them perceive  Julia, who has gone to the window .] Butler. His Lordship will be down in half an hour, sir. He is   now having his hair brushed. Julia. [ In surprise as she looks round . ] Mr. Mandeville  !  [ Pause . ]   I hardly expected to meet you here. Mandeville. And why, may I ask ? Julia. You know what  Lady Doldrummond  is. How did you   overcome her scruples ? Mandeville. Is my reputation then so very bad ? Julia. You -- you are supposed to be rather dangerous. You   sing on the stage, and have a tenor voice. Mandeville. Is that enough to make a man dangerous ? Julia. How can  I  tell ? But mamma said you were invincible.   You admire mamma, of course.  [ Sighs .] Mandeville. A charming woman,  Mrs. de Trappe . A very  interesting woman ; so sympathetic. Julia. But she said she would not listen to you. The Yellow Book Vol. I. Q Mandeville . 268 The Fool's Hour Mandeville. Did she say that ?  [A slight pause.]  I hope you   will not be angry when I own that I do not especially  admire  your   mother. A quarter of a century ago she may have had consider-   able attractions, but-- are you offended ? Julia. Offended ? Oh, no. Only it seems strange. I thought   that all men admired mamma.  [ Pause .]  You have not told me  yet how you made Lady Doldrummond 's acquaintance. Mandeville. I am here at  Lord Aprile 's invitation. He has   decided that he feels no further need of  Lady Doldrummond 's   apron-strings. Julia. Oh,  Mr. Mandeville , are you teaching him to be   wicked ? Mandeville. But you will agree with me that a young man   cannot make his mother a kind of scribbling diary ? Julia. Still, if he spends his time well, there does not seem to   be any reason why he should refuse to say where he dines when he   is not at home. Mandeville. Lady Doldrummond  holds such peculiar ideas ; she   would find immorality in a sofa-cushion. If she were to know   that  Cyril  is coming with me to the dress rehearsal of our new   piece ! Julia. It would break her heart. And  Lord Doldrummond would be indignant. Mamma says his own morals are so excellent ! Mandeville. Is he an invalid ? Julia. Certainly not. Why do you ask ? Mandeville. Whenever I hear of a charming husband I always   think that he must be an invalid. But as for morals, there can be no   harm in taking Cyril  to a dress rehearsal. If you do not wish him   to go, however, I can easily say that the manager does not care to   have strangers present.  [ Pause .]  Afterwards there is to be a ball at  Miss Sparrow 's. Julia . 269 By John Oliver Hobbes and George Moore Julia. Is  Cyril  going there, too ? Mandeville. I believe that he has an invitation, but I will   persuade him to refuse it, if you would prefer him to remain at   home. Julia. You are very kind,  Mr. Mandeville , but it is a matter of   indifference to me where  Lord Aprile  goes. Mandeville. Perhaps I ought not to have mentioned this to   you ? Julia. [ Annoyed .]  It does not make the least difference. In   fact, I am delighted to think that you are taking  Cyril  out into the world. He is wretched in this house.  [ With heroism .]  I am   glad to think that he knows any one so interesting and clever and   beautiful as Sarah Sparrow . I suppose she would be considered   beautiful ? Mandeville. [ With a profound glance .]  One can forget her--   sometimes. Julia. [ Looking down .] Perhaps-- when I am as old as she is--   I shall be prettier than I am at present. Mandeville. You always said you liked my voice. We never   see anything of each other now. I once thought that-- well--   that you might like me better. Are you sure you are not angry   with me because I am taking  Cyril  to this rehearsal ? Julia. Quite sure. Why should I care where  Cyril  goes ? I   only wish that I, too, might go to the theatre to-night. What   part do you play ? And what do you sing ? A serenade ? Mandeville. [ Astounded .]  Yes. How on earth did you guess   that ? The costume is, of course, picturesque, and that is the great   thing in an opera. A few men can sing-- after a fashion-- but to   find the right clothes to sing  in  -- that shows the true artist. Julia. And  Sarah  ; does she look her part ? Mandeville. Well, I do not like to say anything against her, but 270 The Fool's Hour but she is not quite the person I should cast for  la Marquise de la   Perdrigonde . Ah ! if you were on the stage,  Miss de Trappe  !   You have just the exquisite charm, the grace, the majesty of   bearing which, in the opinion of those who have never been to   Court, is the peculiar distinction of women accustomed to the   highest society. Julia. Oh, I should like to be an actress ! Mandeville. No ! no ! I spoke selfishly-- if you only acted   with me, it would be different ; but-- but I could not bear to see   another man making love to you-- another man holding your hand   and singing into your eyes-- and-- and-- Oh, this is madness. You must not listen to me. Julia. I am not-- angry, but-- you must never again say things which you do not mean. If I thought you were untruthful it   would make me so --so miserable. Always tell me the truth. [ Holds out her hand .] Mandeville. You are very beautiful ! [ She drops her eyes, smiles, and wanders unconsciously to the   mirror . ] [Lady Doldrummond  suddenly enters from the boudoir, and  Cyril from the middle door . Cyril  is handsome, but his features have   that delicacy and his expression that pensiveness which promise   artistic longings and domestic disappointment .] Cyril. [ Cordially and in a state of suppressed excitement .]  Oh,   mother, this is my friend  Mandeville . You have heard me men-  tion him ? Lady Dol. I do not remember, but-- Cyril. When I promised to go out with you this afternoon, I   forgot that I had another engagement.  Mandeville  has been kind   enough to call for me, Lady 271 By John Oliver Hobbes and George Moore Lady Dol. Another engagement,  Cyril  ? [Lord Doldrummond  enters and comes down, anxiously looking from one to the other .] Cyril. Father, this is my friend  Mandeville . We have arranged   to go up to town this afternoon. Lady Dol. [ Calmly .]  What time shall I send the carriage to the   station for you ? The last train usually arrives about -- Cyril. I shall not return to-night. I intend to stay in town. Mandeville  will put me up. Lord Dol. And where are you going ? Mandeville. He is coming to our dress rehearsal of the  "Dandy   and the Dancer." Cyril. At the  Parnassus .  [Lord  and  Lady Doldrummond exchange horrified glances ]  I daresay you have never heard of the   place, but it amuses me to go there, and I must learn life for   myself. I am two-and-twenty, and it is not extraordinary that I   should wish to be my own master. I intend to have chambers of   my own in town. Lady Dol. Surely you have every liberty in this house ? Lord Dol. If you leave us, you will leave the rooms in which   your mother has spent every hour of her life, since the day you   were born, planning and improving. Must all her care and   thought go for nothing ? The silk hangings in your bedroom she   worked with her own hands. There is not so much as a pen-   wiper in your quarter of the house which she did not choose with   the idea of giving you one more token of her affection. Cyril. I am not ungrateful, but I cannot see much of the world   through my mother's embroidery. As you say, I have every   comfort here. I may gorge at your expense and snore on your   pillows and bully your servants, I can do everything, in fact, but live. 272 The Fool's Hour live. Dear mother, be reasonable.  [ Tries to kiss her. She remains   quite frigid .] [Footman  enters .] Footman. The dog-cart is at the door, my lord. Cyril. You think it well over and you will see that I am   perfectly right. Come on,  Mandeville , we shall miss the train.   Make haste : there is no time to be polite.  [ He goes out, dragging Mandeville  after him, and ignoring Julia.] Lord Dol. Was that my son ? I am ashamed of him ! To   desert us in this rude, insolent, heartless manner. If I had   whipped him more and loved him less, he would not have been   leaving me to lodge with a God knows who. I disown him !   The fool ! Lady Dol. If you have anything to say, blame  me  !  Cyril  has   the noblest heart in the world ;  I  am the fool. Curtain .

"The poems have the wild melancholy and the fierce simplicity of all true popular ballads, with an undertone of ghastly mystery that reminds one of the Highland second-sight and Irish fairy tales....They are directly, passionately, fiercely human; rich with a poetic sympathy with external nature, but regarding it almost as the comrade and friend of man....There are elements of the Greek joy in all beautiful sights and sounds....but there is also a fierce love of battle and of blood, such as rings through the Nibelungen epic."--FREDERIC HAR- RISON in  The Fortnightly Review .

List of Books IN Belles Lettres Elkin Mathews   &amp; John Lane:  Publishers  and Vendors of Choice &amp; Rare Editions in Belles Lettres. All the Books in this Catalogue are Published at Net Prices Telegraphic Address  1894 Bodleian, London "A WORD must be said for the manner in which the publishers have produced the volume ( i.e. , 'The Earth Fiend'), a sumptuous folio, printed by CONSTABLE, the etchings on Japanese paper by MR. GOULDING. The volume should add not only to MR. STRANG'S fame but to that of MESSRS. ELKIN MATHEW AND JOHN LANE, who are rapidly gaining distinction for their beautiful editions of belles- lettres."-- Daily Chronicle , Sept. 24, 1892. Referring to  MR. LE GALLIENNE'S "English Poems"  and  "Silhouettes" by ARTHUR SYMONS—"we only refer to them now to note a fact which they illustrate, and which we have been observing of late, namely, the recovery to a certain extent of good taste in the matter of printing and binding books. These two books, which are turned out by MESSRS. ELKIN MATHEWS AND JOHN LANE, are models of artistic publishing, and yet they are simplicity itself. The books with their excellent printing and their very simplicity make a harmony which is satisfying to the artistic sense."  Sunday Sun , Oct. 2, 1892. "MR. LE GALLIENNE is a fortunate young gentleman. I don't know by what legerdemain he and his publishers work, but here, in an age as stony to poetry as the ages of Chatter- ton and Richard Savage, we find the full edition of his book sold before publication. How is it done, MESSRS. ELKIN MATHEWS AND JOHN LANE? for, without depreciating MR. LE GALLIENNE'S sweetness and charm, I doubt that the marvel would have been wrought under another publisher. These publishers, indeed, produce books so delightfully that it must give an added pleasure to the hoarding of editions." KATHARINE TYNAN, in  The Irish Daily Independent "To MESSRS. ELKIN MATHEWS AND JOHN LANE almost more than any other, we take it, are the thanks of the grateful singer especially due; for it is they who have managed, by means of limited editions and charming work- manship, to impress book-buyers with the belief that a volume may have an aesthetic and commercial value. They have made it possible to speculate in the latest discovered poet, as in a new company—with the difference that an operation in the former can be done with three half- crowns."-- St. James's Gazette . 1894.

Prospectuses on application. "Nearly every book put out by MESSRS. ELKIN MATHEWS AND JOHN LANE, at the sign of the Bodley Head, is a satis- faction to the special senses of the modern bookman for bindings, shapes, types, and papers.

ELKIN MATHEWS AND JOHN LANE as being the publishers thereof, that there will be something worth reading to be found between the boards."—World. "All MESSRS. ELKIN MATHEWS AND JOHN LANE's books are so beautifully printed and so tastefully issued, that it rejoices the heart of a book-lover to handle them; but they have shown their sound judgment not less markedly in the literary quality of their publications. The choiceness of form is not inappropriate to the matter, which is always of something more than ephemeral worth. This was a distinction on which the better publishers at one time prided themselves; they never lent their names to trash; but some names associated with worthy traditions have proved more than once a delusion and a snare. The record of MESSRS. ELKIN MATHEWS AND JOHN LANE is perfect in this respect, and their imprint is a guarantee of the worth of what they publish." Birmingham Daily Post, Nov. 6th, 1893.
