SplendorMARGARET C ANDERSON American novelist stated the other day that the American woman is oversexedthat present day modes of dress are all designed to emphasize sexand that it is high time for a reaction against sex discussionssex storiesand sex playsBut I think she s entirely mistakenThe American womanspeaking broadlyis pathetically undersexedjust as she is undersensitive and underintelligentThe last adjective will be disputed or resented but it s interesting once in a while to hear the thoughtful foreigner s opinion of our intelligenceTagorefor instancesaid that he was agreeably surprised in regard to the American man and astonished at the stupidity of the American womanAs for our fiction and drama we ve had much about sex in the last few yearssome of it intensely valuablemuch of it intensely foolish but it s quite too early to predict the reactionThe really constructive work on the subject is yet to be doneAnd the pity of the whole thing is that the critics who keep lecturing us on our oversexedness don t realize that what they re really trying to get at is our poverty of spiritour emotional incapacitiesour vanitiesour pettinesses any number of qualities which spring from anything but too much sexNothing is safer than to say that the man or woman of strong sex equipment is rarely vain or petty or mean or unintelligentBut as a result of all this vague bickeringsex continues to shoulder the blame for all kinds of shortcomingsand the real root of the trouble goes untreatedeven undiagnosedOne thing is certain until we become conscious that there s something very wrong with our attitude toward sexwe ll never get rid of the hardtightanaemicmetallic woman who flourishes in America as nowhere else in the worldThis doesn t mean the old Puritan typeto whom sex was a rottenunmentionable thingnor does it mean the Victorianwho recognizes the sex impulse only as a means to an endThey belong to the past too definitely to be harmfulIt means two newer types than these the woman who looks upon sex as something to be endured and forgivenand the woman who doesn t feel at allThe first type has a greatand by no means a secretpride in her spiritual superiority to the coarse creature she marriedand a never dying hope that she can lead him up to her levelShe talks a lot about spiritualityshe has her standardsand she knows how to classify what she calls sensuality she s convinced that she has married the best man in the worldbut wellall men have this failing in commonand the only Copyright1014by Margaret CAndersonThe Little Reviewthing one can do is to rise above it magnificentlywith that air of spiritual isolation which is her most effective weaponShaw has hit her off on occasionbut he ought to devote a whole three acts to her undoingor perhaps an Ibsen would do it betterbecause tragedy follows her path like some sinister shadowas inevitably as those other ghosts of hisThe second type has no more capacity for love or sex than she has for music or poety which is none at allLike a polished glass vaseempty and beautifulshe lures the man who loves her to a kind of supreme nothingnessShe will always tell you that marriage is wonderfuland she urges all her friends to marry as quickly as possiblefor that s the only way to be perfectly happyMarriage iswonderfulto her just as birth is wonderful in Charlotte Perkins Gilman s

skill s immense But it s a dreadful danger and expense It s all a powder puff mattermarriage means new clothesgiftsand a house to play withIt gives her another chance to get something for nothing which is immoralBut the beauty of the situation is that the immoralitythanks to our habits of not thinking straightis so perfectly concealedit even appears that she is the one who does the givingAs for any bother about sexshe ll soon put an end to hatAnd so she goes on her pirate waysluring for the sake of the lureadding her voice to the already swelled chorus which proclaims that truth and beauty lodge in things as they arenot in things as they might or should beButto return to the novelist s argument about clothesthe present fashion for low necks and slit skirts has nothing to do with sex necessarilyIts origin is in vanity which may or may not have a bearing upon sexAnd of course it usually hasn tfor vanity is an attribute of small naturesand sex is an attribute of great onesThere has never been a time when women had such an opportunity to be beautiful physicallyAnd they are taking advantage of itWatch any modern matinée or concert or shopping crowd carefullyThere s something about the new style that points to a finer naturalnessjust as it is more natural for men to wear clothes that follow the lines of their bodies than to pad their shoulders and use twice too much cloth in their trouser legsThe move of muscles through a close fitting suit gives an effect of strength and efficiency and animal grace that is superbly healthyAnd it is so with womentooWith the exception of the foolish and unnecessary restrictions in walking women have such a splendid chance to look straightunhampereddirectlitheI don t know just whybut I want to use the word true about the new clothesThey re so much less dishonest than the old padded ways the strangepervertedmuffled methodsThe old plan was built on the theory that the suppression of nature is civilization the new plan seems to be that a recognition of nature is common senseW e may become Greek yetBy all of which I ll probably be credited with supporting the silly indeThe Little Review 3 cencics we see every day on the street ridiculousunintelligent manifestations of the new freedom instead of merely seeing in its wise expression a bigger hope of truthI think the preachers who arc filling the newspapers with hysterical protests about women s dress had better look a little more closely at the real issue and stop confusing a fine impulse with its inevitable abusesBut after all there s only one important thing to be said about sex in its relation to a full lifeSome day we re going to have a tremendous revaluation of the thing known as feelingWe re going to realize that the only person who doesn t err in relation to values is the artist and since the bigger part of the artist s equipment is simply the capacity to feelwe re going to begin training a race of men toward a new idealIt shall be thisthat nothing shall qualify as fundamentallyimmoralexcept denial the failure of imaginationof understandingof appreciationof quickening to beauty in every formof perceiving beauty where custom or convention has dwarfed its original staturethe failure to put one s self in the other person s placethe greatghastly failure of life which allows one to look but not to seeto listen but not to hear to touch but not to feelThe other night I heard Schumann s Des Abends that summer night elegy of a thousandthousand cadences played near a place where trees were stirring softly and grass smelling warm and cool some one said afterward that it was prettyThe other day I heard a violin played so throbbingly that it was like what the sea has striven to say and through it all a group of people talkedas though no miracle were happeningNot very long after these twoI can t find a noun I talked with some one who tried to convince me that the biggest and most valiant person I know was wellnot the sort one can afford to be friends with Somehow all three episodes immediately linked themselves together in my mindEach was a failure of the same type a failure of imaginationof feelingthe last oneat leastwas tragedy and it will become impossible for people to fail that way only when they stop failing in the first two waysNot long ago I went into a music store and bought Tschaikowsky s Les LarmesIt cost twenty eight centsI walked out so under the spell of the immense adventure of living that I realized later how imbecile I must have looked and why the clerk gazed at me so suspiciouslyBut I had a song which had cost a man who knows what sorrow to writea thing of such richness that it meant experience to any one who could own itOne of the world s big things for twenty eight cents And such things happen every day Sex is simply the quintessence of this type of feelingplus a deeper thing for which no words have been madeBut we reach the wonder of the utmost realization in just one wayby having felt greatly at every stepAmerican artists know everything said a young foreign sculptor lately they know that much throwing out his arms widebut they only feel that muchmeasuring an inch with his fingers How can we produce the great audiences that Whitman knew we needed in order to have great poetsif we don t train the new generations to feelHow can we prevent these crimes against love and sex how put a stop to human waste in all its hideous forms if we don t recognize the new idealism which means not to denyThe Little Review A Kaleidoscope NICHOLAS VACHEL LINDSAY Blanche SweetMoving

apparent fromthe fact that after five years of stormyexistence the movement does not disappearor abatebuton the contrarycontinuallygains soil and spreads deep andwide over all fields of European art The critics of the new school no longerfind it possible to dismiss it with a contemptuoussmile as a silly joke of oversatiatedmodernistsbut they either attackthe Futurists with the vehemenceand fury of a losing combatantorthey discuss the doctrine earnestly andapprehensively To set art free of the atavistic fettersof the old culture and civilizationto imbueit with the nervous sensitiveness ofour agehave been the negative and positiveaims of FuturismIt is absurd toabide by the forms of Phydias andAEschylus in the days of radium and aeroplanesThe influence of the oldmasterpieces is accountable for the factthat of late humanity ceased to producegreat works of artIt is quite naturalthat the protest against the historicalburden should have originated in Italy a country whichafter having served forcenturies as a pillar of lighthas so degeneratedthat in our times it can boastonly of such names as the saccharineVerdi and the pretentious D Annunzio It is naturalI should like to addthat inthis country Futurism is still a foreignplantforfortunately or unfortunately we have been free of a burdensome heritage and an iconoclastic movement wouldappear quixotic Started in Milan in the end of theyear 1909the movement has swept thecontinent and has revolutionized art Even conservative England feebly echoesthe battle cry in the attempts of the The Little Review ImagistsI do not intend to prognosticate the future of Futurismit is still in its infantile stagegrowing and developing with surprising leapscontinually taking on new formsbut the present day Futurism is abundant with quaintgrotesque features approaching caricatureand some of them merit a few wordsThe parent of Futurism and the present leader of Futurist poetsMarinettiisto say the leastan unusual personalityHis BoswellTullia Panteadescribes his master s life in its minutest nuances and chants dithyrambs to his wonderful achievementsWe learn that Marinetti was born in Egypt in voluptuous surroundingshis father being a millionaireFrom his childhood on he disposed of unlimited sums of moneyAt the age of eleven he knew a woman at fifteen he edited a literary magazinePapyrusprinted on vellum paperat seventeen he fought a duel We follow this enfant terrible to Paris where he lavishly squanders his millionsfights duelsand faces the court for his pornographic poemsHe is sentenced to an eight weeksimprisonment for an exotic work which I shall not venture to quoteas it is too repulsive to the English readerPantea further describes his master s kingly palazzo in Milanwhereat night in the bed chamber decorated with astonishing elegance and with mad extravagance meet the most beautiful women of Italy and Europe I quote these nauseatic detailsfor they help to explain the erotic aroma of Marinetti s poemsTheir erotism is morbidaroused by artificial convulsions of sensuality imitation of madness a cancan of dancing Death Yet we cannot overlook the beauty of the versestheir devilish rhythmand enchanting mysticismSome of his early poemsmore natural than his latest Words at Libertyare intoxicating with their mad exoticismThe following is one of his best known poemsThe Banjos of DespairElles chantentles benjohs hystériques et sauvagescomme des chattes énervées par l odeur de l orageCe sont des nègres qui les tiennent empoignées violemmentcomme on tient une amarre que secoue la bourrasqueElles miaulentles benjohssons leurs doigts frénétiqueset la meren bombant son dos d hippopotameacclame leurs chansons par des flic flacs sonores et des renàclementsThe hysteric and savage banjos that meow like cats maddened by the odor of the storm the sea whichswelling its back of a hippopotamusapplauds their songs with its sonorous twick twacks and snorts I understand the poetI believe himButas I saidthis is Marinetti s early poetryHow far he has progressedyou may judge from the following quotation from his latest Words at Libertyas it appears in The London TimesINDIFFERENZA DI 2 ROTONDITA SOSPESE SOLE PALLONE FRENATI flamme giganti colonne di fumo spirali di scintille villaggi turchi incendiati grande T rrrrrzzzonzzzzzzante d ue monoplano bulgaro neve di manifestiThis poem is a description of a battle during the Turco Bulgarian warthe 14 The Little Reviewstyle is supposed to bepolychromaticpolymorphousand polyphonicthat may not only animalizevegetalizeelectrifyand liquefy itselfbut penetrate and express the essence and the atomic life of matter This is the dernier cri of Italian Futurism which originated in a draffditchHere is Marinetti s own electrifieddescription of that memorable event As usual we spent the night in our favorite caféwhich is attended by the most elegant womenSome one suggested that we take an automobile ride in the suburbsWe whirled over the sleepy streetsOut of townDeep darknessMoment of fallingWe are hurled into an abyssEcstasyThen we are on the bottom of a ditch filled with malodorous dregsWe drown in the mudMud covers the facethe bodymud blinds the eyesfills the mouthFinally we succeed in getting out of the filthy ditch and we go back to the cityBut For a certain time there remained with us the taste of rottennesswe could not get rid of the rotten odor that permeated all pores of our bodiesIn the moment of falling into that ditch the idea of Futurism came into my headOn the same night before dawn we wrote the entire first manifesto on FuturismThus the new art was born under peculiar circumstancesunder the sign of scandal and scandal became the tactics of Italian Futurists who have professed their delight in being hissedand their contempt for applauseA few points of that manifesto We shall sing of the love of dangerthe habit of energy and boldnessLiterature has hitherto glorified thoughtful immobilityecstasy of sleep we shall extol aggressive movementfeverish insomniathe double quick stepthe somersaultthe box on the earthe fisticuffThere is no more beauty except in strifeWe wish to glorify war the only purifier of the world militarismpatriotismthe destrucive gesture of the anarchistthe beauty of Ideas that killthe contempt for womenWe wish to destroy the museumsthe librariesto fight against moralism and feminismand all opportunistic and utilitarian meannessesThis bombastic program has been heralded by the Italian Futurists ever since 1909Fortunately they went no further than threatsbut they strove to attract attention and in this they gloriously succeededTheir attitude toward women was expressed in the motto Méprisez la femme Love for woman is an atavism and should be discarded into archivesWe chant hymns to the new beauty that has come into the world in our daysa hymn to swiftnessa doxology to motionWoman is justified in her existence inasmuch as she is a prostituteSensuality for the sake of sensuality is extolled as the only stimulus in human life its only aimOtherwise human beings are of no importanceat best as important as inanimate objectsThe suffering of a man is of the same interest to us as the suffering of an electric lampwhichwith spasmodic startsshrieks out the most heart rending expressions of colorThese aphorisms belong to the pen of Marinetti or to those of his discipleswho are but pigmies in comparison with their leaderThey greeted the war with Turkey in Tripolitania enthusiasticallyand Marinetti joyously witnessed the splendor of bayonets piercing human bodies and similar features of the great health giver warAt that time he began the cycle of his pictorial poems recently published in the Words at LibertyHere is one of his early descriptions A streamA bridgePlus artilleryPlus infantryPlus trenchesPlus cadaversDzangbah bakhCannonKha kh khaMitrailleuseTr r rSh sh sh shS s s s s sBulletsChillBloodSmokeThe Little Review To complete the character of Marinetti I shall quote his article in The London Daily Mail in which he states his profound disgust for the contemporary stage because it stupidly fluctuates between historic reconstructionpasticcio or plagiarismand a minutewearyingphotographic reproduction of actuality His ideal is the smoking concertcircuscabaretand night club as the only theatrical entertainment worthy of the true Futurist spirit The variety theater is the only kind of theater where the public does not remain static and stupidly passivebut participates noisily in action The variety showbrutally strips woman of all her veilsof the romantic phrasessighsand sobs which mark and deform herOn the other handit shows up all the most admirable animal qualities of womanher powers of attack and of seductionof treacheryand of resistance The variety theater isof courseantiacademicalprimitiveand ingenuousand therefore all the more significant by reason of the unforeseen nature of all its fumbling effortsThe variety theater destroys all that is solemnsacredearnestand pure in Art with a big AIt collaborates with Futurism in the destruction of the immortal masterpieces by plagiarizing themparodying themand by retailing them without styleapparatusor pityAt this point I am ready to agree with the Russian criticALunacharskywho thus defines Marinetti He combines in his personality the exoticism of an East African with the cynical blaguerie of a Parisian and the clownishness of a NeapolitanIn connection with the foregoing it is curious to observe the pranks of Marinetti s colleagues in the land of eternal contradictions RussiaThe Russian FuturistsEgo futuristsand Acmeistsvie with the Italians in noisiness and eccentricityand they have aroused an extensive pro and con polemicIn the last issue of Russkaja Mysl there is an interesting criticism of the Futurist poetry written by Valery BrusovThis foremost poetknown on the continent as the Russian Verhaerenbegan his literary career some fifteen years ago with the one line poem Ohconceal thy pallid legs This extremist is now ranked by the Futurists among the reactionariesBrusov is not hostile to Futurismalthough he opposes the contemporary bearers of its bannerIn a dialogue supposedly carried on between a Symbolist and a Futurist Brusov makes the latter say Tell mewhat is poetryThe art of wordsis it notIn what else does it differ from musicfrom paintingThe poet is the artist of wordsthey are for him what colors are for the painter or marble for your sculptorsWe have determined to be artists of wordsand only of wordswhich means to fulfill the true vocation of the poetYouwhat have you done with the wordYou have transformed it into a slaveinto a hirelingto serve your so called ideasYou have debased the word to a subservient rôleAll of youthe realists as well as the sympolistshave used words just as theAcademicianshave used colorsThose understood not that the essence of painting is in the combination of colors and linesand they have strived to express through colors and lines some meager ideas absolutely useless for commonly knownYou likewise have not understood that the essence of poetry lies in the combination of wordsand you have mutilated them by forcing them to express your thoughts borrowed from the philosophersThe futurists are the first to proclaim the true poetrythe freethe real freedom of wordsAnd sosince words have become enslaved and carryunfortunatelywithin them the ballast of established notions and conceptionsthe Futurists experiment in liberating the words of their accepted meanings by creating new wordsweird combinations of syllablesskilfulThe Little Reviewarrangements of sounds which defy translationFor the benefit of that part of mankind which does not understand Russian the Futurists invented a universal tongue which consists exclusively of single vowelsHere is a specimen under the title HeightsI give the original letters and

êh Do you feel the heightsThe poet doeshoweverand he proclaims in his defenseThe more subjective is truththe more objective is the subjective objectivity Brusov s point of view is expressed in the impassioned words of the historian of literature who appears at the end of the above mentioned dialogue In the new poetrythat isin the poetry of the last centuriesone observes a definite shifting of two currentsOne school puts forward the primary importance of the contentthe other that of form later the same tendencies are repeated in the two successive schoolsPseudo Classicismas a schoolplaced above all form not thewhatbut thehow The content they borrowed from the ancients and then performed the task most important in their eyes the elaboration of that materialThe Romanticistsin contradistinction to the Pseudo Classicistsinsisted first of all on the contentThey admired the middle agestheir yearning for an idealtheir religious aspirationsOf coursethe Romanticists contributed their did thisso to speakcasuallywhile actually they neglected the form of their verses recallif you willthe frolics of Musset or the carelessness of the poems of NovalisThe Parnassians once more proclaimed the primariness of formReproachless versebecame their mottoIt was they who declared that in poetry not the whatwas importantbut thehow and it was none other than Théophile Gautier who invented the formulaart for the sake of art The Symbolistic school again revived the contentAll this was in reality not so simpleschematicrectilinealas I expressed itTo be sureall true poets have endeavored to bring into harmony both content and formbuthave in view the prevailing tendency of the poetic school as a wholeIf my point of view is correctthen it is natural to expect that there is to come a new schoolreplacing the Symbolistswhich will once more consider form of primary importanceAt the appearance of a new school the doctrine of the old corresponding school becomes more subtlemore poignantmore extremeThe Parnassians went further than their progenitorsthe Pseudo ClassicistsIt is natural then to foresee that the new coming school will in its cult of form go further than the ParnassiansAs such a schooldestined to take the place of SymbolismI consider FuturismIts historic rôle is to establish the absolute predominance of form in poetryand to repudiate any content in it The weak point of Futurism appears to beas is the case with every revolutionary movementthe fact that alongside with the true fighters for new horizons straggle parasitic maraudersthat on the heels of the sincere searchers of artistic truth tread nonchalantly buffoons and charlatansThe number of the latter is so great that the true prophets drown in the vast sloughand the public sees but the caricature side of the movementTake for instancethe Post Impressionist and the Futurist paintersAny unbiased and open minded observer will admit that many of themlike Odilon RedonDuchampPicassoChabaudeven Matissehave created works whichwhether you like them or notpossess the sure criterion of art they stir youarouse your thoughts and emotionsYet how easy it is to smuggle into their midst colossal nonsense and counterfeit can be judged from the following episode The Little Review A group of young painters in Paris decided to arouse public opinion against the unrestricted accessibility of the Independent Salon by proving that among the exponents of the exhibition such an independent artist as a donkey could find a placeThe editors of Fantasia undertook to assist them in carrying out their planA manifesto was issued of which I quote a few pearlsTo art criticsTo paintersTo the public A manifesto of the school of the ExcessivistsHurrah Brother Excessivistshurrah Masters splendid and renascentwe are on the eve of various exhibitions of banal and stereotypical paintingsLet us smashthenthe palettes of our forefatherslet us set fire of joy to the pseudo masterpiecesand let us establish great canons destined to rule art henceforwardThe cannon is contained in one wordL excessivisme Excess in everything is a defect once said a certain assWe proclaim the reverseexcess at all timesin everythingis the absolute powerThe sun can never be too ardentthe sky too bluethe sea perspective too rubydarkness too blackas there can never be heroes too valiant or flowers too fragrantDown with contoursdown with halftonesdown with craftInstead dazzling and resplendent colors And so onBombastic phrases borrowed from Marinetti and his colleaguesThe manifesto is signed Joachim Raphael BoronaliBoronali is the anagram of Aliboron the French word for donkeyThe jesters later explained that they intended by the euphony of an Italian name to arouse with more certainty the admiration of the crowd The next step was to procure the services of Loloan old donkey well known to the artists on Montmartreas its stable is at the cabaret Lapin AgileThe following procedure is immortalized in an official protocolthe most unique document in the annals of art ProtocolProcès verbal de constat On the 8th of Marchbefore mePaul Henri Brionnemagistrate of the civil court of Parisin my office on rue du Faubourg Montmartre33appeared M of the periodical Fantasiowhose residence is in Parisboulevard Poissonière14and declaredEvery year there takes place an exhibition of various works of drawingpaintingand sculpture under the name of the Salon of the Independent Artists This exhibition is open for all paintersand unfortunatelyalongside with productions of high value there figure ridiculous works that have no signs of artIn order to show to what extent any work can be accepted in that exhibitionto the d lttriment of the meritorious productionshe intends to send there in the name of Fantasioa picture the author of which would be a donkeyThe picture will be entered in the catalogue under the title Et le soleil s endormit sur l Adriatiqueand signed JEBoronali For said reasons he asks me to be present at the painting of said picture in order to witness the process and draw an official report about itHaving consented to the requestI went in the company of Messrsthe editors of Fantasioto the cabaret du Lapin Agilewhere in front of said establishment Messrs set up a new canvas on a chair that took the place of an easelIn my presence they arranged paints bluegreenyellowand red to the tail extremity of the donkeywhich belongs to the owner of the cabaret Lapin Agilewas tied a paint brushThen the donkey was brought to the canvasand Mupholding the brush and the tail of the beast allowed her to daub in all directions taking care only of changing the paints on the brushI assured myself that the picture presented various tones passing from blue into green and from yellow into red without constituting anything definite and resembling nothingWhen the work had been finishedin my presence the picture and author were photographedThe names were not revealedThe Little Review In testimony of the aforesaid I have written and issued this protocol for legal useP BRIONNEFrom the photograph it may be seen that the donkey had been teased with some appetizing food held before his mouthto which tantalization the so called Boronali responded with the wags of his tail extremity according to the phraseology of the solemn documentThe picture then having been taken to the SalonMonsieur Boronali was asked to pay his membership feeand thenceforward his name figured among those of MatisseRousseauLe Fauconnierand other greatT o the astonishment of the Fantasia grouptheir prank remained unnoticed for some timethe critics spoke of Boronali s work along with the other picturesand the manifesto of the Excessivists was but slightly commented uponIn a series of sensational articles and piquant stories The Fantasia finally succeeded in drawing general attention to their chef d oeuvreThe Paris pressas well as the foreignopened a hot discussion on the significance of Boronali s work in a serious toneOnly the Kolnische Zeitung in a review of the manifesto and the picture carefully remarked If it is not a carnival jokereferring to the manifesto but not doubting the authenticity of Boronali s canvasTruethe title of the picture seemed mystifying why The Sun Asleep over the Adriaticwhen there were neither sun nor seaThe Gazette de France ridiculed the titleThe New York Heraldendeavoring to justify the name of the picturesuggested that the sun was asleep beneath the Adriatic an ingenious hypothesisThe Revue des Beaux Arts gave a detailed and scholarly account of the picturebut found in it nothing extraordinary in comparison with the other IndependentsThe hardest blow to Boronali s genius was dealt by De l Art Ancien et Modernewhich accused him of being banalAmong the cosmopolite crowdalong with MessrsGhéonKlingsorJamet struts the sheer banality of MBoronali The scandal that took place after the mystificators had revealed their trick is of secondary importanceWhat looms out of this incident is the dangerously vague line of demarcation between what is true art and what is mere daubery in FuturismThe Gaulois summed up the affair in a few significant wordsThe scholastics had maintained thatI t is much easier for the ass to disprove than it is for the philosopher to assert But here came an ass and proved something in spite of all the philosophers of the worldHe has proved not a priori but a posteriori that the most manifest daubery may pass as a picture in the eyes of those who accept the non realthe improbableand the absurd for new artThought uttered becomes an untruth Thaddeus TutchevThe Little Review 19 A Wonder Child Violinist MARGARET CANDERSON THE wonder child is not so much a wonderin Europe as in this country A t sevenyes even up to elevenperhaps a young German violinist who began to concertize at six once told me But after that there are so many and they all play so beautifulSo it is more common there and people think not so much of it And she went on to tell mewith the most wistful seriousnesshow at twelve she had felt suddenly so oppressed with age and weariness that for two years she had wanted not to play at allShe described it as a period when she wanted to stop feeling and run in the country all day and be only with animals But on the whole her theory seemed to be that it was the simplest thing in the world for a child to play well betterin some waysthan he will ever play later onand very likely it s trueThe newer psychologists have given us enough reason to think soIt still comes with something of a shock to us herehoweverand when we started for The Chicago Little Theatre one night two weeks ago to hear Master Ruby Davisaged twelvegive a violin recitalit was with the most excited anticipationsI had never heard a child play the violinSurely disappointment was inevitable A little boy walked quietly out on to the stagesmiling I heard afterward that some one had asked him if it didn t frighten him to face all those peopleOhno he saidI m going to play my violinHe had on a little soft white shirt and knickerbockersHis hair was almost auburn and curled away from his foreheadhis eyes were blue and his skin the softest whiteHis hands were the longslenderartistic type rather than the bluntheavy type which is quite as common among first rate violinistsAntoine that was all I could thinkAnd then he lifted his bow and swung into the Haendel Sonata in A with all the assurance of a masterIt was only a matter of seconds until you knew that he could not disappoint everhe knew how to feelA musician may commit all the crimes in the musical universeor he may play so flawlessly that you mar velbut none of it matters particularlyA phrase will tell you whether he is an artist the way the notes rise or fall or seem to be gathered up into that subtle thing which is the difference between efficient Playing and Music by the grace of GodRuby Davis makes MusicAnd how he loved doing itHe played a Canzonetta by Ambrosiaand the Jarnefelt Berceuseand other difficult things like the Pugnani Praeludiumand that Motto Perpetuo of Riesbeside the regulation Cavatina and the Dvor ik Humoresque every one of themin spite of small deficiencies that will be correctedwith a quality that is geniusAs nearly as I can register it this is the picture of him I shall rememberA little slendereagerswaying bodyand a great violin above which his face seemed worshippingHis eyes turned deep blue as flowers when he raised his head for some lovely soaring tone

that the earth is a living thingIt is as truly a live organism as any of the animals of which it is the motherLife could not have been evolved by or from it if there had not been life in itWe do not require an inexplicable miracle to account for the evolution of manwe can trace his pedigree back to an ancestry with fins and gillsand of course it stretches far beyond that comparatively recent stage in his developmentFrom the beginning of the world conditions have steadily grown more favorable to the habitation of the earth by the higher animalsSince man is a part of the earthwhat he himself has done to bring about this auspicious change may be credited to the mind or life resident in the earthThen there is essential goodness in the earthwhich is not saying that there is no evil in itThe world is a better place for a man to live in now than it was when his ancestors occupied dismal cavesIt is no illusion thatdesign or no designthe cosmic urge has been toward goodnessby which I mean an increasingly hospitable dwelling place for menThere have been recessionsand there will be othersbutapart from faith and hopeestablished facts compel the man who understands them to declare his absolute and unalterable certainty that the inexorable law of life s becoming greater than it is cannot be nullifiedSo thatregardless of all poverty and miseryof all that is unlovelyof all the blind and passionate class hatreds and sex quibbles the man who really thinks mustthink hopefullyThere is indeed themost ample justification of optimism The world is Godand the man whoworships it the

commercialism entails is the price which we have been fated to pay for experienceThrough commerce we are paving the way for the action of the world mind the collective thought of menCollective thinking precludes socialism as well as individualismand brings in humanismThe increasing complexity of civilizations symbolizes the enlarged intricacy of human lifeExperience and consciousness are

restricted to some fragment of our experience but informs the wholeso culture requires that life shall be beautiful down to the commonplace and homely things of the daily roundThe new programto which this modern insight pointsmeans a rebirth of our entire moral and social lifeWhy is itthenthat those who vocationally and constantly worship in the sanctuary of art the priests in this sanctuary often

grief to a real artistthis culture of the eccentric head and the more eccentric heartTherefore we need a man to free us from these eccentricitiesa man to lift us above these caricatures because he has himself put them beneath his feetThis man is Friedrich NietzscheThe sickness and the soundness of lifeboth these were in NietzscheIn his demand for an artistic culture he put his finger upon the wound of present humanityThis demand was acceptedthe meaning of the demand was lost sight ofThis was the fatality as if The Little ReviewNietzsche required a new artistic culture onlyand not at the same time a new life cultureBeauty the form of life indeedbut strengthwilldeedthe contentthat was the brave burden of the prophet s messageNietzsche was born into a time that marked the climax of a more

Hartmannit is not the worst possible worldit is the best possible worldbut it is worse than none And once Nietzsche called Schopenhauer his teacher went forth as an enthusiastic apostle of the message of passive resignation to the inevitable sorry scheme of thingsnayof the message that the world is the work of an anguished god seeking redemption from the infinite misery of existence by the infinite negation of lifeAnd surely the anguish of Nietzsche fitted himas no otherto be partner in distress of this anguished godSurely heif anyonecould sayTo this end was I born and for this purpose came I into the worldto bear witness to the body of this deathFrom his mother s womb was he set apart to sufferEndowed with a transcendent and superabundant fulness of spiritevery fresh and forceful impulse of his personality he felt as an indictment of the inexorable pitiless limitations within which his best innermost life was imprisonedHe was a voice crying in the wildernessnot only to menbut to himselfEach new flash of light which illumined his inner eye let him see the graves upon which he was treadingand revealed those who claimed to be alive in the mask of the death to which they had succumbedIn the abounding wealth of youth he felt a mortal sickness getting its grip upon himAs life dragged onhe felt more and more the hell tortures of pain from which he had to wring his work every hour of his existenceWho would have the effrontery to cast a stone at this man had he flung downThe Little Review 25 his arms into one of those gravesand cried with an old philosopherThis may all be very well for the godsbut not for meBut he did not lay down his armsFreed from all encumbrances of conscience and debilitating sense of sin which had paralyzed the Christianand from the Schopenhauer

subordinate men to institutionsand to apotheosize mediocrityNietzsche met pain with a power which transformed even death into lifeand turned the day of his death even into a festival of the soulHe taught himself and he taught others to believe in that powerwhich alone is great to believe in the Power of the WillNietzschelike Jesusproclaimed the inestimable worth of the individual mansaw for him

Bergstrom Mitchell KennerleyNew YorkFROM the northwhence Ibsen s Nora challenged the world as far back as 1879comes a fresh message of rebellionin the more radical figure of Karen BornemanIn judging this play of Bergstrom swhich has but now appeared in Edwin Bjorkman s translationwe must remember that it was written in 1907before we had grown so sophisticated concerning the rebel woman in her infinite manifestationsAnd yetbecause this vanguard of a new morality is still a slender companythe addition of a new member cannot fail to arouse a ripple of excitement in the watchful rank and fileFor that reasonas well as for some novel characteristics of her ownKaren Borneman merits a word for herselfBergstrom chose the most obvious method of contrast in projecting his heroine upon a background of stringent restraintHer father is Kristen Bornemana professor of theology whose chief interest in life is the propagation of the principles contained in his magnum opusMarriage and Christian MoralityHer mother is an apparently submissive woman who sometimes questions the edicts of her husbandHer brotherPeteris an adolescent youthalready awake to the conflict between the natural man and the unnatural economic systemand seemingly bound for destructionThoraher young sisteris already seeking out the clandestine outlet for an excessive and dangerous sentimentalityAnother sisterGertrudehas suffered a mental collapse and is confined in an insane asylumThese childrenthe author seems to sayare the results of a chafing restrictive disciplineand natural instincts gone wrong a conclusion weakenednot strengthened by over illustrationWhen four of a family of eight show signs of a similar abnormal development one suspects not only the disciplinary system but the purity of their inheritanceBe that as it maythe chief protagonistKarenis quite a normal person except in the matter of courageof which she possesses an inordinate amountBut then all new women are courageous to a faultShe is a woman of twenty eightmaturecultivatedand a successful professional writerHer most salient claim to consideration in the early scenes of the play is her quiet assurance in the right of her positionShe voluntarily opens up her past to the professedly liberal physician who seeks her handSome years ago I lived with a manYou are a widower yourselfYou may regard me as a widow or a divorced wife And when he spurns her action as squalorshe indignantly repliesDoctorhow dare youA phase of my life that at least to me is sacredand you cast reflections on itthat There is a brevitya tersenessabout her words that create greater sense of her power than would any amount of emotional pyrotechnicsIn the later scene with her father she is equally as simpleThe sum and substance of it is thisI have been married twice I meanThe Little Review 29that twice during my life with years between I have given myselfbody and soulto the man I lovedfirmly determined to remain faithful to him unto death Then follows the recital of the two love affairs the first with a brilliant but very poor journalist who died prematurelyand the other with a sculptorStrandgaardwhom she left on the discovery of his faithlessnessHer vision is of a time of greater freedom for self expression the day will come when wetoowill demand it as our right demand the chance to live our own lives as we choose and as we canwithout being held the worse on that accountOf courseI know that this is not an idealbut merely a makeshift meant to serve until at last a time comes which recognizes the right of every human being to continue its life through the race Her justification is the characteristic one I haveafter alllived for a time during those few years of youth that are granted us human beings only once in our lifetimeand that will nevernever come back againWhat have these other ones got out of their enforced duty and virtue except bitterness bitterness and emptinessI haveafter allfelt the fullness of life within me while there was still timeand I don t regret it The clash with her father whom she loves tenderly she accepts as inevitable in spite of the pain it must bring them bothThe ecstasy of a great vision softens to the note of personal loss as she leaves himYes I do pity youfatherDon t think my heart is made of stoneThe sorrow I have done you cannot be greater than the one I feel within myself at this momentwhen perhaps I see you for the last timeBut how can I help that I am the child of a time that you don t understandWe have never wanted to hurt each otherof course but I suppose it is the law of lifethat nothing new can come into the world without painBecause Karen advocates a course generally denoted by the termo f wretched connotationfree loveshe is not to be confused with those of lesser fineness who are fighting at her sideFor instancewith Stanley Houghton s heroine in Hindle WakesAnyone who sees in Karen another Fanny Hawthornehas failed to understand Karen s positionShe is a woman of culture and of ideals in all matters of lifeand especially in that of the sex relationshipI have given myself she saysto the man I lovedfirmly determined to remain faithful to him unto death This is a far cry from Fanny s reply to AlanLove you Good heavensof course not Why on earth should I love you You were just someone to have a bit of fun withYou were an amusement a lark To Karen the relationship is justified only by depth of passionand she entered it with as great a solemnity and glow of consecration as did ever a serious woman a church made marriageTo the many camp followers ofestablished feminismthose who don or doff their principles with the transient fashion to them Karen must seem a humorousif not a pitiable figureFor she dares to have beliefs and gallantly cleaves to themKarenthenis a new woman in the sense that in the moment of crisis she did not accept as inevitable the reply of conventionbut weighed her need against the lawandfinding the latter wantingfulfilled her need at the sacrifice of the lawOn the other handshe is not of those who break laws for the intrinsic pleasure of destructionOf course she admitsit would have been ever so much more easy for me ifwhile I was still youngsome presentable manwith all his papers in perThe Little Review feet order and a financially secure futurehad come and asked for me And she welcomes marriage with the good Doctor Schou in an attitude unpleasantly reactionaryI believe every woman who has reached a certain age and you know I am twenty eight willwithout hesitationprefer a limited but secure existence by the side of an honest man to the most unlimited personal freedomAnd worst of allshewho throughout the play declares herself unconvinced of guilt or stainat the close of the first act becomes quite mawkishly sentimental over Heine s pretty lineMay God forever keep you so fairand sweetand pure Because Karen exhibits these painful inconsistenciesshe is no less possible or real or worthwhile We who know many women emerging in diverse odd shapes from the travail of awakening have discovered just as inconsistent a combination of precipitation and reaction and thus will it ever be until we have at length worked out our way to the most serviceable harmonyIt is for this very reason that Karen is interesting she is no superwomanbut our own imperfect sisterOf the other characters there is but one deserving special commentKaren s motherwho to me is the most remarkable person Bergstrom has here createdShe confesses to her husband that she has known for three years that Karen had been living in Paris with Strandgaardbut had kept the knowledge to herself because it had been too late to interfereand because she did not regard the calamity as others would have in her placeFrom a terrible and bitter experience with another daughterGertrudewho had gone insane through the abrupt breaking off of a long engagement which had aroused primitive passion and left it unfulfilledMrsBorneman had reached a revolutionary conclusionfrom that day I have after a careful consideration done what I could to let our children live the life of youthsexually and otherwisein as much freedom as possibleThe result of your educational methodmy dear Kristenis our poor Gertrudewho is now con lined in an insane asylumas incurableThe result of my method is KarenI supposeI don t know if it is very sinful to say sobut I feel much less burdened by guilt than I should if conditions were reversedWhen Karenhoweverdefends her course as an abstract ideal of every human being to continue its life through the race and appeals to her mother to understandMrsBorneman retreats withI wash my hands of itKarenI don t dare to think that far It was her motherhood that had forced upon her the courage to overlook the lawand not any desire to throw over the old to set up a new lawThe glory of the new vision means nothing to her in comparison with her husband s suffering to which she herself has addedShe is the promise of a new type the awakened motherAs for the play as a wholeit appears to me that MrBergstrom has tried to say too much in the slight space of one short playfor he has two distinct themes the right of woman to love and lifeand the relationship between marriage and childrenThe first is the chief themewhich is worked out in the story of Karen the second is too important to be employed as a subsidiary threadand instead of adding richness to the first it rather clutters and confuses it with unnecessary baggageMrsBorneman pities one of her sons because he cannot afford to have children on his slender salaryand feels that her other son is not justified in blindly bringing child after The Little Reviewchild into the worlddepending upon the rest of the family for their maintenanceShe asks her husband So it is not enough for two people to live together in mutual love No Ceciliathat has nothing to do with marriageWhat is so inconceivably glorious about marriage is thatthrough itGod has delegated His own creative power to us simple human beings that He has made us share His own divine omnipotence The poor professor is made consistent to the point of absurdityand the main issue befoggedwhen he cries out to Karen And yet I could have forgiven you everything your wantonness and your defiance if you had taken the consequences and had a child If you had had ten illegitimate children better that than none at all But you have arrogantly defied the very commandments of naturewhich are nothing but the commandments of GodPerhaps this matter was included for the sake of Karen s reply Do you think I am a perfect monster of a womanwho has never felt the longing for a baby Not me does your anger hitbut that society which will not regard it as an inevitable duty to recognize the right of every human being to have children as a rightmark you and not as a privilege reserved for the richest and the poorestThere are thousands of us to whom the right is denied thousands of men as well as womenBut wetooare human beingswith love longings and love instinctsand we will not let us be cheated out of the best thing that life holdsTechnically the play is not so perfect a thing as MrBjorkman s unbounded encomiums would make us believeIt opensfor instancein the good old fashion scorned by Ibsen with the gossip of servantswho are here engaged in laying the table instead of in the time honored task of dustingThe whole action is cast within some eight hoursthus causing a use of coincidence to the straining pointThe most commendable feature of technique is the admirably sustained suspense the story of Gertrude overshadows the entire piece from the opening scene to MrsBorneman s avowal in the last actThe powerful use of the story as contrast to Karen s career is also unusualAnd yet in spite of its faults perhaps because of them we have found Karen Borneman the most stimulating play of the yearWe hope one of ourtwo organizations dedicated to the drama will put it on in the near futureWhen the ape lost his wits he became man Viacheslav IvanovThe Little Review Galsworthy s Little Human Comedy NO MAGAZINE that comes to this office is looked for more excitedly than Harper s WeeklyPoetry and Drama is a quarterly event that keeps us in a dignified intensity of expectationand there are othersBut Harper s is a weekly adventure in the interest of which we haunt the postmanAt present it is featuring a series of sketches by Galsworthy satirical characterizations of those human beings who pride themselves on being different Here is a man who knows himself for a philosopherhere is anartist here is one of those rare individualities so enlightenedso superiorso removedthat there is only one label for himThe Superlative But it is in The Philosopher that Galsworthy excels himselfIt is probably the most consummate satire that has appeared in the last decadeHe had a philosophy as yet untouchedHis stars were the old starshis faith the old faithnor would lie recognize that there was any otherfor not to recognize any point of view except his own was no doubt the very essence of his faithWisdomThere was surely none save the flinging of the door tostanding with your back against that doorand telling people what was behind itFor though lie did not know what was behindhe thought it low to say soAnatheist as he termed certain personswas to him beneath contemptan agnostic as he termed certain othersa poor and foolish creatureAs for a rationalistpositivistpragmatistor any other istwellthat was just what they wereHe made no secret of the fact that he simply could not understand people like thatIt was true What can they do save deny he would say What do they contribute to the morals and the elevation of the world1What do they put in place of what they take awayWhat have they gotto make up for what is behind that doorWhere are their symbolsHow shall they move and leave the peopleNohe saida little child shall lead themand I am the little childFor I can spin them a talesuch as children loveof what is behind the door Such was the temper of his mind that he never flinched from believing true what he thought would benefit himself and othersAmongst other things he held a crown of ultimate advantage to be necessary to pure and stable livingIf one could not say Listenchildrenthere it isbehind the doorLook at itshininggolden yoursNot nowbut when you dieif you are goodIf one could not say thatwhat could one sayWhat inducement hold outThis is merely the first paragraphThe rest is even betterSuch an analysis ought to extinguish the Puritan forever except that he won t understand itHe ll think it was aimed at his neighborHe knows any number of men like thatKnowledge or Prejudice A CRITIC writes us that he finds no fault with freedom of speechand that Emma Goldman s disregard of ordinary moral laws and blasphemy of religion do not destroy the fact that she existsBut such an article about her as appeared in our last issue is well calculated to make us appear absurdhe thinksit sounds like the oration of some one who is just beginning to discover the things that the world has known always and he closes with this deliciously naive question D o you believe in listening respectfully to advocates of free loveandbecause of their daringapplauding them Yeswe believe in listening respectfully to any sincere programmewe believe that is the only way people get to understand thingsWe even believe in listening seriously to insincere programmesbecause the insincere person usually thinks he is sincere and helps one to understand even moreBy doing all these tilings one is likely to reach that altitude whereto understand all is to forgive all As for advocates of free lovewe recall the impatient comment of a well known woman novelist When will people stop using that sillysuperfluous phrasefree love We don t talk about cold ice or black coal Andthough our applause was not confined to Emma Goldman s daringThe Little Review as our critic would probably concedeis not daring a thing worthy of applauseJust as conflict is better than mediationor suffering than securitydaring is so much more legitimate an attitude than complacencyBut it is that remark aboutthings the world has known always which exasperates us the mostThe world has not known them alwaysit doesn t know them nowIt has heard of them vaguely just to the point of becoming prejudiced about themAnd prejudice is the first element that sneaks away when knowledge begins to developIf the world represented by our critic knew these things it might be roused to daringtooRupert Brooke s Visit RUPERT BROOKE was in Chicago for a few days last monthOne of the most interesting things to us about his visit was that he so quickly justified all the theories we have had about him since we first read his poetryFirstthat only the most pristine freshness could have produced those poems that some people have been calling decadentsecondthat while he probably is the most beautiful young man in England it was rather silly of MrYeats to add that he is also the wearer of the most gorgeous shirts Because Rupert Brooke doesn t wear gorgeous shirts he appears to have very little interest in shirtsas we expectedHe is too concerned with the big business of life and poetryHe isas a very astute young member of our staff suggestedsomehow like the sea Books and the Quiet LifeGEORGE GISSING has always had a peculiarly poignant place in our galaxy of literary favoritesand nowhere have we loved him more than in that little autobiography which he called The Private Papers of Henry RyecroftThe portions of that book which have to do specifically with books and reading have been brought together by MrWaldo RBrowne and published with MrMosher s usual incomparable tasteA good many people have loved books as well as George Gissing didperhapsbut very few of them have been able to express that love like this The exquisite quiet of this roomI have been sitting in utter idlenesswatching the skyviewing the shape of golden sunlight upon the carpetwhich changes as the minutes passletting my eye wander from one framed print to anotherand along the ranks of my beloved booksI have my home at lastWhen I place a new volume on my shelvesI sayStand there whilst I have eyes to see youand a joyous tremor thrills meFor one thingI know every book of mine by its scentand I have but to put my nose between the pages to be reminded of all sorts of thingsI regard the book with that peculiar affection which results from sacrificein no drawing room sense of the wordDozens of my books were purchased with money which ought to have been spent upon what are called the necessities of lifeMany a time I have stood before a stallor a bookseller s windowtorn by conflict of intellectual desire and bodily needAt the very hour of dinnerwhen my stomach clamored for foodI have been stopped by sight of a volume so long covetedand marked at so advantageous a pricethat I could not let it goyet to buy it meant pangs of famineMy Heyne s Tibullus was grasped at such a momentIt lay on the stall of the old book shop in Goodge Street a stall where now and then one found an excellent thing among quantities of rubbishSixpence was the price sixpenceAt that time I used to eat my mid day mealof coursemy dinnerat a coffee shop in Oxford Streetone of the real old coffee shopssuch as nowI supposecan hardly be foundSixpence was all I had yesall I had in the world it would purchase a plate of meat and vegetablesBut I did not dare to hope that the Tibullus would wait until the morrowwhen a certain small sum fell due meI paced the pavementfingering the coppers in my pocketeyeing the stalltwo appetites at combat within meThe book was bought and I went home with itand as I made a dinner of bread and butter I gloated over the pages34 The Little Review New York LetterGEORGE SOULEBELLOC is coming to America next fall for a lecturing tourIt is well to take stock of himso that we shall know what to expectHe is cleverand a Catholic that tells the whole storyWe don t know exactly how he will say itbut we know what he will sayThrough various smiling subtleties and paradoxes he will attack democracyfeminismsocialismindividualistic rebellion of any kindIt is quite possible that he will aim a few careless shots at Montessorithe discussion of sex questions in publicGalsworthyand Bernard ShawHe is a masculineEnglishAgnes RepplierHe will entertain his cultivated audiencesand give them the impression that he is very modern and daringIt is curious how the thinking mind immediately discounts the testimony of one who is known to have given his allegiance to an embracing authority of any kindWhether the authority in question is the VaticanKarl MarxBusinessNietzscheor Theodore Rooseveltwe know the man s whole mind is likely to be colored with itand that the evidence is probably of less importance to him than his caseYet there is always a moral suspicion against the man who refuses to enroll himself under any bannerHe seems deadinhumanacademicMarch to the drumssalute the colorsor admit there is no blood in you It is good that most of mankind does soThe strongest armynot necessarily the largestwill winand the battle must come for the sake of the victoryThereforelet the radicals welcome MrBelloc as a good enemyHe standsfor a sincerehighly organizedand powerful propaganda which cannot be ignored on the modern battlefieldOn account of their worship of authority the Catholics have a solidarity which no other movement can boastFor the same reason they are doomed to an eternal enmity with adventurous soulsthose who fight for change of any kindThey seem often to be in accord with advancing thinkers because they condemn present conditionsBut closer investigation will always show that instead of pointing to the future they cling to the pastMgrBensonduring his recent visit to New Yorkstated in private conversation that present social conditions are intolerableHe went on to say that an ideal society can be attained only under feudalismwith the church in controlThere will be no more danger from the Catholics than from any other army as long as we know what they are fighting forand are able to recognize their irregular troopsBut let there be no complacency among the enemies of the church on the ground that it may not be really in the fieldor has not artillery when it gets thereWithout investigation of any kindI have heard of two books attacking the church which were suppressed by their publishers at the demand of Catholic authoritiesIn each case the weapon was a threat to withdraw an extensive text book business from the house in questionNaturallythe parties to the matter have not been anxious to give it publicityA magazine which published an article displeasing to Catholics received a letter threatening it with blackThe Little Review 35listingThere appears to be a well organized and efficient church publicity bureau to attend to these and other mattersA proposal was recently made by a Catholic journal that priests in confessional impose as penance the subscription to Catholic papers and the purchase of Catholic booksat the same time warning the people against secular publicationsThis was discussed with some approval by Americathe New York Jesuit weeklywhich regretfully admittedhoweverthat in the end Catholic publications must depend mainly on their merit We are likely to ignore such mediaeval methods until we find them obstructing some actual movement of importanceThey do obstruct such movementshoweversometimes very annoyinglyAll these methods are but the natural and blameless working of the doctrine of intoleranceAnd perhaps their greatest danger is that their temporary success will induce the opposing armies to use the same weapon and so shackle themselvesThe intolerance of the Puritan was a natural result of his bitter struggleyet it produced a century of aesthetic darknessThe advanced opponents of the Puritan era are now uttering pronunciamentos and personalities that are Archiepiscopal in their intoleranceButyou sayintolerance is necessary in the soldierHe must hate his enemy and seek not only to dislodge but to silence his opponentWellI will admit that when the soldier is in battle he must shoot to killBut there is a new kind of soldier developing who is more valuable to man than the oldHe joins the army not so much because of the magic of the colors as because of the necessity of the cause and its temporary usefulness in serving the truth behind itJust as he will not march to war without reasonsohe will stop fighting his immediate enemy when his cause is wonand will not go on to bickering and pillageHe is ready to enlist under a new banner at any moment when a new banner represents a more glorious cause than the oldHis General is not a godbut a leaderHis freedom of choice is always the biggest asset of his strengthTherefore he cannot be intolerantHe is stronghardefficientrelentlessbut never pompous or slavishHow much time the world has lost eliminating armies of strong men whose fatal fault was excessiveunreasoning loyalty Thatafter allsolves the riddle of my second paragraphAnd if the soldier must subordinate his cause to his truthhow much more so the General and the KingThe General has very little time to hate his enemyHe must know their strengthstudy their methodsadopt the best of their ideasspy out the countryplan a campaignHe orders slaughter not for revenge or hatredbut for successTherefore it is of supreme importance that his success be worth whileAnd the Kingthe man who selects the cause and fires men to battleThe nearer he comes to an assertion of infallibility the surer is the final defeat of his causeIf he will allow no room for change and growthchange and growth will sweep him asideWe need big men who will not enlist under colorsbut are always pushing back the horizon of truthDistrust the leader who has found the final answer to the riddleSome day shall we not have a Messiah who shall begin by saying D o not found in my name any churchcultor schoolIf a man question my messagelisten to him closely and learn what truth he hasAlways seek the newthe more perfectAlways grow out from the fixedSo shall you begin a race of Kings greater than I The Little

presentation of things as they are seen by our physical eye is photographynot artYet there exists a Symbolistic school in contradistinction to other currents such as RealismImpressionismNeoRomanticismetcIs not this a misnomerCan we sayfor instancethat Beaudélaire s Fleurs du Mal were symbolswhile Goethe gave us but realistic reproductions of actual lifeShould we exclude Whitman from the Symbolists for the reason that his poems are less fantasticnearer to life than those of PoeWhat about Vereshchagin was not his brush symbolistic because he adhered to realistic methodsObviouslyan artist presents not objectsThe Little Review 39but ideasand the symbolisticity of a certain work of art is rather a question of method and degreePerhaps we should differentiate artists according to their relationship with and attitude towards the publicThe realist and under this elastic term we may understand likewise the romanticist and the impressionist is definite in his interpretation of lifeis outspoken and clear in conveying his conceptions he drags us unto his point of viewmakes us see through his eyes and take for granted his impressionsHe says to usThus I see the worldThus life and nature are reflected in my mindThis is precisely what I mean please do not misinterpret me We are bound to obey the artist provided he is a real artist forces upon us his eyeglassesand we follow his directionsThe purely Symbolistic artiston the other handgrants freedom to the publicVague tonesdim outlinesabstract figuresimperceptible moodsmisty reflectionsmake his art unyielding to a definite interpretationAll he imposes upon us is an atmosphereinto which we are invited to come and co createHere is a canvashere are colorshere are moods go ahead and make out of them what you likeWe are thus left to our own guidance we are enabled to put our ego into the artist s workwe are free to find in it whatever reflections we choose and to form our own conceptionsIf we succeed in solving the problemif we make the symbol live in our imaginationwe experience the bliss of creation should we fail in our taskshould the symbol remain meaningless to uswe conclude that

go beyond a certain point in developing a knowledge of whence we cameClara ELaughlinin writing a review of The Truth about Womanby MrsWalter MGallichanaccuses the writer of possessing a short sightedastigmatic vision of whereuntoness She winds up her discussion with the sob of an ultra religionist by accusing MrsGallichan of having left out a most important point in her discussion that of the immortality of the soulT o quote Miss Laughlin exactly But ifas most of us believewe are more than just links in the human chainif we have a relation to eternity as well as to history and to posteritythere are splendid interpretations of our struggles that MrsGallichan does not apprehendIf souls are immortallife is more than the perpetration of speciesor even than the improvement of the raceit is the place allotted to us for the development of that imperishable part which we are to carry henceand through eternityAnd any effort of ours which helps other souls to realize the best that life can giveto seek the best that immortality can perpetuatemay splendidly justify our existenceVery fortunately for the future of her bookMrsGallichan ignores the religionist except to say of religionI am certain that in us the religious impulse and the sex impulse are one MrsGallichan s book is a scientific discussion of woman yesterday and todaywithout any attempt at sentimentalismHer analysis is perfect and decidedly constructiveShe goes back to prehistoric times and discusses in scientific phraseology how woman has progressed through the agesand describes the part she has taken in establishing civilizationsNowhere does she forget that she is writing for posterity and indulge in the petty foibles that are sometimes so noticeable in the work of women who write on feminismLEE ASTONE The question of whether whatever it is that is meant by the word soul is immortal immortal in the sense that it will live forever in a realm of the spirit or the blessed is answered affirmatively by those who hold to the orthodox faithis not worth discussing by a rational man who is informedand is discussed by avowed or implied atheists with a fanatical seriousness that destroys whatever force their main contention may haveThe legitimate domain of argument is limited truth that is verifiable by men here and now is its only contentAs regards what uncritical people call immortality serious argumentation is absolutely impossibleFaithquotationsand personal desires are not argumentsMrsGallichan s book is in parts scientificand is therefore of importance to thousands of people whose religion is an achievement of courageous thinking and livingTo many excellent persons their professed belief in what they termimmortalityis a kind of merciful necessityThey crave and even invent assurances of itTo such persons there is no argument against itTo persons who produce thenegativearguments there is no argument for itAnd there you areWCD The Little Review Book Discussion Dostoevsky Pessimist The Possessedby Fyodor Dostoevsky The Macmillan CompanyNew York Shatov was an incorrigible idealistwith a keen satirical ability to destroy his own idealsHe had made a god out of Verhovenskythe leading figure in Dostoevsky s The PossessedVerhovensky washe imagineda god of selfish courage and supreme unconcernthe sort of man whom everybody followed involuntarilyShatov knew that his hero had irreparably injured three womenone of them half witted and defenselessThat did not bother the idealist at all it was in character But when Verhovensky lied about it to avoid condemnationShatov hit him a savage blow on the cheek and brooded for weeks over the disappointmentThe disappointment was deepened by the fact that Verhovensky did not kill him for the blowThere is something characteristically Russian about thatIt goes far to explain Russian pessimismand give the key to this very bookYour Russian wants above all things to be logicalHe will fasten upon an idea and enshrine it in his holy of holiesHe will relentlessly follow the dictates of his idea though it lead him to insanityThere is greatness in his attitudealso absurdityWitness TolstoyAnd when he recognizes his own absurdity he becomes gloomy and savage there is no escape from the vanity of the worldthe spiritand himselfI can imagine the mood of Dostoevsky when this book germinated in his mindHe saw this trait in the people about himhe felt it in himselfThe intellectualseach with his little theorywere steadily working towards nothing at allThe government with its elaborate systems for economic improvement and individual repressionthe revolutionary with his scheming insincerity and chaotic programwere equally futileThe women with their pathetic lovesthe frivolous with their mad pursuit of amusementthe great and the smallthe sycophant and the rebelwere all bitter failuresSuddenly it occurred to him they are all mad in an insane worldeach in his wayone no more than anotherI will vent my disgust with these vermin in a bookI will show what they really areLike the madman who carefully traces out his meaningless labyrinth1 will with the most painstaking psychology unravel their mindsand in so doing I will find my release and my fiendish joyThe only thing lacking in this madhouse is complete self consciousnessThat I will furnishAnd so Dostoevsky logically and nobly followed his idea to its insane conclusionThe fascinating result cannot be described in a paragraphIt is doneof coursewith consummate abilityBeginning the book is like walking into a village of unknown peopleThey are real enough outwardly you don t know their nature or directionLittle by little you learn about themand begin to take sidesLong habit makes you pick favoritesThis man will be noble and successfulperhaps he is the heroSuddenly you begin to suspect that someThe Little Review thing is wrongAll things are not working together for one endas in well regulated novelsYour favorites become jumbled up with the othersThe author doesn t give you a chancebecause he never shows you a cross section of a mindHe merely tells what the people do and sayYou must draw your own conclusions as in ordinary lifeWhen you get used to thisyou see an occasional subtletya flash of sardonic laughterSome of the people are not quite right in their mindsAnd at length the truth dawns the sane people are even crazier than the others This impression comes by sheer force of magichow the author creates it is inexplicableBut once you have itthe fascination of following an idea obsesses youAnd at the end it is impossible to find any meaning or direction in the worldOf courseno such obsession can find a firm footing in the American temperamentAfter a while it seems Russian and incredibleIf you can t answer Dostoevsky logicallyyou will abandon logicBut he has stirred you upand certain important conclusions rise to the surfaceOne is that it would be impossible to be such a pessimist unless one looked for a good deal in the worldand looked for it rather sharplyIdealism and courage began this course of thoughtIsn t a big share of our optimism shallowShouldn t we go a little deeper into things before being so sure they are right Another is that no living individual is worth very muchafter allOur only salvation is in creating a nobler raceAnd for that any sacrifice of present individuals is supremely worth whileIt is as if some inspired member of a negro tribe in central Africa had suddenly awakened to the fact that his voodoo worshipping friends were not acting

citadelThe fifty thousand are practically EnglandPerhaps his estimate is too lowJohn Brisben Walker says that in the United States the number of persons able to think independently about political and social matters has increased from a few score to about two hundred and fifty thousand within thirty yearsThe fact isalbeitthat the world has been fashioned always by this very small minorityFurthermore the present creation is not one in which there is reason for great prideThe essay on the Great State is especially fine in this connectionWells s idea of the Normal Social Life and of the constant divergence of a minority is altogether clarifying for the watcher from any vantagebut it is in his discussion of the labor unrest that the reader in Colorado discovers the prophecies he most needsFor illustration thisThe worker in a former generation took himself for granted it is a new phase when the toilers begin to asknot one man here and therebut in massesin battalionsin trades Why thenare we toilersand for what is it that we toil The ruling minority in Colorado has been confronted with this question during the coal strikeSo far no response has been given save the impromptu utterances of a hideous rage and fright at the thought of awakening workersWells answers his own questionsHe replies as Colorado will sometime if Colorado is to persistIt is in this tone The supply of good temperedcheap labor upon which the fabric of our contemporary ease and comfort is erected is giving outThe spread of information and the means of presentation in every class and the increase of luxury and self indulgence in the prosperous classes are the chief cause of thatIn the place of the old convenient labor comes a new sort of laborreluctantresentfulcriticaland suspiciousThe replacement has already gone so far that I am certain that attempts to baffle and coerce the workers back to their old conditions must inevitably lead to a series of increasingly destructive outbreaksto stresses and disorder culminating in revolutionIt is useless to dream of going on now for much longer upon the old lines our civilizationif it is not to enter upon a phase of conflict and decaymust begin to adapt itself to the new conditionsof which the first and foremost is that the wage earning laboring classconsenting to a distinctive treatment and accepting life at a disadvantageis going to disappearThat is the truth which men hate most to hearIt is the doctrine whichMotherJones preaches and for which she has been imprisoned regardless of laws and constitutionsBut this reasonableness of Wells appeals as little to the left wing of the socialists as it does to conservativesThe IWWs have no patience with the detailed delays suggested and Wells is as irritated with the losses in civiliza 44 The Little Review tion to which a violent revolution is likely to leadHe sets forth his feeling in a discussion of the American populationa curious phrasenecessary on account

with meI told them the truthI knew it for the truth thenand I know it for the truth nowFRANK NORRISIt would seem inevitable that had Frank Norris lived he would have rewritten Vandover and the BruteIn the bookas it was rescued from the packing box that had been through the San Francisco fire and sent to the publisherthere is much that would have been discarded by the later NorrisPerhaps he would have thrown it all away and written a new story with the same themeHe was a big man and he had the courage of bignessHe could throw fairly good work into the waste paper basketThe decay of man in modern societythe slow growth in him of the brute that goes upon all fours what a bigterrible theme What a book the later Norris would have made of itIn the introduction by Charles GNorris quotation is made from the Frank Norris essayThe True Reward of theThe Little Review 45Novelistin which this sentence stands out To make money is not the province of the novelist Also it is suggested that the book was written under the influence of Zolaand there is more than a hint of Zola s formula that everything in life is material for literature in the way the job is doneAs it standsVandover wants cutting cutting and something elseWith that said and understoodwe are glad that the book has been rescued and that it can stand upon our book shelvesAmerican letters cannot know and understand too much of the spirit of Frank Norrisand just at this time when there is much talk of the new note and some little sincere effort toward a return to truth and honesty in the craft of writtingit is good to have this visit from the boy NorrisHe was a brave ladan American writing man who livedworkedand died without once putting his foot upon the pasteboard road that leads to easy moneyThe easy money is not for us he said and hadthe manhood to write and live with that warning in his mindHe had craft loveWith a few more writers working in his spirit we should hear less of the new noteNorris was the new noteHe was of the undying brotherhoodWhen Frank Norris wrote Vandover he was not the great artist he becamebut he was the great man and that s why this book of his is worth publishing and readingThe greater writer would have possessed a faculty the boy who wrote this book had not acquired the faculty of selectionHe would have been less intent upon telling truly unimportant details and by elimination would have gained dramatic strengthRead Vandover therefore not as an example of the work of Norris the artist but as the work of a true manIt will inspire youIts very rawness will show you the artist in the makingIt will make you understand why Frank Norris with Mark Twain will perhapsamong all American writersreach the goal of immortalityThe Immigrant s Pursuit of Happiness They

Family Notes of a Son and Brotherby Henry James Charles Scribner s SonsNew York Whatever the deprecators of Henry James s later manner may have to say about the difficulties of his involved style there are some situationssonic plotsfor which it is most happily suitedWas so haunting a ghost story ever written as that truly horrible one which involved two children the name of which has unfortunately escaped mefor I should like to recommend it for nocturnal perusalAnd in The Golden Bowl the gradual way you are led to perceive the wrong relationship between two of the characterswhichhad it been offered bluntlywith no five degrees of approach and insinuationwould have lost half its mystery of guiltAs he himself saysin the Notes of a Son and BrotherI like ambiguitiesand detest great glares Unfortunatelythe style that is fitting to a slow unfolding of a psychological situation does not lend itself well to biographyThe direct way is the only possible way thereif the reader is to keep an unflagging interestand the direct way is simply not possible for Henry JamesAnd one asks nothing more than to be told simply of the manyand the life afterward at Newportjust as the Civil War was beginning or best of all throughout the story of a united family the four boyslittle sisterfathermotherand auntquite unlikeI imagineany other family in the worldThe quality of the genius of the brothers seems to have sprung from the association with a father as unlike as possible to the American father of todayHe did not influence themwe are toldby any power of verbal persuasion to his own ideasIt was quite simply himselfhis personality and characterthe way he lived lifethat took hold upon his sonsimaginationOf course that is the only way anyone ever is influencedbut I think most parents do try the verbal persuasion as wellHenry James says of his fatherI am not sureindeedthat the kind of personal history most appealing to my father would not have been some kind that should fairly proceed by mistakesmistakes more humanmore associationalless angularless hard for othersthat is less exemplary for themsince righteousnessas mostly understoodwas in

have left us with our small savingour little exhibitions and complacenciesrather on our handsSpeaking of thedetachedfeeling they had after returning from Europe to settle in Newporthe says I remember well howwhen we were all young togetherwe hadunder pressure of the American ideal in that matterthen so rigidfelt it tasteless and even humiliating that the head of our little family was not in businessSuch had never been the case with the father of any boy of our acquaintancethe business in which the boy s father gloriously was stood forth inveterately as the very first note of our comrade s impressivenessWe had no note of that sort to produceand I perfectly recover the effect of my own repeated appeal to our parent for some presentable account of him that would prove us respectableBusiness alone was respectable if one meant by itthat isthe calling of a lawyera doctoror a ministerwe never spoke of clergymenas wellI think if we had had the Pope among us we should have supposed the Pope in businessjust as I remember my friend Simpson s telling me crushinglyat one of our New York schoolson my hanging back with the fatal truth about our credentialsthat the author of his being was in the business of stevedoreThat struck me as a great card to play the word was fine and mysterious so thatWhat shall we tell them you aredon t you see could but become on our lips at home a more constant appealVery interesting are the occasional letters telling of Emerson and CarlyleEspecially so to me are the side lights on Carlyleas chiming in somehow with the series of impressions I seem gradually to have accumulated about him as time goes onPerhaps it really isn t fairas a large amount of those impressions I feel sure I owe to Froudebutcan t help wondering what our timeswith modern surgery and therapeuticswould have accomplished with Carlyle s indigestionand what resultant difference there would assuredly have been in his philosophyT o quote from a letter of the elder Henry James I took our friend M to see himCarlyle and he came away greatly distressed and désillusionnéCarlyle having taken the utmost pains to deny and descry and deride the idea of his having done the least good to anybodyand to professindeedthe utmost contempt for everybody who thought he hadand poor Mbeing intent on giving him a plenary assurance of this fact in his own caseAnd again in a letter to Emerson Carlyle nowadays is a palpable nuisanceIf he holds to his present mouthing ways to the end he will find no showman là bas to match himCarlyle s intellectual pride is so stupid that one can hardly imagine anything able to cope with itAn earlier letter has this delicious bit about HawthorneHawthorne isn t to me a prepossessing figurenor apparently at all an enjoying personBut in spite of his rusticity I felt a sympathy for him fairly amounting to anguishand couldn t take my eyes off him all dinnernor my rapt attention It was heavenly to see him persist in ignoring the spectral smiles in eating his dinner and doing nothing but thatand then go home to his Concord den to fall upon his knees and ask his heavenly Father why it was that an owl couldn t remain an owl and not be forced into the diversions of a canaryAnd in the postcript of the same What a worldwhat a worldBut once we get rid of Slavery the new heavens and the new earth will swim into realityWhich shows how much in earnest the Abolitionists really were it was a tenet of faith with themSad and strangeThe Little Review 49and illuminating to us of a later generationwho are now struggling for other abolitions of slaveryand still hoping for a new worldI wish I could quote from the delightful letters of William Jamesbut they must be read entirewith the author s commentsto place them correctlyPending a biography of the manthese letters will be to many readers the mostinteresting feature of the bookOne of the most magnificent things about the bookhoweverif I may use a large word

history of American letters De Morgan s Latest When Ghost Meets Ghostby William De Morgan Henry Holt and CompanyNew York Whatever else I may say about De Morgan s new bookI absolutely refuse to tell the number of its pagesEvery other criticism begins or ends with this uninteresting factand usually adds that it makes no difference how long it issince the writer s charm pervades it allBut it does make a differenceand it is too trite to say we are so hurried and nervous and given over to frivolity nowadays that we are unable to read Dickens and Thackeray and Scott and De MorganThere is a great deal more to readand a great deal more to do and to think aboutthan ever there was in Thackeray s dayAnd if we are going to spend our time reading countless pagesI very nearly told how manyafter all we want to be sure it is more worth while than anything else we can be doingor thinkingor readingHoweverone can t say very well that he greatly admires a storkor would if he had a short beak and short legsDe Morgan s style is his ownand he will tell the story his own waythough we all have a quarrel with him for leaving the most interesting bits to a short Pen driftat the endDid Given s lover contemplate taking his East Indian poison when the newspapers announced that she was to marry an Austrian nobleThink of cutting that episode off in a few wordswhile an entire chapter is devoted to a shortage of mud for little Dave and Dollywho were making a dyke in the street But thenDe Morgan doesn t know how to stop when he begins to talk of childrenHow he loves themand all other helpless creatures He can t speak even of kittens without a touch of tenderness MrsLapping explained that she was using itthe basketto convey a kittenborn in her establishmentto Miss Druitt at thirty four

admit the wisdom of the Janus basketShe knew how difficult it is to be even with a kitten It is bits like this that make MrDe Morgan s story so longand it is bits like this that reconcile us to its lengthI believe most readers won t care greatly whether the two poor old sisters who have been separated so many years ever do meet againThere is no feeling of climax when they do merely relief that the thing has finally been put acrossIt was beginning to look as if it never would happen and though the reader himselfas I saydoesn t greatly carehe can see that De Morgan doeshe has apparently been doing his best to bring it aboutbut the cantankerous ones just wouldn t let himOn the other handwho can help loving Given othe Towers all sweetnessbeautyand lightOnly isn t she really more of a

quite the most fascinating part of the book tells us of the daughter of this union Cicelyby this time sixteen years oldYou know says the girlCiswho is new and naturally knows thingsand can tell her parents yo u know there is never the slightest reason for apprehension as long as there is no delusionEven then we have to discriminate carefully between fixed and permanent delusions andShut upMouse says her father What s that striking The young lady saysWellI got it all out of a book One good reason for reading De Morgan is the fact that he is older than the majority of his readersWe read so muchwe hear so much acclaimed that is written by children of twentywhose experience of life must necessarily be gotlike Cicely sout of a book The saying of De Maupassant surely applies here that the writer must sit down before an object until he has seen it in the way that he alone can see itDe Morgan has had the opportunity of seeing lifesurelyand knowing what most of it amounts toThe result is a large tolerance and tenderness toward his fellow menMHP The Little Review 51The Economics of Social Insurance Social InsuranceWith Special Reference to American Conditionsby IMRubinow Henry Holt and CompanyNew York The logic of events is rapidly forcing nation after nation into what has hitherto been damned with the epithet paternalismAmericaperhapsis the last important country in the world to face the problems raised by the march of events in this directionSocial insurancea thing accomplished and a commonplace of government functioning in so many countriesrecently adopted in Englandisin this countrystill a novelty outside the university class room and the lecture halls of fanatical demagogues who wish to upset the foundations of our civil government and civilization as the elder politicians express it when their attention is drawn to these sinister activities of thoughtThe author of this book in fact was the first academic lecturer on the subject to give a university course in the various forms which social insurance has takenThese lectures he delivered before the New York School of Philanthropyand they are reprinted here in an extended formAfter giving the philosophy of the matterthe underlying social necessity for insurancethe author takes up the various forms of the activityAccidentdiseaseold ageand unemployment must all be provided againstand the statethe employerand the laborer may share the burden among themor the two latter may be relieved as in various types of non contributory insuranceOf course the old school economist will ask why the latter two are not relievedand why the employe or private citizen is not just encouraged to insure with a private corporationThe author s answer is thateven if he were educated to the point of desiring to do thathe could notA man insures his house because the feeling of security is worth the small premium he payseven if that premium is larger than the actual risk involved would warrant larger by a sum equal to the cost and profits of the business of the insurance companyBut the poor man s chances of loss of employmentaccidentor sickness are so much greater in proportion to the capitalized value of his job that he could never afford to pay the premium necessary for a private company to take care of himwhile his old age could not be insured without taking all of his earnings and even then he might die before he reached itThe situation then is that an admitted necessity cannot be obtained unless the state as a whole takes steps to attain it for all the members of the stateHow other states have done thishow type after type of insurance has been evolvedand how these types may be adapted to American practice is the burden of the present workThe author writes in a clear and nontechnical mannerand makes no extravagant claims for what some people may regard as a social panacea but he is confident that the full development of the idea of social insurance will relieve the worst aspects of poverty the aspects in which poverty is not only a hardshipbut a haunting spiritsapping the vitality of its victims until they are rendered socially uselessLLEWELLYN JONES 52 The Little Review
