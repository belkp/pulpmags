not bother to answerI will point merely to a recent article on Joyce in The Futurean English periodicalnot to be confused with Die Zukunjt The author saysand I think with reasonthat where ever Joyce has made use of liceor dungor other disgusting unpleasantness he has done so with the intentionand withas a considerable artistthe result of heightening some effect of beautyor twisting tighter some other intensityThe metal finish alarms peopleThey will no more endure Joyce s hardness than they will Pound s sterilized surgeryThe decayed lily verbiage which the Wilde school scattered over the decadence is much more to the popular tasteVomitcarefully labledBeauty is still in the literary marketand much sought after in the provincesI am not throwing that into contrast with Joyce s novelsI have a much finer questionand one which I probably waste in sending youIt is of the contrast between Gautier and Beaude laireso we are well up beyond the Wilde levelI take it that art rises in some measure in proportion to its inimitabilityeven its untranslabilityAnd I have never yet found Gautier in Englishnor do I see any ready means of saying Le squelette etait invisible Au temps heureux de l art paienL Hommesous la forme sensibleetcin English The skeleton was invisible in the happy era of pagan art is felicitiousit is better thanhappy timeorhappy dayserahas come to as I write thisafter years of thought on the matterBut I am not ready to translate Gautier into EnglishBeaudelaire hadwe presumeamessage He had also a function in the French verse of his timeThe poetic language had grown stiffeven Gautier is less miraculous if one consider the tradition of French eighteenth century writingthe neatness of Bernard whom Voltaire addresses asGentile dont la muse fecondedoit faire encore delices the tone of Si tu ne peux vivre Sans un Apollon12 The Little Review C est AnacreonAmiqu il faut suivreApprends a monter Ta galante lyreSi tn veux chanterQue Bacchus t inspire Le tendre delire Quicher a ThemireS en fait ecouterhad probably constricted French poetryand there was doubtless need of some new shaggy influxBut the Beaudelairianvigour seems to me now too facile a mechanismAny decayed cabbagecast upon any pale satin sofa will give one a sense of contrast I am not saying that Beaudelaire is nothing but cabbages cast upon satin sofasbut merely thatn many poems oneunpleasant element is no more inevitable than anotherand that for a great many of his words and lines other words and lines might be substitutedand that he can be translated very roughly without losing any of his qualityThe stuff looks more vigorous than it isAs indeed bad graphic art often looks more skillful than it isPassons VillrranfPSBad Beaudelaire in English has come from trying i do him in a lilies

the present instance something about English versions of theclassicsan attempt which can only win me the greater detestation from the elder generation of American writers and publishing houses who have never heard of the classics and who are therefore annoyed when one mentions themand from the younger generation who have heard of these things but do not wish to be reminded of themand in particular from professors who think the classics are their private ice boxand who resent the intrusion ofmere men of lettersthereintoplunging however into these ancient sources of deliverance from small tyrannyit is born in upon me thai HD sChoruses from Iphegenia in Aulisare worth more praise than I have yet got round to giving themall the more if one compare them with the signal botch which the usually very intelligent RobtBrowning made when he attempted the Agamemnon of Aeschylusnot that I am convinced one can approach the Greek drama via Euripidesor that the isolated choruses form a fair avenue of approach in themselvesor are likely to be of proportionate interest taken aloneBut ifvia Homer and Aeschylus one have contracted an interest in the AtreidaeHD s choruses should be a great relief from other windy and verbose translatorsAlso she has spared us the celebrated cocoa outburst MAKARES OT METRIAS THEOU META TE SOPHROSUNAS METE SXON LEKTRON APHRODITAS reader will pardon this transalphabetisationbut bitter experience has led me to suspect that the man who prints this magazine has no hellenic font at his elbow The French commentator gives it Heureux ceux qui dans un chaste hymen usent moderement des plaisirs de Venus One cannot help sympathising with Aristophanesand I do not offer HD s choruses as any untempered incense to Euripidesor The Little Review 17 as an offset for MrsBrowning s remarksI can not tell how much interest they will stiror have stirredof themselves as poems isolatedbut certainly the firstsecondthirdfourth and ninth strophes of the first chorusand the brief second chorusas HDhas given themare enough to make anyone with an interest in Greek drama in English wish that more of it were available in this form I CHORUS OF THE WOMEN OF

Review 21 TARIFF AND COPYRIGHT Ezra Pound IF WE don t get to know these people i eEnglishFrenchItalianour allies betterthis war is a failure These words were addressed to me by George RusseJ in the office of the United States Department of Public InformationLondonand they are the finest words spoken by any American official since the death of Abraham LincolnAmong the present hinderances to communication two at least are utterly needlessthe firstAmerica s demoded and mediaeval import duty on booksan atavism which the city of Paris had dispensed with in the sixteenth centuryand the elimination of which aided in no small degree to keep Paris a centre of civilizationThe second hindrance is the red tape and insecurity of the copyright regulationsOf these twothe first is America s sole affairat least she alone can rectify the present stupidityThe second calls for reciprocal intelligence and reciprocal action between England and AmericaThe tariff on books should be removed because it is an hindrance to international commune iationserious at any timeand doubly serious now when we are trying to understand France and England more intimatelyThis question of tariff on books should be wholly dissociated from the question of tariffs on anything elseBooks have an immaterial as well as a material componentand because of this immaterial component they should circulate free from needless impedimentThey should not be hindered in migration even for the sake of slight material gainGeorge Haven Putnam has buried his argument of the case in his excellent volumes onBooks and their Makers during the Middle Ages The question has been confused by the Free Trade Associationor a body of some such titlewho have entangled it in their anti protection campaignThe tariff on books is specially noxious in the case of technical works and of important serious work of small circulation which can not be classed astechnical such works for example as HARen22 The Little Review nert sLife of Lope de Vega or James Joyce sPortrait of the Artist The government s income from import duty on serious literature is negligibleThe sole result is to handicap American authors and to preserve a provincial tone in American literature to its invalidationThe expression of thought is a process capable of improvements as complex and as important as the improvements of material mechanical processesThe American writer hears of such improvements ten years lateand begins with that handicapFor example the American novice begins to imitate a model ten years lateabout the time when Europe has got tired of the fashionAlso they get these crazes untemperedthey get the outstanding quality unbalanced by surrounding factorsEven in a period when English literature is weakthey do not know of this weakness in time and are not driven to investigating French workas for example from 1870 to 1900 when France was in a period of unusual vigourThe case does not rest on a personal opinion about particular datesauthorsinfluencesIn any science you would recognize that a man not aware of the last technical discoveries was at a disadvantageSo is the American authorThe disadvantage is NOT compensated by his beingprotected by a tariff In the arts the only thing worth a damn is the thing which does not need protectionUntil America can produce such workher artists are merely injuring the public intelligence by circulating the second rateThe serious worker is penalizedSome of the best American work has been published abroad and the American author penalized for trying to send it home The present writer is no longer in a position personally to benefit by removal of the tariff as his work is now published in both countriesand his American publication for the present rather ahead of his English publication Serious literary work can not be regarded as a commerce or as manufacturingFor example my redaction of Fenollosa s work The Little Review 23 on the Japanese Classical Drama costs twenty years work to Fenol losa and includes my skill acquired by ten years constant practiceNo possible or at any rate no probable sales can compensate this at the rate of unskilled day labour or pay it aliving wage Should one be taxed on topof thisTaxed for wishing to share the result with a limited American publicDrRennert s work on Lope de Vega falls under the same categorySerious works of realismworks which should serve as stimulae and as models to young writers have their entry into America retardedthe young men in Bloomsbury gets ten years start of the young man in New York or IndianapolisWith the cost of living higherwith the chances of leisure lesswith life brief as it isten years handicap is almost insurmountableI am in touch with promising young American writersI have seen men with good natural equipment who never get their perceptions recorded in prose firm enough to last or to compete with European proseAT LEAST the first 3000 copies of ANY book of which there is no American edition should go in freeAfter that there may be some question of favoring the printer at the expense of the publicThe countryany countrywants all the books it can getONLY Cheap GOOD books can compete wTitb cheap bad books It would even be a blessing if all the second hand book shops in Charing Cross Road could be dumped in any American cityYou have now a sane law about the importation of works of artpainting and sculptureI think even in the case of cheap reprints like Dent sEverymanseries there is much to be said for getting rid of the tariffThere are plenty of good classics which Dent does not reprintThe general level of intelligence would be improved much more by an American firm s reprinting OTHER classics even if the volume cost ten cents morethan by advancing the cost of Dent classics ten cents to the poor manand having American firms try to compete by a series of reprints of the SAME booksIf for example an American firm were running a DIFFERENT set of books in competition I should have two chances of getting a cheap issue of Golding s Ovidor Gavin DouglasVirgilwhich now 34 The Little Review I can not get save by sheer luck in finding a 1719 issue of one and a three dollar reprint of the otherOnly those who are FED UP with poor books hunt out the good onesLiterature should compete by QUALITY not by cheapnessLiterature is more important than the printing tradeAnd the dual natureintellectual and materialor books should wrench them out of the doctrinaire inclusion in a general discussion of economicsThe law of supply and demand does not COVER the matterIn ANY CASE the NON COMPETITIVE books should go in freethe first 3000 should go in freeCopyright It should be easier for a book to be copyright than for it to be not copyrightIt should be easier for a man to keep or keep the right to the work of his handsor of Ms brainthan for another to steal itThe present American copyright law is understood by few people and is of advantage neither to the public nor to the authorsThe copyright of any book printed anywhere should be and remain automatically the author sThe author should in return for thos protection place on file copies of his book at the national libraryWashingtonand in the municipal libraries of the four iargest American citiesSuch placing on file of the work should dispose of any further dispute over the matter I need hardly point out that said libraries would under this system acquire invaluable collections free of cost to the public Copyright from present date should be perpetualIn my own case I wish to leave my royalties as a literary en downmentI should be able to do this with as much security as if I had acquired oil stockor government bondsinstead of producing literatureSecondlythe present law by which copyright expires permits dead authors to compete on unjust terms with living authorsUn scurpulous but well meaning publisherswell sewing the publicprint dead authors more cheaply than living ones BECAUSE they do not have to pay royaltiesThis is to the disadvantage of con temporary literatureto The Little Review aj the disadvantage of literary productionAs America has less past literature than other countries it is particuarlyto American advantage that the living author should not fare at least as well as the dead onev BUT the heirs of an author should be powerless to prevent the publication of his works or to extort excessive royaltiesIf the heirs neglect to keep a man s work in print and at a price not greater than the price of his books during his life timethen unauthorized publishers should be at liberty to reprint said workspaying to heirs a royalty not more than 20and not less than 10 BUT the protection of the author should not enable him to play dog in the mangerIF having failed to have his works printed in Americaor imported into Americaor translated into Americanan American publisher or translator apply to said author for premission to publish or translate a given work or worksand receive no answer within reasonable timesay six monthsand if author do not give notice of intending other American publicationquite definitely stating where and whenwithin reasonable timeor designate some other translator as the authorized translatorthen the first publisher or translator shall have the right to publish or translate any workpaying to the original author a royalty of not more than 20and not less than 10in the case of an English book publishedand a royalty of not more than 10and not less than 5in the case of a foreign work translatedThe original author shall have right at law to the minimum of these royaltiesBut no unauthorized translation should inhibit the later publication of an authorized translationNevertheless an authorized translation

poetlike a religieuseHe is a master of all the nuances of the pianoand he uses his mastery as an act of worshipHis first recital in New York was the kind of thing you are willing to wait years to hearI could easily fall into superlativesso I will merely saydo not miss this manHe has the schdne tieje steleHarold Bauer I have written so much of my predeliction ior Harold Bauer s playing that I need not go into detail of his first recital of the seasonIt seems to me that he is playingdryerthis yearI meanlike wineHis Cesar Franck has never been so mellowHe and Cortot are so different that it might be interesting to discover their starting pointsIt is as though Bauer said Life has taught me much and I play of forgotten beauty and CortotLife has taught me nothing and I play of that beauty which I cannot forget It is to this particular type of what may be calledarrested developmentthat Cortot owes the complete lovelines of his musicHis Chopin Lj heartbreakingBauer s Chopin is always without this induced and essential melancholySerge Prokojeiff This pianist has been widely heralded asthe greatest composer of Russia I believe they have even reported that he makes Scriabine and Stravinsky sound pale and melodiousMrProkofeiff played an all Russian program of bis own musicto which he added some etudes of Scriabine and RachmaninoffHe is not a pianist in any sense of the wordHe plays as nearly all composers playwith a large carelessness of sound and a complete disregard noa complete ignorance of the registers of the piano keyboardBut what interested me was to discover The Little Review 29 that he is not a composer eitherHe has simply strung together a series of modern tendencies and moodsbut underneath them there runs no indication of an essential feeling When he began playing Scriabine the difference between great composition and that effort which assembles but cannot compose became too apparentthe kind of thing that embarrasses you and fills you with strange feelings of shameThe audience did not share my reactionsbut gave him an ovationand I have been afraid to look at the criticismsI know what will be said of him he played with great fire and his own compositions were remarkable etcIt will all be terribly untrueIf there is any interest in getting at the truththis could be saidhe plays the piano with the quality of a skilled rag time performer and his own music is a sort of Francis Grierson hodge podge a la mode Yvette Guilbert Yvette Guilbert is having a series of Thursday afternoons and Sunday nights at Maxime Elliott s TheatreIn some of her new songs she seems more inimitable than everShe is of course incomparable and I have no new words with which to glorify herI have just been reading her book How to Sing a Song Mac millian It is nearly always a sad experience to hear what an artist has to say about his workI am coming to think that there is just one unfailing test of an artist s greatnessthat he shall be completely uninteresting about general ideasFor instancethe kind of thing that fills up MmeGuilbert s book Observation is the faculty of seeing men and things quickly and justly orthe inventive power of an artist is Imagination orthe soul is a compound of all our intellectual faculties etc etcNone of these remarks means anythingnecessarilyif it does it means something to be dismissed before any interesting talk can be produced on the subjectBut the book is so charming in its naivete and so interesting in its specific expression that you will not want to miss itOf course you will find Clayton Hamilton airing his usual ineptitudes in the prefacesuch as thatexcept in rare instanceslike that of Keatsit may be assumed that nobody has anything to say till after he is thirty etcBut you already know MrHamilton s capacity for imbecilitiesthe thing that will puzzle you is how MmeGuilbert can tolerate such boredoms30 The Little ReviewCan Grande s CastleAmy Lowell s new bookMacmiUanshares this

such an actress has to depend upon the commercial theatre The Living CorpseTolstoy s story has been made into a play calledRedemptionand John Barrymore is starring in itI think MrBarry more has some

of the mob s relation to the individualSince MrBarrymore knows none of the closer aspects of these questions his appearance in such plays will continue to thrill the infantile and bore the sophisticatedAs it standsRedemptionis a kind of disintegrated Broadwayshow serving MrBarrymore as a vehicle for breaking into Artwith its gypsies and its music and its home made costumes it is as

reverberations a great many people got excited over MrJepson s article and a great many more suffer loudly and continually over MrPoundMiss Monroe is not the first to tell us that the Little Review is under the dictatorship of PoundOur idea of having a foreign editor is not to sit in our New York office and mess upcensoror throw out work sent to us by an editor in LondonWe have let Ezra Pound be our foreign editor in the only way we see itWe have let him be as foreign as he likesfoieign to tasteforeign to courtesyforeign to our standards of ArtAll because we believe in the fundamental idea back of our connection with MrPoundthe inteiest and value of an intellectual communication betv een Europe and AmericaIf anyone can tell us of a more untiringefficientbetter equipped poet to take over the foreign office let us hear from him36 The Little Review I cannot understand how any one with enough intelligence to read the Little Review could have thought of MrJepson s article as aesthetic criticismAesthetic criticism can only deal with work in which aesthetic activity is presentMrJepson uses all the threadbare terminology of half baked aesthetic criticism hammering out his ideathe poet s vision of the worldfine Mower of the spiritetc to place work which he claims has no more to do with poetry than withrat catching Why any confusionAesthetic criticism of rat catchingMedical criticism

ideabut Poundcalls his article criticism in a footnoteCursingendless lepetitions of abuse of all outsidersand a mutual advertising agency for themselvesseem to be a popular kind of in door sport of the literary lizards in LondonThey call it criticismNeither can I quite see literature reduced to a profession of the mind in just the way these men do itAmong other things I am thinking of the Henry James number with its legal smell Step into my office and I will tell you of MrJames We believe in the ancient truth that real appreciation of the arts is in some degree related to creation and cannot be taughtlearnedwilled or filchedmuch less can it be hammered into people or put upon them by threatsjeers and revilingsPound s animadversions of his own countrymen induce a sullen boredom and a greater inattention of the artswhile hisslursandinsultsof foreign races and nationalities living here arouse anger and bewildermentI have had countless letters from JewsLettsGreeksFinnsIrishetc protesting against MrPound s ignorance and indiscriminationI have answered that this is always true of mushroom nationsthis fixed irnperception of the qualities and culture of all other nationsAnd then there are some of us who come from races of ancient culture to whom MrPound s ravings sound but the torturings of an inferiority complexand all this has nothing to do with editing a magazineCriticismpraisecontemptcommiserationthere is not enough reThe Little Review 37 sistance in the whole country for one grown human beingAs long as MrPound sends us work by YeatsJoyceEliotde Bosscherework bearing the stamp of originality and permanence we have no complaint of him as an editorIf we are slightly jarred by his manner of asking for almsor by any other personal manifestationwe can take care of that outside the magazineWe need no commiseration for our connection with MrPoundWe are not blind deficient childrenAll this again I say has nothing to do with editing a magazine of the art It is ail very much only the outermost vibrations of discussions and repliesI think I really started to write this because I scented an implied criticism of Chicago in MrJepson s articleEvery one gets jumpy over criticism for one cause or anotherif not from mental timidityfrom sentimentalityI reject all criticism of ChicagosentimentallyI have seen some of the great cities of the world and many of the liner onesI know Chicago to the skin and boneAnd Chicago has a thrallI know it has an Art Institute which advertises Art and CommerceIt has electric lighted statues in its parks and will

glamourPounding EzraA ConversationTHERE is about the writings of Ezra Pound the dubious charm of a graceful old maidI find in him an elusive boredomHis poetry is an etiquettehis prose a less meticulous but not quite persuasive gestureHis whims are tiredhis fancies keep falling asleep In essaying this sort of rigamarole judgment of PoundI subscribe to no standards he may have violated nor nurse any tenets of which he may have fallen shortIn fact my complaint against Ezra is thathaving attracted me time and again with the promise of de38 The Little Review lightful cerebral embraceshe is forever bidding me adieu with no more than a languid handshake a suavea fastidiousan irreproachablebut still a handshakeAnd thus I report now from no other inspiration than the petulence of one whorushing forward to sinremains to prayPerhaps Pound s place isas others have fervently pointed outin the literary politics of the day rather than in its literatureHe may be an influencethe patriarch cod of the vers libre school or anything of the sort which it beguiles less fallible historians than myself to nominate himMy relations with his workhoweverare entirely personalI am unable to perceive any influence in itThe various rules for the writing of poetry which he has from time to time handed down from his fastidious SinaiI have regarded always as the surviving and irrepressible capers of the pedagogue either I ound was in his youth or in a previous incarnationRules and don ts are things more applicable to hotel bath rooms than to poetryI do not understand how rules for the writing of poetry can possibly produce a poetAnd without producing a poetother than himself I can see no credit in being an InfluenceThat Pound has flushed covey upon covey of irritating imitators is too obvious for commentI dismiss this political aspect of his work with the reportbased entirely upon prejudicethat Pound to me has appeared always as some Pied Piper luring his swarm of literary rodents out of their conventional stables to their doomA man is an influence by what he does rather than by the facile explanations of how he happened to do itOr in the words of my grammar school copy bookBut the matter is dismissedI concern myself with the things Ezra Pound has writtenOf these I have read only a book of poems calledLustra an indefinable volume calledPavannes and Divisionsand four or five scattered essaysfive or six scattered poems which may have been collected elsewhereFrom this reading I have achieved the conviction that Pound s is a saneclear visionedcultured mindI dislike calling people cultured but the manknowsso hopelessly many more things than do I that the word comes naturally to my aidMy usual weapon for creatures who have had the leisure to assimilate more than I is the bloody and terrifying mace AcademicThisPound is notHe has devoured the devil knows how many books but he has digested themPerhaps he is too full perhaps his languor is that of the bride rather than the old maid Such distinction ishoweverbeside the The Little Review 39 issueThe point is that nothing Pound has devoured has stuck in his throat to be spewed up as statistics with which to embarrass the youngThe things that Pound has got out of esoteric volumes have made him merry rather than profoundOf James Branch Cabella writer whom I cannot regard other than as professorI once wrote the disillusion of a man who has read too much rather than lived too completelyA wistful librarian spying upon the world through the dust of ancient manuscripts For saying this I was solemnly spankedNevertheless I still believe itNot so of PoundHoweverI am being betrayed by ray natural admiration for the man into praisewhich is not my intentionIn orderneverthelessto satisfy my little exercised sense of justiceI will go on Cultured Pound isand more than thatsane and clear visionedHis reflections upon the art of others are based upon shrewddefinite understandingsand upon intuitions of taste more fluid and sensitive than those of PollardMenckenHunekerEllisBy this I mean nothing more than that I agree with himAlthough I was once pleased byThe Tidings Brought to Mary a play by Caudel under whose Catholic seat Ezra is continually exploding firecrackersIn addition to his critical genius Pound has also ideas about life to which I subscribeHe is ready with a pensive razzberry for every variety of sham in the calender of the saintsThe decay of the soul under religious morality inspires him to proper protestAnd his irony is not the clumsy irony of Cabell who bids one look at the world from a perch amid the stars and see how little it isPound sirony is not the Teutonic shrug ofWhat will it all matter a hundred years from now Also he is a decadentfamous generalityI mean by thishoweverthat as an artist he is concerned with the color of a cat s eyes rather than with the animal s place in the social systemAll this about Pound is what lures me to him with the promise of cerebral embraceAnd yet I have just come away from another languid handshake Pavannes and Divisions What is itthenwrong with Pound for it does not occur to me to blame myselfI can answer this thing convincingly to myselfThere is no ecstasy in PoundThere is no tumult in himHell take the quibble about emotion personal emotion in artI am not referring to thatI know of no lines or ideas that Pound has 40 The Little Review ever plagarizedAnd yet he has always about him the air of a mimicHis style appeals to me not as the cunning mask for ideas but as inflections borrowedas posturings filched for a moment from a scholastic wardrobe trunkHe does not present to me a style but a series of portrayalsElsie Janis doing BernhartEddie Foy and George Cohan Alsohe writes like anold masterlooks faded and impressiveHe is too damned careful of his lamentable rules and regulationsHe is timorous of disonances ard strophes and rhythyms and what notHe launches his phrases with the nervous scrupulous air of one launching tiny ships upon too broad a seaHis vocabulary shudders at itself and bids itself take heed there are the entities and the verities andGod help himthe proprieties to observeWhat makes the stylistWith my friend MrWallace Smith I repeat I ll bite I do not know what makes the stylist any more than I know what is artand whatby the whiskers of all prophetsis not until I see a work of art itselfAnd thenbeyond certain elementalsthe matteras like as notdepends upon the condition of my bowels and the color of the day Pavannes and Divisionsis a composition to inspire respect and admirationIts opening bit of irony and its chapter on De Gourmont particularly appealed to meIn them Pound successfully refutes most of what I can scrape up against himBut the book is to revert to my favorite habit of generalizing a talented dancer handicapped by an aversion to rouge and legs more than ethereally thinI do not intend to argue that rouge and a shapely leg make the stylistI do not intend to argue anything Remy de Gourmont writes Pound has embedded his philosophy in a luxurious mist of the senses Were Pound writing of himself he might say Ezra Pound of Idaho has etched his philosophy upon a moonbeam Undoubtedly the faults that my prejudice forluxurious mists of the sensesmanages to find in Pound are the virtues of which he is most pleasantly conceitedUndoubtedly it may be said that the desire for stronger music and for madder wine argues a taste a bit coarsenedAnd yetI cling to the stubborn disillusion of the yokel lured into the tent by the seductive lithographs withoutTo me Pound remains the exquisite showman minus a showThe Little Review 41 I conclude full of ethical confusionsThe whimsical canaille who police the arts with their yelps do not fancy PoundTo his immortal credit let it be shouted that they consider him a low and vulgar assa sort of filthy smart aleckTo his everlasting fame let it be heralded that in the eyes of the literary laws of his day Pound was a primping and obnoxious clownI know of no greater praise for him than that the fraternity of half witted hacksdiapered pundits and flatulent nightschool wits who constitute the general run of newspaper editorial writersbook reviewersand column conductors of the dayconsider him as they doI envy him his enemiesBillingsgate for BillingsgateI know of no more agreeable pastime thandefendingEzra against the redolent sutterings of the half deadIt is for this reason that I assume an apologetic vagueness in talking of him as I haveIt is a vagueness I do not actually feelMajor

years I came to care for his paintings of the Clare coastwith his cloud shadows upon blue grey stony hillsand for one painting of a not very different scenery by his friendInnesmore than for any contemporary landscape paintingA man of letters may perhaps find in work such as thisor in old Chinese paintingin the woodcuts and etchings of Calvert and Palmerin Blake s woodcuts to Thornton s Virgilin the landscape background of MrRicketts Wise and Foolish Virgins something that he does not find in the great modern mastersand that he cares for deeplyIs it merely that these men share

that were difficult to followI have so much to learnyou see Genesisorthe first book in the BibleSubject to authority The sacred author of this work complied with the ideas acceptable to his eraIt was almost neessarywithout this ondescen tion he would not have been understoodThere remain for us merely a few reflections on the physics of these remote timesAs for the theology of the bookwe respect itwe believe it most firmlywe would not risk the faintest touch to its surface In the be beginning God created heaven and earth That is the Translated from au eighteenth century authorThe Little Review 51 way they translate ityet there is scarcely anyone so ignorant as not to know that the origianl readsthe gods created heaven and earth Which reading conforms to the Phoenician idea that God employed lesser divinities to untangle chaosThe Phoenicians had been long established when the Hebfews broke into some few provinces of their landIt was quite natural that these latter should have learned their language and borrowed their ideas of the cosmosDid the ancient Phdenecian philosophers inthe time of Mosesknow enough to regard the earth as a point in relation to the multitude of globes which God has placed in imensityThe very ancient and false idea that heaven was made for the earth has nearly always prevailed among ignorant peoplesIt is rather as if god had created many mountains and one grain of sandthe mountains would have been made for the sandTt is scarcely possible that such good navigators as the Phoenicians should not have had a few decent astronomersbut the old prejudices were quite strongand were gently handled by the author of Genesiswho wrote to teach us God s ways and not to instruct us in physics The earth was all tohu bohu and voiddarkness was over the face of the deepthe spirit of God was borne on the watersTohu bohumeans precicely chaosdisorderThe earth was not yet formed as it is at presentMatter existedthe divine pcvhad only to straighten things outThespirit of Godis literally thebreath orwindwhich stirred up the watersThis idea is found in fragments of the Phonecian author SanchoniathonThe Phoenicianslike all the other peoples of antiquitybelieved matter eternalThere is not one author of all those times who ever said that one could make something of nothingEven in the Bible there is no passage which claims that matter was made out of nothingnot but what this creation from nothing is truebut its verity was unknown to the carnal JewsMen have been always divided on the eternity of the worldbut never on the eternity of matterDe nihilo nihilum Gigni et in nihilum nil posse reverti writes Persiusand all antiquity shared this opinionGod saidLet there he light and there was lightand he saw that the light was goodand he divided the light from darknessand he called the light day and the darkness nightand this was the evening and the morning of the first dayAnd god also said that the firmament etc the second 52 TheLittle Review day saw that it was good Let us begin by seeing whether the bishop of Avranches HuetLeclerc etc are rightagainst those who claim that this is a sublime piece of eloquenceThe Jewish author lumps in the light with the other objects of creationhe uses the same turn of phrase saw that it was good The sublime should lift itself above the averageLight is no better treated than anyihing else in this passageIt was another respected opinion that light did not come from the sunMen saw it spread through the air before sunrise and after sunsetthey thought the sun served merely to reinforce itThe author of Genesis conforms to popular errorhe has the sun and moon made four days after the lightIt is unlikely that there was a morning and evening before the sun came into beingbut the inspired author bows to the vague and stupid prejudice of his nationIt seems probable that God was not attempting to educate the Jews in philosophy or cosmogenyHe could lift their spirits straight into truthbut he preferred to descend to their levelOne can not repeat this answer too oftenThe reparation of the light from the darkness is not part of another physical theoryit seems that night and day were mixed up like two kinds of grainand that they were sifted out of each otherIt is sufficiently well established that darkness is nothing but the deprivation of lightand that there is light only in so far as our eyes receive the sensationbut no one had thought of this at that timeThe idea of the firmament is also of respectable antiquityPeople imagined the skies very solidbecause the same set of things always happened thereThe skies circulated over our headsthey must therefore be very strongThe means of calculating how many exhalations of the earth and how many seas would be needed to keep the clouds full of waterThere was then no Halley to write out the equationsThere were tanks of water in heavenThese tanks were held up on a good steady domebut one could see through the domeit must have been made out of crystalIn order that the water could be poured over the earth there had to be doorssluicescataracts which could be openedturned onSuch was the current as trononyand one was writing for Jewsit was quite necessary to take up their silly ideaswhich they had borrowed from other peoples only a little less stupid The Little Review 53 God made two great lightsone to preside over the daythe Other the nightand he made also the stars True this shows the same continuous ignorance of natureThe Jews did not know that the moonlight is merely reflectionThe author speaks of the stars as luminous jointswhich they look likealthough they are at times suns with planets swinging about themBat holy spirit harmonized with the mind of the timeIf he had said that the sun is a million times as large as the earthand the moon fifty times smallerno one would have understood himThey appear to be two stars of sizes not very unequal God said alsolet us make man in our imagelet him rule over the tishes etc What did the Tews mean byin our image They meantlike all antiquityFinxit in effigiein moderantum cuncia deorumOne can not makeimagessave of bodiesNo nation imagined a bodiless godand it is impossible to picture him as suchOne might indeed saygod is nothing of anything we know but then one would not have any idea what he isThe Jews constantly believed god corporalis did all the rest of the nationsAll the first fathers of the church also believed god corporaluntil they had swallowed Plato s ideasor rather until the lights of Christianity had grown purer He created them male and female If God or the secondary gods created man male and female in their resemblanceit would seem that the Jews believed God and the Gods were male and femaleOne searches to see whether the author meant to say that man was at the start ambisextrous or if he means that God made Adam and Eve the same dayThe most natural interpretation would be that god made Adam and Eve at the same timebut this is absolutely contradicted by the formation of woman from the riba long time after the first seven days And he rested the seventh day The PhoeniciansCaldeansand Indians say that God made the world in six periodswhich Zoroaster calls the six gahambarsso celebrated among PersiansIt is incontestable that all these people had a theogeny long before the Jews got to Horeb and Sinaiand before they could have had writersSeveral savants think it likely that the allegory of the six days is imitated from the six periodsGod might have permit54 The Little Review ted great nations to have this idea before he inspired the Jewsjust as he had permitted other people to discover the arts before the Jews had attained any The place of delight shall be a river which waters a gardenand from it shall flow four riversPhisonGehonetcTigrisEuphrates According to this version the terrestrial paradise would have contained about a third of Asia and AfricaThe Euphrates and Tigris have their sources sixty miles apart in hideous mountains which do not look the lleast like a garden The river which borders Ethiopia can be only the Nilewhose source is a little over a thousand miles from those of the Tigris and the Euphratesand if Phison is the Phaseit is curious to start a Scythian river from the fount of a river of AfricaOne must look further afield for the meaning of all these riversEvery commentator makes his own EdenSome one has said that the Garden was like the gardens of Eden at Saana in Arabia Felix celebrated in antiquityand that the parvenu Hebrews might have been an Arab tribe taking to themselves credit for the prettiest thing in the best cantorof Arabiaas they have always taken to themeselves the tradition of all the great peoples who enslaved themBut in any case they were led by the Lord The Lord took man and set him in the midst of the gardento tend it It is all very well sayingtend itcultivate the garden but it would have been very difficult for Adam to cultivate a garden 3000 miles longPerhaps he had helpersIt is another chance for the commentators to exercise their gifts of divinationas they do with the rivers Eat not of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil It is difficult to think that there was a tree which taught good and evilas there are pear trees and peach treesOne asks why God did not wish man to know good from evilWould not the opposite wishif one dare say soappears more worthy of Godand much more needful to manIt seems to our poor reason that God might have ordered him to eat a good deal of this fruitbut one must submit one s reason and conclude that obedience to God is the proper course for us If you eat of the fruit you shall die Yet Adam ateand did not die in the leastthey say he lived another nine centuriesSeveralFathershave considered all this as an alleThe Little Review 55 goryIndeed one may say that other animals do not know that they diebut that man knows it through his reasonThis reason is the tree of knowledge which makes him foresee his finishThis explanation may be more reasonablebut we do not dare to pronounce on it The Lord said alsoIt is not good that man should be alonelet us make him an helpmate like to him One expects that the Lord is going to give him a womanbut first he brings up all the beastsThis may be the transposition rf some copyist And the name which Adam gave to each animal is its real nameAn animal s real name would be one which designated all the qualifications of its speciesor at least the principal traitsbut this does not exist in any languageThere are certain imitative wordscock and cuckooand alali in greeketcMorever if Adam had known the real names and therefore the properties of the animalshe must have already eaten of the tree of knowledgeor else it would seem that God need not have forbidden him the treesince he already knew more than the Royal Societyor the AcademyObserve that this is the first time Adam is named in GenesisThe first man according to the Brahmins was Adimoson of the earthAdam and Eve mean the same thing in Phoeniciananother indication that the holy spirit fell in with the received ideasWhen Adam was asleep etcribmade a woman The Lordin the preceding chapterhad already created them male and femalewhy should he take a rib out of the man to make a woman already existingWe are told that the author announces in one place what he explains in anotherWe are told that this allegory shows woman submitted to her husbandMany people have believed on the strength of these verses that men have one rib less than womenbut this is an heresyvide Heresylater and anatomy shows us that a woman is no better provided with ribs than her husband Now the serpent was the most subtle of beasts etc he said to the womanetcThere is nowhere the least mention of the devil or a devilAll is physicalThe serpent was considered not only the subtlest of all beasts by all oriental nationshe was also believed immortalThe Chaldeans had a fable about a fight between god and a serpentit is preserved by PherecidesOrigen cites it in his sixth book against CelsusThey carried snakes in the feasts of BacchusThe Egyptians attributed a sort of divinity to the serpentas Eusebius tells us 56 The Little Review in hisEvangelical Preparations book I chapter XIn India and Arabiaand in Chinathe serpent was the symbol of lifethe Chinese empero rs before Moses wore the serpent sign on their breastsEve is not surprised at the serpent s talking to herAnimals are always talking in the old storiesthus when Pilpai and Locman makenima s talk no one is ever surprisedAll this tale seems physical and denuded of allegoryIt even tells us the reason why the serpent who ramped before this now crawls on its bellyand why we always try to destroy itat least so they say precisely as we are told in all ancient metamorphoses why the crowwho was whiteis now blackwhy the owl stays at home in the day timeetcBut theFathershave believed it an allegory manifest and respectableand it is safest to believe them I will multiply your griefs and your pregnenciesye shall bring forth children with griefye shall be beneath the power of the man and he shall rule over you One asks why the multiplication of pregnencies is a punishmentIt was on the contrary a very great blessingand especially for the JewsThe pains of childbirth are alarming only for delicate womenthose accustomed to work are brought to bed very easilyespecially in hot climatesOn the other hand animals sometimes suffer in littering and even die of itAs for the superiority of man over woman this is the quite natural result of his bodily and intellectual forcesThe male organs are generally more capable of consecutive effortmore fit for manual and intellectual tasksBut when the woman has fist or wit stronger than those of her husband she rules the roostand the man is submitted to womanThis is truebut before the original sin there may have been neither pain nor submission God made them tunics of skin This passage proves very nicely that the Jews believed in a corporal godA Rabbi named Eliezer has written that God covered Adam and Eve with the skin of the tempter serpentOrigen claims that thetunic of skinwas a new flesha new body which god made for manbut one should have more respect for the text And the Lord saidBehold Adamwho is become like one of us It seems that the Jews at first admired several godsIt is considerably more difficult to make out what they mean by the word GodEioimSeveral commentators state that this phraseone of usmeans the Trinitybut there is no question of the The Little Review 57 Trinity in the BibleThe Trinity is a composed of several godsit is also a tripk krodthe Jews never heard tell of a god in three personsBy these wordslike unto usit is probable that the Jews meant angelsElolmFor this reason various rash men of learning have thought that the book was not written until a time when the jews had adopted a belief in inferior godsbut this view is condemnedThe Lord set him outside the garden of delightsthat he might dig in the earth Yet some say that god had put him in the gardenin order that he might cultivate itIf gardener Adam merely became labourer Adamhe was not so much the worse offThis solution of the difficulty does not seem to us sufficiently seriousTt would be better to say that God punished Adam s disobedience by banishing him from his birthplaceCertain over temerious commentators say that the whole of the story refers to an idea once common to all men i e that past times were better than presentPeople have always bragged of the past in order to run down the presentMen overburdened with work have imagined that pleasure is idlenessnot having had wit enough to conceive that man is never worse off that when he has nothing to doMen seeing themselves not infrequently miserable forged an idea of a time when all men were happyIt is as if they had said once upon a time no tree witheredno beast fell sickno animal devoured anotherthe spiders did not catch rliesHence the ideal of the Golden Ageof the egg oArimanaof the serpent who stole the secret of eternal life from the donkeyof the combat of Typhon and Osirisof Ophionee and the godsof Pandora s casketand all these other old storiessometime very ingenious and neverin the least wayinstructiveBut we should believe that the fables of other nations are imitation of Hebrew historysince we still hrive the Hebrew history and the history of other savage peoples is for the most part destroyedMoreover the witne gt ses in favour of Genesis are quite irrefutableThe reader will remember in I andor s Chinese dialogueswhen the returned mandarin is telling the Emperor s children about Englandthere is one place where they burst into gigglesbecause they had been taughi some arithmetic The reader is referred to our heading Subject to authority 58 TheLittle ReviewAnd he set Before the garden of delight a cherubin with a turning and flaming sword to keep guard over the gateway to the tree of life The word kerubmeans bullockA bullock with a burning sword is an odd sight at a doorwayBut the Jews have represented angels as bulls and as sparrow hawksdespite the prohibition to make graven imagesObviously they got these bulls and hawks from Egyptians who imitated all sorts of thingsand who worshipped the bull as the symbol of agriculture and the hawk as the symbol of windsProbably the tale is an allegorya Jewish allegorythe kerub meansnature A symbol made of a bull s heada man s head and the hawk s wings The Lord put his mark upon CainWhat a Lord say the incredulousHe accepts Abel s offeringrejects that of the eider brotherwithout giving any trace of a reasonThe Lord provided the cause of the first brotherly enmityThis is a moral instructionmost trulya lesson to be learned from all ancient fablesto witthat scarcely had the race come into existence before one brother assassinated anotherbut what appears to the wise of this worldcontrary to all justicecontrary to all the common sense principlesis that God has eternally damned the whole human raceand has slaughtered his own sonquite uselesslyfor an appleand that he has pardoned a fraticideDid I saypardoned He takes the criminal under his own protectionHe declares that anyone who avenges the murder of Abel shall be punished with seven fold the punishment inflicted on CainHe puts on him his sign as a safeguardThe impious call the story both execrable and absurdIt is the delirium of some unfortunate Israelitewho wrote these inept infamies in imitation of stories so abundant among the neighboring SyriansThis insensate Hebrew attributed his atrocious invention to Mosesat a time when nothing was rarer than booksDestiny which disposes of all things has preserved his work till our dayscoundrels have praised itand idiots have believedThus say the horde of theistswho while adoring godhave been so rash as to condemn the Lord God of Israeland who judge the actions of the Eternl Being by the rules of our imperfect ethicsand our erroneous justice They admit a god but submit god to our lawsLet us guard against such temerityand let us once again learn to respect what lies beyond our comprehensionLet us cry outO Altitudo with all our strengthThe Little Review 59The GodsEloimseeing that the daughters of men were fairtook for spouses those whom they choose This flight of

see our young ladies and take the best for themselveschildren produced in this way are better than other folkschildrenthus Genesis does not omit to say that this commerce bred giantsOnce again the

nor Latin history takes note of this very great floodIn truth they knew only Deucalion s and Ogygesin GreeceThese were regarded as universal in the fables collected by Ovidbut were totally unknown in Eastern AsiaStAugustin is not in error when he says history makes no mention thereof God said to NoahI will make an agreement with you and with your seed after youand with all the animals God make an agreement with animalsThe unbelievers will exclaim What a contract But if he make an alliance with manwhy not with the animalsWhat nice feelingthere is something quite as divine in this sentiment as

anextention jf the word s meaning One should not quibble over mere terminologybut worship the spiritand go back to the time when they wrote this work which is scandal to the the weakbut quite edifying to the strong 6o The Little ReviewAnd I will put my bow in the skyand it shall be a sign of our pact Note that the author does not sayI have putbutI will put my bow this shows that in common opinion the bow had not always existedIt is a phenomenon of necessity caused by the rainand they give it as a supernatural manifestation that the world shall never more be covered with waterIt is odd that they should choose a sign of rain as a promise that one shall not be drownedBut one may reply to thiswhen in danger of inundations we may be reassured by seeing a rainbow Now the Lord went down to see the city which the children of Adam had buiidedand he saidbehold a people with only one speechThey have begun this and won t quit until it is finishedLet us go down and confound their languageso that no man may understand his neighbor Note merely that the sacred author still conforms to vulgar opinionHe always speakof God as of a man who informs himself of what is going onwho wants to see with his eyes what is being done on his estateand who calls his people together to determine a course of actionAnd Abrahamhaving arrayed his peoplethey were of the fell upon the five kings and slew them and pursued them even to Hoba on the left side of Damas From the south side of the lake of Sodom to Damas is24 leaguesand they still had to cross Liban and anti Liban Unbelievers exult over such tremendous exaggerationBut since the Lord favouied Abraham there is no exaggerationAnd that evening two angels came into Sodometc The history of the two angels whom the Sodomites wanted to ravish is perhaps the most extraordinary which antiquiyt has producedBut we must remember that all Asia believed in incubi and succubae demonsandhat moreover these angels were creatures more perfect than manand that they were probably much better lookingand lit more desires in a jadedcorrupt race than common men would have excitedPerhaps this part of the story is only a figure of rhetoric to express the horrible lewdness of Sodom and of GomorrahWe offer this solution to savants with the most profound self mistrustAs for Lot who offered his two daughters to the Sodomites in lieu of the angelsand Lot s wife metamorphosed into the saline imageand all the rest of the storywhat can one say of itThe ancient fable of Cinyra and Myrrha has some relation to Lot s inThe Little Review 61 cest with his daughtersthe adventure of Philemon and Baucis is not without its points of comparison with that of the two angels appearing to Lot and his wifeAs for he pillar of saltI do not know what it compares withperhapswith the story of Orpheus and Eurydicer A number of savants think with Newton and the learned Leclerc that the Pentateuch was written by Samuel when the Jews had learned reading and writingand that all these tales are imitation of Syrian fableBut is sufficient for us that it is all Holy Scripturewe therefore revere it without searching in it for anything that is not the work of the Holy SpiritWe should rememberat all timesthat these times are not our timesand we should not fail to add our word to that of so many great men who have declared that the old testament is true historyand that everything invented by all the rest of the universe is mere fableSome savants have pretended that one should remove from the canonical books all incredible matters which might be a stumbling block to the feeblebut it is said that these savants were men of corrupt heart and that they ought to be burnedand that it is impossible to be an honest man unless you believe that the Sodomites desired to ravish the angelsThis is the reasoning of a species of monster who wishes to rule over witsIt is true that several celebrated church fathers have had the prudence to turn all these tales into allegorylike the Jewsand Philo in especialPopes still more prudent desired to prevent the translation of these books into the everyday tonguefor fear men should be led to pass judgment on what was upheld for their adorationOne ought surely to conclude that those who perfectly understand this work should tolerate those who do not understand itfor if these latter do not understand itit is not their faultalso those who do not understand it should tolerate those who understand it most fullySavantstoo full of their knowledgehave claimed that Moses could not possibly have written the book of GenesisOne of their reasons is that in the story of Abrahamthe patriarch pays for his wife s funeral plot in coined moneyand that the king of Gerare gives a thousand pieces of silver to Sarah when he returns herafter having stolen her for her beauty in the seventy fifth62 The Little Review year of her ageThey ay that having consulted authoritits they find that there was no coined money in those daysBut it is quite clear that this is pure chicane on their partsince the Church has always believed most firmly that Moses did write the PentateuchThey strengthen all the doubts raised by the disciples of Aben Hesra and Baruch SpinozaThe physician Astrucfather in law of the comptroller general Siliiouettein his booknow very rareentitledConjectures on Genesis adds npw objectionsunsoivable to human wisdombut not to humble submissive pietyThe savants dare to contradict every linethe simple revere every lineGuard against falling into the misfortune of trusting our human reasonbe contrite in heart and in spirit And Abraham said that Sarah was his sisterand the king of Gerare took her to him We confess as we have said in our essay on Abrahamthat Sarah was then ninety yearoldthat she had already been kidnapped by one King of Egyptand that a king of this same desert Gerare later kidnapped the wife of Abraham s son IsaacWe have also spoken of the servant Agarby whom Abraham had a sonand of how Abraham treated them bothOne knows what delight unbelievers take in these storieswith what supercilious smiles they consider themhow they set the story of Abimelech and this same wife of Abraham sSarahwhom he passed off as his sisterabove thelOOl nightsand also that of another Abimelech in love with Rebeccawhom Isaac also passed off as his sisterOne can not often reiterate that the fault of all these studious critics lies in their persistent endeavour to bring all these things into accord with our feeble reason and to judge ancient Arabs as they would judge the French court or the English The soul of Sichemson of King Hemorcleaved to the soul of Dinahand he charmed his sadness with her tender caressesand he went to Hemor his fatherand said unto himGive me this woman for wife Here the savants are ev n more refractoryWhata king s son marry a vagabond s daughterJacob her father loaded with presentsThe king receives into his city these wandering robberscalled patriarchshe has the incredible and incomprehensible kindness to get himself circumcisedhe and his sonhis court and his peoplein order to condescend to the superstition of this little tribe which did not own a half league of landAnd what reward do o r holy patriarchs make htm for such astonishing kindThe Little Review 63 nessThey wait the day when the wound of circumcision ordinarilly produces a feverThen Simeon and Levi run throughout the citydaggers in handthey massacre the kingthe princehis sonand all the inhabitantsThe horror of this StBartholemew is only diminished by its impossibilityIt is a shocking romance but it is obviously a ridiculous romanceIt is impossible that two men could have killed a whole nationOne might suffer some inconvenience from one s excerpted foreskinbut one would defend oneself against two scoundrelsone would assemblesurround themfinish them off as they deservedBut there is one more impossible statementby an extract sup putation of datewe find that Dinahdaughter of Jacobwas at this time no more than three years of ageeven if one tries to accomodate the chronologyshe could not have been more than fiveit is this that causes complaintPeople say What sort of a book is thisThe book of a reprobate peoplea book for so long unknown to all the eartha book where rightreason and decent custom are outraged on every pageand which we have presented us as irrefutableholydictated by God himselfIs it notan impiety to believe itIs it not the dementia of cannibals to persecute sensiblemodest men who do not believe itTo which we replyThe Church says she believes itCopyists may have introduced revolting absurdities into reverend storiesOnly the Holy Church can be judge of such mattersThe profane should be led by her wisdomThese absurditiesthese pretended horrors do not affect the basis of our religionWhere would men be if the cult of virtue depended on what happened long ago to Sichem and little Dinah Behold the Kings who reigned in the land of Edombefore the children of Israel had a king Behold another famous passageanother stone which doth hinder our feetIt is this passage which determined the great Newton he pious and sage Samuel Clarkethe deeply philosophical Boling brokethe learned Lecrerethe savant Freretand a great number of other scholars to argue that Moses could not have been the author of GenesisWe do indeed confess that these words could only have been written at a time when the Jews had kingsIt is chiefly this verse which determined Astruc to upset the 64 The Little Review whole book of Genesisand to hypothecate memories on which the real author had drawnHis work is ingeniousexactbut rashA council would scarcely have dared to undertake itAnd to what end has it servedthis ungratefuldangerous work of this AstrucTo redouble the darkness which he set out to enlightenThis is ever the fruit of that tree of knowledge whereof we all wish to eatWhy should it be necessary that the fruits of the tree of ignorance should be more nourishing and more easy to manageBut what matter to usafter allwhether this verseor this chapterwas written by Mosesor by Samuel or by the priest
