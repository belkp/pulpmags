woman inhibiting passion In solace  The multiform beauty sinking in night wind Quick to be gone yet never Quite going  She will leap back from the swift constellations As they enter the place of their western Seclusion  II  Ce qu il faut c est reconnaître l amour et la beauté triomphante de toute violence 22 octobre  ANECDOTAL REVERY  The streets contain a crowd Of blind men tapping their way By inches This man to complain to the grocer Of yesterday s cheese This man to visit a woman This man to take the air Am I to pick my way Through these crickets I that have a head In the bag Slung over my shoulder I have secrets   That prick Like a heart full of pins Permit me gentlemen I have killed the mayor And am escaping from you Get out of the way  The blind men strike him down with their

Primitives The sensitive and conscientious schemes   Of mountain pallors ebbing into air  And I remember sharp Japonica The driving rain the willows in the rain The birds that wait out rain in willow trees  Although life seems a goblin mummery These images return and are increased As for a child in an oblivion  Even by mice these scamper and are still They cock small ears more glistening and pale Than fragile volutes in a rose sea shell  J ai la ferme espérance mais surtout j ai confiance en la justice éternelle quelque surprise qu elle cause à l humaine idée que nous en avons 26 novembre  THE SURPRISES OF THE SUPERHUMAN  The palais de justice of chambermaids  Tops the horizon with its colonnades  If it were lost in Uebermenschlichkeit  Perhaps our wretched state would soon come right  For somehow the brave dicta of its kings Make more awry our faulty human things   Wallace Stevens  VI  Bien chère mère aimée Pour ce qui est de ton c ur j ai tellement confiance en ton courage qu à l heure actuelle cette certitude est mon grand réconfort Je sais que ma mère a atteint à cette liberté d âme qui permet de contempler le spectacle universel 7 décembre  There is another mother whom I love O chère maman another who in turn Is mother to the two of us and more In whose hard service both of us endure Our petty portion in the sacrifice Not France France also serves the invincible eye That from her helmet terrible and bright Commands the armies the relentless arm Devising proud majestic issuance Wait now have no rememberings of hope Poor penury There will be voluble hymns Come swelling when regardless of my end The mightier mother raises up her cry And little will or wish that day for tears  VII  La seule sanction pour moi est ma conscience Il faut nous confier à une

mars  Life contracts and death is expected As in a season of autumn The soldier falls  He does not become a three days personage Imposing his separation Calling for pomp  Death is absolute and without memorial As in a season of autumn When the wind stops  When the wind stops and over the heavens The clouds go nevertheless In their direction  Wallace Stevens   WEATHER WHIMS  THOUGHTS  Quicksilver thoughts Flirt with me these spring days Flit through my head Slip through my fingers Teasing vanish Before I have touched them  But if I were a poet I d know a trick to catch them I d catch them with a spirit noose   And then I d let the wild things go  EARLY SPRING NIGHT  The cool spring night smells good Smells of the brown earth And the strong little seeds Pushing up through the brown earth  My soul swells with thoughts Impalpable Melancholy exalted Blurring me  The soft scarce stirring wind moves through my hair   Viola I Paradise  Perhaps they are not thoughts Those impalpable things which stir my soul Perhaps they are my senses Pushing up like the strong little seeds Through the brown earth  MIDNIGHT RAIN  The lightning pricks my heavy eyes awake  My body thunderstung Out of its sluggish sleep  Resents this midnight waking  But soon  The long soft sibilant rain  Brings to the night a deep new rest  The storm recedes And on the far warm low voluptuous thunder I am rolled back to sleep  WIND AND MOONLIGHT  The Wind s a brute a monster Shrieking and yelling about my house Tearing at the walls with frantic iron claws Striking with frenzied panicked paws At my windows   I m glad it has no mind As it freaks about my room Rattling every loose thing And I m glad I m in bed Safe from its maniac mood  Now it sucks my curtains out of the window And beats them against the side of the house And tears them  I must get up and rescue the curtains  At the window incredible The full moon Large In a naked sky Looks down serenely on the anguished trees The stiff creaking branches the scurrying leaves Helpless undignified in frightened flight That monstrous moon That great strong big full moon Who sways a million tides with a little gesture That powerful insolent moon Looks down and tolerates the wind Bald sluggard moon lets the mad wind rage Countenances it Sheds shameless light on all its obscene passions  God I could hate the moon for this Is there no limit to indecency   Viola I Paradise  DEATH  To ache with unrest Stale hearted bored Oppressed by life by the futile motions of people Their footless eagerness their strife And their pale conversations This mood of death  But that other thing called death Which crumbles us up into good rich soil And sprouts grass over the place Or weeds What kind adjustment That trues one nicely to the universe And bestows the good gift the immortal insignificance Of a leaf or a grass blade Or one of the small stars  Viola I Paradise   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE MINSTREL  Woe My Lord Wind sings His voice is a harp a harp of a thousand strings His voice is a harp and he rides on swift and terrible wings  Woe My Lord Wind shrills And the pine trees mutter threats to their parent hills The ragged scrub oaks writhe and clash at fierce demoniac wills  Woe My Lord Wind rails And the young oak bends to the hiss of his stinging flails While the old oak breaks and the cowering pine tree wails  Woe My Lord Wind grieves And a plaintive echo stirs through the fallen leaves Like a child lorn mother s breast the grassy hill side heaves  Woe My Lord Wind cries And the word is a mad crescendo of sobs and sighs Then out in the far somewhere the voice of my Lord Wind dies   Ida Judith Johnson  FLOOD  Steeds Giant stallions that froth and champ Yellow plunging racers Leaping full at the barrier Leaping full at the barrier The thick masonry trembles crumbles They surmount it They rush on While the village sleeps Down the night wind Comes the thunder of their hoofs  O charging steeds Soon satiated You will be led back to your stalls Your frenzy past Your tawny manes smoothly shining Soon you will be led back Fed fat on human desolation Fed fat and tame  Ida Judith Johnson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NORTHERN LIGHTS  The moon has gone to her bed tonight And all over the sky She has hung out her garments of light To dry  I think I saw her at the day s break A morning or so ago Washing them down by the end of the lake Bending quite low So tired she was and pale  And now each shimmering veil Sea greens and sapphires Jeweled with orange fires Floats from the star she has pinned it to   THE SOWING Spring Fort Sheridan  Placid breezes sauntering Over a lake of glass Kissing the pouting elm buds Patting the new grass Turquoise overhead Swimming May skies Trench knives are top hole For gouging out their eyes   J Van Alstyne Weaver Jr  Great bees clover laden Solemnly drone past All the fresh world shouts Of spring come at last Bobolinks meadowlarks Bursting with May If you can t pull the bayonet out Shoot the body away  J Van Alstyne Weaver Jr  WE WHO HAVE LOST  They were pursuing us along the road My arm was gone and I was weak from loss of blood Presently a steel splinter ripped my belly I fell into the slimy ditch and struggled struggled  Soon an officer beneath me spoke through half a mouth Be quiet little brother and I will show you how to lie at  ease Now we are at rest The heavy tread of the victors shakes the earth The loose dirt falls from the side of the ditch Little by little  Howard Unger   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CLAUDE DEBUSSY  Man s music changes With the changing of his hours Though birds trill the same songs They trilled on Petra s towers  Always From olden hallways He led to beauty s ample rooms Out to her rain drenched garden s frond Out to her suns beyond beyond Ah did we call his art a whim Before we woke to him  High above war His music rising past the stars Is heard at heaven s door Heaven opens to the soul of song And unto art that never ends The soul of song ascends  Agnes Lee   IN A GALE  If he I love were on the sea My God how I would pray to Thee  And now I know that I should pray With urgent tears to Thee on high That Thou would st call Thy storm away Lest other women s loved ones die  And on my knees should supplicate With all the strength that in me lies For other women watch and wait With anguish written in their eyes  Lord show them pity evermore But I can neither weep nor pray For oh my dear is safe ashore And I go singing all the day  CONSCIENCE  Underneath the night sky and out upon the heath It makes a man feel lonesome and scared at a breath Maybe in the open you re nearer up to God  But set my feet in well worn paths that other feet have trod  Underneath the night sky the ghosts begin to creep Ghosts that cry of evil things long laid to sleep Little ghosts that whisper of a cold eternity  Oh give me friends and fireside to warm my soul and me Cecily Fryer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POMEGRANATES  Crimson as ever skin pomegranate wore When timid love first entered in Eleanore  Were those soft blushing cheeks of thine that flush no more Alas since they no more are mine Eleanore  White as the gleaming seeds within the cloven core Were thy soft hands so fair to win Eleanore  Which now withhold their benison and blessing nor Reach out in love to anyone Eleanore  Gold as the gold upon the stem or louis d or Thy locks were like the glint of them Eleanore  Sharper and sweeter were the lips I hungered for Than is the juicy fruit that drips Eleanore  Scarlet and rich red as a rose forevermore I think of lips another knows Eleanore  Ah no I ll not think that of thee I set more store Upon an unchanged memory Eleanore  Ripe was the scarlet fruit that fell The branch that bore  Must wait for winter snows Ah well Eleanore  Perhaps the spring will come again but nevermore The branch will bear what blossomed then Eleanore   Dean B Lyman Jr  That first full love that ripened red although we pour Upon it all the tears we shed Eleanore  Will never grow again Alas All that is o er With only grief that it should pass Eleanore  Crimson as ever fruit that grew and branches bore Will be the love not like we knew Eleanore  Which spring will yet bring forth for me but that s no score Whereon my heart can happy be Eleanore  Fair was the fruit I gathered first now as before That seems the best and worst Eleanore  Dean B Lyman Jr  LOVE LASTS LIKE A LILY  Love lasts like a lily Tender on Time s trail Breathing burning beauty Fragrant fine and frail  Solomon J D Fendell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  KINSHIP  I sit in the shade of a tree and sing Unto this wee mysterious thing Upon my breast my own and yet How could I more than I beget At the feather touch of searching lips Of tiny groping finger tips I know the surge of something more Deeper within than lived before As though when this was come to birth A largess more of heaven than earth Enriched my spirit making me A part of all Infinity  I am akin to this old tree Yet of a richer destiny Its shining leaves sing in the sun As I unto my little one We share creation s leap and thrill Yet hold I something stranger still What is this flaming tenderness What summons me to this caress O Power that gave make my love strong The sleeper stirs again my song Stills him to dreaming dreams of what Things I knew once and have forgot  Akin to all these growing things   Flora Shufelt Rivola  My eager spirit sunward springs And deep I sink my roots and deeper With each soft breath of the wee sleeper  Flora Shufelt Rivola  VOYAGE  Out of the night I hear a voice Out of the sea a cry The swift white arms of the reaching waves Toss as we pass them by The foam hands grasp in the emptiness And sink in the black to die  I lean to the night I lean to the sea T o the round on round of blue Where the barren stretch of the moon laced waves Divides the world in two There is no comfort in the dark I may not come to you  Hortense Flexne   BESS  The collie girl had the sense bred out of her But she had head and nose and points enough To make her a queen a fine queen with a ruff  Of satin and gold you d say instead of fur  She didn t deserve no doubt the hate she got She was so shy she d keep for whole days hid Folks wanted a dog to do better than she did  And thought it stubborn ungrateful like as not  Dede Graf the new man set himself to feed And win her and thought he d keep her in the shed Somebody s skeert her he d say and wag his head  He d no more luck than others had had Dede  Until the poor lonesome howling girl got big And no doubt dreamful of her pups to come One night she crept up shivering and dumb  And he saw her crouching underneath the rig  Lord when he d touched her once she was like a child She d cry and laugh together for the fun Of feeling his hand on her and then she d run  Like a curled streak of gold that made him wild  Before the pups came he had her at his call And other folk grew soft to her a bit She was a beauty that was all of it  And Dede was envied while the dogs were small   Orrick Johns  She weaned them and two died and the rest were given And Bess got offish as she was before Deed lured and wheedled and shook his fist and swore  His talk was somewhat strong when he was driven  It went on that way for three years about She d come to him and be a little saint Having her young and then the crazy taint  Would get her when the young ones were turned out  Dede was a Job for patience and no less When she d go shy again He d curse her leather Then at the sight of her like a tawny feather  Off in the field he d whine Hyuh Bess come Bess  He must have got to know her When she died The fellow was five foot ten and like an ox Fearful to see too pitted by smallpox Well he broke up for days that time and cried Orrick Johns   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE PAGEANT  Green the buds of Easter Warm the winds of May Autumn like a feaster  In merry disarray But Winter follows tracks him down Winter in his ermine gown  Youth in scarlet stockings Garlands for a crown Making mouths and mockings  After Age in brown But velvet never stood the rain And long s the road to the Keep o Spain  Love in silken weather Never yet was slain But love must take to leather  Hie him off again For Love must hang the sheriff saith The grizzled watchful sheriff Death  Morning night and morrow On through life and time For all the cares we borrow  For all the songs we rhyme Love and Youth will roister so And Age is patient Death is slow  Thomas Wood Stevens   ON THE ROAD  SONG OF YOUNG BURBAGE  The goat that rubbed my knees last night And left his ancient smell Maddened my heart that I was what A horned goat could tell  For if his favor singled me Out of the passing crowd I know I m not too well disguised Nor yet too worldly proud  Most difficult it is today Beneath a coat and vest I fear my old identity May fade with all the rest  But I ll go back to hill and sky And hold a colloquy need those ancient presences Whose tumult still is me  THE HERD BOY  The night I brought the cows home Blue mist was in the air And in my heart was heaven And on my lips a prayer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I raised my arms above me I stretched them wide apart And all the world was pressing In beauty on my heart  The lane led by a river Along an ancient wood And ancient thoughts came softly As with the leaves they should  I hung the cows with garlands And proud they walked before While mother naked after A laurel branch I bore  SHOES  I cannot put the old shoes on They re too far gone for wear And yet I cannot quite assume My newly purchased pair  The difficulty is extreme Since shoes are such a trial I guess that I d go happier Barefoot for a while   H aniel Long  THE CUBAN IN THE STATES  The North is beautiful and 1 Would like it but for me How bud the lips of woman by The soft Habana sea  And how can one who long has known The fragrance of this rose Keep from his frozen lips a moan Against the northern snows  I shiver at the closing white But on the sunburnt South I lie in an eternal night Of sighing mouth on mouth  MADNESS  The night came softly to the sea And they the seven stars to me  The sea the seven stars and I Gave an involuntary cry  It echoed in the hills and went The ways of old bewilderment  And I alone the reason knew And I had told it then to you  But stars are strange the sea is deep And you were lovely in your sleep   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES  They say that dead men tell no tales  Except of barges with red sails  And sailors mad for nightingales  Except of jongleurs stretched at ease  Beside old highways through the trees  Except of dying moons that break  The hearts of lads who lie awake  Except of fortresses in shade  And heroes crumbled and betrayed  But dead men tell no tales they say  Except old tales that burn away  The stifling tapestries of day  Old tales of life of love and hate  Of time and space and will and fate  A BOOK ON ECONOMICS  Between long rows of figures lurk  Pictures of little boys at work  And how poor women fade away  Page after page the margins say   Haniel Long  And in a note once in a while I see death freeze a baby s smile  THE CAUSE OF THIS I KNOW NOT  The cause of this I know not Whither they went nor why But I still remember the laughter And the bright eyes flashing by The day the girls were kissing The boys who had to die  I search in vain for the reason What does a poet know Only that youth is lovely Only that youth must go And hearts are made to be broken And love is always woe  SONG  Poppies paramour the girls Lilies put the boys to bed Death not other is than this After everything is said  They are safe and shall not fade After everything is done Past the solace of the shade Or the rescue of the sun   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  STAR DUST  Where past Time the roads go far Littered with dust of sun and star With sundered string and arrow sped The angels of the Lord lie dead  There lads of the impassioned races Reflect the night skies in their faces Boys eyes boys thoughts and bodies bright Are changing to eternal light  TH E TERROR  From Asiago to Cambrai From Vilna to the Aisne Each night the ghosts of soldiers say Don t let us die in vain  That they should come so far is strange Since death lays men so still But who can say where dead men range Or how they have their will  So through the night their tramp I hear Briton and Frank and Russ And through the night the thing they fear They whisper deep in us   H aniel Long  How shall we find a way to heal The terror of the slain To seek them out and make them feel They have not died in vain  SEEGER  The shapes of waking moments wearied him Heroic beauty stirred him as he slept And so he lived his youth and so he crept  Back to old shadows beautiful and dim  But at the call to arms his eyes were grim Dreams must be saved So he the dream adept Seeing young Death afar where horror swept  Leapt with a lover s trembling in each limb He sought her out he knew to be his maiden And cried to her he flamed for as his bride The thundering guns were viols for his suit And iron shards his couch The day was laden With scent of deadly blossoms and he died And now wrapt with his maiden he is mute  Haniel Long   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  MR BOURNE ON TRAPS  R RANDOLPH BOURNE in a recent issue of The Dial utters a solemn warning about Traps for the Unwary At first in passing he shows the unwary artist the open and obvious traps set by such intemperates as the philistine W C Brownell and Stuart P Sherman on one side of the road and the blustering H L Mencken on the other Both extremes he says are products of the smothering genteel tradition for both represent a moralism imperfectly transcended By a process of cancellation he gently persuades them to kill each other off  Their traps being quite conspicuous with teeth and springs on edge have ceased he thinks to be a menace even the halt and the blind can avoid them The real danger is a less evident trap in the dusty middle of the road a trap set once more but more beguilingly by that same genteel tradition  Let us look for the enemy of the literary artist in America today not among the philistines or the puritans among the animal obsessed novelists or the dainty professors who make Mr Mencken profane For the deadly virus of gentility is carried along by an up to date cultivated public small perhaps but growing who are all the more dangerous because they are so hospitable The would be literary artist needs to be protected not so much from his enemies as from his friends Puritan and professor may agree in their disgust at the creative imagination at work in America but it is not their hostility which keeps it from being freer and more expressive The confusing force is rather an undiscriminating approval on the part of a public who want the new without the unsettling The current popularity of verse the vogue of the little theatres and the little   Mr Bourne on Traps  magazines reveal a public that is almost pathetically receptive to anything which has the flavor or the pretension of literary art The striving literary artist is faced by no stony and uncomprehending world Almost anyone can win recognition and admiration But where is the criticism that will discriminate between what is fresh sincere and creative and what is merely stagy and blatantly rebellious  There we have it the literary artist in America can escape traps only by putting himself under guidance the wary guidance of the sound and superior critic A new criticism has to be created etc  Far be it from us to deny the value of sound criticism Mr Bourne though somewhat over weighted with glittering generalities is strictly in order in keeping a watchful eye out for traps and Miss Lowell s book on Tendencies which he praises is valuable whether we agree with her conclusions or not as an effort to clear the road and set American poetry in its proper array The only trouble with Mr Bourne is a natural over emphasis of the critic s importance The critic is important perhaps over important to the public Mr Bourne s pathetically hospitable or pathetically contemptuous public which likes to be told what it should think but he is not very important to the artist that desperate spiritual outlaw with the lust to create whom Mr Bourne almost intemperately longs for with to use his own phrase a sort of joyful perversity  To the artist I repeat the critic is not very important especially the professional critic who would soundly and sanely guide him past all manner of traps What is important to the artist is his chance to be seen or heard his chance   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of a frugal living while he is doing his work his chance of admission to the society of his peers whoever these may prove to be among the dead or living These three things the artist must have if he is not to starve physically mentally or spiritually and the most well meaning and highly intel lectualized criticism though proceeding from the Delphic seat of the oracle cannot give him one of them  With all due deference to Mr Bourne are not the little theaters and the little magazines which he so gently deprecates doing more to supply the essential needs of the poet and the playwright than any amount of the new criticism could We have heard during the last five years a chorus of voices uttering criticism new and old trained voices with every right to competence but we have yet to hear that any of this clamor has either influenced or especially served or hindered any poet or playwright in doing his work The little theaters and little magazines on the contrary have greatly served him by presenting his art to his world as they have quite incidentally greatly served the critic by enabling him to function Through these exhibition places the literary artist has been enabled to try out his experiments the only process whereby he can learn They have done a little also a very little alas to help him earn his living And they have done a good deal to introduce him to his contemporary peers and to help him place himself among them and get from them that random violence of praise or blame which inspires him more than the most reasoned criticism of self elected minds   Mr Bourne on Traps  There is much truth in what Mr Bourne says of the danger for the artist which lurks in pink tea adulation and the impeccable social tone of certain quasi literary groups No one can deny that our good natured American hospitality sets an insidious trap the terrible glamor of social patronage which so easily blunts idealism in the young prophet Perhaps however it is a weak grade of idealism that is so easily blunted and the true prophet will survive tea and toast as of yore he survived cakes and ale or sesame seed and Falernian  In Mr Bourne s terrors there may be just a hint of that ancient deep seated prejudice in favor of penury for a poet With a few exceptions the precedents would seem to be against its being an advantage Few of the great poets of all nations had the bad luck to starve and most of them endured without quailing the terrible glamor of social patronage from kings and courts millionaires and great ladies In fact it is doubtful if the modern American poet or artist runs any more danger from intemperate social influences than Chaucer did or Holbein Shakespeare or Sophocles Phidias or Li Po or Leonardo da Vinci  Mr Bourne ends his article with a definition of the kind of man who is to give us a literary art which will combine a classical and puritan tradition with the most modern ideas Maybe his rather formidable array of qualities hits off the prodigy I wouldn t venture to say because a five years intimacy with poets makes me hesitate to affirm or deny anything about them But I feel quite sure that the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  prodigy once achieved will not worry his mind about getting intelligent pertinent absolutely contemporaneous criticism which shall be both severe and encouraging That in spite of Mr Bourne is not the problem of the literary artist nor will his problem be solved when the artist himself has turned critic and set to work to discover and interpret in others the motives and values and efforts he feels in himself He will have more important things than this to do His problem will be as it always has been to get himself expressed in his art and to get his art before his public And the only aid which he will recognize is that which forwards these ends H M  OUR CONTRIBUTORS  Have you ever gentle reader been asked to squeeze yourself into about three lines of biography If not just try it You will realize then how far from descriptive are the few identifying facts which are all that you can summon to mind in regard to your past history and career or your present occupation how little of the color and flavor of your actually rich personality these give You might just as well write I have a birth mark on my left heel or send in a Bertillon print of your thumb  Will you be kind enough to tell us something about yourself to go into our contributors column  Of course it is only the young poor or obscure who have such requests forwarded to them Thomas Hardy or Ella Wheeler Wilcox or Rudyard Kipling would never be asked   Our Contributors  to explain themselves to reduce all their existence to a bare three lines And then what three lines shall one choose How granted that one is until now unknown how does one wish to be known  Suppose the contributor is a professor of English in a middle western college What has the perfunctory correcting of themes to do with his life as a poet Has he published a book of verse Yes and hopes that it may be forgotten at least until he is a very old old man Or perhaps he is the sub editor of a magazine with whose policies he is not altogether in sympathy Should this connection be advertised or concealed How will the admission affect his literary career How does he wish to go down to posterity  Ah what glowing accounts of oneself one could write if one but dared give way to the methods of the press agent heralding a new author The kind that appears on the slipcover so remarkable in itself that one almost forbears reading the work enclosed Indeed it is rumored that nowadays the authors themselves often write these notices but the youthful contributor is probably ignorant of this_fact  Editors little know the amount of trepidation self analysis doubt alternate pride and discouragement occasioned by the receipt of one of these seemingly innocent requests I myself had one sent to me the other day and it took me three days to answer it And this after consuming much foolscap and wasting much midnight oil is what I finally wrote   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  John Smith contributor of verse and prose to all the leading magazines It has a ringing sound and furnishes a complete alibi  A C H  REVIEWS  THOMAS HARDY S POETRY  Moments of Vision by Thomas Hardy Macmillan Co  If one were to pick out at random a hundred readers of English poetry and ask them the question Who is the greatest English poet to day about ninety eight would instantly reply Kipling The remainder might be indecisive or might cast their votes for Masefield or for Yeats forgetting that the latter is an Irishman Nobody probably would remark Thomas Hardy And yet there is no doubt that Mr Hardy is the greatest English poet now living No one among his contemporaries has been able to turn aside from verse writing for twenty years and to return to it with the selfsame powerful grip and mastery No one has been able to construct a poem of the dynamic energy and epic calibre of The Dynasts but he No one finally but he is able at the patriarchal age of seventy seven to produce poems marked with the same poignant sincerity of accent that he displayed at thirty  If we leave Mr Hardy out of the account as a poet the whole picture not only of English literature but of English thought and feeling in the past twenty years is likely to become distorted For it has been as he himself might say   Thomas Hardy s Poetry  now twenty years since he turned back to his early love the muse from the production of novels And during that long and dreary time when English imaginative literature seemed crushed and lost he has been the one figure with strength and dignity and a new message to speak a message nevertheless intimately linked with England s past After the giants of mid Victorianism Tennyson Browning and Swinburne had written the works by which they are now remembered and had either passed to their reward or lapsed into the condition of echoes after this period the stage was set for smaller men Two spirits only remained with vitality and power enough to pronounce a new message These were Meredith and Hardy And Meredith it is increasingly evident was to Hardy what a sentimental invalid of a woman is to a firm well knitted man Meredith softened as he went on softened and decayed Thomas Hardy has shown no need either to soften or to harden He was granite from the beginning  What then is the reason for Mr Hardy s unpopularity as a poet It has been suggested that it is because he uses a language deliberately unpoetical deliberately gray in tone But we are all of us weary of the old poetic diction which is utterly inapplicable to modern conditions and ideas And that Hardy eschews rhetoric is perhaps the greatest thing to his credit The secret of the obscure dislike of his work is found in the fact that Hardy is by temperament and mind a fatalist a determinist a pessimist This sort of writer always makes us uncomfortable when he appears amongst   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  us We do not mind reading Job or Ecclesiastes because after all they lived a long time ago But when a man of our own day arises and informs us that in his deliberate opinion our present day world with all its thought and activities is just so much dust and ashes we wish to stone the fellow We cannot bear to have our illusions about ourselves so ruthlessly destroyed And yet no one has asked the question whether Thomas Hardy has not some reason some tremendous vital quite impersonal reason for his pessimism  Hardy represents an England which is older than the Saxons older perhaps than Julius Caesar He stands for the England that from time immemorial has been an island separated from the traffic and commerce of a busy world by treacherous seas and climates and lapped and swathed in endless folds of agrarian conservatism He hails as the whole world knows from Dorset from that part of England which has been least disturbed by foreign currents which has never been industrialized which has preserved most intact the old country life of the past with all its narrowness and parochialism He is the one English writer of our day who has never felt the necessity or desirability of emigrating to London Even the technique of his poetry betrays over and over again the strong atavistic tendency in Hardy s soul He is obsessed by ballad refrains by folk songs psalm tunes Nothing is more striking in him than the contrast between the jingling fall of the rhymes and the gloomy tragic matter they contain For example this taken at random from his latest volume   Thomas Hardy s Poetry  They sing their clearest songs He she all of them yea Treble and tenor and bass And one to play With the candles mooning each face Ah no the years O How the sick leaves reel down in throngs  Could anyone write like that whose brain was not packed with the lilt of half forgotten ballads  But the thing that sets apart Hardy from his fellows is that while most of these still maintain the respectable and preposterous fiction that England is just as much of an island as ever vide Kipling for instance in his later works Hardy knows better He knows that since the discovery of steam the consequent industrialisation and to crown all the adoption by England of free trade England has effectually ceased to be able to maintain an isolated and independent position in the world and is now even more dependent on foreign commerce than many nations whose literary and artistic development has been more elastic more alive to modern currents of thought and feeling than hers So Hardy has set himself the task of putting on record the shrivelling the decay of the old insular England and in this sense as I have already said he is the one great living link between nineteenth and twentieth century England He is also the one English poet who has written soberly and beautifully of Trafalgar and of Waterloo because he knew at the time what we now all see to be the truth that Trafalgar and Waterloo were not going to be repeated and are as remote in fact from the conceptions of an industrialized democracy as the Pyramids   Hence Hardy became inevitably a pessimist and a fatalist The atavistic current of England s bucolic existence which had flowed for so many centuries about his sires was coming to an end when he happened to be born Coming to an end also was the old childlike faith in a paternal Deity and in a special protecting Providence of that Deity Hardy was the first the very first writer to carry to its logical end the scientific agnosticism which after all was only a somewhat dilettante pose in Matthew Arnold He says in effect Very well if you say there is no Deity in the personal sense but only an abstract impersonal unknowable Primal Force or Energy or Will then what is to hinder this force or will or energy from acting utterly unjustly brutally maliciously And the answer is Nothing So Hardy proceeds further and suspiciously collects all the evidence he can find in favor of such a view and says There you are draw your own conclusions The only question is does Hardy deliberately and of malice prepense suppress other evidence favorable to the activities of the Unknown Cosmic Force I do not think so and even if he does so grim and fact facing an attitude is to my mind infinitely finer and stronger than Meredith s somewhat waterish hope that the world is improving through man s unaided effort  Hardy has been therefore without consciously desiring it an iconoclast and as with all iconoclasts one gets the impression in reading him closely of a voice crying in the wilderness of a new John the Baptist proclaiming that the axe is laid at the roots of the trees I have said that Hardy   Thomas Hardy s Poetry  is unconsciously an iconoclast It has been his misfortune to live in an iconoclastic age and to mourn over the shattered past His youth he spent in drawing old churches threatened with restoration His old age he spends in proclaiming that the faith that reared those churches is shattered beyond hope of a restoration and that the ways of God to man are in fact unjustifiable And yet and yet he is one who has an eye for the mysteries of nature and has lived in such close communion with nature that nature has become to him a living presence silent indeed and mysteriously cruel but even more mysteriously consoling and supporting Is it then that Hardy is almost ready to say that the forces of nature the wind the sea the earth the rain the fire birth and death are almost gods and after all the only gods man needs He leaves us to draw the inference At least he can sing about them almost light heartedly contrasting the beauty and power they give to man with war s horror and desolation  Only a man harrowing clods  In a slow silent walk  With an old horse that stumbles and nods  Half asleep as they stalk  Only thin smoke without flame From the heaps of couch grass Yet this will go on the same Though Dynasties pass  Yonder a maid and her wight Come whispering by War s annals will cloud into night Ere their story die  John Gould Fletcher   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE LATE EDWARD THOMAS  Poems by Edward Thomas Henry Holt amp Co  Edward Thomas who published his verse under the pseudonym of Edward Eastaway was killed at Arras on Easter Monday 1917 Although the war is barely mentioned in these poems one is conscious of it perpetually as a part of the background as we fancy the author was It is not alone responsible of course for the tinge of melancholy or sadness in the poems which was no doubt temperamental but it seems to run through the volume like a dark stream now hidden now rising to the surface From the poems one may imagine that this poet s attitude toward the war was fatalistic that is that he accepted it quite apart from all question of the righteousness of the cause as one accepts Fate in the Greek drama an attitude which many of emotional temperament without primary interest in action or politics must share The war is there It can not be escaped Statistics and world politics mean nothing to poetry which is after all concerned with very small things with Helen s beauty or the friendship of Achilles and Patroclus the fate of the individual man Nature and love and friendship are indeed the soul of poetry and war s greatest wrong is against these Therefore the poet marches darkly to his fate But not before he has seen all things swept away even love and though a new birth may come he will not share in the awakening  I have come a long way to day On a strange bridge alone   The Late Edward Thomas  Remembering friends old friends I rest without a smile or moan As they remember me without smile or moan  All are behind the kind And the unkind too no more To night than a dream The stream Runs softly yet drowns the Past The dark lit stream has drowned the Future and the Past No traveller has rest more blest Than this brief moment between Two lives when the Night s first lights And shades hide what has never been Things goodlier lovelier dearer than will be or have been  What is it that we find in Edward Thomas s poems the distinctive personal note To me it seems as if this man looked on fields roads and countryside as if to impress them forever on his mind He seems to give to his landscape that poignancy that a familiar scene has for us when we see it in the light of some strong personal emotion and to carry this quality of intensified vision about with him so that every small detail endowed with the poet s imagination acquires a life of its own Thus lie makes an old manor farm live in a light of eternity  The church and yew And farmhouse slept in a Sunday silentness The air raised not a straw The steep farm roof With tiles duskily glowing entertained The mid day sun and up and down the roof White pigeons nestled There was no sound but one Three cart horses were looking over a gate Drowsily through their forelocks swishing their tails Against a fly a solitary fly  But twas not Winter Rather a season of bliss unchangeable   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Awakened from farm and church where it had lain Safe under tile and thatch for ages since This England Old already was called Merry  He gives us a sense of contact with nature vital with experience and back of it a continuous searching for reality I wish I could quote in this connection The Glory which could only be quoted entire and also Melancholy The Long Small Room When First October Rain and many other poems that have this special significance  Mr Thomas s verse has come under various influences not the least of which is a sort of Celtic waywardness with perhaps a tinge of the homely homespun of Robert Frost In the latter aspect Mr Thomas like Mr Frost is content to give us little character studies or vistas as of a copse or a field which have a quiet charm in themselves and lead nowhere else His poems are low toned and quiet almost subdued but in this very quiet is their beauty It is a twilight country mellow and rich but very cool and clear in tone One feels that the subjective Celtic element is the most instinctive with the poet the most inherent Some of the poems are a little obscure at first Mr Thomas was at no pains to write for the public he has been content to record his own experiences as they came to him and that is why the poems are so richly personal He has not written with the world looking over his shoulder and it may be fancy but one detects in these poems a certain proud withdrawal from a world that could find nothing better than literary hackwork for a man of his temperament to do He had written many books and if as has been said it was   The Late Edward Thomas  Robert Frost who first furnished the impulse that liberated some hidden spring and permitted the man to express himself in verse then we have every reason to feel indebted to Mr Frost for the revelation of this sensitive poetic mind This inter action of poets one upon another when it occurs not in the sense of imitation but of creative quickening is a very inspiriting thing One could wish that there might be more of it and less of poets tearing other poets to pieces in the press for the sake of a very doubtful publicity It is not as many seem to think a mark of final superiority to be able to detect weaknesses in a work of art it requires a much greater skill and intelligence to recognize the virtues  Not all of Mr Thomas s poems are included in this volume In February 1917 two months before his death a group of them was published in POETRY and one is disappointed to find that neither these nor the poems which appeared in An Annual of New Poetry IÇ17 are included here One hopes that a complete collection may be published later There is a great deal of modern poetry which one does not care to read a second time but one who likes these poems will care to read them many times each time with a new appreciation of their beauty A C H  RALPH HODGSON AGAIN  The Last Blackbird by Ralph Hodgson Macmillan Co  Have publishers no literary conscience or do they lack critical perception basing all their enterprise on a sort of hit or miss calculation of what the market will be And   once an author is established is his subsequent work immune from further critical scrutiny by the publisher  One is moved to such conjecture in reading this second book by Ralph Hodgson so noticeably inferior to his first that one can only regard its publication as a mistake In fact those critics who recently championed Mr Hodgson s work against adverse criticism will find little here to sustain their enthusiasm All the qualities that made for both the success and the weakness of the first book are here in a kind of obscure excess One concludes therefore that these poems must be earlier in composition at least it is kinder to believe so By comparison the first book assumes a perhaps undue importance Certainly no one questioned Mr Hodgson s skill he is quite truly an artificer in rhyme But this is quite different from being a great artist in rhyme And one may very properly admire the one without giving it the prestige of the other Mr Hodgson has an almost automatic facility as evident in some of his serious poems as in Human Ambition and Big Behaviour in which he hits off this very facility or in My Books in which he plays deftly with rhymes The poems in this second book however lack the clarity of those in the first The longer poems here ma ander vaguely to a vague conclusion The Last Blackbird is about the last blackbird in the world and a long conversation with Nature in which that lady promises something like a flood in return for man s disregard and destruction of herself This feeling for outraged nature is Mr Hodgson s most characteristic note St Athelstan is   Ralph Hodgson Again  a narrative poem rather obscure because of the literary language and inversions In The Last Blackbird too we find this outworn poetic phrasing  My head was tired I had no mind to think Of Beauty wronged and none to give redress I got me to a place where linnets drink And lizards go in ferny loveliness  A blackbird sang so down I fell meseemed Soothed by his note I closed a drowsy lid And I was ventured on a dream I dreamed One stood and questioned me how linnets did  And straight I knew who thus in angel guise Would have my news some trick of lip or brow Guessed me her rank I said not otherwise Than ill indeed it went with linnets now  Would we confine modern architecture to English Gothic Or if we take exception to contemporary copies of English Gothic should it be inferred that we therefore have no appreciation of the original  The shorter poems in this book as in the first are the best Thrown Hammers Beauty Sprite and The Rose have the brevity the directness the swift vivid touch typical of Mr Hodgson s most distinctive work But one who wishes to know Mr Hodgson at his best will have to return to the Poems A C H  IRISH EARTH  Earth of Cualann by Joseph Campbell With Twenty one Designs by the Author Maunsel and Co Ltd Dublin In A Gilly of Christ and The Mountainy Singer Mr  Campbell contributed some very beautiful lyrics to the Irish   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Renaissance lyrics which seem to me to have more individuality and spontaneity than this group of poems in Unrhymed cadence many of them with a touch of Biblical solemnity and phrasing Readers of POETRY will recall The Stranger At Dawn and At Samhain published in this magazine In these as in the other poems in this book one feels a fine sense of quantitative rhythm a sure sense of the musical phrase but the image is seldom inevitable it remains rather as a sort of suspended simile the two parts do not quite knit  The days of my life Come and go  One is a black valley Rising to blue goat parks On the crowns of distant hub 1 hear the falling of water And the whisper of ferns tongues And still more I hear The silence  In the following complete poem the scene is set but nothing really happens  How still the night The air a fragrance fallen from unseen wings The pine trunks stones of some dark and secret temple Venus a lantern burning without flame  But my soul is not still The wind blows bitterly The pines groan on their rock nourished roots The stars are blotted out  In a word the poems seem to promise more than is really concealed in their depths The manner is grave measured and assured even solemn and one is led to expect more   Irish Earth  than one receives It may be of course that I do not possess the key to some secret understanding At any rate whether the fault be mine or the poet s I remain unsatisfied  A C H  THE MUSE OF COMPLIMENT  The Poems of Frank Dempster Sherman edited with an  Introduction by Clinton Scollard Houghton Mifflin Co  Here is my old friend Frank Dempster Sherman proudly set forth in an édition de luxe Poet and professor of mathematics he was as genial as he was versatile and all who had ever known him grieved when they heard of his death over a year ago He was only fifty six years old when the summons came  He was very modest about his poetry I have dollars for Milton or Shelley but none for Sherman he replied to a publisher who had suggested that he pay for printing one of his early books And once he said to me If I keep my hand in my technique in order some day I may be lucky enough to write a song that will live And that s worth working for all one s life one song that will live Or as he rhymed it later in Desire  Of all the threads of rhyme Which I have spun I shall be glad if Time Save only one  And I would have each word To joy belong A lyric like a bird Whose soul is song   Did he attain it Who attains his desire His name is not married to a song like Julia Ward Howe s to The Battle Hymn of the Republic which by the way is being sung all over the English speaking world at war as the long sought international hymn And reading this book one finds no memorable poem lifting out of the ripple of delicate rhyme What one does find is fancy and good taste the extreme of good breeding and good breeding stifles the impassioned muse  But the muse of the drawing room the muse of satins and chiffons or be it even prints and twills thrives upon good breeding demands fancy and good taste If there is never a note of passion in this book there is much admirable vers de société and a few library poems of undeniable charm In such poems as To a Rose he may have achieved his im  mortality along with Locker Austin Dobson and other masters of compliment Go Rose and in her golden hair You shall forget the garden soon The sunshine is a captive there And crowns her with a constant noon And when your spicy odor goes And fades the beauty of your bloom Think what a lovely hand O Rose Shall place your body in a tomb H M   CORRESPONDENCE  HARD AND SOFT  Editor of POETRY The interesting discussion on The Hard and the Soft in French Poetry which appeared in your February issue scarcely gets to the root of its subject In it as your readers may remember Mr Pound declared that hardness is in poetry nearly always a virtue I can think of no case where it is not and also softness an opposite quality which is not always a fault Then he went on to illustrate this thesis with examples drawn from French and English literature  The fact is that there are two kinds of poetical emotion the musical and the pictorial These qualities may be perfectly fused in the poet or one may preponderate over the other For example the poet may see his subject as a hard clear pictorial outline something to be cut in Parian marble this is what Gautier did Or he may see his subject as something containing rich musical possibilities cunning variations of sound adroit combinations of vowels and consonants This is undoubtedly what Poe did or Coleridge in Christabel The subject of Christabel or of most of Poe s poems is the veriest nonsense when coldly analyzed what makes them poems of an uncommon sort is their power of musical suggestion  Shakespeare is almost the sole English poet in whom the pictorial and the musical are perfectly blended Milton Browning Blake tended to the pictorial that is to say they   became as Mr Pound calls it hard This hardness is not always as he says a virtue in fact it may easily defeat its own ends  There is so little clear headed thinking about poetry and the issue is so consistently befogged with critics who have this or that particular hobby to ride that it is always wise to remind the reader that the substance of poetry is language human speech words Now with words the mind refuses to be arrested at the outer aspect Not many people in this world can read a page of either poetry or prose without a thought of its meaning But dozens can admire a picture by let us say Sargent purely because of the technical quality of its surface of its drawing and paint  For this reason good poets who are purely pictorial that is to say hard are rare and equally rare the good poets who are purely musical that is to say soft Most poets achieve a sort of blend of both qualities But to rank the hard poet over the soft or vice versa is an error Verlaine whose imagination was purely musical is as great in his own way as Villon whose imagination was purely pictorial I can take pleasure from either  The thing that counts with a poet is not whether he tries to be hard or soft but rather as Mr Pound says whether he has been intent on the quality of the emotion he wants to convey and whether he has perfectly conveyed that quality John Gould Fletcher   As He Sees It  AS HE
