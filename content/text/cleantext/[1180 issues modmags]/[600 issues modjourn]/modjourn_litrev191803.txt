PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MANLike some of the best novels in the world it is the story of an educationit is by far the most living and convincing picture that exists of an Irish Catholic upbringingIt is a mosaic of jagged fragments that does altogether render with extreme completeness the growth of a rather secretiveimaginative boy in DublinThe technique is startlingbut on the whole it succeedsThe interest of the book depends entirely upon its quintessential and unfailing realityOne believes in Stephen Dedalus as one believes in few characters in fiction HGWells in The New RepublicDUBLINERSAs a delineator of the more sombre aspects of Dublin life MrJames Joyce is unequalledFor him it has remained inDublinersto illuminate with a searching flood of imagination and sympathetic understanding whole tracts of middle class life in the gray and laughing cityHe invests with a convincing reality and an abiding human significance what are apparently the most trivial and insignificant happenings The NationHe is a genuine realisthe puts in the exaltations as well as the depressionsthe inner life as well as the outerSpiritual passions are as powerful to him as physical

the debate shall continueYou seem to desire a debate to the deathI don t know why my coming to Russia should have provoked this stubborn battle in your brainthis kind of revolution against RussiaI suppose you are pretty jealous of this immense landand you perhaps feel that my liaison with it is hardly intellectually respectableRussia is too elementaryHoweverto approach your latest objectionsMine is not really a case ofnational engouementas you would persuade meonly engouement for Russian things instead of those of my own country All Russian books of the last twenty years that I have read are disappointing Sanineis certainly not as good as Bernard ShawGorky was the best figureand writerLiving hereyou can get a better sense of the books of the Russian writers of the last centurybut it is not like living among their booksNor are the people around you as prepossessing as the fictitious nationBut where would art be if they wereThe Russian novelists have given an almost unexampled illusion of a living peopleTheir Christianitygood sense and the method of realism each contributed to thisNot only are most Russians not Dostoevskysthey are not even Volchaninovs or Pavel PavlovitchesRaskolnikoffs and Golyadkins mope and trot about in certain membersbut they badly need the presence of their creatorWhen they were looked at by their great brother he entered into them as he looked and they ran mad at onceeventually exploding with energyThere are masses of the cheaply energetic Orientalnon Jewand of the unsatisfactory TeutonicThe springs of Dostoevsky s imagination I have chiefly found in thickpungentsuddenly discovered Oasesin familiesrestaurants or moods 24 The Little Review of the townBut it is only the books that matterAnd the Russian novels were made with this materialcondensedvividly exploitedThey are better books than any Englishman or Frenchman wrote at the same periodnot because genius variesbut because the material was richer and reallerWhen an Englishman was given a similar chancewe threw up ShakespeareWilliam Blake pushed on into the unimanent atmosphere of spooks and of legend and produced a powerful group of phantomsHe vituperated his enemies enemies are always real and interestingand plagiarised children and ElizabethansIn that waywith a queer and clever engineering of his ownhe climbed up where Shakespeare and all successful genius resideshe established himself there as a matter of coursewith a proselytizing lack of self consciousness he took up his abode in that simple and exclusive heaven first having enthusiastically removed all his clothesNowwe can admit that a nation is not necessary for a fine bookIf the human material should be found faultyyou can turn to scorpions and beetlesorlike Blakeyou can affect the heavily historied bogeyawaken the man who built the Pyramids and pretend that it was he who awakened youAnd there is the scholar s bookwhich is merely embarrassed by a handy matterwhich naturally thrives on the remotenot brought to new lifematterbut leftwhere it iswith its academic perspectivesor whose only interest or use for immediate things is dispassionate and critical and whose success is

untidy and undependable freak of vastnessaddicted to interminable nervous seizuresdo you know of a single story of his in which there is not an epilepticdrunken to a faultbut a true godAnd every Russian I meet I know to be a posthumous fragment of my favourite DeitySo there you areIt is useless your talking aboutnational engouements it is idle your hinting that my caprice for Colossiand such dirtyuncouth and childish ones at that not nice clean Greek ones is unintelligent and compromisingYou stick to the gentlemanly silver buzzing of the French critical perfectionI wish to live in the

unfortunate that we have not had it outbeforeand gazed at it in mutual horrorI refer to my uglinessThe horrible thought steals over me as I write this that you may have thought I considered myself handsome or at least uniqueAnd I even seem to remember occasions on which you looked quizzingly and pityingly at me when I was speaking of beautyas though you considered that I would not have spoken in that way had I not imagined that I had my share of looksAlso I do notlet me say for your instructionconsider myself tallUnlike most little menI know that I am short and stuntedAnd as to my looksthere is no blotch or puff in my face with which I am not bitterly acquaintedI know that my lower lip protrudes 26 The Little Reviewill temperedlyMy hands are a Palagial nightmareou plutôt

physiqueI should never have marriedI am awareThank GodYorketoy a miraclethe miracle of your beautyI supposeappears to have escaped the contamination of my flesh or to have sailed over it in some wayBut how horrible it must toe for youmy dear girlA score of times I have said to myself that I would not come back to youbut release you from such a repulsive little satyrAll cats are grey in the

latelyYour letters are curiousYou seem to be becoming unduly critical of my minda tendency you have not formerly displayedAre you accusing my mind of what you would really say of my bodyIs it because you have never been harsh enough to curse and comment upon my distressing personthat you now attack my mindMust you abuse and at last complain of somethingPerhaps this letter may deflect your criticism into its natural channelOr do you consider my mental enthusiasms part and parcel of my uglinessDo you see my twisted and thwarted body with a wave of exasperationin my enthusiasm for the epileptic pages of the unfortunate FeodorOne truthhoweverI have tested enough for it to be no more experimentalI am fixed on thatThe body does not matter the smallest fraction where the mind is concernedI can imagine beauty as fluently and fully as if I had the head of ApolloThe smallness of my eyes does not contract the surging and spreading of my understandingThe twists in a body can only impress themselves on a spirit that dwells constantly thereinMine comes back to its disgraceful bedand lies cramped and ill in itBut it was nurtured straight before it ever lay thereA fine and comely appearance is useful for repose onlyGoethe s god like person gave him plenty of calm sleepIf I said too much you would sneer and think that the grapes were sour If my body were weakly and sick and my mind were one of those that had the power to go here and there and break into other mindsthat body would not prevent me from imagining physical heroismOr ratherI could imagine it no better if my mind had been originally installed in a sinewy carcaselike Hackensmidt sI am debarred from nothing in my worldonly from youI know I have not got you as I otherwise shouldI know it was madness to choose

a limit beyond which they are likely to regard their proverbial fairness as inadequateMy faceI am awareis far the other side of that limitYou know how physical beauty knocks me overThebeautiful young

to meMy facelike some belching ocean plantspread towards the lightseems to expand in front of his comeliness in the idiotic hope of a cureSuch boys are as soothing as rain to a man with a feverAnd

Man he desired that Man should have a companionSo he took the coldness of ice and the heat of fire and the softness of the dove s breast and the ferocity of the tiger and the fidelity of the Chakrawakra and the untrustworthyness of the Bandalog and the humility of the gazelle and the vanity of the peacock and the soft and weeping voice of the nightingale and the loquacity of the mocking bird and of all these ingredients he fashioned WomanAnd Man rejoiced in his companion and went away with herBut within a fortnight he returned to Ghama and said Oh Ghama take away this creature with which thou hast afficted mefor all day she chatters so that my head is like to burst and all night she is never silent so that I am unable to get any sleep and her laugh is as discordant as the cracking of pine trees in a galeAnd water pours unceasingly from her eyes so that life is a burden to me Then Ghama took Woman to himself againBut within a week the man came back to Ghama and said Oh Ghama give me back again her that you have takenFor my ears crave incessantly for the soft laughter of her voice so that by day I have no restAnd at night I am consumed as if by fire with the desire of her warm caressesBy day the light of the sun is a burden if I have not her companionship in the shade of the desert and at night the light of the moon is blighted if she is not with me when I walk by the broad and misty expanses of the river Then Gama gave Woman back to ManAnd within three days Man came back again to Ghama and said Oh Great God Ghama take away now again this creature with which thou hast cursed meFor she is possessed of all those evils which before I reported to you and in a ten times worse degreeThe Little Review So that in truth I cannot support my life with herNeither canst thou live without her said GhamaThen said Man Oh Ghamawhat sort of a creature is this thou hast created since I cannot live either with her or without herThat I cannot tell you Ghama answeredThe Digit of the MoonI was once very well acquainted with two Russian exiles who had escaped from the East of SiberiaThey had gone overlandhiding in forestscrossing immense desertsswimming broad rivers and avoiding humanity except when it was absolutely necessary for them to purchase food at the hut of a nativeAt the start they were the best of friendsTheir tastestheir aimstheir political aspirations and their friendships they both held in commonThere was nothing about which they could differ but the journey the desolate and solitary journey lasted for months and months over that immense stretch of territoryThey were absolutely alonethey spoke to no other soulAnd gradually these two men who had as it were their souls in commonwho suffered the same perilswho relied upon each other s help to overcome the same difficulties gradually these two men began to differThey differed about the uniform of the convict guards on the island of Sagalienabout the date of the birth of Ivan the Terribleabout the doctrines of Karl MarxThe quarrels grew more and more bitterthey were entirely aloneAt last they travelled each upon the further horizonjust keeping each other in sight but never speakingnever shaking handsSo it went on for months and monthsAnd one of my friends assured me that if the other man united to him in soul and purpose had come near himsuch was his nervous exacerbation that he would undoubtedly have shot his companion and have perished miserably himselfOn the other hand when for a whole day he lost sight of his friend he nearly went mad from loneliness It was very funny he said reflectively I could neither live with him nor without him It is such a journey as this over the months and years of time and the forests and deserts of a life time that a man undertakes when he selects a woman for his mate and sets outAnd it will be observed that the words used by my Russian friend about his companion are identical with those used by man about woman in the The Little Review Sudian legend that I have quoted The Englishman s mind is of course made up entirely of quotationsA person entirely without intellect himselfhe is the man of all the world who best knows his poetsAnd the poets best known to him are of course Shakespeare and the English translators of the BibleWhen his quotations do not come from either Shakespeare or the Bible he thinks they doso that it comes to the same thingThe moment you put before him any argument he at once floors you with a quotation which has a Biblical or a Shakespearean ringIt will be observed that the experience of Flaubert and his friend was exactly parallel to that of my two RussiansYetDu Camp never said that Flaubert was like a womanHe just said that the great writer got on his nervesThe Englishman has of course two quotations about womanOne of them generally he knows to come from Byron and the other from the Vicar of WakefieldOh woman in our hours of ease And When lovely woman stoops to follySo that outside Shakespeare he gathers that woman is uncertain coy and hard to please which is all that he knows of the quotation from ByronHe also gathers from Goldsmith that she finds too late that men betrayand this makes him rather proud of himself as a potentialgay dog To the Bible he goes for guidance as a rule upon most mattersexcept about womenHe regards of course the Holy Scriptures NoteSuch instances are by no means uncommon when two men set out upon journeys togetherThere is an exactly parallel instance in the case of Flaubert and Maxime du CampThey journeyed together into the deserts of EgyptThey were the closest of friendsBut at one time the society of Flaubert got to such an extent on the nerves of Du Camp thatsays ce cher Maxime Je n y tins plusune pensée terrible me secoua Je me dis je vais le tuerJe poussai mon dromadaire jusqu à le toucherje lui pris le bras Ou veux tu te tenirEn arrière ou en avant Il me repondit J irai en avant J arrêtai mon dromadaire at quand notre petite troupe fut a deux cents pas en avant de moije repris ma marcheLe soir je laissai Flaubert au milieu de nos hommes et j allai preparer mon lit de sable a plus de deux cents metres du campement as works too sacred to be used in the acquiring of merely worldly knowledgeThe only women that he much considers in the Bible are Delilah and RuthThe Virgin Mary he does not much care to think abouthis tendency is faintly to regard Her as an improper member of an otherwise respectable familyHe is not a very logical personGod s EnglishmanDelilah he will not much think of because he wears his hair shortBut when it comes to Ruth there is no Englishman who cannot give you the quotation about herI can do it myselfAnd Ruth said Entreat me not to leave theeor to leave off from following after thee For where thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will lodgeThy people shall be my people and thy God my God Where thou diest will I die and there will I be buried The Lord do so to me and more also if aught but death part thee and me This the excellent Englishman before marriage regards as the whole duty of womanAfter his marriage his view changes somewhatHe rather objects to her entreating him not to leave herHe goes to his club where the hall porter has the strictest possible injunction to let nothing in petticoats enterBut the woman having been carefully taught by the man has a general idea that the only person who ought to stop her is the keeper of the gates of a suburban cemeteryThis causes a good many misunderstandings in the course of many livesFor the woman as a rule does not understand that when she was told to behave like Ruth the gentleman did not really mean itRoughly speakingin Germany the woman is better drilled than in EnglandIt is not so long since I saw a dinner party of German professorsThe gentlemen were all eating an enormous and excellent repastThe wives sat round the walls of the dining room knittingThey knew they were the inferior animalsThey had been carefully taught even before marriage that they were not RuthBesides Ruth said nothing about dinnersPerhaps she did not expect to eat with BoazIn France where they manage these things better they do not read the BibleThat makes them inferior Christians inferior creatures altogetherBut whilst the French have not their eyes on the dizzy altitude where our gaze is permanently fixedthey have the leisure to evolve a fairly satisfactory arrangement as to the living together of the sexesIt is perfectly true that every Englishman and every German would tell you that every French husband is unfaithfulSo he probably isBut then every English and every German husband though he will not tell you so knows that he is much more unfaithful than any mere Frenchman could beIsn t that why we go to ParisYes surely and ginger shall be hot in the mouthThe real difference is that the Frenchwomannot having it perpetually dinned into her that she is Ruthdoes not expect much fidelity from her husband and what the eye does not see the heart does not grieve afterOn the other hand the French woman takes a great deal of care to have a controlling voice i n her husband s business affairsThere is no inferiority in her consciousnessShe knows that she is a better business man than her husbandBut if he is a good boy she lets him go out and play now and thenAnd the net result is that one does not hear in a French club the imbecilities about women that one will hear in an English or a German oneIn America where they have not begun to think about life but merely exhaust themselves in the uplifting search after the dollarthe men are entirely emasculatedThey never talk about women at all in their clubsPoor AmericaLike the young puppy it has all its troubles before itAs it at present stands the United States has reduced the English and the German system to lunacyFrance on the other hand has advanced that system to a reasonable modus vivendiThe most importantas it is the most singularof contributions to modern literature on the sex question is an extraordinary work called in EnglishSex and Character This book is noteworthy because it had an immense international vogueIt was towards the middle of06 that one began to hear in the men s clubs of England and in the cafés of France and Germany one began to hear singular mutterings amongst menEven in the United States where men never talk about womencertain whispers might be heardThe idea was that a new gospel had appearedI remember sitting with a table full of overbearing intellectuals in that yearand they at once began to talk about WeiningerIt gave me a singular feeling because they all talked under their breathsI should like to be precise as to the strong impression I then receivedbecause if I could convey that impression exactly I should give a precise idea of what is the attitude of really advanced men towards woman kindTo begin with my companionsThere may have been ten of them and every one of them except myself had a name of some distinction in the world of advanced ideas in EnglandIt was indeed a gathering with a formal nameLet us say that it was called the Pincushionthough the real name was of course much more seriousI once perpetrated an epigram the only epigram of my whole lifeGod knows how a person so frivolous as myself ever came to be made a member of the Pincushion ClubBut a member I once certainly wasAnd I was askedby a young person in a voice of awewhat was this mysterious and authoritative assemblyI answered and this was the one epigram of my lifeWhat the Pincushion Club says to night the Daily News will say to morrow For the benefit of those few of my readers who are not also students of that instructive journal I should point out that this means that the members of the Pincushion Club wereto a manseriousimprovingethicaladvancedcareless about dress and without exception Young LiberalsThe date of which I am speaking fell in 1906 and it will be remembered that it was just about that time that Miss Pankhurst interrupted the late Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman at the Albert HallI had more or less sincerely but how very stupid it was of meimagined that these Young Liberals would sympathise with the attempts of woman to attain a share in the government of the countryAnd so they did of coursefor were they not to a man Young LiberalsBut the odd thing was that they were extraordinarily angry with Miss Pankhurst and her followersThey were anxious to point out to me that they were the most advanced body of men that could be found in the worldTheir sympathies with anything advanced could not possibly be doubtedTo suspect them on this point would be worse than suspecting the Pope of heresyIt would be too shockingBut when it came to Miss Pankhurst they exclaimed all together that she was really a bad girlThey said that it was such bad manners to interrupt a Liberal Prime Ministerfor ail Liberal Prime Ministers are by nature inclined to favour advanced ideasAnd all my friends showed themselves pained to the point of tears and I knew then that next day the Daily News would say that Miss Pankhurst was a very naughty girl indeedAnd then suddenly all their voices sank low togetherI really thought that for the first and last time someone of that circle was going to relate an indecent anecdoteBut that would have been impossibleNothey were talking about WeiningerAnd the odd thing was that every one of them had readSex and Character whereas I had never even heard the name of that young German doctor of medicineThat singular and whimsically nonsensical work had spread through the serious male society of England as if it had been an epidemicIf it had been the Influenza upon its first visit it could not more effectively have laid them lowThey knew all about the bookthey knew even all about the romantic young doctor who had laid this terrific egg at the age of twenty or soor who like an eel had died of the effortTheir tones were extraordinarily curiousThey contained a mixture of reliefof thanksgivingof chastened jubilationsof regret and of obscenityIt was as if they were some sort of inverted monks rejoicing because someone had proved that the Christian miracles were all falseor rather it was as if they were all high minded bankrupts to whom some new law giver of genius had proved that the paying of debts was unnecessarily scrupulousAnd that indeed is what they wereFor the young doctor who went mad and died at the age of twenty three had proved to them that women were inferior animalsHe had proved it to the satisfaction of all their intelligencesout of the mouth of this babe and suckling had come the wisdom for which they had cravedAnd they were all these Young Liberate unfeignedly thankfulThey were more thankful than any men that I have ever knownThe burden of years had fallen from their shouldersForfor years and years they had hadas Liberal minded mento live up to the idea that women should have justice done to themNow DrWeininger had come along and proved that women were inferior animalsHe had proved it by all the sciences that are open to a very very young German doctor of medicineHe had proved it by medicineby biologyby classical lawby theologywhich is the oldest of all sciences and bycharacterologywhich was a science so new that it had been invented by DrWeininger himselfAnd how thankful my Liberal friends wereOnce more they could look the world in the faceIn one particular at least they could find themselves in agreement with the bagmanthe music hall singers and all those unthinking and jovial people who make up the man in the streetYesthey were unfeingedly thankful for it meant that the Young Liberal Party need not any more be burdened with the woman questionThey were able then and there to throw women over and that was an immense gain for the PartyFor the Young Liberal Party is always being made fun of by bagmen and by music hall singersIn this respect they would at least be able to be at one with the ordinary male manIt made them very happyAs for me I was discouraged for I really imagined that Weininger had proved his caseBut immediately I resigned my membership of the Pincushion ClubI couldn t stand the Young Liberal any moreThey had given themselves away too thoroughlyI did not read Weininger for some time afterwards becausebeing naive and ingenuous I really believed my Young Liberal friends when they assured me thatSex and Characterwas a scientific workI was at that time a little tired of the Doctor posing as a prophet in these mattersWe all know the distinguished president of the British College of Physicians who assures us quite arbitrarily that woman has no frontal lobe of the brain this is quite untrueand that therefore she is unable to drive railway trainsThis also is quite untrueWe all knowtoothe distinguished president of the Scottish College of Surgeons who assures us that because woman lacks one rib that I believe is true therefore she cannot write epic poemsand we all know the several other distinguished medical gentlemen who assure us that because of matters which one cannot discuss in drawing rooms all women are necessarily dishonestNevertheless after a time I did read this new scientific workDrWeininger s book is a collection of arbitrary theories invented by DrWeininger himself and of second hand nonsense collected as it were from the music hallsWhat DrWeininger s own immense discovery amounts to isthat some men are more like women and some women are more like menThis enormous discovery had already been made by my grand aunt Bromley the lady who said that you can never trust a man when he is out of your sightIt was also made by ShakespeareEuripedesthe writers of the Bibleof the Egyptian Book of the DeadI should imagine that the only persons who were not acquainted with this world shaking discoverythe only recorded persons who never discovered it for themselves were Adam and EveBut DrWeiningercommencing his great work at the age of about fourteendid certainly elaborate the ideafor as he grew older he must have discovered that this proposition startled nobody when it was put boldly44 The Little Review I imagine the gifted boy approaching the scribes and elders of his day and attempting to expound the law to themSays he I have discovered that some men are more like women and some women are more like men A profound silence greets his remarkThe gifted boy goes away to reflect on the cause of his failureHe discovers that what is wanted is that his discovery should be wrapt up in scientific terminologyAnd after several years he sets down the proposition thusSometimes M Mn Wx and W Wx Mn This means exactly the same as the original proposition but it looks more formidableWith this as a basis DrWeininger launches out upon a yet more adventurous discoveryHe discovers that for a happy marriage it is best for a manly man not to marry a manly woman because each will want to be head of the houseand that it is better for a womanly man not to marry a womanly woman because then the house will have no head at all and will therefore not be well conductedThis discovery was also made by my grand aunt Bromley and no doubt our first parents were able to observe it working in the households of Cain and AbelAnd DrWeiningerno doubt finding that his discovery lacked mysteriousnessproceeds once more to express it thus M7 W1XW7 M1 M7 W1 YW1 M7 M1 W7 YW7 M1X being satisfactory and Y unsatisfactory unionThis it will be admitted is a very impressive way of stating an extraordinarily worn out platitude and without doubt DrWeininger deserves all the success that he obtainedHe proceeds to state that this Algebraic theory will be found to be true in the cases of the The Little Review 45 marriage of animals and of plantsBut he does not support this dogma with any scientific examplesWhy should heAnd this is positively all the hard scientific fact that his great volume containsthe rest is sheer arbitrary statementsThis is how it is doneDrWeininger proceeds to question What is genius He answers Genius is memory And he devotes an immense long chapter to proving that HomerShakespeareGoetheSchillerFreiligrathBismarck and Richard Wagner all had wonderful memoriesHe supports the theory with quotations from the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellinithe confessions of Jean Jacques RousseauNovalisCicero and Heinrich HeineAll this part of a chapter on genius he documents in the most weighty and the most teutonic mannerNo reader could possibly doubt that here is a truly scientific workTowards the end of the chapter DrWeiningerthumping his pulpit shouts Thus I have proved that genius is memory Then as it were in a low voice he saysNo woman ever had a good memorytherefore no woman was ever a genius And in that moment he jumps down from the pulpit before anyone has time to make objectionsOr again he asks What is greatness and he answersTo be great is to have a strong sense of one s own individuality He proceeds to cite the cases of Alexander the GreatJulius CaesarCharlemagnePrince EugeneFrederick the GreatMarshall BluecherNapoleonthe first Count Moltke and William I of GermanyAll these people he says had a strong sense of their individual importanceHe proceeds to document his theory with quotations from Jean PaulNovalisSchellingKant and NietzscheHe mentions ShelleyLucretius and Hume with disapprovalHe approves of ArchimedesJohannes MüllerKarl Ernst von BaerConrad SprengelFriedrich August WolffFranz BoppLeibnitzNewton and ThucydidesHe quotes EmpedoclesPlotinius and GoetheOnce more there is the splendid German scientific mannerOnce more he thumps his pulpitshouts To be great is to have a sense of one s own individual importance Once more he slips out the sentence No woman has ever had a sense of her own individual importanceTherefore no woman was ever great And once more he vanishes discreetly from viewFor these allegations against women DrWeininger adduces no authorityHe does not quote Novalis or Amiel or Schelling or Jean Paul Richter or even the most obscure of German philosophersHe just boldly makes a statementIn this wayAnd even women with the best and least limited memories never free themselves from this kind of association by feelingsFor instance if theyfeel remindedby a word of some definite colouror by a human being of some definite thing to eat forms of association common with women they rest content with the subjective associationand do not try to find out the source of the comparisonand if there is any relation in it to actual factThe complacency of self satisfaction of women corresponds with what has been called their intellectual unscrupulousnessand will be referred to again in connection with their want of the power to form concepts The aim of this passage is to prove that women have no memoriesOr againsays DrWeininger The consciousness of identity of the male even although he may fail to understand his own pastmanifests itself in the very desire to understand that pastWomenif they look back on their earlier lives never understand themselves and do not even wish to understand themselvesand this reveals itslf in the scanty interest they give to the attempts of man to understand themThe woman does not interest herself about herself Or yet again There is nothing more upsetting to a man than to findwhen he has discovered a woman in a lieand he asks her Why did you lie about it that she simply does not understand the questionbut simply looks at him and laughingly tries to soothe himor bursts into tears Or once more Truth must first be regarded as the real value of logic and ethics before it is correct to speak of deviations from truth for special motives as lies from the moral point of viewThose who have not this high conception should be adjudged as guilty rather of vagueness and exaggeration than of lyingthey are not immoralbut non moralAnd in this sense the woman is nonmoral This last passage shows DrWeininger at his astutestWith an admirable cunning he wraps up a truism in scientific language that The Little Review 47 that may awe the simple minded and comfort the eruditeThis is at the opening of the paragraphAnd then when he has proved to his own satisfaction that he is learnedbalanced thoughtful and scientific he makes a statement from quite another department of knowledge and trusts that his former erudition may carry him overThis is DrWeininger s one technical trick and he uses it with such consummate skill that he certainly hoodwinked a large portion of the world of his dayHere for instance we may read how he affected his publishers In the two chaptersThe Nature of Woman and her Significance in the Universeand Woman and Mankindwe drink from a fountain of the ripest wisdomA tragic and most unhappy mind reveals itself hereand no thoughtful man will lay down this book without deep emotion and admirationmanyindeedwill close it with almost religious reverence It is almost incredible that any human being can have written in this way of any book written by human handsyet there the words stand in cold printAnd what does it all amount toIt is as if a first class cricketer should demand the religious attention of the public to his pronouncement upon literary style or as if a field marshal should demand to be listened to on the subject of the divorce lawIt amounts exactly to thatDrWeininger was something of a biologistsomething of a psychologistsomething of a metaphysicianHe had passed his time his short life in the reading of innumerable bookshe could turn out some really goodcompiled chapters on logicaestheticsmetaphysicsAnd his reading on these subjects was probably unrivalled by any German student of his dayHe was nothing more or less than a conscientious book worm and an absolutely unscrupulous theoristthese characteristics going so often hand in handHe lived in the little town of Jena where opportunities for observing life are as wide or as narrow as in any other little town of a handful of learned inhabitants and where the atmosphere is as conducive to the study of books as is anywhere possibleHe was an immensely hard workerhe had an enormous memoryhe had an extremely arrogant sense of his personal worth It will be observed that he says that the characteristics of genius are memory and an arrogant sense of one s personal worth Without doubt the poor fellow thought himself a genius and perhaps he wasThen this book worm came across a stupid girl just as Christina Rossetti came across a stupid young manThere was nothing on the face of Weininger to show that he Was a great man48 The Little Review He was rather uglyarrogant and rudeThe stupid girl ignored his distinguished qualitiesdeceived him and threw him overThe result of this experience it was the only real experience of this short lifeis to be found in the passage that I have quoted the one beginningThere is nothing more upsetting to a man than to findwhen he has discovered a woman in a lieAnd this passage is a real outpouring of the soul of poor WeiningerThe stupid young girl had gone to the theatre in Weimar with another and more attractive young manAfterwards she lied about it to the doctor and naturally he had never experienced anything more upsettingAt last she deserted him for the more dashing young studentThen Weiningeroutraged and driven mad by his solitary experienceretired into his study to revenge himself against the sexAnd when he had written his book he shot himself on the fourth of October1903As I have saidDrWeininger hardly documents his book at allthe list of actual women whom he mentions by name limiting itself to a score or soOf these the most prominent arefrom an English point of viewGeorge SandChristina Rossetti and George EliotOf George Sand he says in the familiar anti feminine tone that she ought to have been a manGeorge Eliot he says had a broad massive forehadher movements like her expression were quick and decided and lacked all womanly grace Christina Rossetti he likewise declares to have been masculine in her characterOf another connection of my ownAnnette von Droste Hulshorff he says upon one page that she was the most original poetess that Germany produced and thather frame was wiry and unwomanly and her face masculineand recalling that of Dante This is when DrWeininger is anxious to prove that all women of distinction have had masculine attributesNowI am exceedingly acquainted with portraits and with anecdotes of this poetess who really did write some extremely charming verseIn her youth she was fresh colouredsoft in outline and smilingTowards the end of her life she certainly grew thin and rather hook nosed but in her general characteristicsand particularly in her long drawn out love affair with the poet Levin Schuckingshe was certainly as feminine as any one could desireBut it is not enough for DrWeininger to belabour Annette with attributes of masculinity upon page 67 when he is anxious to say that she is an original poetessOn a later page when he desires to prove that no woman ever wrote original poetry he says that Annette s work was unoriginaloutmoded and feminineIn this way does this distinguished writer have his aruguments both waysAnd similarly when he wishes to prove that distinguished womenbeing always masculine mindedmate themselves with effeminate menhe mentions Daniel Stern the mistress of Liszt and then says that Liszt s compositions were effeminateHe says thatMme de Staelwhose work on Germany is probably the greatest book by woman ever publishedis supposed to have been intimate with August Wilhelm Schlegelan effeminateBut he never mentions the catalogue of other lovers whom Mme de Boigne assigns to Mme de Stael lovers who were all sufficiently masculineAnd he does not even spell Mme de Stael s name correctlyIt is in this way that DrWeininger s large book is built up by leaving out documentation as far as possible when he is upon the question of womanby falsifying his documentation or by misreading other documents when documentation is forced upon himAnd as a matter of fact he approaches women very sparingly at all in this workAbout ten per cent of it is devoted to proving the littleness of the inferior sexabout ninety per cent is devoted to those passages in which he analyses the nature of the greatness of manAnd this ninety per cent is documented carefully enoughWriting on questions of sex characteristic is vastly more difficult than writing upon international differencesand there are few men so bold that they would write upon the characteristics of China without having visited that empire or ever having known with some intimacy a ChinamanMost men will tell you that the nature of women is vastly more incomprehensible to them than is the empire of the MongolsYet there is hardly any manbe his acquaintance with women ever so little or his experience of them ever so limitedthat would not willingly sit down to write you a great long book about what he will call the fair sexSo it was with DrWeininger who shot himself in 1903 because a silly girl went from the town of Jena to the theatre of Weimar with a fellow studentThat some experience of a foreign country would have been necessary to him before he wrote about that foreign countryhe would have been ready to agreeYet though the heart of another is a dark foresthe was ready to set out writing on the mysteries that are to be found in innumerable darknesses without having touched more than one tree in all the forests of this worldFor it is literally the fact that the one trace of experience in all this long book is the poor young man s expression of astonishment when he found that a woman could lie to himHe regarded himself as The Little Review God AlmightythatI supposeis why his publisher recommends us to lay down his book with almost religious reverenceI am aware that it may seem almost foolish to break so gravely upon a wheel so frail a butterflyand indeed I have only set about the task because this work represents for so many men of the present day a fifth gospelBefore the day of Weininger their testament was a work calledParerga und Paralipomena and a chapter of that work calledUeber die Weiber But this celebrated chapter beginning with the world renowned words Dass man das kurzbeinigebreithupige uswGeschlecht das schoene nennen sollt this celebrated chapter is not meant even by its author to be taken very seriouslyfor the sub title of this collection is given aslittle philosophic sketchesand it is bound up with such half humorous philippics as the exceedingly funny essay calledUeber Larm und Geraeusch Schopenhauer knew quite well that he was exaggeratingthat he was exaggerating even humorouslyHe documents his tremendous essay with the most solemn and portentous notesHe puts into it the fruits of as much reading as the ordinary scholar would give to his work of a whole life timeBut the whole effect is slightly whimsicalis slightly nonsensicalIt produces the impression of a good Tory filled with port wine and at peace with the universedeclaring loudly that all Liberals are a set of swine whose sole preoccupation is that of handing over the British Empire to the GermansHe knows that it isn t true but he goes on adducing fact after fact in a fine nonsensical furySchopenhauer s experience of women was twice as broad as Weininger sbut it was only half as deepHe knew two of these mysterious creatureshis mother who worried him to madness with her silly tongue and his housekeeper whom eventually he threw downstairsShe broke her leg and he was under the necessity of paying her a pension for the rest of her life and quite naturally this annoyed himThe rest of the knowledge of life that this learned philosopher had he acquired at the public dining table of a restaurant in FrankfurtHere he was accustomed to sit every day during lunch timeBeside him on the table cloth he would lay a ten Taler piece in goldAnd this piece of money he declared that he would give to the poor as soon as he heard one of the many officers who sat at table with himtalk of anything more sensible than racing or womenHe was never called on for the ten TalersSo that perhaps Schopenhauer heard something about the fair sex after allBut he was a very great philosopher and quite the ugliest man of his dayHis mother Johanna Schopenhauer was the most popular novelist of her day and Arthur was entirely dependent on herThis alone would have been sufficient to have irritated any philosopher for she was a tiresome woman and he was a tiresome manBefore Schopenhauer there was no writer who systematically and scientifically attacked the other half of the human creation to be continuedBERTHA Arthur Symons NOdear Madameit has never greatly interested me to be taken for a poetAnd that is one reason why I have for the most part shunned poetical personsyou are the exceptionof coursebut then you are beautifuland I forgive you for being thatAnd yet I too have been taken for a poetShall I tell you about itbefore I tell you about Berthawho did not know what a poet wasIt was one midnightin Londonat the corner of a somewhat sordid streetI was standing at the edge of the pavementlooking across at the upper windows of a house oppositeThat does not strike youdear Muse of imaginary cypressesas a poetical attitudePerhaps notand indeed I was thinking little enough of poetry at the timeI was thinking only of someone who had quitted me in angerfive minutes beforeand whose shadow I seemed to see on the blindin that lighted upper room of the house oppositeI stood quite motionless on the pavementand I gazed so intently at the blindthatas if in response to the urgency of my willthe blind was drawn asideand she looked outShe saw medrew backand seemed to speak to someone insidethen returned to the windowand pulling down the blind behind herleant motionless against the glasswatching me intentlyIn this manner we gazed at one another for some minutesneitherat the timerealizing that each could be seen so distinctly by the otherAs I stood thereunable to moveyet in mortal shame of the futile folly of such an attitudeI realized that my appearance was being discussed by some loungers not many yards distantAnd the lastdecisiveuncontroverted conjecture was this He s a poet That point settled52 The Little Review one of them left the groupand came up to meHe was a prizefighterquite an amiable personI welcomed himfor he talked to meand so gave me an excuse for lingeringhe was kind enough to borrow a shilling of mebefore we partedand the action or slipping the coin into his hand gave me the further excuse of turning rapidly awaywithout a last look at the motionless figure watching me from the lighted windowAhthat was a long time agoMadamebut you see I remember it quite distinctlynotperhapsbecause it was the occasion when I was taken for a poetDo you mind if I talk now about BerthaI met Bertha much more recentlybut I am not sure that I remember her quite so wellThis was at BrusselsIt was in the time of the Kermesse whenas you knowthe good Flemish people are somewhat more boisterously jolly than usualwhen the band plays in the middle of the market placeand the people walk round and round the band standlooking up at the Archangel Michael on the spire of the Hotel de Villeto see him turn first pink and then greenas the Bengal lights smoke about his feetwhen
