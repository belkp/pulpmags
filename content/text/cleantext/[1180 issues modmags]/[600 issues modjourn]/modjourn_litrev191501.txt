than our planetdetached from itI think Verhaeren has been best lovedand perhaps best understood in Russia a land where realities are looked upon as symbolselse life would become a horrible absurdityThere he is endeared as the lyricist of the modern soul rent with eternal contradictions in the great task of transvaluation of values a mystic with no Goda prophet with no blessinga positivist without faith in mana socialist without a political programan anarchist withoutaction an urbanite longing for his villagea villager craving for the cityVerhaeren destroys rather than

without methodAnd the more profoundthe more palpitating and irresistible is the chaos of his titantic images heaped in massesthe more sincere are his wailsthe more burning his tearsI think it was the admirable French criticRené Ghilwho observed that to Verhaeren the world appears as if in a flash of lightningin an enormousexaggerated formand as such he embodies it in his work also exaggeratedalso enormous that his poetry resembles the genius of Rodin hewing his Balzac out of marble and powerful dreamsHow differently is Verhaeren conceived in the Teutonic mind The Austrian poetStefan Zweig has written an interesting book on the Belgianan elaborate study of his personality and workswhich substantiates my claim that people speak much more successfully about themselves than about othersHerr Zweig appreciates Verhaeren highlyand let me tell yon sub rosamy friendthat his general estimation of the Poet is but a pale echoing of the brilliant Léon Bazalgette in his book Les célébrités d aujourd hui he considers him the greatest poet livinghe names him the European poet in the same sense as Whitman is the American poetSoonhowever EmileVerhaerenby Stefan Zweig Houghton Mifflin CompanyBoston The Little Review 13 he falls into the Teutonic fallacy of preciseness by all meansof violently accurate definitions which must suit the factselse desto schlimmer fur die FaktenHe wishes us to believe with him that Verhaeren is the poet of socialismof democracythat he has proclaimed his great Aye to contemporary lifewith its greedfactoriesand smokethat a poet who wantsto be necessary to our time must feel that everything in this time is necessaryand therefore beautiful Thus with the German skill in fencing with Hegelian dialectics the critic endeavors to persuade us that Verhaeren must needs love modern life in all its aspectsthat he is enraptured with all manilestations of contemporary spiritfrom the urbanmultitudeto that most hideous platitudethe Eiffel TowerMrZweig has utterly failed to see that Verhaeren does not feel the presentthe contemporarythat he lives spiritually in the past and in the futurewhile the fleeting present is for him but a symbolan alphabet of monstrous hieroglyphsthe mysteries of which he interprets propheticallyHas he not expressed his endless despair and maddening grief over the tragedy of the all absorbing monster cityHas the world not been to him a Golgotha an eternal illusion To MrZweig Verhaeren is a happysatisfied lover of all and everythingThe poet and the painterMaximilian Voloshinone of whose poems appeared in TH E LITTLE REVIEW relates his impression of the Belgian When you see him for the first time you notice before anything else a deep furrow cleaving his browresembling two wide spread wings of a flying birdThis furrow is himselfIn it is his sorrowhis flight I wonder whether MrZweig has observed the furrowor did he deliberately overlook it in order to save hisstructure Yesmy friendpeople seldom succeed in their attempt to interpret othersWouldrou classify biographies as literature of personalityPerhaps in the sense that they reveal the personality of the biographerbut then it depends upon the value of that personalityHere is an instanceThe brother of Parnell writes his Memoirs bringing forth a mass of details and anecdotes ofCharley slifeCharles Parnell has always been a fascinating personality to meLong ago I heard a lecturer speaking on the great Irishman before a European audience of revolutioniststhe listenersby no means Irish were enchanted with the figure of the unique leaderwith his powerful individuality and skillful strategyI have pondered many a time over his portrait revealing the mysterious face of a medieval sorcererand have looked forward to a work that would help me in gaining a clearer idea of theuncrowned King of Ireland His brother s memoirs gave me a wealth of information about their family pedigree and about each individual memberCharles Steward ParnellA Memoirby his brotherJohn Howard Parnell Henry Holt and CompanyNew Yorktheir number is considerable particularly about the writer s business undertakingsAbout Charles Parnell I have learned numerous external facts and figuresbut his intrinsic self is as little known to me now as beforeOf what value is such a book which succeeds merely in introducing to you MrJohn Howardan Irish gentleman of no particular interestIt is totally different when you are confronted with such a wonderful individuality as Romain Rolland Apparently it is a book of essays on BerliozWagnerSaint SaënsD IndyStraussDebussyand on some aspects of modern music in reality you come to know the rich personality of Rolland and the reactions of his sensitivegraceful soul on the musical productions of our best known composersI am delighted with his influence on my viewsnot that he has altered themmusical opinions do not let themselves be proved or disproved but he has enhanced my attitudeshe has made me admire my favorites more profoundly and hate my torturers more thoroughlyDo not let your Editor know that Brahms s symphonies prove as indigestible to Rolland as they have been to your humble IncurableIt is the reading of such a book that offers me the joy of looking into a great souland it reminds me of the exalted experience I have had in reading Wilde s Intentionsor the essays of Przybyszewsky and Arthur SymonsThe unceremonious self revealment of a great manof which I spoke in the beginningdoes not always appeal to my aesthetic senseAt times my feeling of delicacy is scalded

expression of that modern spirit which finds its most notable expression in other arts in the sculpture of Meunierthe polyphonic music of Straussthe philosophy of Bergsonand the American skyscraperIt is the application of dynamics to poetryIt stands midway between romanticismwhich is an escape into the pastand futurismwhich is a flight into the futureParoxysm is deep rooted in to dayMNicolas Beauduinits most noteworthy French exemplarhas many noteworthy disciples in France and Germanyand paroxysm is a well known force in every literature except that of Americawhere its unconscious expression in life has been most remarkableStudents will find its philosophy set forth and its current phases in literature duly chronicled in MBeauduin s quarterly reviewLa Vie des LettresIt is only possible here to offer a few very brief hints as to its literary aims and materials It aims to be a synthesis of modern industrial and mechanical effortIt repudiates the ivory towerIt handles the materials of modern life directlynot in symbolsIt responds to the roar of factories and trainsThe poet is to bean active lyric representing his ageThe poet s vision is the cinematograph of modern life with its continual mechanical transfigurationIt is not sentimentalTo art for art s sakeand art for truth s sakeit opposes art for life s sakeIt discards personal sensationit is not ashamed to becosmic The evolution of poetry is to be as rapid and terrible henceforth as material evolutionIt will sing the new manthe man machinethe multiplied manthe Man BirdIt exalts motion and repudiates equilibriumIt is socialIt feels the need for violent motives of faithand finds them in the passion of the citiesIt cultivates a scientific techniqueIt does not reject any words in forming a vocabularyIt seeks swifthurtlingdynamic rhythmsIt is based ondynamic notions of qualitative durationof heterogeneous continuityof multiple and mobile states of consciousness It perceives the elements of poetry contained in modern citieslocomotivesaeroplanesdreadnoughtsand submarinesin a stock exchangea Wall Streetor a wheat pit and in every scientific marvel and in the sonorous song of factories

Ralph Fletcher Seymour CompanyChicago HENRY BLACKMAN SELLA flower is beautiful we say but whyBecause in its geometry and its sensuous qualities it is an embodiment and significant expression of that precious something in ourselves which we instinctively know to be Life an eye looking out upon us from the great inner sea of beauty a proof of the eternal harmony in the nature of a universe which is too vast and intimate and real for the mere intellect to grasp Yet our materialists would solve the Problem with their material intellectsAnd our theologians would solve it with their ecclesiastical deductionsThe one would put Life in the cold hands of the scientistexpert in fact and figurethe othergropingly indefinitein the hands 18 The Little Review of the spiritual formulalistYet both are wrongThe Problem can be solvedThe literalobjective guesses of the materialist are but flimsy realisms far from trueThe indefiniteabstract dreams of the theologian are but the futile inaptitudes of man calculated to define that which cannot be definedBut definitions are not what the world needsThe Solution would be interestingbut the Problem is fascinatingIt is the Going and not the Goal that holds us to the bitter and the sweetthrough morningsnoonsand nightsyear by yearIfthenwe grant the Solution but a cold conclusionand the Goal but a stagnation pointto whom can we turn but to the artists those spiritual children of that great master who wept when he could find no imperfection in his masterpieceThe artistwhose interests are in the interpretationsand not in the translations of Lifeand whose interpretations have given Life all that it holds sacredThere is no power but has its root in hisThere is no power But his can withold the crown or give it Or make it reverent in the eyes of menWritten philosophies of artist craftsmen are rareTheir busy lives find little time for penning rules but when one does speakit is with the captivating force of original thought the summary of attainments through many trials and many failuresAnd it is with this sure touch of deep artistic experience that Frank Lloyd Wright draws from the geometric beauty of the mystic Japanese prints his philosophy of the artist as master of the Problem Real civilization means for us a right conventionalizing of our original state of naturejust such a conventionalizing as the true artist imposes on matural formsThe law giver and reformer of social customs must havehoweverthe artist soulthe artist eye in directing this processif the light of the race is not to go outSoart is not alone the expressionbut in turn the great conservator and transmitter of the finer sensibilities of a peopleMore stillit is to show those who shall understand just where and how we shall bring coercion to bear upon the material of human conductSo the indigenous art of a people is their only prophecy and their school of anointed prophets and kingsOur own art is the only light by which this conventionalizing process we callcivilizationmay eventually make its institutions harmonious with the fairest conditions of our individual and social life I wish I might use another word thanconventionalizingto convey the notion of this magic process of the artist mindwhich is the The Little Review 19 constant haunting reference of this paperbecause it is the perpetualinsistent suggestion of this particular art we have discussedOnly an artistor one with genuine artistic trainingis likelyI fearto realize precisely what the word as here used connotesLet me illustrate once moreTo know a thingwhat we can really call knowing a man must first love the thing and sympathize vividly with itEgypt thus knew the lotusand translated the flower to the dignified stone forms of her architectureThus was the lotus conventionalizedGreece knew and idealized the acanthus in stone translationsThus was the acanthus conventionalizedIf Egypt or Greece had plucked the flowers as they grewand given us a mere imitation of them in stonethe stone forms would have died with the originalIn translatinghoweverits very life s principle into terms of stone well adapted to grace a column capitalthe Egyptian artist made it

spake ZarathustraIn times most ancient at culture s dawn of day the individual was swallowed up and lost in the life of the tribeHe did not count as an individualbut was valued only as a member of the group to which he happened to belongSubsequentlyman s endowment to personality entered upon its unfolding the first syllables of the long human story were stammeredMan began to become a selfTo be a self was to specialize into a difference from all other menFrom that moment onthe entire course of evolution may be considered as a progressive differentiation and specialization of the human personalityAt the outset there were only a few splendidly and highly endowed natures that felt a distinct life of their own welling up in themselves from mysterious springs of beingThey took up the gauge of battle against othersagainst the mass which attempted to subject and assimilate them to its peculiarityMass meant monotonyBut the differentiating energy and impetus encroached further and furtherpassing from the great to the smallpushing into the mass whose members no longer wanted to be massherdbut menThe might of spiritual personality opposed itself to the superiority of corporeal peculiarityPsychical feeling more and more became personalCharacter increasingly received a distinctive stampAlong with thisthe impulse to self dependence began to stir even in those men who were outclassed in physical strength by their stronger human brothersLaterwhen the head and heartand no longer the fistformed the strength of manwoman pressed into the circle of life s evolutionShe was no longer a mere exemplar of the geniusShetoowould be personalityThis course of events signified an infinite refinement and enrichment of cultural life on the one side on the otherit gave rise to the question as to howin this differentiation of men into even more decidedly pronounced personalitiesa cohesiveness could be originated among them that would save life from disintegration and consequent decayAt bottomthe individual is not sufficient unto himselfSelf dependenthe would be miserably impoverished and stunted of this there can be no doubtaccording to the most elementary laws of lifeHencealong with the formation of human personalitythere is a refinement of those forces of life which seem summoned to secure a bond of fellowship among men lawcustoma benevolent disposition toward othersthe feeling of sympathy for othersEven Nietzschewho forsees a future in which all these older group forces and moral impulses shall be obliteratedand every man pander to his own self alone and his own peculiarity in willing and feelingin thinking and speaking even Nietzsche cannot help preaching a new love that shall bind men togetherEven Zarathustra confessesI love men My willmy ardent will to creationimpels me constantly to men as the hammer to the stone To be surethis Zarathustra love is to grow out beyond and above what we call love to daywhat we call Christian loveThere is to be a Beyond ChristiantityThe new love will be as high above the old love as Above Man will be above manBeyond man means Beyond loveHow earnestly and ominously does this preaching of a new love pierce like a sword into the heart of our time A new test of the worth or unworth of our moral view of life Were we even convinced that the best and purest features of the old Christian love would re appear in any new lovestill the question would not be elucidated the question whether this old love would thereby become new againwould become living againsave through a storm of thunder and lightning that should purify the heavystuffy atmosphere which has gathered about the word love itselfYou will know them by their fruits of nothing is this so true as of loveWhere there is poweran effect must ensueand in the effectnot only the right of the powerbut the kind as wellmanifests itselfNowlove wills to promote the life of another with its own lifeLove wills to do good to its objectto redress some wrongsupply some lackhelp some needremedy some defectand the likeThereforethe fruits of love are gifts hencedie schenkende Tugendthe bestowing or the giving virtueof Nietzsche s phraseAccordinglyonly a possessor can giveWho possesses most the rich give most Who needs gifts is poorand since poverty is greatbecoming ever greatergifts are needed to meet the needsThushuman love has become the practice of beneficencethe work of the rich by which they help the poorThe greatness of benefactionsthis becomes a criterion for the greatness of loveWe have but to think of thefoundationsandbenevolent fundsandcharitable institutionsandunionsfor the care and keeping of the pooras well as of the incalculable sums which are given in private for the relief of wantin order to be impressed with thefruitswhich have grown on the tree of human loveHow magnificenthow imposing thesefruitsareHow much love there is in the world todayin this world in which so much good is doneWho could doubt itWho could deny itWhoWho but Friedrich NietzscheThe loathsome vanity and the refined hypocrisy with which this beneficence is prosecutedsuch obvious strictures as theseNietzsche passes over without a wordThis genusbenefactorthat does what it does just to benefit itselfis so lowdown to the Zarathustra poet that he will not honor it with a noticeHe simply classed it with the gilded and counterfeit rabblePöbelwith the culprits of wealthwho pick their profits from sweepingsThen there is the criterion of the numerical worth of the giftnot the ratio of the gift to the possessions of the giverthis criterion for the evaluation of love was so externalso deceptiveto Nietzschethat he left ittooout of accountWhat impelled Nietzsche to his depreciation of this whole species of beneficence was something differentsomething deeperAll these giftsgreat and numerical as they may beare almsand who has only alms to give to man is a poor manand Zarathustra feels welllisten to what he says to the saint Zarathustra answeredI love menWhy said the saint did I go to the forest and desertWas it not because I loved men greatly over muchNow I love Godmen I love notMan is a thing far too imperfect for meLove of men would kill me Zarathustra answered What did I say of loveI am bringing gifts to menDo not give them anything said the saint Rather take something from them and bear their burdens along with them that will serve them best if it only serve thyself well And if thou art going to give them aughtgive them no more than an almsand let them beg even for thatNo said Zarathustra I do not give almsI am not poor enough for that I am not poor enough for thatPriceless wordsYou read these words and you think of truly kindhearted men who sighIf I were only rich so I could do good They envy the rich their possessionsnot for the sake of the pleasures and comforts which possessions permit their possessors to providebut in the wholly honest feeling of the blessings which they could scatter with their wealthThen comes Nietzscheand says to these kindhearted menYou are only poor noodlesif you have nothing better to bring the world and men than this blessing of wealthThen he points them to gifts the least of which outweighs a million donationsNowNietzsche had no contempt of wealth with which to insult his fellowmen s intelligenceNor was he a socialistic indicter of beneficenceNor was he even a rigorous critic of the doubtful dispositionso often manifest in such benevolent activitiesBut perhaps his plain words on the poverty of almsgiving seem so weighty precisely because he must be acquitted without further ado of speaking from contemptfrom the standpoint of Christianityor from the milieu of poor folkAnd yet it was this most soaring spirit of the nineteenth centurythis aristocrat from top to toecompared with whom even a Goethe seems like a plebeianit was precisely he who as from an aerie up among the eagles looked down with such abyssmal contempt upon the highest and noblest triumph of riches namelythe ability to bestow benefitsthat he detectedeven in this triumphonly testimony to the poverty of richesAlong with thisat all eventsNietzsche passed damnatory judgment upon a Kultur which estimates the distances among menthe measure of their greatness according to the distinctions of possessionand therefore derives the right of the influence which it accords the individual from the sums which he donates by way of almsThentoowhat has the man to do with his possession It is not his personality which has assigned him a place in life where a confluence of industrial goods crystallize around himWhat does it signify as to the worth of a man that he has cast his baited hook into the stream of life just where a big hungry fish swims by and bites And ifnowthis most contingent of all contingenciesthat a man should get richis considered by his generation as the peculiar deed of a herothe deed which he was in a position to compass in lifeif the mere fact that a man releasesin the shape of benefits and almsa part of this wealth which he could not spend upon himself if he would is a phenomenon around which the conversation of the day revolvesof which newspapers in special articles and telegraphic dispatches have so much to saythen this is a sign of the decay of our moral cultureand we cannot be thankful enough to the man who has jolted us out of such aberration of ideas and made us see with eyes no longer blinded by the glitter of gold Ayewealth a man does need who wants to giveWealth he needs for the sake of his giving loveBut he must create this wealth himselfHe must wrest wealth from all valuesHe must coerce all things to himself and into himselfAll these things must stream back from the well of living water within him as the gifts of his loveInsatiably does the soul seek after treasures and gems because her virtue is insatiable in her will to giveThis is the soul s thirst to be an offering and a giftand hence she thirsts to house all wealth in herselfVulgar souls give what they havenoble souls what they are this is the well known saying that mirrors the meaning of NietzscheLove s highest labor is to create something great out of its ownselfthat it may be able to give unceasingly out of its own fulness and yet never be exhausted No mountain is too steep and no valley too deep for lovebecause love herself must know heights and depths that she may give to others what she has seen and known thereDo we fear lest we succumb to a weaknessThen we must force the weakness underneath our feet because we need our strength to give strength to othersWould we say to virtue Thou art too hard for us take thy laurel and let us sinNowthe hardest is spur to our loveto steel our willsour courageso that courage may gush into the souls of others alsoWhat we have made out of our own selvesthisthis aloneis our wealththis is the gift by whose bestowal men can become richA thought of our own which we have acquireda light of our ownwhich we have kindled in our innermost beinga lofty enthusiasm for what is great an energetic aversion to all that is common and basethis is our true wealththe gift that enriches us while it is given to othersPoor indeed are the people who can give only alms rich indeed are those who give themselves to menwho proffer their most intimate gifts to menwho say to men s hidden hearts and hopesSilver and gold have I nonebut such as I haveI give unto thee Why are we so deeply involved in hard necessity that our life can not dispense with alms and therefore with the people who make a virtue out of this giving of alms Simply because we have so few such truly rich men who thirst to become offerings and gifts for man These men can we havecan we become ourselvesonly when duty and righteousnessand not benevolence and inclinationshall decide in an ordering and helpful wayas to the requirement of lifeBehind every benefit which is necessary there is concealed an unrighteousness of life which makes the benefit necessaryAll alms with which the world cannot dispense today is an accusation against our culturea confession of how poor we are in the midst of all our wealthIt will be the first great step towards a new culture when we first learn to measure the unworth of these benefits by the eternal worths which alone are worthy of manwhich man forms in himself as new fructifying deedsas the lightning of thought which detonates from his soulas living beauty to which he gives shape in his own beingThen if all duties which are based on right and lawshall cease to be considered as something specialsomething greatif their fulfilment shall be no longer marveled at as a feat of virtuebecause these duties shall have become self evident and naturalthen shall man be illumined by new and greater duties which shall make him a debtor to lifethen shall he call his wealth and the fulness of his being his debt which he can pay only in constant creation for manin ceaseless giving to manThereforenobler souls will it they will to have nothing gratisleast of all lifeWhoever is of the Pöbel wills to live gratisbut we others to whom life gave itself we ever meditate as to what we can best give in return andverilythat is a noble saying which sayswhat life promises usthat will we keep for life In simpler languageNot to merit a rewardheavenly or earthlywill we givewill we assemble in ourselves the highest giftsto lay them down as offerings upon the altars of menbut we will give to return thanks for all that we have undeservedly receivedBickering and calculating as to whether we have had our just dueshaggling over hopes which have not done what they promisedwe will have none of thisbut thanksthanksthat as men we have gained some material from the saddest lifecreated joys out of its painswealth and worth out of its weakness and lossThisthisin Nietzsche s immortal wordsis eine Umwertung der Wertea transvaluation of values in the moral lifefrom which a new moral culture can issueIn our labors we are ever shadowed by the stilllurking thought of returns and rewardswe calculateand calculate ever in our own favorthat somewhere life has left us in the lurchCould we but once reverse this matterIt is not life that is obligated and indebted to uswe are obligated and indebted to lifeIn the former way of counting we always come out with a deficitwith a poverty in the laterwith a balancewith a wealth we still have something for which we gave nothingdid nothingwith which we have done no good How would it do to put such thankfulness to the testWhen the heart is shaken with sorrow s power it is life s gift to feel such shakingin such shaking love can feel the storm ragingEven such gift you would not have gratisYou would make some return the bravery with which you settle for itYou come to know despondencya new deedand your thanks therefor is that you have been permitted to overcome a paralysis of your energyIfwith freer vision and with broader heartyour eye has become alert and keen for human folly and lamentationand these attack you as cowardice and disgust of lifethen you take this as a gift that you will not have gratisyou will give something as counter gift and thanks a more energetic willthat will go to the bottom of folly and griefwith the fineness of feeling which has been bestowed upon you you will dig deepersearch out more earnestly the genuine values of lifeso that your cowardice and your ennui at life may become a new strength and a new joy for lifeIf you feel your hands tiedif the world seems a prison at whose bars you lungebut whose rods you cannot breakif then a horrible feebleness befalls youand your best will confesses that you are too weakthen take thistooas a gift for

be richimmeasurably richnot for yourself indeedbut for othersthat you may communicate to themgive to them and yet never give outBe debtor of lifethat in your poverty you may make many richBe debtor of lovethat you may never be able to pay your great eternal debtConfessing and obligating yourself to such debtyour life gains that eternal worth which increases the more you spend of itwhich The Little Review receivesthe more you give of itPooryet having all thingspooryet making many rich also sprach Paulus NietzscheAfter this Zarathustra went back into the mountains and the solitude of his cane and withdrew from menwaiting like a sower who hath thrown out his seedBut his soul was filled with impatience and longing for those he lovedfor he had still many gifts for themFor this is the hardestto shut one s open hand because of loveIt is the business of the very few to be independent it is the privilege of the strongand whoever attempts iteven with the best regret but without being obliged to do soproves that he is probably not only strongbut also daring beyond measureHe enters into a labyrinthhe multiplies a thousand fold the dangers which life itself already brings with it not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his waybecomes isolatedand is torn piecemeal by some manatour of conscienceSupposing such a one comes to griefit is so far from the comprehension of men that they can neither feel it nor sympathize with itand he cannot any longer go back He cannot ever go back again to the sympathies of menNietzscheThe Little Review Editorials and Announcements MrsHavelock Ellis ELLIS S visit to Chicago has been a series of revelationsAt first she was a little disappointingin her lecture on James Hinton and his sex ethics particularly in the discussion which followed it MrsEllis did not loom as large as some of her moredestructivecontemporariesThe thing was beautifully doneof course a gorgeous bit of interpretative artfor MrsEllis chooses words with a poet s care and presents ideas with an economy that is invigorating and restful at the same timeBut in so far as the lecture reflected her own ideas it had some of the limitations to which the eugenist point of view is always open the failure to go quite the whole distanceCompared with the directness and honest thoroughness of the few pioneers who are advocating birth control like Margaret Sangerwhose little pamphlet on the subject will cost her ten years imprisonment if the authorities can get hold of her the ideas of MrsEllis came with a certain inadequacyBut later she cleared herself of the charge of cultism by her laughing remark to some one who discussed eugenics with her EugenicsA mere spoke in the wheeland a very dogmatic spoke at thatHeaven knows we don t want a race of averages One of her most delightful afternoons was given over to her Cornish storiesShe read one called The Idealistwhich ought to be studied by all those who draw their rigid distinctions betweennormalandabnormal As MrsEllis said This story is an attempt to show that those people we so piously consider the worst of us are sometimes the best of us And so this charming woman with her simplicityher humorher franknessher idealismand her fine boyishness is a personality one must not fail to knowShe returns to Chicago on February 4to lecture on sex and eugenics in Orchestra FlailThat lecture will be given exclusively to women and will include a discussion of sex abnormalitiesas well as a paper on the subject written especially for the occasion by her husbandwhich MrsEllis will readA Journal of Ideas NEW REPUBLIC is the first weekly in America which has dared to assert that ideas are interestingeven if they are newWe have had one kind of weekly whose main purpose is to pay dividends to its ownersDividends demand advertisingadvertising demands large circulationcirculation demands pleasing as many people as possiblepleasing many people has seemed to demand piffle and dishonestyWe have had another kind of weekly which confines itself to academic criticism and frankly gives up any attempt to speak to the nationThe New Republic is run neither for dividends nor for ancient prestigeIt proceeds on the assumption that we can find writers who are both honest enough and intelligent enough to speak things of a value not determined either by capital or by the mobIt hopes that their product may be so interesting that the people who want to read it will be sufficiently numerous to support the paperIt hopes vastly more that the ideas and opinions so enunciated will introduce a powerful and much needed element of disinterested intelligence into American public lifeThe way in which these hopes are put into print will have much to do with the success of the attemptBut it is hopeful that somebody with adequate resources and equipment is actually engaged in the attempt to relate honesty and intelligence with the democracyJohn Cowper Powys the WelshmanJohn Cowper Powyscomes to the Chicago Little Theatre for his lectures during January and February a great many people ought to fall under the spell of this man whose methods spoil one for almost all other lecturesMrPowys s intellect has that emotional character which is likely to be the quality of the man of genius rather than the man of talentHe might be called the arch appreciator he relies upon the inspiration of the momentand when violently enthusiastic or violently the reversehe is usually one of the twohe never stops with less than ten superbly chosen adjectives to express his emotion exactlyHis subjects will be DostoevskyWildeMiltonLambHardyHenry JamesDanteRabelaisHugoVerlaineGoetheand HeineThe dates may be had at the Little TheatreMrsHavelock Ellis sThe Love ofHERMAN SCHUCHERT sense of the general or the particular fitness of things is disturbed when an attempt is made to paraphrase or condense the spoken words of MrsEllisIt is seldom that this sense of fitness is at all troubledbecause it is a simple matter to extract from the average lecture enough coherent material for second hand purposesOn the subject given above MrsEllis compels continuous attentionIt is not enough to say that she steadily advances her ideas by means of careful phrasesfor every phrase seems to be an idea in itselfShe is an artistHer words are like so many focussed lightsnot one of which is superfluousAnd the illumination which she obtains is a grateful brightnessIn listening to her one s powers of receptivitywhile never strainedare not for one moment allowed to restAs she says It s all solid meat Hencethe feeling of futility in an attempt to present justly her observations and schemes of social bettermentWhat an absurdity might be suggested to the reader by the statement that MrsEllis advocates a form oftrial marriageor aprobation for engaged loversAnd yet her plan of such a pre ceremonial arrangement is as practical as it is badly neededpractical and entirely reasonablein that she has apparently overlooked nothingfrom the subleties of human nature to the future laws of the landAnd how faddish might she appear if one told of her attacks upon latter day Puritanismlust in the guise of loveprostitution within marriagethe evils of both repression and brutish or premature expressionthe abomination of smirking elders and cowardly guardiansand so forthTrulythese things constitute a fad of todaybut MrsHavelock Ellis was writing and preaching these ideas longer than twenty five years agoIn questions of lovemarriageand the possible beauty of human relationsshe is a splendidunhurrying pioneerIt would be impossible to measure the couragethe fine preseveranceit has taken to work on patiently and forcefully in the midst of leering societyinfallible misunderstandingand a great ocean of evil mindednessWhat daringto speak plainly of the beauty of love passionAnd how hopeless Hereevolution endlessly proves itself a laggard processUntil one hears MrsEllis it is easy to overestimate thebuildingpowers of Emma Goldmanalthough it is always too easy to consider only Miss Goldman s sturdywreckingcapacityBut the percentage of constructive element in MrsEllis s work is much more apparent than in Miss Goldman sClearlyeach woman is superlative in her own sphereBy virtue of its tested strengthMrsEllis s constructive machinery may be said to destroy naturally whatever gets in its wayAnd in addition to this she does some directincisive battling as wellHer humor has carbolic in itHer sarcasm is a spiritual antisepticIn the realm of the childMrsEllis agrees with that grand Swedish woman Ellen KeyThese two coincide upon the supreme importance of full and proper education for the coming generationincluding eugenicshygieneand kindred topicsIt is a joy to know of so much sanity abroad in the worldBut even todaywhen a number of more or less important waiters and speakers are taking up her ideaswhen Chicago is having the truths of humanity forced down its tonsilitic throatit was still possibleon a Sunday night in the Little Theatre for MrsEllis to have in her audience many whose deep sighs of boredom it was scarcely necessary to observe before tagging them as a lower class of mentalitywhile no doubt their jewels and furs were quite necessary to indicate their social standingWhat curious gropings of psychology brought these people to such a lectureOr was it fashionIn the faces of these might a dozen Saviours have found ample pity materialYawns and dull looks Something between a Cross and a Bomb was wanting to awaken these unthinking onesasleep while superb ideas ideas of admirable vitality and development were being put before them by the clear and earnest voice of a great womanWhat is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evilNietzsche36 The Little Review London Letter EDWARD SHANKS LondonDec11914to humiliate myself at the beginning of this letterNietzsche did not provoke the war he did not imagine there was ever any specificallyTeutoniccultureworthy of being spread at any costand he seems to have disliked Prussia as much or more than I doI say this not to inform the readers of THE LITTLE REVIEWwho know it all already from the number in which my error appearedbut to unburden my soulI sinned like a daily journalist and spoke from hearsayfor I confess I have never been able to read Nietzsche with sufficient attention to gain more than a vague notion of his ideasTwo persons set me right MrHarold Monrothe editor of Poetry and Dramawith some heat and indignationandmore gentlyMrAROragethe editor of The New Agewho was in old days one of the first to bring Nietzsche to EnglandIt would seem that his efforts were of little usefor my blunder was merely an incident in a

thatThe title poem is a lovely pieceMrMonro s very bestthe composition which settledor should have settledall our doubts concerning his geniusThe others display that sombre misery which is the characteristic note of his writingwhich is extremely uncomfortable andafter a little whileextremely impressiveI may seem to have devoted too much space to the publications of the Poetry BookshopBut I

something to impress the listeners have a place in a good play and the grandeur of the occasion was sensibly diminishedWhen we wentwe asked the box office attendant if we might go in at half priceon account of our uniformsand he answered indifferently thatwe might if we liked When we got inwe understoodThere were about two rows in the stalls and two more in the pitThe boxes were empty as far as I could seeI cannot understand the English publicWhat more do they want now than to see Nelson on the Victory and Wellington at WaterlooIs it a cause of offence to them that the play is by a great man38

CompanyNew York There is a certain generic mythoutcropping whenever the discovery of some mysterioushidden treasure is in questionwhich is that the discoverer may possess only so much of it as he can carry away on his own personWhenever I met this climax in my childish reading my greedy little soul rebelled because the hero might not have all that his eyes could see instead of the negligible bit that he could handle with his own musclesExperience has taught that under no circumstances can a man own more than he possesses within himselfthis is as true of material art forms as it is of culture and educationIt is almost tragic in its truth when we look about and see such a wealth of apparent happiness and love and then look into our own impoverished heartsWe may not covet either our neighbor s automobile or his wifebut frequently we do covetin spite of good intentionsthe happiness that he derives from that automobile and that wifeParticularly weak are we when we look down love s highway and see what we believe to be limitless and ideal joyThe little orbit in which we move seems sadly askewand it takes a book like Mary Austin s Love and the Soul Maker to make us understand that all the topsy turviness of the present is but the labor pain of a sanertruerhappier futureThe author combines science and sentiment in a new wayHer facts show that she has read widelyher conclusions show that she has thought deeply her sentiments show that she has felt at least potentially mostif not allof the joys and sorrows which the practice and malpractice of love produceAnd the one shining truth that she has discovered in all this hidden treasure of sex happiness is thatwe ve a right to as much love as we can work up into the stuff of a superior personality This truth is thrown out as independently of conventionsprejudicesreligious beliefs or practices as a searchlight is independent of the hinges that hold it in placeIt is the ultimate measure of what is good or what is bad in love it is the standard by which all sex problems must finally be adjustedShe goes on to say thattaking anything over what we can give back in some form or other to the social sum is my notion of sinningand an inspired notion of sinning it istooWe are all searching for the treasure of love happinessyet no one may justly The Little Review 45 take more than he can carry away in inspiration and the impulse of creating something within or without that will add to the sum total of human happinessBetween facts and sentiment MrsAustin leans to sentiment yet why notShe is not writing for the elect body of sex studentsbut for ordinary men and womenThose who have read little or nothing of sex psychology would find colduncompromising facts too difficult a dietOffering them such an argument would be like comforting a bumped child with the multiplication tableBy means of such a book as Love and the Soul Maker it may be possible for even the ossifying brains of dogmatists to catch a glimmer of light on our present sex problemswhile such dazzlingly and ruthlessly true books as Havelock Ellis writes may petrify several additional lobesAlthough not openly propagandicMrsAustin has a decided philosophy of life which she sets forth in a dozen different ways and whichwithout saying soshe hopes her reader will acceptShe insists thatthe proper end of loving is not personal but racial it is the Soul Maker s most precious commodity and that love pirates or love grafters commit their most venal sin by believing that love is its own excuseAs MrsAustin expresses it Love for love s sake is the shibboleth by which they blunt the unassailable fact that love was not invented for love s sake but for life s Hereof courseis a radical point of departure which will turn many readers away from her pages it mayhoweverinduce an equal number to read furtherThe flaws in our modern system of marriage are more closely seen and more cleverly pointed out than are the remedies offeredFor examplethe author shows that modern society asks of marriagethings it was never meant to payyet her remedy is vagueAnd againThe initial mistake about marriage is in regarding it as a conditiona statewhen it is primarily a relationand may exist in spite of very unfavorable conditions and quite apart from themDelightfullyindeed does she puncture the time worn fallacy of platonic friendships 1 doubt that there can be any informing intimacy between men and women unless there exists also the potentiality of passionate experience Yet many of her views are completely radical There never has been a time since man stood up and knew himself for man she writes that the major process of love has been reproductive and later she points out thatchief among the uses of passion is the raising of the percentage of values in those who entertain it She cuts off all the frills of conventionceremonytradition strips away all but the essential naked truth germ and declares Marriage is an agreement between any pair to practice mate love toward one anotherwith intention 46 The Little Review Marriagethus simplifiedwould notindeed could notbe the failure which modern society so widely accepts with resignation instead of combating with thoughtful dissatisfactionWe have become so racially hypnotized that we do not distinguish between associated factssuch as foodshelterreligious sanctionobedienceetc and the essential truth of mate love The primary obligation of lovers is to love she saysThis doneall will adjust itselfand yet lest any should draw the over quick conclusion that MrsAustin advocates free lovelet me also add that she says To love and to keep on lovingThis is the one way of making marriage do its work in the world As a remedy she begs women to open their eyes to the fact that marriage is not now the only career for themThat marriage does not fill the lives of those who enter it is evidenced by the divorce courtsTentatively MrsAustin suggests that instead of dissolving so many marriages it would be wiser to unload the excessive strain put upon themLet economics take hold of the problem of the motherwho for the sake of providing bread for herself and her children crucifies her own personalityignores her own right to happiness upon the racial conception of marriageVery frankly she explains what marriage should do for usFirst of all to satisfy the hunger of the body for its natural mate and finally it must satisfy the need of companionship on the intimate and personal side of life She hints thatit is immensely more important that a mating pair should relish kissing together than that they should both be Presbyterian She is hopeful concerning the final abolishing of prostitution if the present marriage customs are changedShe is emphatic in the need of young people being enlightened in regard to marital experiences and problemsbut her suggestions are indefinite and inconclusiveHowevermuch may be overlooked for her emphasis of the fact that sex is an active principal and that the best love life is that which makes the best use of love s activitiesShe admonishes us toplay fair alike in loving and unloving which means that love is not a light thing of a daybut must be great enough and strong enough to control itselfeven to sacrifice itself for the greatest racial good and never to sell itself from a motive of personal selfishnessor for the bliss of an hourThe highway that MrsAustin lays out for love is rough and stony in spotsand yet its goal of racial betterment through achievement as well as by means of offspring is not to be despisedMARY ADAMS STEARNSThe Little Review Dutch Bourgeoisie Small Soulsby Louis Couperus DoddMead and CompanyNew YorkRainrain It is always raining in Holland the skies are ever hidden behind muddy

boring figure among the asinine menagerie is that of the heroineConstancewhose sole virtue consists in the fact that she had committed adultery in her early lifeThe author has not brought in a single positive type of Holland s artistic or intellectual circles to counteract the general gloom of the picture he has evidently determined to hold his readers within the frame of a family epicto focus their attention on one particular aspect of life in the Haguethe shallowestthe palestAs this novel presents the translation of the first part of the author s tetralogywe must be patient and consider the book as a prelude to the developing dramaAlready we see at the end of this volume promising symptoms of a newreal lifeto be manifested in the growing boyAdrian bighealthysturdywho despises his

them alland celestial wisdom is shelved during the acquirement of so much worldly knowledgeHow can the astonishing charms of this book be describedIn the first placethere is poetry neither cadent nor decadent poetrybut the sort of prose that conveys the most finely imagined poetic thoughtAnd there is contrastSuch contrast From the calm conversation of angels to the braying of an ass is the easiest jump for StephensIt is a gentle slide from paragraphs of delicate dawn picturing to a peasant s narration of brawls and thievingor a description of the angels attired in Pat McCann s trousersAndgiven the latitude of half a dozen quotationsone might prove that this same Stephens was a deep gazing mysticNor would his extreme paganism be difficult to establishBut to avoid all the inevitable shruggings of literary shouldersif one really said these things about the manlet it be quickly stated that James Stephens is before all else an artista writer with a superlative sense of humor and a pleasantly incomprehensible imaginationWhile a deeper probing of his mysticism or paganismas suchwould perhaps bring about a sudden discounting of his humor and his poetic sensibilitiesit is necessary to remember that Stephens is Irishwith all the implied values of that temperamentThereforeit is well to consider the author of The Demi Gods to be this day s most unique literary lightThe combination

of an author from whom we had come to expect only the bestMiss Sidgwick could not write anything that did not have passages of keen insight and shrewd handling of our commonplace humanitybut here their value is hidden under an avalanche of wordswords wordsThe slight plot which of course is no fault deals The Little Review 49 with the whims of the daughter of a great London surgeonShe overcomes parental objection and enters a dressmaking establishmentbut we are given no particularly vital picture of this lifeThere are several young people whose love affairs become mutually mixedbut ultimately untangled all of which is done by means of conversationsjerkyexclamatoryunrestrainedThis method is true to life because such chatter is exactly the way modern people talkbut nevertheless our ears ache with itand we find ourselves longing for a paragraph of straightaway description or narrationwhich never comesThe frivolous and empty atmosphere is all well enough for a relishbut it is

Music Nature in Musicby Lawrence Gilman John Lane CompanyNew York Its thin divine kinkiness I felt it undulate my soulLavender waterpitted and heaved to hugeuneasy circlesThe readers of THE LITTLE REVIEW may remember these lines they were meant to interpret DebussyI challenge Llewellyn Jones toobjectto this gem and to question itssenseThe stanchest conservative will agree that of all arts music presents the widest liberty for subjective interpretationespecially for such an autonomous artist as a poet There is some music which should be described by poets rather than expose by inquisitive aestheticiansOf such is the magical music of Debussy This from Lawrence Gilman s latest bookMrGilman evidently considers himself a good member in both categoriesfor he follows up the quoted remark with unrestrained effusions of colorful descriptions of Landscape musicSea musicDeath musicIt is charming readingthough at times the unbridled Pegasus causes you dizziness not that you are encountered with daringly new views or dazzling ideas MrGilman is too much of an American for such extravaganceIt is the manner of his expositionthe ravishing richness of his stylethat endangers your mental equilibriumJudge for yourself50 The Little Review Debussywhen he wrote this delectable and adorable musicRondes de Printemps sent his spirit into the woods and fieldsthrough gardens and orchards and petal showered lanesand upon the moors and hillshe trod the brown soil of the earthbut he also looked long up into the green branches and the warmgusty sky of Mayand savored the fragrant windsIs it not enchantingBut when you are treated to such nectar on nearly every pageyou sigh for the elegantreserved Romain Rollandwho expresses his enthusiasm for Debussy in a cooleryet by no means less convincingwayAside from this purely external characteristic the book contains very interesting remarks on the treatment of natural elements and phenomea by various composersThe invention of new instrumentsthe development of the art of orchestrationand general new conceptions of our agehave drawn a sharp line of distinction between the old and the new interpretations of nature in musicWhile the old composersamong the old the author places not only Hayden and Beethovenbut also Wagner and Griegapproached Nature either as a subject to be faithfully renderedor as a provocator of direct emotional reactions in themselvesto the new composersDebussyd IndyLoefflerMacDowellNatureis a miraculous harpan instrument of unlimited range and inexhaustible responsivenessupon which the performer may improvise at his pleasure to quote the inimitable originalThe classification is rather hazardous the importance of Loeffler is greatly exaggeratedbut as a purely subjective view the work of MrGilman is interestingKA PasteurizedMan and SupermanThe Raftby Coningsby Dawson Henry Holt and CompanyYorkThe Raft is based on the same idea as Shaw s minus moral shocksmental exhilarationand the SupermanThe theory is served as strong drink in the oneas good boy s tea in the otherThe same idea receives such different treatment that the person who would pronounce Man and Superman acorrupt playmight speak of The Raftas a beautiful storyprovided a few courageous truths which it was necessary for the author to state in order to refutecould be forgivenIt is a harmless compromise between the belief that no literature has a right to exist that is not suitable for a girl in her teensand the conviction that men and women must face life as it isIn The Raftwe read this figurative suggestion of the theory We re girls adrift on a raft and we can t swimOver there s the land of marriage with the childrenthe homes and the husbands we ve no means of getting to itUnless some of the men see us and put out in boats to our rescuewe ll be swept into the hunger of mid oceanBut they re too busy to notice usAlways wantingwantingwanting the things that only men can giveDid men ever want to be married or was it always necessary to catch themIn Man and Superman we find a more liberal statementTo a womana man is only a means to the end of getting children and rearing themVitality in woman is a blind fury of creationWhat other work has she in life but to get a husbandIt is a woman s business to get married as soon as possibleand a man s to keep unmarried as long as he canYou think that you are the pursuerand she pursuedFoolit is you who are the pursuedthe destined preyDuring the last few years stories and plays exploiting this doctrine have been hurled thick and fast in the attempt to batter down so called romantic loveromantic though fortified not only by the fancies of the poets and novelists but also by the analyses of the scientists and the experiences of lifeAccording to these storieslove is nothing more or less than a passion for reproductiona desire for childrenThis idea is being emphasized by two very different types for two very different reasons one tries to make a Don Quixote of romantic love and hopes by ridicule to eliminate it as the great motive and to give some of the other passions a chance in literaturethe other considers everything even suggestive of sex unmoraland so searches for an excuse to justify the gratification of a natural cravingNeither satire nor platitudes can alter natureLovethey sayconsidered as intense personal affection is an idea purely fancifulromanticIf so to consider it is romanticscientists are romantic for such men as Lankester and Pycraft saythe view that the sequel of mate hunger is the dominant instinct has no foundation in factDesire for the sake of the pleasure of its gratificationnot its consequencesis the only hold on life which any race possessesLove is the attribute upon which this preservation of the race depends In other words it is a case of cause and effectThat the joy of motherhood is greater than any other joy in a woman s life has absolutely nothing to do with the question as to whether or not the hope of that joy was the reason for the selection of a mateThe question is not one of superiority but priority not which is the greaterbut which came first which is the cause and which the effectIf the desire for 52 The Little Review children is the cause of what we call lovethe only logical outcome is that in selection any woman could not refuse any man fit to be the father of her children on the ground that he did not appeal to her personallyLife does not support such a conclusionWhy woman s choice is not impersonal is only one of the many things that cannot be explained by the theory that makes her desire for children the sole cause of attractionIt does not explain too many things faithless wivessome childless marriageschildren found on door stepsabortionssome prostitutionwhy some women never marry for fear of childrenor why man is not the coyreluctantelusive creature definedthough not picturedby Dawson and ShawNo wonder it fails to explain for childreninstead of being the whole cause are the result of only a part of the causemate hunger a hunger of bodymindand spiritLove is the feeling for the one that seems to supply those needsthe impulse toward that oneThe sooner we realize that the attraction between men and women is not all physical any more than it is all mental and spiritualand that sex is in all three phasesthe sooner shall we reach the truththe sooner shall we hear the last of one type that prudishly denies physical attraction or else tries topurifyit by making it a means to an endand of the other type that sees in marriage only physical unionThe theory will not stand either a logical or an emotional testNot only can it not explain this confusion of cause and effectthis mistaking the part of love for its whole but it also cannot answer why it should look to the future for a cause when love is so vitally a thing of the presentnor why it was ever thought necessary to find any explanation outside of itself for the attraction between men and womenIf there is any passion in the world that does not need a justification other than its mere existenceit is loveFor though realizing the exaltation of moral passionthe exhilaration of mental passionno one can deny that it is through love we know intensevivid personal happinesshappiness that is vibrantfull of colorrapturousBut it is absurd to try to analyze itit is even more so to argue about it but really women have grown very tired of having men tell them why they marrytired of this confusion of result with causeof a part with the wholetired of the belittling of love by people who have never experienced ittired of this sex obsessionIt is doubly absurd to waste time in arguing when the best argument I can offer against the Raft theory is the book itselfwhere the author spends most of his time disproving his own definitely stated idea through the actions of his charactersIt is interesting to see that both Dawson and Shaw shouldby methods diammetrically oppositeshow how fallacious is their statement by exactly the same circumstancethat isby having the woman care passionately for the mannot a manThat fact alone routs the whole theoryCertainly Cherry and Jehane have very decided personal preferences regardless of the next generation moreover the Golden Woman andheaps of other well bred womenwill not marry for fear of children and PeterOckeyand the Faun Man insist on being ardent lovers that vainly pursueNotwithstanding these contradictions throughout the bookthe author keeps on bravely and inartistically reiterating his Raft motivesas if to keep up his couragePossibly because he realizes that he is losing his themehe starts another which is really the one consistently developedThis second theme is that love is never reciprocal that at the best it is a case of one lovingthe other allowingthat usually it is a case of one loving and the other not even allowingHe starts an endless chain of unrequited affectionGlory loves PeterPeter loves Cherry Cherrythe Faun Man the Faun the Golden Woman the Golden Womanherself or is it PeterThat is one chainand another is Ockey loves JehaneJehaneBarrington BarringtonNanThese two themes working at cross purposes are typical of the book which is a mass of contradictions of this author s own definitely expressed ideasand of lifeSo many things do not ring true the laboredmorbidcommonplace treatment of Peter the maginative child as an exponent of the artistic temperamentthe lack of love as the sole cause of Ockey s failurewhen he needs so many other things to make a man of him the marriage of Nan and Barrington as the ideal unionwhen neither one has a nature intense enough to feel a great lovewhen even such love as they know has never been put to the merciless tests that life uses the broodingyear in and year outof the unmarried women over the loss of the joys of motherhoodand their lack of interest in any other phase of lifeJehane s unworthinessemphasized by the author in person and through his characterswhen her actions with different treatment might have made her almost a heroine the declared finality of so many things that are really only initial stepsplatitudes as answers to the vital questions of lifeMost of these false notes come from the fact that the theories of the author and the actions of his characters are not in harmonyWhenever I hear writers talking of such discords and saying that they are obliged to let their characters work out their own salvationsI always consider the attitude an affectationBut I have changed my mindDawson seems to be left alone on his Raftshouting his untenable theories till he is hoarsewhile his charactersignoring himhave reached land and are living their own livesI found myself in the absurd position of resenting the author s interference with those vivid54 The Little Review distinctivepowerful characters he had createdof wanting to tell him to keep his hands offand let them tell their own storyAnd left to themselves they tell it unflinchinglyWhat if the treatment is obvious and conventionalIt is obvious treatment of the great mysteries of

but still we fail to see the object of this book in holding up all architectural ideals asfallacies Father Ralphby Gerald O Donovan Mitchell KennerleyNew York Ralph O Brien was born to be a priestOne might almost sayconsidering his mother s attitudethat he was a priest before he was bornand his bringing up was single eyed to that endOnly as he grows older does he begin to find flaws in the supposedly flawless church of GodThen as he brings his keen young mind to these problems he fights against the religious decadence of Irelandand causes the author s pen to rush along through a torrent of socialistic and revolutionary indignationBalshazzar CourtorVillage Life in New York Cityby Simon Strumsky Henry Holt and CompanyNew York These eight connected essays concern the modern apartment house filled with strange families which become linked together by the telegraphy of domestics the streetBroadwayteeming with its interest in unnatural thingswith the show which one knows perfectly

Daughterby Josephine Daskam Bacon DAppleton and CompanyNew York To Day s Daughter is an utterly American book dealing with our peculiar present day problemsMrsBacon forces no conclusions upon the readerfor each case isdifferent The author limits her modern woman in no way except to make her choose one purpose and to show her that she cannot be a dozen different women and achieve success in all directionsShe proves that woman must have a cohering linea central motive to which other things are subservientand a due regard to the environment where Fate has placed herLucasAnnualedited by EVLucas The Macmillan CompanyNew York Of coursethe correct literary pose toward even the bestcollectionsis one of indulgent condescensionNeverthelesswe must admit that in Lucas s collection Ruskin s criticism of one of Browning s poems gives us a good laugh and an intellectual challengethat Barrie s Hyphen and the prize novelSpoofare clever satires on literary style that Browning s letter emphasizes what we felt while prying into the Browning Lettersthat our self respect could never again be the samethat as a whole the book appeals to our sense of humor and to our literary tasteNothing Else Mattersby William Samuel Johnson Mitchell KennerleyNew York That jaded epithet like champaigne should have been reserved for this novelfor it bubbles and sparkles and leaves a luxurious taste in one s literary

the affairs are told in such a directinteresting mannerwithout the pettiness of gossipthat we find sufficient excuse for our human weaknessThe Little Review 59 The Reader CriticGeorge MiddletonNew YorkI read Wedded with much interest and really want to congratulate you upon your courage in producing itAs I told the authorwhom I recently metI do not think technically it is perfecthe has overdrawn the minister and made an author s comment in his linesI feel the last line absolutely out of keyfor the effectin my judgmentwould have been much stronger if the minister had been less obviously the hypocriteAside from a little bungling in the openingI thinkhoweverthat its sincerity is much more important than this captious criticismI feel he put over quite clearly a situation in human life which should be presentedAnd it was courageous of you to affront public opinionas you no doubt haveand give place to such a sincere little piece of lifeI wonder when the world is going to let us talk about all the things we now smirk over and knowOnce we can place these sex matters on the same plane of conversation as we do pork and cheese then they will really cease to be importantI believe in the reticences of taste and proportionbut not those of subject matterAnd sooner or later the question of birth control must be given wide publicityso that only wanted children will come into the worldSo long as functionally the woman must bear the labour and thus suffer unequally in parenthoodso should we do everything through education to arm her against assuming unwilling burdensWhen children are born of free choice in marriage then they will partake of a higher dignityand parenthood itself will mean more than a functional disturbance and a matter of rebellion it now is with manyAny play which makes us question our nice polite functions about morality should be accessible to those not afraid of new ideasIt is curious how little faith the innate conservative has in human nature and the finer things of lifeSo afraid are they that they would bind people by old traditions and not personally achieved opinionsWedded presents in vivid phrase a fragment of life which has no doubt come to many a womanand I heartily congratulate you for the courage which prompted you to give the author a hearingSHG New YorkThe November number is the best yetI don t like Iris s work as well as I do Bodenheim sjudging by these poems I think he has been too much praisedBodenheim makes some superb contributions to language and imageryLangner s play doesn t escape the querulous note in spotsbut it is worth doing and is done well on the wholeDarrow s article is well knit and presents an ideaThe best thing in the issue is Kaun s translationAnd I dislike very much your article on Emma Goldmanbecause it falls so far below the hardness of thought it should have hadI have taken much to heart two articles in the first New RepublicRebecca West s The Duty of Harsh Criticism and the editorsForce and IdeasWe who are saying things in public have a simply tremendous responsibility not only to feelbut to knowand to use the acid test on everything we sayYour article shows that you have been carried away by a personality to approval of a social programand is the most convincing proof I have ever seen that belief in anarchism is a product of the artistic temperament rather than the result of an intelligent attempt to criticise and remould societyI know you did not intend it to be so that is the reason it annoys me so muchIt was a wise and necessary thing to correct misapprehensions about Emma Goldman s personalitythat you have done fairly wellthough even that is marred by too much protesting and a substitution of a somewhat sentimental elation for power of mind and emotionBut your offhand generalities on the top of the third page are just the sort of shoddy thinking that justifies conservatives in dismissing social theorists with a sneerand imprisoning them when they get dangerousThese generalities do not even accurately represent Wilde s essayIt is not that I disagree with youI recognize a fundamental truth in these things if it could only be disentangledmade definiteand appliedBut to a discerning and unprejudiced reader it is quite evident that in order to save yourself the trouble and unromantic grind of doing thisyou have made a lot of meaningless assumptions without really knowing very much about history or anthropology or psychology or any of the other wonderful tools which modern heroes have put at the service of the human willYou have the blind faith of a Catholic saint in divine revelation the only difference is that the terms of the revelation are alteredAs a thing entirely apart from the above objectionthe sporadic violence of the anarchists is puerile and ridiculousThe whole muddle in which the anarchists find themselves on account of their disagreements as to violence is an example of the necessity of efficient and intelligent organization which is exactly what government in its essence isto mebut is not now My own position on anarchism has become more clearly defined than beforeI stand fundamentally with Montessori on the position that the beginning and the end of revolution is improvement of the individualI should be prepared to endorse a brutal autocracy if that bred better human stockI am thoroughly convinced that Emma Goldman could preach until she lost her voice without producing an appreciable effectThe world has had too much preachingThere would be something finally tragic about the waste of such a personality as hers unless there were a better way of accomplishing her objectShe has been working for yearsyet ninety nine per cent of Americans regard her as a sort of Carrie NationThe more we long for her success the more we appreciate her personalitythe more keenly we must criticise her methodThe question of how race hygiene must be applied is a profound and complex matterimpossible of solution by any individualIt will be solved graduallyand as a resultant of honest intellectual work by all forward looking people more especially by your despised scientistsIt will be a matter of inspired scientific educationof proper industrial conditionsof profound art stimulusof sex reformin shortof most of the things advocated today by the socialist partyI have a fair to middling imaginationbut I totally fail to see how these things may properly be put into action without intelligent governmental organizationWe simply must not narrow our minds by perfectionist generalitiesIt is the duty and the inspiration of the poet to understand and use scienceof the scientist to develop the poet in himselfof all to face grimly every fact which concerns him and banish forever from his mind sentimentalismSentimentalism about ribbons and candy is sometimes prettybut sentimentalism about the human race is a terrible form of blasphemy and the greatest of the sins of pettinessNow that I have spoken honestlydon t think I have joined the ranks of irascible conservativesand that I yell because I ve been proddedNo one realizes more than I the necessity of greater emotionor more sweeping visionBut let s not make our vision sweeping by the simple process of cutting off our view The Little Review 61 OBLOMOFFDOM Minnie LyonChicagoWe are told by literary authorities that a certain Goncharoff occupies the place next to Turgeniev and Tolstoy in Russian literatureAs to this I cannot vouchbut I can say that he has written a most profound and wonderful book called Oblomoff wherein he has depicted in convincing terms the enthralling bondage of Russia s intellectuals in her days of stagnant inactivityFrom this book was coined the phrase Russian Malady of Oblomoffdom so well did it dissect her diseased and irresolute will a malady so universal as to make one feel that Oblomoff was written for us as well as for RussiaIt certainly is a direct emphasis upon a condition which prevails so largely both in our personal and social life that few can read this inimitable pen portrait without a sneaking feeling that some of his own lineaments are limned thereinGoncharoff writes of his hero The joy of higher inspiration was accessible to him the miseries of mankind were not strange to himSometimes he cried bitterly in the depths of his heart about human sorrowsHe felt unnamedunknown sufferings and sadnessand a desire of going somewhere far awayprobably into that world towards which Stoltz had tried to take him in his younger daysSweet tears would then flow upon his cheekIt would also happen that he would feel hatred towards human vicestowards deceittowards the evil which is spread all over the worldand he would then feel the desire to show mankind its diseasesThoughts would then burn within himrolling in his head like waves in the sea they would grow into decisions which would make all his blood boil his muscles would be ready to movehis sinews would be strainedintentions would be on the point of transforming themselves into decisionsMoved by a moral force he would rapidly change over and over again his position in his bed with a fixed stare he would lift himself from itmove his handlook about with inspired eyes the inspiration would seem ready to realize itselfto transform itself into an act of heroism and thenwhat miraclewhat admirable results might one not expect from so great an effort But the morning would pass awaythe shades of evening would take the place of broad daylight and with them the strained forces of Oblomoff would incline towards rest the storm in his soul would subside his head would shake off the worrying thoughts his blood would circulate more slowly in his veins and Oblomoff would slowly turn over and recline on his back look sadly through his window upon the skyfollowing sadly with his eyes the sun which was setting gloriously And how many times had he thus followed with his eyes that sunsetHow easy to fall back upon a soft bed of concessions and drift into a world of forgetfulness It is just into terrible inertia this every day and every day humdrum conservatistic acceptance of things as they are that THE LITTLE REVIEW comes with its laughter of the godsit is so joyousso fearlessso sure of its purposeand hurls itself against it with its vital young blood and its burning
