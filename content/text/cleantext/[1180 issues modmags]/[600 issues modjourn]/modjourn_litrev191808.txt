the Yellow Book and the Savoy found specially stimulating in Henry James The things you saw clearest he suggests we may have missed I am not versed in our younger writersview of Henry James s workThis is probably a good thingI may point out asoursthe very lustres that they also hailshould I do thisit will reinforce my faithand surely theirsin both epochsFor we mustdespite our differencesbe at one in believing that artists at all times are after the same thing essentiallyand therefore that real lustres do not fadenor even turn rococo and amusinglike the lustres on the chimney piecesShortlythenwhat we found stimulating in Henry James was the new world he took us toNo one had been there before himHis style was of course his ownhe could not have been chef d ecole without a personal styleWe took thatin that sensefor grantedbut the styletoowas the air of that new world in which we moved with fellow creatures round usIt was like landing on the Moon or Marsand finding the familiar turned into the strangeyet recognisable by the familiar and the strange within ourselvesThat is to sayhe was a masterthis is the mark of all the mastersBut the newness had to diefor newness bears its death about with itHere comes the test for permanenceIf the younger writerslanding on the Jacobean planetfind that they can breathe its airget food and drinkenjoy themselvesgo forth from it refreshed to make new planets of their own then all is welland Henry James is greatand wewho could be dazzled by the newnessneed not blush because we blinkedThe finest air of that planet was the magic of his earlier not his earliest mannerWe read him at that hour of his career 2 The Little Review as much to see how he would say it as to see what he would say I don t care what he does if he will go on doing it like that we used to cryand he went on doing it like that in Washington SquareThe Portrait of a LadyThe Aspern Papersin the many tales which had for theme that question which it isand which is whichof the blessing or the bans ofsuccessorfailurein the artist s lifein the great ghost storiesAll these were to us the source of joys as actual and exquisite as the joy of sunlightThe day we had a new Henry James to read could have no utterly bad momentfor there was always the volume or the story to come back to or go on toWe found let us state it boldly everything we wanted in themThere was the pure fablewhatever it might beand we never found itin those middle period pieceswanting in the fable qualityHis themes were intimately thrillingthen there was the methodsubtle yet not ever subtlelucid yet profoundstill waters really running deepthe preparation and the involutionthe return upon itselfand forshowingof all thisthere were the diction and the mannerbeautiful and lustrous pages that shone and shimmered and sparkledthat spread and spilt and built before our eyes the grass and flowers and treesthe streams and brooksthe old grey churches and old rose red houses making up the English landscape that for Henry Jarnes was an elysiandescription The world is like a knell that very seldom summons us to heavenbut he did not describeYou found yourself in the enchanted place and never knew how you got thereWas it better than therealplaceYou often thought it wasand people told you you were decadentthat that was decadence to find the words about it better than the thing itselfYou said you didn t careif this were decadence you were glad to he a decadentIt was a timebelieve meworth the living inwhen Henry James was in his middle periodThis was the best timefor at both ends of his career he fell into extremesAt the beginning his ease threatened toor actually did sometimesturn into slicknessThe blithe accomplishment would look like little more than thatyou occasionallywished he wouldn t He soon felt this himself and didn tThen began the middle periodand it was for us what I have saidBut it developedthere came the hesitation and retreatthe infinite circumlocutionAt first it was delightfulThe Awkward AgeThe Wings of a Dove but even alreadythe reading of a Henry James became like the playing of a difficult piece of musicYou knew you wouldn t be able to p ay it the first timeyou must practiseyou must finger The Little Review 3 and pedalHis aspect had always better answered to the volte face in his method of expression than to the facile early styleIn the portrait of him as a little boy which fronts the first autobiographical bookyou catch already the apprehensionhumourous and mournfulof all that he couldsee I never beheldfor my partany creature who struck me as to his degree assailed by the perceptionsThe greatheavy lidded eyesupon my wordwere more alarmed than piercingThey were piercingbut it was as if he wished they weren tfor dear life s sakeAll this was faithfully reflected in the latest literary mannerin no example more distressfully than in that critical essay on the Younger Novelists which for us who had adored him was the sad surprise of his careerHe selected for that essay writers to whom he certainly did no great honour save in noticing them at allbut that he should notice them at all was our amazement and our griefAnd that he dismissed with a contemptuous word the only one he rightly noticed MrDHLawrence was aturn of the screwwhich still we groan to think ofThat fell mistake came out of the alarm with which he saw the onset of the new agewith its new orientationThe great eyes shutand with them shuthe chose his prophetsHe rushedthus blindinto the wrong temple ratherinto none at allnot even a young lionsdenbut a mere plaster meeting houseNothing that he ever wrote is difficult as this to readand when it is readyou are poorer than beforeTruethat the bouquets thus bestowed are meagre to invisibilitybut that he should have deigned to offer even those We saw where Henry James went wrong in all these mattersyet earlier than the fatal essayearlier even than the volte face which became a running awaywe had perceived another question coming to assail devotionHere again that shyness of his answers itThis man of the world was what we must call shybecause there is a deeper meaning in the word than the most commonly accepted oneHe was shy as a race horse is shy all stares and startsand for the same reason that the race horse isHe was too highly specialisedA man of the worldas I wrote thatI saw that I was face to face with the question which transcends the other questions about Henry James The world was he concerned with any world but onethat of the drawing roomsAndbeing concerned with that alonewith what about itHe saw no aspect of it butrelations at any ratereacted to no otherThe younger generation has abandoned that aspect Relationsare not the young 4 The Little Review writersgameas Henry James would certainly have saidwith his delight in gentle slang It is a new orientationwe Jacobeans find the path a trifle stonyOur own was brierynot stonytentacles wereso to speakour tools and tentacles are useless against stonesNeverthelesswe had seenso far as it was given to us to seethefeet upon the fendernote in himHe was always drinking tea in the drawing roomwe saidHe made the drawing room a working model of the universeand was itTo day the question has been answeredit is notHereof coursewe tread upon the sacred ground ofsubject The writer s choice of subject is not matter for discussionwith treatment only is criticism concernedThe dogmalike all dogmasmay be pushed too farAt some hour in the judgement day of writers the question will be put In how many directions could he see This number of The Little Review isas I hopea proof that Henry James survivesyet I know one or two young writers of the serious sort who never read a word of himThat would not have been conceivable in our dayin those who reallymeant it Something must have happened and I hope MrPound will tell us what it isProbably the drawing room is at the bottom of itbut there is also what one of these who have not read a word of Henry James describes as thebull in the china shop stunt This young person does that stuntand brilliantlyI who had called itmore respectfully thesquare touch cried out We were Aeolian harpsconfound it and the air of an orangeblack and white and blueand purple studio became foul with shameful words Sensitivesentimentaltremulous the hideous sounds swept the full gamut of the damned Aeolian harpbut even to say damned was vainI ought to have said bloodyI think that is what has happenedThe bull in the china shop has smashed up the Aeolian harpit must have been a curiosity shop and what in Henry James was onlyharpwill goand what was notwill stayAgainI leave to MrPound the task of disentanglementThe Little Review 5 IN EXPLANATION Ezra Pound IIT IS suitable that our discussion should be opened by one of Henry James s fellow contributors to the Yellow Bookby a representative of the decade of brilliancy and nuancesMy own essay is a dull grind of an affaira Baedecker to the continentI have not answered Miss Mayne s questions very wellJamesto the wildest and most vigorousbullof my generationwasan extraordinary old woman but one of the few

answer to the drawing room or not going down town questionMrRodker deals with the Notes on NovelistsI am not responsible for his opinionsI see no mystery in the matterThe Times Literary Supplement had got so groggy that something had to be doneOrders went forth from Shushan wherein is the palacethatsomething had to be done TheLitSup was on the blinkon the blink so shockinanstaggerinthat something had to be clone to boost up its giddy prestigeThere were but two spotless paladinstwo giddy Galahads available Henry James and the impeccable BeerbohmSo Max and the great stylist were tackledcajoledbribedwheedled and what notAnd the Notes on Novelists weregot out of the late Henry somehowafter all The Times is an institutionand Henry James was weak on institutionson all things with traditionsThe Times had probably neverin the sixty years previousasked him to writeAnd the Literary Supplement isafter allthe most respectable weekly English publication which puts up aliterarycamouflageIt is duller than ditch waterIts best and most openminded writer never gets an idea hard and fastHe absorbs a blur and is worriedThe elder hacks ought to be given ratsbaneBut still anyone might fall to an invitation to do the front page of theSup Henry James was not above itAs Miss Mayne sayshe might have done his job betterI remember when the two articles appearedbut only on the receipt The Little Review 6 of the two MSSincluded in this issuehad it ever occurred to me that anyone could be particularly grieved or particularly interested in this trifling unlustrous incidentI set outin my own essayto explainnot why Henry James is less read than formerly I do not know that he isI tried to set down a few reasons why he ought to beor at least might bemore readA

realized that never in history has one of her great men abandoned his citizenship out of shameIt was the last actthe last thing leftHe had worked all his life for the nation and for a year he had

same public mannerAmerica passes over these thingsbut the thoughtful cannot pass over themArmageddonthe conflictI turn to James s A Bundle of Lettersa letter fromDrRudolph Staubin Parisending You willI thinkhold me warranted in believing that between precipitate decay and internecine enmitiesthe English speaking family is destined to consume itself and that with its decline the prospect of general pervasiveness to which I alluded abovewill brighten for the deep lunged children of the fatherland We have heard a great deal of this sort of thing sinceit sounds very naturalMy edition of the volume containing these letters was printed in83and the imaginary letters were written somewhat before thatI do not know that this calls for commentHenry James s perception came thirty years before ArmageddonThat is all I wish to point outFlaubert said of the War of 1870 If they had read my Education Senthmentalethis sort of thing wouldn t have happened Artists are the antennae of the racebut the bullet headed many will never learn to trust their great artistsIf it is the business of the artist to make humanity aware of itselfhere the thing was donethe pages of diagnosisThe multitude of wearisome fools will not learn their right hand from their left or seek out a meaningIt is always easy for people to object to what they have not tried to understandI am not here to write a full volume of detailed criticismbut two things I do claim which I have not seen in reviewersessaysFirstthat there was emotional greatness in Henry James s hatred of tyrannysecondlythat there was titanic volumeweightin the masses he sets in opposition within his workHe uses forces no whit less specifically powerful than the proverbialdoom of the house DestinyDeus ex machinaof great traditional art9 The Little Review His art was great art as opposed to over elaborate or over refined art by virtue of the majorconflicts which he portraysIn his books he showed race against raceimmutablethe essential Americannessor Englishness or Frenchness in The Americanthe difference between one nation and anothernot flag waving and treatiesnot the machinery of governmentbutwhythere is always misunder standingWhy men of different race are not the sameWe have ceased to believe that we conquer anything by having Alexander the Great make a giganticjoy ridethrough IndiaWe know that conquests are made in the laboratorythat Curie with his minute fragments of things seen clearly in test tubes in curious apparatimakes conquestsSotooin these novelsthe essential qualities which make up the national qualitiesare found and set workingthe fundamental oppositions made clearThis is no contemptible labourNo other writer had so essayed three great nations or even thought of attempting itPeace comes of communicationNo man of our time has so laboured to create means of communication as did the late Henry JamesThe whole of great art is a struggle for communicationAll things set against this are evil whether they be silly scoffing or obstructive tariffsAnd this communication is not a levellingit is not an elimination of differencesIt is a recognition of differencesof the right of differences to existof interest in finding things differentKultur is an abominationphilology is an abominationall repressive uniforming education is an evilA SHAKE DOWN Ezra Pound I HAVE forgotten the moment of lunar imbecility in which I conceived the idea of anHenry JamesnumberThe pile of typescript on my floor can but annoyingly and too palpably testify that the madness has raged for some weeksHenry James was aware of the spherical form of the planetand susceptible to a given situationand to the tone and tonality of persons as perhaps no other author in all literatureThe victim and the votary of thescene he had no very great narrative senseor at the leasthe attained the narrative faculty but per asperathrough very great striving10 The Little Review It is impossible to speak accurately ofhis stylefor he passed through several styles which differ greatly one from anotherbut in his lasthis most complicated and elaboratehe is capable of great concisionand ifin itthe single sentence is apt to turn and perform evolutions for almost pages at a timehe nevertheless manages to say on one page more than many a moredirectauthor would convey only in the course of a chapterHis plots and incidents are often but adumbrations or symbols of the quality of hispeople illustrations inventedcontrivedoften factitiously and almost transparentlyto show what actswhat situationswhat contingencies would befit or display certain charactersWe are hardly asked to accept them as happeningHe did not begin his career with any theory of art for art s sakeand a lack of this theory may have damaged his earlier workIf we take French Poets and Novelists as indication of his then1878opinionsand novels of the nineties showing a later biaswe might contend that our subject began his career with a desire to square all things to the ethical standards of a Salem mid week Unitarian prayer meetingand that to almost the end of his course he greatly desired to fit the world into the social exigencies of MrsHumphrey Ward s charactersOut of the unfortunate cobwebs he emerged into his greatnessI thinkby two causesfirst by reason of his hatred of personal intimate tyrannies working at close rangeand secondlyin later lifebecause the actual mechansim of his scriptorial processes became so bulkybecame so huge a contrivance for record and depictionthat the old man simply couldn t remember or keep his mind on or animadvert on anything but the authenticity of his impressionI take it as the supreme reward for an artistthe supreme return that his artistic conscience can make him after years spent in its servicethat the momentum of his artthe sheer bulk of his processesthesi licetsize of his fly wheelshould heave him out of himselfout of his personal limitationsout of the tangles of heredity and of environmentout of the bias of early trainingof early pre dilectionswhether of FlorenceAD1300or of Back Bay of 1872and leave him simply the great true recorderAnd this reward came to Henry James in the ripeness of his talentseven further perhapsit entered his life and his conversationThe stages of his emergence are marked quite clearly in his workHe displays himself in French Poets and Novelistsconstantly balancing over the question of whether or no the characters presented in their works areor are notfit persons to be received in the James family back parlourThe Little Review 11 In The Tragic Muse he is still didactic quite openlyThe things he believes still leap out nakedly among the people and things he is portrayingthe parable is not yet wholly incarnate in the narrativeTo lay all his faults on the tablewe may begin with his self confessed limitationthathe never went down town He displayed in fact a passion for high life comparable only to that supposed to inhere in the readers of a magazine called Forget me notHardywith his eye on the Greek tragedianshas produced an epic tonalityand The Mayor of Casterbridge is perhaps more easily comparable to the Grettir Saga than to the novels of MrHardy s contemporariesHardy ison his other sidea contemporary of Sir Walter ScottBalzac gains what force his crude writing permits him by representing his people under the uvayK q of modernitycash necessityJamesby leaving cash necessity nearly always out of the storysacrificesor rather fails to attaincertain intensitiesHe never manages the classicI mean as Flaubert gives us in

forces and in a way all his ownIf Balzac tried to give a whole civilizationa whole humanityJames was not content with a rough sketch of one countryAs Armageddon has only too clearly shownnational qualities are the great gods of the present and Henry James spent himself from the beginning in an analysis of these potent chemicalstrying to determine from the given microscopic slide the nature of the FrenchnessEnglishnessGermannessAmericannesswhich chemicalstoo little regardedhave in our time exploded for want of watchingThey are the permanent and fundamental hostilities and incompatiblesWe may rest our claim for his greatness in the magnitude of his protagonistsin the magnitude of the forces he analyzed and portrayedThis is not the bare matter of a number of titled peoplea few duchesses and a few butlersThe Little Review 12 Whatever Flaubert may have said about his Education Sentimentale as a potential preventive of the debacle of 1870if people had read itand whatever Gautier s friend may have said about Emaux et Camees as the last resistance to the Prussiansfrom Dr Rudolph Staub s paragraph in The Bundle of Letters to the last and almost only public act of his lifeJames displayed a steady perception and a steady consideration of the qualities of different western racesWhose consequences none of us can escapeAnd these forcesin precisely that they are not political and executive and therefore transientfactitiousbut in precisely that they are the forces of race temperamentsare major forces and are indeed as great protagonists as any author could have chosenThey are firmer ground than Flaubert s when he chooses public events as in the opening of the third part of Education SentimentalcThe portrayal of these forcesto seize a term from philologymay be said to constituteoriginal researchto be Henry James s own addendumnot that this greatly mattersHe sawanalyzedand presented themHe had most assuredly a greater awareness than was granted to Balzac or to

storiesWe may leave Hardy writing SagasWe may admit that there is a greater robustesza in Balzac s messinesssimply because he is perpetually concernedinaccuratelywith the factor of moneyof earning one s exiguous livingWe may admit the sbadowy nature of some of James s writingand agree whimsically with RHC in the New Agethat James will be quite comfortable after deathas he had been dealing with ghosts all his lifeJames s third donation is perhaps a less sweeping affair and of more concern to his compatriots than to anyone who might conceivably translate him into an alien tongueor even to those who publish his writings in EnglandHe has written history of a personal sortsocial history well The Little Review 13 documented and incompleteand he has put America on the map both in memoir and fictiongiving to her a reality such as is attained only by scenes recorded in the arts and in the writing of mastersMrEliot has writtenand I daresay most other American admirers have written or will writethatwhatever anyone else thinks of Henry Jamesno one but an American can ever knowreally knowhow good he is at the bottomhow good hisAmericaisNo Englishman canand in less degree can any continentalor in fact anyone whose family was not living onsayWest 23rd Street in the old set backtwo storey porched red brick vine covered housesetc when Henry James was being a small boy on East

with General Grant or something of that sortwould quite know Washington Square or The Europeans to be so autochthonousso authentic to the conditionsThey might believe the things to bereal but they

manages his long sought form in The Awkward AgeHe comes out the triumphant stylist in the American Scene and in all the items of The Finer Grain collection and in the posthumous Middle YearsThis is not to damn incontinent all that intervenesbut I think the chief question addressed to me by people of good will who do notbut are yet ready and willing toread James isWhere the deuce shall I beginOne cannot take even the twenty four volumesmore or less selected volumes of the Macmillan edition all at onceand it isalasbut too easy to get so started and entoiled as never to finish this author or even come to the best of himThe laziness of an uncritical period can be nowhere more blatant than in the inherited habit of talking about authors as a wholeIt is perhaps the sediment from an age daft over great figures or a way of displaying social gushthe desire for a celebrity at all costsrather than a care of lettersTo talk in any other way demands an acquaintance with the work of an authora price few conversationalists care to payma cheIt is the man with inherited opinions who talks aboutShelley making no distinction between the author of the Fifth Act of The Cenci and of the Sensitive PlantNot but what there may be a personal virtu in an author appraisedhoweverfrom the best of his work whenthat isit is correctly appraisedPeople ask me what James to readHe is very uneven authornot

hold the argumentative fieldsuffer comparison with other writerswithsaythe De Goncourtor De MaupassantI am not impertinently throwing books on the scrap heapthere are certain valid objections to Jamesthere are certain standards which one may believe inand having stated themone is free to state that any author does not comply with themgranting always that there may be other standards with which he compliesor over which he charmingly or brilliantly triumphsJames does notfeelas solid as Flauberthe does not give usEveryman but on the other handhe was aware of things which Fiaubert was not aware ofand in certain things supersedes the author of Madame BovaryHe appears at times to write around and around a thing and not always to emerge from theamorous planof what he wanted to presentinto definite presentationHe does not seem to me at all times evenly skillful in catching the intonations of speechHe recalls the New Englandain theLady ssmall brothersHa ard Hnahr dbut only if one is familiar with thephonetics describedbutvide the beginning of The Birthplaceone is not convinced that he really knowsby any sure instincthow peoplesvoices would soundSome remarks are in The Little Review 17 keysome obviously factitiousHe gives us more of his characters by description than he can by any attribution of conversationsave perhaps by the isolated and discreet remarks of BrooksmithHis emotional centre is in being sensitive to the feel of the place or to the tonality of the personIt is with his own so beautiful talkhis ability to hear his own voice in the rounded paragraphthat he is aptest to charm oneI find it often though not universally hard tohearhis characters speakingI have noted various places where the character notably stops speaking and the author interpolates words of his ownsentences that no one but Henry James could in any circumstances have made use ofBeyond which statements I see no great concision or any clarity to be gained by rearranging my perhaps too elliptical comments on individual booksHonest criticismas I conceive itcannot get much further than saying to one s reader exactly what one would say to the friend who approaches one s bookshelf asking What the deuce shall I read Beyond this there is theparlor game the polite essayand there is the official pronouncementwith neither of which we are concernedOf all exquisite writers James is the most colloquialyet in the first edition of his French Poets and Novelistshis stylesave for a few scattered phrasesis so little unusual that most of the book seemssuperficiallyas if it might have been written by almost oneIt contains some surprising lapsesas bad as any in MrHueffer or even in MrMenckenIt is interesting largely in that it shows us what our subject had to escape fromLet us grant at once that his novels show himall through his lifepossessed of the worst possible taste in picturesof an almost unpunctured ignorance of paintingof almost as great a lack of taste as that which he attributes to the hack work and newspaper critiques of Theophile GautierLet us admit thatpaintingto Henry James probably meant to the end of his lifethe worst possible late Renaissance conglomerationsLet us admit that in 1876or whenever it washis taste in poetry inclined to the swish of De Mussetthat it very likely never got any furtherBypoetryhe very possibly meant thehigh falutinand he eschewed it in certain formshimself taking still higher falutes in a to be developed mode of his ownI doubt if he ever wholly outgrew that conception of theby him so often invokedDaughters of MemoryHe arrived truly at 18 The Little Review a point from which he could look back upon people whobesough the deep blue sea to roll Poetry to him beganperhapsfullfledgec springing Minerva like from the forehead of George GordonLon Byronand went pretty much to the bad in in Charles Baudelaire it did not require much divination by 1914The Middle Yearsto note that he had found Tennyson rather vacuous and that thenwas something inBrowningJames was so thoroughly a recorder of peopleof their atmos pheressocietypersonalitysettingso wholly the artist of thiparticular genrethat it was impossible for him ever to hold a critica opinion of art out of key with the opinion about him except possibly in so far as he might have ambitions for the novelfor his owr particular metierHis critical opinions were simply an extensior of his being in key with the nice people whoimpressedthemselves on his gelatineplateThis is a theoretical generalization anc must be taken cum grano We mayperhapstake his adjectives on De Musset as a desperate attempt to dojusticeto a man with whom he knew it impossible for him to sympathiseThere ishowevernothing to hinder our supposing that he saw in De Musset sgushsomething for him impossible and that he wished to acknowledge itSide by side with this are the shreds of Back Bay or Buffalothe mid weekprayer meeting point of viewHis most egregious slip is in the essay on Baudelairethe sentence quoted by HuefferNotwithstanding thishe does effectively put his nippers on Baudelaire s weaknessA good way to embrace Baudelaire at a glance is to say that he wasin his treatment of evilexactly what Hawthorne was not Hawthornewho felt the thing at its sourcedeep in the human consciousnessBaudelaire s infinitely slighter volume of genius aparthe was a sort of Hawthorne reversedIt is the absence of this metaphysical quality in his treatment of his favourite subjectsPoe was s metaphysicianand his devotion sustained him through a translation of Eureka that exposes him to that class of accusations of which MEdmond Scherer s accusation of feeding upon pourriture is an exampleandin factin his pages we never know with what we are dealingWe encounter an inextricable confusion of sad emotions and vile thingsand we are at a loss to know whether theFor a poet to be realist is of course nonsense andas Hueffer sayssuch a sentence from such a source is enough to make one despair of human natureThe Little Review 19 subject pretends to appeal to our conscience or we were going to say to our olfactories Le Mai we exclaim you do yourself too much honourThis is not Evilit is not the wrongit is simply the nasty Our impatience is of the same order as that which we should feel if a poetpretending to pluckthe flowers of good should come and present usas specimensa rhapsody on plum cake and eau de Cologne Here as elsewhere his perceptionapart from the readability of the workis worthy of noticeHueffer says that James belauds BalzacI cannot see itI can but perceive Henry James wiping the floor with the author of Eugenie Grandetpointing out all his qualitiesbut almightily wiping the floor with himHe complains that Gautier is lacking in a concern about supernatural hocus pocus and that Flaubert is lackingIf Balzaz takes him to any great extent inJames with his inherited Swedenborgianism is perhaps thereby laid open to BalzacIt was natural that James should write more about the bulky author of La Come die Humaine than about the othershere was his richest quarryhere was there most to note and to emend and to appy so emended to processes of his ownFrom De MaupassantDe Goncourt or Baudelaire there was nothing for him to acquireHis dam d fuss about furniture is foreshadowed in Balzacand all the paragraphs on Balzac s house furnishing propensities are of interest in proportion to our interest inor our boredom withthis part of Henry James s workWhatindeed could he have written of the De Goncourts save that they were a little dull but tremendously right in their aimIndeedbut for these almost autobiographical details pointing to his growth out of Balzacall James would seern but a corollary to one passage

could have had little to do with the matterFrench Poets and Novelists was published in78 and Edmond De Goncourt signed the preface to Les Freres Zemganno in79The paragraphs quoted are interestinghoweveras showing De Goncourt s state of mind in that yearHe had probably been preaching in this vein long before setting the words on paperbefore getting them printedIf ever one man s career was foreshadowed in a few sentences of anotherHenry James s is to be found in this paragraphIt is very much as if he saidI will not be a megatherium botcher like Balzacthere is nothing to be said about these De Goncourtsbut one must try to be rather more interesting than they are inlet us sayMadame GervaisaisProceeding with the volume of criticismwe find that Le Jenne Hsimply didn tgetFlaubertthat he was much alive to the solid parts of TurgenevHe shows himself very aptas we said aboveto judge the merits of a novelist on the ground that the people portrayed by the said novelist are or are not suited to reception into the household of Henry James seniorwhetherin shortEmma Bovary or Frederic or MArnoux would have spoiled the so It is my personal feeling at the moment that La Fille Elisa is worth so much more than all Balzac that the things are as out of scale as a sapphire and a plum puddingand that Elisadespite the dull sectionis worth most of James s writingThis ishoweveraside from the question we are discussingThe Little Review 21 delicate admospherehave joggled the so fine susceptibilities of a refined 23rd Street family at the time of the PhiladelphiaCentennial I find the book not so much a sign that Henry James wasdisappointed as Hueffer puts itas that he was simply and horribly shocked by the literature of his continental forebears and contemporariesIt is only when he gets to the Theatre Francais that he finds something which really suits himHere there is ordertraditionperhaps a slight fustinessbut a quite pardonable fustinessan arranged and suitable fustiness having its recompense in a sort of spiritual quiet hereat any ratewas something decoroussomething not to be found in Concord or in AlbanyAnd it is easy to imagine the young Jamesnot illuminated by De Goncourt s possible conversation or writingnot even following the hint given in his essay on Balzac and Balzacian furniturebut sitting before Madame Nathalie in Le Village and resolving to be the Theatre Francais of the novelA resolution which he may be said to have carried out to the great enrichment of lettersIIStrictures on the work of this period are no great detractionFrench Poets and Novelists gives us a point from which to measure Henry James s advanceGenius showed itself partly in the escape from some of his original limitationspartly in acquirementsHis art at length becamesecond nature became perhaps half unconsciousor in part wholly unconsciousin other parts perhaps too highly consciousAt any rate in sunnier circumstances he talked

the humour of thingshad never been specifically disengaged from his several other sensesHe vaguely felt that something should be done about thisand in a general manner proposed to do itfor he was on his way to explore a society abounding in comic aspectsThis consciousness of a missing measure gave him a certain mistrust of what might be said of himand if circumspection is the essence of diplomacy

Little Review 33 The main feeling in The Awkward Age is satiricThe dashes of sentiment do not help the work as literatureThe acute observer is often referred toPage 131 The ingenious observer just now suggested might even have detectedPage 133And it might have been apparent still to our sharp spectatorMost good prose arisesperhapsfrom an instinct of negationis the detailedconvincing analysis of something detestableof something which one wants to eliminatePoetry is the assertion of a positiveie of desireand remainsendures for a longer periodPoetic satire is only an assertion of this positiveinverselyie as of an opposite hatredThis is an highly untechnicalunimpressionistin fact almost theological manner of statementbut is perhaps the root difference between the two arts of literatureMost good poetry asserts something to be worth whileor damns a contraryat any rate asserts emotional valuesThe best prose ishas been a presentationcomplicated and elaborate as you likeof circumstancesof conditionsfor the most part abominableor at the mildestamendableThis assertion of the more or less objectionable only becomes doctrinaire and rotten art when the narrator mis states from dogmatic biasand when he suggests some quack remedy prohibitionChristianitysocial theory of one sort or another the only cure being that humanity should display more intelligence and good will

also occurs in Ivory TowerPage 196 This scrutinous person wastes a great deal of time in pretending to conceal his contempt for MrsBrookVanderbankthe other punksand lays it on so thick when presenting his old sentimentalist Longdon who at the one critical moment behaves with a stupiditywith a lack of delicacysince we are dealing with these refinementsOf course neither this stupidity of his action nor the tone of the other characters has anything to do with the question of maestriaif they were dispassionately or impartially renderedThe book isweak because all through it James is so manifestly carrying on a long tenzone so fiercely and loudlya long argument for the old lavenderThere is also the constant implication that Vanderbank ought to want Nandathough why the devil he should be supposed to be even mildly under this obligationis not made clearA basis in the classicscastor oileven Stevenson s Virginibus Puerisque might havehelped mattersOne s complaint is not that people of this sort don t existthat they aren t like everything else a subject for literaturebut that James doesn t anywhere in the book get down to bedrockIt is too much as if he were depicting stage scenery

YEARSEzra Pound THE MIDDLE YEARS is a tale of the great adventureforputting aside a few simple adventuressentimentalphallicNimrodicthe remaining great adventure is precisely the approach to the Metropolisfor the provincial of our race the specific approach to Londonand no subject surely could more heighten the pitch of writing than that the treated approach should be that of the greatest writer of our time and own particular languageWe mayI thinkset aside Thomas Hardy as of an age not our ownof perhaps Walter Scott s or of L Abbe Prevost sbut remote from us and things familiarly under our handand we skip over the next few crops of writers as lacking in any comparative interestinterest in a writer being primarily in his degree of sensitizationand on this 40 The Little Review count we may throw out the whole Wells Bennet periodfor what interest can we take in instruments which must of nature miss two thirds of the vibrations in any conceivable situationIn James the maximum sensibility compatible with efficient writing was presentIndeedin reading these pages one can but despair over the inadequacy of one s own literary sensitizationones so utterly inferior state of awarenesseven allowing for what the author himself allowhis not reallyperhapshaving felt at twentysixall that at seventy he more or less read into the memory of his feelingThe point is that with the exception of exceptional moments in Hueffer we find no trace of such degree of awareness in the next lot of wr tersor until the first novels of Lewis and Joycewhose awareness iswithout sayingof a nature greatly different in kindIt is not the book for any reader to tackle who has not read a good deal of Jamesor who has not in default of that readingbeen endowed with a natural Jamesian

gone off on connoisseurshipwasconceivablyAirshedbut here in his depiction of his earlier self the verve returnedundiminishedHENRY JAMESAND THE GHOSTLY AROrage I HAVE seen it written that Henry James was a greater psychologist than his brother Williamand I have seen it denied with indignationThe dispute might have been saved by the true statement thatas psychologiststhe two brothers wereequally accomplished but in different fieldsThe field of William James was in the main the field of normal and of abnormal conscious psychologythe field of Henry James was the field of the sub consciousboth normal and abnormalThe difference to those who know what the terms meanis not only considerablebut it accounts entirely for the difference of method employed by the two brothers and evento a great extentfor the difference in their modes of lifeThe conscious can be studied by the scientist in the laboratorythe 42 The Little Review material ismoreoverlargely under his controland all the ordinary rules of scientific research apply to itBut the sub conscious is a shyer creature altogetherIt is not susceptible of direct observationit cannot be conjured up or laid at willit must be watchedattended uponand delicatelyoh most delicatelyobservedit entails a discipline of the imagination and of the sensesand a discipline of the mind of the observer who must beware of even so much as breathing in the presence of the subconscious subjectin a wordits study is much more an art than a scienceI am not suggesting that Henry James arrived by his method at any conclusions likely to be of value to the science of psychologyConclusions were not what he aimed athe aimedlike every authorat representationNoragainam I suggesting that Henry James held intellectually any theories on the sub consciousHe wasas it wereprofessionally inclusive and professional open mindedAt the same timeit would be possibleI holdto discover in the solution of his works quite definite conclusions and quite definite theories which the intellect might precipitate into the crystallised dust of formal definitionsBut why attempt it if Henry James himself did notWhy translate into terms of science a work of artWhy substitute for rcpresentai in mere definitionsOnlyif it be doneto convince his readers that they are really in the current of the most recent and the deepest thought of our dayFor the surprising thing about Henry James s novels is that one approaches them as stories and leaves them having assisted at a piece of lifeOne begins to read him as a diversion and finds at the end of him that one has had real experiencesHe isin factthe magician of psychologywho not only describes whoindeed does not describebut portraysbut revealsHe takes his readers through a new worldThis marvellous magical giftmoreoveris exercisedlike all true magicby the simplest of meansFor the most part Henry James s characters cannot be said to be selected for their extraordinariessnor had he the accessories of the stage magician for his propertiesQuite ordinary people in quite ordinary surroundings are sufficient for his purpose which is to show usnot the consciousbut the sub consciousin man There he seems to sayhaving placed his reader at a point of vantage for observation just observe and listen and hold your mind in readiness to catch the smallest gesture and the lightest toneThese persons you will noticeare not at the first glance anything out of the commonnor are they up to anything very unusualNeverthe The Little Review 43 lesswatch them and try to see and to feel what they are doing And as his readers look at the figures through Henry James s eyesthey are aware of a strange transformation in the ordinary people before themWhile still remaining ordinaryextraordinary manifestations begin to be visible among themThey arouse wonderthey arouse pitythey arouse admirationthey arouse horror or fearThere are few emotions they are not capable of producing under the wand of Henry JamesYetall the time I must insist upon it these people remain ordinarySuch an art of second sight as this was not likely to be confined to the merely incarnatedIf Henry James drew our attention to the sub consciousdoubleor psychic penumbra of living figureshe was almost certain in the end to present his figures as doubles without a bodyin a wordas ghostsAnd I was among the critics wholong before Henry James had written his Two Magics prophes ed that he would shortly be writing of shadows directlyNo student of his works can fail to observe how imperceptibly his method of dealing with real persons shades into his dealing with ghostsThere is a little more quietnessa little more mysterya little more holding of the breath in the process of observationbut fundamentally the method is the sameHis stories of the unembodied areI thinkthe flower of his artIn these Henry James rose to the perfection of his observationIn them he examined the sub consciousas it wereface to faceI have remarked on another occasion that Henry James would be happy among the deadfor he understood them while he was still livingBut let me supplement the remark here by the observation that Henry James did not commune with the disembodied alonebut aloud and in the hearing and in the experience of all his intended readersHis missionif I may use the word and grieve for itwas to act as a kind of Charon to ferry the understanding over the dark passage of the Styx and to show us that we are such stuff as ghosts are made of44 The Little Review IN MEMORY TSEliot HENRY JAMES has been dead for same timeThe current of English literature was not appreciably altered by his work during his lifetimeand James will probably continue to be regarded as the extraordinarily clever but neglig ble curiosityThe current hardly mattersit hardly matters that very few people will read JamesTheinfluenceof James hardly mattersto be influenced by a writed is to have a chance inspiration from himor to take what one wantsor to see things onehas overlookedthere will always be a few intelligent people to understand Jamesand to be understood by a few intelligent people is all the influence a man requiresWhat matters least of all is his place in such a Lord Mayor s show as MrChesterton s procession of Victorian LiteratureThe point to be made is that James has an importance which has nothing to do with what came before him or what may happen after himan importance which has been overlooked on both sides of the AtlanticI do not suppose that any one who is not an American can properly appreciate JamesJames s best American figures in the novelsin spite of their trim definite outlinesthe economy of strokeshave a fullness of existence and an external ramification of relationship which a European reader might not easily suspectThe Bellegarde familyfor instanceare merely good outline sketches by an intelligent foreignerwhen more is expected of themin the latter part of the storythey jerk themselves into only melodramatic violenceIn all appearance Tom Tristram is an even slighter sljtchEuropeans can recognize himthey have seen himknown himhave even penetrated the Occidental Clubbut no European has the Tom Tristram element in his compositionhas anything of Tristram from his first visit to the Louvre to his final remark that Paris is the only place where a white man can liveIt is the final perfection the consummation of an American to becomenot an Englishmanbut a European something which no born Europeanno person of any European nationalitycan becomeTom is one of the failuresone of nature s misfortunesin this processEven General PackardCPHatchand Miss Kitty Upjohn have a reality which Claire de Cintre missesNoemieof courseis perfectbut Noemie is a result of the intelligent eyeher existence is a triumph of the intelligenceand it does not extend beyond the frame of the pictureThe Little Review 45 For the English readermuch of James s criticism of America must merely be something taken for grantedEnglish readers can appreciate it for what it has in common with criticism everywherewith Flaubert in France and Turgenev in RussiaStillit should have for the English an importance beyond the work of these writersThere is no English equivalent for Jamesand at least he writes in this languageAs a criticno novelist in our language can approach Jamesthere is not even any large part of the reading public which knows what the wordcriticmeans The usual definition of a critic is a writer who cannotcreateperhaps a reviewer of books James was emphatically not a successful literary cniicHis criticism of books and writers is feebleIn writing of a novelisthe occasionally produces a valuable sentence out of his own experience rather than in judgment of the subjectThe rest is charming talkor gentle commendationEven in handling men whom he couldone supposeshave carved joint from jointEmersonor NortonT his touch is uncertainthere is a desire to be generousa political motivean admissionin dealing with American writersthat under the circumstances this was the best poss bleor that it has fine qualitiesHis father was here keener than heHenry was not a literary criticHe was a critic who preyed not upon ideasbut upon living beingsIt is criticism which is in a very high sense creativeThe charactersthe best of themare each a distinct success of creationDaisy Miller s small brother is one of theseDone in a clean flat drawingeach is extracted out of a reality of its ownsubstantial enougheverything given is true for that individualbut what is given is chosen with great art for its place in a general schemeThe general scheme is not one characternor a group of characters in a plot or merely in a crowdThe focus is a situationa relationan atmosphereto which the characters pay tributebut being allowed to give only what the writer wantsThe real heroin any of James s storiesis a social entity of which men and women are constituentsIt isin The Europeansthat particular conjunction of people at the Wentworth housea situation in which several memorable scenes are merely timeless partsonly occurring necessarily in successionIn this aspectyou can say that James is dramaticas what Pinero and MrJones used to do for a large publicJames does for the intelli 46 The Little Review gentIt is in the chemistry of these subtle substancesthese curious precipitates and explosive gases which are suddenly formed by the contact of mind with mindthat James is unequalledCompared with James sother novelistscharacters seem to be only accidentally in the same bookNaturallythere is something terribleas disconcerting as a quicksandin this discoverythough it only becomes absoluately dominant in such stories as The Turn of the ScrewIt is partly foretold in Hawthornebut James carried it much fartherAnd it makes the readeras well as the personaeuneasily the victim of a merciless clairvoyanceJames s critical genius comes out most tellingly in his mastery overhis baffling escape fromIdeasa mastery and an escape which are perhaps the last test of a superior intelligenceHe had a mind so fine that no idea could violate itEnglishmenwith their uncritical admirationin the present agefor Francelike to refer to France as the Home of Ideasa phrase whichif we could twist it into truthor at least a complimentought to mean that in France ideas are very severly looked afternot allowed to straybut preserved for the inpsection of civic pride in a Jardin des Plantesand frugally dispatched on occasions of public necessityEnglandon the other handif it is not the Home of Ideashas at ieast become infested with them in about the space of time within which Australia has been overrun by rabbitsIn England ideas run wild and pasture on the emotionsinstead of thinking with our feelingsa very different thingwe corrupt our feelings with ideaswe produce the politicalthe emotional ideaevading sensation and thoughtGeorge Merediththe disciple of Carlylewas fertile in ideashis epigrams are a facile substitute for observation and inferenceMrChesterton s brain swarms with ideasI see no evidence that it thinksJames in his novels is like the best French critics in maintaining a point of viewa view point untouched by the parasite ideaHe is the most intelligent man of his generationThe fact of being everywhere a foreigner was probably an assistance to his native witSince Byron and Landorno Englishman appears to have profited much from living abroadWe have had Birmingham seen from Chelseabut not Chelsea seenreally seenfrom Baden or RomeThere are advantagesindeedin coming from a large flat country which no one wants to visitadvantages which both Turgeney and James enjoyedThese advantages have not won them recognitionEuropeans have preferred to take their notion of the Russian from Dostoevski and their notion of the The Little Review 47 American fromlet us sayFrank Norris if not OHenryThusthey fail to note that there are many kinds of their fellowcountrymenand that most of these kindssimilarly to the kinds of their fellow countrymenare stupidlikewise with AmericansAmericans also have encouraged this fiction of a general typea formula or ideausually the predaceous square jawed or thinlippedThey like to be told that they are a race of commercial buccaneersIt gives them something easily escaped frommoreoverwhen they wish to reject AmericaThus the novels of Frank Norris have succeeded in both countriesthough it is curious that the most valuable part of The Pit is its satirequite unconscious I believeNorris was simply representing faithfully the life he knewof Chicago society after business hoursAll this show of commercialism which Americans like to present to the foreign eye James quietly waves asideand in pouncing upon his fellow countryman after the stock exchange has closedin tracking down his vices and absurdities across the Atlanticand exposing them in their highest flights of dignity or cultureJames may be guilty of what will seem to most Americans scandalously improper behaviourIt is too much to expect them to be gratefulAnd the British publichad it been more awarewould hardly have been more comfortable confronted with a smile which was so far from breaking into the British laughHenry James s deathif it had been more taken note ofshould have given considerable reliefon both sides of the Atlantic and cemented the Anglo American EntenteTHE HAWTHORNE ASPECT TSEliot MY OBJECT is not to discuss critically even one phase or period of Jamesbut merely to provide a noteBeitragetoward any attempt to determine his antecedentsaffiinitiesandplace Presumed that James s relation to Balzacto Turgenevto any one else on the continent is known and measured I refer to MrHueffer s book and to MrPound s article and presumed that his relation to the Victorian novel is negligibleit is not concluded that James was simply a clever young man who came to Europe and improved himselfbut that the soil of his origin contributed a flavour discriminible after transplantation in his latest fruitWe may even 48 The Little Review draw the instructive conclusion that this flavour was precisely improved and given its chancenot worked offby transplantationIf there is this strong native tastethere will probably be some relation to Hawthroneand if there is any relation to Hawthroncit will probably help us to analyse the flavour of which I speakWhen we say that James isAmerican we must mean that thisflavourof hisand also more exactly definable qualitiesare more or less diffused throughout the vast continent ratht r than anywhere elsebut we cannot mean that this flavour and these qualities have found literary expression throughout the nationor that they permeate the work of MrFrank Norris or MrBooth TarkingtonThe point is that James is positively a coutinuator of the New England geniusthat there is a New England geniuswhich ha discovered itself only in a very small number of people in the middle of the nineteenth century and which is not significantly present in the writings of Miss Sara Orne JewettMiss Eliza Whiteor the Bard of Appledore whose name I forgetI mean whatever we associate with certain purl eus of Bostonwith ConcordSalemand CambridgeMass notably EmersonThoreauHawthorne and LowellNone of these menwith the exception of Hawthorneis individually very importantthey all canand periiaps ought to be made to look very foolishbut there is asomethingtherea dignityabout Emerson for examplewhich persists after we have perceived the taint of commonness about some English contemporaryas for instance the more intelligentbetter educatedmore alert Matthew ArnoldOmitting such men as Bryant and Whittier as absolutely plebeianwe can still perceive this halo of dignity around the men I have namedand also LongfellowMargaret Fuller and her crewBancroft and Motleythe faces oflaterNorton and Child pleasantly shaded by the Harvard elmsOne distinguishing mark of this distinguished world was very certainly leisureand importantly not in all cases a leisure given by moneybut insisted uponThere seems no easy reason why Emerson or Thoreau or Hawthorne should have been men of leisureit seems odd that the New England conscience should have allowed them leisureyet they would have itsooner or laterThat is really one of the finest things about themand sets a bold frontier between them and a world which will at any price avoid leisurea world in which Theodore Roosevelt is a patron of the artsAn interesting documentof this latter world is the Letters of a nimbly dull poet of a younger generationof Henry James s generationRichard Watson GilderCivil Service ReformTenement House CemmisisonMunicipal PoliticsThe Little Review 49 Of course leisure in a metropoliswith a civilized societythe society of Boston was and is quite uncivilized but refined beyond the point of civilisationwith exchange of ideas and critical standards would have been betterbut these men could not provide the metropolisand were right in taking the leisure under possible conditionsPrecisely this leisurethis dignitythis literary aristocracythis unique character of a society in which the men of letters were also of the best peopleclings to Henry JamesIt is some consciousness of this kinship which makes him so tender and gentle in his appreciations of EmersonNorton and the beloved AmbassadorWith Hawthorneas much the most important of these people in any question of literary arthis relation is more personalbut no more in the case of Hawthorne than with any of the other figures of the background is there any consideration of influenceJames owes littlevery littleto anyonethere are certain writers whom he consciously studiedof whom Hawthorne was not onebut in any case his relation to Hawthorne is on another plane from his relation to Balzacfor exampleThe influence of Balzacnot on the whole a good influenceis perfectly evident in some of the earlier novelsthe influence of Turgenev is vaguerbut more usefulThat James wasat a certain periodmore moved by Balzacthat he followed him with more concentrated admirationis clear from the tone of his criticism of that writer compared with the tone of his criticism of either Turgenev or HawthorneIn French Poets and Noveliststhough an early workJames s attitude toward Balzac is exactly that of having been very much attracted from his orbitperhaps very wholesomely stimulated at an age when almost any foreign stimulus may be goodand having afterwards reacted from Balzacthough not to the point of injusticeHe handles Balzac shrewdly and fairlyFrom the essay on Turgenev there is on the other hand very little to be got but a touching sense of appreciationfrom the essay on Flaubert even lessThe charming study of Hawthorne is quite different from any of theseThe first conspicuous quality in it is tendernessthe tenderness of a man who had escaped too early from an environment to be warped or thwarted by it who had escaped so effectually that he could afford the gift of affectionAt the same time he places his fingernow and thenvery gentlyon some of Hawthorne s more serious defects as well as his limitations The best things comeas a general thingfrom the talents 50 The Little Review that are members of a groupevery man works better when he has companions working in the same lineand yielding the stimulus of suggestioncomparisonemulation Though when he says thatthere was manifestly a strain of generous indolence in hisHawthorne scompositionhe is understating the fault of laziness for which Hawthorne can chiefly be blamedBut gentleness is needed in criticising Hawthornea necessary thing to remember about whom is precisely the difficult fact that the soil which produced him with his essential flavour is the soil which producedjust as inevitablythe environment which stunted himIn one thing alone Hawthorne is more solid than Jameshe had a very acute historical senseHis erudition in the small field of American colonial history was extensiveand he made most fortunate use of itBoth men had that sense of the past which is peculiarly Americanbut in Hawthorne this sense exercised itself in a grip on the past itselfin James it is a sense of the senseThishoweverneed not be dwelt upon hereThe really vital thingin finding any personal kinship between Hawthorne and Jamesis what James touches lightly when he says thatthe fine thing in Hawthorne is that he cared for the deeper psychologyand thatin his wayhe tried to become familiar with it There are other points of resemblancenot directly included under thisbut this one is of the first importanceIt isin factalmost enough to ally the two novelistsin comparison with whom almost all others may be accused of either superficiality or aridityI am not saying that thisdeeper psychologyis essentialor that it can always be had without loss of other qualitiesor that a novel need be any the less a work of art without itIt is a definitionand it separates the two novelists at once from the English contemporaries of eitherNeither Dickens nor Thackeraycertainlyhad the smallest notion of thedeeper psychology George Eliot had a kind of heavy intellect for itTitobut all her genuine feeling went into the visual realism of Amos BartonOn the continent it is knownbut the method of Stendhal or of Flaubert is quite otherA situation is for Stendhal something deliberately constructedoften an illustrationThere is a bleakness about itvitalised by force rather than feelingand its presentation is definitely visualHawthorne and James have a kind of sensea receptive mediumwhich is not of sightNot that they fail to make you seeso far as necessarybut sight is not the essential The Little Review 51 senseThey perceive by antennaeand thedeeper psychologyis hereThe deeper psychology indeed led Hawthorne to some of his absurdest and most characteristic excessesit was for ever tailing off into the fancifuleven the allegoricalwhich is a lazy substitute for profundityThe fancifulness is thestrain of generous indolence the attempt to get the artistic effect by meretricious meansOn this side a critic might seize hold of The Turn oj the Screwa tale about which I have many doubtsbut the actual working out of this is different from Hawthorne sand we are not interested in approximation of the two men on the side of their weaknessThe point is that Hawthorne was acutely sensitive to the situationthat he did grasp character through the relation of two or more persons to each otherand this is what no one elseexcept Jameshas doneFurthermorehe does establishas James establishesa solid atmosphereand he doesin his quaint wayget New Englandas James gets a larger part of Americaand as none of their respective contemporaries get anything above a village or twoor a jungleComparewith anything that any English contemporary could dothe situation which Hawthorne sets up in the relation of Dimmesdale and Chilling worthJudge Pyncheon and CliffordHepzibah and Phoebeare similarly achieved by their relation to each otherCliffordfor onebeing simply the intersection of a relation to three other charactersThe only dimension in which Hawthorne could expand was the pasthis present being so narrowly barrenIt is a great pitywith his remarkable gift of observationthat the present did not offer him more to observeBut he is the one English writing predecessor of James whose characters are aware of each otherthe one whose novels were in any deep sense a criticism of even a slight civilizationand here is something more definite and closer than any derivation we can trace from Richardson or MarivauxThe fact that the sympathy with Hawthorne is most felt in the last of James s novelsThe Sense of the Pastmakes me the more certain of its genuinessIn the meantimeJames has been through a much more elaborate development than poor Hawthorne ever knewHawthornewith his very l mited culturewas not exposed to any bewildering variety of influencesJamesin his astonishing career of self improvementtouches Hawthorne most evidently at the beginning and end of his courseat the beginningsimply as a young New Englander of lettersat the endwith almost a gesture of approach Roderick Hudson is the novel of a clever and expanding young New Englanderimmaturebut just coming out to a self consciousness 54 The Little Review where Hawthorne never arrived at allCompared with Daisy Miller or The Europeans or The American its critical spirit is very crudeBut The Marble FaunTransformation the only European novel of Hawthorneis of Cimmerian opacitythe mind of its author was closed to new impressions though withli its Walter Scott Mysteries of Udolpho upholstery the old man does establish a kind of solid moral atmosphere which the young James does not getJames in Roderick Hudson does very little better with Rome than Hawthorneand as he confesses in the later prefacerather fails with Northampton He does in the later edition tone down the absurdities of Roderick s sculpture a littlethe pathetic Thirst and the gigantic AdamMrStriker remains a failurethe judgement of a young man consciously humourisingtoo suggestive of Martin ChuzzlewitThe generic resemblance to Hawthorne is in the occasional heavy facetiousness of the stylethe tedious whimsicality how different from the exactitude of The American Scenethe verbalismHe too much identifies himself with Rowlanddoes not see through the solemnity he has created in that charactercommits the cardinal sin of failing todetectone of his own charactersThe failure to create a situation is evidentwith Christina and Maryeach nicely adjustedbut never quite set in relation to each otherThe interest of the book for our present purpose is what he does not do in the Hawthorne wayin the instinctive attempt to get at something largerwhich will bring him to the same success with much besidesThe interest in thedeeper psychology the observationand the sense for situationdeveloped from book to bookculminate in The Sense of the Pastby no means saying that this is his bestuniting with other qualities both personal and racialJames s greatness is apparent both in his capacity for development as an artist and his capacity for keeping his mind alive to the changes in the world during twenty five yearsIt is remarkablefor the mastery of a span of American historythat the man who did the Wentworth family in the80s could do the Bradhams in the00sIn The Sense of the Past the Midmores belong to the same generation as the BradhamsRalph belongs to the same race as the Wentworthsindeed as Was Hawthorne at all in his mind hereIn criticising the House of the Seven Gables he saysit rendersto an initiated readerthe impression of a summer afternoon in an elm shaded New England town and in the preface to Roderick Hudson he sayswhat the early chapters of the book mostrenderto me today is not the umbrageous air of their New England town The Little Review 53 the PyncheonsCompare the book with The House of the Seven GablesHawthorne s best novel after all the situationtheshrinkage and extinction of a familyis rather more complexon the surfacethan James s withso far as the book was donefewer character relationsBut James s real situation hereto which Ralph s mounting the step is the keyas Hepzibah s opening of her shof is a situation of different states of mindJames s situation is the shrinkage and extinction of an ideaThe Pyncheon tragedy is simplethecurseupon the family a matter of

partial civilizationthe vugalr vital ty of the Midmores in their financial decay contrasted with the decay of Ralph in his financial prosperitywhen they precisely should have been the civilisation he had come to seekAll this watched over by the absentbut conscious AuroraI do not want to insist upon the Hawthorneness of the confrontation of the portraitthe importance of the opening of a doorWe need surely not insist that this book is the most importantmost substantial sort of thing that James didperhaps there is more solid wear even in that other unfinished Ivory TowerBut I consider that it was an excursion which we could well permit himafter a lifetime in which he had taken talents similiar to Hawthorne s and made them yield far greater returns than poor Hawthorne could harvest from his granite soila permissible exercisein which we may by a legitimately cognate fancy seem to detect Hawthorne coming to a mediumistic existence againto remind a younger and incredulous generation of what he really washad he had the opportunityand to attest his satisfaction that that opportunity had been given to JamesTHE NOTES ON NOVELISTS John Rodker THAT Henry James found time to produce these criticisms of contemporary writing in the leisure left by his other work is an equal mystery with Balzac s working day of fifteen hours and the twenty three hour or so day of Michael AngeloBut that his 54 The Little Review valuations should remain at the same time so just and so unlikely to be revised by posteritythat is a greater miracleIt is trueof course that James does not give away very much or let himself go too thoroughlybut that is the caution of age and experienceHe admires the spirit that could impel Zola to contemplate a serjes like the Rougon Macquartbut and little by little in his gentle way he wears away the whole scructure till nothing remainsThe end of his essay leaves a figurecrumbling rapidlywith perhaps an odd finger untouched by the rotWith Balzac too it is much the same thingO yesthe Comedie Uuvwinemost wonderfulinconceivable energybut really you knowcritics have said that three quarters of Balzac might quite well have been omitted Even his praiseinstead of enhancing the value of his subject serves only to depreciate it Every piece we handle is so full of stuffcondensed like the edibles provided for campaigns and explorationspositively so charged with distilled life that we find ourselves dropping it in certain states of sensibilityas we drop an object ungaurdedly touched that startles us by being animateWe seem really scarce to want anything to be so animate This is of course the complaint of a comprehensible godand one has heard it beforeBut what then does MrJames wantHe is pleased when he meetssaturationin the novels of MrWalpole andtoneis to him theJe ne sais quoithat makes for permanence and a colossal conception is entirely praiseworthy and awe inspiringbut Flaubert he treats with most sympathyand that presumably because each treated his subject in a somewhat similar mannerHe does not trouble here to point out felicitiesor to analyse influencesHis criticism in this case isen blocand his references to Flaubert s characters are entirely sympatheticBut what really excites Henry James is not the work as such but the prospect of the writer overwhelmed by his task like an ant with a large piece of stickgathering all its power to get the quarry homeJames sees the author in his librarywith Flauberton his bedgathering himself together for this altogether superhuman effortand then its painful accomplishmentThis is the point where our critic s control gives out He too claps with the audienceIndeed how could he refrain when it was himself he saw on that identical stageThe queer thing about these notes is that in the case of George Sand and Balzac time only confirms his judgmentas can be seen The Little Review 55 from the three articles on George Sand dated 1897 99 and 1914 and those on Balzac of 1902 and 1913The notes on George Sand leave the strongest impression on the readerprobably because her literature was more open to himLike all of usJames could not but love acause celebre and the interactions of George Sand upon her loversinteresting figures all of themcentuple the original interest which would have attached merely to her vicesJames seems to have found her a fascinating figureand indeed to any scholar the spectacle of one who lived so hard could not but be engrossingPhysiologically too it appears easier for a woman to expend herself prodigally in a way that nature will not permit manand this element of bizarrerie made her the more interestingFor the artist there appears to be a ratio between life and artThus life plus art equals 1this being the unit of permanenceOne could have Life as 1or Art as 1 or as complementary fractionsGeorge Sand who used practically the whole of her unit in living has yet made herself permanentthough her writing as such may very well soon be only of interest to bibliographers She lived with all her perceptions and in all her chambers not merely in the showroom of the shops This irrepressible energy for lifeso nearly akin to his own for literature makes him tell this story so appreciatively Prosper Merimee was said to have related that during a term with the author of Leliahe once opened his eyes in the raw winter dawn to see his companion in a dressing gownon her knees before the domestic heartha candle stick beside her and a red Madras round her headmaking bravely with her own hands the fire that was to enable her to sit down betimes to urgent pen and paper The storyit is saidchilled Merimee s ardour but only awakened that of Jameswho saw in it anafflatusso divine that he remained open mouthedMerimee probably felt it was a little indecent it probably struck him that she was about to chronicle all that had gone beforebefore the bloom was offBut that of course is the differenceFrom the studyher excesses may be forgiven her and faults in taste do not scandalise younger generationsAt home James was not on such sure groundHis article onThe New Novel although fairly adequate is I think emphasised wronglyHe gives Mr Wells his true valuewithout allowing a certain cheapness in the make up of his geniusof a kind without 56 The Little Review parallel in men of equal talentAnd the notes on MrCannan etc are exceedingly kindalthough his critical genius was at fault when he did not realise that MrDHLawrence was in a class apartand that if there is a future for the rhapsodical and lyrical novel it is in his handsTHE REVISED VERSION Theodora Bosanquet WHEN Henry James undertook to prepare his tales and novels for publication in the definitive edition he had cultivated the habit of forgetting past achievements almost to the pitch of sincere conviction that nothing of his produced before about 1890 could come with any credit through the ordeal of a critical inspectionHe consequently set about the business of re reading and selecting with two rare advantages unfamiliarity and an adverse prejudiceThe prejudice oftenhappilygave place to appreciation as the unfamiliarity passed into recognitionbut it must be clear to any reader of the prefaces to the New York edition that he never lost the sense that he was paternally responsible for two distinct familiesFor the earlier broodthe acknowledged fruit of his alliance with Romancehe claimed indulgence on the ground of their youthful spontaneitytheir confident assurancetheir rather touching good faithOne catches echoes of a plea that these elderly youngsters may not be too closely comparedto their inevitable disadvantagewith the richly endowedthe carefully bredthe highly civilised and sensitised children of his second marriage with ExperienceAttentive readers of the novels may find the distinction between these two groups less remarkable than it was to their writerThey may even wonder whether the second marriage was not a silver weddingwith the old romantic mistress cleverly disguised as a woman of the worldIt is quite possible that the different note struck so audibly for Henry James s ear by his later work may have been due more to his substitution of dictation for the use of pens and ink than to any change of heartThe interesting thing to notewhatever the reasonis that he found it necessary to do a great deal of work on the earlier tales before he considered them fit for appearance in the company of the later The Little Review 57 onesSome members of the elder family he entirely disownednot counting them worth the expense of the contemplated new clothesOthers he left in their place more from respect for the declared taste of his reading public than because he loved them for tneir own sakeIt wouldfor instancescarcely have been possible to exclude Daisy Miller from any representative collection of his workyet the popularity of the tale had been almost a grief to himTo be acclaimed as the author of Daisy Miller by persons blandly unconscious of The Wings of the Dove or The Golden Bowl was a reason among many for Henry James s despair of intelligent comprehensionHis feelings about Daisy resembled those of some grande dame possessing a jewel case richly stocked with glowing rubies and flashing diamondsbut condemned by her admirers always to appear in the simple string of moonstones worn at her first danceFrom the moment he began to read over the earlier tales he found himself involved in a highly practical examination of the scope and limits of permissible revisionPoetsas he pointed outhave frequently revised their verse with good effectWhy should novelists not have equal license The only sound reason for not altering anything is the conviction that it couldn t be improvedIt was Henry James s profound conviction that he could improve his early writing in nearly every sentenceNot to revise would have been to confess to a loss of faith in himself and it was unlikely that the writer who fasted for forty years in the wilderness of British and American misconceptions without yielding any scrap of intellectual honesty to editorial or publishing tempters should have lost fa th in himselfBut he was as fully aware of the limits of revision as he was of the scopeHe knew that no novelist can safely afford to repudiate h s fundamental understanding with his readers that the tale he has to tell is at least as true as history and the people he has set in motion at least as unalterable at a given moment as the people we see in offices and railway carriagesHe allowed himself few freedoms with actions or appearances already recordedwhich makes it worth our while to note one of these rare exceptionsa deliberate substitution in the second version of The AmericanOriginally the old Marquise de Bellegarde had acknowledged the introduction of Newman by returning his handshakewith a sort of British posUiveness which reminded him that she was the daughter of the Earl of StDunstan s On her crea The Little Review 58 tor s second thoughts that friendly gesture was refused Newman came sufficiently near to the old lady by the fire to take in that she would offer him no handshake Madame de Bellegarde looked hard at him and refused what she did refuse with a sort of British positiveness which reminded him that she was the daughter of the Earl of Samt Dunstans There were two good reasons why the Marquise should not have extended a welcoming hand to NewmanHer attitude was throughout to be consistently hostile and should never have been compromised by the significantly British gripand she had lived too long in her husband s country not to have adopted its views as to the uses of a lady s handNevertheless it is really shocking to see her revoking her very first card after playing it for so many yearsShe was to perform less credible actions than shaking hands with an intrusive Americanas her progenitor was awareHe invited his readersin the preface to The Americanto observe the impossible behaviour of the noble Bellegarde familybut he recogmsed that since they had been begotten in absurdity the Bellegardes could under no stress of revision achieve a very solid humanityThe best he could do for them was to let a faint consciousness flush the mind of Valentinthe only perceptive meYnber of the familyIn the first edition Valentin warned his American friend of the Bellegarde peculiarities with the easy good faith of the younger Henry James My mother is strangemy brother is strangeand I verily believe I am stranger than eitherOld trees have crooked branchesold houses have queer cracksold races have odd secrets To this statement he added in the revised version We re fit for a museum or a Balzac novel A similar growth of ironic perception was allowed to Roderick Hudsonwhose comment on Rowland s admission of heroically concealed passion for Mary Garland It s like something in a novel was altered toIt s like something in a bad novel But the real business of revision wasfor Henry Jamesneither substitution nor rearrangementIt was the demonstration of values implicit in his early workthe retrieval of countless lost opportunities for adequatelyrendering It was he remarked all sensiblyas if the clear matter being still thereeven as a shining expanse of snow spread over a plainmy exploring treadfor application to ithad quite unlearned the old pace and found itself naturally falling into anotherwhich might sometimes indeed more or less agree with the original tracksbut might most oftenor very nearlybreak the The Little Review 59 surface in other placesWhat was thus predominantly interesting to noteat all eventswas the high spontaneity of these deviations and differenceswhich became thus things not of choicebut of immediate and perfect necessitynecessity to the end of dealing with the quantities in question at allThe act of revision he explained in the same prefaceto The Golden Bowl the act of seeing it againcaused whatever I looked at on any page to flower before me as into the only terms that honourably expressed itand therevisedelement in the present Edition is accordingly these termsthese rigid conditions of re perusalregisteredso many close notesas who should sayon the particular vision of the matter itself that experience had at last made the only possible one It will be noticed that there is no lack of confidence in these wordsThe man of literary geniusin secure possession of hisfaculties did not bother himself with doubts as to his ability to write better at the end of a lifetime of hard work and varied experience than at the beginningHe knew that he could write betterIt is true that the case for the revised version cannot rest on its greater eleganceIt is not so simple or so smooth oron the wholeso pretty as the older formBut it is nearly always richer and more aliveHenry James was more concerned to give the sense of an emotional tension than to sketch a pretty pictureTruth was dearer to him than a smooth surface and accurate registration of each perceived tone more valuable than a selection of harmoniesIn the later version early abstractions give place to sharp definite imagesloose vague phrases to close locked intensities of meaningAs a sample of the kind of thing he was trying to do one may take the changes in a sentence in The Madonna of the Futurea tale first published in 1879This is the original form His professionssomehowwere all half professionsand his allusions to his work and circumstances left something dimly ambiguous in the background In the New York edition it has become His professions were practicallysomehowall masks and screensand his personal allusionsas to his ambiguous backgroundmere wavings of the dim lantern It would be easy to pick out passages where the gain in verbal beauty has been as striking as the gain in expressionThere is a passage forming part of the fine account of Newman s silent renunciationin the cathedral of Notre Dameof his meditated revengeIn the old edition it runs He sat a long timehe heard far away bells chiming offat long intervalsto the rest of the worldHe was very tired this was the best place he could be in This was transformed to60 The Little ReviewHe sat a long timehe heard far away bells chiming off into spaceat long intervalsthe big bronze syllables of the WordHe was very tiredbut such a place was a kingdom of rest It wouldof coursebe equally easy to select examples of prettiness sacrificed to sincerity and the rhythm of a sentence destroyed by qualifying clausesjust as one might set against the gain in vigour introduced by idiom and abbreviation into the dialogue the loss in verisimilitude due to adverbial interpositionsI propose to quotethereforean extract of sufficient length to give the general sense of the revisionThe passage is taken from Four Meetingsa work which was revised with extreme careHere is the earlier versionThe relater of the tale is showing a book of photographs of places in Europe to the little New England spinsterCaroline SpencerThey have just come upon a representation of the Castle of ChillonShe looked awhileand then she asked if it was not where Donivardabout whom Byron wrotewas confinedI assentedand tried to quote some of Byron s versesbut in this attempt I succeeded imperfectlyShe fanned herself a moment and then repeated the lines corrctlyin a softflat and yet agreeable voiceBy the time she had finishedshe was blushingI complimented her and told her she was perfectly equipped for visiting Switzerland and ItalyShe looked at me askance againto see whether I was seriousand I addedthat if she wished to recognise Byron s descriptions she must go abroad speedilyEurope was getting sadly dis Byronised How soon mustI goshe asked OhI will give you ten yearsI think I can go within ten years she answered very soberly Well I said you will enjoy it immenselyyou will find it very charming The new version runsShe looked a while and then asked if it weren t where Bonivardabout whom Byron wrotehad been confinedI assentedtrying to quote Byron s versesbut not quite bringing it offShe fanned herself a moment and then repeated the lines correctlyin a soft flat voice but with charming convictionBy the time she had finishedshe was neverthless blushingI complimented her and assured her she was perfectly equipped for visiting Switzerland and ItalyShe looked at me askance againto see if I might be seriousand I added that if she wished to The Little Review 61 recognise Byron s descriptions she must go abroad speedily Europe was getting sadly dis Byronised How soon must I goshe thereupon enquired Oh I ll give you ten yearsWellI guess I can go in that time she answered as if measuring her words Then you ll enjoy it immensely I said you ll find it of the highest interest I quote another passage from the finalmeeting at which the indignant narrator watches Caroline ministering to the vulgar French cocotte who has imposed herself on her hospitality as the widow of a graceless American cousinThe cousin had previously stripped the innocent little New Englanderat the moment of her disembarkation on European soilof all her gathered savingsHis relict is not likely to allow of any further sums being scraped together by her unfortunate hostessAt this moment Caroline Spencer came out of the housebearing a coffee pot on a little trayI noticed that on her way from the door to the table she gave me a single quickvaguely appealing glanceI wondered what it signifiedI felt that it

artists among men of letters have occasionally and by tradition burst into an Ars Poetica or an Arte nuevo de hacer Comediasand it should come as no surprise that Henry James has left us some sort of treatise on novel writing no surprisethat isto the discriminating reader who is notfor the most parta writer of English novelsVarious reviewers have hinted obscurely that some such treatise is either adumbrated or concealed in the Notes for The Ivory Tower and for The Sense of the Pastthey have Recast from an article in The FutureThe Little Review 63 saidindeedthat novelists willprofit greatly etc
