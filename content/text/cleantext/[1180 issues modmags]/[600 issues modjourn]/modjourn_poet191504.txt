we share This love remain aware Beyond our happy breathing of the air How shall it be fulfilled and perfected  If you were dead How then should I be comforted But Celia knew instead He who takes comfort here shall find it there A halo gathered round her hair  I looked and saw her wisdom bare  The living bosom of the countless dead   And there  I laid my head   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Again when Celia laughed I doubted her and said Life must be led In many ways more difficult to see Than this immediate way For you and me We stand together on our lake s edge and the mystery Of love has made us one as day is made of night and night of  day Conscious of one identity Within each other we can say I love you all that you are We are uplifted till we touch a star We know that overhead Is nothing more austere more starry or more deep to under  stand Than is our union human hand in hand But over our lake come strangers a crowded launch  a lonely sailing boy A mile away a train bends by In every car Strangers are travelling each with particular And unkind preference like ours with privacy Of understanding with especial joy Like ours Celia Celia why should there be Distrust between ourselves and them disunity How careful we have been To trim this little circle that we tread To set a bar To strangers and forbid them Are they not as we   The New World  Our very likeness and our nearest kin How can we shut them out and let stars in  She looked along the lake And when I heard her speak The sun fell on the boy s white sail and on her cheek I touch them all through you she said I cannot know  them now Deeply and truly as my very own except through you Except through one or two Interpreters But not a moment stirs Here between us binding and interweaving us That does not bind these others to our care  The sunlight fell in glory on her hair And then said Celia laughing when I held her near They who take comfort there shall find it here  So when the sun stood sharp that day Behind the shadowy firs This poem came to me to say My word and hers Record it all said Celia more than merely this More than the shine of sunset on our heads more than a kiss More than our rapt agreement and delight Watching the mountain mingle with the night Tell that the love of two incurs   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The love of multitudes makes way And welcome for them as a solitary star Brings on the great array Go make a calendar She said immortalize this day  II  A stranger might be God the Hindus cry But Celia says importunate The stranger must be God and you and I  III  Once in a smoking car I saw a scene That made my blood stand still The sun was smouldering in a great ravine And I with elbow on the window sill Was watching the dim ember of the west When hushed and low but poignant as a bell For fire there came a moan the voice of one in hell  Across the car were two young men French by their look and brothers Unhappy men who had been happy boys And one was moaning on the other s breast His face was hid away I could not tell What words he said half English and half French I only  knew   The New World  Both men were suffering not one but two And then that face came into view Gaunt and unshaved with shadows and wild eyes A face of madness and of desolation And his cries For all his mate could do Rang out a shrill unearthly noise And tears ran down the stubble of his cheek  The other face was younger clean and sad With the manful stricken beauty of a lad Who had intended always to be glad The touch of his compassion like a mother s Guarded the madman soothed him and caressed And then I heard him speak  Mon frère mon frère Calme toi Right here s your place And opening his coat he pressed Upon his heart the poor wet face And smoothed the tangled hair  After a peaceful moment there The maniac screamed struck out and fell Across his brother s arm Love could not quell His fury Wrists together high in air He rose and with a yell Brought down his handcuffs toward the upturned face Then paused then knelt and then that sound that moan Of one forsaken and alone   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Seigneur le créateur du ciel et de la terre Forgotten me forgotten me And then the voice grew weak The brother leaned to ease the huddled body But a shriek Repulsed him Non Détache moi I don t care For you Non Tu es l homme qui m a trahi Non Tu n es pas mon frère  But as often as that mind would fill With the great anguish and the rush of hate The boy his young eyes older older Would curve his shoulder To the other s pain and bind Their hearts again and say Oh wait You ll know me better by and by Mon pauvre petit be still Right here s your place  The seeing gleam the blinded stare The cry Non tu n es pas mon frère  I saw myself myself as blind As he For something smothers My reason And I do not know my brothers But every day declare Non tu n es pas mon frère The New World  IV  I know a fellow in a steel mill who intent Upon his labors and his happiness had meant In his own wisdom to be blest Had made his own unaided way To schooling opportunity Success And then he loved and married And his bride After a brief year died I went to him to see If I might comfort him The comfort came to me  David I said under the temporary ache There is unwonted nearness with the dead I felt his two hands take The sentence from me with a grip Forged in the mills He told me that his tears were shed Before her breath went After that instead Of grief she came herself He felt her slip Into his being like a miracle her lip Whispering on his to slake His need of her And in the night I wake With wonder and I find my bride And her embrace there in our bed Within my very being not outside  We have each other more much more He said now than before   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This very moment while I shake Your hand my friend She welcomes you as well as I And laughs with me because I cried For her People would think me crazy if I told But something in what you said made me bold To let you meet my bride  It was not madness David s eye Was clear and open seeing His life Had seen in his young wife As mine had seen when Celia died The secret of God s being  V  Celia perhaps the few Whom I shall tell of you Will see with me your beauty who are dead Will hear with me your voice and what it said  Witter Bynner   VENUS TRANSIENS  Tell me Was Venus more beautiful Than you are When she topped The crinkled waves Drifting shoreward On her plaited shell Was Botticelli s vision Fairer than mine And were the painted rosebuds He tossed his lady Of better worth  Than the words I blow about you To cover your too great loveliness As with a gauze Of misted silver  For me You stand poised In the blue and buoyant air Cinctured by bright winds Treading the sunlight And the waves which precede you Ripple and stir The sands at my feet   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SOLITAIRE  When night drifts along the streets of the city And sifts down between the uneven roofs My mind begins to peek and peer It plays at ball in old blue Chinese gardens And shakes wrought dice cups in Pagan temples Amid the broken flutings of white pillars It dances with purple and yellow crocuses in its hair And its feet shine as they flutter over drenched grasses How light and laughing my mind is When all the good folk have put out their bed room candles And the city is still  RED SLIPPERS  Red slippers in a shop window and outside in the street flaws of gray windy sleet  Behind the polished glass the slippers hang in long threads of red festooning from the ceiling like stalactites of blood flooding the eyes of passers by with dripping color jamming their crimson reflections against the windows of cabs and tram cars screaming their claret and salmon into the teeth of the sleet plopping their little round maroon lights upon the tops of umbrellas   Red Slippers  The row of white sparkling shop fronts is gashed and bleeding it bleeds red slippers They spout under the electric light fluid and fluctuating a hot rain and freeze again to red slippers myriadly multiplied in the mirror side of the window  They balance upon arched insteps like springing bridges of crimson lacquer they swing up over curved heels like whirling tanagers sucked in a wind pocket they flatten out heelless like July ponds flared and burnished by red rockets  Snap snap they are cracker sparks of scarlet in the white monotonous block of shops  They plunge the clangor of billions of vermilion trumpets into the crowd outside and echo in faint rose over the pavement  People hurry by for these are only shoes and in a window farther down is a big lotus bud of cardboard whose petals open every few minutes and reveal a wax doll with staring bead eyes and flaxen hair lolling awkwardly in its flower chair  One has often seen shoes but whoever saw a cardboard lotus bud before  The flaws of gray windy sleet beat on the shop window where there are only red slippers  Amy Lowell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  OUR DAILY BREAD  On the Hunger Parade of the unemployed Chicago January 17th 1915  Give us this day our daily bread  Give us our right the hungry said  Walking along the darkening way  Give us our daily bread we say  Hark to the tread of the sullen feet Marching down the sleety street Hunger staggers along the way Give us our bread and work today  Swaying banners overhead  Give us this day our daily bread Masses of men and women throng Living witness of living wrong  Work not charity is the cry Is it sincere I know not I  What can I give but some small dole But will that satisfy my soul  Buffeting through the wind and the rain They will pass again and again   Our Daily Bread  Menacing all who are sleek and fed Give or we ll take our daily bread  Reads like a story of long ago Driven by want driven by woe Peasants arose and began to slay But it all happened yesterday  Reads like a tale from some far off land Countries we do

When the Earth king came to woo her Long after the Earth was one Queen Phlargis in Mars Planet Had treatied with the Sun  She had riven the ice forever Out of the Sirens Sea Had bridged the Hyberborean And raised sky towers three   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  At the door of her frozen palace Her heart was made as fire And she fled through many races To the lands of broad Argyre  Harold through all Arabia Followed the flying Queen By the sands of Thimiamata By Gehon s gardens green  In the City of Many Mountains Twixt the Sun Lake and Bay of Dawn Their armies still invisible Their souls together drawn  They greatly grew in stature  They joined their royal hands And the Earth s little ball became a thrall To the sway of mightier lands  But they in the far Phaetontis Above the Sirens Sea Stilled in music and marble Forgot the things to be  E Preston Dargan   ON FIRST LOOKING INTO THE MANUSCRIPT OF ENDYMION  In Mr Morgan s Library  I dared not dream that this dream had come true That I was bending over that yellow page Lit with his words our boy our poet our sage  And that I touched the parchment old yet new  Whereon his fingers once had been I grew Strangely afraid as if some heritage Of wonder from a distant holy age  Had suddenly fallen on me like soft dew  A thing of beauty is a joy forever  There I read his lovely line what time I dipped Into that hushed and haunted manuscript  That love and time have made even lovelier Oh I could only dream yea dream and weep Was it a vision Did I wake or sleep  Charles Hanson Towne   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NINETEEN FOURTEEN  PEACE  Now God be thanked who has matched us with his hour And caught our youth and wakened us from sleeping With hand made sure clear eye and sharpened power T o turn as swimmers into cleanness leaping Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary Leave the sick hearts that honor could not move And half men and their dirty songs and dreary And all the little emptiness of love Oh we who have known shame we have found release there Where there s no ill no grief but sleep has mending Naught broken save this body lost but breath Nothing to shake the laughing heart s long peace there But only agony and that has ending And the worst friend and enemy is but Death  TH E DEAD  These hearts were woven of human joys and cares Washed marvellously with sorrow swift to mirth The years had given them kindness Dawn was theirs And sunset and the colors of the earth These had seen movement and heard music known Slumber and waking loved gone proudly friended   The Soldier  Felt the quick stir of wonder sat alone  Touched flowers and furs and cheeks All this is ended There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter And lit by the rich skies all day And after  Frost with a gesture stays the waves that dance And wandering loveliness He leaves a white Unbroken glory a gathered radiance A width a shining peace under the night  TH E SOLDIER  If I should die think only this of me That there s some corner of a foreign field That is for ever England There shall be In that rich earth a richer dust concealed A dust whom England bore shaped made aware Gave once her flowers to love her ways to roam A body of England s breathing English air Washed by the rivers blest by suns of home And think this heart all evil shed away A pulse in the eternal mind no less Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given Her sights and sounds dreams happy as her day And laughter learnt of friends and gentleness In hearts at peace under an English heaven  Rupert Brooke   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE BIRD AND THE TREE  Blackbird blackbird in the cage There s something wrong tonight Far off the sheriff s footfall dies The minutes crawl like last year s flies Between the bars and like an age The hours are long tonight  The sky is like a heavy lid Out here beyond the door tonight What s that A mutter down the street What s that The sound of yells and feet For what you didn t do or did You ll pay the score tonight  No use to reek with reddened sweat No use to whimper and to sweat They ve got the rope they ve got the guns They ve got the courage and the guns And that s the reason why tonight No use to ask them any more They ll fire the answer through the door You re out to die tonight  There where the lonely cross road lies There is no place to make replies   The Bird and the Tree  But silence inch by inch is there And the right limb for a lynch is there And a lean daw waits for both your eyes Blackbird  Perhaps you ll meet again some place Look for the mask upon the face That s the way you ll know them there A white mask to hide the face And you can halt and show them there The things that they are deaf to now And they can tell you what they meant To wash the blood with blood But how If you are innocent  Blackbird singer blackbird mute They choked the seed you might have found Out of a thorny field you go For you it may be better so And leave the sowers of the ground To eat the harvest of the fruit Blackbird  Ridgely Torrence   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TH E WAYFARER  I  There is no glory of the sunset here Heavy the clouds upon the darkening road And heavy too the wind upon the trees The trees sway making moan Continuous like breaking seas O impotent bare things You give at last the very cry of Earth I walk this darkening road in solemn mood Within deep hell came Dante to a wood Like him I marvel at the crying trees  II  Christ by thine own darkened hour Live within me heart and brain Let my hands not slip the rein  Ah how long ago it is Since a comrade went with me Now a moment let me see  Thyself lonely in the dark Perfect without wound or mark   The Wayfarer  III  To morrow I will bend the bow My soul shall have her mark again My bosom feel the archer s strain No longer pacing to and fro With idle hands and listless brain As goes the arrow forth I go My soul shall have her mark again My bosom feel the archer s strain To morrow I will bend the bow  IV  The drivers in the sunset race Their coal carts over cobble stones Not draymen but triumphators Their bags are left with Smith and Jones They let their horses take their stride Which toss their forelocks in their pride Nor blue nor green these factions wear Which make career o er Dublin stones But Pluto his own livery Is what each whip carrier owns The Caesar of the cab rank I Salute the triumph speeding by  Padraic Colum   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IN THE ORCHESTRA  He d played each night for months and never heard A single tinkly tune or caught a word Of all the silly songs and sillier jests And he d seen nothing even in the rests Of that huge audience piled from floor to ceiling Whose stacked white faces sent his dazed wits reeling He d been too happy and had other things To think of while he scraped his fiddle strings   But now he d nothing left to think about Nothing he dared to think of   In and out The hollow fiddle of his head the notes Jingled and jangled and the raucous throats Of every star rasped jibes into his ear Each separate syllable precise and clear As though twere life or death if he should miss A single cackle crow or quack or hiss Of cockadoodling fools   A week ago He d sat beside her bed and heard her low Dear voice talk softly of her hopes and fears Their hopes and fears and every afternoon He d watched her lying there   A fat buffoon In crimson trousers prancing strut and cluck   In the Orchestra  Cackling A fellow never knows his luck He never knows his luck he never knows His luck  And in and out the old gag goes Of either ear and in and out again Playing at You can t catch me through his brain Er knows his luck   How well they thought they knew Their luck and such a short while since they two Together Life was lucky and twas good Then to be fiddling for a livelihood His livelihood and hers   A woman sang With grinning teeth The whole house rocked and rang In the whole house there was no empty place And there were grinning teeth in every face Of all those faces grinning tier on tier From orchestra to ceiling chandelier That caught in every prism a grinning light As from the little black box up a height The changing limelight streamed down on the stage And he was filled with reasonless dull rage To see those grinning teeth those grinning rows And wondered if those lips would never close But gape forever through an endless night Grinning and mowing in the green limelight  And now they seemed to grin in mockery Of him and then as he turned suddenly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To face them flaming it was his own face That mowed and grinned at him from every place Grimacing on him with the set white grin Of his own misery through that dazzling din Yet all the while he hadn t raised his head But fiddled fiddled for his daily bread His livelihood no longer hers   And now He heard no more the racket and the row Nor saw the aching glittering glare nor smelt The smother of hot breaths and smoke but felt A wet wind on his face   He sails again Home with her up the river in the rain Leaving the gray domes and gray colonnades Of Greenwich in their wake as daylight fades By huge dark cavernous wharves with flaring lights Warehouses built for some mad London night s Fantastic entertainment grimmer far Than Bagdad dreamt of monstrous and bizarre They loom against the night and seem to hold Preposterous secrets horrible and old Behind black doors and windows  Yet even they Make magic with more mystery the way As hand in hand they sail through the blue gloam Up the old river of enchantment home    In the Orchestra  He heard strange strangled voices he alone Once more like voices through the telephone Thin and unreal inarticulate Twanging and clucking at terrific rate Pattering pattering   And again aware He grew of all the racket and the glare Aware again of the antic strut and cluck And there was poor old Never know his luck Doing another turn yet not a smile Although he d changed his trousers and his style The same old trousers and the same old wheeze Was what the audience liked He tried to please And knew he failed and suddenly turned old Before those circling faces glum and cold A fat old man with cracked voice piping thin Trying to make those wooden faces grin With franctic kicks and desperate wagging head To win the applause that meant his daily bread Gagging and prancing for a livelihood His daily bread   God how he understood He d fiddled for their livelihood for her And for the one who never came   A stir Upon the stage and now another turn The old star guttered out too old to burn   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And he remembered she had liked the chap When she d been there that night He d seen her clap Laughing so merrily She liked it all The razzle dazzle of the music hall And laughing faces said she liked to see Hardworking people laughing heartily After the day s work She liked everything His playing even Snap another string The third  And she d been happy in that place Seeing a friendly face in every face That was her way the whole world was her friend And she d been happy happy to the end As happy as the day was long  And he Fiddled on dreaming of her quietly  Wilfrid Wilson Gibson  COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  THE SHAKESPEAREAN MOTIVE  PROPOS of the statuesquely beautiful Hamlet  of Sir Johnstone Forbes Robertson a few  of us were discussing recently the Shakes  pearean motive The littleness of man his  inadequacy his inefficiency this seems to have haunted Shakespeare s imagination Man s impotence to will to do to achieve in spite of intellect beauty charm goodness in spite of all qualities which should make him powerful the poet is haunted by this theme he rings the changes on it in all the great tragedies and pursues it in many of the comedies Apparently he searched history and human life in vain as Nietzsche did for the throned and sceptred figure of the man of power Not finding him in either Plutarch or Holinshed or among Queen Elizabeth s courtiers and freebooters he presented again and again as the supreme tragedy of life the pathetic figure of the weak man in a great place Power unused or inadequately or criminally used was the universal spectacle on a chance blown planet the one central cause of all our woe for Shakespeare as for Nietzsche But the German poet prophet living after Darwin would not despair of his hero Non existent today the man of power might yet be evolved So he set up before the mind s eye of the struggling race that ideal of the super man which has already thrilled his people like   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  some ichor from the table of dead war gods and sent them forth to conquer the world  Apparently Shakespeare did not believe that the race could ever produce the efficient man for him it was not in the stars Again and again he balks at the hero he turns his back on Edward III and his warrior son and makes of Henry V a picturesque stage monarch a royal bravo with a Prince Hal past created as an attempt to satisfy the red blood British patriotism of his day and his Caesar is a pitiful weakling who gives the lie to history and proves the poet s lack of faith in man s power to play a god like role  With what infinite variety what deep tenderness of love and pity Shakespeare studied human inadequacy revealed human littleness almost any of the plays may bear witness But his favorite version of the theme as pre eminently in Hamlet is the man on a throne or near it who cannot answer the summons of ironic destiny to be a leader a ruler the man who can see all around a deed divining motives and consequences yet who is powerless to prepare it and do it powerless to act except on impulse Again and again he found this inadequate king in Holinshed and the other chroniclers in John Richard III Henry IV Henry VIII he read him as the half great foiled by his own lusts or ambitions his muddled thought or misty vision in Henry VI he was the well meaning self baffled theorist motionless on a tumbling throne and in Richard II he was the artist the poet absorbed in creating a refuge of beauty away from the mud stained blood splashed world   The Shakespearean Motive  No doubt Mr Frank Harris is right in thinking that Shakespeare was studying himself in his over intellectualized weak willed heroes though he rides his hobby to death when he argues that because Lear is mad the poet must himself have suffered insanity His own inadequacy for action this was the tragedy Shakespeare knew best the tragedy which in the Sonnets humiliates him to the dust and poisons his pride of intellect His imagination searching the crowd and history and legend as well for his own kind as we all do found self foiled lovers dreamers seers in Richard II Macbeth Antony Hamlet Lear as well as in a host of lesser characters from Orsino to Prospero  And he was merciless with himself for having probed to the secret source of his own inefficiency he set it on a throne for all to see He placed it where immediate and decisive action was continually required as the final fruit of noble and developed character and showed how without that all subtlety of thought fire of passion desire of beauty intuition of truth became the source of chaos and confusion and ended in blood and ashes  Usually the poet drives his lesson home at the end of the play by leaving lesser men second rate in everything but will to obliterate the hideous waste of life and restore the order of the world as when Fortinbras takes the dead Hamlet s throne Apparently he set a higher value on this power of action which he had not than on all the dreams and visions of his poet heroes their audacity of intellect their unfailing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  beauty of speech their tenderness and loving kindness their heroic desires and ideals  The weak man in a great place the tragedy is re enacted every day If John D Rockefeller Jr had been an all round adequate man of action would the Colorado strike situation have dragged along through weeks of horror If William of Germany were more the king and less the stage player at kingcraft would Europe be at war today  H M  MISS LOWELL S DISCOVERY POLYPHONIC PROSE  During the past year something has happened in the sphere of the arts quite as important in my opinion as the European war in the sphere of politics and international relationships or the discovery of radium in that of science A new poetic form equal if not superior in value to vers libre has made its appearance in English The discoverer is a woman Had it been a man we should probably all have heard by now of the richness of the find Since there seems to be some danger that only a few will appreciate its significance I venture to draw the public attention to it  I do this the more willingly because in her preface to Sword blades and Poppy Seed Miss Amy Lowell who is the true discoverer of this form has modestly and mistakenly stated that it is not altogether her own invention but was first employed by a French poet Paul Fort Now for the uninitiated I may say that M Fort is a poet who possesses great facility in writing the alexandrine the French   Miss Lowell s Discovery  classic metre Unsatisfied with the chill regularity of this measure he has attempted to fit it to his temperament which is that of an improvisatore or ballad singer by interspersing his poems with bits of prose whenever his rhyme invention flags He thus gains a lightness swiftness and spontaneity of effect which have made him extremely popular among younger French poets This popularity might have been greater had M Fort printed his work as poetry interspersed with prose Instead he has chosen to print it as if it were prose alone leaving the reader to determine the movement of the rhythm and the division into lines  Upon this purely typographical device in M Fort Miss Lowell s imagination fastened itself She is almost unique among present day poets in possessing the ability of writing equally well in rhymed metre and in vers libre She has practiced her art long enough to understand that the really great poetry which will survive depends upon its sound quality and its substance quality upon its appeal to the ear as well as to the eye It seemed to her that there must be some way of fusing together Unrhymed vers libre and rhymed metrical patterns giving the rich decorative quality of the one and the powerful conciseness of statement of the other In short she was seeking some means whereby she might free herself and other poets after her from a constant and dogmatic adherence to a single metre throughout a single poem In this respect she was acting as the successor of Coleridge Keats Poe who spent their lives trying to make English metre more flexible to   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  mood and richer in sound effect In M Fort s work she  found a gleam of suggestion to this end  Miss Lowell had scarcely begun her attempt to follow Paul Fort before she realized that what she was doing consisted not so much in adapting a French form as in creating a new English one For one thing she was faced at the outset by the fact that the English language since the break up of blank verse has no form which is standard like the French alexandrine She found it possible to vary the rhythm and metre of these strange new poems of hers almost at will following the inner emotion of the thing she had to say Swift flowing metrical passages might be succeeded by vers libre recitatives connecting links of prose could be used as a relief to the ear and to lead up to some new metrical passage and so on In short here was the opportunity long sought of displaying within the limits of a single poem all the resources of her art  In my opinion Miss Lowell has in her latest examples of this peculiar form resolved in a great measure the difficulties which confront all English poets who attempt to say something new today The quandary which faces the earnest creator of poetry in the English speaking countries is that while he has at his disposal in the English language the most superb instrument of sense and sound ever forged he is utterly prevented from making use of its resources by the beggarly poverty of certain rhymes and metres which have been worn threadbare by generation after generation of poets who could find no satisfying means of escape from them What hope   Miss Lowell s Discovery  then is there for the young poet who feels he has a new music to express when the only recognized means of expressing it has been developed to its utmost capacity over three hundred years ago He is like a man who would try to play Richard Strauss or Debussy or any of the modern composers on a harpsichord  It is true that a few brave young spirits have tried to face this difficulty and to rid themselves of it by writing exclusively in an old form called vers libre which is dependent on cadence and not on rhyme or metrical pattern But a critical examination of the work of the best of these young poets Aldington H D Flint Pound proves that their attempt has not been altogether successful The art of poetry demands as great a mastery of sound quality as of substance quality Intense and concise grasp of substance is not enough the ear instinctively demands that this bare skeleton be clothed fittingly with all the beautiful and subtle orchestral qualities of assonance alliteration rhyme and return  This orchestral quality Miss Lowell has developed to the utmost Therefore it seems fitting that a new name should be given to these poems of hers which printed as prose or as prose and verse interspersed display all the colors of the chromatic palette The title that fits them best is that of Polyphonic Prose Here are the Beethoven symphonies the Bach fugues the César Franck chorales of poetry It is an art most difficult of attainment and not easy of appreciation But it has come to English poetry and its effect will be lasting and unmistakable   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Toscanelli drew a chart but it needed a Columbus to make the voyage Just so Miss Lowell with happy and characteristic daring has essayed her voyage and has found a new poetic continent in place of M Fort s France to which she at first thought she was steering It is the old story of Whistler and the Japanese print over again While a few connoisseurs scarcely dared to admire Japanese prints in secret Whistler boldly made them the basis of a new art Some day people will probably be saying that Miss Lowell was quite as important a figure for American art as Whistler That is always America s little way of doing things While Europe is jawing and the American public remains supremely indifferent some cheeky Yankee goes out and gets a thing done without anyone taking notice  John Gould Fletcher  REVIEWS  Arrows in the Gale by Arturo Giovannitti Introduction by  Helen Keller Hillacre Bookhouse Riverside Conn  We Anglo Saxon Americans are only vaguely aware that the nation so firmly founded on Plymouth Rock is slipping off that ancestral vantage ground as surely in race as in creed And still more vaguely do we appreciate the insidious advance of various European even oriental cultures or kulturs upon the stronghold of our inherited English traditions How long will it be before some Garibaldi or Kosciusko or Epaminondas ascends the chair of Washington and Lincoln   Reviews  to remind us that the melting pot has made us over into the most cosmopolitan nation in the world  It may be that the future of the arts in America is in the hands of these immigrants and their variously intermarrying children that they will endow us with that quick expressiveness that enthusiasm for beauty that warmth of passion which have been chilled out of Angle Saxon blood by ten centuries or more of British fog Already we are reminded often of the impending change by the fiery eloquence of some proletarian orator tearing the constitution to tatters by the demoniac rhythms of certain figures modelled by a fierce young Slavic sculptor by a burning poem sent to POETRY from a Syrian student of Columbia or by this white hot book of visions from the young Italian I W W agitator  They are indeed agitating to the comfortable conservative these visions Such an one seeking the solace of poetry beside his warm fire after a good dinner will perhaps read no further than these lines of the Proem  All that you worship fear and trust I kick into the sewer s maw And fling my shaft and my disgust Against your gospel and your law He would better read on however and then desert peaceful hearth and loaded table and go forth into the bitter world with this poet this lover and hater of men He would go to court and prison with him he would sit with him all night on a Mulberry Park bench he would look with him through a window at milady feeding her dog while a little newsboy starves in the storm he would hear him preaching a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Sermon on the Common and singing The Last Oracle and always he would find himself in contact with a fiery spirit whose poetry as Miss Helen Keller says in her Introduction is the spiritualization of a lofty dream that he seeks to realize the establishment of love and brotherhood and social justice for every man and woman upon earth  In the presentation of his vision Mr Giovannitti is fet  tered by the ordinary verse forms while in the broader ca  dences of metrical prose he has plenty of room for his vivid  imagery and sets it forth sometimes with a magnificent  gesture One would scarcely know where to look for a  nobler modern structure of wrath and despair than he builds  up in The Walker  Yet fearsome and terrible are all the footsteps of men upon the earth for they either descend or climb  They descend and they climb the fearful footsteps of men and some limp some drag some speed some trot some run they are quiet slow noisy brisk quick feverish mad and most awful is their cadence to the ears of the one who stands still  But of all the footsteps of men that either descend or climb no footsteps are so fearsome and terrible as those that go straight on the dead level of a prison floor from a yellow stone wall to a red iron gate  In The Cage the play of imagery is phosphorescent in its richness of color and quickness of movement The Sermon on  the Common is less poetic more preachy The Last Nickel is more conscious and labored and Out of the Mouth of Babes is more melodramatic though all burn with the same passion But in The Walker and The Cage the passion is fused to white hot purity and beaten into beautiful forms of power  H M   Reviews  Sonnets of a Portrait Painter by Arthur Davison Ficke Ken  nerley  Mr Ficke is a brilliant sonnetteer it goes without saying that in this sequence of fifty seven Shakespearean sonnets he has presented as many episodes of a love story with technical precision and eloquent richness of phrase Therefore if we admit his ardor and his workmanlike skill and yet attempt a closer analysis it is in an effort to find out why this adept art is not wholly satisfying  In the first place it shows a certain monotony of rhythmical pattern These sonnets all move too much alike with the same tempo line units pauses etc Read any group of them aloud and then any group of Shakespeare s sonnets and you will be struck anew with the variety of cadence phrasing and tempo in the latter This may seem an unfair comparison but on the contrary it is a compliment to find a young poet worthy of reminders from the masters Perhaps Mr Ficke writes too rapidly does not wait to be haunted for days and days by magic rhythms  Another exception is to his diction it is not simple enough not true to modern speech What Elizabethan ghost gave him such lines as these  Strange to remember that I late was fain To yield death back my poor undated lease  Of mid night argent mad moon archery  Nay all our longing compassed not such hope Nor did we in our flame shot passagings   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Push the horizon of our visions scope To regions of these far entangled things  He even says my rival faugh my soul s swift powers I yearned in vain and other stock phrases of melodrama and in general he chooses too often the so called poetic phrase instead of the simplest possible form of modern speech which will hold his meaning  If we point out these difficulties it is in the way of friendly warning to a poet far too richly endowed to permit himself any carelessness He is tempted by his own facility by his love of rich and honied words of storied beauty and romance  Yet after all there are sonnets in this series which move  proudly in their knightly robes One of the finest is the  tenth  Come forth for Spring is singing in the boughs Of every white and tremulous apple tree This is the season of eternal vows Yet what are vows that they should solace me For on the winds wild loveliness is crying And in all flowers wild joy its present worth Proclaims as from the dying to the dying Seize clasp thy hour of sun upon the earth Oh never dream that fire or beauty stays More than one April moment in its flight Toward regions where the sea drift of all days Sinks in a vast desireless lonely night Away with eternal vows and give me breath Of one white hour here on the marge of death  H M   Reviews  Children of Love by Harold Monro The Poetry Bookshop London  The Poetry Bookshop is tempting the war absorbed public with thin sheafs of verse ranging in price from twopence to sixpence Chap books Broadsides Garlands sheafs so well printed and made up as to make the American publisher envious of British prices for paper composition etc Mr Monro s thirty page pamphlet is one of these  If this sheaf is a garland it is winter gathered Its mood makes me think of a garden near Yokohama which I once visited in December for a mournful beauty pervades it and it is swept by the futile winds of war  T o what end of what use whom do we follow where do we go these and other dark questions wander like  ghosts in this poet s brain  To what God Shall we chant Our songs of battle  he cries and as he watches the soldier carelessly drinking his  stirrup cup he tries in vain to beat thought back  Every syllable said Brings you nearer the time you ll be found lying dead In a ditch or rolled stiff on the stones of a plain Thought Thought go back into your kennel again Hound back Drink your glass happy soldier tonight Death is quick you will laugh as you march to the fight We are wrong Dreaming ever we falter and pause You go forward unharmed without Why or Because  And it is no king s gleeman leading the hosts to battle who thus contemplates Youth in Arms   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Happy boy happy boy David the immortal willed Youth a thousand thousand times Slain but not once killed Swaggering again today In the old contemptuous way  Leaning backward from your thigh Up against the tinselled bar Dust and ashes is it you Laughing boasting there you are First we hardly recognized you In your modern avatar  Soldier rifle brown khaki Is your blood as happy so Where s your sling or painted shield Helmet pike or bow Well you re going to the wars That is all you need to know  Graybeards plotted They were sad Death was in their wrinkled eyes At their tables with their maps Plans and calculations wise They all seemed for well they knew How ungrudgingly Youth dies  Mr Monro paints vivid pictures of war in Retreat and Carrion and of drabbest Britain in London Interior Suburb and Appointment In Great City one discovers a gleam and A Strange Companion is a weird vision of dark sympathies between the two selves in a man s soul  If this poet sees little light ahead at least he does not shrink from the gloom H M   Reviews  Ernest Dowson by Victor Plarr Elkin Mathews  This is a most charming monograph The first chapters are perhaps the best account of Ernest Dowson that has been written or that will be written for that matter since no one else will have known the younger Dowson so well or will care so much about doing him justice Symons wrote as an artist Victor Plarr writes as a friend And the book is worthy of Plarr as one finds him in the Epitaphium Citharistriae and in his half forgotten book The Dorian Mood  Perhaps he does not give the whole Dowson but at least he presents the phase of Dowson that some other writers have neglected I have never been disappointed in a man whose work had first drawn me to him I think perhaps the best praise we can give to a memoir of an author is to say that it goes with his work that it leaves us with an impression of the man as we had found him already in his writings  Certain people would rather think of Dowson in cabmen s shelters or squabbling with drunken fishermen in Dieppe and the Breton towns Certain people will rather remember the beautiful story of the French magistrate who had condemned Dowson for assaulting the local baker Someone rushed into the court protesting that Dowson was a distinguished writer What what Monsieur Dowson a distinguished English litterateur Release M Dowson at once Imprison the baker  It may be myth but it is also literature It shows that in at least one country the arts are or were held in respect   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Some will resent what they will call Mr Plarr s attempt to make Dowson more acceptable to people who live in three story houses instead of in chambers and attics They will say that even the gospels would lose a great deal of their force were their hero not represented with a taste for bohemian company  Mr Plarr has perhaps met people who regard Dowson with undue severity and to correct their view he has written the charming first half of his book For this he was the ideal biographer not only because of friendship but because of a tradition which leaves him able clearly to objectify his friend while losing none of his sympathy Dowson a young Englishman enamoured of many things French the young Plarr an Alsatian half a refugee from the war of 70 a survivor of the senatorial families of Strasburg whose tradition is On porte sa bourgeoisie comme un marquisat  The memoir of this friendship is charming It is of the days before the shadow and perhaps Mr Plarr is right perhaps some writers have borne too heavily on the supposed luridity of Dowson s career which was in all truth pastoral enough a delicate temperament that ran a little amuck toward the end an irregular man with nothing a sane man would call vices At any rate Mr Plarr dwells with some emphasis on the rarer more delicate man the man as he must have been really in order to write his verses Some also will disagree with Mr Plarr s judgment that the earlier poems are the best The posthumous Decorations contains De Amore the Wine and Women and Song villanelle Dregs and   Reviews  Let us go hence One can not say that these poems show any decline of power though perhaps if one read as a friend and not as a stranger one would find their sorrow too great  In any case no one who loves his Dowson will go without this memoir this book which is in part his own letters gathered by that friend of his youth to whom they were written  E P Crack o Dawn by Fannie Stearns Davis Mrs A McK Gifford Macmillan This poet walks on the hills loves the wind and feels the eerieness of life One discerns a fine free spirit in her and now and then one hears a flute like voice of singular sweetness and purity But we begin to feel in many of these poems a certain straining of the note we hear the same motive over and over and detect a holding on to naive childlikeness Of course I shall be reminded that the poet is lost indeed who loses his childlike freshness of vision But this does not interfere with a poet s growing up when he comes to years of maturity and facing life with an adult mind Mrs Gifford should be taken off her windy New England hills should be racked and torn by the more searching winds of experience At present her poetry needs enrichment it is all up in the air There is aspiration in this book fancy a wistful sense of wonder but no reality no rooted growing breathing passion of life  Indeed the poet confesses all this with engaging frankness in poems like What if I Grow Old and Gray which   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  sees no life beyond youth or Restlessness in which nothing  life says comes clear or this lovely one Escape  Now since I cannot make it out Why people love and lose and die Why there is agony and doubt And so much cause to brood and cry  Oh since I cannot understand God s will for all the world and me I will go take the wind s cold hand And dance a little foolishly  W e like also The New House The Unborn The Storm Dance Profits As I Drank Tea Today and others most of which strike wistfully the same note H M  Songs of the Outlands Ballads of the Hoboes and Other Terse by Henry Herbert Knibbs Houghton Mifflin Co The duly sophisticated critic may dispose of this book by  labeling it Bret Hartish or Kiplingesque But this critic who has listened to cow boy yarns on the way to the Snake dance and to whom Arizona is a word of magic finds in it the authentic free range spirit the authentic cow boy cadence It is in short the best verse of its kind which has been written in this century or perhaps since Bret Harte himself  Some of these ballads and lyrics of rangers and hoboes are too good to perish I should say that Out There Somewhere Sunshine Over Yuma Oliver West and the three hobo monologues The Sheep and the Goats Ballade of the Boes and Along the Shore will surely be a part of that final small collection of dialect poems immortalizing the spirit of   Reviews  our frontier life through a romantic period They are masterpieces of familiar modern balladry we wish we had space to quote them H M  Bread and Circuses by Helen Parry Eden John Lane  This is a book of engaging light verse which might be recommended safely to those two fellow citizens Eugene Field of happy memory and our present autocrat of the breakfast table Bert Leston Taylor Like these two this poet is not only a deft weaver of gay rhymes but something more She has their gift of making friends for us of presenting live people in her poems and like them and certain greater poets she can say now and then grave things with a smile  New Poems by Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett  Browning Edited by Sir Frederick G Kenyon With  two portraits Macmillan  It may be questioned whether the last rags of verse wisely discarded by the living poet should be published to encumber the works of the dead Yet as few editors have the discretion or indeed the power to burn them perhaps only the poet is to blame for not doing so himself It becomes the duty of erudition to take note of them and new editions of Collected Works must be published to include them  Most of these thirty five poems and fragments were found among the papers of the late Robert Barrett Browning after his death and with other manuscripts and effects of the two poets were sold by auction in London in May 1913  H M    CORRESPONDENCE  THE NEW BEAUTY  Dear Editor I can but stand in bewilderment before the vast knowledge of Mr Ezra Pound Did ever Hindu Chinaman Brobdignagian or Lilliputian crook a finger at the muse but straight some wireless has brought the message for final judgment to his study table He is full of fust and ferment against those who are at ease in Zion He is the apostle of discontent I should say pope infallible  Does he not know that the same spirit of unrest discontent the same fust and ferment was in the veins of Milton driving him to Italy of Wordsworth driving him into the maelstrom of the French Revolution of Tennyson driving him over the Pyrenees on foot to get his heart cooled off He thinks it the New Beauty but it is in the veins of every colt that is turned loose in the paddock on a bright frosty morning  He might possibly remind me could he become in any most distant way aware of me at all that there is to be a new heaven and a new earth and he might proceed to show that he is now building the new heaven and the new earth But all new heavens and new earths and there have been millions of them are like every new growth of the coral islands simply rising out of and upon the old beauty and the new beauty never shakes itself loose from the old  The kingdom of God cometh not by observation Canst thou by searching find out God   The New Beauty  I am provoked not because Mr Pound approves of those who fill us with discontent I myself indulge in discontent but I also believe in modesty in criticism And I am not guarding the clothes of those who stone Milton nor am I consenting unto his death  Mr Pound souses that acquaintance of his into eternal limbo because he deliberately says that mediocre poetry is worth writing Without a vast field of mediocre poetry we could have no literature Mediocre poetry is the compost heap on which grow Shakespeares  Milton is the worst of poison Damn There have I got a dab of pure color on my palette at last  Whitman proclaimed himself a start in the right direction He never said American poetry is to stay where I left it Well in the name of common sense who ever wrote expecting poetry to stay put where he left it Will Mr Pound s imagists stay put where he leaves them No my dear sir all poetry all criticism will be like the North Pole every succeeding moment it will point in a new direction through a period of twenty two thousand years and then begin over  American poetry is of no use for the palette Still there is a wee bit of it that I m going to smear over my palette right
