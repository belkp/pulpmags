No III  JUNE 1917  THREE CANTOS  I  HAN G it all there can be but one Sordello But say I want to say I take your whole bag of tricks Let in your quirks and tweeks and say the  thing s an art form Your Sordello and that the modern world Needs such a rag bag to stuff all its thought in Say that I dump my catch shiny and silvery As fresh sardines flapping and slipping on the marginal  cobbles I stand before the booth the speech but the truth Is inside this discourse this booth is full of the marrow of  wisdom Give up th intaglio method   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Tower by tower Red brown the rounded bases and the plan Follows the builder s whim Beaucaire s slim gray Leaps from the stubby base of Altaforte Mohammed s windows for the Alcazar Has such a garden split by a tame small stream The moat is ten yards wide the inner court yard Half a swim with mire Trunk hose  There are not The rough men swarm out In robes that are half Roman half like the Knave of Hearts And I discern your story  Peire Cardinal Was half forerunner of Dante Arnaut s that trick Of the unfinished address And half your dates are out you mix your eras For that great font Sordello sat beside Tis an immortal passage but the font Is some two centuries outside the picture Does it matter  Not in the least Ghosts move about me Patched with histories You had your business To set out so much thought so much emotion To paint more real than any dead Sordello The half or third of your intensest life And call that third Sordello And you ll say No not your life   Three Cantos  He never showed himself Is t worth the evasion what were the use Of setting figures up and breathing life upon them Were t not our life your life my life extended I walk Verona I am here in England I see Can Grande Can see whom you will  You had one whole man And I have many fragments less worth Less worth Ah had you quite my age quite such a beastly and can  tankerous age You had some basis had some set belief Am I let preach Has it a place in music  I walk the airy street See the small cobbles flare with the poppy spoil Tis your great day the Corpus Domini And all my chosen and peninsular village Has made one glorious blaze of all its lanes Oh before I was up with poppy flowers Mid June some old god eats the smoke tis not the saints And up and out to the half ruined chapel Not the old place at the height of the rocks But that splay barn like church the Renaissance Had never quite got into trim again As well begin here Began our Catullus Home to sweet rest and to the waves deep laughter The laugh they wake amid the border rushes   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This is our home the trees are full of laughter And the storms laugh loud breaking the riven waves On north most rocks and here the sunlight Glints on the shaken waters and the rain Comes forth with delicate tread walking from Isola Garda  Lo soleils plovil  As Arnaut had it in th inextricable song The very sun rains and a spatter of fire Darts from the Lydian ripples locus undae as Catullus  Lydiae  And the place is full of spirits Not lemures not dark and shadowy ghosts But the ancient living wood white Smooth as the inner bark and firm of aspect And all agleam with colors no not agleam But colored like the lake and like the olive leaves Glaukopos clothed like the poppies wearing golden greaves Light on the air Are they Etruscan gods The air is solid sunlight apricus Sun fed we dwell there we in England now It s your way of talk we can be where we will be Sirmio serves my will better than your Asolo Which I have never seen  Your palace step My stone seat was the Dogana s curb And there were not those girls there was one flare one  face   Three Cantos  Twas all I ever saw but it was real And I can no more say what shape it was   But she was young too young  True it was Venice And at Florian s and under the north arcade I have seen other faces and had my rolls for breakfast for  that matter So for what it s worth I have the background  And you had a background Watched the soul Sordello s soul And saw it lap up life and swell and burst Into the empyrean So you worked out new form the meditative Semi dramatic semi epic story And we will say What s left for me to do Whom shall I conjure up who s my Sordello My pre Daun Chaucer pre Boccacio  As you have done pre Dante Whom shall I hang my shimmering garment on Who wear my feathery mantle hagoromo Whom set to dazzle the serious future ages Not Arnaut not De Born not Uc St Circ who has writ  out the stories Or shall I do your trick the showman s booth Bob Brown  ing Turned at my will into the Agora Or into the old theatre at Aries   POETRY A Magazine of V erse  And set the lot my visions to confounding The wits that have survived your damn d Sordello Or sulk and leave the word to novelists What a hodge podge you have made there Zanze and swanzig of all opprobrious rhymes And you turn off whenever it suits your fancy Now at Verona now with the early Christians Or now a gabbling of the Tyrrhene whelk The lyre should animate but not mislead the pen That s Wordsworth Mr Browning What a phrase That lyre that pen that bleating sheep Will Wordsworth That should have taught you avoid speech figurative  And set out your matter As I do in straight simple phrases  Gods float in the azure air Bright gods and Tuscan back before dew was shed It is a world like Puvis  Never so pale my friend Tis the first light not half light Panisks And oak girls and the Maenads Have all the wood Our olive Sirmio Lies in its burnished mirror and the Mounts Balde and Riva Are alive with song and all the leaves are full of voices  Non è fuggito  It is not gone Metastasio Is right we have that world about us And the clouds bow above the lake and there are folk upon  them   Three Cantos  Going their windy ways moving by Riva By the western shore far as Lonato And the water is full of silvery almond white swimmers The silvery water glazes the up turned nipple How shall we start hence how begin the progress Pace naif Ficinus say when Hotep Hotep Was a king in Egypt  When Atlas sat down with his astrolabe He brother to Prometheus physicist  Say it was Moses birth year Exult with Shang in squatness The sea monster Bulges the squarish bronzes Confucius later taught the world good manners Started with himself built out perfection  With Egypt Daub out in blue of scarabs and with that greeny turquoise Or with China O Virgilio mio and gray gradual steps Lead up beneath flat sprays of heavy cedars Temple of teak wood and the gilt brown arches Triple in tier banners woven by wall Fine screens depicted sea waves curled high Small boats with gods upon them Bright flame above the river Kwannon Footing a boat that s but one lotus petal With some proud four spread genius Leading along one hand upraised for gladness Saying Tis she his friend the mighty goddess Paean   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Sing hymns ye reeds  and all ye roots and herons and swans be glad Ye gardens of the nymphs put forth your flowers What have I of this life  Or even of Guido  Sweet lie Was I there truly  Did I knew Or San Michele  Let s believe it Believe the tomb he leapt was Julia Laeta s Friend I do not even when he led that street charge I do not even know which sword he d with him Sweet lie I lived Sweet lie I lived beside him And now it s all but truth and memory Dimmed only by the attritions of long time  But we forget not  No take it all for lies I have but smelt this life a whiff of it The box of scented wood Recalls cathedrals And shall I claim Confuse my own phantastikon Or say the filmy shell that circumscribes me Contains the actual sun  confuse the thing I see With actual gods behind me Are they gods behind me How many worlds we have If Botticelli   Three Cantos  Brings her ashore on that great cockle shell His Venus Simonetta And Spring and Aufidus fill all the air With their clear outlined blossoms World enough Behold I say she comes Apparelled like the spring Graces her subjects  That s from Pericles Oh we have worlds enough and brave décors And from these like we guess a soul for man And build him full of

continued   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  BERMUDA  Once Shoulders bare to the sun You carved cameos upon the sea Crisp white on milky blue Like Wedgwood  Now  You lie listless  In a robe of green velvet  Gorgeously flowered  Fee of the fickle winds  So In a monotony of loveliness You dream of the past An artist Who conceived a masterpiece Repeated and repeated it And has nothing more to give  QUANDARY  Autumn is moaning Yet I thrill with spring   Quandary  Leaves that fall to die Dance as they pass me  Music seems to ride The bluster of sparrows  Softer than any couch This ledge of granite  Mountains rim the horizon They cannot hem me in  Here in a stranger s pasture All the world is mine  TH E PASSAGE  And men may say of me Yes he loved beauty His songs were sweet But his life The ripple of a wave The twinkling of a dancer s feet  Richard Butler Glaenzer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SONGS OUT OF STRESS  BARTER  Life has loveliness to sell All beautiful and splendid things Blue waves whitened on a cliff  Climbing fire that sways and sings And children s faces looking up Holding wonder like a cup  Life has loveliness to sell Music like a curve of gold Scent of pine trees in the rain  Eyes that love you arms that hold And for your spirit s still delight Nearer in his circling flight  Spend all you have for loveliness Buy it and never count the cost For one white singing hour of peace  Count many a year of strife well lost And for a breath of ecstasy Give all you have been or could be   Spirit s House  SPIRIT S HOUSE  From naked stones of agony I will build a house for me As a mason all alone I will raise it stone by stone And every stone where I have bled Will show a sign of dusky red I have not gone the way in vain For I have the good of all my pain My spirit s quiet house will be Built of naked stones I trod On roads where I lost sight of God  LESSONS  Unless I learn to ask no help From any other soul but mine To seek no strength in waving reeds Nor shade beneath a straggling pine Unless I learn to look at Grief Unshrinking from her tear blind eyes And take from Pleasure fearlessly  Whatever gifts will make me wise Unless I learn these things on earth Why was I ever given birth   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REFUGE  From my spirit s gray defeat From my pulse s flagging beat From my hopes that turned to sand Sifting through my close clenched hand From my own fault s slavery If I can sing I still am free  For with my singing I can make A refuge for my spirit s sake A house of shining words to be My fragile immortality  WOOD SONG  I heard a wood thrush in the dusk Twirl three notes and make a star My heart that walked with bitterness Came back from very far  Three shining notes were all he had And yet they made a starry call I caught life back against my breast And kissed it scars and all  Sara Teasdale   BESIDE THE MASTER  God spoke to me to day Clearly I heard Him speak And yet I could not understand  Since death withdrew a hand that lay in mine Sad had I been for everything For I had seen As all men sometime see The one dark flaw in rosy dawn  In need thereafter was I fain To pluck a comfort from my days That I might love what would not die In whatsoever I had need to do I sought for beauty  But now to day Not many moments since I stood where I beheld the birth of moths I saw them born in suffering I saw their beauty I saw them die One brief hour passed Between their birth and death  Therein God spoke to me With how much pain he labors   POETRY A Magazine of Verse How delicate His workmanship How careless He to cast away I cannot understand What He would have me know Joseph Walleser  HOLY LIGHT  Where Life like a candle burns In the darkness of the night Moth like my lost spirit yearns  Nearer in his circling flight  Luringly her beauty draws Onward with each shuddering breath Till I flutter till I pause In the radiance of death  I am flaming I am fled All around you reigns the night But my agony has fed You a moment holy light  John Hall Wheelock   FIAMETTA  The south wind trembles through the grass Let it pass You will not come my way Any day  A white star trembles through the mist Purple and amethyst But Night lets fall Her hooded pall And I am glad because the white star dies  No stars surprise Your close shut eyes  GREETING  Over the wave patterned sea floor Over the long sun burnt ridge of the world I bid the winds seek you I bid them cry to you Night and morning A name you loved once I bid them bring to you Dreams and strange imaginings and sleep  Ella Young   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ONE FACE IN THE CROWD  Where have I seen your face before Why does it seem so out of place In a room with curtained windows And a closed door Ah lovely face That a star has kissed and the sun That the wind has touched with loving fingers Still the wonder lingers lovely one  I remember Summer came With a heart of song and flame Boughs were swaying winds were playing Little lutes that knew your name On a hillside where the grasses Waved into the waves of sea  And the sea waved into skies Now it all comes back to me As I look into your eyes As I looked into them then Wonder goes to come again  Long ago long ago On the hillside near the sea What did we talk of Was it love   One Face in the Crowd  Or did we stand there silently So it seems to me As I look on you today Wonder comes words go away  TW O SONGS  I When my dream robe is tattered If ever it is so And one may seem to scorn it Oh I shall let him know That it was torn on points of stars And gold of the rainbow  II When I am dead oh speak to me No words that I have heard Lest to my peace come misery Lest my calm sleep be stirred With want of mortal love again But bring a drop of April rain The dawn song of a bird The leafy lyric of a tree A slender flower with its dew That I may dream and seem to be Dead to all but you  Glenn   Ward Dresbach  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NOTES  I  When in the spring I go forth at morn A quiver with life I sing The world and I new born Then when I see all rampant growing Beds of tulips o er the plain Like pools and lakes of color glowing I would fain Outstrip all speed run Naked in the sun Plunge riot be immersed Quench this color thirst  II  Where go the birds when the rain Roars and sweeps and fells the grain When tortured trees groan with pain And the storm worn night is old Driven forth from their slumber cold Where go the birds  Jane Heap   DEAD QUEENS  There come not now such gold giving lords  Women of large hips small breasts And high white shoulders Red hair plaited And pale steadfast eyes You are the high romance Lilith Iseult and Guinevere You were fierce lovers Not caring to be loved  Always your lovers fared the perilous quest Patiently maybe you waited Maybe loved another What mattered it  All passion was in you all sweetness Your lovers in the far off courts of kings Feasted tarrying with many women  Patiently you waited Maybe loved another What mattered it POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Dead queens dead queens Your lovers left you When cheeks grew pale lips faded Yet you d not tie them to you With their pity Dead queens In that twilight Where you lived when love had left you Often the rumor came Of Tristrem and of Lancelot Riding afar Yet that was nought to you Time flies love dies and must die Why weep then In your king s beds You ll not remember The sweet or bitter of love  Lilith laughs at the old Adam Caught serpent wise by the swart eastern woman God gave him to his sorrow Her sorrows are his sorrow Her thoughts his thoughts For she has bound him to her With the strong toils of his pity His heart would burst to break them   Because Some Lover  BECAUSE SOME LOVER  Because some lover in some darkened place Leaned brooding towards the face of his dear Till after a long silence her white face Would droop towards him and lip to lip Half touching fearful lest their senses slip Bonds and whelm them in a clear White flood of passion they remain Lips touching yet apart a fierce strain On interlocking fingers  Some poet wrote it down And that old story lingers Your only crown Lancelot Abelard Paolo and Pelléas To too many women have you brought undoing  Too many women have been read The stories of your fates And always when was said  leaned brooding towards the face of his dear Till after a long silence her white face Would droop towards him and lip to lip Half touching fearful lest their senses slip Bonds and whelm them in a clear White flood of passion they remain   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Lips touching yet apart fierce strain On interlocking fingers  Then leaning towards each other On limb and separate feature the glance strays and lingers And drooping each to other Half kiss half droop apart Under intolerable strain  Too many lovers have you brought undoing Sick heart And great pain You Lancelot and Guinevere Paolo and Francesca You Abelard Heloise Pelléas and girl Mélisande And that first lover in some darkened place Drooping to a white face  IN A GARDEN  There was a paved alley there Apple trees and a lush lawn And over the gray wall where the plums were Stood the red brick of the chapel While over the long white wall   In a Garden  Where the green apples grew And the rusted pears Hung the gray tower of the church So high you couldn t see the top From that narrow garden  In that narrow garden on that lush lawn We found a ball left from some croquet game It had a blue stripe girdling it And Ah I thought It is your soul about me And we are flung Between our separate desires  In that narrow garden On the lush lawn We flung this ball each to other My eyes were only for your legs your arms Under that hot sun The hard ball hurt my hands Made them hot and prickly And I d have stopped But feared losing you While you too stayed on playing Ah if I d but known Because you would not have me go   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  We played so long I d ceased to think All thought each sense Rapt in the shimmering circumference The blue stripe girdling it Shone in the sky  Then I seemed looking down From some far field With this ball as one of worlds Scorned And cast from each to other Blue water girdling them  By and by the tea bell rang  John Rodker   RESURRECTION  Now all the hosts are marching to the grave The hosts are leaping from the edge of life  In a cascade of souls to sorrowful death  And I am just awakened from the tomb And whither they are going I have been In timelessness laid by in noiseless death  Now like a crocus in the autumn time  My soul comes lambent from the endless night Of death a cyclamen a crocus flower Of windy autumn when the winds all sweep The hosts away to death where heap on heap The dead are burning in the funeral wind  Now like a strange light breaking from the ground I venture from the halls of shadowy death A frail white gleam of resurrection  I know where they are going all the lives That whirl and sweep like anxious leaves away  To have no rest save in the utter night  Of noiseless death I know it well The death they will attain to where they go  I who have been and now am risen again  Now like a cyclamen a crocus flower  In autumn like to a messenger come back From embassy in death I issue forth   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Amid the autumn rushing red about The bitter world amid the smoke From burning fires of many smouldering lives All bitter and corroding to the grave  If they would listen I could tell them now The secret of the noiseless utter grave The secret in the blind mouth of the worm But on they go like leaves within a wind Scarlet and crimson and a rust of blood Into the utter dark they cannot hear  So like a cyclamen a crocus flower I lift my inextinguishable flame Of immortality into the world Of resurrection from the endless grave Of sweet returning from the sleep of death And still against the dark and violent wind Against the scarlet and against the red And blood brown flux of lives that sweep their way In hosts towards the everlasting night I lift my little pure and lambent flame Unquenchable of wind or hosts of death Or storms of tears or rage or blackening rain Of full despair I lift my tender flame Of pure and lambent hostage from the dead Ambassador from halls of noiseless death He who returns again from out the tomb Dressed in the grace of immortality   Resurrection  A fragile stranger in the flux of lives That pour cascade like down the blackening wind Of sheer oblivion  Now like a cyclamen a crocus flower In putrid autumn issuing through the fall Of lives I speak to all who cannot hear I turn towards the bitter blackening wind I speak aloud to fleeting hosts of red And crimson and the blood brown heaps of slain Just as a cyclamen or crocus flower Calls to the autumn Resurrection I speak with a vain mouth  Yet is uplifted in me the pure beam  Of immortality to kindle up  Another spring of yet another year  Folded as yet and all the fallen leaves  Sweep on to bitter to corrosive death  Against me yet they cannot make extinct  The perfect lambent flame which still goes up  A tender gleam of immortality  To start the glory of another year  Another epoch in another year  Another triumph on the face of earth  Another race another speech among  The multitudinous people unfused  Unborn and unproduced yet to be born  D H Lawrence  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EDITORIAL COMMENT  WHAT MAY WAR DO  N THI S bold cohesion of atoms which we  call a world the miraculous association of  cells which we call human life takes on an  illusory appearance of stability We are born  into an ingenious mechanism of flesh we develop into some fiery essence which thinks and feels we make things which seem solid and enduring we set going currents of power which circle the earth we do deeds and dream dreams which seem to transcend time and command future generations And thus we persuade ourselves that all is as it seems that a scheme of things which from the electron fused atom to the remotest nebula of whirling stars is flux and motion vibration in vastness that such a scheme may become for our convenience a civilization fixed and permanent may become the immutable laws of the Medes and Persians or of these federated states may become a social system complete and inexorable a perfectly built mosaic of carefully mechanized human parts  And then comes War  War topples over the fixed and permanent things and breaks the immutable laws It crashes through social systems and makes a chaos of the human mosaic arranging a new one of its own and destroying that At first it seems merely a murderous violator hideously interrupting all the   What War May Do  good works of the world every hero of peace laboring for some cause of justice some humane reform finds his path blocked by the caving in of ruins around him masses of broken prejudices shaken ideals every artist striving to reveal truth and beauty finds his vision veiled by the smoke of battle and violated by the scent of blood And the world seems mad lost for its sins bent upon extinction upon suicide  And yet war is a builder Out of the ruins of eras it tumbles together foundation stones for new ones Dead souls it quickens with its searching and devastating fires Better Belgium in her agony than New England comfortably asleep cried a man of light and leading telling of a great manufacturer who after making contracts for his product on the basis of higher wages refused his workmen the advance thus paid for and fought every inch of the strike they made to get what was their own Better war devastating war the enemy s heel on our throat than that kind of self righteous perversion and that is common  If we have war devastating war that shall relieve us of surplus billions and drain some of our most precious hearts blood its huge and irresistible flood may wash away much of the accumulated materialism which clogs our souls It is not enough that we fight as of old but in a larger more generous sense for liberty not only our own but the liberty of all men for the freedom of the seas and the democratizing of the world We must fight first and most persistently for freedom of the spirit that clear vision and stript athletic   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  strength of mind and soul which alone will enable us to  achieve our purpose and advance the freedom of the world  If war does this for us it will be not a relapse into medievalism not a devastating interruption of the arts and of every forward looking cause but a renewer a vitalizing force a reorganizer Patriotic war sets everything back cries Max Eastman in The Masses I quote from memory Ah but that may be an effect only immediate and apparent the inward and ultimate effect of war may be as it often has been to set everything forward and to do it with a rapidity an overwhelming force which the creeping movements of peace can never achieve Was not Russia only yesterday an autocracy Would anything short of the violence and agony of war have given her courage at this moment to assert her freedom to dethrone a czar whose first thought in entering this war was to strengthen not destroy his dynasty And may not the German autocrat be as bitterly surprised in the end  It would require a far prophetic vision to foresee the effects of war the effects upon us upon our nation of entering after long forbearance into this most terrible of wars But if we fight ourselves first if we purify our spirits in this flame the effect can not fail to be a great strengthening a great renewal We may be leaving youth behind attaining full maturity at last We may be sweeping away old accumulations of falseness and ugliness clearing the ground and the air for great artists great poets great leaders who shall see and reveal We may be fighting for greater issues than   What War May Do  now appear for the federation of the world for that dream of all great hearts the brotherhood of man  In the presence of eternity I see that patriotism is not enough said Edith Cavell before she was shot for patriotism Perhaps we shall all see beyond what we have lived for and die at the frontier of a new and more glorious promised land Our most fixed ideas our most cherished institutions may float away on new tides and we may laugh to see them go knowing that nothing is permanent excepting change in this bold cohesion of atoms which we call a world  The planet is shaken writes Carl Sandburg in a letter of last month We are in the most vivid era of all human world life to date All the forces of hope democracy laughter beauty and poetry are beginning to feel more songs tugging at their hearts than any time since August 1914 It s getting so bad it s good And he quotes a word uttered by Woodrow Wilson before the war even before he became President We live for our own age an age like Shakespeare s when an old world is passing away a new world coming in an age of new speculation and every new adventure of the mind a full stage an intricate plot a universal play of passion an outcome no man can foresee H M  FROM A NOTE BOOK  It is not necessary to express oneself encyclopaedically nor is it important to exhibit to one s readers the fact that one   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  has had thoughts on all subjects proper to a man The few things that one has felt more keenly and more illuminatingly than anyone else should be the central points of one s labor Explore all fields that are to be explored certainly but put your faith into the sinking of one narrow shaft to the very center of the earth Mere scope is futile  Put a brake on facility of composition Discard the words that come debonairly trailing no meteor flame of passion behind them  It is not safe to trust at all to the beauty or nobility or truth of the theme one has chosen These qualities if they exist in a poem do not have their dwelling place in the mere theme If they did prose would serve  Adjectives are the most lazy and loutish of words never let them congregate in a mob or they will start a riot and break windows Always regard them as the most dangerously seductive elements of speech They have somewhat the quality of a cloak they color but impede they hang inert however beautiful deriving their play of light from the vigor of other supporting words nobler words that bear within them their own power of movement and strength  Obviously the world exists solely for the benefit of the poets nevertheless it is only courteous for the poets to work and act as if they existed for the benefit of the world  There is no such thing as realism in the sense in which most people understand the word Realism meaning stenographic restatement simply does not exist The idea of it is   Front a Note book  a grotesque figment of a prosaic imagination suddenly frightened on being confronted with new combinations in art Art could not reproduce life if it tried and fortunately it seldom tries  To write of the hopes and destiny of man does not make one a great poet But the great poets will always write of the hopes and destiny of man  When a great poet writes an Ode to a Tomato Can look out His real theme is probably The Immortality of the Soul  The subtlest problem of every art is the problem of planes A plane is one of those peculiar levels to which as to a common denominator art reduces all the factors of any piece of work Art aspires to produce not the illusion of actual life but a proportioned dream which has a certain harmonious life of its own If this process is to be successful every part of the work must be brought into one single imaginary universe one sphere one plane governed by its own laws This little world obeys its own laws so consistently that we accept its existence without skepticism Thus a fairy tale if the problem of planes has been well solved need not arouse any sense of unreality But the most faithfully reportorial of novels will seem utterly incredible if the writer shifts planes in the middle of it There are planes of intensity of time of ethics of realism of beauty an infinite number of planes in each one of these and many more classes Shakespeare stands out as the greatest master of planes The Midsummer Night s Dream is the classic example Here his rustics   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  are raised to a level of exaggerated unreality and fancifulness that makes them possible denizens of the same unreal and delightful world as Theseus and Titania If one were to introduce the Nurse of Juliet and let her speak a single word the whole fabric would shatter like a tower of glass She would produce the effect that Bottom aims at in his marvelous project to soothe the frightened ladies of his audience Write me a Prologue and let the Prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that Pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more better assurance tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the Weaver this will put them out of fear A statuette of Bottom should stand on the desk of every poet as perpetual warning to him to mind his planes  The world which is always forgetting its older knowledge needs the illusion and enthusiasm of the young poet who comes crying with the glad voice of a discoverer some one of the ancient verities The new bottles sometimes help to sell the old wine  It is perilous for the poet to put all his faith in the conscious intellectual processes of his mind in his reasoned conclusions his logical ideas The scientist may be bounded by this region but not the poet Beyond all this in the subconscious tracts of the spirit lies a world of mysterious combinations and great forces where strike the roots of many of the profoundest repulsions and attractions of our being The mind analyzes and judges but the feelings leap and clasp Far beneath the surface of consciousness lie the   From a Note book  powers that created Kubla Khan and La Belle Dame Therefore it is not well for the poet to march too confidently and rudely ahead following the clear light of his working mind Let him perhaps pause waver drift wait expectant for the divine prompting the mysterious guidance tarry at the crossroad with eyes subdued to receive a sign that thus the faint voices of his buried self may perhaps become audible and direct him toward an achievement which shall astonish him like a thing not his own A D F  LIVING HISTORY  Perhaps it is only the Russians who at the bottom of some corner of their hearts could ever possibly understand America as it is today For we would scarcely ask any intelligent Russian however patriotic and devoted to his country s cause to offer us a panegyric on say the first Nicholas America today is in a position somewhat similar to that in which Russia was at the time of the first Nicholas It is incoherent and seething with discontent It is explosive with energy but finding no outlet on which to spend that energy It cries aloud for a true and abiding nationality but it finds that nationality cramped and fettered in a dozen ways by artificial politics artificial religion artificial wealth artificial life Steadily it is snapping the bonds that held it steadily it is becoming articulate of the chaos in which it finds itself And this growing articulateness is no artificial thing Literature in America is now no longer the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  beautiful plaything of a few cultivated people It is bursting out in the most unexpected places It is growing vulgar that it may speak to all hearts It is becoming a common heritage of the people  If there are any in England who care to understand what America may become in the future or who wish to discover a new phase of literary growth let them buy for example Amy Lowell s latest Men Women and Ghosts and perpend thereon They may be shocked horrified startled They may wince in horror at certain lines of certain poems so little will these square with their old traditions of good writing But sooner or later they will face the dilemma Either the old traditions are unalterable in which case there is nothing new in the world to say or else there is something new in the world to say which must create traditions of its own Which is it to be  Let the English reader in this year so pregnant with destiny turn first to the Napoleonic pieces which Miss Lowell has entitled appropriately Bronze Tablets These pieces I venture to say will illuminate the present war to their minds as nothing else has done There is only one thing that may be fitly compared to them which is that great unread poem Thomas Hardy s Dynasts But the reader will see in a moment that there can be in truth no comparison between things so different in their method  Hardy s is the old method of the epic poet Despite the fact that he has cast his poem in the form of a drama a quite unplayable drama he is essentially epic in outlook He nar   Living History  rates vividly imperturbably the events of history He is only as it were the optical lens through which certain events arrange themselves He is as impersonal as dumb Nature which has shaped these events Only in order to correct the perspective in order that we may see the relation and correspondence between the personages and in order that nothing may make one person bulk larger than another he constructs a complicated apparatus of immortals that comment upon and weigh each event Thus everything becomes small but clear We see Napoleon living and breathing but as it were through the wrong end of a telescope  Miss Lowell s method is profoundly different You may like or dislike it but fortunately mere unreasoned likings or dislikings have nothing to do with sane and orderly criticism And you must either grant the results in granting the method or refuse both method and results altogether The method is this Miss Lowell sits in an armchair turning over the facts of history in her mind gradually she visualizes them not as something which has been played out on the world s stage long ago and which can be revived only in the mind but as something which is being played out still as it were in another room through the gap of a window or door for the benefit of our ardent striving inchoate absurd twentieth century so she puts down what she sees all the time being aware of the fact that when it is finished she will resume the thread of her twentieth century affairs In this way we get a picture a dramatic living picture not of the past alone nor of the present but of their contact It is   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  as if an audience at a play suddenly realized that the actors were themselves in an earlier phase It is an art that uses the past as a searchlight to turn upon the present  Take the poem called The Hammers for instance Was ever such a poem as this written before Miss Lowell listens gazes nerves and brain on fire at the window of the past And what does she hear Why precisely the sound of hammers hammers building a ship hammers chipping off Napoleonic decorations and the names of battles from arches hammers shoeing a horse hammers making a coffin The grotesque inhuman horrible refrain of iron hammers goes through a third of a century And bit by bit out of their infernal devil s dance we get what Why precisely one of the great tragedies of history Napoleon in despair throwing himself on England s mercy and being packed off to St Helena to die  Marble likeness of an Emperor  Dead man who burst your heart against a world too narrow  The hammers drum you to your last throne  Which always you shall hold alone  The glory of your past is faded at a sunset fire  Your day lingers only like the tones of a wind lyre  In a twilight room  Strange commentary on human vanity from these crazy hammers Strange commentary for us who live today Even such a thing as a hammer plays its part in reminding in chastening us in making us feel the great sorrow and defeat of human effort Would the poem be any more true think you if the hammers had not played their part in it and sung their meaningless refrain from first line to last   Living History  No for the hammers are precisely the burden of the poem What is it that these hammers do not do They recreate history for us and in recreating it recreate our present day Let the hammers ring Soon for us they may be silent but for those who have ears to hear the burden of these hammers is the burden of the world the eternal world that ever groweth  Each of these small portions of the eternal world starts forth from the dark frame of the past moves vibrantly about us until the poem is finished and then vanishes again And while the drama is being played out we have the poet beside us not inhumanly aloof not pouring vials of wrathful morality on our heads but as a human being as much interested in the spectacle as we savoring to the full its grotesqueness its humor its irony its pathos its beauty Miss Lowell s poetry may disregard all the old English literary traditions granted But there is one tradition which it accepts which is more than all of these and that is the great human tradition To me the author of these poems is the most interesting poet personality in America today Her work cannot be judged as a fixed and finished product but as an ever growing approach to a new and more intensely vital life perspective It reconstructs humanity for us in a new way it is radically different from all that preceded it and therefore cannot be judged by past standards for its importance the future alone will be answerable And whatever the future s judgment may be there can be no doubt that the poet who created it is among the few that are great of soul J G Fletcher   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FIRE OF YOUTH  Some years ago twelve or thirteen a weird witch light descended out of the air upon me in the person of Miss Mary MacLane Anything more quaint and subversive wise in deep ways absurd in odd vanities both quiet and volcanic with a mind that undermined into dark corners and shook its little torch at the sun itself I never expect to see in human flesh than this young and pretty girl from Butte Montana  She had written a book of wild youthful revolt a book which made a noise even though it had a streak of genius in it The noise subsided and the maker of it has not again interrupted the silence until now The new book I Mary MacLane is once more introspective but more mature  though still absurdly young in spots and less rebellious It is not poetry but one may step out of POETRY S province to say a word for its prose which rises at times to heights of pure beauty and bright imaginative intensity Of an odd and whimsical or even tragical humor of laughter in such chapters as the one on Lot s wife or the Finn woman it becomes in others those on Keats or her dream child or the voices of children poignantly wistful sorrowful with the sorrows of the world  There are absurdities no doubt moments of world obliterating egotism which fail to convince But on the whole one gets an impression of piercing sincerity and strange beauty at times of poetic and luminous vision H M   REVIEWS  MR FULLER S NEW PHASE  Lines Long and Short by Henry B Fuller Houghton  Mifflin Co  From The Chevalier of Pensieri Vani back in the nineties to Lines Long and Short in this year of grace 1917 one may follow a sensitive romanticist who picks his way delicately among the thorns and brambles at the edge of the highway smiling at the pricks and scars which enforce upon him a bitter wisdom Always a consummate artist Mr Fuller delights in watching the strange human procession so full of reckless impulses and ardors which passes by along the road If he cannot fling himself into it no one knows better than he that this limitation is the reason why his art remains observant and a bit aloof in a passionate warring world  I call Mr Fuller a romanticist because he does not love things as they are because his instinct is to seek beauty in the past the far away in his dreams Thus he gave the passion of his youth to Italy like many another nineteenth century American and produced a masterpiece of delicate beauty and humorous insinuating charm the ultimate word of that new world mood which delights in the hoary and storied old world in its ancient splendors over grown and half decayed But he was not satisfied he could not go on in that mood even though he indulged it again with deep delight in the mystically pale efflorescence of The Last   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Refuge He could not escape the appeal of the raw the modern even of his own native city of Chicago He felt it but it grated on the finest fibres of his soul he could not reconcile it with his softly woven vision of discreetly remote beauty and so the novels in which he essayed modern  realism The Cliff dwellers and With the Procession are  experiments rather than whole hearted convinced interpretations of life  So he took refuge in satire In Under the Sky lights and The Puppet Booth he indulged contrasting satirical moods playing in one with certain slants of human character in the other of contemporary literary art and in both smiling always first and last at himself And now after a long interval we have this book in both satirical moods if they are not too grave this time to be called satirical this book which plays with both human character and contemporary literary art and as before plays most intimately perhaps most ruthlessly with himself  He has a very good time with his free verse this master of prose stripping it more bare of ornament than any imagist stamping it out with a kind of anvil cadence making it an effective instrument for his bitter music of soulless lives Materialism and sordid compromise so prevalent always and everywhere and especially to his mind here and now have got on Mr Fuller s nerves and this book with its iron humor and its keen and scalpel like sympathy is the record of his protest If it is a dark record it is not   Mr Fuller s New Phase  a dull one if it moves among shadows it carries a brilliant flash light of wit and wisdom and even uncovers now and then piteous little warm corners of humane gentleness and sweetness  It is not Chicago complete not her whole self out in the warm and searching and benevolent sunlight this book which Mr Masters has called the best book of Chicago that has come out of Chicago But if not quite the whole story it is an unsparing revelation of aridities in American life the good old Anglo Saxon stock narrowing down and drying up until there is nothing left of it but a wisp of spiritless existence In Tobias Holt Bachelor in Polly Greene in Alonzo Grout in Aridity he shows how Puritanism has petered out in these days of far horizons becoming a hard conventionality a dry respectability a firm plodding in a narrow groove which are more destructive to the race than Belgian deportations or Balkan wars No word of praise would be too strong for the unerring precision of Mr Fuller s art in these sharp drawings done in a few bold lines Again in The Statue and The Day of Danger he shows how futile is revolt to this type of mind and in Toward Childhood he shows how ashen is its triumph  It is a big thought provoking soul stirring book  But is it poetry I hear someone ask  Well I find a stark bold grotesque poetry in both its spirit and form Not that it matters what one calls it  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POETRY OF THE AMERICAN NEGRO  Songs of the Soil by Fenton Johnson Published by the author at 35 West 131st Street New York Although indirectly the negro has contributed not a little  to certain developments of American art particularly in music musical shows and folk stories But he has himself benefited very little or been very little concerned individually with the achievements that bear the imprint of his race The reason is not far to seek As soon as the negro is educated he begins to think the white man s thoughts or to try to think them it is impossible for him to do otherwise But his emotional reactions his religious feeling and his imagination are racially different from those of the white man and if his art is to amount to anything he will have to seek to give expression to what is essentially his But the negro poet has almost invariably echoed the white man s thought the white man s vision of the negro He has projected no new vision of himself Paul Lawrence Dunbar followed in the foot steps of Thomas Nelson Page and Joel Chandler Harris and other white men who used the negro dialect and portrayed the negro character and succeeding negro poets have followed Dunbar Usually when the negro poet discards dialect for plain English his language is pale and academic and his thought again is not his own but a weak dilution of some already diluted European model Although this book language is pale and anasmic beside the rich and colored oral expression of the negro race I do not mean to say that the negro poet should write exclusively in dialect   Poetry of the American Negro  What I mean to say is that he should discard this prop and invent a new and individual idiom based upon the charac terstic speech of his people And I would also recommend that all negro poets make a study of their folk songs collecting all they can for it is through such songs that they will learn to know their own race  This little book by Fenton Johnson furnishes substance and text for the foregoing remarks The poems in dialect are mostly commonplace but the Negro Spirituals written in the spirit of the genuine negro hymns and plantation folksongs not in dialect have in them the germ of future development Here is one of them called The Lonely Mother  Oh my mother s moaning by the river My poor mother s moaning by the river For her son who walks the earth in sorrow Long my mother s moaned beside the river And her tears have filled an angel s pitcher Lord of Heaven bring to me my honey Bring to me the darling of my bosom For a lonely mother by the river  Cease O mother moaning by the river Cease good mother moaning by the river I have seen the star of Michael shining Michael shining at the Gates of Morning Row O mighty Angel down the twilight Row until I find a lonely woman Swaying long beneath a tree of cypress Swaying for her son who walks in sorrow  Other interesting poems are John crossed the Island on his Knees God Be With You Shout my Brother Shout and Lif Up de Spade This last poem would be improved if it   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  were not written in dialect but in English like the Spirituals This is true also of some of the other poems in the book which seem to have a good deal of the folk feeling but disguised rather than helped by the dialect which has come to be commonplace and banal A C H  WAX TABLETS  Tablettes de Cire par A de Brimont Calmann Levy Paris  Frail things are proverbially long lived The bust outlasts the throne Time and again we are assured that Greek mythology is played out Neither the crowns of the French Academy nor the classical titles of the poems could attract one to the book before me  For five hundred years a part of the population of Europe has been engaged in retelling these tales They are shown time after time in what have been called I think with shortsightedness the waxen idylls of Amaltheus It is rare that in the retelling one comes upon fresh imagination as in John Baptist Pigna s Nymphae in their flight from the satyrs  Osculaque arboribus lachrymis madefacta tenellis Figere sed Nymphas cum iam sat saepe vocassent People given up wholly to rhetoric will wonder how a book with no unusual phrase no original thought no violence of expression can yet manage to hold one s interest and to establish the personality of its author The poems in Tablettes de Cire are worthy of their title   Wax Tablets  Échos légers échos en passant par mes lèvres Soyez frères de l ombre et des reflets sur l eau Les reflets d un reflet les échos d un écho  Carvings in ivory so white that at first glance one fears perhaps it is celluloid Many things contrary to my own particular canons of art Rhymed couplets which are not contrary to my canons but everywhere a purity of tone sustained permeating ever expression Nowhere does the reach exceed the grasp That is perhaps the secret the sign in this case of the curious sincerity of an artist who will pretend to no emotion beyond what she has felt and who has the wisdom to know that emotion as felt has been enough for the poem It is a book that could have come only from France that could have been written or published only where an author was conscious of a finally civilized audience an audience capable of receiving such poems  In La Pêche Merveilleuse I think the old legend is refilled with magic as also in Syrinx with touches of whimsicality  Il trouble les flots purs pour voiler son image Être un dieu lourd et laid quand tous les dieux sont beaux  There is a felicitous rendering from the Arabic beginning  Ta robe avait glissé dans la rivière verte Et toi les bras tendus le visage pâli Les sourcils remontés et a bouche entr ouverte Tu la regardais fuir fille de Bâkili Je suivais des sentiers déjà suivis la veille Car je crains les détours du sentier different Salut dis je salut Ta jeunesse est pareille A la robe de lin qu entraîne le courant Pareille elle s enfuit au fil du temps qui presse  E P   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A SYMPHONIC SUITE  The Jig of Forslin by Conrad Aiken Four Seas Co  We have had other symphonies in verse but none of them for the present reviewer gives the effect of music evokes so nearly the same kind of emotion music evokes as this book does The term symphony not only suits it but there is no other one word suits it so well The publishers call this a novel in verse a story of adventure in a man s mental hinterland but while it is true that the poem is more than a collection of episodes the parts are bound together not as the parts of a story but as the movements of a symphony with repetition of phrase and theme moods and motives which appear and reappear are joined and again dispersed in no logical pattern but fluctuating and flowing  Music heard in a dream or hid in a wall Like a slow music moving under a sea  In it you may know what it is you are thinking when you are not thinking see the procession of dream and memory and desire as it goes sliding by in the mind when the mind is numbed or drifts resting from its obvious actual life and experience merges with the experience outside  It might be pointed out that in this book as in others by Conrad Aiken there is a disproportionate abundance of harlotry but perhaps that is what one must expect looking at Forslin or at any not too aged man through glasses Freudian Real and unreal are blended the submerged rises into sight the thwarted reaches out into satisfaction and life   A Symphonic Suite  is lived beyond the limits imposed by inhibition and necessity time space Ever I turn and turn with my turning shadow Ever like smoke I am blown and spread and die  H H  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  THE HAWK S WELL  I was passing a store window when I noticed an attractive cover on a magazine Closer inspection revealed the fact that it was a reproduction of a painting by Edmund Dulac fine enough to make one care to preserve it So I gave the clerk a quarter for the March number of Harper s Bazar and began turning the pages to see if there were more illustrations by Dulac As it happened there was nothing with any direct reference to the Chinese lady on the cover but there was an article on The Hawk s Well the Noh play written by William Butler Yeats with Dulac s designs for the costumes and for the masks worn by the two principal characters This was interesting and I congratulated myself on having bought the magazine usually associated in one s mind with fashions for which being on the edge of the desert I had no present use The article and illustrations covered two full pages in the body of the magazine and I fancied that that was all there was to it Not until I reached home did I notice at the bottom of the second page of the article which proved to be a preface by Mr Yeats a note in small type Continued on page 132 and there sure   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  enough between advertisements of Hair Restorers Patent Leather Boots Mrs Vernon Castle and Back lace Corsets I found the text of The Hawk s Well Perhaps there was something symbolic about it Many may wait and fall asleep and know only by the wet stones that they have missed the perfect moment I at least had luck I found the play But think of a Noh drama born of the most ascetic theatre and convention produced among such distractions Is it not a reversal of all precedent  Mr Yeats brief play is based upon the structure of the Japanese Noh as revealed to him in the Pound Fenollosa translations familiar to the readers of POETRY He has chosen an incident from the heroic age of Ireland and Cuhullain is one of the principal characters There are but six three dancers the Guardian of the Well an old man and a young man who is Cuhullain Dancing and music of course complete the action The verse is extremely simple  He has made a little heap of leaves He lays the dry sticks on the leaves And shivering with cold he has taken up The fire stick and socket from its hole He whirls it round to get a flame And now the dry sticks take the fire And now the fire leaps up and shines Upon the hazels and the empty wells  The form of the Noh is peculiarly adapted to our Little Theatres and it will be surprising if more poets do not experiment with it Mr Wallace Stevens play Three Travellers Watch a Sunrise although it did not follow strictly the Noh conventions and although it called for one   The Hawk s Well  very realistic feature which might be hard to manage artistically had a great deal of the Noh spirit and it is in this sense that I have always thought of it A C H  WANTED A SONG FOR AMERICA  In its issue of May tenth Life offers a prize of five hundred dollars for a song for America in the present crisis No poem or song shall be longer than twenty four lines It should be a song of modern Democracy typifying the spirit of Liberty Fraternity Equality and the Allies Isn t that enough to frighten the Muse Also Its adaptability to be set to music will be a factor By best is meant its close conformity to the description just given united with correct metrical rendering The poems are to be in by noon June 18th and more than one poem may be submitted by one contestant A postscript is to the effect that in the event of a tie the prize will be duplicated This is as it should be A split prize is worse than a split infinitive Any poet who can tackle modern Democracy the spirit of Liberty Fraternity Equality and the Allies and get away with it in twenty four lines is entitled to all that is coming to him Nevertheless we hope for the miracle  A C H  POETRY which has been rebuked for presenting no poetry of militant patriotism at the very moment when the war drums sounded is as eager as Life to prove the miracle and it hereby asserts its desire to

lyric or dramatic on some motive suggested by the present crisis Our only regret is that no one has given us a five hundred dollar prize to be offered as a stimulus and a reward H M CORRESPONDENCE  TO

The author writes  As POETRY circulates among people definitely interested in the art I do not feel apologetic about presenting the opening cantos of an exceeding long poem Most of the long poems that one can read were written before printing was invented and circulated in fragments More recent precedent may be found in the publication of separate cantos of Don Juan  It has been one of POETRY S chief services to make possible the current publication of work that otherwise would have been available only upon the issue of a complete volume of an individual s work The harm which other magazines have done to poetry is largely in that they have fostered a habit among poets of setting forth only so much of their work as may be intelligible and acceptable in bits only a page or so at a time  Mr D H Lawrence the well known English poet and novelist has been printed often in POETRY He is represented in the Some Imagist annuals and his book of verse Amores is published in this country by B W
