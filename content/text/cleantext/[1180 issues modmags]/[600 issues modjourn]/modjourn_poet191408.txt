cobbles  Guarda Ahi Guarda ch e b ea  But three years after this I heard the young Dante whose last name I do not know For there are in Sirmione twenty eight young Dantes and  thirty four Catulli   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And there had been a great catch of sardines And his elders Were packing them in the great wooden boxes For the market in Brescia and he Leapt about snatching at the bright fish And getting in both of their ways And in vain they commanded him to sta fermo And when they would not let him arrange The fish in the boxes He stroked those which were already arranged Murmuring

understand the conduct of this world s affairs In fact they understood them so badly That they have had to cross the channel  Nine lawyers four counsels five judges and three proctors of the King   The Bellaires  Together with the respective wives husbands sisters and  heterogeneous connections of the good Bellaires Met to discuss their affairs But the good Bellaires have so little understood their affairs That now there is no one at all Who can understand any affair of theirs Yet Fourteen hunters still eat in the stables of The good Squire Bellaire But these may not suffer attainder For they may not belong to the good Squire Bellaire But to his wife On the contrary if they do not belong to his wife He will plead A freedom from attainder For twelve horses and also for twelve boarhounds From Charles the Fourth And a further freedom for the remainder Of horses from Henry the Fourth But the judges Being free of mediaeval scholarship Will pay no attention to this And there will be only the more confusion Replevin estoppel espavin and what not  Nine lawyers four counsels etc Met to discuss their affairs But the sole result was bills From lawyers to whom no one was indebted   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And even the lawyers Were uncertain who was supposed to be indebted to them  Wherefore the good Squire Bellaire Resides now at Agde and Biaucaire To Carcassonne Pui and Alais He fareth from day to day Or takes the sea air Between Marseilles And Beziers  And for all this I have considerable regret For the good Bellaires Are very charming people  SALVATIONISTS  I  Come my songs let us speak of perfection We shall get ourselves rather disliked  II  Ah yes my songs let us resurrect The very excellent term Rusticus Let us apply it in all its opprobrium To those to whom it applies   Salvationists  And you may decline to make them immortal For we shall consider them and their state In delicate Opulent silence  III Come my songs Let us take arms against this sea of stupidities Beginning with Mumpodorus And against this sea of vulgarities Beginning with Nimmim And against this sea of imbeciles All the Bulmenian literati  AMITIÃ‰S  Old friends the most  W B Y  I  To one on returning certain years after  You wore the same quite correct clothing You took no pleasure at all in my triumphs You had the same old air of condescension Mingled with a curious fear  That I myself might have enjoyed them  Te voila mon Bourrienne you also shall be immortal   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  II  To another  And we say good bye to you also For you seem never to have discovered That your relationship is wholly parasitic Yet to our feasts you bring neither Wit nor good spirits nor the pleasing attitudes  Of discipleship  III  But you bos amic we keep on For to you

hair also is turning  Young Lady  I have fed your lar with poppies I have adored you for three full years And now you grumble because your dress does not fit And because I happen to say so  Lesbia Illa  Memnon Memnon that lady Who used to walk about amongst us With such gracious uncertainty Is now wedded To a British householder  Lugete Veneres Lugete Cupidinesque  Passing  Flawless as Aphrodite Thoroughly beautiful Brainless The faint odor of your patchouli Faint almost as the lines of cruelty about your chin Assails me and concerns me almost as little   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE SEEING EYE  The small dogs look at the big dogs They observe unwieldly dimensions And curious imperfections of odor  Here is a formal male group The young men look upon their seniors They consider the elderly mind And observe its inexplicable correlations  Said Tsin Tsu It is only in small dogs and the young That we find minute observation  ABU SALAMMAMM A SONG OF EMPIRE  Being the sort of poem I would write if King George V should have me chained to the fountain before Buckingham Palace and should give me all the food and women I wanted  To my brother in chains Bonga Bonga  Great is King George the Fifth for he has chained me to this fountain  He feeds me with beef bones and wine Great is King George the Fifth His palace is white like marble His palace has ninety eight windows His palace is like a cube cut in thirds   Abu Salammamm A Song of Empire  It is he who has slain the Dragon  and released the maiden Andromeda Great is King George the Fifth For his army is legion His army is a thousand and forty eight soldiers  with red cloths about their buttocks And they have red faces like bricks Great is the King of England and greatly to be feared For he has chained me to this fountain He provides me with women and drinks Great is King George the Fifth  and very resplendent is this fountain It is adorned with young gods riding upon dolphins And its waters are white like silk Great and Lofty is this fountain And seated upon it is the late Queen Victoria The Mother of the great king in a hoop skirt  Like a woman heavy with child  Oh may the king live forever Oh may the king live for a thousand years For the young prince is foolish and headstrong He plagues me with jibes and sticks And when he comes into power He will undoubtedly chain someone else to this fountain And my glory will Be at an end  Ezra Pound   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE COAL PICKER  He perches in the slime inert Bedaubed with iridescent dirt The oil upon the puddles dries To colors like a peacock s eyes And half submerged tomato cans Shine scaly as leviathans Oosily crawling through the mud The ground is here and there bestud With lumps of only part burned coal  His duty is to glean the whole To pick them from the filth each one To hoard them for the hidden sun Which glows within each fiery core And waits to be made free once more Their sharp and glistening edges cut His stiffened fingers Through the smut Gleam red the wounds which will not shut Wet through and shivering he kneels And digs the slippery coals like eels They slide about His force all spent He counts his small accomplishment A half a dozen clinker coals Which still have fire in their souls Fire And in his thought there burns The topaz fire of votive urns   The Coal Picker  He sees it fling from hill to hill And still consumed is burning still Higher and higher leaps the flame The smoke an evershifting frame He sees a Spanish Castle old With silver steps and paths of gold From myrtle bowers comes the plash Of fountains and the emerald flash Of parrots in the orange trees Whose blossoms pasture humming bees He knows he feeds the urns whose smoke Bears visions that his master stroke Is out of dirt and misery To light the fire of poesy He sees the glory yet he knows That others cannot see his shows To them his smoke is sightless black His votive vessels but a pack Of old discarded shards his fire A peddler s still to him the pyre  Is incensed an enduring goal He sighs and grubs another coal  Amy Lowell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE BUBBLING FOUNTAIN  This is a magic cup That needs no lifting up And gushes the cool drink From an ever flowing brink From an ever filling hollow As you swallow You can feel the water go Against your lips with tumbling flow And all its noises hear As if you were a deer Or a wild goat Sucking the water into your throat Where a little brook goes by Under the trees and the summer sky Oh it is fun to drink this way Like a pleasant game to play Not like drinking in other places And it is fun to watch the faces That come and bend them at this urn Something you can learn Of each person s secret mind Know which is selfish which is kind Those who guard their dignity And those whose curiosity Is turning cold Many of the young are old   The Bubbling Fountain  And think A drink is nothing but a drink Water is water always the same They could not turn it into a game Charily with solemn mien They lean These incurious of heart And hurrying depart But the children know it s a gay rare thing To drink outdoors from a running spring And laugh And quaff As if their inquisitive zest Would challenge to a test The bounty of this store Which gives and still has more They drink up all they can Wait in turn to drink again As I watch the reaching lips  It seems to be my mouth that sips I stoop and rise with each one But when they are done And their faces touched with spray They quickly wipe it away And this sometimes I regret Because their lips look prettier wet  Helen Hoyt   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE DANCE BEFORE THE ARCH  Windy April night mist swept the Square  Lights among the leafage swayed and flashed Piquant bosky odors filled the air Piquant as a Maenad s flying hair  Late the dripping dogwood buds had lashed Then three fared forth together A wise old teacher of men  A poet who laughed with the weather And a silent knight of the pen They walked in the rain witched park While the hours grew small and dark  And their talk was light as a feather That Bacchus blows at a mark  All around the city sounds were whist  All about where branches laughed and leapt Glints of eyes looked out into the mist Little golden dancing rainbow kissed  Little shapes and shadows flashed and crept Then the sage O wonderful weather Strange eerie Then he of the pen  The pixies are out all together Valpurgis Nacht Bacchus Amen He waved his arms and inclined His face to the night joy blind   The Dance Before the Arch  Then the poet Oh pluck me a feather From the stretched gray wing of the wind  Over asphalt polished by the rain  Out of mist swirls iris splotched with light Loomed a sudden beauty marble plain Arched and sombre fronting with disdain  All the springtime turmoil of that night Then the sage The old Arch in this weather Needs garlands Then he of the pen  The lost Roman thing All together Get branches we re Romans again So they took each boughs in their hands Obeying the ancient commands  When laurel put forth a green feather And Proserpine gathered her bands  They marched in a grave wild measure They waved their boughs They were austere faced for pleasure  In the Spring s house The sharp wind gave them glee The wind with a tang of the sea  They drank it deep and at leisure As a nobly offered rouse There were faint lights under their feet Each light with a halo of pearl There were lights in the night around   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Each blown mist tressed like a girl Faster their feet beat With a quick glad sound  Io Bacchus Honey sweet Io Proserpine O golden O divine  Loosed again from the ground  They lifted arms they danced With quick breath Below around lights glanced  As life from death Io Proserpine is dead  But the Spring lives Io Bacchus where s he fled But the vine thrives  Good hap to Aphrodite And her doves red feet Redder than new wine Are the lips of my sweet Io Spring  Young new Fairer for the vast Passionate old past  Io Io Spring I sing I sing I am drunk with wine with wine and the Spring   The Dance Before the Arch  They danced they swayed The air sang Under their boughs They laughed they played With the mist that stang Their mid carouse Io Spring s blood s on my face And in my hair Io Spring magical maid For me forswear The vine buds red The willow gold The lady birch is white And slim in the night Oh make my bed With white and gold and red Or ever the year grows old And cold Io Io And the tale of the frost is told  All around the city sounds were whist  Over asphalt polished by the rain Loomed the sombre Arch amid the mist At its feet some boughs the Spring had kissed  Whispered to the driving wind s refrain Then three fared forth together A wise old teacher of men   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A poet who sang with the weather And a silent knight of the pen They went arm linked from the park That none be lost in the dark  And their hearts were light as a feather That Bacchus blows at a mark  Allan Updegraff  SONG  A few more windy days Must come and go their ways And we will walk My love and I Beneath the amber dripping boughs  Then on the stars we ll tread On purple stars and red And wonder why The while we talk Men sing so much of broken vows  Helen Dudley   SKETCHES  THE INTERNE  Oh the agony of having too much power In my passive palm are hundreds of lives Strange alchemy they drain my blood My heart becomes iron my brain copper my eyes silver  my lips brass Merely by twitching a supple finger I twirl lives from me  strong winged Or fluttering and broken They are my children I am their mother and father I watch them live and die  THE OLD JEW  Not fawn tinged hospital pajamas could cheat him of his  austerity Which tamed even the doctors with its pure fire They examined him made him bow to them Massive altars were they at whose swollen feet grovelled a  worshiper Then they laughed half in scorn of him and there came a  miracle The little man was above them at a bound His austerity like an irresistible sledge hammer drove them  lower and lower They dwindled while he soared   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE MINER  Those on the top say they know you Earth they are liars You are my father and the silence I work in is my mother Only the son knows his father We are alike sweaty inarticulate of soul bending under  thick knowledge I drink and shout with my brothers when above you Like most children we soon forget the parents of our souls But you avidly grip us again we pay for the little noise of  life we steal TO AN ENEMY  I despise my friends more than you I would have known myself but they stood before the mirrors And painted on them images of the virtues I craved You came with sharpest chisel scraping away the false paint Then I knew and detested myself but not you For glimpses of you in the glasses you uncovered Showed me the virtues whose images you destroyed  TO A DISCARDED STEEL RAIL  Straight strength pitched into the surliness of the ditch A soul you have strength has always delicate secret reasons Your soul is a dull question I do not care for your strength but for your stiff smile at  Time A smile which men call rust  Maxwell Bodenheim   POEMS  TH E WASTE PLACES  I  As a naked man I go Through the desert sore afraid Holding up my head although I m as frightened as a maid  The couching lion there I saw From barren rocks lift up his eye He parts the cactus with his paw And stares at me as I go by  He would follow on my trace If he knew I was afraid If he knew my hardy face Hides the terrors of a maid  In the night he rises and He stretches forth he snuffs the air He roars and leaps along the sand He creeps and watches everywhere  His burning eyes his eyes of bale Through the darkness I can see   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He lashes fiercely with his tail He would love to spring at me  I am the lion in his lair I am the fear that frightens me I am the desert of despair And the nights of agony  Night or day whate er befall I must walk that desert land Until I can dare to call The lion out to lick my hand  II  As a naked man I tread The gloomy forests ring on ring Where the sun that s overhead Cannot see what s happening  There I go the deepest shade The deepest silence pressing me And my heart is more afraid Than a maiden s heart would be   The Waste Places  Every day I have to run Underneath the demon tree Where the ancient wrong is done While I shrink in agony  I saw the demon hold a maid In his arms and as she daft Whimpered in fear he bent and laid His lips on hers and laughed  And she beckoned me to run And she called for help to me And the ancient wrong was done Which is done eternally  I am the maiden and the fear I am the sunless shade the strife I am the demon lips the sneer Showing under every life  I must tread that gloomy way Until I shall dare to run And bear the demon with his prey From the forest to the sun   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HAWKS  And as we walked the grass was faintly stirred We did not speak there was no need to speak Above our heads there flew a little bird A silent one who feared that we might seek Her hard hid nest  Poor little frightened one  If we had found your nest that sunny day We would have passed it by we would have gone And never looked or frightened you away  O little bird there s many have a nest A hard found open place with many a foe And hunger and despair and little rest And more to fear than you can know  Shield the nests where er they be On the ground or on the tree Guard the poor from treachery   The Liar  THE LIAR  Did you think old Grizzly Face to frighten me To frighten me who fronted you before Times out of mind When through that sudden door  You took and bound and cast me to the sea  Far from my kind Far from all friendly hands Now I Tremble no longer at your whisper at your lie  I go with you but only till the end Of one small hour and when the hour is done I shall again Arise and leap and run  From the wind swept icy caves I shall ascend  I shall attain T o the pearly sky and the open door and the infinite sun And find again my comrades with me every one  So once more here are my hands to wind Your cords about here are my feet to tie Straitly and fast And here on either eye  Press your strong fingers until I am blind  Now at the last Heave me upon your shoulder whispering sly As you so oft before have whispered your dark lie   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A day dawns surely when you will not dare To come to me then you will hide away In your dark lands Then you will pray  You will snarl and tremble when I seek you there  To bind your hands To whisper truth where you have whispered lies To press my mighty fingers down upon your eyes  DARK WINGS  Sing while you may O bird upon the tree Although on high wide winged above the day Chill evening broadens to immensity Sing while you may  On thee wide hovering too intent to slay The hawk s slant pinion buoys him terribly Thus near the end is of thy happy lay  The day and thee and miserable me Dark wings shall cover up and hide away Where no song stirs of bird or memory Sing while you may  James Stephens  EDITORIAL COMMENT THE POET S BREAD AND BUTTER It is instructive in art as in politics to watch the workings of the public mind I think it was John Quincy Adams who nearly a century ago considered proficiency in the arts unworthy of free and enlightened citizens Probably the numerical majority of his race on both sides of the ocean are still of his opinion but they no longer utter it with his confidence Their security has been imperiled not so much by the effrontery of artists in producing masterpieces as by the endless talk the noisy wig wagging of solemn tongues and pens which these masterpieces and their train of lesser works have excited To such a degree has the good citizen s contempt of art been shaken that he has begun to encourage certain of its manifestations The arts of painting sculpture music and architecture are now heavily endowed in many of our cities So many prizes traveling scholarships rich purchases and other rewards now await the aspiring painter or sculptor that it is scarcely possible for him to maintain any longer that modesty of fortune and demeanor which once seemed necessary to his development Indeed the public seems at last quite willing to admit that starvation and other forms of avoidable suffering do not assist a man of genius to paint or carve Not yet however does the public admit this of the poet Large prizes and high prices may not injure the painter million dollar orders may develop the architect but any   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  such substantial evidence of favor would undermine the precarious vitality of the poet He is lucky if he gets a mere pittance from editors insufficient to support him on bread and water in a hermit s cave He competes for no scholarships and for no prizes but POETRY S For him no American Academy at Rome opens its richly gilded doors though why a poet should not learn more in loafing around Rome than any other artist is a mystery deeper than Lord Dundreary s  The poet alone is continually reminded that lack of food and sympathy are good for him Listen to the New York Nation s luminous exposition of the world s duty toward its poets  Even if he the poet shared the limited assistance which endowments give to scientists and scholars it would sap society s sense of duty toward the arts And he may find various sweet uses in his adversity a close acquaintance with life a call to perseverance and the protection of his art from the soiling hand of money grubbing  The Nation need not complain that society has not done its full duty by the poet teaching him the sweet uses of adversity not only by protecting him from the soiling hand of money grubbing but by turning upon him the deaf ear and lifting against him the stone wall Is there any third rate painter in America or Europe who has never received two hundred and fifty dollars for a picture Yet when Poetry offered this amount as a small prize to the most distinguished of living English poets the world was agape with amazement that a poem could earn so much money Mr   The Poet s Bread and Butter  Sargent is no more famous as a painter than Mr Yeats is as a poet yet the labor of a week or two would be repaid in the one case by from five to ten thousand dollars in the  other by little or nothing  But let us continue with the illuminating Nation  We are not however without consolation in watching the discomfort of men like Moody and Thompson counterparts of many other poets The necessities of occupation in an unkind environment seldom rob us of anything of the highest value The commanding figure under modern conditions that make a Chatterton s fate almost impossible will be discovered ere the shades of the counting house close around him Or if like Browning he remains undiscovered some appreciation lets his generous spirit still work along the plan that pleased his boyish thought  Th e beauty of this reasoning is beyond the reach of criticism Put Shakespeare under the necessity of occupation in an unkind environment in other words set him to pegging Elizabethan shoes for a living Hamlet is never written and the Nation is not robbed of anything of the highest value because even so divinatory an editor can not conceive of Hamlet s being possible until it HAS BEEN WRITTEN In the same way he finds a Chatterton s fate impossible under modern conditions alas the modern Chatterton is not only possible but numerous but when his genius is snuffed out by death poverty public apathy or the compulsion to waste his time and brains earning a living he is lucky if he gets a brief paragraph in a newspaper instead of immortal fame  How can the Nation and its kind hear in their hearts the  unsung songs How can they tell what the world has lost  by silencing its poets and crucifying its prophets A mas   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  terpiece of art is not a miracle of individual genius so much as the expression of a reciprocal relation between the artist and his public He who must butt his head against a stone wall of apathy cannot long get out of it his best work Therefore let the Nation and its numerous rivals no longer be consoled by various flattering unctions as they watch the discomfort of poets but be up and doing to diminish that discomfort  To have great poets there must be great audiences too  H M REVIEWS Carducci A Selection of his Poems with Verse Transla  tions Notes and Three Introductory Essays by G L Bickersteth M A Longmans Green amp Co Acknowledged the greatest Italian poet of the second  half of the nineteenth century Carducci has received but scant recognition from England and America This injustice Mr Bickersteth has undertaken to correct by means of the present volume containing selections from the poet s work verse translations of these selections and a sheaf of essays He has done his work exceptionally well the essays build a broad and sympathetic avenue of approach to the  Italian master and the translations though they will not be found and should not be expected to render at all times the exact shade of the original show a skilful hand and a loving penetration into Carducci s world   Reviews  To recommend a volume of Carducci s verse to American readers is to answer the question what has the poet to say to the present generation He was born in 1835 and lived through all those stirring years that transformed Italy into a modern nation To achieve this end splendid political victories had to be won But more important still and more fundamental a moral change had to be wrought in the character of the whole Italian nation Enslaved for centuries to foreign powers the oppressed people had to be taught to walk erect and had to learn afresh the meaning of such sacred words as Liberty and Independence and because Carducci more successfully than any other lit the altar fires in their hearts they acclaimed him as their vate their inspired seer But while urging his countrymen to renew their own moral and spiritual beings as the best preparation for freedom and union he did not fail to direct piercing shafts of hatred and contempt at every enemy of progress and above all at the Roman Catholic Church It is astonishing how large a part of his work is permeated with these patriotic themes if we note in addition that he grew up at a time when the romantic movement was at its palest and its sickliest and that he shared the strong reaction against its tenets that set in shortly after the middle of the century we have pretty much the compass of his work till the learned second period of his life  It is this learned second period which according to the present reviewer at least spells disaster Not unnaturally a man whose wholesome vigor and simple sense of the reali   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ties of life turned him in his youth against the current romantic flabbiness felt his heart go out more and more strongly to the great and self contained literature of Greece and Rome But misfortune would have it that to earn a livelihood the poet accepted a professorship in the University of Bologna and in a few years alas the transformation had been wrought and his winged Pegasus was hardly distinguishable from the average academic cart horse Carducci took to imitating classical forms he peopled his verse with a forgotten mythology and although he was too great a man ever to become insincere the stream of his inspiration grew too thin to sweep along the heavy litter of superimposed scholarship There are many who far from sharing this opinion date the real Carducci from the Odi Barbare but if fire and passion are the just prerogatives of verse the reviewer submits that such early pieces as the hyman To Satan celebrating the triumph of Reason over Superstition and Per Giuseppe Honti e Gaetano Tognetti which blasts the Vatican into a nameless shame are worth more than several volumes of nobly reserved Alcaic and Sapphic stanzas In any case the patriotic verse of the youthful Carducci has the feel of molten metal and when in what we will call his professorial period his poetry acquires a sudden glow the occasion is usually supplied by a return to the old theme of freedom and Italy  Because the American reader is sure to feel himself nearer to the red blooded young Carducci than to the high minded excessively Olympian old man it is to be regretted   Reviews  that so many of the editor translator s selections confess the classical spirit But even here Carducci is far from negligible being from first to last an oak hearted son of the Italian mother earth of whom it may be said and of how many poets besides that he never penned a line that did not express an absolute conviction F S  The Ride Home by Florence Wilkinson Evans Hough  ton Mifflin Co  Mrs Evans is a painter poet for the best of her poems  are pictures and the best of her pictures are those in  which the artist follows her fancy most freely She paints  in rainbow colors like Childe Hassam and like him also  she catches the glamour the aura around the figure  or landscape she is studying expresses something of the  whimsical the magical in whatever attracts her keen  interpretive glance For her gaze is not straitly serious  nor yet roundly humorous when she is most herself that  is but a bit sidelong shrewd or tender gay or pitying  according to the emotion of the moment  The book with its nearly four hundred pages and a  third as many titles is far too long of course indeed it is  a flagrant case of excess for less than half its bulk would  give room enough for the poet and would banish the moral  ist and the Tennysonian dramatist Mrs Evans passion  ate pity for the oppressed becomes poetry in The Milliner s  Apprentice The Flower Factory and that series of pic  tures from POETRY Our Lady of Idleness but it is mere   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  preaching in Children of the Belated Lands The Music  Hall Fifth Avenue and others  Even without its failures and half successes the book has more variety of mood and subject than most of its contemporaries  I can be whatever I choose beneath the sun  A beast or a mountain spring or an arrogant emperor thus the poet sings in Self and though one may question her power wholly to escape her own personality and sex yet she has a far roaming fancy and a woman s intuition for feeling and character lifting now and then into high motion  Inheritors of an undreamed element Transfigured glowing near together we went Ourselves grown mystic and magnificent  Mrs Evans is at her best in such self studies as Self and Motherhood the latter a really fresh treatment of a hack neyed subject in emotional and descriptive poems like The Ride Home A Roman Garden The Stranger in the House and the very beautiful Memorial Tablet in character studies like The Outcast Pedro at the Spring The Baker s Boy The Innocent in such half told tales as White Azenor and in vivid little pictures like The Nightingale Fireflies Waterfalls Ecstasies  Any of these might be quoted as typical but no one or  two of them would be adequate Here is one stanza from  Motherhood  The shimmer of poplars by still streams of France All rapture stored   Reviews  In the blue shadow of a jacinth bank Ruins of towers an army s glittering rank Pale effigies of lady and of lord Cathedral dusks all these shalt thou inherit For these have I adored  And The Music at Saint Sulpice is a perfect bit of  imagery  It streams from nowhere  Fills the air Booms like the thunder of a sea That washes up invisibly  Having no shore As if the pillars and the gloom The spaces vast The height the strength the jeweled bloom Made themselves audible at last  H M  Challenge by Louis Untermeyer The Century Co  One need not object to a poet s philosophy if he can get it across if in other words his expression of it is poetry Mr Untermeyer feels  A myriad urges in one rushing wave  and calls us To Arms in the following strenuous lines  Who can be listless in these stirring hours When with athletic courage we engage To storm with fierce abandon sterner powers And meet indifference with a joyful rage  But the more he sets his arrogant and stubborn will  upon these labors of Mars firing his impetuously arrogant spirit and braggart blood to   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  assail with raging mirth The scornful and untroubled skies The cold complacency of earth  the more eagerly do Apollo and the muses take to their heels leaving their deserted votary to the conventional trappings and claptrap utterances of the god of war  Mr Untermeyer has been too devoted a student and critic of poetry to ask us to forgive such worn or tawdry phrases as those above quoted or others like vigorous discontent torpid ease visions girt with beauty the deathless urge shall stir me always Go struggling upward  passionate and proud revealment or details of these quatrains Make way for Her For the fervor of Life For the passions that stir For the courage of Strife My eager faith would keep me set Against despair and careless hate Knowing this smoke and sweat Is forging something violent and great  This sort of thing may be valor but all the zeal of ten thousand reformers could not make it poetry It would be negligible if it were not symptomatic of a red blood disease which impels certain of our poets to sing with the good right arm instead of the voice Muscle is not magic and art may not be achieved by brawn alone  But occasionally when Mr Untermeyer takes his mission more lightly or forgets it altogether his shy muse comes   Reviews  back and gives him a poem Only twice does she fall in with his civic ardor once rather reluctantly in A Voice from the Sweatshops and again more eagerly in the light irony of Battlecries The bitterness of Irony is rather in conflict with the poet s militancy usually defiant even of death itself but it becomes more poetic  In The Subway and How Much of Godhood Mr Untermeyer succeeds in suggesting phases of the prodigious poetry of modern science Feuerzauber is a vivid picture also Haunted except for the last stanza and In the Streets and Folk song are tender and lyrical But the finest poem in the book is probably The Shell to the Pearl or rather the following first half thereof for the second half becomes almost melodrama  Grow not so fast glow not so warm Thy hidden fires burn too wild Too perfect is thy rounded form  Cling close my child  Be yet my babe rest quiet when The great sea urges beat and call Too soon wilt thou be ripe for men The world and all  Thy shining skin thy silken sheath These will undo thee all too soon And men will fight for thee beneath Some paler moon  Aye thou my own my undefiled Shalt make the lewd world dream and start When they have seized and torn thee child Out of my heart  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NOTES  Mr James Stephens now a resident of Paris is a well known Irish writer of tales and poems His books of verse

Here are two kinds of patriotism the jingorism of a flag waving mob and that love of country which demands that the country shall act with justice toward its weaker neighbors By condemning a needless war of annexation a patriot of this latter sort loses his seat in Parliament and the love of his wife and is finally killed by an enraged mob But his memory is afterward honored by a statue erected to one who was faithful to his ideal  60 cents net postage extra  THE FUGITIVE  Written with a simple directness which gives it unassisted by stage effects a clean forceful grip upon the reader s mind

beginning  _ _ to  Name  Address The Spinning Woman of the Sky  By ALICE CORBIN  Chicago is beginning to throb with art impulses and promises to develop a real intellectual center that will make New York and Boston and Philadelphia look to their laurels In doing so it should keep its civic eye on Alice Corbin whose volume of verse recently published contains real poetic stuff Current Opinion  She sings only of what she knows and understands And often youth is piteously wise wise with a clairvoyant lucidity Her note is strong and clear with that deep gentle wisdom of a child In Grey Woods she voices all the ascendant yearning of her soul The International  If Alice Corbin is still young and this seems probable it is by no means certain that she will not do excellent things after life has sufficiently maltreated her The Minneapolis Journal  Her lyrics are not easily reducible to any form of intellectual statement The Dial  Far above the plain of ordinary writers she seems ever on the point of ascending to that height where the really great poets abide The Chicago Tribune  Occasionally indeed the poems always graceful and charming are a little vague and ephemeral in structure some of them resemble delicate Japanese prints in this regard The Chicago Record Herald  Paper covers 60 cents  Published by Ralph Fletcher Seymour 1025 Fine Arts Building Chicago    The Little Review
