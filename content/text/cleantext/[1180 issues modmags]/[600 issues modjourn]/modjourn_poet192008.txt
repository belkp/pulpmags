feel of spurs of steel As they graze along each side En Bugger pulled up his chaps a hole For he was the next to ride  We knew he d strike we knew he d bite We knew he d kick and rear So we grabbed his ears en held his head Till Bugger got up near  235  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He stepped into the saddle En hollered Let im go We jerked the blinder from his eyes Then stopped to watch the show  You ve all heard of pitchin horses From Steamboat down the line Old Barometer en Step Fast En a mare they called Divine  Old Prickly Pear en Pizen Lop Ears en Stingaree They all wuz Shetland ponies Side this horse from Santa Fe  We asked Red in tones solicitous If he had made his will Had he any girl in Texas Who really loved him still  Was there any parting message That he would like to send To some one in his old old home Who still might be his friend  Who was his pet undertaker What parson should we get Would he have flowers on his coffin I can hear old Bugger yet  236  N Howard Thorp

ones a lift Throwin em back on the home range each day in a different place In slickers en leggins of leather through sand storms that blister your face  Boss in the ranch house rides easy his days of

Raid of Seventy three Then he married en got him religion en tells you how you mustn t do wrong How a brand is the cow man s protection then he ll deal you a gospel song  But I ll tell you Old Hank was the slickest that ever laid line on a steer Or burnt over a brand with a runnin iron or worked on an old cow s ear Course friends all this talk s confidential I wouldn t want Old Hank to see That

Worth some fifteen thousand dollars say maybe you think I ve lied But the handle was plumb covered with diamonds of all size En she d glitter en she d glisten es she hung down from his side  You could have bought his whole darned outfit fer a yearlin steer or two Hat boots overalls en chaps there was nothin that was  new Lived down in a dug out on jus sour dough bread en beef En was just about es happy es a Choctaw Indian chief  Figured he had ten thousand cattle en the whole wide range  was his En if he wanted a good six shooter it was no one else s biz So when he shipped a train er steers to Chicago late one  fall En was strollin on up State Street he thought he d make a call  On the biggest jewelry outfit that kept gaudy things to wear But when he asked for a six shooter the Jew clerk began to stare Yes we ve got one that was ordered for a bloomin English lord But I reckon from your outfit it s a gun you can t afford  241  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It will cost you fifteen thousand Says Old Tom Just give her here You counter jumpin goniff En he grabbed him by the ear En he peeled off fifteen thousand to the Hebrew standing there Sayin Don t judge western cow men by the outfits that they wear  LIGHT STRANGER LIGHT  For this is the law of the western range When a stranger hails in sight Just tie up your hoss in the old corral En light stranger light  Tis a land of

pathos A glamour of the West Round the names of women outlaws Who have now gone to their rest  Broncho Sue Belle Star and Shudders  Pike Kate and Altar Doane Calamity Jane Sister Cummings And the Rose of Cimmaron  You ve all oft heard the saying I d go to Hell for you About these women outlaws That saying was too true  Each left her home and dear one For the man she loved the best Close by his side on many a wild ride Through the mountains of the West  They ve played their parts in western drama On the great un screened western stage  43  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Where the mountains were their platform Their stage setting rocks and sage  Hunted by many a posse Always on the run Every man s hand against them They fought and often won  With a price upon each head They d have to fight and stand And die as game as any man With a gun in either hand  My hat off to you women outlaws For you did what you thought best And the same wild blood that coursed your veins Has settled up the West  Whether right or wrong your spirit Knew not the word of fear And tis the dauntless courage of your kind That bred the pioneer  OLD PAINT  Every time I see an old paint horse I think of you Old Paint horse of mine that used to be Old pal o mine that was the best horse of all because That s why old horse at last I set you free  244  N Howard Thorp  I ve bought em by the thousand I ve owned em everywhere There s one stands out among em all alone Paint marked everywhere tail a little short of hair Old horse you never failed to bring me home  Member when they stole you from Pass City En locked you up inside the Juarez jail Said that you had eaten up an entire crop of wheat En I had to rustle round en get your bail  En I got you cross the river en matched you in a race En we bet the last red dollar we could scrape En how you bit old Rocking Chair the horse you run against En made him turn his head en lose the race  We was both young en foolish in them green days long ago I don t believe in telling stories out of school Member when we roped the pianner en jerked her out the door Hush up Old Paint you re talkin like a fool  Well old horse you re buried en your troubles they are done But I often sit en think of what we did En recall the many scrapes we had en used to think it fun  Es we rode along the Rio Grande Good bye old Kid 245  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WHAT S BECOME OF THE PUNCHERS  What s become of the punchers We rode with long ago The hundreds and hundreds of cowboys We all of us used to know  Sure some were killed by lightning Some when the cattle run Others were killed by horses And some with the old six gun  Those that worked on the round up Those of the branding pen Those who went out on the long trail drive And never returned again  We know of some who have prospered We hear of some who are broke My old pardner made millions in Tampa While I ve got my saddle in soak  Sleeping and working together Eating old Cussie s good chuck Riding in all kinds of weather Playing in all kinds of luck  Bragging about our top hosses Each puncher ready to bet  246  N Howard Thorp  His horse could outrun the boss s Or any old hoss you could get  Scott lies in Tularosa Elmer Price lies near Santa Fe While Randolph sits here by the fire side With a flat face on his knee  Gene Rhodes is among the high brows A writin up the West But I know a lot of doin s That he never has confessed  He used to ride em keerless In the good old days When we both worked together In the San Andrays  Building big loops we called blockers Spinning the rope in the air Never a cent in our pockets But what did a cow puncher care  I m tired of riding this trail boys Dead tired of riding alone B lieve I ll head old Button for Texas Towards my old Palo Pinto home  N Howard

came down from Cundiyo Upon the road to Chimayo  I met three women walking Each held a sorrow to her breast And one of them a small cross pressed  Three black shawled women walking  Now why is it that you must go Up the long road to Cundiyo  The old one did the talking I go to bless a dying son And I a sweetheart never won  Three women slowly walking  The third one opened wide her shawl And showed a new born baby small  That slept without a sorrow And I in haste that we be wed Too late too late if he be dead  The Padre comes tomorrow  As I went up to Cundiyo In the grey dawn from Chimayo  I met three women walking And over paths of sand and rocks Were men who carried a long box  Beside three women walking  262  Alice Corbin  PETROLINO S COMPLAINT  The old ways have changed since you walked here But worst of all is the way the people have become They have no hearts and their minds are like putty And if you ask for conversation they might as well be dumb  Though I am old and my sight is not good And I don t hear as well muy verdad as some With my stick I can walk faster than many And my mind travels faster than a man s with no tongue  The young have no thought for their elders Their ranches are now no bigger than your thumb The young men work in the mines in Colora o Or they sit and warm their stomachs in the sun  The girls spend their money on big hats and velvet But when they would marry they haven t the sum And the old songs and dances are forgotten As the Saints will be forgotten if they go on as they ve begun  I have gone looking through hillsides and canyons Through all the placitas where we used to run But the old ways have changed since you walked here And a goat is more sociable than a man that is dumb  Alice Corbin  263  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  THE FOLK POETRY OF THESE STATES  OLK poetry in the United States has followed the trail of the pioneer The first songs sung in this country were of course to follow first the Anglo Saxon lineage the traditional English hymns ballads and songs brought from the mother country and still to be found by devoted students of folk song in the isolated regions still inhabited by Anglo Saxon descendants Following these came the native Yankee ballads the pure home spun narratives and songs the reader is referred to The Journal of American Folk Lore of which Yankee Doodle is perhaps the most popularly known James Russell Lowell synthesized the Yankee elements of these ballads and the Yankee character in The Biglow Papers his surest claim to immortality and became what we may call the first sophisticated American folk poet as Charles Godfrey Leland with his popular portrayal of the Pennsylvania Dutch in the Hans Breitmann Ballads 1868 was the second Meanwhile the pioneer was moving westward and in 1871 John Hay published his Pike County Ballads including Jim Bludso of the Prairie Belle and other folk narratives of Indiana and Illinois life Jim Bludso it will be remembered held his burning river steamer against the bank until the last passenger got ashore  And they all had trust in his cussedness And knowed he would keep his word  264  The Folk Poetry of These States  And sure s you re born they all got off Afore the smokestacks fell And Bludso s soul went up alone In the smoke of the Prairie Belle The same year saw the publication of the East and West Poems by Bret Harte the first pioneer poet of the Far West who extended the boundary of our folk poetry from the Atlantic to the Pacific precisely as this extension was typified by the meeting of the two engines of the first transcontinental railroad celebrated in one of the poems in this volume The types portrayed in Bret Harte s ballads were adventurous fortune seekers usually transplanted easterners who in the ruggedness of pioneer life took on a primitive simplicity and directness in keeping with the primitive experience But the pioneer wave having gone as far west as possible in the rush for gold turned backward to those lands of the South west the Rocky Mountain region and the Great Plateau where cattle became the dominant motive in the quest for fortune and in the songs of western cowboys we have the next contribution to our native folk poetry  Some of these were examples of what we may call the instinctive unconscious strain of naive folk song and some of the more sophisticated type as shown in the later development of cowboy songs by men like Charles Badger Clark Henry Herbert Knibbs and others Meanwhile the more domesticated Middle West was celebrated in the folk songs of James Whitcomb Riley whose claim upon the affections of such a large body of readers is due to the  265  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  pure folk quality of his ballads Eugene Field too is another poet of the Middle West whose songs of childhood have a genuine folk spirit  Such broadly speaking and with unavoidable omissions is the course of our native folk poetry of Anglo Saxon stock of purely native origin and owing little or nothing to an inherited literary tradition  When we approach the South we must recognize a strain which is not of Anglo Saxon origin either racially or traditionally and yet must be regarded as purely native for the Negro influence in the Negro dialect poems of Thomas Nelson Page or Joel Chandler Harris is not an alien influence The Negro spirituals and plantation songs constituting a large body of indigenous folk song are certainly not African They are written in English and they are saturated with the soil of this continent and with our religion which the American Negro has made his own adding to it his own intensity his own imaginative fervor and richness of concrete imagery  As the Negro has absorbed us so we have absorbed him His songs of which he borrowed the inspiration from us now belong to us quite as much as to him perhaps more since the Negro is losing his native strain of song as rapidly as the white man is taking it up We may therefore claim the Negro songs and spirituals as a part of our store of native folk song just as we claim the poems in Negro dialect by Thomas Nelson Page or Joel Chandler Harris who picked up the thread where the primitive Negro poet  266  The Folk Poetry of These States  dropped it to be followed by the Negro poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar who it is significant to note adopted the manner of these poets in writing songs of his race The latest American poet to develop an inspiration furnished by Negro influence is of course Vachel Lindsay who has improvised upon Negro themes precisely as the sophisticated musician improvises upon folk melodies The argument that the Negro element is not a native folk influence in his work is of course untenable and the genuine folk quality in his Negro poems is indisputable  We have another body of indigenous folk poetry in the United States which is not of racially Anglo Saxon or European stock but which is unquestionably native This is the primitive poetry of the American Indian This has not become so domesticated in our blood as has the Negro folk song In fact only recently has the beauty of this poetry begun to be recognized through linguists who have given us literal renditions of Indian songs with a simplicity as direct as that of Mr Arthur Waley s translations from the Chinese and Japanese or through the translations or original songs based upon Indian themes by poets who have been influenced by direct contact with Indian life Although the American poet and the Indian poet belong to races and civilizations as distinctly different as the Occident and the Orient which according to Kipling never meet but according to actual experience are constantly meeting the Indian influence on the American poet is native and of the soil  267  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Whenever two civilizations or races impinge upon one another whatever is absorbed from either by the other ceases to be alien At least the alien element ceases to be alien precisely in proportion as it is assimilated and recreated As Ernest Fenollosa has pointed out it has never been sufficiently realized how much the alien is at the root of the national We may therefore while recognizing the distinctly racial roots justly claim as belonging to our body of native folk poetry not only the Indian originals but also the work of such poets as Constance Lindsay Skinner Mary Austin Lew Sarett and others in whom the Indian influence is derived from direct contact with Indian life rather than from a literary tradition or source Incidentally it is amusing to reflect how much our proverbial conception of the Indian is based upon the literary and romantically fictive character created by Longfellow and James Fenimore Cooper Finally we may say that an arbitrary pedagogical barrier placed about Indian motives and labelled as alien will not avail Contact itself will break down such arbitrary barriers and where the barriers have been broken down the Indian influence ceases to be alien and becomes a part of our native folk inheritance  This article is necessarily a mere brief and hasty summary but we may hope that it will enlarge the boundaries of our recognized national indigenous sources Much could be written of the folk poetry of our European immigrants but these like the folk songs of the original settlers or of their Anglo Saxon descendants in the Southern Appalachians  268  The Folk Poetry of These States  are inherited and traditional and do not spring from our own soil An exception might possibly be made in favor of the Spanish folk songs of the South west as these are of native rather than traditional source and spring from three centuries direct contact with the soil Also one might include the native Creole songs of Louisiana Lafcadio Hearn I believe translated some of these and Charles  F Lummis and others have made translations of both the indigenous and traditional Spanish folk songs of the Southwest All these furnish native folk nutriment for our poetic soil  It may be that the folk spirit is a necessary sub soil for any fine national poetic flowering It is certain at least that many of our contemporary poets are searching out the native sources of our life as well as of our poetry for the inspiration of their own The soil has to be turned over we have to examine our roots to know what they are It would be interesting if there were space to trace the folk spirit in the work of certain contemporary poets who may or may not have been conscious of this source of power in the Ballad of John Evereldown and other poems by Edwin Arlington Robinson in many poems by Robert Frost for example Brown s Descent which might easily pass as one of the early Yankee ballads in Edgar Lee Masters Christmas at Indian Point Steam shovel Cut Johnny Appleseed  and other middle western narratives a strain which the critics seem to have overlooked in this poet s later work It is in the point of view as well as in the letter that the  269  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  folk spirit betrays itself and the point of view of these men has much of it One feels it also as the implied background of Carl Sandburg s Cornhuskers and as the conscious motive of Edwin Ford Piper s Barbed Wire  For the folk spirit shows itself not only in the unconscious naivete of the instinctive and sometimes unlettered poet it is a conscious flowering as well If any one doubts it he has only to turn to The Ancient Mariner or La Belle Dame sans Merci these had a folk tradition back of them Traced to a remote beginning far beyond Sir Patrick Spens or The Faerie Queene the folk tradition may have been as crude as our western cowboy songs or Jim Bludso of the Prairie Belle Refinement is a matter of time sometimes centuries The important thing is to preserve the folk spirit and to recognize it first of all  That we have failed to recognize its existence in our country is largely due to the fact that students of folk song have placed a greater emphasis on the survivals of traditional English ballads in our remote mountain regions than on the more truly native and indigenous material that is all around us which has been overlooked simply because of its more obvious familiarity and its lack of literary ancestry But someone has to start a tradition and the American folk poets have done it  Objections may be raised to the broad inclusiveness of the term folk poetry as used in this article and it may be necessary to re define folk poetry to some extent before meeting these objections Folk poetry in the narrowest  270  The Folk Poetry of These States  sense is of course poetry composed and sung or recited by the people poetry that comes from an unsophisticated source or poetry that is purely instinctive and unconscious to borrow a term used by Mr Percy Grainger in his distinction between the music of primitive people and that of people who possess a knowledge of musical notation But the fact of an oral rather than a written or printed tradition sometimes a distinguishing mark of folk poetry is not in itself definitive since much folk poetry is of known authorship and widely distributed in printed form witness the old English and Irish Broad Sheets and Chap Books Nor is it essential that the folk poet be illiterate or unsophisticated we recognize Burns as a folk poet just as we know that John Milton is not one When a folk poet becomes sufficiently well known to have his own personality established in our minds we forget the class to which his work belongs and think of his songs in relation to himself This of course is what has happened to Riley Lowell and the other sophisticated folk poets named above  In our country the general distribution of the printed page has blinded us to the essentially native folk spirit of much of our poetry Although this very dissemination of print has destroyed to a certain degree that provincial seclusion which formerly fostered folk poetry it has at the same time created a vast audience and tended to enlarge our consciousness and give us folk songs of a more general and familiar appeal so general and familiar indeed that we have failed to recognize their peculiar significance as  271  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  genuine expressions of the folk spirit By recognizing this spirit in much of our poetry however we may be able to make a new classification simplifying the position of much verse which has a very real claim as folk poetry upon the affections of that large body of people to whom it appeals  Something should be said too concerning the use of dialect by our folk poets It has been too readily assumed that dialect is a distinctive mark of American folk poetry It takes more than dialect to make a folk poet and as a matter of fact its use has been perhaps a greater stumbling block than help if not to the poet at least to our recognition of him as a folk poet Idiom is a finer and less crude test of the poet than dialect a fact discovered by the poets of our generation noted above This too is an indication that our folk tradition is in process of growth and development  Of course it is often assumed that we have no tradition folk or otherwise But this assumption is usually made by those who are uninformed visiting Irish or Englishmen or Europeans who have never set foot in our country or Americans who have failed to consider the evidence or have been blind to its significance because of its very familiarity  The subject is of course capable of much more extensive treatment than is afforded by this bare outline which is meant to be suggestive rather than definitive The trail of the pioneer by which we traced the course of the folk tradition in this country has returned upon itself Culture has become intensive rather than expansive and the tradi  272  The Folk Poetry of These States  tions far from being non existent or lost are only just now beginning to receive their due recognition and appreciation The poet who fails to perceive this is losing half his heritage Our roots are double On one side we have the heritage of classic English tradition why it is assumed that we do not share in this equally with our English contemporaries it is hard to see and on the other hand we have a store of native tradition and experience which belongs to us alone Manifestly it would be a mistake to ignore either as it is a mistake to emphasize one at the expense of the other A C H  REVIEWS  MR LOMAX S SECOND ANTHOLOGY  Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp by John A Lo  max Macmillan Co  This book a companion volume to the earlier Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads represents a secondary stage in the development of cowboy songs which are generally speaking of two types first songs transmitted by purely oral tradition and second songs originally clipped from a local newspaper or magazine fitted to a familiar air and so handed down from one cowboy to another becoming genuine folk songs in the process In this book the majority of the songs are of the second class many of them having achieved the dignity of book publication before Mr  273  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Lomax as he says lifted them for his collection This does not of course lessen their genuine folk quality since many of them were first known to Mr Lomax through local cowboy versions But it does increase the editor s responsibility to the authors and we suggest that a bibliography should have been included Henry Herbert Knibbs Charles Badger Clark Arthur Chapman and Larry Chittendon have all published books of their own a fact of which the reader should be fully informed  Mr Lomax gives two instances of the cowboys reshaping of songs in the two versions of Mr Clark s Just a Ridin and The Glory Trail The cowboy version of the latter furnished by Mr Knibbs was printed under the Southern Arizona title of High Chin Bob in the August 1917 number of POETRY This process of change and growth should be interesting to students as illustrating one theory perhaps the most plausible of the origin of folk song The song according to this theory is in the first place of individual authorship and it becomes a folk song through the continuous use and reshaping of many minds Most of the songs in Mr Lomax s earlier books are anonymous or their authorship is remembered by only a few old timers but they like these later songs of known origin were unquestionably also of individual authorship  Certain experts especially the English or Irish have complained that our western cowboy songs suffer because of the lack of an inherited literary tradition Mr Cecil J Sharp who has collected survivals of English folk songs in the  274  Mr Lomax s Second Anthology  southern Appalachians says The cowboy has been despoiled of his inheritance of traditional song he has nothing behind him To this one might reply that however much or little he has behind him the important thing is to recognize how much he has made of the life around him how perfectly fitted the song is to the soil from which it springs One can hardly say as much for the mountaineer of the southern Appalachians who with his inherited literary stock has created comparatively little that is immediately his own What one appreciates in the survivals of the old English folk songs is precisely the literary association with which we are all familiar But the association of cowboy songs is directly local and perhaps these can be appreciated fully only by one who is familiar with the life that has produced  them Certainly they appeal to a large public  It is quite true that the cowboy s world is less imaginary than actual It is not peopled with fairies or ghostly apparitions a fact apparently lamented by Mr Sharp but with characters quite as significant heroic or tragic as Willie Reilly Lord Ronald or Barbara Allen It is no false note for the cowboy to write of dying long horns or herds of buffalo instead of wounded stags in green glades and knights in steel armor The armor of the cowboy is his own and he celebrates it chaps slicker spurs saddle and horse His life is cattle and those who think his adventures prosaic overlook the hidden romance the lonely and tragic events of the round up the long trail drive and the night watch  275  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  When the cowboy writes of himself it is to contrast the loneliness and wildness of his life with the gentler culture he has forsaken for most of these men came from the East and not a few from England To think as Mr Sharp seems to that these poets sing only in the strain of I m a poor lonesome cowboy is to miss the objective ballad quality of such songs as The Bull whacker The Buffalo Hunters The Old Chisholm Trail The Crooked Road to Holbrook The Zebra Dun Little Jo the Wrangler and to overlook entirely those outlaw frontier ballads of Jesse James Cole Younger Sam Bass Utah Carroll or Billy the Kid which have for the sons of western pioneers an appeal far more immediate than the Robin Hood ballads  Whenever the cowboy poet deserts the actual world and seeks to escape into an imaginary world which Mr Sharp says is the mark of the folk poet it is to dream of a cowboy heaven There is a constant return to this theme Through the long night watches the cowboy poet looks up to the stars very near and living presences in the clear atmosphere of the West and wonders about the hereafter in terms amusingly translated from his daily occupation  And I m scared that I ll be a stray yearling  A maverick unbranded on high  And get cut in the bunch with the rusties  When the Boss of the Riders goes by  He carries the same terminology into his courtship songs and thereby creates a new idiom About this idiom he is far more exacting than about any question of rhyme or meter  276  Mr Lomax s Second Anthology  and the tenderfoot who essays to enter this field is at once detected by departures from the correct lingo or by an amateurish way of handling the various leathers  One must remember of course that the cowboy songs are comparatively recent a half century is perhaps the extreme limit of their antiquity whereas the English folksongs have had the traditional shaping of many generations the forms in which they have finally come down to us being perhaps much finer than their possibly crude beginnings Under our modern conditions one can not presage a like shaping and remolding of these folk songs of the West Railroads and aeroplanes move too swiftly to allow a slow secluded maturing such as the older folk songs had and the cowboy himself is disappearing Yet in the hands of later men poets who have shared the cowboy s life or come immediately after him some of this reshaping is taking place What the final result may be it is too soon to say but meanwhile we may be well content to accept these songs for what they are naive records of the hard and free life on the range including in their homely recitatives many sharply dramatic incidents no less dramatic for being obscure and much good humored as well as grimly sardonic humor And incidentally the western cowboy songs represent a distinct contribution to our native folk poetry one no less significant because it creates a new tradition instead of reflecting a tradition of the past  A C H  277  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IMMIGRATION AND

It is a pity that Dr Goldberg has not pursued throughout his Studies the plan of quoting the original Spanish and following it by textual translation His book is more than a volume of critical essays it is the history of a literature almost unknown to the English reader and it pretends to be also an anthology of characteristic selections from the verse of Dario Rodo Chocano Eguren and Blanco Fom bona As a matter of fact most of these selections are given in the crude verse of Miss Alice Stone Blackwell who in 1896 published an anthology of Armenian Poems In the present case as in that she would seem to have made verse versions from a literal prose translation and to have been ignorant of the original a method dangerously unscholarly and in this case unjustified by even a rudimentary rhythmic instinct The quality of her work is sufficiently indicated by the quotation of three lines  What thing than the lily unstained is more white More pure than the mystic wax taper so bright More chaste than the orange flower tender and fair  Poetic diction for her seems to consist of archaisms inversions and echoes of that volume s phraseology which more than Kipling or Mother Goose has corrupted the popular taste in poetry the Hymnal How far her awkward jingles misrepresent the originals she is pretending to translate may easily be guessed after a comparison of her versions with the  280  South American Poetry  literal translations of Dr Goldberg himself His scholarship gives us the most of the poet and I had almost said the least of the translator But the height of the translator s art is clarity lucidity Dr Goldberg offers his utmost not his least when he is most invisible most transparent to the images of Dario or Rodo or Eguren In eleven pages of prose translation he has probably given a better idea of the new Spanish American verse than in all the metrical versions with which the three hundred sixty preceding pages of the book are sprinkled By quoting the Spanish as well he has enabled the reader to enjoy the melody of the original a thing not even suggested by a crude aping of rhyme schemes and metrical patterns A few examples of his work will suffice The first is Dario s Campoamor  Este del cabello cano Como la piel del armino Junta su candor de ni√±o Con su experiencia de anciano Cuendo se tiene en la mano Un libro de tel baron Abeja es cada expression Que volando del papel Deja en los labios la miel Y pica en el coraz√≥n  This sage with hair as white as ermine merged his childhood candor with his old age s experience When you hold such a man s book in your hands each expression is a bee which flying from the paper leaves its honey on your lips and its sting in your heart  This is an early poem which won for Dario then a young journalist in Valparaiso a prize of two hundred pesos It is an excellent imitation of the style of the poet in whose  281  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  honor it was written The very form of the poem gives life to the idea it expresses Other fragments of translation I quote for brevity s sake without the Spanish  Was it perchance in the North or in the South I do not know the day or the season but I know that Eulalia still laughs and her golden laughter is cruel and eternal  Are you an artist I disfigure you Are you worthy I criticize you I abhor you if you are rich And if you are poor I stone you And pillaging honor And wounding everything in sight It appears certain That man is a wolf to man  In these translations as in the pages of history and criticism the student of modern poetry seeks something novel something distinctively Spanish American So far as one can judge however by the material made available this novelty is just the thing that is lacking Much may have been done we have it on Dr Goldberg s word as a scholar that much has been done by these young American writers to refresh the language of old Spain and to give to the forms of old Spanish verse a newer grace and freedom The trouble is that the Modernista renovation seems to have refreshed style only To thought and imagery these poets of greater Spain seem to have contributed nothing They have indeed imported much that is Parisian into Spanish verse they have aped the Parnassians and the Symbolist decadents but they have apparently done nothing but ape  282  South American Poetry  The rich mass of material distinctively Spanish or Spanish American seems to lie untouched while these exponents of modern verse sing of poets lovers sweethearts old men love death as sentimentally and as vaguely as if all about them did not live and breathe a reality infinitely picturesque and almost untouched as material for poetry It is maddening to hear a poet sentimentalize over Naxos when he should be interpreting Nicaragua  Is South America then invisible to the South Americans that they sing the tediously classic Mediterranean and antiquated Olympus instead of the South Atlantic and the Andes If so the eclecticism of South American poetry looks dangerously like aimless imitation  Grant H Code  WALEY ON THE UTA  Japanese Poetry the Uta by Arthur Waley Clarendon  Press Oxford England Moons of Nippon by Edna Worthley Underwood Ralph Fletcher Seymour Chicago Arthur Waley s Japanese Poetry is to a Japanese a series  of pleasant surprises and disappointments As a western student of the Japanese classical language Mr Waley seems to be a wonder what he offers us here has never been attempted before But whether he understands Japanese poetry or not is a question The book is a good dictionary and an aid to the grammatical study of the Japanese classical poems  283  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The book contains almost two hundred old uta a form of Japanese poetry with a grammatical foot note to each and a translation As the author reminds us the uta consists of five lines arranged in 5 7 5 7 7 syllables This form of poetry was written as a part of the naga uta long song and was called tanka short song previous to the eighth century during which period the Japanese poets dropped the longer part and ventured on the tanka as an independent poem Ever since the thirty one syllable uta has been the standard  In the introductory chapter Mr Waley writes the history of Japanese poetry in a scholarly manner He says The naga uta long songs of Manyo were an unsuccessful experiment The Japanese poets quickly realized that they had no genius for extended composition etc Perhaps Mr Waley overlooked the jorori biwa uta and the noh plays In the western conception of poetry these are poems and I do not hesitate to class some of biwa uta with the most beautiful English lyrics Probably it did not occur to him that long compositions were distasteful to the Japanese poets so that they simply did not call them poems  Indeed to the Japanese poets thirty one syllables were a little too long to be a good form so during the seventeenth century they preferred three lines seventeen syllables and called the form a senriu or a hokku according to the kind of mood it creates  Dragon fly Catcher by the lady Chiyo which has been translated so often into English is a good example of the  284  Waley on the Uta  hokku She writes of the death of her only son before her eyes still flickers the vision of a happy child dancing after a dragon fly The tragic mood of the mother s wandering mind after her child s death is successfully created by seven words five hundred words would not have created so vivid a mood as these seven And Mr Waley says  It might have been expected that the Japanese having confined themselves for centuries to the five line uta would at length have grown impatient of its restrictions and embarked on wider seas Paradoxically they pursued an opposite course The five lines were contracted to three lines and the hokku became the standard metre etc  I do not wonder that this step seems a paradox to Mr Waley It is fortunate that he did not translate the hokku  A little potted flower six lights shine within as Mr Noguchi describes the hokku the combination of seven or eight words creating the immeasurable mood of nature or of the highest tension of human emotion this is Japanese poetry Therefore the Japanese poets carefully select the creative and suggestive words avoiding all descriptive words The change of one syllable out of the thirty one without changing the meaning may destroy the poem A successful translation is impossible The following is an example from the book  1 Naiva no ura ni On the shore of Nawa  2 Shiivo yaku keburi The smoke of the saltbnrners  3 Yu sareba When evening comes 4 Yuki sugi kanete Failing to get across 5 Yama ni tanabiku Trails over the mountain  285  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Reading the translation one wonders what it is all about It has completely lost its original identity yet no better translation could be made from word to word The saltburners might be taken for witches or similar creatures by the reader but they are peasants who manufacture salt from salt water and live a very simple life  In the original I feel the quietude of a spring evening The heavy steamy smoke from the saltburners huts drawing lines slowly trails toward the mountain and settles into one stratum across its middle There is a suggestion of a calm sea a mirror like sheet of water without a stir of air perhaps a boat or two with its sail flapping going nowhere as evening gradually closes in With this setting as a background the poem creates the mood of the simple village life It is something akin to The curfew tolls the knell of parting day However the Japanese poet does not go into the description of a graveyard or get sentimental over would be heroes and poets He simply takes you there and puts you in the mood so that you can stretch your imagination as far as you please  Mr Waley truly says The translations in this book are chiefly intended to facilitate the study of the Japanese text for Japanese poetry can only be rightly enjoyed in the original So instead of trying to give poetry in a translation which so many bad poets have tried and failed to do he makes a strenuous grammatical study of the poems and inserts foot notes which may assist students Besides this one chapter is devoted to notes on grammar which are as  286  Waley on the Uta  accurate as in a Japanese text To a poet who is interested in Japanese poetry and sincerely desires to study it the value of this book can never be over estimated Thanks are due to Mr Waley for this bridge into an unknown poetic world  Mrs Underwood s Moons of Nippon has a pretty supposed to be Japanese cover design showing a pine tree a large yellow moon and blue waves There are a few pleasing short poems in the volume but I do not know from what language they are derived The author says they are translated from the Japanese Jun Fujita  NEGRO POETS  Fifty Years and Other Poems by James Weldon Johnson

English Poetry by Henry Newbolt E P  Dutton amp Co  Formative Types in English Poetry by George Herbert  Palmer Houghton Mifflin Co  Tw o collections of lectures Th e former is at its best  when on the subjects of Rhythm and Personality Here is  an extract which shows that Mr Newbolt is no advocate of  fixed and unchangeable metrics in poetry but believes like  other progressive minds in perpetual change  Poetic rhythm is not an applied ornament nor the result of a mechanical process nor the fit subject of a pedantic criticism It is on the contrary part of the poet s means of expression and an aid to the communication between spirit and spirit its quality is of a subjective nature and should be studied mainly from a subjective point of view Since poetry is a personal expression and the essence of personality is distinctive the natural tendency of poetic rhythm will be toward perpetual change It is strange that any opinion any feeling however conservative should fight against this for it means that while we keep all that the past has given what we shall receive from the future will be new gifts instead of copies of old ones And whether welcome or unwel  288  Two Essayists  come the historical fact is beyond dispute that our poetry has shown a long continued development of rhythm and always the effort has been toward greater freedom to be used for more complete and natural self expression  The structural value of the book is in its earlier chapters as represented by the above extract The remaining chapters though conceived in a modern liberal spirit constitute but a loose miscellany ranging from Chaucer to Futurism  Professor Palmer s book is the personal excursion of a man who has loved poetry while devoting his life to another specialty and who stakes out his independent course across the field of English verse Chaucer Spenser George Herbert Pope Wordsworth Tennyson Browning Does Chaucer reflect too exclusively the outer world We have Spenser Does Spenser inhabit too persistently a musical dreamland and neglect the individual soul We have Herbert Does Herbert tend to lead us into metaphysical tangles We have Pope Does Pope detain us overlong in the orderly well planned world of the classicists We escape via Wordsworth And so on Marked omissions surely but a chain after a fashion Milton Too big for me says the author modestly And Herbert why so much of him especially when Donne would have served so much better Chiefly because bearing Herbert s name I have had him as a companion throughout my life and have studied him

s collection of Cowboy Songs Chopo The Pecos River Queen Little Jo the Wrangler and Speckles this last printed in Mr Lomax s book under the title of Freckles a Fragment just as it came from the hands of a local printer who had lost half the copy These five songs were first published in Mr Thorp s small book Songs of the Cowboys set up by an Estancia print shop in 1908 a western best seller never recorded in The Publishers Weekly though perhaps the only book of verse which could be said to compete in this respect with the Spoon River Anthology Mr Thorp is an old time cow puncher and cattle man and his songs are the fruit of experience His gift is instinctive like that of all real cow punchers and its charm is precisely in its fresh and indigenous folk quality It is quite unconsciously on Mr Thorp s part that the theme of What s Become of the Punchers presents the age old theme of Villon and more recently of Edgar Lee Masters The theme of course was old when Villon used it and the similarity is mentioned merely because it is interesting to note the fact that some themes no matter what the dress seem to be eternally recurrent  Mr Phil LeNoir was born in New Jersey and went west just before Arizona s anti gambling law went into effect He saw something of the early and wilder life in the mining camps and along the Mexican border and came to know many of the oldtimers He witnessed the first battle of one of the Mexican revolutions For about ten years he was a Y M C A and Chamber of Commerce worker in Arizona New Mexico and Texas and for several years he worked among the punchers riding fence principally as he was not strong enough for the heavier work He was one of the founders of the Las Vegas Cowboys Reunion and was secretary of that organization for several years During the war he was General Secretary of the New Mexico Council of Defense and was also with the army Y M C A at Fort Bliss For the past two years he has lived in Santa Fe  Lucy Eddy Mrs

the following notes on the origin of her New Mexico Folk songs  The Ballad of Macario Romero is translated from a Spanish version recorded by Professor Aurelio M Espinosa who has secured four separate versions of this popular song which has a distinctly typical local flavor The version here translated was recited by a young girl Juanita Lucero of Tafoya New Mexico Chata means pug nosed  Madre Mar√≠a is from a Spanish version secured by Miss Barbara Freire Marreco from an Indian woman at the Santa Clara Pueblo The Indians have preserved many of the traditional and popular Mexican songs This is an old song probably brought to New Mexico by the Spanish padres other versions having been obtained in South America The final stanza is obviously a later addition  Manzanita was given to me by Mrs N Howard Thorp of Santa Fe who remembered it from childhood Chula la Ma√±ana is a free translation of a popular song The word t√≠a means aunt El Coyotito is a translation of the Spanish version in Charles  F Lummis The Land of Poco Tiempo Mr Lummis has himself made an excellent English translation of the song but has left out perhaps judiciously some of the tang  Christ is Born in Bethlehem is a New Mexican nursery rhyme given me by Mrs N Howard Thorp  The brief epigrams known as coplas represent a form of popular improvisation in verse At the country bailes which are strictly chaperoned in old Spanish fashion the couples indulge very little in conversation during the dance for if they talked much they would be thought to be flirting In fact to our notion such an assembly usually seems to be pervaded by a deadly solemnity but when the young man escorts his companion to her seat it is considered highly proper for him to address her in a copla which he has had the skill to improvise or remember Other circumstances also furnish suitable occasions for the use of coplas as may be imagined from those given  Cundiyo and Petrolino s Complaint are poems of my own interpretations of the folk spirit Petrolino is an old blind peddler a familiar figure among the placitas that dot the slopes of the Santa Fe Canyon He carries a stick in one hand with which he taps his way striking it against fence posts and thus making sure that he keeps out of the way of burros and carts in the middle of the road On his other arm he carries a basket containing a small stock of  291  pi√±on nuts needles thread and face powder this last being much in demand by the young Mexican girls whose dusky complexions acquire a distinctly lavender tone under its coating It is said that Petrolino is not quite so blind as he makes out else why should he go peering into windows after nightfall But it is certain that he is very deaf and also that he likes to talk when he finds a listener One of his cronies is a loco in our neighborhood who is usually aimlessly busy herding a few stray goats out on scant pasturage and when the two of them get together for a little rest on the shady side of a corral on a hot summer day their discussions a tanto voce carry far Thus my version of Petrolino s shouted complaint is an almost literal translation  BOOKS RECEIVED  ORIGINAL VERSE  Country Sentiment
