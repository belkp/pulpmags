EditorMargaret Foreign Foreign EditorsIker Jules Romains Anderson John Rodker Advisory Boardjh DISCUSSION Art and Wallace Gouldby Marsden Hartley IF what I have seen written upon the subject of art in the editorial passages of the Little Review must be accepted either by ignorant or intelligent personsthen we must all give art the go byI am filled with envy for the originality or your opinionsI must decline to accept the dignity ofcriticismin view of what we have been so blessed with not only in the LReditorial passages but in every other type of art sheetYou are of all people the one to be accused of highbrow absurditiesOn the subject of GouldI intended onlysome remarks Remarks are nearly always superfluous as you yourself have convinced usI am the single person in existence who happens to know Gould all of his and my own artistic existenceHe isor rather was before he began to work for his own livingin the moviesa very excellent Referring to a discussion begun in the July numbermy room disappearedTo walk barefooted on the floor going from my bed toward the window was an odd sensationIt was like walking out of the window of a tall building into the skyinto the unknownThe room I lived in at that time was in a building made of red brickblack with grimeand my windows looked down into the cityI suspect now that I wasfor perhaps a yearwhat is called insaneI bought me a heavy coat and sometimes on winter nights threw open the windows and curled up in a large chairwide awake until morningI must be very strongI have in fact heard that all insane people are strongIn the morning I was as rested as though I had slept and went off to my daily work of making a living with no feeling of fatigueAn experience such as I am talking about having had cannot be successfully achieved if you are physically nervous as most Americans are and as I am most of the timeWhen I was very tired I was not happy in my room and sometimes felt so out of place that I went off to spend the night at a hotelThe thing to be aimed at was to become very quiet so that the mind appeared to run out of the bodyA sense of floating was at times achievedOne s mind reached outIt was at first like a small baby learning to crawlThen later it was like a white bodied boy and ran over the roofs of housesIt comprehended the city of ChicagoIt comprehended all citiesThere was a sense too of things in nature I had not known beforeFor one thing all women became pureFor the first time I found out that there cannot be such a thing as an impure man or womanThat was one of the first things my white boy mind discovered for meThere was one woman I remember wellShe lived in a room also painted greyThe point of the greyness of our two rooms was that the walls ceased to existMy white bodied mind ran over the tops of trees and into the house where the woman s body sat in the grey stillnessHer mind had also run away into the nightI did not touch her body fearing it would be coldas I am sure my body was cold sitting alone in the room in the house on the North Side in ChicagoI am striving to give you a sense of infinite things that have happened to me as I am sure they have happened also to youWe do not commune thus together often enoughI am afraideven as I begin to writethat my mood will not be strong or prolonged enough to carry me on to the things I want to speak of with a good deal of attention to detailYou will see at once that the room on the North Side in Chicago and my life there has for the moment returned to me very vividlyThat is because it has no realityThere are other things of which I hope to write that are more definite but if I remain true to my desires nothing in this book will be very definiteThe book is itselfas you have by this time no doubt suspectedan effort to escape out of the house and the room of my lifeto visit you the reader indefinitelyto touch with my thoughts your lipsyour hairyour body that I trust will remain as cold as the body of the woman my boy mind visitedI am like everyone else who has in reverence put pen to paperimpatient with the limitations of pen and paperIf your body becomes warm as yo u read on and into my testament my mind will become excited and all will be destroyedI was in that grey room a long timelooking out at the city of Chicago and thinking of Illinois and IowaMy room faced south and west so my mind went in those directionsIt even visited Kentucky and Missouri although it did not go farther southinto the cotton growing states or into the southwestinto TexasIn the room my mind grew more vigorous than myself as ex piessed in my bodyThere is however nothing uncanny in all thisIf you think there is you are mistakenWe are all so hurried and harried through life that we forget the possibilities of life and are but too prone to take short cuts into the supernaturalNot many of us get even for a few months during a long lifeinto a quiet place where the needs of our bodies become hushed and secondaryI have sometimes seen old sick people I thought were doing the thing of which I speakbut I could not be sure of them It is my own persistent notion that one needs to be wellto be healthy and strong to achieve the delights of insanityto live in other words outside the husk of oneselfIt will be understood between us that I am a man witk fat cheeksneither handsome or very homelyof the medium heightI go about the middle western part of America making a livingvisiting townsseeing peopleI eat food in restaurantsgo to dine sometimes in housesmeet occasionally notably men who have got up in the worldOnce in a long time someone writes of mesaying I am a notable manI know that is a lieI know well enough there never has beencannot be such a thing as a notable manI am however determined for a curious reason it is not worth while to try to record to attempt to reveal myself One of the motives back of my attempt a somewhat obvious motive is that I live in Chicago in a day when very litle that is true concerning life comes to the surfaceIn a purely subconscious way I am a patriotI live in a wide valley of cornfields and men and towns and strange jangling soundsand in spite of the curious perversion of life here I have a feeling that the great basin of the Mississippi Riverwhere I have always lived and moved aboutis one day to be the seat of the culture of the universeAs I have talked with very few men from other places I have not found out whether they have or have not the same hallucination regarding their native landsAnyway I have it regarding my ownAnd I have another feelingIt seems to me that every man or woman who lives in my land in my time is as a seed plantedMy mind has spent hours playing with that ideaI have elaborated it infinitelyThe industrialism that has so crushed the spirits of the people of my day isI say to myselfbut the damp cold heavy earth lying over the seedsWe are in the winter of timeAll seed must be planted and must lie in the damp and cold until warm days comeI strike upon this seed motive now because I fancy it was born with the birth of my fanciful selfI cannot remember but I often tell myself it was born while I lived in the North Side room I have been talking to you about the room you will have to make a special effort not to forget did not existI have a desire to make you sense me in that room and if you are to grow to care for me to make you care for me theresitting wide awake on a winter night in my great coat and looking with blind eyes down into the heart of Mid AmericaI am sure I was a seed then and that you were a seed then and that we are both but seeds nowWe are both buried deeply in lifeWe sometimes strive and straintrying to escape our obvious fateVaguely also we try each to fertilize the spirits of the otherIt is unnecessary to try to carry the figure on but it is an almost sensual pleasure to me to think that perhaps I will fertilize your mind with my notionThat is my egotismI think of you going along in Indianapolis or Chicago or Minneapolis thinking of the Words I have put downAs the whole purpose of my writng is my own pleasure I will stop writing for the present and give myself over to the contemplation of youfor a moment and in a passing waythinking the thought I have suggested to you to be continued POEM by Isaac Rosenberg189o 1918Caught still as AbsalamSurely the air hangs From the swayless cloud boughsLike hair of Absalam Caught and hanging stillFrom the imagined weight Of spaces in a sky Of mute chagrinmy thoughts Hang like branch clung hair To trunks of silence swungWith the choked soul weighing down Into thick emptinessChristend this hanging deathFor endlessness hangs therefromInvisibly branches break From invisible trees The cloud woods where we rushOur eyes holding so muchWhich we must ride dim ages round Ere the handswe dreamcan touchWe ridewe ridebefore the morning The secret roots othe sun to treadAnd suddenly We are lifted of all we know And hang from implacable boughsLETTRES IMAGINAIRES by Mary Butts I MY DEARI have learned that I cannot speak to you any more as to my temporal loverIf I tried you would force me into sentimentand special pleadingI might appeal to your pityWe have not known each other very longbut I am assured that with you such a demand would be a piece of ill breedingThere is an image of you in my breastand an image in the worldBut truth does not He in these presentmentsLet us suppose then that you have a Pattern laid up in Heaven waiting to touch my elbow as I write Siryou and I have lovedbut that s not itSiryou and I mustI find it difficult to continueThe business should be commonplacebut a bizarre streak seems to accompany my lapse into passionIt has been a freakish crucifixion from a delicate approachconventional as a harlequinadefor ten days we loved one another as I thought with some quality of passionYou assumed my natureI took on yoursThe change of spiritual hats was no lossNo one knewWe were too sure to need confidentsThere was no one to forbidOur aptitude was perfect and our opportunityThen one night we had arranged to meetand you sent me a strange telegramTwo nights later you came in late to our little restaurant and said This won t doI smell burning Now I like fireI looked at you and saw you were Wyndham Lewis s drawing of the starry skya cold Titana violent IntelligenceYou were holding away from you a jewelled image which was myselfThen I knew that friend I might beor mistressbut not loverThat dance was endedEssentially you werethroughwith me and resentfulBut I do not love like thatI will not have this sensuality and this friendshipI march to a better tuneI will not listen while you play both air and accompaniment with your heavy alternate handsDearI was tired that nightCouldn t you have been gentle with meIt was not lust that I wanted thenor philosophyonly peaceI sat opposite to you tower of ivoryhouse of gold Your eyes narrowedThenwith some ingratitudeyou damned me for the vitality which had sustained youGallic realismperhapsyour Latin analysis stripped the beauty you had enjoyedI matched my wits with yoursanswered your questionsparried your threatsfolded myself in my sexoffered you a delicate candour You were not pleasedThen I saw that it was not a gameThroughout your analytical protests there was a recurrent noteI understood that I was target for some sacred male encounter with its own mightScorn for me was to reanimate your virture assure you of something you had lost But then I could not make the analysisYour sneers were too effective as you held my imagefrom you our brilliant eyes swept past mineyou spoke with your handsThenwith some irrelevance you said there was nothing to make me unhappyI was a cocotte who had attempted your seductionSadismWell yesInnate need for violencevulgarly called love of a rowIn partBut there is an x in the equationNot since ValentineIt is too soon for this to have happened to me againIt is making me cry and quiverI remember how by your Sussex fire you laid my head on your handsand crossed the hands I clasped lest my virture should escape youMy rings had bitten into my handsYour eyes were dark and profoundheavy with peaceI would not have had you change yet to this pursuit of a truth whosechiclies in its perversionAll this in three weeksYou sayShe will get over it II It was too soonmy dearto be hurt againThat s my text for to nightYou should never have comforted me if you were going to submit me again to tortureAll my life I have been accompanied by a ghostly painLately it has become substantialand I have recognised it in some absolute sense as crueltyFirst there was Valentinethen youYou know how you found me grey and sullen wasted through too much knowledgeYou knew what I had come to seeThere were your compassionate wordsyou ve unsaid themCan t you understandyou foolthat you ve unsaid themLook hereYou must not imagine that this is a complainta whining because a man has refused to love meYou are under nO obligation to find immortality in mywhite and gold and red But I think that you should have made up your mindDo you remember what you saidif there is any good will that can help you through this businessremember that you have it Within a month you faced me across Porfirio s tablemy evil personifiedWhat does it meanYou see I have the mind s curiosity to understand and incorporateIt sustains menearly all the timeYou need not have loved methough it would have been better that you shouldBut your voice is flaying me like the noise of a scythe on stoneWhy should my vitality have moved this impulse in youThrough you it returned to me augmentedDid you hate itDid you crave to diminish it yourselfLovedear lovehow dare you speak to me of loveIll You have said that you do not trust lifeso why should you trust me who amat bestone of thenaughty stars And I imagined that I was to be your reconciliationFrom such divergence where could we have found a meeting place for loveIf Ithe brother whom you have seencould not enter your housewhere will God come inIn my vanity I thought that where one went the other followedSir you have undeceived meWhat did you call me dangereusefalseessentially outside truth Has that last phrase any meaningTo me it is plain tripeI can only tell my part of this adventureLouis there have been timesoften before some humiliation profound as this when I have known myself for an artificer in a better way of love than men practise in the worldThat does notprove me base but may prove me dangerousDid I offer you too much freedomtoo much passionWhen I stripped myself of jealousy and possessiondid I strip you of some armour you would not be withoutYou allow me wordsI might talk with you on those matters till dawnBut love is nota conversationAn adventure has been lostWe shall not be together againand in love how can one have the adventure aloneYou hardly admit the possibilityI saidI could make it damned good You answeredDamned it might be Am I to go through all my life looking for the lover whose pace equals mineIs it always illusion that turns me here and theresaying that I have found him in my perpetual errorThe pilgrim rescued the lady in the dewy woodTherewithout explanationhe left her to face the Blatant BeastIV Last night when you had gone with your friends1 sat down on the floor among the nutshells and cigarette ends and cried at the fireI was alone in my houseand you had all gone homelover by lover I was leftout of your thoughtout of your danceNot one of you but Leila had thought to say that it had been a good partyAn empty winebottle rolled across the floor and chinked against a syphonIt frightens me when inanimate things move aboutIt can be lonely herepast midnightunder the great shadows of this roofnot easy to leave the fire and mount the gallery stairs and slip into the icy bedBefore I decided to attempt it and take aspirinI wondered if this fire which you have lit and will not share has anabsolutevaluea good in itself apart from youand from me Eventually one takes the way from one s kindThis afternoon I went out in the rain and through the streetsnot faint with desolation but in tranquilitywith my lovePathologicalLaterI am waiting for you nowWill it be the same if you do not comeHow can it be when my eyes are starved my quivering touch cannot fastenI want our old ritualI want to play it to satiety Don t you remember you would sit by the fireWe d be aloneI would sit on the chair arm behind youYou lay theresilentrelaxedas life flowed from me to youDid you know what I said as I kissed your neck that I laid my peace on youthe peace you ve not had My peacenot as the world giveth Your astonishment made me laughI slipped from the arm onto your kneeand crossed my feetand swung thereI can see you laughI can see your quarrel with life remembered to be forgotten Oh my dear you happenedbut just in timeonly just in time And I believed itMy eyes went hot because of the miracleI used to watch the flush on your thin facethe sudden fusionYou used to laugh Was there ever woman said such things beforeWitty fool I would slip from your knees onto the floor and crouch there looking up at yousilentThen it was your turnYou are not coming to nightI was mistakenThere is no adventure aloneV Half an hour later a knockExternal shapesthe wallsthe coloured glass on the dark shelf became like sceneryflattwo dimensionedCrossing from the fireplace to the door I knew my body bent as though the great chair had risen and clung to my backYou were not therebut a boy with onionsIt happened again I said It is not Louisit is notIt wasn tI saw a girl with a suit case and umbrellaand several kinds of fur a girl you have not metShe wanted a bed for the nightThe sequence was amusingThat evening we compared our beauties on the floorby the fire on the white rugburnished our nails and our hairOur scents and orange sticks lay between our feet my long pink toes and her short onesShe threw down her mirror She must speakShe had gathered indeed she knewI had given myselfand to more than one manI was not married at allI did not seem to mindDid I know what I was doingI was giving men what they wantedI exacted nothing in returnDid I know theawful degradationthat was overtaking meNo one could be more passionate than she but neverHer fiance would come back from the front and kill herThere s a chance for Ivan She was proud to think that she would come to himJust all of herPrice sixpencePlease see that this seal is unbroken Incidentally she considered me a blackleg in a pair of silk stockingsShe has left me to wonder though without passion whether youLouisare despising me She does not know about youYou have called me pureDo you still think thatDid you ever think it with your mindI don t careIf love of truth can make me pureI ll passAnd sowhat woman cares a pin about chastityShe tried to frighten medamn herThen later I saw her puny manand lunched afterwards with Billand drank with himand comforted him in sexless amityand then came to meas there has always comethe answer to her fear to be continued A VISITfrom the French of Charles Vildracby Witter Bynner Seated by his tableHis dreams delicately enclosed In the domain of his lampHe heard against his window The soft assault of the snowThen he thought abruptly Of a man he knew And had not seen for a long timeAnd he felt in his throat An oppressive somethingSomething made of sadness and a little shameHe knew that the man was humble Both in heart and in wordWith no ways of charmingAnd that he Ijved like those trees You see alone on a bleak plainHe knew that for months Many a time he had promised This man to go and see him And that for each of the promises The man had thanked him gentlyPretending to believe themHe knew besides that the man loved himThis was what filled his reverieFilled his room with whispersWhich he did not try to turn awayThen an inner command Made him instantly alert His throat was eased And his eyes glad and laughingHe dressed himself quicklyHe went outdoors And started through the snow For the man s houseAfter the first wordsWhen he was seated in the light Between the man and his wife Both of them surprised and eagerHe realized that they were directing at him Those silences that ask questions And make the sort of blank one leaves Purposely in one s writingHe noted on the two faces A sort of secret anxietyHe wondered and all at once he understoodThese folkalasdid not believe That he had come of a sudden At so late an hourfrom so far and through the snowOnly for his gladness and theirsOnly to keep a promiseAnd they waitedboth of themFor him to reveal abruptly and in a breath The solemn reason of his comingThey were anxious to know What good luck might be happening to themWhat service might be expected of themHe would at once have spoken The words to undeceive themBut they weighed his wordsThey anticipated the moment When he would tell them his reasonHe felt as bewildered and clumsy As a man accusedAnd so he was separated from them Till the very last minute When he rose to goThen something unbentThen they dared understandHe had come only for themSomebody had wished to see themNothing moreto see themto be with themTo speak with them and to listen to themAnd this desire had been Stronger than the coldstronger than the snow And the distanceIt was just that at last somebody had comeAnd now their eyes Were gay and tenderThey spoke very fastThey spoke together To try to keep himThey stood beside him And betrayed a childish need Of joking and of shaking handsHe promised them that he would come backBut before reaching the door He fixed well in his memory The spot where their life was shelteredHe noticed well every detail And finally the man and the womanBecause he so feared in the bottom of his heart That he would never come backman to marry and she knew sobut she wanted a man with long soft hair and kind big handsA man who could sit for hours still and perfectly sad and who would understand when the hungry hands of a well read woman would smooth his hairwho would not turn around andout of embarrassementtry to fight the situation with a smile or an irrelavant phraseShe came back to ItalyShe was still gay and light butalreadyshe was motherlyShe was motherly with every man that came to her with not unkind sorrows in his manly heartSuch a man came and she talked to him and on an evening they cried togetherin front of a windowbecause the sunset burnt yellow and purplethe woman was thinking that it is sweet and heavenly to understand the sorrows that have hardened into the flesh of a manHe was to marry her but the family did not wantBut he said You beforethe family afterthough I love them very much Butinsteadhe went awayleft her pregnantWho will say that he was wrongHe had never loved herIt is easy to believe that you lovehe was an honest manShe should have knownNow her father was dead and she hadn t any money and the man wanted to help her outBut she was proudShe went to workshe had a little monthly allowance from the governmentshe got along and she loved the babywho was lean and sicklyhis eyes were the eyes of the fathervery black and very coldso black that there was no bottom to themso coldso blackthat you would have called them invisible eyeseyes that were a darkness and not a lightShe was proudShe never forgave the manBecause she was honest and hard she wasn t a loose girland she gave herself for loveShe was honest and magnificently aloof and the negro servants in Africa thought she was a great Queenthe great White Queenthe way she was majestic and sweetly hard with themShe spoke of books and wherever she went they called herthe ladyand it was a marvel to see how everybody was intimidated in her presenceTo see how strangers loved herafter a few minutes with herAnother man came alongHe was shrewdand hungry for a girlthe way dogs and men are hungrythe way men are hungry in the summer in a North American City where a girl is hard to get if you re not initiatedHe had her tooBecause she loved himThenthere was another childTwo childrennot

TurinPiedmontItalyTurin is a grey serious earnest city with long straight streetsa huddle of square blocksIf she had been born out in the mountains where Emily lived this wouldn t have happenedbut thenI saw the old photographs of the familya yellowish mist on themPhotographs of the romantic periodPeriod in which one still believed in the solemn face or the melancholy face or the noble face or the pale faceThe face of her mother was solemn and mysteriousThe face of her father was that of a man with the heart of a knightcrowned with the well balanced smile of the successful manlife to him was an adventure in gallantry women and warHe wasin factan officer of the Italian army in the Erythrean expeditionHe had brought her and her sister along with him to Africaafter her mother had diedShe had lived well and happily in Africaso she used to tell us childrenall beautiful tales of hyenaspestilencedevoted negro servants and Ras Alula and Ras somebody elseShe was skinnyshe had a long lean noseno curve from the nose to the lipssmall eyestight bulging little foreheadshe was not attractiveas they sayHer hair was very beautiful but that did not make a real differenceOne had to know her well to appreciate the beauty that was in her hairThat is why she longed to be well knownwell understoodA famous explorer there is a monument erected to his memory in the city of Parma fell in love with herShe was to marry himBut he was the scientist kindearnest and inelegantshe did not love himHe gave her a doll onceon her nineteenth birthdayand she was very angryHe told her once You are not attractiveMissbut your mind has infinite beauty and I beg to let me take you for my wife But she was too young and a bit too happy to understand a thing like thatAnd he was naiveand she was notshe was very well read and eaten up from within by the ever hungry little old mothromanceHe was a good fine bitterly proudbut proud still like a Queenpoor White QueenAnd she was honest and she was so naive that when men s eyes who sought a girl met hers she did not really know all that they searched and lewly touchedFor she wasn t attractive and she knew itthat is why she was maternal with menThen she was thirty twoShe met a mana soldierwho was twenty fiveHe was beautifulstronga great sporta game guya spoiled childpenniless and ignorantShe had a little moneyshe got him out of the army where he thought he d have to remainand got him a jobTaught him french and how to know good booksMade him civilized and sophisticatedHe was intelligenthe neverafterwanted to admit that he owed so much to herThis man did not like the childrenHe was youngso he fell in love with several girls and she understood and suffered and then she feared he d go awayso she was good to himshe was especially good to him when he broke her heartSometimes her heart would break and she would fall in a swoonOne day he was sickHe staid in bed two months with ulcers on his body and the fool doctor never could tell what the trouble wasHe went to the hospital and he was told that it probably was the syphilis but that they couldn t be sure until they had tested his bloodNext day on the cardboard tablet beside his bedon which doctors wrote the diagnosishe saw some signs or words that amounted to ayes It meant to him that he had the syphilishe howled like a wolf that has been caughtHe came back home to herHe was forced to stay in bed two more monthsHe had caught it going around in brothelsBut she was a great mother to himwhile he stayed in bedBut she knew that he did not love herShe was maternalalthough she was oldalthough she beat her childrenshe was maternal with himShe nursed him as a sweet nurse nurses a sweet childand while his hair wa falling because of the syphilis he had caught in a brothel she d call himher lovely child But he did not like the children and he did not love herSo she sawat lastwellthe great grotesqueWhen she beat the children she d scream so that the tenants of the house would all come out on the balconies to gossip aboutthat crazy woman She beat them and several times she faintedafterHe cursed her to hear the noise she was makingHe cursed her vulgarly and she was still a ladya proud QueenShe knew that he was getting to hate herBut it was too late to act kindlyto be carefulfor his sakeof what she was doingto put up a show of kindness and be discriminateBecause oldness and ugliness and defeat were comingand be was going awaySometimes she sat in the kitchenalonewhen the children were outand she wished that he would dieshe knew that he d go away when he was wellWhen she got upevery morningshe used to put powder on her faceThat was all rightbut now she had to put too much powder on her faceAfter her yelling to the children the two wrinkles around her mouth were deeperBeforea little rouge on the cheeks sufficedbut now she had to put too much rouge on and that was uglyAnd thenone day she had to buy three false teeth the front teeththe front teethOf coursehe saw themSo she beat the childrenshe swoonedshe had headaches for days and nights He had to go to the hospital againHe came back almost wellbut he was doubled up and his skin showed under his thin hair He was bitter toohe had thesyphilis so there wasn t much choice for him in life and so he wasn t going to try to get along with herhe d go after something easierOn day he told her he d quit herFirst she knelt down before him and prayedBut then she stood up and fought tremendouslyfought beautifully because she fought against the big failure which was now all visibleshe looked at the failure and foughtand it was a beautiful thing to doThere comes the big failure and some bend their heads over their chests like birds in the coldAnd some send their miserable bodies to the absurd warBut there are eyes in the world that see the dance of the absurdand always someone who carefully listens to the great song of itAll her miserablebodyHer skinny body and the last hunger within itShe called her romantic heart and all the books she had readto help herHurled herself at lastagainst the monster who awaitsduring all the nights of the infinite yearsthe hour of our awful scream he waits for it and when he has heard he waits stillto hear other screamshe waits stillhe waits foreverShe hurled her miserable body and her facenow like a dismal little clenched fistin a fight of teeth and nailsfalse teethAnd once more the world came to its symphonic nightshe cursed the stupid chairs and cursed the yellow lamp and the shadows that had become infinitely old on the grey walls Cursed the windows and the breeze they inhaled came over her and made her sob with an agony of self pityAnd now she would weep softly because the breeze from the window was a melody of remembrancesShe wanted her limbs to breakwhy wouldn t this thing burst through her limbsShe offered her limbs in sacrifice if the awful thing would only burst through herWanted to stretch her arms so violently that they d sever from her body nodded her head up and downHer head swayed up and down and sidewayssideways and up and down and she moanedohohohohoh boat in the tempestAnd the children wished that she would stop sometime because they wanted to playI know that things await the terrible screamingThe monster in the nightsthe cavern whence the cool darkness sails towards our windows and our mouthsthe purest line of the evening horizon on the lake how many times have I gone near to themknowing that they awaitedhave gone near and stopped shortwas afraidor did not know howto screamThe sheer pink flower before fantastic eyes in the morningthe sheer pink flower is a gleaming eye looking upon a horror of putrefied dreamsThe sky when it is farthest from the earththe purest skythe sky that has flown high and high because the air was so clearthe sky feels the touch of the scream we so fearfully constrain as the very white breasts of a woman hear the caress of the desperate loverThese things await our horrible screamingThe woman had repudiated her childrenshe had betrayed themSo now she did not dare to ask for the children s loveShe was too hungryShe knew that children give love to everyonebut to hungry people they don tChildren are pure and they are afraid of the awful eyes of hungry personsChildren refuse love to begging heartsbecause their world is a world of fair and happy exchangeand they are rightAnd they are right because they are beautifulAnd the manhe was just as bitterhis was another fightso he just shook her offGod sent her a cancer in the womb and she dieda week after the big fightI

striven to utterSeriouslyseriouslywith cool gentlemanlinessI lay a word of reproach on your gravemy auntThat was a crimeas I was only a child and you were not ashamed to soil me with the sight of your tragedyYou did not hide your awful crazy hands from meMade a clown of me when you dressed me in black to mourn your deadStilldesperate hands of last clean windwind of the fallbring rags of noises from the city to the cemeterythe evening is a lady in grey mourning for all the dead and she is rustling by on the road beside the graveyardWhy do I comeWere you not my auntIt s pity that brings me hereor it is your dead face projected in all the darknesseswhich has driven me here for the soul of man is a ghost and it haunts him and it drives himBut it is not sorrowAunta sorrow for you would shatter

auntWhat do you want from meI do not try to explainI do not care to understandI have not been cursed by those who have died in miserybecause I have not slain anyone with miseryBut I read the newspapersI see rouge and powder faces and sometimesas I pass alongside your houses with my hurried heart for a moment attentive to your noisesI hear childrenbeing beatenyellingand today I have seen

to act kindlyto be carefulfor his sakeof what she was doingto put up a show of kindness and be discriminateBecause oldness and ugliness and defeat were comingand be was going awaySometimes she sat in the kitchenalonewhen the children were outand she wished that he would dieshe knew that he d go away when he was wellWhen she got upevery morningshe used to put powder on her faceThat was all rightbut now she had to put too much powder on her faceAfter her yelling to the children the two wrinkles around her mouth were deeperBeforea little rouge on the cheeks sufficedbut now she had to put too much rouge on and that was uglyAnd thenone day she had to buy three false teeth the front teeththe front teethOf coursehe saw themSo she beat the childrenshe swoonedshe had headaches for days and nights He had to go to the hospital againHe came back almost wellbut he was doubled up and his skin showed under his thin hair He was bitter toohe had thesyphilis so there wasn t much choice for him in life and so he wasn t going to try to get along with herhe d go after something easierOn day he told her he d quit herFirst she knelt down before him and prayedBut then she stood up and fought tremendouslyfought beautifully because she fought against the big failure which was now all visibleshe looked at the failure and foughtand it was a beautiful thing to doThere comes the big failure and some bend their heads over their chests like birds in the coldAnd some send their miserable bodies to the absurd warBut there are eyes in the world that see the dance of the absurdand always someone who carefully listens to the great song of itAll her miserablebodyHer skinny body and the last hunger within itShe called her romantic heart and all the books she had readto help herHurled herself at lastagainst the monster who awaitsduring all the nights of the infinite yearsthe hour of our awful scream he waits for it and when he has heard he waits stillto hear other screamshe waits stillhe waits foreverShe hurled her miserable body and her facenow like a dismal little clenched fistin a fight of teeth and nailsfalse teethAnd once more the world came to its symphonic nightshe cursed the stupid chairs and cursed the yellow lamp and the shadows that had become infinitely old on the grey walls Cursed the windows and the breeze they inhaled came over her and made her sob with an agony of self pityAnd now she would weep softly because the breeze from the window was a melody of remembrancesShe wanted her limbs to breakwhy wouldn t this thing burst through her limbsShe offered her limbs in sacrifice if the awful thing would only burst through herWanted to stretch her arms so violently that they d sever from her body nodded her head up and downHer head swayed up and down and sidewayssideways and up and down and she moanedohohohohoh boat in the tempestAnd the children wished that she would stop sometime because they wanted to playI know that things await the terrible screamingThe monster in the nightsthe cavern whence the cool darkness sails towards our windows and our mouthsthe purest line of the evening horizon on the lake how many times have I gone near to themknowing that they awaitedhave gone near and stopped shortwas afraidor did not know howto screamThe sheer pink flower before fantastic eyes in the morningthe sheer pink flower is a gleaming eye looking upon a horror of putrefied dreamsThe sky when it is farthest from the earththe purest skythe sky that has flown high and high because the air was so clearthe sky feels the touch of the scream we so fearfully constrain as the very white breasts of a woman hear the caress of the desperate loverThese things await our horrible screamingThe woman had repudiated her childrenshe had betrayed themSo now she did not dare to ask for the children s loveShe was too hungryShe knew that children give love to everyonebut to hungry people they don tChildren are pure and they are afraid of the awful eyes of hungry personsChildren refuse love to begging heartsbecause their world is a world of fair and happy exchangeand they are rightAnd they are right because they are beautifulAnd the manhe

on MrHartley as a self anointed artistic divinityWallace Gould must be even more sickened by his selection of friends than by their patronizing publicityall of which amounts toGould knows Maine and Hartley knows Gouldtherefore Gould is the uglyBut all thought is ugly to the American critic especially if it come from the leftAnd since in a work of art the form of the composition bespeaks the thoughtthen all new forms are inevitably anathema and this is not alone true of AmericaSo let us take off our undershirtsmy friendsand scratch our backs in good companyAt least we will not be praised because of our lovelinessBut of course that last paragraph is no more than a familiar hallooa hoi yo to hoiThe thing is that the difficulty between the critic and the artist has never been rightly understoodI do not make the same mistake as my predecessorsI have merely up to this point designated two objects of different natureone of whichfull of thoughtconcerns the artist and one of whichfull of lovelinessconcerns the criticThere is no transition between themThey remain forever separateone forever to concern the artist and one forever to concern the criticBut I differ from some of my companions in that I do not disdain to attack the criticI do not disdain to soil my hands with deathI find a certain exhilaration in taking the heavy corpse in my arms and fox trotting with it as far as I am ableIt is not easy to dance with a dead thing in the armsAnd this is the eternal and until now slighted nature of the engagement between artist and criticIt is a danceNo man can be forced to danceBut I see no particular gain in mixing only with those of my own inherited cast of thought and feelingI can of course appreciate the Chinese philosopher who lived alone by a waterfallbut aside from that perfection I see no reason for avoiding the arms of a critic It teaches me to danceThat there is no transition between critic and artist I will maintain as well as I am ableA man may be onethen the otherbut never one within the otherIt is a common impossibilityWitness alone the silence of the returned soldier among whom are men well able to express themselves Phillip Gibbs has it Non combatants do not understand and never willnot from now until the ending of the world Cut it out about the brave boys in the trenches So it is difficult to describe themor to give any idea of what goes on in their mindsfor they belong to another world than the world of peace that we knewand there is no code which can decipher their secretnor any means of self expression on their lips To a soldier warto an artist his artto a critic his criticismto them all the dancean original and a fine poetAnd of course Margaret Anderson is grateful to Hartley for placing herand encouraging her to go on editing her magazine It is my first and last propaganda There are some of us to whom every thing Hartley writes is propaganda to establish himself as an artistelectioneeringThe jauntyfamiliarhomey attitude toward Art indicates a condition far less flattering than the adoration of the dilettanteThe intellectual and artistic eunuch seems to be a natural animaljhMore Swill by William Carlos Williams WHEN a lady says a certain aria of Puccini s is lovelyand V V that a certain other composition by Claudel is uglyshe means something definiteShe is using words accurately and for this reason her statement is not a mere matter of opinion but assumes the quality of being a definite point of illumination for better or worseShe puts two separate things in apposition and distinctly chooses onePuccini s aria will continue to remainlovelyand Claudel s composition will continue to beuglyone feels that sharply no matter how she may subsequently alter her opinionHer statement signalises a fixed point of separation one theme has escaped her understanding and one satisfies itThe failure of loveliness is that it is possessed at large before it is composed and so can never be createdAnd the hell of creative work is that it is never possessed until after it has been set down and after the artist has lost his taste for it and then of course possessed only by one or twoAmericans are cursed with a desire to be understoodEverything must bebeautifulor it must show this or that wellunder stood perfectionbut it never occurs to an Americanto an American critic in this caseto discover first whether he is dealing with a live thing or with the symmetries of a corpseIt never occurs to an American critic to question whether or not a work shows evidences of creative thoughtor at least this is not the first thing that occurs to himIs it beautiful Yes butbeautifulmeans something that tickles himsomething that he can understandand that thing must inevitably be to an artist

PhiladelphiaMrStokowskiScriabin or yourself than they knew beforeIt is true that they know you were movedBut whenceAnd what did you discover on your journeyIffor exampleyou take a trip around the world you can truthfully say to your friends on your return I am glad to say without reservation that I was never before so moved in my life But such a statement means nothingIt is equivalentif you will allow me to change the metaphorto eating a ripe plumshutting your eyesand murmuring dithyrambically Ahthis is the most delicious plum I have tasted since I tasted a peachIndeedit is altogether and unimaginably delicious Such enthusiasmhoweveris critically sterilePeople may have sufficient confidence in your powers of discriminatory gustation to be induced to try a plum for themselvesBut they will do so not because you have criticised plums but because you have advertised themAnd I scarcely think it is your deliberate intention to turn the Little Review in a Printer s InkIn other wordsyour attitude toward artso far as it is revealed in your magazineis neither metallic nor aromaticYou neither paint nor do you drawIf you say The Philadelphia Orchestraunder the leadership of Leopold Stokowskiis a first rate musical organizationUnfortunatelyin modern compositionslike Scriabin sPoeme D Extase it is a metronome without a sense of timea clock without hands orratherwith too many of themThe violinsduring the first three minuteswere married to the hornsbut their conjugal state was merely legal or if you say more than any other orchestra in this countryexcept possibly the Boston Symphonythe Philadelphia organization approaches supreme concerted perfectionStokowski was once an organistThat may or may not have anything to do with his conductingthe fact remains that heof all our conductorsbarring perhaps Bodanzkyis alone able to play on his vast instrument as though it were the key board of a great organ whose bellows are filled with the four winds of heavenHis performance of Scriabin sPoeme D Extasewas a hallelujah in the temple of musical artThere was no instrument on the platformit seemedbut himself If you say such thingsthough I may bemoan your brevityI can understand youOr ifdropping the metallic style and riding sensuously on a sea of sound you prefer merely to float on the tide of your emotions and remarkas you drift subjectively along Leopold Stokowski is Tht Li tilt Review 3i An Open Letter toMargaret Anderson by Winthrop Parkhurst THERE are two forms of criticismthe metallic and the aromaticThe wielder of the first form is the grave digger who exhumes the corpses of art and exposes them impartially for all to seeand smellVide HLMenckenThe wielder of the second form is the florist who lovingly plants flowers over each grave andletting the individual richness or aridity of the soil determine their growthplucks them at length and offers them to the worldVide Arthur SymonsOne is intellectualand is concerned with bonesthe other is emotionaland is concerned with bouquetsBetween these two types of critics come othersof coursecombining in various degrees their dual activitiesThe intellectual critic often has a heartthough he seem to write entirely above the neckthe emotional critic often has a brainthough he seem to write entirely below itBut in the main the classification holdsOne type records things as he thinks they areThe other sings of things as he feels themThe comparative merits of the two modes of assaying beauty are not entered here in the field of controversyMy gravamen against you is not that you select either the one form or the otherIt is that you do not select eitherOr if you doyou select tooth at once with the result that your criticism is a horned hybrid that is neither flesh nor fowl nor good red criticismIf you thinkit is only with your heartIf you feelit is only with your brainAnd I submit that such critical monstrosities are not only bad for your readers artistically but bad for yourself physiologicallyIn the April issue of the Little Review you furnish the public with a typical piece of incriminating evidence against yourselfYou have some other psycho emotional felonies in the roost of literature and musicFor the sake of brevity I simply hold up one stolen prize chicken and let it cluck for the coopThe Philadelphia Orchestraunder the leadership of Leopold Stokowskihad performed Scriabin sPoeme D Extase You had attended the performanceand your soul had been movedIn testimony of your spiritual locomotion you wrote this statement I am glad to say without reservation that the greatest musical experience I have had for three or four yearssince I heard Scriabin s a dreamerThe hasheesh which he eats is the poisonous passion flower of RussiaHe cannot put a pinch of Scriabin to his tongue before you becomein imaginationaPoeme D Extaseyourself and ride with him deliriously to the distant shores of a fantastic countrywhich shores are unhappily lapped by silenceeventually ending your dreamif you say such things as this I cannot only understand youI can sympathizeI can applaudInsteadwhat do you sayYou remark I am glad to state that the greatest musical experience I have had for three or four years etcAnd thenwith an operatic touchyou conclude He was musical to the point of looking sosicand he conducted without a score sic sic I have overburdened your generosityI fearbut you publish your welcome to a free discussion of the arts and I cannot help but accept itAdvertisement is not criticismIf you really distinguish between the two forms of verbal expression I trust you will put me in error to the extent of publishing this letter somewhere in the body of your magazine and not among the list of Coffee Houses It would be more kind to the writer and more fairperhapssince it can be seen that he has a point to maketo print his first four paragraphs and omit his very awful examples of critical writingBut my editorial experience has taught me that a man would rather appear in fullwith his crimes upon himthan he deleted by even the kindest editorshipHowever I shall credit him with his point and answer only thatOr ratherhe answers it for me People may have sufficient confidence in your powers of discrimination to be induced to try a plum for themselvesBut they will do so not because you have criticised plums but because you have advertised them Very wellThat is quite rightThat is all that was intendedIf one sets out to make a piece of criticismor a piece of appreciationwhich is the same thingdespite Marsden Hartley it either turns out to be artif he is an artistor a valuation if he is merely a criticLet it foe one or the otherThe only thing to avoid is what MrParkhurst suggestsI have never written a word that I imagined to have any beautyor formor existence as literatureI merely like to talk about ideasI am not a writerI am a good criticOf course I am using the term loosely I am briefly answering MrParkhurst s accusationIt would be more interesting to go into a discussion of the nature of the critic and to attack MrParkhurst s premise of criticismI take it for granted when I offer brief notes on music that my audience is capable of remembering the point of view from which I writeAnd I can certainly avoid any efforts in the direction ofHallelujahs in the temple of musical art etcIt is easy to avoidevery one can make such effortsevery one does make themevery one likes themthey become one of the horrors of existenceAnd because every one sactions this kind of thingand we loathe itThe Little Review gains its reputation for aloofness andsuperiority etcSuperiority and aloofness are the only means of avoiding democracy in criticismMCA Concerning Jessie Dismorr by AYWinters Ihave of late seen and heard a

central chandelier over the white tablecloth and sat down near MrsBailey within the edge of its radianceAmidst the broken lights and shadows of the furnituremirrors and polished surfaces opened wide various distances and gleaming passages of lightThe clear spaces of the walls sent back sheeny reflections of the central glowThe depths of the light still held unchanged the welcome that had met her when she had come in and found Emile laying the tableThere was no change and no disappointmentPeople coming in one by one saying good evening in different intonations and sending out waves of silent curiosityleft her carelessThere were five or six forms about the table besides Sissie sitting at the far end opposite her motherEmile was handing round plates of soup and the forms were making sudden remarks about the weather and waiting to have their daily experience of the meal changed by something she might do or sayPresently they would be talking and would have forgotten herThen she could see them all one by one and get away unseenhaving had dinner only with MrsBaileyMrsBailey was standing carving the jointWhen the silences grew deep enough for her to be aware of them she responded to the last remark about the weather or asked some fresh question about it as if no one had spoken at allBehind her sallies expressed in them and in every movement of her busy determined battling with the joint Miriam felt her affectionate triumphant preoccupationShe had made no introductions and demanded nothingThere you are young lady she was secretly sayingI told you soNow you re in your right place It s perfectly easy you seeThe joint was already partly distributedEmile was handing three piled dishes of vegetablesA generous plateful of well browned meat and gravy appeared before her with MrsBailey s strong small toil disfigured hand firmly grasping its edgeShe took it to pass it onEverything was hurrying on That s yorce my child said MrsBaileyThe low murmur was audible round the silent tableAsserting her independence with a sullen formality Miriam thanked her and looked about for condiments without raising her eyes to the range of those other eyesall servantsThe Young WomensBible Association was the worst disgrace that could happen to a gentlewomanEve had liked itShe had suddenly begun going about with an interested revived face eagerly doing what she was toldShe was there nowit was her only homeand she must have all her meals therefor cheapnessthere would be no outside life for herher life was imprisoned by those womenconsciously goody conscientious servants

hair with cold handsthe superintendent the watchful official expression on her large well fed elderly high school girl facethe way she sat on a footstool with her arms round her knees pretending to be easy and jolly while she recited that it was a privilege and a joy for sisters to be so near to each otheras if she were daring us to deny itI shan t see very much of EveShe won t want me toShe will strike up a friendship with one of those young womenMiriam found herself glancing up the table towards the centre of a conflictThey were all joined in conflict over some common themeNo one was outside itthe whole table was in an uproar of voices and laughterIt was nothing but Miss Scott saying things about MrMendizabal and everyone watching and throwing in remarksMiss Scott was neighing across the table at something that had been said and was preparing to speak again without breaking into her laughterAll faces were turned her wayWhat s that MrJoe anzen sayslaughed MrsBailey towards the last speakerThe invisible man opposite Miss Scott was not even MrHelsingonly the younger fainter Norwegianand this side of him an extraordinary personan abruptly bulging coarse fringea coarse grained cheek bulging from under an almost invisible deep sunken eyean abruptly shelving bust under a coarse serge bodice MrYo hanson says MrMendy zahble like n gaiety Miriam glanced across the tableThat was allThat little man with an adenoid voice and a narrow sniggering laugh that brought a flush and red spots all over his face and shiny straight Sunday school hair watered and brushed flatmade up the partyNext to him was only PollyThen came Miss Scott on Sissie s leftthen Sissie and round the corner the NorwegianEveryone looked dreadful in the harsh lightsecret and secretly hostile to everyone elseunwilling to be thereand even here though there was nothing and no one there was that everlasting conversational fussing and competition Quite right hooted the bulky woman in a high pure girlish taking photographs now that she was forced into movementsMrsBailey placed a cruet near her plateYorce she pondered getting angrily away into thoughtMrsBailey could not know that it might be said to be more correct than yourzIt was an affectationShe had picked it up somewhere from one of those people who carefully say off ten instead of awfen and it gave her satisfaction to use itlinked rebukingly up with the complacent motherly patronage of which she had boasted to the whole tableThe first of Emile s dishes appeared over her left shoulder and she saw as she turned unpreparedraised heads turned towards her end of the tableShe scooped her vegetables quickly and clumsily out of the dishesIn her awkward movements and her unprotected raised face she feltand felt all the observers seeingthejnarks of her disgraceful experienceThey saw her looking like Eve nervously helping herself to vegetables in the horrible stony cold dark restaurant of the hostelThey saw that she resented MrsBailey s public familiarity and could do nothingShe tried to look bored and murmured thank you when she had taken her third vegetableIt sounded out like a proclamation in the intense silence and she turned angrily to her plate trying to remember whether she had heard anyone else thank Emile for vegetablesAfter all she was paying for the meal and her politeness to Emile was her own affairAbroad people bowed or raised their hats going in and out of shops and said Monsieur to policemenHer efforts to eat abstractedly and to appear plunged in thought made her feel more and more like a poor relationThe details of her meeting with Eve fought their way incessantly in and out of her attempt to reclaim her sense of MrsBailey s house as a secret warmth and brightness added to the many resources of her lifeMrsBailey knew that her house had been changed by the meeting with Eve and was trying to tell her that she was not as independent as she thoughtWhat were the exact things she had told MrsBaileyShe had talked excitedly and scrappily and all the time MrsBailey had been gathering information and drawing her own conclusions about the HendersonsMrsBailey saw Eve s arrival at the station and her weary resentment of having everything done for her in the London mannerher revenge in the cabsitting back and making the little abstracted patronising sounds in response to everything that was said to hertaking no interestand at last saying how you run onShe saw something of the hostel Where s MrMendizzabledemanded SissieThe GirlsFriendlythat was the name of that other thingBut that was for voice I doan blameim Miriam turned towards the unexpectedness of her voice and sat helplessly observingThe serge sleeves were too short to cover her heavy red wristsher pudgy hands held her knife and fork broadsidelike salad serversHer hair was combed flatly up over her large skull and twisted into a tiny screw at the top just behind the bulge of her fringeCould she possibly be a boarderShe looked of far less consequence even than the BaileysHer whole person was unconsciously ill at easemaking one feel ashamed Mrsm Barrow is another ofem said the little man with hw eyebrow raised as he sniggered out the wordsI am MrGunnaI doan believe in goan abate with a face like a fiddle MrGunner s laughter flung back his head and sat him upright and brought him back to lean over his plate shaking noiselessly with his head sunk sideways between his raised shoulders as if he were dodging a blowThe eyes he turned maliciously towards MrsBarlow were a hard opaque pale blueHis lips turned outwards as he ate and his knife and fork had an upward tilt when atstSome of his spots were along the margin of his lipsaltering their shape and making them look angry and soreThe eating part of his face was sullen and angrynot touched by the laughter that drew his eyebrows up and wrinkled his bent forehead and sounded only as a little click in his throat at each breath There s plenty of glum folks abate scolded MrsBarlowMiriam was aware that she was recoiling visiblyand tried to fix her attention on her mealMrsBailey was carving large second helpings and Emile s vegetable dishes had been refilledNone of these people thought it extraordinary that there should be all this good meal and a waiterevery dayit would be shameful to come again for the sake of the mealfeeling hostileBesidesit would soon be unendurablethey would be aware of criticisms and would resent themThe only way to be able to come would be to pretend to laugh at remarks about people and join in discussions on opinions about cheerfulness and seriousness and winter and summerThey would not know that one was not sincereThey were perfectly sincere in their laughter and talkThey all had some sort of common understandingeven when they disagreedIt was the same everlasting problem againthe way people took everything for grantedThey would be pleasedwould turn and like one if one could say heartily isn t he a funny little manmatsmy wordor well I don t see anything particularly funny about himor ohgive me the summerBut if one did that one would presently be worn and strained with lyingleft with an empty excitementwhile they went serenely on their wayand the reality that was there when one first sat down with them would have goneAlways and always in the end there was nothing but to be aloneAnd yet it needed people in the world to make the reality when one was alonePerhaps just these uninter fering peoplewhen one had forgotten their personal peculiarities and had only the consciousness of them in the distance One might perhaps then wonder sometimes longingly what they were saying about the weatherBut to be obliged to meet them dailyShe chided herself for the scathing glance she threw at the unconscious guestsGunner was smiling sideways down the table again prepared to execute his laugh when he should have caught an eye and sent his grin homeMiriam almost prayed that nothing should provoke him again to speechDuring a short silence she cleared her throat elaborately to cover the sound of his eatingSeveral voices broke out togetherbut MrsBailey was suddenly saying something privately to herShe raised her head towards the bright promise and was aware of MrGunner s thoughtful and sereneThere was a pleasant intelligence somewhere about his foreheadIf only she could think his head clear and cool and not have to hear again the hot dull hollow resonance of his voice how joyously she would be listening to MrsBaileyI ve got a very special message for you young lady she had said and now went on with her eye on the conflict at the end of the table into which MrGunner was throwing comments and exclamations from afarThe room beamed softly in its golden lightFrom the heart of the golden light MrsBailey was hurrying towards her with good tidings Hah MrsBailey looked round cloaking her vexation in a bridling smile as MrMendizabal came in sturdily beamingHe sat down amidst the general outcry and Emile busied himself to lay him a placeHe shouted answers to everyonesitting with his elbows on the tablePutting her elbows on the table MrsBailey applauded with little outbursts of laughterShe had dropped the idea of delivering her messageMiriam finished her pudding hurriedlyThe din was increasingNo one was aware of herCautiously rising she asked MrsBailey to excuse herYou go Missshouted

way she saw itEve had some quite different way of looking at everything and now she was so near she was determined to hold her ownWhat about to nightCan you come round to Tansley Street said Miriam

forgotten what it is aboutGeniuses write books that are aliveSomething in them becomes a part of you She wandered out into Oxford Street feeling it vast under a huge gold lit sky somewhere behind the twilight and wandered on and on forgetful in an expansion of everything that passed into her mind out and out towards a centre in NorwayShe wondered whether Ibsen were still aliveBeautiful Norway and a man writing his thoughts in a made up playGeniusPeople go about saying Ibsen s Brand as if it were the answer to something and Ibsen knows no more than anyone elseShe arrived at Tansley Street as

pass out and again his fresh closely knit worn brick red face was deeply curved by the ironically chuckling hilarious smile with which he had met the incident of theawful German language That of the fatherlandthe happy fatherlandnearly dislocated my jaw she could imagine him heartily and badly singing with a group of Canadian studentsShe smiled back at him without saying anything rapidly piecing together the world that provoked his inclusive deeply carved smileshimselfthe marvellous little old country he found himself in as an incident of the business of forcing himself to bje a doctorhis luck in securing an accomplished young English lady to prepare him for the struggle with the great medical world of Germanyhis triumphant chuckling satisfaction in getting in first before the other fellows with an engagement to take her outThe grandeur of this best bedroom of MrsBaileys was nothing to himThe room was just a tent in his wanderingsFor the moment he was going to take a young lady to a concertThat was how he saw itHe was a simple boyish red haired extension of Drvon HeberWhen she found herself out in the large grime and gloom of the twilit landing she realised that he had lifted her far farther than Drvon Heber into Canadahe was probably more CanadianThe ancient gloom of the house was nothing to himhe would get nothing of the quality of England in his personal life thereonly passing glimpses from statements in books and in the conversation of other peopleHe did not see her as part of it all in the way Drvon Heber had done talking at the table that night and wanting to talk to her because she was part of itHe saw her as an accomplished young ladybut a young lady like a Canadian young lady and a fellow was a fool if he did not arrange to take her out quick before the other fellowsBut there was nothing in it but just that triumph I ll get a silk hat before Sunday he would prepare for her to go all the way down to the Albert Hall as a young lady being taken to a concertthe Albert Hall on Sunday was brass bandshe thought that was a concert His world was thin and terriblebut the swift sunlit decision and freedom his innocent sunny reception of her in his bedroom made the dingy brown house of her long memories a new backgroundShe was to be fetedin an assumed character and whether she liked it or noThe four strange men in the little back sitting room were her competing friendsthe friends of all nice young ladiesHe was the one who had laughed the laugh she had heard in the hall of courseThey never appeared but somehow they had got to know of her and had their curious baseless set ways of thinking and talking about herBeing doctors and still students they ought to be the most hateful and awful kind of men in relation to womenthinking and

studying gyn kahl jybut he did not apply its ugly lies to lifeto Canadians women were people but they were all the same people to DrHurd5That evening both DrHeber and Doctor Hurd appeared at dinnerMrsBailey tumultuously arranged them opposite each other to her right and left Miriam could not believe they were going to stay until they sat downShe retreated to the far end of the table taking her place on Sissie s right handseparated from Drvon Heber by the thin Norwegian and the protruding bulk of MrsBarrowMrMendizabal with a pencil and paper at the side of his plate was squarely opposite to herHis mefiant sallies to the accompaniment of Sissie s giggles and Miss Strong s rapid volleys of sarcasmmade a tumult to hide her bemused silenceShe heard nothing of the conversations sprouting all round the tableThe doctors were vast far off strongholds of serene lifeunconscious of their vastness and serenityunconscious of her and of their extraordinary taking of the Baileys and MrGunner for grantedDrvon Heber was a silence broken by small courteously curving remarks bringing back acute memories of the firmly curved held in indulations of his voiceDrHurd laughed his leaping delighted laugh in and out of a sparring unmeditated interchange with MrGunner and MrsBaileyIf she had been at their end of the table they would not have perceived her thoughts but they would have felt her general critical hostility and got up at last disliking herThey changed the atmosphere but could not make her forget the underlying unchanged elements nor rid her of her resentment of their unconsciousness of themThere was a long interval before the puddings appearedMrsBailey was trying to answer questions about booksDrHurd did not care for readingbut liked to be read toby his sistersin

laughter1 have been madame and I come awayThey say they welcome me inside again soonJe me en ficheThe faces of both doctors were turned enquiringlyDrHurd s look of quizzical sympathy passed on towards Miriam and became a mask of suppressed hysterical laughterPerhaps he and DrHeber would scream and yell together afterwards and make a great story of a man in a London pensionDrHurd would call him a

PoundcontinuedPERHAPS we do not always sufficiently consider that thought is successivenot through some accident or weakness of our subjective operations but because the operations of nature are successiveThe transferences of force from agent to agentWhich constitute natural phenomenaoccupy timeThereforea reproduction of them in imagination requires the same temporal order Suppose that we look out of a window and watch a manSuddenly he turns his head and actively fixes his attention upon somethingWe look ourselves and see that his vision has been focussed upon a horseWe sawfirstthe man before he actedsecondwhile he actedthirdthe object toward which his action was directedIn speech we split up the rapid continuity of this action and of its picture into its three essen tal parts or joints in the right orderand sayv Mfen sees horseIt is clear that these three jointsor wordsare only three phonetic symbolswhich stand for the three terms of a natural processBut we could quite as easily denote these three stages of our thought by symbols equally arbitrarywhich had no basis in soundfor exampleby three Chinese characters A JL MIf we all knew what division of this mental horse picture each of these signs stood forwe could communicate continuous thought to one another as easily by drawing them as by speaking wordsWe habitually employ the visible language of gesture in much this same mannerBut Chinese notation is something much more than arbitrary symbolsIt is based upon a vivid shorthand picture of the operations of nature Stylethat is to saylimpidityas opposed to rhetoricEP In the algebraic figure and in the spoken word there is no natural connection between thing and signall depends upon sheer coventionBut the Chinese method follows natural suggestionFirst stands the man on his two legsSecondhis eye moves through spacea bold figure represented by running legs under an eyea modified picture of an eyea modified picture of running legs but unforgettable once you have seen itThird stands the horse on his four legsThe thought picture is not only called up by these signs as well as by words but far more vividly and concretelyLegs belong to all three charactersthey are aliveThe group holds something of the quality of a continuous moving pictureThe untruth of a painting or a photograph is thatin spite of its concretenessit drops the element of natural successionContrast the Laocoon statue with Browning s lines I sprang to the saddleand Jorrisand he And into the midnight we galloped abreast One superiority of verbal poetry as an art rests in its getting back to the fundamental reality of timeChinese poetry has the unique advantage of combiriiig both elementsIt speaks at once with the vividness of paintiiigand with the mobility of soundsIt isin some sensemore objective than eithermore dramticIn reading Chinese we do not seem to be juggling mental countersbut to be watching things work out their own fateLeaving for a moment the form of the sentencelet us look more closely at this quality of vividness in the structure of detached Chinese wordsThe earlier forms of these characters were pictorialand their hold upon the imagination is little shakeneven in later conventional modificationsIt is not so well knownperhapsthat the great number of these ideographic roots carry in them averbal idea of actionIt might be thought that a picture is naturally the picture of a thingand that therefore the root ideas of Chinese are what grammar calls nounsBut examination shows that a large number of the primitive Chinese characterseven the so called radicalsare shorthand pictures of actions or processesFor examplethe ideograph meaningto speakis a mouth with two words and a flame coming out of itThe sign meaningto grow up with difficultyis grass with a twisted rootBut this concrete verb qualityboth in nature and in the Chinese signsbecomes far more striking and poetic when wepass from such simpleoriginal pictures to compoundsIn this process of compoundingtwo things added together do not produce a third thing but suggest some fundamental relation between themFor examplethe ideograph for amessmateis a man and a fireA true nounan isolated thingdoes not exist in natureThings are only the terminal pointsor rather the meeting points of actionscross sections cut through actionssnap shotsNeither can a pure verban abstract motionbe possible in natureThe eye sees noun and verb as one things in motionmotion in thingsand so the Chinese conception tends to represent themThe sun underlying the bursting forth of plants springThe sun tangled in the branches of the tree signeast Rice fieldplusstrugglemale Boatpluswaterboat watera rippleLet us return to the form of the sentence and see what power it adds to the verbal units from which it buildsI wonder how many people have asked themselves why the sentence form exists at allwhy itseems so universally necessary in all languagesWhy must all possess itand what is the normal type of itIf it be so universal it ought to correspond to some primary law of natureI fancy the professional grammarians have given but a lame response to this inquiryTheir definitions fall into two types onethat a sentence expresses acomplete thought the otherthat in it we bring about a union of subject and predicateThe former has the advantage of trying for some natural objective standardsince it is evident that a thought can not be the test of its own completenessBut in nature there is no completenessOn the other handpractical completeness may be expressed by a mere interjectionasHithereorScat or even by shaking one s fistNo sentence is needed to make one s meaning clearOn the other handno full sentence really completes a thoughtThe man who sees and the horse which is seen will not stand stillThe man was planning a ride before he lookedThe horse kicked when the man tried to catch himThe truth is that acts are successiveeven continuousone causes or passes into anotherAnd though we may string never so many clauses into a single compound sentencemiotion leaks everywherelike electricity from an exposed wireAll processes in nature are inter relatedand thus there could be no complete sentenceaccording to this definitionsave one which it would take all time to pronounceIn the second definition of the sentenceasuniting a subject and a predicate the grammarian falls back on pure subjectivityWe do it allit is a little private juggling between our right and left handsThe subject is that about which am going to talkthe predicate is that which I am going to say about itThe sentence according to this defin tion is not an attribute of nature but an accident of man as a conversational animalIf it were really sothen there could be no possible test of the truth of a sentenceFalsehood would be as specious as veritySpeech would carry no convictionOf course this view of the grammarians springs from the discreditedor rather the uselesslogic of the middle agesAccording to this logicthought deals with abstractionsconcepts drawn out of things by a sifting processThese logicians never inquired how thequalitieswhich they pulled out of things came to be thereThe truth of all their little checker board juggling depended upon the natural order by which these powers or properties or qualities were folded in concrete thingsyet they despised thethingas a mereparticular or pawnIt was as if Botany should reason from the leafpatterns woverrinto our table clothsValid scientific thought consists in following as closely as may be the actual and entangled lines of forces as they pulse through thingsThought deals with no bloodless concepts but watches things move under its microscopeThe sentence form was forced upon primitive men by nature itselfIt was not we who made itit was a reflection of the temporal order in causationAll truth has to be expressed in sentences because all truth It seems to me that the normal and typical sentence in English as is the transference of powerThe type of sentence in nature is a flash of lightningIt passes between two termsa cloud and the earthNo unit of natural process can be less than thisAll natural processes arein their unitsas much as thisLightheatgravitychemical affinityhuman will have this in commonthat they redistribute forceTheir unit of process can be represented asterm transference term from of to which force which If we regard this transference as the conscious or unconscious act of an agent we can translate the diagram intoagent actobject In this the act is the very substance of the fact denotedThe agent and the ob ect are only limiting termswell as in Chinese expresses just this unit of natural processIt consists of three necessary wordsthe first denoting the agent or subject from which the act startsthe second embodying the very stroke of the actthe third pointing to the objectthe receiver of the impactThusThe form of the Chinese transitive sentenceand of the Englishomitting particlesexactly corresponds to this universal form of action in natureThis brings language close to thingsand in its strong reliance upon verbs it erects all speech into a kind of dramatic poetryA different sentence order is frequent in inflected languages like TatinGerman or JapaneseThis iis because they are inflectedi e they have little tags and word endingsor labels to show which is the agentthe objectetcIn uninflected languageslike English and Chinesethere is nothing but the order of the words to distinguish their functionsAnd this order would be no sufficient indicationwere it not the natural orderthat isthe order of cause and effectIt is true that there arein languageintransitive and passive formssentences built out of the verbto be and finally negative formsTo grammarians and logicians these have seemed more primitive than the transitiveor at least exceptions to the transitiveI had long suspected that these apparently exceptional forms had grown from the transitive or worn away from it by alterationor modificationThis view is confirmed by Chinese exampleswherein it is still possible to watch the transformation going onThe intransitive form derives from the transitive by dropping a generalizedcustomaryreflexive or cognate object He runsa race The sky reddensitself We breatheairThus we get weak and incomplete sentences which suspend the picture and lead us to think of some verbs as denoting states rather than actsOutside grammar the wordstatewould hardly be recognized as scientificWho can doubt that when we say The wall shines we mean that it actively reflects light to our eyeThe beauty of Chinese verbs is that they are all transitive or intransitive at pleasureThere is no such thing as a naturally intransitive verbThe passive form is evidently a correlative sentencewhich turns about and makes the object into a subjectThat the object is not in itself passivebut contributes some poisitive force of its own to the actionis in harmony both with scientific law and with ordinary experienceThe English passive voice withisseemed at first an obstacle to this hypothesisbut one suspected that the true form was a generalized transitive verb meaning something likereceive which had degenerated into an auxiliaryIt was a delight to find this the case in ChineseIn nature there are no negationsno possible transfers of negative forceThe presence of negative sentences in language would seem to corroborate the logiciansview that assertion is an arbitrary subjective actWe can assert a negationthough nature can notBut here again science comes to our aid against the logician all apparently negative or disruptive movements bring into play other positive forcesIt requires great effort to annihilateTherefore we should suspect thatif we could follow back the history of all negative particleswe should find that they also are sprung from transitive verbsIt is too late todemonstrate such derivations in the Aryan languagesthe clue has been lostbut in Chinese we can still watch positive verbal conceptionspassing over into so called negativesThus in Chinese the sign meaningto be lost in the forestrelates to a state of non existenceEnglishnot the Sanskrit nowhich may come from the root noto be lostto perishLastly comes the infinitive which substitutes for a specific colored verb the universal copulais followed by a noun or an adjectiveWe do nor say a treegreens itself butthe tree is green not thatmonkeys bring forth live young but thatthe monkey is a mammal This is an ultimate weakness of languageIt has come from generalizing all intransitive words into oneAsliveseewalkbreathe are genen lized into states by dropping their objectsso these weak verbs are in turn reduced to the ahstractest state of allnamelybare existenceThere is in reality no such verb as a pure copulano such original conceptionour very word exist meansto stand forth to show oneself by a definite act Iscomes from the Aryan root asto breathe Beis from bhuto growIn Chinese the chief verb forisnot only means activelyto have but shows by its derivation that it expresses something even more concretenamely to snatch from the moon with the hand Here the baldest symbol of prosaic analysis is transformed by magic into a splendid flash of concrete poetryI shall not have entered vainly into this long analysis of the sentence if I have succeeded in showing how poetical is the Chinese form and how close to natureIn translating Chineseverse especiallywe must hold as closely as possible to ithe concrete force of the originaleschewing adjectivesnouns and intransitive forms wherever we canand seeking instead strong and individual verbsLastly we notice that the likeness of form between Chinese and English sentences renders translation from one to the other exceptionally easyThe genius of the two is much the sameFrequently it is possible by omitting English particles to make a literal word for word translation which will be not only intelligible in Englishbut even the strongest and most poetical EnglishHerehoweverone must follow closely what is saidnot merely What is abstractly meantLet us go back from the Chinese sentence to the individual written WordHlow are such words to be classifiedAre some of them nouns by naturesome verbs and some adjectives Are there pronouns and prepositions and conjunctions in Chinese as in good Christian languagesOne is led to suspect from an analysis of the Aryan languages that such differeces are not naturaland that they have been unfortunately invented by grammarians to confuse the simple poetic outlook on lifeAll nations have written their strongest and most vivid literature before they invented a grammarMoreoverall Aryan etymology points back to roots which are the equivalents of simple Sanskrit verbssuch as we find tabulated at the back of our SkeatNature herself has no grammar Fancy picking up a man and telling him that he is a nouna dead thing rather than a bundle of functions Apart of speechis only what it doesFrequently our lines of cleavage failone part of speech acts for anotherThey act for one another because they were originally one and the sameFew of us realize that in our own language these very differences once grew up in living articulationthat they still retain lifeIt is only when the difficulty of placing some odd term arises or when we are forced to translate into some very different languagethat we attain for a moment the inner heat of thoughta heat which melts down the parts of spech to recast them at willOne of the most interesting facts about the Chinese language is that in it we can seenot only the forms of sentencesbut literally the parts of speech growing upbudding forth one from anotherLike naturethe Chinese words are alive and plasticbecause thing and action are not Even Latin living Latinhad not the network they foist upon unfortunate school childrenThese are borrowed sometimes from Greek grammarianseven as I have seen English grammars borrowing oblique cases from Latin grammarsSometimes they sprang from the gram matizing or categorizing passion of pedantsLiving Latin had only the feel of the casesThe ablative and dative eotionEP formallyseparatedThe Chinese language naturally knows no grammarIt is only lately that foreignersEuropean and Japanesehave begun to torture this vital speech by forcing it to fit the bed of their definitionsWe import into our reading of Chinese all the weakness of our own formalismsThis is especially sad in poetrybecause the one necessityeven in our own poetryis to keep words as flexible as possibleas full of the sap of natureLet us go further with our exampleIn English we callto shinea verb in the infinitivebecause it gives the abstract meaning of the verb without conditionsIf we want a corresponding adjective we take a different word bright If we need a noun we sayluminosity which is abstractbeing derived from an adjective To get a tolerably concrete nounwe have to leave behind the verb and adjective rootsand light upon a thing arbitrarily cut off from its power of actionsaythe sunorthe moon Of course there is nothing in nature so cut offand therefore this nounizing is itself an abstractionEven if we did have a common word underlying at once the verbshine the adjectivebright and the nounssiun we should probably call it aninfinitive of the infinitive According to our ideasit should be something extremely abstracttoo intangible for useThe Chinese have one wordmingor metIts ideograph is the sign of the sun together with the sign of the moonIt serves as verbnounadjectiveThus you write literally the sun and moon of the cupforthe cup s brightnessPlaced as a verbyou writethe cup sun and moons actuallycup sun and moon or in a weakened thought is like sun ie shines Sun and moon cupis naturally a bright cupThere is no possible confusion of the real meaningthough a stupid scholar may spend a week trying to decide whatpart of speechhe should use in translating a very simple and direct thought from Chinese to EnglishThe fact is that almost every written Chinese word is properly just such an underlying wordand yet it is not abstractIt is not exclusive of parts of speechbut comprehensivenot something which is neither a nounverbor adjectivebutsomething which is all of them at once and at all timesUsage may incline the full meaning now a little more to one sidenow to anotheraccording to the point of viewbut through all cases the poet is free to deal with it richly and concretelyas does natureA good

transformationsthe cataclysmic changes which are taking place in the life of the worldBefore our eyes unfolds the greatest pageant of all historythe drama of the Social RevolutionIt is our hope that we may serve in some small measure as the interpreter of this tremendous movementand of the concomitant changes in politicseconomicsindustryartethics and scienceAmerican literature has need of freeunfettered expression of the profoundest realities of existenceWe must break away from the popular and prevalent sentimentalism of the dayWe must stop appealing to the jaded intellect of theTired
