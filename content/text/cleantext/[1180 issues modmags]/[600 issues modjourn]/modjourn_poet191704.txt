in a book  And your mouth of blue pansy I know somewhere I have seen it rain shattered  And I have seen a woman with her head flung between her naked knees and her head held there listening to the sea the great naked sea shouldering a load of salt  And the blue pansy mouth sang to the sea  Mother of God I m so little a thing Let me sing longer Only a little longer  And the sea shouldered its salt

on a baby face The shafts across her bed are flimmering  Out on the land White Moon shines Shines and glimmers against gnarled shadows All silver to slow twisted shadows Falling across the long road that runs from the house  Keep a little of your beauty And some of your flimmering silver For her by the window to night Where you come in White Moon  EARLY MOON  The baby moon a canoe a silver papoose canoe sails and sails in the Indian west A ring of silver foxes a mist of silver foxes sit and sit around the Indian moon   Early Moon  One yellow star for a runner and rows of blue stars for more runners keep a line of watchers  O foxes baby moon runners you are the panel of memory fire white writing to night of the Red Man s dreams Who squats legs crossed and arms folded matching its look  against the moon face the star faces of the West  Who are the Mississippi Valley ghosts of copper foreheads riding wiry ponies in the night no bridles love arms on the pony necks riding in the

I see her heels flash down the dust of an Illinois race track on a summer afternoon I see the timekeepers put their heads together over stop watches and call to the grand stand a split second is clipped off the old world s record and a new world s record fixed  I see the mare Alix led away by men in undershirts and streaked faces Dripping Alix in foam of white on the harness and shafts And the men in undershirts kiss her ears and rub her nose and tie blankets on her and take her away to have the sweat sponged   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I see the grand stand jammed with prairie people yelling themselves hoarse Almost the grand stand and the crowd of thousands are one pair of legs and one voice standing up and yelling hurrah  I see the driver of Alix and the owner smothered in a fury of handshakes a mob of caresses I see the wives of the driver and owner smothered in a crush of white summer dresses and parasols  Hours later at sundown gray dew creeping on the sod and sheds I see Alix again  Dark shining velvet Alix  Night sky Alix in a gray blanket  Led back and forth by a nigger  Velvet and night eyed Alix  With slim legs of steel  And I want to rub my nose against the nose of the mare Alix  GARGOYLE  I saw a mouth jeering A smile of melted red iron ran over it Its laugh was full of nails rattling It was a child s dream of a mouth  A fist hit the mouth knuckles of gun metal driven by an electric wrist and shoulder It was a child s dream of an arm   Gargoyle  The fist hit the mouth over and over again and again The mouth bled melted iron and laughed its laughter of nails rattling  And I saw the more the fist pounded the more the mouth laughed The fist is pounding and pounding and the mouth answering  PRAIRIE WATERS BY NIGHT  Chatter of birds two by two raises a night song joining a litany of running water sheer waters showing the russet of old stones remembering many rains  And the long willows drowse on the shoulders of the running water and sleep from much music joined songs of day end feathery throats and stony waters in a choir chanting new psalms  It is too much for the long willows when low laughter of a red moon comes down and the willows drowse and sleep on the shoulders of the running water  MOON SET  Leaves of poplars pick Japanese prints against the west Moon sand on the canal doubles the changing pictures The moon s good bye ends pictures The west is empty All else is empty No moon talk at all now Only dark listening to dark   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  GARDEN WIRELESS  How many feet ran with sunlight water and air  What little devils shaken of laughter cramming their little ribs with chuckles  Fixed this lone red tulip a woman s mouth of passion kisses a nun s mouth of sweet thinking here topping a straight line of green a pillar stem  Who hurled this bomb of red caresses nodding balloon film shooting its wireless every fraction of a second these June days Love me before I die Love me love me now  IN TALL GRASS  Bees and a honeycomb in the dried head of a horse in a pasture corner a skull in the tall grass and a buzz and a buzz of the yellow honey hunters  And I ask no better a winding sheet over the earth and under the sun  Let the bees go honey hunting with yellow blur of wings in the dome of my head in the rumbling singing arch of my skull   In Tall Grass  Let there be wings and yellow dust and the drone of dreams of honey who loses and remembers who keeps and forgets  In a blue sheen of moon over the bones and under the hanging honeycomb the bees come home and the bees sleep  BRINGERS  Cover me over In dusk and dust and dreams  Cover me over And leave me alone  Cover me over You tireless great  Hear me and cover me Bringers of dusk and dust and dreams  Carl Sandburg   POETRY A Magazine of

unseen loveliness carol and sing  Colored with buds of delight the boughs are swaying Beauty walks in the woods and wherever she rove Flowers from wintry sleep her enchantment obeying Stir in the deep

Down the by road called Romance Past the wicked witch s grate Just outside the village gate But the oven fire was dead And I saw no ginger bread Youths and maidens propped with care Up against the wall and there Was never sign of cat or toad Or broomstick with its eery load Nothing but an empty thatch Where bats and mice would scorn to scratch  Past the gate within the town Red tiled roofs were tumbling down While the town clock smoky dour Struck a melancholy hour Though it used to run askew And skip a century or two As it chose and spin around Backwards if it liked the sound   Prussians Don

BATTLE  You laughed and said A zut and in a trice Lifted Celeste in circles twice or thrice Above the hangar roof and then sped on And up and shot away and so were gone And when they found you like a wasp beside  The carcass of the Luftschiff still you cried A zut mes braves and laughed and then you died    To a French Aviator Fallen in Battle  It may be best you came to ground that way For who knows where your vivid careless play Of spirit and bravado might have led Some night you might have kept straight on instead And then at dawn perhaps with some surprise Alight have beheld the roofs of Paradise Perched like Montmartre upon a little hill Speckless and gabled fresh and very still  And you would twist and duck and hover down And circle round the walls above the town With saints and martyrs standing over awed To see you planing on the winds of God  Perhaps you might come down at twelve o clock To puff a caporal and sip a bock  Morris Gilbert   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  OUT OF MEXICO  VELARDENA SUNSET  When I saw the hills before dawn They were of the texture of thin gauze The sky shone through  Now they are molten hills Like metal on the lip of a crater they palpitate and change Radiant volatile The iron ravines flare and glow Scarlet lava brims the arroyo channels Overflowing in rivulets It glazes the flashing sand Caverns purple dark a moment since Are boiling cauldrons of light They seethe under a primrose vapor There are no shadows anywhere Only undulating ridges of flamboyant copper Boulders of brass Precipices dripping hot gold Incandescent peaks that quiver upward And hiss at contact with the sky  Can these be the hills I saw hanging like pale rose gauze Against the door of the dawn   Santa Maria del Rio  SANTA MARIA DEL RIO  Give me crystal words

CITY AND THE TOWER  AND the whole earth was of one language and of one speech  And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and they dwelt there   And they said Go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth  And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded  And the Lord said Behold the people are one and they have all one language and this they began to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do  Go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another s speech So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth And they left off to build the city  Therefore is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth And from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth  Genesis xi 1 9  A jealous God was this plain spoken God of Genesis  darkly shrewd and with an abysmal Rabelaisian sense of  humor Observe how neatly he puts his finger on the primal  cause of his creatures sublime audacity it lies in the col  lective imagination of man united and of one speech noth  ing will be restrained from them which they have imagined  to do This collective imagination must be broken into  bits if God is to reign secure on his throne he must send   The City and the Tower  confusion of tongues to make men scatter abroad And that was the beginning of nations  The symbol is of an imposing grandeur Men have been scattered abroad into nations ever since It is as though that old jealous God were still on the watch thwarting men s efforts to get together blasting them with racial rivalries and confusion of tongues and in the last resort wars  Confusion of tongues that wise old deity recognized the power of the word He knew that nothing binds men together and makes their imaginings grow into deeds like a common speech Today he must view with alarm the spread of the English language over the earth realizing that such union in the word produces a mystic force from which nothing will be restrained He sees widely separated peoples bound so fast by it that wars within become well nigh impossible and wars without will surge against them in vain He smiles at any war lord s effort to conquer the world to conquer even neighboring nations so long as a single language is spoken over half the globe smiles indulgently perhaps knowing that even the war lord himself feels the bitter truth for is he not challenging this English word this English kultur and seeking to spread his own  Certain aspects of this prevalence of the English word stagger the imagination This word that is spoken in Australia and New Guinea in South Africa and North America and the little mother isle will it become the medium of an irresistible force the vehicle of the collective imagination of men still unborn the utterance of the song in their hearts   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Will it establish a string of democracies and set up their code of liberty for other nations Will those who speak it be so united by mystic cords of sympathy that nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do  The poet who uses English today addresses a larger potential audience than any predecessor of whatever race He has a greater chance to become the mouthpiece of that collective imagination which even the gods can not resist Think of the little isolated world that Homer addressed or Sophocles Virgil Dante Think of Shakespeare s little England of Pope s little London of the tightly guarded island ramparts around Coleridge and Keats Today a wee small song in Winnipeg may be megaphoned to the ends of the earth and a note struck in Oklahoma may ring brazen bells in Peking  But just because his potential audience is so large our poet is in danger of losing it altogether When London was a village she could listen to her few singers when New York was a colony any singer at all was a miracle But now all the poets of a thousand cities are striving to enchant the whole vast English speaking world and so that world hears only a confusion of voices and listens to few or none The danger is that the man of vision may be blasted by immensities immensities of sound and silence of crowds and emptiness of truth and denial hope and despair The danger is that he may lose that primitive faith in life which leads men to build a tower whose top may reach unto heaven in order listen to the proud and tragic reason in order to make us a name lest we be scattered abroad into oblivion   The City and the Tower  The old sublime audacity which shall challenge the Lord on his throne that is what the modern poet needs whether he speak in words or deeds Power which shall gather up the tremendous modern forces and use them for love instead of hate for union instead of separation power which shall build a mighty tower to bring down heaven to earth Then indeed an era will dawn which shall amaze the gods for nothing will be restrained from men which they have imagined to do  But as yet that old jealous God of Genesis sits secure on his throne How long must the tides of time roll on before he hears once more man s audacious challenge before he comes down a second time to see the city and the tower and finds that the people are one and they have all one language  Perhaps by that time the mystic cycle of destiny may be rounded out to full completeness so that he may be willing to take up his abode among men at last H M  VERNER VON HEIDENSTAM  When the Nobel committee awarded the prize for literature for 1916 to the Swedish poet and novelist Verner von Heidenstam this was greeted by the entire country with the same enthusiastic approval as when the choice some years ago fell on Selma Lagerl√≤f  Probably no other country can boast of having two of the foremost among its poets humbly place themselves at the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  service of the school In The Wonderful Journey of Little Niels Selma Lagerl√≤f has depicted to Swedish children the country of Sweden with the great love she has for both and with the wonderful poetic beauty which has given this epoch making work a unique place in the book world of the school  Very different but of the same high literary value is Heidenstam s book for school children The Swedes and Their Chiefs Bound to follow its instructive purpose it is not a free poetic creation like Heidenstam s other historic works but exhibits on each page its author s forceful style  Heidenstam s first books were all written in prose but a prose that lies far from that language of everyday conversation and newspaper style which so many of his contemporaries had religiously adopted as an expression for true realism With Heidenstam begins the literary Swedish renascence in which are counted such names as Selma Lagerl√≤f Per Hallstr√≤m E A Karlfeldt Oscar Levertin and Gustai Fr√≤ding  Like Selma Lagerl√≤f Heidenstam had passed the age of thirty before publishing in 1888 his first book Years of Wandering and Pilgrimage This was rapidly followed by the traveling sketches From Col di Tenda to Blocksberg the novel Endymion and the great heroic epos Hans Alienus born out of a poet s inspiration and a philosopher s meditations about life its ideal of happiness and its tragedy Hans Alienus the restless seeker of truth and beauty all over the globe and through all ages is Heidenstam s own youth spent in worldwide travels with the longing for home hidden half   Verner von Heidenstam  unconsciously in the depths of his soul to return at last to the country of his birth convinced of the vanity of any attempt to pursue happiness outside of his own soul  Heidenstam then returned to the love of his early youth lyric poetry and published in 1895 his first volume of Poems the most individual creation he had until then given A high song in praise of high idealism of a national idealism so pure and full that the air itself sings with joyous expectation that every wife is to bear a Messiah  Heidenstam s best known historic work is The Carolins thirty four short stories depicting the epoch glorious in Swedish history of Charles XII and his faithful warriors but it is the masterly psychologic knowledge of human nature from the fantastic and contradictory character of the King which runs like a red thread through the book to the feelings of the small drum boy that gives to this work its chief interest  Several other important historic works followed The Carolins foremost among them The Pilgrimage of Holy Birgitta In all these he has made Swedish history live anew in the hearts of his people made it a real and cherished possession for old and young not merely a dry science with innumerable dreaded dates and names  But still it is as a lyric poet that Heidenstam has given his country most He has gradually reached a higher and wider horizon but in spite of his aristocratic aloofness and the decidedly unpopular vein of his poetry he has become the poet under whose banner the others have gathered in POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the last decades His works have become classic and are being published in cheap popular editions already during his life time Verner von Heidenstam and Gustai Fr√≤ding the two who wrought their intuitive philosophy of life into poetry of wondrous strength and beauty and who incarnated the national character of their people in song and prose stand foremost as representatives of the idealistic school of writers in Sweden  Almost all of Heidenstam s works have been translated into German and several of them successfully into English  Svea Bernhard  REVIEWS  YOUTH AT WAR  Poems by Alan Seeger with an introduction by William  Archer Charles Scribner s Sons  This volume is almost the work of two authors for the hand that penned Juvenilia was a very different hand from that which gave us Last Poems If Alan Seeger had not fallen at the front would the former collection have met with the consideration now accorded it Could we for instance knowing nothing of the story of its author give it the same heed that we give it now when the glamor of a brave and chivalrous death is upon it I think that this poet would be the first to ask that it be given the unbiassed judgment granted to the work of writers of less romantic career   Youth at War  Juvenilia well named breathes youth in every stanza youth in love with life in love with love color sound romance pleasure the virile but untried youth that existed before the war Had Alan Seeger not gone to the front had he succeeded in finding a publisher for his work when he took it to London in the summer of 1914 I think that his place as a poet would have been no higher than that of many others writing to day Many of these poems although sincere are over long full of the literary manner of a past hour not free from the influence of various masters The Deserted Garden is rich with color fragrance imagery and bears evidence of the poet s long sojourn in Mexico La Nue is the embodiment of the id√©e fixe through which adolescence views the world at large In treatment it suggests Gautier s Contralto It contains beautiful lines these for example  I watched thy white feet moving in the mire  And thy white forehead hid among the stars  Paris is the Paris soft with pleasure keen in the search of the senses for beauty and love and it sings one word desire In many of the poems he takes off his gloves quite frankly another sign of youth The Juvenilia throughout throb with the impetuosity of passion joy love life and may be characterized by this closing of An Ode to Antares  At Earth s great market where Joy is trafficked in Buy while thy purse yet swells with golden youth  In Last Poems we find the second author the author emerged from his baptism by fire The seeker whose every fibre of exuberant health ached for adventure has come at   last to its very heart Yet here we have no morbid dwelling on the atrocities of war which other and less restrained imaginations have brought to poetry but the manly singing of one who knows his battlefield Stern they come to us these poems divested of rhetorical trappings consistent with one exception in simple dignity and beauty The Aisne 191415 rings vitally The now famous I Have a Rendezvous with Death sings itself over with more and more of appeal The sonnets here while a few are of indifferent value far surpass those in Juvenilia the two entitled Bellinglise being the best A Message to America is a childish mixture of glorification and vituperation more journalistic than poetical and is the one flaw in this otherwise noble collection The  Ode in Memory of the American Volunteers Fallen for France to have been read before the statue of Lafayette and Washington in Paris on Decoration Day May 30 1916 is so fine a thing that I wish I might quote the whole of it Since my praise would be necessarily more or less a repetition of William Archer s words I will make him my spokesman  Completed in two days during which he was engaged in the hardest sort of labor in the trenches this Ode is certainly the crown of the poet s achievement It is entirely admirable entirely adequate to the historic occasion If the war has produced a nobler utterance it has not come my way  In this Ode as Mr Archer points out Seeger wrote his own epitaph  Now heaven be thanked we gave a few brave drops Now heaven be thanked a few brave drops were ours   Youth at War  Through all of these poems runs the poet s blind acceptance of the war idea To say that war produces nobility is one thing to say that it is in itself noble is to show misapprehension of principles greater than human strength alone And when poets come to emphasize this in their work a higher ideal of honor will stimulate mankind Here again Mr Archer has voiced so exactly the feelings I have had in reading all of these war poems that again I must quote from his understandingly beautiful introduction  Some of us may hope and believe that in after years when he was at leisure to view history in perspective and carry his psychology a little deeper he would have allowed if not more potency at any rate more adaptability to the human will In order to do so it would not have been necessary to abandon his fatalistic creed He would have seen perhaps that even if we only will what we have to will the factors which shape the will of the individual the nation or the race are always changing and that it is not only possible but probable that the factors which make for peace may one day gain the upper hand of those which for perfectly definite and tangible reasons have hitherto made for war  A F  A FLOCK FROM OXFORD  Wheels An Anthology of Verse Blackwell Oxford Long  mans Green

is a loss to poetry as well as to those who knew him It strikes me that real artists who have been plunged into the present inferno have written simply and without rhetoric without any glorification of war Gaudier Brzeska wrote back from the front that the nightingales were still singing despite the bombardment Tennant writes in similar vein  Green gardens in Levantie Soldiers only know the 9treet Where the mud is churned and splashed about By battle wending feet  Two roofless ruins stand And here among the wreckage where the back wall should have been The grass was trodden on   among the vivid blades Of soft and tender grass We lay nor heard the limber wheels That pass and ever pass  Hungry for spring I bent my head The perfume fanned my face And all my soul was dancing In that little lovely place Dancing with measured step from the wrecked and shattered towns Away upon the Downs  I saw green banks of daffodil Slim poplars in the breeze Great tan brown hares in gusty March   A Flock from Oxford  A courting on the leas And meadows with their glittering streams and silver scurrying dace Home what a perfect place The poem is written with prose simplicity with the possible exception of battle wending there is no over decorative word These properties are of more importance than the very much over emphasized present question of free or regular verse Most of the anthology is in the older forms Miss Cunard shows at times surprising closeness of thought and a talent for epithets with her dwarfs with slyly pointed steps and her aged abstractions Love Joy Sin in solemn stage learnt ecstasy She uses the sonnet like most poets at the beginning of their course without recognizing that the sonnet is a peculiar costume Like duck trousers or a scarlet hunting coat it is suitable on some occasions and not quite fitting on others Few forms save the classic quantitive measures are a better drill ground for one s early effort but a sense of form is not shown by trying to fit matter which is not essentially a sonnet into the sonnet shell Miss Cunard manages best in the sonnet Uneasiness She abandons the form in From the Train  Smoke stacks coal stacks hay stacks slack Colorless scentless pointless dull Railways highways roadways black Grantham Birmingham Leeds and Hull  Steamers passengers convoys trains Merchandise travelling over the sea Smut filled streets and factory lanes What can these ever mean to me   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Both Sacheverell and Edith Sitwell show promise the latter using alternate ten and six syllable lines with excellent rhythmic and tonal effect but with an inexcusable carelessness as to meaning and to the fitness of expression The anthology closes with some excellent prose translations from Rimbaud by H Rootham We would welcome a complete translation in the same manner E P  The Escaped Princess by W R Childe Thursday s Child by E Rendali Bohemian Glass by E L Duff Contacts by T W Earp The Iron Age by Frank Betts The Two Worlds by Sherard Vines The Burning Wheel by Aldous Huxley Op I by Dorothy Sayres A Vagabond s Wallet by S Reid Heyman Adventurers All Series  B H Blackwell Oxford England  This series is a rare example of the art of book making which might long ago have excited Elzevirian envy There is a quiet invitation in the refined colors of its paper bindings The type within is no less a joy Yet it brings us disappointment for the greater part of its work is of amateur value  Mr Childe leads the adventurers and takes and gives a certain pleasure by simple music of speech Some of his poems suggest the days that brought forth Gray s Elegy We could wish that one capable of writing The Recognition a fine thing and The Fortunate Soul another had refrained from such outworn plaintiveness of expression as the heart of me and from such outworn errors as their strong limbs beautiful or the blue dusk cool   A Flock from Oxford  And of Laughter That Was a Changeling has whimsical charm and makes promises that are not fulfilled in Miss Rendall s other poems Her work also seems old fashioned and again we come upon the plaintive of me they will do it This author seems at her best in her child poems although her Si Chuanese folk songs are interesting and have beauty They are not translations but original studies of a country she has known well  Miss Duff s work shows a pretty talent such as one met in autograph albums twenty years ago It is therefore surprising to stumble upon a good line now and then and near the close of her book a poem called Jehane the Queen Breaks Silence in the old classic language shows thought and a good touch Mr T W Earp needs only a thief a lady with a lute a king surrounded by glittering queens Olympus Narcissus etc to weave his traditional patterns His few short poems in vers libre gathered under the sub title Chisellings appear to have more life to give us  Fifth in the series is The Iron Age by Frank Betts Here we hark back to old times their themes being treated in a Macaulayan manner with flourish of arms and sounding rhymes and metres It would take a decidedly new kind of poet to make us enjoy ourselves thoroughly in the company of Dionysos Constantine Louis XI and the Olympian deities in spite of a preface by Gilbert Murray  Dorothy Sayres in her first Opus moves on more or less archaically and there are lyrical stanzas Now and then the beginning of a poem makes us feel that we are really   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  about to find something out of the ordinary and then it will fall just short of excellence Yet such lyrics as Pipes Carol and Last Morning in Oxford show promise  At the outset of The Soul s Defence Sherard Vines over enamored of his rhyme has rushed at it with such lack of regard to accent that after all he has almost lost the poor little thing This is an unfortunate opening to a volume which contains some good poems better as one progresses The Pack is strong and A Drinking Song extremely well sung The Grasping Peasant is one of the best It would seem as though the author in advancing grew bolder in thought more daring as to form casting aside tritenesses and careless rhymes that mar the first part of the work There is even occasionally an almost brutal recklessness as in  War strike  Last night we nearly killed a scab the swine Kicked his face open Did he pray or whine Not he but Kill me if you like he said I don t know I d not just as soon be dead With men like you stopping steam coal to feed Our ships in the cold sea and all for greed God haven t any of you boys away In France there fighting  In The Burning Wheel by Aldous Huxley we come upon the cream of the series The work as a whole while uneven has more originality more of the professional manner too than have been evident in the other adventurers Aldous Huxley has something to say and says it well The title poem which is in vers libre is perhaps the least interesting thing in the book this poet being more at home in the old paths The Mirror is beautiful also The Complaint An   A Flock from Oxford  original little poem fills page 27 Its first line sped me to my dictionary but the picture of the little house is suggestively agreeable  Its windows throw a friendly light Between the narrowing shutter slats And golden as the eyes of cats Shine me a welcome through the night  The best thing about A Vagabond s Wallet is its title The contents of the wallet show a reflective mind but the reflections are cast in outworn patterns of word and form  There is something teasing about this little band of pilgrims Their bright hued garments and their alluring titles led us to expect so much As it is only two of them appear distinctly as bearers of promise for the future Sherard Vines and Aldous Huxley The work of these has flavor because it shows less conscious literary effort than we have found in the others and it rewards our long search by flashes of genuine beauty A F  FROM INDIA  The Golden Threshold by Sarojini Naidu John Lane Co  New York William Heinemann London  Perhaps because one catches flame from Arthur Symons beautiful introduction through which shines the radiantly elusive personality of this young Hindu woman these poems are strangely alluring  They are subtle delicately wrought lyrics self conscious with the same quiet poise that pervades the Hindu classics a poise that disregards with mystic certainty the confusing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  sense of the plurality of the universe which colors so much western thinking and finds in the simplicity which remains an essense of pure beauty We will conquer the sorrow of life with the sorrow of songs sings the poet triumphantly in one of the most beautiful of these poems and in the phrase sums up her dream  The poems are rather unequal in poetic quality but in the best of them along with a true lyric cadence burns an extraordinary vividness of feeling In the following called Ecstasy this vividness mounts to what Symons happily calls an agony of sensation  Cover mine eyes O my love Mine eyes that are weary of bliss As of light that is poignant and strong Oh silence my lips with a kiss My lips that are weary of song  Shelter my soul O my love My soul is bent low with the pain And the burden of love like the grace Of a flower that is smitten with rain Oh shelter my soul from thy face  At times the poems are more strongly nationalistic This  called Leili might almost in its color and imagery be an  incidental lyric in Kalidasa s Shakuntala  The serpents are asleep among the poppies The fireflies light the soundless panther s way To tangled paths where shy gazelles are straying  And parrot plumes outshine the dying day Oh soft the lotus buds upon the stream Are stirring like sweet maidens when they dream  A caste mark on the azure brows of heaven The golden moon burns sacred solemn Bright   From India  The winds are dancing in the forest temple  And swooning at the holy feet of Night Hush in the silence mystic voices sing And make the gods their incense offering  Mrs Naidu has made in The Golden Threshold a really  valuable contribution not only to our understanding of the  modern Hindu heart but to the annals of the English lyric  E T  FROM CANADA  Lundy s Lane and Other Poems by Duncan Campbell Scott George H Doran Co In a book of conventional verse beginning with a futile  ballad one meets now and then a mood of high austerity fitly expressed There would seem to be hidden somewhere in this Canadian of the Scottish names a poet capable of deep communion with nature a fact which makes us regret all the more the lumbering and cumbersone imitations of Victorian imitations and the tiresome banalities and trivialities which usually content him  Among the best poems are New Year s Night I916 An Impromptu parts of Spring on Mattagami and this Night which suggests ancient impenetrable silences  The night is old and all the world Is wearied out with strife A long gray mist lies heavy and wan Above the house of life  Four stars burn up and are unquelled By the low shrunken moon Her spirit draws her down and down She shall be buried soon   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  There is a sound that is no sound Yet fine it falls and clear The whisper of the spinning earth To the tranced atmosphere  An odor lives where once was air A strange unearthly scent From the burning of the four great stars Within the firmament  The universe deathless and old  Breathes yet is void of breath  As still as death that seems to move  And yet is still as death  H M  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  LA VOCE AND ITS POETS  If Italy is producing any successors to Carducci D Annunzio and Pascoli the most promising place to look for them is in the pages of La Voce a semi monthly review published in Florence  Few competent critics would deny to Aldo Palazzeschi and Corrado Govoni their place in the first rank of Italian litt√©rateurs of to day many would rate them the two best contemporary poets of their country Both are regular contributors to La Voce and the neighbors they find in its pages such men as Sbarbaro Papini Benedetti Onofri Di Giacomo Soffici Luciani and Bastianelli are of a quality to urge them on to always finer production A writer of somewhat less reputation perhaps than Palazzeschi and Govoni but one who has done work of very unusual merit is Piero Jahier Such men supported by the prose writers philosophers and   La Voce and its Poets  critics of La Voce place it as the best literary review of the Italy of our time  It was founded some eight years ago by Giuseppe Prezzolini a vigorous essayist who combines scholarly attainments with incisive thinking whether his subject be international affairs or art Among his articles on the war may be found some of the most striking ideas that the present struggle has called forth After directing La Voce for some time Prezzolini turned the review over to its present chief G De Robertis another essayist and poet of distinguished qualities The political tendency of the review is strongly nationalist though in a broad sense and without any of that foolish nationalism which tries to establish frontiers in art  On the contrary one of La Voce s most constant writers the poet painter Ardengo Soffici was the organizer in company with Prezzolini of the first exhibition of the French impressionist painters held in Florence for he has been a determined struggler for advance in all forms of art He has repeatedly written in defense of the new movements in painting has contributed to them through his own canvases and has made very interesting researches in literary expression parallel with those of the modern painters While combatting at least in many instances the excesses of the futurists La Voce is distinctly modern in its whole viewpoint Soffici and the philosophic writer Giovanni Papini now one of its regular contributors were the founders of Lacerba the most advanced of Italian periodicals at least in point of opinions La Voce may now fairly claim to be the successor of Lacerba   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and whether considered for its splendid development of vers  libre its criticism or its philosophical and political opinions  it is such an expression of present day Italy as no student  can afford to neglect Walter Pack  CORRESPONDENCE  Dear POETRY Here are a few of my sensations ON READING THE BRAITHWAITE ANTHOLOGY FOR 1916  All the poets have been stripping Quaintly into moonbeams slipping Running out like wild Bacchantes Minus lingerie and panties Never heard of such a frantic Belvederean Corybantic Highty tighty Aphrodite Stepping out without a nightie  Edward started with his tragic Pan Hellenic pantless Magic Page 14 and quite as bare Mrs Jean Starr In a mood as unsartorial Leaves her Clothes as a memorial Like Carlyle at Craigenputtock Dancing out to show her courage  At 34 one has to sneeze  For where oh where is her chemise And then leaping like a roe buck Comes athletic Victor Starbuck In among the water lilies Dipping like a young Achilles Then across the woods he scrambles Woods are never full of brambles And in raiment of Apollo   Correspondence  Sits all night in a damp hollow  Like another drenched Ulysses  Scaring the Phaeacian misses  Till progressive Nausica√†  Led him home to her deah fathah  All the frogs were frightened green  You ll find it all on 114

Elinore  Just a baby barely four  And her parents feeling pally  Took her to the Russian ballet  Where in baby mood ecstatic  She approved them acrobatic From Le Midi d un Faune  To that white and wondrous Swan  Cleopatra s eyes of jade  To that mad Scheherazade  Then one morning my good sister Pausing at her housework missed her Elinore of yellow hair Did not answer anywhere Down before the house she found her With admiring babies round her Clad in one small shoe and stocking On her tiny bare toes rocking Pirouetting so sedately Chubby funny staid and stately Gravely tripping the fandango Or some Lilliputian tango All her baby body given A white daisy unto Heaven When her mother stooped to fold her In her arms she could not scold her Though by this time all the neighbors Had resigned their morning labors For my sister knew the answer For this naked little dancer Who had shocked the postman slightly Pacing up the street so tritely Leaving letters at the door Of the sprightly Elinore Had he known Braithwaite s Anthology He had needed no apology All the constellations show it Elinore will be a poet  Willard Wattles  NOTES  Only three of the poets represented in
