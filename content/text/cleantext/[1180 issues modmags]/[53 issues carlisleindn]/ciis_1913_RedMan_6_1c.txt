T IS strange that the Province of Pennsylvania, founded as it was upon principles of peace and good will with the red men who lived upon the shores of the Delaware, should have been the scene of more bloodshed and strife than any of the other English colonies. When William Penn entered into his “firm league of peace” with the Indians at Shackamaxon, in 1682, he did a unique thing in the way of colonization. His first letter to the Indians, written in 1681, is still worthy of serious thought by the white men who are brought into contact with the red men. Had its spirit animated the minds and hearts of all of the white men who have pressed the red men westward, the annals of American his- tory would not be stained with such dark blotches of blood. He says: My Friends:—There is one great God and power that hath made the world and all things therein, to whom you and I, and all people owe their being and well-being, and to whom you and I must one day give an account for all that we do in the world. Now this great God hath been pleased to make me concerned in your parts of the world, and the king of the country where I live hath given unto me a great province; but I desire to enjoy it with your love and consent, that we may always live together as neighbors and friends; else what would the great God say to us, who hath made us not to devour and destroy one another, but to live soberly and kindly together in the world. Very strangely William Penn, unlike many of the other pioneers in the colonization of the American continent, meant what he said, and lived up to this high ideal in his dealings with the Indians. Had the same Indian policy been carried out by every white man, from the shores of the Delaware to the Pacific Ocean, the Nationwould have saved millions of dollars and thousands of lives, and there would never have been any “Indian problem” to be solved. The Treaty at Shaclcamaxon—“not sworn to and never broken”— will always stand as the one great bright spot in the history of the colonization of this continent. Penn’s instructions to the commis- sioners who were sent to make the first settlements might well be followed by every agent and missionary in the Indian Service to- day: Be tender to the Indians. Soften them to me and the people. Let them know that you are come to sit down lovingly among them. Read to them, in their own tongue, the conditions made with them by the purchasers, that they shall deal justly with them. Make a friendship and league with them accord- ng to these conditions, which carefully observe. Had these conditions been observed, Pennsylvania never would have been drenched with the blood of the frontiersmen in the dis- astrous Indian warfare which followed the age of William Penn. But William Penn died. The old chiefs, who had gone to Phila- delphia year by year to renew the league of amity, had passed away. A new generation of warriors lived back along the winding course of the Susquehanna. Many had strayed far off to the waters of the Ohio, where they built their villages and carried on a trade with the French, from Canada. The new era had brought changes in the In- dian situation, as well as in the attitude of the provincial authorities. After the Iroquois discovered that the land, occupied by the Dela- ware and Shawnee, had a money value, they laid claim to these lands “by right of conquest,” and sold all of the lands along the Susque- hanna, even the beautiful Valley of Wyoming, to the land-hungry white invaders. The proud warriors of the Delaware and Shawnee kept moving farther and farther away from the white settlements, try- ing to escape the traffic in rum and the cabins of the frontiersmen. But the memories of William Penn, and the traditions of the honor which had been shown their fathers by the authorities at Philadelphia still lingered in their councils. It is easy to imagine how these chiefs felt when they saw the chiefs of their masters, the I roquois, taking the place which had been theirs in the councils of the white man. An Indian is just as proud as a white man when it comes to a question of taking a “back seat.” The French on the Ohio were not slow to use this opportunity. They welcomed the Delaware and Shawnee with open arms. The migrations of these tribes from the Susque-p^O'A.Xah?!™ Ilv September H wav^yi! nip- >pi yy y iyy y ^ ''HP1 ^li <0 '	,](, " TheKedMan .........■...... iiiiIII*. .,illll(itaijltllh.illlllli-illillt..idllll^j)llltt.illlJlli.-]lIfilt~*’Jlllli..jlinir,.jdllJh..^iilt^ ^ hanna grew in numbers, until at the commencement of the French and Indian War a large majority of these two allied tribes were under the influence of the French. Through the efforts of Conrad Weiser the Iroquois had been brought under the influence of the Province and had assumed a dictatorial position so far as all of the affairs of the Delaware and Shawnee were concerned. As a conse- quence, when the expedition of General Braddock was being made ready for the long and troublesome march from Fort Cumberland to Fort Duquesne, the Province of Pennsylvania west of the Sus- quehanna was absolutely under the control of the savage warriors of the tribes which had been alienated by the unwise policy of the men in power in provincial affairs. It is true that the friendship of the Iroquois had been gained, but it had been gained at the expense of the friendship of the Delaware and Shawnee. Such a course made possible the ultimate Anglo-Saxon dominion of the American continent, but it led to a literal deluge of blood upon the frontiers of Pennsylvania. From 1755 until 1794 the region west of the Sus- quehanna was the scene of a series of border wars more disastrous, in the long run of years, than any wars between the red warriors and the white settlers upon the continent. During these years hun- dreds of settlers were killed or carried into captivity, and hundreds of Indians fell before the avenging rifle of the frontiersmen. The entire region west of the mountain ridges in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and Kentucky became a veritable “dark and bloody ground" during these years. There is not a valley beyond the blue ridges of the Kittatinny Mountains which did not echo with the war- whoop of the savage avenger of his people’s wrongs. There is not a pathway leading through the mountain gaps which has not been trodden by the feet of the captives who were taken to some far dis- tant Indian village on the waters of the Ohio or into the Seneca country in western New York. Many of these captives were taken from the then sparsely settled region along the Cumberland Valley and beyond the mountain ridge in the Tuscarora and Juniata Valleys. These valleys were threaded by the Indian trails leading to the Ohio and northward to the villages on the upper branches of the Susque- hanna. It seems strange to think that these avenging war parties of red men roamed over this region which is now occupied by thriving cities, peaceful hamlets, and prosperous farms, within such a con- paratively recent period in history.> 6 'S&Gsrjsrjf •w» •»• -ii« "ip* Hjr -if «ijr -v 'iii’ ip- t , THEESBDMAN 1 Many of the captives taken by the Indians were returned after Colonel Bouquet’s expedition into the "Indian country” in Ohio in 1764. Some were put to death at the stake and many others were adopted by the various tribes. Many of the captives who had been restored to Colonel Bouquet were taken to Carlisle, and ulti- mately returned to their former homes. Bouquet’s march with this company of returned captives from the Tuscarawas Valley, in Ohio, to Fort Pitt and then on to Carlisle, was one of the most re- markable marches ever made across the mountains of Pennsylvania. His troops were made up of the frontiersmen from Virginia, the veteran Indian fighters of Pennsylvania, and the soldiers of the regular service. These acted as an escort for the captives who had been returned from the villages of the Wyandot, Delaware, and Shawnee, from the rivers and forests of Ohio. Many of them had been captured in the early days of the French and Indian War. They had forgotten all about their early life. Many of the young women had married their Indian lovers, and many of the young men had married the brown little maidens of their adopted people. Many of these hid in the forests, or escaped along the way, refusing to be returned to their own white relatives. One woman, who had been captured when but a small girl, when told that she was to be returned to her parents, said, "Will my old companions associate with the wife of an Indian chief? And my husband, who has been so kind to me—I will not desert him.” She fled from the army and returned to the home of her adoption on the waters of the Tus- carawas. When this army of Boquet reached Carlisle people came from every part of the frontier region of Virginia and Maryland, as well as from Pennsylvania, seeking for their long-lost loved ones. The historic little city of Carlisle has been the scene of many strange and wonderful gatherings, but it never witnessed a more remarkable gathering than that of those autumn days in 1764, when these cap- tives were returned to the friends whom many of them failed to rec- ognize. It was at this time that the incident, known by all, took place—of the old German woman who came seeking her daughter, who had been captured by the Indians in 1755. She could not rec- ognize this child among any of the young women in the party. Weeping she went to Colonel Bouquet and told him her trouble. He suggested that she sing one of the songs of the days when hermtnmr m m W ■' lJfrW* H i*1 wmm i jj1* September q c TheKe               DMAN f 7 a a .a. .a. a.....ZiworNT^ca'ya little ones were at home in her cabin. She then sang the plain- tive melody with which she had lulled her little ones to sleep— "Alone, yet not alone am I, Though in this solitude so drear; I feel my Saviour always nigh, He comes my every hour to cheer.” She had hardly finished these words—sung in the German language—when a young woman in Indian dress threw her arms about her neck. There were, however, many of the captiyes who never returned to their homes among the white settlers. These had married into the tribes of their captors and refused to return, even when every inducement was held out for them to do so. Among the most famous of these white captives who refused to return was Mary Jemison, or Deh-ge-wa-nus, as she was called by the Indians. The story of the life of this little Scotch-Irish woman, who was less than five feet tall, reads like a romance. Her life story was told by herself to James E. Seaver, who recorded it and later published it in a book, which has already run through seven editions. The author of this article recently visited the grave of this little woman, who passed through so many thrilling events. T his grave, now marked by a beautiful monument, is situated in one of the most wonderful spots on the continent, overlooking the Falls of the Genesee River, where this stream cuts through the great gorge at Letchworth Park, New York. In this beautiful valley, the paradise of the Seneca, within an area of 12 miles, Mary Jemison spent 72 years of her eventful life. Having been over nearly all of the trails which were trodden by the feet of this ‘"White Woman of the Genesee,” from the time of her capture to the spot where she now rests, the author of this brief sketch became inter- ested in some of the events which she mentions, but which she could not understand. She was born upon the ship which brought her parents to America in 1742, or 1743. Her father, Thomas Jemison, landed in Phila- delphia, and later moved to Marsh Creek, in Adams County. When the expedition of General Braddock was being organized at Tort Cumberland, in the spring of 1755, various raiding parties of Shawnee warriors and French soldiers scouted through the frontiers. In one of these raids a party of six Indians and four Frenchmen,.MryAXM:0! r	M n. 8 1 "7’ ..................................................................................... TheEedMam ,!|||.	nil!,..^idlL..mill, September <1 from Fort Duquesne, made an attack upon the Jemison cabin, in Buchanan Valley, in the South Mountain, and made prisoners of the family, consisting of the father and mother and three children. The two older sons, Thomas and John, escaped just before the raid. *The Indians then passed through the gap in the South Mountain, crossed the Cumberland Valley, near Chambersburg, and struck the trail leading to the Ohio around Parnall’s Knob. According to the story told by Mary Jemison, her father, mother, and brothers^ Robert and Matthew, and her sister Betsey were killed and scalped the second night after their capture. The author has found the name of “Betsey Jemison” among the list of captives returned by the Shawnee, of Ohio, to Col. Bouquet in 1764. It is possible that this may have been the sister, whom Mary supposed had been killed. The Indians took Mary to Fort Duquesne, and then on to the “mouth of the Sheninjee”—which is evidently intended for She- nango; but even the Shenango River does not enter the Ohio. In all probability, she meant the Beaver River, at the mouth of which, in 1755, was situated the Indian Village called Shingass Town. Although the narrative of Mary Jemison states that she was captured by the Indians in 1755, this is evidently an error. She states that she went up to Fort Duquesne to make peace with the British in the spring following her captivity. This would be, according to her narrative, in the spring of 1756. The British did not occupy Port Duquesne until the 25th of November, 1758. In July, 1759, George Croghan held a council with the Indi- ans from the lower Ohio. Watson’s Annals (Vol. 11, 185) gives a quotation from the New York Mercury of 1758, which reads as follows: “York County, April 5 (1758).—Three Indians wereseen this day near Thomas Jamie- son’s, at the head of Marsh Creek. After the alarm was given, six men proceeded to Jamieson’s houseand found Robert Buck killed and scalped—all the rest of the family are missing. The same day a person going to Shippenstown saw a number of Indians. These facts have caused much alarm. ” This is evidently the correct date of the capture of Mary Jemison (or Jamieson, the name should be). The spring following this date was when the Indians from the lower Ohio went to Fort Pitt to “make peace with the British.” It has been suggested to the author that the route followed by the Indian captors of Mary Jemison may have been the same as that taken by the captors of Richard Bard, Esq., who was taken prisoner on Marsh Creek, April 13, 1758. These Indians crossed the Cumberland Valley below Scotland and, passing the site of Fort McCord, entered Yankee Gap in, the Kittatinny Mountains. This route was taken to avoid passing Fort Loudon. The main direction of the course followed to Fort Duquesne, however, was that given in this article. While following this course, the Indians kept out of the well-known "New Path”, in order to escape the scouting parties of frontiersmen and soldiers. That they were able to do this is shown by the frequent raids which were made during this period.Kv September ;, THEEEDMAN | M.TATOT [v	9	-4ii fcfcT^'i*rJcn3rjii!ll Many of the white captives were taken to this place, where they were either put to death by torture or adopted by one of the Indian families. Mary was adopted by two Seneca women, who had lost a brother at Colonel Washington’s fight at Fort Necessity in 1754. About the time of the capture of Fort Duquesne by General Forbes, in 1758, Mary went with the Indians to the mouth of the Sciota River. Not long after her arrival at this place she was married to an Indian named Sheninjee. The second summer after her arrival at “Wiishto” she had a child which lived but a few days. In the fourth year of her captivity, when she was about 17 years of age, her second child, Thomas Jemison, was born. After various experiences in this region along the lower Ohio, she went with her adopted brothers, carrying her young child upon her back, over the trail leading from the Sandusky to the upper Alleghany and then on to the village of Caneadea, on the Genesee River. We can imagine what this trip of over 500 miles must have meant to this young mother. Soon after she left the Ohio her husband, Sheninjee, died. When her son was about four years old she was married to Hioka- too, one of the most famous warriors of his day. By him she had four daughters and two sons. These were all given the names of her relatives: Jane, Nancy, Betsey, Polly, John, and Jesse. Her husband, Hiokatoo, was born on the Susquehanna, about 1708, and was a cousin of “Farmers Brother,” the famous Seneca chief. He had been one of the warriors against the Cherokee and Catawba from his earliest manhood. He was one of the Seneca chiefs on the side of the French at Braddock’s defeat in 1755, and was also the leading chief in the massacre at Fort Freeland, in Northumberland County, in 1779 (not 1777, as stated in Seaver’s work), when Captain Dougherty, Boone, and 14 men were killed. This was one of the most notable events in the early history of the West Branch Valley. He was with Butler and Brandt at the massacre of Cherry Valley, in 1778, at which nearly 50 persons were killed, all but 16 of whom were women and children. He was also present at the battle of Sandusky, in 1782, when Colonel William Craford met his death at the stake. Hiokatoo, who was over six feet tall, was a warrior of piti- less savagery, even acccording to the story of his wife, whom he always treated with the greatest kindness and respect. He died in 1811, aged 103 years. After his death Mary Jemison continued to live at GardeauE 10 I bcCXTjOW y •’V^nr^rtjpr.....mry'tw •W 'W''l»^ "'^ff.g!y^.:-Hr’%.;Hi; : THEE&dMAN 3 ‘ IH* September a\\ Flats, which reservation of nearly 18,000 acres had been given to her at the Big Tree Council, in 1797. This beautiful tract of land, lying on the Genesee River, was sold by her in 1823, with the ex- ception of a tract two miles long and one wide. She sold this tract in 1831 and removed to Buffalo Creek, where she died September 19, 1833, aged 91 years. Before her death she became a Christian, going back to the teaching of her childhood. She was buried in the graveyard near the Seneca Mission, from which her remains were removed to Letchworth Park in 1874 by her grandson, James Shongo, a son of George Shongo, who had married her daughter Polly. During the years which Mary Jemison lived in the Genesee Valley she saw the gradual retreat of the people of her adoption from the “beautiful valley” of the Seneca Nation to the upper waters of the Allegheny. Again and again she had opportunities for return- ing to the people to whom she belonged by birth. This she always refused to do, even running away to hide herself whenever such a thing was suggested. She loved her Indian husband and her chil- dren, many of whom brought sorrow to her heart. But all of the sorrow which darkened the home of this adopted child of the red men was caused, as she stated, by the source of more sorrrow and trouble in Indian wigwams than scalping knife or tomahawk—the rum of the Indian trader. The scene which is now presented of the Genesee Valley, where this little Scotch-Irish Indian captive has found a final resting place, is beautiful beyond words. The quietly flowing Genesee, without a warning of its change in mood, suddenly plunges over the great rocky precipice, just below Portageville, and then goes foaming and splashing through the deep gorge, in Letchworth Park. There is no other scene to compare with it save that at Niagara—and to the author the Falls of the Genesee at this place are more beautiful. The great tree-covered hills on either side of the river, the rainbow- spanned falls at “Glen Iris”, and the beautiful Letchworth Park, presented to the State of New York by its former owner, William Pryor Letchworth, presents a picture, never to be forgotten. No king or emperor has a more wonderfully beautiful resting place than has this captive, who was stolen by the Indians from the quiet mountains of Pennsylvania. On one side of the monument over her grave, near which stands the old “Long House” of the Seneca, there is written the inscription—THE INDIANS AND GAME PRESERVATION MONTAGNAIS CHILDREN Photos b)) Courtesy of Geological Survey of CanadaSeptember -'J ■■ V 'HH V V 1 w V V V	'1li| TheEedMan 15 Jllu ..ilihl.-illllli.jllllllt.tllltli.jlllill.-^lflli.jlllllj. rfil«ll*-i'lluli,..j|l!ii(..iill!ii.. .M TO THE MEMORY OF MARY JEMISON WHOSE HOME DURING MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS OF A LIFE OF STRANGE VICISSITUDE WAS AMONG THE SENECAS UPON THE BANKS OF THIS RIVER; AND WHOSE HISTORY, INSEPARABLY CONNECTED WITH THAT OF THIS VALLEY, HAS CAUSED HER TO BE KNOWN AS "THE WHITE WOMAN of THE GENESEE.” The bronze statue which surmounts the marble monument shows Mary Jemison as the young mother of 17 years, carrying her baby from the shores of the Ohio to the Genesee Valley. Along the waters of the Genesee and along the waters of the up- per Allegheny, where many of the Seneca still live, there are to-day many families bearing the name of Jemison. These are proud of tracing their ancestry back to the Scotch-Irish mother of the clan. Thomas Jemison little dreamed, when his home was destroyed and his life taken by the Shawnee raiders into Buchanans Valley, that one of the children from that home should become the mother of a whole tribe of Seneca Indians. One of her grandsons, Jacob Jemi- son, went to Dartmouth College, studied medicine, and became a surgeon in the United States Navy. Many other grandchildren and great-grandchildren became prosperous, educated members of society. Actual history is often stranger than the wildest fiction.Advises Selling Excess Indian Land to Farmers: Address by Dana H. Kelsey. NE of the most interesting talks made at the Eastern Oklahoma Agricultural Conference held at Mus- kogee, Okla., during last February was that of Dana H. Kelsey, United States Indian Superinten- dent, who divulged, probably for the first time, many interesting facts relating to Indian lands and improvements thereon, as well as offered suggestions as how to better the Indians and thus advance the agricultural interests of the State. Many thousands of acres of valuable land are owned by the Indians in Oklahoma, and likewise many thousands of these acres are under lease and are being held for speculative pur- poses. Superintedent Kelsey took a rap at this leasing practice, and voiced the hope that the practice would be stopped. He advocates the sale of all excess Indian lands, as in that case progressive farming may be conducted on the land rather than speculation, as seems now to be the case with so many thousands of acres. Superintendent Kelsey’s address is intensely interesting, and is given herewith in full, as follows: “Mr. Darby has asked me for an expression of opinion as to whether or not this forward agricultural movement meets with the sympathy of those officials in eastern Oklahoma having to do with Indian matters and as to the significance of the movement to the Indian citizen, and what our department is doing along these lines. I want now to distinguish clearly between the professional or business Indian and the real full-blood. In my judgment there are two big problems in eastern Oklahoma to be wrestled with: One, agricultural development; the other, the Indian situation; and they are closely related. We cannot get away from the fact that there are many thousands of our citizens of different degrees of Indian blood, and a new genera- tion rapidly growing up, who, if they are to support themselves at all, can only do so by following agricultural pursuits, and realizing this, something over two years ago I prevailed upon the Interior Department to give us some local assistance in the way of agricul- tural experts whose particular duty it would be to assist in improv- ing agricultural conditions among the Indian citizenship, and thisforce has been increased until, at the present time, we have twelve of these men located at different stations in eastern Oklahoma, who are cooperating with local organizations and with the representatives of the Federal and State Departments of Agriculture. Our agricultural representatives have been scattered at different points in eastern Oklahoma, where it was thought they could best reach the Indian population. Their stations are: Ardmore, Ada, Idabel, Hugo, Talihina, Holdenville, Okemah, Sapulpa, Spavinaw, Kansas, and Stilwell, with one general travelling agent having super- vision of the entire field of work. These men are all here by my direction and many representing their respective localities. Important to Indian Citizenship. HE betterment of agricultural conditions has an important sig- nificance to our Indian citizenship. The time is not far distant when many of these Indians must gain their livelihood from the soil. Those who have been depending upon periodical per capita or other payments, or lease money, will find it a difficult matter to subsist when these payments cease, unless their land holdings are made productive, and they are taught improved methods of farm- Ing. It is not our hope that the uneducated fullblood can, in a few seasons, grasp scientific methods expounded by government and state agricultural agents, but if they can be made to understand and use even a few of the advanced ideas, and while this is being done, their white or more progressive neighbors will improve the sur- rounding farms through the efforts of organizations like this, and you earnest business men and citizens who have fixed in your minds the upbuilding and development of the agricultural resources of the State, it is very evident that the Indian will also advance and take advantage of the ocular demonstration of the benefits acquired by good farming, and the use of good seed, as compared with the old way. I he most populous Indian tribe in eastern Oklahoma, the Chero- kees, have practically reached the condition where those that are dependent upon agricultural pursuits must look that situation straight in the face. Their tribal holdings have all been disposed of, their allotments have been equalized, and the money remaining "i T reasury has practically all been distributed to them.Assures Aid of Field Force. HAVE many thousands of Indians who must he farmers. They are here and the citizens of the state must recognize that one of the most important phases of the agricultural situation is its relation to the Indian, and I want to assure this body that the offi- cials of the Interior Department sincerely appreciate the importance of this organized effort, and not only have I done, but will continue to do, everything possible to promote such an important public activity in which I am not only interested because I am one of you, but officially, because of the large, land-owning Indian population. With our field force we will assist in your local and county organ- izations, and I feel convinced that a well-directed effort along these lines will develop large areas now nonproducing, thus increasing the general prosperity of the country, including land rental values. If the improvement in agricultural conditions is generally good for Eastern Oklahoma, it is also good for the Indian citizenship, and any improvement that can be brought about which relates to the In- dian naturally redounds to the advancement of the community of which they are such a large factor. We must admit that too much speculation in realty holdings does not make for the general and permanent upbuilding of the community. This is just as true as ap- plied to land as to city property. Land held solely for speculation, and which does not produce, adds nothing to the general resources of the country, except so long as there is outside demand or new money comes in. As soon as this new money stops, and the demand ceases, we have stagnation, which nothing will counteract save the steady and continued improvement of these farms, and the market- ing of products, either grain or stock, that will make us creditors to the outside world instead of debtors. Lease System a Handicap. [ BELIEVE that there is nothing that has so handicapped the agricultural development of eastern Oklahoma, particularly in so far as the Indian lands are concerned, as the vicious lease system in effect. It is speculative, pure and simple. I am a firm believer that as a general rule the individual Indian, particularly the restricted class, is land poor. With some few ex- ceptions he has more acreage than he ever can or will cultivate, butThb&dMan I 19 ,J)!illll„,llit!l,.(l]llll..4llljL.lll[Illi -,l1)-. . (ljfll,	illiillli. VjihV V .iILmikI* -idll* ^crA.xrj!^H It* September i|! many times prefers to meagerly exist 011 the small sums he receives from the speculative leasetaker, who secures the lease not with the idea of improving the farm and making it produce, hut of trans- ferring it or surrendering to some one who may eventually buy the land with a bona fide intention of farming it. Should Sell Excess Lands. T BELIEVE that the Indian should sell his excess lands instead of being permitted to lease, that the money derived therefrom be used in putting a small area that the Indian can look after in a high state of cultivation and improvement, and then adequately protect him in his possession thereof. The good results would be manifold. Thousands of acres now held under speculative leases would not only be made taxable, but go into the hands of farmers from other States whose eyes are constantly turned this way, who are almost always confronted, when they seek to buy a piece of Indian land, with either the purchase of a speculative lease or the possibility of being kept out of possession for a term of years until such lease expires. If a small, well-improved tract is retained for the Indian and the remainder sold and also im- proved, there cannot help but be a material increase in the produc- ing areas of this section and everything reasonable will have to be done to put the Indian citizen in a position to support himself if he has the inclination. Working Along These Lines. OU R Department has been working along these lines, but finds it difficult to get the results that we should, because of need of legislation to assist, but we have accomplished a great deal. For instance, where full-blood Indians have royalty or other moneys handled under the supervision of the Department, our principal effort is to see that the money is placed into permanent land im- provements, where it will not only benefit the individual Indian, but the community as a whole, including the surrounding Indian land. In this way we improve, to a more or less extent, in the neighborhood of a hundred farms each month throughout the east- ern half of the State. Dependent upon the means available, some of these are placed in splendid condition. I have in mind a recent case where there20 tTheBedMani ms !► September ill was expended over $7,000 in improvements, fencing, cultivation, etc., on one farm. The Indian had theretofore been lying around town, spending his oil royalties as rapidly as he received them, with only the dissipated class of the town receiving any benefit therefrom. As soon as his money had accumulated sufficiently, he was induced to move to his farm, which had previously been in a dissipated condi- tion, with the buildings unfit for habitation. He now has an elegant home, with horses, cattle, and hogs, and this year took an active and intelligent interest in raising a crop and making his own livelihood, and besides his money was spent in legitimate channels of trade for labor, lumber, machinery and other materials. We have several other cases where sums of from $1,000 to $3,500 have been used for like purposes. Government Wants to Join Hands. AGAIN I say that the Government wants to join hands with the movements of this character; that it would like to expend every dollar of the Indians’ resources in making productive farms intead of scratching places, and that I would rather see an Indian have thirty or forty acres well cultivated and well improved than 500 lying idle with the title plastered and covered with speculative leases, which not only retard development but frighten nearly every bona fide farmer who wants to make a home in eastern Oklahoma. H \ MAN’S success in life is usualy in proportion to his confi- dence in himself, and the energy and persistence with which he pursues his aim.”The Indians and Game Preservation: Ry Dr. Frank G. Speck. N THESE days when far-sighted people of the coun- try are beginning to take notice of the disappear- ance of our wild animal life and the wanton en- croachment of man upon nature, the Indians have in different ways come in for their share of blame and praise. Some writers have accused the Indians of thoughtless slaughter of the game, a few have excused them for the same on the grounds of necessity, while practically none have seen the matter in its true light, evidently because they are not ac- quainted with the customs of the people they are discussing. This !s, indeed, only one among a number of fallacies current among historical writers which do injustice to the Indians by putting them on a lower cultural scale than they deserve. Investigation in every line of native Indian life is constantly revealing new traits of com- plexity and advancement which, when they become known, will earn a higher grade of appreciation for the Indians in general. Let us consult, for example, the native regulations governing the treatment of the hunting territories among the northern Ojilnvays and the Montagnais of the Province of Quebec. The Indians are commonly accused of being improvident as regards the killing of game becausethey depend upon it for their living. This, I maintain, is grossly incorrect, the Indians being, on the contrary, the best pro- tectors of the game. The Montagnais inhabiting the southern watershed of the Labrador peninsular depend entirely upon the hunt for their meat and subsistence, trading the furs that they obtain dur- ing the winter for the necessities of life at the Hudson Bay Compa-o 22 \XSiWjEMt. I TheKedMan IiihIIu ..llll4u. .l!(]ll...l!il|||_.tiitti...ll|l|t..^l(llL.,ltlflt.	■••ill!..! ny’s posts. Accompanied by his family, the Montagnais operates through a certain territory, known as his “hunting ground,” the boundaries determined by a certain river, the drainage of some lake or the alignment of some ridge. This is his family inheri- tance, handed down from his ancestors. Here in the same district his father hunted before him and here also his children will gain their living. Despite the continued killing in the tract each year the supply is always replenished by the animals allowed to breed there. There is nothing astonishing in this to the mind of the Indian because the killing is definitely regulated so that the increase only is consumed, enough stock being left each season to insure a supply the succeeding year. In this manner the game is “farmed” so to speak, and the continued killing through centuries does not affect the stock fundamentally. It can readily be seen that the thoughtless slaughter of game in one season would spoil things for the next and soon bring the proprietor to famine. The Montagnais depend largely upon the beaver, as there are very few moose and caribou in their country. The beaver to them is like the bison to the plains Indians, or the reindeer to the Arctic tribes. The meat of the beaver is delicious and substantial and re- places pork very advantageously. If the hunter falls sick in the forest far from aid, he finds the castoreum a beneficial remedy. Different from the other beasts the beaver does not wander about and require to be hunted; he builds his “cabin” in plain sight upon the very path of the hunter, in the river or lake. Instinctively, the hunter understands how Providence, by a wise law, which no man or goverment or game commission can improve on, has placed the beaver there for his subsistence. He understands, moreover, that he cannot abuse this providence. Thus it is that the Indian, obeying a natural law of conservation, which is worth more than any written law to him, “never destroys all the members of a beaver family.” Pie knows enough to spare a sufficient number for the continuation of the family and the propagation of the colony. He takes care of the beaver and other animals as well that live in his family territory, the same as a farmer does of his breeders. He can, indeed, tell at any time the number of animals which he can dispose of each year in his district without damaging his supply. Does this not seem remarkable to white people who, instead of regarding the game supply as a heritage, treat it as a source of sportSeptember 'ssrjssu yr	^ vtT'f yry'Ti ■Tjc^jk^cwi t TheBedMam «P 23 ml!li* ,,iilli'ij.4ilIlfh..iiIliij,.iihlii...«illli..jilIj6.iiiIlli..-jiILu^il!l/i,^iIlit^illlii..^iHLi IlLiIii..Jlu .ill to earn credit among their friends for the number of creatures “bagged?” Another incentive, of course, is money. Here again the testimony of an Ojibway chief at Lake Temagami, Ontario, is exceedingly elucidating. Speech of Aleck Paul (Osheshewakwasinowinini), Second Chief of Temagami Band of Ojibways. TN THE early times the Indians owned this land where they lived, bounded by the lakes, rivers, and hills, or determined by a certain number of days’ journey in this direction or that. I hose tracts formed the hunting grounds owned and used by the different families. Wherever they went the Indians took care of the game animals, especially the beaver, just as the Government takes care of the land to-day. So these families of hunters would never think of damaging the abundance or the source of supply of the game, because that had come to them from their fathers and grand- fathers and those behind them. It is, on the other hand, the white man who needs to be watched. He makes the forest fires, he goes through the woods and kills everything he can find, whether he needs its flesh or not, and then when all the animals in one section are killed he takes the train and goes to another where he can do the same. We Indian families used to hunt in a certain section for beaver. We would only kill the small beaver and leave the old ones to keep breeding. Then when they got too old, they too would be killed, just as a farmer kills his pigs, preserving the stock for his supply °f young. The beaver was the Indians’pork, the moose his beef, the partridge his chicken; and there was the caribou or red deer—that Was his sheep. All these formed the stock on his family hunting ground, which would be parceled out among the sons when the owner died. He said to his sons, “You take this part; take care of this tract; see that it always produces enough.” That was what 111 y grandfather told us. His land was divided among two sons, my father and Pishabo (Tea Water), my uncle. We were to own this land so no other Indians could hunt on it. Other Indians could go there and travel through it, but could not go there to kill the beaver. Each family had its own district where it be- longed, and owned the game. That was each one’s stock for food and clothes. If another Indian hunted on our territory we, the24 t TheEedMan , Iiillu ..Ilifau_.lllll»..illllli-.lti!b...itllll. jllllt.illill:. -ilttl.-. lllli. ..ll[lli...illllli......rilLn yjcxr*.......... > September ‘Hli owners, could shoot him. This division of the land started in the beginning of time, and always remained unchanged. 1 remember about twenty years ago some Nipissing Indians came north to hunt on my father’s land. He told them not to hunt beaver. “This is our land,” he told them; “you can fish but must not touch the fur, as that is all we have to live on.” Sometimes an owner would give permission for strangers to hunt for a certain time or in a certain tract. This was often done for friends or when neighbors had had a poor season. Later the favor might be returned. When the white people came they commenced killing all the game. They left nothing on purpose to breed and keep up the sup- ply, because the white men don’t care about the animals. They are after the money. After the white man kills all the game in one place, he can take the train and go 300 miles or more to another and do the same there. But the Indian cannot do that. He must stay on his own section all the time and suppost his family on what it produces. So he has to preserve his game stock and live on what is bred on the increase. If the Indian did like the white man and should go to the old country, England, what would the white man do? He would send solders to shoot him and send him back where he came from. You can write this down for me: If an Indian went to the old country and sold hunting licenses to the old country people for them to hunt on their own land, the white people would not stand for that. The Government sells our big game, our moose, for $50 license and we don’t get any of it. The Government sells our fish and our islands and gets the money, but we don’t get any share. What we Indians want is for the Government to stop the white people killing our game, as they do it only for sport and not for support. We Indians do not need to be watched about protecting the game, we must protect the game or starve. We can take care of the game just as well as the Game Wardens and better, because we are going to live here all the time. We don’t like to be watched, when the Government doesn’t watch the people it should watch. When the treaty was made, about sixty years ago, the Government said: "You Indians own the game. There are a great many Indians in this country. People do not see them much at the towns because they stay in the bush. These Indians need to have their rights in the land and the game recognized and protected as much as the new settlers.”■ 11 September i|! t TheRedMan „............ To conclude a subject which could be discussed exhaustively to the credit of the natives and the discredit of the white hunters, let me quote the remarks of M. Tessier, the well-known agent and fiiend of the Montagnais of Lake St. John: “Far from being the destroyer of the beaver, the Indian is the true and natural pro- tector, and I defy whoever it may be to prove the contrary. One cannot say the same of the civilized hunter. The whites do not behave in the same manner, unfortunately. They don’t hunt for food nor clothing, but for gain or for mere sport. What good to them is the preservation of the beaver or any other animal in a dis- trict? I hey need never return there again for their purposes. In- deed, they kill every animal which they find at the end of their gun without sparing anything. There, indeed, are the destroyers of the beaver and the game! The Indian does not kill for profit, but for subsistence only.” It was the same with the tribes of the plains and the bison. When they were masters of the prairies the maintenance the bison herds was assured for their own subsistence. Only when the white man penetrated the West was the doom of the bison sealed.SA-CA-GA-WE-A (The Indian girl who guided Lewis and Clark in their expedition to the Pacific.)

N IMMIT boy and an old Indian woman who had found and brought him up lived near the bleak, icy shore of the Arctic Ocean with a band of Indians called Loucheux, or “Quarrelers.” The boy was as thin as a lath and clothed in tattered skins all but ready to drop off him, for he and his foster mother were miserably poor. The Loucheux quarreled with her for adding to her poverty by picking up such a useless, shattery, little creature. Still, they were always growling at themselves or one another. Perhaps the barren land they lived in had much to do with their querulous tem- per. It was flat and marshy; the plains in summer were covered with a kind of moss called tundra, which they used as food. These plains were only the melted surface of snow and ice, too deep and hard for the short summer heats to penetrate. In winter they were frozen over and buried beneath fathoms of snow. Bears, seals, walruses, and whales were hunted before the hardest cold set in and stored around the sides of the snow huts in which they lived. To keep out the cold, these snow huts were often built partly under ground, only the entrance to them showing from the outside. Once there was the longest and worst winter ever known, and the stock of meat gave out. The famished boy often asked for food which was grudgingly given, the while he was nagged at and ridiculed for his presumption in making a huge pair of snow shoes. “What could a starveling like him do with snow shoes?” In this time of want, when game was scarce, things would have gone badly for the hunters, had they not, when about to return empty handed, always come across a broad trail that led to a spot where lay some freshly-killed bears or other large animals. They never hesitated to consider whether they were entitled to them, but carried off in haste the hidden booty. This good luck happened so often that they resolved to lie in wait and surprise the good gen-^CTA.Xrv1T| | September i| jctawcKO yrw ^	^ v qp~"vj ■The Bed Man iJllu .........................lilN...illlli.jll3|...llSli,-iiS!....lftl,..jl!l!,..Jilllt1.....,Hll„! i* 29 ius who had them in his care. Close watch revealed that the boy and his snow shoes were concerned in the matter, as they had some- how supposed. When they found the track of the snow shoes led to the door of his hut, all doubts were ended. But instead of show- ing gratitude to their benefactor, they treated as unkindly as ever the despised little weakling who had of late so often saved them from starvation. One night when the Quarrelers were feasting from the full pots hanging over the fire, the boy came in and begged for a small piece of blubber of which the Eskimos are excessively fond. He was re- fused and driven from the hut. He vanished in the darkness and was never seen again. All that remained of him was his ragged little garments found in the morning hanging on the branch of a stunted tree. In the course of a moon’s time, provisions had again given out; no easy trails were found leading to expected bounty as before, and the grumpy Quarrelers suffered. It was then that a round, sturdy man, with a good-humored smile, and attired in the finest of Arctic clothing entered the Loucheux country. He announced himself the Man in the Moon, whom they had always petitioned before starting °n the hunt. He also declared that he was the unhappy lad who had smarted under their cruelty and fled to his home to escape it. In conclusion he said that on his return to the moon, which he would never again leave, he would always watch over them for the sake of the old woman who had cherished him, but in punishment for ingrati- tude the animals should forevermore be lean in winter and fat in summer. And this has been the case ever since.The Creation of the Earth. Cora Elm, Oneida. HERE are some of the old Indians who believe that for a long time the human race lived in the clouds while this earth was all covered with water and only animals existed here. One old woman who lived in the clouds had a beautiful, charming daugh- ter, who was held in seclusion. This daughter was sent down to the earth because she had committed a sin. When the animals saw her floating from the clouds they held a council and considered the best way to protect themselves from this extraordi- nary being. They decided that they would be able to protect themselves bet- ter on land than on water. The one who could hold the heaviest weight on his back was to be chosen to form the basis of land. Different ones were given a trial to prove their strength, but the turtle proved to be the strongest. All the animals helped to construct the land on the turtle’s back by bringing earth, rocks, and other material from the bottom of the sea. In a few days they had constructed a small island, and by this time the woman arrived. They found her so delightful that they decided to enlarge the island, so that more of her race might in- habit it. Some of her race were very curious to know what became of her, so they came down to earth and found it better living on land than in the clouds.STORIES OF FAMOUS INDIAN CAPTIVES The Gorge in Letch worth ParkADVISES SELLING EXCESS INDIAN LANDS Creek Indians—Old Way, Poor Equipment New V^ay, with Good Teams and Modern Machinery Purchased Ufx>n Advice of Government Agents(Etritortal Comment Nearing the Last Lap in Indian Affairs. HE Indian Service personnel and the Indians of the country must be impressed with the effective manner in which the Indian Bureau has begun its activities under the Wilson administration, with Hon. Franklin K. Lane as Secretary of the Interior and Hon. Cato Sells as Commissioner of Indian Affairs. This efficiency is charac- terized by a calmness of administration, coupled with an infused confidence on the part of Indians and the public that the Indian usiness is now in eminently safe hands. At best, work of direct- ing Indian affairs is fraught with conflicting opinions and at times y the opposition of interested or selfish forces. It is well, there- °ie, that a judicious atmosphere, with a keynote of efficiency and justice, pervades Indian affairs. At the same time the policy announced of protecting the illiter- ate, ignorant, and incompetent Indians by necessary restrictions, and affording them thorough education and training in industry and ristian civilization, while liberalizing the Government’s dealings with competent and educated Indians, strikes a responsive chord everywhere. While this means that the Indian will receive pro- tection and the right education, it is significant of a definite move- ment toward hastening the time when the Indians shall enter the tanks of citizenship, unhampered in the enjoyment of their prop- e^ty, yet with a realization of the obligations imposed by the right °f franchise. A Carlisle Indian Shows Talent in Architecture. |HE cut showing an architectural drawing by John Farr, on another page of The Red Man, is of interest and significance. This young man, who graduated at Car- lisle a couple of years ago, has been a student in the architectural department of the University of Pennsyl- vania for a little more than a year, being now in his second year in a two-year term for a special certificate of proficiency. 11	wr>ting of his work, the dean of this school says: ^ our protege, John F'arr, has proved, as we expected, a hard-working stu- ent, but he has done better than this, having an excellent record for the year srayAW ► 36 • ■fi-Y^fy "'y y'y'g|i|W|y , TheEedMan , iu«!l ..iiihij..<iitiii>.ijlli[i_(t)ihi.jiillii..jiil)L.iiiljii<.it)iJIit<-i,iili(ti..iii[liii..iiil!ii>...«iii<"i ► September ll tSnvca:irJHS3r<ilI work. The final report will show the degree to which this is true and will, I think, probably go in excess of this moderate praise. Some time since I was pleased to receive a copy of THE RED MAN, largely written and illustrated by present and former students of the Carlisle School. Some of Farr’s drawings are of such excellence that I believe they would make very interesting matter for publication in THE RED MAN. We know of no trained Indian architects. There are many In- dian lawyers, ministers and doctors, and many in the other profes- sions, and the indications point to young Farr as a future acquisition to the architectural profession. He has been working hard, spend- ing his vacations earning money to pay many of his expenses at the university and, having distinct natural ability as well as persever- ance, he should finish his course creditably with a good outlook for a career of real service. While only a few Indians enter the pro- fessional ranks, a large majority of them being content—and rightly so—to make a success in business, in the trades, in farming and in housekeeping, it is a clear indication of progress among our In- dians to see many of the red men making good in the so-called higher walks of life. r I ''HERE is no prayer worth the name that is unaccompanied by effort to make the prayer come true.	—Herbert L.

The following editorial shows the great Interest in tbis country in practical education, based on common- sense methods. Superintendent Friedman is slightly misquoted, as he stated that the number ol graduates from the Carlisle School who have made good com- pared in number and accomplishment most favorably with the graduates of our universities and colleges. The editorial in Tht Ttltiraph is an able and thoughtful one, containing suggestions wbich are re- flected io the recent discussions led by prominent col* lege authorities—Edinr. THE average Indian, upon gradua- tion from the Carlisle School, is more efficient than the average univer- sity graduate, Superintendent Friedman, of the Carlisle institution, told the Engi- neers’ Society last evening. We are quite ready to believe him. When the Carlisle Indian sets his face toward home and the Golden West with his sheepskin in his hand, or decides to try his fortunes in the East, he is not puffed up with the thought that now he is master of all the thought of the ages, that he begins where father is leaving off or far beyond, and that the world owes him a bank president’s salary immediately upon leaving col- lege. The Indian has been trained in a hard school. He knows how to work with his hands as well as with his brain, and it has been impressed upon him38 S&sarjsszi ■ TheRedMan "! September it Sii.v'c^rjcyjii! that he goes out into the world to face a handicap which only the hardest kind of toil on his part will enable him to overcome. Carlisle turns out a product well able to care for itself in any circum- stances and which books of the school will show, notwithstanding the fact that on the pages of the yellow press of the country every Indian who goes wrong is heralded as a "graduate of Carlisle.” The truth is that Carlisle has a far better record in this respect than has many a college of wider scope and influence. Carlisle prepares her pupils for im- mediate contact with a “give and take” world. Too many of the white man’s colleges are apparently founded on the proposition that their students are to live the lives of the idle rich, with in- comes sufficient to meet all wants out of college as they have been met by fond parents within. This is, perhaps, the biggest fault of the college to-day. Mr. Friedman might do the country a service by preaching Carlisle methods throughout the educational institu- tions of the land.—Harrisburg Tele- graph. THE INDIANS FRIEND WHEN Mr. Lane, the new Sec- retary of the Interior, told the Indians who called to pay their re- spects that he knew the plains and the mountains and the big-game country, he gave us an interesting glimpse of his background. That he knows rail- roads may be guessed from his expe- rience on the Interstate Commerce Commission, and that he is not un- familiar with many phases of the In- dian question may also be inferred from his antecedents. At any rate he assured his callers that he and “the great man in the White House” would see that they do not suffer injustice. Now that the days of the tomahawk and the war dance have gone by and the Indian is no longer a menace any- where, he is beginning, even on the old Western frontier, to awaken in the white man something of the sentimen- tal interest which has long been felt for him in New England.—Editorial, Boston Globe. THE ADVANCE OF LO LO the poor Indian, with his un- tutored mind, is pushing the marauding pale faces away from the pie counter and taking unto himself the choicest pastry thereon. Presi- dent Wilson has appointed Gabe F. Parker, a full-blooded Choctaw In- dian of Oklahoma, to be Registrar of the Treasury. The signature of the Registrar of the Treasury must appear on all currency put into circulation during his term of office. He is the wampum chief of a hundred millions of people, and the wampum he signs will be good wam- pum, as were the guahang shells and Copper nuggets and inscribed birch bark of his ancestors.

INDIAN DAY JNDIAN Day is suggestive of an American holiday that should appeal to every lover of American history. Already we have holidays enough, if, indeed, not too many. But to the red man we have not yet done justice. This broad land was once his own. No people loved native land more than he loved the forests and hills and streams of the American continent, t was inevitable, before the irresisti- ble coming of the white man, the In- dian should give way; but in the pro- cess he has not always had fair treat- ment. Glaring defects of character he may have had, but these were more than offset by noble qualities. These have never been brought out as they might be, and it has been a continual fight to secure for the red man even the measure of justice he has enjoyed. 1 he annual Indian conference at Lake Mohonk, New York, fosters this spirit of justice toward the more than a quarter of million Indian Americans still left; but a national Indian holiday would afford opportunity for a nation- wide consideration of his rights and needs, and, by calling attention to In- dian customs and habits, would stimu- late interest as nothing else might in out-of-door life. In some States Oc- tober 12th is observed as Columbus Day, but the new holiday has had a halting reception and gives no promise of ever becoming a popular national celebration. But let October 12th be- come known as American Indian Day' and the boom of interest in its obser- vance would be instantaneous and lasting.—Leslie’s Weekly. CARLISLE SCHOOL IS PRAISED RAND, McNally & Co. have just issued an excellent and compre- hensive geography of Pennsylvania, prepared by Dr. Charles H. Albert. It contains several references to the Carlisle Indian School, and on page 23 the following complimentary com- ment is made: “At Carlisle, Pa., is located the largest, best equipped, and most effi- cient school for the education of the Indian in the United States.L.' <£raiiuates anti Eeturneb ^tutients 'T'HE United States Congress is made up of hard-headed and far-sighted business men. Generalizations relative to Indian education are not accepted as facts, and the Congress insists on individual records to prove the value of Indian Schools. The Carlisle School has long felt the justice of this demand and has met it. The Superintendent considers this matter one of the most important duties with which he is charged, and each year writes thousands of letters of good cheer and encouragement to the former students. Large numbers are found employment, and larger numbers are returning to visit their Alma Mater each year. What splendid achievements in civilization, and remarkable progress toward the best in citizenship, is breathed in the spirit and story of these letters! Samuel J. McLean, a Sioux Indian and a Carlisle graduate of the class of 1909, writes toTHt Red Man as follows: “I have re- signed from the Service as a blacksmith and have accepted a good position as art and pen- manship teacher at St. Mary’s Mission, nearOmalc, Wash. I willreportfor my new work on September 12th.” *- 'VJ r In a letter to the school from Indian Wells, Arizona, Lewis E. Thompson says: “I am proud of Carlisle, the school that has helped me to a happier life. I am trying to help my tribe by teaching all that I know of the Lord’s Book. I have done nothing to make Carlisle ashamed of me. I was married recently and the world looks very happy to me.” .■a\ V- '/// r CARLISLE INDIAN A LEADER IN ATHLETICS. Mike Balenti, the Indian shortstop of the St. Louis Browns, and a former student of Carlisle, has branched out as a football coach. He has bean appointed assistant coach of the St. Louis University eleven, and will assume his duties at the close of the Americam League season. Balenti, Class ’09, was formerly a member of the Carlisle Indian eleven. >^\ w yss r IS A REPRESENTATIVE CITIZEN. A very interesting letter has been received from L. N. Gansworth, who is a graduate of the Carlisle Indian School, in which he gives interesting information about his family, his progress in business, and his standing as a citizen. In addition to this letter, we have seen a souvenir program of the Mt. Ida Presbyterian Church, of Daven- port, Iowa, giving the program for dedica- tion day of a handsome new church. It will be of interest to this young man’s friends and to every Carlisle girl and boy, to know that he is a member of the board of trustees of this church, was treasurer of the building committee, and is superintend- ent of the Sunday school, and this all in competition with the “pale face.” Part of this interesting letter is as follows: As I have not written to you for several “moons,” I shall begin with the birth of a little daughter in our home, which occurred last March.

Their choice fell upon Edward L. Rodgers, a member of the White Earth band of Chip- pewas. Rodgers is a product of the Carlisle Indian School and was a graduate from the law school of the University of Minnesota in 1904. During his career at Carlisle and Minnesota he won fame throughout the country as a marvel on the football gridiron, and captained the Minnesota eleven in 1905. Rodgers chose for a wife a Minnesota co-ed, and she is aiding him in his work of seek- ing independence for his progressive people. Some of the purposes for which the bands of his tribe have combined are: To adjudi- cate all the claims of the Chippewas against the United States; to promote agriculture and industry among Indians; to work to- ward the abolition of Federal control of the Indians, and to have them placed under state supervision; to get pay for accrued in- terest on tribal funds; to place the reds on the same footing as whites, making them self-supporting and independent.—The Rich- mond (In,/.)

He is no longer con- nected with the Sil’ver Creek News, but has accepted a position as manager of a new job office, the Park Place Printery, whereby he has bettered himself in every way and is doing well. **	_w FITTED FOR EFFICIENT SERVICE. Miss Helen Eloise Pickard, a Wichita, Indian who obtained her preparatory edu- cation at the Carlisle Indian School, was in this year’s graduating class of the West Chester State Normal School. She has com- pleted the course with credit to herself and her race. The training which she has re- ceived fits her for either public school work or for the rendering of valuable service to her people in the Government Indian Schools. ’■’V r Caleb Carter, honor pupil of Class Ml, writes as follows to one of his former teachers: “I am certainly thankful for all42 Xta^usv innr	r*fr’l<iir'V,w ,,ii!li|iil!iip,H""iii^iEX^ii?,ill THEKEiDMAM 'llP September •>ti| lj,. _,[lku jillli. .illili. ih'lj -illlli. .JI]l	Jj0u...llhfc- you taught me.

Joel Wheelock, an Oneida Indian, from Depere, Wis., who graduated at the Carlisle Indian School with the class of 1912, and spent last year at Carlisle in the business department, will enter Lebanon Valley College, at Annville, Pa., this fall as a student. Wheelock was a member of last year’s football team. President Gossard of the college conferred with Superintendent Friedman on Monday, August 18, at which time arrangements were completed. Joel’s friends at Carlisle wish him a happy and successful college career. sjiw v.v r CARLISLE BOV CONTINUING HIS STUDIES. In a letter received from Charles F. Mc- Donald, who obtained his preliminary edu- cation at Carlisle, we hear that he is con- tinuing with his education, and that he is getting along nicely. He says: “Since leaving Carlisle in May 28, 1912, I have been engaged in fitting myself for my life work, and the education I received during the six years that I attended your school is the foundation upon which I am continuing. I am proud to be able to con- sider myself a graduate of Carlisle, and I most sincerely hope that I shall be able to uphold the standards and principles that were given to me by my Alma Mater.” FORMER STUDENT OF CARLISLE TEACHING HER PEOPLE. Many of the returned students of Carlisle are engaged in teaching in and out of the Service. One of the bright young ladies who was educated here and who was a good musician, Caroline Hewitt, is now employed under the State of New York, teaching one of the district schools on the Tonawanda Reservation in New York. In a letter just received she says: “I am teaching in a district Reservation school on the Tonawanda Reservation. It is one of the day schools which is under the supervision of the New York State. “I wish you and the Carlisle school the very best of success in your work for the year.” gs. w w r HOLDS RESPONSIBLE POSITION IN PORTO RICO.
