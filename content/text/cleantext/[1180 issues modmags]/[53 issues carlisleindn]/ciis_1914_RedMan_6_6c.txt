STRONG man is the finished product of the right kind of an education. Be he red, white, or black, if his education is of the right kind, the re- sult should be a real man—physically strong, skill- ful, industrious, reproductive; mentally keen and intelligent; morally, always positively clean and right; spiritually sensitive and ever developing and unfolding, a God-fearing man, a Christ-like man, P°werful yet merciful, strong yet gentle, unselfish, helpful, sympa- thet>c, true. The education that will develop a man answering this de- ^r*ption is the kind that is in demand for the Caucasian, for the . egfo, for the Indian. The artist must have in mind very defi- nite*y the completed picture before even the background is put uP°n the canvas, otherwise the finished product will not stand out £ early and tell its story. Just so with the teacher. He who would y his teaching develop the strong man who will stand the tests of 1 e and succeed must have a true conception of the qualities of real Manhood, and those qualities must ever be kept in mind. Having pointed out a few of the fundamental qualities of true Manhood it will be recognized at once that the first absolutely es- Se,1tial specification of plans for education for the Indian is that the Personnel of the Service be kept at a high standard. If I were asked to say, after serious thought, what in my judgment would ^ake the greatest improvement in the Indian schools of the country Would not say more buildings, better equipment, or more money. p Address delivered at the District Conference of the Society of American Indians at hlladelphia, Pa., February 14, 1914.I 212 ) [i'1 i“ri_ _ __ tv_ . -v> . .

There are approxi- mately 5,700 persons employed in the Indian Service. Many of them are well qualified, self-sacrificing workers, but there are al- ways a shortage of employees and therefore applicants of mediocre ability and limited preparation are necessarily given positions. Of the total number employed in the Service in 1912, 2,516 were Indians, almost one-half of all agency and school employees. This Society could not render any greater service than to encourage Indian young people to thoroughly qualify for service among their own people by taking normal training courses, domestic science courses, agricultural and trade courses of sufficient length and thoroughness to insure efficiency. The Service is in constant need of well-qualified workers, and Indians who can meet the require- ments in way of qualifications are always given preference. But before discussing this phase of Indian education further we will as briefly as possible make a survey of school conditions in general in order to have clearly in our minds a picture of the whole field. There are in the United States approximately 75,000 Indian children of school age, 5 to 18 years. Of that number about 7,500, or one out of every ten, are ineligible for enrollment because of some physical or mental defect. These are special classes which demand early and thoughtful attention. Information is now being gathered concerning the number and condition of each class in order that intelligent action in their behalf may be taken. These unfortunate children and young people should command the earnest and sympathetic attention of all people who are interested in the Indian people, but especially of the members of the Society of American Indians whose purpose it is to be definitely and actively helpful to all members of their own race. Leaving the defective children to be specially cared for, there are about 67,500 children of school age who should be in school- The total capacity of Government schools is now 25,324. Room for about 500 more is now being provided. In addition to the Government schools, there are contract, mission, and public schools which take care of approximately 31,137, making the total capacity, aside from public schools within reach of Indians but not utilized, 56,461. The enrollment in Government schools during the year 1913 was 27,584, in mission schools 5,109, in public schools 26,-Hb 5; „' >|| THEi EedMAN F 213 1 '**^jcsna&.....■kAAJt.A^A.^t,^ a. ,<A Ivoj^jE^d 028—a total of 58,721. Thus it will be seen that about 78.3 per C®*t the children are in school, and 87 per cent of the eligible c ndren attend school. The percentage of all children throughout j ® United States who are in school is approximately 80, which is above the percentage of all Indian children, and 7 less than the Percentage of Indian children who are eligible to attend schools for n°rrnal children. When the Navajoes, Papagoes, and Apaches are Provided with schools, the problem, so far as capacity is concerned, 1 have been largely solved. Congress appropriated $100,000 st year for the Navajo schools, and the 1915 bill carries an equal An item of $50,000 for Papago schools was placed in the 1 this year, and although omitted by the House committee, it is °Ped that it will be restored before the bill finally becomes a law. us it may be seen that adequate facilities will comparatively soon e bailable for practically all Indian children. These schools are graded and offer an academic course equal the usual eight grades of the public schools of the entire country, few of the larger nonreservation schools offer two years of special ac3demic work in addition to the grammar school course. Agri- ture, domestic science, and business training are emphasized in ese institutions. The State and local academic courses of study are adopted and adapted for use in Indian schools. From the be- S'nning of Indian education by the Federal Government, it has een recognized that mere academic education would not meet the eeds of Indian children. Industrial training is especially neces- Sary for Indian young people because they have such limited op- portunities for getting such training in their homes. Because of this act> special effort has always been put forth to provide facilities for aried industrial training for both boys and girls. Boys are taught arming, gardening, dairying, carpentering, blacksmithing, shoe atld harness making, plumbing, steam engineering, stone and Cement masonry, painting, baking, and printing. Girls are taught c°oking, sewing, laundering, general house keeping, and in fact 6Verything pertaining to home-making and home-keeping. There probably are no schools, in existence of similar grade ere as much and as varied industrial training is given. "Voca- . tonal training is rapidly coming to be generally recognized as an /^Portant part of every young person’s education and training, ^doubtedly the existence in various parts of the country of indus-!► 214 nnimr	ly’qf W y'nir'qfuy tTHEEEDMAN; ............ »• February ® iwv^Du-'rjcrJii trial training schools for Indian children has had much influence in creating a sentiment in favor of manual, industrial, and vocational schools. Unquestionably industrial schools for Indians have been and are now the best type for the masses of the race. The schools, although imperfect in some respects, have done and are now doing remarkably efficient work for Indian youths. The schools through the children have completely changed the whole sentiment of Indians toward education in the twenty-seven years during which I have labored in them. (One week from to- day will be the end of my 27th year in the Service.) In 1887 there were but 10,b00 Indian children in Government schools, and they had to be begged and almost dragged in. Last year there were a total of 58,721 Indian pupils voluntarily enrolled in schools of all classes, and thousands more would have been in attendance if facili- ties had been available. Nearly all Indian schools must, because of lack of room, turn away applicants. This one result has justified the maintenance of the schools because, having created a desire for education, the most difficult part of the problem has been solved. In fact, there is no longer an educational problem in so far as the Indian children are concerned. The desire for an education has been created and therefore the question is simply one of providing ways and means and of keeping industriously and continuously at the work. This being true, what of the future? We are maintaining a great system of special school for the In- dians, who are the native citizens of this country. That it has been necessary and right to maintain such schools cannot, it is believed, be successfully disputed. However, the time is rapidly approach- ing, if it has not already come, when the necessity and the advisabil- ity of the Federal Government maintaining schools for a large ele- ment of the Indian children who are now attending Indian schools may be seriously questioned. Twenty-seven years ago, on February 8, 1887, the Dawes land and severalty bill became a law. That law provided for the allot- ment of Indian lands, the title of each allotment to be held in trust by the Government for a period of twenty-five years. The accept- ance of an allotment gave citizenship to the allottee and with the expiration of the trust period and the issuing of a patent-in-fee sub- jected the patentee to taxation. Under the provisions of this law, and others enacted since, many Indians have become full-fledgedcitizens of the United States and the States in which they live. Reservations have been opened for settlement by the white people, °n many reservations all surplus lands have been occupied; town sites have been laid out; towns and cities have been built; and in both urban and rural districts public school facilities have been provided in what was formerly Indian country. ^ hus, in many sections of the country where comparatively only a few years ago there was no possible opportunity for the Indian child to get an edu- cation except in schools provided by the Government or in some stances by religious organizations, now splendid public-school facil- ities are available. In certain sections of the country where the surplus Indian lands were settled upon soon after the Indians were allotted the ex- pense of maintaining public schools has been a heavy burden upon the settlers because the Indian lands are not subject to taxation during the trust period. Because of this fact there has been a willingness upon the part of the Government to give aid to the Public schools by paying tuition for Indian children enrolled in Indian schools. In eastern Oklahoma, where there are so many Indian children and where the proportion of land held by Indians is so large, a specific appropriation has been made to aid the public schools since the courts ruled that Indian lands could not be taxed. In other sections of the country tuition has been paid by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs out of the appropriation for the support of Indian schools, where the parents of Indian children enrolled in public schools were non-taxpayers. We are now facing a new situation which must be met by legis- lation. The Comptroller recently rendered a decision to the effect that the Government cannot pay tuition for Indian children who, Under the State law, are legally entitled to the privileges of the public schools, and according to decisions received from many of the State where contracts have previously been made with public-school authorities to pay tuition, it is found that under State law Indian children are legally entitled to enrollment in the public schools. "Therefore, regardless of whether they are taxpayers or not, the Government cannot pay tuition to the public-school authorities except where Congress has made special appropiration therefor. Undoubtedly there are conditions in some sections of the countiy which justify such appropriations, as in eastern Oklahoma and in; 216 W THEeEDMAN | «~»J \.T3^jCTidluk. jkjk^kj^jkujk,Jk jk^k.jkj±*.j3i b*ycx?<rj~r** other sections of the country where there are large proportions of the land held by Indians which are not yet subject to taxation. Be* cause of this fact the Indian bill for the year 1915 has been so worded as to make it legal to use a certain amount of the Indian-school sup- port fund in paying tuition for Indian children who may be enrolled in public schools where conditions positively justify doing so. 1 h,s statement brings me to the point in this discussion which I should like to specially emphasize. As I have already intimated, it is believed that the time has come in the history of Indian education when there should be an agree- ment, if possible, between Federal and State authorities as to when the Federal Government will cease to provide educational facilities for the Indian child and when the State will assume the responsibility- There are hundreds of children of citizen Indians whose homes are within reach of the public schools, who are now attending In- dian schools. At the same time there are hundreds, yes, thousands of Indian children without school privileges of any kind. This con- dition of affairs naturally leads to the suggestion that the State should accept the responsibility of hereafter providing school facilities for those Indian children who belong to the citizen class. Personally) I would favor the plan of the Federal Government paying tuition for Indian children enrolled in public schools until such time as their parents’ property becomes subject to taxation by one process or another. And just here I should like to say that I believe those Indians who have had the advantages of education and appreciate its value will, in every way possible, help to hasten the day when productive inherited land will be made subject to taxation. This will aid not only in supporting public schools in Indian country, but will also help in all public improvements of the communities in which the lands are located. The advantage will certainly be reciprocal, as development of the community interests in general increases values- Our Indian population extends into 26 States of the Union, and in a few generations it will have been largely blended with the citizen- ship of these great Commonwealths. With these conditions in mind and with full and complete citizenship and all of its privileges and duties as its ultimate end. our present duty in educational matters for the Indian is not difficult to determine.jjf February i| • THEiEfiDMAN I-.......217........« itnllu ..iiUiii jiiIlii.jiiUiii„jhlii..iiil!li..jiiliL.iiil!ifi -iiilL„i,iiiiii. .jillih^iiliii...^'iiL.iillUiuii'- '11* jGXT.iiilii Means, methods, and principles of education have been among the chief concerns of legislative and deliberative assemblies of our Nation since the first town meeting of the early colonists to the Present day. As a result of the consensus of opinion evolved from these rigid, practical, and crucial test methods of growth, there has been developed the most valuable system of any age in public edu- cation. That Indians are entitled to the benefits of this accumula- tion of educational thought there can be no doubt. In my judgment the most important work to be done during the next few years by those who are charged with directing Indian edu- ction will be to use every conceivable means to bring about such conditions as to make possible the education of a rapidly increasing number of Indian children in the public schools throughout the country. The campaign must not be pushed too vigorously, but it should never cease for a moment. There are many obstacles to overcome. Indian homeconditions must be improved;disease must "e stamped out; cleanliness must become the rule; gradually the lndians must become willing to share the financial burden which accompany school privileges. The Government is active in helping to remove these and other conditions which may stand in the way of the Indian child having an equal chance with children of odier nationalities. Before I close I should say that I do not want to be understood as intimating that Indian schools are in any respect an inferior system of schools. Indeed, I believe it may be said without fear °f successful contradiction that in many respects they are very superior, but the supporting of special schools for any onenationality ,n this great Nation of cosmopolitan nationalities is xecusable °nly because of local and immediate conditions. Therefore, when- ever those conditions so change as to make it possible to eliminate the special school and place the Indians in the public school, the pelting pot of our mixed population, that it should be done cannot “e questioned. I should like to discuss many other phases of Indian education, ut time will not permit more than a mere mention of a few specially lrnportant matters in their relation to the effectiveness of Indian education. Although of equal native ability, Indian young people sfart in the race of life with many handicaps and for a good many years yet they must recognize this fact and therefore struggle withunusual activity and determination if they hope to keep abreast of others in the race. The majority of them live on the frontier in undeveloped country, in very primitive homes, among a non- English speaking people whose vision of life is limited in most instances to reservation lines. In short, the environment of these young people is lacking in all of those elements that tend to uplift and inspire to best effort. Children, who while in school acquire the reading habit, find nothing in the home to read, except now and then a newspaper; no magazine, no books, very often no Bible. Although a great admirer of Indians, Mr. Carnegie has not provided many libraries in Indian communities. Permit me to suggest that he or any philanthropist might do worse with his money than provide civic center buildings, including library, reading) and assembly rooms for returned students and their friends. A majority of Indian young people are further handicapped be- cause of limited education. They leaveschool thinking that a gram- mar school education is sufficient or isall thatis obtainable. Whileit is practically all thatis offered by the Federal Government, it should not be the end for all Indian young people. It is not sufficient for others who hope to keep in the race. Everywhere leaders in educational work are recognizing the necessity of continuation schools because so many young people leave school with inadequate preparation. Even young people who have superior educational opportunities, whose parents are educated, cultured people, whose homes are liberally supplied with the best of literature, who live in communities which offer the best of advantages, feel the need of con- tinuing their studies after they actually leave the educational insti- tutions. Indian young people must continue to be students after leaving school if they hope to keep up with their competitors. I want to suggest that this Society may be a great blessing and real help to returned students by urging upon them the necessity for extending their education in every possible way. Encourage the liberal distribution of good literature; plan where possible for continuation schools. The Government schools are available for such work if the returned students will make use of them. Make of these schools continuation schools and civic centers. I repeat that I believe Indian young people to be equal in native ability to their competitors, but they must make equal effort (Continued on Page 23Q.)TWO VIEWS OF THE CARUSLE INDIAN SCHOOL CAMPUS-ONE IN SUMMER, THE OTHER IN WINTERINDIAN TYPES—AN ACOMA MAIDEN By Carpenter, Field MuseumThe True American Herdsman: By Hasting Me Adam, in Everybody s. I EAT is not only dear but, relatively speaking, scarce. According to the latest Government figures there were 36,030,000 beef cattle in the United States January 1, 1913, whereas January 1, 1907, there were 51,566,000. A meat shortage is a fact and presents a problem which must be treated, like all other problems, at the root. In this case that means the source of supply. Several constructive plans of solution have been proposed; some are in their tentative beginning; one—and here's our little story—is in full and promising operation. The idea is simply this: That the American Indian, native of the Out-of-Doors, almost the sole remaining owner of huge tracts uPon which large flocks may be grazed, should again become, as he Was first, the great American Herdsman. And why not!	. , It is President Wilson’s opinion that the men who have studied and mastered scientific agriculture are the ones who will conserve the future of an America that is certain to double in population, "fhe President has called several such men to Government posi- tions. And prominent among them is the new Commissioner o Indian Affairs, Cato Sells—lawyer, banker, agriculturalist, and scientific stockman.	.. .. Mr. Sells has had a wide experience in his field. 1 e ivin^ Iowa he served many years as a trustee of the l°wa Agncu tura220 tokTZW! tbruary ''fl pr.csv"-*: Is February College; and since moving to Texas six years ago he has been put on nearly all the agricultural boards of the State. On the second day after the new Commissioner took, office, last April, he ordered a complete invoice made of every horse, mare and stallion, every steer, heifer, and bull, every sheep and goat, all the mules and burros on the Indian reservations. To prepare an invoice dealing with the principal property of 300,000	Indians living on 30,000,000 acres of widely scattered lands was indeed an enormous task. The results, compressed to totals, for all reservations, are contained in the following startling table: Animals on                        Number. Present Average of reservation.                              average farm stock value.* at present market prices, t Horses......................      689,847 $22.50  $130.00 Cattle............. .......       228,214 24.95   55.00 Sheep.......................... 1,451,309 1.87    4.00 Goats .....................       319,521 1.25    3.00 Mules........................       7,325 40.00   140.00 Burros......................       20,161 5.00    10.00 *Extreme winter or late spirng storms would reduce these averages. tQuotations supplied by C. L. Davis, stock expert of the Indian Bureau at Washington. Note the well-nigh unbelievable contrast between the average value of the Indian animal and of the farm, or bred-up, animal. The figures on the average value of the Indian animals are to some extent misleading. In isolated cases, breeding-up has been begun, with the result that certain Indian stock now brings high prices. But an examination of the figures shows that thousands of acres of prime Indian lands serve merely to graze thousand of un- salable native ponies, scrub cattle, goats, and burros. The economic crime may be easily illustrated: It costs as much to feed a worthless animal as it does a good one; the Indian pony, highly interesting in Indian "literature,”is nothing less than a public charge. Yet this same pony, crossed by a Percheron, makes a good animal. So, too, does a scrub heifer crossed with a Hereford bull The Commissioner found that the male animal in Indian herds has been almost universally low-grade. In many cases he discovered* February !?, K TH T2jjD MAN if 221 Illfciii,. ....................................................................... t|ut the male stock, has been quite insufficient in number for the s'ze of the herd. The majority of the herds needed almost a complete regeneration both of the "he-stuff” and the "she-stuff.” ■^r- Sells was convinced that if the present native male breeding stock could be replaced with approved breeds, the same number °f livestock would be worth, within five years, at least double their Present value. Of course each reservation presents a separate problem. Broadly sPeaking, however, the invoice justified two conclusions: First, that the very best grazing lands in America, where used by Indians at a^, are devoted in large part to "scrubs” that give little or no profit. Second, that the lands, when not used by the Indians, have either Hot been used at all or have been overused at ridiculously low rentals by white lessees. Abuse of grazing land by overuse is no less an economic crime than its misuse by worthless stock. Rebuilding the Herds 1)Y WAY of beginning an improvement, Commissioner Sells issued the following orders: Prohibiting the sale of any heifers whatever. Requiring elimination of all the old or low-bred bulls, rams, and stallions, the bulls to be fattened and sold. Providing that all subsequent leases to white cattlemen be made f°r short time and revocable, with a view to placing Indian herds Urider Government supervision on the lands as soon as possible. The essential feature of the program, after the above orders were lssued, was the purchase of the new animals. Congressional action was not necessary; if the Indian Com- m>ssioner had the confidence to use the money, the funds were avail- able- For many of the Indian tribes have large tribal savings which are under the control of the Indian Commissioner. And those lack- Ing cash have lands and timber that are first-rate security for loans. His experience as a banker had convinced Commissioner . e s o e absolute soundness of high-grade livestock as an investment se curity; he assumed the responsibility and, during the last six mon s, has bought right and left for the Indians.	.	. This scheme of constructive reorganization promises not on y Rouble returns to the Indian, but a double contribution y t>e n lan to the Nation’s food supply. And “these Indian grazing lands,IxJarA.'r::!iKii:;in,7' wvyvTT'f '^lwi,,^^||T^gr^.',0‘.X :........222..........; l TheKBDMAN , , J together with the agricultural lands in Indian ownership,” Com- missioner Sells declares, “will safely carry several times the number of livestock now on them.” Good Live Indians. X\TITH practical instruction and a few good object lessons, In- " * dians soon become quite proficient as stockmen, particularly with horses and sheep. In the cattle industry the Indians become ex- pert riders and ropers, but require white foremen. They take great pride in their equestrian feats, and in all prominent contest of the United States and Canada Indian horsemen are found competing) on equal footing, with white men. Where undisturbed by other stockmen, Indians train their range herds to a control which white men can not duplicate. They will hold large numbers on a given range, see that they get water, shift them as conditions may require—and this without the herds show- ing restlessness or tending to scatter. As shepherds, the Indian families of the Navajo country care for their herds with fidelity almost unknown elsewhere. During lamb- ing season the whole family stays with the flocks, and lambing per- centage is unusually high regardless of the weather conditions. “It is not only possible,” says Indian Commissioner Sells, “but entirely probable that the Indians will become the foremost herds- men of America. The situation presents a business and industrial opportunity, the successful working out of which will go a long way toward solving the meat problem.The Old Indian and the New: Ry Frederic Snyder, in The Assembly Herald. F anyone thinks that the old Indian has passed into history, and that the Indians of the United States now living belong to the class called the new Indian, ^ due to years of education and Christianization, he should visit the Indian pueblo of Santo Domingo in the State of New Mexico, to have his opinion somewhat changed.	. , , . The Pueblo Indians of this State have often been designated the c>vilized Indians of the country, probably because of the fact that they have from time immemorial lived in small villages, have followed a Crude mode of agriculture for an existence, have adopted a form o government partly suggested to them by the early Spanish colonists, and from the further fact that they were considered citizens o Mexico when this State was Mexican territory. The pueblo of Santo Domingo is situated on the A., T. & S. <. Rai'road, about 35 miles east of Albuquerque. There are about l>°00 Indians in the pueblo. They have their cultivated fields the Rio Grande, consisting of possibly 800 to 1,000 acres. Beside the land they actually cultivate, they have thousands of acres "'hich could be irrigated and made very valuable, and still 1‘ of acres of pasturelands, on part of which they herd their flocks o Soats and ponies.	, , ■ These Indians could be rich and independent i t ey wou UP their old customs and ceremonies and adopt modern i eah o civilization.	. « Their present form of government is paternal, tie cacique, 6°vernor, and principals having almost complete tule o\ er t e peopie. What these may say is law among them, and the unfortunate part of this is the fact that these men are of the old school and re- sent anything that looks like progress. They will receive no mod- ern agricultural implements, although the Government has offered to help them in this respect. They resent being told how they could improve their lands and increase their crops. They wish to be left alone, and have told the Indian agents and superintendents that their fathers tilled the soil and harvested their crops in a cer- tain way, and that way is good enough for them. Their ceremonies and customs do much to keep these people in these primitive ways- They have their religious dances, at some of which no white people are permitted to be present. Certain days are appointed on which all must plant their corn, and certain days for them to do other kinds of work, there being little opportunity for individuality. For years they have opposed the idea of having the Government estab- lish a day school at their pueblo, and recently, when the Govern- ment had decided to erect buildings, the Indians in council declared that they would not allow any materials to be brought to the school site. They relented, however, when the contractors began the building, but sent a delegation to Washington to see if they could not prevail upon the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to prevent the building of a school plant. By some arrangement made years ago,the SantoDomingo Indians have been sending some of their children to the Santa Fe Indian Training School. When the pupils return to their homes they are compelled to return to their old customs, the girls being required to give up their school dresses and don their native style of dress. It must not be supposed that among these younger boys and girls who have been off to school, there are none who have been impressed with the education received at the schools, and who would gladly make use of their training if they were allowed to do so, but the senti- ment in the pueblo among the older ones, who constitute a great ma- jority, is so strong that the younger ones must quietly submit to the old ways under pain of severe and cruel punishment. Therefore, to all appearances, the people of this pueblo are very unprogressive and primitive. But there are signs of the new Indian, even among the Santo Domingoes. Last summer when a number of the Santa Fe school boys were ready to start for Colorado to work in the beet fields”ear Rocky Ford, there was one Santo Domingo boy who was ctermined to go, although he had been told by the pueblo author- ' les ^at he could not go. The boy had a widowed mother, and e realized that she needed assistance, and he had the courage to 'jisist on going in order to earn some money to help his family, went to see the governor of the pueblo, who insisted that the °y could not go, to which he replied: “You want me to come °me to dance in the ceremonies and stay about the pueblo all sum- mer- My mother has little land and no crop, and I can do more to help her by going out to earn some money to buy flour for her when I return. If I don’t go, who will buy flour for her, and other lngs that she needs? I will go because that is my duty, and you ave no right to keep me here.” The boy was permitted to go, °ugh with great reluctance on the part of the governor. Just how far this young man may be able to withstand thepres- SUre °f old customs and traditions when he returns to the pueblo, cannot tell, but of this we are sure, that a new day is beginning to awn in the history of the Santo Domingo pueblo, and that while e old Indian is predominant now, there are signs that the new Indian Wl'l, in due course of time, take the place of the old, and then we may look forward to progress in Christianity and in material pros- Perity among these people.The Red Man’s Phantom. By Edna Hamilton. AR out o’er the sands of the desert, The last faint sun rays fall, Far off in the bluish hills, The night bird begins to call; And the long, long bark of the coyote As it glides thro’the sagebrush gray, And the lonesome song of the cricket, All blend with the fading day. As the stars shine up in heaven, And the dews of the night softly fall, A figure glides over the desert, A figure, dark, slender, and tall, With bowed head and blanket wrapped around him. His hair gently drifts with the breeze. The Red Man wields no weapon— He is following the call of the trees. He steps, lifts his head, and listens To the song that the cricket sings, And over the sage and the sand He sees the phantom of other things. His gaze soars away to the westward, Where the sun has fallen from sight, And with a great and noble longing, He rushes onward through the night. He has traveled far away from the cities, Where he bowed to the pale-faced will, But to-night, as his feet speed onward, He bows to a greater one still. His heart goes forth to the prairies, Out to the plains of the West, Forth to the hills of his childhood, Where his fathers eternally rest. The phantom comes nearer and nearer, The rivers and trees are all there, And his voice, as it did in boyhood, Rings through the gladsome air.There’s the buffalo feeding gently, On the plains in the valley below, And the clouds are floating serenely, Above the eternal peaks of snow. And now he is calling the wild fowl, Thro’ the canyon dark and deep, And now he is chasing the deer Up the mountain side, rough and steep. But at last dawns a morn of sorrow, For a child of the wind and sun, His days of freedom are over, His race is nearly run; No more will he chase the deer Up the mountain, rough and steep, No more will he call the wild bird Thro’ the canyon dark and deep; His arrow is thrown to the ground, Beside a warrior old and gray, That the feet of the white man trample, As he cruelly pursues his way. Then through the years of toil That pass like a torturing dream, The volcano that was only slumbering, Bursts forth in a fearful stream. He breaks the chain that bound him, Like a frail and slender reed, And he turned his face to the westward, Back where the buffalo feed. His eyes grow dim and he falters, As the phantom fades away. O	for one more glimpse of the prairies, And the hills his fathers trod; Then his could ascend in peace. Up to his own true God. As the moon rises bright in its glory, And nature is sweetly at rest, The spirit of one of God’s children Soars peacefully beyond the plains of the West.The American Indian—Changed Conditions. By Hon. Gabe E. Parker, in The Assembly Herald. HERE the Indian came from and how long he has lived in America nobody accurately knows. The story of life and death is the story of the rise and fall of nations and peoples. It is often through the ashes of the dead that we learn of the activities of the living. Thus ever it has been and thus ever it will be. The subject of this article pre-supposes change, transition, difference; what once was is not now. Standards of life are the result of changes, likewise changes are often the result of standards. What we are to-day is not what we were yesterday. “Nature abhors a vacuum,” and it may be asserted with nearly equal authority that nature despises rest, because everywhere we find pro- gression or retrogression, integration or disintegration. The phi- losophy of life is the philosophy of change. The important con- sideration, then, is that out of inevitable change shall come the best, widest sphere of life. How may there be the best? And how may we know it? These are the great questions of life and probably will not be answered this side the Great Beyond. But our constant attempts to answer them furnish the means of our advancement and the hope of our reward. The individual or the nation who em- bodies the best answers to these questions has made the greatest advancement and enjoys the greatest rewards. Each succeeding generation ought to be wiser and better than its predecessor, be- cause it has the successes of the past to impel, the mistakes to deter, and the strength to guide. Approximately 864,000 Indians were living in what is now the United States at the time of the discovery of America, and aboutinn;,,' v v1 t v	'V ''tl g^x^.iiihX3b^ I t THEEEDMAli ; |.........*® J UL AAA. AAA A A .A A A.^AlllEaC GX B jG3 300,000	is given as the Indian population to-day, a decrease of sixty- five per cent. This comparison is even more significant when we consider that all Indians of the discovery period were full-blood and that probably more than half the Indians of to-day are mixed- blood, many representing as little Indian blood as 1-16, 1-32, and 1-64 degree. Four hundred years of a different kind of life not °nly have reduced the Indians’ ownership of a continent to a few acres, but also have diminished their numbers to almost extinction. The basis of the domestic, social, and political organization of the early Indian was very generally the family, out of which foi various and obvious reasons grew the clan, tribe, nation, and con- federation. Among the Agonquins, the Iroquois, and theMusko- gees, particularly, these units were highly organized. Monogamy was the prevalent form of marriage, and the position of the woman •n most tribes was exalted, even to participating in the elections and determining the descent and distribution of property. Careful Gaining was given the young in hunting, fishing, handicraft, agricul- ture, speech, customs, social obligation, and tribal lore. The mis- taken idea that the Indians were nomads is forcibly corrected by reference to the visit of De Soto, who found the Indians from Flor- ida to Arkansas cultivating maize and other food plants. Early voyagers found the same thing true along the Atlantic, and Captain John Smith and his colony depended at first for subsistence very largely on the products of Indian cultivation. As a rule, the Indi- ans lived within well defined boundaries, leaving them only because °f necessity and not because of a natural disposition to wander. The Indian had many forms of government, from the simplest family group to the complex confederation of the highly organized tribes. For many years, and until recently, the Five Tribes of Oklahoma each had a constitutional government with the three co-or mate branches highly developed and in effective operation. T he ear \ Indian was a pagan, but he believed in the superhuman and in im- mortality. The future, however, concerned him less than t e pre sent. His religion was practical. He reverenced the spirit t at favored him; feared and discredited the spirit that frowne upon his efforts.	. .	. Upon the foundation of the past rests the condition of t e n dian of the present,—with few exceptions a magnificent oun ation, with many regrets, an incommensurate consummation. t is true230 i that the self-sacrificing missionary has done much to banish super- stition and to inculcate the Gospel of eternal life, that education and environment have joined hands to impart a common knowledge of one language and the skill to earn a living under new conditions, and that our Government has exercised a good-intentioned paternal guardianship. Still the voice of the past cries out for the thousands that have perished, reminds us that real progress has been too slow, and implores us to regard the Indian as a man, with the capabilities and the possibilities of a man. At the beginning every one must have seen that the inevitable, final results had to be either extermination or assimilation, and the basis of any policy should have been laid accordingly, else the policy would be out of harmony with the inevitable and a failure in the end. Certainly no one thought of extermination, hence assimilation should have been the basis and every possible provision made for the Indian to grow into that kind of citizenship to be prescribed and developed in these United States. Every inducement to break away from tribal, clannish relations, to learn the English language, to depend upon individual effort for maintenance—in short to live as and like the white people themselves proposed to live—should have been offered, and all laws, rules, and regulations should have made it possible for the Indian to be localized individually, to have possession of himself, with the fewest possible restrictions of his initiative, ingenuity, and disposition to accommodate himself to the white man’s ways. While the Indian of to-day shows great progress toward thinking and living in the substance of this civilization, still this progress is too often defective in the one vital essential of self-reliance. This is not the Indian’s fault, neither from heredity nor from choice. The fundamental fault lies in the construction of the Indian’s own- ership of land as becoming only the “right of occupancy.” Such a title, if indeed it can be called a real title, has had neither stability nor security, certainly it has not encouraged individual sagacity or industry; in fact it has been a community restriction which has now passed to the individual where allotments have been made. It seems hard to get away from the idea that the Indian has only the “right of occupancy,” for indeed a restricted individual title is nothing more or less. We must get away from this idea if the Indian is to make real progress. Give the Indian a real title to • TheBedMan , mil. ..Illllu.illllh..itl|[l!t..k]lilli. jllllfl.

Give him what he has been led to believe he will receive in lands and moneys, with restrictions on those individuals who are determined to be incompetent by personal investigation, these restrictions to be the fewest possible. There is probably no surer nor quicker way to develop self-reliance and individual effort than by making a man earn his own support, and there is probably no surer nor Quicker way to extinguish these essential qualities than by giving him something for no effort on his part. Herein lies the differ- ence between success and failure. T he moving, ration, and ex- pectant systems must cease before individual effort and progress will begin. Quit doing so much for the Indian; permit and re- quire him to do more for himself; give him a real chance. Regard the Indian as a man, think more of his personal development, and remember that competency is the result of performance, not of enunciation.A Progressive Bois Fort Indian— Ben D. Beargrease: By Albert B. Reagan. en D. Beargrease (Chief Tahbahkonung) is an Indian of forty-six years of age and has never been married. He is the son of Chief Mah-je-ke-shig and Ogahbayosayquay. His father had two wives with whom he lived jointly till his death January 4, 1907. By his wife No. 1 he had ten children and by his wife No. 2 he had three children. His wife was O-ke- mah-quay. As stated, he lived jointly with both wives and both outlived him. Both of the widows then lived with Ben till their death. O-ke-mah-quay died several years ago and Ben’s own mother died July 10, 1913. O-ke-mah-quay’s children are all dead. They died without marrying and without issue. At this writing only four of the Beargrease children are living—Mike Beargrease, Ben D. Beargrease, Lizzie Beargrease, and Julia Blair. The double marrying of Ma-je-ke-shig has made it a difficult matter to probate the property of the deceased members of this family. When the Bois Fort Indians began to gather themselves in vil- lages, Mah-je-ke-shig and his family moved to Stony Brook, which was later dubbed Brookston when the Great Northern Railroad entered the region. It is one of the flourishing small towns on that road at the present time. At the death of his father, Ben became chief and has been so recognized ever since. Around him are col- lected quite a number of Indians both of the Fond du Lac and Bois IR^SI u “Superintendent of the Nett Lake, Minn., Agency.Fort bands.

N TIME long past, beyond all date of reckoning) Keshimanido, the Great Spirit, created the Indians. They knew neither sickness nor sorrow, and were more powerful, skillful in games, swifter in the race, and happier than they have ever been since the breaking of the Vine. Game filled the forests, birds of gayest plumage made the air melodious with song, and both came and went at man’s bidding and held friendly intercourse with him, knowing no fear, for they had never been run to earth in the murderous chase. Large, beautiful fish sported in bright waters, and fruits and every edible thing covered field and plains ready for use without the effort of toil- To complete man’s happiness, messenger spirits to guide and counsel him were often sent to visit the tribes whose wigwams were as countless as the stars in the skies. In those days there grew a Vine whose branches reached Heaven and which Keshimanido forbade any one to climb, as it was the ladder of communication with Heaven. Any attempt or even desire to do so would incur the Great Spirit’s anger and bring upon the offender dire punishment as well as the loss of his love and care- An awesome fear of breaking the Heavenly intercourse so filled their hearts that there was not the least wish to disobey, until envy and jealousy crept in and ended this ideal existence intended to endure forever. Among the youngest and bravest of the chiefs was handsome Wapesa, who lived alone in his wigwam with the aged mother of the old chief, his father. She was formerly a great queen, powerful in the council. Wapesa was often preferred before the other chiefs as companion of the Manado, or messenger sprit sent by Keshi- manido, to visit among the tribes. This preference and friendship that resulted, though it brought them much good, roused their bit- terest enmity. Wapesa’s authority they at first covertly defied, then openly derided, and tested to the utmost the forebearance with which he shielded them from the Manado’s displeasure. His tolerance they mistook for cowardice, and they increased his suffering by unbearable cruelty, such as only blind rage and jealousy could devise.'NDIAN TYPES—WOMAN AND BABE OF COCH1TI PUEBLO.

Another, that as the old woman was the cause of their heavy affliction, only her descendants should be made to suffer atonements. The last prayed earnestly for a renewal of the Great Spirit’s love, and that disease and misery might speedily end. With a compassionate look on the wretchedness about him, he disappeared, but before many moons he again stood among then1 with the Great Spirit’s message. The Heavenly Vine had been broken by disobedience and would never be restored. They had grievously persecuted his chosen one on earth; they had taken the first life. Sickness and death was the punishment incurred. Keshimanido, their Great Spirit, pitying their sorrows, had sent him to instruct them how to find a cure for their many ills. As he said this he gathered the flowers of the fields and those that gre" by the edges of rivers, and drying them on the palms of his hand5 blew the leaves and petals to the four winds until they were scat" tered all over the earth. Wherever they fell,shrubs and herbs sprang up, the use of which for every ill he explained. Then, raising h‘ voice in farewell, he disappeared from their sight forever. "Remember every blade of grass that grows, every leaf th^ opens, every flower that blooms, the Indian requires in health °r sickness. But by toil he must cultivate them, and offer the frUifS of the earth and repentance to the Great Spirit.”You’ll Be a Man F YOU can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; If you trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting, too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, Or, being hated, don’t give way to hating, And yet don’t look too good, nor talk top wise. If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build’ em up with worn-out tools. If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the will which says to them: "Hold on.” If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings—nor loss the common touch; If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it, And—what is more—you’ll be a man, my son !

LONG, long time ago, many, many moons before the white man came, when the buffalo were as blade® of grass on the prairie, there came a great dry spell- No rain fell and the grass grew brown and th® rivers dried up; the buffalo went away and people could get nothing to eat but a few berries and they gre^ hungry and thin. Every day they prayed to the Great Spirit f°r rain and made much medicine, but the rain did not come. The Great Spirit was angry. Among the greatest of the medicine men was Nashewa. He made much medicine. All day he prayed to the Great Spirit, and all night, and finally the Great Spirit came to him in a dream and said, “Nashewa, awake, and travel west until you receive a sign- And Nashewa heard and was glad. The next morning he started and he went a long way to the we^ until he came to what is Gechigome (Great Lakes). He saw there a bird that was sitting near the edge of the water. He walked to- wards it. When he was looking at it he knew that the bird did not belong to this country. Its feathers were all of different colors, ifS bill was green and its legs were colored the same. It would not open its eyes. Then he took it and came back home. He entered his lodge and all the chiefs were invited. The bird sat attheupPef end of the lodge and Nashewa told these chiefs, “Nowhere is a bird that you may look at it to know what it is.” It was not known^ nobody could tell what kind of a bird it was, so they called it the Awneemekee (The Thunderbird). After a while Nashewa pushed it, then it opened its eyes and they flashed lightning. The door opened and the bird flew out. As he got outside the sky darkened and the thunder roared and it rained. Many days it rained and the grass grew green again and the buffalo returned and my people got fat once more. This is the story of the Awneemekee (Thunderbird)- My grandfather told it to me and his grandfather told it to hi*11'Indian Education: Present and Future: Continued from Page 218. win inW|^ PreParat*on, in school and after school, if they hope to yn the race of life. ^ian^h'01’’ ^ sh°u^ hke to give testimony as to the efficiency of this affSC °°*S ^ filing the attention of the guests who are here to the g61"]000,0 uPon invitation from the Society of American Indians the rnemKn l- type °f manh°°d and womanhood which makes up Product-1 eJS^'P ^is Society. 1 he majority of the members are can. jyj he Indian schools of the Nation.
