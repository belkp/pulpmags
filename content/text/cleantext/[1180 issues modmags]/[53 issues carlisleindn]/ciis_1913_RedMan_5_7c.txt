THE RED MAH ‘ ‘ Ye say they have all passed away, That nohle race and brave; That their light canoes have vanished From off the crystal wave; That ’mid the forest where they roamed There rings no hunter's shout; But their name is on your waters And ye cannot wash it out.” URING the past summer the last two lines of this stanza kept singing in the writer’s ears. The old Indian trail was first taken up at Old Town, on the Potomac. It was followed along the eastern slope of the Warriors Ridge^ to the Juniata, and then across the various mountain ridges to the site of ^arn°kin (now Sunbury), on the Susquehannna. Then the trail th S(< en UP West Branch to the Sinnemahoning, and then over e divide” to the waters of the Allegheny, ou	t^le course of these great trails great cities have arisen . °f the once whispering wilderness of forest trees. The glitter- s steel rails of the modern trails of civilization, which cross the of «	Man,or run along their course, have taken the place Sh 'r ^S^t canoes,” as means of transportation. Shawnee Town, lo	ani° > Paxtang, Assinsing, and the other Indian villages have nS since been buried under the foundations of Cumberland, arrisburg, Sunbury, Williamsport, Pittsburgh and other cities of t0~day. “But—their name is on your waters And ye cannot wash it out.” p 0	°mac, Juniata, Susquehanna, Sinnemahoning, Allegheny—these re the names which with hundreds of others remain as haunting rnem°ries of the far distant past. the writer stood at the intersection of the North and Westfjnk. *.....Bfc.-'., nn.jr	■» «■ t. i "v -r 272 " | The RedMan •' Branches of the Susquehanna, at the present city of Sunbury, afl“ looked across the broad bosom of the united river, to the Blue on the western shore, he was facing one of the great trails which once led to the Ohio. It is not easy to realize that in order to reach the Allegheny, the Red warriors went up the Susquehann® to this point, and then struck westward up the West Branch valley- Yet such was the case. As all roads led to Rome, so all India0 trails in Pennsylvania led to Shamokin (now Sunbury), the larged Indian town in Pennsylvania, within historic times. For, here dwelt Shikellamy, the diplomat of the Iroquois who held the Dela- ware and Shawnee in check. When some Indian chief at Shan- nopin’s Town (now Pittsburgh) wanted to sell a few hundred acres of land, around in the region of the present East End, to some charitable Virginian for two quarts of so-called whisky, he had to get the consent of Shikellamy before the transaction was “legal- Consequently the road to Shamokin was a well-travelled one. As you strike up the West Branch valley you cut through the many mountain ridges, getting into a more and more lofty series of hills and into more and more narrow valleys until you reach the Sinnemahoning—where you feel as if the great towering hills would fall down on you. If you were going to the Ohio you would go on up the West Branch to the present Clearfield, and then on to “the Forks.” But, if you were going to the headwaters of the Allegheny* and on into the Seneca country, you would go on up the Sinnemaho- ning to the “Canoe Place,” and then you would hide your canoe in the bushes and make the portage over the “divide” to the present Port Allegheny. From here you would go northward into Ne"' York State, around the bend at Olean and then on southward over the glittering surface of the Allegheny. Have you ever thought that this short portage of about 20 miles is the only one you would have to make if you were an Indian, in travelling from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico? Here was a great “Trunk” line from Philadelphia to New Orleans. Ah- Could the Allegheny but tell what it knows of the days when the canoes of the unknown race of Red Men skimmed over its spark- ling waters! On the hill top, Sweden Hill, it is called, just above Couders- port, are four little springs. One flows northward until it become* the Genesee River; another flows northeastward into the Susque-I " " f THEEEDMAN ;' I.........273.........J| fcftlllu ..fll2lb_.lllll<.utl!flluilt(til^llll|l..Jli!ll..>lliliktfiiilk.^4llli..jiiii|||u|lltik.^rillMI lia.Iil* *1^ .llflUM*!1 -dilll I !*anna; the third flows southward into the West Branch, and the •	flows westward, then northward, and then southward past the ty of Pittsburgh.

Here they were first encountered by the white '''ere W^° ^3Ve them the name Delaware, because their great villages rep-' 0n that stream.

This gave the river its early name of “the ri^e of the Akansea.” The Shawnee called it “Palawa Thepeki, °r “Turkey” river. The Iroquois name was “O-hee-yo,” which wat, corrupted into Ohio. The Delaware name was “Kithann*> “Great River.” The French called it “La Belle Riviere,” ‘ .* beautiful river.” The name which has remained is that given t0 because the Allegewe, its earliest human occupants, lived along lts shores. It must be remembered that the names given above applied 10 the stream now known as the Allegheny, and the great river known as the Ohio, which was looked at as being a continuation 0 the first stream. The Monongahela was marked as a tributary the Allegheny. What tales this stream could tell of the Arkansas, the Allegefl[ ' the Erie, the Iroquois, the Shawnee, the Delaware, and then of{ first white men who floated over its bosom! The first French * pedition from Canada to the site of Pittsburgh came down 1 stream in 1749, opening the way for the struggle between the t* great World powers for the possession of the region for which 1 Red Men had been fighting for countless generations.	. A few days ago the writer wandered through the dark hend° forests which remain at the headwaters of this historic stream. ^ about him stood the great giants, straight as arrows—even with t burden of centuries of years upon them. It was as silent as m> ocean, for the sounds of the places where men lived were entirely out by the thousands and thousands of acres of hemlock trees, the hill tops from which the trees had been cut, or burned away> * wind was blowing; down in the depths of that primeval forest n a leaf was stirring on the underbrush.	c All about were the brown, decaying, moss-covered remain* the hemlocks which had been waving their great arms over t forest 500 years ago.

And then, my thoughts fle'v back to a few evenings before when I sat by the side of J ames Thorpe at a reception at the United States Indian School at Carlisle. AU about us were the trophies which this wonderful Indian had won at Stockholm, as the champion all-around athlete of the world-' and so, of all time. There was the Viking ship of silver from the Czar of Russia, the heroic bust of the King of Sweden, and the many other prizes won by his prowess over all the athletic heroes of the world. And as the dark hours of night fell upon that world of hemlocks I wondered if the shades of Canasatego, Tedyuskungi Shikellamy, the heroes of the Red Men of the past, could know as they wandered through the “Happy Hunting Ground” how their descendants were taking other prizes in the World of Men than those of the chase. Parker, Thorpe,Tewanima, Bender, Dagenett, Eastman, Deitz-" and the scores of other leaders of the Red Men, who surpass the leaders of the White Men in many lines of human effort, prove that the highest type of primitive man who ever lived on the face of the earthhas not “passed away,” but rather that he is just beginning t0 be. Blood will tell, and the blood which so often stained the waters of “The Beautiful River” with so deep a hue that nothing can “wash it out” will in the years to come have a story to tell which will make the White Man listen. Superintendent Friedman, of the Indian School, is helping to bring sublime harmony out of the lives of these Children of Nature, whose ancestors lived and loved on the shores of the historic stream which flows through the very heart of Pittsburgh.hjdian Race, Perishing, Gives Nation Men of Influence: r°m the Memphis Commercial Appeal. IIVE the Indian a chance! This demand that America’s legitimate children, the surviving members of a wonderful race, be given a square deal by the country which rightfully be- longs to them grows stronger hourly. It is a plea that goes up from the heart of every patriotic citizen; a plea backed by love of country and sincere af- fection for the noble red man, once monarch of all he surveyed on this continent but now making his stand on the rim of a civilization that has taken all he had and him little in return. should be necessary to make such a plea for the lawful c ers, °f this great land will seem strange to residents of other sm 11 neS’ ^ut t^1at PromPt action is necessary to insure them the c°mforts to which they are entitled has been shown by the clo ^ disclosures dealing with life on the Indian reservations, dis- theSUt"eS ^at bought a twinge of conscience to every one that read q ■ Investigation showed that the picturesque wards of the afteVerniTlent are ke'nS neglected and that those delegated to look e(xr^e*r simPle wants had been remiss in their duties. ° l rnany uninformed persons have been accustomed to point °n h USe^essness °f educating the Indian, basing their contention pre e more or less popular belief that no amount of education can e entthe Indian from reverting to the barbaric life of his fathers, to mernbers of the race have made good after getting a chance tali Ute ^at belief.

In the battle against tremendous odds that stoicism which is one of their chief characteristics has proved a valuable asset, no rebuff being severe enough to stay their onward march to success. T h*s splendid determination has won the admiration of all men. For- tunately, those who believe that the Indian should be given every opportunity to raise himself are in the majority. Every community can furnish illustrations of what education and considerate treat" ment will do for him. He is found in the halls of Congress, in State legislatures, in the courts, studios, pulpits and business houses. What he has done in all branches of outdoor sport forms one of the brightest pages in America’s athletic history. That he should excel in athletic contests comes as no great surprise, because nature has provided him with the physical equipment essential to success in that field. OijReference to a few members of the race who have won their way to positions of responsibility and trust will not be out of place right here. Oklahoma, a State peopled with many tribes, naturally has more Indians engaged in business and professional pursuits than any other State. Many of these Indians have built up splendid businesses and are ranked among the best citizens of the State. Their integrity is unquestioned and they are active in any movement looking to- ward the betterment of the less fortunate members of their race. Many of the State and municipal officials are Indians or have Indian blood in their veins. In the United States Senate the State is rep- resented by Senator Robert L. Owen, a full-blooded Cherokee. Senator Owen is one of the ablest legislators at Washington, a splendid orator, strong in debate and convincing in his arguments. Tall, sinewy, with broad shoulders, thick black hair and snapping black eyes, he is the typical Indian. He has a winning personality and has a large circle of acquaintances throughout the country- Representative Charles D. Carter, a Choctaw Indian, represents an Oklahoma district in the House of Representatives. Both are Demo- crats. Senator Charles Curtis, a Kaw, is one of the two men who rep- resent Kansas in the United States Senate. Senator Curtis is a fine talker and holds the attention of his colleagues whenever he ad-VHV.

Frank nght, a Choctaw. The Rev. Mr. Brigham is an ordained priest 0	the Protestant Episcopal Church and the Rev. Mr. Wright an eVangelist of considerable reputation in the West. Dr. Charles Alex- a,1der Eastman is a noted author and lecturer. Prominent among the archaeologists of the country is Arthur C. arker, a Seneca Indian, for.some time past the official archaeologist ° State of New York. The first Indian to take out a patent at ashington is Nicholas Longfeather, an Apache, who has taken stePs to protect a preparation for strengthening young trees. A large number of Indians are employed in the Government jVice> and in every case they have given entire satisfaction. Two e fiien are employed as postmasters—Joseph R. Sequichie at Chel- Sea> Okla., and Albert H. Simpson at Elbowoods, N. D. Leaving the various vocations in which the Indian has won suc- ^Ss for the athletic field, where undying fame is the chief reward, all nanie James Thorpe, a Sac and Fox Indian, looms far above °thers. Any story dealing with the athletes of the universe for time to come will have to start with the achievements of 0rpe, for this sturdy young buck is the champion all-round athlete ° the world. He won that enviable title at the Olympic games in °ckholm last summer, and he won it by such a wide margin that ®xPerts figure it will be many a day before his wonderful record is "eaten. , ®nIy 24 years old, this real American met the pick of the world’s ^ letes and wrested victory from them without exerting himself. Will be remembered he was given a splendid ovation on his re- rn to this country, an ovation led by the other members of the ®aiTi that represented America in the Olympic games. Thorpe °od the adulation for a day or two and then slipped back to the ^dian school at Carlisle, Pa., the place that has turned out so many ** Ian athletes. He went to work with the football squad with as Uch eagerness as if he had not just been crowned the king of athletes. W°rk on the football team this year has been up to his usual etic standard. While on the subject of football it is worth while reca,ling that Carlisle has always put out one of the best teams in the»srAt» * 284 iwt |»y .....................HP1.......................................................tfIIIIT ; I, THEKEDMAN [ *■»*......J ,.'l HIV •>. .„. .... * .... * -* .. ...

As football players the Indians are great drawing cards* lovers of the game knowing there will be plenty of action any time they start. “Tom” Longboat and Lewis Tewanima are Indian athletes who have established themselves as distance runners, each having won 3 number of gruelling Marathon contests. Tewanima’s progress >n the athletic world has been extremely rapid. It is only a few years ago that he was roaming the forests, a member of the Hopi tribe o of Indians. With a dozen other youngsters he arrived at Carlisle and before he had been there a great while showed his class as 3 runner. Baseball has opened up the trail to glory for a number of Indians, but none of the members of the race who took up this branch 0 sport achieved the fame that has come to John Meyers, of the Ne" York Giants, and Charles Bender, of the Philadelphia Athletic*- Meyers, a Mission Indian, is ranked as one of the best catchers *n the great national game. He is one of the most popular players on Manager McGraw’s team. Bender’s claim to baseball glory is t0° well known to need repetition. A member of the Chippewa tribe* he is regarded as one of the greatest pitchers that ever entered th® box, his wonderful performances putting him in the class wit Mathewson, Wood and other stars of the diamond. If these interesting human facts do not convince the reader thaf education for the Indian is worth while, a few dry statistics aboU the Indian School at Carlisle may change his mind. Of the 51 graduates of the school, 93 are in the Government service, 71 aTe merchants, doctors, lawyers, journalists, lecturers, or engineers; 5 are farmers or ranch owners; 86 are working at trades, and 142 are housewives. Of the 4,000 who were there for part terms, 94 Pef cent are earning an honest living.Vocational Training for the Indians: By W. A. Cook, in Vocational Education. INCE the onset of the industrial movement in our schools, numerous educators have become quite involved in the “motor training” and “pedagogical value” aspects of the case, and not a few are still regrettably prone to sneer at the idea of real voca- tional results from vocational training as rather js , academic ideals or at least as only a very minor result. It er®fore rather refreshing to examine the efforts of those en- Uj ,n ^e national work of educating the Indians, because these tech aVC ^een concerned solely with the vocational outcomes of res-a. and industrial training and have left the less certain general e(ju s. to care for themselves. Traditional modes of evaluating SchCaI>on have persisted to a considerable extent in our public have- S\whereas both the enemies and friends of Indian education Th "}Slsted upon the attainment of immediate and tangible results. °f tlm article is to present a brief view of the develop- b 1 of industrial training in Indian schools, an account of what is Her^ ^°ne’ h°w>tis being done, and what effects are in evidence. 6 anc^ there suggestions of appropriate lines of further adjust- are made. Jjj^i rorr| early in the nineteenth century there existed among the peUa,ls m various places “manual labor” schools, based on the ^cien'1*3er^ mo(^‘ While these institutions produced some pro- hy i artlsans> they probably succeeded in doing so only indirectly b^ uCU^Cat’n® a taste ^or c'v'*'zed life. They were really nothing "'o t°arc*'ng schools where pupils passed spare moments at house- g 0r hoeing in the garden. fror^l‘^when the great impulse to the study of industries went out Massachusetts some thirty-five years ago, it was nowhere moreV 286 n>- .................................... w up ••mil-1’>ii|ir- -wmi EThbEbdMan j[.......—......j fully accredited than in the nonreservation Indian schools just then starting. Hampton, already dedicated to the accomplishment o definite industrial ends for another race, began to receive Indians on like terms for the same purpose. Carlisle, from the beginning' was a technical school in a rather strict sense. An utterance of ifS founder, Capt. R. H. Pratt, some years later, may be taken as an expression of the Carlisle platform over his whole connection "’it*1 the institution. He said: We have an Indian problem because the Indian is ignorant of the language of the country and industriously untrained to take his place among our otnef people. The problem will remain as long as the Indians are continued in masses apart from our other people, because by such massing they are held t° their industrial inability and their ignorance of our language. The course at Hampton embraced work on the farm, in the saw- mill, in the brickyard, in the shops, sewing and housekeeping, kitchen and garden work. The trades soon developed were wheelwright^.? blacksmithing, engineering, painting, printing, shoe and harness making, carpentry and tinning. During the first two of the three years’ course these were accompanied by training in the elemental school arts, and in the last by more advanced mathematics and son1 science. Academic and manual studies divided the time equally- Even at vacation time regular hours and fixed vocations were re tained. For their work the boys were paid wages, out at whiC they bought their own clothes. Under encouragement from every side the industrial move- ment grew apace. Interested parties frequently made gifts of in' dustrial equipment. In the era of rapid buildingand opening of ne" institutions self-reliance was placed at a premium. At some schools the contractors, who had come to look on Government jobs “soft” ones, had not even a chance to bid. All work was complete by the boys under direction of the chief carpenter. The neces- sary supplies of food and clothing for the school absorbed an enor nious amount of industrial energy, for every dollar saved thu could be applied on additions and improvements which the sch° could not make for itself. The Government allowed training schoo • to supply goods for the general Indian service. Thus in 1881 Car lisle manufactured over $6,000 of varied products which went t0 forty-two different agencies.	, Thus economic rather than educational needs were the directi'Prce- A boy was a larger asset to his school at some other craft an at farming. Small farms and the undeveloped state of agri- Ure as a science tended in the same direction. The Carlisle re- P°rt for 1886, while admitting that the “farm is a most necessary and useful adjunct,” and deploring its distance from the school, shows at every trade except painting and baking had more apprentices an farming, which claimed an "average of nine.” It is therefore apparent that, aside from the outing system, which fortunately placed e e>nphasis on farming, agriculture did not receive the merited attention, and the expression, “an average,” leads to the suspicion *t farming was a sort of makeshift for the odd or otherwise un- ^ lzed help. All the schools had some land and felt that it had to e tilled, but agriculture was evidently not regarded as a calling to studied as was tailoring or carpentry. Increasing Importance of Agriculture. This deplorable tendency was somewhat corrected as time went , • Carlisle now has two convenient farms containing nearly three ndred acres, which are being worked to their full capacity with ,ertain reservations for grazing purposes. In the West where land ^ Very plentiful, agriculture has been more strongly emphasized, the advancement was extremely slow. With about nine thou- ?aild acres of choice land the Chilocco school had only twelve boys ^ agriculture ten years after its establishment. But conditions have ^anged wonderfully in both reservation and nonreservation schools, ^atistics of subsistence raised are instructive, because they show at agriculture is coming into its own, even in the day schools, lch report from a few dollars or nothing up to over $2,000 made ^ually in this way. The number of students enrolled in the erent industries is also significant. Incomplete returns show at the students working on school farms increased from fifteen Undred to over four thousand from 1897 to 1904, which is entirely °ut of proportion to the increase in total enrollment. And best of > along with this has gone a revolution in methods of agricultural eac"ing. The school farmer no longer lays out the land for differ- **t crops, stipulates the amount of seed, the methods of tending and arvesting the crop, etc. Of course the boys still do the work, but ey are a party to the planning for the season, they understand the eason for each step, they measure the results. In short, agricul- e ls not studied as art, but as science.I 288 Itowj! ; thekedman„ it If i— ..iilllu. .illlii, iilltlii...ilitli. .idllh, .^illli^ ..iliflii rfiliiki.-i'illlii.. u if Iti... 111 lit* ■ . •iiiliuJ March 1 till uXD.rW'JS!/'-** The cause of this transformation is the realization that the aver- age Indian student returns to an economic society where the dominant note must be agriculture. Ninety per cent, according to most authorities, must conquer the soil or return to barbarism- Many cases of reversion have resulted from the glutting of the fron- tier market with tradesmen. Indian educators now understand that so long as there are distinct Indian schools, agriculture must be taught more than anything else, combined with such instruction in the use of tools as to make of the Indian an independent farmer. They appreciate that they must keep the future environment of the lttdian more in the focus of consciousness than the future of an ordinary American. The writer predicts, however, that this matter of adaptation is a much more special problem than it is generally recognized to be- lt may not mean agriculture or it may mean much more than agri' culture. The climate and resources of different reservations vary greatly. In many localities the lack of moisture means that stock- raising must become the principal industry. Most of the mineral wealth of the reservation communities was carved out by Caucasian cupidity long ago. In other places horticulture and gardening are more important, agriculture less so. Again, a school which fits for a certain locality to-day may have to alter radically its course inside of ten years because of some economic transformation. Just as m the public schools, so in live Indian schools, the question of adap' tation and correlation is calling for diverse and continuous solution- The central authorities are more alive to this phase of the situation than the rank and file. They have directed that “agriculture, stock- raising, and kindred pursuits” shall be taught at all schools where practicable. Hence school employees connected with this depart- ment are directed to take their leaves of absence at times of the year when they can best be spared. Necessary details of pupils are to remain at school during the summer months to carry through the plans for the season. Wherever gardeningis possible, the boys in the day schools must be taught to raise vegetables. Both extensive and intensive types of farming are represented at the different schools. From its location Carlisle has naturally adopted the close methods of the eastern farmer, who uses every foot of his land for the largest results. Each sort of soil >s carefully studied as to its productive powers; intelligent rotation >s■ 289 4 1|Hj",ni‘' .................................tm"T|,,|ii|r,<iir"""ii",',,in"n,,r'' .....J| TheKedMan Relied, rotation which contemplates the maintaining of the wealth ® the soil rather than artfully filching from it the last iota of its tuny; commercial fertilizers, their comparative values and uses are examined; special attention is given to methods of cultivation, rainage, and reclamation, destruction and annihilation of weeds. Is procedure affords a pleasing contrast to the prodigality of most estern farmers, and ought to give the Carlisle man a great advan- ce when he comes to cultivate his allotment. In 1908-9 the Chi- . Cco school raised subsistence worth about $1.40 per acre. Haskell n the same section of the country, thus eliminating the element of ^°P failure, ran to about $15 per acre. At Fort Totten, North s .ak°ta, each acre yielded $22.50; at Carlisle, $30; at Sherman In- 1	ute, Riverside, California, $55. These figures do more than to strate difference in resources and prices in different parts of the °untry; they illustrate the difference between a system of agricul- e which has robbed the American people of a tremendous re- ?°Urce, and another system which is to restore our fertile soil and tlSure the support of a vastly increased population. Features of the Work in Agriculture. ■	^he content of the course in agriculture need not be discussed n Retail. The subjects correspond to those studied in our best a§r>culturai schools by pupils of similar capacity. Two or three sPecial features may be briefly noted. The number of different Cr°ps studied in a cosmopolitan school like Haskell is necessarily ^reat- Among those taken up at the Lawrence school are corn,wheat, tKtS’ Sor§hum, kaffir corn, potatoes, rutabagas, millet, clover, timo- y* alfalfa, and all varities of vegetables usually grown in a temper- e climate. Sherman Institute has taken up the live issue of irriga- °n- Fort Totten looks like an agricultural college with its experi- mental farm of forty acres, divided into small lots for scientific ®t*ng with the grains and vegetables grown in that region. Many ^ools are managing their gardens in small plats, each under a jngle pupil, rather than permitting individuals to work at will in Parts of the school garden. Chilocco for years has had a fine rchard and nursery. Extensive stock-raising and dairying have been introduced into Several schools, while nearly all boarding schools maintain small erds to furnish school subsistence.

Their ponies, for instance, as a rule, are useless for almost any purposes except those so dear to the aboriginal heart, saddle and bareback races. Boys may now become familiar with the better breeds of cattle, horses, hogs, and poultry- 1	hree breeds of cattle in one school give splendid facilities for com- parison of dairy and beef merits. A knowledge of the rearing of all kinds of domestic animals is significant not simply from the eco- nomic side of producing marketable stuff and lowering living expen' ses, but also because it affords a greater variety of food for home consumption. Pure milk and stock disease will soon be import- ant branches. Carlisle in the near future expects to attack tuber- culosis in cattle, a scourge which has been devastating their herd to the extent of $1,200 annually. Trade Instruction. Work in the trades has become sufficiently differentiated. Alto- gether over forty trades or occupations are now being taught. Some of the large nonreservation schools with their varied constituency are giving more than twenty. To these must be added some well- organized commercial departments, Haskell’s being preeminent) and a good course in telegraphy at Carlisle. Great care must be taken, as already indicated, to make these occupations practical- An adept shoemaker will starve where people wear only moccasins* a first-class carpenter will become a public charge if his neighbors live in adobe huts or sod houses, unless he can combine other remunerative labor with his trade. The most successful of the returned students who have studied trades, are those who carry farming, gardening, dairying, or poultry-raising as a “side-line.” The efficiency of these lines of work hardly admit of question- School manufactures compete successfully in the open market. Premiums have been won at nearly all great expositions. To take printing alone, the apprentices of several schools edit regular pub- lications, covering the work and news of the school and discussing questions of Indian education and civilization. The Weekly Che- mawa American, The Indian Leader (Haskell), and the Red Man (Carlisle) are all very attractive. The Chemawa press issued the Re- port of the Superintendent of Indian Schools for 1909. Other vo- cations offer multiplied illustrations. The methods leading to these results must interest all educators-I?. *.

Some leading schools appreciate highly e benefits of manual training, sloyd, or mechanical drawing, to all, ^gardless of their future occupation. At Haskell every boy must . e some manual training. In this class the general principles of r°n'Vorking and woodworking are taken up; the pupil learns the ames, use, and care of common tools, the qualities of different as of wood, etc.; the elements of joining, forging, molding, all ' d a place. Working drawings precede execution. Always ereis the conscious effort at correlation of industrial and academic K so evident in the best negro schools. The industries them- ves are taught largely by doing work under trained employees, 0	from the laundress up are instructors in their respective de- partments. The classroom work is not slighted. Evening lec- res for agricultural and industrial students are in vogue. Appren- shCes usually spend half of each day in the school, the rest in the °P or on the farm. If facilities allow, the forenoon is spent in- tat°rS> ^ut departmental organization and lack of shop room necessi- oth f°renoon and afternoon sessions, indoors and out. No er plan of dividing the time has been so satisfactory, though . rr>ate days and a division of four and two days per week have been tried. So general an agreement after nearly thirty years exPeriment should interest students of the cooperative plan. Training for Girls. OR the girls large provision has not been lacking. The course ^ ,n domestic science is broad and practical, more inclusive than to ■)Ur	schools. In a boarding school it is natural and easy -p^lnclude the care of one’s room and the making of one’s clothes. , ,ere ls actual scrubbing, sweeping, and dishwashing, activities t cf* are increasingly important for people who have never learned w°rk and whose homes cannot teach them even these conimon- th^6	Girls are expected to go outside the house and learn e Care of dairy products, the raising of poultry, the making of s en. The domestic science teaching is stripped of dangerous ^P^rfluities. Girls learn to darn and to sew by hand, and then to ch°r ^le sewing machine afterwards. Steam washers, electric s K|rnS anc^ 'rons are found in many large schools because indispen- le to the economical working of the school, but their exclusive Pr 292 ft TheEedMak : J LY	....................................................... use is not regarded with favor. Some schools make the girls do their personal washing by hand. An illustration entitled “Bread- making at a Pine Ridge Day School,” found in a recent report of the Superintendent of Indian Schools, is to the point. It shows two girls in a plain kitchen, cooking bread, not with a gas or gasoline range, not with a common coal range of modern type, but with what appears to be an old-style wood stove. The best policy is plain* these girls must be educated for the life they are to lead. But they have a right to such knowledge of the comforts of life and labor- saving devices of the housewife as will give them the “upward look. 1	hey must return to their reservations able to take things as they find them, yet impelled with an aspiration for better conditions, f°r upon their ideals depends the uplift of the home life in the distant places. The preceding treatment should not be construed as meaning that the nonreservation schools have a virtual monopoly on indus- trial training. Reports show that they are simply leading the way- The reservation boarding schools necessarily do less work, the pupils are younger, the facilities more limited. Only three or four trades are dealt with, usually carpentry, blacksmithing, shoemaking* harness making, some painting and bricklaying. Farming, stock- raising, dairying, and gardening are practically universal, and in 3 fashion are found in nearly all day schools. The nonreservation standard is more nearly equaled in the training for girls, who get almost everything adapted to their age. The lack of suitable indus- trial teachers at the salaries paid in reservation schools is a gre3t handicap just as in our own rural schools, yet we find the Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs stating after a recent tour that the Indian schools are “at least twenty-five years in advance of the present public-school system in industrial training.” The new cooperative plan, which is exciting so much notice m this country, has been launched at Carlisle on a fairly large basis- It came first as an outgrowth of the outing idea which placed so many boys and girls in good country homes for vacation time prin- cipally. For some time numbers of small boys had been out serving as kitchen boys and waiters, but three or four years ago names of 3 number of manufacturing concerns were secured as possible places for outing pupils, the idea being that those who intended becoming artisans would spend their time most advantageously in shops.:- I ; TheKedMan » *» • r	'*> ► 293 <ii k’sar’T.iOrjif w» I jO^OEllk. .iilhii ..jittih.(iiHiii...iii1ii>.tiillii..<iiili[<..ii]lii. uiiDl..>'iiliii...iiiliiili.iiiliii. .>iiil!>i! |J|e summer of 1909 over a hundred Carlisle students were employed meteen different classes of work at wages ranging from $5 per n (with board and washing) up to $3 per day.

The opposition of labor unions, a very uncer- ^ quantity in many places, will act a trifle more strongly than in application of the same plan to white boys. .j, ne continuation school is beginning to make itself felt, too. hah '^ea	the older Indians through special agents is about by ** 3S e training school movement.

Space renders it inad" visable to take up the matter of native industries which are on the road to resurrection in some schools. That question, too, may °ot be regarded as wholly vocational, but partly esthetic at least. If we shall seek in conclusion for the largest and most definite lesson that comes from vocational training for the Indians, we sha find it to be a very old one slightly rephrased: “Eternal vigilance >s the price of success.” The Indian educators have constantly had * clear-cut idea of the product they wanted to turn out and have kept constantly atit, checkingup their results as often as might be. N°n' reservation schools are certainly not above secondary grade, rather below it, yet they have practically complete records of all former pupils. Now let us see, on the other hand, how it is with the average, no the exceptional, American secondary school. Usually teachers ha'’e no more than the most casual knowledge of the manner in which the* pupils spend vacation. Many who could be provided with place remain idle all summer, a fact that ought deeply to concern the schoo - others have places and fail, but the teacher never finds it °ut' Yet on all sides there is much talk of correlation and education f°r efficiency. Outing in shops on the cooperative basis,or on the farfl,s is possible in every locality, and it is exactly the means to discove the respects in which the school work is inefficient or improper') correlated. Farmers, business men, and manufacturers pick hundreds of boys and girls for the vacation, and often without an) wide information as to their capacity. They would welcome the data which the school administration could give in that line, and the latter could gather a fund of useful knowledge at the end of eac vacation as to just what the strong and weak points of the school ar • When the school realizes in full its opportunities for community service, it will spend as active a summer as Carlisle does. It 'V1 help to locate its pupils advantageously for the summer, it will f° low them up through vacation and in their subsequent careers- Their successes and failures, their own opinions and those of their employers, will be a constant and influential factor in shaping the curriculum and methods of the school.A- Legend of Mount Shasta: By Domitilla. tOUSANDS upon thousands snows ago (Indians in the cold regions reckoned by snow as others did by moons) Great Spirit, wishing a home on earth where he could retire for rest and seclusion, made Mt. Shasta. With a large stone he bored a hole in the sky and through it forced snow and ice until they rrr>ed a pile of sufficient height. Then he stepped from cloud to 0ud down to the summit and from that to the earth. , The earth was a silent, bare, and cheerless wilderness with not a ac»e of grass or even a vestige of green woods to cover the great ^retch of rough, sun-baked mounds of clay. This world-waste ®at Spirit made a land of beauty, filled with trees and flowers . ’c*1 sprang into immediate maturity wherever he placed his finger J1 the ground. The snow and ice, melted by the sun’s rays, ran t,Wn ^e mountain in streams; the streams broadened into rivers at enriched the plains and strengthened the growth of living ver- dure. k Great Spirit gathered the leaves as they fell from the trees, bathed on them, and they became birds. Fishes and animals were j rnied from a large stick, the fishes from the small end, the animals 0tl1 the middle, but the Grizzly was made last from the club end. Now the Grizzly was not the bear as vve know it to-day, but a ature resembling man, handsome and intelligent, though with and spirit undeveloped. As soon as created it sprang into latitudes that applied themselves at once to hunting and Ing for a living. Soon they separated into bands and spread °Ver the earth. Only one tribe remained at Mt. Shasta. These grew so huge, strong, and sly, that their efforts to over- ^°ttie Great Spirit were sometimes almost successful. In wondering |Car °f the ungrateful creatures he had called into existence, he at st retired into the heart of Mt. Shasta through an opening near e base which he immediately walled up. His wigwam, supported y heavy poles slanted to a point that reached the top of the °untain, filled the interior. . , he hearth fire around which the Spirit family gathered was laid ,r> the centre on the ground. Whole trees were burned at a and piles of them stacked around the sides of the wigwam gave Ssurance that the fires would never die out.

The hearth fires went out ages ago when another race entered the land and drove the Indian from his inheritance into hardship and privation. Many snows after the entrance of Great Spirit into the moun- tain, the Spirit of Evil, ever watchful to cause grief and suffering) brought about a late, hard springtime, with great gales, and storms blowing up from the sea that shook Mt. Shasta to its very base- In the midst of the wildest tempest Great Spirit sent up his infa"1 daughter, just walking around, with a command to the Wind Spirlt to cease. He bade her not to put her head above the summit but only to raise her tiny red arm as a sign before delivering the mes- sage. With haste she fulfilled her errand; with haste she turned to de- scend, but with childlike curiosity paused on tiptoe for one 1°°^ at that great forbidden world, with all its glories of rivers, the dis- tant ocean restlessly moving in great white-capped billows, the sky and clouds, all the strange sights not to be seen in her rock-walled home. In that hurried look, her long hair floated out, was caught by the fierce, whirling blast, and the little body lifted high, then blown down the mountain side, over deep snow and sharp ice into the land of the Grizzlies. At the foot of the mountain dwelt the chief of the Grizzlies with his wife and family of powerful sons. He was just returning frotf1 the hunt, an elk over his shoulder, a club in his hand, when this queer little waif rolled across his path. In alarm and awe he gazed on her shivering body wrapped about in her long, dark, tangled hair, and into the great black eyes regarding him so solemnly and appeal' ingly. She looked so pathetic and forlorn that, casting aside the burden of the chase he raised her tenderly and carried her to his wife, all alarm quieted in the pity he felt. The queen with a thrill of pride and joy opened her arms f°r the precious gift and nourished it at her breast. At once she knew it was the child of Great Spirit, but kept her own counsel. As the child grew her love increased, and dread of losing it made her guard more .closely her secret. So with jealous watchfulness she reared her as her own, and for the little foundling’s sweet, winsome ways the children of the Grizzly chief loved her almost as well. In time the eldest son won her for his wife and a new race soont March J !,' TH Ei BEj DMAN ’" F 297 i jkJkJt.................A A A .A.

The Grizzlies regarded them with pride and awe and resolved to build a fitting home for the Spirit Mother and her off- Pring. Tfog scattered nations were collected and by their united rts a mountainous wigwam near that of Great Spirit was built and called little Mt. Shasta. The joy of the worshiping Grandmother in her wondrous family e°arne bitterness as age and feebleness overtook her. Conscience ^led aloud at the wrong done Great Spirit. When she felt the end awing near she called the Grizzlies about her, told them who their revered young queen really was, and sent her eldest grandson up Sreat Mt. Shasta to the house of Great Spirit with tiding that his daughter still lived. . °Verj°yed by the message, Great Spirit hastened down the south ® of the mountain with such speed, that the swiftness of his pace ed the deep snow here and there in places where his feet touched, n the course of his flight can be seen to this day. The Grizzlies, ^ Bering thousands, stood in two files to receive him at the en- ^ ce to the wigwam, their clubs under their arms to indicate °n°rable welcome to the Great Master, k vvithout a sign to them, he strode into the interior, eager to em- th3C? h‘s l°ng lost daughter whom he had never pictured save as child caught by the cruel Wind Spirit so many snows ago. ut when he saw the beautiful young mother surrounded by her ®r°us children and learned that he had been betrayed into the a ion of a new race, his anger knew no bounds.

The forces that are now making for Indian betterment must needs be continued, strengthened, and made more efficient. EdU' cation must be extended, made more practical and intensified t0 meet the needs of the Indian; suppression of the liquor traffic must continue unabated; the health of the Indian must be conserved a°d an affective campaign against disease introduced; allotments must be made with care and discretion, and unnecessary leasing, whi^1 promotes idleness, discouraged; the gospel of hardwork and fru* gality should be taught; Christian work should be encouraged by fair dealing and equal opportunity to all; finally, waste of every kind and duplication of effort in the Service should be eliminated, and efficiency tempered by real sympathy should prevail. In all this our purpose should be, not to make a poor imitation of the white man out of the Indian, but a better Indian, conserving and developing those contributions which he has brought to us, whic*1 are distinctively Indian, in his talents and noble character. Nor should we allow anything to prevent the hastening of the time when the Indian, like the pale face, shall be free. How necessary, there' fore, it is for us to know at an early date where the Indians stand, both from a legal standpoint, as well as in the matter of property- We owe it to these people, and the Indian has a right to demand that we make a businesslike and thorough accounting of his money and property. As a Nation, we can guide and protect him, but in the end the Indian will have to work out his own salvation.

CARLISLE SOLVING INDIAN PROBLEM M FRIEDMAN, superintend- •	ent of the Carlisle Indian School, has issued his annual report. It shows a large increase in enrollment, the effectiveness of the vocational edu- cational system, extensive improve- ments to the entire school plant, the introduction of lessons in personal hygi- ene and moral training and the success of the "OutingSystem,” introduced in- to the Indian Service a few years ago. The value of the products and the work done in the various industries of the school reached a total of $101,141.40. “With the opening of the Carlisle School,” says Mr. Friedman, ‘‘our na- tion adopted a saner method of solving the Indian problem. The soldier was replaced by the school teacher, and the forts were either abandoned or utilized for school houses and agency purposes. The guiding motive in the estblishment of the Carlisle School was to train the Indian youth of both sexes to take upon themselves the duties, as well as the re- sponsibilities, of citizenship. This has been done by imparting a thorough edu- cation in the elements of knowledge, by useful training in some practical voca- tion, and by placing the Indian young men and young women in the houses of the best white people of this and public speaking, art, nature study, and business practice. The second has beenj.iijltr ^nyry’^y»y'M||ywy'nqp . . •^pr^r^ninsK TheEedMan - Liliu .•lllllb..ilil]|ti,iililllii.iltiSl|. iilll||i..«llll|,.,;ll||| jiil»I.^rllilli1.wl|l[]I.jllll||. . ..alllm 'jkXS^ March 1 done most successfully by giving in- struction in twenty trades of a most prac- tical character, and in the cultivation and training afforded on the farm through the operation of the Outing System, by means of which Indians ob- tain the training in civilization by living and practicing civilization, and be- coming acquainted with the difficulties of competition by actually having a taste of such competition in the various vo- cations and trades, while under the jurisdiction of the school. "The Carlisle School, besides the immediate work of education, has per- formed an extensive service for the Indian by educating the American public to the desirability of instituting rational measures for Indian better- ment. When the school was first established the public attitude was re- flected in the oft-repeated slander that ‘the only good Indian is the dead In- dian.’ This has given way to a mani- festation of sympathetic interest in the Indian on the part of the public. The country has come to recognize that the Indian is essentially a valuable member of American society when he is properly trained and educated.” Everywhere throughout the nation the Carlisle gaduates and returned stu- dents are at work, living right, at peace with their neighbors, patriotic in their citizenship. Out of a total of 639 gradu- ates, only five are not actively engaged in some useful occupation. With more than 4000 returned students, 94 per cent are self-supporting and self-re- specting. with good families, good homes, and money in the bank. One of the important services ren- dered by the school, says the rep® * has been to stir up the Indians in own behalf. No one understands Indian better than an Indian. ^ properly trained they are good work* loyal, faithful and honest. The Indi*® Service needs more of them.

The total amount of ea*^ ings was $29,021.49, of which 1 * students saved $16,449.28, and expen ed $12,572.21. Records at the scho®’ show that between 1890 and the end ® the fiscal year ending June 30, 1912.1 e students earned $521,178.42. Another important feature of 1 past year’s work has been the inaugu ration of a course in moral training social hygiene, aside from the pu^ religious training and moral instructi®" in the classroom. “One of the most neclected *u jects. not only in Indian schools, but1 public schools everywhere, ” says Super intendent Friedman, “is instruction |fl sex hygiene for boys and girls. In ®u complex industrial life the need this training is becoming more press'” and evident to both parents and scho® officials.”piCPAXahTia nr ..

According to the report, there are '8 tribes of Indians represented at the school, a total of 1,031 students being *nrolled, with 614 boys and 417 girls. Philadelphia Public Ledger. INDIANS AS FARMERS T^HA r Indian youths can be made "*• very efficient farmers is proved hy the facts submitted in the annual report of Superintendent Friedman, of the Indian School at Carlisle. This ichool has two farms on which the *cience of agriculture is taught practi- Cal,y and thoroughly. Recognizing that almost all the In- ^jan students own farm lands in the est through tribe allotments on the part of the Government, the head of the Carlisle School has felt it incum- bent on him to see that they obtain a comprehensive training, not in loose general farming in the old sense of the term, but in the best methods of in- tensive modern farming. The effect of the application of thi* idea is shown in the astonishing ac- complishments of the Indian student* on the two farms during the past year. The value of the products raised in that time amounted to $9,640.35, while, the cost of production was $2,642.80, leaving a net profit of $6,987.55. neighboring States, and training them in the habits and arts of civilization through immediate contact. "The first has been accomplished by means of a carefully graded academic department, of grammar grade, which is supplemented by instruction in music If the ‘‘little red school house” would in some small degree at least follow the example of the Carlisle School the State of Pennsylvania would soon have a set of the most efficient young farmers in the United States. More attention should be given in our rural public schools to the science of farming. It is an occupation the country boy could be taught to view from a new standpoint, and from an angle that would be pleasing and in- teresting to him. He needs to be lifted out of the rut of habitual belief in old- time methods which have bred in him a dislike, if not a contempt, for farming as a life vocation. If his father has been a failure as a farmer through lack of enterprise which kept him plodding on in the ways of his forbears, also.rA-iraiJHi 310 tiWjesrjA m? ■’iiuii'ii1ii'nir"iiiiii.....qpnqp myii ^ >mn *n< v'^ijrcsk*- ' TheBedMan “ ■ ^■iiiiu-.iiiiti. ..iiiiiii.^iitii ..iiiiii< ^iiAu..i-ii]iii...iiiniit..(iiiik—.>iii!!i!

It is not difficult to frame an indict- ment against the educational system of our State here. There is no more useful direction to which the Penn- sylvania Agricultural Association could turn its attention and exercise its en- deavors than this, and the present ses- sion of the Legislature is its oppor- tunity.—Philadelphia Telegraph. CARLISLE’S MAKING OF CITIZENS.. TH E record for the past four years of the Carlisle Indian School, conducted by the Government in be- half of the red man, goes far to con- tradict the theory that an Indian school away from the environment of the In- dian of the West cannot be successful in the East. The actual accomplish- ment proves the institution a sterling addition to the other forces of good citizenship. The school is rapidly placing the Indian on a basis where he can compete with the white man. In the matter of growth, in 1893 only 176 new students entered the school, while during the year 1912, just closed, 375 new students were en- rolled. Everywhere throughout the nation the Carlisle graduates and returned students are at work, at peace with their neighbors, patriotic in their citi- zenship. Out of a total of 639 grad- uates, only five are not actively en- gaged in some useful occuP®0 With more than 4,000 returned dents, the most careful iecoT^\ ^ tained from individuals, supp°rte agents and superintendents of the i sP® ervations to which they belong, > that 94 per cent are self-supportin8 self-respecting, with good *an^ . good homes, and money in the In the Indian country, where . ments have been extensively m ^ the reservations opened up to s ment, educated Indians have a P j nent voice in the affairs of lo4** g State government, and in the elect'0"’ recently held Carlisle graduates returned students were in many lart* elec- in communities where there was a preponderance of the white vote, ted to prominent offices. ln°neLtej one of Carlisle’s graduates was e^et’l|,e State attorney in a county where ^ white people numbered ten for e one Indian.

A prince’s banner Wavered, then staggered backward, hemmed by foes. A craven hung along the battle’s edge And thought, “Had I a sword of keener steel— The blue blade that the king’s son bears— but this Blunt thing!” he snapped and flung it from his hand, And lowering crept away and left the field. Then came the king’s son—wounded, sore bestead And weaponless—and saw the broken sword, Hilt buried in the dry and trodden sand, And ran and snatched it, and with battle shout lifted afresh he hewed the enemy down, And saved a great cause that heroic day. ►J * rr!
