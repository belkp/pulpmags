Each issue will be devoted exclusively to one individual, thereby giving him an opportunity to present his work in sufficient bulk tomake it possible for the reader to obtain a muchmore comprehensive grasp of his personality thanis afforded him in the restricted spaces allotted bythe other magazines. Published monthly, THEGLEBE will issue twelve books per year, chosenon their merits alone, since the subscription listdoes away with the need of catering to the populardemand that confronts every publisher. Thus,THE GLEBE can promise the best work of American and foreign authors, known and unknown.The price of each issue of THE GLEBE will befifty cents and the yearly subscription three dollars. ERDGEIST LULU BY FRANK WEDEKIND ERDGEIST (EARTH-SPIRIT) $l.OOPANDORA'S BOX (IN PREPARATION) ERDGEIST(Earth-Spirit)A Tragedy in Four Acts BYFRANK WEDEKIND Translated by Samuel A. Eliot, Jr. "I was created out of ranker stuffBy Nature, and to the earth by Lust am drawn.Unto the spirit of evil, not of good,The earth belongs. What deities send to usFrom heaven are only universal goods;Their light gives gladness, but makes no man rich;And in their state possession not obtains.Therefore, the stone of price, all-treasured gold,Must from the powers of falsehood be enticed,The evil race that dwells beneath the day.Not without sacrifice their favor is gained,And no man liveth who from serving themHath extricated undefiled his soul." CHARACTERS DR. SCHON, newspaper owner and editor.ALVA, his son, a writer.DR. GOLL, M.D.SCHWARZ, an artist.PRINCE ESCERNY, an African explorer.ESCHERICH, a reporter.SCHIGOLCH, a beggar.RODRIGO, an acrobat.HUGENBERG, a schoolboy ( a girl.)FERDINAND, a coachman.LULU.COUNTESS GESCHWITZ.HENRIETTE, a servant. PROLOGUE {At rise, is seen the entrance to a tent, out of whichsteps an animal-tamer, with long, black curls, dressedin a white cravat, a vermilion dress-coat, white trowsersand white top-boots. He carries in his hand a dog- whip and in his right a loaded revolver, and enters to thesound of cymbals and kettle-drums.)Walk in! Walk in to the menagery,Proud gentlemen and ladies lively and merry!With avid lust or cold disgust, the veryBeast without Soul bound and made secondaryTo human genius, to stay and see!Walk in, the show'll begin!—As customary,One child to each two persons comes in free.Here battle man and brute in narrow cagesWhere one in haught disdain his long whip lashesAnd one, with growls as when the thunder rages,Against the man's throat murderously dashes,—Where now the crafty conquers, now the strong,Now man, now beast, lies cowed the floor along;The animal rears,—the human on all fours!One ice-cold look of dominance—The beast submissive bows before that glance,And the proud heel upon his neck adores.Bad are the times! Ladies and gentlemenWho once before my cage in thronging crescentsCrowded, now honor operas, and thenIbsen, with their so highly valued presence. My boarders here are so in want of fodderThat they reciprocally devour each other.How well off at the theater is a player,Sure of the meat upon his ribs, albeitHis frightful hunger may tear him and he itAnd colleagues' inner cupboards be quite bare!—Greatness in art we struggle to inherit,Although the salary never match the merit.What see you, whether in light or sombre plays?House-animals, whose morals all must praise,Who wreak pale spites in vegetarian ways,And revel in an easy cry or fret,Just like those others—down in the parquet.This hero has a head by one dram swirled;That is in doubt whether his love be right;A third you hear despairing of the world,—Full five acts long you hear him wail his plight,And no man ends him with a merciful sleight!But the real beast, the beautiful, wild beast,Your eyes on that, /, ladies, only feast!You see the Tiger, that habituallyDevours whatever falls before his bound;The Bear, so ravenous originally,Who at a late night-meal sinks dead to ground;You see the Monkey, little and amusing,From sheer ennui his petty powers abusing,—He has some talent, of all greatness scant,So, impudently, coquettes with his own want!Upon my soul, within my tent's a mammal,See, right behind the curtain, here,—a Camel!And all my creatures fawn about my feet When my revolver cracks—(He shoots into the .)Behold!Brutes tremble all around me. I am cold:The man stays cold,—you, with respect, to greet.Walk in!— You hardly trust yourselves in here?—Then very well, judge for yourselves! Each sphereHas sent its crawling creatures to your telling:Chameleons and serpents, crocodiles,Dragons, and salamanders chasm-dwelling,—I know, of course, you're full of quiet smilesAnd don't believe a syllable I say.—(He lifts the entrance-flap and calls into the tent.)Hi, Charlie!—bring our Serpent just this way!•(A stage-hand with a big paunch carries out the actressof L u I u in her Pierrot costume, and sets her down beforethe animal-tamer.)She was created to incite to sin,To lure, seduce, poison—yea, murder, inA manner no man knows.—My pretty beast,(Tickling Lulus chin.)Only be unaffected, and not piecedOut with distorted, artificial folly,Even if the critics praise thee for 't less wholly.Thou hast no right to spoil the shape most fitting,Most true, of woman, with meows and spitting!And mind, all foolery and making facesThe childish simpleness of Vice disgraces.Thou shouldst—to-day I speak emphatically—Speak naturally and not unnaturally, For the first principle in every art,Since earliest times, was True and Plain, not Smart!{To the public.)There's nothing special now to see in her,But wait and watch what later will occur!Her strength about the Tiger she coils stricter:He roars and groans!— Who'll be the final victor?—Hop, Charlie, march! Carry her to her place,(The stage-hand carries Lulu in his arms; the animal- tamer pats her on the hips.)Sweet innocence—my dearest treasure-case!{The stage-hand carries Lulu back into the tent.)And now I'll tell the best thing in the day:My poll between the teeth of a beast of prey!Walk in! Tho to be sure the show's not new,Yet everyone takes pleasure in its view!Wrench open this wild animal's jaws I dare,And he to bite dares not! My pate's so fair,So wild, so gaily decked, it wins respect!I offer it him with confidence unchecked.One joke, and my two temples crack!—but, 10,The lightning of my eyes I will forego,Staking my life against a joke! and throwMy whip, my weapons, down. I am in my skin!I yield me to this beast!— His name do ye know?—The honored public! that has just walked in!{The animal-tamer steps back into the tent, accompaniedby cymbals and kettledrums.) ACT I A roomy studio. Entrance door at the rear,Another door at lower left to the bed-room. At centre,a platforjn for the model, w a Spanish screen behindit and a Smyrna rug in front. Two easels at lowerright. On the upper one is the picture of a young girl'shead and shoulders. Against the other leans a reversedcanvas. Below these, toward centre, an ottoman, with atiger-skin on it. Two chairs along the left wall. In theback-ground, right, a step-ladder.Schonsits on the foot of the ottoman, inspecting crit- ically the picture on the further easel. standsbehind the ottoman, his palette and brushes in his hands.SCHON. Do you know, I'm getting acquainted with abrand new side of the lady.SCHWARZ. I have never painted anyone whose expres- sion changed so continuously. I could hardly keep asingle feature the same two days running.SCHON. ( Pointing to the picture and observing him.)Do you find that in it?SCHWARZ. I have done everything imaginable to callforth some sort of quiet in her mood by my conversationduring the sittings.SCHON. Then I understand the difference. (dips his brush in the oil and draws it over the featuresof the face.) Do you think that makes it look more likeher?SCHWARZ. We can only work with art as scientificallyas possible.SCHON. Tell me— SCHWARZ. (Stepping back.) The color had sunk inpretty well, too.SCHON. ( Looking at him.) Have you ever loved awoman in your life?SCHWARZ. ( Goes to the easel, puts a color on it, andsteps back on the other side.) The dress isn't made tostand out enough yet. We don't see the living body underit.SCHON. I make no doubt that the workmanship isgood.SCHWARZ. If you'll step this way. . . .SCHON. (Rising.) You must have told her regularghost-stories.SCHWARZ. As far back as you can.SCHON. (Stepping back, knocks down the canvas thatwas leaning against the lower easel.) Excuse me—SCHWARZ. (Picking it up.) That's all right.SCHON. (Surprised.) What is that?SCHWARZ. Do you know her?SCHON. No. (Schwarz sets the picture on the easel.It is of a lady dressed as Pierrot with a long shepherd'scrook in her hand.)SCHWARZ. A costume-picture.SCHON. But, really, you've succeeded with her.SCHWARZ. You know her?SCHON. No. And in that costume—?SCHWARZ. It isn't nearly finished yet. (Schon nods.)What would you have? While she is posing for me Ihave the pleasure of entertaining her husband.SCHON. What?SCHWARZ. We talk about art, of course,—to completemy good fortune! SCHON. But how did you make such a charming ac- quaintance ?SCHWARZ. As they're generally made. An ancient,tottering little man drops in on me here to know if Ican paint his wife. Why, of course, were she as wrinkledas Mother Earth! Next day at ten prompt the doors flyopen, and the fat-belly drives this little beauty in beforehim. I can feel even now how my knees shook. Thencomes a sap-green lackey, stiff as a ramrod, with a pack- age under his arm. Where is the dressing-room? Im- agine my plight. I open the door there (pointing left).Just luck that everything was in order. The sweet thingvanishes into it, and the old fellow posts himself outsideas a bastion. Two minutes later out she steps in thisPierrot. (Shaking his head.) I never saw anything likeit. {He goes left and stares in at the bedroom.)SCHON. {Who has followed him with his eyes.)And the fat-belly stands guard?SCHWARZ. {Turning round.) The whole body inharmony with that impossible costume as if it had comeinto the world in it! Her way of burying her elbowsin her pockets, of lifting her little feet from the rug,—the blood often shoots to my head. . . .SCHON. One can see that in the picture.SCHWARZ. {Shaking his head.) People like us, youknow—SCHON. Here the model is mistress of the conversation.SCHWARZ. She has never yet opened her mouth.SCHON. Is it possible?SCHWARZ. Allow me to show the costume to you.{Goes out left.)SCHON. {Before the Pierrot.) A devilish beauty.{Before the other picture.) There's more depth here. ( Coming down stage.) He is still rather young for hisage. (Schwarz comes back with a white satin costume.)SCHWARZ. What sort of material is that?SCHON. ( Feeling it.) Satin.SCHWARZ. And all in one piece.SCHON. How does one get into it then?SCHWARZ. That I can't tell you.SCHON. ( Taking the costume by the legs.) Whatenormous trowser-legs!SCHWARZ. The left one she pulls up.SCHON. ( Looking at the picture.) Above the knee!SCHWARZ. She does that entrancingly!SCHON. And transparent stockings?SCHWARZ. Those have got to be painted, specially.SCHON. Oh, you can do that.SCHWARZ. And with it all a coquetry!SCHON. What brought you to that horrible suspicion?SCHWARZ. There are things that our school-philos- ophy lets itself never dream of. {He takes the costumeback into his bedroom.)SCHON. {Alone.) When we sleep. .. .SCHWARZ. {Comes back; looks at his watch.) Ifyou wish to make her acquaintance too—SCHON. No.SCHWARZ. They must be here in a moment.SCHON. How much longer will the lady have to sit?SCHWARZ. I shall probably have to bear the pains ofTantalus three months longer.SCHON. I mean the other one.SCHWARZ. I beg your pardon. Three times more atmost. {Going to the door with him.) If the lady willjust leave me the upper part of the dress then. . . .SCHON. With pleasure. Let us see you at my house again soon. For Heaven's sake! (As he collides in thedoor-way with Dr. Goll and Lulu.)SCHWARZ. May I introduce . . .DR. GOLL. (To Schon.) What are you doing here?LULU. (As Schon kisses her hand in greeting.)You're not going already?DR. GOLL. But what wind blows you here ?SCHON. I've been looking at the picture of my bride.LULU. (Coming forward.) Your bride is here?DR. GOLL. So you're having work done here, too?LULU. (Before the upper picture.) Look at it! En- chanting ! Entrancing!DR. GOLL. (Looking round him.) Have you gother hidden somewhere round here?LULU. So that is the sweet young prodigy who's madea new person out of you. . . .SCHON. She sits in the afternoon mostly.DR. GOLL. And you don't tell anyone about it?LULU. (Turning round.) Is she really so solemn?SCHON. Probably the after-effects of the seminary still,dear lady.DR. GOLL. (Before the picture.) One can see that youhave been transformed profoundly.LULU. But now you mustn't let her wait any longer.SCHON. In a fortnight I think the engagement willcome out.DR. GOLL. (To Lulu.) Let's lose no time. Hop!LULU. (To Schon.) Just think, we came at a trotover the new bridge. I was driving, myself.DR. GOLL. (As Schon prepares to leave.) No, no.We two will talk some more later. Get along, Nellie.Hop!LULU. Now you're going to talk about me! DR. GOLL. Our Apelles is already wiping his brushes.LULU. I had imagined it would be much more amus- ing.SCHON. But you have always the satisfaction of pre- paring for us the greatest and rarest pleasure.LULU. {Going left.) Oh, just wait!SCHWARZ. {Before the bedroom door.) If madamewill be so kind. .. . {Shuts the door after her andstands in front of it.)DR. GOLL. I christened her Nellie, you know, in ourmarriage-contract.SCHON. Did you?— Yes.DR. GOLL. What do you think of it?SCHON. Why not call her rather Mignon?DR. GOLL. That would have been good, too. I didn'tthink of that.SCHON. Do you consider the name so important?DR. GOLL. Hm. ... You know, I have no children.SCHON. But you've only been married a couple ofmonths.DR. GOLL. Thanks, I don't want any.SCHON. {Having taken out his cigarette-case.) Havea cigarette?DR. GOLL. {Helps himself.) I've plenty to do withthis one. {To Schwarz.) Say, what's your little dan- seuse doing now?SCHON. {Turning round on You and adanseuse ?SCHWARZ. The lady was sitting for me at that timeonly as a favor. I made her acquaintance on a flyingtrip of the Cecilia Society.DR. GOLL. {To Schon.) Hm. ... I think we'regetting a change of weather. SCHON. The toilet isn't going so quickly, is it?DR. GOLL. It's going like lightning! Woman has gotto be a virtuoso in her job. So must we all, each inhis job, if life isn't to turn to beggary. (Calls.) Hop,Nellie!LULU. (Inside.) Just a second!DR. GOLL. (To Schon.) I can't get onto these block- heads. (Referring to Schwarz.)SCHON. I can't help envying them. These block- heads know nothing holier than an altar-cloth, and feelricher than you and me with 30,000-mark incomes. Be- sides, you can't be judge of a man who from childhoodhas lived from palette to mouth. Try to get at hisfinances: it's an arithmetic example! I haven't the moralcourage, and one can easily burn one's fingers at it, too.LULU. (As Pierrot,steps out of the bed-room.)Here I am!SCHON. (Turns; after a pause.) Superb!LULU. (Nearer.) Well?SCHON. You put shame on the boldest fancy.LULU. How do you like me?SCHON. A picture before which art must despair.DR. GOLL. Don't you think so, too?SCHON. (To Lulu.) Have you any notion what youdo?LULU. I'm perfectly possessed of myself!SCHON. Then you might be a little more discreet.LULU. But I'm only doing what's my duty.SCHON. You are powdered?LULU. What do you take me for!DR. GOLL. I've never seen such a white skin as she'sgot. I've told our Raphael here, too, to do just as little with the flesh tints as possible. For once, I can't getenthusiastic about the modern art-nonsense.SCHWARZ. (By the easels, preparing his paints.) Atany rate, it's thanks to impressionism that present-day artcan stand up beside the old masters without blushing.DR. GOLL. Oh, it can do quite well for a bit of butcher'swork.SCHON. For Heaven's sake don't get excited! (falls on Goll's neck and kisses him.)DR. GOLL. They can see your undershirt. You mustpull it lower.LULU. I would soonest have left it off. It only both- ers me.DR. GOLL. He should be able to paint it out.LULU. (Taking the shepherd's crook that leansagainst the Spanish screen, and mounting the platform,to Schon.) What would you say now, if you had tostand at attention for two hours?SCHON. I'd sell my soul to the devil for the chanceto exchange with you.DR. GOLL. (Sitting, left.) Come over here. Here ismy post of observation.LULU. (Plucking her left trowser-leg up to the knee,to Schwarz.) So?SCHWARZ. Yes. . . .LULU. (Plucking it a thought higher.) So?SCHWARZ. Yes, yes. . . .DR. GOLL. (To Schon who has seated himself on thechair next him, with a gesture.) From this place I findher still more attractive.LULU. (Without stirring.) I beg pardon! I amequally attractive on all sides. SCHWARZ. (To Lulu.) The right knee further for- ward, please.SCHON. (With a gesture.) The body does show finerlines perhaps.SCHWARZ. The light to-day can be borne at least halfway.DR. GOLL. Oh, you must throw on lots of it! Holdyour brush a bit longer.SCHWARZ. Certainly, Dr. Goll.DR. GOLL. Treat her as a piece of still-life.SCHWARZ. Certainly, Doctor. (To Lulu.) Youused to hold your head a wee mite higher, Mrs. Goll.LULU. (Raising her head.) Paint my lips a littleopen.SCHON. Paint snow on ice. If you get warm doingthat, then instantly your art gets inartistic!SCHWARZ. Certainly, Doctor.DR. GOLL. Art, you know, must so reproduce naturethat one can find at least some spiritual enjoymentin it!LULU. (Opening her mouth a little, to Schwarz.)So—look. I'll hold it half opened, so.SCHWARZ. As soon as the sun comes, the wall oppositethrows warm reflections in here.DR. GOLL. (To Lulu.) You must keep your positionjust as if our Velasquez here didn't exist at all.LULU. Well, a painter isn'T a man at all, anyway.SCHON. I don't think you ought to judge the wholeprofession by just one famous exception.SCHWARZ. (Stepping back from the easel.) I shouldhave liked to have had to hire a different studio lastfall.SCHON. (To Goll.) What I wanted to ask you— have you seen the little Murphy girl yet as a Peruvianpearl-fisher ?DR. GOLL. I see her to-morrow for the fourth time.Prince Polossov took me. His hair has already got darkyellow again with delight.SCHON. So you find her quite fabulous too.DR. GOLL. Who ever wants to judge of that before- hand?LULU. I think someone knocked.SCHWARZ. Pardon me a moment. ( opensthe door.)DR. GOLL. (To Lulu.) You can safely smile at himwith less bashfulness!SCHON. He makes nothing of it.DR. GOLL. And if he did!— What are we two sittinghere for?ALVA SCHON. (Entering, still behind the Spanishscreen.) May one come in?SCHON. My son!LULU. Oh! It's Mr. Alva!DR. GOLL. Don't mind. Just come along in.ALVA. ( Stepping forward, shakes hands with Schonand Goll.) Glad to see you. (Turning toward Lulu.)Do I see a-right? Oh, if only I could engage you formy title part!LULU. I don't think I could dance nearly well enoughfor your show!ALVA. But you do have a dancing-master such as cannotbe found on any stage in Europe.SCHON. But what brings you here?DR. GOLL. Maybe you're having somebody or otherpainted here, too, in secret! ALVA. (To Schon.)l wanted to take you to thedress rehearsal.DR. GOLL. (As Schon rises.) Do you have 'em danceto-day in full costume?ALVA. Of course. Come along, too. In five minutesI must be on the stage. (To Lulu.) Unhappy!DR. GOLL. I've forgotten—what's the name of yourballet ?ALVA. Dalailama.DR. GOLL. I thought he was in a madhouse.SCHON. You're thinking of Nietzsche, Doctor.DR. GOLL. You're right; I got 'em mixed up.ALVA. I have helped Buddhism to its legs.DR. GOLL. By his legs is the stage-poet known.ALVA. Corticelli dances the youthful Buddha as thoshe had seen the light of the world by the Ganges.SCHON. So long as her mother lived, she danced withher legs.ALVA. Then when she got free she danced with herintelligence.DR. GOLL. Now she dances with her heart.ALVA. If you'd like to see her—?DR. GOLL. Thank you.ALVA. Come along with us!DR. GOLL. Impossible.SCHON. Anyway, we have no time to lose.ALVA. Come with us, doctor. In the third act yousee Dalailama in his cloister, with his monks—DR. GOLL. The only thing I care about is the youngBuddha.ALVA. Well, what's hindering you?DR. GOLL. I can't. I can't do it. ALVA. We're going to Peter's, after it. There youcan express your admiration.DR. GOLL. Don't press it on me, please.ALVA. You'll see the tame monkey, the two Brahmans,the little girls. . . .DR. GOLL. For heaven's sake, just keep away fromme with your little girls!LULU. Reserve one of the proscenium boxes for uson Monday, Mr. Alva.ALVA. How could you doubt that I would, dear lady!DR. GOLL. When I come back the whole picture willbe spoilt on me.ALVA. Well, it could be painted over.DR. GOLL. If I don't explain to this Caravacci everystroke of his brush—SCHON. Your fears are unfounded, I think. . . .DR. GOLL. Next time, gentlemen!ALVA. The Brahmans are getting impatient. Thedaughters of Nirvana are shivering in their tights.DR. GOLL. Damned enchantment!SCHON. They'll quarrel with us, if we don't bringyou with us.DR. GOLL. In five minutes I'll be back. (right, behind Schwarz and compares the picture withLulu.)ALVA. (To Lulu.) Duty calls me, gracious lady!DR. GOLL. (To Schwarz.) You must model it a bitmore here. The hair is bad. You aren't paying enoughattention to your business!ALVA. Come on.DR. GOLL. Now, just hop it! Ten horses will notdrag me to Peter's. SCHON. {Following Alva and Goll.) We'll take mycarriage. It's waiting downstairs. {Exeunt.)SCHWARZ. {Leans over to the and spits.)Pack! If only that were life's end! The bread-basket!%—paunch and mug! Now rears my artist's pride. {Aftera look at Lulu.) This company!— {Gets up, goes upleft, observes Lulu from all sides, and sits again at hiseasel.) The choice would be a hard one to make. If Imay request Mrs. Goll to raise the right hand a littlehigher.LULU. {Grasps the crook as high as she can reach;to herself.) Who would have thought that was possible!SCHWARZ. I am quite ridiculous, you think?LULU. He's coming right back.SCHWARZ. I can do nothing but paint.LULU. There he is!SCHWARZ. {Rising.) Well?LULU. Don't you hear?SCHWARZ. Someone is coming. . . .LULU. I knew it.SCHWARZ. It's the janitor. He's sweeping the stairs.LULU. Thank heaven!SCHWARZ. Do you perhaps accompany the doctor tohis patients ?LULU. Everything BUT that.SCHWARZ. Because, you are not accustomed to beingalone.LULU. We have a housekeeper at home.SCHWARZ. She keeps you company?LULU. She has a lot of taste.SCHWARZ. What for?LULU. She dresses me.SCHWARZ. Do you go much to balls? LULU. Never.SCHWARZ. Then what do you need the dresses for ?LULU. For dancing.SCHWARZ. You really dance?LULU. Czardas . . . Samaqueca . . . Skirt-dance.SCHWARZ. Doesn't—that—disgust you, then?LULU. You find me ugly?SCHWARZ. You don't understand me. But who givesyou lessons then ?LULU. Him.SCHWARZ. Who ?LULU. Him.SCHWARZ. He ?LULU. He plays the violin—SCHWARZ. Every day one learns something new ofthe world!LULU. I learned in Paris. I took lessons from EugenieFougere. She let me copy her costumes, too.SCHWARZ. What are they like ?LULU. A little green lace skirt to the knee, all inruffles, low-necked, of course, very low-necked and awfullytight-laced. Bright green petticoat, then brighter andbrighter. Snow-white underclothes with a hand's-breadthof lace. ...SCHWARZ. I can no longer—LULU. Then paint!SCHWARZ. ( Scraping the .) Aren't you coldat all?LULU. God forbid! No. What made you ask ? Areyou so cold?SCHWARZ. Not to-day. No.LULU. Praise God, one can breathe!SCHWARZ. How so? . . . {Lulu takes a deep breath.) Don't do that, please! ( Spri throws away hispalette and brushes, walks up and down.) The boot- black only attends to her feet! His color doesn't eat intohis money, either. If I go without supper to-morrow, nolittle society lady will ask me if I know anything aboutoyster-patties!LULU. Is he going out of his head?SCHWARZ. ( Takes up his work again.) What everdrove the fellow to this test!LULU. I'd like it better, too, if he had stayed here.SCHWARZ. We are truly the martyrs of our calling!LULU. I didn't wish to cause you pain.SCHWARZ. (Hesitating, to Lulu.) If you—the lefttrowser-leg—a little higher—LULU. Here?SCHWARZ. (Steps to the platform.) Permit me. .. .LULU. What do you want?SCHWARZ. I'll show you.LULU. You mustn't.SCHWARZ. You are nervous . . . ( to seize herhand.)LULU. (Throws the crook in his face.) Let me alone!(Hurries to the entrance door.) You don't get me fora long time yet.SCHWARZ. You can't understand a joke.LULU. Oh, yes I can. I understand everything. Justyou leave me be. You'll get nothing at all from me byforce. Go to your work. You have no right to molestme. {Flees behind the ottoman.) Sit down behind youreasel!SCHWARZ. {Trying to get around the ottoman.) Assoon as I've punished you—you wayward, capricious—LULU. But you must have me, first! Go away. You can't catch me. In long clothes I'd have fallen into yourclutches long ago—but in the Pierrot!SCHWARZ. (Throwing himself across the ottoman.)I've got you!LULU. ( Hurls the tiger-skin over his head.) Good- night! ( Jumps over the platforjn and climbs up the step- ladder.) I can see away over all the cities of the earth.SCHWARZ. ( Unrolling himself from the rug.) Thisold skin!!LULU. I reach up into heaven, and stick the stars inmy hair.SCHWARZ. ( Clambering after her.) I'll shake it tillyou fall off!LULU. If you don't stop, I'll throw the ladder down.( Climbing higher.) Will you let go of my legs? Godsave the Poles! ( Makes the ladder fall over, jumps ontothe platform, and as Schwarz picks himself up from thefloor, throws the Spanish screen down on his head. Hasten- ing down-stage, by the easels.) I told you that youweren't going to get me.SCHWARZ. (Coming forward.) Let us make peace.(Tries to embrace her.)LULU. Keep away from me, or— (She throws theeasel with the finished picture at him, so that both fallcrashing to the floor.)SCHWARZ. (Screams.) Merciful Heaven!LULU. (Up-stage, right.) You knocked the hole init yourself!SCHWARZ. lam ruined! Ten weeks' work, my jour- ney, my exhibition! Now there is nothing more to lose!(Plunges after her.)LULU. (Springs over the ottoman, over the fallen step- ladder, and over the platform, down-stage.) A grave! Don't fall into it! ( stamps thru the picture on thefloor.) She made a new man out of him! (forward.)SCHWARZ. ( Stumbling over the Spanish screen.) Iam merciless now!LULU. (Up-stage.) Leave me in peace now. I'mgetting dizzy. O Gott! O Gott! .. . (Comes for- ward and sinks down on the ottoman. Schwarz locksthe door; then seats himself next her, grasps her hand,and covers it with kisses—then pauses, struggling withhimself. Lulu opens her eyes wide.)LULU. He may come back.SCHWARZ. How d' you feel ?LULU. As if I had fallen into the water. . . .SCHWARZ. I love you.LULU. One time, I loved a student.SCHWARZ. Nellie—LULU. With four-and-twenty scars—SCHWARZ. I love you, Nellie.LULU. My name isn't Nellie. (Schwarz kisses her.)It's Lulu.SCHWARZ. I would call you Eve.LULU. Do you know what time it is?SCHWARZ. (Looking at his watch.) Half past ten.( Lulu takes the watch and opens the case.) You don'tlove me.LULU. Yes I do. . . . It's five minutes after half pastten.SCHWARZ. Give me a kiss, Eve!LULU. ( Takes him by the chin and kisses him.Throws the watch in the air and catches it.) You smellof tobacco.SCHWARZ. Why so distant? LULU. It would be uncomfortable to—SCHWARZ. You're just making believe!LULU. You're making believe yourself, it seems tome. I make believe? What makes you think that? Inever needed to do that.SCHWARZ. (Risesj disconcertedpassing his hand overhis forhead.) God in Heaven! The world is strangeto me—!LULU. (Screams.) Only don't kill me!SCHWARZ. (Instantly whirling round.) Thouhast never yet loved!LULU. (Half raising herself.) You have neveryet loved... !DR. GOLL. (Outside.) Open the door!LULU. (Already sprung to her feet.) Hide me! OGod, hide me!DR. GOLL. (Pounding on the door.) Open the door!LULU. (Holding back Schwarz as he goes towardthe door.) He will strike me dead!DR. GOLL. (Hammering.) Open the door!LULU. (Sunk down before Schwarz, gripping hisknees.) He'll beat me to death! He'll beat me to death!SCHWARZ. Stand up. ... (The door falls crashinginto the studio. Dr. Goll with blood-shot eyes rushes uponSchwarz and Lulu, brandishing his stick.)DR. GOLL. You dogs! You .. . ! (Pants, strug- gles for breath a few seconds, and falls headlong to theground. Schwarz s knees tremble. Lulu has fled to thedoor. Pause.)SCHWARZ. Mister—Doctor—Doc—Doctor Goll—LULU. (In the door.) Please, though, first put thestudio in order.SCHWARZ. Dr. Goll! (Leans over.) Doc— (Steps back.) He's cut his forehead. Help me to lay him onthe ottoman.LULU. ( Shudders backward in terror.) No. No. . .SCHWARZ. ( Trying to turn him over.) Dr. Goll.LULU. He doesn't hear.SCHWARZ. But you, help me, please.LULU. The two of us together couldn't lift him.SCHWARZ. ( Straightening up.) We must send for adoctor.LULU. He is fearfully heavy.SCHWARZ. ( Getting his hat.) Please, though, be sogood as to put the place a little to rights while I'm away.(He goes out.)LULU. He'll spring up all at once. (Intensely.)Bussi! He just won't notice anything. ( down- stage in a wide circle.) He sees my feet, and watchesevery step I take. He has his eye on me everywhere.( Touches him with her toe.) Bussi! ( back- ward.) It's serious with him. The dance is over. He'llsend me to prison. What shall I do? (Leans over, tothe floor.) A strange, wild face! (Getting up.) Andno one to do him the last services—isn't that sad!( Schwarzreturns.)SCHWARZ. 'Still not come to himself?LULU. (Down right.) What shall I do?SCHWARZ. ( Bending over Goll.) Doctor Goll.LULU. I almost think it's serious.SCHWARZ. Talk decently!LULU. He wouldn't say that to me. He makes medance for him when he doesn't feel well.SCHWARZ. The doctor will be here in a moment.LULU. Doctoring won't help hi m. SCHWARZ. But people do what they can, in suchcases!LULU. He doesn't think so.SCHWARZ. Then won't you at least—get dressed?LULU. Yes,—right off.SCHWARZ. What are you waiting for?LULU. Please . . .SCHWARZ. What is it?LULU. Shut hi s eyes.SCHWARZ. You make me shiver.LULU. Not nearly so much as you make me!SCHWARZ. I ?LULU. You're a born criminal.SCHWARZ. Doesn't this moment touch you at all,then ?LULU. It hits me, too, some.SCHWARZ. Please, just you keep still now!LULU. It hits you some, too.SCHWARZ. You really didn't need to say that to aman, in such a moment.LULU. PLEASE . . .!SCHWARZ. Do what you think necessary. I don'tknow how.LULU. ( Left of Goll.) He's looking at me.SCHWARZ. (Right of Goll.) And at me, too.LULU. You're a coward!SCHWARZ. (Shuts Goil's eyes with his handkerchief.)It's the first time in my life that anyone has called methat.LULU. Didn't you do it to your mother?SCHWARZ. (Nervously.) No.LULU. You were away, perhaps.SCHWARZ. No! LULU. Or else you were afraid?SCHWARZ. ( Violently.) No!LULU. ( Shivering&gt;backward.) I didn't mean to in- sult you.SCHWARZ. She's still alive.LULU. Then you still have somebody.SCHWARZ. She's as poor as a beggar.LULU. I know what that is.SCHWARZ. Don't laugh at me!LULU. Now I am rich—SCHWARZ. It gives me cold shudders— ( right.)She can't help it!LULU. (To herself.) What'll I do?SCHWARZ. (To himself.) Absolutely depraved!(They look at each other mistrustfully. Schwarz goesover to her and grips her hand.) Look me in the eyes!LULU. (Apprehensively.) What do you want?SCHWARZ. (Takes her to the ottoman and makes hersit next to him.) Look me in the eyes.LULU. I see myself in them as Pierrot.SCHWARZ. (Shoves her from him.) Confoundeddancer-ing!LULU. I must change my clothes—SCHWARZ. (Holds her back.) One question—LULU. I can't answer it.SCHWARZ. Can you speak the truth?LULU. I don't know.SCHWARZ. Do you believe in a Creator?LULU. I don't know.SCHWARZ. Can you swear on anything?LULU. I don't know. Leave me alone. You're mad.SCHWARZ. What do you believe in, then?LULU. I don't know. SCHWARZ. Have you no soul, then?LULU. I don't know.SCHWARZ. Have you ever once loved—?LULU. I don't know.SCHWARZ. ( Gets up, goes right, to himself.) Shedoesn't know!LULU. ( Without moving.) I don't know.SCHWARZ. (Glancing at Goll.) He knows.LULU. (Nearer him.) What do you want to know?SCHWARZ. {Angrily.) Go, get dressed! {Lulugoes into the bed-room. To Goll.) Would I couldchange with you, you dead man! I give her back to you.I give my youth to you, too. I lack the courage and thefaith. I've had to wait patiently too long. It's too latefor me. I haven't grown up big enough for happiness.I have a hellish fear of it. Wake up! I didn't touchher. He opens his mouth. Mouth open and eyes shut,like the children. With me it's the other way round.Wake up, wake up! {Kneels down and binds his hand- kerchief round the dead mans head.) Here I beseechHeaven to make me able to be happy—to give me thestrength and the freedom of soul to be just a weeny mitehappy! For her sake, only for her sake.{Lulu comes out of the bed-room, completely dressed, herhat on, and her right hand under her left arm.)LULU. {Raising her left arm, to Schwarz.) Wouldyou hook me up here? My hand trembles. CURTAIN ACT II A very ornamental parlor. Entrance-door rear, left.Curtained entrances right and left, steps leading up to theright one. On the back wall over the fire-place, Lulu'spicture as Pierrot in a magnificent frame. Right, a tallmirror; a couch in front of it. Left, an ebony writing- table. Centre, a few chairs around a little Chinese table.Lulu stands motionless before the mirror, in a greensilk morning-dress. She frowns, passes a hand over herforehead, feels her cheeks, and draws back from the mirrorwith a discouraged, almost angry, look. Frequently turn- ing round, she goes left, opens a casket on the writing- table, lights herself a cigarette, looks for a book amongthose that are lying on the table, takes one, and lies downon the couch opposite the mirror. After reading a mo- ment, she lets the book sink, and nods seriously to herselfin the glass; then resumes reading. Schwarz enters, left,palette and brushes in hand, and bends over Lulu, kissesher on the forehead, and goes up the steps, right.SCHWARZ. (Turning in the door-way.) Eve!LULU. {Smiling.) At your orders?SCHWARZ. Seems to me you look extra charming to- day.LULU. {With a glance at the mirror.) Depends onwhat you expect.SCHWARZ. Your hair breathes out a morning fresh- ness. . . .LULU. I've just come out of the water.SCHWARZ. {Approaching her.) I've an awful lot todo to-day. LULU. That's what you say to yourself.SCHWARZ. ( Lays his palette and brushes down on thecarpet, and sits on the edge of the couch.) What areyou reading?LULU. {Reads.) "Suddenly she heard an anchor ofrefuge come nodding up the stairs."SCHWARZ. Who under the sun writes so absorbingly?LULU. {Reading.) "It was the postman with amoney-order." {Henriette, the servant, comes in, upperleft, with a hat-box on her arm and a little tray of letterswhich she puts on the table.)HENRIETTE. The mail. I'm going to take your hatto the milliner, madam. Anything else?LULU. No. {Schwarz signs to her to go out, whichshe does, slyly smiling.)SCHWARZ. What was it you dreamt all last night?LULU. You've asked me that twice already, to-day.SCHWARZ. {Rises, takes up the letters.) I tremblefor news. Every day I fear the world may go to pieces.{Giving Lulu a letter.) For you.LULU. {Sniffs at the paper.) Madame Corticelli.{Hides it in her bosom.)SCHWARZ. {Skimming a letter.) My Samaqueca- dancer sold—for fifty thousand marks!LULU. Who says that?SCHWARZ. Sedelmeier in Paris. That's the thirdpicture since our marriage. I hardly know how to savemyself from my luck!LULU. {Pointing to the letters.) There are morethere.SCHWARZ. {Opening an engagement announcement.)See. {Gives it to Lulu.)LULU. {Reads.) Sir Henry von Zarnikow has the honor to announce the engagement of his daughter, Char- lotte Marie Adelaide, to Doctor Ludwig Schon.SCHWARZ. {As he opens another letter.) At last!He's been an eternal while evading a public engagement.I can't understand it—a man of his standing and in- fluence. What can be in the way of his marriage?LULU. What is that that you're reading?SCHWARZ. An invitation to take part in the inter- national exhibition at St. Petersburg. I have no ideawhat to paint for it.LULU. Some entrancing girl or other, of course.SCHWARZ. Will you be willing to pose for it?LULU. God knows there are other pretty girls enoughin existence !SCHWARZ. But with any other model—tho she beas racy as hell—I can't get such a full display of mypowers.LULU. Then I must, I suppose. Wouldn't it go aswell lying down?SCHWARZ. Really, I'd liefest have your taste arrangeit for me. {Folding up the letters.) Don't let's forgetto congratulate Schon to-day, anyway. {Goes left andshuts the letters in the writing-table.)LULU. But we did that a long time ago.SCHWARZ. For his bride's sake.LULU. You can write to him again if you want.SCHWARZ. And now to work! {Takes up his brushesand palette,kisses Lulu, goes up the steps, right, and turnsaround in the door-way.) Eve!LULU. {Lets her book sink, smiling.) Your pleasure?SCHWARZ. {Approaching her.) I feel every day asif I were seeing you for the very first time.LULU. You're a terror. SCHWARZ. The fault is yours. {He sinks on hisknees by the couch and caresses her hand.)LULU. {Stroking his hair.) You're wasting me.SCHWARZ. You are mine. But you are nevermore ensnaring than when you ought for God's sake to be,just once, real ugly for a couple of hours! Since I'vehad you, I have had nothing more. I'm entirely lost tomyself.LULU. Not so excited! {Bell rings in the corridor.)SCHWARZ. {Pulling himself together.) Confound it!LULU. No one at home!SCHWARZ. Perhaps it's the art-dealer—LULU. And if it's the Chinese Emperor!SCHWARZ. One moment. {Exit.)LULU. {Visionary.) Thou? Thou? {Closes hereyes.)SCHWARZ. {Coming back.) A beggar, who says hewas in the war. I have no small change on me. (Takingup his palette and brushes.) It's high time, too, that Ishould finally go to work. {Goes right. ) {Lulutouches herself up before the strokes back her hair,and goes out, returning leading in Schigolch.)SCHIGOLCH. I'd thought he was more of a swell—alittle more glory to him. He's sort of embarrassed. Hequaked a little in the knees when he saw me in frontof him.LULU. {Shoving a chair round for him.) How canyou beg from him, too?SCHIGOLCH. That's why I've dragged my seventy- seven summers just here. You told me he kept at hispainting in the mornings.LULU. He hadn't got quite awake yet. How muchdo you need? SCHIGOLCH. Two hundred, if you have that muchhandy. Personally, I'd like three hundred. Some of myclients have evaporated.LULU. ( Goes to the writing-table and rummages inthe drawer.) Whew, I'm tired!SCHIGOLCH. (Looking round him.) That's just whatbrought me, too. I've been wanting a long time to seehow things were looking now with you.LULU. Well?SCHIGOLCH. It just sweeps over you. (Looking up.)Like with me fifty years ago. Instead of the loafing chairswe still had rusty old sabres then. Devil, but you'vebrought it pretty far! (Scuffing.) Carpets. .. .LULU. (Giving him two bills.) I like best to walkon them bare-footed.SCHIGOLCH. (Scanning Lulu s portrait.) Is that you?LULU. (Winking.) Pretty fine?SCHIGOLCH. If all that's genuine.LULU. Have something sweet?SCHIGOLCH. What?LULU. (Getting up.) Elixir de Spaa.SCHIGOLCH. That doesn't help me— Does he drink?LULU. (Taking a decanter and glasses from a cup- board near the fireplace.) Not yet. (Coming downstage.) The cordial has such various effects!SCHIGOLCH. He comes to blows?LULU. He goes to sleep. (She fills the two glasses.)SCHIGOLCH. When he's drunk, you can see right intohis insides.LULU. I'd rather not. (Sits opposite Schigolch.)Tell me about it.SCHIGOLCH. The streets keep on getting longer, andmy legs shorter. LULU. And your harmonica?SCHIGOLCH. Has bad air, like me with my asthma. Ijust keep a-thinking it isn't worth the trouble to make itbetter. ( They clink glasses.)LULU. ( Emptying her glass.) I thought you'd cometo an end a long time ago—SCHIGOLCH. To an end—already up and away? Ithought so, too. But no matter how early the sun goesdown, still we aren't let lie quiet. I'm hoping for winter.Perhaps then my (coughing)—my—my asthma will in- vent some opportunity to carry me off.LULU. {Filling the glasses.) Do you think they couldhave forgotten you on the other side?SCHIGOLCH. Would be possible, for it certainly isn'tgoing like it usually does. {Stroking her knee.) Nowyou tell—not seen you a long time—my little Lulu.LULU. {Jerking back, smiling.) Life is beyond me!SCHIGOLCH. What do you know about it? You'restill so young!LULU. That you call me Lulu.SCHIGOLCH. Lulu, isn't it? Have I ever called youanything else?LULU. In the memory of man my name has no longerbeen Lulu.SCHIGOLCH. Another way of naming?LULU. Lulu sounds to me quite ante-diluvian.SCHIGOLCH. Children! Children!LULU. My name now is—SCHIGOLCH. As if the principle wasn't always thesame!LULU. You mean—?SCHIGOLCH. What is it now?LULU. EVE. SCHIGOLCH. Lept, hopped, skipped, jumped. . . .LULU. I'm listening.SCHIGOLCH. (Gazing round.) This is the way Idreamt of it for you. You've aimed straight for it.( Seeing Lulu sprinkling herself with perfume.) What'sthat?LULU. Heliotrope.SCHIGOLCH. Does that smell better than you?LULU. ( Sprinkling him.) That needn't bother youany more.SCHIGOLCH. Who would have dreamt of this royalluxury before!LULU. When I think back—Ugh!SCHIGOLCH. (Stroking her knee.) How's it goingwith you, then? You still keep at the French?LULU. I lie and sleep.SCHIGOLCH. That's genteel. That always looks likesomething. And afterwards ?LULU. I stretch—till it cracks.SCHIGOLCH. And when it has cracked?LULU. What do you mind about that?SCHIGOLCH. What do I mind about that? What doI mind? I'd rather live till the last trump and renounceall heavenly joys than leave my Lulu deprived of any- thing down here behind me. What do I mind about that ?It's my sympathy. To be sure, my better self i s alreadytransfigured—but I still have some sense for this world.LULU. I haven't.SCHIGOLCH. You're too well off.LULU. (Shuddering.) Idiot. .. .SCHIGOLCH. Better than with the old dancing-bear?LULU. (Sadly.) I don't dance any more.SCHIGOLCH. For him it was time, too. LULU. Now I am— (Stops.)SCHIGOLCH. Speak how it is with you, child! I be- lieved in you when there was no more to be seen in youthan your two big eyes. What are you now?LULU. A beast. . . .SCHIGOLCH. That you—! And what kind of abeast? A fine beast! An elegant beast! A glorifiedbeast! Then I'll let them bury me. We're through withprejudices—even with the one against the corpse-washer.LULU. You needn't be afraid that you will be washedonce more.SCHIGOLCH. Doesn't matter, either. One gets dirtyagain.LULU. ( Sprinkling him.) It would call you back tolife again!SCHIGOLCH. We are mud.LULU. I beg your pardon! I rub grease into myselfevery day and then powder on top of it.SCHIGOLCH. Probably worth while, too, on the dressed- up mucker's account.LULU. It makes the skin like satin.SCHIGOLCH. As if it weren't just dirt all the same!LULU. Thank you. I wish to be worth biting at!SCHIGOLCH. We are. Give a big dinner down belowthere pretty soon. Keep open house.LULU. Your guests will hardly over-eat themselvesat it.SCHIGOLCH. Patience, girl! Your worshippers won'tput you in alcohol, either. It's "schone Melusine" as longas it keeps buoyant. Afterwards? They don't take itat the zoological garden. (RiThe gentle beastiesmight get stomach-cramps.LULU. (Getting up.) Have you enough? SCHIGOLCH. There's still enough left over to planta juniper on my grave. I'll find my own way out. {Exit.Lulu follows him, and presently returns with Dr. Schdn.)SCHON. What's your father doing here?LULU. What's the matter?SCHON. If I were your husband that man wouldnever come over my threshold.LULU. You can speak intimately. He's not here.{Referring to Schwarz.)SCHON. Thank you, I'd rather not.LULU. I don't understand.SCHON. I know that. {Offering her a seat.) Ishould like to speak with you just on that subject.LULU. {Sitting down uncertainly.) Why didn't youtell me so yesterday, then?SCHON. Please, nothing now about yesterday. I didtell you two years ago.LULU. {Nervously.) Oh, yes,—Hm!SCHON. Please be kind enough to cease your visitsto my house.LULU. May I offer you an elixir—SCHON. Thanks. No elixir. Have you understoodme? {Lulu shakes her head.) Good. You have thechoice. You force me to the most extreme measures:—either act in accordance with your station—LULU. Or?SCHON. Or—you compel me—I should have to turnto that person who is responsible for your behavior.LULU. What makes you imagine that?SCHON. I shall request your husband, himself towatch over your ways. {Lulu rises, goes up the steps,right.) Where are you going?LULU. {Calls thru the curtains.) Walter! SCHON. (Springing up.) Are you mad?LULU. ( Turning round.) Aha!SCHON. I have made the most superhuman effortsto raise you in society. You can be ten times as proudof your name as of your intimacy with me.LULU. ( Comes down the steps and puts her armaround Schon s neck.) Why are you still afraid, nowthat you're at the zenith of your hopes?SCHON. No comedy! The zenith of my hopes? lamat last engaged: I have now the hope of bringing my brideinto a clean house.LULU. (Sitting.) She has developed delightfully inthe two years!SCHON. She no longer looks thru one so earnestly.LULU. She is now, for the first time, a woman. Wecan meet each other wherever it seems suitable to you.SCHON. We shall meet each other nowhere but in thepresence of your husband!LULU. You don't believe yourself what you say.SCHON. Then he must believe it. Go on and callhim! Thru his marriage to you, thru all that I've donefor him, he has become my friend.LULU. (Rising.) Mine, too.SCHON. Then I'll cut down the sword over my head.LULU. You have, indeed, chained me up. But I owemy happiness to you. You will get friends by the crowdas soon as you have a pretty young wife again.SCHON. You judge women by yourself! He's gotthe sense of a child or he would have tracked out yourdoublings and windings long ago.LULU. I only wish he would! Then, at last he'd getout of his swaddling-clothes. He puts his trust in themarriage contract he has in his pocket. Trouble is past and gone. One can now give oneself and let oneselfgo as if one were at home. That isn't the sense of achild! It's banal! He has no education; he seesnothing; he sees neither me nor himself; he is blind,blind, blind. . . .SCHON. ( Half to himself.) When his eyes open!!LULU. Open his eyes for him! I'm going to ruin.I'm neglecting myself. He doesn't know me at all.What am I to him? He calls me darling and littledevil. He would say the same to any piano-teacher.He makes no pretensions. Everything is alright, to him.That comes from his never in his life having felt the needof intercourse with women.SCHON. If that's true!LULU. He admits it perfectly openly.SCHON. A man who has painted them, rags and tagsand velvet gowns, since he was fourteen.LULU. Women make him anxious. He trembles forhis health and comfort. But he isn't afraid of me!SCHON. How many girls would deem themselvesGod knows how blessed in your situation.LULU. (Softly pleading.) Seduce him. Corrupthim. You know how. Take him into bad company—you know the people. lam nothing to him but a woman,just woman. He makes me feel so ridiculous. He willbe prouder of me. He doesn't know any differences.I'm thinking my head off, day and night, how to shakehim up. In my despair I dance the can-can. He yawns;and drivels something about obscenity.SCHON. Nonsense. He is an artist, though.LULU. At least he believes he is.SCHON. That's the chief thing! LULU. When I pose for him. . . . -He believes, too,that he's a famous man.SCHON. We have made him one.LULU. He believes everything. He's as mistrustful asa thief, and lets himself be lied to, till one loses all re- spect! When we first knew each other I informed himI had never yet loved— ( Schon falls into an easy-chair.)Otherwise he would really have taken me for a fallenwoman!SCHON. You make God knows what exorbitant de- mands on legitimate relations!LULU. I make no exorbitant demands. Often I evendream still of Goll.SCHON. He was, at any rate, not banal!LULU. He is there, as if he had never been away.Only he walks as tho in his socks. He isn't angry withme; he's awfully sad. And then he is fearful, as thohe were there without the permission of the police.Otherwise, he feels at ease with us. Only he can'tquite get over my having thrown away so much moneysince—SCHON. You yearn for the whip once more?LULU. Maybe. I don't dance any more.SCHON. Teach him to do it.LULU. A waste of trouble.SCHON. Out of a hundred women, ninety educatetheir husbands to suit themselves.LULU. He loves me.SCHON. That's fatal, of course.LULU. He loves me—SCHON. That is an unbridgeable abyss.LULU. He doesn't know me, but he loves me! If he had anything like a correct idea of me, he'd tie a stonearound my neck and sink me in the sea where it's deepest.SCHON. Let's finish this? (He gets up.)LULU. As you say.SCHON. I've married you off. Twice I have marriedyou off. You live in luxury. I've created a position foryour husband. If that doesn't satisfy you, and he laughsin his sleeve at it, I don't pretend to meet ideal claims;but—leave me out of the game, out of it!LULU. (Resolutely.) If I belong to any person onthis earth, I belong to you. Without you I'd be—l won'tsay where. You took me by the hand, gave me food toeat, had me dressed,—when I was going to steal yourwatch. Do you think that can be forgotten? Anybodyelse would have called the police. You sent me to school,and had me learn manners. Who but you in the wholeworld has ever thought anything of me? I've dancedand posed, and was glad to be able to earn my livingthat way. But love at command, I can't!SCHON. (Raising his voice.) Leave me out! Dowhat you will. I'm not coming to make scandal; I'mcoming to shake the scandal from my neck. My engage- ment is costing me sacrifices enough! I had imaginedthat with a healthy young man, than whom a woman ofyour years can wish herself no better, you would, at last,have been contented. If you are under obligations to me,don't throw yourself a third time in my way! Am I towait yet longer before putting my pile in security? AmI to risk the whole success of my patents falling into thewater again after two years? What good is it to meto be your married-man, when you can be seen goingin and out of my house at every hour of the day? Whythe devil didn't Dr. Goll stay alive just one year more! With him you were in safe keeping. Then I'd have hadmy wife long since under my roof!LULU. And what would you have had then? Thekid gets on your nerves. The child is too uncorruptedfor you. She's been much too carefully brought up.What should I have against your marriage ? But you aredeceived about yourself if you think that on account ofyour impending marriage you may express your con- tempt to me.SCHON. Contempt? I shall soon give the child theright idea. If anything is contemptible, it's your intrigues!LULU. (Laughing.) Am I jealous of the child?That never once entered my head.SCHON. Then why talk about the child? The childis not even a whole year younger than you are. Leaveme my freedom to live what life I still have. No matterhow the child s been brought up, she's got her five sensesjust like you. . . . ( Schwarzappears, right, brush inhand.)SCHWARZ. What's the matter here ?LULU. (To Schon.) Well? Go on. Talk.SCHWARZ. What's the matter with you two?LULU. Nothing that touches you—SCHON. (Sharply.) Quiet!LULU. Hes had enough of me. (Schwarz leads heroff, to the right.)SCHON. (Turning over the leaves in one of the bookson the table.) It had to come out—I must have myhands free at last!SCHWARZ. (Coming back.) Is that away to jest?SCHON. (Pointing to a chair.) Please.SCHWARZ. What is it?SCHON. Please. SCHWARZ. (Seating himself.) Well?SCHON. ( Seating himself.) You have married halfa million. . . .SCHWARZ. Is it gone?SCHON. Not a penny.SCHWARZ. Explain to me the peculiar scene. . . .SCHON. You have married half a million—SCHWARZ. No one can make a crime of that.SCHON. You have created a name for yourself. Youcan work unmolested. You need to deny yourself nowish—SCHWARZ. What have you two got against me?SCHON. For six months you've been revelling in allthe heavens. You have a wife whom the world enviesyou, and she deserves a man whom she can respect—SCHWARZ. Doesn't she respect me?SCHON. No.SCHWARZ. ( Depressed.) I come from the darkdepths of society. She is above me. I cherish no moreardent wish than to become her equal. (Offers Schonhis hand.) Thank you.SCHON. (Pressing it, half embarrassed.) Don't men- tion it.SCHWARZ. (With determination.) Speak!SCHON. Keep a little more watch on her.SCHWARZ. I—on her?SCHON. We are not children! We don't trifle! Shedemands that she be taken seriously. Her value gives hera perfect right to be.SCHWARZ. What does she do, then?SCHON. You have married half a million!SCHWARZ. (Rises; beside himself.) She—?SCHON. (Takes him by the shoulder.) No, that's not the way! ( Forces him to sit.) We must speak witheach other very seriously here.SCHWARZ. What does she do?SCHON. First count on your fingers what you haveto thank her for, and then—SCHWARZ. What does she do—man!!SCHON. And then make yourself responsible for yourfaults, and no one else.SCHWARZ. With whom? With whom?SCHON. If we should shoot each other—SCHWARZ. Since when, then?SCHON. (Evasive.) —I don't come here to makescandal, I come to save you from the scandal.SCHWARZ. You have misunderstood her.SCHON. (Embarrassed.) That will not do for me.I can't see you go on living in blindness. The girl de- serves to be a respectable woman. Since I have knownher she has improved as she developed.SCHWARZ. Since you have known her? Since whenhave you known her then?SCHON. Since about her twelfth year.SCHWARZ. (Bewildered.) She told me nothing aboutthat.SCHON. She sold flowers in front of the AlhambraCafe. Every evening between twelve and two she pressedin among the guests, bare-footed.SCHWARZ. She told me nothing of that.SCHON. She did right there. I'm telling you, soyou may see that you have not to do with moral de- generacy. The girl is, on the contrary, of extraordinarilygood disposition.SCHWARZ. She said she had grown up with an aunt.SCHON. That was the woman I gave her to. She was her best pupil. The mothers used to make her anexample to their children. She has the feeling for duty.It is simply and solely your mistake if you have till nowneglected to take her on her best sides.SCHWARZ. (Sobbing.) O God!—SCHON. (With emphasis.) No O God!! Nothingof the happiness you have cost can be changed. Done isdone. You over-rate yourself against your better know- ledge if you persuade yourself you will lose. You standto gain. But with "O God" nothing is gained. A greaterfriendliness I have not yet shown you: I speak plainly andoffer you my help. Don't show yourself unworthy of it!SCHWARZ. ( From now on more and more brokenup.) When I first knew her, she told me she had neverloved.SCHON. When a widow says that—! It does hercredit that she chose you for a husband. Make the sameclaims on yourself and your happiness is without a blot.SCHWARZ. She says he made her wear short dresses.SCHON. But he married her! That was her master- stroke. How she brought the man to it is beyond me.You really must know it now: you are enjoying the fruitsof her diplomacy.SCHWARZ. How did she get to know Dr. Goll then?SCHON. Through me! It was after my wife's death,when I was making the first advances to my presentfiancee. She stuck herself in between. She had fixedher mind on becoming my wife.SCHWARZ. (As if seized with a horrible suspicion.)And then when her husband died ?SCHON. You married half a million!!SCHWARZ. (W ailing.)O, to have stayed where Iwas! To have died of hunger! SCHON. {Superior.) Do you think, then, that I makeno compromises? Who is there that does not compro- mise? You have married half a million. You are to- day one of the foremost artists. That can't be donewithout money. You are not the man to sit in judgmenton her. You can't possibly treat an origin like Mignon'saccording to the notions of bourgeois society.SCHWARZ. {Quite distraught.) Who are you speak- ing of?SCHON. Of her father! You're an artist, I say: yourideals are on a different plane from those of a wage- worker.SCHWARZ. I don't understand a word of all that.SCHON. lam speaking of the inhuman conditions outof which, thanks to her good management, the girl hasdeveloped into what she is!SCHWARZ. Who ?SCHON. Who? Your wife.SCHWARZ. EVE?SCHON. I called her Mignon.SCHWARZ. I thought her name was Nellie?SCHON. Dr. Goll called her so.SCHWARZ. I called her Eve—SCHON. What her real name is I don't know.SCHWARZ. {Absently.) Perhaps she knows.SCHON. With a father like hers, she is, with all herfaults, a miracle. I don't understand you—SCHWARZ. He died in a madhouse—?SCHON. He was here just now!SCHWARZ. Who was here?SCHON. Her father.SCHWARZ. Here—in my house? SCHON. He squeezed by me as I came in. And thereare the two glasses still.SCHWARZ. She says he died in the madhouse.SCHON. Let her feel she's in authority—! She cravesnothing but the compulsion to unconditional obedience.With Dr. Goll she was in heaven, and with him therewas no joking.SCHWARZ. ( Shaking his head.) She said she hadnever loved—SCHON. But you, make a beginning with yourself.Pull yourself together!SCHWARZ. She has sworn—!SCHON. You can't demand a sense of duty in herbefore you know your own task.SCHWARZ. By her mother's grave!SCHON. She never knew her mother, let alone thegrave. Her mother hasn't got a grave.SCHWARZ. I don't fit in society. {He is in desper- ation.)SCHON. What's the matter?SCHWARZ. Pain—horrible pain!SCHON. {Gets up, steps back; after a pause.) Guardher for yourself: she's yours. The moment is decisive.To-morrow she may be lost to you.SCHWARZ. {Pointing to his breast.) Here, here.SCHON. You have married half— {Reflecting.) Sheis lost to you if you let this moment slip!SCHWARZ. If I could weep! Oh, if I could cry out!SCHON. {With a hand on his shoulder.) You're suf- fering—SCHWARZ. {Getting up, apparently quiet.) You areright, quite right.SCHON. {Gripping his hand.) Where are you going? SCHWARZ. To speak with her.SCHON. Right! ( Accompanies the door, left.Coming back.) That was tough work. ( a pause,looking right.) He had taken her into the studio beforethough? ( A fearful groan, left. He hurries to the doorand finds it locked.) Open! Open the door!LULU. ( Stepping thru the hangings, right.) What's—SCHON. Open it!LULU. (Comes down the steps.) That is horrible.SCHON. Have you an ax in the kitchen?LULU. He'll open it right off—SCHON. I can't kick it down.LULU. When he's had his cry out.SCHON. (Kicking the door.) Open! (To Lulu.)Bring me an ax.LULU. Send for the doctor—SCHON. You are not yourself.LULU. It serves you right. (Bell rings in the cor- ridor. Schon and Lulu stare at each other. ThenSchon slips up-stage and stands in the doorway.)SCHON. I mustn't let myself be seen here.LULU. Perhaps it's the art-dealer. (The bell ringsagain.)SCHON. But if we don't answer it—LULU. (Steals toward the door; but Schon holdsher.) SCHON. Stop. It sometimes happens that one is notjust at hand— (He goes out on tip-toes. Lulu turnsback to the locked door and listens. Schon returns withAlva.) Please be quiet.ALVA. (Very excited.) A revolution has broken outin Paris!SCHON. Be quiet. ALVA. (To Lulu.) You're as pale as death.SCHON. (Rattling at the door.) Walter! Walter!(A death-rattle heard behind the door.)LULU. God pity you.SCHON. Haven't you brought an ax?LULU. If there's one there— (Goes slowly out, upperleft.)ALVA. He's just keeping us in suspense.SCHON. A revolution has broken out in Paris?ALVA. In the editors' room they're beating their headsagainst the wall. No one knows what he ought to write.( The bell rings in the corridor.)SCHON. ( Kicking against the door.) Walter!ALVA. Shall I force it in?SCHON. I can do that. Who is it coming now?(Standing up.) To enjoy life and let others be respon- sible for it—LULU. ( Coming back with a kitchen ax.) Henriettehas come home.SCHON. Shut the door behind you.ALVA. Give it here. (Takes the ax and pounds withit between the jamb and the lock.)SCHON. You must hold it nearer the end.ALVA. It's cracking— (The lock gives; Alva letsthe ax fall and staggers back.) (Pause.)LULU. (To Schon, pointing to the door.) Afteryou. (Schon flinches, drops back.) Are you getting—dizzy? (Schon wipes the sweat from his forehead andgoes in.)ALVA. (From the couch.) Ghastly!LULU. (Stopping in the door-way, finger on lips, criesout sharply.) Oh! Oh! (Hurries to Alva.) I can'tstay here. ALVA. Horrible!LULU. ( Taking his hand.) Come.ALVA. Where to ?LULU. I can't be alone. ( out with Alva, right.)( Schoncomes back, a bunch of keys in his hand, whichshows blood. He pulls the door to, behind him, goes tothe writing-table, opens it, and writes two notes.)ALVA. ( Coming back, right.) She's changing herclothes.SCHON. She has gone?ALVA. To her room. She's changing her clothes.( Schon rings. Henriette comes in.)SCHON. You know where Dr. Bernstein lives?HENRIETTE. Of course, Doctor. Right next door.SCHON. (Giving her one note.) Take that over tohim, please.HENRIETTE. In case the doctor is not at home?SCHON. He is at home. (Giving her the other note.)And take this to police headquarters. Take a cab. (riette goes out.) lam judged!ALVA. My blood is cold.SCHON. {Toward the left.) The fool!ALVA. He waked up to something, perhaps?SCHON. He has been too absorbed with himself.{Lulu appears on the steps, right, in dust-coat and hat.)ALVA. Where are you going now?LULU. Out. I see it on all the walls.SCHON. Where are his papers?LULU. In the desk.SCHON. {At the desk.) Where?LULU. Lower right-hand drawer. {She kneels andopens the drawer, emptying the papers on the floor.)Here. There is nothing to fear. He had no secrets. SCHON. Now I can just withdraw from the world.LULU. (Still kneeling.) Write a pamphlet abouthim. Call him Michelangelo.SCHON. What good'll that do? (Pointing left.)There lies my engagement.ALVA. That's the curse of your game!SCHON. Shout it thru the streets!!ALVA. ( Pointing to Lulu.) If you had treated thatgirl fairly and justly when my mother died—SCHON. My engagement is bleeding to death there!LULU. ( Getting up.) I sha'n't stay here any longer.SCHON. In an hour they'll be selling extras. I darenot go across the street!LULU. Why, what can you do to help it?SCHON. That's just it! They'll stone me for it!ALVA. You must get away—travel.SCHON. To leave the scandal a free field!LULU. (By the couch.) Ten minutes ago he waslying here.SCHON. This is the reward for all I've done for him!In one second he wrecks my whole life for me!ALVA. Control yourself, please!LULU. (On the couch.) There's no one but our- selves here.ALVA. But our position ?SCHON. (To Lulu.) What will you say to thepolice ?LULU. Nothing.ALVA. He didn't want to remain a debtor to his des- tiny.LULU. He always thought of death immediately.SCHON. He thought what a human being can onlydream of. LULU. He has paid dearly for it.ALVA. He had what we don't have!SCHON. ( Suddenly violent.) I know your reasons!I have no cause to consider you! If you try every meansto prevent having any brothers and sisters, that's all themore reason why I should get more children.ALVA. You've a poor knowledge of men.LULU. You get out an extra yourself!SCHON. ( With passionate indignation.) He had nomoral sense! ( Suddenly controlling himself again.)Paris in revolution—?ALVA. Our editors act as though they'd been struck.Everything has stopped dead.SCHON. That's got to help me over this! Now ifonly the police would come. The minutes are worthmore than gold. ( The bell rings in the corridor.)ALVA. There they are— (Schon starts to the door.Lulu jumps up.)LULU. Wait, you've got blood—SCHON. Where?LULU. Wait, I'll wipe it. ( her handker- chief with heliotrope and wipes the blood from Schon shand.)SCHON. It's your husband's blood.LULU. It leaves no trace.SCHON. Monster!LULU. You will marry me, though. (The bell ringsin the corridor.) Only have patience, children. (Schongoes out and returns with Esch a reporter.)ESCHERICH. (Breathless.) Allow me to—to intro- duce myself—SCHON. You've run?ESCHERICH. (Giving him his card.) From policeheadquarters. A suicide, I understand. SCHON. {Reads.) Fritz Escherich, correspondent ofthe "News and Novelties." Come along.ESCHERICH. One moment. {Takes out his note-book/and pencil, looks around the parlor, writes a few words,bows to Lulu, writes, turns to the broken door, writes.)A kitchen-ax. {Starts to lift it.)SCHON. {Holding him back.) Excuse me.ESCHERICH. {Writing.) Door broken open with akitchen-ax. {Examines the lock.)SCHON. {His hand on the door.) Look before you,my dear sir.ESCHERICH. Now if you will have the kindness toopen the door— {Schon opens it. Escherich lets bookand pencil fall, clutches at his hair.) Merciful Heaven!God!!SCHON. Look it all over carefully.ESCHERICH. I can't look at it!SCHON. {Snorting scornfully.) Then what did youcome here for?ESCHERICH. To—to cut up—to cut up his throat witha razor!SCHON. Have you seen it all?ESCHERICH. That must feel—SCHON. {Draws the door to, steps to the writing- table.) Sit down. Here is paper and pen. Write.ESCHERICH. {Mechanically taking his seat.) I can'twrite—SCHON. {Behind his chair.) Write! Persecution—mania. . . .ESCHERICH. {Writes.) Per-secu-tion—mania. {Thebell rings in the corridor.) CURTAIN ACT III A theatrical dressing-room, hung with red. Door upperright. Across upper left corner, a Spanish screen. Cen- tre, a table set endwise,on which dance costumes lie.Chair on each side of this table. Lower right, a smallertable with a chair. Lower left, a high, very wide, old- fashioned arm-chair. Above it, a tall mirror, with a make- up stand before it holding puff, rouge, etc., etc.Alva is at lower right, filling two glasses with red wineand champagne.ALVA. Never since I began to work for the stage haveI seen a public so uncontrolled in enthusiasm.LULU. ( Voice from behind the .) Don't giveme too much red wine. Will he see me to-day?ALVA. Father?LULU. Yes.ALVA. I don't know if he's in the theater.LULU. Doesn't he want to see me at all?ALVA. He has so little time.LULU. His bride occupies him.ALVA. Speculations. He gives himself no rest.( Schonenters.) You? We're just speaking of you.LULU. Is he there?SCHON. You're changing?LULU. ( Peeping over the Spanish screen, to Schon.)You write in all the papers that I'm the most gifteddanseuse who ever trod the stage, a second Taglioni andI don't know what else—and you haven't once found megifted enough to convince yourself of the fact.SCHON. I have so much to write. You see, I was right: there were hardly any seats left. You must keeprather more in the proscenium.LULU. I must first accustom myself to the light.ALVA. She has kept herself strictly to her part.SCHON. {To Alva.) You must get more out ofyour performers! You don't know enough yet aboutthe technique. {To Lulu.) What do you come as now?LULU. As a flower-girl.SCHON. {To Alva.) In tights?ALVA. No. In a skirt to the ankles.SCHON. It would have been better if you hadn't ven- tured on symbolism.. ALVA. I look at a dancer's feet.SCHON. The point is, what the public looks at. Anapparition like her has no need, thank heaven, of yoursymbolic mummery.ALVA. The public doesn't look as if it was bored!SCHON. Of course not; because I have been workingfor her success in the press for six months. Has theprince been here?ALVA. Nobody's been here.SCHON. Who lets a dancer come on thru two actsin raincoats?ALVA. Who is the prince?SCHON. Shall we see each other afterwards?ALVA. Are you alone?SCHON. With acquaintances. At Peter's?ALVA. At twelve?SCHON. At twelve. {Exit.)LULU. I'd given up hoping he'd ever come.ALVA. Don't let yourself be misled by his grumpygrowls. If you'll only be careful not to spend yourstrength before the last number begins— {Lulu steps out in a classical, sleeveless dress, white with a red border,a bright wreath in her hair and a basket of flowers in herhands.)LULU. He doesn't seem to have noticed at all howcleverly you have used your performers.ALVA. I won't blow in sun, moon and stars in thefirst act!LULU. {Sipping.) You disclose me by degrees.ALVA. I knew, though, that you knew all about chang- ing costumes.LULU. If I'd wanted to sell my flowers this way be- fore the Alhambra cafe, they'd have had me behind lockand key right off the very first night.ALVA. Why? You were a child!* iLULU. Do you remember me when I entered yourroom the first time?ALVA. You wore a dark blue dress with black velvet.LULU. They had to stick me somewhere and didn'tknow where.ALVA. My mother had been lying sick two years then.LULU. You were playing theater, and asked me if Iwanted to play too.ALVA. To be sure! We played theater!LULU. I see you still—the way you shoved the figuresback and forth.ALVA. For a long time my most terrible memorywas when all at once I saw clearly into your relations—LULU. \ou got icy curt towards me then.ALVA. Oh, God— I saw in you something so infinitelyfar above me. I had perhaps a higher devotion to youthan to my mother. Think—when my mother died—lwas seventeen—1 went and stood before my father and demanded that he make you his wife on the spot or we'dhave to fight a duel.LULU. He told me that at the time.ALVA. Since I've grown older, I can only pity him.He will never comprehend me. There he is making upa story for himself about a little diplomatic game thatputs me in the role of laboring against his marriage withthe Countess.LULU. Does she still look as innocently as ever at theworld ?ALVA. She loves him. I'm convinced of that. Herfamily has tried everything to make her turn back. Idon't think any sacrifice in the world would be too greatfor her for his sake.LULU. (Holds out her glass to him.) A little more,please.ALVA. ( Giving it to her.) You're drinking too much.LULU. He shall learn to believe in my success! Hedoesn't believe in any art. He believes only in papers.ALVA. He believes in nothing.LULU. He brought me into the theater in order thatsomeone might eventually be found rich enough to marryme.ALVA. Well, alright. Why need that trouble us?LULU. lamto be glad if I can dance myself into a mil- lionaire's heart.ALVA. God defend that anyone should take you fromus!LULU. You've composed the music for it, though.ALVA. YOU know that it was always my wish to writea piece for you.LULU. lam not at all made for the stage, however.ALVA. YOU came into the world a dancer! LULU. Why don't you write your things at least asinteresting as life is?ALVA. Because if we did no man would believe us.LULU. If I didn't know more about acting than thepeople on the stage do, what might not have happenedto me?ALVA. I've provided your part with all the impossibili- ties imaginable, though.LULU. With hocus-pocus like that no dog is luredfrom the stove in the real world.ALVA. It's enough for me that the public finds itselfmost tremendously stirred up.LULU. But /'d like to find myself most tremendouslystirred up. (Drinks.)ALVA. You don't seem to be in need of much more forthat.LULU. No one of them realizes anything about theothers. Each thinks that he alone is the unhappy victim.ALVA. But how can you feel that?LULU. There runs up one's body such an icy shudder.ALVA. You are incredible. (An electric bell rings overthe door.)LULU. My cape. ... I shall keep in the proscenium!ALVA. (Putting a wide shawl round her shoulders.)Here is your cape.LULU. He shall have nothing more to fear for hisshameless boosting.ALVA. Keep yourself under control!LULU. God grant that I dance the last sparks of in- telligence out of their heads. (Exit.)ALVA. Yes, a more interesting piece could be writtenabout her. (SitSj right, and takes out his note-book.Writes. Looks up.) First act: Dr. Goll. Rotten al- ready! I can call up Dr. Goll from purgatory or wher- ever else he's doing penance for his orgies, but I'll be maderesponsible for his sins. ( muchdeadened applause and bravos outside.) They rage thereas in a menagery when the meat appears at the cage.Second act: Walter Schwarz. Still more impossible!How our souls do strip off their last coverings in thelight of such lightning-strokes! Third act? Is it reallyto go on this way? ( The attendant opens the door fromoutside and lets Escerny enter. He acts as though he wereat home, and without greeting Alva takes the chair nearthe mirror. Alva continues, not heeding him.) It cannot go on this way in the third act!ESCERNY. Up to the middle of the third act it didn'tseem to go so well to-day as usual.ALVA. I was not on the stage.ESCERNY. Now she's in full career again.ALVA. She's lengthening each number.ESCERNY. I once had the pleasure of meeting theartiste at Schon's.ALVA. My father has brought her before the publicby some critiques in his paper.ESCERNY. ( Bowing slightly.) I was conferring withDr. Schon about the publication of my discoveries at LakeTanganika.ALVA. ( Bowing slightly.) His remarks leave no doubtthat he takes the liveliest interest in your work.ESCERNY. It's a very good thing in the artiste that thepublic does not exist for her at all.ALVA. As a child she learned the quick changing ofclothes; but I was surprised to discover such an expressivedancer in her.ESCERNY. When she dances her solo she is intoxicated with her own beauty, with which she herself seems to bemortally in love.ALVA. Here she comes. ( and opens the door.Enter Lulu.)LULU. ( Without wreath or to Alva.) You'recalled for. I was three times before the curtain. {ToEscerny.) Dr. Schon is not in your box?ESCERNY. Not in mine.ALVA. (To Lulu.) Didn't you see him?LULU. He is probably away again.ESCERNY. He has the last parquet-box on the left.LULU. It seems he is ashamed of me!ALVA. There wasn't a good seat left for him.LULU. {To Alva.) Ask him, though, if he likes mebetter now.ALVA. I'll send him up.ESCERNY. He applauded.LULU. Did he really?ALVA. Give yourself some rest. {Exit.)LULU. I've got to change again now.ESCERNY. But your maid isn't here?LULU. I can do it quicker alone. Where did you sayDr. Schon was sitting?ESCERNY. I saw him in the left parquet-box farthestback.LULU. I've still five costumes before me now; dancing- girl, ballerina, queen of the night, Ariel, and Lascaris. . . .{She goes behind the Spanish screen.)ESCERNY. Would you think it possible that at our firstmeeting I expected nothing more than to make the ac- quaintance of a young lady of the literary world? . . .{He sits at the left of the centre table, and remains thereto the end of the scene.) Have I perhaps erred in my judgment of your nature, or did I rightly interpret thesmile which the thundering storms of applause called forthon your lips? That you are secretly pained at the neces- sity of profaning your art before people of doubtful dis- interestedness? ( Lulu makes no answer.) That youwould gladly exchange at any moment the shimmer ofpublicity for a quiet, sunny happiness in distinguished se- clusion? ( Lulu makes no answer.) That you feel inyourself enough dignity and high rank to fetter a man toyour feet—in order to enjoy his utter helplessness? . . .(Lulu makes no answer.) That in a comfortable, richlyfurnished villa you would feel in a more fitting place thanhere,—with unlimited means, to live completely as yourown mistress? (Lulu steps forth in a short, bright,pleated petticoat and white satin bodice, black shoes andstockings, and spurs with bells at her heels.)LULU. (Busy with the lacing of her bodice.) Ifthere's just one evening I don't go on, I dream the wholenight that I'm dancing and feel the next day as if I'd beenracked.ESCERNY. But what difference could it make to youto see before you instead of this mob one spectator,specially elect?LULU. That would make no difference. I don't seeanybody anyway.ESCERNY. A lighted summer-house—the splashing ofthe water near at hand. ... I am forced in my exploring- trips to the practise of a quite inhuman tyranny—LULU. {Putting on a pearl necklace before the mir- ror.) A good school!ESCERNY. And if I now long to deliver myself unre- servedly into the power of a woman, that is a naturalneed for relaxation. . . . Can you imagine a greater life- happiness for a woman than to have a man entirely in herpower ?LULU. ( Jingling her heels.) Oh yes!ESCERNY. {Disconcerted.) Among cultured men youwill find not one who doesn't lose his head over you.LULU. Your wishes, however, no one will fulfill with- out deceiving you.ESCERNY. To be deceived by a girl like you must beten times more enrapturing than to be uprightly loved byanybody else.LULU. You have never in your life been uprightlyloved by a girl! (Turning her back to him and point- ing.) Would you undo this knot for me? I've laced my- self too tight. lam always so excited getting dressed.ESCERNY. {After repeated efforts.) I'm sorry; I can't.LULU. Then leave it. Perhaps I can. {Goes left.)ESCERNY. I confess that I am lacking in deftness.Maybe I was not docile enough with women.LULU. And probably you don't have much oppor- tunity to be so in Africa, either?ESCERNY. {Seriously.) Let me openly admit to youthat my loneliness in the world embitters many hours.LULU. The knot is almost done. . . .ESCERNY. What draws me to you is not your dancing.It's your physical and mental refinement, as it is revealedin every one of your movements. Anyone who is so muchinterested in art as I am could not be deceived in that.For ten evenings I've been studying your spiritual life inyour dance, until to-day when you entered as the flower- girl I became perfectly clear. Yours is a grand nature—unselfish; you can see no one suffer; you embody the joyof life. As a wife you will make a man happy above all things. ... You are all open-heartedness. You wouldbe a poor actor. ( The bell rings again.)LULU. ( Having somewhat loosened her laces, takes adeep breath and jingles her spurs.) Now I can breatheagain. The curtain is going up. ( takes from thecentre table a skirt-dance costume—of bright yellow silk,without a waist, closed at the neck, reaching to the ankles,with wide, loose sleeves—and throws it over her.) I mustdance.ESCERNY. ( Rises and kisses her hand.) Allow me toremain here a little while longer.LULU. Please, stay.ESCERNY. I need some solitude. ( goes out.)What is to be aristocratic? To be eccentric, like me?Or to be perfect in body and mind, like this girl? (Ap- plause and bravos outside.) He who gives me back myfaith in men, gives me back my life. Should not thechildren of this woman be more princely, body and soul,than the children whose mother has no more vitality inher than I have felt in me until to-day? ( right;ecstatically.) The dance has ennobled her body. .. .( Alva enters.)ALVA. One is never sure a moment that some miser- able chance may not throw the whole performance outfor good. {He throws himself into the big chair, left, sothat the two men are in exactly reversed positions fromtheir former ones. Both converse somewhat boredly andapathetically.)ESCERNY. But the public has never yet shown itselfso grateful.ALVA. She's finished the skirt-dance.ESCERNY. I hear her coming. . . . ALVA. She isn't coming. She has no time. Shechanges her costume in the wings.ESCERNY. She has two ballet-costumes, if I'm not mis- taken ?ALVA. I find the white one more becoming to her thanthe rose.ESCERNY. Do yOU?ALVA. Don't you?ESCERNY. I find she looks too body-less in the whitetulle.ALVA. I find she looks too animal in the rose-tulle.ESCERNY. I don't find that.ALVA. The white tulle expresses more the child-likein her nature.ESCERNY. The rose tulle expresses more the female inher nature. ( The electric bell rings over the door. Alvajumps up.)ALVA. For heaven's sake, what is wrong?ESCERNY. (Getting up too). What's the matter?(The electric bell goes on ringing to the close of thedialogue.)ALVA. Something's gone wrong there—ESCERNY. How can you get so suddenly frightened?ALVA. That must be a hellish confusion! {He runsout. Escerny follows him. The door remains open.Faint dance-music heard. Pause. Lulu enters in a longcloak, and shuts the door to behind her. She wears arose-colored ballet costume with flower garlands. Shewalks across the stage and sits down in the big arm-chairnear the mirror. After a pause Alva returns.)ALVA. You had a faint?LULU. Please lock the door.ALVA. At least come down to the stage. LULU. Did you see him?ALVA. See whom ?LULU. With his bride?ALVA. With his— (To Schon, who enters.) Youmight have spared yourself that jest!SCHON. What's the matter with her? (To Lulu.)How can you play the scene straight at me!LULU. I feel as if I'd been whipped.SCHON. (After bolting the door.) You will dance—as sure as I've taken the responsibility for you!LULU. Before your bride?SCHON. Have you a right to trouble yourself beforewhom? You've been engaged here. You receive yoursalary . . .LULU. Is that your affair?SCHON. You dance for anyone who buys a ticket.Whom I sit with in my box has nothing to do with yourbusiness!ALVA. I wish you'd stayed sitting in your box! (ToLulu.) Tell me, please, what lam to do. (A knock atthe door.) There is the manager. (Calls.) Yes, in amoment! (To Lulu.) You won't compel us to breakoff the performance?SCHON. (To Lulu.) Onto the stage with you!LULU. Let me have just a moment! I can't now.I'm utterly miserable.ALVA. The devil take the whole theater crowd!LULU. Put in the next number. No one will noticeif I dance now or in five minutes. There's no strengthin my feet.ALVA. But you will dance then?LULU. As well as I can. ALVA. As badly as you like. knock at the dooragain.) I'm coming.LULU. ( When Alva is gone.) You are right to showme where my place is. You couldn't do it better than byletting me dance the skirt-dance before your fiancee. . . .You do me the greatest service when you point out whereI belong.SCHON. ( Sardonically.) For you with your originit's incomparable luck to still have the chance of enteringbefore respectable people!LULU. Even when my shamelessness makes them notknow where to look.SCHON. Nonsense!—Shamelessness?—Don't make anecessity of virtue! Your shamelessness is balanced withgold for you at every step. One cries "bravo," an- other "fie"—it's all the same to you! Can you wish fora more brilliant triumph than when a respectable girl canhardly be kept in the box? Has your life any other aim?As long as you still have a spark of self-respect, you are noperfect dancer. The more terribly you make people shud- der, the higher you stand in your profession!LULU. But it is absolutely indifferent to me what theythink of me. I don't, in the least, want to be any betterthan I am. I'm content with myself.SCHON. {ln ?noral indignation.) That is your truenature. I call that straightforward! A corruption!!LULU. I wouldn't have known that I had a spark ofself-respect—SCHON. {Suddenly distrustful.) No harlequinading—LULU. O Lord—I know very well what I'd have be- come if you hadn't saved me from it.SCHON. Are you then, perhaps, something different to- day? LULU. God be thanked, no!SCHON. That is right!LULU. {Laughs.) And how awfully glad lam aboutit.SCHON. {Spits.) Will you dance now?LULU. In anything, before anyone!SCHON. Then down to the stage!LULU. {Begging like a child.) Just a minute more!Please! I can't stand up straight yet. They'll ring.SCHON. You have become what you are in spite ofeverything I sacrificed for your education and your wel- fare.LULU. Had you overrated your ennobling influence?SCHON. Spare me your witticisms.LULU. The prince was here.SCHON. Well?LULU. He takes me with him to Africa.SCHON. Africa?LULU. Why not? Didn't you make me a dancer justso that someone might come and take me away with him?SCHON. But not to Africa, though!LULU. Then why didn't you let me fall quietly in afaint, and silently thank heaven for it?SCHON. Because, more's the pity, I had no reason forbelieving in your faint!LULU. {Making fun of him.) You couldn't bear itany longer out there?SCHON. Because I had to bring home to you what youare and to whom you are not to look up.LULU. You were afraid, though, that my legs mighthave been seriously injured?SCHON. I know too well you are indestructible.LULU. So you know that? SCHON. ( Bursting out.) Don't look at me so im- pudently !LULU. No one is keeping you here.SCHON. I'm going as soon as the bell rings.LULU. As soon as you have the energy! Where isyour energy? You have been engaged three years. Whydon't you marry? You recognize no obstacles. Why doyou want to put the blame on me? You ordered me tomarry Dr. Goll: I forced Dr. Goll to marry me. Youordered me to marry the painter: I made the best of abad bargain. Artists are your creatures, princes yourproteges. Why don't you marry?SCHON. {Raging.) Do you imagine you stand inthe way?LULU. {From here to the end of the act triumphant.)If you knew how happy your rage is making me! Howproud I am that you should humble me by every meansin your power! You debase me as deep—as deep as awoman can be debased, for you hope you can then jumpover me easier. But you have suffered unspeakably your- self from everything you just said to me. I see it in you.Already you are near the end of your self-command. Go!For your innocent fiancee's sake, leave me alone! Oneminute more, your mood will change around and you'llmake a scene with me of another kind, that you can'tanswer for now.SCHON. I fear you no longer.LULU. Me? Fear yourself! I do not need you. Ibeg you to go! Don't give me the blame. You knowI don't need to faint to destroy your future. You haveunlimited confidence in my honorableness. You believenot only that I'm an ensnaring daughter of Eve; youbelieve, too, that I'm a very good-natured creature. lam neither the one nor the other. Your misfortune is onlythat you think I am.SCHON. ( Desperate.) Leave my thoughts alone!You have two men under the sod. Take the prince,dance him into the earth! lam thru with you. I knowwhen the angel in you stops off and the devil begins. IfI take the world as it's made, the Creator must be re- sponsible, not I! To me life is not an amusement!LULU. And, therefore, you make claims on life greaterthan anyone can make. Tell me, who of us two is morefull of claims and demands, you or I ?SCHON. Be silent! I don't know how or what I think.When I hear you, I don't think any more. In a weekI'll be married. I conjure you, by the angel that is inyou, during that time come no more to my sight!LULU. I will lock my doors.SCHON. Go on and boast! God knows since I've beenwrestling with the world and with life I have cursed noone like you!LULU. That comes from my lowly origin.SCHON. From your depravity!LULU. With a thousand pleasures I take the blameon myself! You must feel clean now; you must thinkyourself a model of austerity now, a paragon of unflinch- ing principle! Otherwise you could never marry the childin her boundless inexperience—SCHON. Do you want me to grab you and—LULU. Yes! What must I say to make you? Notfor the world would I change with the innocent kid now!Tho the girl loves you as no woman has ever loved youyet!SCHON. Silence, beast! Silence! LULU. Marry her—and then she'll dance in her child- ish wretchedness before m y eyes, instead of I before hers!SCHON. (Raising his fists.) God forgive me—LULU. Strike me! Where is your riding-whip ? Strikeme on the legs—SCHON. ( Grasping his temples.) Away, away!( Rushes to the door, recollects himself, turns around.)Can Igo before the girl now, this way? Home!LULU. Be a man! Look yourself in the face once:—you have no trace of a conscience; you are frightenedat no wickedness; in the most cold-blooded way you meanto make the girl that loves you unhappy; you conquerhalf the world; you do what you please;—and you knowas well as I that—SCHON. ( Sunk in the chair, right centre, utterly ex- hausted.) Stop!LULU. That you are too weak—to tear yourself awayfrom me.SCHON. {Groaning.) Oh! Oh! You make meweep.LULU. This moment makes m e I cannot tell youhow glad.SCHON. My age! My position!LULU. He cries like a child—the terrible man ofmight!

But now go, please. You are nothing morenow to me.SCHON. I cannot go to her.LULU. Out with you. Come back to me when youhave regained your strength again. SCHON.

CURTAIN ACT IV A splendid hall in German Renaissance style, with athick floor of oak-blocks. The lower half of the wallsof dark carved wood; the upper half on both sides hungwith faded Gobelins. At rear, a curtained gallery fromwhich a monumental stair-case leads, right, half-way downthe stage. At centre, under the gallery, the entrance-door,with twisted posts and pediment. At left, a high andspacious fire-place with a Chinese folding screen before it.Further down, left, a French window onto awith heavy curtains, closed. Down right, door hung withGenoese velvet. Near it, a broad ottoman, with a chairon its left. Behind, near the foot of the stairs, Pier- rot-picture on a decorative stand and in a gold frame madeto look antique. In the centre of the hall, a heavy squaretable, with three high-backed upholstered chairs round itand a vase of white flowers on it.Countess Geschwitz sits on the ottoman, in a soldier-like,fur-trimmed waist, high, upright collar, enormous cuff- links, a veil over her face and her hands clasped con- vulsively in her muff. Schon stands down right. Lulu,in a big-flowered morning-dress, her hair in a simple knotin a golden circlet, sits in the arm-chair left of the ottoman.GESCHWITZ. You can't think how glad I shall be to seeyou at our artists' ball. (To Lulu.)SCHON. Is there no sort of possibility of a person likeme smuggling in?GESCHWITZ. It would be high treason if any of us lentherself to such an intrigue. SCHON. (Crossing to the centre table, behind the otto- man.) The glorious flowers!LULU. Fraulein von Geschwitz brought me those.GESCHWITZ. Don't mention it. Oh, you'll be in man'scostume, won't you?LULU. Do you think that becomes me?GESCHWITZ. You're a dream here. (Signifying thepicture.)LULU. My husband doesn't like it.GESCHWITZ. Is it by a local man?LULU. You will hardly have known him.GESCHWITZ. No longer living?SCHON. ( Down left, with a deep voice.) He hadenough.LULU. You're in bad temper. ( controls him- self. )GESCHWITZ. (Getting up.) I must go, Mrs. Schon.I can't stay any longer. This evening we have life- class, and I have still so much to get ready for the ball.Good-bye, Dr. Schon. {Exit, up-stage. Lulu accompaniesher. Schon looks around him.)SCHON. Pure Augean stable. That, the end of my life.They ought to show me a corner that's still clean. Thepest in the house. The poorest day-laborer has his tidynest. Thirty years' work, and this my family circle, thecircle of my people— {Glancing round.) God knowswho is overhearing me again now! {Draws a revolverfrom his breast pocket.) Man is, indeed, uncertain of hislife! {The cocked revolver in his right hand, he goesleft and speaks at the closed window curtains.) That,my family circle! The fellow still has courage! Shall Inot rather shoot myself in the head ? Against deadlyenemies one fights, but the— {Throws up the curtains, but finds no one hidden behind them.) The dirt—thedirt. . . . ( Shakes his head and crosses right.) Insanityhas already conquered my reason, or else—exceptions provethe rule! ( Hearing Lulu coming he puts the revolverback in his pocket. Lulu comes down right.)LULU. Couldn't you get away for this afternoon?SCHON. Just what did that Countess want?LULU. I don't know. She wants to paint me.SCHON. Misfortune in human guise, that waits uponone.LULU. Couldn't you get away, then? I would solike to drive thru the grounds with you.SCHON. Just the day when I must be at the exchange.You know that I'm not free to-day. All my propertyis drifting on the waves.LULU. I'd sooner be dead and buried than let my lifebe embittered so by my property.SCHON. Who takes life lightly does not take deathhard.LULU. As a child I always had the most horrible fearof death.SCHON. That is just why I married you.LULU. (With her arms round his neck.) You're inbad humor. You give yourself too much work. Forweeks and months I've seen nothing of you.SCHON. (Stroking her hair.) Your light-heartednessshould cheer up my old days.LULU. Indeed, you didn't marry me at all.SCHON. Who else did I marry then?LULU. I married you!SCHON. How does that alter anything?LULU. I was always afraid it would alter a great deal.SCHON. It has, indeed, crushed a great deal underfoot. LULU. But not one thing, praise God!SCHON. Of that I should be covetous.LULU. Your love for me. {Schon s face twitches, hesigns to her to go out in front of him. Both exeunt lowerright. Countess Geschwitz cautiously opens the rear door,ventures forth, and listens. Hearing voices approaching inthe gallery above her, she starts suddenly.)GESCHWITZ. Oh dear, there's somebody— {Hidesbehind the fire-screen.)SCHIGOLCH. {Steps out from the curtains onto thestairs, turns back.) Has the youngster left his heart be- hind him in the "Nightlight" cafe?RODRIGO. {Between the curtains.) He is still toosmall for the great world, and can't walk so far on footyet. (He disappears.)SCHIGOLCH. {Coming down the stairs.) God bethanked we're home again at last! What damned skunkhas waxed the stairs again? If I have to have my jointsset in plaster again before being called home, she canjust present me between the palms here to her relations asthe Venus de' Medici. Nothing but steep rocks andstumbling blocks!RODRIGO. {Comes down the stairs, carrying Hugenbergin his arms.) This thing has a royal police-captain for afather and not as much courage in his body as the rag- gedest hobo!HUGENBERG. If there was nothing more to it than lifeand death, then you'd soon learn to know me!RODRIGO. Even with his lover's woe, little brotherdon't weigh more than sixty kilos. I'll let myself behung on that statement any time.SCHIGOLCH. Throw him up to the ceiling and catch him by the feet. That'll whip his young blood into theproper rhythm right from the start.HUGENBERG. ( Kicking his legs.) Hooray, hooray, Ishall be expelled from school!RODRIGO. (Setting him down at the foot of the stairs.)You've never been to any sensible school at all yet.SCHIGOLCH. Here many a man has already won hisspurs. Only, no timidity! First, I'll set before you adrop of what can't be had anywhere for money. (a cupboard under the stairs.)HUGENBERG. Now if she doesn't come dancing in onthe instant, I'll wallop you two so you'll still rub yourtails in the hereafter.RODRIGO. ( Seated left of the table.) The strongestman in the world little brother will wallop! Let mammaput long trowsers on you first. (Hugenberg sits oppositehim.)HUGENBERG. I'd rather you lent me your mustache.RODRIGO. Maybe you want her to throw you out ofthe door straight off?HUGENBERG. If I only knew now what the devil Iwas going to say to her!RODRIGO. That she knows best herself.SCHIGOLCH. ( Putting two bottles and three glasses onthe table.) I started in on one of them yesterday. (Fillsthe glasses.)RODRIGO. ( Guarding Hugenberg's.) Don't give himtoo much, or we'll both have to pay for it.SCHIGOLCH. ( Supporting himself with both hands onthe table-top.) Will the gentlemen smoke?HUGENBERG. {Opening his cigarette case.) Havana- imported ! RODRIGO. (Helping himself.) From papa police- captain ?SCHIGOLCH. {Sitting.) Everything in the house ismine. You only need to ask.HUGENBERG. I made a poem to her yesterday.RODRIGO. What did you make to her?SCHIGOLCH. What did he make to her?HUGENBERG. A poem.RODRIGO. {To Schigolch.) A poem.SCHIGOLCH. He's promised me a dollar if I can spy outwhere he can meet her alone.HUGENBERG. Just who does live here?RODRIGO. Here we live!SCHIGOLCH. Jour fix—every stock-market day! Ourhealth. {They clink.)HUGENBERG. Should I read it to her first, maybe?SCHIGOLCH. {To Rodrigo.) What's he mean?RODRIGO. His poem. He'd like to stretch her out andtorture her a little first.SCHIGOLCH. {Staring at Hugenberg.) His eyes! Hiseyes!RODRIGO. His eyes, yes. They've robbed her of sleepfor a week.SCHIGOLCH. {To Rodrigo.) You can have yourselfpickled.RODRIGO. We can both have ourselves pickled! Ourhealth, gossip Death!SCHIGOLCH. {Clinking with him.) Health, jack-in- the-box! If it's still better later on, I'm ready for de- parture at any moment; but—but— {Lulu enters right,in an elegant Parisian ball-dress, much decollete, withflowers in breast and hair.)LULU. But children, children, I expect company! SCHIGOLCH. But I can tell you what, those things must/cost something over there! { has risen. Lulusits on the arm of his chair.)LULU. You've fallen into pretty company! I expectvisitors, children!SCHIGOLCH. I guess I've got to stick something inthere, too. {He searches among the flowers on the table.)LULU. Do I look well ?SCHIGOLCH. What are those you've got there?LULU. Orchids. {Bending over Hugenberg.) Smell.RODRIGO. Do you expect Prince Escerny?LULU. {Shaking her head.) God forbid!RODRIGO. So somebody else again—!LULU. The prince has gone traveling.RODRIGO. To put his kingdom up for auction?LULU. He's spying out a fresh tribe in the neighbor- hood of Africa. {Rises, hurries up the stairs, and stepsinto the gallery.)RODRIGO. {To Schigolch.) He wanted to marry heroriginally.SCHIGOLCH. {Sticking a lily in his button-hole.) I,too, wanted to marry her originally.RODRIGO. You wanted to marry her originally?SCHIGOLCH. Didn't you, too, want to marry heroriginally ?RODRIGO. You bet I wanted to marry her originally!SCHIGOLCH. Who has not wanted to marry her orig- inally !!RODRIGO. I would never have got a better!SCHIGOLCH. She has let no one regret that he didn'tmarry her.RODRIGO. Then she's not your child?SCHIGOLCH. Never occurs to her. HUGENBERG. What is her father's name then?SCHIGOLCH. She has boasted of me!HUGENBERG. What is her father's name then?SCHIGOLCH. What's he say?RODRIGO. What her father's name is.SCHIGOLCH. She never had one.LULU. ( Comes down from gallery and sits againon Hugenberg'schair-arm.) What have I never had?ALL THREE. A father.LULU. Yes, sure—I'm a wonder-child. {To Hugen- berg.) How are you getting along with your father?RODRIGO. He smokes a respectable cigar, anyway, thepolice-captain.SCHIGOLCH. Have you locked up upstairs?LULU. There is the key.SCHIGOLCH. Better have left it in the lock.LULU. Why?SCHIGOLCH. So no one can unlock it from outside.RODRIGO. Isn't he at the stock-exchange?LULU. Oh, yes, but he suffers from persecution-mania.RODRIGO. I take him by the feet, and yup!—there hestays sticking to the roof.LULU. He hunts you into a mouse-hole with the cor- ner of his eye.RODRIGO. What does he hunt? Who does he hunt?\{Baring his arm.) Just look at this biceps!LULU. Show me. {Goes left.)RODRIGO. {Hitting himself on the muscle.)

(Takes it and dragshimself up the stairs.)LULU. {Hugenberg having slid under the table.)Show him in!HUGENBERG. ( Under the front edge of the table-cloth,listening; to himself.) If he doesn't stay—we'll be alone.LULU. {Poking him with her toe.) Sh! {Hugenbergdisappears. Alva is shown in by Ferdinand.)ALVA. {ln evening dress.)

Wholly unknown to me.LULU. They were in the campaign together. He's aw- fully badly—ALVA. Is my father here then?LULU. He drank a glass with him. He had to go tothe stock market. We'll have lunch before we go, won'twe?ALVA. When does it begin?LULU. After two. {Alva still follows Schigolch withhis eyes.) How do you like me? {Schigolch disappearsthru the gallery.)ALVA. Had I not better be silent to you on that point ?LULU. I only mean my appearance.ALVA. Your dressmaker manifestly knows you betterthan I may permit myself to know you.LULU. When I saw myself in the glass I could havewished to be a man—my man!—ALVA. You seem to envy your man the joy you offer to him. (Lulu is at the right, Alva at the left, of thecentre table. He regards her with shy satisfaction. Ferdi- nand enters, rear, covers the table and lays tivo plates, etc.,a bottle of Pommery, and hors A oeuvres.) Have you atoothache?LULU. ( Across to Alva.) Don't.FERDINAND. Doctor Schon-. . .?ALVA. He seems so puckered-up and tearful to-day.FERDINAND. ( Thru his teeth.) One is only a manafter all. (Exit.)LULU. (When both are seated.) What I alwaysthink most highly of in you is your firmness of character.You're so perfectly sure of yourself. Even when you musthave been afraid of quarreling with your father about it,you always stood up for me like a brother just the same.ALVA. Let's drop that. It's just my fate— (Movesto lift up the table-cloth in front.)LULU. (Quickly.) That was me.ALVA. Impossible! It's just my fate, with the mostfrivolous ideas always to seize on the best.LULU. You deceive yourself if you make yourself outworse than you are.ALVA. Why do you flatter me so? It is true thatperhaps there is no man living, so bad as I—who hasbrought about so much good.LULU. In any case you're the only man in the worldwho's protected me without lowering me in my own eyes!ALVA. DO you think that so easy? (Schon appears inthe gallery cautiously parting the hangings between themiddle pillars. He starts, and whispers, "My own son!")With gifts from God like yours, one turns those aroundone to criminals without ever dreaming of it. I, too, am only flesh and blood, and if we hadn't grown up with eachother like brother and sister—LULU. That's why, too, I give myself to you alonequite without reserve. From you I have nothing to fear.ALVA. I assure you there are moments when one ex- pects to see one's whole inner self cave in. The more self- restraint a man loads onto himself, the easier he breaksdown. Nothing will save him from that except— (Stopsto look under the table.)LULU. {Quickly.) What are you looking for?ALVA. I conjure you, let me keep my confession offaith to myself! As an inviolable sanctity you were moreto me than with all your gifts you could be to anyone elsein your life!LULU. How do you come to think on that so entirelydifferently from your father? (changes the plates and serves broiled chicken with salad.)ALVA. {To him.) Are you sick?LULU. {To Alva.) Let him be!ALVA.

What sort of moments are those of which youspoke, where one expects to see his whole inner selftumble in?ALVA. I didn't want to speak of them. I shouldnot like to lose, in joking over a glass of champagne,what has been my highest happiness for ten years. LULU. I have hurt you. I won't begin on that again.ALVA. Do you promise me that for always?LULU. My hand on it. ( her hand acrossthe table. Alva takes it hesitatgrips it in andpresses it long and ardently to his lips.) What are youdoing. ( Rodrigosticks his head out from the curtains,left. Lulu darts an angry look at him across Alva, andhe draws back.)SCHON. ( Whispering from the gallery.) And thereis still another!ALVA.

You?—you are as heavenly high above me as—as the sun is over the abyss! {Kneeling.) Destroy me!I beg you, put an end to me! Put an end to me!LULU. Do you love me then? ALVA. I will pay you with everything that was mine!LULU. Do you love me?ALVA. Do you love me—Mignon?LULU. I? Not a soul.ALVA. I love you. ( Hides face in her lap.)LULU. ( Both hands in his hair.) I poisoned yourmother— ( Rodrigosticks his head out from the cur- tains, left, sees Schon sitting in the gallery and signs tohim to watch Lulu and Alva. Schon points his revolverat Rodrigo; Rodrigo signs to him to point it at Alva.Schon cocks the revolver and takes aim. Rodrigo drawsback behind the curtains. Lulu sees him draw back, seesSchon sitting in the gallery, and gets up.) His father!( Schon rises, lets the hangings fall before him. Alva re- mains motionless on his knees. Pause.)SCHON. ( Holding a paper in his hand, takes Alva bythe shoulder.) Alva! ( Alva gets up as though drunkwith sleep.) A revolution has broken out in Paris.ALVA. To Paris ... let me go to Paris—SCHON. In the editors' room they're beating their headsagainst the wall. No one knows what he ought to write.( He unfolds the paper and accompanies Alva out, rear.Rodrigo rushes out from the curtains toward the stairs.)LULU. ( Barring his way.) You can't get out here.RODRIGO. Let me through!LULU. You'll run into his arms.RODRIGO. He'll shoot me thru the head!LULU. He's coming.RODRIGO. (Stumbling back.) Devil, death and de- mons! ( Lifts the table-cloth.)HUGENBERG. No room!RODRIGO. Damned and done for! (Looks around andhides in the door-way, right.) SCHON. (Comes in, centre; locks the door; and goes,revolver in hand, to the window down left, of which hethrows up the curtains.) Where is he gone?LULU. {On the lowest step.) Out.SCHON. Down over the balcony?LULU. He's an acrobat.✓ \SCHON. That could not be foreseen. {Turningagainst Lulu.) You who drag me thru the muck of thestreets to a tortured death!LULU. Why did you not bring me up better?SCHON. You destroying angel!

You hangman's noose!LULU. {ln cold blood.) Oh, shut up, and kill me!SCHON. Everything I possess I have made over to you,and asked nothing but the respect that every servant paysto my house. Your credit is exhausted!LULU I can answer for my reckoning still for years.{Coming forward from the stairs.) How do you like mynew gown?SCHON. Away with you, or my brains will give wayto-morrow and my son swim in his own blood! Youinfect me like an incurable pest in which I shall groan awaythe rest of my life. I will cure myself! Do youunderstand? {Pressing the revolver on her.) This isyour physic. Don't break down; don't kneel! You your- self shall apply it. You or I—which is the weaker?{Lulu, her strength threatening to desert her, has sunkdown on the couch. Turning the revolver this way andthat.)LULU. It doesn't go off. SCHON. Do you still remember how I tore you out ofthe clutches of the police?LULU. You have much confidence—SCHON. Because I'm not afraid of a street-girl? ShallI guide your hand for you? Have you no mercy towardsyourself? ( Lulu points the revolver at him.) No falsealarms! ( Lulu fires a shot into the ceiling. Rodrigosprings out of the pcrrtieres, up the stairs and away thruthe gallery.) What was that?LULU. ( Innocently.) Nothing.SCHON. ( Lifting the portieres.) What flew out ofhere?LULU. You're suffering from persecution-mania.SCHON. Have you got still more men hidden here?( Tearing the revolver from her.) Is yet another mancalling on you? (Going left.) I'll regale your men!( Throws up the window curtains, flings the fire-screenback, grabs Countess Geschwitz by the collar and dragsher forward.) Did you come down the chimney?GESCHWITZ. {ln deadly terror, to Lulu.) Save mefrom him!SCHON. {Shaking her.) Or are you, too, an acrobat?GFSCHWITZ. {Whimpering.) You hurt me.SCHON. {Shaking her.) Now you will have tostay to dinner. {Drags her right, shoves her into the nextroom and locks the door after her.) We want no town- criers. {Sits next Lulu and makes her take the revolveragain.) There's still enough for you in it. Look at me!I cannot assist the coachman in my house to decoratemy forehead for me. Look at me! I pay my coachman.Look at me! Am I doing the coachman a favor when%I can't stand the stable-stench? LULU. Have the carriage got ready! Please! We'regoing to the opera.SCHON. We're going to the devil! Now lam coach- man. ( Turning the revolver in her hand from himselfto Lulus breast.) Think you we let ourselves be mis- treated as you mistreat me, and hesitate between a galley- slave's shame at the end of life and the merit of freeingthe world of you? (Holds her down by the arm.)Come, get through. It will be the gladdest remembranceof my life. Pull the trigger!LULU. You can get a divorce.SCHON. Only that was left! In order that to-morrowthe next man may find his pastime where I have shud- dered from cleft to chasm, suicide upon me and thoubefore me! You dare suggest that? That part of mylife I have poured into you I am to see thrown beforewild beasts? Do you see your bed with the sacrifice—thevictim—on it? The boy is homesick for you. Did youlet yourself be divorced? You trod him under your feet,knocked out his brains, caught up his blood in gold-pieces.I let myself be divorced ? Can one be divorced when twopeople have grown into each other and half the man mustgo, too? (Reaching for the revolver.) Give it here!LULU. Don't!SCHON. I'll spare you the trouble.LULU. ( Tears herself loose, holding the revolverdown; in a determined, self-possessed tone.) If men havekilled themselves for my sake, that doesn't lower my value.You know as well why you made me your wife as I knewwhy I took you for husband. You had deceived your bestfriends with me; you could not well go on deceiving your- self with me. If you bring me the close of your life as asacrifice, still you have had my whole youth for it. You understand ten times better than I do which is the morevaluable. I have never in the world wished to seem to beanything different from what I am taken for, and I havenever in the world been taken for anything different fromwhat I am. You want to force me to fire a bullet intomy heart. I'm not sixteen any more, but to fire a bulletin my heart I am still much too young!SCHON. ( Pursuing her.) Down, murderess! Downwith you! To your knees, murderess! ( herto the foot of the stairs.) Down, and never dare to standagain! ( Raising his hand. Lulu has sunk to her knees.)Pray to God, murderess, that he give you strength. Sueto heaven that strength for it may be lent you! (berg jumps up from under the knocking a chaiiasidej and screams "Help!" Schon whirls toward him,turning his back to Lulu who instantly fires five shots intohim and continues to pull the trigger. Schon, totteringover, is caught by Hugenberg and let down in the chair.)SCHON. And—there—lS—one—more—LULU. ( Rushing to Schon.) All merciful—!SCHON. Out of my sight! Alva!LULU. {Kneeling.) The one man I loved!SCHON. Harlot! Murderess! Alva! Alva! Water!LULU. Water; he's thirsty. {Fills a glass with cham- pagne and sets it to Schon s lips. Alva comes thru thegallery, down the stairs.)ALVA. Father! O God, my father!LULU. I shot him.HUGENBERG. She is innocent!SCHON. {To Alva.) You! It miscarried.ALVA. {Tries to lift him.) You must go to bed;come.SCHON. Don't take me so! I'm drying up. {Lulu comes with the champagne-cup; to her.) You are still likeyourself. ( After drinking.) Don't let her escape. {ToAlva.) You are the next.ALVA. {To Hugenberg.) Help me carry him to bed.SCHON. No, no, please, no. Wine, murderess—ALVA. {To Hugenberg.) Take him up that side.{Pointing right.) Into the bed-room. {They lift Schonupright and lead him right. Lulu stays near the table,the glass in her hand.)SCHON. {Groaning.) O God! O God! O God!{Alva finds the door locked, turns the key and opens it.Countess Geschwitz steps out. Schon at the sight of herstraighten up, stiffly.) The Devil. {He falls backwardonto the carpet. Lulu throws herself down, takes his headin her lap, and kisses him.)LULU. He has got over it. (Gets up and starts towardthe stairs.)ALVA. Don't stir!GESCHWITZ. I thought it was you.LULU. {Throwing herself before Alva.) You can'tgive me up to the law! It is m y head that is struck off.I shot him because he was about to shoot me. I haveloved nobody in the world but him! Alva, demand whatyou will, only don't let me fall into the hands of justice.Take pity on me. lam still young. I will be true to youas long as I live.
