Gourmont in hisSonnets Ã  l Amazone A man hurls himself toward the infinite and the works of art are his vestigeshis trace in the manifestIt is perhaps no more impossible to give a vague idea of Brancusi s sculpture in words than to give it in photographsbut it is equally impossible to give an exact sculptural idea in either words or photographyTJEverets has made the best summary of our contemporary aesthetics that I knowin his sentenceA work of art has in it no idea which is separable from the form I believe this conviction can be found in earlier vorticist explanationsand in a world where so few people have yet dissociated form from representationone mayor at least I may as well approach Brancusi via the formulations by GaudierBrzeskaor by myself in my study of Gaudier Sculptural feeling is the appreciation or masses in relationSculptural ability is the defining of these masses by planesEvery conceptevery emotion presents itself to the vivid consciousnes in some primary formIt belongs to the art of that form I don t mean to imply that vorticist formulae willsatisfyBrancusior that any formula need ever satisfy any artistsimply the formulae give me certain axesplural of axisnot of axfor discriminationI have foundto datenothing in vorticist formulae which contradicts the work of Brancusithe formulae left every man fairly freeGaudier had long since revolted from the Rodin Maillol mixtureno one who understood Gaudier was fooled by the cheap Viennese Michaelangelism and rhetoric of MestrovicOne understood thatWorks of art attract by a resembling un3 likeness thatThe beauty of form in the still stone can not be the same beauty of form as that in the living animal One even understood thatas in Gaudier s brown stone dancerthe pure or unadulterated motifs of the circle and triangle have a right to build up their own fugue or sonata in formas a theme in music has its right to express itselfNo critic has a right to pretend that he fully understands any artistleast of all do I pretendin this noteto understand Brancusiafter a few weeks acquaintanceeven as well as I understood Gaudierafter several yearsfriendship anything I say here effaces anything I may have said before on the subjectand anything I say the week after next effaces what I say here a pale reflection of Brancusi s general wish that people would wait until he has finishedie in the cemetarybefore they talk aesthetics with or about himAt best one could but clear away a few grosser misconceptionsGaudier had discriminated against beefy statueshe had given us a very definite appreciation of stone as stonehe had taught us to feel that the beauty of sculpture is inseparable from its material and that it inheres in the materialBrancusi was giving up the facile success of representative sculpture about the time Gaudier was giving up his baby bottlein many ways his difference from Gaudier is a difference merely of degreehe has had time to make statues where Gaudier had time only to make sketchesGaudier had purged himself of every kind of rhetoric he had noticedBrancusi has detected more kinds of rhetoric and continued the process of purgationWhen verbally intelligible he is quite definite in the statement that whatever else art is it is notcrise des nerfs that beauty is not grimaces and fortuitous gesturesthat starting with an ideal of form one arrives at a mathematical exactitude of proportionbut not by mathematicsAbove all he is a man in love with perfectionDante believed in themelody which most in centres the soul in the preface to my Guido I have tried to express the idea of an absolute rhythmor the possibility of itPerhaps every artist at one time or another believes in a sort of elixir or philosopher s stone produced by the sheer perfection of his artby the alchemical X sublimation of the mediumthe elimination of accidentals and imperfectionsWhere Gaudier had developed a sort of form fugue or formsonata by a combination of formsBrancusi has set out on the maddeningly more difficult exploration toward getting all the forms into one formthis is as long as any Buddhist s contemplation of the universe or as any mediaeval saint s contemplation of the divine loveas long and even as paradoxical as the final remarks in the Divina CommediaIt is a search easily begunand wholly unendingand the vestiges are let us say Brancusi sBird and there is perhaps six monthswork and twenty yearsknowledge between one model of the erect bird and anotherthough they appear identical in photographyTherein consisting the difference between sculpture and sketchesPlate No5 shows what looks like an eggI give more photos of the bust than of this egg because in the photos the egg comes to nothingin Plate No12 there is at the base of the chimaera an egg with a plane and a groove cut into itan egg having infantile rotundities and reposeI don t know by what metaphorical periphrase I am to convey the relation of these ovoids to Brancusi s other sculptureAs an interim labelone might consider them as master keys to the world of form nothisworld of formbut as much as he has found oftheworld of formThey contain or implyor shouldthe triangle and the circleOr putting it another wayevery one of the thousand angles of approach to a statue ought to be interestingit ought to have a lifeBrancusi might perhaps permit me to say adivinelifeof its own Any prenticecan supposedly make a statue that will catch the eye and be interesting from some angleThis last statement is not strictly truethe present condition of sculptural sense leaving us with a vastly lower level both of prentises andgreat sculptors but even the strictest worshipper of bad art will admit that it is infinitely easier to make a statue which can please from one side than to make one which gives satisfaction from no matter what angle of visionIt is also conceivably more difficult to give this formal satisfaction by a single massor let us say to sustain the formal5 interest by a single massthan to excite transient visual interests by more monumental and melodramatic combinationsBrancusi s revolt against the rhetorical and the kolossal has carried him into revolt against the monumentalor at least what appears to befor the instanta revolt against one sort of solidityThe research for the aerial has produced his bird which stands unsupported upon its diminished basethe best of jade carvers and netsuke makers produce tiny objects which also maintain themselves on extremely minute foundationsIf I say that Brancusi s ideal form should be equally interesting from all anglesthis does not quite imply that one should stand the ideal temple on its headbut it probably implies a discontent with any combination of proportions which can t be conceived as beautiful even ifin the case of a templesome earth quake should stand it up intact and end ways or turned turtleHere I think the concept differs from Gaudier sas indubitably the metaphysic of Brancusi is outside and unrelated to vorticist manners of thinkingThe great black stone egyptian patera in the British museum is perhaps more formally interesting than the statues of MemnonIn the case of the ovoidI take it Brancusi is meditating upon pure form free from all terrestrial gravitationform as free in its own life as the form of the analytic geometersand the measure of his success in this experimentunfinished and probably unfinishableis that from some angles at least the ovoid does come to life and appear ready to levitate Or this is perhaps merely a fortuitous anecdotelike any other expression Crystal gazing NoAdmitting the possibility of selfhypnosis by means of highly polished brass surfacesthe polishfrom the sculptural point of viewresults merely from a desire for greater precision of the formit is also a transient gloryBut the contemplation of form or of formal beauty leading into the infinite must be dissociated from the dazzle of crystalthere is a sort of relationbut there is the more important divergencewith the crystal it is a hypnosisor a contemplative fixation of thoughtor an excitement of thesub consciousor unconsciouswhatever the devil they may be and with the ideal form in 6 marble it is an approach to the infinite by formby precisely the highest possible degree of consciousness of formal perfectionas free of accident as any of the philosophical demands of aParadisocan make itThis is not a suggestion that all sculpture should end in the making of abstract ovoidsindeed no one but a genius wholly centred in his artand more or lessorientalcould endure the strain of such effortBut if we are ever to have a bearable sculpture or architecture it might be well for young sculptors to start with some such effort at perfectionrather than with the idea of a new Laocoonor aTriumph of Labour over CommerceThis suggestion is mineand I hope it will never fall under the eye of Brancusi But then Brancusi can spend most of his time in his own studiosurrounded by the calm of his own creationswhereas the author of this imperfect exposure is compelled to move about in a world full of junk shopsa world full of more than idiotic ornamentationsa world where pictures are made for museumswhere no man has a front door that he can bear to look atlet alone one he can contemplate with reasonable pleasurewhere the average house is each year made more hideousand where the sense of form which ought to be as general as the sense of refreshment after a bathor the pleasure of liquid in time of drouth or any other clear animal pleasureis the rare possession of anintellectual heaven help us aristocracy EZRA POUND7EIN GESANG ISABEL du schwarzer Pyjama Draussen die Welt klingt von den Kronen Gottes Auf den Zwillingen spielen verlassene Mandolin en Ausser dir Und ausser mir WÃ¤re die Welt nicht mehr mÃ¶glich Aber doch kann ein Baum der Felsschlucht mit der grÃ¼nen Seele sich nach uns tasten Eine Trambahn drÃ¼ben am

Misanthrop aus Menschenliebe Das Wort Barrikade ist ultramarinblau und gefÃ¤llt mir sehr Ich sah einen Bettler auf den Fortifikationen Ein gelber gestohlener Fischhing wie ein Bart von seinem sauren

to replace the cataclysmic factor in social evolution WARAn absoluteconstructive and liberating ideal put to the will of mankind for acceptance or rejectionPsycho democracy is Democracy of The Spiritgovernment by creative imaginationparticipation in essential wisdom Fraternity of Intuitionthe Intellect and Mother wit The Creatorthe scholarthe natural man A psychological gauge applied to all social problemsfor the interpretation of politicalreligious and financial systemsDemocratic interchange and valuation of ideas14 The Substitution of consciously directed evolution for revolutionCreative inspiration for ForceLaughter for LethargySociability for SociologyHuman psychology for TraditionThe Psycho Democratic Policy is Habeas Animum To illuminate the earth with her peoples eyes The organization of Psycho Democracy is based on the laws of psychic evolutionour principles spring from Intuitionand are presented to man s intellect for maturationWe make the experiment of acollectivitymoved by the same intellectual logic as are the tactics of the successful individual reckoning withactualvalues and following the rules of the game of lifeinfluencing our era by right of the merits of ourcollectivepersonalityMost movements have a fixed concept towards which they advancewe move away from all fixed concepts in order to advanceThe Psycho democrat is ManWoman or Child of good sense and with imaginationhaving a normal love of Life and a sympathie indifference to their neighbours obligationsThe living successor of that travesty of manthe Dummy Public originated by the Pressfinanced by the CapitalistFor whom the politician legislatesThe army fightsThe church collectsTHE IDEA FABRIC OF HUMAN SOCIETYModern social existence is a form of psychic activity based on Ideas promoted by the self conscious minority of PowerEvery phase in evolution has been marked by the different kinds of ideas for which men tortured one anotherSociety today is composed of distinctly different human strataheirs of the different ideas for which men tortured one another15 The Tediousness of Human Evolution is owingTo the tendency of ideas to outlast their originiethe tendency of human institutions to outlast the psychological conditions from which they arosePsycho Democracy considers social institutions as structural forms in collective consciousness which are subject to the same evolutional transformation as is collective consciousness itselfand that our social institutions of today will cause future generations to roar with laughterCriminal Lunacy In the very near future the fact that it is considered either normal or necessary for millions of men and women to wear out their organisms with no reward but the maintainance of those organismsimperfectly functioningand that this social condition should be safeguarded and preserved by the blowing up of other millions of human organisms will appear as the nightmare of a criminal lunaticCosmic Neurosis The destructive element in collective consciousness induced by inhibitive social and religious precepts that ordain that man must suffer and cause to suffer and deny the validity of Man s fundamental desireshas resulted in Cosmic Neurosiswhose major symptom is FearThis fear takes the form of international suspicion and the resulting national protective phobiasOur enlightened psychological principles will put an end to Cosmic NeurosisPsychic Evolution This thing called Life which seems to be the impact of luminous bodiesknocking sparks off one another in chaoswill be transformed through Psycho Democratic evolution from a war between good and evilie between beneficent and painful chanceto a competition between different kinds of good beneficent spontaneities 16 1 2 3 4 The Paradox of the Dominator and the Dominated Classis a psychological conditionThe one class distinction is between the dominator and the dominatedEvery social upheaval has been the evolutional phenomenon of the recruiting of new material to the dominating classA class victory is never the promotion of one class to the status of another classbut the shifting of certain elements in the victorious class to the psychological condition of the dominating classThe dominating class is a psychological nucleus progressively absorbing all similar elements into itselfIt is therefore our important task to eludicate the psychology of the Dominatorfor the dominatedas the Basis of intrinsic democracyPower is a secret society of the minoritywhose hold on the majority lies in the esoteric or actual value of social ideasThis esoteric value is unrevealed to the majoritybeing 1The transmutability of the strategical ideas of the minority into social ideals for the majority2The value of social ideals as a means of conserving the majority as a plastic psychic material with which Power moulds the contours of its own supremacy3The value of the exoteric or public representation of social ideals as limiting the unit for the advantage of a collectivitywhile in reality insuring the advantage of the minority with the consent of the majorityThe ensuing confusion in the public mind between its innate logic and the social ideals dictated by the Dominatorprovides the Paradox of the Dominator and the Dominatedfor it is at once the vantage ground for the Dominator s tactics and the blind force which at recurrent intervals confounds the selfconscious minority of PowerPsycho Democratic Aesthetic The aethetic contour of a race is formed by its habitsMan s evolution through his circumstances has resulted in his point of view17 His point of view forms his habitsThe Dominator s standard has been the most highly evolved human habitTherefore class evolution must democratize the Dominator s standardwhich hitherto evolved by circumstanceswill in future spring directly intohabitout of apoint of view The Aim of Society is the Perfection of Self Man s desire is for SelfHis desire is commensurate with possibilityThe earth offers super abundance for AllHuman imagination is illimitablePsycho Democracy advocates the fulfilment of all Desire Selfis the covered entrance to InfinityMilitarism Militarism forms the nucleus of national Influential symbolismthe flagthe uniforminspires the Rhythm of national popular enthusiasmthe marchthe bandparadeSustains the belligerent masculine social idealLike all concentrated human forces it is psychically magneticIt has created certain formulae figuring largely in our social pleasureswhich no other social institution affordsthe inevitablesnobberythus involved insures its protracted successPacifism The sole opposition to this imposing and efficiently organized social foundation is the pacifist DontPacifism has not yet offered a creative substitute for the military idealbut a negative conception which leaves a void in social psychological constructionwithout providing any adequate suggestions as to how this void should be filledThe Appeal of psycho Democracy for the conscious direction of evolutionis an appeal to the thinkerthe scientistthe philosopherthe writerthe artistthe mechanicthe workerto join intelligent forces in a concerted effort to evolve and establish a new social symbolisma new social rhythma new social snobism with a human psychological significance of equal value to that of militarism18 To consider that the belligerent tendency in human nature which is at present abnormaly fostered by social institutions and educationcan be superseded by another of the different tendencies in human natureif developed through transformed social institutions and revised educationTo vindicate Humanity s claim to a Divine DestinyNot to endeavor to eliminate the indestructable forces in human nature but to establish a new social system for their utilizationTo present intellectual heroism as a popular ideal in place of physical heroism encouraging the expression of individual psychology in place of mob psychologyTo believe that man has the conceptual power to create a substitute for warhaving the same stimulus to action as the hazard of deaththe same spur to renassence as devastationand that his mentality will evolve new forms of expressive action to inspire him to such ebullitions of enthusiasm as does the call to armsIn Psycho Democracy shall arise men and women whose strength and originality of conception will concrete a vital ideal as the basis of International politicsThis ideal which is in a nebulous stateonce defined will be easier to impose on humanity than the hypnotic war lustFor it is but logical to suppose that if the slight amount of magnetism in the make up of the world s leaders of todayis sufficient to rush great peoples on to death and agonyit will be a simple task to persuade great peoples to the effort of self realization in a life amplifying idealand to apply the force of reason to the solution of their life problemswhich have been so acutely aggravated by the force of explosivesAnd to dissuade Man from any longer considering his destiny as being extraneous to his logicMINA LOYBuenos Aires191819FOUR POEMS FRANCISQUE FAIT LA CULBUTE bruit mouillÃ© des

he thought in the style of Wright as he paid attention to the smarting knucklesShe rearranged herselfwith no thought of a recovering henthe things that slipped by her She smells like a horse He added aloud Perhaps I should have brought Wright with me She stinks like a horseHow is it possible to love such a womanFor I can t lie out of itshe stinksBut I want her to stinkIt is my way of having my guts ooze outThat ought to cure me of herbut it doesn tBut this for consolationmy urge is at least proved to be straight lust Cynthia had answered something about Wrighthe would not ask her what it was I suppose I shouldn t resent these failures he began argumentatively We are still walking in our originsIt continues to be a matter of Apollo and Daphnewhere if women can t turn into laurel trees any longerthey turn into logsBut thenyou must not forget you are always open to the charge of being undersexedwhich is scandalous Both laughed Still as I sayyou are only acting within the nature of things if you resistBe as fair yourselfthenand admit that Itooam acting within the nature of things when I persist But what an ass to justify herHe should deplore her without endNever to weaken on the thingTo know that she must give inAnd never begin defending himselfit should go without saying that his position was fittingHe pointed upstairs Listenit s sistersand mothersend fathersGreat Godwhat

herkissing her at the doorWithin ten minutes Cynthia was undressedand had walked to the bathroom in her nightgownWassermann caught the subway to Times Square as Cynthia was brushing her teethWright to Wassermann The fact is that you simply must stick to this much adoIf you drop ityou have nothing leftTheI refuse to swallow any more of thatdo you understandFirst Cynthiaand then youit s too much for an eveningjust a Ii t t l e too muchYou and your composureboshYou say I am histrionicBut it never occurred to you that your immovable front is another symptom of the same diseaseIf I am a stagey neurasthenicthen you are a stagey StoicWait a minuteI am not fighting with youI am diagnosing youCynthia hears that sort of thing as long as you are with hercan t you listen to one sentence of it 26It isn t the diagnosis I object toit s the flatness of itYou say I have nothing but my agitationmy noise in other wordsWhat am I to answerYou simply kill all chance of discussion with a sentence like thatWhat are its meritsIs it astonishingIs it cleverIs it subtleIt just stands out there like a big face fat with a bad liverIf you want to penetrate meI am willing to listenI am anxious to listenin factBut if you re going to fling hunks of statement at me like mudpiesI want to make it clear that I am not interestedGo onI have said what I had to sayNo Wassermann snorted You re getting weakWrightif that s the best come back you haveOr I ve gone the length of youand am leaving you behindYou must have been frantic for a last word if you could grab at such a shabby little straw as that Wright said nothing Quite in characteryou say nothingThat is expected to wither meto dry me up and blow me awayBut this timeit doesn t Wright smiled encouraginglysaid nothing I ll give you creditthat worksIt gets on a man s nervesespecially a man like meIt would be highly admirableif it weren t so easy to applyAnother trouble with it is that it is inclined to become too patIt fits roughly in too many cases to be nicely adapted to any of themAnd in time it blunts a mansince it gets him into making a broad division of his sensationsthis thing I recognizethis thing I am silent aboutWith the final result that you become inarticulateYou forget how to carve neat slices off a big steaming ideaYou become no better than an amoebaapproaching what is pleasantand retreating from what is unpleasantwithout intelligent observationThere is a lot to what you sayWassermannBut I must be going nowif you ll let me leave without calling it a last bit of blunt techniqueThe fact is that I do have to goWe ll see each other tomorrow night A dirty way to defeat a manWright s going left him boundThe bile must drip back into his stomachand stay there poisoning him until tomorrow nightThey were monstersboth of themwith Cynthia a little worse because she was a womanand lovedThey 27 were two suns for him to race aroundthey stood stilland let him break his neckBut the devilwhat a superb martyrdom anyhowIf he saw thingsand simply had to say themit was worth seeing and saying them at any costNot so bad to be a victim of too much clarityHe was a fly eye Waiterwaiter The waiter came on

s leftand what s up and downclarity becomes a grave nuisanceIntelligence is a parasitic growthand saps the body like a cancerIt endangers the silver mediumThe brain was once a mere implement of the bodyfunctioning solely to add to the body s welfarelike the kidneysBut now it is threatening to usurp an entity of its ownIt demands certain foods and amusements which can be indulged in only at great inconvenience and often with dangerComme on pisse les chiensone must walk one s brainAnd it is still so youngthat one s attentions to it are frequently of a disgusting natureAnd soI have 30 stuffed my brain with richoozy claritywith the consequence that I can see every pore in every pore in every noseand catch the smell of every armpitAnd when you see that wayyou have two choicesyou can be either a dervish or a pigIf you re a dervishyou shrink from it alland drown yourself in denials and negationsand spend sinister years trying to rub the filth out of your carcassBut if on the other hand you see

These paintings are not especially novelthey arelet us sayrelated to the sort of thing Matisse was doing in 1911 12andin less degreeto KandinskyI could see in them no defectsand very possibly no

onEnglish Literature from Dryden to Addison youin extreme casesread Arnaut Daniel so as not to be overawed by a local editor who faces you with a condemnation in the phrasepaucity of rhyme The classics ancient and modern are precisely the acids to gnaw through the thongs and bulls hides with which we are tied by our schoolmasters41 They are the antisepticsThey are almost the only antiseptics against the contagious imbecility of mankindI can conceive an intelligence strong enough to exist without thembut I can not recall having met an incarnation of such intelligenceSome does

You are not sorryAnthonythat it is a girlI had a son and I lost himThat will do Ten dozenI m glad you feel like thatI m afraid my sister expected you to want a boyMelitta will get to know me better in timeYou will be patientAnthonyThere is a kind of patience less bearable than indignationOh wella sharp tongue like yours needs watchingBut now this little darling has comeWas it a difficult birthPerhaps worse than we expected her resistanceHer courage you meanDon t say thatShe is now sleeping quietlyI hope we shall see you often at RingsYou may be sureI set great store by her educationI

changeMrsAsheClavelhe s from the northhe do call her the wreckling of RingsWhat is a wrecklingOut of a litter of pigs the one that do dieShe was terribly frightenedIt s queer way these ladies are brought upDidn t know whether the child was coming out top or bottomI was sorry for herShe seemed to have nothing to fall back onWhat should she haveGreedy she was to be mistress of RingsLet it make her sick I sayIs MrAshe kind to herHe could melt a peach stonemaybe he s no teeth to chew an acornWell I expect there s her side to it if we only knew The two women left the nurseryThe red baby moved and then lay dark eyes opengathering life in pure form without constituent of pleasure or painBefore the beginningpast the endA fist stirred and a foot imperceptibly it took possession AnthonyI ve been staring at it all the afternoonWhat is the green hump on the lawnThere was a tower there onceYou can see stone sticking out of the turfIs that a bush growing on itIt seems a pity that it should break the green sweep to the seaMy dearonce one starts disturbing old things one raises more dust than one casts awayI know what you meanYou would like one opposite to match two grey nipples on a green breastWhy not finish it off with a rustic seatNoYou d better tell me about itWhy do you want suddenly to know all about the placeIsn t it better to know than to go on imaginingLook it up in the Book of AsheI m no good at booksPlease AnthonyI can t be left to find outI m afraid not to knowI have tried to be a good wifeTell meTell meI m afraid not to knowStop distressing yourselfWhy is there a bush on the moundWell observedEat another Stickymilky teeth shewed in a smileHe drew the curtains embroidered with the birds and apples of paradiseand lit the seven branched candlestick at the foot of the bed The bush is the stump of a thornWhen there was a towerthe parent tree grew beside it under the wallThere was one of us who was hatedThey came and found him thereThey took him and made him wear a crown of thornsYesThere they crucified him or rather they nailed him onto the wallHe died looking on the seaHe was a long time dyingIt is because of that and not because of Charles II that the remark is a family jokeHow can you joke about itBecause we are like thatWhen did it happenOnce upon a timeI don t believe itIt is in the Book of RingsDo you want me to learn Latin and Black Letter 99Melittathat book is worth itI was never much good at lessonsWe were so badly taughtWon t you translate the interesting bitsI will teach you both sorts of Latinand courthandThen you can do it for yourselfThere are late bitsyour own and your grandfather sSince the decline of our latinityYou can manage themAnthonywhat is it all aboutGo onWhat is this place aboutWhat has the house to do with the Rings andIn what relation do I stand to bothWe are a priestley houselike the EumolpidaeYou know I know nothing about your classicsI m sorrybut what I ve said is the answerIf you really want to know more you will find out for yourselfAnthonyyou pretend that there are ways of looking at things which have nothing to do with ChristianityLittle MelittaChristianity is a waya set of symbols in part to explainand to make men endure the unutterable pain that is the worldThere are other setslike chessmenBut only one gameDo you believe in the heathen GodsYesAnd not that Christ died for usYes The curtains belliedthe tongues of the fire darted outMetilla sat up and drew a strip of ermine across her breasts Is the window shutYesTell me more about the man they killed at the towerIs his portrait downstairsHe was too earlyRight back in the middle agesYesIn the book there is a miniature of himThere he is a saintand the tower is a treeA stiff thing all angles and thick goldDo you demand realism 100Nobut please make him a personHe was Florian AsheHe lived in Henry VI reignHe made a pilgrimage to the Holy LandWe remember him youngbravepitiful and a great witHis wife disliked himOne day her people from Poxwell came and nailed him to the towerHow irreverentDid they did they make it quite like the crucifixionYes he saidYou have nailed me up here like a kite for an example to all birds of my kindAnd they saidWe want to make an end of you and your kind with your jests and compassionsAnd he said You have forced on me the likeness of our Saviour I am going to forgive you allThen he fixed his eyes on the sea and refused to speakDid he say anything elseJust before he died he strained about and said I cannot see the RingsA shepherd threw a flint at him and killed himYou make me as though I saw it in a glassBut not darklyThat s goodWe are a united familyHe is our young brotherWe have never got over his dying like thatI m sure he went to heavenSouls like his should create heavenBut he left a question behind him no one has answeredIt is asked again in some Russian books you should readBut at the foot of that tower I tell youevery Ashe will weepThere is a new Ashe now Anthonyeven though it s a girlSilly onemust I explain again that I im glad of itWhat are we to christen herShe should be Melittabut you do not really like that namea red bratLet s call her ElizabethIt is one of

many othershave all been excessively secretEven such things as Shelley sPrometheus Unbound Kingsley sWater Babies and George Mac Donald sPhantastesAt the Back of the North Wind andLilith are beautiful symbols concealing peculiar doctrinesWhether this tendency comes from some inexplicable twist of the mystical brainwhether it is the desire to seem importantwhether it is the inability to express the ineffable otherwiseor whether it is the desire to conceal spiritual pearls from human swineI cannot saybut the testimony seems to confirm the latterBlake s letters to Trusler are interesting reading on this pointBut Thomas Vaughan falls under another categoryWhen Friar Bacon discovered gunpowderhe wisely concealed the formula in an anagramand I doubt that the world has profited much by deciphering itThomas Vaughan was also an experimenter in dangerous secretsthough of another sortsecrets whose danger is recognized by modern sciencesecrets which eventually caused his deathThese secrets wererightly or wronglyconfused in his mind with the mysteries of Initiationwhich were also prudent to conceal in those days of religious warfareMartyrdom is a crownbut valuable only as propaganda when the whole truth it knownBeing humanThomas Vaughan preferred to continue his experiments in peaceHe desired to leave records for those wise enough to avoid the dangers involvedWhat value these records have cannot be judged until his results are verifiedThe work must be done overbut at leasthe indicates where the secrets lieFFOSTER DAMON NewtonMassArt Circus As jh so admiringly
