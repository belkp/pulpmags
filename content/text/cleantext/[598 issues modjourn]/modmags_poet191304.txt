them  i e these songs As a timorous wench from a centaur  or a centurian Already they flee howling in terror Will they be touched with the truth  Their virgin stupidity is untemptable I beg you my friendly critics Do not set about to procure me an audience  mate with my free kind upon the crags the hidden recesses  Have heard the echo of my heels in the cool light in the darkness   THE CONDOLENCE  A mis soledades voy De mis soledades vengo Porque por andar conmigo Mi bastan mis pensamientos  Lope de Vega  O my fellow sufferers songs of my youth A lot of asses praise you because you are virile We you I We are Red Bloods Imagine it my fellow sufferers Our maleness lifts us out of the ruck  Who d have foreseen it  O my fellow sufferers we went out under the trees We were in especial bored with male stupidity We went forth gathering delicate thoughts Our fantastikon delighted to serve us We were not exasperated with women  for the female is ductile  And now you hear what is said to us We are compared to that sort of person Who wanders about announcing his sex As if he had just discovered it Let us leave this matter my songs  and return to that which concerns us   THE GARRET  Come let us pity those who are better off than we are Come my friend and remember  that the rich have butlers and no friends And we have friends and no butlers Come let us pity the married and the unmarried  Dawn enters with little feet  like a gilded Pavlova And I am near my desire Nor has life in it aught better Than this hour of clear coolness  the hour of waking together  THE GARDEN  En robe de parade  Samain Like a skein of loose silk blown against a wall She walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens And she is dying piece meal of a sort of emotional anemia  And round about there is a rabble Of the filthy sturdy unkillable infants of the very poor They shall inherit the earth  In her is the end of breeding Her boredom is exquisite and excessive   She would like some one to speak to her And is almost afraid that 1 will commit that indiscretion  ORTIS  How have I labored How have I not labored To bring her soul to birth To give these elements a name and a centre  She is beautiful as the sunlight and as fluid She has no name and no place How have I laboured to bring her soul into separation To give her a name and her being  Surely you are bound and entwined You are mingled with the elements unborn I have loved a stream and a shadow  I beseech you enter your life I beseech you learn to say I When I question you For you are no part but a whole No portion but a being  DANCE FIGURE  For the Marriage in Cana of Galilee  Dark eyed O woman of my dreams   Contemporan√¨a  Ivory sandaled There is none like thee among the dancers None with swift feet  I have not found thee in the tents In the broken darkness I have not found thee at the well head Among the women with pitchers  Thine arms are as a young sapling under the bark Thy face as a river with lights  White as an almond are thy shoulders As new almonds stripped from the husk  They guard thee not with eunuchs Not with bars of copper Gilt turquoise and silver are in the place of thy rest A brown robe with threads of gold woven in patterns  hast thou gathered about thee O Nathat Ikanaie Tree at the river  As a rillet among the sedge are thy hands upon me Thy fingers a frosted stream  Thy maidens are white like pebbles Their music about thee   There is none like thee among the dancers None with swift feet  SALUTATION  O generation of the thoroughly smug  and thoroughly uncomfortable I have seen fishermen picnicking in the sun I have seen them with untidy families I have seen their smiles full of teeth  and heard ungainly laughter  And I am happier than you are And they were happier than I am And the fish swim in the lake  and do not even own clothing  SALUTATION THE SECOND  You were praised my books because I had just come from the country I was twenty years

of these faces in the crowd Petals on a wet black bough  Ezra Pound   Mother Earth  MOTHER EARTH  Oh a grand old time has the earth In the long long life she lives From her huge mist shrouded birth When reeling from under She tore space asunder And feeling her way Through the dim first day Rose wheeling to run In the path of the sun From then till forever Tiring not pausing never She labors and laughs and gives  Plains and mountains She slowly makes With mighty hand Sifting the sand Lifting the land Out of the soft wet clutch of the shouting sea At lofty fountains Her thirst she slakes And over the hills Through the dancing rills Wide rivers she fills That shine and sing and leap in their joy to be free Cool greenness she needs   And rich odor of bloom  And longing believing  Slowly conceiving  Her germ woof weaving She spawns little seeds By the wombful the worldful  And laughs as the pattern grows fair at her loom  Proudly she trails Her flower broidered dresses In the sight of the sun Loudly she hails Through her far streaming tresses His coursers that run For her heart ever living grows eager for life Its delight and desire She feels the high praise of its passion and strife Of its rapture and fire There are wings and songs in her trees There are gleaming fish in her seas The brute beasts brave her And gnaw her and crave her And out of the heart of these She wrests a dream a hope An arrogant plan Of life that shall meet her Shall know and complete her   Mother Earth  That through ages shall climb and grope And at last be man  Out of the bitter void she wins him Out of the night With terror and wild hope begins him And fierce delight She beats him into caves She starves and spurns him Her hills and plains are graves Into dust she turns him She teaches him war and wrath And waste and lust and greed Then over his blood red path She scatters her fruitful seed With bloom of a thousand flowers With songs of the summer hours With the love of the wind for the tree With the dance of the sun on the sea She lulls and quells him Oh soft her caress And tenderly tells him Of happiness Through her ages of years Through his toil and his tears At her wayward pleasure She yields of her treasure A gleam yea a hope   Even a day of days When the wide heavens ope And he loves and prays Then she laughs in wonder To see him rise Her leash from under And brave the skies  Oh a grand old time has the earth In the long long life she lives A grand old time at her work sublime As she labors and laughs and gives  Harriet Monroe   The Grey Rock  THE GREY ROCK  Poets with whom I learned my trade Companions of the Cheshire Cheese Here s an old story I ve remade Imagining twould better please Your ears than stories now in fashion Though you may think I waste my breath Pretending that there can be passion That has more life in it than death Though at the bottling of your wine The bow legged Goban had no say The moral s yours because it s mine  When cups went round at close of day Is not that how good stories run Somewhere within some hollow hill If books speak truth in Slievenamon But let that be the gods were still And sleepy having had their meal And smoky torches made a glare On painted pillars on a deal Of old stringed instruments hung there By the ancient holy hands that brought them From murmuring Mur√≠as on cups Old Goban hammered them and wrought them And put his pattern round their tops To hold the wine they buy of him   But from the juice that made them wise All those had lifted up the dim Imaginations of their eyes For one that was like woman made Before their sleepy eyelids ran And trembling with her passion said Come out and dig for a dead man Who s burrowing somewhere in the ground And mock him to his face and then Hollo him on with horse and hound For he is the worst of all dead men  We should be dazed and terror struck If we but saw in dreams that room And those fierce eyes and curse our luck That emptied all our days to come I knew a woman none could please Because she dreamed when but a child Of men and women made like these And after when her blood ran wild Had ravelled her own story out And said In two or in three years I need must marry some poor lout And having said it burst in tears Since tavern comrades you have died Maybe your images have stood Mere bone and muscle thrown aside Before that roomful or as good   You had to face your ends when young Twas wine or women or some curse But never made a poorer song  That you might have a heavier purse Nor gave loud service to a cause  That you might have a troop of friends You kept the Muses sterner laws And unrepenting faced your ends And therefore earned the right and yet Dowson and Johnson most I praise  To troop with those the world s forgot And copy their proud steady gaze  The Danish troop was driven put Between the dawn and dusk she said Although the event was long in doubt Although the King of Ireland s dead And half his kings before sundown All was accomplished  When this day Murrough the King of Ireland s son Foot after foot was giving way He and his best troops back to back Had perished there but the Danes ran Stricken with panic from the attack The shouting of an unseen man And being thankful Murrough found   Led by a foot sole dipped in blood That had made prints upon the ground Where by old thorn trees that man stood And though when he gazed here and there He had but gazed on thorn trees spoke Who is the friend that seems but air And yet could give so fine a stroke Thereon a young man met his eye Who said Because she held me in Her love and would not have me die Rock nurtured Aoife took a pin And pushing it into my shirt Promised that for a pin s sake No man should see to do me hurt But there it s gone I will not take The fortune that had been my shame Seeing King s son what wounds you have  Twas roundly spoke but when night came He had betrayed me to his grave For he and the King s son were dead I d promised him two hundred years And when for all I d done or said And these immortal eyes shed tears He claimed his country s need was most I d saved his life yet for the sake Of a new friend he has turned a ghost What does he care if my heart break I call for spade and horse and hound   That we may harry him Thereon She cast herself upon the ground And rent her clothes and made her moan Why are they faithless when their might Is from the holy shades that rove The grey rock and the windy light Why should the faithfulest heart most love The bitter sweetness of false faces Why must the lasting love what passes Why are the gods by men betrayed But thereon every god stood up With a slow smile and without sound And stretching forth his arm and cup To where she moaned upon the ground Suddenly drenched her to the skin And she with Goban s wine adnp No more remembering what had been Stared at the gods with laughing lip  I have kept my faith though faith was tried To that rock born rock wandering foot And the world s altered since you died And I am in no good repute With the loud host before the sea That think sword strokes were better meant Than lover s music let that be So that the wandering foot s content  William Butler Yeats   EDITORIAL COMMENT  THE NEW BEAUTY  Quoiqu il arrive ces premieres ann√©es de notre si√®cle annoncent une floraison qui sera parmi les plus riches Et il fait bon de vivre en ces heures de rude combat pour la capture de la beaut√© nouvelle Fritz R Vanderpyl and Guy Charles Cros in the Mercure de France December 1 1912  Of the countless offerings of verse which have reached us during the last half year the greater number have been pathetically ingenuous in their intellectual attitude Numerous books and more numerous manuscripts appeal importunately for time and space whose eager authors seem as unaware of the twentieth century as if they had spent these recent years in an Elizabethan manor house or a vine clad Victorian cottage This is true even of certain ones who assert their modernism by rhyming of slums and strikes or by moralizing in choppy odes or in choppier prose mistaken for vers libre upon some social or political problem of the day  It is not a question of subject nor yet of form this new beauty which must inspire every artist worthy of the age he lives in The poet is not a follower but a leader he is a poet not because he can measure words or express patly current ideas but because the new beauty is a vision in his eyes and a passion in his heart and because he must strain every sinew of his spirit to reveal it to the world He can not resign his ancient  The New Beauty  prophetic office and the technique of its fulfilment the style which he achieves with joyous ease or more or less painful labor according to his temperament necessarily can not satisfy him until it matches the beauty of the vision  All this is so obvious as to be usually forgotten Art in general and poetry in particular are regarded as a decoration of life not as its very pulse and heart beat inevitable like a sunrise or a flower Being a decoration it becomes a side issue something extraneous a matter of pleasing fancies and pretty patterns which may be taken conveniently from the past and modified for modern uses And so each generation imposes its opinion on the next and the poet who should be born and brought up to freedom finds himself shut up in ready made conventions and prejudices If he is weakly inspired his little gleam of the new beauty will be extinguished and forgotten and he will go along imitating the masters and pottering with inessentials And even though he is a giant in strength and an apostle in faith whose vision of the new beauty would lead him through fire and sword storm and shame he must yet spend a heavy toll of his precious power in fighting the lords of things as they are in destroying barriers and winning through to freedom  If poetry is to have its share of that promised efflorescence which is to be among the richest this old world has known if the signs do not fail and it is indeed good   to live in this time of rude struggle for the capture of the new beauty then our poets would seem to be in need of courage They should pay less attention to old forms which have been worn thin by five centuries of English song They should return rather to first principles feel as if poetry were new and they the first to forge rhythmic chains for the English language  POETRY has given space and will doubtless give more to voices and fashions more or less reminiscent convinced that it is only by such trial ventures that some men can discover their true place A talent which seems authentic should be encouraged even if it begins in a thin soprano or a rather raucous bass The masterpiece is always a rarity and it blooms not in a desert but in the midst of lesser growth We have printed sonnets but always with the arriere pens√©e that the sonnet is an exhausted form whose every possible shade of cadence has been worked out and repeated until there are no more surprises left in it Modern drama is waiting to be written is part of that new beauty to be captured but it will hardly be caught in classic or Elizabethan garments Poetic narrative may have a future as great as its past but it is rather late in the day for sea dog epics like Mr Noyes Drake and buccaneer ballads of blood and fire Indeed it may be questioned whether Mr Masefield captures the new beauty in his tales of present day squalor and struggle told in swinging Byronic   The New Beauty  verse for his plots strike melodramatic attitudes and his lines have an old familiar stride  It may be that alien hands will uncover the new treasure that in this twentieth century welter of nations the beauty of the English language must be rediscovered by some Russian immigrant or some traveler from Turkestan Today it is not a poet of Anglo Saxon race but a Hindoo with divinatory power in English who has the keenest vision of the new beauty and the richest modern message not only for the millions who speak his mother tongue but also for those far scattered millions who carry Shakespeare s mother tongue over the world If the great achievement of the twentieth century is to be its making friends of East and West it may be that the one most important episode of England s rule over India will be the teaching of her language to Rabindra Nath Tagore  It may be premature to express an opinion founded largely upon still unpublished translations from the Bengali But this Hindoo shows us how provincial we are England and America are little recently annexed corners of the ancient earth and their poets should peer out over sea walls and race walls and pride walls and learn their own littleness and the bigness of the world  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVIEWS  The Vaunt of Man and Other Poems by William Ellery  Leonard B W Huebsch  It is a pleasure to praise this book for the force of its sincere feeling its emotional earnestness its large sweep of courageous personality yet in doing so one feels somehow as if one were praising Mr Leonard rather than the work itself For the verse forms used and above all the hackneyed sonnet are but shells vehicles merely which Mr Leonard has made expressive in spite of themselves by this very intense quality of personal earnestness It is for the spirit of the book that one has admiration He does not give us the piquant pleasure of new rhythms or unexpected quantities for which one cannot help wishing nevertheless but he does give us new wine even though it somewhat endangers the old bottles One might turn against Mr Leonard himself the closing lines of his Anti rococo  Oh be bold be free Strip off this perfumed fabric from your verse Tear from your windows all the silk and lace And stand man woman on the slope by me  His sonnet on The Express for instance would gain immeasurably if he had allowed its rhythmic impetus to create its own form Mr Leonard has something to say and one reads his book for the sake of it It is the man who has something to say who commands attention   but he can only command it authoritatively by uniting what he has to say with its most direct inherent form of expression There was no preconceived model for the first vase And even though Mr Leonard s power were to undergo a certain lassitude in the transition there is no doubt but that if he would allow himself greater freedom his art would gain vitally in the end At any rate we are grateful for what he has given us as it is And we have no fear that he suffers from that supersensitive egoism of the minor poet the most serious obstacle to his artistic progress  And who slays me must overcome a world Heroes at arms and virgins who became Mothers of children prophecy and song Walls of old cities with their flags unfurled Peaks headlands ocean and its isles of fame And sun and moon and all that made me strong  These lines form the preface of Mr Leonard s volume  These rhymes record by quite unconscious plan What life from year to year may mean to man Scarce one but had its rise in common place In old experience of the human race And yet not one without some How or When No man on earth can ever feel again I made the record that I might be free Through mastering art lest life should master me Finding in art creating as I went A world more luminous and eloquent  It is impossible to make further quotation and a  mention of titles would only indicate personal choice   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  this may be done better by the individual reader to whom we recommend the book heartily for the qualities already mentioned  The Roadside Fire by Amelia Josephine Burr George  H Doran Co  It is one thing to give to a work of individual firsthand conception a title which as a symbol connects that work with others expressing the same elemental passion as Rodin labels his finished marbles with the names of Pygmalion and Galatea or La Voix Int√©rieure drawn as these are from individual observation or personal experience and yet expressing conceptual emotions as old as the world but it is quite another thing to weave about such titles or fragments of traditional situations an embroidered pattern of reflective phrases The one process belongs to creative art the other to the secondary stage of illustrative comment The first is a classic in the making the second is a classic in the degenerative process of appreciative imitation the pseudo classic To this second class unfortunately almost all the poems in Miss Josephine Amelia Burr s The Roadside Fire belong  There is no need of explaining what explains itself Michelangelo s Pieta Rodin s The Hand of God are sufficiently self expressive Neither can one add one jot or tittle to the story of Christ of the Magdalen and   Reviews  some strenuous band of poetic Futurists ought to forbid the titular use of Icarus or Lilith for the space of one year at least The little that Miss Burr has to say for herself is impeded by the use of trite worn out meaningless phrases or words of an abstract generalized significance and therefore so far as poetry is concerned is without value  The wasted years false hopes and falser fears gods of clay such phrases are types of a false poetic currency which neither buys nor sells Is it any wonder that the mind insensibly locks before such mechanically filled in metrics Poetry which is a refinement a recreation an escaping essence liberated only by its own fine excess this toil demands greater sacrifice and makes greater reprisals  Miss Burr s poem We Have Piped Unto You considered apart from its reflective genetrix would be the best in the book if it were not marred by the line The love of Humanity linked with the love of the One As it is Rudel Sings to His Lady takes first place This with some real feeling back of it and a certain amount of skill in the making almost achieves genuine expression  The system of printing each successive stanza with large initial capitals like a child s primer is a fault of the book for which Miss Burr is probably not to blame but it is annoying   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The Wife of Potiphar with Other Poems by Harvey Mait land Watts The John C Winston Co Philadelphia The dramatic episode giving the book its title and  another dramatic poem of satirical turn have a certain direct terseness of expression which is not in evidence in the rest of the poems in the book These are wordy wooden the legs are of cork and the features if they can be discerned at all too thickly varnished with the theatrical poetaster s paint Mr Watts should make a clean sweep and begin again Apparently he has not realized that a confusion of all things upon which his eye may light in the weaving of his fancy will not give the reader any clarity of vision the focus changes every  moment A nodding smile at every turn Hardest of hearts unlocks

not always get her keen message into poetic cadences sometimes it weakens into prosaic statement But again it becomes a clear strong chant welling out of hidden reserves of feeling and attaining

found me a man from himself I bought him Gold from the dross and better from worse No other woman like me hath taught him The great white law of the universe  The Star Treader and Other Poems by Clark Ashton Smith A M Robertson San Francisco  This Californian has extreme youth in his favor so it would be idle to complain that his subjects are chiefly astronomic Life will bring him down to earth no doubt in her usual brusque manner and will teach him something more intimate to write about than winds and stars and forsaken gods Meantime he shows an unusual imaginative power of visualizing these

inspiration to his poetry which is something new in American literature His is not the poetry of a cloistered age but of an age full of brilliant energy in its way an industrial Renaissance To the clamor and ferment of progress Mr Kaufman gives voice He sings of strife of social wrongs but above all of the great unfolding future of humanity He has been recognized both in his own country and abroad as a poet most contemporary and typical of his nation He derives from no past literary tradition he is the triumphant singer of today Ready in April 12mo Net 1 25  BY DOUGLAS MALLOCH  THE WOODS In the Forest Land  Mr Malloch is not a new Riley or a new Service he is entirely himself He voices in a way entirely fresh and utterly personal the joy of the outdoor man who lives by the strength of his muscles close to nature The whisper of the woods is in his pages the crash of the forest giant falling the risk riot and recklessness of life in a leafy world without frontiers For many years his fugitive poems have been in demand among lumbermen and the kind of plain people who are not usually supposed to love poetry In this volume is gathered up the best of his work and many of the old favorites which have so far been treasured in the form of newspaper clippings Mr Malloch is a poet who must be heard he sings of the clean fine things beyond the walls of cities things most proudly

OF THE BIBELOT  NNUALLY for over twenty years after his generous and friendly habit Mr Mosher has sent far and wide A List of Books in Belles Lettres issued in Choice and Limited Editions as artistic without and as filled with treasure within as is every book which comes from him But these catalogues have been far more than lists of his rare publications Scattered throughout them have appeared excerpts of prose and verse whose selection and arrangement have given the catalogues a value as unique as their format And although it be possible that relatively few readers could adequately appreciate the thought and labor which went into their making no one who has read them but has won delight for eye and brain and heart To many has come a regret that such wealth of literary treasure should be in so perishable a form This regret the editor of the Bibelot has heard and answered For in this book are gathered those flowers of thought which were published year by year in the catalogues plucked many of them from well known highways plucked many of them from byways hitherto little known perhaps wholly unknown and bound by the yearly greetings of the editor to his readers his friends  When I may never meet nor greet other than in these words  A gentle melancholy underlies much of the thought This however is never pessimistic and rising higher and higher through the conquest of self sings its victory in There will come a time when it shall be light and when man shall awaken from his lofty dreams and find his dreams still there and that nothing has gone save his sleep We do not quote All book lovers will read for themselves welcoming many friends long known and other newer ones Mr Mosher has done for literature especially for belles lettres a beneficent work None of it carries a stronger appeal than this message of love courage and optimism Boston Transcript  925 copies F cap octavo Van Gelder hand made paper old style boards 1 75 net  50 copies on Japan
