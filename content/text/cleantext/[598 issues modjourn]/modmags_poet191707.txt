a poplar sweet as a red haw in November or a pawpaw in May did she wonder does she remember in the dust in the cool tombs Carl Sandburg  I  POWHATAN was conqueror Powhatan was emperor He was akin to wolf and bee Brother of the hickory tree Son of the red lightning stroke  And the lightning shivered oak His panther grace bloomed in the maid Who laughed among the winds and played In excellence of savage pride Wooing the forest open eyed In the springtime In Virginia Our mother Pocahontas   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Her skin was rosy copper red And high she held her beauteous head Her step was like a rustling leaf Her heart a nest untouched of grief She dreamed of sons like Powhatan And through her blood the lightning ran Love cries with the birds she sung And bird like in the ivy swung The Forest arching low and wide Gloried in its Indian bride Rolfe that dim adventurer Had not come a courtier John Rolfe is not our ancestor We rise from out the soul of her Held in native wonderland While the sun s rays kissed her hand In the springtime In Virginia Our mother Pocahontas  II  She heard the forest talking Across the sea came walking And traced the paths of Daniel Boone Then westward chased the painted moon She passed with wild young feet   Our Mother Pocahontas  On to Kansas wheat On to the miners west The echoing canon s guest Then the Pacific sand Waking Thrilling The midnight land   On Adams street and Jefferson Flames coming up from the ground On Jackson street and Washington Flames coming up from the ground And why until the dawning sun Are flames coming up from the ground Because through drowsy Springfield sped This red skin queen with feathered head With winds and stars that pay her court And leaping beasts that make her sport Because gray Europe s rags august She tramples in the dust Because we are her fields of corn Because our fires are all reborn From her bosom s deathless embers Flaming as she remembers The springtime And Virginia Our mother Pocahontas   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  III  We here renounce our Saxon blood Tomorrow s hopes an April flood Come roaring in The newest race Is born of her resilient grace We here renounce our Teuton pride Our Norse and Slavic boasts have died Italian dreams are swept away And Celtic feuds are lost today   She sings of lilacs maples wheat Her own soil sings beneath her feet Of springtime And Virginia Our mother Pocahontas  NIAGARA  Within the town of Buffalo Are prosy men with leaden eyes Like ants they worry to and fro  Important men in Buffalo But only twenty miles away A deathless glory is at play Niagara Niagara   Niagara  The women buy their lace and cry  Oh such a delicate design  And over ostrich feathers sigh  By counters there in Buffalo  The children haunt the trinket shops  They buy false faces bells and tops  Forgetting great Niagara  Within the town of Buffalo  Are stores with garnets sapphires pearls  Rubies emeralds aglow  Opal chains in Buffalo  Cherished symbols of success  They value not your rainbow dress  Niagara Niagara  The shaggy meaning of her name  This Buffalo this recreant town  Sharps and lawyers prune and tame  Few pioneers in Buffalo  Except young lovers flushed and fleet And winds halooing down the street Niagara Niagara  The journalists are sick of ink Boy prodigals burnt out with wine By night where white and red lights blink The eyes of Death in Buffalo   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And only twenty miles away  Are starlight rocks and healing spray  Niagara Niagara  By the quaint market proudly loom Church walls Kind altars gleam within Confession boxes crowd the gloom Baptismal fonts in Buffalo St Michael fights the dragon drear The stations of the cross are here But my church is Niagara  Above the town a tiny bird  A shining speck at sleepy dawn  Forgets the ant hill so absurd  This self important Buffalo Descending twenty miles away He bathes his wings at break of day Niagara Niagara  What marching men of Buffalo Flood the streets in rash crusade Fools to free the world they go Primeval hearts from Buffalo Red cataracts of France today Awake three thousand miles away An echo of Niagara The cataract Niagara   Mark Twain and Joan of Arc  MARK TWAIN AND JOAN OF ARC  When Yankee soldiers reach the barricade Then Joan of Arc gives each the accolade  For she is there in armor clad today All the young poets of the wide world say  Which of our freemen did she greet the first Seeing him come against the fires accurst  Mark Twain our Chief with neither smile nor jest Leading to war our youngest and our best  The Yankee to King Arthur s court returns The sacred flag of Joan above him burns  For she has called his soul from out the tomb And where she stands there he will stand till doom  But I I can but mourn and mourn again At bloodshed caused by angels saints and men  Vachel Lindsay   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE GREAT AIR BIRDS GO SWIFTLY BY  The great air birds go swiftly by Pinions of bloom and death And armies counter on shell torn plains And strive for a little breath Pinnacled rockets in the gloom Light for a little space A gasping mouth and a dying face Blackened with night and doom As if in a little room A sick man laid on his bed Turned to his nurse and questioned when Mass for his soul would be said Life is no larger than this Though thousands are slaked with lime Life is no larger than one man s soul One man s soul is as great as the whole And no times greater than Time  Alice Corbin   DESIGNS IN CHINESE COLOR  THE CITY  A city man had vowed to worship Buddha As should be meet He chose a pagoda on a lonely hilltop  For his retreat Yet wandering went his eyes daily wandering To where the city thrived getting and squandering Between him and that city quivering trees Moved rhythmic tops like waves upon the seas  Alas he cried I am not blown like gossamer Quickly above Down go my thoughts down with that small footpath  Through the bamboo grove To where the city people utter words Like numerous flocks of cheeping noisy birds A captive in a wicker cage is my poor heart Bruising its wings where it is hung apart  Though this pagoda on the mountain s crest Is my lone cell What shall avail its seven heavenward stairs  Or wind rung bell What use is solitude or prayer forlorn While I still love the place where I was born Would I could shut the city from my thought Then might I worship Buddha undistraught   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CLOUD LOVED  Far up the side of White cloud Mountain A deep pool lies Content in every change of weather  To reflect the skies Fed by the grace of heaven from seeping little springs Mirror of pointed firs solace of eagles wings  And yet the water of the cloud loved pool Breaks foaming from the quiet hills away To add its trickle to an oceanful Flooding storming mocking every day  MAGICIANS AND THE GODS  Magicians fear the gods old Chung would say They will brazen it out with you and me Beating us down with mystery They will falter and fail grovel and pray If they meet a god at a turn in the way  Magicians know the gods old Chung would say Though a god should come in a ragged gown Begging his rice through the dust of the town They will fumble their magic fall flat and pray Should a god in rags come strolling their way   A Swallow  A SWALLOW  A swallow flicks my shoulder And turns off in the twilight A twitter on the terrace A spot against the skylight  FISH  If but an egret wade the riverside The knowing fish will quickly run and hide Trusting the water in their swift retreat To keep the secret of their pattering feet  PORCELAINS  There are porcelains a plenty wrought by skill Hard as jade sweet toned as a bell In a hundred shapes that tradesfolk sell Wine cups rice bowls lanterns plates Tea pots snuff bottles vases with mates  There are porcelains a plenty wrought by skill  There are porcelains made by no man s will Miracles they of the kiln and fire Outwitting dreams outrunning desire Fashioned when genii blew the coals Decreed for the reverence of men s souls  There are porcelains made by no man s will  Lyon Sharman   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THREE CANTOS  II  Leave Casella Send out your thought upon the Mantuan palace Drear waste great halls Silk tatters still in the frame Gonzaga s splendor Alight with phantoms What have we of them Or much or little Where do we come upon the ancient people All that I know is that a certain star All that I know of one Joios Tolosan Is that in middle May going along A scarce discerned path turning aside In level poplar lands he found a flower and wept Y a la primera flor he wrote Qu ieu trobei tornei em plor  There s the one stave and all the rest forgotten I ve lost the copy I had of it in Paris Out of the blue and gilded manuscript Decked out with Couci s rabbits And the pictures twined with the capitals Purporting to be Arnaut and the authors Joios we have By such a margent stream He strayed in the field wept for a flare of color When Coeur de Lion was before Chalus Or there s En Arnaut s score of songs two tune9 The rose leaf casts her dew on the ringing glass   Three Cantos  Dolmetsch will build our age in witching music Viols da Gamba tabors tympanons  Yin yo laps in the reeds my guest departs The maple leaves blot up their shadows The sky is full of autumn We drink our parting in saki Out of the night comes troubling lute music And we cry out asking the singer s name And get this answer  Many a one Brought me rich presents my hair was full of jade And my slashed skirts drenched in expensive dyes Were dipped in crimson sprinkled with rare wines I was well taught my arts at Ga ma rio And then one year I faded out and married The lute bowl hid her face  We heard her weeping  Society her sparrows Venus sparrows and Catullus Hung on the phrase played with it as Mallarmé Played for a fan Rêveuse pour que je plonge Wrote out his crib from Sappho God s peer that man is in my sight Yea and the very gods are under him Who sits opposite thee facing thee near thee Gazing his fill and hearing thee And thou smilest Woe to me with   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Quenched senses for when I look upon thee Lesbia There is nothing above me And my tongue is heavy and along my veins Runs the slow fire and resonant Thunders surge in behind my ears And the night is thrust down upon me  That was the way of love fiamma dìmanat And in a year I love her as a father And scarce a year Your words are written in water And in ten moons Caelius Lesbia illa That Lesbia Caelius our Lesbia that Lesbia Whom Catullus once loved more Than his own soul and all his friends Is now the drab of every lousy Roman So much for him who puts his trust in woman So the murk opens  Dordoigne When I was there There came a centaur spying the land And there were nymphs behind him Or going on the road by Salisbury Procession on procession For that road was full of peoples Ancient in various days long years between them Ply over ply of life still wraps the earth here Catch at Dordoigne  Viscount St Antoni In the warm damp of spring   Three Cantos  Feeling the night air full of subtle hands Plucks at a viol singing  As the rose Si com si com they all begin si com For as the rose in trellis Winds in and through and over So is your beauty in my heart that is bound through and over So lay Queen Venus in her house of glass The pool of worth thou art  Flood land of pleasure  But the Viscount Pena Went making war into an hostile country Where he was wounded The news held him dead St Antoni in favor and the lady Ready to hold his hands This last report upset the whole convention She rushes off to church sets up a gross of candles Pays masses for the soul of Viscount Pena  Thus St Circ has the story That sire Raimon Jordans of land near Caortz Lord of St Antoni loved this Viscountess of Pena Gentle and highly prized And he was good at arms and bos trobaire And they were taken with love beyond all measure And then her husband was reported dead And at this news she had great grief and sorrow   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And gave the church such wax for his recovery That he recovered and At this news she had great grief and teen And fell to moping dismissed St Antoni Thus was there more than one in deep distress  So ends that novel And the blue Dordoigne Stretches between white cliffs Pale as the

Juts into the sky  Like a thin spire Blue night s pulled down around it Like tent flaps or sails close hauled When I was the La noche de San Juan a score of players Were walking about the streets in masquerade With pikes and paper helmets and the booths Were scattered align the rag ends of the fair False arms True arms You think a tale of lances A flood of people storming about Spain  My cid rode up to Burgos Up to the studded gate between two towers Beat with his lance butt   Three  A girl child of nine Comes to a little shrine like platform in the wall Lisps out the words a whisper the King

From empty presses  Came riding with his company up the great hill Afe Minaya  to Burgos in the spring And thence to fighting to down throw of Moors And to Valencia rode he by the beard Muy velida  Of onrush of lances Of splintered staves riven and broken casques Dismantled castles of painted shields split up Blazons hacked off piled men and bloody rivers Then sombre light upon reflecting armor And portents in the wind when De las Nieblas Set out to sea fight  Y dar neuva lumbre las armas y hierros  Full many a fathomed sea change in the eyes That sought with him the salt sea victories Another

on tremulous azure waters Floats the moon in a sky of ineffable delicacy  Dorothy Dudley   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE HOST OF DREAMS  I lay there in my straight white gown With flowers in my hands And candles burning at my head And burning at my feet I heard them say that I was dead But I was fast asleep And it was little they knew For I was dreaming wonderful And I was dreaming true I was asleep yet I could hear And I was seeing far and clear As I had not seen before And then I rose and went my way The Host of Dreams had beckoned me Out through the open door The straight white one was lying there With flowers in its hands The candles were burnt low I laughed a little because They did not see me go  Katharine Howard   SUMMONS TO YOUTH  Exultant youths who would bewail or vaunt The odds of love no longer waste your breath A greater feat now summons you than love Or life itself it s war and war is death  Rudolph Altrocchi  MOSES  Behold the hoary patriarch on Grand Street Not

And heed not The hand of Time Ingratiating Jingling with hours Bright hours Gaudy   Do not be tempted to sell him Your childhood  But I I have nothing to offer And nothing to ask But love  Love that is hushed  Still as anemones Filling with moonlight   The Island  THE ISLAND  Upon a silent island In your bosom I am shut I wandered on the island In a pale noon and a hut I found within the island Dusk of willow elm and fern Alone amid the island A shadow in an urn It is a fairy island I never shall escape Until the willowed island Shall change its wistful shape Until the urn shall shatter And the shadow slake The frail wish of the sleeper And she shall wake I dare not stir the island Silence with a happy word I dread to shake the island With a plea that may be heard So in sleep I keep the island Mate its dream with one mine own Lest into life the island break And leave me all alone  Robert Alien   Sanborn  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HISTORY  I  This sarcophagus contained the body Of Uresh Nai priestess to the goddess Mut Mother of All  II The priestess has passed into her tomb The stone has taken up her spirit Granite over flesh who will deny Its advantages  Your death water  Spilled upon the ground  Though water will mount again into rose leaves  But you would hold life still  Even as a memory when it is over  Benevolence is rare  Climb about this sarcophagus read What is writ for you in these figures Hard as the granite that has held them With so soft a hand the while Your own flesh has been fifty times Through the guts of oxen read  The rose tree will have its donor Even though he give stingily   The gift of some endures Ten years the gift of some twenty And the gift of some for the time a Great house rots and is torn down Some give for a thousand years to men of One country some for a thousand To all men and some few to all men While granite holds an edge against The weather  Judge then of love  III  My flesh is turned to stone I Have endured my summer The flurry Of falling petals is ended I was Well desired and fully caressed By many lovers but my flesh Withered swiftly and my heart was Never satisfied Lay your hands Upon the granite as a lover lays his Hand upon the thigh and upon the Round breasts of her who is Beside him for now I will not wither Now I have thrown off secrecy now I have walked naked into the street Now I have scattered my heavy beauty In the open market   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Here I am with head high and a Burning heart eagerly awaiting Your caresses whoever it may be For granite is not harder than My love is open runs loose among you  I arrogant against death I Who have endured I worn against The years  SMELL  O strong ridged and deeply hollowed Nose of mine what will you not be smelling What tactless asses we are you and I bony nose Always indiscriminate always unashamed And now it is the souring flowers of the bedraggled Poplars a festering pulp on the wet earth Beneath them with what deep a thirst We quicken our desires O nose of mine To that rank odor of a passing springtime Can you not be decent Can you not reserve your ardors For something less unlovely What girl will care For us do you think if we continue in these ways Must you taste everything Must you know everything Must you have a part in everything  William Carlos Williams   POEMS BY CHILDREN  A LITTLE GIRL S SONGS  SPRING SONG  I love daffodils I love Narcissus when he bends his head I can hardly keep March and spring and Sunday and daffodils Out of my rhyme of song Do you know anything about the spring When it comes again God knows about it while winter is lasting Flowers bring him power in the spring And birds bring it and children He is sometimes sad and alone Up there in the sky trying to keep his worlds happy I bring him songs when he is in his sadness and weary I tell him how I used to wander out to study stars and the moon  he made And flowers in the dark of the wood I keep reminding him about his flowers he has forgotten And that snowdrops are up What can I say to make him listen God I say Don t you care 1 Nobody must be sad or sorry In the spring time of flowers  BY LAKE CHAMPLAIN  I was bare as a leaf And I felt the wind on my shoulder The trees laughed When I picked up the sun in my fingers The wind was chasing the waves Tangling their white curls Willow trees I said O willows Look at your lake Stop laughing at a little girl Who runs past your feet in the sand   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TO A MOUSE  Little Mouse in gray velvet Have you had a cheese breakfast There are no crumbs on your coat Did you use a napkin I wonder what you had to eat And who dresses you in gray velvet  The world turns softly Not to spill its lakes and rivers The water is held in its arms And the sky is held in the water What is water That pours silver And can hold the sky  Once upon a time at evening light A little girl was sad There was a color in the sky A color she knew in her dreamful heart And wanted to keep She held out her arms Long long And saw it flow away on the wind When it was gone She did not love the moonlight Or care for the stars She had seen the rose in the sky Hilda Conkling six years old IN THE GARDEN I have come into the garden  It is spring time and there are flowers everywhere Even on the tails of the peacocks  Malcolm Edward Erskine   Crystals  CRYSTALS  0 POET  O poet dost thou love thy songs Or wouldst thou rather paint the golden cliffs Or model great bronze statues on the city s streets Or be in the front of an engine black And steer him around the curve Or look at the stars through a telescope  TO A SPARKLING PIECE OF CRYSTAL  O thou white and yellow stone  How dost thou make thy nest and breed thy young in the rock  Art thou a brother of the ruby red  Which is more like Mars than the Pleiades seven  That sit in the heavens high  Or the tailish comet that circles the sky  O thou crystal bright as Venus  Shining in the twilight gray  THE BUBBLE  Ethereal globe of thinnest glass  Sphere of air yet visible  What hand of nymph or fairy  Could mold thy fragile form  Airy buoyant weighing naught  And of what clay if such it be  Did thy creator model thee  THE BROOK  Where comest thou from O little brook  Where didst thou learn they song From the caw of the crow and the hawk s shrill note And the thrush s evening voice  Where will you go O little stream  Where will you rest at last Where the sand piper s scream and the duck s cross quack Echo out on the ocean wide  Frank M Schoonmaker ten years old   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SONG DROPS  WINTER  The snow flakes fall upon the ground The snow banks are gilded with beauty Moon maidens come to drive upon the snow And then it melts And the moon closes her eyes slenderly  THE SPIDER S WEB  O spider I love your spun web With pearls about it If only one could touch such beauty And not destroy it But spider keep your pearls Like shimmering ornaments  INSCRIPTION ON A SUN DIAL  Oh Time flies fast Days fly fast Years fly fast  But love stays fast Folded in your breast  Louise Hart  THE FORFEIT  She was holding up the big green leaf Over my head and she said Heavy heavy hangs over thy head What shall the owner do to redeem it  Climb up the world And bring me down the moon  The moon was a white lily bud That hadn t grown to a flower yet When she picked it All the little rain drops flew off And made stars  Betty Orr five years old   Green and Gray  GREEN AND GRAY  SPRING MORNING  Spring has come this morning The room is like a bright cake of honey And the grass is as green as my crayon This brightness has been all winter growing  GRAY MORNING  The gray faced sky lets me look at it And the timid rain upon my face Is softer than sunshine Some people are like this

cold Under the stars  Over the battlefield  Cannon are booming  More death to come  And women  Sit with their children  In their ruined homes  Over the battlefield Falls the deep snow  PRAISE  O birds  Sing of the beautiful heaven  Sing birds  Of the angels  The harps  And the sweet bells  We should love this heaven of God s For ever and ever  Lila Rich  EDITORIAL COMMENT  WILL ART HAPPEN  SINGULAR misapprehension of the origins of art seems to persist in the public mind POETRY has been reproached for printing no war poems at the very moment of the nation s dread decision American poets have been re  proached for not buckling down to the production of masterpieces prizes have been offered for war songs marching songs And the public noting these and other stimuli is dissatisfied if the touch of the button does not produce the light  Apparently the public expectant and impatient cannot be reminded too often of Whistler s axiom art happens It may happen under a stimulus and it may not it may or may not happen in a remote and impenetrable hermit s cell It is good policy no doubt to apply the stimulus at least it sets people thinking starts currents which may travel invisibly and exert some influence sooner or later A prize in its round up of good bad and indifferent may even bring to the light a masterpiece though in that happy event the public would find that no hope of a prize inspired it but an emotion quite unconnected with thought of reward For example POETRY in its War Number of November 1914 presented a prize to Miss Louise Driscoll for her brief drama Metal Checks one of the finest poems yet produced in exposition of the tragedy of war but Miss Driscoll wrote her poem with   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  no thought of a prize but to express her own emotion and merely seized upon POETRY S contest as a convenient way of getting it before the public  The usual immediate result of such stimuli is verse which at its best may be classed as good journalism and of all the numerous war poems written in America since war was declared perhaps none is too fine for this definition It may be that we do not yet feel the war with enough intensity it may be that the great modern song of war will be written by one of our soldiers on French soil and will embody a point of view undreamt of by Rupert Brooke or Alan Seeger or Frederic Manning even though all of these have given us beautiful imperishable poems As modern war is more grim and terrible and world engulfing than ever war was before so the new war song when it comes may well express a terror and beauty and an over arching infinite love beyond the highest or deepest possible reach of the singers of lesser ages As yet the poets all those writing in English have but touched the edges of the awful subject They have been tossed by the shore waves of the world s emotion they are not on the vast mid ocean tides  Some critics try to comfort us with the assurance that the best war poem will be written after the war But history is not convincing on this point the chance of it then may be more improbable than now The poet who waits to mature his thought may prove as impotent as the laggard in battle He should take a gambler s chance of immortality today tomorrow may be too late   Will Art Happen  POETRY will help him POETRY is eager to be the medium of his interpretation of the present crisis POETRY will print promptly we repeat any expression of it which in the opinion of the editors is poetry and not merely journalism whatever the poet s point of view may be If our poets are strongly moved whether for rapture or protest by a consideration of what this nation or the present crisis means to them we may even print an American number presenting their varying ideas William Vaughn Moody wrote as we all remember an Ode in Time of Hesitation who will do as well with an Ode in Time of War H M  NATURE THEMES IN ANCIENT HAWAIIAN POETRY  The poetic genius of primitive Hawaii was essentially Polynesian Hawaii was the remotest northernmost colony of the unique adolescent culture which blossomed on the coral garlands of the isle sprinkled South Seas The first migrants to the north brought with them the legends and chants of the home land Their songs and poems are strewn with references to Ka hiki the mystical cradle of the Polynesian race  Nature themes form the matrix of the myths and songs of all primitive peoples It is not surprising to find them plentiful in old Hawaiian verse which was rich in nature imagery and local allusion A detailed knowledge of Hawaiian natural history and native life is necessary to understand fully the meles songs of the pre European period  Hawaiian poetry abounds in references to the ocean Most of these allusions are microscopically specific the native poet   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  was intimately familiar with the coasts and reefs every tiny headland had its name and story every strip of coral beach was the scene of some heroic exploit The following portion of a dance song hula describes the approach of a storm from the sea the poet is standing on a rocky promontory and notes the anticipatory phenomena  Black crabs are climbing Crabs from the great sea Sea that is darkling Black crabs and gray crabs Scuttle o er the reef plate Billows are tumbling and lashing Beating and surging nigh Sea shells are crawling up And lurking in holes Are the eels o u and o i But taste the sea weed a kaha kaha Ka hiki how the sea rages The wild sea of Kane  This and the other translations quoted were made by the eminent student of Hawaiian folklore Dr Nathaniel B Emerson who devoted the leisure of a long and scholarly life to study of the ancient Hawaiian civilization The original texts may be found in his monumental treatise The Unwritten Literature of Hawaii which was published by the Smithsonian Institution some years ago  Another fine poem on a nature theme describes a rain storm This mele formed the first stanza of a song for the ala a papa dance the dance of highest rank and dignity According to Dr Emerson In its best days this was a stately and dignified performance comparable to the old fashioned courtly minuet The scene is laid in Ko o lau the wind   Nature Themes in Ancient Hawaiian Poetry  ward district of Oahu Ko o lau is bounded on one side by  the sea on the other by a magnificent mountain wall The  poet describes the rain advancing from the sea across the  lowlands and finally dashing itself against the great preci  pices Twas in Ko o lau I met with the rain It comes with lifting and tossing of dust Advancing in columns dashing along The rain it sighs in the forest The rain it beats and whelms like the surf It smites it smites now the land Pasty the earth from the stamping rain Full run the streams a rushing flood The mountain wall leaps with the rain See the water chafing its bounds like a dog A raging dog gnawing its way to pass out A quaint fancy of the Hawaiian led him to endow the  beautiful tree snails ka huli with vocal powers These  shells are prettily banded with various shades of green brown  black and white They were formerly abundant in the  humid forests and were gathered by the natives for neck  laces Here is a Song of the Tree Shell Trill a far Trill a near A dainty song wreath Wreathe ako lea Ko lea ko lea  Fetch me some dew  Dew from the pink ako lea The ako lea is a beautiful climbing fern with reddish stems The ko lea is the red breasted plover The Hawaiian poet  delighted in plays upon words and here the chirping of the snail suggested to his onomatopoetic imagination the names of the fern and the bird   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The shark mano is plentiful in Hawaiian waters It had a prominent place in many ancient legends and religious beliefs Individual sharks were worshiped as demigods The spirits of certain persons either before or after death were believed to have taken possession of certain sharks Occasionally they resumed human form These human shark monsters were greatly dreaded because of their ravenous lust for human flesh The famous shark Ni uhi mentioned in the song given below belonged to this class  One of the ancient animal dances was dedicated to the shark god and was called hula mano shark dance According to Dr Emerson the performers assumed a sitting posture the action was quiet and not spectacular and the mele was cantillated in distinct and quiet tone and manner  Alas I am seized by the shark great shark  Lala kea with triple banked teeth  The stratum of Lono is gone  Torn up by the monster shark  Ni uhi with fiery eyes  That flamed in the deep blue sea  Alas and alas  When flowers the wili wili tree  That is the time when the shark god bites  Alas I am seized by the huge shark  O blue sea O dark sea  Foam mottled sea of Kane  What pleasure I took in my dancing  Alas now consumed by the monster shark Lala kea was a designation for the whole class of man eating sea monsters Stratum of lono was one of the underlying strata of the earth that must be passed before reaching the Hawaiian Hades The wili wili is a lowland tree that flow   Nature Themes in Ancient Hawaiian Poetry  ers in the spring and early summer in these months parents forbade their children from swimming in the deep waters for fear of the shark Kane was the chief god of the Hawaiians  Undoubtedly the most characteristic nature theme in Hawaiian verse is the volcano and its fiery goddess Pele Around her name mightiest of the Polynesian goddesses accumulated a mass of lore and legend The following stanza from an ancient mele of eight stanzas is representative  Heaven s painted one side by the dawn Her curtains half open half drawn A rumbling is heard far below Wakea insists he will know The name of the god that tremors the land Tis I grumbles Pele I have scooped out the pit Hu e hu e A pit that reaches to fire A fire fresh kindled by Pele  Now day climbs up to the east Morn folds the curtains of night The spade of sapper resounds neath the plain The goddess is at it again  In another mele the poet views the destruction wrought  by one of Pele s dreadful lava flows The beautiful wood  land is devastated and the humid Hilo district is scorched by  rivers of fire  Puna smokes mid the bowling of rocks Wood and rock the she god heaps in confusion The plain Olu ea is one bed of live coals Puna is strewn with fire clean to A pua Thickets and tall trees a blazing Sweep on O fire ax thy flame shooting flood  The bones of wet Hilo rattle from drought   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  She turns for comfort to mountain to sea Fissured and broken resolved to dust  Dr Emerson considers The Water of Kane the finest em  bodiment of the romantico mystical idealism of the ancient  philosophy Kane was the chief god The imagery of the  poem recalls passages from the Vedic hymns The last three  stanzas will suffice to show the rich nature symbolism of this  Polynesian masterpiece It is the supreme expression in Ha  waiian nature poetry  This question I ask of you Where pray is the Water of Kane Yonder at sea on the ocean In the driving rain In the heavenly bow In the pile up mist wraith In the blood red rainfall In the ghost pale cloud form There is the Water of Kane  One question I put to you Where where is the Water of Kane Up on high is the Water of Kane In the heavenly blue In the black piled cloud In the black black cloud In the black mottled sacred cloud of the gods There is the Water of Kane  One question I ask of you Where flows the Water of Kane Deep in the ground in the gushing spring In the ducts of Kane and Loa A well spring of water to quaff A water of magic power The water of life Life Oh give us this life  Vaughan MacCaughey   REVIEWS  MR ROBINSON IN CAMELOT  Merlin by Edwin Arlington Robinson Macmillan Co  Que diable faites vous dans cette galère one might ask Mr Robinson when one finds him trying to resuscitate Merlin and Vivian and King Arthur and others of that overworked and much over poetized Camelot crowd To tell the truth they do not show very disquieting signs of life at the touch of his blank verse wand although they indulge freely in long discursive monologues and dialogues He puts Merlin and Vivian through new paces quite domesticates them at Broceliande  Now be a pleasant Merlin Vivian said and gives us a glimpse of the poor foiled flouted miserable king with his old illusions that were dead forever but there is little magic in his touch upon any of these familiar figures  It is too late in the day to touch them without magic even though the poet s purpose be not mainly with their familiar drama but with his philosophy of life He uses Merlin to show us once more the wise man the king maker wearying of wisdom and power and utterly content with love until finding that his cold angel s name was Change he is forced back upon philosophy And he uses this episode and the whole Camelot tragedy to show the tragedy of human destiny which mixes up wise man fool and king until one can not tell them apart and confounds their plots and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  counterplots their crusades and wars all the elaborate machinery of their presumptuous ruling of men s lives And of course through all this the poet has modern affairs in mind as well as those of the little mythical group so dear to song and story  It is Robinson experimenting à la Tennyson and the fusion is not complete There are passages of orgulous blank verse if we may borrow Merlin s word in praise of Vivian many long and wisely reflective speeches but they are neither in our temper and dialect nor in those of the time honored heroes of the Morte d Arthur Such a speech as this of the shorn sage to his charmer for example is neither fish flesh nor fowl  My dear fair lady And there is not another under heaven So fair as you are as I see you now I cannot look at you too much and eat And I must eat or be untimely ashes Whereon the light of your celestial gaze Would fall I fear me for no longer time Than on the solemn dust of Jeremiah Whose beard you likened once in heathen jest To mine that now is no man s  And Vivian who is represented as pleased for a brief period with this solemnly pompous love making Vivian who as the slip cover kindly informs us for the first time in modern literature comes to her own what does Mr Robinson make of the witch lady of old romance  Alas we become too familiar with her with the usual consequence She dissipates her witchery in speeches of forty or more smooth pentameter lines uttered while Merlin is   Mr Robinson in Camelot  in the noose of her soft arms like this  Look at me now and say if what I say Be folly or not for ray unquiet head Is no conceit of mine I had it first When I was born and I shall have it with me Till my unquiet soul is on its way To be I hope where souls are quieter  This from the author of such a masterpiece as Ben Jonson  Entertains a Man from Stratford  It is queer what a fascination those old tales have for the most indigenous poets One would have pronounced Mr Robinson immune now that he has had a light case of the fever perhaps he will be H M  A MISGUIDED POET  Sappho in Levkas and Other Poems by William Alexander Percy Yale Univ Press This book has been so much praised by highly respected  reviewers that I have taken it up a number of times with a firm resolve to read it But each time I have failed Only the heroic purpose of writing about it enables me to read it because it is full of everything that I most dislike and resent in poetry from words and phrases imitative of a bygone diction or manner like guerdon methinks of yore the empurpled air the limpid surge of darkness the gray and lucent hour the gods ambrosial dalliance and hundreds more such minor derelictions to the mortal sin of sacrilegious misuse of a great name and an ancient tradition  It is strange that the lyric Sappho whose fame rests upon some thirty magic lines should have inspired more long   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  winded poetic palaver than any prolix queen of history She whose song was of a poignant brevity is made in this case to utter page after page of such cannery talk as this I quote at hap hazard for it s all alike  When shining day aroused the earth and rae  I turned me from that road side home full fledged  In Aphrodite Not the gales of spring  Dashing the tenuous frayed clouds high up the sky  Were plumed with wilder rapture than my heart  Nor was the earth s red longing for fruition  More hot than mine for Phaon  It should be explained that the lady s monologue is addressed to Zeus who was probably asleep as he does not reply Her eloquence continues through no less than five hundred lines long and short and finally culminates in the following outburst as she takes the fatal plunge  Ah madness madness uncoil old anguish Ah O cool gray wind of dawn O sea Thou harlot hearted woman sleep And wake thou Sappho leafy templed child of God Upon the lovely world another day Come fearless piteous heart of mine come At last the comfort and the cleansing of the sea  Is there anyone who can hear the supreme lyric poet of the world addressing in this strain either Zeus or herself  The shorter poems are not so flagrant in mediocrity two or three sonnets Invocation Wild Geese show talent but a talent breaking to pieces on old rocks The poet is so involved with inherited ideas so netted in the pleached style of Keats that he can t get out from shore and give his craft a fair chance in the open sea Even the American mocking   A Misguided Poet  bird s song of triumph and unwisdom suggests Antinous to him And he actually calls his sweetheart love beginning his ode To Lucrezia with these moving lines  Pause we within the sunset love  Rare is such time so lovely and so passionless  And sweeter far than when the proud gold morning  Withers the dew with scorn and in his youth  Pause here and let me speak  As lover never spoke to his beloved  Surely the last line is true but the poet should not make a merit of it  I have dwelt at some length upon this book because it represents certain tendencies which the modern poet should avoid with every fibre of his being and every effort of his art Mr Percy is manifestly a student and he thinks like some of his readers and reviewers that poetry can be made out of  old familiar devices a special jargon an involved and inverted style ancient myths and heroes etc The result is a smothering of whatever inspiration he started out with an absolutely artificial product with neither simplicity sincerity nor emotion three qualities indispensable in poetry H M  AVENGED  The Flower from the Ashes and Other Verse by Edith M Thomas Thos B Mosher  The White Messenger and Other War Poems by Edith M Thomas Richard G Badger These books remind me of an evening in 1909 when I  read in Harpers Weekly Miss Thomas centenary article   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  on Poe in which she proved to her entire satisfaction that Poe was no poet I did not care what the lady thought or proved or thought she proved but there was something in the spirit of that article as of a lash wielded by the grim ghost of that cold New England respectability which had pursued Poe throughout his life and which now tactfully seized upon his hundredth birthday to stamp on his laurelled grave something which made me vow like the youthful Hannibal eternal enmity  So I am not quite sure of being free from prejudice when I find it impossible to read these books I dip in here and there and find respectability still protecting dulness Poe is avenged H M  CHILD VERSE FOR GROWN UPS  Songs of a Baby s Day by Frances Shaw with illustrations  by Sylvia Shaw A C McClurg amp Co  To the readers of POETRY who have known the appeal of Mrs Shaw s work and to everyone else this rare little book should come as a delight The suggestion of music with which it opens gives us at once the receptive mood Its contents have sung themselves naturally and poetically from the mother instinct The language is not that of an infant for an infant is with no language but a cry nor may an infant be said to think These songs are rather an interpretation of the feel of a baby in arms and this feel has been expressed by Mrs Shaw more truly than I have seen it expressed before The poet s mood is one of delicate humor with a light   Child Verse for Grown Ups  touch upon harmonies more subtle than they seem at the first glance  We who speak quite naturally of going out to dine must chuckle when she makes her small singer say when I go up to dine Here is a sample of the baby sensation  I am a little hunter bold My daily food I seek I take a lick at everything That passes by my cheek In menfolk s cuffs and ladies sleeves There s nothing to be found It seems to me there s only one Quite happy hunting ground  Miss Sylvia Shaw has caught the mood of the songs in her sympathetic illustrations Agnes Freer  The Little God by Katharine Howard Sherman French amp Co This is an engaging book of child verse for grown ups  by a poet who has hitherto been known for grown up work The little hero of the poems wonders everything The crocus the rose the stinging honey bee the miz the poblum and many other things divert his inquiring mind which sighs  I wish I could remember When I was just a worm  One day he runs away but let him tell it I ran away I climbed the garden wall And ran into the day It was so big and wide I couldn t play I don t know why   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But I was quite afraid Just God and I Alone in the daylight I was afraid He couldn t See me from the sky I felt so small  I couldn t play at all The wild flowers Were different from ours And then some way or other I grew afraid of God I wanted Mother  The book gives us with a certain simplicity and sincerity the quaint wonder and humor and bitterness of little people s lives as they appear to a sympathetic poet looking in the window of their minds H M  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  THE VIGILANTES  It is useless to remind ourselves that the war has been forced upon us with the deadly insistence of a sum in arithmetic the crisis is spiritual We find ourselves wondering what the reaction of the poets will be will it be the old emotional reaction of individual sacrifice as with Rupert Brooke or will it be something different W e do not think there will be any Hymns of Hate That is not the spirit in which we have entered the war But one thing is sure the country will look to its poets for inspiration and justification even as it looks to soldiers and inventors for material aid And the nature of the response will be in some sort a test of the sympathy between the two Will there be   The Vigilantes  any popular poets of the stature of Whittier or Lowell The best poetry about war is usually about wars that are over like many love songs Very little real poetry is written in the heat of battle except the marching songs which correspond in measure to the dynamic pressure of the times or the songs which with little intrinsic merit yet serve to gather up and focus a national mood and so live forever with a sort of trailing emotional connotation which the lines themselves hardly warrant  Already a movement has been set on foot designed in some fashion to mobilize the poets writers and artists of the country The Vigilantes with headquarters at 110 West 34th Street New York City is a non partisan organization of authors artists writers and others for patriotic purposes The articles and poems contributed to the Vigilantes are syndicated to a news service which includes practically every newspaper of any importance in the country  It will be interesting to see what this very democratic way of commandeering Pegasus will produce Writers and artists who desire to offer their services to their country are requested to communicate at once with the Executive Secretary of the Vigilantes A C H  AN EXPLANATION  The Poetry Society of America officially objects to a statement by W W New York correspondent of the London Poetry Review to the effect that it owes its existence to the inspiration furnished by the English Poetry Society   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  According to Mr Edward J Wheeler president of the  P S A the inspiration came from Paris not London From the founding of the American society in the spring of 1910 its model was the Paris Salon of Poetry and its members were unaware that the English society had been founded in 1909  New poetry societies continue to be founded The Ohio Valley Poetry Society with headquarters at Cincinnati has had an enthusiastic first season also the San Diego Chapter of the P S A  CORRESPONDENCE  Dear POETRY This is the way some of us felt WHEN SPOON RIVER CAME  We never were on any of the maps And railroad folders dotted us and left Our destiny to the particular god Who watches over one horse country towns And then to find our annals written down In black and white in poetry in a book No wonder we felt strange  Joe Noble bought The book when he went into Hamlinburg To buy embalming fluid for you see Joe runs along with his Emporium An undertaking parlor  One blue day In April I met Reverend Snow close by The stone bridge at the edge of town He too Smelt something in the air He stopped and then I knew it wasn t altogether spring That brought the Baptist minister so far From Main Street s sidewalks It was plain to see   Correspondence  The Reverend Snow was wrestling with his soul It didn t seem quite decent to draw up And talk about the weather so I passed And wondered  Well it wasn t very long Till everybody had a furtive look And Doctor Clark began to take the back Road into town And Mr Templeton Our banker seemed to have a nervous trick Of laughing and of puckering up his eyes Whenever we went in to draw some gold Miss Curran when I met her on the way To school and banged my milk cans wouldn t smile That quick lipped smile of hers my little joke Fell flat She seemed so young and wistful like Something like smoke and yet it wasn t smoke Came drifting in and shut us from the sun I felt it like a fever in my bones I wasn t sick and yet I could have sworn People looked mottled sort of yellowish And walked as though their eyes weren t very clear And then I got it straight from Reverend Snow It came all thumbed and blurred and underscored I read it through three times  I think I know Why Reverend Snow went out beyond the bridge And didn t hear the larks in Miller s Field I think I know why Doctor Clark comes home From country cases by the town s back door I think I know why Mr Templeton Broke down and had to go to Hamlinburg To take some sort of treatment for his heart I think I understand at least almost Why poor Miss Curran fainted at her desk I think Who is that man who found us out We never were on any of the maps  Leslie Nelson Jennings  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TW O DOLLARS A YEAR  With the beginning of Volume XI October 1917 the subscription price of POETRY will be advanced to two dollars a year and single numbers to twenty cents The heavy increase in the price of paper and in all other expenses of the business makes this change absolutely necessary in fact subscribers get the benefit of our endowment to such a degree that even the new subscription price will not cover the actual cost oí the twelve monthly numbers  The endowment fund for the next five years is not yet large enough to ensure the future of the magazine If our friends think POETRY ought to continue they should help We ask some special evidence of support from each reader who believes that the art needs an organ and especially this organ however imperfect  To be sure of continuing we should have several hundred Supporting Subscribers at ten dollars a year  And we ask each of our regular subscribers to secure one other subscriber Until October first subscriptions will be received at the old rate of 1 50 per year Send in your renewals and add besides a new name to our list  In time of war cherish the arts  APOLOGIES TO SARA TEASDALE  After a two years respite from serious error POETRY has to apologize for a ruinous misprint besides another of less importance in the group of poems by Sara Teasdale printed last month In the first poem Barter on page 124 the last two lines of the second stanza should read  And for your spirit s still delight Holy thoughts that star the night In the poem Spirit s House on page 125 the word the in the eighth line should be stricken out and we beg all subscribers to   Apologies to Sara Teasdale  draw a line through it in their copies The line should read  For I have good of all my pain  The first error is corrected in a reprint of the whole leaf which our readers will find opposite the Books Received in the present number This leaf should be removed and pasted in its proper place in the June number instead of the faulty leaf The attention of binders especially should be called to it and all copies of Volume X bound in this office will be so corrected  This error represents a curious bit of printer s devil malice The first proof which was carefully read by both editor and author was correct Who could have dreamed that the typesetter losing a line from his form would so neatly fit in another poet s line matching it up not only in length but in rhyme Ingenuity in mischief could go no further and unfortunately the editor s eagle eye was deceived  NOTES  Our readers have often been informed about most of the poets in this number Mr Lindsay will add these poems and others to a new edition of The Congo and Other Poems which the Macmillan Co will issue next autumn He reminds us
