PASTORAL  A Story That Has for its Background Saint Patrick s Purgatory  Characters Jonathan Swift and Esther Vanhomrigh  ESTHER I know the answer tis ingenious I m tired of your riddles Doctor Swift Swift Faith so am I Esther But that s no reason why you ll be splenetic Swift Then let us walk Esther But will you talk too Oh is there nothing For you to show your pupil on this highway Swift The road to Dublin and the road that leads Out of this sunken country   Esther I see a Harper A Harper and a country lout his fellow Upon the highway  Swift I know the Harper  Esther The Doctor knows so much but what of that He ll stay splenetic  Swift I have seen this Harper On many a road I know his name too I know a story that they tell about him  Esther And will it take the pucker off his brow If Cadenus to Vanessa tell the tale  Swift God knows it might His name s O Carolan Turlough O Carolan and there is a woman To make this story almost pastoral  Esther Some Oonagh or some Sheelah I ll engage  Swift Her name Was Bridget Cruise She would not wed him And he wed one who had another name And made himself a Minstrel but a Minstrel Of consequence His playing on the harp Was the one glory that in Ireland stayed After lost battles and old pride cast down Where he went men would say Horses we may not own nor swords may carry   But Turlough O Carolan plays upon the harp And Turlough O Carolan s ten fingers bring us Horses and swords gold wine and victory  Esther Oh that is eloquence  Swift I know their rhapsodies But to O Carolan He played and drank full cups made proper songs In praise of banquets wine cups and young maids Things easily praised And then when he was old  Esther How old  Swift Two score of years and ten  Esther But that s not old  Swift And that s not old Good God how soon we grow Into the Valley of the Shadow of Death Not into the Valley Vanessa mark of Death But into the Shadow Two score of years and ten Have we not three score and some more to live So has that tree that s withered at the top Dead in the head Aye we Vanessa grow Into the Shadow and in the Shadow stay So long  Esther I thought the story would divert Cadenus  Swift It will it will Vanessa What was I Then saying   Esther When he was old  Swift When he was old And blind did I say he was blind  Esther You did not say it  Swift He s blind not book blind but stone blind He cannot see The wen that makes two heads upon the fellow That goes beside him hunched up with the harp He cannot see The Justice to the assizes riding With soldiers all in red to give him state He cannot see The beggar s lice and sores  I tell a story When this O Carolan was old and blind As I have said he made the pilgrimage Twas to No no twas not the place That I m proscribed to but yet one that is called Saint Patrick s Purgatory  Tis on an island in a lake a low Island or islet The water round Is dun unsunned there are no meadows near No willows grow no lark nor linnet sings A fissure in the island leads down to The Purgatory of Souls their fable says   And now the Harper is but one of those The countless wretches who have brought their sores To that low island and brought darkened spirits Such stream has flowed there for a thousand years I do not know What length of time the Harper stays while crowds Are shambling all around him weeping praying Famishing themselves or drinking the dun water Of the lake for wine or kneeling with their knees On sharpened stones or crowded In narrow stony cells  Esther It is a place Papistical  Swift It is a place Most universal Do we not walk Upon a ground that s drenched with tears and breathe An air that s thickened with men s darkened spirits Aye and on an islet Suffering pain and hearing cries of wretches Cut off remote banished alone tormented Name the place as you will or let it be Saint Patrick s Purgatory  But comes a time the blind man rows to shore From that low island He touches shore and cries Hands for a blind man s help and hands were held He touched a hand   Here then s the pastoral The hand the fingers of the hand the clasp The spirit flowing through he knew them all He knew all well and in an instant knew them And he cried out The hand of Bridget Cruise  Oh in the midmost of our darkened spirits To touch a hand and know the truth within it The truth that s clasped that holds the truth that s all For us for every day we live the truth To touch that hand and then once more to turn To turn around upon the world s highway And go alone poor hand poor hand  But she This Bridget Cruise was leaving that dull shore For that low island and had cares beyond The memory of O Carolan Well they passed He going and she coming well and then He took his harp and the country lout his fellow Went with him as we see them going now  Esther They ve passed there is no one now beside us And will you take my hand You used to call me A white witch but there is no witchery In this plain hand of mine  You told a double story Doctor Swift  Padraic Colum   KEATS TO FANNY BRAWNE  Fanny If in your arms my soul could slip Arms that my love first fancied not the grave Cities of Hate and Madness round me rave And Love with anguished finger at the lip Fares shelterless These have my fellowship Memory and Loneliness What s left To brave Death But before it Tragedy not to crave You changed or truly seen The hemlock drip Of rains upon half lived or ruined springs Where you dance smiling numbs me now and soothes Hopes that once sought a beauty gone before Losses have stripped me But the vanishings Of winter winds leave me to starry truths Who once desired you but desire no more  Edgar Lee Masters   A GOODNIGHT  Go to sleep though of course you will not to tideless waves thundering slantwise against strong embankments rattle and swish of spray dashed thirty feet high caught by the lake wind scattered and strewn broadcast in over the steady car rails Sleep sleep Gulls cries in a wind gust broken by the wind calculating wings set above the field of waves breaking Go to sleep to the lunge between foam crests refuse churned in the recoil Food Food Offal Offal that holds them in the air wave white for the one purpose feather upon feather the wild chill in their eyes the hoarseness in their voices sleep sleep   Gentlefooted crowds are treading out your lullaby Their arms nudge they brush shoulders hitch this way then that mass and surge at the crossings lullaby lullaby The wild fowl police whistles the enraged roar of the traffic machine shrieks it is all to put you to sleep to soften your limbs in relaxed postures and that your head slip sidewise and your hair loosen and fall over your eyes and over your mouth brushing your lips wistfully that you may dream sleep and dream   William Carlos Williams  A black fungus springs out about lonely church doors sleep sleep The Night coming down upon the wet boulevard would start you awake with his message to have in at your window Pay no heed to him He storms at your sill with cooings with gesticulations curses You will not let him in He would keep you from sleeping He would have you sit under your desk lamp brooding pondering he would have you slide out the drawer take up the ornamented dagger and handle it It is late it is nineteen nineteen go to sleep his cries are a lullaby his jabbering is a sleep well my baby he is a crackbrained messenger  The maid waking you in the morning when you are up and dressing the rustle of your clothes as you raise them it is the same tune At table the cold greenish split grapefruit its juice on the tongue the clink of the spoon in your coffee the toast odors say it over and over  The open street door lets in the breath of the morning wind from over the lake The bus coming to a halt grinds from its sullen brakes lullaby lullaby The crackle of a newspaper the movement of the troubled coat beside you sleep sleep sleep sleep    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It is the sting of snow the burning liquor of the moonlight the rush of rain in the gutters packed with dead leaves go to sleep go to sleep And the night passes and never passes  William Carlos Williams  FEEL OF BRAMBLES  She will bear him children with straight backs and sturdy  limbs Clear eyed children with untroubled minds Mine would have been brown things questioners With little hoofs I think Lovers of wind and rain And twisted brambly paths over the hills But he was afraid afraid of the brown hoofed ones And more afraid that sometimes As we grew old together I would slip away from him to the hills Where he because of gout or girth or civic dignity Could not come after  He need not have been troubled Long before that I should have lost the feel of brambles  Hazel Rawson Cades   THROUGH WINDOWS  LUMBERMEN  I watch the lumbermen Winding up the mountain Between the autumn branches I see Leaves gold red flame and green With flashes of faded blue between Of their overalls Straining and pulling Horses brown and soiled white Stagger up the mountain side Before them Dragging huge and heavy timber Down in the valley I can hear the echo Of the men s muffled curses And the quick snap Of long thin whips  SOILED HANDS  After everyone had left It was always so wonderful sitting in the dark theatre with you There was a mystery about it   POETRY A Magazine of V erse  As though the echo of many plays Still lingered in the folds of the curtain While phantom figures crouched low in the chairs Beating applause with vapor hands Do you remember how we always sat silently I would shut my eyes to feel your closeness nearer Then slowly and like a ritual I would take your hand And you would laugh a little and say My hands are awfully sticky or I can t seem to keep my hands clean in this theatre As if that mattered as if that mattered   UNREALITY  Through the window pane I see your face Its outline a little vague In the dimness of the shadow But the whiteness of your skin Is like a clean ship s sail Standing out in the darkness of a night And your eyes I see them like two golden bowls With the rays of a thousand moonbeams sweeping over them As I pass out into the blackness I wonder if I have ever really known you Or if you exist at all  And are not but a twisted fevered silver creation of my brain   Mercedes de A costa  And the unreality of you comes over me Like a mist upon a lonely sea  TO VOULETTI  There is not a leaf grown Not a breeze that s blown Not a sweet fragrant tree That is not you to me  In the sunlight I feel your smile In the moonlight the whole long while I feel the pressure of your hand And feeling this I understand  I understand all sacred things The depths of life the secret wings That carry beyond the dreary way Turning dark to light and night to day  All things fine and straight and true I know better because of you While your sweetness is like a warm fresh shower And your face and soul like a sun kissed flower  Mercedes de A costa POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THREE POEMS  DEIRDRE  Now thou art hidden I have no place of rest Where should I sleep when the earth lies on thy heart The darkness had no peril when thy arms were round me  Naoise But where shall I hide from the night now that I am alone The stones that will cover my body are all I desire  The light of the sun is a burden too heavy for me I would I could shut out all but the darkness wherein thou  dwellest I that had more treasure than the great kings of the world I am bare to the wind without shelter without love Henceforth for ever I have nothing but grief and silence and  weeping  SILENCE  Be wroth then if thou wilt but no more be silent Wrath love will heal but a sword is forged in thy silence For then is heard the crying for love in my breast And the echoless beating of my heart  DISILLUSION  Darkness and the wind are between the tall stones of the temple   Moireen Fox a Cheavasa  No priest is there no voice no fire on the altar Silence alone and darkness and the mocking wind  This is the end of dreams O empty sky O deaf and silent earth O broken dreams I have besought the dust that my hands hold  Moireen Fox a Cheavasa  THE SORROWFUL MASQUERADE  Even as to a music stately and sad The young girl s feet begin to move in a dance And curiously for joy shift and advance So to a mournful waltz sombre and sweet All laughing things move with delighted feet So all things that draw light and laughing breath Move to the mournful waltz of life and death Comedy is a girl dancing in time To the tragic pipes sorrowful and sublime And ever she laughs back and as she skips Mimics the mournful music with her lips Then for sheer anger at her own pretense Sobs violently at her own vehemence And mocks her tears But when the pipings sleep She needs must cover up her face and weep  John Hall Wheelock   TO ONE WHO ASKS  Curious you should not see my feet are weary Weary of the way you see so fair As wondering you look along each silver path with question  Why I will not tread  Curious you should not see my eyes are weary Weary of the sorrow and the passion they have seen Asking now to close the last kiss given  The last word said  Curious you should not see my hands are weary Weary with their ceaseless fluttering round little things  Concerned no longer with caresses nor with loving  Still and uncomforted  Your young desire would take away my sorrow Do you not see I have but ashes for you I would not lay upon your eager breast  My weary head  Your feet are hurrying your soul is hungering You of the intent eyes the questing will Why do you ask my two tired empty hands  To give you bread  You will not see my very soul is weary  I think it died long long ago or fled  Would you ask caresses from a shadow woman  Kisses from the dead Mary Aldis   LYRICS  I Your hands Lilies of white flame Your hands That knew   But now Crossed thus And cold They are more beautiful Than eucharist lilies cooled with snow  II  All day her hair lay spread upon the grass Where winds pass I could not pass  And now  Here in the midst of heaven  In this music room God s resting room Above angelic singing Through my heart will pass This memory this song  All day her hair lay spread upon the grass Where winds pass I could not pass Harold Cook   TWO POEMS  WHENCE  I do not know who sings my songs Before they are sung by me  For my mind is an ordered house  Where never a song should be  And the world is the sort of a place  That my judicious spirit grieves  Yet when my thoughts are seated round  With their eyes upon the ground  The little songs come flimmering Like swallows round the eaves  And when my life is as dry as a gourd My heart the pebble rattled by despair Shaken at the funeral Of all the gods that were I stretch my thoughts in the empty room And suddenly my songs are there  UNWORTHY LOVE  How is it with my heart Since I can love you Flawed in the casting So that your spirit   Mary Austin  When I strike it with nobleness Rings no tone truly  Yet at that flattened note The soul of every sense Shouldering each on each Runs and looks out of the windows While deep in the house of life Age long unimagined instincts Bay at the voice of the master  Mary Austin  PRESAGE  He has loved me for my gaiety Not for quiet moods or thoughts that bless He has loved me for my wayward grace Not because he knew my tenderness  So our love is transient and as frail As a moth or darting dragonfly There s no memory of peace to heal  Any wound that comes Our love will die  F S Putnam   SONGS OF YOUTH  SEEKING LOVE  He said he knew nothing of love  And asked the flower to tell him  What it meant  The flower turned its face upward  And sunbeams came to kiss it  While it held the bee in its embrace  He shook his head I do not understand  He called upon the bird for love  And the bird began to sing so sweetly  That one could but listen  A mate was soon returning the serenade  And then they met and were off together  His face was perplexed  The snow he thought might know  What love truly was  But his fleecy friends were seeking peace  On earth s warm breast  He moved slowly on  I tried to tell him what he sought  Two parts of a soul that were cut  By the shears of God Unite this is called love He was solemn   Benjamin Rosenbaum  One night he passed away  And I saw him in a dream  I am in love with Death  He said  I did not understand  GONE  She is gone  Gone The night was moaning  Under the whip of the wind  I was off through it Throwing myself against its emptiness As it clutched me And sent a shiver down my back Where were the stars and the moon  Some thief had taken them As he had taken her The hairless trees were talking wildly They were as mad as I But I was speechless The lazy hours slowly plodded along Until God took pity And placed a red light in the east While Peace sprinkled her flowers everywhere And I found her   GLIMPSES OF HER  I know where you got  Your blushing cheeks  Red rose  And why you can bedeck  Yourself in blue  O succory  You too Fields of wheat Are in this plot You tried to keep The secret of your grace With the wind But we fools called poets Understand your language  And you pure lilies of white You also I must call thieves But I m glad you are I m glad you all are For Mary s journey is far flung And I must see A glimpse of her As she trips along So blush your reddest my rose Show me her eyes my succory Dance again O fields of wheat   Benjamin Rosenbaum  And you my lilies just be white As her little white hands  MY PURPLE GOWN FROM TYRE  Pink azaleas and dogwood Are crowded close at my feet Whitethroats and warblers Are weaving a trail between the trees And cobalt golden sky Now I ll mount Ole Tony and ride The rolling fields Old Ninevah s riches will be around me And my overalls will be My purple gown from Tyre  Benjamin Rosenbaum  TH E FEARLESS  As Winter fleeing Leaves the shreds of its ermine To be crunched into murk The fearless leave Their names  Mortimer J Adler   SPECTRE THEME  My little new love Is like a wistfully singing violin on a moon drenched hill So I wrapped her carefully in my thoughts And carried her to a room Where she might surrender her eyelids to my lips And dry my tears in her hair But suddenly you were there Beloved ghost With your eyes like two open doors to sorrow s chamber You were so nearly afraid to speak Your words were blown toward me Like fragments of mist Distorted and scattered by wind But my little new love She who is more shy than drops of rain Trembled and fled from me And then there were only we two Poor ghosts Shrinking against opposite walls of the room Staring  Leone Bakes   REFLECTIONS  NEIGHBOR MOON  I  Like a bulb of ivory ready to burst The moon came up beside us It reminded me of her beautiful body Beginning to swell with my new child  The swelling moon smiled down Half in pain half in fear And laid her long fingers on my wife s hair My love beside me pressed my hand Proud with white majesty From the mother moon  II  Gentle moon Will you kiss it my baby When it lies sleeping  Beside her  Give it  Her beauty  Her passion  Gentle moon  III  Already her breasts are swollen   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Suddenly the light of the moon penetrates her And proudly she takes me in her arms  In the moonlight her hair seems like cold metal But when I touch it it is soft and warm She is tired and quiet in my arms And listens absently to the little noises of the night In her eyes I see the reflection of the blood running Through her bosom into the veins of her child  IV  Moon chaste one Forgive me If under your rays I have been brutal with caresses You had many breasts then You were insatiable then Chaste moon  PROFILE  The clear line of her profile reminded me of an ancient relief I saw at the Louvre some Ceasar s wife Tranquil and wise gazing unregretfully Across the hysteric ages into old Rome  Long long ago I thought some great senator Lay at her feet and watched the evening light Stamp her face on the smooth wall and wondered   Charles deGuire Christoph  At her beauty and how the shadows of her lashes Made fine laces on her cheeks and how her eyes Caught the sun and burned deeply and evenly And he smiled at the amorous curve of her chin and wished To touch her lips wine and silk and poesy  That was perhaps in Rome but I know now My lady has a leper s heart her lips Are torture and her eyes reflect such shame There is no help and on her cheek there clings The sad voluptuousness of drunken Time Dancing like a cretin in an aimless whirl  I find no harmony I had no right to try  To gain such end while all the wise ones sneer  When years have tired and turn their meagre faces  Again to the old there may again be peace  For poets singing there may again be love  OLD PLACES  I must flee the prod of my neighbor  I want to go back to old places  Where I can sit in revery and watch time crumble  Think thoughts that have served and become useless  Listen to the piping of senile gods  And the prayers of long forgotten priests  I want to go back to old places  Rotten with beauty dying with beauty   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THOUGHT OF WOMEN  What is there that mocks me in a woman s eyes There is a taste of disdain even in my mistress s kiss And I have told them I am very wise  What is the melodrama I m the victim of I fear I m a songbird for a show of marionettes So says the playman a tender little dove  If their skirts swish like clarinets And their breasts are silken tambourines Then I ve a little opera but it s not enough Why holds that merriment in the pipes of love  What s in a woman s head what under her hermiton Not a sigh not a wound will the cure be But laughing the wind laughing Over the torn trees as the elder satyrs Run drunken before it and the maenads  Hide in the old caves  HERONS  Many many herons  Fly across the sky  Sky full of my thoughts They are moving among my thoughts Many V shaped birds Like boats for my thoughts to sail in   Charles deGuire Christoph  Many many heroes Fly with the herons Men and ladies among the stars  Poets and lovers I know Many swift heroes Humming like words for a poem  IMPROVISATION  Tell me the singing glory of my woe Poet who can hold the pen to paper for I go Silently down the neuter tinted pathways of old streams Lazily frowning waiting still the beams Of suns extended in some dazzling secret sky To show me beauty on my heart before I die Great Beauty shrouded in her multi colored pall With kisses for my lips and sweetness for the gall That stings them  So some have always gone My burden s but a little flowery load upon Old monks and lovers smiling in their graves And singing kings somewhere who once were slaves Like me  Why scan so long O poet say He wandered and he waited till he found where Beauty lay  Charles deGuire Christoph  COMMENT  WHAT ARE THEY DOING  WHAT are the women s clubs doing said the crit ical observer somewhere in Iowa where the editor happened to be journeying through the Indian summer weather Here is the richest per capita state in the Union with more colleges to the square mile than it knows what to do with and all the women organized into clubs which are fiddle faddling with every subject from Homer to garbage Yet we can t get anything done which requires a little tight fist loosening even the roads that our rich farmers drive their Fords through are made of mud Why don t the women s clubs wake people up start something instead of holding good clothes meetings and lionizing the latest celebrity  I looked around it was the same familiar crowd of women yes and a few men somewhat too well dressed and well fed for a tempered human weapon in this democratic age the same rather wistful crowd of housed and guarded souls holding resolutely to the material goods they felt sure of and casting about doubtfully and frugally for half suspected spiritual joys What were they doing Anything beyond the satisfaction of personal ambition and curiosity beyond of kind of intellectual bargain hunting involving emotions of triumph almost as keen as the under price purchase of a fur coat   What are They Doing  The dryness the drabness the thinness of life in this land where generous nature invites to richness and beauty that is the danger which has come with the waning of the Puritan ideal The original Puritan lived an intense religious life his faith was narrow perhaps but it struck deep He walked in the light of it he lived with his stern exacting God He was frugal no doubt but saving money was not his chief problem he had to save his soul His religion fed his imagination with visions of heaven and hell under the impulse of it spiritual life embryonic or more developed was possible  But as time went on bringing new generations and scientific revelations this heavenly manna turned to dust and ashes The village bounded Puritan ideal could not reach out with modern science and grow with international experience Though it may still survive with some vitality in little strangely islanded and isolated church groups here and there it has been swept away as a spiritual motive from minds aware of their world  Now when mediaeval Christianity was swept away as a spiritual motive by the deluge of the Renaissance its long and sedulous cultivation of the creative instinct of beauty left the arts as a refuge for human souls Roman Catholicism had become merely a symbolic social system perhaps for men caught in the new current but in the ever creative arts they could live vitally and imaginatively the life of the spirit But to the Puritan the arts were a temptation of Satan even the creative instinct of beauty was suspect   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  So when his fenced in religion withered his spirit had nothing left to feed on grasping at material desires mere food and shelter splendors the spirit in man starving but undying found these as it must always find them the gilded husks of death  W e have come a long way from women s clubs perhaps but not too far to get back The women s clubs were one response to this spiritual need a wistful search for living grain instead of husks And they have done much they have ploughed up the ground perhaps fertilized it for a new harvest The only trouble is they don t know what to plant they lack insight and direction They get too much blind satisfaction out of good works useful material benefits and fail to realize that their planting should be of food for the spirit that the one indispensable need of this country is for an enriched spiritual life  Now an enriched spiritual life in any community is possible only through development of the imagination the creative instinct of beauty Religion does that whenever and wherever it springs in each individual soul from a real and vital faith The arts do it whenever and where ever they spring in each individual soul from a real and vital faith No human being was ever created who had not somewhere within him the instinct to create beauty The zealot creates God the supreme beauty The lover creates his ideal mistress the mother creates the child both love shaped into living beauty The statesman the philosopher create beauty in orderly societies and abstract unities the   What are They Doing  carpenter in his panelled wall the farmer in his evenly planted field The too common suppression of this universal instinct through misuse of the machine through the marshalling of hands without brains to monotonous labor through the idle pleasures and accumulations of the rich through other time consuming soul destroying abuses of modern civilization is chiefly responsible for social unrest and the perversion of this instinct is chiefly responsible for crime  To develop and direct this instinct for the creation of beauty to resist the tendency toward sterilization of the mind in our educative and industrial processes in short to enrich the imaginative life of the people this should be the primal aim of our women s clubs and all our cultural organizations In admitting for example as any frank observer is compelled to that clothes are the only form of artistic self expression of which nine tenths of our young girls are keenly aware is to draw up an indictment against their parents and teachers and the whole system which has brought them up to such sterility of the imagination Joy in clothes is better than no creative joys at all but why shouldn t these girls have been led to sing dance rhyme carve make toys or furniture textures or garments or even delicious dishes to create something of their own And this not by the imposition of laws and examples from the past but by the exercise of that personal impulse toward artistic expression which animates the little dancing picture drawing child   Every woman s club should be an agency through which its members their children and their community in general can advance to more complete self expression in beauty It should aim at the discovery and encouragement of each person s imaginative impulse or artistic aptitude of each person s special dream and not be discouraged if the response is often crude or trivial  But perhaps this would mean a reversal of systems of education and schools of thought beside which the Russian revolution is as a molehill to a mountain H M  TWO POETS HAVE DIED  The recent death of two poets enforce a sharp contrast between their characters and careers John Reed and Louise Imogen Guiney were alike only in their courage and spiritual integrity and in their love of the art which they practised too fitfully in all other details no two human beings could be more different than the shy recluse who died in Oxford and the rash adventurer of countless wars who died in Moscow  John Reed was so active in radical politics as to have too little time left for poetry but in this place it is proper to record that his neglect of the art was accident and not intention Like Jack London he was always dreaming of tomorrow s masterpiece Knowing himself for a poet he hoped to prove his vocation by many poems worthy to   Two Poets have Died  endure but life was so exciting and the social struggle in these States and Mexico in Finland Russia everywhere so tempting to a fighting radical that poetry had to wait for the leisure which alas never came  My too slight acquaintance with John Reed dates from a letter of September 11 1912 written at Portland Oregon which began as follows  Dear Miss Monroe This is the first time I have ever been invited to contribute poetry or verse to anything I shall not be slow to take advantage of it and herewith enclose several verses as a starter There are many of us who have published in the magazines and who without any feeling that a materialistic public refuses us recognition still feel that the magazines are degrading the quality of poetry in America just as they have begun to degrade the Short Story for which they were originally responsible I am myself on the staff of a magazine and have often heard the editors say that poetry was a declining art The reasons they gave might interest you as they did me That the public had lost the appreciation of rhythm because verse was no longer spoken or sung and that the printed poem conveyed no sense of melody to those who read only with the eye  I do not believe this to be so And I have found that among men of whatever class if they are deeply stirred by emotion poetry appeals as indeed all the arts appeal The apathetic mawkishly religious middle class are our enemies A labor leader for example who has been indicted for complicity in the dynamite plots read aloud to me Neihardt s Man Song more naturally and beautifully than I have ever heard a verse read And I think that wherever men are deeply stirred all their living becomes attuned to the unheard systole and diastole of their pulses Art must cease I think to be for the aesthetic enjoyment of a few highly sensitive minds It must go back to its original sources  But there is no fairness in excluding the aristocracy from the democracy of art So I am delighted at the broadness of your aims in POETRY which is open to all forms and all thought Only in the open forum can anything vital or lasting be evolved   Enclosed in this letter came the beautiful ballad Sangar dedicated to Lincoln Steffens and symbolizing what Reed called his magnificent try for peace during the trial of the McNamaras Today we might almost apply the poem to Reed himself for although he loved a fight as well as any soldier his dream was of a peaceful co operative world which I fear he would have found very dull that wonderful new world in which as Gorky says of Lenin s dream all men are reasonable and the earth is a gigantic jewel facetted with beautiful evidences of the labor of a free humanity In the fight for his dream he died would it violate his knighthood to wish him peace at last  Sangar has been reprinted in The New Poetry so it is unnecessary to repeat it here but it may be in order at this moment to remind our readers of John Reed s last appearance in the magazine with the beautiful lyric in praise of  Proud New York  By proud New York and its man piled Matterhorns The hard blue sky overhead and the west wind blowing Steam plumes waving from sun glittering pinnacles And deep streets shaking to the million river  Manhattan zoned with ships the cruel Youngest of all the world s great towns Thy bodice bright with many a jewel Imperially crowned with crowns  Who that has known thee but shall burn In exile till he come again To do thy bitter will O stern Moon of the tides of men   Two Poets have Died  Miss Guiney too had a fighting spirit though her life was stilled by circumstances The editor remembers with gratitude how valiantly she then an influential Bostonian spoke out for the Columbian Ode in its first moment when the scornful East was waiting to fall upon Chicago for assigning this honor to a local young and unknown poet Her books of verse The White Sail A Roadside Harp and The Martyr s Idyl reveal her fine high quality and two or three prose works reveal her scholarship The flavor of the nineties is in her poetry and much of it seems a bit old fashioned today But her final selected and collected Happy Ending contains a few memorable lyrics This one The Knight Errant suggested by Donatello s Saint George has always seemed to me a keenly personal confession  Spirits of old that bore me And set me meek of mind Between great dreams before me And deeds as great behind Knowing humanity my star As first abroad I ride Shall help me wear with every scar Honor at eventide  Let claws of lightning clutch me From summer s groaning cloud Or ever malice touch me And glory make me proud Oh give my youth my faith my sword Choice of the heart s desire A short life in the saddle Lord Not long life by the fire  Forethought and recollection Rivet mine armor gay   The passion for perfection Redeem ray failing way The arrows of the upper slope From sudden ambush cast Rain quick and true with one to ope My Paradise at last  I fear no breathing bowman But only east and west The awful other foeman Empowered in my breast The outer fray in the sun shall be The inner beneath the moon And may Our Lady lend to me Sight of the Dragon soon  They were true to the vision both these dead poets even though their achievement was as with all the high desiring imperfect and incomplete One may wish them fulfilment either peace or a good fight in a happier world  H M  REVIEWS  TH E OLD ADAM  The New Adam by Louis Untermeyer Harcourt Brace amp Howe It is a pity that Mr Untermeyer should have prefaced  his book of love poems with a Note on the Poetry of Love for it induces in the reader a too critical attitude a mood inimical to love poems In spite of one s attempt to shut the preface from one s mind in reading the poems one wonders if the poems themselves have not grown out of a too   The Old Adam  conscious effort to produce an effect or sustain a theory rather than to record a passion Are there any poems in the book in which the poet has really lost himself as one feels that Burns for instance lost himself in his Or are there any that move us as Burns songs move us or as Mr Yeats love poems move us And Mr Yeats by virtue of his romanticism is akin to the Victorian poets cited by Mr Untermeyer as not knowing how to express what love between the sexes really meant Burns by the way is not mentioned in Mr Untermeyer s preface and he might include him as a sentimental poet therefore not akin to the modern school which supposedly discards the sentimental Although there was certainly nothing of red plush Dresden China perfumed or perverse about Burns passion But the fact is that love is a sentimental passion and the more deeply in love the poet is the less likely he is to analyze it or to objectify the subject of his passion If one cite in contradiction to this the analytical fervor of Mr D H Lawrence one may answer that the analysis here is really a detailed progression of the passion more subjective than objective and that Woman or even a woman is no more revealed in Mr Lawrence s poems than in Swinburne s Tennyson s or Rossetti s according to Mr Untermeyer The fact again is that as passion is the real subject of love poetry so whether written by man or woman love poetry always reveals the writer rather than the object of his love Dramatic poetry of course has more objective scope and hence one may find in it the   images of both loved and lover But if Tennyson is thin he is quite as thin on the masculine as on the feminine side  However let us turn to Mr Untermeyer s poems themselves The first one in the book The New Adam is an expression of sexual passion through symbols One distinguishing feature of the older poets was what they left unsaid probably because they thought some things could not be expressed The effort to paint the sun is perhaps self defeating at the start And yet although the new Adam is found to be the old Adam after all it is in poems which show the struggle of a man against his passion that is against the subjugation of his personality that Mr Untermeyer is at his best Perhaps this is the modern note the source of masculine as well as feminine unrest If the older poets did not feel it so much it must have been that they were less rather than more sentimental about love than the moderns At any rate it is not a primitive characteristic and modern love thus brings in its train together with a heightened perception of itself an equal degree of self torturing analysis negation and affirmation much of which is perhaps at the root as falsely sentimental as the Victorians Whether or not you capitalize Vice Virtue or Adultery as Swinburne may have done or call them with Dr Freud complexes the subjective matter of the Victorian love poets and those of today is not greatly changed A lovers quarrel remains a lovers quarrel even though you call it neurosis If Mr Untermeyer wants to make a chasm between poets who write of love it must   The Old Adam  therefore be a chasm of greater distance Certainly there is less in common between the poets of today and the Elizabethans than between these poets and the Victorians  It is obviously quite impossible to keep off Mr Untermeyer s preface But I was going to say that A Marriage Wrangle Neurosis are among the most successful in the book He is curiously more able to stir angry passions than he is to arouse the softer ones Some poets are better haters than lovers and the note of protest which is one side of hate has always been a distinctive feature of this poet s work Thus Words for a Jig To Be Danced on the Grave of an Enemy has a sprightly vitality  Mr Untermeyer s book will live for me however because of one perfect line It occurs in an otherwise imperfect poem Infidelity of which I quote only the middle stanzas  It is not you I love it is the form And shadow of all lovers who have died That gives you all the freshness of a warm And unfamiliar bride  It is your name I breathe your hands I seek  It will be you when you are gone  And yet the dream the name I cannot speak Is that that lures me on  A poem more perfect as a whole is Matter Here are the last two stanzas  But after a lifetime Of hunger and prayer I broke my heart trying To make the world care   And now as I lie here Feeding this tree I am more to the world Than it is to me  When it comes to treating of derelicts Mr Untermeyer hardly proves his case against Swinburne and Rossetti and if he is less theatric or if he has another kind of theatricality  She drifts by under the lights Flaunting her tattered sails Wreck of a thousand nights And a thousand gales  he is also less human however humanitarian and also less the poet This last is of course the final test only by surpassing the earlier poets of love could Mr Untermeyer have upheld the challenge of his preface It was perhaps more courageous than judicious to invite comparison with the eighteenth and nineteenth century poets who were he says in spite of their graceful decorations clumsy in the use of their material ignorant at least as artists of the possibilities of their most common property i e Woman as their subject Are there not many of us who can still read the love poems of Shelley Keats Byron Wordsworth Burns Arnold Dowson Henley and others without feeling that they are merely stucco A C H   The Cleverest Young Poet in England  THE CLEVEREST YOUNG POET IN ENGLAND  Leda by Aldous Huxley Geo H Doran Co I wish Aldous Huxley hadn t written the poem Leda He should have left that to Richard Le Gallienne or some other sweet singer It has a stale taste an indigestible taste in spite of the spice which is plentiful Better if he had reduced the myth to a symbol and a mystery as he did later with Helen and Priapus How can a man today attempt a re creation Reading the Greeks themselves is a corrective Homer Hesiod the tragedians even the philosophers either believed in their gods and heroes or lived where the worship of them or the controversy over them was alive where the names had a very near and pregnant significance For a modern poet to try such a thing is a dilletantism Either he makes watery paraphrases as William Morris did or he frankly gives plot and high names like Hewlett to men and women If Huxley had believed in Jupiter he could have given him divinity without rhetoric Not believing in him all his careful memories all his elaborate verbal façades are not enough to make Zeus God or man or symbol It was a nice fancy to indicate the god by rendering the women touched by his mere scrutinizing glance forever after incapable of mortal embraces But he must explain how Leda mother of his child could still accept Tyndareus by whom she bore a mortal twin to the son of divinity That is to say this device like the others   fails Zeus is neither god nor man his passion is neither of man nor of beast its motivation is neither muscular nor mechanic Essentially it is a bad poem with some retrieving patches lines of radiance and loveliness but it is a poem that should not have been written  It is among the other poems that one may find Huxley s real work Leda is a digression with strains in it that offer the cue to what follows pieces of varying mood the inimitable philosopher s songs a long question or a search called Beauty and the young man s day Soles Occidere et Redire Possunt which contains so equally paralysis and convulsion and which is so like a symphonic poem that a program note is prefixed  To me indifferent as to whether he got his forms from  T S Eliot or not all this is a consummate expression of the reactions of an artist facing the world today Life has been well nigh drained of beauty Those who retort that the same protest was made in all ages should do some rereading In no period of human self consciousness was the plaint of the barrenness and the ugliness of life so universal  Reviewers have spoken about Huxley s disillusions as though they were personal disillusions No they are the artist s disillusions the artist s even involuntary recording of the aspects of life While the professional warblers are twittering as though there were still forests around them the sensitive the intelligent are either going outside of our age and culture for their beauty or retiring into themselves building about them an impenetrable idiom or they   The Cleverest Young Poet in England  are matching a raucous civilization with a raucous literature  Huxley combines the two latter He is a word virtuoso His diction borders upon a preciosity depending upon caco phany His themes disregarding certain disguises are all troubled exposures of the corruption of beauty There is bitterness in it a jaded mockery teasing with ambiguous words a mockery however that is too skilful too atti tudinous In his diction there are too many grotesques and gargoyles unfortunately hung on Greek cornices It is this superficial smartness and sophistication which has made reviewers hail him as the cleverest young poet in England But there is in it a force and authenticity that make it an authoritative comment upon life It puts him honorably high among his contemporaries  It is not great poetry It is my conviction however that no great poetry will be written for a long time An upheaval as structural as Christianity has been breaking up the shapes of life and has left a formlessness it has made tradition sterile and unfit for the cultivation of art The first minds have turned eclectics commentators have almost abandoned creation and there is no sustenance in our life itself Artists may escape to the unencroached corners of existence where beauty is still possible But harshness and ugliness are closing in will in time preempt them  I have left only an aside Since Huxley lives in England where Negroes are still phenomenal he has let his first strong reaction and his imperfect ethnography overbalance his artistic sense Throughout the Negro is his symbol   for the beast The Negro is as mythical to him as a figure from the ancients and can serve equally as a symbol a symbol for animalism It was so in Happy Families in Limbo it is so indicated as distinctly in Leda Verreys and Frascatis and it is implied elsewhere  To conclude Leda is a curious and always interesting collection of poems by a young man of genius it presents a definite individuality Its relations with Limbo are very close Soles Occidere et Redire Possunt contains the essence of Happily Ever After the shorter poems are like the shorter pieces in Limbo even Leda has the hot breath that rose in The Death of Tully  Huxley is therefore salient and palpable Reviewers who see Keats in Leda and T S Eliot in Soles Occidere et Redire Possunt oh for a handier title are apt to miss Aldous Huxley I suppose it is hard for the reviewer to deny himself the gossip of influences and knowingness feels so comfortably like discernment Hyperion and Leda are as different as the meanings of the two words sensuous and ethereal and Huxley and Eliot are as different well as different as Prufrock and Portrait of a Lady are from Beauty and Soles Occidere Isidor Schneider  THROUGH A MIST DARKLY  The House of Dust by Conrad Aiken Four Seas Co It is as though he had looked too long at the sun and when he turns to nearer objects he is half blinded there   Through a Mist Darkly  is always the shadow of his own concentration For Mr Aiken sees everything from a cabaret scene to death itself  Death is a chorded music softly going By sweet transition from key to richer key Death is a meeting place of sea and sea  He sees everything through a mist of intensified reflection It is his weakness and his strength For though his dealing with reality has all the tenuous unsubstantiality of a sleepwalker is never simple direct stark is never real still it pleases the senses is a delicious narcotic to the mind It is as though he romanced over the newspaper for his knowledge of crime could have no other source romanced with crudity sordidness touching them forgivingly with musical fingers  And of course his faults his languorous in door objective ness his idealistic leaning to melodrama are entirely lost or are turned to assets when he deals with nuances with music particularly with music with overtones undertones interludes chimeras emotional and mental dreams and illusions Here he is pre eminent He goes sure footed among shadows He is accustomed to the half light If he is looking at a tangible object a clear cut ordinary Ugliness he half closes his eyes in distress and lo half seeing it he finds it not so ugly after all An absurdity ugliness I will not have it so And he does not But when he finds beauty the faintest possibility of beauty abroad he pursues courts sublimates it makes of the possibility an   ecstatic fact He breathes his reverence upon beauty with a sheer delicacy that is as frost on the silhouette of a tree  The House of Dust is predicated a symphony and though the parts are in my opinion of unequal merit they are enough related to make quoting particularly difficult almost unfair And it is all so pleasing to read has such soft rhythms For instance number VIII of Part I  The white fog creeps from the cold sea over the city Over the pale grey tumbled towers And settles among the roofs the pale grey walls Curls like a dream among the motionless trees And seems to freeze The fog slips ghost like into a thousand rooms  Whirls over sleeping faces Spins in an atomy dance round misty street lamps And blows in cloudy waves over open spaces  And one from his high window looking down Peers at the cloud white town And thinks its island towers are like a dream It seems an enormous sleeper within whose brain Laborious shadows revolve and break and gleam  Marion Strobel  THE DEMOCRACY OF GENIUS  Tête d Or The Hostage and Three Poems of the War by Paul Claudel Yale University Press This article is intended as a sketch rather than a criticism According to my knowledge of French literature from  the fifties to date a quick glance shows us a thunderstorm passing Hugo a heavy bespattering beslopping but puri   The Democracy of Genius  fying rain Zola then the subtleties of uncertain weathers short lived phenomena lacking solidity and quantity Verlaine Rimbaud Mallarmé Laforgue Verlaine the dead calm nausea of sweet sophistication Rimbaud the earthquake of sophistication soon over Mallarmé the magic the mystery and the absurdity of sophistication the contemplation of the apparently still falsely still skies of sophistication Laforgue the clever and pathetic suicide of sophistication rain and mists and a sad play of wet elements Sophistication tangle muddle torment struggle mystery all the uncertain weathers Then the dawn came which is often a phenomenon of indefinite colors a beautiful dawn came but with no great bursting of red in the sky Charles Péguy the honest man the wonderful writer the happy writer the fire works of a holiday of France Charles Louis Philippe France s Dolstoievsky Then in the trail of this dawn the very brief false lights that are no longer dawn and not yet day Jammes Fort Vildrac Romains Claudel  I must here insert that my knowledge of modern writers is limited to poets and I must confess little knowledge of Rolland s work Over these the great noontide of modern French literature will sweep or it won t  Very conspicuous among the new falsities is Claudel s His particular attribute is pseudo simplicity he is falsely simple illusorily tall emptily big These words are perhaps too strong if they would fit a pseudo simple American they do not fit a pseudo simple Frenchman Claudel has French cleverness erudition culture to help him deceive   us But they all come to nothing because he wearies us Wherefor we are spurred to seek the cause of our weariness  Here are popes glittering with gold and majesty here are generals and counts by the dozen here is Tête d Or a splendid title by the way here is a cortège of grand things rumbling along making one grand noise But there is no restraint in noise and we suspect that in this case the noise is made so that we shall not hear the words  It will not be too strong to say Paul Claudel is such an expert liar as to seem often an involuntary liar And it will be wise perhaps to say that he is sometimes quite involuntarily a liar that is to say a sincere man as some lines of his poems beautiful bear witness It is very difficult to find him out more difficult still to dislike him entirely more difficult still to like him really and as you can imagine quite difficult to criticize him  His faults are either hidden or camouflaged or moderate His faults are not even entirely ugly for his merits stand in the way of his faults He is a man of great discernment but with too many vices We see his intelligence in this his personages are false but they are not fools they are talkative but they are not like Drinkwater s imbeciles  Claudel is the substitute for a genius Nietzsche writes  Thus Spake Zarathustra and Claudel in Tête d Or writes  the tale of a man who also accompanies with much shouting  and lamenting the struggle of his spirit But whereas Zara  thustra convinces us that something is ailing him in Tête  d Or we detect an effort to convince us in the too long   The Democracy of Genius  winded oratorical exercises of Tête d Or himself and our faith is gone thereby This effort that I am speaking of is a subtlety that is not subtle a simplicity that is not cannot be simple the simplicity of each single separate speech facing the revealing bluff of the enormity of the mise en scène It s a man talking like a baby and dressed like a king  Whereas Carlyle writes a furiously beautiful singingly romantic history of the French Revolution studded as with pearls with beautiful anecdotes Claudel gives us The Hostage another play where the simplicity of each person is matched by the tangle of the whole pope conspiracy Napoleon in the background a woman courted by a sheer villain who represents nothing less than the French Revolution in Claudel s mind everything in the play by this single fact being made small and ridiculous  Whereas Péguy writes a tale of love of Jeanne d Arc and her country which was his own Claudel too insistent on religious love needs miracle and all the Catholic paraphernalia to express it  Whereas Victor Hugo writes two dozen rotten poems and one good one for his pet abomination Napoléon le Petit in which poems however there is always real anger disorderly anger therefore not yet poetry which might be anger but must be beautiful Claudel writes such war poems as a hundred others wrote during that great tremendous silence that was the World War poems in which the popular sort of anger and the popular sort of enthusiasm are most absurdly unreal   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Most of his religion when we come to it is as empty or as mysterious as the resounding phrases of the Catholic rites uttered by an uncomprehending priest indeed it often consists of these very phrases  As a synthetic social phenomenon Claudel has not even a seeming existence His religion is not such as Verlaine s which represented a sagging not only in literature but in life it is instead mere thin and dissipated love for the grandiloquence of Catholic symbols and rituals He is an individualist and an aristocrat But his aristocracy is not so much a reaction to the democratic trend of today as it is that same mania for bombast pomposity He is a national in the wrong way he is French and national because he is theatrical Theatricalism is a popular French vice which arose almost to a virtue in Victor Hugo inasmuch as Claudel is very theatrical he finds a response in France he is admired and was once the leader of a group or school And one must repeat again it is not Rostand s theatricalism pseudo patriotic and nauseating it is a better thing better put up sometimes almost sincere sometimes even sincere Here is a man hitting with an unsteady fist big gongs hit and hit and hit sometimes he hits the center and a fine sound is heard and besides this racket he makes has a metallic undertow of sound that is not unbeautiful Claudel is a man who misuses his own good material  Today s France is prolific of these half and half men There is no national genius to my knowledge but there are men who within their limitations are perfect But Ver   laine said that perfection is mediocrity Jules Romains does one kind of work perfectly Francis Jammes is a perfect stammerer gooish girlish sweet man Paul Fort is a drum and piccolo mountebank greatly happy whose prolixity never ceases to be at least entertaining Charles Vildrac is a perfect heavy man Gide a perfect clever one Spire is unfortunately little known to me and so Claudel is a perfectly faking stern and tragic man with a pedantry that is very near biblical and a bombast that is very near Hugoish But of course all these are not perfect they are one armed men  Genius has perhaps become democratic and in order to distribute its fire to so very many it has cut down the portions for very numerous they are these amusing entertaining funny grand and glorious but not great men of the France of today Emanuel Carnevali CORRESPONDENCE  MISS RITTENHOUSE EXPLAINS  Dear Editor of POETRY Will you kindly print in your next issue the following item from the Bulletin of the Poetry Society of America  Readers of the Bulletin have probably seen in the November issue of POETRY a letter from Edgar Lee Masters in which he states that without fault on the part of the judges two of them did not see or consider Starved Rock which was published by the Macmillan Co in early Dec 1919 As an unfortunate and regrettable mistake has been made in regard to Mr Masters book   I wish as Secretary of the Society and the one responsible for it to explain how it occurred  When the judges were appointed by the Society Mr Wheeler asked me to send to each of them a copy of the Bulletin of February 1920 containing the list of books recommended for library purchase thinking that this list while selective rather than complete and therefore not to be taken as a basis for their findings would serve as a ready reference to the more important books of the year In sending out the list however I saw upon it several books not of 1919 such as Barbed Wire by Edwin Ford Piper and Profiles From China by Eunice Tietjens which dated back two years and also The Golden Whales of California by Vachel Lindsay which was prematurely on the list not having been published until January 1920 It was necessary therefore to clarify the list by marginal notes of the correct dates In taking down book after book for examination I came upon Starved Rock and seeing that the title page said 1920 I made this jotting on the margin of the list  Now I know that publishers do occasionally date their books ahead when they appear so near the end of the season but this misleading practice is not so common as to form a rule and it is one s natural instinct to look at the title page of a volume if the first edition and to accept the date recorded there Publishers so frequently copyright a book and print this date on the copyright page but do not in reality issue it until later that when one sees a disparity in the two dates he is justified in thinking the later one to be correct In the case in question the copyright page of Mr Masters book says Published October 1919 whereas he says it was not issued until December and it was already January when the Macmillan Company sent me a press copy of the book bearing the date 1920 on its title page I therefore feel that this mistake in my marginal note which no one regrets more keenly than I is one for which his publishers are equally responsible If publishers deliberately print a date ahead to make the public think a book falls within a certain year they must bear the consequences if the public takes them at their word  No correspondence whatever took place between the judges and myself in regard to Mr Masters book and it was purely from this marginal date that the mistake occurred Later Mr Wheeler asked me to send to Mr Robinson who was at Peterboro and without access to the new books such titles of 1919 as I chanced to have in my own library and naturally supposing Starved   Miss Rittenhouse Explains  Rock to be of 1920 it was not included These books were sent on to Professor Lowes at his request after Mr Robinson had finished with them but it was well understood by the judges that the books loaned by me comprised but a small portion of the output of 1919 not even covering all the books recommended by the Poetry Society and that the award was not to fall within this group As a matter of fact books were sent to the two eastern judges it was assumed that Mrs Henderson being on the staff of POETRY would have them up to the last moment whenever any book was suggested as important Not that it was incumbent upon us to furnish books to the judges nor that we had made any agreement to do so nor that they were to base their findings upon such books but in order to insure the fullest group to choose from I personally wrote to the publishers to send them books whenever one came to my knowledge as having been omitted Is it likely then that I should have tried to withhold from them the work of one of the best known poets in America and a personal friend of mine  The whole matter is a mistake due to the advance date of the Macmillan Company and it can be rectified by having Starved Rock considered with the books of 1920  Jessie B Rittenhouse  Note by the Editor Miss Rittenhouse s mistake was natural probably it would be difficult to avoid all error in listing the books of verse published during a given year But in this case one must acquit the publisher of Starved Rock as the copy of that book sent to us for review bears the date 1919 on its title page Miss Rittenhouse s copy must have been of the second edition  Perhaps the best way to prepare annually for this prize would be to send a circular letter to the publishers requesting from each a list of his verse publications of the year And it would be necessary also to round up the private publications  POEMS IN THE TOUCHSTONE  The following notice will interest our contributors  Dear POETRY The Touchstone 1 West Forty seventh Street New York is to have a new department of poetry and
