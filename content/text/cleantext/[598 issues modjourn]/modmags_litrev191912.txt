delicate flies on streams And got awayThe young ferns balance on the wet earth Like green smoke above a coalLet us watch the sun throw gold plates Down to us through lake water Where none fishII The Recreation Gardens are smothered over With a bottle coloured wood of wet trees And the gates were shut at tenWith your straight thin pipe and your face and arms Stamped black as against mauve paper You sit piping in our open windowIt may be only a very large daintily moving dog Shut in the Gardensand that I did not hear The few notes like a sleepy quailIll I have bought a pound of jade wool Of the colour of the round bases of toy trees And a quarter of mole wool Coloured like the smoke of a steamerIn two or three weeks Youwhose spirit is as quick as silver dust Stirred into the seaShall have the appearance of a tinted Jacinth laughing in the rain6 The Little Review IV There is frost As if a cutter of images ofyou Had dropped powder of geranium marble On the coarse dark grassI have left you asleep And feel that if the candle Set down inside the open door To throw continuous William Allen Richardson roses Into the cold lavender morning Does not blow out before I get back You will still be thereV Because of the glass shade Our marble table was ever the cross bar Of a white A And the rest angles of broken lemon light With a drowned sprig of mountain ash berries peat coloured crystal carrying Cherries and crushed mint against your lipsNow the nights are a cool Pattern of thin black wood bed bars With spread of orange and another orangeFirm black letters lightly carrying eyes Among white marginsAnd brown teaVI The night is so full of movement That the stars seem like corn being threshed Against a blue barnThe wind is a black river And just for a moment The moon a small green fish Swimming in your hair BEYOND THE END by Djuna Barnes BEHIND two spanking horsesin the heat of noon rode Julie AnspacherThe air was full of the sound of windlasses and well waterwherefrom cool abyssesheavy bucketsaroseand too the air was full of the smell of lilac and the faint perfect odor of small flowersAnd Julie turned her headgazing at the familiar line of road that ran away into the still more familiar distanceThe drivera Scandinavianwho remembered one folk tale involving a partridge and one popular song involving a womansat stiffly on his box holding the reins gently over the shining and sleek backs of the two maresHe began to whistle the popular song nowswinging a little on his sturdy baseand drifting back with his tune came the tang of horse skinwet beneath tight leatherThe horses were taking the hillstraining and moving their earsand reaching the topbounded forward in a whirl of dustStill sitting rigid the driver cluckedsnapping his whipand began talking in a dry deep bass It s some time since we have seen youMrsAnspacher Julie raised her thin long face from her collar and nodded Yes she answered in a short voiceand frowned Your husband has gathered in the corn alreadyand the orchards are hanging heavyAre they she saidand tried to remember how many trees there were of apple and of pearThe driver took in another foot of reinsand turning slightly aroundso that he could look at hersaid It s good to see you againMrsAnspacher She began to laugh Is it then with deliberation checked herselfand fixed her angry eyes straight ahead of herThe childloose limbed with excessive youthwho sat at her side lifted a small sharp face on which an aquiline nose perched with comic boldnessShe half heldhalf dropped an old fashioned ermine muffthe tails of which stuck out in all directionsShe looked unhappy and expectant You remember MrsBerling he went on She is married againIs sheYesmaam He began to tell her about the local office for out going mailswhere a nephew of her husbandPay torhad taken a jobThe child sat so still that it was painful and Julie Anspacher moved awaythinking aloud All is corruption The child startedand looked quickly awayas children will at something that they expect but do not understandThe driver beat the horsesuntil long lines of heavy froth appeared at the edges of the harnessWhat did you say maamNothing I said all is lost from the beginning if we only saw it alwaysThe child looked at her slowlypuzzledand looked away Ann said Julie Anspachersuddenly lifting the muff over her hands did you ever see two such big horses before The child turned its head with brightnessand bending down tried to see between the driver s armsThen she smiled Are they yours she whisperedJulie Anspacher took in a deep breathstretching the silk of her waist across her breasts No she answered they are not minebut we have two bigger blackerCan I see themOh yesyou shall see themDon t be ridiculous The child shrank back into herselfclutching nervously at her muffJulie Anspacher returned to her reflectionsIt was almost five years since she had been homeFive years before in just such an autumn the doctors had given her six months to liveOne lung gone and the other goingThey called it sometimes the White Deathandsometimesthe love diseaseShe coughed a littlerememberingand the child at her side coughed too in echoand the driverpuckering his foreheadreflected that MrsAnspacher was not curedShe was thirty nine she should have died at thirty fourIn those five years Pay tor had seen her five timescoming in over fourteen hours of the rails at ChristmasHe cursed the doctorscalled them foolsThe house appeared dull white between the locust trees and lilacand the smokethe same lazy autumn smokerose in a still column straight into the obliterating dayThe driver reined in the horses until their foaming jaws struckagainst their harnessand with a quick bound Julie Anspacher jumped the side of the cartthe short modish tails of her jacket dancing above her hipsShe turned around and thrusting her black gloved hands under the childlifted her outA dog barkedShe began walking the ascent toward the houseA maidin dust capput her head out of an up stairs windowcluckeddrew it inand slammed the sashand Paytorwith slow jand deliberate steps moved toward the figure of his wife and the ChildHe was a man of middle heightwith a close cropped beard that ended in a gray wedge on his chinHe was sturdya strong manalmost too pompousbut with kindly blue eyes and a long thin mouthAs he walked he threw his knees outwhich gave jhim a rocking though substantial gaitHe was slightly surprised and raised the apricot colored veil that covered the keen newness of her faceand leaning down kissed her twice upon both cheeks And where does the Child come from he inquiredtouching the little girl s chin Come alongdon t be ridiculous Julie said impatientlyand swept on toward the houseHe ran after her I m glad to see you he went onwarmlytrying to keep up with her rapid stridesthat swung the child half off the groundstumblingtrotting Tell me what the doctors said cured There was a note of happiness in his voice Not that I really give a damn what they thinkI always told you you would live to a ripe old ageas they sayWhat did they do to Marie BashkirtseffLocked her up in a dark roomshut all the windows and of course she died that was their method then and now its Koch s tuberculin all nonesenseIt s worked well with some people she saidgoing ahead of him into the living room There was one boy there well of that laterWill you have someone put Ann to bedthe trip was bad for herSee how sleepy the child is run alongAnn she addedpushing her slightly but kindly toward the maidThen When they had disappearedshe stood looking about herdrawing off her gloves I m glad you took down the crystals I always hated themShe moved to the windows I didn tthe roof fell in just after my last visit in DecernberYou re looking splendidJulie He colored I m gladyou know awfully gladI began to think wellnot that the doctors know anything he saidlaughing but it s a drop here of about fifteen hundred feetbut your heart is good always wasWhat do you know about my heartPaytor Julie saidangrily You don t know what you are talking about at allThe childWellyes Her name is Ann she finished sulkily It s a sweet name it was your mother s tooWhose is sheOh good heavens Julie cried moving around the room Mineminemine of coursewhose would she be if not mine He looked at her Yours why Julie how absurd Slowly the color left his face I know we have got to talk it over it s all got to be arrangedit s terribleBut she is nicea bright childa good childWhat in the world is all this about he demandedstopping in front of her What are you in this mood for what have I doneGood heavensWhat have you doneWhat a ridiculous man you areWhy nothingof courseabsolutely nothing She waved her arm That s not it why do you bring yourself inI m not blaming youI m not asking to be forgivenI ve been down on my kneesI ve beaten my head on the groundabased myselfbut she said in a terrible voice it is not low enoughthe ground is not low enoughto bend is not enoughto ask forgiveness is nof enoughto receive it is nothingThere isn t the right kind of misery in the world for me to suffernor the right kind of pity for you to feelthere isn t the right word in the world to heal me upIt s good to forgiveto be forgivenbut that s for ordinary thingsThis is beyond that it s something you can experience but never feel there are not enough nervesblood cellsflesh to if eel itYou suffer insufficientlyit s like drinking insufficientlysleeping insufficientlyI m not asking anything because there is nothing that I can receivehow primitive to be able to receiveButJulieIt s not that she said roughlytears swimming in her eyes Of course I love youBut think of ita danger to everyone excepting those like yourselfCuriousinvolved in a problem affecting only a small percent of humanitysickfrightenedfilled with fever and lust perhaps with nothingnothing coming afterwhatever you dobut death then you go on it goes on then the child and life probablyfor a timeWellI couldn t fell youI thought WellI ll die next month and finally I didn t want to go off although I didyou know what I meanThen her father died they say her lungs are weak deathdeath perpetuating itselfthat s funny you see and the doctors She swung around You re right they liedand I lived throughall the way all the way He turned his face from her vThe real thing she went on in a pained voice is to turn our torment toward the perfect designI didn t want to go beyond youthat was not my purposeI thought there was not to be any more meI wanted to leave nothing behind but youonly youYou must believe this or I can t bear it and still she continuedwalking around the room impatiently there was a somehow hysterical joy in it tooI thoughtif you had real perceptionthatsomethingthat we must possessthat must be at the bottom of us somewhere or there wouldn t be such an almost sensuous desire foritthatsomethingthatat timesis so near us that it becomes obscenewell I thoughtif Paytor has this and mind youI knew all the time that you didn t have itthat you would understandAnd when you had been gone a long time I said Paytor understandsand I would say to myselfnow at this moment at ten thirty preciselyif I could be with Paytor he would say T see but so soon as I had the time table in my hand I knew that there was no such feeling in your bosom nothing at allDon t you feel horror he asked in a loud voicesuddenly NoI don t feel horror horror is conflict and I have noneI m alien to lifeHave you a religionJulie he askedstill in the same loud voiceas if he were addressing someone a little raisedyet invisibleas one tries to see a choir I don t know I don t think soI ve tried to believe in something externalsomething that might envelope this and carry it beyond that s what we demand of our faithsisn t itBut I always return to a fixed notion that there is something more fitting than a possible release Heput his hands to his head You know he said I ve always thought that a womanbecause she can have childrenought to know the truth the very fact that she can do something so really preposterousought to make her equally capable of the other preposterous thing well She coughedher handkerchief before her face she laughed with brightness One learns to be careful about death but never never about she didn t finish but stared before her Why did you bring the child here why did you return at all then after so long a time it seems all so mixed upI don t know Perhaps because there is a right anda wrongand a good and an evilI had to find out and if there s such a thing as everlasting mercy I want to find out about that also there s a flavor of unfamiliar intimacy about it all thoughthis Christian treatment She had a way of lifting up the side of her faceclosing her eyes I thought Paytor may knowKnow WhatWill know wellwill be able to divide me against myselfPersonally I don t feel divided I seem to be a sane and balanced whole a hopelessly mixedbut perfect designSo I said Paytor will be able to see where this divides and departsThough all the time I never for a moment felt that there was a system working on a this for that basisbut that there was only this and that in other words I wanted to be set wrong you understandAnd you yourself he inquiredin the same loud voice cannot feel the warWellthenwhat about meyou must realizewhat you have done turned everything upside down ohI won t even say betrayed me it s much less than thatwhat most of us dowe betray circumstances well I can t do anything for you he said sharply I can t do anything at all I m sorryI m very sorrybut there it is he began to grimace and twitch his shoulders The child has it too Julie Anspacher saidlooking up at himI shall die soonIt s ridiculous she addedwith the tears streaming down her face You are strongalways were and so was all your family before younot one of them in their graves under ninety it s all wrong its quite ridiculousI don t knowPerhaps it s not ridiculousOne must be very careful not to cometoo hastilyto a conclusion He began searching for his pipe Only you know yourselfJuliehow I torment myselfif it s a big enough thingfor daysweeksyearsand the reason isthe real reason isthat I come to my conclusions instantlyand then fight to destroy them He seemed to Julie a little pompous now It s because first I m humanand secondlogicalWellI don t know perhaps I ll be able to tell you something later give you a beginning at least later He twitched his shoulders and went outclosing the door after himShe heard him climbing the familiar creaking stairsthe yellow painted stairs that led up into the roof she heard him strike a match then silenceThe dark had begunclosing in about bushes and barnand filling the air with moist joyousnessthe joyousness of spring that trusts its development to the darknessand Julie leaned on her hand by the shelf and listenedShe could hearfar away and faintthe sound of dogs on heavy chainsShe tried to stoplistening to the outsidebut her thoughts rotted away like clouds in a windThe sense of tears came to herbut it was only a sentimental memory of her early childhoodand it brought a smile to her long faceShe had cried once when they made her kiss a dead priest Qui halbitare facit sterilim matrem filiorum laetan ternthenGloria Patri and she wept thenor thought she hadbecause he was not only beyond glory and all mercybut beyond the dubious comfort of the feelingShe heard Paytor walking aboveand the smoke of his pipe crept down between loose boards and uneven plaster and lathsShe went quite mechanically over to a chest in one cornerand opened the lidA shirt waistof striped taffetaone she had worn years beforesome old Spanish lace her mother s the childPaytor did not seem to like the childHow ridiculous she thought She is goodquietgentle but that s not enough now She removed her hatLiving with Paytor and the child Paytor so strongalways wasand so was his family and she sicklycoughingPerhaps she had made a mistake in coming backShe went toward the steps to tell this to Paytor but thought better of itThat wasn t what she wanted to sayThe hours drew out and Julie Anspachersitting now at the window overlooking the garden nodded without sleep long dreams grotesque and abominable stupid irrelevances dull and interminableSomewhere little Ann coughed in her sleepJulie Anspacher coughed alsoand in between the sound of Paytor walking up and downand the smell of tobacco growing strongerTo take her own lifethat was rightif only she had not the habit of fighting deathbut death is past knowingand to know is better than to make right she shook her headThat s another detour on the wrong sideshe told herself If only I had the power to feel pain as unbearabea gust of passionof impatienceand all would be over but I ve stood so much so longthere is no too long She thought what she would not give for any kind of feelinganything that was vital and sudden and determining If Paytor will have patience I will get around to it Then it seemed that something must happenmust inevitably happen If I could only think of the right word before it happensshe said to herselfover and overand over It s because I m cold and I can t thinkI ll think soon She would take her jacket offput on her coatShe got uprunning her hand along the wallOr had she left it on the chair I can t tnink of the word she said to keep her mind on somethingShe turned aroundAll his family long lives And me toome too she murmuredShe became dizzy It is because I must get on my knees but it isn t low enough She contradicted herself Yet if I put my head down way down downThen she heard the shot He has quick warm bloodwent through her mind and her blood was coldHer forehead had not quite touched the boardsnot she touched thembut she got up immediatelystumbling over her dressSURFEIT by Bonamy Dobree ALL three were spinstersand though not related were inseparablebound by that prurience for the personal relation common in country people starved of emotionThe youngest was fortywith eyes half closed with fat so that she always appeared to be full of passionthe eldest had ratty teeth and a weirdly avid walkwhile the thirdwho was about forty fivecarried a vague suggestion of romance in her sallow fading and patiently complaining voiceThey were always to be found at any human event however far away a weddinga funerala birth or a homecomingand especially a deathOncetwo lovers had discovered themselves stared at greedily from the other side of a hedgeOne Sunday afternoon they went for a walk togetherIt was a heavy mist sodden day in Spring that diffused germinating warmth and reeked of fertilityThey went into low lying woods where a stagnant pond pullulated new lifeGlaucous marigolds thrust up through coarse grassesand the mud oozed and bubbled round the edgeWhiteish objects attracted their attentionand moving curiously to look they found two dead toadsbellies upwardcolourless and sickly as though no sun had ever touched themTheir bodies were inflated and their feet were drying stifflyExcitement pervaded the womentheir pulses quickenedand they inhaled deeply through wide nostrilsThe youngest spoke Sum mat have killed tfeem They walked silently round the pooltheir feet squelchinguntil something moving in the water drew their eyesThere was a sharp cryfor they saw a large toaddistended and colourless like the dead ones they had seenwith a little green one fastened to it by hands embedded in the obscene flesh He be the murderer said the eldestThenas they hung transfixed over the poolthe same instinct impelled them to save the large toad s lifeThey were crazedthrew stoneswrenched sticks from the treesand clutched the creatures towards themThey dragged them onto the ground and beat the green toad to deathdisengaging its fin gers from the yielding massWhen it was deadthey stamped it horribly into the earthwhile the big toad hopped one or two feet awayand lay flacidits sides pulsatingthe lidless eyes staringThe three walked back arm in armGems of moisture glittered on the swollen twigs or dropped thudding onto the roadThey were enclosed in a darkening caul of mist as they wentchattering eagerlyarguing as to which of their houses they would have tea inThe eldest and youngest were exuberantThen the thirdwho had seemed to brood for a long time in spite of the part she took in the conversationsaidI believe they were making love The words banked themselves dully on the fogAll three stopped simultaneouslySaliva gathered in the corners of the mouth of the youngestand a wave of heat rushed over her faceThe eldest began to tremble violentlywhile she who had spoken stared expressionless into the baffling mistThenno longer arm in armthey walked homeseparating wordless in the silence of the fog striken nightAfter that it was only occasionally that any two of them were seen togethershamedly avoiding each otherseyesThey ceased to attend the crucial points of human destiniesalthough one or another of them might sometimes be seen hovering on the outskirts of a poignant eventThe partnership had dissolved The Holy Family Osip Zadkine A NEW TESTAMENT by Sherwood Anderson III MY hope is that I may build a structure in your mind into which I may creep on cold daysMy mind has walked with you in forests and fieldsIt has walked with you the states of OhioIndianaIowaIllinoisMichigan The ground is frozen and we walk togetheralong ai path where cattle have been before usWe stop under an oak treeThe red dry leaves still cling to the branches overheadA red leaf has lodged in a place where two great branches go north and southIt is like a tiny drop of blood against the black of the branchesHard snow sifts slowly down through many red leavesIt is winter and the trees bleed in the coldYou have gone alone to walk up and downYou walk up and down in roads and through fields and townsYou shall walk up and down iforeverI have gone to walk up and downIt is night and coldI want to creep into youYou have made me by thinking of me and I declare you should be ashamed of what you have doneWhy have you not made me more pureWhy have you not made me mor e beautifulYour conception of me makes me a little illIt forces me to run away from you into a field of fancyinto a forest of doubtIf I cannot be one who when weary lies in warm human layers of thought I shall become for the nonce and until I am rested something not humanI have passed out of your presenceI become a brightly colored insectI am a boy lying by a river on a summer dayAt my back is an orchardI look dreamily out over warm stagnant watersThere is a reed grows out of the yellow mudIn the orchard at my back a hog gruntsAn insect with brightly colored back and wings comes swinging down streamHe has lived more freely than the waters of a riverI go with him as I would go in at the door of God s house if I knew the street in which God s house standsas I would go into your life if you would leave the door open for meYou are mistaken in thinking I will only exist for a certain number of yearsI do not exist at allI shall exist foreverOnce I thought that by making love to women I could come at truthNow I make love to women as the wings of an insect fleck the waters of a streamTruth liesfar out in the field of fancyin the forest of doubtThere is a woman has just passed the door of my houseThere was abarely perceptible quickening of the pulse of my body She is beautiful I thoughtand said so aloudI arose and went to the door to follow her with my eyesAt the moment when I thought her beautiful a wind had just come skipping and shouting down the streetIt lifted the woman s hat and she threw up her handHer hand made a lovely gestureMy neighbor thewind whispered the story of her beauty to me I will multiply myself until I pass like a vapor out of your mindI am a thing hung suspended in lifeThere is no life in meonly a desire to creep into your arms and sleep after my long walking up and downI am perplexed and it is sweet to me to see that you also are perplexedIf you begin to know me better than I know myself I shall be afraidIf it happens do not tell meGather me within yourself and let me rest from my walking up and downTell me the truth of myself in the darkness of the dusky hallways of yourselfYour whole life is like the dark hallways of a great house late at night when there are no lightsYou are one of many great houses I have visitedRussia is a house and so are youChina is an old houseMany old houses have fallen downFor a long time I had the illusion I was helping to build a new house in which you and Lwere to liveA wind has blown the illusion awayBuilding is going on but I have nothing to do with itIt may be that you are the builderI am perplexed with trying to find out who does the buildingI creep in the dusty hallways and hear many strange voicesThe voices of men and women resound out of the darknessThe voices cry out to me that they are the voices of builders but as I go forwardfeeling with my hands on the wallsI do not come to the place of the buildingA soft voice has whispered to me that there is no such thing as a builderIt was a woman s voice The noise you hear is made by heavy untruths in the hands of arrogant men she said The men lean out at a windowThey beat on a brazen skyThey are trying to make holes in the sky I suspect the soft voice expressed also a hungerIt came from a woman I met in the darknessI had at the moment been running desperately in the dark hallways of my housein the house into which I was dropped at the beginning of lifeI am blind and when I run I knock against thingsI knocked against herMy body had become warm from the runningThe woman may also have been blindOur warm bodies touched in the darknessFor a long time we stood close together in silence and darknessThere was a drumming in my headAll noises ceasedeven the perpetual noise made by those who call themselves buildersIn the darkness I fancied I heard the scream of an animalLater it was quiet again and I heard only the voiceIt spoke softly and told again of the false builders and of the heavy untruths with which they beat on the brazen skyI shall remember the voice telling its beautiful lie as long as I liveThe woman and I shall never find each other againThere are too many hallways in the housesMy house is filled with the smell of jiew cut logs and the walls are rough with the marks of the trowels of buildersMy house is noisy with the clangor of hammersI shall never escape out Of my houseWhen the time comes I shall take an untruth into my handsand lean out at the window to beat on the sky to be continuedINTERIM by Dorothy Richardson Chapter Eight A DAY of blazing heat changed the season suddenlyFlat threatening sunlight travelled round the houseThe shadowysun blinded flower scented waiting room held street baked patients in its deep armchairsSome of them were languidBut none of them sufferedThey kept their freshness and freedom from exhaustion by living away from toil and grimy heatin cool clean clothesmoving swiftly through moving air an carriages and holland blinded hansomshaving ices in expensive shadebeing waited on in the cool depths of west end housestheir lives disturbed only by occasional dentistryThe lean dark patients were like lizardslively and darting and active even in the sweltering heatMiriam s sunless room was cool all dayThrough her grey window she could see the sunlight pouring over the jutting windows of MrLeyton s small hot room and reflected in the grimy sheen of the frosted windows of the denHer day s work was unrealas easy as a dreamAll about her were open sunlit days that her summer could not bringand that yet were hers as she moved amongst thema leaf dropped in the hallthe sight of a summer dresssummer light coming through wide open windows took her out into themSummer would never come again in the old waybut it set her free from coldand let her move about unhampered in the summers of the pastSummer was happinessIndividual things were straws on the stream of summer happiness At tea time in the den there was a darkening hushIt was like a guestturning everyone s attention to itselfabolishing differencessetting free unexpected admissions and sympathiesEveryone spoke of the coming storm and looked beautiful in speakingThe day s work was discussed as if in the presence of an unseen guestShe set out from the house of friends to meet the darkened daylightperhaps the sudden tapping of thunder drops upon her thin blouse The street was a livid greybrilliant with hidden sunlightIn the deep grey the sunlight was happinessThe present can be judged by the part of the1 past it brings upIf the present brings up the happiness of the pastthe present is happy PurgatoryThe waters of Lethe and Eunoe forgetfulness and sweet memory and then HeavenThe Catholics are right about expiationIf you are happy in the present something is being expiatedIf life contains moments of paradise you must be in purgatory looking across the vale of

garretThis year the summer was with herin the house I where she wasFar away within the peace of the room was the evening of a hot summer day at Waldstrassethe girls sitting aboutbeautiful featureless

grouped against the undisturb ing presence of Fraulein PfaffMiriam turned to the near window and peered through the thick mesh of the smoke yellowed lace curtainBehind it the french window stood ajarDrawing aside the thick dust smelling lace she stepped out and drew the door to behind herThere were shabby drawing room chairs standing in an irregular row on the dirty grey stonerailed by a balustrade of dark maroon paintediron railings almost colourless with black grimeBut the elastic outer air was there and away at the end of the street a greatgold pink glow stood above and showed through the feathery upper branches of the trees in Endsleigh GardensA number of people must have been sitting out before dinnerThat was part of their dinner time happinessPresently some of them would come back She scanned the disposition of the chairsThe little comfortable circular velvet chair stood in the middle of the rowconversationally facing the high backed wicker chairThe other chairs were the small stiff velvet seated onesThe one at the north end of the balcony could be turned towards the glowing sky with its back to the rest of the balconyShe reached and turned it and sat downThe opposite houses with their balconies on which groups were already formingstood sideways lost beyond the rim of her glassesThe balcony of the next house was emptyThere was nothing between her and the vista of green feathering up into the intense gold rose glow She could come here every nightfilling her life with green peacepreparing for the stifling heat of the nights in her garretThis yearwith dinner in the cool dining room and the balcony for the eveningthe summer would not be so unbearableShe sat still lifted out into garden freshnessBenedictionPeople were stepping out on to the balcony behind herremarking on the beauty of the eveningtheir voices new and small in the outer airIf she never came out again this summer would be differentIt had begun differentlyShe knew what lay ahead and could be prepared for itShe would find coolness at the heart of the swelter of London if she could keep a tranquil mindThe coolness at the heart of the central swelter was wonderful lifefrom moment to

dayTo recover like this every dayto have at the end of every day a cool solid clear head and rested limbs and the feeling that the strain of work was so far away that it could never returnThe tireless sense of morning and new day that came in moving from part to part of her London evenings and was strongest of all at the end of a long eveninggoing on from a lecture or a theatre to endless leisured readingthe happy gaslight over her book under the sloping roofalways left her in the morning unwilling to get upand made the beginning of the day horrible with lanquor and breakfast a scrambletaken to the accompaniment of guilty listening for the striking of nine o clock from StPancras churchand the angry sense of MrHancock already arriving cool and grey clad at the morning door of Wimpole StreetTo nightgoing strong and steady to her hot roomsleep would be silvery coolShe would wake early and freshand surprise them all at Wimpole Street arriving early and serene after a leisurely breakfastThe rosy light shone into far away scenes with distant friendsThey came into her mind rapidly one by oneand stayed grouped in a radiancesharper and clearer than in experienceShe recalled scenes that had

not attempt a criticism of May Sinclairin the sense of trying to place her either in 1 elation to the writers of her time or in relation to the futureI can t very well believe that any such remarks ever register with the publicreaders of the Little Reviewwho have read Joyce may be able to gauge for themselves the difference between the work of a man of sheer genius and that of a best standard novelistI may be doing May Sinclair an injusticeI offer this as an impressionsince Freud has become to the run of modern writers what Butterick patterns are to the home dressmakerI hesitate to put the thing upon May Sinclairbut the line up of her IIEATEM ALIVEcharacters inMary Olivierreads like the list for a clinicPathological predestination bears small relation to creative inevitabilityBen Hecht

relatives and servantsin her devouring sweetnessMary Olivier who is supposed to be anexceptional beingmentallyspirituallyphysicallyalso an artistis frustrated at every turn by her weak beautiful Mammaher life deferred for forty yearsMay Sinclair has very successfully portrayed this type of mother the carniverous flowerbut she seems to forget that carniverous flowers devour only insectsMary

sincerity could be dropped from the languageWhen primitive man abandonded sincerity civilization beganEven a war workerif he put his mind to itcould see that the whole social structure would collapse if we attempted a return to sincerityEvery institution of the modern world is maintained to protect society from thenaivethe idealists who take a try at itprisonsinsane asylumscensors and the latest deportationAnd still one has to stand champing at the bit while some good citizen gushes over the sincerity of this or that public man or assures us that our magazine would beall rightif the artists contributing to it were only sincere and not trying to be so extremeWho could face the situation of a sincere worldthe boredomthe sights and soundsthe dangerThe greatest service the average man could perform for society would be to cultivate in himself some selected insincerityBut take the sincerity of the artistIt is not his business to be exact about lifethe reality of things is not his concernEven if he should choose to make it so it does not seem very possible that his representation of even the most simple objectafter having passed though his powerfully specialized senses and mind could be very familiarsincereto the publicThe artist is able at times to convey to the enlightened that the emotions and activities of humanity and the grind of nature are not special nor interesting in themselvesThe eternal completedesign is not indicated except by its conscious complementArtThis hydrophobia for sincerity in the Work of an artist might be more worth discussing if it were not so

foreigners of all kindsjhjh Two Concerts of the Month iROBERT ESCHMIDT T0 talk of modern piano playing one must discuss not Rach maninoffProfofiethand Onesteinlike the New York Nationbut a Frenchman by the name of Robert ESchmidtRachmaninoff s beautiful playing is of his own generationof an older traditionand does not pretend to any infusion of really modern feelingProkofieff plays the piano so badly that it doesn t matter whether he plays old music or his own rather interesting compositionsAnd Ornsteinwho has never been able to play as well as even the conventional standards of his generation demandhas certainly not been interesting enough to force a newer or better standard into recognitionIf any one thinks there is no real difference between the old way of playing and the newI can only assume that it will not be the layman who thinks soThese failures to grasp what is going on rest too isecurely with the musicians themselvesjust as only a good old fashioned painter can really excel at misunderstanding the good modern painters The layman knows nothing about thingsbut he usually knows at least that one kind of thing is different from another kindThe musicians I heard talking after MrSchmidt s concert knew that they had been listening to a program of modern musicbut didn t suspect MrSchmidt s qualification for playing itthat isthat he plays with the new and special piano technique which is demanded for the modern composersI heard competent musicians saying the same kind of thing they would say about a Gabrilowitseh concertapplying the same standardized criticism to bothas though MrGabrilowitseh had ever tried to do what MrSchmidt is trying to doI talk of technique so emphatically only because it seems to me that the people who cannot recognize the emotional content of modern music could perhaps get into touch with it by knowing something about the obviously different technique required to play itOf course the fact that the old musical forms would not serve the modern musician for his expression preceeded the fact of the development of a new technique which would allow that expression its full sweepThis is so obvious a matterhow ca a form that has held the feeling of one age offer itself as the receptacle for all another age may need to pour into itThere should be no controversy about the facts of evolutionBut there is almost nothing elseThe popular mind laughsthe professional mind scorns or mistrustsIt s as though the apes had mocked the first men for walking uprightcalled them extremistsfoolsor strivers foreffectbecause the upright position suited their needs better than the going on all foursMrSchmidt is more en rapport with the new musical feeling than any one I have heard play heremore than Cortotwho after all retains the tradition of a certain kind of conventionalbeauty for Chopinetc more than Bauer who has not the full range ofwhat is known as poetic feelingthat MrSchmidt commands Bauer s playing of CthaussonSchonifoergAlbenizetcis superbably intelligentand he plays the MoussorgskyTableaux d une expositionwith more color and life perhaps than any one else who has done it hereBut his Debussy will not compare with MrSchmidt sThe latter must be considered the real Debussy exponent at least so far revealedHe plays Debussy s music with the quiet effortless undulations that are essential for the Debussy tone qualitiesthe effect of moving things in front of sustained movement that cannot be even suggested without the new technique of which I have spokenIn Ravel sPavanne pour une infante défuntehe offers such a study in piano orchestration that it is a pity there were not more sophisticated listeners in the audienceFor one of his encores he played the done to death Chopin nocturne in F sharp with an entirelydifferentChopin feelingmaking it one of the most effective things on an otherwise all modern programBauer s Chopin is quite unrelated to these vibrationsbut they are what I mean by thenew emotions IIBENNO MOISEIWITSCH For a study in old emotions nothing could be better than the Moiseiwitsch concertbeing the very best thing of its kind and illustrating so conclusively how thekindno longer has any place in our livesIt s an extraordinary thing to sit through a concert that overflows with emotions which have died through sheer repetitionand to feel an audience around you still vibratingfrom habitto those emotional values which you know to be deadIt envelops you in a strange embarrassmentThe critics must have brought out their best superlatives for MoiseiwitschI haven t read what they saidbut they couldn t consistently do anything elseHe plays like an old masterwith the power and brilliance and taste that have been accepted foi years asthe basis of great playingHe really does beautiful thingsand the fact that he uses a Mason and Hamlin pianorather than the Steinway which nearly all the great pianists of his type have usedgives him the advantage of sounding more sonorous andsingingthan Paderewskifor instanceever soundedBut all this is negated by the fact that Moiseiwitsch has concerned himself only with musical education he has not concerned himself with musical ideasHaving perfected an equipment by which he can do what he wants with his instrumentand do it as well or better than it has been donehe must now face the situation that other men are working far beyond himworking in an absolutely different materialIf he develops in consciousness this will become a tragedy to himbecause he cannot reach them unless he can discard his educationAnd it is safe to say that he will probably never face the tragedy he appears too happy in his present conceptions ever perhaps to become aware that they no longer serve Margaret AndersonRollandsColus

in the innocence of the skies and all told with a serenity and clarity more limpid than may be found in the work of Turgenev or de Maupassant Bubu de Montparnasseis the pimp of a prostitute of that quarterHer tragedy develops through a merely circumstantial account of her lifeThe slightest hint of a dramatic situation causes Phillipe to make a great detour to avoid ityet the story is as effective as blows from a bludgeonLes Soeurs Vatard offers resemblances but the relation is that of an ode to a lyricBerthe the girl inBubuis permitted emotionshe almost on occasion makes a scene but even when she finds she has contracted diseaseno relief is afforded her in a dramatic explosionThere isit is truea crisis but immediately she accomodates herself il faut vivre imagemade her life of itdreamtthoughtwarmed it all in her bosomMarie Donadieuwas like BertheShe too liveda wonderful animalwith immense reserves_of vitalityLife played her queer tricks but she went on livingInflux of modern Russian literature has accustomed us to see people revolvingremotelyrounda good and the truesomewhere in spaceand the effect is to make the simplicity of Marie Donadieu s character by comparison appear exaggeratedBut the limpidity of treatment is beyond braiseShe was a girlwhose spine made electric by the pressive atmosphere could no longe contain the marrow of her vertebraethe taste of blood was in her mouththe spate of blood which flooded her made her sick to deathShe wandered in the garden on moonlit nights dressed only in a nightgownThen she came to Paris for music lessonsfound a lover and dropped the musicShe knew man and his possessionshe conjectured its resources land hoped for still stranger mysteries among which her whole soul fluttered like a frightened bird There is a situation between the two menone a loverthe other with whom she had lived for four wears beforeShe goes back to the old lover and the men kiss fat partingThis mystical exaggeration which seems to outdo even Dostoievsky is by comparison the one false notebut is I think the result of that almost fictitious visualisation of woman which was the result of much solitude and absence of the amenities of social lifeA previously quoted passage should explain thisThe full flavour of Phillipe is found in the short stories collected inDans la petite villeandContes clu matin These stories are admirable for their economy of materialVery few exceed a thousand wordsDe Maupassant has more stringsTchekov still moreThe theme becomes confusedtoo literal a transcript from ifeWith consummate craft Philippe has carved each from a solid block Charles Blanchardappeared after Philippe s deathIt is the story of a child told in a rather Dickensian manner and in successive versionsPoverty and its accompanying etiolation in an underground kitchen asone the child growing morbidly like toadstool in anotherin the third as a successful maker of clogsHis arms were too longhis neck too thinand two emaciated legs which rose to his breast gave the impression that no room was left for a belly He is apprenticed to the clog maker His eyes were soreThe shop had a huge window and drew its light directly from the skyA brilliant white glowmade one think of the sun itself and struck the child in the eyeballs with such force that one feared lest it should give him sunstrokeHe could feel its burning through to his neck His two lids were thin and transparent what he needed was eyeballs of leadTill then he had lived in the dark room of Solanges houseit was darkness that had met his eyes and in darkness that he had grownand whoever might have remarked organs trough his boneless flesh would without doubt have found them filled with some indescribable matter such as one sees in cavernswhitish soft and mustyHe had sore eyesTwo inflamed eyelids veiled a raw eye looking like some blood stained ballHe had more than sore eyesfor in seemed that the light penetrating through them into the mysterious depths of his flesh had reached the queer vegetations of the gloomDisquieting fermentations puffed him outa rumbling in his bowels was horrible and accompanied by a hollow noise that was impossible to bearand which sometimes made his aunt turn angrily to him and shoutShut upJOHN RODKERIn the October Number MRWinter s note is a very excellent example of an average flabbiness of mind and I was surprised to find no sharp rebuke fromjhat its conclusionbut perhaps Miss Dismorr is now considered fair gameThere is of course very little to be said to a correspondent who says about Miss Dismorr that her work consistsof carefully chosen words and that it is alsoroughly speakingWhitman inverted with a few embroideries Should she by this mean that a hatchet then becomes a lancetthe trope becomes a trifle complicatedSuch insipid generalisations on the part of your correspondent can only mean that the whole point of Miss Dismorr s extremely close and pungent analyses has been missedand that evidently it is not a palate for choice winesAs far as I am concernedMiss Dismorr is one of the most important contributors to the Little Review today and four lines of her work outweigh the effusions of most others of vour staffAs forIslands to which the writer takes exceptionit is an exquisite fragment in a distinguished and responsive proseThe article in question is particularlyverboseand I should have preferred it meticulousI cannot imagine why your correspondent should have rushed into print and made for herselfsuch a complete give awayif not that certain of

contribute poemsMore Translations from the ChineseArthur Waley3 6 George Allan and Unwin MrWaley s new book of translations from the Chinese is if anything better than the lastHis method is very much to the point and for economy of expression entirely admirable The Great Summonsis an amazingly good poem in itselfas are indeed most others though sometimes what was a virtue seems to become a formulaNothing could be however more deightful than the story of Ts ui Ying Ying or that of Miss Liboth written about 800 ADThe last word in sophsitication and human interestand a psychological acuteness only bettered by de Maupassant or the Trois Contes or the Arabian Nights which too they resembleThe discovery of these stories is a work of public benefaction and should be suitably noticedJOHN RODKERDefending Margaret Anderson WITH deft legerdemain MrWinthrop Parkhurst sub divides criticism into forms withouthowevertelling us preciselyor by innuendowhat criticism is There are two forms of criticism MrParkhurst states the metallic and the aromatic This definition leaves us curiously unimpassioned and unchiddenwith the bitter tang of pinchbeck on our lipspossiby becauselike almost all definiton makingits own consistency is metallic and of an inferior sortOf course there is a kind of condensation which is not sowhich is highly poetic and suggestivewhich drops the fragrant quintessence of rose petalsAnd the amusing part of It all is thatboth poets and pedants mayadvertently or inadvertentlyachieve itBoth forms of criticismas outlined by MrParkhursthave the same end in viewwhich may be said to be the eventual distillation of a flashing phrasea precious jar of wine to win either Apollo or Dionysusor bothback to human speechthus enriching it and clarifying thoughtUnfortunately Pantheism has vanished from the brain of manfor then he would not be so poignantly in need of outstanding generalizationsAs it ishe is continually searching for a touchstoneAnd returning to critcismwe find that both forms differ only in the manner in which poetic condensation is to be arrived atThe aromatic criticismI doubt notwill arrive at it intuitivelywell nigh burying the flashing phrasethe cruse of priceless wineunder huge garlands of white crysanthemumisyellow orchids and red rosesIn other wordsthe impressionist criticafter the fashion of Symons and De Gourmontwill arrive at some sublime quintessence that tastessingjs or rings truevia the scented path of beautyOn the other handcritics like TaineBrandes and Faguetestablishing these poetic truths as premiseswill meticuously plod to the next milestone orit may bethe identical onehaving wandered in circlesIt doesn t matterbecause sometimes even the pundits err andunguessedhit upon truthAdvertisement or apprecation is justifiable provided Margaret Anderson is the criticEven should Margaret Anderson refrainfrom writing a word of her magazineit would still reflect or refract her temperamentit would still embody the translations of her subsconscioue personality edited by her conscious personalityAnd if she wishes to write nothing but an unmitigatedblurb as she may well have done in praising the Philadelphia orchestrawe accept it becauseknowing herwe are aware that it is criticism which is leavening within and may yet be translated into adequate speechPIERRE LOVING There is only one decently intelligent thing to be said about criticism It is either a piece of creative writingin which case _ it stands equal to and different from the thing criticizedor it is a piece of illuminating writing like Wyndham Lewis s chapter on Picasso The Caliph s DesignCriticism as defined by MrParkhurst or MrLoving has no meaning at all Sublime quintessence scented path of beauty such phrases as these havenever contained any pointed observation and nowadays they aretoo banalEither you must recognize the new sensibility in the world when you decide to make general remarks about poetrypaintingmusicetc or you must be willing to sound like the old fashioned radical who still talks of libertywithout having yet formulated the faintest notion of what freedoms are possible ofachievement and what ones are forever impossibleMCA Questionings I M afraid ofbeautiful writing I m afraid of trying to be artisticIdeas and their expression is all I dare try for nowYou believe

impressions to the point of adding a commentAsjhsaysthe psychology of the author referred to is that of a mad womanI feel an intensehorridand even beautiful obliviousness to all but the dominating emotionThere exists the callousness of intellectual stupidity and there is what we see herethe callousness of emotional stupiditythat of the savage under the cataleptic influence of religious suggestionIt is only in a condition of disease or mania that one may enjoy an absolutely exalted statethat numbness of the sensibilities toward everything outside the single inspirationThe poet strives to create in himself this disregard of intellectual nuance that he may concentrate everything on the emotionalillumination of his moodbut such accomplishments asThe Castiron Lovershow the valueas well as the limitation pi a sane mind in artTo touch madness is an experience that shocks and stimulatesWe can not perceive its relations and we are beguiled to the conviction of an ultimate valueHowever the sophisticated mind has accretions of what might be called secondary emotions so elusiveeven if intellectualized at their sourcethat they also escape definition and demand expression in artElse von Freytag Loringhoven is to me the naked oriental making solemn gestures of indecency in the sex dance of her religionHer ecstacyto my way of thinkingis one of the properties of artEVELYN SCOTT Asjhdoes not sayEvelyn Scott went on so far and so fast with my remark on the Art of Madness that I do not know where to begin to say that it wouldn t be the art of madness if it were merely an insanity such as Miss Scott describesIn tile case of Else von Freytag Loringhoven I am not talking of mania and diseaseof numbed sensibilitieshers is a willed stateA woman of brainsof mad beauty and elegantes wesenwho has abandoned sanity left it coldShe has recognized that if one has the guts and the constitution to abandon sanity one may at all times enjoy an exalted stateMadness is her chosen state of consciousnessIt is this consciousness which she works to produce ArtThe artist evoking his consciousness at high power on some piece of difficult work appears to have become callous and stupid or a wild man to the laymanElse von Freytag works unhampered by sanityjh Marguerite D Alvarez OWING to lack of space in this number the article of MmeD Alvarez must be held over until

Danube shore lor a good feather bedHis friendship with the smugglers on the Danube worried her even more than his intense interest in kitesHe had a great collection of themThe attic was lined with these oblong shape of all colors and sizes but only one subject for a designThe ever present design consisted of two unrelated subjectsa dragon ana a chain with square linksone end attached tc a saw tooth bayonetThe color of the subjects never variedgreen for the dragon and black for the chain and gunonly the spacing and the positions always variedAll things were interpreted through these two symbols on the surface of his kites and they formed his little world or rather his message to itHe would send them up in the airabove the square whitewashed houses with their tile roofsand felt that they were carrying a message to the whole townThe dragon and the chain represented two incidents he had seen in this town framed in acacia trees high above the DanubeThe dragon came one day on the flags of some visiting Chinamenwho had sailed up the river from the Black Sea with a load of reed covered balesNo one knew their contents as they were immediately reshipped to the capitol cityTh boat looked dressed for a masked ball and the men like animated toys or parading draperiesThey passed through the streets of the town like a dream in the sunshine and when their boat started down the Danube the kitemaker followed in a rowboat for several hoursHe expected the boat to turn into some huge sea animal as soon as it was out of sight of the cityHe thought his own presence had delayed the inevitable transformationThe dragon appeared on every kitea good natured and happy sort of creatureSlowly and with delicate strokes it made itsway on the surface of the paperwriggling and coiling as if embroideredQuite different was the appearance of the black chainIts links became fewer and larger and were put on with large strokesat times almost breaking through the surface of the paperThe chain he had seen fastened to the wrists behind a man s backHe marched barefootwithout a hatwith a hairy chest thrown open to a cool sharp October morningHe marched with stiff legs over sharp stones on the unpaved road leading to the town from the mountainsAll the exposed parts of his body were blue from the cold and covered with dirtOnly his bloodshot eyes shone with a feverish lightHis jawheavily covered with a reddish growthhung as if forgottenCainThe other end of the chain was clamped to a heavy gun with a sawtooth bayonet in the hands of a tall bearded mountaineer with a high lambskin cap on his headNo noise came from the swinging chain or the marching menThey walked in perfect accord and had done so for two days and two nights without a stopAs they swung into sight on the rough roadit was the heavy rusty chain holding the two weird human beings together that struck the boy s imagination with greatest forceThe dirty blue stiff legs in front became a part of the chain as well as the cruel bearded head with the lambskin cap in the rearThey were merely two ends of the chain and it seemed as if the cold blue legs were pulling the two cruel eyes under the fur capA horrible rusty chain marching early in the morning and late at night without restAll the mean deedsfaces and places became a part of the rusty chain solemnly swinging down the road with a tormenting silence The chain had its place on every kite and he made many of themalways larger and stouter to fight off the kites from theneighborhoodBy swinging the string up and down from left to right the kite would move in the desired directionThe quickest decision was reached by tearing all or part of the tail off the enemyThese tails were made of rags torn in narrow strips and it was a fine art to get exact weight and balanceThe last onehis supreme effortwas a Copenhagen blue decorated with the black chain that had come down to five links and a pale green dragon coming from the centerAll the smaller kites he sold to buy twineand the whole street was helping at the launchingLarge wagons full of ripe watermelons made slow progress through the street on that afternoonIt all went well except for the usual intreference of his motherwho needed candles for prayer that eveningSix candlesone fol every child and two for husband and wifeHe had promised toj bring the candles early in the morning but could find no timeAtl frequent intervals his mother s voice came in a threatening manner above all the noise made by the childrenIt irritated him a littlebut now it was unthinkable to postpone the launching and he was angry because his mother did not realize the value of that particular afternoonUp went the kite in majestic swingsand buzzing in a most challenging mannerMore twine and more twine was let loose till the kite was far above its nearest competitora distinct advantage in case of a fightSoon the kite from the nearest street on the east was swinging in this direction and a great fight was looming and children all cheeringBut suddenly a fierce quiet descended on alland the little kite maker s face grew palethen greenHe saw his mother coming with scissors in handlike a tremendous hurricaneand lightening striking from her eyesstraight toward the stout string going to the majestic kite aboveIt seemed too horriblehe still thought it a threat and wanted to avert the Calamity by consenting to go for the candlesbut he could not open his mouthit was frozenAnd the scissors grew larger and larger to enormous proportionsthey reached straight across the streetThere was no escapeHe would rather have stuck his head into the jawswhen the most horrible thing happenedHe fell as if struck by lighteningwith one hand clamped to the remnant of twine on the ballHis mother picked him up like a rag and carried him into the housewhere he clamly sat down in front of an old stove and with hanging headrefused to talk or move all eveningall day Saturdayall night and all day SundayAt the beginninghis parents were inclined to make himbehave but no amount of scolding and threats got the least response from the crouching figureSlowly his sullenness had its effect on the rest of the people in the houseThe usual boisterousness on the part of the other chidren died away and on the second day they began to talk in whispersThey were getting worried and there were little quarrels and incriminations between husband and wife outiside the room where he sat and satIt was Sunday evening and as he was sitting there his mind kept travelling from the ball of twine lying in front of him and a small tube of carmine red paint he had hidden in the attic from the whole worldThese seemed the only important things deserving consideration at that timeThe people in the house he hardly noticedthey were unimportantwhat did they know about a tube of carmine red and its possibilitiesIn factall their chatter and 64 The Little Review movements irritated him only a little and he had forgotten he was hungryThe ball of twineahthat was a different matternot to speak of the tube of carmine redBut he had never used redAnother symbol was required for that colorThe black chain and the green dragon could not wear that most beautiful colorSuddenly an idea struck himHe had not noticed his fathermother and the rest of the family sitting in a semi circewhispering about calling in a doctorHe sprang to his feet as if shocked by an electric current and shoutedfull of joy It will be a red bat with outspread wings on a snow white fieldThat s what the next kite will be Drawing by Maurice SterneTO THE BOOK PUBLISHER OF AMERICA THERE are some thirty publishers of books in New York and BostonEach one of them publishes many books that had better be left unpublishedif the wish to build up a permanent literature is the ideal of their existenceI believe every one of them would admit this delrcate stating of the literary situation in America todayAt the same timeevery one of them publishes perhaps an average of three or four books a year of some special interestThese books I feel should be advertised in the Little ReviewI have just spent ten days presenting this idea to the New York publishersThe results can be seen in this numberThe attitude of those who are represented can be described pretty accuratelyI believeby the statement of one of the most fair minded and intelligent men in the publishing business While I don t always sympathize with the things you print in the Little Review I feel not only that such an effort should be supported by the publishers but that they should recognize your special and selected audience for their special books Of those whose names are conspicuously absent two promised to take pages and then changed their mindsseveral promised to advertise in future numbersseveral felt they had no books that would interest our readerssome refused for purely conventional reasonssome objected so strongly to our policy and to MrJames Joyce that nothing would induce them to appearOne of the largest publishing houses in the countrywith books on their list by writers who appear in the Little Reviewtold me in all friendliness and with a charming humor that they couldn t conscientiously advertise because they regard us as a literary curiosity and preserve back numbers of the Little Review as a record of the insanity of the ageThe implication was that we are not merely representative of the age s insanity butthat we contain it all in our pagesAnother even larger publishing houseand one thatby token of bringing out in book form practically every one of our contributorsstands convicted of admiring usrefused to advertise for the simple reason that they can reach more readersfor the same amount of moneyin other periodicals But you believe that our readers are just the people who buy your books I asked Oh yesbut they read our advertisements in other papers I couldn t see that this was a legitmate reason for not advertising You think the Little Review is a fine thing I asked Oh yesbut we aren t talking of meritSo it seems I said but why aren t we I wondered what we should be talking about that would furnish a decent reason for a large publishing establishment to spend40 on advertising their best books with usSo I tried one more argument We give you thebest publicity in the world by publishing your authors before you bring them out in book formand by stimulating discussion about them before their newest books are on the marketOh yesbut I can t talk with you on the basis of courtesyWellI said why can t youGreat publishing institutions are built up oncourtesy One of the things that amused and angered me the most was the attitude toward James Joyceand other of our contributors who are considered obsceneJoyce is incomphrehensibleyesbut nevertheless violently obsceneAnd nine out of ten of the people I talked with picked two lines of Djuna Barnesplay Three from the Earth to prove to me our disgusting immoralityThe adventuress asks one of the Carson boys Your mother was a prostituteI believe And the boy answers calmlyAt timesI don t understand you I said Surely you have some idea of what those lines meanYes they said they were put there for a laugh and they got itThose lines were put there I said for the same purpose that every line of the play was writtena condensed comment on the hypocricythe unconsciousnessthe lack of thought and vision in peopleEverybody prostitutes something nearly all the timethe prostitute who makes the accusation in this case being about to prostitute herself for social positionEtc etc etcOh noyou re idealizing they said Well I said seing it as I dohow would you have me actYou wouldn t expect me to cut out those lineswould youany more than I would expect you to cut out passages form your most distinguished novelistOh yesbut that s just what we do they exclaimed We take out whatever is objectionableof course where it doesn t too seriously affect the text I should have remembered not to ask a naive questionThe subject matter chosen by the men who write today may be objectionalThe war was objectionablebut it occured to me that I couldn t stop itAnd I haven t yet attempted to control the mind of the timesFor nearly six years we have publishedin Americaa magazine of highly specialized thinkingFinancially unsupportedexcept by donations amounting to a few hundred dollars representing no vested interestsno publishersinterestsno aged magazines and reviews nor staffs of the samewe have managed to keep alive in spite of an unsympathetic and ignorant publica jeering pressand a censor that suspects the worst of any effort dedicated to the bestEven our enemies however give us credit for literary integrityBut this is a meaningless virtueSincerity is not necessarily worth anythingIt all depends on what you re sincere aboutFor instanceI can t look upon the publishers of Edgar Lee Masterslatest books as villians of the commercial ageas Ezra Pound doesany more than I can look upon MrMasters as a victim of the commercial ageHe writes these books because he thinks they are goodthey publish them because they don t suspect how bad they areOne must have a conception of literature before one can practise literary integritySo I ask only one thingsay we are sincere or insincereI don t care how you think we do itI only ask that you develop some conception of what we doAndthat being accomplishedI ask whether you can give your supportat least once a yearto the one magazine in America in which the man of letters may obtain a hearing among his peersungarbled in editorial rooms to suit the public tasteTHE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER AS A MEDIUM FOR POETRY IV by Ernest Fennolosa and Ezra Pound THE sheer loss and weakness of this method is apparent and flagrantEven in its own sphere it can not think half ofwhat to thinkIt has no way of bringing together any two concepts which do not happen to stand one under the other and in the same pyramidIt is impossible to represent change in this system or any kind of growthThis is probably why the conception of evolution came so late in EuropeIt could not make way until it was prepared to destroy the inveterate logic of classificationFar worse than thissuch logic can not deal with any kind of interaction or with any multiplicity of functionAccording to itthe function of my muscles is as isolated from the function of my nervesas from an earthquake in the moonFor it the poor neglected things at the bases of the pyramids are only so many particulars or pawnsScience fought till she got at the thingsAll her work has been done from the base of the pyramidsnot from the apexShe has discovered how functions cohere in thingsShe expresses her results in grouped sentences which embody no nouns or adjectives but verbs of special characterThe true formula for thought isThe cherry tree is all that it doesIts correlated verbs compose itAt bottom these verbs are transitiveSuch verbs may be almost infinite in numberIn diction an in gramdmatical form science is utterly apposed to logicPrimitive men who created language agreed with science and not with logicLogic has abused the language which they left to her mercyPoetry agrees with science and not with logicThe moment we use the copulathe moment we express subjective inclusionspoetry evaporatesThe more concretely and vividly we express the interactions of things the better the poetryWe need in poetry thousands of active wordseach doing its utmost to show forth the motive and vital forcesWe can not exhibit the health of nature by mere summationby the piling of sentencesPoetic thought works by suggestioncrowding maximum meaning into the single phrase pregnantchargedand luminous from withinIn Chinese character each work accumulated this sort of energy Jn itselfShould we pass formally to the study of Chinese poetrywe should warn ourselves against logicianized pitfallsWe should beware of modern narrow utilitarian meanings ascribed to the words in commercial dictionariesWe should try to preserve the metaphoric overtones We should beware of English grammarits hard parts of speechand its lazy satisfaction with nouns and adjectivesWe should seek and at least bear in mind the verbal undertone of each nounWe should avoidisand bring in a wealth of neglected English verbsMost of the existing translations violate all of these rules The development of the normal transitive sentence rests upon the fact that one action in nature promotes anotherthus the agent and the object are secretly verbsFor exampleour sentence Reading promotes writing would be expresed in Chinese by three full verbsSuch a form is the equivalent of three expanded clauses and can be drawn out into adjectivalparticipialinfinitiverelative or conditional membersOne of many possible examples is If one readsit teaches him how to write Another is One who reads becomes one who writes But in the first condensed form a Chinese would write Read promote write The dominance of the verb and its power to obliterate all other parts of speech give us the model of terse fine stlyeI have seldom seen our rhetoricians dwell on the fact that the great strength of our language lies in the splendid array of transitive verbsdrawn both from Anglo Saxon and from Latin sourcesThese give us the most individual characterizations of forceTheir power lies in their recognition of nature as a vast storehouse of forcesWe do not say in English that things seemor apeparor eventuateor even that they arebut that they doWill is the foundation of our speech We catch the Demiurge in the actI had to discover for myself why Shakespeare s English was so immeasurably superior to all othersI found that it was his persistentnaturaland magnificient use of hundreds of transitive verbsRarely will you find anisin his sentences Isweakly lends itself to the uses of our rhythmin the unaccented syllablesyet he sternly dicards itA study of Shakespeare s verbs should underlie all exercises in styleWe find in poetical Chinese a wealth of transitive verbsin some way greater even than in the English of ShakespeareThis springs from These precautions should be broadly conceivedIt is not so much their letteras the underlying feeling of objectificationand activity that mattersj EP Compare Dante s definition ofrectxtudoas the direction ofthe willprobably taken from AquinasEP their power of combining several pictorial elements in a single characterWe have in English no verb for what two thingssay the sun and moonboth do togetherPrefixes and affixes merely direct and qualifyIn Chinese the verb can be more mintuely qualifiedWe find a hundred variants clustering about a single ideaThusto sail a boat forpurposes of pleasurewould be an entirely different verb fromto sail for purposes of commerce Dozens of Chinese verbs express various shades of grievingyet in English translations they are usually reduced to one mediocrityMany of them can be expressed only by periphrasisbut what right has the translator to neglect the overtonesThere are subtle shadingsWe should strain our resources in EnglishIt is true that the pictorial clue of many Chinese ideographs can not now be tracedand even Chinese lexicographers admit that combinations frequently contributee only a phonetic valueBut I find it incredible that any such minute subdivision of the idea could have ever existed alone as abstract sound without the concrete characterIt contradicts the law of evolutionComplex ideas arise only graduallyas the power of holding them together arisesThe paucity of Chinese sound could not so hold themNeither is it conceivable that the whole list was made at onceas commercial codes of cipher are compiledTherefore we must believe that the phonetic theory is in large part unsoundThe metaphor once existed in many caseswhere we can not now trace itMany of our own etymologies have been lostIt is futile to take the ignorance of the Han dynasty for omniscience It is not trueas Legge saidthat the original Professor Fenollosa is well borne out by chance evidenceThe vorticist sculptor Gaudier Brzeska sat in my room a few months agobefore he went off to the warHe was abh to read the Chinese radicals and many compound signs almost at pleasureHe isof courseused to consider all life and nature in the terms of planes and of bounding linesNevertheless he had spent only a fortnight in the museum studying the Chinese charactersHe was amazed at the stupidity of lexicographers who could not discern for all their learning the pictorial values which were to him perfectly obvious and apparentCuriously enougha few weeks later Edmond Dulacwho is of a totally different traditionsat heregiving an impromptu panegyric onthe elements of Chinese arton the units of compositiondrawn from the written charactersHe did not use Professor Fenollosa s own wordshe saidbambooinstead ofrice He said the essence of the bamboo is in a certain way it growsthey have this in their sign for bambooall designs of bamboo proceed from itThen he went on rather to disparage vorticismon the grounds that it could not hope to do for the Occidentin one life timewhat had required centuries of development in ChinaEP picture characters could never have gone far in building up abstract thoughtThis is a vital mistakeWe have seen that our own languages have all sprung from a few hundred vivid phonetic verbs by figurative derivationA fabric more vast could have been built up in Chinese by metaphorical compositionNo attenuated idea exists which it might not have reached more vividly and more permanently than we could have been expected to reach with phonetic rootsSuch a pictorial methodwhether the Chinese exemplified it or notwould be the ideal language of the worldStillis it not enough to show that Chinese poetry gets back near to the processes of nature by means of its vivid figureits wealth of such figureIf we attempt to follow it in English we must use words highly chargedwords whose vital sugestion shall interplay as nature interplaysSentences must be like the mingling of the fringes of feathered bannersor asthe colors of many flowers blended into the single sheen of a meadowThe poet can never see too much or feel too muchHis metaphors are only ways of getting rid of the dead white plaster of the copulaHe resolves its indifference into a thousand tints of verbHis figures flood things with jets of various lightlike the sudden up blaze of fountainsThe prehistoric poets who created language discovered the whole harmonious framework of naturethey sang out her processes in their hymnsAnd this diffused poetry which they created Shakespeare has condensed into a more tangible substanceThus in all poetry a word is like a sunwith its corona and chromospherewords crowd upon wordsand enwrap each other in their luminous envelopes until sentences become clearcontinuous light bandsNow we are in condition to appreciate the full splendor of certain lines of Chinese versePoetry surpasses prose especially in that the poet selects for juxtaposition those words whose overtones blend into a delicate and lucid harmonyAll arts follow the same lawrefined harmony lies in the delicate balance of overtonesIn music the whole possibility and theory of harmony is based on the overtonesIn this sense poetry seems a more difficult artHow shall we determine the metaphorical overtones of neighboring wordsWe can avoid flagrant breaches like mixed metaphorWe can find the concord or harmonizing at its intensestas in Romeo s speech over the dead JulietHere also the Chinese ideography has its advantagein even a simple linefor example The sun rises in the east The overtones vibrate against the eyeThe wealth of composition in characters makes possible a choice of words in which a single dominant overtone colors every plane of meaningThat is perhaps the most conspicuous quality of Chinese poetryLet us examine our lineThe sunSun risesin theEast the shiningon one sideon the other the sign of the eastwhich is the sun entangled in the branches of a treeAnd in the middle signthe verb rise we have further homologythe sun is above the horizonbut beyond that the single upright lineis like the growing trunk line of the tree signThis is but a beginningbut it peints a way

piquant sensitiveness of mudin spotsand a lordly grewsomeness in other passagesbut on the whole its last sentence expresses my reactionThat s the way you bore him Its dialogue is too assiduously elaborate and does not contain that effortless compactness that expression of a chapter in the crook of a finger which alone could convey the grisly note striven forThe prostitute is half fantastic and half Minetta Laneand the two look suspiciously at each otherThe three peasant lads might be more convincing if one had not read the author s1 description at the start of the playwhere she gives
