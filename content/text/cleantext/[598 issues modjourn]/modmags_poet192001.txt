In pattern molds be run But there s you and me and Bindlestiff And remember Mary s Son  At dawn the hedges and the wheel ruts ran Into a brightening sky The grass bent low With shimmering dew and many a late wild rose Unrolled the petals from its odorous heart While birds held tuneful gossip Suddenly Each bubbling trill and whistle hid away As from a hawk the fragrant silence heard Only the loving stir of little leaves Then a man s baritone broke roughly in  175  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I ve gnawed my crust of mouldy bread Skimmed my mulligan stew Laid beneath the barren hedge Sleety night winds blew  Slanting rain chills my bones Sun bakes my skin Rocky road for my limping feet Door where I can t go in  Above the hedgerow floated filmy smoke From the hidden singer s fire Once more the voice  I used to burn the mules with the whip When I worked on the grading gang But the boss was a crook and he docked my pay Some day that boss will hang  I used to live in a six by nine Try to save my dough It s a bellyful of the chaff of life Feet that up and go  The mesh of leafy branches rustled loud Into the road slid Bindlestiff You ve seen The like of the traveller gaunt humanity In stained and broken coat with untrimmed hedge Of rusty beard and curling sunburnt hair His hat once white a dull uncertain cone  176  Edwin Ford Piper  His leathery hands and cheeks his bright blue eyes That always see new faces and strange dogs His mouth that laughs at life and at himself  Sometimes they shut you up in jail Dark and a filthy cell I hope the fellows built them jails Find em down in hell  But up above you can sleep outdoors Feed you like a king You never have to saw no wood Only job is sing  The tones came mellower as unevenly The tramp limped off trailing the hobo song  Good bye farewell to Omaha  K C and Denver too  Put my foot on the flying freight Going to ride her through  Bindlestiff topped a hillock against the sky  Showed stick and bundle with his extra shoes  Jauntily dangling Bird to bird once more  Made low sweet answer in the wild rose cups  The bee found yellow meal all softly moved  The white and purple morning glory bells  As on the gently rustling hedgetop leaves  The sun s face rested Bindlestiff was gone  177  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Oh the lives of men lives of men In pattern molds be run But there s you and me and Bindlestiff And remember Mary s Son  WHOA ZEBE WHOA  Saddle me up the Zebra Dun Whoa Zebe whoa Double cinch the son of a gun  Whoa till I bridle you whoa Foot in the stirrup straddle him quick Pitch and squeal and buck and kick Take your gait or the spurs will prick  Lope along you Zebra Dun  The boys are off for town tonight It s a riding Zebra Dun Playing poker and a getting tight  Sift along O Zebra Dun Bunch of girls at Brown s Hotel Knows the steps and dances well Rattlesnake Pete and his fiddle  Lope along O Zebra Dun  Lights of the town are a shining clear Run you Zebra Dun Last four weeks seems like a year Run Zebe run  178  Edwin Ford Piper  Yip yip yi yi yi yil Run you old stiff kneed grasshopper You spiral spined jackrabbit you A ho whoopee  Brown s Hotel we re bound to see Swing them girls at the dance party One and twenty on a moonlight spree  A ho whoopee  Whoa Zebe whoa Whoa till I hitch you whoa  SWEETGRASS RANGE  Come sell your pony cowboy Sell your pony to me Braided bridle and your puncher saddle And spend your money free  If I should sell my pony And ride the range no more Nail up my hat and my silver spurs Above my shanty door  And let my door stand open wide To the snow and the rain and sun And bury me under the green Sweetgrass Where you hear the river run  As I came down the Sweetgrass range And by the cabin door  179  POETR Y A Magazine of Verse I heard a singing in the early dusk Along the river shore I heard a singing to the early stars And the tune of a pony s feet The joy of the riding singer I never shall forget Edwin Ford Piper SNOW The grey sky bent above us It seemed so little The earth Like a very distant village trio Of almost forgotten years The trees sang Then As a lone white rose That stays its complete departure And leaf by leaf goes straying Came as from a greater beauty Hidden in the grey bending sky Snow Leone Kelley 180  HIGH PLACES  THE EAGLE S SONG  Said the Eagle  When my time came I was astonished To find that there was death I felt cold sinking within me  Alas my home Shall I leave it All beholding mountains From your snowy stations Shall I see my house no more  North I went Leaning on the wind Through the forest resounded The cry of the wounded doe  East I went Seeking Where the white hot dawn Treads on the trail of morning blueness The wind brought me The smell of death in my nostrils  South I went Looking  181  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  For the place where there is no death I heard singing The sound of wailing for the dead  West I went On the world encompassing water Death s trail was before me  People O people It must be that we shall leave this pleasant earth Therefore let us make songs together Let us make a twine of songs With them we shall bind the Spirit Fast to the middle heaven There at least it shall roam no more The white way of souls There shall be our home  THE GRASS ON THE MOUNTAIN  Oh a long time The snow has possessed the mountains  The deer have come down and the big horn They have followed the sun to the south To feed on the mesquite pods and the bunch grass Loud are the thunder drums In the tents of the mountains  Oh a long time now  182  Mary Austin  Have we eaten chia seeds And dried deer s flesh of the summer killing We are wearied of our huts And the smoky smell of our garments  We are sick with desire of the sun And the grass on the mountain  BLACK PRAYERS  There is a woman Has taken my man from me  How was 1 to know When I gave him my soul to drink In the moon of Corn planting When the leaves of the oak Are furred like a mouse s ear When the moon curled like a prayer plume In the green streak over Tuyonyi  When I poured my soul to his In the midst of my body s trembling How was I to know That the soul of a woman was no more to him Than sweet sap dripping From a bough wind broken  If I had known I could have kept my soul from him  183  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Even though I kept not my body  That woman with her side looking eyes Whatever she takes from him It is my soul she is taking Waking sharply at night I can feel my life pulled from me Like water in an unbaked olla Then I know he is with her She is drinking from his lips The soul I gave him  Therefore I make black prayers for her With this raven s feather With owl feathers edged with silence That all her days may be night haunted Let blackness come upon her The downward road Toward Sippapu Let her walk in the shadow of silence  Would I had kept my soul Though I gave my body Better the sly laugh and the pointed finger Than this perpetual gnawing of my soul By a light woman  Now I know why these women are so fair They are fed on the hearts of better women Who would not take another s man  184  Mary Austin  Knowing there is no untying The knot of free given affection  Let darkness come upon her Let her feet stumble Into the Black Lake of Tears Let her soul drown Let those above not hear her By the black raven s plume By the owl s feather  NEW MEXICAN LOVE SONG  The long last lights on the mesas fail  And the twittering quail and the coo doves cease  The young wind walks in the tasseling corn Ohé But there s never the fall of your foot in the trail  And the twilight hour is long Beloved Ohé And the twilight hour is long  The moon comes over the canon wall  The tombés wake  And the slim flutes call  And the dew drips down from the tasseling corn Ohé  But there s never the sound of your voice at all  185  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And the twilight hour is long Beloved Ohé  And the twilight hour is long  I DO NOT KNOW  I do not know if there is God The centre of this whirling orb Making and unmaking  I do not know if there is God But there s a spirit in the wood  That was it where once the lupin shook And there it laughed Between two gurgles of the brook Warm silence and the windless stir Along my sides where once was fur And nameless fierce temptations in my blood  Or when the dawn is like a trumpet laid To the sea s lips that are curved keen for it When the wet beach is gleaming like a shell And all the foreshore whispers in green fire I have felt that spirit pass Stalking the young winds in the grass  I do not know if there is God  186  Mary Austin  But when my travail came And every sense went weltering blind Round jagged rocks of pain There is a Swimmer in the surf Rode with us down the staggering gulf And brought us safe to land  The hurrying hearse whisked out of sight The sexton cleaned his spade on the grass My grief was stiff like the slithering clay And the mourners put up their veils  There was a Spirit blew The graveyard dust in my face Earth unto earth was said of you For something of you has gone into the ground With the child that you made at your body s cost And a sea blue lilac can not toss Nor the white corn tassel row on row But something of you has entered there The brown corn silk is the brown of her hair And the pink of her mouth you will find again Delicately folded lip on lip In the budding tips of the apricot boughs For nothing can ever divide you now From the earth you have made with your dead That was a thing Only a Spirit could have said  Mary Austin  187  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE CARRYING OF THE GHOST  A Mes qua kie Ceremony  The Friends and the Mourners chant responsively  Let the ghost of the brave be carried away  Let the ghost of the brave be carried away Mourners look up Fasters look up  You who have shed your blood look up You whose tears were not enough to shed Look up look up  We cannot look up  We cannot look up  A moon ago he died A moon ago died the dutiful son A moon ago died the faithful husband A moon ago died the brave the friend  His ghost is cold  His ghost is naked  Let the ghost of the brave be carried away Mourners look up Fasters look up  We cannot look up  We cannot look up  Mourners fasters  188  Nelson Antrim Crawford  Where is his ghost In the Happy Hunting Ground Pursues he the game Fights he in company with ancient

 Befriend his ghost  He is son we cannot send him He is brother we cannot send him He is husband we cannot send him He is friend we cannot send him  We cannot send him We cannot let him go If we send

see him He hears their voices Praise him by the ghost fire But they cannot hear him When he replies  Thin is his voice  They cannot hear it Send him to the Happy Hunting Ground Where dwell his ancestors Send him to the Happy Hunting Ground Where dwell Hot Hand and Cold Hand  Long is the ghost road No one returns by it Long is the ghost road He comes back no more  Long is the ghost road no one returns by it Long is the ghost road but all go over it Long is the ghost road you will go over it You will go over it if you will send him  Long is the ghost road No one returns by it  191  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Long is the ghost road  He comes back no more  He wanders in the cold beyond the ghost fire He picks up crumbs like a wolf in the cold He has no horse he can hunt no game  Long is the ghost road But all go over it Long is the ghost road You will go over it You will go over it If you will send him  Yes we will send him For we shall follow him Yes we will send him For we shall not lose him Yes we will send him We shall all follow after him We shall all follow after him Wise good loving Yes we will send him Make ready the horse The new clothes the feast  They will send

the ghost carriers Call the ghost carriers  Bring no more wood to the smoky ghost fire The ghost goes on the long ghost road Bring no more food to the smoky ghost fire The ghost goes on the long ghost road Let the men who sit by the smoky ghost fire No more praise him that he may hear Let the men who sit by the smoky ghost fire Rise up now and help to make ready  Rise up and make ready Make ready Make ready Rise up and make ready  The ghost goes on the long ghost road  Nelson Antrim Crawford  193  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE PAINTED DESERT  Delicate land  Fabulous land  Clear as a bird song afloat in the morning  Keener than glacial air  Exquisite gift of the slow building sea  Held like an altar up to the sky  Circled with light cliff columns high  Rising aerially  Dare men approach your enchantments of sand  Land where the rainbow lies bare  Enter your sun guarded gateways of space  Mortals like snails with a cheapening trail  Fearful of mystery wearily pale  Out of today s commonplace  Over the wasteland a strong wind goes  Like captured heat lies the cactus rose  The desert sings  Sand precious flowers and quick lizards lie  In a world like the brazen bowl of the sky  Sun captured things  Color and distance come weaving their dances  Mystery full the great silence advances  Then at your hand Marvelling mortals unfold strange wings Delicate fabulous land  194  Emma Hawkridge  HOPI SUN CHRISTENING  Child High aloft you are held to the dawn Naked To feel the sun s first rays The welcoming god will come Leaping Out of the under world To greet you to bathe to engulf you Child Straining the brown arms of your grandmother  Silent upon the mesa top Above a desert of silence We your people wait To strip you earth strange to the sun god Child who have lain in the darkness Child who shall live in the sun Do you see The lifting of the dusk The white line of the dawn The yellow coming of light Wailing child Behold He has touched you the Sun  Emma Hawkridge  195  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  INDIAN SKY  The old squaw  Is one  With the old stone behind her  Both have squatted there  Ask mesa  Or mountain how long  The bowl she holds  Clay shawl of her art  Clay ritual of her faith Is one  With the thought of the past  And one with the now  Though dim a little old strange  The earth holds her  As she holds the bowl  Ask kiva  Or shrine how much longer  No titan  No destroyer  No future thought  Can part  Earth and this woman  Woman and bowl  The same shawl  Wraps them around  Alfred Kreymborg   196  IN HOPI LAND AND OTHER LANDS  GHOSTS  Ghosts of the early earth The sly coyote knows you And the timid deer I asked the eagle circling skyward And saw your twin shadows The fox looks everywhere And calls you brother  Was it your whisper Your mocking whisper Among the twisted cedars  Or only the tired winds Cuddling on the cool breasts of evening  BURDENS  Burden of water jars Borne up steep trails Burden of babies Asleep in thonged cradles  And a heaped up load of loving Carried lightly Over all the trails To the end of them  197  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HOPI MAIDEN  At the mealing stones Is one singing butterfly songs  Fly yellow wings with my love That has wings like your own  Go in the golden shining of the sun Where the cornfields are  Yellow wings you are my loving Home from the flight  Somebody is hoeing the corn Heard you not his love for me  HOMESICK SONG  To the staccato of the booming drum To the dance step of moccasined feet And swaying of brown bodies They sang  Said the very old man at the drum It is a homesick song Of lonesome deserts  Of grinding the corn Of a roof overhead The love of woman  198  William H Simpson  And of the Path to the Sunset Where we go tomorrow  Ah then I knew Knew why it sang to my heart  HOPI TUH  O people of the peaceful places I have known you of old Yet your wise men say nothing Nor the tinted sands The shifting singing sands  These alone are the Knowing Ones The shadows of yonder clouds And the far journeying winds Winds that cover yesterday s pathway  They are the gray wings of your rains They are the messengers of your praying  DANCE OF THE DUST WITCHES  Are you not weary  O desert dust witches  I cannot see who waltzes with you  In close embrace  But your lips meet hotly in kisses  199  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Your hair is disheveled  Your ribbons are flying  Your skirts are in tatters  The music you dance to It comes from fiddles bewitched  GRAND CANYON  Words such as dreamers utter Songs played on dulcet strings Pictures that hold beauty deathles  Here on the verge  They fade away to dull colors Faint songs Echoes of words  Let the sunsets paint it  And the rainbows Let the pueblos whisper of it  Voices of long ago Let the red river sing of it  A wild thing caged escaping  THE NEW DAY  The swift scouts of dawn ride in Their lances flame tipped The waning moon shines whitely  200  William H Simpson  Like thin drifted snow And the cradled winds sleepily rub their eyes  An impatient horse whinnies A dog barks at nothing Trails of smoke rise from the kitchen chimney The air is washed clean it smells sweet With odors of new mown hay  A man steps out briskly From the imprisoned dark of the barn Carrying pails brimful of foaming milk A woman waits in the doorway She is young and comely Mewing kittens are tangled in her skirts They smell the warm milk A baby cries softly upstairs  THE NORTH WOODS  Do you remember those rare intimacies Of August twilights around a pine knot flame And the luring intricacies Of paths leading to shaded nooks of no name  Have you memory also Of trout at the end of a taut line Poised for the instant Like a swift sword gleam Over a flashing dashing rollicking stream  201  William H Simpson  Have you forgotten You who were love s home As the nest forgets When the wee birds roam  NOVEMBER  A thinning of lingering leaves on the boughs A sudden chill on the sunny side of the house And honk of wild geese overhead  Summer has fled  Her departure does not sadden me  Beyond all recompense and utterly  For you are here  My dear my dear  PITY NOT  Pity not the dead  They are comforted  Should they wake not  All is forgot  If they rise again  Love folds them then  William H Simpson  203  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE FOG GHOST  I hear wailing  Great ships are sailing  Into your arms and nevermore  They port on any shore  Ghost of the mist  Keep your ancient tryst  Back to the lone lanes of the sea  Slip silently  SHADOW FACES  An old and almost forgotten album Housing faded pictures  Turning again its pages  And looking at those shadow faces  Suddenly I know  As if a low voice had spoken  That youth has departed  Broken hearted  DESERTED  The door is open But knocks no one Paths there are  Yet no feet run  202  POETRY A Magazine of Verse COMMENT  SCIENCE AND ART AGAIN I  is easy enough to answer Dr Steinmetz He quite Tignores the fact that the interest in the Iliad and the Odessey is not in the mode of locomotion but in the story of human passion and conflict Otherwise one might replace Homer by a tour through some world s fair Transportation Hall  It is merely incidental whether one skim the world s surface by horse dog sled trireme leviathan automobile or aeroplane the motive for going is what counts Nor is the ability to skim the world s surface in relatively short or long time of any great moment since any method is both incredibly short and impossibly long as regards eternity  Art is the record of the activity of the human spirit in its essence it is spiritual activity itself There is perhaps more art in the life history of a man like Steinmetz if one could know it than in his inventions once completed This it seems to me should be the inspiration of the novelist whose imagination is stirred by the spectacle of modern science Unless the invention provoke an aesthetic reaction which is very rare and which is not the motive of the invention it can not be said to have an aesthetic function and therefore lacks stimulating quality for the artist Again it is the creative human spirit beneath the invention that counts  Dr Steinmetz article illustrates precisely why there is today such a wide divorce between our life our practical  204  Science and Art Again  national life and art There is never any divorce between life and art because art is life Artists are far more willing to grant concessions to science than are the scientists and statesmen to recognize the inherent concrete power of art The tribal value so to speak of a work of art is never perceived in its own generation except by a few Yet fifty years later that work of art or the composite art of the period has molded the minds of a people in a fashion that is spiritually concrete The tribal value of a machine is accepted at once for its material benefits yet the benefits of art are equally concrete material and it is well to remember this in times of peace W e must not forget the storm of protest aroused in the early days of the war by Germany s contention of the superiority of her Kultur we summoned our own respective cultures to the light and Robert Bridges brought out his anthology of selections from the poets to prove that we are not deficient in that culture which is founded upon The Spirit of Man as he  called his book  It is characteristic that Dr Steinmetz opposes against the creative works of science and of course science is creative though not in an artistic sense only apparently second rate novels of erotic or decadent tendencies One would like to know what modern poets Dr Steinmetz reads if he reads any and what he looks for in their work The burden of proof it seems to me rests with Dr Steinmetz  Of course our age is not unromantic Only a very stupid person would make such a statement but here again one  205  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  must ask what it is that makes romance Is it the automobile turbine engine flying ship or cinematograph Or are these merely adjuncts to that which is romance Is not romance also of the spirit  Dr Steinmetz clearly does not perceive the distinction between science and art the aim and object of each and in this respect he is more out of touch with the Twentieth Century with his time and with all time than is the average literary artist whom he accuses of this fault  That the poet may not chant paeans to the achievements of modern science is no indication that he is out of touch with his time Some indeed do chant such paeans and yet fail to achieve either poetry or romance or any aesthetic reaction in their hearers Does not one turn with relief from Mrs Tietjens poem on A Steam Shovel to her Most Sacred Mountain or from Harriet Monroe s poem on The Turbine to her two beautifully intimate sonnets on Pain  Let Dr Steinmetz write his own autobiography as Henry Adams wrote his and we shall come closer to the springs of creative science to the spiritual activity underlying it than if a whole host of poets and novelists treated of its external aspects  Is the glint of light on an aeroplane more beautiful than that on a bird s wing Does a steam radiator move one more aesthetically than a wood fire  The phonograph is an accomplishment but the aesthetic fact is the voice not the machine the typewriter has nothing to do with the creative impulse of the mind that uses it  206  Science and Art Again  Our age is romantic as romantic as any other age perhaps no more so for it is romantic not on account of the inventions that fill it but on account of the lives that are lived in it to whom the inventions are an adjunct but not a controlling power Here as always it is the spirit and not the machine that counts Land feudalism may be supplanted or augmented by factory feudalism the struggle is the same  The problem for the artist is far beyond that conceived by Dr Steinmetz It is to perceive and portray the sources of life as these are seen through and beyond the outward trapping What can one do with the tube or the elevated except ride in it And however much one may marvel at the advance of science however much one may deprecate second rate erotic novels it is nevertheless true that no invention has yet been made which changes the course of human passion the portrayal of which in the hands of a novelist such as for instance Mr D H Lawrence ranks side by side with the achievements of modern science even though one may sometimes fancy that instead of chaining sun power to a turbine Mr Lawrence has set himself a task which is a good deal like painting the sun One may note the difference between Mr Lawrence s method and that of Homer Mr Lawrence gives us a close up in place of a panoramic view one may find the panorama in Tolstoi or Dostoievsky but one can not admit that Mr Lawrence is any less in touch with his time than was Homer even though steam engines play an unimportant part in his novels  207  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And incidentally one may remind Dr Steinmetz that Homer could have left the Trojan horse out of the Iliad but not Helen  Certain phases of modern science and invention may provoke an aesthetic reaction in the artist in which case if the expression is adequate the material becomes transmuted into art and nothing in the world in this sense is outside the scope of art But to insist upon the glorification of modern science as a set program for the artist is to mistake very seriously the function of art and of the artist  Of course one could to refute Dr Steinmetz enumerate a host of modern writers whose work is in a deeply spiritual sense in touch with their time indeed is not this true on the whole of modern poetry but it would take too long and the burden of proof as I said before rests not with the artists but with Dr Steinmetz A C H  II  Much of A C H s argument is incontestable but H M would like to project one inquiry a little further than either Dr Steinmetz in his challenge or she in her reply has gone The inquiry is essentially this Is not the truth one and indivisible whether of science art philosophy or anything else Do we not analyze too narrowly in differentiating the creation of the artist from that of the scientist calling the one a contribution to aesthetics and the other to material invention In short does not all power spring from the Spirit call it of man or of God  208  Science and Art Again  The poet is almost invariably unmathematical unscientific On that side his mind is a blank and he easily assumes that the forces thus let loose in the world are not spiritual but material The poet let me use this word generically as representing all artists especially all literary artists the poet virtually monopolizes men s ears what he says goes because the scientist can merely build his truth he cannot utter it And may it not be true that by his blindness to the soul of the machine to the spiritual power inherent in its creation the modern poet establishes a dissonance between the energy of our age and its art  Just here may be the source of the vague discomfort felt by the average imaginative mind please note that I say the average imaginative mind and there are a few imaginative minds in every vocation from the cobbler to the statesman in its effort to get into sympathetic relation with modern literature and art And it may be the reason why modern life and modern art are not one undivided unity one complete well rounded circle as they were in the world s great ages such periods of transcendent human expressiveness as those of Pericles of the Gothic cathedrals of the Sung emperors of Queen Elizabeth This vague discomfort is perhaps a just arraignment and it may be up to the poet rather than the scientist to get in tune with his age  Once in tune with it once in sympathetic union with the forces now at work in the world it is quite possible that the poet and after him the people will find the confusion of our age resolving into harmony that he will begin that  209  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  rounding of the circle which may make the next age as divinely complete and expressive as those others This will not be through writing eloquent praise of the super locomotive or the giant aeroplane but through feeling to the very depths and expressing to the very heights the spiritual adventures of the human soul in its use of and conquest over whatever powers and agencies the searchers and discoverers of the time have revealed He will round the circle of beauty in his own way but it must be the way of knowledge and sympathy it cannot be the way of ignorance and scorn  Even so enlightened an observer as Waldo Frank misses this point in Our America which is nevertheless the most luminous book of fundamental criticism yet written about our present day American world If Mr Frank could have seen that the pioneer and the pioneer and the scientific inventor are essentially one type if he could have realized that his pioneer was pursuing a dream rather than mere material riches he would not have had to call Lincoln a miracle a miracle of spiritual power arising out of a crassly material environment Lincoln was a son of the pioneers not only physically and intellectually but above all spiritually In him the brooding melancholy of their endless quest the power that paused for neither hope nor despair that accepted no fulfilment but pressed on ever to the next goal in him these heroic imaginings flowered into symmetrical beauty and grandeur And the men of Lincoln s breed today are men like Dr Steinmetz pushing on from  210  Science and Art Again  knowledge to knowledge through the encompassing darkness of our fate  The fact that their discoveries are misused by meaner men for material gain has nothing whatever to do with the case It is no more true today than in Homer s time or Elizabeth s there are always grafters to suck the blood of heroes But the poet should see beyond the grafter to the hero if he confuses the two or neglects both he is no true interpreter of his age or prophet of the next  It was under the spur of such feeling as this that I wrote The Turbine twelve years ago Its sources were authentic a talk with a twelve year old boy whose dream of the beauty of the higher mathematics pushed far out into space and time and a story told by an electrical engineer of the misbehavior of one of his beloved turbines in a great power station No doubt my poem falls far short of that boy s fervor and of that man s humor and love his sense of mysterious and temperamental life in this mighty product of human hands and brains But only a poet who knows and loves machines or a machinist who knows and loves poetry is competent to say so H M  REVIEWS  IRRITATION  Pavannes and Divisions by Ezra Pound Alfred A Knopf There is a word which one associates with Dostoievsky s works Sorrow as we think of Walt Whitman the word  211  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  may be Joy for Mr Pound the word is Irritation Irritation inspires him and he inspires irritation in his readers  Here are twelve dialogues of Fontenelle translated One may say of them that they are just such things as only a man like Mr Pound could have scooped out of the welter of minor French literature since if there is a literature in the world to which Mr Pound is extraneous and foreign in feelings and ways it is the French These dialogues conform surprisingly and sympathize remarkably with Mr Pound these quarrelsome persons in these dialogues these not remarkable persons of these not extraordinary dialogues  Here is a poem called L Homme Moyen Sensuel parading in a Browning exo skeleton with much less than Browning under the skeleton Here is also a translation from Laforgue by which Mr Pound has achieved a thing worthy of observation he has been true to the letter almost of the original and at the same time has betrayed and desecrated it Laforgue s satires are veiled by a delicate and almost haughty modesty and they have a sorrowfully humble way which become boisterousness in the translation reminding one of what Billy Sunday did to Christ  The book taken as a whole is Mr Pound s profession of faith in art A faith in art which consists of a few donts shouted at some imaginary and improbable followers of repetitions of phrases by old and ancient masters duly stripped of their original glamour as all repetitions are  One finds here a formula almost directly translated from a famous passage of Rimbaud s Les Illuminations It is the  212  Irritation  presentation of such a complex instantaneously which gives that sense of sudden liberation A faith in art that becomes militant in a fierce little contempt against America look he s throwing pebbles at our skyscrapers O People and a provincial and bourgeois quarrel against the provincial and bourgeois in art A faith in art that has no love no ecstasy not even drunkenness  It sums itself up mechanically into this Mr Pound lets it be known that he is against stupidity bad art and bad artists Ask any bad artist he will tell you that it is he who is against bad artists and bad art Now the only way to judge whether it is the case of a bad artist disagreeing with himself and objecting to art or the contrary is from the style of the objector from his way of moving about As for his tastes in art in our century one can no longer judge a man from them faking about them is the most popular of the arts What then are the stride and the physiognomy of Mr Pound Well he may have written some exceeding good poems I will not say whether I doubt it or not But this book is a sequence of false steps made by its author in his effort to gain a recognition that he misses and longs for And a sulking aggressive self conscious man scowls at you from behind every sentence Here are some of the false steps He tells us that he takes no pleasure in writing this  He drops altogether too magnificently such a portentous formidable new phrase as Art is a science like chemistry and as no elucidation or comment follows but some flat and hollow English instead one has a feeling  213  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of suspicion as though one had caught a glimpse of a bum with a gold watch chain strung across his ragged vest He reiterates that obviously this is so obviously that is so  resorts to such stimulants of laughter as three exclamation marks Boosting James Joyce he cannot find a more enthusiastic or enlightening phrase than He gives us Dublin as it presumably is or He gives the thing as it is Giving the thing as it is he calls realism and his criticism proceeds with a quibbling on such words as imagism impressionism realism symbolism words which if they ever mean anything mean one thing only otherwise they mean what you understand by them and if you do not tell us precisely what they mean nothing  I might praise the book and say that there is in it a sort of dignified love for art and art concepts But how can I this love is so cold and so awkward that it inspires no sympathy It is probably an affair between Mr Pound and some Grecian wraiths and we are unable to say just how immoral or lively it is And is it love No sincere lovemaking no liberating gesture can be awkward whereas as Mr Aiken says awkwardness incarnate is in this book Perhaps Mr Pound s liberation occurred some time ago in his poems If it be so then this is a post mortem restlessness it is a case of pain animating the dust of dead desire Yes that is indeed why we do not stand in awe at the sight of the considerable fight Mr Pound has put up that is why we call it a quarrel a quarrel that is so much and so exclusively nobody s quarrel that there s no chance  214  Irritation  to sympathize His problems are unrealities that he has created out of his weariness and spleen to throw sand in the eyes of the ghost of insignificance and pettiness that haunts him His anger against the big plagues of the world is so petty that I think he makes petty difficulties out of big ones in order to give himself the sport to fight them If he saw how enormous the difficulties are that he is making grimaces at he would become human and there would be a little more sentiment in him but I suppose he would feel ashamed of it  It s an ugly love Rather the crudity and the bombast of an earnest beginner rather all the pathetic attitudes of self glorification and self abnegation with which incomplete artists daily pester the world than this sophisticated love towards Her for She is a tough handed and strong smelling Woman Rather the uncouth gaffes of an adolescent than this philandering with fawns and nymphs and mouldy reminiscences of Pan a nasty way of snubbing this great Woman who slings in passing streetfuls of dust of today s cities whose favorite perfume is that of the loam the loam that soils the hands of dudes and snobs Rather morbid and talkative love than this ungainly nouveau riche abstinence from raptures for fear of clumsiness rather coarseness that is tender hearted and foolishly weeps and foolishly laughs than this delicacy and aloofness achieved or rather striven for without drama  Yes Mr Pound talks of the experts of such men as may die of a harsh sound inadvertently caught by their ears We  215  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  know them ces délicats It s Oscar Wilde who wrings new postures and new words out of poor Salome she was an adolescent and she had a human tendency to be obvious who writes of men flinging themselves languorously on sofas and refuses to sit down in Whitman s room for fear of soiling his clothes It is Remy de Gourmont with his perfectly charming receptiveness who cowers at the sight of such a forsaken accursed and violent genius as Rimbaud and gossips about the tragedy of the splendid Youth It s Gustave Kahn who quibbles as to whether Laforgue is a symbolist or not while Laforgue s aloofness and sorrow and death are one of those mistakes or crimes of the world for which the world never gives an account or an apology It s Ezra Pound who on the death of Verhaeren makes haste to tell us that Verhaeren wasn t as good as I forget the name What these délicats miss what these choosers these select selecters and elite makers and aristocrats miss is what I call roots They miss what they intensely long for a place in the world and the sense of their importance in it What they hate most is clumsiness lack of taste they tell us to anyone who knows the weight and the majestic stride of this our Earth to anyone who knows how deep and weirdly gnarled men s roots are common men s roots how torment edly tangled and twisted they are this lightness and this amenity and this aristocratic giggling are grotesque and funny and sorrowfully clumsy There was exquisiteness in an Italian mother I saw in Taylor Street biting in a sweet  frenzy the mouth of her sloppy child and she was fat and  216  Irritation  greasy too It is the strong nosed and big hearted love which is most delicate Delicacy is a luxury of the strong nosed it is not the privilege of a carefully self preserving scantiness of heart Ces délicats and immaculate perceivers can never reach that perfect isolation toward which they started when it became impossible for them to be in the world yes it was their inability to be a struggling part of the world that dropped them out of it Evidently the concept of isolation is a theoretical fallacy isolation that exhibits itself indifference that meddles with everything and nags and objects  Ezra Pound s exclusion of his own personal emotion from this book affects to be a feat of dignity austere lack of sentimentality It is self contradictory and inasmuch as Mr Pound cannot refrain from shouting and showing signs of emotion he is most absurdly sentimental This book is the throttled cry of non confessed inhibitions The sentimentality of so many propagandists and radicals who start out of a day to settle the troubles of the world troubles for which they assert they are fundamentally not responsible this sentimentality is Ezra Pound s It is the most depraving sort of sentimentality The idea of self surpassing of the Superman in Nietzsche and that most frequent and most permanent of colors in art Sadness these are furthest from sentimentality and the best example to set before such noisy self contradictions as Ezra Pound and the whole bevy of modern purists professors learned men and experts  Mr Pound is a gentleman who possessing a good deal  217  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of human discrimination saw what were the things that a great man is concerned about Thereupon he laboriously set himself to be concerned in such things Indeed his art theories have all the requisites there is the proclamation of art as morals there is the damning of our present day ugliness and the longing for the times of Chivalry and the beauty that was Greece there is an act of faith called Religio It is extraordinary and very deplorable that the same man who speaks of Christ as the unpleasing Semite who began to use myths for social propaganda who compares disparagingly Blake with Whistler does not in the least realize that these same men have benignantly given him that which he surreptitiously tried to steal from them and without acknowledgment stalks about calling his own He does not realize that his art theories are ages old that the only newness that can be brought into such topics may only be the weight of a personally suffered tragedy or a golden gift of song torn out of a man s own heart his heart of today of today s sorrow and today s laughter In other words that only a very personal emotion validates and differentiates a man s art theories Then when one brings such a gift or casts the shadow of such a tragedy it matters little that similar things have been said by someone else before then indeed one may rejoice that they have been said by someone else then one no longer strives for originality but for a communion with the great for the frenzy of the extreme loneliness of being together with the great And such loneliness is perhaps what is meant by originality  218  Irritation  Dignity aloofness cool judgment the dickens Only eyes of fire may look at the sun I am thinking that such things as he eventually utters coldly and precisely are the same that were screamed without precision and with blind illogical heat by Blake by Shelley by Nietzsche by Rimbaud and even by the kind and moderate Sir Philip Sydney who speaks of scientists who draw a straight line with a crooked heart And I say that it is no longer in such cases a matter of words or language but a flame and an uproar which must unfortunately take the form of questionable and confutable words Ezra Pound is the soot and the ashes of the fire of what he calls derisively the prophetic Blake  And as for free verse Upholding or apologizing for free verse is ridiculous and obsolete There is a song or a scream coming to free verse today since an image of a Great Hunt became song song of today song in the ears and song in the throat of a man whom one may see living and looking sad if one goes to the office of the Chicago Daily News and asks for the journalist Carl Sandburg The bookish discernment of men who left America to seek for intelligent conversation ought to limit itself to things less alive than free verse is today  I would praise the book and be pleased at Mr Pound s sincere love for James Joyce Hueffer T S Eliot and Laforgue exult in the fact that he is one of the very few men who spoke at all of Laforgue to the English speakingand not reading public But how can I I like these men well enough myself and his enthusiasm is so slack that it  219  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  disconcerts mine if anything And as for Laforgue I love him so that I am ashamed for Laforgue of Pound s indecent flirting As for the elucidations which might pass instead of enthusiasm some of them I have quoted and here is another If the nineteenth century had built itself on Crabbe Ah if But no they wanted confections Naughty child that little nineteenth century  This book is the Statute of the American English élite The élite is always a self founded group of self appointed noblemen In the fact of this self appointment there is a bitter realization that no one but the candidates was there to do the appointing No one ever recognizes the élite and the élite must therefore come down and make a most undignified show of itself among people whom the élite is supposed to despise and whose opinion it is not to consider There and therewith the élite commits suicide  The book has no sadness no drunkenness no love no despair no whimsicality No human quality here nothing but opinions and an attitude Attitudes and opinions are such things as may be bought sold and exchanged like clothes they are never contributors to the welfare of the world since everybody possesses one or more and the world is not helped thereby Men are forces within the world and when they become conscious one hears an exaltation or a complaint and these are signs of life This world is one and ours These men opinionating assume that they stand out of the world Well they do and each of them ought to look around him and ascertain the space of air  220  Irritation  he is filling and make sure what sort of a ghost or reminiscence he is But of course they are not really outside the world they are an unease of the world of a kind which is too tenuous to demand a radical cure and which keeps feeding from itself its life a vicious circle  Ezra Pound has estranged himself It is a task for a broad shouldered Balzac to state the causes of such a fact but we who have read his book have suffered from the effects of it and this is our complaint And this is our resolution he cannot talk to us By us I mean readers artists and shoemakers We and I stand together with all the fools he so hopelessly curses acknowledge that there are many things the matter with us but we realize that he is not really interested and we consider his talk an intrusion he irritates us Emanuel Carnevali  RARE AIR  Trackless Regions and The Sword by G O Warren  B H Blackwell Oxford Eng  There are two things to write about oneself on the one hand and all the rest of the world on the other Mrs Warren writes entirely of the first the inside secret world of subjective emotion There is no trace in her poems of a warm close sympathy with people Her personality is withdrawn cold reserved and though loneliness is the keynote of many of her poems it is loneliness for spiritual kinship not for simple human love  221  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The reserved emotional temperament cannot easily break through into intimacy with other souls consequently its fervor often turns toward religious mysticism Too sensitive too ego centric to find joy and fulfilment in faulty blundering human relationships it takes refuge in an idealistic love which cannot fail When such an individual leads a religious or celibate life this mysticism becomes passionate even stiflingly sexual when he leads a normal human life his mysticism becomes mournful filled with defeated fervor  Through the withdrawal of so much vitality from the human side into the mystic such a nature outwardly cold secretly glowing feels itself more and more lonely misunderstood because through its inability to give warmly it also fails in being able to receive  In her acceptance of suffering one begins to suspect a determination to suffer She writes of others with an air of faint reproach Death is a frequent theme her own death or the death of a young and lovely woman in whom she seems to see herself Nevermore is her favorite word it appears again and again and when the word itself does not appear its connotation is apparent One says these things to disentangle himself from the beauty and delicate charm of the poems for they are musical and exquisite mournful and haunting One is helpless under the spell of their loveliness and yet one rebels this suffering of the poet and of the reader is after all unreal  The following phrases culled almost at random from a large number of poems are characteristic of Mrs Warren s  222  Rare Air  mood You never knew I am bitterly alone My love mocked and passed it by Where evermore the tides of night And earth will hide my lonely rest Silence for evermore Or is it the echo of my heart Returning like a lonely mateless cry My far flung sands of measureless desire To drown beneath Thy sea for evermore Her body lives with yours her lonely heart Asks but to bear a star begotten child To feed my dreams from my own bleeding breast  One of the lyrics Beside Great Waters may be quoted in full  The lonely heron broods beside the pool Greyer than his dusk wings the twilight falls And in its veil folds all the wood asleep Though still a wild bird calls  Now my lone heart awake dreams by the shore Of waters vaster than the earthly sea Dreams with a folded wing while still as night Thou driftest down o er me  The reaction of a spirit both delicate and hungry which cannot be fed with the actual experiences of living a spirit strong enough to shut itself away from reality has not a healthy beauty Such is the poetry of Mrs Warren She pours subjective suffering into nature distorts moonlight into shapes of delicate pain drapes veils of melancholy over lake forest and sky Her poems have rare beauty but there is a faint odor of disease about their very loveliness  M A S  223  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FOR BEGINNERS  New Voices an Introduction to Contemporary Poetry by Marguerite Wilkinson Macmillan Co  How to Read Poetry by Ethel M Colson A C McCIurg  amp Co  The number of books about it and about would seem to prove not only that the poetic renaissance has arrived but also that a large and eager but somewhat puzzled public is thronging to book shops schools lecture halls etc to acquire knowledge of its intricate and devious ways  Mrs Wilkinson does not speak to the initiated but to these eager enquirers She takes the puzzled public by the hand and gently leads it through a course of lessons illustrated by contemporary poems Part I on the technique consists of chapters on The Pattern of a Poem Organic Rhythm Images and Symbols Diction Certain Conservatives Certain Radicals and How Poems Are Made Part II on the spirit of contemporary poetry discusses Democracy and the New Themes Patriotism and the Great War Love Religion Nature and Personality in contemporary poetry ending with a brief chapter about Children and Poetry  No doubt the book will be serviceable to those for whom it is intended although considered as scholarship and criticism it is soft and uncertain in approach and grasp The expository chapters are better than the analytical for Mrs Wilkinson is informed in her subject and capable of gathering together and presenting familiarly the modern point of  224  For Beginners  view approximately and of choosing poems which illustrate fairly the various points of her thesis But when it comes to thinking for herself in criticism and interpretation her inadequacies become at once apparent In the chapter on Certain Radical Poets for example she is quite painfully beyond her depth either uttering banalities as in the discussion of Mr Oppenheim or shying off from even these as in the case of Mr Pound who is so clever that one mentions him with trepidation knowing how much amused he would be at the wrong thing said And as for Wallace Stevens her one reference to this poet quotes that superb that almost sublime grotesque  The light is like a spider  It crawls over the water  It crawls over the edges of the snow  It crawls under your eyelids  And spreads its webs there  Its two webs with the incredible comment Sometimes poems by very clever moderns fall short of being good poems simply because the symbols used in them could never have been realized and profoundly felt and are therefore rather more clever than true  In Part II one must criticize her analyzing The Spirit of Contemporary Poetry in terms of subjects such subjects as Democracy Love Religion Here again the author is beyond her depth but here the text is little more than a running comment upon quoted poems  However one may return to the opening statement that this book will be of service to a large public which is  225  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  beginning to be interested in modern poetry indeed that it is the best book yet offered to that audience Compared with such volumes as those of Professor Phelps and Howard  W Cook it is a masterpiece  If Mrs Wilkinson s book is for freshmen in the art Miss Colson s is for a still less initiate class advice and counsel offered by one who loves poetry to those who are as yet ignorant that such an art exists an excellent book one would think for high school or even grade school students and libraries H M  CORRESPONDENCE  A LONDON LETTER  The last time I wrote to Poetry on the subject of English verse was from a little house at Taintignies near Tournai in Belgium It was just after the Armistice and we had no coal I remember and outside there were ten degrees of frost and about a foot of snow so that to continue writing I had to stamp about and thaw my hands by blowing on them And yet instead of drinking whisky in the mess which would at least have kept me warm I couldn t help freezing over my article on poetry During the war I dropped every intellectual pursuit I had except writing poetry I agree with George Moore that there will always be a few fools ready to die for a poem And to day when the whole of Europe is in an ungodly mess as a result of the war when the most superficial observer must notice a  226  A London Letter  sharp decline in general morals and manners when even wealthy England is on the verge of bankruptcy when almost the whole life of the nation has become commercialised when art and artists are in a lamentable state of disorder and neglect to day there is more poetry in the publishers autumn lists than I can ever remember seeing before Certainly a great deal of it is trash yet even the trash has some circulation The question who buys it is interesting The poet s own friends cannot be the sole guilty parties Possibly this continued and inexplicable interest in poetry is due to a dumb revolt against the pressure of modern commercial life Or it may be which I don t believe that young Labor is buying  poetry  Going through a number of these new books I come to the conclusion that most of them will have no sort of interest for a cultivated American and that the others will almost certainly be published in the United States You do not need me to tell you that the edition of Mr Hardy s Collected Poems just published proves him as we always knew to be a great poet perhaps the only great poet now writing in English He makes most contemporary poets look rather like pygmies Francis Ledwidge s Collected Poems will almost certainly be issued in America so that you will see for yourselves what he is like He belonged to the Georgian Poetry type of writer was an Irishman was highly praised by Lord Dunsany and was killed in the war  Mr John Masefield has turned up again more English than ever He works the same old stunt of a newspaper  227  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  story long catalogues and delicious twiddley bits about Nature with a large N The book is called Ghost Heath Run and the run refers to a fox hunt For the benefit of the uninitiated it might be explained that the average Englishman adores anything to do with racing horses or killing small animals The vast circulation of the late Nat Gould was entirely due to his having perceived this fact But I think Mr Masefield is mistaken if he thinks that the average sporting Englishman will be brought to like poetry even by making the hounds and the fox its subject The poem will of course be hailed as a gloriously English piece of work in the same spirit that the inhabitants of Rotterdam might talk about a gloriously Dutch piece of cheese but it the poem will not last six months  Mr Arthur Waley has published another set of his translations from the Chinese Mr Waley is an official at the British Museum Library and therefore has facilities for acquiring and reading Chinese manuscripts He is an expert with a sense of poetic language and rhythm His translations are made in a vers libre which is often beautiful  Water s color at dusk still white  Sunset s glow in the dark gradually nil  Windy lotus shakes like broken fan  Wave moon stirs like string of jewels  Crickets chirping answer one another  Mandarin ducks sleep not alone  Little servant repeatedly announces night  Returning steps still hesitate  More Translations from the Chinese is a book worth having Like the earlier series it is published by Allen amp Unwin in London and Knopf in America  228  A London Letter  I see hardly anything else in this pile of books worth noting There is Miss Rose Macaulay s Three Days a book I shall want to keep It is without pretentiousness pose or rhetoric It should be read for a certain quietness and self obliterating charm And then there is Mr Pound s Quia Pauper Amavi which being by an American does not properly come within my province  Let us leave the hoary elders and listen to the roaring of the young lions Art and Letters Coterie Voices The Monthly Chapbook are all young periodicals started since the war and devoted largely to poetry Art and Letters is edited by Frank Rutter and Osbert Sitwell It has published poetry by T S Eliot Osbert Sitwell and Herbert Read Mr Sitwell has published two or three volumes of poetry was a contributor to the Wheels anthology and is mixed up with many new literary projects I think I have already written in America of Mr Read s Naked Warriors It is I think one of the best books of war poetry I have read It gives the feel of the trenches admirably I may add that unlike most war poets Mr late Captain Read has been there in the infantry Mr Eliot is of course an American poet I dislike his poetry but I think his prose is marvellous He is certainly by far the best young critic now writing in England  Coterie in spite of its name is less cliqueish than most young periodicals From the first number Henderson 2 6 net I would particularly select Mr Aldous Huxley s prose poems on Beauty The same author has a long rhymed  229  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  poem on Leda in the second number It is a pity that Marlowe and Keats came first but Mr Huxley has achieved one or two beautiful passages which have no echoes in them Other contributors whose work seems to me interesting are Edith Sitwell Helen Rootham translations of Rimbaud and L A G Strong J G Fletcher and Conrad Aiken also contribute The editor of Coterie is Mr Chaman Lall  Voices is edited by Mr Thomas Moult In the last three months it has published poems by Louis Golding H J Massingham F V Bramdford and many others This little periodical which is pleasantly outside the old pre war cliques has also printed prose by D H Lawrence Gordon Craig and St John Ervine  The Monthly Chapbook is the new form of Poetry and Drama So far it has published four numbers I Twenty three Contemporary Poets including John Alford Herbert Read Walter de la Mare H D Sassoon Lawrence Flint Sturge Moore Frederick Manning and Charlotte Mew II an essay on the theatre III old poems with new illustrations IV a long study of new French poetry by F S Flint This last is especially well worth having since as usual Mr Flint is in front of every other critic of contemporary French poetry in the country and has discovered a lot of new people I think he has got hold of a mare s nest in Cocteau and Birot whose funniness isn t nearly funny enough to be worth while but on the whole these notes are exceedingly useful Richard Aldington  230  NOTES  Mr Edwin Ford Piper is well known as the author of Barbed Wire and Other Poems of which the Midland Press

Rattlin Roarin Willie  Mrs Mary Austin is another distinguished contributor this month better known for her novels and other books in prose than for her verse of which only one poem the lyric drama

other engagements which prevent her giving due attention to this magazine she is compelled to resign from the Advisory Committee of POETRY  It is hardly necessary to say that the editor makes this

Frost s North of Boston Lindsay s General William Booth Enters Heaven the Imagists the Others group   I have read POETRY since the first number and find it constantly entertaining It has printed a great deal of extravagant stuff and not a little downright nonsensical stuff but in the main it has steered a safe and intelligible course with no salient blunders No other poetry magazines and there have been dozens of them has even remotely approached it in interest or for that matter in genuine hospitality to ideas   Miss Monroe has managed to retain a certain judicial calm in the midst of all the whooping and clapper clawing and so she has avoided running amuck and her magazine has printed the very best of the new poetry and avoided much of the worst  POETRY NEEDS YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PLEASE
