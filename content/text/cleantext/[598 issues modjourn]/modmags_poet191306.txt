fields sweep the shadows of the autumn clouds followed by the swift chasing sun  The bees forget to sip their honey  drunken with the light they foolishly hum and hover and the ducks in the sandy riverbank clamour in joy for mere nothing  None shall go back home brothers this morning none shall go to work We will take the blue sky by storm and plunder the  space as we run Laughters fly floating in the air like foams in the flood Brothers we shall squander our morning in futile  songs II  Keep me fully glad with nothing Only take my hand in your hand   In the gloom of the deepening night take up my heart and play with it as you list Bind me close to you with nothing  I will spread myself out at your feet and lie still Under this clouded sky I will meet silence with silence I will become one with the night clasping the earth in my breast  Make my life glad with nothing  The rains sweep the sky from end to end Jasmines in the wet untamable wind revel in their own perfume The cloud hidden stars thrill in secret Let me fill to the full my heart with nothing but my own depth of joy  III  My soul is alight with your infinitude of stars Your world has broken upon me like a flood The flowers of your garden blossom in my body The joy of life that is everywhere burns like an incense in my heart And the breath of all things plays on my life as on a pipe of reeds  IV  O you mad you superbly drunk If you kick open your doors and play the fool in public If you empty your bag in a night and snap your fingers  at prudence If you walk in curious paths and play with useless things Reck not rhyme or reason  Poems  If you break the rudder in two unfurling your sails before the storm Then I will follow you comrade and be drunken and go to the dogs  I have wasted my days and nights in the company of steady wise neighbors Much knowing has turned my hair grey and much watching has made my sight dim For years I have gathered and heaped all scraps and fragments of things Crush them and dance upon them and scatter them all to the winds For I know tis the height of wisdom to be drunken and go to the dogs  Let all crooked scruples vanish let me hopelessly lose my way Let a gust of wild giddiness come and sweep me away from my anchors The world is peopled with worthies and workers useful and clever There are men who are easily the first and men who come decently next Let them be happy and prosperous and let me be foolishly futile For I know tis the end of all works to be drunken and go to the dogs   I swear to surrender this moment all claim to the ranks of the sensible I let go my pride of learning and judgment of right and of wrong I ll shatter the vessel of memory scattering the last drop of tears With the foam of the ruby red wine I ll bathe and brighten my laughter The badge of the proper and prim I ll tear into shreds for the nonce I ll take the holy vow of being worthless and be drunken and go to the dogs  V  Leave off your works bride Listen the guest has come Do you hear he is gently shaking the fastening chain of the door Let not your anklets be loud and your steps be too hurried to meet him Leave off your works bride the guest has come in the evening  No it is not the wind bride Do not be frightened It is the full moon night of April shadows are pale in the court yard the sky overhead is bright Draw your veil over your face if you must take the lamp from your room if you fear No it is not the wind bride do not be frightened   Poems  Have no word with him if you are shy stand aside by the door when you meet him If he asks you questions lower your eyes in silence if you wish Do not let your bracelets jingle when lamp in hand you lead him in Have no word with him if you are shy  Have you not finished your works yet bride Listen the guest has come  Have you not lit the lamp in the cowshed  Have you not got ready the offering basket for the evening service Have you not put the auspicious red mark at the parting of your hair and done your toilet for the night 0 bride do you hear the guest has come Have you not finished your works yet  VI  Come as you are tarry not over your toilet  If your braiding has come loose if the parting of your hair be not straight if the ribbons of your bodice be not fastened do not mind Come as you are tarry not over your toilet  Come with quick steps over the grass If your feet are pale with the dew if your anklets slacken if pearls drop out of your chain do not mind Come with quick steps over the grass   Do you see the clouds wrapping the sky Flocks of cranes fly up from the further riverbank and  fitful gusts of wind rush over the heath The anxious cattle run to their stalls in the village Do you see the clouds wrapping the sky  In vain you light your toilet lamp it flickers and goes out in the wind  Surely who would know that with lamp black your eyelids are not touched For your eyes are darker than rain clouds  In vain you light your toilet lamp it goes out  Come as you are tarry not over your toilet If the wreath is not woven who cares If the wrist chain  has not been tied leave it by The sky is overcast with clouds it is late Come as you are tarry not over your toilet  VII Sing the song of the moment in careless carols in the  transient light of the day Sing of the fleeting smiles that vanish and never look back Sing of the flowers that bloom and fade without regret Weave not in memory s thread the days that would glide  into nights To the guests that must go bid God speed and wipe away all traces of their steps Let the moments end in moments with their cargo of fugitive songs   Poems  With both hands snap the fetters you made with your own heart chords Take to your breast with a smile what is easy and simple and near Today is the festival of phantoms that know not when they die Let your laughter flush in meaningless mirth like twinkles of light on the ripples Let your life lightly dance on the verge of Time like a dew on the tip of a leaf Strike in the chords of your harp the fitful murmurs of moments  VIII Lest I should know you too easily you play with me You blind me with flashes of laughter to hide your tears I know I know your art You never say the word you would  Lest I should prize you not you elude me in a thousand  ways Lest I should mix you with the crowd you stand aside I know I know your art You never walk the path you would  Your claim is more than others that is why you are silent With a playful carelessness you avoid my gifts I know I know your art You never accept what you would   Amidst the rush and roar of life O beauty carved in stone you stand mute and still alone and aloof Great Time sits enamoured at your feet and repeats to  you Speak speak to me my love speak my mute bride But your speech is shut up in stone O you immovably  fair X Tell me if this is all true my lover tell me if it is true When the eyes of me flash their lightning on you dark clouds in your breast make stormy answer  Is it then true that the dew drops fall from the night when I am seen and the morning light is glad when it wraps my body  Is it true is it true that your love travelled alone through ages and worlds in search of  me that when you found me at last your age long desire found utter peace in my gentle speech and my eyes  and lips and flowing hair  Is it then true that the mystery of the Infinite is written on this little brow of mine Tell me my lover if all this is true   Poems  XI  I asked of Destiny Tell me who with relentless hand  pushes me on Destiny told me to look behind I turned and saw my own self behind pushing forward the  self in front XII With a glance of your eyes you could plunder all the wealth of songs struck from poets harps fair woman But for their praises you have no ear therefore do I come to praise you You could humble at your feet the proudest heads of all the world But it is your loved ones unknown to fame whom you choose to worship therefore I worship you Your perfect arms would add glory to kingly splendor with their touch But you use them to sweep away the dust and to make clean your humble home therefore I am filled with awe XIII We both live in the same village and that is our one piece of joy The yellow bird sings in their tree and makes my heart dance with gladness Her pair of pet lambs come to graze near the shade of our garden If they stray into our barley field I take them up in my arms   The name of our village is Khanjuna and Anjana they call our river My name is known to all the village and her name is Ranjana  Only one field lies between us Bees that have hived in our grove go to seek honey in theirs Flowers launched from their landing stairs come floating by the stream where we bathe Baskets of dried kusm flowers come from their fields to our market The name of our village is Khanjuna and Anjana they call our river My name is known to all the village and her name is Ranjana  The lane that winds to their house is fragrant in the spring with mango flowers When their linseed is ripe for harvest the hemp is in bloom in our field The stars that smile on their cottage send us the same twinkling look The rain that floods their tank makes glad our Kadam forest The name of our village is Khanjuna and Anjana they call our river My name is known to all the village and her name is Ranjana   Poems  XIV  I found a few old letters of mine carefully hidden in thy box a few small toys for thy memory to play with With a timorous heart thou didst try to steal these trifles from the turbulent stream of time which washes away planets and stars and didst say These are only mine Alas there is no one now who can claim them who is able to pay their price yet they are still here Is there no love in this world to rescue thee from utter loss even like this love of thine that saved these letters with such fond care  O woman thou earnest for a moment to my side and touched me with the great mystery of the woman that there is in the heart of creation she who ever gives back to God his own outflow of sweetness who is the eternal love and beauty and youth who dances in bubbling streams and sings in the morning light who with heaving waves suckles the thirsty earth and whose mercy melts in rain in whom the eternal one breaks in two in joy that can contain itself no more and overflows in the pain of love  Rabindra Nath Tagore   TO MY FRIEND  When from the blossoms of the noiseful day Unto the hive of sleep and hushed gloom Throng the dim wingèd dreams what dreams are they That with the wildest honey hover home O they that have from many thousand thoughts Stolen the strange sweet of ever blossomy you A thousand fancies in fair coloured knots Which you are inexhausted meadow to  Ah what sharp heathery honey quick with pain Do they bring home It holds the night awake To hear their lovely murmur in my brain And sleep s wings have a trouble for your sake Day and you dawn together for at end With the first light breaks the first thought my Friend  Francis Thompson   PEACE ON EARTH  The Archer is wake The Swan is flying Gold against blue An Arrow is lying There is hunting in heaven Sleep safe till

hair is shining The Serpent writhes Orion is listening Gold against blue His sword is glistening Sleep There is hunting in heaven Sleep safe till tomorrow   SICILIAN EMIGRANT S SONG  In New York

mighty brooding pines and I am small And your great gaunt shadows crush me with a horror still and cold And your sullen silence holds me like a pall  Just today I went for water to a little silver spring Where the air was sweet and scarlet berries grew And my dreams came flocking homeward and my haunting fears took wing Till the night crawled forth to meet me Then I knew  I am stranger to your silence I am alien to your might I am longing for a little laughing world Where the days went dancing past me for my heart was very light And from many friendly hearths the smoke upcurled  Yet he loves you lonely mountains and he says he loves me too And his cabin nestles trusting at your feet But my heart is torn with longing for the gentle land I knew And the careless hours when life was very sweet   Will you always frown upon me through the weary weary years Till my dream home fades to silence and to night I was gay O brooding mountains till you taught me pain and tears I am alien to your solitude and might  Helen Cowles Le Cron  BIRD OF PASSION  Leave the lovely words unsaid For another thought is fled From my dream entangled mind Bird of passion unenshrined I can never phrase thee quite So I speed thee on thy flight Unembodied thus forever Floating in a mist that never May be raised Thou art one Of the black winged birds that run With uncomprehended flight Unimpeded down the night  Rollo Britten   SIMAETHA  Thou art wine Simaetha When mine eyes drink thee My blood flames with the golden joy thou art Bewildering me until thy loveliness Is veiled in its own light nor know I then Pure brows and placid lips and eyes and hair With wind and sunlight glorious but all Are mingled in one flame Oh thou in me Art shrined as none hath seen thee as gods live Whom Time shall not consume nor rusts thy gold Ever so hath my soul enclosed thee round With its divine air Yea thy very life Which flows through all the guises of thy moods Escaping as they die and laughs and weeps And builds again its beauty have I set Beyond the jeopards of rough time yea all Thine ivory imperilled loveliness And winey sanguine where the cheek s curve takes Light as a bloom upon it not to pass So there be God  Thy praise hath made speech song And song from lip to lip flies and black ships Bear it from sea to sea and on some quay Where rise tall masts and gay booths flank the ways A tumbler sings it and an alien air Trembles with thee while strange men wonder dumb To see thee pass thou being all my song AT EVEN  Hush ye Hush ye My babe is sleeping Hush ye winds that are full of sorrow Hush ye rains from your weary weeping Give him slumber until to morrow  Hush ye yet In the years hereafter Surely sorrow is all his reaping Tears shall be in the place of laughter Give him peace for a while in sleeping  Hush ye hush he is weak and ailing Send his mother his share of weeping Hush ye winds from your endless wailing Hush ye hush ye my babe is sleeping  FROM DEMETER  The Faun s Call  Korè O Korè where art thou fled Now that the spring blows white in the land Shake out the honied locks of thy head Plunder the lilies that lie to thy hand Dew laden lilies loved of the bees Murmuring in them till shadows grow long With quickening silence under the trees Ere break the voluptuous thrillings of song From the brown throated sweet harbourers there Raptured and grieving under the stars  Frederic Manning  COMMENTS AND REVIEWS INCARNATIONS BEINGseemsand a an editor involves a few surprises It cold enterprise at first an adventurous reaching out into mysterious voids distances a groping with empty hands But soon one s finger tips tingle with spirit  touches psychic manifestations of life afar Documentary evidence of this life comes rushing in white winged messages of sympathy messages of protest Human eyes stare through the veil human hands reach in through one s isolation human souls tell their most sacred secrets flaunt the colors of their most darkly besieged dreams  Printed books soon begin to seem unresponsive to an editor strangely remote and cold For manuscripts even the modern kind beaten into type are alive each one is charged with personality it comes hot from the author s hand Sometimes the queer ones are the most poignant of all the ragged epic the stodgy tragedy the plodding lyric on which some lonely but adventurous fellow creature has staked his hope of fame Yes the most poignant these for each whatever its content is a tragedy the stake is lost the midnight oil has been burned in vain  And now and then some dimly imagined figure takes shape some half heard voice becomes definitely audible    some signer of manuscripts becomes a poet incarnate who walks into one s office like any beggar or king any queen or milkmaid of this ever various world For the present editor the first of these incarnations was the serenely noble laureate of Bengal who honors us this month with a group of lyrics Here manifestly was the ideal poet the prophet aware of his world and now great heartedly adopting ours the Ambassador Extraordinary from East to West bearing no passports from king to president but speaking with supreme authority from race to race writing a brave chapter in that epic of human brotherhood which must be sung around the world when locomotives and swift steamers when traders travellers teachers warriors shall have opened wide the gates  Not the antagonism but the sympathy between the two vast branches of the Aryan stock was the important revelation in this great Hindoo s visit He had lived essentially our life and won from it spiritual exaltation which each of us in however slight degree must aspire to now and then His sense of humor was as quick as ours his judgment as shrewd he understood us better than we being prejudiced could understand ourselves and so his journey around the world must avail for more intimate knowledge As he has brought something of India to us he will carry something of ours back to his people  A few young men beginning as far away voices have taken bodily form before our very eyes The first of them was Arthur Davison Ficke whose latest book   Incarnations  Twelve Japanese Painters betrays his oriental sympathies through its delicately toned rhyme pictures in honor of the masters of the Ukioye The next to emerge was Witter Bynner from classic Cornish whose fearsome tragedy in the May Forum springing from dark depths of human pity achieves a kind of stark stripped ruthless poetry fit for the imaging of that iron cross on which millions of women have been crucified Then came Alfred Noyes reading his buccaneer ballads so wittily that we were almost transported back into the slashing days of good Queen Bess or sad King Charles And now as the spring grows warm comes from Lincoln s own country a poet of Lincoln s own breed Nicholas Vachel Lindsay  A big breezy cheerful troubadour is this young man who accepts without complaint the modern world s refusal to pay its poets a living wage quite simply takes us at our word and turns beggar that he may effect a free exchange of rhymes for bread Wholly sturdy and high hearted is his faith in himself and his town his brave resolve to leaven our whole lump with a bit of yeast in Springfield Some day the rich collectors will bid high for those enlivening war bulletins of his and for that free magazine whose first and last number with its stirring prophecies and symbolic decorations preaches the gospel of beauty to the new age  There is something of the crusaders spirit in the  Rhymes for Bread which may be bought for a song or a   dinner or even a two cent stamp That this crusader s sword is sharp Mr Lorimer whom it scarred can testify also its edge and temper are proved by Galahad The Trap The Soul of the Spider and the lofty and beautiful poem in honor of the late Governor Altgeld Sleep softly Eagle forgotten under the stone  But often our crusader sheathes his sword and deserts the highways for the meadows to sing in perfect happiness of The King of Yellow Butterflies The Wizard Wind or even The Grave of the Righteous Kitten Not since Riley wrote his gay lyrics has any poet touched familiar subjects with such high and illuminating comedy or set them off with such fragrance and sparkle of imagery  Mr Lindsay is the real thing And with this latest visitor ends for the present the tale of the editor s adventures H M  STÉPHANE MALLARMÉ  The other night at Covent Garden we saw the incomparable Nijinsky mimic the Faun in Stéphane Mallarmé s delightful poem with music by Debussy When years ago I had those memorable talks with the poet I little thought the day would come when The Afternoon of a Faun would receive a baptism of inspired music at the hands of the most gifted musician of his kind and a stage portrayal by the greatest choreographic artist living  The performance at Covent Garden was a triumph for three the poet the composer and the dancer The circle is now complete   Stéphane Mallarmé  Where and how did the Parnassian school begin At the salon of the Marquise de Ricard during the last years of the wonderful Second Empire Here the members of the new group were wont to meet take counsel together and read aloud certain of their poems No other salon in all Europe could offer such a galaxy of rising poetic genius The magic circle on this particular evening included Sully Prudhomme and François Coppée both future Academicians Catulle Mendès the brilliant young leader of the Parnassians Villiers de l Isle Adam and his friend Stéphane Mallarmé the two most daring and original spirits of the celebrated movement  When I arrived in Paris in 1869 this new school was firmly established with Leconte de Lisle as the recognized master One evening the Marquise de Ricard was seated in her famous room adjoining the grand salon surrounded by guests who belonged to the inner circle all the others having taken their departure The hostess and the favored ones now en petit comité were ready for the event of the evening or rather the morning for it was long past midnight The room had a romantic aspect with its warm soft colors its long heavy curtains and its thick tapis de moquette The hostess announces the great event Villiers de I Isle Adam who is a follower of Beaudelaire and Poe is about to read his unpublished drama Morgane It is four o clock when he ceases reading and when the guests leave the house all are under the potent spell Mallarmé has been pro   foundly impressed He and the author of Morgane become close friends  Villiers de l Isle Adam declared that genius is essentially silent and that whatever revelation it makes is by suggestion instead of by direct expression In one word genius should never explain anything And this was also Mallarmé s method of thought and work This is why hardly one Frenchman in a thousand could understand Mallarmé s prose while it was necessary one day for Catulle Mendès to explain one of Mallarmé s poems to a group of literary friends  Stéphane Mallarmé is now almost popular and popularity is what he most dreaded Yet even in his own time he had a distinguished and powerful following I can see them now sitting almost in silence puffing at cigarettes in the little room while the host stood at a corner of the fire place waiting for the next idea or a remark from some guest all without hurry or excitement The evenings were quiet and at certain moments quaker like the visitors entered into no discussion having too much respect for the host There was no loud talk Some of the guests sat the whole evening without uttering a word When I wanted to talk with Mallarmé intimately I saw him alone At such times we talked of Whitman Verlaine Beaudelaire but of Poe most of all Mallarmé had published a volume of translations from Poe and his admiration for the American poet had no limits He insisted that Poe was an Irish poet who had nothing of the Anglo American   Reviews  Villiers de l Isle Adam was a gifted musician and sometimes improvised macabre melodies on the piano while he recited some verses of his own Mallarmé was a passionate lover of the best music and his one ambition was to make his verse musical to suggest in words what music might suggest in sounds He did not care whether people understood him or not François Coppée was the least musical of all the Parnassians Probably that is why I never cared for his poetry As for my gifted friend Sully Prudhomme his poetic mantle fell off when he became didactic which was towards the close of his life but then Sully Prudhomme was one of the greatest psychological analysts the French Academy has possessed during the past hundred years  Many of the young visitors to Mallarmé s salon are now celebrities Henri de Régnier whom I often met there is now an Academician Francis Grierson  REVIEWS  The Youth Replies and Other Verses by Louis How Sherman French amp Co  There is a quality of freshness in this book a breath of ideas but the poet is too easily satisfied with the commonplace word and with unexpert rhythms the minor accents being too pronounced for the larger major rhythms For this reason the shorter poems are more successful than the longer ones A Factory Girl Too Late To a Young Poet Who is Modern and several of the small poems single    themselves out for appreciation Mr How s sonnets have a pattern rather metrically exact yet they say more than the average modern sonnet  The Queen of Orplede by George Wharton Stork J  B Lippincott Co  Facile verse exhibiting a lyric quality that might be perfected by a more precise and discriminate choice of words This poem is typical  Scent of the wild wet marshes  And lisp of the lazy sea  And a mouldering wreck mid the coarse green flags  Looming dismally  Scent of the dank dark marshes  And boom of the lonely sea  And a screaming sea gull sweeping by  Like a startled memory  Songs Before Birth by Isabelle Howe Fiske The  Mosher Press  Expressing the emotion of expectant maternity and  the sorrow of bereavement these poems have a graceful  and delicate lyric charm but the personal note is inevi  tably the most poignant  The Wind on the Heath Ballads and Lyrics by May Byron George H Doran Co  Poems with the swinging movement of the dynamic ballad pattern of sufficient force and vitality to compete with Mr Noyes Mr Service and other modern balladists  The red sailed barges stagger where the seething vapours crawl  The towering clippers pierce the fog beyond the dim dock wall  And the steamers each to each  Cry out in strident speech  And the liners hoot and bellow through the murk of Limehouse Reach    Reviews  Poems by Herbert Kaufman George H Doran Company  According to an English critic Mr Kaufman plays no stringed instrument he beats upon the drum of life Upon the ear drums would have been nearer These are distinctly poems of purpose Why Are You Weeping Sister and The Waiting Woman are propagandist treatises on the social evil and many of the other poems remind one of boxers prize fighters and similar heroes whose only apparent mission in life is to be strong And Mr Kaufman s poems are victimized by this excessive gymnastic exercise they are essentially muscle bound The spirit of them is strenuous to say the least It is representative of a tendency of many minds who picture Evil Injustice Wrong as if it lived in some definite given place and they are going out to find this bearded creature crouching in its lair and fight it by St George with naked hand But the search is inevitably fruitless the glory is in the shouting and the arming for battle And to this militant spirit is added the aggressive progressive insistency of modern America This is your Hour belongs distinctly to the DO IT NOW school of commercial optimism  This is your hour creep upon it  Summon your power leap upon it  Grasp it clasp it hold it tight  Strike it spike it with full might  If you take too long to ponder  Opportunity may wander  Yesterday s a bog of sorrow  No man ever finds tomorrow    The Great River Poems and Pictures by Frederick Oakes Sylvester Chicago 1911  These poems celebrate the Mississippi River as the haunt of boyhood and companion of maturity The verse is obviously that of a beginner but there is a certain homely sincerity in it and a genuine feeling for nature not glossed with sentimentality  The best thing in the book is the description of the town by the river Where quaint old fashioned houses Behind the fir trees hide  but now changing  A fatal thing she nourishes for lo She gives an alien child her breasts to nurse Whose lips are iron and whose heart is brass And dreaming does not realize nor know  Its very touch a menace is and curse  A Walled Garden and Other Poems by Margaret Root Garvin The Mosher Press  Some of the poems in this volume are very charming An occasional inversion mars direct expression but the general lyric quality is exceptionally good The following triolet contains in eight lines what most Memorial Day orators take forty minutes to expound  On their swords the red rust  On their graves the red roses Like old Hate turned to dust On their swords the red rust While Love blooms as it must So this day dawn discloses On their swords the red rust On their graves the red roses  The Night Watch and The Narcissus Pool are two other poems that might be quoted    Reviews  A Dome of Many Colored Glass by Amy Lowell Houghton Mifflin Company  Miss Lowell s volume contains sonnets and lyrics chiefly reflective and contemplative somewhat remote and approaching a tonal twilight but rhythmic in quality and exhibiting purity of taste and an instinct for artistic selection  This book the little volume by Mrs Fiske that by Miss Garvin and other recent publications of feminine authorship justify a rather interesting characterization that is that in this day and generation in our country it is the women who sing  The lyric note the pure song quality is very largely sheltered by feminine wings By their ministration is the Cavalier music prolonged and the half forgotten Elizabethan kinship between verse and the stringed instrument This is no small contribution certainly for the idea that delicacy and strength may not be synonymous is one that especially needs negative emphasis in this day of the confused sense of correspondence between the brutal and the strong The observation is made casually but there are many voices to sustain it The singing man it may be is out of fashion but we regret the loss of the lute player as well as the lute   CORRESPONDENCE  A WORD TO MR POUND Sir I have little Tuscan and no Provençal but I seem to discern in your verse a slap at this generation of the thoroughly smug Therefore it was with pained surprise that I discovered you had taken some lines of mine as text for your phillipic Pax Saturni At first it seemed funny then it seemed unfair and finally I made up my mind that it was simply stupid My lines were ironical you know Of course you know what irony is because you descend to it yourself in Pax Saturni though I may be mistaken How would you like it if I were to amputate Say there are no oppressions  Say it is a time of peace  Say that labor is pleasant  Speak of the American virtues  and clap it at the head of an ode entitled President Taft Wouldn t it seem ridiculous to you  No Mr Aggressively Contemporary Pound here in America very few people indeed believe that these are fair peaceful happy days And of course the event which I symbolize occurred very recently Lincoln Steffens magnificient try for peace during the trial of the McNamaras Perhaps I wrong you but no one else misunderstood my lines  If your criticism had been one of poetic form I should have respected it at any rate    Correspondence  I am glad you and Walt Whitman are friends You ought to have known each other long ago  John Reed  LINES TO W B  What do we write of but the petty treasuries of little men Boxes of buttons for shirt fronts and links for the sleeves Cigarette puffs of sentiment cigarette cases of silver Gardens and streams that abound on the tables of  restaurants And mountains that amass in pigeon holes  Or we lie supine in a hammock Humming fastidious news of the future Doubts of the present and hopes of antiquity Changes of passion as real as the rote of an actor Professions of fellowship wooden and stale as a pulpit  We are evaders and strummers Our words are the popping of corks And our lives go to settle the payment But there s something we call Greek which we take like  cloves for the breath  And whom shall we call on pray to heed and to  hurry our message But opera chairs limousines and their occupants Women who earnestly nod over nonsense    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Heavy academies canting And coteries wearing soft collars The elite and the slums of illusion  Show me a forehead shining with a star And let me hear a voice whose breath Has not been tempered by electric fans Nor manufactured in a squeaking doll But driven by the inner whirr of forces elemental and  alive and true And I will show you such an audience Of common sense As grows in these new times To alter taste with honesty And be the human dwelling of a poet  Witter Bynner  ON FIRST OPENING THE LYRIC YEAR  It is a certain satisfaction to overlook a cemetery All the little two yard long mounds that vary So negligibly after all I mean it brings on a mood Of clear proportions I remember once how I stood Thinking one summer s day how good it must be to spend Some thousand years there from beginning to the end There on the cool hillside But with that feeling grew  the dread    Notes  That I too would have to be like all the other dead That unpleasant sense which one has when one smothers Unhappy to leave so much behind merely to resemble  others It s good no doubt to lie socially well ordered when one has so long to lie But for myself somehow this does not satisfy  W C W NOTES  Mr Rabindra Nath Tagore poet and musician was bom in Calcutta in 1861 His first work of importance an opera written at eighteen was followed by plays stories novels and poems culminating in the Gitanjali or Song Offerings six lyrics from which in Poetry last December introduced this great Bengal poet to American readers  A year ago Mr Tagore left India and after a few months in England came to this country last autumn for a half year s sojourn Much of this time he has spent in translating his poems his knowledge of English being sensitive and profound Also he has written directly in our language a series of lectures on the religion of India and given them at the Universities of Harvard Chicago Illinois Wisconsin and elsewhere  Mr Tagore s lyrics are sung throughout Bengal by the people and many of them form part of the simple ritual of the Brahma Somaj church of which Maharshi Saint Devendra Nath Tagore father of the poet was a
