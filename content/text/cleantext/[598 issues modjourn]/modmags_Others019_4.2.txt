BLANDING SLOAN WALLACE STEVENS ####BAXTER ALDEN 5 IN INK OF INDIA AND GOLD I A windless ebon night. White poppies spill their fragrance through the silence. The sky is gold; The sky is hard and pure and clear. The pallid petals drift and drift like snow; A god with beauty wounded bleeds and dies. II Where lies this land, this land of spectral gold With sullen, swinging shadows deeper hued Whereon twist purple roads in fading curves With wild, black furrows where a chariot sped And left an angry, splendid resonance? Here now two lonely peacocks, white as death, Fight on and on within the golden night; They splash the shadows with their pink, starred feet. ##6 BAXTER ALDEN III The splendor of a windy twilight flung In ink of India across a screen Which drinks its substance leaving shadowed there Life-like to float above it—irised—rich— A burnished peacock which the great winds beat To swirling emerald and stern sapphire— Gold goblin eyes aghast within a sea.

Two million-petaled winter plum trees near Spray the darkness with soft flower-stars. ##MAXWELL BODENHEIM 7 PARADE OF CONSCRIPTED SOLDIERS One soldier's face is like a mirror In which a dying child dangles from a string. One soldier's face is flat stone With bitter hieroglyphics of silence Cut deeply into it. Another soldier's face is a twitching white bird Suddenly clawed by a long-taloned question. And still another soldier's face Is that of a grave clown awkwardly bowing to death. O silent stiff-fingered people on the curbstone, You do not see this, but you feel Unspoken words from the marching conscripts Striking your faces like weakened fists. EAST-SIDE CHILDREN PLAYING This lame boy with eyes like rain-washed berries, Stares at an orange on a push-cart, And seems a dwarf-tree slightly leaning toward the sun. Behind him, a chubby girl buried in soiled pink clothes, Swings her candy stick as though it were a scepter And the doorstep on which she sits an ancient throne. Above her, two boys with faces Like clumsily painted cherubs, Calmly slap each other's cheeks, and joyously weep. Then, a twisted washed out old man Drags himself past, and the children smile at him.##OTHERS A Number for the Mind's eye Not to be read aloud Edited by WILLIAM SAPHIER DECEMBER, 1917 Published by OTHERS 63 West Ontario Street CHICAGO, ILL.

The first mood kissed the breast of the other, And the little wine-song leapt up And filled the flagon with his pale purple breath. Then the two moods died, and he who bore them, Being an old man, sat down to make others. TO DOROTHY Too light to be a shadowed dimple Upon a dragon-fly's sheer wings, Your presence clings to my heavy soul Like some unseen ghost of dandelion-fluff. My soul must clumsily stoop And cup its hands over your presence, Keeping, yet not daring to touch it.## MAXWELL BODENHEIM 9 WHIMSY See—with a twirl of fingers I scatter this tousled drab of a cobweb Creeping between the jet curls Of your sleeping, wine-puffed longing. Yet, he makes but the wraith of a grimace, As though he spied me in his sleep. Alas, it will take more than cobweb-snapping To lift him up again ! But there's a spider hid in his orange doublet, Who, some day, will sting his wine-puffed slumber. FACTORY-GIRL Why are your eyes like dry brown flower-pods? Still, gripped by the memory of lost petals? I feel that, if I touched them, They would crumble to falling brown dust, And you would stand with blindness revealed. Yet you would not shrink, for your life Has been long since memorized, And eyes would only melt out against its high walls. Besides, in the making of boxes Sprinkled with crude forget-me-nots, One is curiously blessed, if one's eyes are dead. ##10 LOUISE BOGAN BETROTHED You have put your two hands upon me, and your mouth ; You have said my name as a prayer. Here where trees are planted by the water I have watched your eyes, cleansed from regret And your lips, closed over all that love cannot say .  .  . .  .  . My mother remembers the agony of her womb And long years that seemed to promise more than this. She says, "You do not love me, You do not want me, You will go away." In the country whereto I go I shall not see the face of my friend Nor her hair the color of sun-burned grasses ; Together, we shall not find The land on whose hills bends the new moon In air traversed of birds. What have I thought of love? I have said, "It is beauty and sorrow," I have thought it would bring me lost delights, and splendor As a wind out of old time .  .  . But there is only the evening here And the sound of willows Now and again dipping their long oval leaves in the water. ##LOUISE BOGAN 11 THE YOUNG WIFE I I do not believe in this first happiness, But one day I shall know that love is not a fruited bough Low bending to the hand ; One day I shall know that love is the secret wind Rippling the grass Along hillsides in the night; That it is the tree in spring Holding lightly in the air its shining twigs And with its roots throbbing in darkness. So I shall take less love now And not think it as due me, And I shall not watch the eyes of my lover, their every glance, Nor take his day as mine, nor count the hours of his night. Even though love comes hard With all the labor of the spring, Though I may wish to grasp that for which I have suffered And crush it to me with a tight hand. ##12 LOUISE BOGAN A day comes when all must go. Love does not stand; Love does not wait; No man can follow after love— A day dawns with a wild sky, I have laid my hand to the earth and felt how it is cold, I have seen the little leaves that the poplar tree lets fall upon the wind. II Had I the sweet skin of Helen And Deirdre's autumn-colored hair I could not be as beautiful as all beautiful women. I cannot have the voices of all beautiful women Were my voice bright with the trill and quiver of water,— Nor their laughter Nor their speech. Though I might choose delicate words I could not speak so fair as they. ##LOUISE BOGAN 13 They have taken everything from me, The beautiful women my lover has had before me,— Gentle touches of cheek to cheek, The embraces of passion and of terror; They have given all to him before me: Love in the night, Tears, Trust and suffering and long desire— I can but repeat these, and say them over, All love's thousand things. He has kissed me with closed eyes, Embraced me with a hidden face, And I did not know whose kiss he took and whose face burned behind his eyelids. And all women will bear me out in this, All women now yielding to a lover, And all of other years: Ye, poor queens, And ye, poor haughty ladies. ##14 MARY CAROLYN DAVIES I The moon is a girl Riding a white pony Over the gray sagebrush Of the sky; The stars are frightened white rabbits That run across the path in front of her. II The moon is a silver fish; The tall pine has caught it In the net of its flung branches And stands watching its struggles And waiting: for it to die. III The clouds are sea-gulls Flying over the ocean of the sky; The moon is a lighthouse, And the white-bodied clouds Beat their gray wings against it. IV From one of the branches Of the magnolia tree In our garden It is large and creamy and fragrant; It is the first flower of the year. The other buds are angry Because it has opened first. Buds, do not be angry! For it will wither And fall Before the morning— ##JEANNE D'ORGE 15 THE CONVENT Nice to be God   .   .   . My passions sit in long white rows within the little chapel sending incense up to me or fast singing in lonely cells or walk whispering together thru grey cloisters. Last night a wild cat novice broke her vows and now her sisters wear away the stone praying for her. They cannot guess who slipped the bolts Who rode with her Who gave her to her lover   .   .   . Nice to be God   .   .   . THE FRESHMAN His tadpole mind wiggles in humorous waters growing legs and laughter. He aspires to solemnity. He would be a frog and sit with other large frogs upon a philosophic bench croaking. SEA-MOOD My ecstasy has long blue fingers like the sea; moves to the rhythm of the tides upon your shores ; carving stone strength and rugged silence into slow passionate curves of music. ##16 JEANNE D'ORGE STOLEN I crept slyly to your table .  . Oo .  .  . m Sugared peaches drowned in chianti . . . Destiny shaped heavily like a nurse girl yanked me by the ear planked me in my high chair. "There" said she "Eat what is set before you Impudence." Oh bread and butter flat every-dayness monotony milk. THE  PROBLEM  IS The problem is— but I forgot—there is no problem. I have only to put my sea into a bottle of thin green glass simple of form, as you suggest; and to enclose my sky in a carven case of pure ivory. The test will be when these stand upon your writing-table. Will my sea fill the room with its salt and its singing, with wine, with vigor and movement? Will my sky escape lean over and give her suns and moons and the lightning of her silence and manna of rest and musical sleep?## DAVID O'NEIL 17 REGENERATION I lie fallow, Crumbling with the freeze And the thaw, Yet I hold you, As the wind brought you, Wondrous seed. And with rain And sun And spring You will ripen And your roots Quicken And deepen in my heart. A NAVAJO POET His bronzed face aglow With the light of a wish; His whittled arrows, Sun-vow arrows Lean and clean, For a journey To the sun . . . The shavings He left For whistling winds To play with. INHERITANCE Ancient trees Complacently usurping The sunshine; With forelooking tenderness Whispering to the saplings In their palsied shadows : "There is safety In our shadow But you will wither In our shadow." ##18 DAVID O'NEIL THE PRODIGAL SON Where the rivers Ravage the shore, Willows like mothers Hold the sloping banks, And lean With a tender understanding Of the stream. THE UNQUIET He thought to solve The unquiet of his heart, In the stillness of solitude; But the ticking of the clock, Penetrated the silence; Then song-sparrows sang In the evergreens at his window ; And there came the ache Of a heavily loaded wagon Straining Up the hill ; And the voices of things in his room Clamored, Till he sought the noise of the city For its silence. LIME LIGHT See the giant trees Of the lowland, How they lose Their symmetry Seeking a place In the sun. ##DAVID ROSENTHAL 19 THE PAINT BOX When the only color On God's palette Is gray-When he smudges the sky With gray— And the hills And the fields And the lawns And the hearts of men With gray— I steal into the play-room Of my mind And take out the paint box My mother gave me A million years ago— And I smudge The hills with purple And the fields with gold, The lawns with blue And the hearts of men with crimson— There is always someone Who paints with laughter When the only color On God's palette Is tears. SYLVANETTES Rain on the Lake To-day The lake is a disillusioned mirror-Weeping— Because its mistress has grown old. . . . ##20 DAVID ROSENTHAL Rain on the Lake Little pearl fire-flies Pirouetting— In sparkling pizzicatos— On blue glass. . . . ##   ##    ## Over the Lake a Birch-Tree Bendin Little birch-tree With your nude body Your white, melodious body— You are a young girl Combing your hair in the glass, Awaiting your first beloved. . . . ##    ##    ## In the Birch-Trees the Swallows Playing Swallows You are silver songs Chasing each other And playing tag— Swallows You are the songs I make for my beloved They too, play tag In the birch-tree of her heart. . . . ##    ##    ## Across the Moon a Thin Veil Moon You are a woman Draped in black Pale and beautiful— Mourning the little birds That sang Through the windows Facing the dawn While you fed them the silver crumbs of your youth. . . . ##MARJORIE ALLEN SEIFFERT 21 PRINT BY KIYONAGA (Design of Spring Greenery) Take San, willow by a stream, How can I catch again The echo of your loveliness, and how design Your slender body—Oh passionless Mirage of beauty! My hands are cold, are dead, And they no longer reach Toward beauty, toward your breast, My hands are old, are dead, Yet all you taught them once They still remember. Today again As last spring when you came, My old hands quiver, The wind stirs in them, (old hands, Then young as willows by a stream). Now like dead leaves in withered confusion They tremble in the April wind Blown by your loveliness Across my being, Take San . . . Once touching your beauty I found it flame, Touching your beauty my fingers went blind. Take San, uncaptured dream, My hands design That exquisite illusion— Beauty and desire at peace Merged in your body, fresh and cool As shining willows by a stream. ##22 MARJORIE ALLEN SEIFFERT A PRINT BY HIROSHIGE (The Bow-Moon) From the dawn, Take San, Ungathered star, Follow me back through night Till I recapture Evening. The bending hours of darkness Sway apart like lilies Before the backward blowing wind Of my desire. At last Bearing in her mysterious bosom Unravished beauty, Dark Yesterday folded in robes of twilight, Rises against her silent sky, Irrevocable—secret— Confronting the fantastic dream of an impossible Tomorrow. There is a bridge, Frail, delicate, immutable, Arching above the rising moon, More everlasting than the fading sky, Joining What-was-not with What-might-have-been, That were Today If I had loved you, Take San, If you had loved me. ##J. BLANDING SLOAN 23 KISS Your kiss Is like the nestling Of a warming tear Upon a limpid drooping lash, The faintest curling of beloved lips In the launching of a smile, First blush of maiden's cheek At thought of being loved, A whisp of luscious fumed almost nothing Breathed into a lover's ear. Yes, 'tis like nothing.   Save your kiss. PAM Fleeting wave thoughts Whose crimson tips of foam Were drained in tiny dripplings From deepest cell Of fore-drained heart. Struggling uncalmed ever. Full emptied heart awaits A fine white sea gull With black tipped wings Against a cobalt sky, Flying unhesitatingly Into the face of fate; A whitest ivory column; Cool ray of moon Which comes and calms And goes to leave disturbed; A glorious swan grown feather Tipped with bronze, Expanding in the sun; ##24 J. BLANDING SLOAN A tear from lash of God And gilt beam striking there Bursting into millions Of sun threads As delicate As web of phantom spider. A thought Of clearest stillest water In a mellow marble pool; A gentle warmth of breath Through china silk; A faintest stir of summer air; A nature fumed breeze Amove among new grass blades A freshest scented wind, Compensation for all longing; A wind!   A flash! A burst of light! And calm.##       WALLACE STEVENS 25 VALLEY CANDLE My candle burned alone in an immense valley. Beams of the huge night converged upon it, Until the wind blew. Then beams of the huge night Converged upon its image, Until the wind blew. THIRTEEN WAYS OF LOOKING AT A BLACKBIRD I Among twenty snowy mountains, The only moving thing Was the eye of the blackbird. II I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. III The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds, It was a small part of the pantomime. IV A man and a woman Are one. A man and a woman and a blackbird Are one. V I do not know which to prefer— The beauty of inflections Or the beauty of innuendoes, The blackbird whistling Or just after. ##26 WALLACE STEVENS VI Icicles filled the long window With barbaric glass. The shadow of the blackbird Crossed it, to and fro. The mood Traced in the shadow An indecipherable cause. VII O thin men of Haddam, Why do you imagine golden birds? Do you not see how the blackbird Walks around the feet Of the women about you? VIII I know noble accents And lucid, inescapable rhythms; But I know, too, That the blackbird is involved In what I know. IX When the blackbird flew out of sight, It marked the edge Of one of many circles. X At the sight of blackbirds Flying in a green light, Even the bawds of euphony Would cry out sharply. XI He rode over Connecticut In a glass coach. Once, a fear pierced him, In that he mistook The shadow of his equipage For blackbirds. ##WALLACE STEVENS 27 XII The river is moving. The blackbird must be flying. XIII It was evening all afternoon. It was snowing And it was going to snow. The blackbird sat In the cedar-limbs. THE WIND SHIFTS This is how the wind shifts : Like the thoughts of an old human, Who still thinks eagerly And despairingly. The wind shifts like this: Like a human without illusions, Who still feels irrational things within her. The wind shifts like this: Like humans approaching proudly, Like humans approaching angrily. This is how the wind shifts: Like a human, heavy and heavy, Who does not care. MEDITATION How long have I meditated, O Prince, On sky and earth? It comes to this, That even the moon Has exhausted its emotions. What is it that I think of, truly? The lines of blackberry bushes, The design of leaves— Neither sky nor earth Express themselves before me . . . Bossuet did not preach at the funerals Of puppets. ##28 GRAY ROOM Although you sit in a room that is gray, Except for the silver Of the straw-paper, And pick At your pale white gown; Or lift one of the green beads Of your necklace, To let it fall ; Or gaze at your green fan Printed with the red branches of a red willow; Or, with one finger, Move the leaf in the bowl— The leaf that has fallen from the branches of the forsythia Beside you .  .  . What is all this? I know how furiously your heart is beating. ########Pamphlets in preparation : A Negro Number A Play Number OTHERS will be published every six weeks and sub-cribers will receive 12 numbers for $1.50.
