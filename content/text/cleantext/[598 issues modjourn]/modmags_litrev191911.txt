their hands are excessively uglyYet in spite of all this their eyes are intelligenttheir smiles gentlemelancholycompassionateAnd though they have a look of formidable grossness and stupiditythere ison

Long sought potent trivialityUndetermined angleStars split across the skyFlowingimperfect elleptic linePARCEL OF LOVE by Harold Monro TlHAT love he had not asked forand did not wanthad hurt him by now almost beyond enduranceHe would find himself at momentsstand up and extend his bodystiffen his musclestry to stretch himself into the space of the solitary roomThenas he wantedhe became deliciously conscious of his finger tipsIt seemed to him thatif he pressed hard enoughit might pass out there and evaporateor fly through the windowand leave him for everAlways a hopeless expedientThe normal returned directly he contracted his body againLove regained its complacent habitation of himHe ached as beforehis brain glowedrekindled and burst into flamehis heart resumed the hard volcanic beatHe was utterly possessedNo movement of limb or thoughtno change of surroundingcould free him for more than a moment or twoLong hot painnight and dayasleep or awakeone tired perpetual obsessionand no releaseHis hardest moments were those of recalling looks and wordsHe scarcely ever loved that occupation nowyet could not stopNormal life had become entirely automatic for monthsHe felt there could be nothing outwardly unusual about himhe still performed the customary routine correctly though without conscious attentionHe kissed his wife without difficultycalled herdarlingat appropriate momentssigned her chequespaid a complimentwent to church with hereven made occasional straight forward love to her all quite naturallyHow could it possibly matterin view of this other thingwhat he might doNo ordinary actions or conventions could concern himSo long as it would not pass out of him through hisfinger tipsor any other wayhe remained possessedand untouched by those other ordinary events or customs of livingAlmost every scheme for ridding himself of it came into his headHe was not even afraid of madnessthat idea hardly occurred to himrather he was faced night and day by grim staring sanityHis normal activitiesof coursehe was obliged to neglectPastimes were no help why read for instanceseeing that every sentence vanished from his memory before his mind could absorb itThose quiet other eyes stared into the sockets of his ownthe long smooth beloved hands folded themselves round his brainOne or two words of the last meeting their tonetheir hundred meanings would ring like chimes all through the long interval of waiting for the nextThe hours everlastingly beat timewhile those infrequent swift moments of proximity always marched out instantly then the hours beat time againHe remembered no clear entrance to his present statehe could imagine no exitSo he was burning to ashesAlasthe intolerable slowness of the fireOne night earlyperhaps about midnighthe saw a piece of waste brown paper in the corner of the roomAt first it was scarcely a definite object to himthough his eyes kept returning to it unconsciously perhapsafterwards howevercertainly with designLater he moved over to it picked it upspread it on the floorthoughtfully fetched a piece of stringspread that across the paperthen sat down and deliberatedEventually a definite plan took hold of himHe set about it with the conviction of one who has at last solved a life problemHowpreciselyit was to be accomplished he had no occasion to askhe knew only that now he was to be freethat was enoughSo he wrapped up the neat parceltied it securely with the good stringsealed it in four places with that good seal of the family crestThere love lay in waste papera parcel 10by 6 There he stooda whole mansane and ready for the sweet ordinary life he had so disastrously neglectedTo morrow but first the work must be finishedHe almost laughed but Firstto the task he thoughtIt was a stiff three miles over the fields towards dawn into a strong windThe wind would be strong of courseHe heard the canal unnaturally long before he reached itHe wanted now so much to finish quicklythat he started running in little spurts before he was half wayAnd toward the end he was running quite hardpantinghis tongue slightly outleaning forwardburning with eagerness for freedomWould it sinkDoes love sink in a canalA vision came to him for a moment of it floating with the windbeing foundat mid day dinner perhapsby some bargefished up with a boat hookexaminedand passed round amid laughterIt must sinkIt must be weightedHe stumbled over a rut and fellrose covered with soft mudand ran forward pantingHe was heavier now by the moist earth that clung to himHe must fasten some weight to itThe canal gleamed under the windAt last the moment had comeWhy had he not discovered this way beforeHe held it in both handstwisted his fingers through the stringfastened himself tight to itand ran for the final throwWaters remarks very little on such mattersIt is troubled by no acute self consciousnessIt just opensforms some mathematical ringsclosesand very oftenbe the secret not dragged from itis silent for everSo the parcel of love was thrown in well weightedone little sigh ended the tedious affairBy good luck even the coroner was not allowed his usual commentsNothing matters very much afterwards A NEW TESTAMENT by Sherwood Anderson Testament Two THE fancy comes to me that thoughts like layers of smoke are lying along the street through which I have been wolkingThere are always banks of smoke hanging in the streets of ChicagoThere is a sensual gratification to me in the notion that the crowds of men and women whohave just passed me and who have gone before me have also lost themselves in the thoughts I have been lost inBy indirection I have beeli making love to all the men and women of a cityTo be sure there are degrees to the experience I have been unconsciously havingAll men and women are not equally susceptibleI am one who has no yesterday and grope dreamily toward a tomorrowI am like youYou are not at all the thing you have so foolishly imagined yourself to beBut I will not set myself up to define youI am nothingI believe nothingI would like to walk with youIf possible I would like to imagine you beautiful while you are in my presenceBy indirection I wish to caress youto touch with soft fingers the lids of your eyesto lie like a gem in the hollow of your handFor the moment that is the height of my desireMany people have walked before me in the streethaving as I have declared had a sort of intercourse with meAs I walk with you I will tell you of themBefore mein the forefront of my fancywent a trembling old manAhead of him was a glorious womanfull breastedstrong at the shouldersThe wind blew her skirts and I saw that her legs were shapely and strongShe did not know that I knew what she was thinking aboutAt the risk of being impertinent I will remind you again that this is an experience I have not hadWhen we are better acquainted I will quitharping on my insanitymy love of God and the other traits of my characterBefore the old man and the strong beautiful woman went many others in the canyon of the streetThey walked like myself under the smoke pall of Chicago and like myself they walked in and out of the layers of thoughtThey were all like myself fanciful folkThey were making each of them designs in the darknessIn the dark street they felt for the threads of life with the fingers of their handsHow very many people going in and out of the thoughtsI fancied that I found a blanka vacant placeSome brash impertinence out of my conscious life made me want to attempt to fill the blank I will put in this blank place a thoughta thought of my own I saidIt will be passed through by menwomen and childrenI crept into a doorway and watchedhoping childishly that the whole rhythm of the universe would be changed by my actNothing happened of courseI suspect because my act was more than half consciousMy thought had no strength of its ownThe wind blew it awayThe streets of Chicago are roaring whirling placesShrill human cries run like brightly colored threads though the thoughts of every man and woman who walks abroadIt is very foolish to try to be definite as I was as I attempted to lay down the thoughtNothing is to be achieved by being smart and definiteand to be vague they keep telling me is to be insanea little unbalancedIn a plow factoryon the West Side in Chicagothere are great tanks in the floorThe tanks are kept filled with many colored liquidsBy machinery plows are lifted from the factory floor and swung above the tanksThey are dipped and become instantly and completely blackredbrownpurplebluegreypinkCan a plow be pinkI have the trick of thinking too rapidly in colorI cannot remember the color of the eyes of my sisterThe color of the cheeks of my mistress I cannot rememberAn endless clanking goes on in my headIt is the machinery of the life in which I hang suspendedI and all the men and women in the streets are at this moment being dipped anew in the life of ChicagoThere is no yesterday for any of usWe hang by a hook in the presentWhatever lies behind this second of conscious time is a lie and I have set myself to lie to the limitBy my lying and by that road only will I succeed in expressing something of the truth of the life into which I also have been flungThis is evidently trueHows may not be pink but the prevailing color of the flesh of people is pinkWe have all been dipped in a dawn Had I not been betrayed by my egotism into trying to fill the blank space in the thought layers in the street my whole life might have been differentBut for my act I might have found in the fancy that had come to me the rhythm of my age and got fame like a great manI am instead a man of infinite littlenessa maker of wordsThe gratification to me is that I am so much like youThat is why I understand and love youI will not however attempt to become your loverThere is destruction in that and we are a long way from being fit to destroy each otherIf however we find as we go along that your insanity strikes the same chord as my own something remarkable may happen to be continuedTALES OF A HURRIED MAN by Emanuel Carnevali Tale Two Vagarde ta pitie comme ton ironie MallarmeSHE brought a dove to the houseShe had caught it in the streetas she was coming home from work It couldn t fly and I just caught it I had just come home from worktooand the dried sweat covered me like a second skinWith nostalgia for my heart my nose was sipping the evening SpringSo the dove came through the door in her hands into my lifeI took it and touched the soft grey wing of it with my dirty faceThe two dots of its eyes said nothingThe grip of its red claws was gentleand in my fingers it rested as lightly as a cloudlet of fogIf I put it on the floor it just ran awayIt ran away all the timeEvery time I attempted to go near itit just began to stagger alongfaster and fasteraway from my impending fingersWe had to feed itopen its beak and force in chunks of soaked bread and hard boiled eggIt did not like to eat and it would shake its head in quick disgustButabove allit would make dirty things all over the houseIn every cornereverywherein the morningI found green and white little thingsRosaries and constellations of themsometimes like an ornamentsometimes like a diseaseIt made us sickthe way that creature indulged in thatEven on my jacket it did itonce that I lay down to read and put it on my chest for an aesthetic accompaniment to my readingIf the window was open it would attempt a clumsily desperate flight towards itThe real lightnot the borrowed or stolen lights of the houseswas thereI supposethe airand whatever a dove eats with pleasuremother and sister and brother and real home I supposeBut we did not want to let it goWe thought we d fatten it and eat it afterwardsWe could not let it goAnd we couldn t seriously think of fattening it with the view of eating it afterwardsBecause we both hovered over the dove for long stretches of timetalking about itmaking vague suppositionsBecause we were happylooking at itseeing how the room awoke to the tingle of its clean greyPerhaps it was rather the room sinking into the mostdismal realization of its own squalid slovenlinessas the little grey note rang unconcernedly before the hardened and self important face of the immobile furnitureI was often angry to think of my emotion as I had touched the dove the first timeNot a response to my affection it had givenNot a noiseIt would only run away and twist its head extraordinarily and shudder with its neckand beak when I forced bits of hard boiled egg down its clean brown throatIf I left it alone it would puff up and burrow into its ruffled plumesAnd remain still for hoursShe did not like itbecause it made of the whole house a filthy placeBut she never really thought of killing itAnd neither did Ithough I hated itoftenwhen it tried to run awayonce it tried to make for the door as I was going out and I kicked it insideI kicked it up in the airIt flapped badly down and struck the ground with one wing spreadBut it didn t complainIt did not twist its head around to see who had done itit just ran awayTo try to explainso as to make the sadness bearableWhich meansto rebel against sadnesswhich would lead us to a splendid and terrible death The dove would not acknowledge usWe were two sad persons longing for a sweetness that had forever flown out of the reach of our heavy fingertips Damn strangers it must have thought of usDesperately soratherlitle dovedesperately and hopelessly strangersOne may not touch sweetness with hands that are sweet but but not sweet enough only coarse hands or divine hands may touch youstubborn little grey dream dreamBut I can imprison you here and you won t go awayyou must stay you can t deny that I am keeping youthat you are somewhat with meThat s where I have one on youas they saythose horrible personsI am a beggar because I was thrown out of every house in the worldbut out herewhere I amthereis only the infinite which neither gives nor asksAnd I am still beggingWhich means that I am begging of themdoes it notAhyou are a little darling cloud descendeddescended to prove to them that clouds may be held in our hands and caressedas though they were tilings of our ownof atissue alike to our fleshNoyou don t want to be caressedLong time ago there was a covenant of silence between the clouds and menThe first human word broke the covenant and now all the human words in all the books are not sufficient to piece together the covenant againDovewith your red claws like a frozen lean red flowerYour breast is so soft that human fingers might die thereDoveI am not yet beautiful because no one has come to ask of my flesh all the love that is in my fleshSo I am anchored to their streets and to the floors of their houses by the weight of sunken desiresBut I know that children will come to memy own childrenand I know that I will not caress my child with hands that are less than beautifulAnd children answer uswhereas youdoveare silentBut childrendo children answer usAs we expectedit diedShewho had gone in my room where the dove s sleeping place wasgot its box from under the table and saw it half spread wings pushed against the corner of the boxstill warmIt stayed unwillingly and it was too proud to formulate a protestSo it objected by dyinga haughty objectionperhaps an infinite objectioncertainly an irrevocable and an irrefutable Oooohcried sheShe ran to me It died you knowCome and see it I bewailed its death for a few minutesI was in dismayWe were silent for a long time afterboth of usknowing that if we should speak we d have to mention the doveI could have told her things and thingsI could have told herLet s cry nownot because we really loved itnot because it is a lossbut becauseI could have told her things and thingsBut they were things I could not tell herShe was not anything like a doveahInsteadinstead I writeherea sort of lying taleAnd I imagineherethat I spoke to the doveafter its deaththusYou diedI m so tiredthe weather is closeand I wanted to whip this damn silence away form me with some awful wordsand youyou wanted to do a sinister deed so that I

IMAGINAIRES by Mary Butts VII WELLmy dearWe ve had it outI repeatIf it had been another womanlovelierwittier than I DoloresBill s wife or some other amoureuseyou would be dead nowspitted on a daggerOr the lady would have hung herself on your door knocker leaving you to explainYou are not grateful for my moderationYetyou behaved rather wellYou were skillfulI watched you manoeuvring to reduce our affair to the terms of the harlequinadeWhen you explained that you were not worthy of my least regardI grasped the setting and gave you your ColumbineWhat did it amount toThat I who had brought you peacehad become the devourer of peaceThere was no greed of which you might accuse mebut you made your case against a vitality which might destroy It is my deepest opinion that a philosopher must avoid loveI cannot though I have wished to recognize your life of intuitions corrected by intelligenceIt interferes with pure mentality And thendearI have wanted to I wish that I were differentBut I mean to draw back before I hurt you any moreIt is intolerably disagreeable to see you suffer Your eyes pleaded for my departureI stood before your mirrorcolouring my mouthIn that glass I saw your magical presentment In it was mirrored the boy scientisttheVarsity philosopherthe emotional adolescentHeaven s hound called herself offI left Sohoand youand the tragic eyed woman I passed on the stairsI was almost at peaceon the edge of contemplationI did not cry when I reached homeI am become a dawn catpattering back with torn ears and furA month ago there seemed no beauty my body could not

Bird would sayIt s all right Louis you are not my loverYou are a boy and have sharpened your senses on the scent of my skinand the colour of my hairAs a lover you are nothingBut the truth of your presentment doesnot lie thereI ve found itThis also is trueHerein lies your originalityMost minds in the world are cheapsterilein sincereThey impart their stale flavour to the whole But I have tasted your mind s fruitfulness and passion like salt and fine breadThere is your wayyour truth and your lifeAnd I have lived with youVIII To day we met almost as strangersWe both wished to resolve our affair into formal acquaintanceWe finished a bottle of BurgandyOld Porfirio who had watched this and other of our affairs was pleased to see usHe had noticed that M sieu came no longer with the tall MademoiselleThere is a gentleman tucked away behind that round stomachDo you realize that he is not licensed to sell liqueursWe walked down Drury Lane greasy with banana skins and you held my arm and spoke of Anne thatwafer made out of the blood of Christ I could not point out the ritual error while you were telling me of her trustexplaining that her confidence appalled while it elated youO sacred naiveteHas it never occurred to you that I have behaved to you in exactly the same wayThat s as may beI could have sneered till I looked up and saw your faceYou might have been a flame enclosed in

Drury Lane KlovanchinaI do not understand the full implication of that musicexcept that it united us for a momentto separate usI thinkforeverWhen we came out the Great Bear trailed over Covent Gardenand the empty pavement rangand the stars leapt in the bitter skyThe music had ravished and troubled mebut your cold elation gave me the fear of an animal that knows it is to be beaten Its all

adventureWithdrawalstillnessimmaculate contemplation there is escape with victoryIsn t that better than your daring and your temperance We came to your doorwent upstairs without speakingYou did a

vaguely impress meyour economics with which I do not agreeYou can put them away and bank on the ultimate bankruptcy of all cognition and passionI love youI adore your quality I m too proud to fightVaryaIXHow am I fallen from myselfFor a long time now I have not seen the Prince of Chang in my dreamsTo day I went out on the word of a lying map to look for hut circles and kist vaens in the mistI believed also that there would be ghosts on the moorI found those I had brought with mewaiting me thereThe mist filtereddown and covered the worldI wandered over those saggy uplandsand listened to the silence made audible by running water and the odd settling noises of the bogIt was not the stone age that pressed round mebut my metropolitan ghostsI found them translated in that iron land whose focus is a prison and a house of tortureThe images that haunt me the horror in Valentinethe shadow of the warthe starvation of the human spiritthe thwarting of creationthe power whose symbol we call cruelty rose out of the moorghastly familiarWhenthe sun strikes it after rain it is the colour of raw fleshFind me the greatest common measure of these thingsX You asked me once what can I give you that other men cannotMy intelligence perhaps but not my personor my wealth I am hardly a sexual athlete And then the demure smileand the stroke of the moustacheDear foolAm I to accuse you of idealising meDon t you know that there is a sensuality in me no one has ever satisfiedI m tired of echoing As pasia and Egeriabut with you I ve been romp and amoureuseshared theardors demi virginalof the Kirchner GirlWe ve had the profundity of infinite lightnessWith you I ve danced my solo in that equivocal ballet of the worldXI Prince of Chang I think of your pale face a d high cheek bonesyour narrow brilliant eyesand you seem to me remote as that Prince You might be an enamelled Lordand I once an em broidered ladytwo pieces of decor in an age and city remote as AtlantisI have now been a week on these moors Great London where the sights are And the lights are And the nights are The memory of our affair is not deadbut it has become a magical objet d art like some awful tale of India or Japan where the raw blood beats through porcelain and cloisonne and jadeWhat has Ivan made of thisNothingI haven t told himI m learning to offer myself in installmentsBesides it won t make a tale yetand to cry the raw pain aloud would not be fairIt is not his dance or his crucifixionIt is hardly his businessBut I cannot give him what I wouldI ve been too starvedThere are better waysAll the time the moor watches meand the granite hillsThe cold streams hiss between the bouldersthe mist is soft as thistle down and cold as deathThere are better ways than this acceptance of mutilationWe are creatures in time Ivan and IYears have knit usof love and adventureHe is my temporal stabilityBut we three togetherComplaints are many and various And my feet are cold said Aquarius There is your side to this taleand I perhaps be none than a green sick girlThe moor is destroying meHere nature and the Beast Sologub s beast are oneThe moor is a repetition of the warThe town is a microcosm of the moorstripped of its grotesque beautyI am a tiny seed in such a millThere are better waysWhen he and I first sat by the fireI remembered youPrince of ChangThere is a pas de trois in lovetwo cannot danceAnother way of saying that I don t see why I should not have you bothThe result of the frustration is that I am boredI sit heresuck ing smoke up a tortoishell tubeThe taste of you burns my mem ory like the vile cigarettes of this abominable placeXII Dear BrutusI am in town again with more humour than when I left itAt least I watch the completion of our cycle without further illusionIt is like thisSince Sion has gone back into her captivityshe will drink freely of the waters of BabylonMy dear you don t konw women who can stand this can stand anythingI do not know what absolute value it may havebut I remember the night when the thread was cut that tied me to temporal needsI have lived in a world become translucentBut I cannot gauge the quality of the illumination beyondMy feet have been lighter on the streets than on the day you said that you loved meThen I strode through them part of the combers of the wind and the hurrying starsMy bird had left the bush and dropped into my handsNow there is neither bush nor bird but a stillness like sea fogI am relaxedpassiveThen I remember For God s sake don t stop loving meIhave everything to learnMake my world newand thenyou have come in timeonly just in time and the tears force themselves out of my eyesseparate as stonesand each a microcosm of my disappointmentBut the worst you ve done is not theseAll that I might have writtenall that I might have perceivedthe adventure I saw and have not accomplished these I pan present youYou begot themYou aborted themNow I am barrenThat s the worst you ve doneLast night in your roomsI could not but laughYou were so glad to think that youhad steered your canoe safe back to interested acquaintance once moreDear Brutusthere was nothing to forgiveVaryaXIII Faint white worldI stand at my doorThere is snow on every plane of the street and over them a mist an ice gauzeThere is nothing moreI can live without you and without any manYesbe sorry for your childishness and dance again and run about the worldNothing moreNot for youThe air is an unshaken silver netIt hangs in suspense outside of timeSo with meRemember the last Act ofKlovanchina I do not know whether I am alive or deadbut that there is another state through the antithesis of life a deathThere is a cloister for passionYou by denyingI by acceptance have come to the same placeBut there are no final vowsO

been long ago and she had been to church with him and they had come back confessed before all the world there would not have been in his voice the angry reproachful anticipation of her stupidityit was as if she had said his sayings herselfPerhaps he had really suddenly thought downstairs that it would be nice to go to churchnot knowing that that was one of the effects of falling in love just thinking in the course of his worldy studies that there was church and he was in himselfa church goer and ought to go more often and coming up to borrow a prayer book from the BaileysNoSuddenly in the

his whereabouts he stated that he was now on the path of pralaya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levelsIn reply to a question as to his first sensations beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic developmentopened up to

Pound In the derivation of nouns from verbsthe Chinese language is forestalled by the AryanAlmost all the Sanskrit rootswhich seem to underlie European languagesare primitive verbswhich express characteristic actions of visible natureThe verb must be the primary fact of naturesince motion and change are all that we can recognize in herIn the primitive transitive sentencesuch asFarmer pounds rice the agent and the object are nouns only in so far as they limit a unit of action Farmerandriceare mere hard terms which define the extremes of the poundingBut in themselvesapart from this sentence functionthey are naturally verbsThe farmer is one who tills the groundand the rice is a plant which grows in a special way This is indicated in the Chinese charactersAnd this probably exemplifies the ordinary derivation of nouns from verbsIn all languagesChinese includeda noun is originallythat which does something that which performs the verbal actionThus the moon comes from the root maand meansthe measurer The sun means that which begetsThe derivation of adjectives from the verb need hardly be exemplifiedEven with usto daywe can still watch participles passing over into adjectivesIn Japanese the adjective is frankly part of the inflection of the verba special moodso that every verb is also an adjectiveThis brings us close to naturebecause everywhere the quality is only a power of action regarded as having an abstract inherenceGreen is only a certain rapidity of vibrationhardness a degree of tenseness in coheringIn Chinese the adjective always retains a substratum of verbal meaningWe should try to render this in translationnot be content with some bloodless adjectival abstraction plusis Still more interesting are the Chineseprepositions they are often post positionsPrepositions are so importantso pivotal in European Owing to the initiation of printersproof readers etc we find that an illustrationunderFarmer pounds rice which was not to have appeared until later was inserted in last month s instalment of ProfFenollosa s essayThe illustration has nothing to do with pounding riceit refers to the sun s rising in the eastspeech only because we have weakly yielded up the force of our intransitive verbsWe have to add small supernumerary words to bring back the original powerWe still sayI see a horse but with the weak verblook we have to add the directive particleatbefore we can restore the natural transitiveness Prepositions represent a few srmple waysin which incomplete verbs complete themselvesPointing toward nouns as a limit they bring force to bear upon hemThat is to saythey are naturally verbsof generalized or condensed useIn Aryan languages it is often difficult to trace the verbal origins of simple prepositionsOnly inoffdo we see a fragment of the thoughtto throw off In Chinese the preposition is frankly a verbspecially used in a generalized senseThese verbs are often used in their specially verbal senseand it greatly weakens an English translation if they are systematically rendered by colorless prepositionsThus in ChineseBy to causeto to fall towardin to remainto dwellfrom to followand so onConjunctions are similarly derivativethey usually serve to mediate actions between verbsand therefore they are necessarily themselves actionsThus in ChineseBecausei to useand to be included under oneanother form ofandto be parallelor to partakeif to let one doto permitThe same is true of a host of other particlesno longer traceable in the Aryan tonguesPronouns appear a thorn in our evolution theorysince they have been taken as unanalyzable expressions of personalityIn Chinese even they yield up their striking secrets of verbal metaphorThey are a constant source of weakness if colorlessly translatedTakefor examplethe five forms ofI There is the sign of aspear in the handa very emphatic Ifive and a mouth a weak and defensive Iholding off a crowd by speakingto concealz a selfish and private Iselfthe cocoon signand a mouth an egoistic Ione who takes pleasure in his own speakingthe self presented is used only when one is speaking to one s selfI trust that this digression concerning parts of speech may have justified itselfIt provesfirstthe enormous interest of the Chinese language in throwing light upon our forgotten mental processesand thus furnishes a new chapter in the philosophy of languageSecondlyit is This is a bad exampleW c can sayI look a foollook transitivenow means resembleThe main contention is however correctWe tend to abandon specific words likeresembleand substitutefor themvague verbs with prepositional directorsor ridersEP indispensable for understanding the poetical raw material which the Chinese language affordsPoetry differs from prose in ithe concrete colors of its dictionIt is not enough for it to furnish a meaning to philosophersIt must appeal to emotions with the charm of direct impressionflashing through regions where the intellect can only grope Poetry must render what is saidnot what is merely meantAbstract meaning gives little vividnessand fullness of imagination gives allChinese poetry demands that we abandon our narrow grammatical categoriesthat we follow the original text with a wealthof concrete verbsBut this is only the beginning of the matterSo far we have exhibited the Chinese characters and the Chinese sentence chiefly as vivid shorthand pictures of actions and processes in natureThese embody true poetry as far as they goSuch actions are seenbut Chinese would be a poor language and Chinese poetry but a narrow artcould they not go on to represent also what is unseenThe best poetry deals not only with natural images but with lofty thoughtsspiritual suggestions and obscure relationsThe greater part of natural truth is hidden in processes too minute for vision and in harmonies too largein vibrationscohesions and in affinitiesThe Chinese compass these alsoand with great power and beautyYou will askhow could the Chinese have built up a great intellectual fabric from mere picture writingTo the ordinary western mindwhich believes that thought is concerned with logical categories and which rather condemns the faculty of direct imaginationthis feat seems quite impossibleYet the Chinese language with its peculiar material has passed over from the seen to the unseen by exactly the same process which all ancient races employedThe process is metaphorthe use of material images to suggest immaterial relations The whole delicate substance of speech is built upon substrata of metaphorAbstract termspressed by etymologyreveal their ancient roots still embedded in direct actionBut the primative metaphors do not spring from arbitrary subjective processesThey are possible only because they follow objective lines of relations in nature herselfRelations are more real and more important than the things which theyrelateThe forces which produce the branch angles of an oak lay potent in the acornSimilar lines of resistancehalf curbing the out pressing vitalitiesgovern the branching of rivers and of nationsThus a nervea wirea roadwayand a clearing house are only varying channels which communiCfprinciple of Primary apparition Spirit of RomanceEPCompare Aristotle s PoeticsEP cations forces for itselfThis is more than analogyit is identity of structureNature furnishes her own cluesHad the world not been full of homologiessympathiesand identitiesthought would have been starved and language chained to the obviousThere would have been no bridge whereby to cross from the minor truth of the seen to the major truth of the unseenNot more than a few hundred roots out of our large vocabularies could have dealt directly with physical processesThese we can fairly well identify in primitive SanskritThey arealmost without exceptionvivid verbsThe wealth of European speech grewfollowing slowly the intricate maze of nature s suggestions and affinitiesMetaphor was piled upon metaphor in quasigeological strataMetaphorthe revealer of natureis the very substance ofpoetryThe known interprets the obscurethe universe is alive with mythThe beauty and freedom of the observed world furnish a modeland life is pregnant with artIt is a mistake to supposewith some philosophers of aestheticsthat art and poetry aim to deal with the general and the abstractThis misconception has been foisted upon us by mediaeval logicArt and poetry deal with the concrete of naturenot with rows ofseparateparticularsor such rows do not existPoetry is finer than prose because it gives ifs more concrete truth in the same compass of wordsMetaphor its chief deviceis at once the substance of nature and of languagePoetry only does consciously what the primitive races did unconsciouslyThe chief work of literary men in dealing with languageand of poets especiallylies in feeling back along the ancient lines of advancef He must do this so that he may keep his words enriched by all their subtle understones of meaningThe original metaphors stand as a kind of luminous backgroundgiving color and vitalityforcing them closer to the concreteness of natural processesShakespeare everywhere teems with examplesFor these reasons poetry was the earliest of the world artspoetrylanguage and the care of myth grew vip togetherI have alleged all this because it enables me to show clearly why I believe that the Chinese written language has not only absorbed the poetic substance of nature and built with it a second world of metaphorbut hasthrough its very pictorial visibilitybeen able to retain its original Vide also an article onVorticismin the Fortnightly Review for September1914 The language of exploration EP t would submit in all humility that this applies in the rendering of ancient textsThe poet in dealing with his own timemust also see to it that language dots not petrify on his handsHe must prepare for nexv advances along the lines of true metaphor that is interpretive metaphoror imageas diametrically opposed to untrueor ornamental metaphor EPcreative poetry with far more vigor and vividness than any phonetic tongueLet us first see how near it is to the heart of nature in its metaphorsWe can watch it passing from the seen to the unseenas we saw it passing from verb to pronounIt retains the primitive sapit is not cut and dried like a walking stickWe have been told that these people are coldpracticalmechanicalliteraland without a trace of imaginative geniusThat is nonsenseOur ancestors built the accumulations of metaphor into structures of language and into systems of thoughtLanguages to day are thin and cold because we think less and less into themWe are forcedfor the sake of quickness and sharpnessto file down each word to its narrowest edge of meaningNature would seem to have become less like a paradise and more and more like a factoryWe are content to accept the vulgar misuse of the momentA late stage of decay is arrested and embalmed in the dictionaryOnly scholars and poets feel painfully back along the thread of our etymologies and piece together our dictionas best they mayfrom forgotten fragmentsThis anemia of modern speech is only too well encouraged by the feeble cohesive force of our phonetic symbolsThere is little or nothing in a phonetic word to exhibit the embryonic stages of its growthIt does not bear is metaphor on its faceWe forget that personality once meantnot the soulbut the soul s maskThis is the sort of thing one can not possibly forget in using the Chinese symbolsIn this Chinese shows its advantageIts etymology is constantly visibleIt retains the creative impulse and processvisible and at workAfter thousands of years the lines of metaphoric advance are still shownand in many cases actually retained in the meaningThus a wordinstead of growing gradually poorer and poorer as with usbecomes richer and still more rich from age to agealmost consciously luminousIts uses in national philosophy and historyin biography and in poetrythrow about it a nimbus of meaningsThese center abut the graphic symbolThe memory can hold them and use themThe very soil of Chinese life seems entangled in the roots of its speechThe manifold illustrations which crowd its annals of personal experiencethe lines of tendency which converge upon a tragic climaxmoral character as the very core of the principleall these are flashed at once on the mind as reinforcing values with an accumulation of meaning which a phonetic language can hardly hope to attainTheir ideographs are like blood stained battle flags to an old campaignerWith usthe poet is the only one for whom the accumulated treasures of the race words are real and activePoetic language is always vibrant with fold on fold of overtonesand with natural affinitiesbut in Chinese the visibility of the metaphor tends to raise this quality to its intensest powerI have mentioned the tyranny of mediaeval logicAccording to this European logic thought is a kind of brickyardIt is baked into little hard units or conceptsThese are piled in rows according to size and then labeled with words for future useThis use consists in picking out a few brickseach by its convenient labeland sticking them together into a sort of wall called a sentence by the use either of White mortar for the positive copulais or black mortar for the negative copulais not In this way we produce such admirable propositions asA ring tailed baboon is not a constitutional assembly Let us consider a row of cherry treesFrom each of these in turn we proceed to take anabstract as the phrase isa certain common lump of qualities which we may express together by the name cherry or cherry nessNext we place in a second table several such characteristic conceptscherryrosesunsetiron rustflamingoFrom these we abstract some further common qualitydilutation or mediocrityand label itredorredness It is evident that this process of abstraction may be carried on indefinitely and with all sorts of materialWe may go on forever building pyramids of attenuated concept until we reach the apexbeing But we have done enough to illustrate the characeristic processAt the base of the pyramid lie thingsbut stunnedas it wereThey can never know themselves for things until they pass up and down among the layers of the pyramidsThe way of passing up anddown the pyramid may be exemplified as followsWe take a concept of lower attenuationsuch ascherry we see that it is contained under one highersuch asredness Then we are permitted to say in sentence form Cherryness is contained under redness or for shortthecherry is red Ifon the other handwe do not find our chosen subject under a given predicate we use the black copula and sayforexampleThecherry is not liquid From this point we might go on to the theory of the syllogismbut we refrainIt is enough to note that the practised logician finds it convenient to store his mind with long lists of nouns and adjectivesfor these are naturally the names of classesMost text books on language begin with such listsThe study of verbs is meagerfor in such a system there is only one real working verbto witthe quasi verbis All other verbs can be transformed into participles and gerundsFor example to runpractically becomes a case ofrunning Instead of thinking directly The man runs our logician makes two subjective equationsnamelyThe individual in question is contained under the classman and the classmanis contained under the class ofrunning thingsTo be continued A Projection at Kensington London Wby Maxwell

this day are too nakedly egoistic to seriously quarrel with each other We have returned to a stoical naiveteEzra Pound I quarreled with the pompous laziness of my timeFirst Poet It wounded youmore frequently than you dared to admit and you struck back with an anger that sought to escape its own futilityYou wanted the sleep of deep rage calmness held an inner alertness which terrified youSecond Poet In your time men split their lives into a prodigious welter of clothescreedsmurdersfrenzies and ornamentsThey tried to escape from their inner samenessthey caressed and insulted each other with an infinite variety of gesturesThe wise man cringed underneath his glimpse of the monotone and brilliantly stoned it with wordsthe fool cowered beneath his heavy unrest and shoutedand he who was neither wise nor foolish made himself blind with a creed and felt an inward ache which he could not understandEzra Pound Your generalities are ingenious and ingenuousbut they lack that profound simplicity which astounds the mind into acquiescenceIn my time men had a passion for persuading themselves that they were like each otherthat they could jog along in orderly fashionwarmed by similar longingsNations were perpetuated upon this fallacypeople were constantly chasing certain men in and out of power in the hope of finding those men who would most adequately symbolize this imaginary compositeIn my own realm I and a few others tried to fight against this delusion of sameness which was petrifying poetry and other artsWe lugged in thousands of actual contradictionsperversionsdistortions and complexitieswe saw no fusion in human beings outside of a certain elusive animal backgroundIn the ardor of our task we often fell back upon a pretended hatred for our surroundings but that hatred wasin realitya genial relaxation to us a caper cut after workUsually we were genuinely immersed in our job of splitting up an unseen realityFirst Poet You fled from self weariness and the threatening shadow of this weariness constantly goaded you into frantic escapesYou ran down the road in a brilliantly helter skelter fashion but all of your civilisation was running beside youseeking to evade the same nightmareThey fled clumsily and unconsciously you escaped gracefully and deliberatelyYour nations were based upon this escape fiom samenessmen considered themselves distinctly different individuals deliberately submitting to the benign disciplne of law and government in order to curb their wild and imaginary differencesEach man felt the pleasant after glow that comes to a giant who indulgently stoops to the dwarfs beside himEven your criminals soughtfor the most partto attain individuality through an easily purchased defianceVanity was a repressed scream in your ageand it invisibly gathered until it exploded and your civilization was blown to bitsEzra Pound Is vanity miraculously absent from the present ageSecond Poet NoBut the orgy of rapacious vanity which followedfor centuriesthe collapse of your civilization has left our vanity a bit satiatedWe are amazingly tired of slayingpunishing and robbing each otherThe most romantic idealist of your own age would never have dared to prophecy our conditionBefore and during your time avarice and rapacity never adopted a sustainedly naked postureStarting with nakednessthey gradually assumed a mask of increasing cleverness and this mask always culmlinated in the devilishly elaborate one of some civilizationBut after the collapse of your civilization the last one men plunged into several centuries of unveiledmurderous chaosSo vanity and its helping shades are now thoroughly exhaustedCertain men in our agewe call themwild womeninsist that vanity will once more rise and make us roaring childrenBut that is merely a lure for conjectureWe that are left there are only millions of us nownot billions have fallen into searching reposeWe are once more stepping down the beginning of the roadfilled with a night that is determined to stride on until it loses itself in some new dawnWhat this dawn will be we do not knowwe play with the oldknown things and waitOur literature and art have become a bewilderedly gentle juggling of shades of colorsodds and ends of emotionsand peaceful satiresWe have no intense creeds to whip us onwe do not call each other fools or wise men we take and discard our interests more naturallyWe have changed to what men in your time would have called effeminate driftersOur vices are sly and softly indirect and have become too unrobust to affect any dominance over usWe have altered to childrensulky and harmlessly haughty at worst and gracefully gay at best our vices are not worse than those which certain shrewishpetulant women of your age must have hadOur collective egoismbruised and stunted by centuries of frank indulgenceis wearily questioning its own validityWe represent an age where those qualities hitherto known as human fundamentals are beginning to querulously totteran age of indecisionWe have no broad religions or philosphies in which we can hide and satisfy our questionsWe are separated into patiently doubting groupswe are tired of the old lies but we have found no new ones sufficiently enticing to lure huge numbers of us into their shelterEzra Pound This is a logical endingThe screaming whirlpool
