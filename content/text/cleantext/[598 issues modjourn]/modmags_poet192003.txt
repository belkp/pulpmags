most generous supporters  A guarantor of POETRY who was also a distinguished connoisseur of  the other arts was Mr Charles S Freer of Detroit who dying last  September enriched the people of the United States with his priceless  collection of oriental and occidental masterpieces to be housed in the  gallery now building in Washington  We deeply regret to record also the death on February third at his  winter home in California of Mr E P Ripley for many years president  of the Santa Fe Railroad who has supported POETRY generously from the  beginning   CONTENTS OF VOLUME XV  Austin Mary

clouded with smoke Great human thing beautiful with ugliness Gripping our hearts because you are big and clumsy and  kind Going with dream misted eyes Tenderly you take our love with welcome Coarse and strong and friendly   ENCOUNTER  I held a violet in my hand In the midst of the city And could not understand My own pity Now was face to face Littleness with the immensity of towers Strength was looking at grace The city sighing for lost woodland hours  AUTOMOBILES ON SUNDAY  Down the blue road into the sun The great cars run Down the road s curve They swerve And their glasses shine white In the sudden light As they turn And the brasses of their lamps and rods burn  With an inner turning An inner sound of turning and churning With a whir and a purr purr With a great hum They come And they shake their shadows at their side Their shadows square and wide   Helen Hoyt  Slipping over the road Now hastening now slowed Hanging to their wheels half askew Purple and black on the road s oiled blue  Some with the soft swish of a lady s train Pass quietly with sleek disdain Enameled glistening and neat Moving by on dainty feet Every whirling wheel Steadfast and genteel  Now a broad bulging lounging fellow Painted bright in black and yellow Wobbling under his merry weight And now one comes with terrible lumbering gait And one rushes by Straight as a bird through the sky In the sun  Shining progression Ceaseless procession procession Splendor goes striding by Beauty goes sliding by In the sun in the sun  BY THE LAKE  Wash from me all my weariness waters Wash from me all my thoughts and purposes   Wash from me all my desires and dreams and hopes And drown them in your old monotony  Oh take me from myself and let me lose myself Let this incessant churning against the rocks This clumping clumping clumping of the water Wash over my brain and wash my brain away  Till I am left at last empty of all that I was All that I knew or was or wished to be Left empty and content and uncontending Languorous and numbed and lulled asleep  NIGHT  The room seems hushed and apart A piece out of the night Something stirs in my heart That never comes in the light  Thought of the earth of how old And how large it lies in the dark And through the darkness is rolled Vastness empty stark  Terrible and unreal Wide about where I lie Is this how children feel When the dark makes them cry   Helen Hoyt  THE STONE AGE SEA  Never has ship sailed on that sea Nor ray of tower shone on it Motionless without desire or memory Like a great languorous sea of stone it lies And as these ledges of rock on which they sit So stony so unseeing are the eyes Of this strange folk who from the naked shore Look ever beyond them to the aged face Of the waters One with the hoar Mighty boulders they seem one with the deep These the first beings of the first rude race Of time Their hearts are still locked asleep So lately from the gray marble were they torn And all the multitudes of the world are yet unborn  WHEN WE ARE ASLEEP  When we are asleep at rest and asleep Where do our thoughts and wishes keep Where is memory s dreaming bed And where does love lay down her head And hope and happiness and sorrow Where do they go until tomorrow Do they sleep do they rest  Crowding knowledge close compressed In the many folded brain   What ghostly bound what exquisite chain Holds you and binds you in till day Binds you fast lest you drift away  CREATOR  I remember well a certain poem The glory as it was born After long travail the glory As I carved into their places Those little last words that made it done  I waved the writing over my head like a flag I read it and read it again chanting Walking under trees chanting it to the sky  The sound it made in my ears was beautiful And it made delicious smooth movements in my mouth Made my feet dance  I cried aloud in delight I said It is good It is very good The joy beat in my side fast Beat in my throat There were tears in my throat So that I could hardly behold where I walked So that I seemed taller than the trees My head was so proud   Know by these lines that she whose bones rest here Was once a poet To her were very dear All lovely words and syllables and with delight She wove them into songs Oh many a night She lay with waking eyes dreaming them in the dark Of her high city room or in the dim park Danced them beside the lake hearing the waves beat Hearing far off the noise of the city the loud street But now she lies in this place where the quiet dead have  home Where rhythms of wave and words and dancing never come  THERE WAS A TIME  There was a time destruction hovered its wings over my  head Poverty walked at my back At the one side of me loneliness at the other side longing But never have my feet gone so eagerly in the ways of my  life as in those days And the memories of those days are pleasant to me  Helen Hoyt   INTROSPECTION  That house across the road is full of ghosts The windows all inquisitive look inward All are shut I ve never seen a body in the house Have you Have you Yet feet go sounding in the corridors And up and down and up and down the stairs All day all night all day  When will the show begin When will the host be in What is the preparation for When will he open the bolted door When will the minutes move smoothly along in their hours Time answer  Can you see a feverish face Pressing at the window pane  The air must be hot how hot inside If only somebody could go And snap the windows open wide And keep them so  All the back rooms are very large and there So it is said They sit before their open books and stare Or one will rise and sadly shake his head   Harold Monro  Another will comb out her languid hair While some will move untiringly about Through all the rooms for ever in and out Or up and down the stair  Or gaze into the desolate back garden And talk about the rain Then drift back from the window to the table Folding long hands to sit and think again  They can never meet like homely people Round a fireside After daily work Always busy with procrastination Backward and forward they move in the house Full of their questions No one can answer Nothing will happen Nothing will happen   CITY STORM  The heavy sounds are over sweet That droop above the hooded street At any moment ripe to fall and lie And when that wind will swagger up the town They ll bend a moment then will fly All clattering down   Troops come and go of urchin breeze They flick your face or smack the trees Then round the corner spin and leap With whistling cries Rake their rubbish in a heap And throw it in your eyes  Much preparation of the earth and air Is needed everywhere Before that first large drop of rain can fall  Smells of the sea or inland grass Come staring through the town and pass Brilliant old Memories drive in state Along the way but cannot wait And many a large unusual bird Hovers across the sky half heard  But listen It is He At last he comes Gigantic tyrant panting through the street Slamming the windows of our little homes Banging the doors knocking the chimneys down Oh his loud tramp how scornfully he can meet Great citizens and lash them with his sleet Everything will be altered in our town  He ll wipe the film of habit clean away While he remains   Harold Monro His cloak is over everything we do And the whole town complains A sombre scroll An inner room A crystal bowl Waters of gloom Oh the darkened house Into silence creep The world is cold The people weep Harold Monro  MARCH  Such mournful twilights beaded with the rain Blurred sunsets and the wild wet dawns A pale moon rocked in a tempestuous sky Gray hours like driven ghosts drift by To a gray doom And over all I hear God s age old laughter down the wind  Ruth Loomis Skeen   AFTER RACHMANINOFF  Like rain that silvers out of a silent sky So hard you said And I sent back my heart in a vain try To hold below your voice Some remnant memory of strange songs he played  These moments never quite return Not through all the years I ll count and spend Or light tapers to old gods and watch them burn  Like granite feet You laughed and then came back Both light and strong A tracery of rock on rock  The moment opened wide and let me in I looked behind As a man who plays with sin Knowing what it was I sought The variation he could never play That from his fingered keys would always stray Uncaught  You seemed held deep In thought  I lied to that confession s cheap A lie s a compliment And found myself wondering where to heap   New devotions that would keep Your eyes in mine In this strange experiment  We were in a net Of other people s words They crossed us there like swords At last I tipped my hat And felt your tension drop Hearts stop perhaps Like that  No doubt you will forget The evening when we remet For you a door had edged and closed Upon a stranger awkwardly disposed When I went out  For me the days will live it through each time In a kind of troubled rhyme When concert whispers rise and fall And other Russian preludes run Up chromatic scales and down Repelled by chatter and in vain I ll watch the faces for a sign As when I held out hands and cried And of all the souls that faced my way Only yours replied  Ralph Block   SEA EDGE SONGS  THE ENCHANTED TOAD  Three times you had neared I unaware My body warm in the sand and bare Three times you had hopped your silent track To the arch of shadow under my back And each time when I had felt you cool And turned on you and like a fool Prodded your exit from my place Sorrow deepened in your face You were loth to leave me though I threw Handfuls of sand to quicken you You would look as you went and blink your eyes And puff your pale throat with surprise Three times you had tried like someone daft Till I thought too late that evil craft Had altered into what you were Some old Chinese philosopher Had warted you dank and thwarted you dumb And that given just three times to come And beg a poet to set you free You had put all your faith in me  THE SAND PIPER  Along the sea edge like a gnome Or rolling pebble in the foam   As though he timed the ocean s throbbing Runs a piper bobbing bobbing  How he stiffens how he wilts Like a little boy on stilts Creatures burrow insects hide When they see the piper glide  You would think him out of joint Till his bill begins to point You would doubt if he could fly Till his straightness arrows by  You would take him for a clown Till he peeps and flutters down Vigilant among the grasses Where a fledgling bobs and passes  GRASS TOPS  What bird are you in the grass tops Your poise is enough of an answer With your wing tips like up curving fingers Of the slow moving hands of a dancer  And what is so nameless as beauty Which poets who give it a name Are only unnaming forever Content though it go that it came  Witter Bynner   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IMAGES VAINES  Des visages sur moi se penchent Dans la solitude ou tintent les lointains Des douceurs de mains blanches Se posent sur mes mains  Neige du Souvenir rosée des sens Brume filigranée où murmurent les formes Apaisement bleu où s endorment Les désirs renaissants Entrevus en un soir de bonheur impossible  Des visages parfois se penchent Sur mes mains blanches Des mains parfois effleurent mon visage Toute une foule est dans ma vie Comme un mirage  Je ne sais que cela Des visages dont j ai recueilli la tendresse Je ne sais quand en quel endroit Ni pourquoi Se penchent sur mon visage  Et la caresse dont je meure Mes yeux libres de pleurs Mon corps blessé comme une cible C est le vain frôlement des regards impossibles  Jean Catel   THE MOTHER  Now I am like the earth I can give food And you my little one look to me only We are so little separate you and I Still your growth comes of me And my strength makes you strong Now I am like the earth 1 can give birth to flowers and nourish them  II  Happy the house That goes a tiptoe when the evening comes And says Hush hush He sleeps Happy the house that may not lie too long Of mornings Little cries of hunger or of laughter Wakening it Imperious fingers pushing up its eyes That house is living There is moving in it The green sap of the world  Nancy Campbell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SEA GULLS  On Leaving Eggemoggin  Sea gulls I saw lifting the dawn with rosy feet Bearing the sunlight on their wings Dripping the dusk from burnished plumes And I thought It would be joy to be a sea gull At dusk at dawn of day And through long sunlit hours  Sea gulls I saw carrying the night upon their backs Wide tail spread crescent for the moon and stars The moon a glowing jelly fish The stars foam flecks of light And I thought It would be joy to be a sea gull  How I would dart with them Strike storm with coral spur Rip whirling spray of angry tides Snatch mangled light shot offal of the sea Torn tossed and moving terribly And stare for stare answer those myriad eyes That float and sway stab sting and die away  How I would peer from wide cold eyes of fire At dusk at dawn And through the long daylight   Into those coiling depths of sea  Then split the sun the moon the stars With laughter laughter laughter For the sea s mad power  ROSY MILLER  I do not ever remember having seen Rosy Miller I never met her Yet lose her I never can It was the speech of a friend that made her live for me Rosy Miller who gave and gave Who a child still had learned the whole meaning of life Who asked nothing Who never held a hand out mendicant to others  One night at dusk she came down a hill with me That was three years ago that hour at dusk And now they say she is dead But that is a mistake Even for me who never knew her she still lives  Jeannette Marks   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE DISH WASHER  Above the foam curled a light plume of steam An airy blue embodiment of dream That drew the tribute of her eager gaze As though it were a genie from a vase  Her hands worked on with even rise and fall But she was not aware of them at all A breeze came in a stranger to the town And set her tumblers bobbing up and down And making tinkly music frail and sweet Like fairy bells you startle with your feet In woodland grass Then happily her soul Awoke to sunlight nesting in a bowl A little crystal boat it seemed to be Upon the life and lustre of the sea  O SINGER O DANCER  So wonderful your fancies seem to me And rare the revelations that you bring I find my hands extended wistfully To stroke them as I would a skylark s wing  And then I dread the more my dim retreat Where glories turn to tatters one by one Oh take me where you dance with joyous feet Along the silver highway of the sun  Amanda Hall   PREMONITION  There s the crystal shiver of an icicle Falling from a bank where the runnels are deep That the last snow cut in the red brown bank Where the melting frost rills creep  The pine tree branches are bending low With a wet white weight and a woodpecker drums On a locust tree that will blossom white When the call for honey comes  The elm tree is gray with a purple shade And the sky seems to hang too low But I ve seen a light that the willows made Yellow against the snow  The edge of the wind is dull and wet The thin ice over the stream looks black And I know that power to power is set And winter is turning back  Louise Driscoll   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PERENNIALS  ANTICIPATION  I see myself meeting you I will wear the blue dress It is unobtrusive you cannot dislike it And the hat with the flowers You once said you liked flowers on a hat I have bought new gloves And pretty shoes that hurt Unconsciously I will get to your office I will walk up behind you Do you know you are getting quite gray I say your name quietly You swing around in your chair While you shake my hand I feel myself in your arms I do not hear your polite cordial voice say This is indeed a pleasure  SPRING DAY  I felt a fool When you caught me smiling at myself In the oval mirror But later in the day A six legged bug Taking ten minutes to climb across   Marion Strobel  The muscles of my arm Convinced me of my greatness  ENNUI  If I suck the flame into my mouth Will it warm the places You have left so bare I lean over the fire Flutter my fingers Dare my fingers down toward a spark I am cold and tired Push me a little Yes  LET ME PLAY NET  Let me play net and smash it at his feet And laugh to see his racket hit the ground Or cut it lightly so it spins Back toward me While his body like a gargoyle leaning out Sprawls toward the net And hits the mesh Or serve and skim the net to his left side And as he pops a backhand futilely Stroke it again to his left side And watch him try to take it on his forehand And go down   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE LAST RITUAL  Let us forget awhile or may We not drift into yesterday And play  Forget for a moment years Crowded with shuddering fears With tears  Lift high your hands again and try To be a thrush to touch the sky To fly  Dance down a sunbeam ray bright Like the day tossed from the night To light  Laugh to the flowers that you Colored the sunshine anew With dew  Whisper to me youth was so You too remember and know Then go  HANDS  Hands on the keys I saw only hands And yet her whole life passed before me there   Marion Strobel  Passed as she played the lilting joyous waltz Hands hypocrites that belied the happy notes they struck Tapering fingers of nerves weighted with glittering ware Tired hands where veins throbbed in the hope they might  keep still Beautiful yet too white wavering wearily on Playing the song of life when the dirge of death had begun  TWO SONNETS  I  Will you not stay away and let me be Alone with you Or must you always throw The present with its infidelity In front of my too weary eyes and so Smear with facts the frail pastel that I Have made of all our past in which I live With you again again the world defy And all the cynics who could not forgive A happiness they could not understand O love a bridge stencilled with lies I cross To yesterday I find our promised land Again and you I do not feel a loss If you but stay away my You will be Clearer than any actuality   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  II  How can I offer you the dull frayed song Of love I know Each word would stumble on A memory and I should see a long Blurred line of faces grimacing upon A musty curtain of the past Ah no Let me be silent Words would only sound A monotone a toxic cloying flow Of echoes would sift through and eddy round My voice and all the rapture that I feel Would turn into a harlequin and

POETRY could sit beside its editors for Feven a single month perusing the letters and manuscripts which come from all over the habitable world and sharing the talk with the visitors from far and near no doubt the dramatic little procession would answer some of their doubts and questions It would show them also how many bitter lessons in humility the editor of a magazine receives perhaps especially the editor who deals with poets and how remote his standpoint must be from that Olympian attitude of which he is sometimes accused POETRY S editors at least are saved by severe discipline from any pretense of infallibility and they regret that their merely personal and individual judgments must be acted on in the minimum of time far less time than would be required for lengthy and polite correspondence embodying exact criticism  Often we are asked How could you have refused So and so s poems and are informed that Professor A or the illustrious Mr B or the super enlightened Mrs C had read them with great admiration and advised the poet to submit them to us Now granting that the admiration and advice were sincere and not merely an amiable and quite permissible passing the buck in ninety nine cases out of one hundred the friendly admirer himself would refuse the poems on discovering that every week at least fifty manuscripts quite as good pass into this office and out again   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In other words he would find that he had not been able to resist the intimate appeal of an isolated manuscript sent to him with some touching story or some friendly recommendation he had read the poem with more favor than it deserved or than he himself would have felt if he had seen it in print  Indeed it is difficult to resist this intimate appeal Even the editors hardened as they are sometimes fall for it that is doubtless the reason for the inclusion now and then of some poem whose softness makes our readers marvel In this office you deal with naked souls said one of our observant visitors and his remark is more poignantly true of the general ruck of impossibles which flood our mails than it is of even the best poems we receive from trained artists whose business it is to reveal their innermost truth The barber s wife of the Middle West will confide to paper and send on with a fluttering heart to POETRY emotional secrets which she would conceal from her best friend and bury under sands of oblivion from her tonsorial husband and the half baked grocer s clerk of Philadelphia or farmer s son of the Kansas plains will hopefully string rhymes for the editor which he would not dare expose to the gibes of his base ball co teamers or even to the awe of his best girl  The most comically pathetically bad verse that we receive belongs to this class of intimate self revelations also much of the merely commonplace palaver which is neither comical pathetic nor anything else And often its return is as much of a shock to the author as the Quarterly s review   Those We Refuse  was to Keats Here for example is the haughty reaction of one of these self confident dreamers one who like many other would be poets seems to think the magazine exists for the purpose of printing her lucubrations  The editors of POETRY either do not know what real poetry is or else they have reasons of their own for declining such manuscripts as I have sent them Pray tell me where will an unknown poet look for appreciation if not to a journal devoted to poetry  Such over confidence in one s own genius while neither the rule nor the exception among the impossibles is quite common and by no means confined to the uneducated Usually it springs from artistic isolation and secretiveness lack of will or opportunity to get competent outside criticism The poet who writes in secret and broods over his unappreciated manuscripts almost invariably exaggerates their importance indeed seven years intercourse with poets has led me to the conviction that self training in solitude is the worst training in the world Look into thy heart and write is good advice but not if interpreted to mean Look nowhere else The poet should know his world and so far as his art is concerned any kind of battering from his world is better than his own self indulgent brooding Let him join or organize a poetry club in his school college or neighborhood where good poetry old and new may be read and discussed and his own verse slashed to pieces Let him try his poems on editors and see what happens If he is a poet he will get some necessary training the bigger he is the more the self within him will harden into shape   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  under the discipline If he is not a poet he will find it out sooner in the world than in the closet  A Byronic figure rises before me as I write a visitor of two or three years ago A packet containing his diary and poems had arrived through the mail together with a letter asking the editor to keep the packet for the author as he would soon be going to the war A touching faith that the poems were masterpieces was revealed between the lines of the letter and the editor was permitted nay invited to be the first to read and be convinced  With a sinking heart I unfolded the poems a few were enough they were beyond all possibility of error hopelessly abysmally commonplace Not wishing to be responsible against the hazards of life and death for a packet so precious to its owner and of no possible value to the world and feeling moreover that the young man needed a hint of disillusion I wrote appreciating his confidence and asking him to call and talk the poems over  It happened that three poets were present the afternoon he called Carl Sandburg mellow massive and human a young journalist from Wisconsin witty clever and up todate and Max Michelson always kind wise and sympathetic The visitor was presented and invited to join in the touch and go talk on poetry and poets Did he do so Not he He didn t even hear it as he sat in the remotest corner gazing at the ceiling a darkly melancholy and handsome figure of haughty youth and not until the others had gone would he come to life   Those We Refuse  Well I went through a few poems with him trying to lead him to some perception of their paleness and urging him against his intellectual isolation But Keats he protested and paused Keats was not a solitary I replied he published his first book at twenty one and two or three others before he died at twenty five and he had excellent friends and critics Leigh Hunt and Shelley among them  The young man carried his packet away silenced but not convinced  Many tales might be told to illustrate the would be poetic temperament Not all such candidates for the laurel are self deceived One for example wrote after two or three rejection slips  If my poems are no good won t you tell me It won t take long to say so will it I don t want to go on wasting time if I can t turn the trick  And another a gray haired far western lady with a bunch of newspaper clippings exclaimed with keen exactness  My friends in my town are crazy over my verses and this editor keeps begging for more of them but I don t want to make a fool of myself I feel sure they are just silly little things  The other side of the picture the editor s adventures among real poets would be more difficult to reveal because will known personalities are involved whose biographies are not yet for all the world But it is a thrilling tale full of rainbow colors and episodes both lyric and dramatic Perhaps the telling may be a labor of love for the editor s old age H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A POSTSCRIPT TO THE FOREGOING  Periodically over a span of some six years and a half I have been let me say privileged to read first the unknown and unheralded manuscripts which are submitted to this magazine It remains to this day an adventure Out of such virgin soil what strange beauty may at any moment burst forth what mine of precious metal be uncovered  Yet in daily practice much of the steadily increasing mass of manuscript is sorry stuff Human beings are none too perfect in any function of life none too perfect as fathers or sons or citizens or poets And here we search always for the absolute for the ultimate beauty that shall yet be born Much of the verse is sorry stuff and yet and this strikes me with great force after an absence of two years it is not so sorry as it was  The general average of the unsolicited verse that comes to POETRY is markedly better than it was when the magazine was new There is better understanding of technic a greater preoccupation with life as it is and less watered down Keats and Shelley We seldom get now the paraphrases of gospel hymns the sentimental ballads about beautiful young girls dying of who knows what obscure malady the odes to Apollo and the rhymed oratory that used to fill our mail Moral exhortation too is less  By this I do not mean that more great poetry comes to us than formerly I mean that less flagrantly bad verse reaches us The mind of the great public for it is the great public which sends these verses from every corner of   A Postscript to the Foregoing  the world and every stratum of society has been slowly but surely educated during the last few years to a greater appreciation of the possibilities of poetry as a medium and to the manner in which this quickening is accomplished They are learning to discriminate where formerly they only stared and to experiment discreetly where formerly they scoffed And we are reaping the benefits of this change of front  But in a way too our own task becomes more difficult If a poem is frankly impossible it means little beyond a glance at a stanza or two and the licking of the return envelope But if it is nearly good enough and yet not quite as so many poems are today it means reading and rereading consultation and heart searching And at last often an uncomfortable doubt as to the validity of our ultimate decision  Yet this is a drawback which we gladly endure For out of these writers of almost good verse will come the great audience for which we are waiting and out of these foothills of patient students will come perhaps some day the mountain peak of strength and beauty which is the ultimate hope of our labors E T  THE AMERICAN IMAGE  There cannot but be interest for us when the new field of American poetry is surveyed by an observer who brings a fresh eye an enthusiastic and receptive nature and a literary tradition quite other than our own Jean Catel is a young French student and poet who after a year at the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  University of Minnesota has lately returned home leaving his recorded impressions behind him in a thesis which won him his degree Invalided by the war he was sent to the United States by the French government to aid in that general rapprochement so much desired in this cosmopolitan day His prime object was to understand better the wonderland which had given birth to Whitman and Poe besides he intended to gather literary documents and if chance offered to write something on the modern poetry of America  Not expecting to find a really representative group of poets his joy in his discovery of the current movement and its figures was such that he enrolled at Minneapolis to give shape to his impressions To Whitman and Poe he now added in a phrase from his own letter the boys Sandburg Frost Masters Lindsay and it is upon them that his thesis largely rests  To the Frenchman M Catel reminds us Roland the Crusaders the Revolution Napoleon 1870 have been intimate parts of the poetical treasure What are their equivalents he asks in America If poetry is nothing but a decoration of our feelings our fancies our passing moods to quote his preface if verse is nothing but a pleasant pattern that can be easily borrowed from an extraneous tradition there is an American poetry as numbers of pretty poems in the magazines and daily press exist to testify But if poetry like every manifestation of art is the very heart beat of the race then we ask again Is there an American poetry It is his pleasant mission to assure us that   The American Image  the tradition is shaping and that the poetry has in fact come into existence  There is as the basis of every national art says this Frenchman a distinctive imagery For literature there are general concepts or images that form the common heritage of poets or of prose writers Certain groups of images unite to make a tradition they provide a frame through which is viewed the actual world in which the artist happens to live and form his imaginative consciousness The object of The American Image so M Catel entitles his paper is to catch the hour when the American tradition is in the making to secure the common ground upon which Poetry is engaged in building her eternal monuments  Though M Catel is constantly aware of the breadth of the country and of its effect on the shaping of our new art his consciousness engages itself principally with but three sections rural New England Chicago and the Middle west prairies and the Indian Spanish Southwest From these quarters he draws his images that image which may be an abstract idea as New England Solitude that which may be a living reality as The Farmer or a topographical entity such as The Prairie that of The City as typified in the uproar vigor and violence of Chicago or that yielded by the Side Scenery of Arizona and New Mexico with its wealth of light and color and its immemorial indigenes Such are the leit motifs of Catel s American Sonata  It will be seen readily enough that he does not recognize the entire range of the keyboard and it becomes plain on   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  inspection that he does not even strike all the notes within the octaves he has elected to employ Like every other composer he limits himself to the notes he needs He selects his own pitch chooses his own key keeps to his own tonality His object as a visitor from a land in the enjoyment of a long and rich artistic tradition is to assure him  self and us that the prelude of the great symphony whose starting signal has been given by Whitman is rising in harmony and order on a basis well secured  The writer himself may fairly be defended from a charge that his own basis is slight To his various sectional images he adds a National Image Lincoln as viewed by Robinson Markham Fletcher Lindsay and others also the image of the American Crowd with a rhythm of its own furthermore the epic image of the Army and the Flag And for fuller measure he considers at length the religious element religious because it consciously offers a spiritual aim to the idealism of the nation He dwells on the contrasting currents of a new Paganism and an abiding Puritanism asserting that Lindsay Masters Sandburg and Frost present an interesting blending of both their pagan sensualism has a spiritual basis and thus tends to religion their Puritanism applies to life in its physical forms and thus tends to sensualism Though the blending is not yet an accomplished fact the new beauty is in the making and it is a comfort and a joy that beautiful things are created in the struggle for beauty in which the great artists of the New World are engaged   Amid all this concern with Images the Imagists themselves are naturally remembered Though the Imagist movement is international and though our own members are transfuges from the American sensationalism yet their originality consists in having as a support the background of the American Image This casts a genuine light on their creations The swift flash of Amy Lowell the bizarre decorations of Fletcher the vividness of H D s symbols all these have come under the spell of the American Image in its complexity and spirit force and it is still more obvious that the symbol images of Carl Sandburg have been shaped and colored by his surroundings  In the end our author concludes the great lesson taught by the modern poets of America to the world is one of unconquerable sincerity and direct idealism And the new poetry appears to him as an admirable attempt at creating the traditional background that sustains art  And here the members of our practicing body of poets are left by a sympathetic and understanding visitor They may now perceive however unconscious heretofore or however consciously radical and rebellious that they are engaged in consolidating the framework of a new American art and even in establishing the tradition that a solid national art requires Young M Catel returned to France leaves the message behind him and the present epitomizer of his beliefs and views leaves the fraternity face to face with its responsibilities H B F   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVIEWS  THE FLOATING WORLD  Pictures of the Floating World by Amy Lowell Macmil  lan Co  Some poets though as secretive as a huge sun browned desert rock convey mysteriously to the reader an impression of their closeness to earth the solid integrity of their being Others like a lake volatile brilliant temperamental express all moods from gray mist to rainbow sparkles and leave us wondering Of this latter category is Miss Lowell She glitters splashes dazzles assumes veils of mist reflects stars gleams black under a midnight sky or pink with dawn yet what after all do we know of the real Amy Lowell Is there one We gaze through layer after layer of transparency into problematical depths but we never see bottom There is no dimensional quality in her poetry which says This is the real essence of me This is the height of my emotion this its depth These are the proportions of my spirit We are forced to take Miss Lowell as she presents herself in her book a liquid mirror to beauty  However these Pictures of the Floating World contain one section Two Speak Together which is unquestionably the most emotional and intimate work Miss Lowell has done They are love poems arranged according to a scheme of balanced intensities There seems to be no narrative sequence though perplexed and troubled by their poignant beauty one seeks a plot in the poems But Miss Lowell is   elusive as ever She leaves us to our own devices to make from her group what we will without a clue to unravel them One re reads them in vain seeking to disentangle the personalities of the Two who speak together resigning himself at last to leave them quite undistinguished And  hence arises a cloudiness which obscures not only their genesis but their appeal But the genuineness of their emotion is so unmistakable that one is forced to allow the poet to transpose it from one sex to another from one speaker to another at her will Miss Lowell uses an infinite variety of colors of delicate shapes and contours of dissolving gestures and light clear sounds as vehicles of emotion Her nerves quiver to the slightest stimulus her feeling for light sound and color is highly sensitive  The first poem of this group Vernal Equinox well illustrates this delicacy of perception  The scent of hyacinths like a pale mist lies between me and my  book And the South wind washing through the room Makes the candles quiver My nerves sting at a spatter of rain on the shutter And I am uneasy with the thrusting of green shoots Outside in the night  Why are you not here to overpower me with your tense and urgent love  Another one is called Wheel of the Sun  I beg you Hide your face from me Draw the tissue of your head gear Over your eyes   For I am blinded by your beauty And my heart is strained And aches Before you  In the street You spread a brightness where you walk And I see your lifting silks And rejoice But I cannot look at your face You melt my strength And set my knees to trembling Shadow yourself that I may love you For now it is too great a pain  There is a poignancy of imagery in November The vine leaves against the brick walls of my house Are rusty and broken Dead leaves gather under the pine trees The brilliant boughs of lilac bushes Sweep against the stars And I sit under a lamp Trying to write down the emptiness of my heart Even the cat will not stay with me But prefers the rain Under the meager shelter of a cellar window  First in the book but second in importance to the group I have just considered come the Lacquer Prints They are fashioned after Japanese models in a quasi oriental idiom are carefully wrought highly polished and sometimes a little hard Although it is a form of poetry that Miss Lowell does superlatively well her treatment does not differ very greatly from that of several other poets who do the hokku into English It is a much over rated form fit to be the vehicle of only the tiniest facets of emotion Its great charm when well done is that the economy of its   The Floating World  image releases the imagination of the reader to fill in the picture with something to him significant It is ruined by too great rigidity by a too conventional imagination or a lifeless subject Miss Lowell has written some of these tiny poems which carry magic with every word The hushed waiting the delicate silent piling up of the flowers in Outside a Gate enchant the reader  On the floor of the empty palanquin The plum petals constantly increase Another lovely one is Autumn All day I have watched the purple vine leaves Fall into the water And now in the moonlight they still fall But each leaf is fringed with silver A beautiful picture of light is in Nuit Blanche The chirping of crickets in the night Is intermittent Like the twinkling of stars Miss Lowell is a writer of indefatigable energy With passionate curiosity she has explored every corner of her own subtle and intricate personality and from this subjective material and her vivid reactions to beauty she has made her best poems As an interpreter she is not so successful for she is essentially an individualist Appuldurcombe Park is perhaps the least effective the least beautiful poem in the book The reiteration of the statement I am a woman sick for passion which begins each of the four long stanzas is unconvincing and repellent When women ate sick for passion we may say it of them but scarcely   put the words into their mouths The psychology of the poem is weak Miss Lowell is an intellectual and does not penetrate far into personalities alien to her own Her greatest achievement is in descriptive poetry into which she puts that flash of subjective emotion so characteristic of her best work For instance Beech Pine and Sunlight  The sudden April heat Stretches itself Under the smooth leafless branches Of the beech tree And lies lightly Upon the great patches Of purple and white crocus With their panting wide open cups A clear wind Slips through the naked beech boughs And their shadows scarcely stir But the pine trees beyond sigh When it passes over them And presses back their needles And slides gently down their stems It is a languor of pale south starting sunlight Come upon a morning unawakened And holding her drowsing  Miss Lowell s poems have not mass solidity proportion They are not architectural One is not tempted to take them into one s hands and feel them as one might a sculptured object Yet they are more than decorative They could not be hung upon the wall like pictures because though nine tenths of the poem may be a picture one line or a word will be a needle of emotion a shock of electricity which makes the thing glow and move We do not get from Miss Lowell a feeling of intimacy with earth by which   I mean human life of close warm interpretation She is rather like the lake brilliant mirror like responsive contained within shores of an alien substance an alien element which it touches reflects beats upon but with which it cannot mingle M A S  WALEY S TRANSLATIONS FROM THE CHÍNESE  A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems and More Translations from the Chinese by Arthur Waley Alfred A Knopf The increasing influence of Chinese art and especially of  Chinese poetry makes these labors of Mr Waley singularly opportune for while previous translators like H A Giles  L Cranmer Byng and Judith Gautier have spurred us into the subject Mr Waley is at once more exact and as a rule more instinctively sympathetic  The traveller in China encounters with some surprise the wistful half pitying humor which pervades Chinese art and learns before long that it is fundamental in Chinese character In paintings and carvings and even in the most dignified sacred architecture and sculpture one detects almost always a faint half pitying smile that slight flavor of the grotesque through which the oriental acknowledges the strangeness of our fate One finds this in Sung paintings the cataract and the mountain are there simplified almost to a symbol of grandeur but somewhere in the corner a small twisted and squinting philosopher expresses the little   ness of man Or if there be lords and ladies in some gorgeous festival the smile slips through their preoccupation the artist manages to tell us the unimportance of their  important rites Though the early stone sculpture and bronzes postulate man s divinity without this smiling question and perhaps the earliest surviving architecture like the almost inaccessible Sung tombs yet one detects it in the guardian dragons and animals of all Chinese roofs and portals within the reach of modern travel even as a far faint flavor in the Temple of Heaven itself  Indeed this smile at human dignity is so omnipresent in China that after a short sojourn there the traveller returns with a shock of readjustment to the almost invariable seriousness of occidental art He feels that even the Gothic grotesques must have been an oriental importation  But Chinese poetry is on the whole more serious Its prevailing note is plaintive and unrebellious sorrow sorrow over the struggles and vicissitudes of life Tao Ch ien expressed it thus fifteen hundred years ago  You had better go where Fate leads Drift on the Stream of Infinite Flux Without joy without fear When you must go then go And make as little fuss as you can  The simplicity the forthright directness and candor of these Chinese poems has been so much emphasized by various reviewers that we need not dwell upon it It is indeed a basic influence in modern poetry for although the Waley translations have just appeared earlier versions had conveyed   the hint which at once put Victorian expansiveness out of date Mr Waley now confirms the message by presenting readings of closer texture set to freer rhythms than L Cranmer Byng for example felt at liberty to use in his Lute of Jade first published at a time when rhymes and iambics were inevitable Mr Waley strips his text bare makes no concessions Finding it as impossible to suggest the Chinese rhyme scheme and system of inflections as it would be to classify for us the ideographic calligraphy which adds such a mysterious element to their poetic complex he attempts merely textual accuracy not only of the word but of the feeling and tone presented in free rhythms which lean strongly on the line as a phrase unit If the intricacies of Chinese prosody still elude us as probably they always must in so different a language we are brought closer than ever before to the motives of Chinese song and to the character and every day lives of the people during those centuries when Europe was in chaos and China was the most civilized country on earth Indeed as the Chinese change little Mr Waley teaches us more probably of life in China today than one could learn from an hundred travellers And of the Chinese character and temperament which is fundamentally not so far from our own  In both these books about a fourth of the space is given to that very humane and very modern poet of the eighth and ninth centuries Po Chu i Here was a man who lived long and passed cheerfully be it with a smile or a sigh through all vicissitudes Whether poor or prosperous privy coun   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  cillor at the capital or exile among the illiterate whether an ardent youth or a serene old man this poet was one of the company of choice spirits for whom times and tongues are no barrier Eugene Field would have fraternized with him or Saint Augustine or William Marion Reedy or Will Shakespeare Though a less bibulous and violent Rabelaisian than his predecessor Li Po he was not above getting drunk in friendly company  How great a thing is a single cup of wine  For it makes us tell the story of our whole lives  Nor was he proof against the charms of a little dancing girl whom he took to the mountains to beguile a period of retirement  Two top knots not yet plaited into one  Of thirty years just beyond half  You who are really a lady of silks and satins  Are now become my hill and stream companion  At the spring fountains together we splash and play  On the lovely trees together we climb and sport  Her cheeks grow rosy as she quickens her sleeve dancing  Her brows grow sad as she slows her song s tune  Don t go singing the song of the Willow Branches  When there s no one here with a heart for you to break  But on the whole he was a good subject and good citizen full of common sense and common sympathy Though a court functionary he feels the impotent misery of the charcoal seller whose load is seized with curses by a public official Though a scholar he tells of eating bamboo shoots a delicious salad by the way or of pruning trees or of an old black gauze hat which he delights to wear He   sings sweetly and sadly of his tiny daughter living and dead  little Golden Bells and of playing with his baby boy A Ts ui and of all human occupations and their futility  My being busy that has never changed  Then on the shore building sand pagodas  Now at court covered with tinkling jade  This and that equally childish games  Things whose substance passes in a moment of time  In short Po Chu i like Chaucer was a genial modest and wise poet politician and philosopher a man of the court and of the people absolutely incapable of losing his head whether Fate frowned or smiled He is perhaps the closest parallel to Chaucer who may be found in literary history and in his poems the China of his day lives for us almost as vividly as fourteenth century England lives in the Canterbury Tales  Almost any of his hundred or more poems might be quoted but it would be unfair to the reader who should go to these books and add Po Chu i to the number of his friends One may say au revoir to him with two quatrains both written in the hermit peace of his old age The first is the word of a philosopher  As contented as me among a hundred men  Look as you will you will not find one  In the affairs of others even fools are wise  In their own business even sages err  The second written on his death bed is the wistful sigh of an inveterate lover of life  The jars in my cellar are plastered deep with mould My singer s carpets are half crumbled to dust   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  How can I bear when the Earth renews her light To watch from a pillow the beauty of Spring unfold  Many other poets are represented in these two volumes from Ch u Yuan of 300 B C whose magnificent chant Battle is one of the sternest war songs in literature to Yu Lu of 1200 A D whose brief sketches close the richer periods of Chinese song Among them are a number of women for example Hsi Chun a princess who was sent to central Asia to be the wife of a decrepit nomad king and who thus expressed her heart break  My people have married me In a far corner of Earth Sent me away to a strange land To the king of the Wu sun A tent is my house Of felt are my walls Raw flesh my food With mare s milk to drink Always thinking of my own country My heart sad within Would I were a yellow stork And could fly to my old home  Acceptance of life with all it brings is implicit in all these poems There may be sorrow but there is no rebellion the Chinese spirit accepts both the earth below and the heavens above presuming not to question or defy Through this acceptance of his fate the Chinese poet loses drama no doubt but gains security a certain strength of poise which excludes both hope and despair and makes beauty the only sure refuge H M   A Lover of Earth  A LOVER OF EARTH  Dust and Light by John Hall Wheelock Charles Scribner s  Sons  Through all the conflict of theories and practices during  the last seven or eight years Mr Wheelock s art has kept in the beaten course He uses the simple rhymed forms long familiar in English poetry and his song is of love and death of the earth and God themes ancient and inexhaustible For the two or three war poems and the few sonnets to Beethoven Rossetti and others are negligible  He is developing however a certain philosophy of life which makes his lyricism a bit more austere than that which gave us his youthful love songs This book has less of that cloying sweetness which fairly dripped from the two or three earlier volumes The poems are more discreetly sifted no doubt but also their author is no longer satisfied to ring the luscious changes on a single theme To be sure there is a group of love songs April Twilight in this volume still too sweet too little varied though of firmer quality than most of the earlier books but the best of the book indeed much the best work that Mr Wheelock has done as yet is the Glimmering Earth section which celebrates a larger love  Out of the earth the poem grows  Like the lily or the rose  Yea the quiet and cool sod  Bears in her breast the dream of God  In his rapturous worship of the earth as the source and   final resolvent of all life all love all beauty this poet attains a lofty and impassioned lyric ecstasy Our readers felt it no doubt in The Moonlight Sonata first published over two years ago an ode sincerely ecstatic in its expression of that modern spiritualized paganism union of the human soul with the infinite in the beauty of nature Perhaps this poem is the most impassioned of all and the finest in that it carries its rapture unflagging to a difficult climax to that suggestion of a union with the earth in death which will slake the poet s passion for eternity  The same emotion is more quietly expressed in Earth and we find details of it in the briefer poems Golden Noon Dear Earth The Lonely Poet and here are a few quatrains from Thanks from Earth to Heaven as delicately and genuinely naïve as a child s grace  While the great world goes its way I watch in wonder all the day All the night my spirit sings For the loveliness of things  For the world enough it were To have a useful earth and bare But for poets it is made All in loveliness arrayed  For his eye the little moth Wears her coat of colored cloth And to please his ear the deep Ocean murmurs in her sleep  Of course this child like simplicity has its dangers when it flags it becomes tiresome and certain poems remind us that Mr Wheelock has not yet rid his wings of stickiness that he needs an icy bath or a sense of humor But he grows   A Lover of Earth  in austerity and discretion and his lyric rapture becomes more adult and competent In short this book strides far ahead of the earlier ones in spite of a few fine love songs in them which we are like to remember H M  CHILDREN S BOOKS  Snickerty Nick by Julia Ellsworth Ford with rhymes by  Witter Bynner and illustrations by Arthur Rackham  Moffat Yard amp Co Singing Games
