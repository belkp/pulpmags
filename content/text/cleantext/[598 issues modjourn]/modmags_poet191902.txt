of the disorder of the dressing table Lies a black eye stone A golden hairpin has fallen to the ground She leans against a screen Arch coquettish welcoming his arrival Then suddenly striking the strings of her table lute She sings And her face is like rain whitening the Gorge of Witches And like the bright busy movement of the Western Sea  Li Hai ku Nineteenth Century   THE EMPEROR S RETURN FROM A JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH  Like a saint he comes The Most Noble In his lacquered state chariot He awes the hundred living things He is clouded with the purple smoke of incense A round umbrella Protects the Son of Heaven Exquisite is the beauty Of the two edged swords Of the chariots  Of the star embroidered shoes of the attendants The Sun and Moon fans are borne before him And he is preceded by sharp spears And the blowing brightness of innumerable flags The spring wind proclaims the Emperor s return Binding the ten thousand districts together In a chorded harmony of Peace and Satisfaction So that the white haired old men and the multitudes rejoice And I also wish to add the tribute of my secret writings  Wen Cheng ming Sixteenth Century  ON SEEING THE PORTRAIT OF A

girdle pendants   But I stand beside the Lang Temple Doing nothing And speaking not at all  Liang T ung shu Eighteenth Century  THE PALACE BLOSSOMS  When the rain ceases The white water flowers of Ch

YEARS  Spring  The willows near the roadside rest house are soft with new  burst leaves I saunter along the river path Listening to the occasional beating of the ferry drum Clouds blow and separate And between them I see the watch towers Of the distant city They come in official coats T o examine my books   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Months go by Years slide backwards and disappear Musing I shut my eyes And think of the road I have come And of the spring weeds Choking the fields of my house  Summer  The rain has stopped The clouds drive in a new direction The sand is so dry and hard that my wooden shoes ring  upon it As I walk The flowers in the wind are very beautiful A little stream quietly draws a line Through the sand Every household is drunk with sacrificial wine And every field is tall with millet And pale young wheat I have not much business It is a good day Ha Ha I will write a poem On all this sudden brightness   Florence Ayscough and Amy Lowell  Autumn  Hoar frost is falling And the water of the river runs clear The moon has not yet risen But there are many stars On the opposite bank Autumn lamps are burning in the windows I am sick Sick with all the illnesses there are I can bear this cold no longer And a great pity for my whole past life Fills my mind The boat has started at last Oh be careful not to run foul Of the fishing nets  Winter  I was lonely in the cold valleys Where I was stationed But I am still lonely And when no one is near I sigh My gluttonous wife rails at me To guard her bamboo shoots My son has neglected The vegetables Oh yes   Old red rice can satisfy hunger And poor people can buy muddy unstrained wine On credit But the pile of land tax bills Is growing I will go over and see my neighbor Leaning on my staff  Li Hai ku Nineteenth Century  THE INN AT THE WESTERN LAKE  The inn leans against the mountain s root The smooth skin of the water shines And the clouds slip over the sky This is the twilight of dawn and dusk On the top of Hsi Lung The hill priest sits in the evening And meditates Two Two Those are the lights of fishing boats Arriving at the door  Wang Ching seng Nineteenth Century  Translated by Florence Ayscough English version by Amy Lowell   THE FAREWELL  When in a plunge of water the great ship  Had sunk to the sea s depth Its blind body dragging after it Halyards and dripping masts  When toward the four quarters of the night Its beats had all perished Each beyond sight of the others Each with a high wave Covering its final cries  When the furious water had wiped From its surface all signs There was still in the sea A man alive and swimming  He knew that the land was far off And that before he could feel with a cry of joy Becoming real to the reach of his feet The shore of the tide of wreckage  There would have to be day after day Turn after turn exhaustion and sleeping and eating  He acknowledged his appointed end But he thought himself strong and he wished To use calmly the moments of this strength   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  T o use for slow and holy profit The last warmth of his body The last illumination of his mind  He let himself be borne by the fury of the water Which heaved him high on the edge of its surge Then plunged him dizzily To the foot of its deep and moving walls  Huge waves came  Charging him like rams Tossing his body  On their lowered horns  Dykes burst before him  Mountains shattered over him  Hail beat across him  Tigers played with his head  The water enwound him  Trying to dissolve him  And for an eternity  The vast liquid tumult  Was at his very core  Then for an instant about him Calm came And the sea took respite And there was the seething of broken foam And his senses found the air again like another world   Charles Vildrac tr by Witter Bynner  So it went until dawn And to live longer he ceased swimming Rather with his limbs forcing The water to uphold him  So it was until dawn And then the cold sheathed him And only then fell  The blind hope from his body  That proud thing which gives to men  The custom of their victories  And the subjection of the earth  Only then closed in on him  The awful certainty  There was at the heart of this man  A life unknown to himself  A life simple and still full  Of child like faith  Which never would have believed  That for its most favored guest  Its most loving son  Nature can be at times  An iron stranger deaf  And absolute and pitiless  And suddenly into the heart of this man Came the shock and the wound of exile The sea its sound its motion   Its power its volume Overwhelmed him with horror  He hunted out of his head the noise of the water And he closed his eyes to escape it far away   He saw a town Touched softly by the sun  Fine new shoes Went brightly creaking Over the clean pavements  Along the row of shops Behind the shutters All the clocks Could be heard Striking noon  And then by the glimmer of a night lamp He saw a closed room Where a family lay asleep  He heard the sound of their breathing The crossing and confusing of rhythms  He leaned over the beds Heavy and humid with sleep   Charles Vildrac tr by Witter Bynner  In one lay two children together Their bodies were uncovered And huddled in a hollow Like kittens  He saw again a young girl Watering flowers in a garden One of her hands caught up her dress The other was balancing as far as she could reach The heavy watering can To distribute a curving shower Without wetting the tips of her shoes held tight together  The little clustering leaves Whispered content And even their wet fragrance came to him And the very sound on the path Of footsteps crunching the pebbles  He saw also streets cluttered with chairs Where one sits to drink and to watch the crowd And he saw soldiers gambling and wrestling In the barracks yard at dusk  He saw deep lanes he saw wheat fields He saw also the straight roads Where you say good day to the people you pass  And last he saw again the great realm   Where thoughts touch and exchange Where all is intimately blent from all the earth He saw again the land of lands Where all prolongs itself in one embrace  It was then he wished to utter words To give thanks for his whole heritage And he wished to speak them aloud In order that he might hear with his ears Once more the genius of words The sound of a voice  And so he spoke as if he were praying He pronounced in the middle of the sea The words that serve for love And for praise  He sought them all out and repeated them As one dying of thirst sucks at the juice of a fruit  And when there were no more of them in his head He must sing T o satiate his farewell Sing without words   He must sing  It was the loveliest song Of the pang of love and sadness   Charles Vildrac tr by Witter Bynner  It was the most poignant song of man That a man ever had sung  And though it routed in his head The tenacious voices of the sea Though it was more august in his head Than great organs No one here heard it  And no one here can be surprised By suddenly recalling it By humming it to himself Believing it sprung from his memory  It was dissolved in the wind  Like snow in a stream   His teeth were chattering as he sang it And water burned his eyes But it was not the water of the sea  From the French of Charles Vildrac Translated by Witter Bynner   CRAYONS OF DOMINICA  UNDER THE SAMAN

paused to listen Nobody paused to look  Although the ragged tune entranced me in the street  I thought my heart would break as I stood listening there  To ragged Orpheus grinding out his air For nobody paused to listen Nobody paused to look  Although the ancient gods of Greece flocked round us there  IN WINTER  I am content to wait for spring To cherish winter days I am grown fearful of the

as a perfect  chrism  It is evident you were right  There are bounds to break Sumptuous passage from sight For you and sighs down the white  Path of your wake  Now to the dead you ve given  Your last

that pauses to listen  Glimmers our  Shadow as well and deprives  Them none of their glisten  In each shaken morsel  Our shadow trembles  As if it rippled from out of us hand in hand  We are part and

one smooth curve Of easy sailing Odd red wicks serve To show where the ships at sea move out of sight   This place is palpable me for here I was born Of this self same darkness Yet the shadowy house below Is out of bounds and only the old ghosts know I have come they whimper about me welcome and mourn  My father suddenly died in the harvesting corn And the place is no longer ours Watching I hear No sound from the strangers the place is dark and fear Opens my eyes till the roots of my vision seem torn  Can I go nearer never towards the door The ghosts and I we mourn together and shrink In the shadow of the cart shed hovering on the brink For ever to enter the homestead no more  Is it irrevocable Can I really not go Through the open yard way Can I not pass the sheds And through to the mowie Only the dead in their beds Can know the fearful anguish that this is so  I kiss the stones I kiss the moss on the wall And wish I could pass impregnate into the place I wish I could take it all in a last embrace I wish with my breast I could crush it perish it all  D H Lawrence  COMMENT  THE VIERECK INCIDENT  O W that the Great War is over a number of smaller wars remain to be fought wars which have been held in abeyance while the nation was training every nerve and muscle for the enormous task Probably the most important of these smaller wars is one which will never be over a war which requires eternal vigilance and a sword ever unsheathed if the world is to be made and kept safe for democracy the spiritual war for freedom of thought freedom of speech freedom of the press  These are fundamental human rights elements of that liberty for which together with life and the pursuit of happiness our forefathers fought the Revolutionary War unfurled the Stars and Stripes and wrote the Constitution of the United States In the Constitution they inserted a clause protecting these rights But a constitution however well written does not fulfill itself sooner or later it will become a scrap of paper unless it is fulfilled by the spiritual fervor of those who swear allegiance to it from generation to generation  The immediate text of these remarks is the recent expulsion of George Sylvester Viereck from the Poetry Society of America though heaven knows since poetry is a free expression of the spirit of man a magazine devoted to the art might find a text in certain provisions of the conscription and espionage acts which may hold conscientious objectors   and other peace propagandists among them a number of poets in prison for a decade or two after the war they opposed is over Suppressive texts are only too numerous these days and if we choose the case of Mr Viereck for special emphasis it is because it is almost a reductio ad absurdam of the whole tendency involving a rich irony which invites the gods to laugh When a society of poets poets being nothing if not arch individualists jealous guardians of spiritual freedom when such a society becomes more suppressive of one of its members than the United States government has been during a year and a half of war then it is time to inquire where we are going and when we may hope to return to ancestral first principles  W e pass over the legal aspects of the question which Shaemus O Sheel Mr Viereck s champion in the P S A presents in his circular letter to members Whether the executive committee had power or not under the P S A constitution to expel a member it would seem that the whole society might have been permitted to vote on the question  But whatever may be the strict letter of the law the artistic and spiritual implications of the incident are more important A society of poets should be the freest body in the world the most tolerant of individual idiosyncrasy of thought and word If a member s opinions are too idiosyncratic that should be the very place for him to find it out through not suppression but expression through give andtake with other minds The punishment of extremists if   The Viereck Incident  war or other violence makes it expedient may safely be left  to the authorized agencies of law and order If poets must  revise their opinions before getting together must think by  rule and speak by the card then their association becomes  about as stimulating as a padded quilt  The whole tragi comic incident is but a detail of a  menacing public mood The mood is equally menacing  whether it comes from one extreme or the other from  autocrac military or industrial on the one hand or mob  tyranny on the other In either case it is destructive of lib  erty and provocative of violence  I remember my youthful horror over the imprisonment of John Bunyan William Penn and other famous worthies for their advocacy of certain doctrines among them an objection to war I remember my self righteous satisfaction that such outrages upon human liberty were impossible in our enlightened era and nation Yet today men and women some of them mere boys and girls are in prison at Fort Leavenworth for ten twelve fifteen years for exactly the same reason and I doubt if the jailors are so merciful as Bunyan s who allowed his prisoner ink paper and time to write a masterpiece No doubt our modern prisoners of a great republic now happily at peace wish that they were in old Russia with some tzar s birthday coming along to give them hope of amnesty  More tolerance this should be the demand of all who think and feel especially of all poets more tolerance for conscientious objectors and other recalcitrant opinionaters  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WRITTEN PICTURES  Of late years considerable attention has been attracted to Chinese poetry and to Chinese painting but as yet the art peculiar to the Far East the art considered by the Chinese as the most perfect medium by which man can express himself can record the reactions of his personality to the world he lives in has entirely escaped notice I refer to the Tzù Hua written pictures or hanging on the wall poems  It is of course quite natural that this should be the case general knowledge of the Far East of its customs its art its theory of life its reactions to its environment has been is and must be for some time to come superficial While a knowledge of its language without which real comprehension is impossible has been attained by comparatively few Occidentals It seems likely therefore that the Tzü Hua will remain unnoticed and unappreciated until a much closer understanding is established with the Far East  Yet what art could be more subtle more refined more truly aesthetic A beautiful thought perpetuated in beautiful hand writing and hung upon the wall to suggest a mental picture does not the possession of such a medium rouse the envy of Occidental imagists who are indeed the spiritual descendants of the East  In China the arts of poetry and calligraphy have their common root in the ideographs which form the written language these wonderful ideographs and the art of calligraphy are vividly described by Lafcadio Hearn in his  Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan   Written Pictures  No rigid convention fetters the fancy of the calligraphist each strives to make his character more beautiful than any others and generation upon generation of artists have been toiling from time immemorial with the like emulation so that through centuries of tireless effort and study the primitive ideograph has been evolved into a thing of beauty indescribable It consists only of a certain number of brush strokes but in each stroke there is an indescribable secret art of grace proportion imperceptible curve which makes it seem alive and bears witness that even in the lightning moment of its creation the artist felt for its ideal shape equally along its entire length  In writing thus however Hearn refers only to form he does not mention what constitutes the soul of the character which is its composition These marvelous collections of brush strokes which we call Chinese characters are really separate pictographic representations of complete thoughts Complex characters are composed not of strokes but of more simple characters each having its own peculiar meaning and usage thus when used in combination each plays its part in modifying either the sense or the sound of the complex it is therefore impossible to seize a poet s complete meaning unless each character is analyzed and broken up into its component parts this can only be done by a careful study of the ideograph in its original form Many have been so altered during the centuries which have passed since they were first traced as to be almost unrecognizable  About 200 A D realizing that this alteration was taking place a scholar named Hsu Shih wrote the dictionary known as the Shuo Wên Chieh Tzü or the Speech and Writing Characters Untied containing about ten thousand characters in their primitive and final forms This work is on the desk of every scholar in the Far East and is studied with the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  greatest reverence Many editions have appeared since it was written and by its aid one can trace the genealogy of characters in the most complete manner While translators are apt to ignore this important matter of genealogy if one may so call it of the characters it is ever present in the mind of the Chinese poet or scholar who is familiar with the original form indeed he may be said to find his overtones in the actual composition of the character he is using  In a recent review of a volume of Chinese poetry a critic in the London Times writes  The difference seems to be that the Chinese poet hardly knows he is one The great poets of Europe in their themes and their language insist that they are poets what they do is accompanied with a magnificent gesture but the Chinese poet starts talking in the most ordinary language and voice of the most ordinary things and his poetry seems to happen suddenly out of the commonplace as if it were some beautiful action happening in the routine of actual life  This critic can have no knowledge of the Chinese language as nothing can be further from the truth than his remark It is true that the Oriental poet finds his themes in the most ordinary affairs of every day life but he describes them in a very special carefully chosen medium The simplest child s primer is written in a language never used in speaking while the most highly educated scholar would never dream of using the same phrases in conversation which he would use were he writing an essay a poem or a state document nor would he use the same written style for these three productions For instance in speaking of sunset one would probably say in Chinese quite simply sun   Written Pictures  down in writing a poet would however employ a character which means the sun disappearing in the grass at the horizon a character which in its primitive form was an actual picture of the sun vanishing in long grass Each language the spoken the poetic the literary the documentary has its own construction its own class of characters and its own symbolism A translator must therefore make a special study of whichever he wishes to render  Although several great sinologues have written on the subject of Chinese poetry none so far as I am aware has devoted his exclusive attention to the poetic style nor has any translator availed himself of the assistance so essential to success of a poet that is one trained in the art of seizing the poetic value in shades of meaning while on the other hand such poets as have been moved to make beautiful renditions of Chinese originals have been hampered by inadequate translations In a word English translations of Chinese poetry have not as yet been the result of collaboration between a sinologue and a poet We have therefore but a faint conception of its possibilities  It is time that a knowledge of Chinese art should come from a direct study of native sources Although we are deeply indebted to the Japanese for all that they have done to make the whole subject comprehensible we must never forget that in accepting their opinions and their renditions we are accepting those of a people alien to the Chinese a people who differ widely in their philosophy their temperament and their ideals a people who although they have   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  borrowed the ideographs of the Chinese have in many cases modified and altered the original meanings For this reason Chinese poems translated from Japanese transcriptions cannot fail to lose some of their native flavor and allusion indeed it is not possible that they come very near the originals  It is impossible to do more than hint at a few of the points which further study of Chinese poetry will bring out clearly we have for instance not mentioned the characteristic method of reading poems in a modulated chant which is well described by Mrs Tietjens in POETRY for October 1916 She confines her remarks to the Classics they apply however to a much wider field  The poems which appear in the current issue are taken from a collection of Tzü Hua once in the possession of a Chinese gentleman of keenly aesthetic taste and are excellent examples of an art universally popular in China  It is a thousand pities that the readers of POETRY cannot realize how extremely literal Miss Lowell s arrangements are Her remarkable gift first shown in Six French Poets for seizing the essence of the allusion which a poet wishes to convey has enabled her to render in a phrase the different parts of a complicated character in using which the poet expresses a complete thought  It is only by digging until the very roots of the character are laid bare that Chinese poetry can be really understood  Florence

experience which has not often come to me The authors who appear in these pages lived in a country I have never seen wore strange garments and wrote in a tongue I do not understand But thanks to the devoted labor and the scholarly skill of their translator a skill that is above suspicion I have been enabled to come in touch with these men many of whom are anonymous and some of whom lived in such ancient times that they are mere shadows more remote than Homer And yet all these men are now because they were poets my personal friends They have often spoken to my heart and my heart has listened They have given me songs for which I am eternally grateful And though none of my gratitude may reach their ears in the kingdom beyond the grave yet I know I must express it now that others may come and read their songs in turn and feel the same as I  These Chinese poets fulfilled exactly Matthew Arnold s famous phrase to see life steadily and to see it whole And I am quite certain that they were the only poets who ever did so Mr Waley says cautiously in his Introduction To most Europeans the momentary flash of Athenian questioning will seem worth more than all the centuries of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Chinese assent But is this true Is it true that the world war of today another momentary flash of questioning is worth more say than Mr Waley s volume On the one side thousands of men killed thousands more maimed whole countries laid waste hunger disease desolation in order to put a stop to the ambitions of one man who has presumed to question the right of others to live on as they were accustomed On the other hand a handful of songs mere words about life death sorrow disappointment vanity Mere words against armies Mere words against time  The one quality that is common to all these Chinese singers is their absolute sincerity their refusal to accept any make believes about life To them men are neither heroes nor villains they are simply products of nature very much on a level with trees and animals in Nature s eyes fated to the same sorrow pain and oblivion A great modesty before Nature is the Chinese poet s chief characteristic Instead of informing us confidently with Whitman  Cycles ferried my cradle rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen  he usually exclaims despondently  Often I fear that these untalented limbs Will be laid at last in an unnamed grave  This refusal to see anything especially fine or important or heroic about man and his destiny is the elementary principle of the Chinese character From this it comes about that the Chinese poet has no use for the figures of speech huddled adjectives verbal climaxes tortured metaphors and so forth which his occidental rival uses so constantly Mr Waley   Perfume of Cathay  speaks of the habitual clichés of Chinese poetry The phrase is perfectly just Chinese poetry is a set of stock phrases of mere clichés There is a strong analogy here to Chinese painting In Chinese painting the forms are little more than a series of old conventions The color is nothing more than black and white Yet in the spacing of these forms and in the variation of these tones an art has been evolved that surpasses western art as far in its power of suggesting the infinite moods of Nature as western art surpasses it in sheer brilliant craftsmanship And these poets working with characters that because of their limited ideographic significance and later calligraphic development might almost be called conventional paintings in miniature evolved poems like the following where every word is sheer commonplace but where the total effect is simply overwhelming  When I was young I was out of tune with the herd My only love was for the hills and mountains Unwittingly I fell into the web of the World s dust And was not free until my thirtieth year The migrant bird longs for its old wood The fish in the tank thinks of its native pool I had rescued from wildness a patch of the southern moor And still rustic I returned to field and garden My ground covers no more than ten acres My thatched cottage has eight or nine rooms Elms and willows cluster by the eaves Peach trees and plum trees grow before the hall Hazy hazy the distant hamlets of men Steady the smoke of the half deserted village A dog barks somewhere in the deep lanes A cock crows at the top of the mulberry trees At gate and court yard no murmur of the world s dust In the empty rooms leisure and deep stillness   Long I lived checked by the bars of a cage Now I have turned again to nature and freedom Mr Waley may assure us as often as he likes that a poem like this was the product of a race of torpid mainlanders whose thoughts set out on no strange quests and adventures I simply refuse to believe it No one can write a poem like that if his mind and imagination are torpid No it is only after passing through innumerable quests and adventures after exhausting every other possible experience that one can have this experience and express it in this way Either Mr Waley has failed to understand the depths of the oriental temperament like many another western observer or his introduction is nothing but an elaborate piece of camouflage designed to conceal his true views  But to return to the question whether the momentary flash of Athenian questioning is worth more than all the centuries of Chinese assent It is quite true that to a cultivated Chinaman the Greek attitude of mind would have seemed ignoble savage let us out with the word Hunnish Achilles sulking in his tent and letting the Greek army go to ruin without lifting a hand to save it Medea slaughtering her children to get even with Jason Ajax infuriated to madness because he was not awarded Achilles armour Danae set adrift on the ocean with her infant a helpless prey of wind and wave simply because she had followed the dictates of Nature themes such as these would have seemed horrible to the Chinese poet and to treat such themes as fine heroic episodes would have seemed even worse To regard Clytemnestra as a fine creation of the imagination would   Perfume of Cathay  have seemed to him as horrible and unnatural as to regard poison gas gangrene and trench fever as fine things There may have been Clytemnestras even in China I do not know But the nearest we get to them in poetry is something like the following  Entering the hall she meets the new wife  Leaving the gate she runs into her former husband  Words stick she does not manage to say anything  She presses her hands together and hesitates  Agitates moon like fan sheds pearl like tears  Realises she loves him just as much as ever  That her present pain will never come to an end  The fact that this poem was written by a blood stained murderous tyrant a veritable Chinese Nero ought to start an interesting discussion amongst our Freudians Now that the Freudian theory of art is fashionable and many hold that poetry is only the expression of some suppressed impulse transmuted to the imaginative plane what are we to make of such a poem as this Does it represent an impulse towards pity and humanity in the character of a singularly depraved and vicious man And if so if the vicious man expresses his good impulse and a good man expresses his underlying baseness in the form of imaginative experience what then becomes of ethical progress and of the preponderance of good over evil that we are so often assured is the supreme characteristic of great art Perhaps the Chinese with their refusal to affirm the value of life either good or evil are right after all  Prosperity and decay each have their season  Success is bitter when it is slow in coming  Man s life is not metal or stone   He cannot far prolong the days of his fate Suddenly he follows in the way of things that change Fame is the only treasure that endures  The vanity of existence this thought so repellant to our occidental minds that we have tacked an optimistic conclusion in Ecclesiastes made of Job a tragedy instead of what it is a quite common experience and declared that Shakespeare s mind was jangled and out of tune with itself when he wrote Measure for Measure Timon of Athens and Troilus and Cressida the vanity and the nothingness of existence this is the one fundamental idea that all these Chinese poets accept quite comfortably and complacently And just because they do accept it they make most of our western poetry seem like silly mouthing and wasted sound and fury They do not pretend to unravel the dark scheme of things to discover any external meaning in the mysteries of life birth death hunger sorrow lust and sleep But just because they accept without questioning their eyes are opened and they see clearly  Cliffs that rise a thousand feet Without a break Lake that stretches a hundred miles Without a wave Sands that are white through all the year Without a stain Pine tree woods winter and summer Ever green Streams that for ever flow and flow Without a pause Trees that for twenty thousand years Your vows have kept You have suddenly healed the pain of a traveller s heart And moved his brush to write a new song   Perfume of Cathay  They are human these Chinese poets and it is just because they set no store upon anything but nature and humanity that they regard an humble cottage a cup of wine a friend and a good talk as the summum bonum of existence It is when they have to part with one of these things that they lacerate our hearts  Sad sad lean with long illness Monotonous monotonous days and nights pass The summer trees have clad themselves in shade The autumn lan already houses the dew The eggs that lay in the nest when I took to my bed Have changed into little birds and flown away The worm that then lay hidden in its hole Has hatched into a cricket sitting on the tree The four Seasons go on for ever and ever In all nature nothing stops to rest Even for a moment Only the sick man s heart Deep down still aches as of old  Of Mr Waley s qualifications as a translator I say nothing Let these extracts speak for themselves As regards his selection there are some objections to be made It is a pity that someone as well equipped as he is does not give us a more complete and exhaustive selection from say half a dozen poets rather than a miscellaneous collection ranging over centuries It is true that Mr Waley has tried to do this notably in the case of Po Chu I But he has made a serious mistake by giving us a superabundance of this author s satires which I find dull and crammed with obscure historical allusions and of his reflective pieces which represent him as only an affectionate garrulous old man but omitting all mention of the Everlasting Wrong and the Lute Girl except to say that their author set little store by either It   may be true that in his old age Po Chü I thought so but the fact remains that both were written by him and that the former especially is one of the finest poems ever written in Chinese or any other language  Mr Waley makes amends for this slip by giving us twelve poems by Tao Chien which convince us that this great recluse who despised the court could not crook the hinges of his back for a peck of rice a day and preferred to grow chrysanthemums in obscurity rather than be a minister of state was one of the supreme poets of China every word of whose work should be studied again and again  So we quit this volume with the conviction that the Chinese poets working on themes that were purely commonplace and saying commonplace things about them nevertheless said all that poetry will ever be capable of saying For twelve or thirteen centuries at least their art remained at its height surely a time long enough in the history of any nation Then it declined became merely a complicated literary exercise a fascinating but empty game of allusions an artificial fabrication instead of a living expression of human emotion It is quite true that the Chinese have produced neither a Homer nor an Aeschylus nor a Shakespeare nor a Tolstoy But we who have all these great men need only soberly consider the state of the world today to wonder whether after all we are any better off for possessing them And the Chinese at least have poetry endless fields of it hundreds of lives that have perfectly expressed themselves in song It is enough for them and perhaps some day   Perfume of Cathay  it will be enough for us also Ex oriente lux some day we may be able to say  Business men boast of their skill and cunning But in philosophy they are like little children Bragging to each other of successful depredations They neglect to consider the ultimate fate of the body What should they know of the master of Dark Truth Who saw the wide world in a jade cup By illumined conception got clear of Heaven and Earth On the chariot of Mutation entered the Gate of Immortality  John Gould Fletcher  NARCISSUS AT WAR  Eidola by Frederic Manning E P Dutton amp Co  Over here we don t know what this English poet looks like but somehow his book suggests a young Narcissus in the trenches It is shot full of beauty and sorrow the beauty of a Greek clarity and the sorrow of an austere shapeliness The book should be read backward for the earlier poems are printed at the end among them the lovely Simaetha finely curved as a vase which POETRY printed in ancient days before the war Even through these runs an undercurrent of sorrow as if the beauty of life were too keen for joy  But Narcissus is not blasted in the trenches no shell destroys him thank heaven and even his ecstasy in beauty survives suffering a sea change under the alchemy of war  But the mean things of the earth hast thou chosen  Decked them with suffering  Made them beautiful with the passion for Tightness  Strong with the pride of love   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Exalted by the passion of Tightness and the pride of love  he finds beauty even here the horror has no power over  him The Sign is an expression of spiritual triumph  We are here in a wood of little beeches  And the leaves are like black lace  Against a sky of nacre  One bough of clear promise Across the moon  It is in this wise that God speaketh unto me He layeth hands of healing upon my flesh Stilling it in an eternal peace Until my soul reaches out myriad and infinite hands Toward him And is eased of its hunger  And I know that this passes This implacable fury and torment of men As a thing insensate and vain And the stillness hath said unto me Over the tumult of sounds and shaken flame Out of the terrible beauty of wrath  I alone am eternal  One bough of clear promise Across the moon  Yet there are vividly realistic pictures of a soldier s life  in Grotesque Leaves The Trenches A Shell The Trans  port full of the splendor of two stallions and that bitterly  tragic detail of death The Face  It would be unfair to quote only from the war poems if  some of the best of the earlier ones were not familiar to our  readers Ganhardine is a lovely song in rhyme and To Sai  gives us the very soul of a little child H M   Another Soldier poet  ANOTHER SOLDIER POET  The Old Huntsman by Siegfried Sassoon E P Dutton  amp Co  After the wartime fervor has died away how much will be left of the war poets It is by no means an easy task for the critic to say since he too is under the emotional spell and if he were not one would suspect him of being lacking in human sympathy and so lacking in what is most essential in criticism It is much better therefore to err on the side of being over generous than it is to be niggardly in one s appreciation of those poets who have not only written of the war but lived it What is good will outlast the war and what is bad will die with it  Mr Siegfried Sassoon if one may judge by the opening poem presumably an early one had not really qualified as a poet until he experienced war The Old Huntsman is in the manner of Wilfrid Wilson Gibson and has the same monologuish monotony the same sort of aloof class patronizing that one finds in many of Mr Gibson s pieces Not that Mr Gibson is a snob or has this class feeling quite the reverse it is rather the conscious effort to overcome it as it were that characterizes his work as it does that of Mr Galsworthy also But it is not at all in this spirit that Mr Sassoon writes of his comrades at arms by which it may be perceived that he has made progress towards democracy and poetry at one bound In A Subaltern Stand to Good Friday Morning Conscripts or Died of Wounds one gets vivid sharp realistic trench or hospital scenes and charac   ters and one feels no gulf between the poet and the character or scene Both are involved and the result is conviction without theatricality Yet after all it is hard to tell how many of these will outlast our fresh memory of the war they have somewhat the quality of the press dispatch or the war photograph they will always be interesting but it is poems like Absolution A Mystic as Soldier and Secret Music that really prove Mr Sassoon a poet of more intrinsic worth and one from whom we may hope much after the war Here is A Mystic as Soldier  I lived mv days apart Dreaming fair songs for God By the glory in my heart Covered and crowned and shod  Now God is in the strife And I must seek him there Where death outnumbers life And fury smites the air  I walk the secret way With anger in my brain O music through my clay When will you sound again  Another hopeful sign in Mr Sassoon s work is his healthy reaction to the sentimental values of war mostly insisted upon by those not in the trenches as in They or Stand to Perhaps this applied to his own work may counteract certain Georgian influences in it which do not seem all for the best A C H  CORRESPONDENCE  AN ENGLISH POET ON POETRY  Dear Editor I resent any attacks made in England on your exquisite and ably edited magazine POETRY of Chicago It is full of daring and lovely experiment and achievement  For example I find the work of H D and Max Michelson very beautiful and sincerely think that numbers of American artists are ahead in the mass of ours  There are as you are of course aware a number of similar experiments in metre and feeling going on in Italy and France among the younger men I could give you many names interesting as those of R Aldington Ezra Pound or R Frost And as an old contributor to the Saturday Review perhaps I may say that poetical criticism in England just now from a number of social causes is at a very low level It has never as compared with France been generally high in England  The English after fifty or sixty years have for instance still not the faintest idea of how great a poet they possessed how Greek an artist in Matthew Arnold He is still thought to be far inferior to Tennyson whereas Tennyson compared to Arnold was a talented child who grew up into a venal muddler of the Millais standard He was a considerable man as an artist he had no trace of greatness about him So bad is English natural taste so confused that it took nearly three hundred years or so till about   1771 the date of the publication of Mackenzie s Man of Feeling and of course Mackenzie was a Scotchman be fore English published criticism noticed that there was anything in the least remarkable or subtle about Shakespeare s handling of the character of Hamlet This was unobserved by the best English critics Dryden Pope Addison and Johnson  We are in the art of literature a people vital but coarse stupid and exceedingly confused We live in a draughty channel between the continental and the insular Our mind is always in what is called a tide up rough waters like those at the meeting of the streams of the North Sea and the Atlantic off Dover  Off Dover you must know there is never the normal eight minutes of slack water at the turning of flow into ebb There is always a mad churning between two seas And England is always in a witch s reel between Hebraism and Hellenism materialism commercial cynicism against social reform political wealth against popular poverty At present England is exhausted by her massive political effort to transform herself into a self directed and perfectly free nation She is extremely noble a great nation but she has at present apparently no intelligence or fine leisure of feeling left over after the shock of parties and of armies in which to practice or adequately to criticise the finest of the fine arts She has for example and this we owe to an admixture of savage inertia into Philistine Puritanism no National Theatre And her living poets must endow her   An English Poet on Poetry  with beauty in her own despite They should expect no reward for they will certainly receive none why should they fare better than Shakespeare Arnold Shelley or Blake And perhaps that is best One may remember Athenian treatment of Socrates and Pheidias and be patient with our people They do not know that the beautiful is hard Herbert Trench  Settignano Italy Dec 2nd 1918 A CORRECTION  Alice Corbin regrets that the final version of her poem Song of Sunlight arrived from Santa Fe too late for revision of the text last month We record it here in order that subscribers may enter the change in their copies The final stanza should read  Sunlight I am mad with your light Rocks earth I have never known you before Suns you are powdered like rocks In my body Earth your red canyons Are sluiced through me The crests of your hills Break over me I ride upward to meet them   ANNOUNCEMENTS  A NEW PRIZE  Mr S King
