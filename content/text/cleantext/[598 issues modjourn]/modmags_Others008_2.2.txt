Veils of clarity reveal sand glistening— falling away to an edge— sliding beneath the advancing ripples. TRACT I will teach you my townspeople how to perform a funeral— for you have it over a troop of artists— 140 WILLIAM  CARLOS WILLIAMS unless one should scour the world— you have the ground sense necessary. See! the hearse leads I begin with a design for a hearse. For Christ's sake not black— nor white either— and not polished! Let it be weathered— like a farm wagon— with gilt wheels (this could be applied fresh at small expense) or no wheels at all a rough dray to drag over the ground. Knock the glass out! My God—glass, my townspeople! For what purpose? Is it for the dead to look out or for us to see how well he is housed or to see WILLIAM  CARLOS WILLIAMS 141 the flowers or the lack of them— or what? To keep the rain and snow from him? he will have a heavier rain soon— pebbles and dirt and what not— let there be no glass and no upholstery phew! And no little brass rollers and small easy wheels on the bottom— my townspeople what are you thinking of? A rough plain hearse then with gilt wheels and no top at all. On this the coffin lies by its own weight. No wreaths please— especially no hot house flowers. Some common memento is better 142 WILLIAM  CARLOS WILLIAMS something he prized and is known by: his old clothes— a few books perhaps God knows what! You realize how we are about these things my townspeople— something will be found— anything even flowers if he had to come to that. So much for the hearse— for heaven's sake tho' see to the driver! Take off the silk hat! In fact that's no place at all for him— up there unceremoniously dragging our friend out to his own dignity. Bring him down— bring him down! Low and inconspicuous! I'd not have him ride WILLIAM  CARLOS WILLIAMS 143 on the wagon at all— damn him— the undertaker's understrapper ! Let him hold the reins and walk at the side and inconspicuously too. Then briefly as to yourselves: walk behind— as they do in France, seventh class, or if you ride Hell take curtains ! Go with some show of inconvenience— sit openly— to the weather as to grief. Or do you think you can shut grief in— what—from us ? We who have perhaps nothing to lose? Share with us share with us— it will be money in your pocket— remember that, and ## 144 WILLIAM  CARLOS WILLIAMS this: there is one land— and your two feet are sucked down so hard on it that you cannot raise them— where men are truly equal for they all have nothing. Go now, I think you are ready. TOUCHE The murderer's little daughter who is barely ten years old jerks her shoulders right and left so as to catch a glimpse of me without turning round. Her skinny little arms wrap themselves this way then that reversely about her body!## WILLIAM  CARLOS WILLIAMS 145 Nervously she crushes her straw hat about her eyes and tilts her head to deepen the shadow— smiling excitedly ! As best she can she hides herself in the full sunlight her cordy legs writhing beneath the little flowered dress that leaves them bare from mid-thigh to ankle— Why has she chosen me for the knife that darts along her smile? TO A SOLITARY DISCIPLE Rather notice, mon cher, that the moon is tilted above the point of the steeple than that its color is shell-pink. Rather observe ## 146 WILLIAM  CARLOS WILLIAMS that it is early morning than that the sky is smooth as a turquoise. Rather grasp how the dark converging lines of the steeple meet at the pinnacle—; perceive how its little ornament tries to stop them ! See how it fails ! See how the converging lines of the hexagonal spire escape upward receding, dividing ! —sepals that guard and contain the flower ! Observe how motionless the eaten moon lies in the protecting lines. It is true: in the light colors of the morning brown-stone and slate shine orange and dark blue ## WILLIAM  CARLOS  WILLIAMS 147 but observe the oppressive weight of the squat edifice ! observe the jasmine lightness of the moon! EPIGRAMME Hast ever seen man Dig gold in a manure heap? Then open two eyes For digging among these, Our fellow townsmen, I turn up this nugget. ## 148 ALFRED KREYMBORG CONVENTION Beware of a pirate who will scuttle your ship, a cross-eyed toothless pirate! I'll blow my great horn, carved of dead men's skulls, right down your ear and freeze you. I'll stick my big thumb into your eye and my knife clean through your throat. I'll pull out my goblet and drink your blood while my foot rests on your belly. I'll laugh a loud laugh that'll shunt your soul to hell and spit on your face for an epitaph. I'll kick your carcass to its coffin, the sea, a sea that won't sing even a dirge for you. Then I'll yank down the flag that you hoisted up so high and raise the devil's own instead. Beware of a pirate who will scuttle your ship, a cross-eyed toothless pirate ! I crawl aboard when your sails begin to fail— the sails that are blown by the strength of your will. ## ALFRED KREYMBORG 149 MAN TELLS Do you love that woman, sir? Yes, that which I make of her. Isn't she most beautiful? Yes, because I think her so. Hasn't she the best of hearts? Yes, because I want it so. Then there might be more like her? Yes, the one you love. WOMAN TELLS I know that you do, but— when last did you tell me? I know that you gave, but— what roses and roses ! I know that you will, but— such kisses to go ! I know, yes, I know, but— Begin ! VISTA The snow, ah yes, ah yes indeed, is white and beautiful, white and beautiful, verily beautiful— from my window. The sea, ## 150 ALFRED KREYMBORG ah yes, ah yes indeed, is green and alluring, green and alluring, verily alluring— from the shore. Love, ah yes, ah yes, ah yes indeed, verily yes, ah yes indeed ! THE WHIP OF THE UNBORN It is not she who rends me so— no, it is not she. These eves are not hers that hate me so— no, they are not hers. Nor this her breath that flaunts me, nor these her arms that strangle— no, these are not hers. It is not I who rends me so— no, it is not I. This heart is not mine that goads me on— no, this is not mine. Nor these my thoughts that flay me, nor this my soul that sneers me down— no, these are not mine. Nor that her whip that lashes me, nor that my whip that lashes me— no, this is not ours. ## ALFRED KREYMBORG 151 LITTLE FOLK Of late, I've been craving a child, the adoption of a child. Not a child of mine— I have so little blood for that, and that requires two— but an ordinary child, like myself, who will be serious with me, playfully, and play with me, seriously— I have quarts of blood for that. Little One: Will you adopt me? IN THE NEXT ROOM And over there sat a beautiful child, a child with a beautiful face, a child with beautiful hands ; but its body was deformed, its eyes were deeply melancholy. It smiled from time to time: its mouth smiled, but its eyes remained melancholy; ## 152 ALFRED KREYMBORG its cheeks smiled, but its eyes remained melancholy; its brows smiled, but its eyes remained melancholy; mouth, cheeks, brows, its whole face smiled— but its eyes remained unchanged. In the next room, they were playing Schubert. TO H. S. Those people out there moving about in mist, dancing mist, dancing blue-gray mist, gravely gay dancing mist— (or do they do the dancing?) are always coming so close to you, you're always going so close to them— but you never touch. Don't you love them? Queer beautiful things. Mist people. Moving mist people. Dancing mist people. You ought to— you're one of them.## ALFRED KREYMBORG 153 EARTH WISDOM Said the earth: I love you, flower. Go up and see the sun. And feel the rain—it's soft. Winds will play with you, merry winds. But see that great blue— I like that round blue— I want that high blue— Said the earth: I love you, flower. It is late. Come back to me. I don't want to— I wont— I want the moon— I want— You've been playing too long, flower. That isn't good for you. Nor fair to the morrow. Come, said the earth. ## 154 ALFRED  KREYMBORG IMPROVISATION Wind: Why do you play that long beautiful adagio, that archaic air, to-night ? Will it never end? Or is it the beginning, some prelude you seek? Is it a tale you strum? Yesterday, yesterday— Have you no more for us? Wind: Play on. There is nor hope nor mutiny in you. A SWORD A million-bladed sword, slashing the petty pates and sticking the smug stomachs of the past till the pink blood dribble and, with a roar of ribald song, a whirlwind of naked dance, flaunting the laughing boyish present on a pike against the stare and whisper of the doddering future a sword is love ! ## ALFRED  KREYMBORG 155 TOWARD LOVE That beauty has begun to fall out of step is no excuse, that others have begun their skulking to the rear is no excuse, you who are beginning to compromise or to seek Some Other. Crucify Nature ! TO W. C. W. M. D. Use black japalac on your coffins, W. C. W. M. D. Long before the cemetery dirge it dries, there is no shine, it mummifies death as black should do. His religion isn't black, some nuance harmonious with the nose of the deceased— on some boxes a baby blue would do, but not on yours. On yours yellow and orange nasturtium with a grain of red earth ! And a design, sir, six lanky grasshoppers with knees and toes a-jump— W. C. W. M. D., on yours let's have a design ! ## 156 SKIPWITH  CANNELL IKONS 1 I broke a savage bitch who has two tails. I named her 'Beauty' from a beast in Mythology. We cannot live in the houses of other men, We cannot breathe air from their sick bellies; I will travel into lonely places To laugh and think new thoughts. 2 I have been all wrong from the beginning. I will re-create myself. I will be right. ## SKIPWITH  CANNELL 157 But I'm in too great haste to pluck lice away. 3 Let others wash me, serve food to me And cleanse my pot. I cannot be a pot-man. How can I serve? How can I be kind or unkind And myself. I can be neither more kind nor less kind Than a meteor Falling in a city. Let the pot-men fester in the filth of their pots: I must uncover God's feet for the dancing. ## 158 SKIPWITH  CANNELL 1 A fool once said to me, "How strange it is that you are Glad and drunken." I have burned a thousand things Desirable but not mine. I will not dance before God with my privates swathed in cloth. 2 We young men come up from our beginnings crying, "Way! Make way for us!" The old ones stand against us Like lions who are old and angry. One by one they fall Under our feet. Behind us the land is flat Save for ghosts and the stone giants. ## SKIPWITH  CANNELL 159 3 Some day the young men Will come upon me Crying, "Down with him! Down with him!" I long for the day when the young men Come against me. To try our strength. 1 I have owed much to older people. Why should I deny it? To Nietszche and Mrs. Eddy and Blake and Whitman and Gauguin and those old Egyptians who cut for eternity. I shall pass over some of these. I shall crush them. But I owe much to older people. Why should I deny it? ## 160 SKIPWITH  CANNELL 2 I will gobble up everything That has been mine from the beginning. Though I find it in the homes of other men or in their purses or their thoughts I will gobble up all To the last jot of my own. The man who ploughs fields is right be the fields his or another's, Pot-men are always right and even the masters have ploughed strange fields in their day For myself I am no longer concerned with ploughing, It's for the harvest I yearn, The harvest        the bare land       the full dancing. 3 God made dancing. Only pot-men walk.## SKIPWITH CANNELL 161 The dancers gather at God's table For joy that is drunken. Lead was first smelted From the souls of pot-men. 1 He who pulls flowers wantonly Is a giant. He who pulls flowers for their loveliness or perfume Is one who can destroy giants with the perfume of flowers. I dislike men who sleep with too many women. I despise those loving their own sex. They are wrong   I am right. I do not understand this but it is true. 2 Men wash in their women As gulls in the sea. ## 162 SKIPWITH  CANNELL When they have spewed forth their white children, Though they dislike children, They are happy Pure. I do not understand this but it is true. S I went walking on the beaches. Like sand grains were young men and young women Lying two by two. I went walking on the beaches. With my lantern I looked in the young men's faces, And they were all I. I went walking on the beaches. ## SKIPWITH CANNELL 163 The beaches were empty. They put out the sun like a candle and all the stars the moon and my lantern. A voice cried from the sea, "If I vomit a woman at your feet take her breed children." But I had spent my strength. Then I woke up. 1 A coyote yapping at the moon A wolf grinning at the lightning Is the man of poems Shouting of Him. Him! Him! ## 164 SKIPWITH  CANNELL Glory on a dying fish. Blue flies over the garbage. Him! Him! O jackal sobbing at his loneliness. 2 Moon, demon of the heavens, How great must your hatred be for the peoples of earth. Moon, I have poison, hot and secret. I will give you my poison, devil of the sky. You are crowned with stars. We shall take your crown away. We shall give your crown to the sun because of dawns. O wolf of the sky yapping at your moon. ## SKIPWITH  CANNELL 165 3 I am tired of old colors and old sounds, I will make new sounds with my mouth and they shall be music. I will make new sounds and new jumps and gestures. When women lie down before us, Making soft noises. Our eyes become yellow and we go to them As mad eagles to the sun. Women are green and barreled like guns, Men are red and primed cartridges. I despise everything that is not Green or red. We are red, they green; and their greenness Gives our red value and violence. ## 166 SKIPWITH  CANNELL And when we leave you With softness, With kisses, We are rich   we are selves, When we withdraw Deeply Into the sea. ## ## ##
