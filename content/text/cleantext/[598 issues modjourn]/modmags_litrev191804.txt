BoulevardChicagoTHE LITTLE REVIEW VolVAPRIL1918 No12 THE NOVELS OF DOROTHY RICHARDSON May Sinclair Pointed RoofsBackwaterHoneycomb Duckworth and companyLondon I HAVE been asked to write for this magazine which makes no compromise with the public taste a criticism of the novels of Dorothy RichardsonThe editors of the Little Review are committed to Dorothy Richardson by their declared intentionsfor her works make no sort of compromise with the public tasteIf they are not announced with the same proud challenge it is because the pride of the editors of the Little Review is no mate for the pride of Miss Richardson which ignores the very existence of the public and its tasteI do not know whether this article is or is not going to be a criticismfor so soon as I begin to think what I shall say I find myself criticising criticismwondering what is the matter with it and whatif anythingcan be done to make it betterto make it aliveOnly a live criticism can deal appropriately with a live artAnd it seems to me that the first step towards life is to throw off the philosophic cant of the XIXth CenturyI don t mean that there is no philosophy of Artor that if there has been there is to be no more of itI mean that it is absurd to go on talking about realism and idealismor objective and subjective artas if the philosophies were sticking where they stood in the eightiesIn those days the distinction between idealism and realismbetween subjective and objective was important and preciseAnd so long as the ideas they stand for had importance and precision 4 The Little Review those words were lamps to the feet and lanterns to the path of the criticEven after they had begun to lose precision and importance they still served him as useful labels for the bewildering phenomena of the artsBut now they are beginning to give troublethey obscure the issuesMrJBBeresford in his admirable introduction to Pointed Roofs confesses to having felt this troubleWhen he read it in manuscript he decided that itwas realismwas objective When he read it in typescript he thought this is the most subjective thing I have ever read It is evident thatwhen first faced with the startlingnewnessof Miss Richardson s method and her formthe issues did seem a bit obscure to MrBeresfordIt was as if up to one illuminating moment he had been obliged to think of methods and forms as definitely objective or definitely subjectiveHis illuminating moment came with the third reading when Pointed Roofs was a printed bookThe book itself gave him the clue to his own troublewhich is my troublethe first hint that criticism up till now has been content to think in clichésmissing the new trend of the philosophies of the XXth CenturyAll that we know of reality at first hand is given to us through contacts in which those interesting distinctions are lostReality is thick and deeptoo thick and too deep and at the same time too fluid to be cut with any convenient carving knifeThe novelist who would be close to reality must confine himself to this knowledge at first handHe mustas MrBeresford sayssimplyplunge in MrBeresford also says that Miss Richardson is the first novelist who has plunged inShe has plunged so neatly and quietly that even admirers of her performance might remain unaware of what it is precisely that she has doneShe has disappeared while they are still waiting for the splashSo that MrBeresford s introduction was neededWhen first I read Pointed Roofs and Backwater and Honeycomb I too thoughtlike MrBeresfordthat Miss Richardson has been the first to plungeBut it seems to me rather that she has followedindependentlyperhaps unconsciouslya growing tendency to plungeAs far back as the eighties the de Goncourts plunged completelyfinallyin Soeur PhilomèneGerminie Lacerteux and Les Frères ZemgannoMarguerite Audoux plunged in the best passages of Marie ClaireThe best of every good novelist s best work is a more or less sustained immersionThe more modern the The Little Review 5 novelist the longer his capacity to stay underMiss Richardson has not plunged deeper than MrJames Joyce in his Portrait of the Artist as a Young ManBy imposing very strict limitations on herself she has brought her arther methodto a high pitch of perfectionso that her form seems to be newer than it perhaps isShe herself is unaware of the perfection of her methodShe would probably deny that she has written with any deliberate method at allShe would say I only know there are certain things I mustn t do if I was to do what I wanted Obviouslyshe must not interfereshe must not analyse or comment or explainRather less obviouslyshe must not tell a storyor handle a situation or set a sceneshe must avoid drama as she avoids narrationAnd there are some things she must not beShe must not be the wiseall knowing authorShe must be Miriam HendersonShe must not know or divine anything that Miriam does not know or divineshe must not see anything that Miriam does not seeShe has taken Miriam s nature upon herShe is not concernedin the way that other novelists are concernedwith characterOf the persons who move through Miriam s world you know nothing but what Miriam knowsIf Miriam is mistakenwellshe and not Miss Richardson is mistakenMiriam is an acute observerbut she is very far from seeing the whole of these peopleThey are presented to us in the same vivid but fragmentary way in which they appeared to Miriamthe fragmentary way in which people appear to most of usMiss Richardson has only imposed on herself the conditions that life imposes on all of usAnd if you are going to quarrel with those conditions you will not find her novels satisfactoryBut your satisfaction is not her concernAnd I find it impossible to reduce to intelligible terms this satisfaction that I feelTo me these three novels show an art and method and form carried to punctilious perfectionYet I have heard other novelists say that they have no art and no method and no formand that it is this formlessness that annoys themThey say that they have no beginning and no middle and no endand that to have form a novel must have an end and a beginning and a middleWe have come to words that in more primitive times would have been blows on this subjectThere is a certain plausibility in what they saybut it depends on what constitutes a beginning and a middle and an endIn this series there is no dramano situationThe Little Review no set sceneNothing happensIt is just life going on and onIt is Miriam Henderson s stream of consciousness going on and onAnd in neither is there any grossly discernible beginning or middle or endIn identifying herself with this life which is Miriam s stream of consciousness Miss Richardson produces her effect of being the firstof getting closer to reality than any of our novelists who are trying so desperately to get closeNo attitude or gesture of her own is allowed to come between her and her effectWhatever her sources and her raw materialshe is concerned and we ought to be concerned solely with the finished resultthe work of artIt is to Miriam s almost painfully acute senses that we owe what in any other novelist would be called theportratisof Miriam s motherof her sister Harrietof the Corries and Joey Banks in Honeycombof the Miss Pernes and Julia Doyleand the north London schoolgirls in Backwaterof Fräulein Pfaff and Mademoiselleof the Martins and Emma Bergmann and Ulrica andthe Australianin Pointed RoofsThe mereword paintingis masterly Miriam noticed only the hoarsehacking laugh of the AustralianHer eyes flew up the table and fixed her as she sat laughingher chair drawn backher knees crossed tea was drawing to an endThe detail of her terrifyingly stylish ruddy brown frieze dress with its Norfolk jacket bodice and its shiny leather belt was hardly distinguishable from the dark background made by the folding doorsBut the dreadful outline of her shoulders was visiblethe squarish oval of her face shone outthe wide forehead from which the wiry black hair was combed to a high puffthe red eyesblack nowthe longstraight nosethe widelaughing mouth with the enormous teeth And so on all round the school tea tableIt looks easy enough todountil you try itThere are thirteen figures round that table and each is drawn with the first few strokes and so well that you see them all and never afterwards can you mistake or confuse themYou look at the outer world through Miriam s senses and it is as if you had never seen it so vividly beforeMiriam in Backwater is on the top of a busdriving from North London to Piccadilly On the left a tall grey church was coming towards themThe Little Review 7 spindling up into the skyIt sailed byshowing Miriam a circle of little stone pillars built into its spirePlumy trees streamed bystanding large and separate on moss green grass railed from the roadwayBrightwhite faced houses with pillared porches shone through from behind them and blazed white above them against the blue skyWide side streets openedshowing high balconied housesThe side streets were feathered with trees and ended mistily Away ahead were edges of cleanbright masonry in profilesofttufted

Japanese looking leaves standing as if it were growingin a shallow bowl under the rose shaded lamp It is as if no other writers had ever used their senses so purely and with so intense a joy in their useThis intensity is the effect of an extreme concentration on the thing seen or feltMiss Richardson disdains every stroke that does not tellHer novels are novels of an extraordinary compression and of an extenuation more extraordinary stillThe moments of Miriam s consciousness pass one by oneor overlappingmoments tense with vibrationmoments drawn out finealmost to snapping pointOn one page Miss Richardson seems to be accounting for every minute of Miriam s timeOn another she passes over events that might be considered decisive with the merest slur of referenceShe is not concerned with the strict order of events in timeChapter Three of Pointed Roofs opens with an air of extreme decision and importance Miriam was practising on the piano in the larger of the two English bedrooms as if something hung on her practisingBut nonothing hangs on itand if you want to know on what day she 8 The Little Review is practising you have to read on and back againIt doesn t matterIt is Miriam s consciousness that is going backwards and forwards in timeThe time it goes in is unimportantOn the hundredth page out of three hundred and twelve pages Mirian has been exactly two weeks in

tortuous mind of the pioussentimentalsecretly hysterical Fräuleinbut we knowas Miriam knowsthat before she can bring herself to part with her English governess she must persuade herself that it is

clockThree more hours before the day beganThe other bed was still It s going to be a magnificent day she murmuredpretending to stretch and yawn againA sigh reached herThe stillness went on and she lay for an hour tense and listeningSomeone else must knowAt the end of the hour a descending darkness took her suddenlyShe woke from it to the sound of violent languagefurniture being roughly moveda swiftangry splash The Little Review 9 ing of watersomething breaking outbreaking through the confinements of this little furniture filled roomthe best gentlest thing she knew openly despairing at last Here Miss Richardsongetsyou as she gets you all the time she never misses onceby her devout adhesion to her methodby the sheer depth of her plungeFor this and this alone is the way things happenWhat we used to call theobjectivemethod is a method of after thoughtof spectacular reflectionWhat has happened has happened in Miriam s bedroomif you likebut only by reflectionThe firsthandintimate and intense reality of the happening is in Miriam s mindand by presenting it thus and not otherwise Miss Richardson seizes reality aliveThe intense rapidity of the seizure defies you to distinguish between what is objective and what is subjective either in the reality presented or the art that presentsNothing happensIn Miriam Henderson s life there isapparentlynothing to justify livingEverything she ever wanted was either withheld or taken from herShe is reduced to the barest minimum on which it is possible to support the life of the senses and the emotions at allAnd yet Miriam is happyHer inexhaustible passion for life is fedNothing happensand yet everything that really matters is happeningyou are held breathless with the anticipation of its happeningWhat really matters is a state of mindthe interest or the ecstasy with which we close with lifeIt can t be explainedTo quote MrBeresford again explanation in this connection would seem to imply knowledge that only the mystics can faintly realise But Miss Richardson s is a mysticism apartIt is compatible withit even encourages such dialogue as this Teasmiled Eve serenely All rightI m comingdamn youaren t IOhMimmyWelldamn methenSomebody in the house must swearI sayEveWhat Nothingonly I say Um It is not wholly destroyed when Miriam eats bread and butter thus When she began at the hard thick edge there always seemed 10 The Little Review to be tender places on her gumsher three hollow teeth were uneasy and she had to get through worrying thoughts about them they would get worse as the years went byand the little places in the front would grow big and painful and disfiguringAfter the first few mouthfuls of solid bread a sort of padding seemed to take place and she could go on forgetful This kind of thing annoys KensingtonI do not say that it really matters but that it is compatible with what really mattersBecause of such passages it is a pity that Miss Richardson could not use the original title of her series Pilgrimage for it shows what she is really afterEach book marks a stage in Miriam s pilgrimageWe get the first hint of where she is going to in the opening of the tenth chapter of Pointed Roofs Into all the gatherings at Waldstrasse the outside world came like a presenceIt removed the sense of pressureof being confronted and challengedEverything that was said seemed to be incidental to itlike remarks dropped in a low tone between individuals at a great conference In Backwater the author s intention becomes still clearerIn Honeycomb it is transparently clear Her room was a great square of happy lighthappyhappyShe gathered up all the sadness she had ever known and flung it from herAll the dark things of the past flashed with a strange beauty as she flung them outThe light had been there all the timebut she had known it only at momentsNow she knew what she wantedBright morningsbeautiful bright roomsa wilderness of beauty all round her all the time at any cost And yet not that Something that was not touchedthat sang far away down inside the gloomthat cared nothing for the creditors and could get away down and down into the twilight far away from the everlasting accusations of humanity Deeper down was something cool and freshendless an endless gardenIn happiness it came up and made everything in the world into a gardenSorrow blotted it outbut it was always therewaiting and looking onIthad looked on in Germany and had loved the music and the words and the happiness of the German girlsand at Banbury Parkgiving her no peace until she got away And now it

Little Review 27 contact with numerouspresses I may say frankly that their actual physical demise would give me no painbut on the contraryAs long as they exist in the flesh they will go on deadening

the Unanimiiste AestheticorPathétique 28 The Little Review that one will do more to disabuse readers misled by stupid English criticism than would any amount of talk about RomainsI let him speak for himselfReflexionsMany people are now ready to recognize that there are in the world beings more real than manWe admit the life of entities greater than our own bodiesSociety is not merely an arithmetical totalor a collective designationWe even credit the existence of groups intermediate between the individual and the stateBut these opinions are put forth by abstract deduction or by experimentation of reasonPeople employ them to complete a system of things and with the complacencies of analogyIf they do not follow a serious study of social datathey are at least the most meritorious results of observationsthey justify the methodand uphold the laws of a science which struggles manfully to be scientificThese fashions of knowing would seem both costly and tenuousMan did not wait for physiology to give him a notion of his bodyin which lack of patience he was intelligentfor physiology has given him but analytic and exterior information concernng things he had long known from withinHe had been conscious of his organs long before he had specified their modes of activityAs spirals of smoke from village chimneysthe profound senses of each organ had mounted toward himjoysorrowall the emotions are deeds more fully of consciousness than are the thoughts of man s reasonReason makes a concept of manbut the heart perceives the flesh of his bodyIn like manner we must know the groups that englobe usnot by observation from withoutbut by an organic consciousnessAnd it is by no means sure that the rhythms will make their nodes in usif we be not the centres of groupsWe have but to become suchDig deep enough in our beingemptying it of individual reveriesdig enough little canals so that the souls of the groups will flow of necessity into usThe Little Review 29 I have attempted nothing else in this bookVarious groups have come here into consciousnessThey are still rudimentaryand their spirit is but a perfume in the airBeings with as little consistence as la Rue du Havreand la Place de la Bastileephemeral as the company of people in an omnibusor the audience at l Opéra Comiquecan not have complex organism or thoughts greatly elaboratePeople will think it superfluous that I should unravel such shreds in place of rëcarding once more the enormous heap of the individual soulYet I think the groups arein the most agitated stage of their evolutionFuture groups will perhaps deserve less affectionand we shall conceal the basis of things more effectivelyNow the incomplete and unstable contours have not yet learned to stifle any tendencyany inclination Every impact sets them floatingThey do not coat the infantile matter with an hard or impacting envelopeA superior plant has realized but few of the possibilites swarming in fructificatory mouldA mushroom leads one more directly to the essential life quality than do the complexities of the oaktreeThus the groups prepare more future than is strictly requiredThus we have the considerable happiness of watching the commencement of reignthe beginning of an organic series which will last as did othersfor a thousand agesbefore the cooling of the earthThis is not a progressionit is a creationthe first leap out of a different seriesGroups will not continue the activities of animalsnor of menthey will start things afresh according to their own needand as the consciousness of their substance increases they will refashion the image of the worldThe men who henceforth can draw the souls of groups to converge within themselveswill give forth the coming dreamand will gatherto bootcertain intuitions of human habitOur ideas of the being will undergo a correctionwill hesitate rather more in finding a distinction between the existent and non existentIn passing successively from the Place de l Europe to the Place des Vogesand then to a gang of navvies one perceives that there are numerous shades of difference between nothing and somethingBefore resorting to groups one is sure of discerning a being of a simple ideaOne knows that a dog existsthat he has an interior and independent unityone knows 30 The Little Review that a table or a mountain does not existnothing but our manner of speech cuts it off from the universal non existingBut streets demand all shades of verbal expressionfrom the non existingup to the autonomous creatureOne ceases to believe that a definite limit is the indispensible means of existenceWhere does la Place de la Trinité beginThe streets mingle their bodiesThe squares isolate themselves with great difficultyThe crowd at the theatre takes on no contour until it has lived for some timeand with vigourA beingêtrehas a centreor centres in harmonybut a being is not compelled to have limitsHe exists a great deal in one placerather less in othersand further on a second being commences before the first has left offEvery being hassomewhere in spaceits maximumOnly ancestered individuals possess affirmative contoursa skin which cuts them off from the infiniteSpace is no one s possessionNo being has succeeded in appropriating one scrap of space and saturating it with his own unique existenceEverything over crossescoincidesand

themHow can we go on thinking that an individual is a solitary thing which is borngrowsreproduces itself and diesThis is a superior and inveterate manner of being an individualBut groups are not truly bornTheir life makes and unmakes itself like an unstable state of mattera condensation which does not endureThey show us that lifeat its originis a provisory attitudea moment of exceptionan intensity between two relaxationsnot continuitynothing decisiveThe first entireties take life by a sort of slow successand extinguish themselves without catastrophethe single elements do not perish because the

book against women tilts not against any recorded womannot against and woman that he ever met or against any individual who is chronicled in historyNohe sets up a simulacruma being that never was either upon the land or in the seaHe sets up the Eternal Feminine an indefinableincomprehensible entity whom he proclaimsafter having set it upto be incapable of any human function save that of motherhoodFor motherhood he entertains a profound contemptIt is rather touching to consider in this connection that the last writing of Schopenhauer was a short poem in praise of the Virgin Mary as the symbol of maternityBut no doubt DrWein There is an unbreakable link between the mother and childphysicallike the cord that united the two before childbirthThis is the real nature of the maternal relationand for my partI protest against the fashion in which it is praisedits very indiscriminate character being made a meritI believe myself that many great artists have recognised thisbut have chosen to be silent about itThe extraordinary over praising of Raphael is losing ground and the singers of maternal love are no higher than Fishchart or Richepin The Little Review 55 inger did not read Schopenhauer as attentively as all that comes toWhat then does this subtle and intangible simulacrum of Femininity amount toNo one has seen herno one has given her a nameno one has touched herShe is as elusive as the Holy Grail as to which even the knights who sought it through the ages were uncertain whether it was the divine blood or the vessel which contained itShe isthi stype of the Eternal Feminineas vanished as the lost continent of Atlantes or the islands of the HesperidesOf this Unknown Woman we have no clear conceptionWeininger wrote her down as W xand we all of us have a strong conception of her negativesWe all of us know what she isn tThus she isn t truthfulisn t steadfastisn t strong can t in fact be trusted not to read our postcardsBut when it comes to defining what she is we have none of us the vaguest settled ideaWe have ideas that are constantly or that are very infrequently being unsettledIt is a matter of one sex passion or anotherThe men who talk about women are men rendered sensitive to some individual by the passion of love or by the passion of jealousyThe women who talk about women are women rendered sensitive by the passion of jealousy or the passion of greedOtherwise we all live together without troubling very much about the complementary sexIf we are menwe mightsupposing us to be roused to it we might venture some vague generalities as to womenSupposing us to be women in a similar way we might utter some vague generalities as to menWe might say that you can never trust a man when he is out of your sightalthough every woman is constantly and with perfect rightness trusting some man or other who may be leagues awayIn a small way DrWeininger analyses the entity of one womanpersistently Schopenhauer analysed the characters of his mother and of his housekeeperHeine on the other hand projected for us quite a number of entirely different individuals who happened to attract himSo did Shakespeareso did George Meredith who is said to be the greatest portrayer of women that the world has ever seenBut there cannot be any doubt that the great bulk of humanity is entirely indifferent to the subjectIt thinks it isn t but it isIt is indifferent to this extentEvery man or every woman of the modern world has a certain 56 The Little Review number usually a very limited number of passionate experiencesDuring those moments of passion the man or the woman will be alive to the member of the opposite sex who for the time being attracts himHe or she may or may not be alive to any members of either sex who stand in the way or who help him or her to attain to the satisfaction of his or her desiresButonce those desires are satisfied the curiosity dies downIt is dead until a new passion is awakenedThusthe normal human beingbeing reasonably constantthe amount of curiosity as to the opposite sex the amount of time during which this curiosity prevails is by comparison very short indeedThe periodof coursevaries in different nations and it is difficult to arrive at any data other than those afforded by public statisticswhichin the nature of thingsignore psychologyBut roughly speaking in England the average marrying age is 24 and the number of divorce cases is about three per cent of the marriages that take placeSupposing then the average age of puberty to be fourteenwe may take it that that the duration of curiosity as to the opposite sex is about ten years of a man or a woman s lifeandputting the average duration of life throughout the western world at sixty years we find that the actual duration of personal curiosity as to either opposing sex is about 1 6 16 6of the total duration of life In the remaining 83 3of our lives we are as a rule not prompted to any special curiosity as to members of the opposite sexI am of course aware that these figuresthough they are statistically correctare not really to be relied upon as a statement of factBut they are really nearer the mark than some observers might hastily concludeFor instance in almost every civilised country there is a more or less great outcry to the effect that divorce is greatly on the increase and this is held to be evidence of the fact that all civilised nations are indulging in what is generally called a pandemonium of viceor of whatfor the purposes of this argumentit is more scientific to term sexual curiosityBut if the reader will consider the immense industrial population of Englandthe equally immense agricultural populations of GermanyFranceand Russianot to mention the United States to these almost un numbered millions of men and women who are much too hard worked to indulge in any kind of pandemoniumor indeed in any kind of mental curiosity at all the reader will perceive how unconsidered any such verdict must The Little Review 57 And during our periods of quiescenceof normalitywe have whether of Women or of Men our indefinite vision of the Eternal Feminine or of the Egregious Male only our indefinite imageOf course there are men who are perpetually interested in the chase after new women just as there are women who only become alive when a man is in the roomAnd indeed I have generally heard it observed that English women are vastly more interested in men than are their German sistersjust as French women are said to be more interested in men than are the EnglishAnd indeedas far as my personal observation has gone I am inclined to agree with this general impressionNevertheless in each case the approximate result is the sameThe view that the English woman has ofa Manmay differ from those of the Frenchthe Germans or the Russiansbut it is nevertheless largely a view of an object that never existed a view of an abstractionAnd there are of course a great many abstractionsThere is no knowing what type of Abstract Man you will notif you are a womanselect as your normal male beingSupposing thatin the home of your childhood the particularHewas always being held up to youby your motheryour nurse and your female servantsas somebody grossnegligentself indulgent the person who always left his slippers in the drawing roomIn that case the odds are that you will for the rest of your life regard the normal man as something clumsystupid and wanting in what you will consider to be female finenessdelicacy and intuitionAnd this will be your normal vision of ManFrom time to time you will be in the quickened condition in which you will really pay some attention to the idiosyncrasies of some few particular menRoughly speakingwhile you are at your boarding or your high school you will find prevailing among your school fellows an extraordinarya vivid curiosity not so much regarding the nature of men as regarding the mysteries of sexThis curiosity you may or you may not sharebut whether you share it or no you will have beso that the figures I have quoted may stand as a convenient image for the comprehension of an almost indisputable factOf course the marriage age is much later in Germanyjust as the age of puberty arrives earlier in the more Southern Countries of EuropeButone contention pulling one way and another anotherthe image remains fairly unaffected58 The Little Review no means of satisfying itYour mother will hardly give you any details and certainly not your fatherIn the nature of things you will be kept more or less rigidly from contact with the male animalYou may or may not know a certain number of the animal called boysPossiblyif you go to foreign convent school you may have waved your handkerchief to the boys in the gymnasium oppositeYou may have or you may notbut you will be aware that some such practice exists among the morefastgirls of the schoolsButeven supposing that a boyhaving thrown a note over the convent wall or whatever happens to take the place of the convent wall in surrounding you and supposing that you actually make the acquaintance of the human boy you will not really begin your investigations of the maleYou will gather certain definite factssuch as that a boy will offer you chocolate creams that he takes out of his trouser pocketsIn the same pocket he will probably have a large clasp knifea ball of stringseveral coppersa number of horse chestnuts for playing the game called conkers and several pieces of slate pencilBut this will not strike you as necessary evidence of untidynessfor in your own pocket you also will have chocolate creamsa silver pencil casea handkerchiefa little note booka fountain pen and no doubt two or three hair pins with which you will have been making surreptitious and premature experiments in what is known asputting your hair up You will hear from your school mates that the creatures calledBoysare something different from yourselfbut actually you will not observe much differenceYou will notI meanobserve it for yourselfOf course there will be the obvious difference of trousers and skirtsButif you inquire into the differences of life and character which you will probably not do you will observe that the human boy is very much like yourselfNowadays he plays cricket when you play cricket and football when you play hockeyIn your classes you will read precisely the same text books as heyou will go in for the same junior examinationsyou will bird s nest when he bird s nestsyou will collect stamps when he collects stampsyou will probably be a little more advanced in your studiesYou will probably be in the lower fourth while he is still in the upper thirdYou will probably hear with resentment that he regards you with traditional contemptsaying that you aresoft You will probably on these occasions want to get at a boy The Little Review 59 of your own size and weightBut on the rare occasions when you really do have a fight with a boy you will find that you are severely handicappedHe can always pull your long hairHe probably will pull your hair and this is almost the only lasting impression that you will get of the human male until you leave schoolYou will remain under that impressionit will continue deep down in you for long afterwards the impression that boy s do not fight fairI do not know whether you are in the right or in the wrong in having this ideaIt isyou seea matter of standardsCivilised nations do not use dum dum bullets against civilised nationsbut they do against savagesAnd I fancy that the nicest boy in the world would imagine that any girl who could really tackle him must be an unnatural sort of animalHe would consider her as a sort of wild catwho had to be killed somehowNothing in the world would persuade this boy to depart from the absolute strictness of the Queensberry rules if he were fighting against another boyeven if the other boy were twice his sizeWhy I remember fighting an immense boy from another schoolhe must have been at least sixteen when I was twelveI stood up and was knocked downBut it never entered my head during the thirty five minutes that the contest lasted that I had such a thing as feet or nails or that he had such a thing as awindbeneath which to strike or hair that one could pullI couldn t have done itit would have been unthinkableNevertheless I am quite certain thathad one of my female cousins of about the same age dared to stand up to me I should have kicked herSo thataccording to his own lights the boy who pulled your hair probably considered that he was fighting with a most perfect fairnessYou seeyou were a sort of outlawa slave that had ventured to rebelNevertheless it is probable thatas a result of your school experiences you carried

fatherThe period of courtship being accompanied by various derangements of the nerves that are due to material and physical conditionsyou will observe in your man certain greater or less manifestations of irritability and of unreasonablenessYou will also observeif he is at all worth having as a suitora tendency to grandiloquenceto boastfulness that almost amounts to megalomaniaHe will offer you the starsa peerage or an illustrious future such as his present circumstances render in no way probableYou will as likely as not deduce from this fact the generalization that all men are boastful or at least are visionary creaturesOr it might be more exact to say that your lover s charming visionschronic as they are to such a period of human existence that these visions you will not

Friday comes he finds himself detained at the office by a piece of work that will enable him to add the4 000 to your common stockOr supposing that in January he says that he will take you to the Riviera in Novemberwhereas in November his uncle diesleaving him the heir to à large estate so that he has to stop in England to arrange for the funeral and the succession dutiesWhat will be your state of mindIt will be as follows to all intents and purposesYou will not particularly observe that your man has gained the 4 000 or the succession to the estateIn your mind that will be perfectly normal and no more than you had expected of himBut the fact that he didn t take you to that theatre on the Friday or to the Riviera in November those facts will remain in your mindThey will go to building up one large proposition that all men 62 The Little Review are unreliablePerhaps your own particular man will not leave his slippers in the drawing roomBut that you will regard as an exceptionPerhaps even he will make a wonderfully brilliant careerBut the most brilliant of careers comes so slowly and seems so natural in its comingthat you will hardly observe itYou willbe engaged on a long journey through the deserts of life with this solitary companionYou will remember as a rule when he fails to please you and you will put that down to his sexOn the other hand you will ignore the fact that he keeps you throughout your life in a standard of very decent comfort that you do nothing in the world to earnYou will ignore the fact that he is frequently kindgenerousconsiderate and even delicate in his attentions to youHe may bring you a bunch of violets every evening on his return from workHe may present you with a valuable bracelet on every anniversary of your wedding dayHe may deprive himself for life of the pleasure of listening to music because music gives you a headacheBut all these things you will say are just his dutyyou will pay no attention to themBut supposing that he should ever omit any one of these thingsThen immediately you would say He is like all the rest of his sex utterly unrefined And what you will mean is that he has no sense of discernment or he would have known how bitterly your delicate female soul would be grieved by his omitting to bring you that bunch of violetsOf courseduring all this time he will be doing exactly the same by you andif you are not exceptionally luckyyou will find that by the time you have been married 15 years there will have grown up between you a sort of dulluninterested sex bitterness so that whateveryour man may do to irritate youyou will say What can you expectHe is a man And whatever you may do to irritate him he will say What can you expectShe is a woman Whereas actually since God made us all and the world is a trying place we are most of us poor people trying to make the best of a bad jobOf coursein making the foregoing projection I have had to fix myYouin some sort of class position and nationAndas presumably most of my readers will approximate to the English more or less comfortable and moer or less cultured classesI have spoken of you as if you belonged to those classesButwith the The Little Review 63 necessary changes in sums of moneyin the names of educational establishments and of the times of life something very similar could be written of almost every class and of almost every country of western EuropeYou may not go to Girtonyou may go instead to a college for shorthand or into domestic serviceyou may become the secretary to a poet or a waitress in a restaurantAnd these changes may work very wide alterations in your pyschologyBut they will only do this if you are altogether an exceptionFor unless you are such an exception your daily work will dull and obscure your faculties of observationLet us suppose that you are a waitress in a city tea shopUpon the face of it one might imagine that you would acquire an extraordinary knowledge of masculine idiosyncrasies but you will notAll that you will acquire is the knowledge of the outsides of a number of gentlemenone of whom you will almost certainly marry before you have been a year at workAnd as a matter of fact though these waitresses see a perpetual stream of men their generalizations are almost invariably much more rapid than those of the average child in a conventI have taken the trouble to talk to a number of girls of this class and the most original observation that I gathered upon the subject was Gentlemen are so impatient And this was from a handsome young lady who had sat on the marble tablelooking over her shoulder at me and telling me how much or how little she liked the various musical comedies that were running in London at that timeThis agreeable conversation had lasted six minutes by the clock when a tired clerk sitting opposite us rang the bell on his table with considerable energyThen my handsome young friend slipped down from my table and strolled disdainfully in his directionremarking as she went Gentlemen are so impatientWhat does he want to ring his bell like that for Of course it is very possible that this comparatively sexless intercourse between the sexes may lead to more rational views in these mattersIn one way and another I have employed a large The statistics of one of the great London Tea Companies show that their waitresses to the extent of 92 marry customers within twelve months of their engagement64 The Little Review number of female secretaries and I have had at one time and another a large number of friends who employed such helps in their daily workAnd I have found almost invariably thatthough the quite untried members of this class those who came to me or to my friends as a first engagement although these manifested the usual feminine habit of dividing mankind intogentlemenand ladies as the years went on or even as the weeks went on these mental divisions faded away in their minds so that the most experienced secretary that I ever employed one that had served from fifteen to twenty writers of both sexeshad practically forgotten that there was any difference between the sexesSome writers wrote faster than otherssome had given her only notes for the letters she had had to take downothers had dictated them word for wordsome had given her good lunchessome badsome none at allBut she was not prepared in the least to differentiate between the men and the women as regards such things as mental or physical tidynessOf course some of the men had tried to make love to herbut that was practically the whole differenceas it is to my mindthe whole real difference between the sexesAndin the few male secretaries I have known who acted both for men and women they have always told me that exactly the same impression remained in their mindsThere was for instance MrA who has acted as secretary to four women writers and journalists and to three menas well as in two political households where both husband and wife used him for their social and political correspondenceMrAwas of opinion that in all matters connected with their work the six women were all of them more business likemore regular in their hours and less erratic than the three solitary men for whom he had workedThese three men weretwo of them authors and the third a stock brokerThe stock broker was a hopeless case nervousirritableinconsiderate and as childishly vain as a fashionable pianistIn one of the lockers at his office this gentleman kept a complete assortment of toilet superfluities curling tongs and pomades for his moustachesets of manicure implements and even a pair of staysfor such occasions as when he was forced to dress at his office for a city dinnerThe stock brokerin factexactly resembled what is called a spoiled womanBut he was the only person of MrA s elevenwhose identity really stuck out in MrA s mindThe other ten were The Little Review 65 just peopleOf course they were moderately distinguished or they would not have needed to employ MrAAnd being moderately distinguished people they had of course their idiosyncrasiesOne of the male politicians suffered very badly from headachesand one of the woman writers smoked more perpetually than any man MrAhad ever metButin the whole ruck of them they were just peopleI do not wish to build too much upon these particular instancesor ratherI do not wish to avoid looking in the face certain objections that may be made to them as instances going to confirm the theory that by this time I must have made obvious to my readerThe theory is that instead of this Western world being made up of two opposing bandsdistinguished from each other in moralsethicspoints of viewhabits of mind and ideas of honour and dishonour that we are all just peopledistinguished from each other by the functions that we perform in societyLet me put the idea in as concrete a form as is practicableConsiderlet us say an English business womanShe will be much more like an English man of business in her habits and her outlook than a German man of business engaged in the same type of workThat is to say thatsupposing the pursuits of the individuals to be the samethe differences between national characteristics will be much greater than the difference between the sexesAnd if this is the case I shall of course return to these matters more fully later on if this be the casethenthe difference between the sexes must be very small in all the aspects of life that are not immediately sexual or connected with sex passionsRoughly speakingwhat I mean to say isthatwhat we have always been taught to regard as the difference between sexes is very little more actually than the difference between employmentsAnd this is true in the popular point of view for few men will deny that barbers or waiters are just as effeminate as any woman To be continuedMason and Hamlin THE STRADIVARIUS OF PIANOS Mason and Hamlin Co313 FIFTH AVENUE NEW YORK THE BERLITZ SCHOOL OF LANGUAGES
