CAROLINA  IFTEEN years is not a long time But long enough to build a city over and destroy it Long enough to clean a forty year growth of grass from between cobblestones And run street car lines straight across the heart of  romance Commerce are you worth this I should like to bring a case to trial Prosperity versus Beauty Cash registers teetering in a balance against the comfort  of the soul   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Then tonight I stood looking through a grilled gate  At an old dark garden  Live oak trees dripped branchfuls of leaves over the wall  Acacias waved dimly beyond the gate and the smell of their blossoms Puffed intermittently through the wrought iron scrollwork Challenge and solution  O loveliness of old decaying haunted things  Little streets untouched shamefully paved  Full of mist and fragrance on this rainy evening You should come at dawn said my friend  And see the orioles and thrushes and mocking birds In the garden Yes I said absent mindedly  And remarked the sharp touch of ivy upon my hand which rested against the wall But I thought to myself There is no dawn here only sunset And an evening rain scented with flowers  THE MIDDLETON PLACE  Charleston S C  What would Francis Jammes lover of dear dead elegancies  Say to this place  France stately formal stepping in red heeled shoes  Along a river shore   France walking a minuet between live oaks waving ghostly  fans of Spanish moss La Caroline indeed my dear Jammes With Monsieur Michaux engaged to teach her deportment Faint as a whiff of flutes and hautbois The great circle of the approach lies beneath the sweeping  grasses Step lightly down these terraces they are records of a  dream Magnolias pyrus japonicas azaleas Flaunting their scattered blooms with the same bravura That lords and ladies used in the prison of the Con  ciergerie You were meant to be so gay so sophisticated and you  are so sad Sad as the tomb crouched amid your tangled growth Sad as the pale plumes of the Spanish moss Slowly strangling the live oak trees  Sunset wanes along the quiet river The afterglow is haunted and nostalgic Over the yellow woodland it hangs like the dying chord of  a funeral chant And evenly satirically the mosses move to its ineffable  rhythm Like the ostrich fans of palsied dowagers Telling one another contentedly of the deaths they have  lived to see   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MAGNOLIA GARDENS  Charleston S C  It was a disappointment For I do not like magenta And the garden was a fire of magenta Exploding like a bomb into the light colored peace of a  spring afternoon Not wistaria dropping through Spanish moss Not cherokees sprinkling the tops of trees with moon  shaped stars Not the little pricked out blooms of banksia roses Could quench the flare of raw magenta Rubens women shaking the fatness of their bodies In an opulent egotism Till the curves and colors of flesh Are nauseous to the sight So this magenta Hateful Reeking with sensuality Bestial obscene I remember you as something to be forgotten But I cherish the smooth sweep of the colorless river And the thin clear song of the red winged blackbirds In the marsh grasses on the opposite bank  A SOUTH CAROLINA FOREST  Hush hush these woods are thick with shapes and voices They crowd behind in front   Scarcely can one s wheels break through them For God s sake drive quickly There are butchered victims behind those trees And what you say is moss I know is the dead hair of  hanged men Drive faster faster The hair will catch in our wheels and clog them We are thrown from side to side by the dead bodies in the  road Do you not smell the reek of them And see the jaundiced film that hides the stars Stand on the accelerator I would rather be bumped to a  jelly Than caught by clutching hands I cannot see Than be stifled by the press of mouths I cannot feel Not in the light glare you fool but on either side of it Curse these swift running trees Hurl them aside leap them crush them down Say prayers if you like Do anything to drown the screaming silence of this forest To hide the spinning shapes that jam the trees What mystic adventure is this In which you have engulfed me What no world have you shot us into What Dante dream without a farther edge Fright kills they say and I believe it If you would not have murder on your conscience For Heaven s sake get on   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE vow  Tread softly softly  Scuffle no dust No common thoughts shall thrust Upon this peaceful decay This mold and rust of yesterday This is an altar with its incense blown away By the indifferent wind of a long sad night These are the precincts of the dead who die Unconquered Haply You who haunt this place May deign some gesture of forgiveness To those of our sundered race Who come in all humility Asking an alms of pardon Suffer us to feel an ease trees A benefice of love poured down on us from these magnolia That when we leave you we shall know the bitter wound Of our long mutual scourging healed at last and sound  Through an iron gate fantastically scrolled and garlanded Along a path green with moss between two rows of high magnolia trees  How lightly the wind drips through the magnolias How slightly the magnolias bend to the wind  It stands pushed back into a corner of the piazza A jouncing board with its paint scaled off   A jouncing board which creaks when you sit upon it  The wind rattles the stiff leaves of the magnolias So may tinkling banjos drown the weeping of women  When the Yankees came like a tide of locusts When blue uniforms blocked the ends of streets And foolish arrogant swords struck through the paintings  of a hundred years  From gold and ivory coasts come the winds that jingle in the tree tops But the sigh of the wind in the unshaven grass from whence is that  Proud hearts who could not endure desecration Who almost loathed the sky because it was blue Vengeful spirits locked in young arrogant bodies You cursed yourselves with a vow Never would you set foot again in Charleston streets Never leave your piazza till Carolina was rid of Yankees  0 smooth wind sliding in from the sea It is a matter of no moment to you what flag you are flapping  Ocean tides morning and evening slipping past the sea islands Tides slipping in through the harbor shaking the palmetto  posts Slipping out through the harbor Pendulum tides counting themselves upon the sea islands   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  So they jounced for health s sake To be well and able to rejoice when once again the city was free And the lost cause won and the stars and bars afloat over Sumter  The days which had roared to them called more softly  The days whispered the days were silent they moved as imperceptibly as mist  And the proud hearts went with the days into the dusk of age the darkness of death Slowly they were borne away through a Charleston they  scarcely remembered  The jouncing board was pushed into a corner  Only the magnolia trees tossed a petal to it now and again if there happened to be a strong wind when the blooms were dropping  Hush go gently  Do not move a pebble with your foot  This is a moment of pause  A moment to recollect the futility of cause  A moment to bow the head  And greet the unconcerned dead Denying nothing of their indifference  And then go hence  And forget them again  Since lives are lived with living men Amy Lowell    MONODY TO THE SOUND OF ZITHERS  I have wanted other things more than lovers I have desired peace intimately to know The secret curves of deep bosomed contentment To learn by heart things beautiful and slow  Cities at night and cloudful skies I ve wanted And open cottage doors old colors and smells a part All dim things layers of river mist on river To capture Beauty s hands and lay them on my heart  I have wanted clean rain to kiss my eyelids Sea spray and silver foam to kiss my mouth I have wanted strong winds to flay me with passion And to soothe me tired winds from the south  These things have I wanted more than lovers Jewels in my hands and dew on morning grass Familiar things while lovers have been strangers Friended thus I have let nothing pass  Kay Boyle   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SESTINA  To thee O fairest of the world my love I send the messengers that fly with song And bear their precious gifts from heart to heart They leave my lips here in the fragrant night To seek thy casement opened to the moon Whose golden beauty moves the dreaming sea  Awake from dreams my love as wakes the sea Whose bosom stirs beneath the spell of love And swells enchanted by the urgent moon Up through the flowery darkness flies my song Like bird bewildered in the maze of night To flutter at the portals of thy heart  Unto my yearning heart O tender heart Be tenderer than is the yielding sea Unto the moon For what romance hath night To offer if it hold no flame of love If love be not its echo what is song If love be absent banish too the moon  Tonight O fairest shines a lingering moon Whose light makes lonelier the lonely heart Arise beloved I will tune my song To the wild carol of the vagrant sea And sing to thee a wilder song of love Than sings the sea unto its god of night   The roses drink with joy the dews of night Their pleasure secret from the placid moon While I am thirsting for the dews that love Hath gathered purely to thy lips and heart Thy heart O loved one is not as the sea That hath no memory of love or song  Thy heart must answer to my amorous song As to the nightingale its mate this night Where roses droop above the sleeping sea Thy lips must hush my own before the moon Shall ease its longing near the sea s deep heart Awake dear dreamer to the voice of love  Oh hear my song before the lapsing moon Bereave the night or I with grieving heart Must wander by the sea bereft of love  Henry Dumont   IN CHINA  LULLABY OF THE OUTCAST  Child born of my weeping sleep They have beaten me and cast me out of the village Sleep my own  Your father was a merchant who passed through the  fields His sleeves were of silk and his hair shone in the dusk Sleep my son may you never know pain  The blossoming wheat shelters us Far off the village dogs bay to the night Sleep my own  At dawn we will set out over the plain Toward the city of merciful strangers There I will bow down beside the great gate Begging of all who enter in Till they seeing you in my arms Little one little prince clothed in rags Must pity us with a great pity and fling us alms  Sleep on my heart little son May you never know pain  NOON IN THE TEMPLE  Noons drop gently here and steal on the winds away   Noons fall silently as flower petals fall From the quiet dream lit hills they fall Into the court petals of oleander falling Noons of today noons of yesterday Fragrant noons of centuries ago A hush in the wind the soft tones of a gong Touched lightly like an ancient song Begun and never ended It is so They come and rest awhile and then are gone Upon the wind  Ruth Tenney  LAST SONG  I will give everything Death Into your power Love shall pass with my breath  Except one hour  I will give everything Death For your white sleep Dreams shall pass with my breath  One I will keep  Frances Morrison   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TWO SONNETS  DAWN  Mountains and hills in silhouette are drawn Blue on the green horizon s blanching rim A dog barks and a cock crows far and dim Waking the sleeping town to stretch and yawn A blue gum delicate as lace on lawn Across a brightening cloud has thrust a limb And from the pine tree s spire two magpies hymn The everlasting miracle of dawn  For a brief space the brazen skies are blest With loveliness and beauty on the hills Is perishable and plaintive as a song Heart faint and far away and manifest Healing is in my heart for bodily ills That made the sleepless night an aeon long  REVERIE  The dim lit river mirrors skimming swallows Against the last of sunset s fading gold And twilight shadows brim the waiting hollows With quiet beauty that no words may hold Across my mind unconjured undirected Travel desires and dreams like mirrored buds Vague thought and visions momently reflected Evading all my clumsy nets of words   H W Stewart  I am not indolent but wherefore try To net these in a rhyme only to shiver The jewels with the mirror Let them fly Like phantom swallows on the tranquil river And fade as fast they are more beautiful Than muddy stirrings on a troubled pool  H W Stewart  ANGUISH  Nothing can chain the days I have no time for dreams  Stop these days someone So I may stretch my white body  Why do you chain them by sevens Why not by many hundreds  I am irked at seeing them Laid forever neatly in rows  Be the day gray or blue You have named it  Who calls that ball of fire the sun  Doris Campbell   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  TWO POEMS  STANDARDS  All things that are beautiful Fragile mute and sensual  Must be broken ere they be Clad in immortality  Slanting sunlight on the grass Vanishes while clouds pass  Like bright mirrors lakes at rest Shatter on a swan s breast  Quiet water and the sun Only then are known to one  Only then when lost they find Their actuality in mind  So like sunlight love must go That love s perfection we may know  One must die and then the other Of the two the loved and lover  Freed of separate bodies they Are born as one in their new day  Symbol then of love they rise Starry lovely to our eyes   NEVER DID I DREAM  I never thought that I should walk In ecstasy the streets of town Or find a heart more beautiful Than red leaves fluttering down  I did not know archangels pass In human guise among the trees And never never did I dream That I should walk with these  But by my side one went today I saw and I had speech with him And I forgot who ne er forgot How cold are streets how grim  Harold Cook  GIVING  You think I give myself to you Not so my friend you do not see My single purpose and intent To make you give myself to me  Nora B Cunningham   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  GRANDMOTHER  It was so hard to comprehend it all When she sighed casually to her daughter in law When I nursed Benjamin length of life to your little  one I also had trouble with the breast Or Rachel peace be upon her had just such hair as his So hard to understand That death was no abstraction to this woman No awful mystery waiting to be solved In some vague vapory heaven But something casual and familiar Something as close to her As her own flesh Something belonging to her as an old possession And she looked down curiously at this gray shrunken  thing bending over her child Clasping the diaper pin between his little thighs With the gnarled roots of her hands This thing who was a partner to the opulent Earth Five sons two daughters her investment Flesh of her flesh and bone of her bone and milk of her  breast That was now earth of the Earth Put by Within their common treasury Who was a sister to the trees   That spread themselves patiently in the air And in the ground In whose branches the birds nest at whose roots the  worms That blossom bountifully for the wind Asking no questions of it To whom Death was like an unacknowledged husband Whose seed had ripened secretly in her womb Whose children were suckled securely at her breasts Until he came one day and proved them his Who was the grandmother as well To some grass and flowers and worms In seven plots Scattered across two continents  And to her boy Alter Brody  AFTER STORM  The storm that must have spoiled the apple bloom The rain that kept me housed the wind that chills The little birds the thunder and the gloom Return defeated to their far off hills Upon the roof their footsteps pass A lull Falls on the noisy weeping of the eaves Out is my fire and my book grown dull  The sun peers out upon the shining leaves  Louise Redfield   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PHILOSOPHIC DIALOGUE  First Figure Mountains are simple In the thumb nail mind Of man

Magazine of Verse  CHAPTER  I  How long ago since I brought you into my heart And you still stand Cold effigy of love Letting none pass  II  Shadows In a wind Two contend for place How shall I know my mind  III  Like an unhappy ghost I lingered In the dark corners Of his soul  IV  His eyes Are gray And solitary As the sea  v Do not drop your head So upon your breast My eyes hold all it was best I leave unsaid   THIN REFUGE  Are you more than Man  Go I can Say Go or I can  Take the veil of Thought fog wall you Cannot break through  OUT OF A WEARINESS  O love Be rest be calm I am wise Come like Death With quiet palm and eyes  A TRIVIAL DAY IN EARLY AUTUMN  A China lily cup Upon a pool Lifts up Its bowl  Over the pale sky Frail clouds A butterfly About the garden flowers   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Subtle The wind Among The falling leaves  The grass Is wanly brittle Beneath the feet Of those who pass  SEA GIRL  Star light and moon light Slip into the doorways Of the sea All night  My hair is the sun color Of the sand but in an inland pool My eyes were cool As thin sea air  Pearl Andelson    MODERN GERMAN POEMS  NIGHT  By Wilhelm Klemm  The river mutters to itself in the darkness Like an actor rehearsing his role by night At intervals one hears Time s eyelashes flutter  People are sleeping some upon pillows some upon white  cliffs Some of them have immense terrible thumbs Women toss their long hair across their faces  Meanwhile grey castles slowly fall to ruin Thin black grasses arise Mountains uplift their white antlers  Lord give me a sign that you still live I begin to freeze and to be afraid It is already midnight Hark  The minster begins to sing in his brazen voice An old sentinel full of strength and troth Who chanting cries the hour and then is still  Then night sinks deeper into dreamless dark Only the river rehearses its spectral role To be or not to be   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WHAT WILL YOU DO  By Rainer Maria Rilke  What will you do God when I die I am your jar if cracked I lie Your well spring if the well go dry I am your craft your vesture I You lose your purport losing me  When I go your cold house will be Empty of words that made it sweet I am the sandals your bare feet Will seek and long for wearily  Your cloak will fall from aching bones Your glance that my warm cheeks have cheered As with a cushion long endeared Will wonder at a loss so weird And when the sun has disappeared Lie in the lap of alien stones  What will you do God I am feared  AN OLD WOMAN PASSES  By Franz Werfel  An old woman passes like a rotund tower Down the street stormed by a leafy shower Soon she disappears and panting trots Where black mists in gusty nooks are blowing   Now she ll find a doorway and be going Slowly up the creaking steps where glowing Sluggish pools of lamplight lie in blots  Now she goes into her room no stir No one takes her jacket off for her Shaking hands and legs are cold as stone Fluttering weary she begins to putter With her saved up victuals and stale butter While the fire lifts its feeble mutter With her body she remains alone  She forgets while gulping down her buns That in her old frame there once grew sons Ah the joy in slippers to be shod Now her own with strangers she is sharing She forgets the cry when she was bearing Rarely in a press of people faring A man calls her mother with a nod  Think of her O man and think how we In this world remain a prodigy Since we humans into time have hurled How in the Unknown we dangle gasping Looming shadows all about us grasping Soul and body crushed in their strange clasping This world cannot be the only world  When she glides so grizzled through the room Oh perhaps she feels it in the gloom   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Sight is fading in her dim old eyes Yes she feels herself in all things growing On her groaning knees she sinks down glowing As in a lamp s little flicker showing The vast face of God begins to rise  EVENING  By Georg Heym  The crimson day is steeped in Tyrian dyes The stream runs white washed with a fabulous glaze A sail one with the flying vessel flies The skipper s silhouette black on the blaze  On every island autumn s forests lift Their ruddy heads where space spreads wide her wings From dark defiles low leafy murmurs drift Of woodland s music soft as cithern strings  With outpoured darkness now the east is soaked Like blue wine from an urn that careless hands Have broken And afar in mourning cloaked Tall night on shadowy buskins mutely stands  HOMER  By Albert Ehrenstein  I sang the songs of red revenge And I sang the stillness of wood shadowed waters   But no one companioned me Rigid lonely As the locust sings to itself To myself I sang my song Now my steps vanish grown faint In the sands of lassitude For weariness my eyes are failing me I am tired of comfortless fords Of sea crossing of girls of streets At the gulf s edge I do not remember The shields and the spears Blown upon by birches By winds overshadowed I fall asleep to the sound of a harp Whose music Joyfully drips from under another s fingers I do not stir For all thoughts and all acts Trouble the limpid eyes of the world  ROCOCO  By Richard Schaukal  Heavy draperies stiff and silvergrey  Busts of gods that stare forth vacantly  From blind eyes rich convoluted clocks  Porcelain figures droll in shepherds smocks  Set on gilt legged tables marble topped  Ebon cats whose green eyes never dropped   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Blink desirous from the chimney piece  Curtained small causeuses as soft as fleece  Gay gilt chairs and flowered tapestry  And upon a spinet open lies  That most exquisite of melodies  The gavotte whose yellowed margins show  On the right hand page a bit below  The curved dent of a marquise s nail  Her high waisted little body sat  Here the while she played lovely and pale  With arched brows large blue mendacious eyes  Powdered hair she never dared to pat  Before gentlemen who faithfully  Held to an houri heaven upon earth  Whose lace ruffled wrists moved gracefully  Hovering nicely over satin vests  To adjust frilled jabots on their breasts  Or who bent slim canes in dreamy mirth  Silver knobbed marked with enameled crests  Who with oriental perfumes scented  Delicate adventures and took pains  To dismiss with adroit tenderness  The old god buried without distress  As with languid graces well contented  They tripped round the grave where he must rest  Who will open these locked gates to me  On this world of piquancies and pander  Madrigals and pale nuance and slander   FROM PHANTASUS  By Arno Holz  On a mountain of sugar candy under a blossoming almond tree twinkles my gingerbread house Its little windows are of gold foil out of its chimney steams wadding In the green heaven above me beams the Christmas tree In my round sea of tinfoil are mirrored all her angels all her lights The little children stand about and stare at me I am the dwarf Turlitipu My fat belly is made of gumdragon my thin pin legs are matches my clever little eyes raisins  Translated by Babette Deutsch and Avrahm Yarmolinsky   POETRY A Magazine of Verse COMMENT  THE CHRISTMAS SYMBOL  AS I write the windows are wide open and the russet and yellow leaves still linger on the city trees under an Indian summer sun But winter is coming soon snowflakes will sift the boughs bare and scurry through human senses and imaginings Winter will drive us to cover force us to take refuge indoors from the vastness of the world We shall gather under roofs around blazing logs and enact the annual Christmas drama which challenges the immensity of space with its audacious assertion of the immensity of life  Full of little symbols is this drama for only through small symbols have we power to assert immensities Minute sparks of life that we are we can measure suns only by our own light and the infinite only by our feeble reach We build a house to compress to a cell our tiny world to bound it with walls and comforts to shut out the keen winds and the questioning stars We kindle a fire on the hearth to flatter our flesh with warmth against the encompassing chill of space and dreams We gather together we talk we love to cajole the stark loneliness of the soul We create children and statues pictures and poems to assert the continuity of life the immortality of thought We order our little days and places into habits and harmonies and rhythms to ward off confusion and futility and make a pattern of beauty against threatening   chaos We move darkly as in a dream brightly as in a dance carrying our little tapers of faith from mystery to mystery our little tapers shining against the void  And we please our fancies with delicate detail We pluck a pine tree from the forest to remind us of ancestral camp fires giving it a ceiling for the sky tinsel for clouds and gay little lights for stars We become children again to hang toys on its boughs and happy little Christ child legends drawn from the richly stored past of the credulous world And through all the childish symbols we behold the mightier symbol the Christ life of humanity its birth out of the virgin earth its growth through harsh and toilsome ages its search for truth its faith in divine beauty its tragic agony its crucifixion and obliteration in darkness and finally its ultimate resurrection in inextinguishable spiritual life H M  A NOTE ON MODERN GERMAN POETRY  Several strata of various origins colors and profiles are distinguishable in contemporary German poetry The bottom layer where the process of fossilization seems already to have started bears the marks of naturalism The chief representatives of the naturalists were Detlev von Liliencron and Richard Dehmel and the only surviving member of the school who is still both vocal and vital is that protean artist Arno Holz At the outset he proclaimed the doctrines and exemplified the practices of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  a group dedicated to an art impressionistic in form and social in purpose an art which was on a diet of sordid commonplaces and indigestible Weltanschauung Within ten years Holz was publishing a theory of poetic technique which must take its place in the general movement away  from traditional versification and before the end of the nineteenth century he had put forth the second fascicule of his Phantasus an immense bizarre only partially integrated work still unfinished which is at once an example and a justification of his revolution of lyricism Here we find the poet listening as he claims all poets must for the rhythm beating through the mood which he aims to convey the rhythm changing with each poetic motif as the pulse changes with each emotional wave In Phantasus he strives to give us in a miscellany of fragments the many and various avatars of his wandering psyche The scale of this work appears to be congenial to Holz for it was followed by another huge extravaganza Blechschmiede purposing to synthetize the whole modern world as Phantasus purposes to synthetize the poet s entire consciousness  Not surprisingly naturalism had only to reach its peak when the reaction against it began This was toward the end of the century Already a group of poets was forming a parallel to the fin de siecle coteries to be discovered elsewhere In brief symbolism was coming into its own in Germany The reaction took two forms on the one hand there were the esthetes careless of the moral preoccupa   tions of the elder school ignoring ugliness and indifferent to the actualities about them on the other hand there were the mystics who were religious rather than ethical and who reconciled the ugly and the beautiful the real and the supersensuous after the fashion of mystics of all times and countries The leader of the symbolists is Stefan Georg and he has drawn about him a number of disciples each of whom does distinctive and sometimes distinguished work The exquisite Richard Schaukal belongs to this circle by virtue of his self sufficient estheticism He has a nice economy of material and occasionally a method of suggesting emotion which reminds one of Browning Like the English poet also Schaukal delights in promenading through the ages trying to surprise some intimate aspect of a vanished world As for the mystics the greatest of them is Rainer Maria Rilke and yet there is perhaps no contemporary German poet so intensely aware of the things that touch the senses  Rilke s early poems are lyrics rather pale and slender and vague in perfume like cloistral lilies and framing as they should the images of a dim Madonna As the poet matures his touch grows perceptibly firmer even when he handles concepts as difficult and remote as the concept of a divine principle The book of religious poems Stundenbuch which seems to have grown out of Rilke s brief sojourn in Russia and which was published in 1905 expresses the mystic s supreme faith in the simple terms of the experience of the gardener and the carpenter Only   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  a man bent on seizing the last vestige of the visible tactual world about him could find such perfect expression of the invisible intangible world to which he surrenders his spirit Rilke is a master craftsman His images are inevitable and ineluctable his rhythms usually slow and always sensitive his employment of rhyme as reverberant with mellow echoes as the striking of great cathedral bells  The uppermost stratum of contemporary German poetry and the one which is palpably in process of formation owes its origin to the eruptions of war and revolution The younger poets while forming no self constituted school adhere to the tenets of expressionism an esthetic and intellectual complex which has been authoritatively defined as the spiritual movement of a period which places the inner experience above external life It implies further a new assertion of ethical values a profound metaphysical agitation and an underlying faith in the transubstantiation of reality by the sheer effort of the will  Men like Ehrenstein and Klemm and Heym produce work that is typical of the attitude which underlies this post war poetry They are alike in looking toward the brotherhood of man and the federation of the world they share the vision of an altered universe which is reflected as in broken mirrors in their novel abrupt sometimes incoherent manner Ehrenstein is seldom discovered in the placid mood of his Homer Klemm for all his earnest sympathies is often esoteric in his intensely individual   expression of them Heym who betrays the sensuousness of a Keats fills his poetry with the shadows of the city and the terrors of apocalyptic forebodings  The bruised and compassionate spirit which informs many of these poems finds its clearest voice in the work of Franz Werfel This poet has been compared to Francis Jammes and there is indeed a similarity between the two men both having the simplicity of heart commonly credited to children and monks But Werfel is primarily an urban poet and of necessity alive to thwartings and ugliness which the French poet can ignore The suffering which he recognizes in all life even that of the brutes summons a Christ like pity which takes upon itself the whole angry burden of evil He is a man so deeply wounded that his stammering cry is sometimes uncommunicative He takes for granted moreover a rare immediacy of sympathy which approaches the attitude of the eastern mystic and this assumption does not always make for intelligibility Withal Werfel s humble homely poetry is on the whole stronger and more direct than that of most of his fellows He remains the central figure in a generation of poets which is torn between a tense sophistication and a naive faith Babette Deutsch   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVIEWS  SPOON RIVER TO THE OPEN SEA  The Open Sea by Edgar Lee Masters Macmillan Co  The hackneyed truism that the rule of relativity is applicable to all things finds another exemplification in the case of the poet whose Spoon River Anthology stands as a challenge to all of its successors Cannot he get away from it Must it always pursue him for nothing less than a repetition of or addition to the Spoon River epitaphs could be really a continuation of the style for which that work has been so widely praised Why not let Spoon River be Spoon River Domesday Book Domesday Book etc  Yet perhaps The Open Sea is the nearest approach to Spoon River which has as yet followed that volume In this as in Spoon River all sorts and conditions of men speak out their minds from the past and tell their stories of sordidness or beauty But it is an unlocalized Spoon River humanity speaks up from Rome from Illinois from Indiana from Babylon For sordidness take if you like The New Apocrypha with its grotesque irreverence for biblical authorities I think the most orthodox have always had an unspoken feeling for the little fig tree cursed because it could not put forth fruit out of season and Mr Masters extends his sympathies to the owner of the tree left without the kindly shade And the grimly amusing tragedy of the farmer who lived two miles from Decapolis who faces ruin because of the loss of his hogs   Two thousand hogs as fine As ever you saw Drowned and choked in the sea I want the law  Or for beauty take Invocation to the Gods with its liturgical music and its sounding iteration or these lines from a description of Hadrian s villa  The tufa walls Inlaid with yellow lichens look like bronze Gold filigreed And through those rifts and breaks There are the trunks of ilex gnarled and dark Look Nature mocks us Hadrian is asleep These nearly hundred years Does cyclamen Crimson about these walls grow less profuse Or these anemones laugh less to the sun Or bramble honeysuckle bougainvillea Desert the gardens of the emperor  And for haunting charm of syncopation I wish that I had the space to quote the whole of Ulysses a modern treatment of a very ancient subject  Settled to evenings before the doorway With Telemachus who sat at his knee Why did you stay so long from Ithaca Leaving my mother Penelope  There is whimsical humor in the father s evasions and candors as he tries to answer the lad s curiosity as to his amorous adventures and the great wanderer and connoisseur of women utters a universal truth as he finally explains his home coming  And the salt of a man turns to his doorway He makes his will for his blood in the end   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Were there nothing else in the book this would make it worth while  As a famous French writer said once when asked his views on patriotism My country is the world and my flag the flag of every nation under the sun so it may be said of Mr Masters with regard to time that all time is his He is not like many a youth of today who with an arrogant gesture waves aside all tradition all the past He chooses his subjects from Caesar to Corbett And so with the smell of gasoline in our nostrils and the roar of airplanes overhead it is interesting to go back with him to the problems of Brutus and Antony and the old questions of worlds and wars seem not so very remote from our world and our war There is a variety of opinion as to whether the Brutus idea dominates this book for better or for worse But it does dominate it we find it running through many of the poems However it is interesting not so much for the pictures and philosophies which it evokes as for its historical truth of a mad Brutus blowing his madness to our own time  It is always an easy matter for the superficial to dissect out here a line there a phrase with which to damn a piece of work Mr Masters work is open to this sort of dissecting He does not with the fastidiousness of a Gautier file and polish He flings you his theme red hot from the anvil As in Wagner s operas so in Mr Masters poems there are long stretches of possibly tedious recitative but read them lest you miss some fine lines   It seems to be a special intuition with this poet to recreate the atmosphere of the sixties The poems which have to do with Lincoln and the men about him in Illinois may be open to criticism as drama and even as a loosely wrought form of dialogue verse but nevertheless they have a compelling force of their own because Mr Masters knows his Illinois so thoroughly and because its laws and traditions are so bred in his bone There is no other author American or English who can approach him here He makes you hear the actual speech almost the intonation he leaves a compelling portrait which reduces Drink water s play to a shadow picture  These two lines showing Alexander Stephens taking the blow of Lee s surrender indicate with what vivid brevity Masters can reveal human suffering  A sparhawk in the rain breast torn away His beating heart in view his burning eyes  This book includes a soul shaking phantom play called The Decision which is full of memorable lines We are plunged at once into the heavy atmosphere of dream and of those voices which are the reality of dream Telegraph wires are droning We follow Lincoln in his sleep through his mental conflict before he has brought himself to take the irrevocable step of a declaration of war This play is carried out with the downright force and tenderness which are characteristic of the poet as he makes you feel the torturing struggle of a great soul and the ending is the acme of dramatic power Lincoln has made the decision   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  in his dream and he sleeps on Then comes the awakening as the secretary of war enters  The Secretary of War Fort Sumter has been fired on Lincoln Call the troops  This is where Mr Masters wins while many another fails after you have read one of his poems whether or not you have liked it in the reading you go about your doings with an indelible picture in your mind And in this our day when so many poems look alike sound alike and leave a like jumble in one s memory to place enduring stanzas in the mind of a reader is I believe to meet the test of being a great poet Agnes Lee Freer  TOGA AND BUSKIN POETRY  Odes and Lyrics by Hartley Burr Alexander Marshall  Jones Co Boston  Often books come to us for review which seem to prove an immense and contradictory disparity between our ideas of the art and those accepted by many poets and critics of enviable culture books which amaze us by their persistence in rhetoric in imitative phrasing in stress upon subject and message however trite and however unmagically expressed books which make us wonder whether this is indeed the twentieth century of stript athletic purpose  Here for example is Mr Alexander s finely printed volume opening with a forty page Ode on the Generations of Man an ode which to be sure was first published in   1910 and perhaps could hardly be written in quite the same style today One has no objection to its cosmic message it may be some poet s business to sing of man s development on earth from the Brute to the Dreamer But one doubts if that poet when he appears will handle his great subject in quite the curious cumbersome over trimmed manner of Mr Alexander The poem begins  Earth  Twixt sky and sky wide spun  The blue sky of the sun  The black abyss  Of night and silence blent  Where to their slow extinguishment  Fall fated stars and the still years miss  All measurement  Earth  Ancient of cur days  Our life s great mother and of our mortal ways  High matriarch  What destiny shall be  Beyond thy bournes or visionry  Glad in phantasmic splendors or a stark  And wakeless rest  Sconced in thy stony breast  What dooming makes or mars  Beyond mortality  Is given us to see  But as we read aright  Writ in our mid earth life the mighty geste  Of Nature but as we guess the plan  That wrought the mind of man  And gave him sight  Potent to gauge the pathways of the stars  Of course from any point of view recognizable here   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  this kind of thing is artistically vicious It assembles all the furbelows ever mistakenly used in this art and covers with them the lay figure of a ready made subject unvitalized by creative imagination  Many of the shorter poems in the book are of later date but the style would rarely prove it They are full of The ache and strain of aeons long agone lines like  Doth drive adown the sea  And she shall be a winsome maid  America Divinest bride Of Time Yet to illume that day Forever young Where Beauty beareth sway  Or the incredible emptiness of the war poem Dies Irae full of palaver like this from its second section The Flag  I behold thee and my heart leaps high Greeting thy rushing waves with answering wave Of blood resurgent till my body rings With the clear hymn of liberty and thee Flag flag of my country  Mr Alexander who is a distinguished folk lore specialist in the faculty of the University of Nebraska has written the text for a number of pageants the latest being the Ak Sar Ben Pageant the title is Nebraska reversed which is to be given in Omaha this year A rhetorical style seems to be the fashion for pageants a fashion much to be regretted as it tends to convince the people   who crowd to see and hear them that poetry is an art remote and formidable which has to strut about in toga and buskin language Probably Mr Alexander s pageants will not tend to correct this error  We pause over his book because the kind of misconception of the art which it typically represents is at the root of much academic misteaching of it in countless American colleges No wonder so many wide awake boys and girls swear off from poetry when they graduate  H M  CAPRICES OF A FAUN  Selected Poems and Ballads of Paul Fort translated from  the French by John Strong Newberry Dufheld amp Co  Francis Jammes still holds to his provincial seclusion Paul Fort has swung himself into the office of Prince des Poètes and the illusion of the obvious has become the purpose of the French moderns Men like Blaise Cendrars Jules Romains and Apollinaire demonstrate the illusion of the obvious obviously Jean Cocteau caresses it asininely and the friends of Tristan Tzara satirize it stupidly Verhaeren being dead one goes for a living poet to Paul Fort and expects other things  The art of a gay deep singing Frenchman I take these words from Carl Sandburg s generous Appreciation printed in this volume There is a hearty greeting in this a kindly generalization But being not over persuaded by the disguise of Fort s rhymed verses written and published   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  as prose and allowing for the breadth of Mr Sandburg s contemporary enthusiasm I must force a first point by differing slightly Paul Fort is indeed a true Frenchman and he is gay in the variety of his intoxication the naivete of his hurried exultation in his elfish and child like excitement over the delicately moody and elemental and even over the obvious in all of which manipulation exceeds and overruns the depth Fort is undeniably a gay singer Alert and aware he touches all things and tries to include them in his song But in justice to his land and his song and in fairness to his position that of Prince des Poètes and in further justice to the poets of his land and of ours he is not a deep singer Like Rimbaud and Verlaine but unlike Verhaeren or his contemporary Francis Jammes he is not deep singing  Paul Fort is the old old incarnation He is a faun who plays with realities as though they were illusions capricious and aware But he is a modern faun and he is not spiteful Neither is he robust or a satyricon of time Fauns in French literature are a little out of date they have been in fact slightly overdone and worn out And as becoming to its age this faun is shedding its hoofs and its sprightliness is on the verge of relapsing into a tender limp Thus he has a deep and scattered sympathy and he is inclined to be afraid Except for the surface beauty which may flare of strong things he is fearful and he says  Do not believe in death Through dark oblivion strikes a sudden beam and death is all agleam   There is something of the evasive mountebank in this ageing faun He has no vigorous denial no honest distrust His acceptance precludes refusal His method or his technic is an unnecessary one it is a grave attempt to be original a conscious excuse for himself With this he becomes aware of an attitude and employs it profusely He takes advantage of the acquired attitude as an escape and he becomes the romping troubadour on a pilgrimage of the great evasion  Paul Fort then is the joyful poet But it is the joy of a beautiful abandon a surrender to all things and not the joy of pure spontaneity while singing the release of a personal force Yet it is a healthy joy if it is not a vital one and he is as careless as he is joyful He mingles stateliness with abandon he is graceful and ungraceful in the same poem almost in the same line This effusion of conscious grace and indifferent facility together with a certain prolific and convenient efficiency in what is at times the most ordinary poetic phraseology constitutes in the main the acknowledgment and the vogue of Paul Fort Had these poems a difficulty in approach had they a probing tenacity which comes from a definite focus had they some singleness of purpose they are too scattered one would be less tempted to deal in disparaging words On the whole they are the rope skipping of a child a run into the waking spring irresponsible and away In this respect they are quite successful and even important if one is in the mood to philosophize that this is ultimately   just as important as being concerned with deliberate things  These selected translations by John Strong Newberry are however well done and well controlled And what is ever possible with Fort and what to a translator must be very tempting the poems are often improved upon They are representative of his entire production and they are adequate proof that were Fort writing in the English of America were he competing with the contemporary poetic production of this country his song would need a more intensified pain something more that the mere enumeration of his delights in order to gain for him the position which he has received from his own France  Virgil Geddes  CONCERNING POETS LAUREATE  The Laureateship A Study of the Office of Poet Laureate in  England with Some Account of the Poets by Edmund  Kemper Broadus Oxford University Press  The development of the English laureateship from the days of the Anglo Saxon scop court poet of a petty king to the present day is interestingly and accurately traced by Professor Broadus The author knows his facts and he knows poetry thus making both his historical data and his critical pronouncements of real value Never is he blind to the fact that the office while possessing certain possibilities for accomplishment has more frequently magnified its holders than been magnified by them   Many popular traditions concerning the laureateship are refuted by Professor Broadus A number of early poets such as John Gower commonly considered in the succession of official laureates had merely received the ceremonial crown of laurel baccalaureate when they took their degrees at the University of Oxford The first of these academic laureates to receive official recognition at court was Bernard Andreas who in 1486 was given an annuity of ten marks by order of King Henry VII  Although in Queen Elizabeth s time poetry became not merely the embellishment of the noble but the path of advancement for the ambitious there was no official laureate It was in her time however that the popular conception of such an office developed due Professor Broadus holds to three facts the gradual rise of the English court as a centre of artistic interest the development of a special retrospective interest in the life and times of Henry VII at whose court Andreas had served and the familiarity of men of letters with classical literature and tradition and with the literature and life of Renaissance Italy The result was that Ben Jonson and William Davenant successively were tacitly recognized as poets laureate though not definitely appointed  The official laureateship begins the author states with the appointment of John Dryden in 1670 Here is the succession from that day to this as given by Professor Broadus one wonders how many of them are known even to students of poetry John Dryden 1670 1689 Thomas   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Shadwell 1689 1692 Nahum Tate 1692 1715 Nicholas Rowe 1715 1718 Lawrence Eusden 1718 1730 Colley Cibber 1730 1757 William Whitehead 1758 1785 Thomas Warton 1785 1790 Henry James Pye 17901813 Robert Southey 1813 1843 William Wordsworth 1843 1850 Alfred Tennyson 1850 1892 Alfred Austin  1892 1913 and Robert Bridges 1913 Professor Broadus discusses each in turn with generally sound criticism  While there are some distinguished names in the list why has the laureateship been filled for the most part by the inconsequential In many cases it was not offered to men of distinction Thomas Hardy for example was not consonant with the laureate mood In other cases such men declined it for probably the same reasons that led to the refusal of Thomas Gray who wrote  Though I very well know the bland emollient saponaceous qualities both of sack and silver yet if any great man would say to me I will make you rat catcher to his Majesty with a salary of three hundred pounds a year and two butts of the best Malaga and though it has been usual to catch a mouse or two for form s sake in public once a year yet to you sir we shall not stand upon these things I cannot say I should jump at it nay if they would drop the very name of the office and call me Sinecure to the King s Majesty I should still feel a little awkward and think everybody I saw smelt a rat about me The office itself has always humbled the professor hitherto even in an age when kings were somebody if he were a poor writer by making him more conspicuous and if he were a good one by setting him at war with the little fry of his own profession for there are poets little enough to envy even a poet laureate  Could the case against official patronage be better stated Nelson Antrim Crawford   CORRESPONDENCE  MISS LOWELL ON TRANSLATING CHINESE  To the Editor of POETRY Will you allow me space to correct a couple of misleading statements in both of which I am concerned in Mrs Tietjens second paper On Translating Chinese Poetry in your September number The first is the attempt to refute the claim of our publishers that Mrs Ayscough s and my translations of Chinese poetry constituted the first time that an English version of Chinese poems has been at once the work of a sinologue and a poet As evidence against this claim Mrs Tietjens cites Helen Waddell s Lyrics from the Chinese which she says were based on Professor Legge s literal prose translations But Mrs Tietjens ignores the important words at once in the publisher s announcement At once means at the same time it means that the two parties to the transaction were simultaneously engaged in other words that they worked together Professor Legge s monumental work on the Book of Odes was published in 1871 Miss Waddell s volume not until forty two years later in 1913 Professor Legge died in 1897 sixteen years before Miss Waddell s renditions appeared It is possible that Miss Waddell made her renditions a considerable time before their publication but it is scarcely likely that so long a period as forty two years can have elapsed it is even unlikely that Miss Waddell began her work before Professor Legge died sixteen years   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  is a long time for the gestation of a book even a book of Chinese renditions If we suppose that Miss Waddell did begin her renditions before Professor Legge died it can only have been very shortly before and it is not possible that Professor Legge full of years and fame should have worked with Miss Waddell over her embroideries on his long published text nor does Miss Waddell suggest anything of the sort Elaborating on authentic Chinese texts is no new thing Cranmer Byng expressly states that his renditions were made from translations he had read Mrs Ayscough and I worked together and so far as I know we are the first to have attempted such a collaboration since followed by Mr Witter Bynner and Dr Kiang Kang hu  In a review of Mr Waley s books and our Fir Flower Tablets in the July number of the Edinburgh Review the author a Chinese scholar Chang Hsin Hai says  It is true I think as Mrs Ayscough says in the Introduction that it is the first time that English translations of Chinese poetry have been made by a student of Chinese and a poet working together and the work is certainly a success in spite of the obvious difficulty in such a division of labor  Mrs Tietjens second statement impugns my veracity for she implies that the only thing I claimed for my versions their literalness is not so Mrs Tietjens cannot read Chinese any more than I can and it would seem that she is not too familiar with the available literal translations or she would not cite Miss Waddell s alteration of The Ho as a happy rendering of the original It is   How say they that the Ho is wide When I could ford it if I tried How say they Sung is far away When I can see it every day  Yet must indeed the Ho be deep When I have never dared to leap And since I am content to stay Sung must be very far away  Professor Legge s literal prose version is as follows  Who says that the Ho is wide With a bundle of reeds I can cross it Who says that Sung is distant On tiptoe I can see it  Who says that the Ho is wide It will not admit a little boat Who says that Sung is distant It would not take a whole morning to reach it  Professor Legge admits that what he has called a bundle of reeds is given in the original by a character which means a single reed but states that in amplifying it to a bundle he is following a certain Chinese commentator So scrupulous is Professor Legge in cataloguing every departure from the original text In his translation there is nothing about fording or leaping or being content to stay Miss Waddell s last stanza departs entirely from the meaning of the original which is a little odd if Miss Waddell carefully studied her Legge for in a note the Professor gives the narrative as he calls it of the poem It is too long to be quoted here and can be found either in Professor Legge s Chinese Classics or in our Fir Flower   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Tablets Suffice it to say that the lady was banished from Sung and is lamenting that although it is so near she cannot go there I rendered the poem in this way  Who says the Ho is wide Why one little reed can bridge it  Who says that Sung is far I stand on tiptoe and see it  Who says the Ho is wide Why the smallest boat cannot enter  Who says that Sung is far It takes not a morning to reach it  Mrs Tietjens comparing Miss Waddell s version with mine allows propaganda to outrun discretion for she says If one bears in mind the fact that the original is rhymed and patterned does Miss Lowell s new free verse version with its American colloquialisms seem an improvement In the first place my version is not in free verse but in strict meter It is in trimeter The first line of each stanza is iambic the second iambic with an alternative anapest in one stanza with two anapests and a feminine ending The pattern is perfectly regular My slight departures from the order of Professor Legge s words were just to keep this pattern In the second where are the American colloquialisms Certainly the very English Englishman who was Professor Legge writing before 1871 can hardly be supposed to have made use of such As to rhyme the partiality for rhymed or unrhymed translations is merely a matter of taste Personally I agree with   the Chinese gentleman above quoted who in a discussion of Chinese translation in general states as his opinion  It would be wiser therefore to do away with rhymes altogether because it often happens that rhymes are retained at the expense of other far more important things Not only does the structure of the original run the danger of being impaired but the very simplest meaning is sometimes lost  Query Is rhyme the reason for Miss Waddell s extraordinary last stanza Later Mrs Tietjens says  I cannot quite trust Miss Lowell She has given us so many racial interpretations Japanese Indian and others which were all essentially herself that when I find that this too reads like her own poems I doubt their essentially Chinese quality She has surely too vivid a personality to make a good translator  Has she Anyone who likes may see by comparing the original poems with my translations done on the same principle as these Chinese translations in my book Six French Poets where I had no collaborator and where the French version can be read with its translation  My racial interpretations as Mrs Tietjens calls them were not that to my mind I used various atmospheres which attracted me that was all I expressly said in the preface to Legends that these were my versions seen through my eyes To play with an atmosphere is one thing to translate is another If Mrs Tietjens will compare my Legend of Porcelain with Fir Flower Tablets she will see the difference if prejudice will let her It has already been pointed out by the well known sinologue Dr Ferguson in a review of our book in the Journal of the North   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society Also Mrs Tietjens must realize that I have been studying Chinese and Japanese poets for years and possibly I have learnt a little a very very little from them  If Mrs Tietjens really distrusts me it is that she is not sufficiently familiar with her subject Will she permit a Chinese scholar who is also a student of English to reassure her In the Edinburgh Review article to which I have already referred the author sums up his opinion of Fir Flower Tablets by saying  The translation is on the whole excellent It is not only literally correct but it has also living qualities because as rendered by an eminent poet it has real poetic flavor As with Mr Waley so with Mrs Ayscough and Miss Lowell they have given the world the best translations so far produced of some of the most representative Chinese poets  What Mrs Tietjens is trying to do is to prepare readers to understand her sister Miss Hammond s studies in Chinese rhythms But good wine needs no bush and Miss Hammond in attempting what has never been attempted before is certain of a curious and eager audience It is a brave endeavor and should receive the sympathy of everyone interested in Chinese poetry Amy Lowell  Note by Eunice Tietjens My little excursion into the realm of Chinese translations seems to have started so lively a hare that I am quite outrun Nor have I any inclination to follow Miss Lowell into the undergrowth of controversy especially as the whole tenor of my article was merely a warning against thinking we understand the Chinese  I should like to say however that I am extremely sorry if I have impugned Miss Lowell s veracity If any other reader took the single sentence which is all I said about Miss Lowell s translation of The Ho   If one bears in mind the fact etc quoted by her in full above as such an impugnment I shall be much surprised I cannot myself see any connection whatever between it and her veracity I have never considered a complete literalness in giving the content all that is necessary in translating poetry and in spite of the slight variation in Miss Waddell s translation from the literal sense though not to my mind from the spirit of The Ho I think it more magical English poetry than Miss Lowell s and therefore essentially more truly representative of the Chinese original which I am told is peculiarly haunting  Nor do I understand why this purely literary preference should be taken as propaganda for my sister s studies in Chinese rhythms which are primarily musical and which concern themselves in so far as they touch poetry at all with a totally different phase of the subject None the less I am grateful to Miss Lowell for her sympathy with Miss Hammond s work and I am sorry she sees only prejudice in an attitude of mind which has crystallized only after a number of
