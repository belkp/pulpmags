muralh tan que i puosch om gitar ab malh  YOU D have men s hearts up from the dust And tell their secrets Messire Cino Right enough Then read between the lines  of Uc St Cire Solve me the riddle for you know the tale  Bertrans En Bertrans left a fine canzone Maent I love you you have turned me out The voice at Montfort Lady Agnes hair Bel Miral s stature the vicountess throat Set all together are not worthy of you And all the while you sing out that canzone Think you that Maent lived at Montaignac One at Chalais another at Malemort   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Hard over Brive for every lady a castle Each place strong  Oh is it easy enough Tairiran held hall in Montaignac His brother in law was all there was of power In Perigord and this good union Gobbled all the land and held it later  for some hundreds years And our En Bertrans was in Altafort Hub of the wheel the stirrer up of strife As caught by Dante in the last wallow of hell The headless trunk that made its head a lamp For separation wrought out separation And he who set the strife between brother and brother And had his way with the old English king Viced in such torture for the counterpass  How would you live with neighbors set about you Poictiers and Brive untaken Rochechouart Spread like the finger tips of one frail hand And you on that great mountain of a palm Not a neat ledge not Foix between its streams But one huge back half covered up with pine Worked for and snatched from the string purse of Born The four round towers four brothers mostly fools What could he do but play the desperate chess And stir old grudges   Near Perigord  Pawn your castles lords Let the Jews pay  And the great scene That maybe never happened Beaten at last Before the hard old king  Your son ah since he died My wit and worth are cobwebs brushed aside In the full flare of grief Do what you will  Take the whole man and ravel out the story He loved this lady in castle Montaignac The castle flanked him he had need of it You read today how long the overlords of Perigord The Talleyrands have held the place it was no transient  fiction And Maent failed him Or saw through the scheme  And all his net like thought of new alliance Chalais is high a level with the poplars Its lowest stones just meet the valley tips Where the low Dronne is filled with water lilies And Rochecouart can match it stronger yet The very spur s end built on sheerest cliff And Malemort keeps its close hold on Brive While Born his own close purse his rabbit warren His subterranean chamber with a dozen doors   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A bristle with antennae to feel roads To sniff the traffic into Perigord And that hard phalanx that unbroken line The ten good miles from thence to Maent s castle All of his flank how could he do without her And all the road to Cahors to Toulouse What would he do without her  Papiol Go forthright singing Anhes Cembelins There is a throat ah there are two white hands There is a trellis full of early roses And all my heart is bound about with love Where am I come with compound flatteries What doors are open to fine compliment And every one half jealous of Maent He wrote the catch to pit their jealousies Against her give her pride in them  Take his own speech make what you will of it And still the knot the first knot of Maent  Is it a love poem Did he sing of war Is it an intrigue to run subtly out Born of a jongleur s tongue freely to pass Up and about and in and out the land Mark him a craftsman and a strategist  St Leider had done as much at Polhonac   Near Perigord  Singing a different stave as closely hidden Oh there is precedent legal tradition To sing one thing when your song means another Et albirar ab lor bordon Foix count knew that What is Sir Bertrans singing  Maent Maent and yet again Maent Or war and broken heaumes and politics  II  End fact Try fiction Let us say we see En Bertrans a tower room at Hautefort Sunset the ribbon like road lies in red cross light South toward Montaignac and he bends at a table Scribbling swearing between his teeth by his left hand Lie little strips of parchment covered over Scratched and erased with al and ochaisos Testing his list of rhymes a lean man Bilious With a red straggling beard And the green cat s eye lifts toward Montaignac  Or take his magnet singer setting out Dodging his way past Aubeterre singing at Chalais In the vaulted hall Or by a lichened tree at Rochecouart   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Aimlessly watching a hawk above the valleys Waiting his turn in the mid summer evening Thinking of Aelis whom he loved heart and soul To find her half alone Montfort away And a brown placid hated woman visiting her Spoiling his visit with a year before the next one Little enough Or carry him forward Go through all the courts My Magnet Bertrand had said  We come to Ventadour In the mid love court he sings out the Canzon No one hears save Arrimon Luc D Esparo No one hears aught save the gracious sound of compliments Sir Arrimon counts on his fingers Montfort Rochecouart Chalais the rest the tactic Malemort guesses beneath sends word to Coeur de Lion  The compact de Born smoked out trees felled About his castle cattle driven out Or no one sees it and En Bertrans prospered  And ten years after or twenty as you will Arnaut and Richard lodge beneath Chalus The dull round towers encroaching on the field The tents tight drawn horses at tether Further and out of reach the purple night   Near Perigord  The crackling of small fires the bannerets The lazy leopards on the largest banner Stray gleams on hanging mail an armorer s torch flare Melting on steel  And in the quietest space They probe old scandals say de Born is dead And we ve the gossip skipped six hundred years Richard shall die tomorrow leave him there Talking of trobar clus with Daniel And the best craftsman sings out his friend s song Envies its vigor and deplores the technique Dispraises his own skill That s as you will And they discuss the dead man Plantagenet puts the riddle Did he love her And Arnaut parries Did he love your sister True he has praised her but in some opinion He wrote that praise only to show he had The favor of your party had been well received  You knew the man  You knew the man I am an artist you have tried both métiers You were born near him  Do we know our friends Say that he saw the castles say that he loved Maent Say that he loved her does it solve the riddle   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  End the discussion Richard goes out next day And gets a quarrel bolt shot through his vizard Pardons the bowman dies  Ends our discussion Arnaut ends In sacred odor that s apochryphal And we can leave the talk till Dante writes  Surely I saw and still before my eyes Goes on that headless trunk that bears for light Its own head swinging gripped by the dead hair And like a swinging lamp that says Ah me I severed men my head and heart Ye see here severed my life s counterpart  Or take En Bertrans  III  Ed eran due in uno ed uno in due Inferno XXVIII 125  I loved a woman The stars fell from heaven And always our two natures were in strife Bewildering spring and by the Auvezère Poppies and day s eyes in the green émail Rose over us and we knew all that stream And our two horses had traced out the valleys   Near Perigord  Knew the low flooded lands squared out with poplars In the young days when the deep sky befriended  And great wings beat above us in the twilight And the great wheels in heaven Bore us together surging and apart Believing we should meet with lips and hands  High high and sure and then the counterthrust Why do you love me Will you always love me But I am like the grass I can not love you Or Love and I love and love you And hate your mind not you your soul your hands  So to this last estrangement Tairiran  There shut up in his castle Tairiran s She who had nor ears nor tongue save in her hands Gone ah gone untouched unreachable She who could never live save through one person She who could never speak save to one person And all the rest of her a shifting change A broken bundle of mirrors    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  VILLANELLE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HOUR  I  I had over prepared the event that much was ominous With middle aging care I had laid out just the right books I almost turned down the right pages  Beauty is so rare a thing So few drink of my fountain  So much barren regret So many hours wasted And now I watch from the window rain wandering busses  Their little cosmos is shaken the air is alive with that fact In their parts of the city they are played on by diverse forces  I had over prepared the event  Beauty is so rare a thing So few drink at my fountain  Two friends a breath of the forest Friends Are people less friends because one has just at last found them   Villanelle The Psychological Hour  Twice they promised to come  Between the night and morning  Beauty would drink of my mind  Youth would awhile forget my youth is gone from me Youth would hear speech of beauty  II  Speak up You have danced so stiffly Someone admired your works And said so frankly  Did you talk like a fool The first night The second evening  But they promised again Tomorrow at tea time  III  Now the third day is here  no word from either No word from her nor him Only another man s note  Dear Pound I am leaving England  Ezra Pound   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SUNRISE ON RYDAL WATER  To E de S  Come down at dawn from windless hills Into the valley of the lake Where yet a larger quiet fills  The hour and mist and water make With rocks and reeds and island boughs One silence and one element Where wonder goes surely as once It went  By Galilean prows  Moveless the water and the mist Moveless the secret air above Hushed as upon some happy tryst  The poised expectancy of love What spirit is it that adores What mighty presence yet unseen What consummation works apace Between  These rapt enchanted shores  Never did virgin beauty wake Devouter to the bridal feast Than moves this hour upon the lake In adoration to the east   Sunrise on Rydal Water  Here is the bride a god may know The primal will the young consent Till surely upon the appointed mood Intent  The god shall leap and lo  Over the lake s end strikes the sun White flameless fire some purity  Thrilling the mist a splendor won Out of the world s heart Let there be Thoughts and atonements and desires Proud limbs and undeliberate tongue Where now we move with mortal care Among Immortal dews and fires  So the old mating goes apace Wind with the sea and blood with thought Lover with lover and the grace  Of understanding comes unsought When stars into the twilight steer Or thrushes build among the may Or wonder moves between the hills And day  Comes up on Rydal mere  John Drinkwater   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE MAGI  Out of what far off ancient cities  Did the wise kings see the star  Leaning from their towers of magic  Caspar Melchior Balthasar  In what strange marts did they barter In what ivory chests make stir Gathering for their eastern journey Gold and frankincense and myrrh  Nancy Campbell    TH E CABARET DANCER  Breathe not the word Tomorrow in her ears Tomorrow is for men who send their ships Over the sea to moor at alien slips  For dreamers dawdlers martyrs pioneers  Not for this golden mote To her appears No hovering dark that prophesies eclipse Grace of the swallow in the swaying hips Heart of the swallow knowing not the years  Breathe not a word of beauty that shall fade Of lagging steps of bare and lonely sorrow  On roads that other dancing feet have found Beyond the grove where life with laughter played Breathe not a word of that grim land Tomorrow  Lest she should quake to ashes at the sound  Hermann Hagedorn   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE TAPESTRY  O bygone raptures bygone tortures Why have you become no more Than the colors and the shadows Of a distant faded tapestry Wrinkled by a breeze  Lifted by tenderness I have sung This shall wing me through dusk Lighten the anguish of death  Stunned by betrayal I have groaned This shall darken the dawn Stab me with every sunbeam Lame me so long as I live  And now you are no more mine Than the colors and the shadows Of a distant faded tapestry Wrinkled by a breeze  Yet I continue to spend hours Figuring what lies beyond A window a doorway or a wall   The Chasm  TH E CHASM  Yesterday The world dreamed before me A golden meadow Silvered with rivers Larger than all eternity And yet so small That Here is the world I could say And lay it all In your little hand  But I spoke a woman s name And the darkness of a thousand nights Leaped from the past And dug between us A chasm of aching distance I called to you But only the years answered You faded faded And were lost  O phantom of today Méa of yesterday I thought there was no gulf Our love could not bridge   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POMEGRANATE  Pomegranate how prodigal Is the hour of your giving  The apple nymph basks content To apportion her tribute Blossoms and incense to Spring Substance to Fall But you you lift up In one riotous offering The fruit with the flower Moons interclustered with stars  Dryad impulsive or vain Is it fervor or weakness Who can dazzle Apollo  Richard Butler Glaenzer   The Heart on the Highroad  THE HEART ON THE HIGHROAD  Away from light and shelter warmth and peace How many and many a night of wind and rain My anxious heart its wanderings could not cease Leading you home amid the tempest s strain  Long long you have been safe from stormy skies Long long in shelter from the winter s chill But still the night wind shakes me with its cries And on my heart the icy rain falls still  CHINOISERIE  Is it the moon afar Yonder appears Nay tis the evening star Seen through my tears  J K Wetherill   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  CLOISTERED  To night the little girl nun died Her hands were laid Across her breast the last sun tried To kiss her quiet braid And where the little river cried Her grave was made  The little girl nun s soul in awe Went silently To where her brother Christ she saw Under the Living Tree He sighed and his face seemed to draw Her tears to see  He laid his hands on her hands mild And gravely blessed Blind they that kept you so he smiled With tears unguessed Saw they not Mary held a child Upon her breast  THE DEATH WATCH  A tree falls in the blast The other trees are sighing The Death Watch  Fast burn the candles fast She is long dying  A flower fades in the sun The other flowers are weeping See Dawn s at last begun Dead or but sleeping  A star falls tired from flight The other stars are flying It is o erpast the night She is long dying  INTUITION  My lover has no lute to sing to me My lover has no song to mark me fair His lips are strong and silent utterly He lays no foolish kiss upon my hair  My lover does not hold within his eyes Where all may see a torch of love aglow No tears he gives to me nor any sighs My lover speaks not but I know I know  Mary Carolyn Davies   POETRY A Magazine of Verse THROUGH THE WINDOW NEAR HIS BED  Through the window near his bed  On his tousled head All her magic on the sprite Poured the Lady of the night  Down a ladder came the lad  With the moonlight mad Down a ladder from his room To the moonlit garden s gloom  White with light was every limb  Moonlight maddened him As he nakedly came down To the garden s moonlit frown  Trod he underneath the trees  With a sprightly ease While the moonlight on his face Lingered with a winged grace  Thus he came to know the smart  In the trembling heart When that cruel bee the moon Stings one in her midnight noon   THE IDES OF MARCH  Just as amid cabals of his treacherous court Suspecting each rich curtain of a knife A king broods heavily Even so aware that flesh and bone are restless With secret news and undefined intention Sits on his shaking throne my winter soul  H C Long  BELGIUM  This is the field that was crushed in their dying And over and over the wind blows sighing A desolate sobbing searching wind Tis a low gray land of barren spaces And long rough ridges of burial places The grass bruised into the choking sod  The clouds are lank with a dull slow weeping And the mist enshrouds the place of their sleeping  Katharine Howard   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  FLY ON  O Dove you lay on the altar of her Called Venus called goddess of love Your wings were wounded you did not stir And you died mid her flowers O Dove  But a breath stirred the world it flooded to you And you quivered and lived O Dove And lifted your wings and flew and flew To Mary called mother of love  And you touched the son of Mary the maid By the great white throne of love But the flowers at Mary s footstool fade And you died mid her flowers O Dove  Oh live again Fly on to mine own Mine own bright garden of love The wind is cold round the ancient throne And my day desires you O Dove   Make No Vows  MAKE NO VOWS  I made a vow once one only I was young and I was lonely When I grew strong I said This vow Is too narrow for me now Who am I to be bound by old oaths I will change them as I change my clothes  But that ancient outworn vow Was like fetters upon me now It was hard to break hard to break Hard to shake from me hard to shake  I broke it by day but it closed upon me at night He is not free who is free only in the sun light He is not free who bears fetters in his dreams Nor he who laughs only by his dream s hid streams  Oh it costs much bright coin of strength to live Watch then where all your strength you give For I who would be so wild and wondrous now Must give give to break a bitter burdensome vow   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HARK TO THE WIND OF THE WORLD  Hark to the wind of the world The shafts of my life are far hurled  I cannot belong to you I belong to the cataract leaping I belong to the west wind weeping I belong to the white swan sleeping  I belong to the wild curlew  Away I say it must end Call me not call me not friend  I am false for I must be true I belong to the cedar swinging I belong to the silence ringing I belong to the noon sun singing  Where the singing god reed grew  Go further further away I will walk with you yet some day  But I will not belong to you I belong to the eagle flying I belong to the sea tide sighing I belong to the wilderness crying  I belong to dawn and the dew   If My  IF MY MOTHER KNEW  If my mother knew How our doves at dawn Shake me with their wings Wild bewildered wan When the white star sings And they would be gone  Would she from her sleep Rise and look afar Past our fold and keep To that pulsing star  If my mother knew  How the heath in flower With its faint perfume At the twilight hour Fills my little room Like some lady s bower  Would she from the hearth Rise and look again Past our piteous dearth To the purpling plain  If my mother knew How my heart will beat   Mother Knew  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  With the hope of hands For the fall of feet Though no pilgrim bands Find our narrow street  Would she from the loom Rise remembering so How the heart must roam Then would she let me go  I GIVE THANKS  There s one that I once loved so much I am no more the same I give thanks for that transforming touch I tell you not his name  He has become a sign to me For flowers and for fire For song he is a sign to me And for the broken lyre  And I have known him in a book And never touched his hand And he is dead I need not look  For him through his green land   I Give Thanks  Heaven may not be I have no faith But this desire I have To take my soul on my last breath T o lift it like a wave  And surge unto his star and say His friendship had been heaven And pray for clouds that closed his day May light at last be given  And say he shone at noon so bright I learned to run and rejoice And beg him for one last delight The true sound of his voice  There s one that once moved me so much I am no more the same And I pray I too I too may touch Some heart with singing flame  Grace Fallow Norton    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EDITORIAL COMMENT  CHRISTMAS AND THE POETS  O War or Battail s sound Was heard the World around The idle spear and shield were high up hung The hooked Chariot stood Unstained with hostile blood The Trumpet spake not to the armed throng  And kings sate still with awful eye As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by  But peacefull was the night  Wherein the Prince of light  His reign of peace upon the earth began The Winds with wonder whist Smoothly the waters kist  Whispering new joys to the wild Ocean Who now hath quite forgot to rave While Birds of Calm sit brooding on the charmed wave  At last surrounds their sight  A Globe of circular light  That with long beams the shame fac d night array d The helmed Chembim And sworded Seraphim  Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displaid Harping in loud and solemn quire With unexpressive notes to Heaven s new born Heir  Such musick as tis said  Before was never made  But where of old the sons of morning sung While the Creator Great His constellations set  And the wcll balanc t world on hinges hung And cast the dark foundations deep And bid the weltring waves their oosy channel keep   Christmas and the Poets  Ring out ye Crystall Sphears Once bless our human ears  If ye have power to touch our senses so And let your silver chime Move in melodious time  And let the Bass of Heav ns deep Organ blow And with your ninefold harmony Make up full consort to th Angelike symphony  For if such holy Song Enwrap our fancy long  Time will run back and fetch the age of gold And speckl d vanity Will sicken soon and die  And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould And Hell itself will pass away And leave her dolourous mansions to the peering day  Through the majestic colonnade of Milton s ode we walk with bowed heads and muted instruments in this year of grace 1915 What can be said for a world whose nineteen hundred and sixteenth Christmas dawns to the roar of guns a world which in nearly two thousand years of vaunted loyalty to the Prince of Peace has not yet molded its age of gold out of the refractory ore of races and nations What can be said for a world which with nothing to do but be happy in the use of its own riches and the contemplation of its own beauty prefers to divert those riches to agony and luxury and to destroy that beauty and pervert that happiness through unjust laws and ingenious devices and distorted ideals  It may be well to emphasize the command toward love and peace in the annual festival Men must come to it they   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  must love one another writes a modern observer of mundane excesses there will be war until they do From the first the poets have emphasized this ideal beginning with that great poet who said Love your enemies and through all the wars of racial jealousy political intrigue or religious perversion which have stained this planet for nineteen hundred years we hear men singing of the Prince of Peace and paradoxically flaunting the ideal of universal love English poets have sounded this note from their earliest carols until now Over four hundred years ago the anonymous author of God rest you merry gentlemen ended his Christmas song with this stanza  Now to the Lord sing praises All you within this place And with true love and brotherhood Each other now embrace This holy tide of Christmas All others doth deface Peace on earth is the refrain of most Christmas hymns even to this day and the idea so pervades the festival that soldiers in the trenches we are told make an informal truce in honor of it and return to normally friendly intercourse across the dead line of war When will the word of ultimate authority be obeyed When will men and nations accept as a working principle of life the command that they love one another When will time run back and fetch the age of gold We began with the heroic Milton let us end with this Christmas sonnet by a living poet Robert Bridges the Lau   Christmas and the Poets  reate whose spirit if tested might prove no less noble than that of the stern Puritan  Eternal Father who didst all create In whom we live and to whose bosom move To all men be Thy name known which is Love Till its loud praises sound at heaven s high gate Perfect Thy kingdom in our passing state That here on earth Thou mayst as well approve Our service as Thou ownest theirs above Whose joy we echo and in pain await  Grant body and soul each day their daily bread And should in spite of grace fresh woe begin Even as our anger soon is past and dead Be Thy remembrance mortal of our sin By Thee in paths of peace Thy Sheep be led And in the vale of terror comforted  H M  ON NEAR PERIGORD  The historical data for this poem are first Uc de St Circ s statement that Bertrans de Born was in love with the Lady Maent wife of Sir Tairiran of Montaignac and that when she turned him out he wrote a Canzon Domna pois de me no us cal My translation of this poem appeared first in Poetry and Drama over a year ago I reprint it here for clarity  THE CANZON  From the Provencal of En Bertrans dc Born Original composed about 1185 A D  Lady since you care nothing for me And since you have shut me away from you   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Causelessly I know not where to go seeking For certainly I will never again gather Joy so rich and if I find not ever A lady with look so speaking To my desire worth yours whom I have lost I ll have no other love at any cost  And since I could not find a peer to you Neither one so fair nor of such heart So eager and alert Nor with such art In attire nor so gay Nor with gift so bountiful and so true I will go out a searching Culling from each a fair trait To make me a borrowed lady Till I again find you ready  Bels Cembelins I take of you your color For it s your own and your glance Where love is A proud thing I do here For as to color and eyes I shall have missed nothing at all Having yours I ask of Midons Aelis of Montfort Her straight speech free running That my phantom lack not in cunning  At Chalais of the Viscountess I would That she give me outright Her two hands and her throat So take I my road To Rochechouart Swift foot to my Lady Anhes Seeing that Tristan s lady Iseutz had never Such grace of locks I do ye to wit Though she d the far fame for it  Of Audiart at Malemort Though she with a full heart   On Near Perigord  Wish me ill I d have her form that s laced So cunningly Without blemish for her love Breaks not nor turns aside I of Miels de ben demand Her straight fresh body She is so supple and young Her robes can but do her wrong  Her white teeth of the Lady Faidita I ask and the fine courtesy She hath to welcome one And such replies she lavishes Within her nest Of Bels Mirais the rest Tall stature and gaiety To make these avail She knoweth well betide No change nor turning aside  Ah Belz Senher Maent at last I ask naught from you Save that I have such hunger for This phantom As I ve for you such flame lap And yet I d rather Ask of you than hold another Mayhap right close and kissed Ah lady why have you cast Me out knowing you hold me so fast  Besides these strophes there is also a four line coda to his jongleur Papiol as follows  Papiol my lodestone go through all the courts sing this canzon how love fareth ill of late is fallen from his high estate  Second as to the possibility of a political intrigue behind the apparent love poem we have no evidence save that offered by my own observation of the geography of Perigord   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and Limoges I must leave the philologists and professional tacticians to decide whether Bertrans s proclivities for stirring up the barons were due to his liver or to military necessity When he did not keep them busy fighting each other they most certainly did close in upon him at least once  The traditional scene of Bertrans before King Henry Plantagenet is well recounted in Smith s Troubadours at Home It is vouched for by many old manuscripts and seems as well authenticated as most Provençal history though naturally there are found the usual perpetrators of historic doubt I can not develop the matter in the foregoing poem as it would overbalance the rest of the matter set forth and is extraneous to my main theme  If my hasty allusion to the scene of de Born and King Henry is obscure I can only reply that Heine has made an equally erudite allusion His poem in the Neue Gedichte entitled Bertrand de Born is as follows  Ein edler Stolz in alien Zugen Auf seiner Stirn Gedankenspur Er konnte jedes Herz besiegen Bertrand de Born der Troubadour  Es kirrten seine sussen Tone Die Lôwin des Plantagenet s Die Tochter auch die beiden Sonne Er fang sie alle in sein Netz  Wie er den Vater selbst bethorte In Thrànen schmolz des Kônigs Zorn Als er ihn lieblich reden hôrte Den Troubadour Bertrand de Born  E P   REVIEWS  NEW BOOKS OF VERSE  The New World by Witter Bynner Kennerley  To express democracy as emotion is no light motive for a poet The monarchical ideal the militaristic ideal personified in the figure of king or warrior has made and unmade nations and inspired half the great poems of the world but democracy dethroning both king and warrior sets up no such appealing figure for art to celebrate In fact it sets up no figure at all and its ideal of human brotherhood flattens easily into a platitude  Mr Bynner exalts this ideal to passion by prefiguring it in the love of man and woman He fuses it makes it workable gives it a place and a pedestal by thus relating the love of many with the love of one In so doing he accomplishes the difficult task of a poetic exposition of his social philosophy always presenting that philosophy not through abstractions but through concrete examples the loves and sorrows of individuals Gradually he builds up with beautiful art and always in the simple diction of everyday speech a clear and lofty expression of the beauty of human brotherhood and a prophecy of its universal power in a spiritualized world  This kind of expository poem is perhaps the most difficult to write so easily does its fire turn to the dust of argument Now and then Mr Bynner seems in danger of moralizing but in almost every case his mood freshens and bears him   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  away from the bogs His art lacks mass and weight perhaps it is a white sailed sloop racing over the deep waters of his theme not a heavy brig or a steel freighter veterans of storms The democracy it expresses is the democracy of a sensitive aristocrat who feels through imagination not that of a hard man of the people who feels through knowledge There is not in Mr Bynner such richness and fullness of experience of life as in Whitman or Mark Twain or that more modern democrat Edgar Lee Masters and thus his poem lacks the breadth and bigness of the works of these  But it has great beauty at times a lyric ecstacy a note clear fine pure It not only achieves with felicity its spiritual motive but incidentally sketches with light strokes a few living figures the steel worker the two brothers and even Celia who though dimmed by certain speeches is at times vivid in superlative loveliness  Having printed eight pages of this poem last April we will pause now merely for a salutation  The wind of death is a bright kiss Upon the lips Of every immigrant as upon yours and mine Theirs is the stinging brine And sun and open sea And theirs the arching sky eternity  H M Rivers to the Sea by Sara Teasdale Macmillan Who can review a book like this It would be like ana  lyzing the flowers of June for Mrs Filsinger s lyrics have the clarity the precision the grace and fragrance of flowers   New Books of Verse  They seem absolutely simple and sincere the utterance of a heart too full to hold its emotion the real lyric cry That is the score or more best of them have this beauty and the best are almost invariably in two or three tetrameter quatrains with alternate rhymes the simplest tune in the language In other measures she rarely rises to her highest level although Broadway and The Lights of New York are good sonnets and Spring in War Time uses admirably a plaintive little refrain In free verse she is least at home it is a pity she tries it  The poems have a girlish delicacy and all of them express an ardent love of life They are chiefly love songs and love songs of nature and the town keen emotions of joy or wistful longing vividly expressed But it seems futile to talk about them when they illustrate themselves so much more briefly and happily W e would like to quote seven or eight but must content ourselves with these two  APRIL  The roofs are shining from the rain  The sparrows twitter as they fly  And with a windy April grace  The little clouds go by  Yet the back yards are bare and brown With only one unchanging tree I could not be so sure of Spring Save that it sings in me  COME  Come when the pale moon like a petal Floats in the pearly dusk of spring   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Come with arms outstretched to take me Come with lips pursed up to cling  Come for life is a frail moth flying Caught in the web of the years that pass And soon we two so warm and eager Will be as the gray stones in the grass  At least a dozen other songs are as perfect as these Longing Debt Joy Morning Dusk in War Time too many to mention So let us end with this quatrain Swallow Flight because it expresses with such rare precision this poet s temperament  I love my hour of wind and light I love men s faces and their eyes I love my spirit s veering flight Like swallows under evening skies  H M  The Factories with Other Lyrics by Margaret Widdemer  John C Winston Co  Miss Widdemer has a motive and a message Certain tyrannies of modern society child labor prostitution war over worked poverty are an anguish in her heart and her wrath flames out in the Poems of Now achieving in one or two especially Teresina s Face the high beauty of true lyric passion and in others like The Beggars and A Modern Woman to Her Lover the less rare beauty of more consciously studied rhythmic statement Such poems being the intense expression of an individual woman s emotion speak for all womanly women utter their pity and wrath their increasing power against wrongs new and old   New Books of Verse  Again a few of the love songs are so strongly individualized as to become typical and a high lyric beauty exalts their simple measures Among the best are Siege Thought of You A Girl s Love Song and this Changed  These are the woods where my heart held fast Shadow green silence and lonely grace Now they are only a way you passed Leaving an empty place  These are my sea birds that circled wide Bearing my thoughts from the dust of things Only the wish to be by your side Lifts on their lagging wings  This is my world that was once so sweet All of itself in the morning dew Now it is only a road for your feet A sheltering place for you The grace of Miss Widdemer s touch is shown also in some of the lighter poems and her dramatic intuition of character in An Old Portrait Tw o or three poems are lovely in their feeling for the mysterious evanescence of life we hear the very flutter of wings in Wind litany and this Cloak of Dreams  They bade me follow fleet To my brothers work and play But the Cloak of Dreams blew over my feet Tangling them from the way  They bade me watch the skies For a signal dark or light But the Cloak of Dreams blew over my eyes Shutting them fast from sight  I have nor pain nor mirth Suffering nor desire   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The Cloak of Dreams twixt me and earth Wavers its filmy fire  I dream in dusk apart Hearing a strange bird sing And the Cloak of Dreams blows over my heart Blinding and sheltering  Altogether a very promising first volume  H M  Afternoons in April by Grace Hazard Conkling The New Poetry Series Houghton Mifflin Co Perhaps the most impressive feature of Afternoons In  April is joy joy in color joy in sound Grace Hazard Conkling is not of those who savor grief as they smell a flower All her winds are boon Her ship goes sailing down her dream rich with fragrance of myrrh and spikenard and light of beryls emeralds rubies opals Now and then we have snatches of the great song  I knew her first through her poems Golden Throated Pastoral Horn and To A Scarlet Tanager She deals with the classic tradition Pan trips through her pages Proserpina nymphs and dryads are all about us It is not surprising therefore to come upon such expressions as I would fain I pray you and other outworn patterns with here and there too reminiscent a phrase too pat a rhyme But there is no sentinel Almost every novel or book of poems I have read for years has had its sentinel sentinel eye sentinel star Trees have stood forth like sentinels I read Afternoons In April with fascinated dread congratulating   New Books of Verse  myself when I had crossed a field safely I went on expecting at every turn to see a sentinel step out from the shadow But he did not appear And I owe Mrs Conkling a personal gratitude  Alliteration should not be relegated utterly to the past if only technique be not too flagrant T o discard the right word because it beckons alliteration is as forced and affected as to over indulge the smooth tempter However in A Beethoven Andante The wood wind warbled wisely is a good deal of a mouthful and might have made even Swinburne recoil It seems to me that the most finished product of this book is the Symphony of a Mexican Garden which was printed in the first number of POETRY one stanza of which is  What junipers are these inlaid With flame of the pomegranate tree The god of gardens must have made This still unrumored place for thee To rest from immortality And dream within the splendid shade Some more elusive symphony Than orchestra has ever played  The Little Town perhaps because nearer the heart of  today invites re reading  They do not know you little town Who say that all roads lead to Rome I ve tramped the broad world up and down And every road leads home  P D   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A PAINTER POET  Collected Poems by A E The Macmillan Co  As one reads these poems one has a sense of hearing a deep sound in nature a sound that becomes more and more significant as one listens to it The leaves rustle the fire crackles a wind rises But behind these noises is the far deep sound of a river How is it that these short poems very many of them only of three stanzas give one the sense of fullness and profundity It is because they are all glimpses of the same river of vision  No poet of our civilization is so cosmic as A E Man for him is one with the world and one with the heavens Everything he knows everything he feels has a history that is before the stars and suns His own face reflected in an actual river recalls the brooding of the Spirit over the waters The sorrow and hopelessness that has entered his own heart is the shadow of the dark age that the world has entered into The thought in this stanza is not far fetched for him  We liken love to this and that our thought The echo of a deeper being seems We kiss because God once for beauty sought Within a world of dreams Behind these poems is a philosophy that has attracted to  A E many disciples His personal thought is explicit in A New World and The Man to the Angel I close mine eyes from dream to be The diamond rayed again  As in the ancient hours ere we Forgot ourselves to men   A Painter Poet  and  They are but the slaves of light Who have never known the gloom And between the dark and bright Willed in silence their own doom  Men are the strayed heaven dwellers the gods who have forgot themselves to men the angels who have willed in silence their own doom And in all the wise and pious things A E has to say there is the heroic note Everywhere there is an insistence on the will the sword of will the  imperial will His last counsellor declares  Only be thou thyself the goal In which the wars of time shall cease  but the second counsel is often remembered by A E  Make of thy silence words to shake The long enthroned Kings of Earth Make of thy will the force to break Their towers of wantonness and mirth  It is this heroic note that makes this poetry of mystical vision direct and bracing  The power is ours to make or mar Our fate as on the earliest morn The Darkness and the Radiance are  Creatures within the spirit born Yet bathed in gloom too long we might Forget how we imagined light  A short note on A E s poems can only be a résumé of many remarkable points One might dwell on his eye for color and his power of creating landscape in poetry qualities that belong to him as one of Ireland s distinctive painters One might speak too about that power he possesses the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  power that is so effective when a real poet uses it the power of rhetoric When one reads that oration On behalf of some Irishmen not Followers of Tradition one has to acknowledge that eloquence in verse could hardly be more stirring This oration is by way of reply to the ultra Celtic party who would deny the Irish heritage to those who were not of Gaelic name or Gaelic stock And yet no Irish poet has had such reverence for the Celtic past of Ireland He has dared to make the obscure deities of Celtic mythology as potent as the Olympians when he speaks of Angus Dana or Lugh he treats them as great and imposing figures The heroic age for him is the heroic age in Ireland  A E s verse is built up on simple forms but his command of vowel sounds makes all his lines sonorous His poems in alexandrines have lovely sound Perhaps the most perfect lyric in the collection is Sacrifice its form has the delicate beauty of a rare sea shell  Padraic Colum  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  Mr William Stanley Braithwaite poetry editor of the Boston Transcript is joining the procession He has discovered free verse he has even discovered POETRY  To be sure his review of Poetry of the Year in the Transcript of Oct 30th does not mention the magazine or   Our Contemporaies  the work it has done for the art except by listing our poems for the first time among the other lists at the end of the article and selecting a large number for his next anthology All the same POETRY S influence permeated Mr Braithwaite s judgments Does he not place the work of Amy Lowell and Wallace Stevens and Robert Frost among his Five Best Poems conspicuously printed in the middle of the page And is not the portrait which begins his article that of Miss Amy Lowell Now Firmly Established in the First Rank of American Poetry And have not the two great successes of the year been the typically American poets Frost and Masters both of whom POETRY printed in 1914 and neither of whom I think did Mr Braithwaite mention a year ago  Seriously we welcome this Saul among the prophets It is a matter of comparative indifference whether POETRY is recognized so long as it is felt If the magazine is a living force in the mind of Mr Braithwaite and other students and lovers of the art what matter whether or not they acknowledge or even perceive its very evident influence  One has only to contrast his review of this year s poetry with that of a year ago to see how agreeably he has developed in sweetness and light how completely his attitude toward modern verse has been revolutionized by the reading of POETRY and other new magazines and by personal intercourse with a number of more or less radical poets We even find him saying a good word for the Imagists   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Whether employing the medium of vers libre or metre they have shown especially in a certain intensifying quality of mood the first note of pure romanticism in English poetry of the last decade In this poetry as often as it is to be found in other verse of equal quantity there speaks that alluring voice whose secret is the eternal and pure wizardry of Keats  Indeed the image even penetrates his definition of the art we note that  The essence of poetry is in the mental and emotional image and the vitality of the image to weather the usage of familiarity by reading generations is in the personalized spiritual force of the poet  Which being interpreted means that Mr Braithwaite is climbing up to date and soon even T S Eliot will be taking law and gospel from the Transcript Good for Boston  CORRESPONDENCE  A RECANTATION  Dear Editor I take back most of what I have said to you and others and thought to myself about Ezra Pound And I would like to make an ordeal of it by speaking in a public meeting or at least to a public person for I want not only to clear myself of the vestments of ingratitude toward one who is a best friend of the muses but to burn the vestments to ashes I begin to like Pound very much what s more to the point I begin to learn from him or perhaps having been learning from him through the months of my distaste I am at last burning with a fanaticism to shout the  A Recantation  admission from the house top He is healthy he is ardent for anybody s clever verbal shift that adds a new trick to the stock of expression he is fertile in new tricks himself and he is learned in the originals of literature of other lands besides our sandy one At least he is more learned than I am He knows things I want to know I envy him a little but I begrudge him nothing because what he has and knows he has the knack of shipping in an open package without the aid of refrigeration or injurious preservatives What his secret is I know not but it is the informing breath of all literature that lives  I once wrote you a letter about Pound that I thought was clever I remember one of my gems was a comment on a batch of his poems in POETRY as the scrapings of his palette Well I say now to myself then what if they were the scrapings of his palette if the colors were such as I had never used before nor heard of I don t know how to use them now but I am trying to which is to my credit I believe As I expect to make a success of it I hasten to acknowledge my debt freely and in admiration  I may still reserve an opinion that he prints too much but I am not sure that is not a feeling somewhat mixed with envy His worst stuff as I see it at least shows a healthy enthusiasm for his own experiments and the allowable exasperation of a brave artist who on looking up from his lonely and exhausting task meets the stupid indifference of superficial people In all the years I have been humming pretty tunes to myself and calling them poetry he has been   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  making a dust and getting dirty and sweating in old tombs delving out stuff that never stales and not caring at all how stained his copy is Why should he when

of the colleges and universities during the past year and have been pleased to find the English departments echoing the cries and counter cries heard loudest in the little editorials in the back of this publication There is no doubt that here they take their point of departure for discussion Such being the case I wish to urge upon any professor or advanced student of English reading this letter that he take measures that the magazine be more openly recognized that it be subscribed for and circulated more systematically that it be present not only as an atmosphere and influence but as much in evidence in its physical form as that great American influence the Saturday Evening Post At present I find the magazine oftener in the brain of the professor than on his table  Vachel Lindsay  NOTES

WOMAN  By Fiona Macleod  ALL that exists of a little book to have been en  titled Runes of Woman is here brought to  gether with a brief preface and a prelude written from the heart of another woman As Fiona Macleod once explained in an unpublished letter the book she hoped to complete would doubtless reach more people than anything else of a remoter kind because of its personal note and its modernity That she formed a definite order in the presentation of these Runes had the book been completed I am assured by the last letter received from her This book of verse would be called Runes of Woman despite the Rune of Women and The Rune of the  Passion of Woman being already so well known and in From the Hills of Dream volume I think it would be incomplete without them I may add that there

notable volume of verse published this year in this country is Miss Harriet Monroe s volume entitled You and I The book is sentient with things in the heart of today the dominant note is the rising note of human sympathy William Allen White in the Emporia Kan Gazette  With the poise and freedom of one following a bright ideal she administers her magazine in favor of all She writes as freely and unaffectedly as though she lived her life only for her own art In this volume Miss Monroe shows herself so finely tempered as to realize the beauty of modern city life even in modern inventions Not in the robust versifier manner of Kipling but in the delicately imaginative way of the true poet Again Miss Monroe is all compassion for the delicately wasted lives of the poor in poem after poem this is the theme  Boston Herald  She is modern strong original and in the best of her verse is felt a certain timeless element which makes for great poetry  Kansas City Star  You and I has fire passion and
