 THE PIPER  GEORGE BORROW in his Lavengro Tells us of a Welshman who  By some excess of mother wit Framed a harp and played on it Built a ship and sailed to sea  And steered it home to melody Of his own making I indeed Might write for Everyman to read A thaumalogue of wonderment More wonderful but rest content With celebrating one I knew Who built his pipes and played them too No more  Ah played Therein is all The hounded thing the hunter s call The shudder when the quarry s breath Is drowned in blood and stilled in death The marriage dance the pulsing vein   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The kiss that must be given again The hope that Ireland like a rose Sees shining thro her tale of woes The battle lost the long lament For blood and spirit vainly spent And so on thro the varying scale Of passion that the western Gael Knows and by miracle of art Draws to the chanter from the heart Like water from a hidden spring To leap or murmur weep or sing  I see him now a little man In proper black whey bearded wan With eyes that scan the eastern hills Thro thick gold rimm√®d spectacles His hand is on the chanter Lo The hidden spring begins to flow In waves of magic He is dead These seven years but bend your head And listen Rising from the clay The Master plays The Ring of Day It mounts and falls and floats away Over the sky line then is gone Into the silence of the dawn  Joseph Campbell   BEYOND THE STARS  Three days I heard them grieve when I lay dead  It was so strange to me that they should weep  Tall candles burned about me in the dark  And a great crucifix was on my breast  And a great silence filled the lonesome room  I heard one whisper Lo the dawn is breaking  And he has lost the wonder of the day  Another came whom I had loved on earth  And kissed my brow and brushed my dampened hair Softly she spoke Oh that he should not see  The April that his spirit bathed in Birds Are singing in the orchard and the grass  That soon will cover him is growing green  The daisies whiten on the emerald hills  And the immortal magic that he loved  Wakens again and he has fallen asleep  Another said Last night I saw the moon  Like a tremendous lantern shine in heaven  And I could only think of him and sob For I remembered evenings wonderful  When he was faint with Life s sad loveliness  And watched the silver ribbons wandering far  Along the shore and out upon the sea  Oh I remembered how he loved the world  The sighing ocean and the flaming stars   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The everlasting glamour God has given His tapestries that wrap the earth s wide room I minded me of mornings filled with rain When he would sit and listen to the sound As if it were lost music from the spheres He loved the crocus and the hawthorn hedge He loved the shining gold of buttercups And the low droning of the drowsy bees That boomed across the meadows He was glad At dawn or sundown glad when Autumn came With her worn livery and scarlet crown And glad when Winter rocked the earth to rest Strange that he sleeps today when Life is young And the wild banners of the Spring are blowing With green inscriptions of the old delight  I heard them whisper in the quiet room I longed to open then my sealed eyes And tell them of the glory that was mine There was no darkness where my spirit flew There was no night beyond the teeming world Their April was like winter where I roamed Their flowers were like stones where now I fared Earth s day it was as if I had not known What sunlight meant Yea even as they grieved For all that I had lost in their pale place I swung beyond the borders of the sky And floated through the clouds myself the air    Beyond the Stars  Myself the ether yet a matchless being  Whom God had snatched from penury and pain  To draw across the barricades of heaven  I clomb beyond the sun beyond the moon  In flight on flight I touched the highest star  I plunged to regions where the Spring is born  Myself I asked not how the April wind  Myself the elements that are of God  Up flowery stairways of eternity  I whirled in wonder and untrammeled joy  An atom yet a portion of His dream  His dream that knows no end I was the rain I was the dawn I was the purple east I was the moonlight on enchanted nights Yet time was lost to me I was a flower For one to pluck who loved me I was bliss And rapture splendid moments of delight And I was prayer and solitude and hope And always always always I was love I tore asunder flimsy doors of time And through the windows of my soul s new sight I saw beyond the ultimate bounds of space I was all things that I had loved on earth The very moonbeam in that quiet room The very sunlight one had dreamed I lost The soul of the returning April grass The spirit of the evening and the dawn   The perfume in unnumbered hawthorn blooms There was no shadow on my perfect peace No knowledge that was hidden from my heart I learned what music meant I read the years I found where rainbows hide where tears begin I trod the precincts of things yet unborn  Yea while I found all wisdom being dead They grieved for me I should have grieved for them  Charles Hanson Towne   X0PIK0S  The ancient songs Pass deathward mournfully  Cold lips that sing no more and withered wreaths Regretful eyes and drooping breasts and wings Symbols of ancient songs Mournfully passing Down to the great white surges Watched of none Save the frail sea birds And the lithe pale girls Daughters of Okeanos  And the songs pass From the green land Which lies upon the waves as a leaf On the flowers of hyacinth And they pass from the waters The manifold winds and the dim moon And they come Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk To the quiet level lands That she keeps for us all That she wrought for us all for sleep In the silver days of the earth s dawning Proserpine daughter of Zeus   And we turn from the Kuprian s breasts And we turn from thee Phoibos Apollon And we turn from the music of old And the hills that we loved and the meads And we turn from the fiery day And the lips that were over sweet For silently Brushing the fields with red shod feet With purple robe Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame Death Thou hast come upon us  And of all the ancient songs Passing to the swallow blue halls By the dark streams of Persephone This only remains That in the end we turn to thee Death That we turn to thee singing One last song  O Death Thou art an healing wind That blowest over white flowers A tremble with dew Thou art a wind flowing   chorixos Over long leagues of lonely sea Thou art the dusk and the fragrance Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling Thou art the pale peace of one Satiate with old desires Thou art the silence of beauty And we look no more for the morning We yearn no more for the sun Since with thy white hands Death Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets The slim colorless poppies Which in thy garden alone Softly thou gatherest And silently And with slow feet approaching And with bowed head and unlit eyes We kneel before thee And thou leaning towards us Caressingly layest upon us Flowers from thy thin cold hands And smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart Thou sealest our eyes And the illimitable quietude Comes gently upon us Richard Aldington    TO A GREEK MARBLE  Potnia potnia  White grave goddess Pity my sadness O silence of Paros  I am not of these about thy feet These garments and decorum I am thy brother Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee And thou hearest me not  I have whispered thee in thy solitudes Of our loves in Phrygia The far ecstasy of burning noons When the fragile pipes Ceased in the cypress shade And the brown fingers of the shepherd Moved over slim shoulders And only the cicada sang  I have told thee of the hills And the lisp of reeds And the sun upon thy breasts  And thou hearest me not Potnia potnia Thou hearest me not  Richard Aldington   AU VIEUX JARDIN  I have sat here happy in the gardens  Watching the still pool and the reeds  And the dark clouds  Which the wind of the upper air  Tore like the green leafy boughs  Of the divers hued trees of late summer But though I greatly delight  In these and the water lilies  That which sets me nighest to weeping Is the rose and white color of the smooth flag stones  And the pale yellow grasses  Among them  Richard Aldington   UNDER TWO WINDOWS  T AUBADE  The dawn is here and the long night through I have never seen thy face Though my feet have worn the patient grass at the gate of thy dwelling place  While the white moon sailed till red in the west it found the far world edge No leaflet stirred of the leaves that climb to garland thy window ledge  Yet the vine had quivered from root to tip and opened its flowers again If only the low moon s light had glanced on a moving casement pane  Warm was the wind that entered in where the barrier stood ajar And the curtain shook with its gentle breath white as young lilies are  But there came no hand all the slow night through to draw the folds aside I longed as the moon and the vine leaves longed or to set the casement wide   Under Two Windows  Three times in a low hung nest there dreamed his five sweet notes a bird And thrice my heart leaped up at the sound I thought thou hadst surely heard  But now that thy praise is caroled aloud by a thousand throats awake Shall I watch from afar and silently as under the moon for thy sake  Nay bold in the sun I speak thy name I too and I wait no more Thy hand thy face in the window niche but thy kiss at the open door  II NOCTURNE  My darling come The wings of the dark have wafted the sunset away And there s room for much in a summer night but no room for delay  A still moon looketh down from the sky and a wavering moon looks up From every hollow in the green hills that holds a pool in its cup  The woodland borders are wreathed with bloom elder viburnum rose   The young trees yearn on the breast of the wind that sighs of love as it goes  The small stars drown in the moon washed blue but the greater ones abide With Vega high in the midmost place Altair not far aside  The glades are dusk and soft the grass where the flower of the elder gleams Mist white moth like a spirit awake in the dark of forest dreams  Arcturus beckons into the east Antares toward the south That sendeth a zephyr sweet with thyme to seek for thy sweeter mouth  Shall the blossom wake the star look down all night and have naught to see Shall the reeds that sing by the wind brushed pool say nothing of thee and me  My darling comes My arms are content my feet are guiding her way There is room for much in a summer night but no room for delay  Mrs Schuyler Van Rensselaer   THE SINGING PLACE  Cold may lie the day And bare of grace At night I slip away To the Singing Place  A border of mist and doubt Before the gate And the Dancing Stars grow still As hushed I wait Then faint and far away I catch the beat In broken rhythm and rhyme Of joyous feet Lifting waves of sound That will rise and swell If the prying eyes of thought Break not the spell Rise and swell and retreat  And fall and flee As over the edge of sleep They beckon me  And I wait as the seaweed waits For the lifting tide   To ask would be to awake To be denied I cloud my eyes in the mist That veils the hem And then with a rush I am past I am Theirs and of Them And the pulsing chant swells up To touch the sky And the song is joy is life  And the song am I The thunderous music peals Around o erhead  The dead would awake to hear If there were dead But the life of the throbbing Sun Is in the song And we weave the world anew And the Singing Throng Fill every corner of space  Over the edge of sleep I bring but a trace Of the chants that pulse and sweep In the Singing Place  Lily A Long   IMMURED  Within this narrow cell that I call me  I was imprisoned ere the worlds began  And all the worlds must run as first they ran In silver star dust ere I shall be free I beat my hands against the walls and find It is my breast I beat O bond and blind  Lily A Long   NOGI  Great soldier of the fighting clan Across Port Arthur s frowning face of stone You drew the battle sword of old Japan And struck the White Tsar from his Asian throne  Once more the samurai sword Struck to the carved hilt in your loyal hand That not alone your heaven descended lord Should meanly wander in the spirit land  Your own proud way O eastern star Grandly at last you followed Out it leads To that high heaven where all the heroes are Lovers of death for causes and for creeds  Harriet Monroe   THE JESTER  I have known great gold Sorrows Majestic Griefs shall serve me watchfully Through the slow pacing morrows I have knelt hopeless where sea echoing Dim endless voices cried of suffering Vibrant and far in broken litany Where white magnolia and tuberose hauntingly Pulsed their regretful sweets along the air All things most tragical most fair Have still encompassed me   I dance where in the screaming market place The dusty world that watches buys and sells With painted merriment upon my face Whirling my bells Thrusting my sad soul to its mockery  I have known great gold Sorrows Shall they not mock me these pain haunted ones If it shall make them merry and forget That grief shall rise and set With the unchanging unforgetting suns Of their relentless morrows  Margaret Widdemer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE BEGGARS  The little pitiful worn laughing faces Begging of Life for Joy  I saw the little daughters of the poor Tense from the long day s working strident gay Hurrying to the picture place There curled A hideous flushed beggar at the door Trading upon his horror eyeless maimed Complacent in his profitable mask They mocked his horror but they gave to him From the brief wealth of pay night and went in To the cheap laughter and the tawdry thoughts Thrown on the screen in to the seeking hand Covered by darkness to the luring voice Of Horror boy masked whispering of rings Of silks of feathers bought so cheap with just Their slender starved child bodies palpitant For Beauty Laughter Passion that is Life A frock of satin for an hour s shame A coat of fur for two days servitude And the clothes last the thought runs on within The poor warped girl minds drugged with changeless days Who cares or knows after the hour is done Poor little beggars at Life s door for Joy   The Beggars  The old man crouched there eyeless horrible Compiacerli in the marketable mask That earned his comforts and they gave to him  But ah the little painted wistful faces Questioning Life for Joy  Margaret Widdemer   REVIEWS AND COMMENTS  MOODY S POEMS  HE Poems and Plays of William Vaughn  Moody will soon be published in two  volumes by the Houghton Mifflin Co Our  present interest is in the volume of poems  which are themselves an absorbing drama Moody had a slowly maturing mind the vague vastness of his young dreams yielded slowly to a man s more definite vision of the spiritual magnificence of life When he died at two score years he was just beginning to think his problem through to reconcile after the manner of the great poets of the earth the world with God Apparently the unwritten poems cancelled by death would have rounded out in art of an austere perfection the record of that reconciliation for nowhere do we feel this passion of high serenity so strongly as in the first act of an uncompleted drama The Death of Eve  Great minded youth must dream and modern dreams of the meaning of life lack the props and pillars of the old dogmatism Vagueness confusion and despair are a natural inference from the seeming chaos of evil and good of pain and joy Moody from the beginning took the whole scheme of things for his province as a truly heroic poet should there are always large spaces on his   Moody s Poems  canvas In his earlier poetry both the symbolic Masque of Judgment and the shorter poems derived from present day subjects we find him picturing the confusion stating the case so to speak against God Somewhat in the terms of modern science is his statement the universe plunging on toward its doom of darkness and lifelessness divine fervor of creation lapsing divine fervor of love doubting despairing of the life it made sweeping all away with a vast inscrutable gesture  This seems to be the mood of the Masque of Judgment a mood against which that very human archangel Raphael protests in most appealing lines The poet broods over the earth  The earth that has the blue and little flowers with all its passionate pageantry of life and love Like his own angel he is  a truant still While battle rages round the heart of God The lamps are spent at the end of judgment day and naked from their seats The stars arise with lifted hands and wait This conflict between love and doubt is the motive also of Gloucester Moors The Daguerreotype Old Pourquoi those three noblest perhaps of the present day poems also of The Brute and The Menagerie and of that fine poem manqu√© the Ode in Time of Hesitation The Fie Bringer is an effort at another theme redemption light after darkness But it is not so spontaneous as the Masque though simpler clearer more dramatic in    form it is more deliberate and intellectual and not so star lit with memorable lines The Fire Bringer is an expression of aspiration the poet longs for light demands it will wrest it from God s right hand like Prometheus But his triumph is still theory not experience The reader is hardly yet convinced  If one feels a grander motive in such poems as the one act Death of Eve and The Fountain or the less perfectly achieved I Am the Woman it is not because of the tales they tell but because of the spirit of faith that is in them a spirit intangible indefinable but indomitable and triumphant At last we feel this poet already under the shadow of death sees a terrible splendid sunrise and offers us the glory of it in his art  The Fountain is a truly magnificent expression of spiritual triumph in failure and incidentally of the grandeur of Arizona that tragic wonderland of ancient and future gods Those Spanish wanderers dying in the desert in whose half madness dreams and realities mingle assume in those stark spaces the stature of universal humanity contending to the last against relentless fate In the two versions of The Death of Eve both narrative and dramatic one feels also this wild fierce triumph this faith in the glory of life Especially in the dramatic fragment by its sureness of touch and simple austerity of form and by the majesty of its figure of the aged Eve Moody s art reached its most heroic height We have here the beginning of great things   Bohemian Poetry  The spirit of this poet may be commended to those facile bards who lift up their voices between the feast and the cigars whose muses dance to every vague emotion and strike their flimsy lutes for every light o love Here was one who went to his desk as to an altar resolved that the fire he lit the sacrifice he offered should be perfect and complete He would burn out his heart like a taper that the world might possess a living light He would tell once more the grandeur of life he would sing the immortal song  That such devotion is easy of attainment in this clamorous age who can believe Poetry like some of Moody s poetry of a high structural simplicity strict and bare in form pure and austere in ornament implies a grappling with giants and wrestling with angels it is not to be achieved without deep living and high thinking without intense persistent intellectual and spiritual struggle  H M  BOHEMIAN POETRY  An Anthology of Modern Bohemian Poetry translated by  P Selver Henry J Drane London  This is a good anthology of modern Bohemian poetry accurately translated into bad and sometimes even ridiculous English Great credit is due the young translator for his care in research and selection The faults   of his style though deplorable are not such as to obscure the force and beauty of his originals  One is glad to be thus thoroughly assured that contemporary Bohemia has a literature in verse sensitive to the outer world and yet national Mr Selver s greatest revelation is Petr Bezruc poet of the mines  The poetry of Brezina Sova and Vrchlicky is interesting but Bezruc s Songs of Silesia have the strength of a voice coming de profundis  A hundred years in silence I dwelt in the pit  The dust of the coal has settled upon my eyes  Bread with coal is the fruit that my toiling bore  That is the temper of it Palaces grow by the Danube nourished by his blood He goes from labor to labor he rebels he hears a voice mocking  I should find my senses and go to the mine once more  And in another powerful invective  I am the first who arose of the people of Teschen  They follow the stranger s plough the slaves fare downwards  He thanks God he is not in the place of the oppressor and ends  Thus twas done The Lord wills it Night sank o er my people Our doom was sealed when the night had passed In the night I prayed to the Demon of Vengeance The first Beskydian bard and the last   The Music of the Human Heart  This poet is distinctly worth knowing He is the truth where our red bloods and magazine socialists are usually a rather boresome pose  As Mr Selver has tried to make his anthology representative of all the qualities and tendencies of contemporary Bohemian work it is not to be supposed that they are all of the mettle of Bezruc  One hears with deep regret that Vrchlicky is just dead after a life of unceasing activity He has been a prime mover in the revival of the Czech nationality and literature He has given them besides his own work an almost unbelievable number of translations from the foreign classics Dante Schiller Leopardi For the rest I must refer the reader to Mr Selver s introduction  Ezra Pound  THE MUSIC OF THE HUMAN HEART  This title phrase has not been plucked from the spacious lawn of Bartlett s Familiar Quotations It grew in the agreeable midland yard of Mr Walt Mason s newspaper verse and appeared in a tribute of his to Mr James Whitcomb Riley whose fifty ninth birthday anniversary falling on the seventh of October has been widely celebrated in the American public libraries and daily press   Mr Riley s fine gift to his public the special happiness his genius brings to his readers cannot for lack of space be adequately described or even indicated here Perhaps a true if incomplete impression of the beauty of his service may be conveyed by repeating a well known passage of Mr Lowes Dickinson s Letters from John Chinaman a passage which I can never read without thinking very gratefully of James Whitcomb Riley and of what his art has done for American poetry readers  Mr Dickinson says  In China our poets and literary men have taught their successors for long generations to look for good not in wealth not in power not in miscellaneous activity but in a trained a choice an exquisite appreciation of the most simple and universal relations of life To feel and in order to feel to express or at least to understand the expression of all that is lovely in nature of all that is poignant and sensitive in man is to us in itself a sufficient end The pathos of life and death the long embrace the hand stretched out in vain the moment that glides forever away with its freight of music and light into the shadow and bush of the haunted past all that we have all that eludes us a bird on the wing a perfume escaped on the gale to all these things we are trained to respond and the response is what we call literature  Among Mr Riley s many distinguished faculties of execution in expressing in stimulating an exquisite appreciation of the most simple and universal relations of life one faculty has been in so far as I know very little mentioned I mean his mastery in creating character Mr Riley has expressed has incarnated in the melodies and harmonies of his poems not merely several   The Music of the Human Heart  living breathing human creatures as they are made by their destinies but a whole world of his own a vivid world of country roads and country town streets peopled with farmers and tramps and step mothers and children trailing clouds of glory even when they boast of the superiorities of Renselaer a world of hardworking women and hard luck men and poverty and prosperity and drunkards and raccoons and dogs and grandmothers and lovers To have presented through the medium of rhythmic chronicle a world so sharply limned so funny so tragic so mean so noble seems to us in itself a striking achievement in the craft of verse  No mere word of criticism can of course evoke at all as example can Mr Riley s genius of identification with varied human experiences the remarkable concentration and lyric skill of his characterization Here are two poems of his on the same general theme grief in the presence of death We may well speak our pride in the wonderful range of inspiration and the poetic endowment which can create on the same subject musical stories of the soul as diverse as searching as fresh and true as the beloved poems of Bereaved and His Mother  BEREAVED  Let me come in where you sit weeping aye  Let me who have not any child to die  Weep with you for the little one whose love  I have known nothing of   The little arms that slowly slowly loosed Their pressure round your neck the hands you used To kiss Such arms such hands I never knew  May I not weep with you  Fain would I be of service say something Between the tears that would be comforting But ah so sadder than yourselves am I  Who have no child to die  HIS MOTHER  Dead my wayward boy my own Not the Law s but mine the good God s free gift to me alone Sanctified by motherhood  Bad you say well who is not Brutal With a heart of stone And red handed Ah the hot Blood upon your own  I come not with downward eyes To plead for him shamedly God did not apologize When He gave the boy to me  Simply I make ready now For His verdict You prepare You have killed us both and how Will you face us There  E W  THE OPEN DOOR  Fears have been expressed by a number of friendly critics that POETRY may become a house of refuge for minor poets  The phrase is somewhat worn Paragraphers have done their worst for the minor poet while they have   The Open Door  allowed the minor painter sculptor actor worst of all architect to go scot free The world which laughs at the experimenter in verse walks negligently through our streets and goes seriously even reverently to the annual exhibitions in our cities examining hundreds of pictures and statues without expecting even the prize winners to be masterpieces  During the past year a score of more of cash prizes ranging from one hundred to fifteen hundred dollars were awarded in Pittsburgh Chicago Washington New York and Boston for minor works of modern art No word of superlative praise has been uttered for one of them the first prize winner in Pittsburgh was a delicately pretty picture by a second rate Englishman in Chicago it was a clever landscape by a promising young American If a single prize winner in the entire list many of which were bought at high prices by public museums was a masterpiece no critic has yet dared to say so  In fact such a word would be presumptuous since no contemporary can utter the final verdict Our solicitous critics should remember that Coleridge Shelley Keats Burns were minor poets to the subjects of King George the Fourth Poe and Whitman to the subjects of King Longfellow Moreover we might remind them that Drayton Lovelace Herrick and many another delicate lyrist of the anthologies whose perfect songs show singular tenacity of life remain minor poets through the   slightness of their motive they created little masterpieces not great ones  The Open Door will be the policy of this magazine may the great poet we are looking for never find it shut or half shut against his ample genius To this end the editors hope to keep free of entangling alliances with any single class or school They desire to print the best English verse which is being written today regardless of where by whom or under what theory of art it is written Nor will the magazine promise to limit its editorial comments to one set of opinions Without muzzles and braces this is manifestly impossible unless all the critical articles are written by one person  NOTES AND ANNOUNCEMENTS  Mr Ezra Pound has consented to act as foreign correspondent of POETRY keeping its readers informed of the present interests of the art in England France and elsewhere  The response of poets on both sides of the Atlantic has been most encouraging so that the quality of the next few numbers is assured
