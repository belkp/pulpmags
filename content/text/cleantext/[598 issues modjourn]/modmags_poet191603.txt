with black and white chequered bodies Leaping from twig to twig of the grease  wood To look at the water spilled on the ground By the herder who went by with three lean cattle Climbing out of the blue and gold shimmer of morning There was the shallow well with stones piled about it The coarse tattered rope the battered tin bucket And the nose of my pony cropping thin grass not far off Then gray sagebrush and silence At the horizon   The heat rose and fell Sharp flickering arpeggios The wind started up somewhere Then stopped The blue smoke of my cigarette Wavered and failed I was drowsing And it seemed to me in my dream I was riding To a low brown cluster of squat adobe houses Under the brow of a red barren mesa Where the track of a wagon trail passed dipped and van  ished By a corral with walls of rough plastered stone And I saw Looking down at the houses An Indian with a red sash flannel shirt and blue trousers And a red band about his coarse black hair Eyes black as an antelope Looked up at me Sheep were feeding about him And I said to him Where do you come from And he replied From Nazareth beyond the desert In Galilee   Mexican Quarter  MEXICAN QUARTER  By an alley lined with tumble down shacks And street lamps askew half sputtering Feebly glimmering on gutters choked with filth and dogs Scratching their mangy backs Half naked children are running about Women puff cigarettes in black doorways Crickets are crying Men slouch sullenly Into the shadows Behind a hedge of cactus The smell of a dead horse Mingles with the smell of tamales frying  And a girl in a black lace shawl Sits in a rickety chair by the square of unglazed window And sees the explosion of the stars Fiercely poised on the velvet sky And she seems humming to herself Stars if I could reach you You are so very clear that it seems as if I could reach you I would give you all to the Madonna s image On the gray plastered altar behind the paper flowers So that Juan would come back to me And we could live again those lazy burning hours Forgetting the tap of my fan and my sharp words And I would only keep four of you   Those two blue white ones overhead To put in my ears And those two orange ones yonder To fasten on my shoe buckles  A little further along the street A man squats stringing a brown guitar The smoke of his cigarette curls round his hair And he too is humming but other words Think not that at your window I wait New love is better the old is turned to hate Fate Fate All things pass away Life is forever youth is but for a day Love again if you may  Before the golden moons are blown out of the sky And the crickets die Babylon and Samarkand Are mud walls in a waste of sand  CLIFF DWELLING  The canyon is heaped with stones and undergrowth The heat that falls from the sky Beats at the walls slides and reverberates Down in a wave of gray dust and white fire Choking the breath and eyes   Cliff Duelling  The ponies straggle and scramble Half way up along the canyon wall Their listless riders seldom lift A weary hand to guide their feet Stones are loosened and clatter Down to the sun baked depths  Nothing ever has lived here Nothing could ever live here Two hawks screaming and wheeling Rouse a few eyes to look aloft  Boldly poised in a shelf of the stone Tiny walls look down at us Towers with little square windows  When we plod up to them And dismounting fasten our horses Suddenly a blue gray flock of doves Bursts in a flutter of wings from the shadows  Shards of pots and shreds of straw Empty brush roofed rooms in darkness And the sound of water tinkling A clock that ticks the centuries off in silence   RAIN IN THE DESERT  The huge red buttressed mesa over yonder Is merely a far off temple where the sleepy sun is burning Its altar fires of pinyon and toyon for the day  The old priests sleep white shrouded Their pottery whistles lie beside them the prayer sticks closely feathered On every mummied face there glows a smile  The sun is rolling slowly Beneath the sluggish folds of the sky serpents Coiling uncoiling blue black sparked with fires  The old dead priests Feel in the thin dried earth that is heaped about them Above the smell of scorching oozing pinyon The acrid smell of rain  And now the showers Surround the mesa like a troop of silver dancers Shaking their rattles stamping chanting roaring Whirling extinguishing the last red wisp of light  John Gould Fletcher   SONNETS  COLOR  A blue black Nubian plucking oranges At Jaffa by a sea of malachite In red tarboosh green sash and flowing white Burnous among shadowy memories That haunt me yet by these bleak northern seas He lives forever in my eyes delight Bizarre superb in young immortal might A god of old barbaric mysteries  Maybe he lived a life of lies and lust Maybe his bones are now but scattered dust Yet for a moment he was life supreme Exultant and unchallenged and my rhyme Would set him safely out of reach of time In that old heaven where things are what they seem  OBLIVION  Near the great pyramid unshadowed white With apex piercing the white noon day blaze Swathed in white robes beneath the blinding rays Lie sleeping Bedouins drenched in white hot light About them searing to the tingling sight Swims the white dazzle of the desert ways   Where the sense shudders witless and adaze In a white void with neither depth nor height  Within the black core of the pyramid Beneath the weight of sunless centuries Lapt in dead night King Cheops lies asleep Yet in the darkness of his chamber hid He knows no black oblivion more deep Than that blind white oblivion of noon skies  TENANTS  Suddenly out of dark and leafy ways We came upon the little house asleep In cold blind stillness shadowless and deep In the white magic of the full moon blaze Strangers without the gate we stood agaze Fearful to break that quiet and to creep Into the home that had been ours to keep Through a long year of happy nights and days  So unfamiliar in the white moon gleam So old and ghostly like a house of dream It stood that over us there stole the dread That even as we watched it side by side The ghosts of lovers who had lived and died Within its walls were sleeping in our bed   GOLD  All day the mallet thudded far below My garret in an old ramshackle shed Where ceaselessly with stiffly nodding head And rigid motions ever to and fro A figure like a puppet in a show Before the window moved till day was dead Beating out gold to earn his daily bread Beating out thin fine gold leaf blow on blow  And I within my garret all day long Unto that ceaseless thudding tuned my song Beating out golden words in tune and time To that dull thudding rhyme on golden rhyme But in my dreams all night in that dark shed With aching arms I beat fine gold for bread  Wilfrid Wilson Gibson   SPRING SORROW  There comes a time in the early spring of the year Before the buds have broken When sorrow lays its hush upon the world In syllables unspoken  Sorrow deep as the spheres of darkened moons The sorrow that blindly knows The futility of all unfolding and the fading Of every flower that grows  Cool is the earth with the drooping of unspilled rain And the imminence of tears The buds lie under the stifling bark of the twigs Suppressed with haunting fears  The flowers are too deep beneath the fettered earth Too closely bound in coil To raise the petals of their deluding beauty Above the loosened soil  The mighty winds of the winter have gone down No breath of motion stirs There is no flame of impulse anywhere Not even a bird s wing whirs   Spring Sorrow  Weary is earth of the empty tumult of winter Weary of the new weight That presses against her heart for large release Weary of futile freight  These buds will blow away in the autumn twilight Borne on the wind s cold breath These flowers will add the shining of their petals To the mould of death  The vast gray tragedy of life lies bare No spring flowers cover it No network of blossoms hides it from the eyes No light lies over it  A sadness a spring sadness touches the world The sorrow that blindly knows The futility of all unfolding and the fading Of every flower that grows  IN A CORRIDOR OF STATUES  Chicago Art Institute  They crowd about me close and white and still These statutes On their lips is vocal silence They frighten me with the depth of their unspoken wisdom   And the vast presences of spectral thoughts floating In the white un pupiled spaces of their eyes They look down upon me with the penetration of Sphinxes In the deep unsentient regions of their soulless clay They hold all the secrets which my living soul knows not Yet for a moment a sunlit while I rise Above their white everlastingness I am rosy with life dancing in the current of motion Their stillness intensifies my strength my power For a little the great world is mine completely The Faun chained whitely in his marble statue Yearns to leap out into the world with me He would rush singing for joy with me down the street King Arthur strains to march out into the city With his sword and his buckler and his eyes filled with the  Grail But they are fast in their cases of clay and I am free I will walk forth with the borrowed strength of their mas  tery I will walk on and on until my gladness my motion my life Are sealed like theirs in the silent wisdom of clay I will walk forth with the life giving power of their beauty  Julia Cooley   CONCERNING A NOBLEMAN  My friend felt pity On the red battlefield Where death and dying souls mingled  The white face Of a Japanese man on the ground Held his eyes like the resolute moon  The white face The body without arms without legs They moved my friend to speak  You suffer I am sorry for you May I help you  The wilful face Rose from the ground Blooming into a flower of song  No I do not suffer I am Samurai  The flower fell The petals blew away Into the spirit of Japan   CHAOTIC PEACE  I think of nothing My mind leaps from mountain to mountain The drifts upon calm water  I hear nothing Only the waves and the winds Violent and caressing  I feel nothing My blood runs under my skin Like a forest fire underground  Caroline Dudley  TH E RECLUSE  As evening creeps within the sheltered glade Trees turn to emerald water to jade And on a branch a milk white heron sits With drooping wings silent and unafraid Like a great truth within the gathering night Whose faint reflection streaks the depths with light  Maria Elmendorf Lillie   PIERROT SINGS  The earth lies stark in its dreary shroud As dead as the buds that flowered in May The moon is wrapped in a fleeting cloud Oh for the sound of your voice  You had love in your voice So thrillingly true That the pipes of Pan Were an echo of you  My heart grows cold in fright of the blast Like the cry of a loon in a haunted house Is the voice of the wind as it rushes past Oh for the clasp of your hand  You had June in your heart And beauty so rare That the roses of God Bent low in despair  My soul is numbed by the chill of the night A mourner lone on a lonely hill I stand and watch a phantom light Oh for the touch of your lips  John Pierre Roche   TO HIS LADY PHILOSOPHY  I  The beautiful ladies of old time That walked like angels and were as fair Are dead and vanished and no man s rhyme Can paint them truly as once they were Like pale shadows in moonlight Vanished they are upon strange ways Sudden as snow Villon was right The beautiful ladies of old days But you stay always you most dear Though the harlots come and the harlots go Walking in pomp and in great show Still you are with me still are here More faithful far in a thousand ways Than the beautiful ladies of old days  II  One thing I know most certainly You will not pester me nor chide You will not quarrel much nor be Unkind or hasty to deride When I am stupid with my dreams You will not cackle much nor joke When I am dazzled by the gleams   To His Lady Philosophy  Of fen fires in a world of smoke Or somewhat silly and insane About the making of a song Nor mock me that my face is plain Nor chide me that I am not strong Nay kinder than a woman is You will not mock my vagaries  III  When all my heart is laden down With worldly worries worldly fears You will not pucker lip nor frown Nor make me gloomier with tears You will not make my sorrow sad With weeping and with wretchedness When all the goods I ever had Have vanished in the market s press You will not sob nor make a scene When I come sadly home at night T o tell you that my hopes have been Blown and blasted out of sight W e two will light our pipe o clay And laugh and blow the world away  John McClure   TWO POEMS  ON WAKING  Sleep gray brother of death Has touched me And passed on  I arise facing the east Pearl doored sanctuary From which light Hand linked with dew and fire Dances  Hail essence hail Fill the windows of my soul With beauty Pierce and renew my bones Pour knowledge into my heart As wine  Cualann is bright before thee Its rocks melt and swim The secret they have kept From the ancient nights of darkness Flies like a bird    On Waking  What mourns Cualann s secret flying A lost voice In endless fields  What rejoices My voice lifted praising thee  Praise Praise Praise Praise out of trumpets whose brass Is the unyoked strength of bulls Praise upon harps whose strings Are the light movements of birds Praise of leaf praise of blossom Praise of the red fibred clay Praise of grass  Fire woven veil of the temple Praise of the shapes of clouds Praise of the shadows of wells Praise of worms of fetal things And of the things in time s thought Not yet begotten To thee queller of sleep Looser of the snare of death   AT HARVEST  Earth travails Like a woman come to her time  The swaying corn haulms In the heavy places of the field Cry to be gathered Apples redden and drop from their rods Out of their sheath of prickly leaves The marrows creep fat and white The blue pallor of ripeness Comes on the fruit of the vine branch  Fecund and still fecund After aeons of bearing Not old not dry not wearied out But fresh as when the unseen Right Hand First moved on Bri And the candle of day was set And dew fell from the stars feet And cloths of greenness covered thee  Let me kiss thy breasts I am thy son and lover  Womb fellow am I of the sunburnt oat Friendly gossip of the mearings   At Harvest  Womb fellow of the dark and sweet scented apple Womb fellow of the gourd and of the grape Like begotten like born  And yet without a lover s knowledge Of thy secrets I would walk the ridges of the hills Kindless and desolate  What were the storm driven moon to me Seed of another father What the overflowing Of the well of dawn What the hollow Red with rowan fire What the king fern What the belled heath What the drum of grouse s wing Or glint of spar Caught from the pit Of a deserted quarry  Let me kiss thy breasts I am thy son and lover  Joseph Campbell   ALL LIFE IN A LIFE  His father had a large family Of girls and boys and he was born and bred In a barn or kind of cattle shed But he was a hardy youngster and grew to be A boy with eyes that sparkled like a rod Of white hot iron in the blacksmith shop His face was ruddy like a rising moon And his hair was black as sheep s wool that is black And he had rugged arms and legs and a strong back And he had a voice half flute and half bassoon And from his toes up to his head s top He was a man simple but intricate And most men differ who try to delineate His life and fate  He never seemed ashamed Of poverty or of his origin He was a wayward child Nevertheless though wise and mild And thoughtful but when angered then he flamed As fire does in a forge When he was ten years old he ran away To be alone and watch the sea and the stars At midnight from a mountain gorge When he returned his parents scolded him And threatened him with bolts and bars Then they grew soft for his return and gay   All Life in a Life  And with their love would have enfolded him But even at ten years old he had a way Of gazing at you with a look austere Which gave his kin folk fear  He had no child like love for father or mother  Sister or brother They were the same to him as any other  He was a little cold a little queer  His father was a laborer and now They made the boy work for his daily bread They say he read A book or two during these years of work But if there was a secret Between the pages under the light of his brow It came forth And if he had a woman In love or out of love or a companion or a chum History is dumb So far as we know he dreamed and worked with hands And learned to know his genius s commands Or what is called one s daemon  And this became at last the city s call He had now reached the age of thirty years And found a Dream of Life and a solution For slavery of soul and even all Miseries that flow from things material T o free the world was his soul s resolution   But his family had great fears For him knowing the evil Which might befall him seeing that the light Of his own dream had blinded his mind s eyes They could not tell but what he had a devil But still in their tears despite And warnings he departed with replies That when a man s genius calls him He must obey no matter what befalls him  What he had in his mind was growth Of soul by watching And the creation of eyes Over your mind s eyes to supervise A clear activity and to ward off sloth What he had in his mind was scotching And killing the snake of Hatred and stripping the glove From the hand of Hypocrisy and quenching the fire Of Falsehood and Unbrotherly Desire What he had in his mind was simply Love And it was strange he preached the sword and force To establish Love but it was not strange Since he did this his life took on a change And what he taught seems muddled at its source With moralizing and with moral strife For morals are merely the Truth diluted And sweetened up and suited T o the business and bread of Life   All Life in a Life  And now this City was just what you d find A city anywhere A turmoil and a Vanity Fair A sort of heaven and a sort of Tophet There were so many leaders of his kind The city didn t care For one additional prophet He said some extravagant things And planted a few stings Under the rich man s hide And one of the sensational newspapers Gave him a line or two for cutting capers In front of the Palace of Justice and the Church But all the first grade people took the other side Of the street when they saw him coming With a rag tag crowd singing and humming And curious boys and men up in a perch Of a tree or window taking the spectacle in And the Corybantic din Of a Salvation Army as it were  And whatever he dreamed when he lived in a little town The intelligent people ignored him and this is the stir And the only stir he made in the city  But there was a certain sinister Fellow who came to him hearing of his renown And said You can be mayor of this city W e need a man like you for mayor And others said You d make a lawyer or a politician   Look how the people follow you Why don t you hire out as a special writer You could become a business man a rhetorician You could become a player You can grow rich There s nothing for a fighter Fighting as you are but to end in ruin But he turned from them on his way pursuing The dream he had in view  He had a rich man or two Who took up with him against the powerful frown That looked him down For you ll always find a rich man or two To take up with anything There are those who want to get into society or bring Their riches to a social recognition Or ill formed souls who lack the real patrician Spirit for life But as for him he didn t care he passed Where the richness of living was rife And like wise Goethe talking to the last With cab men rather than with lords He sat about the markets and the fountains He walked about the country and the mountains Took trips upon the lakes and waded fords Barefooted laughing as a young animal Disports itself amid the festival Of warm winds sunshine summer s carnival   All Life in a Life  With laborers carpenters seamen And some loose women And certain notable sinners Gave him dinners And he went to weddings and to places where youth  slakes Its thirst for happiness and they served him cakes And wine wherever he went And he ate and drank and spent His time in feasting and in telling stories And singing poems of lilies and of trees With crowds of people crowded around his knees That searched with lightning secrets hidden Of life and of life s glories Of death and of the soul s way after death  Time makes amends usually for scandal s breath Which touched him to his earthly ruination But this city had a Civic Federation And a certain social order which intrigues Through churches courts with an endless ramification Of money and morals to save itself And this city had a Bar Association Also its Public Efficiency Leagues For laying honest men upon the shelf While making private pelf Secure and free to increase And this city had illustrious Pharisees   And this city had a legion Of men who make a business of religion With eyes one inch apart Dark and narrow of heart Who give themselves and give the city no peace And who are everywhere the best police For Life as business And when they saw this youth Was telling the truth And that his followers were multiplying And were going about rejoicing and defying The social order and were stirring up The dregs of discontent in the cup With the hand of their own happiness They saw dynamic mysteries In the poems of lilies and trees Therefore they held him for a felony  If you will take a kernel of wheat And first make free The outer flake and then pare off the meat Of edible starch you ll find at the kernel s core The life germ And this young man s words were dim With blasphemy sedition at the rim Which fired the heads of dreamers like new wine But this was just the outward force of him For this young man s philosophy was more Than such external ferment being divine   All Life in a Life  With secrets so profound no plummet line Can altogether sound it It means growth Of soul by watching And the creation of eyes Over your mind s eyes to supervise A clear activity and to ward off sloth What he had in mind was scotching And killing the snake of Hatred and stripping the glove From the hand of Hypocrisy and quenching the fire Of falsehood and unbrotherly Desire What he had in mind was simply Love  But he was prosecuted As a rebel and as a rebel executed Right in a public place where all could see And his mother watched him hang for the felony He hated to die being but thirty three And fearing that his poems might be lost And certain members of the Bar Association And of the Civic Federation And of the League of Public Efficiency And a legion  Of men devoted to religion With policemen soldiers roughs Loose women thieves and toughs Came out to see him die And hooted at him giving up the ghost In great despair and with a fearful cry   And after him there was a man named Paul Who almost spoiled it all  And protozoan things like hypocrites And parasitic things who make a food Of the mysteries of God for earthly power Must wonder how before this young man s hour They lived without his blood Shed on that day and which In red cells is so rich  Edgar Lee Masters  EDITORIAL COMMENT  MR MASEFIELD S LECTURE  MR JOHN MASEFIELD S lecture on English Poetry was to me both stimulating and suggestive The phases of English poetry he touched upon revealed the personal quality of the poet himself that union of strength and  gentleness of harshness and beauty which he identified with the English climate and temperament  In speaking of the beginnings of English poetry Mr Masefield said that it was made by a rude war faring people for the entertainment of men at arms or for men at the monks tables that at the time of the new learning the poet s audience became divided into two classes the lettered and the unlettered and that in some sort the two classes had persisted until today As he read from the poetry of Robert of Gloucester from Chaucer from John Davies from Gray and as he spoke of Wordsworth and Blake as modern poets who had striven to speak directly to the soul of man I began to feel how conscientiously Mr Masefield had himself striven to bridge the gulf that has separated poetry from the people His choice was significant of his personal vision he did not mention Burns who was surely a popular poet he mentioned Tennyson as appealing to that middle class which has perhaps lost feeling through education and he spoke of Browning and Swinburne as men who rebelled against the complacent acceptance of this class but who drew   a large share of their inspiration not from life but from  books or from a passionate brooding upon the life of the past  The subject of the poet and his audience has been worn almost threadbare in these pages but it is a subject which because of the gulf between them will be eternally discussed And the gulf is bridged in some sense whenever a poet wins his own particular audience however small the little clan may be But in a larger sense and in the sense of Mr Masefield s remarks it seems to me that the poet will have his audience when he comes to his audience Perhaps it was the attitude of the poet that changed with the new learning The early poet won his audience if need be with a sword or like Hanrahan with his back to the wall He did not shun life or any phase of life and he did not build encrusted sentences in an archaic language which only a lettered man could understand  As I listened to Mr Masefield speaking before the Literary department of the Chicago Woman s Club I could not help wishing that he were speaking to men to the members of the Commercial Club or the City Club I fear that I shall be accused of not being a good feminist but I simply mean that poetry is a man s art as well as a woman s art and that the poet ought to speak directly to men now as he did at the monks tables or in the lull between battles on the trodden field And he ought to speak directly to men of action as well as men of meditative thought to men to whom poetry is of life and action and not of books   Mr Masefield s Lecture  Some of us have had misgivings lately because poetry has seemed to be passing into a new and unfamiliar realm a realm where the old standards of beauty are apparently neglected and the old gradations lost But perhaps poetry is simply regaining its lost kingdom In its new simplicity of diction its use of the speech of today and in its direct approach to life poetry is once more addressed to a living audience It is only recently that I have pierced the archaic literary disguise of Dan Chaucer which he wore for me at school and discovered how common and colloquial he was how he described what people wore a wrist watch it might have been or how they ate and what actual contact they had with actual life And ever since then I have been thinking what a good time he and Edgar Lee Masters would have on a pilgrimage through the United States  In becoming readable and in dealing with life poetry has again addressed itself to its audience in the wider sense And if the poet comes to his audience the audience will come to the poet This is not of course meant in any popular sense There will always be the refined beauty the spiritual gauge above the common level Mr Masefield has attained it not in The Widow in Bye Street Daffodil Fields The Everlasting Mercy so much as in The Wanderer in Biography and in those shorter poems in which an ascetic spirit tasting the beauty of life with a stoic thrill sings of the pride of defeat and death A C H  Written before Mr John Cowper Powys traced the same kin  ship A coincidence not a plagiarism   LITERARY PRIZES  America the most opulent of nations the most interested in the arts the most anxious to excel the most liberal the most gracious  This reflection is given off from my mind by two announcements which reach me this morning  One of the DeGoncourt prizes has been awarded to M Rene Benjamin and the Prix Lasserre has been given to Charles le Goffic  I need scarcely remind the reader that for some centuries Paris and London have been the centers of the world s literature I believe I have pointed out as contributory causes to this effect the treatment accorded to writers in both cities In England almost any writer of unusual talent who has not systematized and commercialized his production can get support from the state first by pension for life second by temporary relief from a royal fund for that purpose The pensions are announced publicly The special donations from the royal fund are never published they are known only to the recipient to such people as he chooses to tell and to the two literati of good standing who vouch for his desserts Not only many of the best writers but many of the writers who later in life have made very great commercial successes have enjoyed this bounty in bad seasons and times of stress late and early  For this reason it is more likely that a man will turn his thought toward permanent writing in England than in   Literary Prizes  America Permanent writing does not bring an immediate cash reward at least it is not likely to In America the whole strain is on the aspirant In England the strain is shared to a certain degree by institutions  London and Paris have other advantages advantages which America can not compete with until her civilization has been enriched by the presence of generations of excellent writers but in this matter of cash there is no excuse for our country lagging behind  France is so poor that I have heard French officials complaining that they can t get funds to catalogue their national library efficiently The Prix Lasserre is eight thousand francs sixteen hundred dollars  The other bit of news to which I referred is in The Times the report of a sale of manuscripts etc in New York It seems that Mr John Lewis has purchased an extra illustrated copy of the Pickering edition of the Compleat Angler 1836 for the sum of 1 650 It is obvious that Mr Lewis is not competing with DeGoncourt and Lasserre and that America has as yet no serious intention of competing with London and Paris E P  WHEREFORE THE POET  From Democracy unpublished  Wherefore the poet What good does he do Is he not a trifler and something of a nuisance   Well are not you and I triflers and more or less nuisances What have we to show to prove the contrary Oh we are practical sensible men You are quite sure of this You will stand on your record Well then if that is so what is the poet if not a trifler  and a nuisance He is the man of VISION He sees He sees Life with eyes of Life And that is something you never have done O practical  man Oh You thought the poet made verses Oh You can t  see what is at your elbow But the poet can True some great poets have made verses It just hap  pened that way That was all They happened to make verses instead of doing something else just as you happen to be sensible and practical instead of being efficient  This is new is it There is a great deal new for you O man on the street So the poet is the man who makes words rhyme No the poet is the man who sees things rhyme For  rhyme is but the suggestion of harmony and harmony is but the suggestion of rhythm and rhythm is but the suggestion of the superb moving equilibrium of all things  You do not see yourself move O man on the street Tell me what do you see moving Do you see anything moving   Wherefore the Poet  Do you see anything at all Have you any vision Do you see Life with eyes of Life Social reality is unknown to you You have not caught a glimpse of it O practical sensible one  And what is poetry The very soul of adventure the going forth the daring to do the vision of doing and the how to do the vision which creates a situation Hence is the poet ever the pioneer  The spirit of poetry is the very spirit of mastery Hence the poets of the past have been the masters of the multitudes of the past And such is the case today Why not  Why should not those who see drive those who do not see when seeing is so easy Awake O multitudes for poetry is the highest of practical powers It is not what you have supposed Awake Louis H Sullivan  REVIEWS  TH E POETRY OF GEORGE STERLING  Beyond the Breakers and Other Poems by George Sterling  A M Robertson San Francisco  The Pacific states are loyal to their own artists to a degree which other sections of this vast nation might well emulate Because in spite of the manifest danger of provincialism art like charity should begin at home indeed   must begin at home if it is not to be a wanderer on the face of the earth seeking forlornly an alien audience  So it was a satisfaction to discover everywhere along The Coast a devotion to Mr George Sterling which was not alone enthusiasm for his poetry but also pride in him as a personality and a possession As California loves Keith and certain later painters because they were and are faithful interpreters of her beauty so she rewards this poet for his love of her  One can forgive her if she seems to overrate him I own to my surprise on hearing one enthusiast call him the greatest poet since Dante and on finding him the only living poet whose words were inscribed along with Confucius and Firdausi with Shakespeare and Goethe on the triumphal arches of the Panama Pacific Exposition I rubbed my eyes had I been blind and deaf In 1909 and 1911 I had read A Wine of Wizardry and The House of Orchids without discovering a poet of the first order Manifestly I must re read these books and add the poet s first volume The Testimony of the Suns and his latest Beyond the Breakers All of which I have done  Now if I can not quite rise to the Californian estimate at least I find in Mr Sterling a gift a poetic impulse which might have carried him much further than it has as yet His first long poem The Testimony of the Suns does indeed make one feel the sidereal march make one shiver before the immensity and shining glory of the universe this in spite of shameless rhetoric which often threatens to engulf the   The Poetry of George Sterling  theme beyond redemption and in spite of the whole second part an unhappy afterthought Already the young poet s brilliant but too facile craftsmanship was tempted by the worst excesses of the Tennysonian tradition he never thinks he deems he does not ask but crave he is fain for this and that he deals in emperies and auguries and antiphons in causal throes and lethal voids in many other things of tinsel and fustian the frippery of a by gone fashion H e can smother his idea in such pompous phrasing as this  Shall yet your feet essay unharmed The glare of cosmic leaguers met Round stellar strongholds gulfward set  With night and fire supremely armed And yet this is the poet and this the poem capable at  times of lyric rapture  O Deep whose very silence stuns Where Light is powerless to illume Lost in immensities of gloom That dwarf to motes the flaring suns gt  O Night where Time and Sorrow cease Eternal magnitude of dark Wherein Aldebaran drifts a spark  And Sirius is hushed to peace  O Tides that foam on strands untrod From seas in everlasting prime To light where Life looks forth on Time  And Pain unanswered questions God  What Power with inclusive sweep And rigor of compelling bars Shall curb the furies of the stars And still the troubling of that Deep   Shall Godhead dream a transient thing Strives He for that which now He lacks Shall Law s dominion melt as wax At touch of Hope s irradiant wing  Are these the towers His hands have wrought Dreams He the dream of end and plan Dear to the unity of man  And shall mutation rule His thought  If I dwell upon this early poem it is because the best and worst qualities of the poet are in it His later work never gives us such a hint of grandeur or falls into deeper abysses of rhetoric A Wine of Wizardry leaves me cold I don t care whether  So Fancy s carvel seeks an isle afar Led by the Scorpion s rubescent star  or whether  She wanders to an iceberg oriflammed With rayed auroral guidons of the North  In fact I cannot follow the poor lady s meanderings through a maze of words And although the next book The House of Orchids contains a good poem in simpler diction The Faun and two or three fine sonnets especially Aldebaran at Dusk it does not fulfil the promise of the first volume Nor does the latest book  Beyond the Breakers begins thus  The world was full of the sound of a great wind out of the West And the tracks of its feet were white on the trampled ocean s breast And I said With the sea and wind I will mix my body and soul   The Poetry of George Sterling  Where the breath of the planet drives and the herded billows roll And so the poet went swimming The great embrace of ocean was closer than love s can be Its clasp was sharp on my limbs yet went I supple and free The breast of the deep upheaved as a mother s under a child Terrible tender strong imperial undefined Why doesn t this get across why is it just a little absurd For surely there is a poem in a swim for a poet who doesn t try to be sublime The truth is this sort of pomposity has died the death If the imagists have done nothing else they have punctured the gas bag English poetry will be henceforth more compact and stern as simple as prose perhaps Against the Victorian excesses we might quote the rhetorical advice of Tennyson s Ancient Sage in favor of another kind of temperance  Nor care To vex the noon with fiery gems or fold Thy presence in the silk of sumptuous looms Nor roll thy viands on a luscious tongue Nor drown thyself like flies in honeyed wine  When Mr Sterling learns to avoid the luscious tongue and the honeyed wine he may become the poet he was meant to be  Indeed there are a number of poems in the book which give us hope The compactness of the sonnet form is evidently good discipline for this poet s muse for I find six beautiful sonnets It is perhaps distinction enough to have   written Respite Kindred To One Self slain At the Grand Canon The Night on the Mountain The Muse of the Incommunicable and this the first of the Omnia Exeunt in Mysterium series  The stranger in my gates lo that am I And what my land of birth I do not know Nor yet the hidden land to which I go  One may be lord of many ere he die And tell of many sorrows in one sigh But know himself he shall not nor his woe Nor to what sea the tears of wisdom flow Nor why one star is taken from the sky  An urging is upon him evermore And though he bide his soul is wanderer Scanning the shadows with a sense of haste  Where fade the tracks of all who went before A dim and solitary traveler On ways that end in evening and the waste  It goes without saying that there are lovely lines couplets or quatrains on almost every page But besides the above sonnets the poems which seem to me most simple sincere and beautiful are A Possibility In Babylon Winter Sunset and this The Last Days  The russet leaves of the sycamore Lie at last on the valley floor By the autumn wind swept to and fro Like ghosts in a tale of long ago Shallow and clear the Carmel glides Where the willows droop on its vine walled sides  The bracken rust is red on the hill The pines stand brooding somber and still Gray are the cliffs and the waters gray Where the seagulls dip to the sea born spray   The Poetry of George Sterling  Sad November lady of rain Sends the goose wedge over again  Wilder now for the verdure s birth Falls the sunlight over the earth Kildees call from the fields where now The banding blackbirds follow the plow Rustling poplar and brittle weed Whisper low to the river reed  Days departing linger and sigh Stars come soon to the quiet sky Buried voices intimate strange Cry to body and soul of change Beauty eternal fugitive Seeks the home that we cannot give  H M  A POET OF THE NINETIES  Poetical Works of Lionel Johnson The Macmillan Co Poetical Works of Lionel Johnson with a Preface by Ezra  Pound Elkin Mathews London  For some undivulged reason the American edition of this book is published without the preface written by the editor of the volume Ezra Pound  The following passages taken from this introduction furnish an excellent criticism of the poems of Lionel Johnson and we quote them here in place of a review  A traditionalist of traditionalists his poems are criticism for the most part One might almost say they are literary criticism in verse for that is the impression which they   leave if one have laid them by for long enough to have an impression of the book as a whole and not a confusion not the many little contradictory impressions of individual poems His friends with the sole exception of Mr Yeats seem to regard him as a prose writer who inadvertently strayed into verse His language is formal It has an old fashioned kind of precision that is very difficult from the sort of precision now sought yet in the dozen places where this stately and meticulous speech is moved by unwonted passion Lionel Johnson has left poems as beautiful as any in English as in the poem  Fair face gone from sight  Fair lips hushed in death Now their glad breath Breathes not upon our air Music that saith Love only and things fair  Or in the poem to O Leary  From Howth to Achil the glad noise Rings and the heirs of glory fall  Or in the poem to Oliver Georges Destrée  In Merioneth over the sad moor Drives the rain the cold wind blows Past the ruinous church door The poor procession without music goes  The curlew cries Over her laid down beside Death s lonely people  Johnson s verse is full of inversions Having held out for a uniform standard of appreciation having insisted that one   A Poet of the Nineties  should weigh Theocritus and one s neighbor in one balance I cannot for the sake even of courtesy cast that standard aside I do not however contradict it when I say that the  natural speech of one decade is not the natural speech of another In 1590 it was the fashion of the court to parley Euphues Shakespeare s characters use a florid speech to show their good breeding and Multitudinous seas incarnadine probably got as much applause quia magniloquent as a witticism of Wilde s quia witty In 1600 people were interested in painted speech It was vital It was part of the time For a later age it is rank affectation Some say the nineties spoke as they wrote I have heard it said that A generation of men came down from Oxford resolved to talk as prose had been written They had presumably the conviction that the speech of life and of poetry should be the same They were quixotic They loved the speech of books and proposed to make daily speech copy it  Men of the renaissance had done something like this They wrote excellent Latin but daily speech did not follow it Lorenzo Valla wrote invectively as Johnson might have written elegiacly linguam latinara magnum sacramentum est And indeed Johnson wrote Latin as beautifully as Flaminius so far did his reverence lead him He would have been content always writing Latin I think but failing that he set himself the task of bringing into English all that he could of the fineness of Latinity He wrote an English that had grown out of Latin He at his worst approached the Miltonian quagmire the old error of supposing that   an uninflected language can be written according to rules of order fit for an inflected speech and for that only  Yet because he is never florid one remembers his work or one thinks of his work in one s memory as if it were speech in unruffled order One does this in spite of his inversion in spite of the few treasured archaisms in spite of his spelling it chaunted  One thinks that he had read and admired Gautier or that at least he had derived similar ambitions from some traditional source One thinks that his poems are in short hard sentences The reality is that they are full of definite statement For better or worse they are doctrinal and nearly always dogmatic He had the blessed habit of knowing his own mind and this was rare among writers of his decade In fact the nineties have chiefly gone out because of their muzziness because of a softness derived I think not from books but from impressionist painting They riot with half decayed fruit  The impression of Lionel Johnson s verse is that of small slabs of ivory firmly combined and contrived There is a constant feeling of neatness a sense of inherited order Above all he respected his art  From the Elizabethans to Swinburne through all that vast hiatus English poetry had been the bear garden of doctrinaires It had been the vehicle of opinion For Swinburne it was at least the art of musical wording For Johnson it was the art of good writing The last is a rare thing in England   A Poet of the Nineties  In the midst of enthusiasms one thinks perhaps that if Gautier had not written Johnson s work might even take its place in Weltliteratur that it might stand for clearness and neatness In English literature it has some such place with the writings of Arnold and of Christina Rossetti His attitude toward the past was pragmatical He seemed to regard what had been as good or as at least bearable His taste was catholic There is no use regretting this fault he had its virtues The Post Liminium is a complete world of culture his own wrought out of worthy things His mind was openly receptive This gentleness sets him apart from our decade But if he was traditionalist he was so in the finest sense of that term He really knew the tradition the narrow tradition that is of English Latin and Greek This intelligent acquaintance with the past differentiates him from the traditionalists of his time and of ours  He would for instance have welcomed good vers libre he would have known how the Greeks had used it You could have discussed with him any and every serious problem of technique and this is certainly a distinction among the poets of England He might have differed from your views of good writing but he would have believed in good writing His hatred of slovenliness would have equalled your own NEW ANTHOLOGIES  The Quiet Hour selected and arranged by Fitz Roy Carrington Houghton Mifflin Co The Little Book of American Poets edited by Jessie B Rittenhouse Houghton Mifflin Co  Anthology of Magazine Verse for 1915 by William Stan  ley Braithwaite Gomme amp Marshall New York  Mr Carrington brings to his task as anthologist the same  rare sense of selection and discrimination that distinguish him as a collector and connoisseur of fine prints This in a time when taste as an artistic canon is more or less in abeyance is worth recording  In The Quiet Hour Mr Carrington has selected from old and modern poets poems largely of a reflective mood and suitable for reading by both young and grown up people at the twilight hour The poems are arranged under the separate headings Cradle Songs Infancy Childhood Night Sleep Charms and Dirges and the book is illustrated by reproductions of rare prints and engravings of the authors included Those who have enjoyed as I have long enjoyed Mr Carrington s other anthologies The King s Garland The Queen s Garland The Shepherd s Pipe and The Pilgrim s Staff will welcome this new volume  The new anthology edited by Miss Rittenhouse is a companion volume to her Little Book of Modern Verse issued last year The arrangement is chronological beginning with Philip Freneau and ending with Paul Lawrence Dunbar who died recently The modern selection of course was more   New Anthologies  fully covered by the preceding volume Anyone who sets out to make an anthology is sure to face a certain amount of objection the choice is always personal not only on the side of the editor but of the reader as well who would like to include poems not included or leave out poems included but the first requisite of retrospective anthology is that it should be fairly representative and as this book seems to fulfil this condition there is little room for carping If I miss one or two favorites I am also reminded of several poems which I had forgotten Of course there is much that one would like to leave out But an anthology is a good deal like a museum whose directors are often more afraid of a blank wall than of poor painting As historical links certain poets no doubt deserve to be remembered Nevertheless I should like to see a director or an anthologist courageous enough to make a collection on a purely aesthetic basis  The general plan of Mr Braithwaite s anthology improves from year to year This year it is more inclusive in scope than formerly having covered a larger number of magazines and the result is a certain improvement in the quality of the poems published The arrangement of the book would be much better if it presented the poets in alphabetical order rather than according to a fancied grouping by subject  The editor gives what he believes to be the best poems of the year 1915 and out of the eighty eight poems republished I find twelve that reach a high water mark as many more that give me pleasure and about the same number of   serious omissions As I said last year Mr Braithwaite s yearly summary of poetry is an important feature of the Boston Transcript which should be adopted by one paper at least in every city Perhaps instead of a yearly summary a column or two each month reprinting the best poems of that month would be better Newspapers please

Harold Monro James Stephens and Lascelles Abercrombie  A C H  Les Poètes de la Guerre Librairie Militaire Berger Levrault Paris In Les Poètes de la Guerre forty odd men and one  woman some of whom are youthful soldiers as well as poets and others are poets too old for military service are represented each by one two or three war poems These poems may have appeared already in French magazines but not before August 1914 Theodore Botrel laureate of the   Reviews  bivouac Edmond Rostand of elegant idiom à double entente Paul Fort the optimistic Prince of Poets and the Comtesse de Noailles each of divergent mental habits from his brother poets are for once bound together in the accustomed yellow covers of French literature Schools are forgotten nationalism has for the moment succeeded symbolism and the patriot supplanted the paroxyste  Although Les Poètes de la Guerre is not of uniform literary excellence it waves its prosodie flag with such ardor for France that it is a vivid illustration of an English poet s definition of poetry as the blossom of human passions emotions language The book is important not as an anthology of great poetry but as an anthology of great emotions  K M B  CORRESPONDENCE  I  Extract from a letter  Poetry must be as well written as prose Its language must be a fine language departing in no way from speech save by a heightened intensity i e simplicity There must be no book words no periphrases no inversions It must be as simple as De Maupassant s best prose and as hard as Stendhal s  There must be no interjections No words flying off to nothing Granted one can t get perfection every shot this must be one s INTENTION   Rhythm MUST have a meaning It can t be merely a careless dash off with no grip and no real hold to the words and sense a tumty tum tumty tum tum ta  There must be no clichés set phrases stereotyped journalese The only escape from such is by precision a result of concentrated attention to what one is writing The test of a writer is his ability for such concentration AN D for his power to stay concentrated till he gets to the end of his poem whether it is two lines or two hundred  Objectivity and again objectivity and expression no hind side beforeness no straddled adjectives as addled mosses dank no Tennysonianness of speech nothing nothing that you couldn t in some circumstance in the stress of some emotion actually say Every literaryism every book word fritters away a scrap of the reader s patience a scrap of his sense of your sincerity When one really feels and thinks one stammers with simple speech it is only in the flurry the shallow frothy excitement of writing or the inebriety of a metre that one falls into the easy easy oh how easy speech of books and poems that one has read  Language is made out of concrete things General expressions in non concrete terms are a laziness they are talk not art not creation They are the reaction of things on the writer not a creative act by the writer  Epithets are usually abstractions I mean what they call epithets in the books about poetry The only adjective that is worth using is the adjective that is essential to the sense of the passage not the decorative frill adjective   Correspondence  I wish I could see a bit more Sophoclean severity in the ambitions of mes amis et confrères The general weakness of the new school is looseness lack of rhythmical construction and intensity Ezra Pound  II Dear Editor In the July number of POETRY Mr F S Flint made a statement that shows insufficient understanding of the nature of the poet and dramatist reviewed The statement is For the form of Claudel s verse he is apparently indebted to Whitman In each young writer who expresses himself in free verse it seems the fashion to hold Walt Whitman responsible for the irregularity of form a fashion that however correct collectively for the crowd is never original may be entirely at fault when applied to an individual While Whitman s influence is marked in certain poets there is equal evidence in others that both expression and measure have been derived with Whitman himself from the poetic arrangement in use centuries ago The prosody of Paul Claudel if it must be classified to satisfy our tiresome demand for orderliness in creative procedure might well have been inspired by the literature of the Chaldeans which dates back to the third century before Christ or by that of the early Jewish psalmists and be as far removed from the overcrowded pigeon hole of Whitman tenets as it is possible for like minds and similar impressionists to separate themselves Individualities may converge in utterance and at the   same time be self visioned Paul Claudel is epochless and he is not for the multitude In these two attributes he is again like Whitman But again not a disciple  Kate Meldram Buss  III  Dear Editor It is said that at the last meeting of The Twentieth Century Club in Chicago Mr John Masefield told his audience the stories of Hamlet King Lear Macbeth and other plays by Mr Shakespeare Presumably Mr Masefield fancied quite rightly that his audience did not frequent the cinemas  English authors who write about us or lecture in this country relate delightful stories of our intellectual naivete and offer the same haphazard generalizations about us which were formed at home and which remain unmodified by experiences in lecture halls Pullman sleepers and hotel corridors  Mr James Stephens and Mr Edward Garnett who have not so far as I know visited the country measure the shibboleths of our criticism by some standard of the year of the Centennial They take the police censorship of journalism to be a real indication of the critical temper of the people  Conditions here change more rapidly than the English  critics realize Mr Stanton Coit s apologetic attitude toward  certain phases of the genius of Walt Whitman and Swinburne  is accepted perhaps too tolerantly by an amused American  audience S D   Notes  NOTES  Of the poets represented in this number four are familiar to our readers  Mr John Gould Fletcher now living in Boston will soon print his latest poems in the
