through Heaven s blue hour glass  By the capital where poetry began Near the only printing presses known to man Young Confucius walks the shore On a sorrowful day The town all books is tumbling down Through the blue bay From rusty musty walls the bookworms come They drown themselves like rabbits in the sea Venomous scholars harry mandarins With pitchfork blunderbuss and snickersnee   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In the book slums there is thunder Gunpowder that sad wonder Intoxicates the knights and beggar men The old grotesques of war begin again Devils furies fairies are set free  Confucius hears a carol and a hum A picture sea child whirs from off his fan In one quick breath of peach bloom fantasy And in an instant bows the reverent knee A full grown sweetheart chanting his renown And then she darts into the Yellow Sea Calling calling Sage with holy brow Say farewell to China now Live like the swine Leave off your scholar gown This city of books is falling falling The Empire of China is crumbling down  II  Confucius Confucius how great was Confucius The sunrise of Lu and the master of Mencius  Alexander fights the East Just as the Indus turns him back He hears of swarming lands beyond And sword swept cities on the rack   Vachel Lindsay  With crowns outshining India s crown The Empire of China crumbling down Later the Roman sibyls say Egypt Persia and Macedon Tyre and Carthage passed away And the Empire of China is crumbling down Rome will never crumble down  m  See how the generations pass Like sand through Heaven s blue hour glass  Arthur waits on the British shore One thankful day For Galahad sails back at last To Camelot Bay The pure knight lands and tells the tale Far in the east A sea girl led us to a king The king to a feast In a land where poppies bloom for miles Where books are made like bricks and tiles I taught that king to love your name Brother and Christian he became  His Town of Thunder Powder keeps A giant hound that never sleeps A crocodile that sits and weeps   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  His Town of Cheese the mouse affrights With fire winged cats that light the nights They glorify the land of rust Their sneeze is music in the dust  All towns have one same miracle With the Town of Silk the capital Vast book worms in the book built walls Their creeping shakes the silver halls They look like cables and they seem Like writhing roots on trees of dream Their sticky cobwebs cross the street Catching scholars by the feet Who own the tribes yet rule them not Bitten by book worms till they rot Beggars and clowns rebel in might Bitten by book worms till they fight  Arthur calls his knights in rows  I will go if Merlin goes These rebels must be flayed and sliced  Let us cut their throats for Christ  But Merlin whispers in his beard  China has witchcraft to be feared  Arthur stares at the sea foam s rim Amazed The fan girl beckons him  Her witch ways all his senses drown   Vachel Lindsay  She laughs in her wing like the sleeve of a gown She lifts a key of crimson stone The Great Gunpowder town you own She lifts a key with chains and rings I give the town where cats have wings She lifts a key as white as milk This unlocks the Town of Silk Throws forty keys at Arthur s feet These unlock the land complete  Then frightened by suspicious knights And Merlin s eyes like altar lights And the Christian towers of Arthur s town She spreads blue fins she whirs away Fleeing far across the bay Wailing through the gorgeous day My sick king begs you save his crown And his learned chiefs from the worm and clown The Empire of China is crumbling down  IV  Always the generations pass Like sand through Heaven s blue hour glass  The time the King of Rome is born Napoleon s son that eaglet thing Bonaparte finds beside his throne One evening laughing in her wing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A Chinese sea child and she cries Breaking his heart with emerald eyes And fairy bred unearthly grace Master take your destined place Across white foam and water blue The streets of China call to you The Empire of China is crumbling down Then he bends to kiss her mouth And gets but incense dust and drouth  In Tokio they cry O King China s way is a shameful thing In hard Berlin they cry O King China s way is a shameful thing And thus our song might call the roll Of every land from pole to pole And every rumor known to time Of China doddering or sublime  V  Slowly the generations pass Like sand through Heaven s blue hour glass  But let us find tomorrow now Our towns are gone Our books have passed ten thousand years Have thundered on The Sphinx looks far across the world   Vachel Lindsay  In fury black She sees all western nations spent Or on the rack Eastward she sees one land she knew When from the stone Priests of the sunrise carved her out And left her lone She sees the shore Confucius walked On his sorrowful day Learned paupers riot yet In the ancient way Officials futile as of old Have gowns more bright Bookworms are fiercer than of old Their skins more white Dust is deeper than of old More bats are flying More songs are written than of old More songs are dying  Where Galahad found forty towns Now fade and glare Ten thousand towns with book tiled roof And garden stair Where beggars babies come like showers Of classic words They rule the world immortal brooks And magic birds   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The lion Sphinx roars at the sun I hate this nursing you have done The meek inherit the earth too long When will the world belong to the strong She soars she claws his patient face The girl moon screams at the disgrace The sun s blood fills the western sky He hurries not and will not die  The baffled Sphinx on granite wings Turns now to where young China sings One thousand of ten thousand towns Go down before her silent wrath Yet even lion gods may faint And die upon their brilliant path She sees the Chinese children romp In dust that she must breathe and eat Her tongue is reddened by its lye She craves its grit its cold and heat The Dust of Ages holds a glint Of fire from the foundation stones Of spangles from the sun s bright face Of sapphires from earth s marrow bones Mad drunk with it she ends her day Slips when a high sea wall gives way Drowns in the cold Confucian sea Where the whirring fan girl first flew free   Vachel Lindsay  In the light of the maxims of Chesterfield Mencius Franklin or Nietzsche how great was Confucius  His fan s gay daughter crowned with sand Between the water and the land Now cries on high in irony With a voice of night wind alchemy O drowned cat O stony face The joke is on Egyptian pride The joke is on the human race The meek inherit the earth too long When will the world belong to the strong I am born from off the holy fan Of the world s most civil gentleman So answer me O deathless sea  And thus will the answering Ocean call China will fall The Empire of China will crumble down When the Alps and the Andes crumble down When the sun and the moon have crumbled down The Empire of China will crumble down Crumble down  Vachel Lindsay   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MOUNTAIN TRAILS  I  Night stands in the valley Her head Is bound with stars While Dawn a grey eyed nun Steals through the silent trees Behind the mountains Morning shouts and sings And dances upward  II  Down the eastern sky A fleet of clouds drift toward the earth Bearing a message of forgotten beauty Only the brooding mountains With robes of purple mist about their shoulders Can gaze into the glory Of the sun  III  The peaks even today show finger prints Where God last touched the earth Before he set it joyously in space Finding it good   IV  You slender shining You downward leaping Born from silent snow To drown at last in the blue silent Mountain lake You are not snow or water You are only a silver spirit Singing  V  Sharp crags of granite Pointing threatening Thrust fiercely at me And near the edge their menace Would whirl me down  VI  Climbing desperately toward the heights I glance in terror behind me To be deafened to be shattered By a thunderbolt of beauty  VII  The mountains hold communion They are priests silent and austere   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  They have come together In a secret place With unbowed heads  VIII  This hidden lake Is a sapphire cup An offering clearer than wine Colder than tears The mountains hold it toward the sky In silence  Marjorie Allen Seiffert  FREEDOM  Give me the long straight road before me A clear cold day with a nipping air Tall bare trees to run on beside me A heart that is light and free from care Then let me go I care not whither My feet may lead for my spirit shall be Free as the brook that flows to the river Free as the river that flows to the sea  Olive Runner   SUNRISE AT SANTA BARBARA  The sea hides its curious heart Under a bridal robe of mother o pearl Mother o pearl flushed with rose Waiting  Against a turquoise sky The mountains kneel mauve gray In the gray pink sand Of the curving shore Waiting  The moon pale and wan  Hangs a flat design in silver On the expectant sky Waiting  The palm trees in parallel rows Along the Plaza clasp  Nervous wavering fingers Waiting  Riding on a many fluted shell Held on the backs of jade tritons Comes Venus Anadyomene straight and slim Combing the night curls From her ruddy hair Blown by the four winds To the meeting with her lover   Then he comes the young Sun Glorious in amazing strength and splendor Striding across the mountains To pave a path of brazen metal For the whiteness of her feet The two little feet of his bride He surrounds covers hides her In golden madness  The sea roughens Sending her waves with the morning breeze Against the shore It is day  THE POMEGRANATE BUSH  When she was alive She moved like a frail ghost The spirit of a wraith Her chiffons trailed about her Like spirals of smoke The wail in her voice was gray and pining Like the sea after twilight  She died and was buried Now she has returned a woman Among us   Pauline B Barrington  She passed down the street Wrapped in a Spanish shawl Flaming with hybiscus And amber roses The silk fringe caught in a small green bush She stooped and swayed With long pointed fingers disengaged The silk fringe of the shawl  I closed my eyes So poignant was the grace Of her swaying and stooping When I opened them again She had gone Up and down the street I looked She had disappeared  But the small green bush Where her long pointed fingers Disengaged the silk fringe Of the shawl Was covered with vermilion flowers Like her mouth A flare of color In the sun  Pauline B Barrington   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE SAND DUNES  There I know blue blue water And a waving line of land With pines that grow in a wind swept row As set by a dreamer s hand And where the winds will in hollow or hill Sand and sand and sand  Sand as soft as a snowfall Drifting eddying whirled Sweeping into the valleys Over the grasses swirled And billowing up to the tree tops That look out on the world  Sand of romantic patterns New for each passer fleet Here a flower has lain there the leaf like chain That was marked by a sea gull s feet And the pebbled trace as of scalloped lace Where the waves and the shore line meet  Gleaming sands in the morning When the little waves run white While gay wings fan the shining span And float a song in flight And the lupine blue spreads a heaven new Where the stars might rest till night   Janet Norris Bangs  But gray gray sands at evening When haunting voices blow Over twilight faded water From trees of long ago Hushed by the drifting silence As by eternal snow  O grass flowers trees unfruitful Caught while your sun was high Buried deep in the sand dune s keep Is all of life gone by Can a springing bough lift your glory now And give it back to the sky  Janet Norris Bangs  THE BIRCHES  Around the stretch of hemlock and pine and cedar Sport of the wind which flutters them up and down They stand in line the luminous slender birches A silver fringe for trimming the wood s green gown  Antoinette DeCoursey Patterson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE MOON ROSE  The moon rose She spread a circle of fire on the waters She drew a path of golden fire across the ocean Straight to us sitting idly on the balcony after supper She waited  We looked too long upon the shining path We arose and went down to the sea We dropped our dark earth skins upon the sands And stood up white with edges of fire The moon laid a blazing finger on our bodies And drew us into the dark waters  Each gleaming ripple touched our bodies left its gold on  them And returned black to the black water Until we lay in the circle of fire Until we swayed in the arms of the moon The black waves reached for us She lifted us gently  The waves broke into points of fire against our bodies And fell back She sang to us rocking Sleep sleep But all the fire of the moon path was in our bodies We could not sleep   Marguerite Zorach  We leapt from the arms of the moon We raced through the black waters Scattering showers of sparks Our bodies were transparent with edges of fire The sea was black before us  We had become strangely thin Our dark earth skins fitted us ill And when we looked The moon path lay behind us across the ocean We had dropped it in our haste  Marguerite Zorach  LOOK THE SEA  Look the sea how it lifts me in its arms like a child Oh how I love to ride on the white foam of the waves And dive down into the deep bottom of the sea  Look the sun how it burns me like a leaf Oh how I love to bathe in the hot rays of the sun And burn like a flame in the sands  Look the moon how it rides me in sky Oh how I love to sail on the shining edge of the clouds And sleep in the cool depths of the blue  William Zorach   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE DJINN  The gaunt old man Who teaches Latin and Greek in High School Is not as old as he looks He has a lean ill fed soul And has missed the real nourishment of life Because he has merely nibbled at it Canned Out of books  But the Recording Angel Has inscribed one good deed to his credit When Jane Howe was all on edge to go as a missionary to  India Although her orphaned brothers and sisters needed her at  home He got Jane to read queer books The Mahabarata and the Zend Avesta And they discouraged her And opened her eyes to the impertinence Of going to India as a missionary They impelled her to stay at home Where she helped to bring up the younger children After a while she married a good provider And has a family of young and savage Americans Who need her prayers and labors Much more than the Hindoos   Robert Gilbert Welsh  They say that the teacher of Greek and Latin Was in love with Jane If he was he never breathed it He always hid his desires And crushed them And never had the courage Even to make to himself The apology he thought they merited  Sometimes the gaunt old man Who teaches Latin and Greek in High School Sits in Weinberg s Café On rainy nights And in the hazy half lighted room Through the wavering smoke from many cigars He suddenly looms up large Like a Djinn out of a bottle  READERS  In the reading room of the public library A queer group gathers about the table The tired man at one end Has been called by some persons a tramp He merely pretends to read So that he may stay here Safe in the warmth   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Shut away from the wind and the rain His eyelids are not merely lowered They are actually closed And he is sleeping lightly as a cat  The old woman near the other end Slipped away from her cheerless hall room And came here because she likes the lights And the changing human faces She has her supper hidden in her pocket She slips a bite into her mouth When none is looking And pretends that she is reading the Outlook  The tall thin boy with the exciting mauve shirt Is reading the chapters of a lurid serial Just to fill in the hour Until the burlesquers begin In the theatre on the next block  And in the shelves behind them all The masters of the world In reserve and silence Await the coming of a sympathetic friend  Robert Gilbert Welsh   QUILTS  They gave me the quilt that Great aunt Elizabeth made A quilt of pink roses and tiny careful stitches It goes in my chest for in October I marry  Pink roses with stems of green on a background of white And Great aunt Elizabeth pieced it for her own chest She pieced it with trembling hands for her lover had gone To fight with the South Elizabeth filled in the long days with squares of pink Fitting the pattern together with quick nervous fingers Roses of pink for love and a bride  But here is a spot of red among the pink roses  I wonder what is stitched into the quilting She finished it long afterwards when war Had taken all she had but memories She pieced her life into a pink rose quilt When war was making patch work of her soul  They gave me the quilt that Great aunt Elizabeth made A quilt of pink roses with stems of green for a bride But I see all the time the splotch of blood in the roses  October is so far when war is near  Mary Willis Shuey   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CLAY HILLS  It is easy to mould the yielding clay And many shapes grow into beauty Under the facile hand But forms of clay are lightly broken They will lie shattered and forgotten in a dingy corner  But underneath the slipping clay Is rock I would rather work in stubborn rock All the years of my life And make one strong thing And set it in a high clean place To recall the granite strength of my desire  DISCOVER ME AGAIN  Discover me again Look at me with new eyes O my beloved See my aspect changes to the need of love Even as the stable earth answers the call of the seasons  Do not regard me only as a winter wife A peddler of homely comforts Indeed I am also your girl of spring Dreams possess and inhabit me   Jean Starr Untermeyer  But these lie sick and languid They quicken to the call of life Only at the recognition of your glance At the hail of your love  Discover me again  Jean Starr Untermeyer  THOUGH ONE SHOULD STRIVE  Love is the heart s last light to die Though one should strive in stubborn pain To quench its beauty utterly Yet were his labor vain  Yes often when the night is deep For all the far forgetful years A face looks star like on my sleep And I awake with tears  Nancy Byrd Turner   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  DRIFTWOOD BURNING  You who behold me You the strangers The dwellers in the low lands Here by the river Can you indeed Behold me burning Without wonder without dreaming  The great flames Are taking me They are consuming me Even as you Dwellers in the low lands Are to return unto dust In the end I the driftwood burning Am going my way To the nothingness Of ashes in the wind Yet I go Not slowly not a slow fog Creeping from one valley To another But flamingly Flamingly A light a warmth a signal Leaping out of the darkness   Zoè Akins  Time found me Before I was I Long ago far away In a deep forest And Time took me Rooting me up From the ground that bore me Away from the circling arms Of my brothers and sisters about me Time took me And gave me Frightened and broken To the Great River  My brothers and sisters Of the forest Where Time found me Lamented perhaps That I was broken And sent to drift On the unreturning waves Of the unreturning river They have gone perhaps My brothers and sisters Into the building of ships Or the building of homes But it was my destiny To drift to burn    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Bronze are my flames And opal Like the breasts Of the wild geese In the bronze mirror And green are my flames Like the young willow trees That lean to the river From thousands of islands And from long low shores  I burn With all the beauty That I have known And have dreamed of Under the quivering fountains Of light flowing From the radiant sun Or in the pale Amethystine twilights Of gathering snows   And my flames Ride upward into smoke Exulting That they are akin To the proudest elements That gave the light to the stars  The heat to the sun   Zoë Akins  Akin but more beautiful With secrets and colors That the stars and the sun Have yet to learn And there is a gladness in me That is like the gladness Of dancers and birds For Eternity vexes me not With the glories and duties Perpetual She has given T o the stars and the sun The lightning the wind   It was my destiny To burn To be a light a warmth a signal Here on your shore By the Great River That brought me down And nursed me on her breast And whispered her secrets to me And gave me her colors And flung me to my fate   Can you behold me Burning O strangers Without wonder without dreaming  Zoë Akins  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  THE GREAT RENEWAL  F all the so called civilized peoples at least in the Occident Americans have been credited with the greatest love of wild nature The people of these states instinctively take to the woods for a holiday the woods or the waters or the mountains to a greater degree than any Europeans or it has been averred than any Central or Southern Americans Our ancestors coming here from crowded Europe gradually discovered the wilderness and became infected with its lure The magnificence of Nature in our ever growing West its infinite variety of beauty and grandeur was a perpetual invitation to the pioneer And now that those days have well nigh passed the children of pioneers feel the same call and obey it as they can by camping and mountaineering under primitive conditions and by setting aside vast areas of wild scenery as people s playgrounds for all time to come  Nothing could be wiser it is almost a platitude to repeat that Mother Earth is the great renewer of the race both physically and spiritually But it would be well if we were to search the platitude more deeply and realize that she is also the great renewer of the arts and that it is to her rather than to schools and precedents of the past that our artists our poets should go for their deep draughts of the nectar of the gods Since men began to build houses and gather together in villages and towns they have been too   The Great Renewal  prone to accept roofs and walls as a normal condition of human existence and to confine their interests more and more to the small efforts and small talk incident to small and confined areas Thus artistic traditions which began generously with a free out of door range become narrowed down as the generations pass become fixed in the walls and roofs of precedent and law acquiring a definiteness and sanctity to which they are not entitled The arts like groups and races of men inherit too much from the super civilized past even more than super civilized human beings do they need the great renewal from Mother Earth who bore them  In this country we have been on the whole too content with those walls and roofs of precedent built by the arts of the past Yet in spite of this handicap our best work in the various arts rides free more or less and carries a message from the wilderness We hear a hint of it in the finest poems of Emerson and Bryant Whittier and Longfellow We detect a sentimentalized version of it in the landscapes of the Hudson River School and in the out ofdoor yearnings of colonial houses We feel its freedom more strongly in the simple porch winged villas and in certain frankly expressive sky scrapers which are developing architectural style without much aid from historic design It became a dominant motive in such painters of land and sea as Winslow Homer Inness Wyant and Martin and some of their successors are carrying on the proud tradition Cooper of course handed it over in chunks in Hawthorne it was a longing and an agony and Thoreau subdued it to   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  a scholar s use and nobly philosophized it Poe was lyric with its passion and color a caged mocking bird beating its wings and in another art Albert Pinkham Ryder was a somewhat more fortunate parallel Even in Whistler who carried the war into Europe we feel the flavor through all the sophistication Mark Twain preserved its epic bigness through all his social and literary adventures And in Whitman it was the breath of life the force which enabled him to over ride all confining barriers In the future as we become more self confident less colonial our art should inevitably get more and more free of walls and roofs Its triumphs will come from those who knock down not those who prop up such erections or perhaps rather from those who enriched by the discipline of their somewhat imprisoning beauty are strong enough to pass through and beyond it and go free Edgar Lee Masters gave us Spoon River in this spirit and Vachel Lindsay and Carl Sandburg as well are artistically considered the educated sons of pioneers  In the education of the spirit wild Nature is the supreme teacher The artist who remains in towns or in suburban parks and gardens or even he who takes summers out ofdoors in cultivated farm lands misses the spiritual discipline of freedom the supreme renewal He may be unaware of this loss super sophisticated worldling clinging to the skirts of civilization he may be content to repeat and elaborate to build French chateaus in North Carolina or Ionic colonnaded sky scrapers in New York to plant Italian gardens on the sand dune bluffs of Lake Michigan to   The Great Renewal  carve out archaic Greek rhythms in sculpture and Miltonic or Swinburnian rhythms in poetry Meantime our vast western wonderland is waiting for him Nature the ultimate modernist is ready to broaden his vision and enormously increase his range ready to give him not more learning but power over all his learning not man made facts and monuments but God made grandeur with its lesson of spiritual energy and control  A young New York poet who has recently gone west for the first time writes from Taos New Mexico of the influence of the beautiful maternal West upon my jaded sense and adds  I shall like the West when I get used to its generosity The East is so small and I have been lessened in its presence far beyond my wishes  There we have a truly enlightened acknowledgment of what our south western wonderland may do for and with the soul of man a wonderland in which Nature herself has conceived and developed the vast pre Adamite architecture of the Grand Canon and of those strange terraced fortresses in the Painted Desert and in which old barbaric tribes have taken Nature s hint in mesa pueblos that grow out of the desert as expressively as the cactus or the mesquite This magic wonderland is destined to an immense authority over the future of American art the only question is how soon will its influence begin as a recognizable force Our painters shut off from Europe by the War are going there more and more and more and more not only our painters but our sculptors and architects as well will inevitably   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  feel the primitive art of this region and its more developed masterpieces among the kindred Aztecs and Incas to the south as a newly revealed ancient Style of imperishable power and beauty a Style as authentic as the Greek or the Chinese as fit in its human expression of a region and a race In nature of such incomparable forms and colors and in primitive art so right so expressive our artists should slough off their sophistication and find that Great Renewal which may energize the art of the world  Our poets also must face the issue As with their confrères in the other arts Europe has hitherto been their place of pilgrimage and those who stay there almost inevitably become wandering cosmopolites who fascinated by the extremes of a sophisticated culture become more adept in expressing these extremes than the natives themselves Mr Pound and Mr Eliot are cases in point born under the flag they do not lose their love of freedom in fact it gives a special edge a tang to their observations and interpretations of a life too long cribbed cabined and confined but practically they become limited to these aspects of life and lose touch with and faith in bigger spaces and larger realities Even the War which brutally destroying man s walls and roofs and casting him back upon savagery has somehow proved a Great Renewer of the spirit in over burdened Europe even the War does not entrap them with its ferocious glamour their art goes by unscathed If John Gould Fletcher and H D have yielded less to the world is it not because of a deeper pioneer strain of wildness in them   The Great Renewal  Fletcher with his adoration of scenic beauty and H D with her virginal innocence of civilization her Greek kinship with the early gods  Europe or the wilderness the choice will become more and more urgent for our seers of visions  Twenty years ago I travelled from Italy to Arizona and to my profound surprise found Arizona the bigger thing of the two It is not unlikely that after this War which is to make the whole world wise American art American poetry will have the same illuminating experience  Search not in cities for the Pierian spring H M  POETRY AS AN ART  It may sound exaggerated yet it is true that people are more interested in art than in anything else in life All that we need and crave for above the mere protection and maintenance of our bodies can be reduced to art needs It is some sense of form of balance harmony decoration which makes our clothes our furniture our houses what they are We work for this and we go to war for this It is true of rich and poor of the civilized man and the savage  The human mind finds nature and its own existence beyond and above its own proud self Even the most practical man sitting in his office has moments in which he is haunted consciously or subconsciously by what we can not but call the mystery of life On this brink reached in   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  a flash the human mind totters it is seeking for support In art it finds a refuge and a ballast To this is due its religious cravings its feeling for harmony even its desire for display It would fall all in a heap without these Knowledge discovery the mind gently scoffs at these It is in art that there is a real grip a hold and a rest for the abeyance of being  In two ways it finds assuagement One way is music in which is a spurring excitement and comfort at the same time The other way is to put it very crudely explanation of at least a part of the haunting mystery interpretation Rhythm in other arts is music received through the eyes instead of through the ear To these rhythm and interpretation separated or combined all art forms can be reduced In a painted landscape whatever is not rhythm is interpretation of life The same is true of a portrait What there is in it of the photographic is desecration of life since it is impossible to render in any medium the thousand qualities pregnant in reality any rendering not imbued with the reverential spirits of rhythm and interpretation is deadly and treacherous This is also true of idealization which usually means a sentimental rendering In addition to being superficial it is also false bad photography  Rhythm and interpretation then are the only important art qualities In a certain work of art the one or the other may predominate But interpretation to be art must be extremely simplified Through simplification interpre   Poetry as an Art  tation becomes an art language In concentrating on the subject and in cutting away all but what is absolutely and directly needed for the interpretation lies the function of art Whatever is more than this serves only to show the artisan s so called skill which in reality is just the opposite of skill In spite of what art critics may usually entitle it it is merely rhetoric padding ranting etc not art  The Egyptian figure El Beled might be taken as an example of interpretation It might appear mere realism if superficially observed But the sculptor knew his subject with a sort of god like knowledge and he spun from the depth and strength of his knowledge I would say played with it but the word play is usually misunderstood true play is extremely serious The sculptor of the great Chephron ennobled his subject idealized it This was entirely different from our modern way when we idealize we are more or less deceitful There is no real attainment of depth The artist s brain is either too lazy or shallow or he is content to bank on the observer s shallowness or laziness  Rhythm as an art element is above interpretation just as interpretation is above didacticism or photography But being human with immediate human needs it is hard for us to believe that rhythm is a greater art need than interpretation or even than the various forms of photography didactic detail etc  The recent revolution in the other arts which is divesting them of the various forms of the photographic didactic   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  story pseudo rhythm has had its effect also on poetry Yet owing to certain peculiarities in the nature of poetry the modern poet unlike the other artist has very few models  Words being so closely associated with immediate human needs it is always hard for the poet to escape from these to the greater needs of the human spirit It is true that even the greatest of the ancient works of art were not entirely free from these influences still if the Assyrian man headed lion or bull had a taint of the didactic the artist succeeded in melting it almost completely in rhythm The Egyptians who did not always bother with rhythm as such have succeeded in giving us the most perfect interpretive art imaginable One can see that readily in Thoueris the statuette representing maternity and more or less readily in most of their best work In the early Chinese sculpture we find a pure and tender handling of reality combined with simplification In the Hindu art the imagination rambles freely In the American aboriginal art we find a noble symbolism and extreme simplification not only of the human being but of almost everything in nature Rhythm is to be found in most of these and is predominant in Assyrian art in Hittite art and in a simple or complex form in Chinese and Japanese paintings  In poetry the art quality was less present Greek poetry was effected by outer elements nationalistic philosophic etc which are not pure art elements This is true of other ancient poetry   Poetry as an Art  Reluctant as one may be to admit this the ardent expression of emotion is not art it is generally a form of photography It is only when it is interpretive and combined with simplification or when the imagination as it were melts it and forms something grotesque or fantastic that it becomes the spirit food called art It is only in rare cases when the poet s soul is very gentle and childlike that the mere expression of personal moods forms art in Catullus Villon and to a lesser degree in Burns Keats Heine the moods reveal to us something surprising and fresh are interpretive  The better models for the modern poet are the ancient sculptors or oriental painters as the art elements in them are purer and more readily discernible He should learn from them to simplify his subject or to idealize it in the pure and genuine way they did He should learn from them what true idealization is in order to avoid the pseudo the shallow the sentimental the vulgar and the stupid all often mistaken among us for idealization  As for the rhythm of words the words in poetry must be as if born together with the rhythm But the reader must learn to distinguish between sing song or rag time rhythm and deep pure rhythm It can be laid down almost as a rule that a rhythm that carries the reader too strongly is bad It will be found to be poor through monotony and through lack of control One will usually find the same symptoms in the ideas of the poem  The poet should remember that there is much good and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  bad verse and that humanity can bear waiting till his work is ripe in every sense of the word  Max Michelson  THE SIXTEENTH TO THE TWENTIETH  There is need in many quarters to day as is invariably the case in a war era for a defense of the avocation of poesy That which isn t active in the light of the outer eye must be ostracized says your hot headed citizen devoid of that vision of the inner which sees warfare as a material combat brought on by spiritual forces among which that supreme lover of liberty the poet is as any mere history demonstrates a generalissimo For the benefit of the street corner or parliamentary soap box braggart who sneers at the parchment faced beauty priest doing his quiet and presumably innocuous work in the dark of privacy one might stretch forth a list of the poets now dead wounded or still engaged on the European battleground or for his still larger benefit one might cite the works which these men and countless others before them have contributed works which more than any impassioned outburst in legislatures have kept liberty driving digging scrambling and climbing against and conquering its enemies In modern times one has only to breathe the single name and the multifarious performances public as well as personal of Walt Whitman However since it is necessary to bring the achievement of the past to substantiate the ideals and theories of the present against opponents who are always skeptical un   The Sixteenth to the Twentieth  less confronted with records one might with subtler persuasion echo the name of Sir Philip Sidney through whom the sixteenth century addresses the twentieth  A month before his thirty second birthday Sir Philip the star of Elizabethan knighthood godson of Philip the Second of Spain son of the lord deputy of Ireland and a diplomat in the service of Queen Bess soldier first and poet second was mortally wounded in the battle of Zut phen Poetry faced the same criticism in his day which it faces to day so much so that Sir Philip was forced to write It hath so hard a time that the very earth lamenteth it and to lift his hand in that glorious attack on his age which he termed The Defense of Poesy Surely it would not prove amiss for POETRY to repeat the long drum roll of this single sentence from the oracular utterance of the great patriot of the sixteenth century surely it must penetrate the ear drum of the most veritable deaf and dumb asylum in military Germany itself  Since poetry is of all human learnings the most ancient and of most fatherly antiquity as from whence other learnings have taken their beginnings since it is so universal that no learned nation doth despise it nor barbarous nation is without it since both Roman and Greek gave divine names unto it the one of prophesying the other of making and that indeed that name of making is fit for him considering that whereas other arts retain themselves within their subjects and receive as it were their being from it the poet only bringeth his own stuffs and doth not learn a conceit out of a matter but maketh matter for a conceit since neither his description nor his end containeth any evil the thing described cannot be evil since his effects be so good as to teach goodness and delight the learner of it since therein namely in moral doctrine the chief of all knowledges he doth not only pass the historian but for instructing is well nigh comparable to the philosopher and for   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  moving leaveth him behind him since the Holy Scripture wherein there is no uncleanness hath whole parts in it poetical and that even our Saviour Christ vouchsafed to use the flowers of it since all his kinds are not only in their united forms but in their several dissections fully commendable I think and think I think rightly the laurel crown appointed for triumphant captains doth worthily of all other learnings honor the poet s triumph  Who among your brawling detractors dares brave this machine gun challenge or if he considers a bayonet thrust easier to parry let him try riposting this shorter sentence of Sidney s It is not riming and versing that maketh a poet A K  REVIEWS  ONCE MORE THE GEORGIANS  Georgian Poetry 1916 1917 The Poetry Bookshop Lon  don  The third instalment of Georgian Poetry does not give us so many changes as its list of contents seems to indicate True Mr Abercrombie is absent but his calculated essays in brutality his dramas of frigid violence were already beginning to stale before the second issue was published For the rest there are a number of new names most of them safe upholders of the Georgian tradition with the exception of two or three who have tried to discover a new note in the all absorbing spectacle of England at war Let us take the work as it stands  W J Turner who is given pride of place and whom many English critics are acclaiming as a great discovery   Once More the Georgians  sets up the characteristic Georgian note at the outset in  Romance  When I was but thirteen or so  I went into a golden land Chimborazo Cotopaxi Took me by the hand  My father died my brother too They passed like fleeting dreams I stood where Popocatapetl In the sunlight gleams  It is obvious that this sort of poetry can go on indefinitely until the supply of high sounding geographical names runs out And what excuse Mr Turner can find for coupling in the same sentence a verb in the past tense with a verb in the present tense I do not know Little things like grammar and syntax are perhaps negligible  Ecstasy is as one would expect an etiolated echo of Oscar Wilde One gets a frieze of youths a beach with shells on it and such like also a great display of limbs  meaning of course legs Thus Mr Turner And the wind came and purified my limbs With Magic the poet enters a conservatory a true  Georgian to seek for magic in a hot house Nine labored stanzas of perfervid description end in these lines which need no comment  When silence creeps among the leaves And the echoing heart deceives  W e turn to The Hunter after a vain struggle to discover who or what it is that the echoing heart deceives   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and are regaled with another imaginary journey through a thicket of geographical names to the haunting land of Yucatan a land of whose fever stricken jungle overgrowing strange old ruins Mr Hunter prefers to remain blissfully ignorant  In The Sky sent Death we are back again on Greek territory listening to these witching strains  Sitting on a stone a shepherd  Stone and shepherd sleeping  Under the high blue Attic sky  Along the green monotony  Grey sheep creeping creeping  Tennyson is said to have once rapped out that any goose could hiss One might remind Mr Turner of this remark since we have here six sibilants in two lines of verse As for the rest of the poem it may be stated in a sentence The sleepy shepherd hears a humming it proves to be a German aeroplane which drops a bomb on the aforesaid sleepy shepherd Behold the dénouement  Sitting on a stone no shepherd Stone and shepherd sleeping But across the hill and valley Grey sheep creeping creeping   I have wasted so much space on Mr Turner because it seems to me that he is the absolute epitome of what these Georgians stand for what they like and are not ashamed to like Here we have bad rhymes bad syntax jingly metre and subject matter which is simply nothing but the apotheosis of picture post card prettiness The force of Georgian ism could no further go For myself I prefer either as   music or as verse Edward Lear s The owl and the pussycat put to sea in a beautiful pea green boat or Far and few far and few are the isles where the jumblies live to all these Popocatapetls and Yucatans and other Georgian magics  Having got past Mr Turner it is with no shock of surprise that we find Mr Stephens who is old enough to know better writing thus having been infected apparently with the selfsame creeping paralysis of brain  I flit and twit In the sun for a bit When the light so bright is shining O Or sit and fit My plumes or knit Straw plaits for the nest s nice lining O   And so on through five or six pages of sweet simplicity degenerating into childishness  Mr Rosenberg a newcomer who has done better work contributes a single brief poem containing this unhappy mixture  While the new lips my spirit would kiss  Were not red lips of flesh  But the huge kiss of power  three lines perhaps in their own way the worst ever written  By the time we arrive at Mr Hodgson suspicion grows to weary certainty we know what these Georgian poets are aiming at But it is not poetry unless you accept nothing as poetry but the artificially naive the jejune the banal the vaporous the jingling If all the poems in   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the book are not in this manner those which follow it yet represent the proclaimed and perferred type the Georgian type in excelsis Well let us admit that it is an interesting type in itself but let us not call it poetry fogged verse will do or verse for tired minds or sentimentico hysterialism  Any exceptions A few Mr J C Squire has in The Lily of Malud produced a poem It has a subject and a certain impressiveness of effect Mr Monro caresses adroitly minor themes Mr Davies does not abuse his space or his adjectives And there is a certain grim honesty about the war work of three young men Robert Nichols Robert Graves and Siegfried Sassoon which leads one perhaps to hope that after the war even the Georgians may show more tolerance for the modern world as it is and less delight in affectations and redundancies  As for the rest of the volume I for one frankly cannot see that any great harm would have been done had the printers mixed up the pages and given Mr Freeman s poems say to Mr Gibson or Mr Gibson s to Mr Freeman or even Mr de la Mare s to Mr Masefield and vice versa since neither of these two appears here with his most personal and distinctive work The one thing certain about these Georgian poets is that they are true to type There are no startling radicals no intoxicating freaks in this society careful inbreeding has eliminated such a possibility From W J Turner at the beginning to Maurice Baring who at the close trots out into a modern   Once More the Georgians  soldier s elegy all the old properties and paraphernalia Lucifer King Arthur words like nursling and crysolite from the first page to the last we move in a world of unrealities of abstractions of exhausted platitudes For those who prefer monotony to energy who breathe best in the pumped out space under a bell glass I can recommend no better book than the third Georgian Poetry  John Gould Fletcher  MORE ANTHOLOGIES CHIEFLY TOPOGRAPHICAL  The Chicago Anthology A Collection of Verse from the Work of Chicago Poets Selected and arranged by Charles G Blanden and Minna Mathison Roadside  Press Sunflowers A Book of Kansas Poems Selected by Willard Wattles A C McClurg amp Co The Book of New York Verse edited by Hamilton Fish Armstrong G P Putnam s Sons  The Chicago Anthology is as inclusive as a city directory in fact it constitutes a poetic directory of Chicago with one or two rather important exceptions who may not have been at home when the census taker called the most notable exception being Edgar Lee Masters The book covers a period of twenty five years or more and about one hundred and twenty five poets are represented many of them no longer living and many of them no longer living in Chicago for instance Mr Brand Whitlock It is   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  difficult to say what constitutes a Chicago poet if a brief residence in the city makes Yone Noguchi one why not Vachel Lindsay who studied two or three years at the Art Institute and who visits us often  The percentage of ore in the volume is not high and this is a pity since we gain from it nothing of that larger mood which has given Chicago its present distinction as a poetic centre This could only have been given through the representation at greater length of the major Chicago poets and the omission of all the minors among whom I should have been happy to be one since the editors chose without consultation positively the worst poem I ever wrote and one which I should only too willingly have abandoned on a less public doorstep Unfortunately the major poets when in at all have been represented by their least significant poems  Mr Llewellyn Jones in his introduction explains or it would almost seem apologizes for the conservative principle of selection drawing rather too sharply the distinction between modernist and conservative poetry Poetry is poetry and there is less difference than one imagines between what is called conservative and what is called radical poetry when it is good Radical poetry of today is the conservative poetry of tomorrow The real distinction to be made is between not the poets but the critics and here one must distinguish not only between conservative and radical but between genuine conservatism and oldfogeyism   More Anthologies  The question is not as to whether the editors of this book have printed the old and ignored the new they have omitted too much that is vital too much of what has given Chicago its present reputation for creative vitality which is after all the only excuse for a book of this sort  Mr Jones develops a novel theory an almost Freudian theory of how Chicago inspires some of her non realistic idealistic poets through antithesis If one writes about lilies and roses it is in order to forget the stockyards But every or any poet has a right to his ivory tower he does not have to prove his right to it we do not deny it to him All we ask is that the tower be ivory not celluloid On the other hand a man is not a modern simply because he writes about the external details of his environment nor must a man to be a Chicago poet write about Chicago The omission from this book however of Carl Sandburg s Chicago intrinsically powerful as it is gives us a clue to the inhibitions of the editors  The topographical scheme for an anthology unless the area covered be fairly wide and possessed of an ancient culture is not entirely satisfactory Kansas for instance does not stack up very well against Massachusetts Illinois would fare better though it is only in the present generation that the Middle West may be said to have become vocal Perhaps in another generation or two the Far West not the coast line but the intervening plains plateaus and mountains will have found a voice to carry beyond   the Mississippi something more indigenous that is than the expression of the transplanted easterner The best known Kansas poet is of course Walt Mason whose precedence as the innovator of polyphonic prose has not had the full recognition it deserves Kansas also claims Harry Kemp and William Allen White and even John G Whittier and Vachel Lindsay are in this collection because they have paid poetic tribue to Kansas A G H  The bulky New York volume seems to contain every poem ever written on a New York subject from Walt Whitman s Manhattan to Ezra Rand s N Y and from  H C Bunner s The Ball 1789 to Franklin P Adams The Flat hunter s Way Our great American metropolis is not unstoried and unsung H M  Christ in the Poetry of Today an Anthology Edited by Martha Foote Crow The Woman s Press One who opens this book with misgiving expecting  something in the nature of a tract suitable for Sunday schools will be agreeably surprised and disappointed The editor is to be commended for her courage in including poems more radical than one would have expected in a book of this kind among these Edgar Lee Masters The Apology of Demetrius Ezra Pound s The Goodly Fere and other poems in which Christ is represented less as a figure head than as a human being This is the modern spirit which as Mrs Crow says in her introduction was not so much in evidence twenty or thirty years ago but dating from about 1910 the poems dealing with Christ are often of a   More Anthologies  new kind never seen in books of poetry before Among the good contributions besides the above are poems by Lizette Woodworth Reese Agnes Lee Carl Sandburg Harriet Monroe Barbara Peattie Erskine Badger Clarke Florence Kiper Frank and William Vaughn Moody The book would be improved by a table of contents Authors and titles are indexed separately but this is not very practical for general use A C H CORRESPONDENCE  THE RETORT COURTEOUS  Editors of POETRY Perhaps if we had been able to express ourselves a little more clearly we should not have offended the editors of POETRY SO deeply or gotten ourselves stigmatized as parlor pessimists The author of Traps for the Unwary had no intention of condemning the little theatres and little magazines which by providing a medium of publicity and experimentation have done so much as H M truly said to stimulate the artistic imagination of the younger writers And no agency in this work has been more valuable than POETRY In appealing for more careful and better oriented criticism he did the new poetry and the little magazines the honor of assuming that they had arrived He took them for granted in the belief that they could now be discussed openly without fear of destroying them by a rude touch   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  H M and A C H more conscious of the stern fighting and risk which have been involved in getting a reception for the new poetry as against the mossbacks and academes still rush jealously and angrily to the defense of their contributors at the sign of any fancied slight It is true that POETRY has not neglected criticism indeed it has been quite as much a journal of criticism as a vehicle of publicity But by criticism we mean discussion of a larger scope You can discuss poetry and a poetry movement solely as poetry as a fine art shut up in its own world subject to its own rules and values or you can examine it in relation to the larger movement of ideas and social movements and the peculiar intellectual and spiritual color of the time To treat poetry entirely in terms of itself is the surest way to drive it into futility and empty verbalism In the last issue of POETRY Mr Kreymborg suggests that this is exactly what is likely to happen to the new poetry It will go to seed unless it is understood as an expression of life pregnant with possibilities This is the kind of criticism we were asking for And Miss Lowell s book seems to us important not because it gave a little more superfluous advertising to these much discussed poets but because it did attempt to place them with reference to the American intellectual soil and to the changing American attitudes towards beauty and the joy of life Moreover she completely abandoned the indiscriminate note of propaganda which A C H still apparently thinks it is necessary to use even with reference to such uneven poets as Vachel   Lindsay and handles her six poets unsparingly separating the false in their work from the true and placing them in relation to a larger intellectual and artistic whole  This is what we meant by criticism Are we to understand that the editors of POETRY resent such an attitude That they are going to insist on keeping poetry as a rose garden in which are to be shown the new varieties for mere observation and esoteric enjoyment Already there is evidence of a kind of developing orthodoxy of the new that is hurt at this ceaseless sifting of the new poets work and the effort to awaken them to a sense of the imaginative possibilities implicit in their verse There is no way for instance of knowing yet where Mr Lindsay will come out He still lacks self knowledge and self criticism Side by side with the thrilling Congo and General Booth there are pages of imitativeness and banality At times he is a mere verbal experimenter at others he strikes the pure golden ring Who in the little circle of poetry missionaries points out to him the dangers of mere verbality and the imperative need of growth  If criticism confines itself to a purely aesthetic standard then this verse is certainly doomed The new poetry is sure enough of its ground from Cibola Arizona to Lewiston Maine there is evidence that all who have the capacity of appreciation are acquainted with this literary renaissance But this public enthusiastic and hospitable seems to be still moving hazily in a mist of values and interpretations For it still gets aesthetic instead of social criticism   POETRY A Magatine of Verse  And many of the writers disturb us by somehow perversely refusing to broaden their imaginative and intellectual horizons So much of this new fresh spirit is intellectual rather than poetical that it is time it left the easy medium of free verse for the novel and the story and the essay such as the Lawrences and Cannans and Beresfords give us in England to our delight What are we to think of a modern country of a hundred million people whose younger literary generation turns out from one year to another not a single novel that can be called without reservation artistic or true or that can rank with the imported work of our younger contemporaries Is not that something to be pessimistic about and to make one feel that here is a task for criticism to do some explaining Hospitality is no longer enough This army of talent needs the demand the spur the suggestiveness of criticism of a criticism that aims at carrying the fresh and creative expression of the present towards a greater wisdom and  clarity and ardor of life  Randolph Bourne Van Wyck Brooks Note by the Editor This interesting contribution to the discus  sion of aesthetic and social criticism in general and certan spedai  values in particular is too suggestive for a tail piece acknowledg  ment and will be considered in our next issue   A Correction  A CORRECTION  Dear Editor A C H in the July POETRY wrote that Edgar Lee Masters and Robert Frost received in it POETRY their first appreciation If this means appreciation of my poetry I beg to say that my poetry received appreciation in England and to an extent in America before POETRY was founded If this means appreciation of Spoon River that production was copied parodied and commented upon by the press during the summer of 1914 It was quoted in Current Opinion for September 1914 while POETRY S first notice and quotation of Spoon River appeared in its October number 1914 Since you cannot justly do me the honor to claim a first appreciation of any of my poetry I submit this correction to be printed in view also of the fact that A C H has frequently printed the same or similiar claims touching my work  Edgar Lee Masters  Note by the Editor A C H wrote loosely she should have specified Spoon River But POETRY S editors have been unaware of the fact that in calling attention to that poem Current Opinion was a month ahead of them That paper s comments on and quotations from the work of living poets have reflected the taste and enthusiasm of its editor Mr Edward J Wheeler who is as we all know president of the Poetry Society of America a taste possibly too catholic but as a rule singularly enlightened and progressive  This department of Current Opinion was indeed one of the first gleams on the horizon after a long period of apathetic darkness perhaps the first authoritative hint offered to the American people that their poets were doing anything worthy of attention and encouragement And the paper continues its good work without loss of enthusiasm   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  BACK TO THE MACHINE SHOP  Dear POETRY Some gigantic figure has flung innumerable brick shaped factories on the outskirts of Jersey City Newark and Elizabeth and along the Hackensack river They are like big black bugs and crawl into the green fields Arrogant and determined they look down on the modest little farm houses  I work in one of these four walls alongside of Larsens Carlsens and Augustsens all patriotic Americans from Stockholm and the fjords All around us are little farms and it is not an unusual sight to see a factory usually a machine shop grow up over night between rows of corn or a tall chimney near an acre of beans And a lot of goats promenade under our windows with big hanging udders  I am glad I have got back to the machine shop Here is where the pulse of our times beats strongest and clearest This is the place that furnishes an answer to all our questions All we have all we create all we plan must hereafter have its beginning here  These queer and noisy places feed us and clothe us and house us and compel us to think along certain tracks  The next father of Christ can t be a carpenter he must come out of the machine shop So I would say to all ambitious fathers Get into a machine shop or you are out of the running  This reminds me of what I wanted to say to the boys from the U of C They are lucky to study at a university   but I hope they will not write anything after leaving it but get a job in a machine shop They must run a lathe or a milling machine and watch some Carlsen caress a tool steel point and call it a peach  William Saphier NOTES  Mr Vachel Lindsay of Springfield Illinois whose latest book of verse was The Chinese Nightingale and Other Poems Macmillan Co 1916 has been at work during the past year chiefly on The Golden Book of Springfield which as the editor understands it will be chiefly prose with poems by way of incidental interludes China whose massive weight and persistent strength are expressed in this latest poem has been a favorite subject of the poet s thought for years a subject suggested perhaps partly by the long residence in China of his sister Mrs Wakefield the wife of the distinguished medical missionary  Miss Zoë Akins of St Louis whom our readers will remember is the author of Interpretations Mitchell Kennerley and of various plays in verse and prose which have been successfully produced by the Washington Square Players and other companies Since Mark Twain wrote his prose epic Life on the Mississippi the Great River has been too much neglected by the poets of the Middle West and it is appropriate that its beauty and grandeur should appeal to the imagination of a poet whose life has been spent in the great city which rises at the confluence of the two great streams that flow together to the Gulf  Marjorie Allen Seiffert
