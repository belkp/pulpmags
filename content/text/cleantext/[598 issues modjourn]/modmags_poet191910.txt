PECKSNIFFIANA  FABLIAU OF FLORIDA  Barque of phosphor  On the palmy beach  Move outward into heaven Into the alabasters And night blues  Foam and cloud are one Sultry moon monsters Are dissolving  Fill your black hull With white moonlight  There will never be an end To this droning of the surf   HOMUNCULUS ET LA BELLE ETOILE  In the sea Biscayne there prinks The young emerald evening star Good light for drunkards poets widows And ladies soon to be married  By this light the salty fishes Arch in the sea like tree branches Going in many directions Up and down  This light conducts The thoughts of drunkards the feelings Of widows and trembling ladies The movements of fishes  How pleasant an existence it is That this emerald charms philosophers Until they become thoughtlessly willing To bathe their hearts in later moonlight  Knowing that they can bring back thought In the night that is still to be silent Reflecting this thing and that Before they sleep  It is better that as scholars They should think hard in the dark cuffs Of voluminous cloaks And shave their heads and bodies   Wallace Stevens  It might well be that their mistress Is no gaunt fugitive phantom She might after all be a wanton Abundantly beautiful eager  Fecund From whose being by starlight on sea coast The innermost good of their seeking Might come in the simplest of speech  It is a good light then for those That know the ultimate Plato Tranquillizing with this jewel The torments of confusion  THE WEEPING BURGHER  It is with a strange malice  That I distort the world  Ah that ill humors Should mask as white girls And ah that Scaramouche  Should have a black barouche  The sorry verities Yet in excess continual There is cure of sorrow   Permit that if as ghost I come Among the people burning in me still I come as belle design Of foppish line  And I then tortured for old speech A white of wildly woven rings I weeping in a calcined heart  My hands such sharp imagined things  PETER PARASOL  Aux taureaux Dieu cornes donne Et sabots durs aux chevaux  Why are not women fair All as Andromache  Having each one most praisable  Ears eyes soul skin hair  Good God That all beasts should have The tusks of the elephant  Or be beautiful  As large ferocious tigers are  It is not so with women  I wish they were all fair  And walked in fine clothes With parasols in the afternoon air   Wallace Stevens  EXPOSITION OF THE CONTENTS OF A CAB  Victoria Clementina negress Took seven white dogs T o ride in a cab  Bells of the dogs chinked  Harness of the horses shuffled Like brazen shells  Oh hé hé Fragrant puppets By the green lake pallors She too is flesh  And a breech cloth might wear Netted of topaz and ruby And savage blooms  Thridding the squawkiest jungle In a golden sedan White dogs at bay  What breech cloth might you wear Except linen embroidered By elderly women  PLOUGHING ON SUNDAY  The white cock s tail Tosses in the wind   The turkey cock s tail  Glitters in the sun  Water in the fields The wind pours down The feathers flare And bluster in the wind  Remus blow your horn  I m ploughing on Sunday Ploughing North America Blow your horn  Tum ti tum Ti tum tum tum The turkey cock s tail Spreads to the sun  The white cock s tail Streams to the moon Water in the fields The wind pours down  BANAL SOJOURN  Two wooden tubs of blue hydrangeas stand at the foot of the stone steps The sky is a blue gum streaked with rose The trees are black   Wallace Stevens  The grackles crack their throats of bone in the smooth air Moisture and heat have swollen the garden into a slum of  bloom Pardie Summer is like a fat beast sleepy in mildew Our old bane green and bloated serene who cries That bliss of stars that princox of evening heaven re  minding of seasons When radiance came running down slim through the bareness And so it is one damns that green shade at the bottom of  the land For who can care at the wigs despoiling the Satan ear And who does not seek the sky unfuzzed soaring to the  princox One has a malady here a malady One feels a malady  THE INDIGO GLASS IN THE GRASS  Which is real This bottle of indigo glass in the grass Or the bench with the pot of geraniums the stained mat  tress and the washed overalls drying in the sun Which of these truly contains the world  Neither one nor the two together   ANECDOTE OF THE JAR  I placed a jar in Tennessee And round it was upon a hill It made the slovenly wilderness Surround that hill  The wilderness rose up to it And sprawled around no longer wild The jar was round upon the ground And tall and of a port in air  It took dominion everywhere The jar was gray and bare It did not give of bird or bush Like nothing else in Tennessee  OF THE SURFACE OF THINGS  I  In my room the world is beyond my understanding But when I walk I see that it consists of three or four hills and a cloud  II  From my balcony I survey the yellow air Reading where I have written The spring is like a belle undressing   Wallace Stevens  III  The gold tree is blue The singer has pulled his cloak over his head The moon is in the folds of the cloak  THE CURTAINS IN THE HOUSE OF THE METAPHYSICIAN  It comes about that the drifting of these curtains  Is full of long motions as the ponderous  Deflations of distance or as clouds  Inseparable from their afternoons Or the changing of light the dropping  Of the silence wide sleep and solitude Of night in which all motion  Is beyond us as the firmament Up rising and down falling bares The last largeness bold to see  THE PLACE OF THE SOLITAIRES  Let the place of the solitaires Be a place of perpetual undulation  Whether it be in mid sea On the dark green water wheel Or on the beaches There must be no cessation   Of motion or of the noise of motion The renewal of noise And manifold continuation  And most of the motion of thought And its restless iteration  In the place of the solitaires Which is to be a place of perpetual undulation  THE PALTRY NUDE STARTS ON A SPRING VOYAGE  But not on a shell she starts Archaic for the sea But on the first found weed She scuds the glitters Noiselessly like one more wave  She too is discontent And would have purple stuff upon her arms Tired of the salty harbors Eager for the brine and bellowing Of the high interiors of the sea  The wind speeds her Blowing upon her hands And watery back She touches the clouds where she goes In the circle of her traverse of the sea   Wallace Stevens  Yet this is meagre play In the scurry and water shine As her heels foam Not as when the goldener nude Of a later day  Will go like the centre of sea green pomp In an intenser calm Scullion of fate Across the spick torrent ceaselessly Upon her irretrievable way  COLLOQUY WITH A POLISH AUNT  Elle savait toutes les légendes du Paradis et tous les contes de la Pologne Revue des Deux Mondes  She  How is it that my saints from Voragine  In their embroidered slippers touch your spleen  He  Old pantaloons duenna of the spring  She  Imagination is the will of things Thus on the basis of the common drudge You dream of women swathed in indigo Holding their books toward the nearer stars T o read in secret burning secrecies   Wallace Stevens   STONES FOR RUSSIA  Stones we have Russia Stones to break your teeth To batter shut your hunger widened eyes Stones and the silver stab of bayonets The skilled jab the clubbed gun Of our northern bred guards these We have Russia A greeting Russia to you the groper Struggling out of the pit of centuries Uprising from primeval death groping To a dazed uncertain day a greeting Russia drunken one drunken with misery A greeting with stones  To you who have known only death till now Russia a welcome to new torture To life to a mad fact of living A welcome Russia lurching from death s stupidity From torpor into tortured consciousness welcome By this western people stones and the butts of guns Which do you wish Which do you wish Russia death or this resurrection  Chosen people chosen from the sad soil To clasp anguished visions where our bland blindness fails Sufferer of earth s anguish of the profound fate of being   Baker Brownell  Finding in primeval murk in dusky fires truth Truth mystic Russia seeing seeing Here are stones  Misery has wrought you Russia Your passion sweeps gigantic darkness Over our pagan bulbs our cool illuminations Our peace and wreaks massive terror Fear  Hurls our stones Russia  Dark prophet with unkempt terrible gesture  Envisioned folk exponent of unknown fate Where is your truth truth beyond reason taught you  By misery truth unseen to

They have spoken without understanding They have called you evil  O city of beauty Maybe it is only my heart you have shaken With your sadness of rose evenings And the shadows falling In the misty evening Under the bridges  Your avenues are velvet and symmetrical As speech slow moving  O city of beauty I come not with vain enumeration  For in the untrod night I have looked upon your rapt Presence  There was a whiteness as of wings stirring   Mark Turbyfill  END OF SUMMER  For that a great weariness has come upon me  Here in the remaining day of summer  And the over grown yard a stagnant mood  Under the boughs the apples rotting  And the fading grasses forgotten of cutting  Suffer me to wag the tongue a little  Even as leans on the fainting evening  the foliage withering I am touched with a song of brown and of shadows And of colors lingering And I passed before a house of vines To hear a myriad of birds therein Crying crying  A SONG OF GIVERS AND TAKERS  Oh pity them that receive Them on whom are showered the gifts of men Once I gave a very little thing And my life became as a great procession As untouched beautiful music But now I have known love I have taken love s two hands And the kindness thereof Heavy is the heart at the harvest The high heaped measure Oh pity them that receive   WORDS ABOUT LOVE  I cannot tell you what it is waits beyond love Nor what it means the still hour after  I can think only of a wide field of poppies afire On driven stems dashed in the gale  I cannot touch you now I lie beside you chill My heart has waned cold A high white mountain has breathed upon my heart  Let us gather out of our thoughts a poppy cloak To draw about this strangeness  I cannot tell you what it is waits beyond love Nor what it means the still hour after  JOURNEY  Life is more sweet than I Knew the shifted scene Less wavered more trimmed with light Than the years before Look down People pass over the ice As a file of thin ghosts creep And fade beyond a hill You and you and you Small souls shrinking away   Mark Turbyfill  And you and you and you Bearing lights in your hands Approaching eternally Life is More sweet than I knew  Mark Turbyfill  THE ORCHARD  The swiftness of blown youth swiftness of death Are in the orchard bloom and blossom fall And in a little while is none at all Of this cool flaming glory Like a breath Blown on the pane it fades without a trace To dim new leaves that hide the nesting bird I think there is not any quickest word So swift as beauty s passing from its place  Yet we who dwell in love beneath this bough Know neither fading nor the falling flower Our immortality is all secure As Beauty s ruling still the Then and Now Careless what fleeting error stains the hour Child of the fragile phantoms that endure  John Towner Frederick   THREE POEMS  TO MY HEART  Desiderio captura sive suo sive aliorum  Caged bird prisoner on thine own heart feeding What shall I say to thee What comfort is in me For thee whose wings whose heart are bleeding bleeding From the hands that clipped and the unsatisfied mouth  feeding Angrily hungrily  Caged bird prisoner insatiately feeding What have they done to thee whose were the hands that  caged thee Clipped thy wings thy wings and left them bleeding Pinionless powerless of flight from the mouth feeding Hungrily wearily  Caged bird prisoner wingless and weary of feeding Whence did they capture thee what heaven heard thy  rapture First ere captivity set thy small heart bleeding Bleeding unconsumed beneath the sad mouth feeding Wearily ceaselessly  Caged bird prisoner when done thy woeful feeding Whither wilt thou fly in what deep what height   Maurice Browne  Hide thy maimed body thy mouth stayed from feeding Thy songless mouth thy heart bleeding bleeding Deathlessly hopelessly  TO HER WHO PASSES  Her footsteps fall in silent sands Her hands are cool like growing leaves The fingers of her hovering hands  Touch lightly pass and time bereaves The benison of her caress Of peace or pain or bitterness  The kisses of her mouth like dew Rain gently down if she has sinned That she had sinned she never knew  Lightly she walks upon the wind And like the wind she leaves no trace Upon the quiet of this place  LOVE IS MORE CRUEL THAN DEATH  For H  If your heart s desire were an apple I would place it in your hand From the tree of life I would pluck it In Eden land   If your heart s desire were a sword of steel I would fashion it in the flame And inlay letters upon it And a star s name  If your heart s desire were carven jade I would grave for you with my pen The learning and loneliness and yearning And wisdom of men  But your heart s desire is my friend My mother s son the brother of me The friend I wear in my heart For fair is he He is fair but far to seek And free  And I have no power in my hands No help no healing no gift for you Nothing nothing save no word spoken Between us two  Maurice Browne   DESIRE  For glad eternities I make no prayer  Only to drown in your deep eyes Eyes shy and strange that haunt me night and day Leap with the young blood laughing through your veins One one with you as dew finds at last the sea  Thus to the dark gods knees I bring my prayer  For length of happy days I make no prayer  When mid the tumult of strange seas Or on a blood red field beneath cold stars Into the dark your glad young soul is blown One one with you I too to the unknown goal  Thus to dark gods I raise Ever my prayer huella Stewart   SONG  Blue eyes brown eyes green and gold eyes Eyes that question doubt deny Sudden flashing cold hard bold eyes Here s your answer I am I  Not for you and not for any Rode I into Camden town Barkeep here s my golden penny Come who will and drink it down  I m not one to lend and borrow I m not one to overstay I shall go alone tomorrow Whistling as I came today  Floyd Dell  APPEARANCES  They say that I am out at heels And that my coat is shoddy What would they say if they saw my heart Don t tell anybody  They say I am a ne er do well Ambitionless and lazy What would they say if they saw my soul Aren t people crazy  Marx G Sabel   THE PAINTED SAINT IN THE WOOD  There is a saint in love with God That I often sit and watch In the wood and I cannot believe him For I love what I see and touch  Yesterday at this time Some heavy carts passed by One peasant sang as he passed A wandering melody  I was sitting and watching the saint Painted in white and red I shall not understand him Till I am dead  DAWN  Houses grey and greyish blue  With silent sightless eyes Through the dawn press through Light the color of stone  Peers with pale surprise At those who sleep alone  M Lyster   AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD  Come to me at the top of the world O Mine before the years spill All our love into Time s cup And give our will to Time s will  My wide basin is full of starlight My moon is lighted with new fire I have lit every sun in the firmament With the hurting flame of my desire  The worms there in the valley Die to forget death But here at the top of the world I laugh under my breath  There is pain here beloved And tears terrible tears But the joys have warm mouths and the madnesses Dance downward with the years  Come to me at the top of the world O Mine The valley is deep The valley is over full with the dying And with those that sleep  But here wonderful winds blow And the pines sing one song Come to me at the top of the world Come quickly I have waited too long   Elsie A Gidlow  NEVER ANY FEAR  I shall never have any fear of love Not of its depth nor its uttermost height Its exquisite pain and its terrible delight Never never shall I have any fear of love  1 shall never hesitate to go down Into the fastness of its abyss Nor shrink from the cruelty of its awful kiss 1 shall never hesitate to go down  Never shall I dread love s strength  Nor any hurt it might give  Tender love is a sick fugitive  I shall never dread love s strength  I shall never draw back from love  Through fear of its vast pain  But build joy of it and count it gain  I shall never draw back from love  I shall never have any fear of love  Nor shrink weakly from its touch  I have loved too terribly and too much  Ever to have any fear of love  Elsie A Gidlow   THE SEARCHLIGHT  The searchlights over London Are like the fingers of a woman Wandering over the dead form of a lover  She had not thought to do that While he was living To better know his loveliness Or if she had He d stopped her with his kisses Now in her great grief Her fingers are to her Sight and sound and hearing  By all the ways of sense  She knows him lost to her Yet cannot voice her grief  Only can she raise white hands towards the heavens And passionate cursings and great grief Yet no sign comes no portent Oh if one blistering tear might come from on high To crumple up and twist the earth She d know her nightly passion not so vain When her first pang Burst the heavens with howling of guns  John Rodker   MAURA  I  Maura dreams unwakened The warm winds touch the bands That hold her hair The call of a silver horn floats by A lover tosses flowers into her hands  Maura dreams unwakened She joins the maidens in their dance Her limbs follow slow rhythms A lover leads her into the shade  She moves as in a trance  II  What dim confusion  Troubles her dream What passionate caress  Disturbs her spirit s rapt seclusion  Earth draws her close how warm Is lover earth Like a sleeping bird She gives herself Then suddenly She is a leaf whirled in the storm   Somewhere in a quiet room Her soul unstirred Dead Or sleeping Through the blind tumult hears afar The note of a horn like a silver thread She has given her soul to an echo s keeping  Ill  Who knows the mountain where the hunter rides Winding his horn Maura who heard it in her dream Wakens forlorn Too late to catch the tenuous thread Of silver sound Which in the intricate troubled fugue of earth Is drowned  IV  Maura cannot follow over the hill Her youth is land locked as a hidden pool Where thirsty love drinks deep A shining pool where lingers The color of an unseen golden sky A pool where echoes fall asleep   Marjorie Allen Seiffert  Until small restless fingers Trouble the waters cool Snatch at reflected beauty and destroy The mirrored dream The pool is never still And broken echoes die  v  The silver call has gone but there is left to her The gentleness of earth The simple mysteries of sleep and death Of love and birth There are faces hungry for smiles and starving fingers Reaching for dreams  And like a memory are the wind swept chords of night And the wide melody of evening sky Where gleams A color like the echo of a horn There is a far hill where winds die And over the hill lies music yet unborn  VI  Maura lies dead at last The body she gave to child and lover Now feeds flower and tree   Earth s arms are wide to her what breast  Offers such gentle sleeping  Her limbs lie peacefully  From the dark West  Comes down a note like the echoing cry  Of one who rides through the dusk alone  After the hunt sweeps by  It fades the night wind is forlorn  Music is still  But Maura has followed the silver horn  Over the distant hill  Over the hill where all winds die  TWO DESIGNS  A JAPANESE VASE WROUGHT IN METALS  Five harsh black birds in shining bronze come crying Into a silver sky Piercing and jubilant is the shape of their flying Their beaks are pointed with delight Curved sharply with desire The passionate direction of their flight Clear and high   Marjorie Allen Seiffert  Stretches their bodies taut like humming wire The cold wind blows into angry patterns the jet bright Feathers of their wings Their claws curl loosely safely about nothingness They clasp no things Direction and desire they possess By which in sharp unswerving flight they hold Across an iron sea to the golden beach Whereon lies carrion their feast a shore of gold That birds wrought on a vase can never reach  LORENZO S BAS RELIEF FOR A FLORENTINE CHEST  Lust is the oldest lion of them all And he shall have first place With a malignant growl satirical T o curve in foliations prodigal Round and around his face Extending till the echoes interlace With Pride and Prudence two cranes gaunt and tall  Four lesser lions crouch and malign the cranes Cursing and gossiping they shake their manes While from their long tongues leak Drops of thin venom as they speak The cranes unmoved peck grapes and grains From a huge cornucopia which rains   A plenteous meal from its antique Interior a note quite curiously Greek  And nine long serpents twist And twine twist and twine A riotously beautiful design Whose elements consist Of eloquent spirals fair and fine Embracing cranes and lions who exist Seemingly free yet tangled in that living vine  And in this chest shall be Two cubic metres of space Enough to hold all memory Of you and me And this shall be the place Where silence shall embrace Our bodies and obliterate the trace Our souls made on the purity Of night  Now lock the chest for we Are dead and lose the key  Marjorie Allen Seiffert  COMMENT  WHAT NEXT  HE October number always brings food for thought to the editors of POETRY This one marking the magazine s seventh birthday may be said to close a mystic cycle and shut its gate behind us Therefore it is a moment appropriate not for reminiscence but for projection We may inquire as to what is coming in this art this persistent and imperishable art which the human race at certain seasons for certain periods tries in vain to forget  To begin with the technique we suspect that more rather than less freedom of form is coming It seems a quaint reaction that certain sages should be shouting Free verse is dead The sculptor might as well say that marble is dead or the painter that oil colors are in their grave bronze for the one and tempera for the other to be hereafter the only wear Mr Mencken s recent eloquent hie jacet for free verse doesn t last through the article which rears it for he resurrects Sandburg and Oppenheim a queer combination to overthrow the head stone If these two free versifiers must continue to live what becomes of Mr Mencken s case And are his epitaphs for Amy Lowell and Masters and Lindsay why Lindsay in the free verse galère based on critical ground more solid than Ezra Pound s epitaph for Milton  One is moved often to wonder at the narrowness of the field still generally accorded to poets in spite of our seven   year campaign as compared with the ample kingdoms reigned over by the other arts A musical composer may choose between song sonata symphony étude rhapsody between violin piano harp drum saxophone jaz band or the whole grand orchestra between soprano contralto tenor bass or combinations of these in duet quartette chorus or opera The painter from thumb sketch to the decoration of a palace the sculptor from an ivory netsuke to a granite quadriga the architect from a log cabin to a State house all these have space to dream in and the choice of a thousand modes But the poet his domain was rigidly bounded by the ancients and therein must he follow appointed paths Epic tragedy comedy ode ballad lyric these he must serve up in proper blank verse or rhyme according to established forms and measures And woe be to him if he break through hedges and try to sprint for the wilds  No as men release themselves from materialism and demand more and more from the arts the arts must become more immediately responsive their forms more fluid Poetry especially can not wear the corsets or even the chlamys of an elder fashion As Burton Roscoe put it in the Chicago Tribune  Poetry is a succession of revitalizations the introduction of novelty in an effort to escape anaemia from the odic modifications of Horace to the invention of rhyme to the displacement of Pope s couplets to the breaking of the tenuous and unwieldy alexandrine by Hugo to its further splintering by Verlaine to the eruption of Whitman and to the forms of the present day  Granted that much of the new poetry is bad that it is unmusical that it is graced neither by emotion nor by beauty that it will perish in the oblivion that claims all bad stuff and even much   What Next  that is good What of it The same is quite as true of poetry in the older established forms Shall we who listen eagerly to Prokofieff refuse to Wallace Stevens a hearing for his subtle and haunting compositions as if with wood wind instruments in the present number rhythms as heavy with tragic beauty as a bee with the honey of purple roses Shall we disdain Emanuel Carnevali s splashing rhapsody of last month because it isn t a sonata nor yet a proper Miltonic ode Shall not Vachel Lindsay play the organ or even a jaz band at his pleasure and is it for us to prescribe for him the harp or the flute Hasn t Amy Lowell as much right as Bach to write a fugue of tumbling rhymes and elaborate interwoven harmonies And shall Ezra Pound composing nocturnes and fantasias as delicate as Chopin s be reminded that the public prefers Strauss waltzes Should Carl Sandburg with a modern piano under his fingers be restricted to Mozart s spinnet May not Cloyd Head assail the Shakespearian tradition even as Debussy assailed the Beethoven tradition with modern tragedies as close in texture and as mystically expressive of our innermost feeling and dream as the Frenchman s L Après midi d un Faune And shall Edgar Lee Masters who of all our modern poets has the most epic vision shall he be denied free symphonic range within his large horizon even though staccato poets and careful critics object to his smashing paces  One might pursue the analogy further Is it a violin of finest quality that H D plays Is Richard Aldington s Choricos sung from some high place to the thrilling notes of   a harp Does Carlos Williams prefer piccolo solos with whimsical twists and turns of half humorous melody Does  H L Davis breathe through the wood winds music of a mournful mysterious Brahms like beauty If Edna Millay sings to the lyre and Sara Teasdale to the lute must we be deaf to the delicately emotional lyric solos played on a reed by such younglings as Mark Turbyfill or A Y Winters tunes of thistle down texture And shall the full poetic orchestra of the future be confined to the instruments and the melodic methods of Elizabeth s time or Queen Anne s or Victoria s or even of all three  Yes we might pursue the analogy into wearisome detail but enough has been said to present our point which is that the poetry of the future must have more freedom instead of less and that if the public is less tolerant of new methods in poetry than in music painting or sculpture it is because it is less educated in modern poetry than in the other modern arts less educated and more obstinately prejudiced When Leo Ornstein plays at a modern symphony concert he confronts an audience which has been carefully led up to his iconoclasms through years of the most expert music both classical and modern He gets intelligent sympathy from a large proportion of that audience and the praise or dispraise they give him is based on knowledge But when Wallace Stevens or Cloyd Head or H L Davis faces a modern poetry audience most of his readers are as full of the past as the Quarterly Review was in the time of Keats as firm for aesthetic canons and sanctities    What Next  The public we protest should educate itself in this art and be less cock sure in its verdicts To have read Hiawatha in the eighth grade does not make a competent connoisseur and one may not turn down the imagists because one can t scan them in finger counted iambics Poetry may be on the way toward as great variety as modern music enjoys whether in the number length and placing of notes syllables in the bar the foot in variety of rhythmic phrasing in tempo from andante to scherzo in movement from staccato to legato in tone color timbre and the countless other refinements which should make poetry like music infinitely expressive of the emotional life of our age Music is a much younger art than poetry yet in a few centuries it has gone far beyond poetry in the development and recording of rhythms Music has had the two advantages of a universal language and a scientific system of putting on paper tune pitch rhythm tempo and all other details required for complete presentation whereas poetry has been hampered by language isolation and by an antiquated system of metrics a mediaeval survival in this scientific age as empirical and misleading as astrology Professor Patterson of Columbia is almost the first investigator to make a scientific study of speech rhythms and it may be reasonably hoped that such work as his will aid the poet of the future to study the past with more knowledge to rid himself of hampering and artificial restrictions and to discover new possibilities of beauty in his art   Indeed we may look forward with some confidence to a widening of its range Poetry is like to be recognized more generally as a vocal art and to be used much more than formerly in connection with music and the dance both lyrically and dramatically In spite of postponements and disappointments one may hope for a proud future perhaps an almost immediate future for the poetic drama And this if it comes will bring poetry into close connection with the sister arts of color whether in pigments lights or costumes and modelling whether of sculpturesque or architectural forms as well as the dance and music It is more than probable that some poetic plays of the future will be produced with more or less static mimes or even with puppets for the pitiful incongruities of life whether for tragedy or comedy can be very appealingly suggested through such a conventionalization of the actor  Thus there would seem to be good reason to hope for a richer period in the not distant future of poetic art in America If much has been gained during the last seven years we have reached merely a new viewpoint toward wider horizons No art is static it must go on or retreat The poets must make the art more necessary to the people a more immediate and spontaneous expression of their life their dream A people imaginatively creative enough to invent a telephone an airplane to build great bridges and skyscraper towers is full of the spirit of poetry the poets have only to set it free H M   That Bookshelf  THAT BOOKSHELF  There has been much talk about the book shelf of modern poetry which Miss Lowell has made up for Doubleday Page amp Co Of course the omissions stir up the critics more than the inclusions and Llewellyn Jones of the Chicago Evening Post lists thirty two neglected names  Well any definitive list is like to be a joke to the next age so each of us should imitate Miss Lowell s and Mr Jones hardihood by making up his own shelf of modern poets and should then prove too eager a reader to keep the volumes shelved Miss Lowell s list is somewhat narrowed by its intentional direct reference to the present American market volumes out of print or unpublished in this country being excluded Thus since its first appearance the names of Eunice Tietjens and Adelaide Crapsey have been added because of new editions of their books Also the list being made up no doubt not for the use of specialists but to help create a larger public for modern poetry must be regarded as non controversial as omitting certain names certain volumes which would be too strong in one way or another for libraries or other purchasers  Perhaps one should pause first to question that unlucky adjective definitive surely more than Miss Lowell bargained for which has been tagged to the list by enthusiastic advertisers and taken up by purveyors of literary news And this ticketing adjective is symptomatic of the advertising effort which is being made to standardize the taste of a single   individual among the libraries and other purchasers and thus impose it on the public The American tendency to get together and accept things ready made however convenient in business affairs and economical of human brains is hardly fortunate in aesthetics And in the case of this list it works injustice to certain poets who are unmentioned and others who are over emphasized as well as to the readers of poetry who should make up their own minds  Let us see how far we agree with it The omission of Yeats and Hardy may be passed over because the list is hardly intended to stress names so important and long established Of the more modern moderns the most conspicuous omission is of course Ezra Pound the list minus his name may not be quite Hamlet without Hamlet but it is obviously and curiously incomplete If POETRY were to make a book shelf Pound s books would surely be on it also Hueffer s On Heaven Eliot s Prufrock Kreymborg s Plays for Poem mimes and also Mushrooms Carlos Williams Al Que Quiere one or two of Arthur Ficke s volumes Edith Wyatt s Wind in the Corn and Tagore s Gitanjali and The Gardener not to speak of the editors own dearly beloved books and unless the shelf were very short we should find space for certain small volumes by Frederic Manning Robert Nichols Harold Monro and Edward Thomas all the above except possibly Messrs Eliot and Monro having been published in America And we should have to make an impromptu sheaf of as many of Wallace Stevens poems as we could collect from POETRY   That Bookshelf  and a few other magazines a fact which leads to the admission that POETRY S fourteen volumes constitute in themselves a very good bookshelf of modern poetry  It will be observed that our list of omissions is not so long as Mr Jones and Miss Lowell may feel that she has partly atoned for some of them by including The New Poetry which contains certain poems by most of the omitted Mr Jones would place a number of British poets on his shelf Abercrombie Bottomley Davies Flecker Flint Hewlett and ten or twelve others some of whom except for Georgian Verse have not been published in America but we rather agree with Miss Lowell that their volumes are not indispensable on a distinctively and representatively modern shelf  So much for Miss Lowell s omissions As for her inclu  sions we are mostly with her However POETRY S shelf  could get along without Louis Untermeyer s books of verse  and without Bradley s Old Christmas Drinkwater s Poems  Oppenheim s War and Laughter Willard Wattles Lan  terns in Gethsemane and it would certainly substitute  Lowes Convention and Revolt for Professor Phelps ami  ably incompetent volume Also we should include only  the earlier two of the three books each accorded to John  Gould Fletcher and Witter Bynner we should choose more  closely among Gibson s Collected Poems we should add  Lindsay s first book and Masters latest one to the two  accorded to them and we should prefer Margaret Widde  mer s first book Factories to her prize winner   But today s list will be too easily shattered tomorrow for us to set it up in cold type Already certain voices seem to be fading into the distance and new ones are sounding ahead of us Poetry it is a perfume wafted from fields beyond us H M  REVIEWS  RECENT FRENCH POETRY  Europe by Jules Romains Nouvelle Revue Française Le Secret by André Spire Nouvelle Revue Française La Vierge et les Sonnets by Francis Jammes Mercure de France Les Enchanteurs by Paul Fort Mercure de France Barbe Bleue Jeanne d Arc et Mes Amours by Paul Fort Chansons à la Gauloise by Paul Fort Fas quelle After a long period during which the production of books  in France was severely restricted and the subject of those published was almost exclusively war Paris has again begun to issue works which are of literary rather than of topical interest It is safe to say that never before has nationalism so possessed a nation never before has everything every effort not concentrated on the one object of national defence been so severely discountenanced as in France during the past years Literature has tried to make some show and books not on the war have been published but the public mind was so obsessed by this one subject that hardly anything else was thought of The greatest popular literary   Recent French Poetry  success of the last five years Henri Barbusse s Le Feu was purely a war book Georges Duhamel has already protested against this fashion asking plaintively how many more poets are going to tell him that the line ran from Switzerland to the sea The same phenomenon occurred in England where an incredible number of books of war poems fell still born from the press  But the war is too big a thing to be shelved Duhamel himself has written three books about it and in a recent manifesto the writers of La Nouvelle Revue Française protested against any dillettante ignoring of the problems of war So it will be found that even the finest minds in France are still pre occupied with this subject and if they protest it is against a misuse an exploitation for cheap or trivial purposes of the calamity All the books of poetry published during the armistice period and here noticed will be found to be affected by the war in varying degrees  M Romains Europe was first issued in 1916 in a very limited edition so that this second publication is for all practical purposes the first He has written a reflective rather aloof sort of book yet a book full of emotional pleading He is against war he is passionately against war so much so that he seems to take its existence as almost a personal affront He is emphatically free from that dangerous and rather contemptible passion civilian war fever and he has not the resentment and detailed knowledge of a soldier like Barbusse or of a military doctor like Duhamel He writes as a civilized spectator raising an unheeded voice   in protest like an old lady in a street fight It is curious as one critic has acutely remarked that of all the groups which offer themselves to the Unanimiste poet the nation has been most neglected by M Romains Is it an accident or choice One would have thought that the psychology and passions of a nation at war would have given an Unanimiste a singularly rich subject M Romains has chosen not the small coherent group France but the large conflicting group Europe The choice is significant  It cannot be denied that M Romains has written a fine book without clap trap and sentimentality and egoism a book which though difficult and subtle escapes the deadly vice of declamation which is the cardinal fault of so much modern French writing Rhetoric stupid cold rhetoric is as much a danger to French poets as decorative adjectives and pomposity are the dangers of the Shakespearean tradition of English poetry Europe is not a book for an ardent militarist but it is a book admired by soldiers who have returned from hell a little disillusioned by the experience  Je témoigne que le soldat Qui vient de reposer son verre Ne veut pas entrer dans la gare Ne veut pas monter dans le train  It ne veut pas qu un wagon morne Le bouscule toute la nuit II ne veut pas qu on le réveille Sous un hangar plein de caissons  Il ne veut pas d un tas de paille  Dans la masure bombardée  Ni de l encoignure de glaise  Qui se dérobe sous les reins   Recent French Poetry  Il n a ni haine ni courage Et pas une bribe de joie Bien qu il ait bu dès le matin L ivresse lui est refusée  Ce qu il veut à en défaillir A s en laisser crouler par terre C est être chez lui ce soir même Chez lui dans la pièce du fond  M Spire s Le Secret is less didactic in purpose and much less of the war than Europe a large portion of it having been written before August 1914 This book which contains many delicate little poems that might be called imagist and some bitter war poems is a good example of what poetry generally has gained and lost by the war M Spire has lost gaiety a warm sense of life delight in beauty he has gained energy harshness cynicism Like many other poets he is tending towards satire The poetry of the next decade will very largely be satirical There is a disgust a disillusion in Europe generally significant and terrible any art which is disinterested which seeks only to create beauty is doomed to meet indifference if not hostility  M Spire is a poet of great talent and his work is being slowly recognized in France He works quietly he has none of those tricks of literary strategy which secure the momentary interest of a large public continuously yearning for the latest stunt he has produced a body of fine careful poetry which will outlast many more clamorous works This is a short specimen of his pre war manner  Volupté de regarder le soir  Couvrir de velours prunelle  Les batailles du cap et de la mer   Volupté de contempler la nuit Et dans ses clignotantes lumières De voir rire les yeux d un enfant  Volupté de penser volupté de parler Parfois de ne pas dire tout ce qu on pourrait dire D avoir dans son c ur plus d un coin secret  This is his later manner  On tue on assassine Ce n est pas ton affaire crois tu Pense à ta petite besogne Et fais y ton gain si tu peux  Cache nez chandails chaussures Piles de poches bougeoirs de tranchées Chaussettes plastrons couvertures Savon en tubes alcool solide Voilà ton petit domaine Fais y ton gain si tu peux Calcule calcule juste Un gramme un centimètre un centime De plus ou de moins change tout  Tes fils tuent on les assassine Fais y ton gain si tu peux  The difference needs no insistence Speaking personally I hope that M Spire will not proceed with satire though as things are it seems fairly hopeless to desire a return to his former and more happy style  Readers of POETRY will be familiar with the name of Francis Jammes He has been praised for a certain simplicity of style and freedom from rhetoric Books like Le Triomphe de la Vie and De l Angélus de l Aube à l Angélus du Soir were admirable as pictures of life M Jammes was a poet who could be realistic without being either dry or   Recent French Poetry  slap dash The was is significant in recent years he has become more and more absorbed in religion his realism tends to the vapid his simplicity seems artificial his emotion has slipped imperceptibly into sentimentality M Jammes can still write the English speaking countries have no poet of his calibre in his genre But whether one is brutalized by the war or tired of his repetitions or whatever cause he now appears singularly lacking in charm and éclat La Vierge et les Sonnets has had a fairly large sale four or five editions but there is no life in it as in the earlier Jammes The following sonnet is a fairly average specimen neither better nor worse than a score of others  C est Dieu que j invoquais sur ma flûte rustique  It est venu par le doux chemin villageois  Ainsi qu un laboureur tout au long d un pavois  De campanule et d angélique  Il est venu par le blé mûr des catholiques  Les perdrix les enfants le rappelaient à la fois  Les joubarbes faisaient aux descentes des toits  Des sculptures de basilique  Au dessus des fronts ceints de neige et de douceur On lisait tout en or sur la pauvre bannière O mon fils donne moi ton c ur  Et voyant ruisseler ces mots dans la lumière Je répondais comme en silence font les fleurs Donnez moi votre c ur O Père  Last on the list come three books by the indefatigable Paul Fort M Fort is probably one of the best known of living French poets It is certain that he has written some good books among which Le Roman de Louis XI   wears better than any But these last three books are rather a disappointment The poet seems to be tired as if he were forcing himself to write He produces in such quantities that the reader grows fatigued and bewildered Three books in a year twenty five books in twenty years rather an overpowering output So many of these recent poems are merely pleasant words so few are really stirring none have any evidences of immortality There is no need for quotation Everyone has read something of Paul Fort well he has just done the same thing over again  This review although concerned only with acknowledged writers will probably seem pessimistic André Spire s prewar poems seem to me the best of the lot the rest are all distraits weary without energy These men have nothing new to say and the war seems to have brought them only disillusion and bitterness What the next months will bring from France one cannot tell but in spite of many signs of activity there appears to be little worthy of the tradition of French literature Richard Aldington  BENÉT AND THE ZODIAC  The Burglar of the Zodiac by William Rose Benét Yale  University Press  Among American poets Mr Benét has a genre all his own he is a prestidigitator making magic with unfailing precision and adroitness His readers sit in the audience immensely entertained pretending as docilely as a child that   Benêt and the Zodiac  the show going on before them is not play acting but reality And just as the prestidigitator s magic of cards and mirrors and colored veils is symbolic of the huge inexplicable magic of the universe so one may infer large meanings tragic dignities behind this poet s tossing of balls and waving of gay colored scarfs  He knows there are dark pits and flashing heights but he does not dare look into them for that way madness lies Blake was mad they say he confesses  I they say am sane but no key of mine unlocks One lock of one gate wherethrough heaven s glory is freed And I stand and hold my breath daylong yearlong Out of comfort and easy dreaming evermore starting awake Yearning beyond all sanity for some echo of that Song Of Songs that was sung to the soul of the madman Blake  Comfort and easy dreaming that is what one finds  in this book in all Mr Benet s books It is  A wraith like script that curiously Seemed to write Romance when its seething glitter ate Into the dark  The book writes Romance on everything on the quick lunch counter the movies cowboy riders city smoke skyscrapers Sunday holidays it ties them up to Haroun al Raschid Pegasus Jaldabaoth and all the other creatures of dream who of course are not more wildly incredible Rarely does the poet stop to think or even to question why should he when just ahead  I ll open my eyes on a flashing horn And see the Unicorn   He even scorns his cynic neighbor at the movies who cold to these obvious heart throbs of the crowd rages at them and  Their maudlin mess of hopes and fears Blind to all proud insurgent art And the subtle nobilities of the heart  The poet answers  Here is the pith of all budded theme Man s glamorous fundamental dream  Not quite man s fundamental dream is revealed in this book Whatever the poet suspects in regard to the voyage he is content to stay safely ashore and send out paper boats But some of these are iridescent in the sunlight and sail away bravely The Singing Skyscrapers should be quoted entire for although New York is gathering a large anthology this poem is the most spectacular tribute of all to  The city that is Heaven The city that is Hell  The poet hears them all singing the Flatiron the Metropolitan the Singer Building the Woolworth tower  Ninevah they sang New York they sang In surcoats of stone Like huge knights at vigil Each alone Sealed with the sigil Of the glories of the Throne That wakes this Memnonian Music eternal In the clay and the compost The steel the stone   Benêt and the Zodiae  Probably this poem was written before the erection of the most beautiful tower in New York that of the Bush Terminal Building on West Forty first street But that deserves a poem all its own and Carl Sandburg let us whisper the news has written it  As the burglar of the zodiac Mr Benêt has made a rattling good haul H M  CLEMENT WOOD S NEW BOOK  The Earth Turns South by Clement Wood E P Dutton  amp Co  Mr Wood s poetry is never fierce though the paper wrapper of the book proclaims him fiercely fond of this blossoming earth of ours His is a placid and reflective muse pleasant philosophical sometimes prosy but never violent He is an optimistic poet a gentleman and scholar not one of those haunted souls who are so bewitched by beauty and mystery that they are like to die of it The Earth Turns South makes a varied offering of love poems nature poems philosophical poems and some for which I can find no other adjective than cosmic These are the slowest reading There are some charming lyrics and I find Mr Wood at his best when he sings simple songs in rhyme He has a delicacy of feeling fitted for such expression but his emotion is spread too thin when it covers the entire astronomical universe It was startling to find so enchanting a love poem as The Silver Way hidden among so many poems which though dignified and thoughtful are hardly stimulat   ing It is too long to print entire so I quote only the last part of it  Silent you sleep The black womb of the sky Aches to push forth its silver child  I am the thin sickle edge of light Cleaving the darkness to you  I am the round silver eye Rapt with your helpless beauty  I am the golden arms stretched down From the late low moon Lifting you  It is the darkness And we are one  The Negro poems are excellently done Besides the faithful transcription of the dialect there is a keen knowledge of Negro psychology But they are not as imaginative as Lindsay nevertheless There is very little of the provocative in Mr Wood s art Though there is no doubt in anyone s mind after reading the book that he does love earth he doesn t make his feeling sing for us There is frequently an infelicity of expression and not enough steam up to carry us over the jounce We stop discomfited  The book is the expression of a contented and happy spirit sometimes seeking but always finding a solution  Pass on up spiraling earth What seeds you have you will bring to fruitage O lonely grey misted wanderer Warmed by the dying glow of the sun Steered and steering to the hidden next of things   Clement Wood s New Book  With this stanza Mr Wood brings his book to a close It would be cruel to wish that he should experience sorrow or tragic bewildering perplexity yet from calm certitude or willing quiescence such as his no great poetry can be born Marjorie Allen Seiffert  WHEAT AND CHAFF  First Poems and Second Poems by Edwin Curran Pub  lished by the author Zanesville Ohio  Two years ago the first of these sheaves arrived reminding us of a poem by its author which POETRY had printed Unfortunately the thin pamphlet disappeared and an order for another brought no result so it was left to Louis Untermeyer to say the first word of praise Now the coming of a second sheaf and the resurrection of the first enables us to offer a long delayed welcome to a poet of promise  The welcome is not easily phrased because the poet is so incredibly crude because the second sheaf like the first contains utterly conscienceless banalities which the author of certain fine passages should be incapable of Apparently he is too isolated or too self willed to accept training or to discipline himself and thus it is doubtful whether he will ever hammer out a serviceable technique or learn certain first principles of poetic art Here is a quatrain one of many which are quite unworthy of a ten year old child  The world is safe at last for peace Safe upon the land and seas Safe for love and dreams and arts Praised by God from all our hearts   Yet this mars a Victory Song which has some swinging lines  these about guns for example  Their great tongues sleep And they bay no more In the chase or leap To the hunt of war  Hardly a poem in either pamphlet runs to the end with  out tripping though many contain passages one would like  to save from the rest Like this from Autumn  What grief what crying of the dead Has brought this sorrow on the world  A Cemetery in France from the second volume has  passages of vivid beauty and asks less blue pencilling than  most of the poems We quote over half of it  Dawn takes the everlasting skies And shoulders out the stars and eyes Of night are closed and dreaming The sunbeams gallop gleaming Upon the wings of the morning Light Has set upon the hills its white And beautiful wonder There is peace Among a thousand silences  Winds pace in the clouds and the dew Is dripping over the edge of the blue From off the eaves of heaven Deep Are the woodland shadows where they sleep Against the lily and the rose And fair is the meadow where blows The star flowers Love has found The shadows that lie under the ground A hill tips to the sky with its dead A slope of crosses in marching silver stairs That walk to the heaven in snowy pairs And step off into the blue overhead   Wheat and Chaff  They hear the sweet high voice of the sky Sing the west wind and the golden mirth Of soft rain when the fourth month with a cry Puts its great heart down against the earth  Here Laughter combs back her radiant hair And Love has tossed her music high Fair Beauty dreams near but what to these Is all the wonder of eternities For they know not and dream but less Lost in their darkling wilderness  Let them sleep They love us We love them It is enough that they have fought and died Their glory is their monument above them They are at peace and satisfied  This poem is the best and the least marred that Mr  Curran has done as yet Much may be hoped of a young  man who can achieve its quality and melody H M  A YOUNG LONDON POET  Linnets in the Slums by Marion Pryce B H Blackwell Oxford Longmans Green amp Co New York I hope Marion Pryce is young for her book contains the  promise of future achievement rather than assured poetry So many influences seem at work here that the authentic voice of the poet is only felt as an expiring breath overlaid with outside influences Yet the book is of much interest in showing that contemporary verse may be as formative to the youthful poet as the usual classical foundation without which it is assumed no poetry can possibly be written   I do not of course mean that Miss Pryce has ignored the past but the vitality of her stuff where it occurs seems to me to be due more to modern than classical influences Though still retaining conventional forms save in rare instances reminiscences of Browning Aldington and the Georgians occur constantly and between and around such recurrences but hardly definite as yet the voice of the poet is audible  Out of the usual somewhat mediocre mélange of the average first book emerge The Yellow Trees The Lemur Love Swallow and The Landlady and from these one may with almost assured certainty predict for the poet a place among the major minor poets of her time Love Swallow is quite as good as some things in the Georgian Anthology and those not the most trivial while The Landlady developed as a veine and tightened up would certainly put the new school on her track It is of course entirely absurd to predict in so uncertain an art as poetry but given the necessary application and the eternal tightening Miss Pryce must make her mark John Rodker  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  POETRY AND DRAMA REDIVIVUS  It is a pleasure to welcome The Monthly Chapbook a new series of Poetry and Drama the English quarterly which was obliged to
