MUSICIANS begin unfolding and folding a black clothThe FIRST MUSICIAN comes forward to the front of the stageat the centreHe holds the cloth before himThe other two come one on either side and unfold

beside the cotWhen old Jenny shook it the wooden rings rattled on the pole and grey men with pointed heads and squatbulging bodies came out of the folds on to the flat green groundIf you looked at them they turned into squab faces smeared with greenEvery nightwhen Jenny had gone away with the doll and the donkeyyou hunched up the blanket and the stiff white counterpane to hide the curtainand you played with the knob in the greenpainted iron railing of the cotIt stuck out close to your facewinking and grinning at you in a friendly wayYou poked it till it left off and turned grey and went back into the railingThen you had to feel for it with your fingerIt fitted the hollow of your hand cool and hardwith a blunt nose that pushed agreeably into the palmIn the dark you could go tip finger along the slenderlashing flourishes of the ironworkBy stretching your arm out tight you could reach the curlykew at the endThe shortsteep flourish took you to the top of the railing and on behind your headThe Little Review 15 Tip fingering backwards that way you got into the grey lane where the prickly stones were and the hedge of little biting treesWhen the door in the hedge opened you saw the man in the nightshirtHe had only half a faceFrom his nose and his cheekbones downwards his beard hung straight like a dark clothYou opened your mouthbut before you could scream you were back in the cotthe room was lightthe green knob winked and grinned at you from the railingand behind the curtain Papa and Mamma were lying in the big bedOne night she came back out of the lane as the door in the hedge was openingThe man stood in the room by the washstandscratching his long thighHe was turned slantwise from the nightlight on the washstand so that it showed his yellowish skin under the lifted shirtThe white half face hung by itself on the darknessWhen he left off scratching and moved towards the cot she screamedMamma took her into the big bedShe curled up there under the shelter of the raised hip and shoulderMamma s face was dry and warm and smelt sweet like Jenny s powder puffMamma s mouth moved over the wet cheeksnipping her tearsHer cry changed to a whimper and a softebbing sobMamma s breasta smoothcoolround thing that hung to your hands and slipped from them when they tried to hold itYou could feel the little ridges of the stiff nipple as your finger pushed it back into the breastHer sobs shook in her throat and ceased suddenlyIIThe big white globes hung in a ring above the dinner tableAt firstwhen she came into the roomcarried high in Jenny s armsshe could see nothing but the hangingshining globesEach had a light inside it that made it shineMamma was sitting at the far end of the tableHer face and neck shone white above the pile of oranges on the dark blue dishShe was dipping her fingers in a dark blue glass bowlWhen Mary saw her she strained towards herleaning dangerously out of Jenny s armsOld Jenny said Tchit tchit and made her arms tight and hardand put her on Papa s kneePapa sat upbroad and tall above the tableall by himselfThe Little Review He was dressed in blackOne long brown beard hung down in front of him and one short beard covered his mouthYou knew he was smiling because his cheeks swelled high up his face so that his eyes were squeezed into the narrowshining slitsWhen they came out again you saw scarlet specks and smears in their cornersPapa s big white hand was on the tableholding a glass filled with some red stuff that was both dark and shiningand had a queersharp smell Porty worty winey piney said PapaThe same queersharp smell came from between his two beards when he spokeMark was sitting up beside Mamma a long way offShe could see them looking at each otherRoddy and Dank were with themThey were making flowers out of orange peel and floating them in the finger bowlsMamma s fingers were blue and sharppointed in the water behind the dark blue glass of her bowlThe floating orange peel flowers were blueShe could see Mamma smiling as she stirred them about the tips of her blue fingersHer under lip pouted and shookShe didn t want to sit by herself on Papa s kneeShe wanted to sit in Mamma s lap beside MarkShe wanted Mark to make orange peel flowers for herShe wanted Mamma to look down at her and smilePapa was spreading butter on biscuit and powdered sugar on the butter Sugary Buttery Bippery said PapaShe shook her head I want to go to MammaI want to go to Mark She pushed away the biscuit NoNoMamma give MaryMark give MaryDrinky winky said PapaHe put his glass to her shaking mouthShe turned her head awayand he took it between bis thumb and finger and turned it back againHer neck moved stifflyHer head felt small and brittle under the weight and pinch of the big handThe smell and the sourburning taste of the wine made her cry Don t tease BabyEmilius said Mamma I never tease anybody He lifted her upShe could feel her body swell and tighten under the bands and drawstrings of her clothesas she struggled The Little Review 17 and chokedstraining against the immense clamp of his armsWhen his wetred lips pushed out between his beards to kiss hershe kickedHer toes drummed against something stiff and thin that gave way and sprang out again with a cracking and popping soundHe put her on the floorShe stood there all by herselfcryingtill Mark came and took her by the hand Naughty BabyNaughty Mary said Mamma Don t kiss herMarkNoMamma He knelt on the floor beside her and smiled into her face and wiped it with his pocket handerchiefShe put out her mouth and kissed himand stopped crying Jenney must come Mamma said and take Mary awayNoMark take MaryLet the little beast take her said Papa If he does he shan t come back againDo you hear thatsir Mark said YesPapa They went out of the room hand in handHe carried her up stairs pick a backAs they went she rested her chin on the nape of his neck where his brown hair thinned off into shinygolden downIIIOld Jenny sat in the rocking chair by the fireguard in the nurseryShe wore a black net cap with purple rosettes above her earsYou could look through the black net and see the top of her head laid out in stripes of grey hair and pinky skinShe had a grey faceflattened and wide open like her eyesShe held it tilted slightly backwards out of your wayand seemed to be always staring at something just above your headJenny s face had tiny creases and crinkles all over itWhen you kissed it you could feel the loose flesh crumpling and sliding softly over the bonesThere was always about her a faint smell of sour milkNo use trying to talk to JennyShe was too tired to listenYou climbed on to her lap and stroked her faceand said Poor JennyDear JennyPoor Jenny Wee so tired and her face shut up and went to sleepHer broad flat nose droopedher eyelids droopedher long grey bands of hair droopedshe was like 18 The Little Review the white donkey that lived in the back lane and slept standing on three legswith his ears lying downMary loved Old Jenny next to Mamma and Markand she loved the white donkeyShe wondered why Jenny was always cross when you stroked her grey face and called herDonkey Jenny It was not as if she minded being strokedbecause when Mark or Dank did it her face woke up suddenly and smoothed out its creasesAnd when Roddy climbed up with his long legs into her lap she hugged him tight and rocked himsinging Mamma s songand called him her babyHe wasn tShe was the babyand while you were the baby you could sit in people s lapsBut Old Jenny didn t want her to be the babyThe nursery had shinyslippery yellow walls and a brown floorand a black hearthrug with a centre of brown and yellow flowersThe greyish chintz curtains were spotted with small brown leaves and crimson berriesThere were dark brown cupboards and chests of drawers and chairs that were brown frames for the yellow network of the caneSoft bits of you squeezed through the holes and came out on the other sideThat hurt and made a red pattern on you where you sat downThe tall green fire guard was a cageWhen Jenny poked the fire you peeped through and saw it fluttering insideIf you sat still you could sometimes hear it sayteck teck and sometimes the fire would fly out suddenly with a soft hissHigh above your head you could just see the gleaming edge of the brass rail Jenny where s yesterday and where s to morrow IVWhen you had run a thousand hundred times round the table you came to the blue houseIt stood behind Jenny s rocking chairwhere Jenny couldn t see itin a blue gardenThe walls and ceilings were bluethe doors and staircases were blueeverything in all the rooms was blueMary ran round and roundShe loved the padding of her feet on the floor and the sound of her sing song The pussies are bluethe beds are bluethe matches are blue and the mousetraps and all the litty mouses The Little Review 19 Mamma came in and looked at her as she ranShe stood in the was thereall in bluewith a blue capand Mark and Dank and Roddy were thereall in blueBut Papa was not allowed in the blue houseMama came in and looked at her as she ranShe stood in the doorway with her finger on her mouthand she was smilingHer brown hair was parted in two sleek bandslooped and puffed out softly round her earsand plaited in one plait that stood up on its edge above her foreheadShe wore a wide brown silk gown with falling sleeves Pretty Mamma said Mary In a blue dress vEvery morning Mark and Dank and Roddy knocked at Mamma s doorand if Papa was there he called out Go awayyou little beasts If he was not there she said Come indarlings and they climbed up the big bed into Papa s place and saidGood morningMamma When Papa was away the lifted curtain spread like a tent over Mary s cotshutting her in with MammaWhen he was there the drawn curtain hung straight down from the head of the bed to be continued Periosteum All the bones are covered with a very sensible membrane called the periosteumCheynerecorded in SamJohnson s dictionary On Reading Ezra Pound s Lustra At first I had the luscious feeling of a Rocky Ford cantaloupe But later I sensed the papery larva cells of the wasps nestLWKV 20 The Little ReviewEXILES A Discussion of James Joyce s Plays by John Rodker AGAIN in this play MrJoyce exploits that part of mind merging on the subconsciousThe drama is one of will versus instinctthe protagonist Richard Rowana writerThis particular psychological triangle is one of barely comprehended instinctsdesires for freedomequally undefined emotions that hardly crystallise before fading outInter action of thought and will is carried so close to this borderline that the reader fears continually lest he miss any implicationAnalysis digs continually deeperAt a certain moment it is lostMind will go no furtherPeople are built on no plan and since it is impossible at any moment to say that either will or instinct is dominantthe author lets the curtain fall finally on the hero s temporary surrender to bothRICHARDstill gazing at her and speaking as if to an absent personI have wounded my soul for you a deep Wound of doubt which can never be healedI can never knownever in this worldI do not wish to know or to believeI do not careIt is not in the darkness of belief that I desire youBut in restless living wounding doubtTo hold you by no bondseven of loveto be united with you in body and soulin utter nakednessfor this I longedAnd now I am tired for a while BerthaMy wound tires meThe play is particularly à proposEveryone talks of individual freedom Stirner is a name to conjure withthough unreadidentifying it in some obscure way with Women s SuffrageBut the issues are psychological and no spread of popular education will The four people who contribute to this discussion have not compared notes or talked over their differences of opinionThe discussion may be continued in the next humber Exilesis published by BWHuebschNew YorkThe Little Review 21 simplify themIn this case Rowan leaves his wife to do as she willShe naturally reviles him for leaving her without the prop of his decisionsAfter nine years of conjugal life she is unable to make up her mind as to whether she needs a loverIf in the end she does not sinit is because she uses her virginity as he his profligacyfor pride and humiliationI have read the play often but without arriving at whether it is an ultimate cowardice or love for her husband that keeps her faithfulTo Rowan detail of what has happened does not matterThe atmosphere of their communion would make a more treacherous betrayal than any carnal sideslipThat he can never knowHis anguish at the possible withholding from his wife of any instant of experience which might make her life more full may be interpreted as moal strength or cowardiceWhere it is his will demanding Bertha s freedomhe is diffidentbut instinct in him speaksfiercelyI told you that I wished you not to do anything false and secret against me against our friendshipagainst hernot to steal her from mecraftilysecretlymeanly in the darkin the night youRobertmy friendLooks away againin a lower voice That is what I must tell you tooBecause in the very core of my ignoble heart I longed to be betrayed by you and by her in the darkin the night secretlyutterlycraftilyBy you my best friend and by herI longed for that passionatelycrazilyignoblyto be dishonoured for ever in love and in lustto beTo be forever a shameful creature and to build up my soul again out of the ruins of its shame The play is very romanticpoetical in a manner rare among playsIt is as fervent as the Seagull of TchekhofIt was no small achievement of MrJoyce to have made dramatic such very pure cerebrationand that with a touch so delicate that no most intricate part of the mechanism has suffered by the inquisitionOne sees Ibsen ruining such a situation with coarse fingersTchekhof got his purity of apprehension from taking people by their instinctsJoyce has done the same thing with a differenceNot that his people have necessarily more brainsbut beyond instinct the brain ramifies into obscurer delicaciesThe implication of Exiles are so numerous each one subject for minute elucidation that only with great familiarity would a total impression be possibleTchekhof s subtleties are plain sailinginstinctively apparentso that for stage purposes he is the last word in effectivenessExiles will have however to 22 The Little Review become classical a repertory playseen often before any audience can be familiar with itIt is a play which though perfect as literaturemight easily lose significance on the stageit is too full of meatThe most accustomed stomachs only will avoid indigestionNevertheless a production should be full of interestNo manager willI fancycare to produce a play without a real suicideeven though it be adeath of the spiritthat drops the curtainbut a small theatreof which there are many in America and one or two in this countrymight easily gain a reputation for intelligence by its productionby Israel Solon Let me say at once that I was most painfully disappointed with James Joyce s ExilesMy disappointment was so keen because of what he might have achieved and came near achieving but failed to achieveHis merely good is not good enough where the great was so nearly within his reachWith that themethe author of the Portrait and Ulysses should have achieved nothing short of the sublimeNo poet since Sophocles has had so dramatic a vehicleIndeedI think Joyce s the more dramaticSophocles took for his theme the fate of a man incompletely born and who was therefore bound to rejoin his motherSophocles held that man strictly to his inheritanceAnd so vividly did he present his argument that to this day those of us who are doomed to love our own mothers are forced to accept his terrible but valid judgmentWe may fling a feeble fist at whatever gods we chooseescape our doom we can notJames Joyce in Exiles has taken for his dramatic vehicle the fate of two men who are in love with each other and who are at the same time excessively amenable to all social coercionBound by the letter of conventional morality more completely than most menthe disguises winked at by organised society and thereby made available to most men is not available to these two menThey will have nothing they may not have openlyDrawn to each other from within and held back from withoutthese two men are doomed to keep within sight of each other but beyond the reach of each otherTheeternal triangleof our conventional comedy is repulsive to these menHere is matter worthy of the very best that James Joyce has it within him to lendWhythendoes James Joyce fail to achieve that measure of greatness we have every right to expect of him and the theme he has chosenThe Little Review 23 I believe it is because he has failed to make his characters conscious of what fate has in store for themHad he made these men fully aware of what their lives held for themthe rôles fate meant them to playand hefurthermoremade them struggle valiantly against itthen if they had won in the end we should have had great comedyand if they lost we should have had sublime tragedyConsciousness would have made of them such responsible human beings as would have engaged our sympathies to the utmostwhereas unconsciousness has left them feeble victims blindly wallowing to no purposeAnd since it is unthinkable to me that the author of the Portrait and Ulysses could be lacking in moral courageI am forced to the conclusion that James Joyce was not himself aware of the matter of his playby Samuel ATannenbaumMDExiles will in all probability prove to be cavaire to the generalnot only because it is open to the obvious criticism that it is not true to lifebut because its subject mater is one that unconsciously stirs up the most passionate resistances of a reader unaccustomed to the most honest and deep searching self analysisTo the psychologist trained in psychoanalysison the contrarythe book will be agreeably welcome as an inspired contribution from the depths of an artist s soul to one of the most tabooed and falsified motives of human conductwe mean homosexualityIt is true that the reader unlearned in such mattersand perhaps the author toomay not be aware that this is the theme of the play and may look for it in vainOf coursethis is not all there is to the playjust as in a dream the main motive is overladen and disguised with other subsidiary motives and rationalizationsso is it in the drama before usThe comparison of Exileswith a dream may be carried much furtherEvery work of fiction is its creator s dreamthe more fictitiousthe more dream likethe more apparently absurd and unrealthe truer it is to the hidden forces in the maker s soul and the truer too to the generality of mankind for whose repressed springs of action the poet is the mouthpieceExiles very often reads like like a dream and must be interpreted as suchAs such it may be said to derive its motive power from the author s repressed but most urgent impulsesto emanate from the unconscious forces within him and to enable him to gratify in thisharmlessway his unacted and unactable long34 The Little Review ingsIn all thisit need hardly be saidthere is not the slightest reproach for or condemnation of the dramatistevery purely fictitious literary work is the self revelation of a burdened soul that saves itself from a neurosis or from a perversion by the cathartic effect of the creative processRichard Rowan sthe protagonist shomopsychism is never once referred to in the story but is clearly to be deduced from his character and conductHe has no love for his dead mother and several times refers bitterly to her hardness of heartat the same time crediting her with having been a remarkable womanof hishandsome father on the contraryhe always speaks with great affectionHe is utterly incapable of making love to a woman or of loving one unless she is or has been in love with a man to whom he is attachedfor this reason he connives at his life long friend sRobert Hand s wooing of his wife and urges hernaygoads her on to be unfaithful to himThe author subtly and delicate leads us to infer that Richard and Bertha are living a life of abstinence ever since his betrayal of her nine years before and that he gives her full freedom only that they might thus be reunitedSpeaking to Robert of the moment when he surprised him wooing Berthahe says At that moment I felt our whole life together in the pastand I longed to put my arm around your neck A little later he says to him In the very core of my ignoble heart I longed to be betrayed by you and by her in the darkin the night secretlymeanly craftilyBy youmy best friendand by herI longed for that passionately and ignobly Being asked why he did sohe replies From pride and from ignoble longingAnd from a deeper motive still From a psychological point of view it is importanttooto note that before Richard s marriage he and Robert had for years shared a house in the country as a rendez vous for erotic escapadesOf course Richard rationalizes his motives in his unconscious conflict with his latent passion I fear that I will reproach myself for having taken all for myself because I would not suffer her to give to another what was hers and not mine to givebecause I accepted from her her loyalty and made her life poorer in lovebut even the few sentences we have quoted prove the correctness of our deduction concerning himFully to comprehend this splendid portrait of a type of artistic soul that one meets often enough in real lifethough exiledit is necessary not to overlook Richard s intensely masochis The Little Review tic and voyeur impulsesHe delights in putting himself in situations that entail a great deal of anguish for himand he compels his wife to give him the fullest details of his friend s assaults upon her honorThat he can be cruel too on occasion is not at all surprisingby virtue of the law of bi polarity the masochist is also a sadistThe portraits of the Wifethe Friendthe Other Woman and even the Child are interesting characterizations that will repay careful studyThey are all intensely individualized and unquestionably human though not conventionalArchieaged eightis one of the few life like children to be found in literature and is introduced into the play very effectively perhaps because in portraying him the author was inspired by Shakespeare s Prince Mamillius to whom the little lad bears a strong resemblance Incidentally it may be remarked that The Winter s Tale is largely unintelligible if we fail to see the homopsychic conflict in it and do not recognize the erotic relationship between Leontes and PolixenesOthello s fate too might have been different had it not been for his unconscious love for CassiusMany of the minute details of this playsuch as Richard s slip of the tongue about his interest in Robert s cottageBeatrice s forgetting to bring her musicBertha s sudden attack of fear when Robert speaks to her from the bed roometc prove MrJoyce to be a fine psychologist and a keen observer of human natureBut his courage to be true and unconventionalcombined with the fact that his chief characters are neuroticexileswill we fear doom him to a small but select followingby jh I find it difficult to put any of my thoughts on Exiles into wordsThey are not used to wordsthey dieI feel that Joyce s play has died in wordsI do not mean because of the words literallyall Art is linguisticBut even Art must fail many times before it conquers those things whose nature it is to keep themselves a secret from us foreverOn the surface the play gives itself up to many interpretationsPropagandists declare it is a play on the freedom of the individualOther reviewers talk of triangles and Ibsen and neuroticsAll these things are easy and semi intelligent things to sayBut when it is 26 The Little Review unanimously agreed that Joyce hasn tput over his idea clearlyor that he hasn t known just what he was trying to put overI grow a bit nervous and wonder why it doesn t appear to them that perhaps Joyce couldn t reach their darknessI also wonder why not read Exiles with Joyce in mindThe man who wrote A Portrait of the Artist and Ulyssesa highly consciousover sensitized artist living at the vortexof modern psychologywould scarcely go back to dealing with material in a pre Nietzsche mannerJoyce is not Galsworthyon the other hand he is not D HLawrenceAnd to discuss courage in connection with Joyce is ridiculousJoyce outlived courage in some other incarnationThere are peoplea fewalways the artist I should saywho inspire such strong love in all who know them that these in turn become inspired by love for one anotherThe truth of the matter is that such a person is neither loved nor lover but in some way seems to be an incarnation of lovepossessing an eternal element and because of it a languora broodinga clairvoyance of life and a disdainIn other people he breeds a longing akin to the longing for immortalityThey do not love himthey become himRichard is one of theseThere is much talk of freedom in the playEveryone wanting everyone else to be freeit is shown that there is at no time any freedom for anyoneThe discussion of the wife s decision when she went away with Richard unasked by him proves she has no freedom to make a decisionShe may have been in love with Robertbut she had no choiceshe was RichardRobert is in love with Richardhas always beenbut he is an unthinkingnatural manHe follows nature with his brain and thinks he is in love with Richard s wifea woman being the conventional symbol for a man s loveBut when he has a meeting with her and they are left alone by Richard in perfect freedom they are foiledthey are both Richardboth trying to reach Richardnot each otherRichard s old conflict with his motherjust indicatedwas based on her refusal to become himThe wife sees the child going the way of all of themThere is no where in the world for Richard to turn for loveSex as other men know it can be for him only a boringdistasteful need Zurichof the bodyLove strikes back at him from every sourceHis beThe Little Review 27 comes a Midas tragedyHe is tormented by the commonplacebeaten pathlove making of Robert and his wifeHe asks her infinite questionshe directs the love making to save his sensibilitiesHe says to Robert Not like this this is not for people like us Yet he wishes darkly that they had dishonoured him in a commonsneaking wayNot that he cares for either of themnot that he cares for honour or for conventionsbut then he might have been free of themThey would have acted for once without his spirit having been the moving forceWe see Richard wearily contemplating his despairThere is much of the child in RichardHe has a need to create some hold on lifesome connection with the experiences of other menHe chooses the least uncomplimentary to himself of those in the play as the symbol through which he can make his connection with loveHe sees himself less handicapped intellectually in the music teacherso he loves love through herWhen they taunt him with her he answersNonot even she would understand He writes all night endless pages at this image of himselfand in the morning walks on the beach maddened by emptiness and despairAt the last curtain he falls on to a couchworn and helplessin need only of agreat sweet mother but he must be forever on the wheelhis wife kneels beside him babbling of her love ULYSSES James Joyce Episode VIII PINEAPPLE rocklemon

ballexcept the one or two given by her father s lodgean organization of old and orthodox JewsThey weren t really what you could call balls at allJoyless affairs they had beendevised merely to extract three dollars from each member in ways not provided by the constitution and by laws of the orderNowthis ball was to be a real swell affairAll the biggest swells fromthe Boulevard would be at that ballA whole lot of things had to be done first before she could dare to show her face at the ballBut what things were theyWhere could she find outTakefor instancethe very first thingthe dressWhat was she to do about itWhere would she find a dressmakerHow decide the stylethe kind and color of goodsthe trimmingsShe asked of every likely person that came into the shopbut they knew nothing themselves and only tried to guessand confused her the moreHow could she expect anybody on Maxwell Street to know what you had to do for a swell ballOf course she expected nothing from her old fashioned motherEsther felt irritated all the day at her workand was troubled in her sleep at nightBut it was her old fashioned mother proved of help after all Mind meEstherkin she said one morning You go to Mollie MandelShe will fix everything for you and you won t have to worry no more WhatHow was thatFor a moment Esther stood speechlessThen the color came into her face and her eyes glowed so that you never would have known it was the same EstherSo much she had worriedSo muchAnd all for nothing at allThat s the way things go sometimesYou got to have the bread knifeWhere did it get lostYou are sure you saw it only a little minute agoYou look and you look and you lookeverywhereGodomake somethingIt is as if the earth had opened up and swallowed itAll of a sudden thereYou are holding it in your The Little Review two handsAnd you are lucky when there is nobody around to laugh at youMollie Mandel did decide everythingas of course she could not help doing was the way Esther put it with all the things that woman knows and so good to everybody Mollie Mandela masterful femalewhose home is farthest from her sphereisneverthelessnot altogether wanting in tendernessbesides whichthe assertion of her mastery requires that she do things for othersIn her own wayof course The dressmaker she mockedamused at Esther s simplicity That is really a terrible worryDon t be such a sillyMy own modiste makes all the swellest gowns for all the ladies of the Boulevard Möllie Mandel then half closed her eyes and swept Esther up and down and acrossseveral timesIn the end she said definitely Dearyyou ll get an evening gown and a swell one A faint gasp escaped EstherShe did not know what a swell evening gown made by a Boulevard dressmaker meantIt sounded to her as if it must cost a terrible lot of moneyMollie Mandel got her at onceShe laid a bejeweled hand on Esther s shoulder in her most affectionate sales lady mannerbut she spoke in her don t let it happen again toneone word at a timethat it might sink in properly Listen to megirlyI m going to tell you somethingNever be afraid of spending moneyYour father will like you that much better for itThe more you cost the more he ll think of youAll men are like thatThey never know how good you are until they find out how much you cost Esther had never heard anyone talk like that beforeand she wondered what made Mollie talk like thatThat Mollie Mandel s words represented a way of seeing life and livinga practical philosophywas beyond EstherMollie Mandel saw thisand concluded that Esther s case was quite hopelesAs well go and bark at the moonfor all the good it is likely to do youBut to consume your liver because of it certainly did not payso she tilted her chin and said in a tired voice Wellwhat have you got to say now Esther could say nothingThat was precisely itBut it was not to have been expected that Mollie Mandel would feel thisor trouble herself because of itBut Esther s purpose was in the presThe Little Review 53 ent instance as well served by Mollie Mandel s need to be activeShe hustled Esther into the Mandel family s electric motor a solemndeliberatesumptuouspurple structurewith electric lights in the walls and roofand cut glass containers holding artificial flowers and before Esther had had time to become decently frightenedshe was hustled out againMollie Mandel exchanged some words with the dressmakerand Esther was made to turn around a number of timesand ordered to walk this way and that and back againMollie Mandel talked fastand the dressmaker kept saying OhyesQuite rightStunningSplendid In the meanwhileEsther was being measuredand became more and more bewilderedThen Mollie Mandel picked up her hand bag of real alligator skin with solid gold trimmingand motioned for Esther to follow herbut she halted and said to the dressmakerthis time quite distinctly Emerald green chiffon over burnt orange satinchiffon sleevesquarter lengthand V neckall right And the dressmaker replied YesMadame Mandel Esther was by now thoroughly frightenedShe saw herself at the ballArms bareShoulders bareUnder all those lightsThat might be all right for the girls of the BoulevardBut for Malkin the baker s daughtera Maxwell Street girlShe gave a quick look around the roomBut there was no one that might have come to her aidIn desperation Esther turned her head from side to side and cried hysterically Nonono Mollie Mandel almost lost patienceThere was ingratitude for youBut what could you expect My dear childYou just leave these things to me She spoke from her priviliged position as a lady of the Boulevard You ve been wearing things much too subdued for your age and style of beautyThat s why nobody noticed youYou can just depend on what I m telling youYou ve got to jump in their faces if you want people to notice you Esther had never before felt so utterly helplessIt was like trying to keep yourself from falling in a dreamMollie Mandel stepped back and looked Esther over criticallythen came up close and felt of Esther s person My she called out in her sweetest voice What nice fat shoulders you ve gotYou ain t got nothing to be ashamed ofyou 54 The Little Review little gooseDon t shake your head like a horseI know these things betterdeary Thenof a suddenshe seemed to have made an amazing discoveryand she shouted Whyjust look at your eyesBeau ti

m talking aboutYou ll seeOn the dancing floorThey ll fall over each otherWait till we get to that ballYou ll seeBut you got to do as I tell you And Mollie Mandel smiled a mellowknowing smileEsther stared at her bewilderedCould it be trueShe could not resist looking into the dressmaker s tall mirrorthough Mollie was watching herIt was so pleasant to believeshe could not resist itIt was like letting herself sink into sleep when she was tiredShe had to look into the mirror again and againYesshe did have beautiful eyes and hair Mollie MrsMandel Esther beganher eyes filling with tears You re so goodYou know so muchI don t know nobodyWhat could I do She had to stop or she would have burst out cryingand in a strange house NowEstherNever mind thatdear A strange thing had happenedMollie MandelWho had always been attracted only by brute ruggednessWho would have stopped to watch a man shaking rats out of a trap in the midst of trembling terriorsand would have enjoyed the sightbut who never noticed a fallen horse or a ragged fist ful of an old woman with a few pencils in a bony hand Mollie Mnadel was moved at the sight of Esther s dumb helplessnessmoved almost to the melting moodThe humor passed over her and was goneThe next moment she was her old self again and quite all rightShe said Just waitYour mother will catch it from meTo let you go around like thatButdon t you caredearyWait till we get to that ballThey ll fall over each otheryou ll see Esthersimpletimidploddng Estherwas fascinatedMollie Mandel had given her strange couragevaulting desiresWhy not she like so many of the othersWith such eyes and hairHer eyes quickenedher hair became neater and more attractiveThe Little Review 55 Her entire body caught the infection which showed itself in her every move and gestureThere was a new buoyncy in her stepA living purpose appeared in her faceMen got up in the street cars and offered her their seatsand even lifted their hats to herlike to a real ladyHer motheralsobecame more attentive Sit down a littleEstherkin she would say fetching a chair You been standing on your feet all the morning At another time she would say Go upstairs nowEstherand lay down a littleYou must be tired OrGo nowtake a little walkIt ll be good for youI ll lock up the shop myself And Here s a little present for youI see all the girls got it Or Here s a nice apple for youdaughterkinEat it to your good health However tired Esther felt at the end of the day s workshe would not go to bed now without trying on the ball dressThe dressthe mere thought of which had in the beginning frightened her soby the time she had tried it on half a dozen timesturned out to be really very niceShe practiced walking in front of her dresser mirrorHer shoulders maybe were a little too fullbut better anyhow as all boneslike some of the girlsShe had always fixed her hair in front and had never known that it could be made to look so swell in the back and sidesShe would now put up her hair and let it down againarranging it first one style and then anotherwithout being able to make up her mind which she liked herself best inThe new silver mesh bagwhich never should have left the bureau drawer except when going for a walk on Sabbath afternoonsshe carried about with her every day in the bake shopShe would let a customer wait when she wanted to look into the tiny mirrorThere were times now when Esther saw herself stepping along the leafy lanes of Douglas Parkor sitting on the rock at the edge of the lagoonor reclining in the bow of a row boatAnd always there was now a man beside herAt his touch a soft warmth would flush her bodyHis whole appearancehis voicewhat he said and didwere tender and considerateand he seemed able to understand her as if he were inside her own headBut she was never able to catch sight of himAlways he would disappear around the corner of her eye when she tried to get a look at himHe was t a bakershe knewHe was much granderHe was a gentlemanThen maybe there would pass before her eyes a flash no bigger than a tiny pinBut after that everything was changedShe would 56 The Little Review see herself back of the counters of her father s bake shop in Maxwell StreetShe would have to end her days like Rachel Kaplangray hairedsunken eyed and flat chestedThe day of the ball found Esther all atrembleThe weeks of preparationher constantly changing moodsWhen neither hope not fear would abidewere more than she could bear up underEstherwho had grown fat and strong through years of patient ploddingbecame pale and weak during the short period of her wrestling with the unknownIt was little help she was to her mother the day of the ballShe would let things slip from her handskept forgetting what she was aboutand had to be watched at making changeCould she dance good enoughWhat could she say to her swell partnerShe would maybe have to make a lot of smart talk and be funnyShe could only make a fool of herself and be laughed atShe would die of shameright there on the spotSilentlynervouslyall day her mother followed heron the verge of tears because of her helplessnessShe knew what troubled her daughterbut had no power to do anythingWasn t it a frightful thing to have to stand by and look on while your ownmore precious than the eye in your headwas sufferingand you able to do nothingIt was latebut she could not get herself to urge Estherto remind her how terribly necessary it was that she should look her best at the ballFinallyshe did manage to say Daughterkinyou got to hurry up a little and get dressed nowI got everything ready for you on the bed Praised be the Exalted OneWhat a relief that wasShe helped Esther to her roomtaking hold of her arm only to let go of it and run ahead a step or twothen returning to grasp at the arm againFrom time to time she would think of something to cheer her daughter withand of something to shield her against possible harm It ain t as if you didn t know nobody on the ballEstherkinMollie Mandel she will be there waiting for youand she can do a whole lot where she wants toI help you a little maybeyesIt will be quickerYou got to dance all the eveningand I got to do

BoulevardYesmotherWe got to move on the BoulevardNote onThe Dreaming of the BonesThis is the second play by MrWilliam Butler Yeats written in the manner of the Japanese Noh playsI think it is more successful than his play in the Noh formThe Hawk s Welland that in this play he has caught the spirit of the old Noh plays perfectlyThose who are familiar with Ezra Pound s extraordinarily beautiful rendering of the Noh playsbased upon the translations of Ernest Fennollosawill not need to be told how perfectly MrYeats has caught the spirit of the Noh plays in The Dreaming of the BonesTo those who are not familiar with the Noh playsa brief note on the Noh drama would be almost uselessButapart from the form of 62 The Little Review the playa few words giving the point of view from which it was written may not be amissThe Young Man of the play is typical of a large number of young Irishmen of todayWhen America comes to weigh Ireland s reasons for rejecting conscriptionthe belief of such young men should be rememberedSome years ago the then Speaker of the American House of RepresentativesHonorable Thomas BReedone day overheard one of his colleagues cursing another member because the memberwas so damned provincial Reed drawled out to his colleagueBut why curse him for his provincialityProvinciality is a factjust as the weather is a factand not something to be angry or to curse about So in the case of the Young Man in the playit is not a question of what he ought to believebut of what he does believeIt is a matter to understand and to weigh and to remember and not a matter merely to get angry aboutThis notable play maythereforebe regarded as a symbol of the ideas and ideals of a large number of young men in Ireland todayMy allusion to provinciality has no relation to the provinciality of the learned Irish judge who some years ago made the speech which has become so well known as a matter of Dublin folk lorecondemning the effortsthen only in their beginningto revive the Irish languageThe short speech of the great Irish orator John FTaylor in reply on that occasion is imbeddedlike a jewelin James Joyce s UlyssesEpisode VII the Little Review for October 1918pages 44 and 45 There the judge who argued against the revival of the Irish language showed himself to be the provincialBut whether an attitude or a movement or a refusal or a rejectionlike that of conscriptionis or is not provincialshouldit would seenbe determined by the times or the events existing at the time and not from the merely traditional point of viewOf course it is hot implied that everyone in Ireland is full of the notion that England has always been to Kathleen ni Houlihaun a kind of BluebeardThere are many other political points of view if Irelandbut this play represents an important point of viewThe Little Review is to be congratulated upon being able to publish this playfor it is full of the charm and unfailing distinction of William Butler Yeats at his bestAt a time when other magazines are full of reconstruction stuff and discussions of variouspseudo psychological solutions of businesseconomic and international probThe Little Review 63 lemsstuff thatwith all respectsounds like the vaporings of Mary Baker GEddy in international affairswith pseudo science and pseudo prophecy asthe key to the future the Little Review is lucky in being able to publish this

for that letter in the November numberYou can t continue to let any one rock the Little ReviewAnd EPhas for some time needed just such a cool and unperturbed hand to press him back into his seatIt isn t his knocking that waste of creativeand destructiveenergy is his look outAmerica s so easily abraded and so quickly healing skin needs all it can get of whip cutsnot of mud and rotten eggsAnd there s something about Pound s vituperations that savors of none too remote gutters and rival stalls and tongues akimbo and herrings obvious in a rising temperatureI ve sometimes felt like saying something like this out loud but I m frugaland then he s done lovely things and I admire his cold shining thin glass mind through which so many colors pass leaving no stain and then my stone arm balks at swinging in rhythm with the mob sOrrick JohnsStLouisI am not a very discriminating criticperhapsbut I depend upon the Little Review for a certain section of the eccentric joy existence gives meI especially liked Eliot s poetrywhich Marsden Hartley disapprovesPound is always readablebut not more always so than the pungent irritability ofjh Joyce s novel has one negligible chapter from the standpoint of my understandingbut absolutely beggars appreciation in other spotsFrom Hecht and Sherwood Anderson I derive awebut little responseOne is apt suddenly to be reminded one is reading nearly

sensuousness does not appeal to meand a striving for things so involved that no one can understand them does not mean literature to meWhen I compare the first year of the Little Review with the

should like to make just a note onThe Dance of Siva by Ananda Coomaraswamypublished by the Sunwise Turn I am always humble before any hint of the ancient civilization of the East Chinese or IndianThese people seem to have been able to make more use of being human beings than any other peoplesThere are fourteen essays in the bookmost of them dealing with Art and BeautyIn these essays DrCoomaraswamy has set forth suavely and graciously the findings of an ultimate civilization a civilization unrecognized and uncomprehended in this countryI wish sometimes when there is so much talk ofmaking the world a better place to live inand the general reconstruction of the universethat some care could be taken to indicate which worldIt must all seem very kindto the Orientalsbut rather unnecessayIt is difficult for a people without either knowledge or intuitions to keep any discriminations clearIt it quite the fashion now to jeer Tagore orwith Ezra Poundto sayGood old Tagore At the time MrTagore was in America every one who did not call him a negro either religionized him or wrote asking him to tell their fortunesIt is an inability to feel the particular quality and the essential difference in the unfamiliar which produces scoffing and denialDenial of an art or a civilization proves nothing There are many who never yet felt the beauty of Egyptian sculpture of Chinese or Indian painting or musicthat they have also the hardihood to deny their beautyhoweverproves nothing Certainly denial never can prove that we have anything better It is a little too easy to decide that our own is bestwe are at the most entitled to believe it is the best for us It is restful to find such unimpeachable precedent for some of one s most damned and hooted statementsMany of our view considered most wildly ex cathedra are calmly endorsed in this history of aestheticsFor instancebeauty is a stateand absolutea work of art is an outward sign that the artist has discovered the
