is behind the two central figures in each sceneThe dialogues occur in a little brightly lighted box at the front of the stageIt is a recess at the back of the Restaurantwhich is seen behind it in a perfectly square frame made by the limits of the recessThe box like recess is painted shiny white with large brass hooks to the left for the coatsIt is sanitarydoll like and conventionalFingal s sienna brown suitand Kemp s rather vivid blueunder the bright electric lightand Miss Godd s green jersey in 3rd sceneadd to the appearance of freshness and artificial bloomSCENE IMRJOHN FINGAL is

gentleman tres finalso as a beautiful young manthe memory of personal triumphs at Cambridge maintainedHe likes speaking FrenchHe does so with careful clumsiness and only so much attempt at a good accent as is compatible with dignity and comfortThe tables beyond in the body oj the Restaurant are occupiedby various peoplechiefly BelgiansJOHN PORTER KEMP comes in from street at far end of stageHe is talldog leanin first bloom of middle ageHe is a writerjournalism takes up most of his time Red haired people seem mongrels common to every country like womenKemp s is a shabby strong mixturegiving him rather a colonial entree into the civilised worldIt carries him backdown the agesin any casein an energetic ancestral trailwithout the interruptions you must always count on with colourless crops FINGAL looks up toward back of stageand with immediate concentration makes a sign to Kempand kicks the chair back on the other side of the tableFINGALHalloCome herehave lunch hereThe Little Review 3 KEMPGoodmorningWhat s the newsFINGALIn heredo you mean Fingal shakes the paper KEMPYes Kemp sits downHe does not prune himselfrub rub his cheeks or handsor stretch his eyelidsHe looks at Menu

ClubI went to the FigaroThey got it for meWhat a nice family that is over thereHow shiny their faces areThey really are nice greasy lumps Finga looks round at Belgian familysees what he expected after a minuteand laughsKemp turns back to the table KEMPI wish we were more like thatAt least I wish we had that air of being in a tavern they haveor just come out of a heavy bedroomlike immense dolls out of the box of an erotic gameThey don t mind dying as much as we dobecause their blood is the same oil as the Earth sWith them continuity is not so broken by demiseFINGALYOU are romancingKEMPOf course I m notLook at Cezanne s race and then look at usSee how much harder they work at getting their childrenTheir picturestooBut it doesn t show so much in our childrenFINGALDo theyI should have thought KEMPThey are much more like the tilings they eatThey all have a good deal of pighorse and dog in themThey yap and snort and their noses sniff and twitchFINGALDo you want to be like a pigThe Little Review 4 KEMPIt might imprvoe meI should be willing to try it They laugh with indulgence and digestive grace FINGALAre you doing much workI saw you were writing in the London Monthly the other dayI intended to get itKEMPYesThere s no reviewing nowduring the warI shall have to turn strategistI supposeI shall not make a good oneI can never make head or tail of what they re doing over thereFINGALAren t they going to begin to print other news again soonKEMPHeaven knows A duck and boiled potatoes and salifers arrive for Kempa bottle of TeinachFingal s are taken away The gargon is built compactly for body serviceHis eyesare round and blueand bring to mind Swiss Lakes and mean popular sentimentalitiesHe is your respectfulfriend and abject servantHe bends down and advises with a candour and carefulness that makes you turn your head awayHe stares into the distance when he is not busyThis is his menial cachet KEMPI wonder if any of these Belgians have been ruinedI expect it is chiefly the working people who have been done forFINGALI tried to get a Refugee the other day to come and work for meMy little servant girl is going awayI couldn t find one for love or moneyKEMPI suppose the poor ones get looked afterand drafted off as soon as they arrive A Peche Melba is brought for Fingal KEMPWhat is thatPeche MelbaI must have thatAlbertA Peche MelbaFINGALOur friend Radac here is pretty busyKEMPIf things become very bad I shall get Radac to take me on as gargonI should enjoy inducting food into those mouths A Peche Melba is brought to Kemp FINGALMiss Godd was here yesterdayKEMPWas sheBut damn Miss GoddFINGALDamn Miss GoddShe was here about twoJust after you d goneKEMPI knowI saw her last night Fingal smilesbut keeps temperately within that demonstrationMiss Godd is a mysteryFingal has The Little Review 5 not been asked to meet herHe does not know in what relation Miss Godd and Kemp stand to each otherHe sees them at the Restaurant gesticulating in the distanceKemp does not encourage communication on the subjectof his friendKemp exaggerates his appetiteNature with him substituted food for drink as a stimulantA little food is enoughHe has not a strong headRendered abnormally communicative and aggressive by the duck and other foodhis eye more and more often approaches Fingalwith a progressive ritual like that of a large flyAt last it settles full in the middle of his faceIn a few minutes he is grinning at himtalkingtwitching his great animal s nose as though it had been surrounded by Grauben gnats KEMPDO you sleep wellFINGALNot really wellI varyI sometimes sleep for eight hours right offsometimes only fourMy average is a bit below the necessaryI should say This punctilious answer was in order to save timeand was the result of experience of KempKemp and Fingall s talks resembled those arranged between the Proprietor of the Circus and the ClownFingal would display the meticulous credulity of the toff in evening dressKemp does not want to knowhoweverabout Fingal spowers of sleepIt is one of his feintsThis is his way ofworkingKEMPAre you sensitive about your shellFINGALNONOKEMPThe husk you shed at nightFINGALAhNo Kemp pulls his chair forward a little and leans across the tableHe constantly shoots his eye upwhile speakingat an imaginary third person in the middle distanceSometimes he fixes this myth with his blank red rimmed disk of an eyeand stops his discourseOr he will lower his voice as though to prevent this third person form overhearing his most harmless remarks KEM PLife for some people is full of the nuisance of symmetries and formsWhen you put your pen downdo you begin worrying about its position in relation to the inkpotFINGALI can t say I doKEMPSome people have a certain personal arrangement with their clothes at nightThis is very commonIfor myselfhave to tie my bootlaces symmetricallyHave you never stepped in every second or third stone of a pavementand been afflicted if you were compelled to miss oneI know a man who walked all the way back from Oxford Circus to Waring and Gillows to plant his foot on a stone he had been compelled to missFINGALThat is bad neurastheniaisn t itKEMPOf courseAnd therefore should be fought and broken up from time to timeFINGALI agree with you Kemp sits back in his chair as though his bolt were shotand the argument closedThis is more feinting and personal play of his high spiritsHe then comes forward again in his chair KEMPTruthat all eventsis a thing like thatOur truthfulnessSome people have an uneasiness and sense of something wrongout of placecrying to be put rightif they have been compelled or have elected to tell an untruthTher is something in such and such a person s mindplaced there by themthat should not be thereOr it should not be there in that formIt isthe thing which is notof the Horses Kemps draws a cigar out of his pocketcuts the end offand lights it KEMPThis meticulous sense will induce a man to describe very carefully something he has seenif he describe it at alland to suffer iffrom laziness or other motivehe has slurred or misrepresentedThis is the common base of wisdom and beautyIt is the famous generic madness at the bottom of geniusIt is the madness known asExactitudein America Kemp fixes Fingal with his eyeAncient Mariner fashionand shows him by a pausethat the preamble is overHe takes several deep breathsinhaling his very bad cigarFingal disturbs the manoeuvring of his eye FINGALWhat would the clever Horses find to call your storiesThosethings that are notfill your brainsKEMPThe transference is so complete in creative life of any The Little Review 7 sortReality is thething which is not for the creative artistsAn artist would have precisely that feeling ofmalaiseand disgust if he had put in another man s head the real truth the actual biological appearance of Naturethat my ideally truthful man would feel if he had liedFINGALThe arranging of the clothesor the symmetry of the bootlaceis a sign of a feeling for orderWhereas the squeamishness aboutthe truthin another man s head is a slavish timidityKEMPI don t think soI don t see the contradictionIn the sphere of practical life it is essential tohave factsPeople can only base their actions on factsIf you put in a person s head something purporting to be a factwhich is not a factit is liable to cause the utmost confusion and disorderBut the point for my argument is the physical uneasiness about this thing saidwhether fact or notthehallucination of the Object Thetruthis only another way of sayingthe substantial In life thesubstantialis thefact FINGALI m afraid I don t see what you re driving at Gruff and cold contemplation from the lofty general entrenched beside Kemp s noseconducting the affairs of the worldensuesThe eye sweeps over Fingal slowly like a searchlight KEMPDO you tell many lies Kemp fixes his eye stonily FINGALgrinning SometimesBut I m a particular manI am an esprit d ordreKEMPI am the sameI am the same I never lie Kemp beamsin sudden immense thawingA pausein which Kemp inundates Fingal with smiles of nauseating richnessRenewed pretence that this is the bourne of his argumentnamelythat he never tells lies FINGALGarconL Addition s il vous plait Fingal accepts this feintand prepares to break up the seanceThe waiter comesand stooping down to the tablemakes up the bill WAITERAttendezIl y avait deux legumesFINGALOuiUn salsifesWAITEROh yesSalsifesThank you MrFingal Fingal pays the billbut does not at once get upKemp leans forward and puts his hand on Fingal s arm KEMPTo day I have been lying steadily ever since I got upThe last two or three times we ve metI have told you several lieswhich you did not noticeI feel as though I should never tell the truth again Kemp sits back and stares at Fingal FINGALI noticed all your liesand was distressedKEMPThat is not trueFINGALOh yesPerfectlyYou told me you paid twopence each for those cigarsKEMPWellso I didFINGALAm I to take that as a lieorto put it another wayregard it as a proofunder the circumstancesthat you did not pay that for themKEMPI paid twopence for this excellent cigar Kemp holds it upand blows out his gingercream cheeks at its gilded label FINGALThen why did you tell Kemp springs up and calls the waiter KEMPBring me aFlor de CijasHe throws his cigar awaysits down and holds up his fingerthen hooks it over his noseHe has seen some fat mid European man with a cigar do thisand the fact of his smoking a cigarhabit to which he has lately takensuggests this actionKEMPI am found outThis will not make me downheartedAs a matter of fact I do not mind being found outThat is not materialI am not setting out to deceivebut only to cure myself of a superstition and rigid manner of feeling While hanlding Radac s much more satisfactory cigarKemp explains his latest regimen KEMPFor instancethis arm of mine attracted attention this morning His arm is bandagedand cased in a black leather trough which he takes off to eatKemp is getting over blood poisoning in the wrist and forearm KEMPI posed as a Mons herowith thisyesterday eveningin a pubIt was a triumph for meEducation and natural integrity The Little Review revolt against that stupid actionWe will admit it is not in my lineBut I am too shySuch things are excellent disciplineThey hardenhumble and invigorateThey are a medicine made up of the acrid harshness of the flash scum of a cityThe Ego s worst enemy is TruthThis gives truth the slap in the face good for us The Proprietor approachesstands in the middle of the square openinghis stomach pointing rudely at themhead and eye frowning down on KempThey look at him in silenceHe suddenly whisks his stomach awaywheelsand moves shoulderingly back into restaurant KEMPcontinuing SelfSelfOne must rescue that sanityTruthduty are insanityFINGALYou are talking for the timesThere are times when SelfSelfKEMPYesperhapsBut if we have not Warwe have Art FINGALNOW we have bothKEMPBut Art is much the purer and strongerand against its truths and impositions we much revolt or at least reactThepure artistis a Non senseThe gentle manlikewisemust be shownt his placeThe Prussian exploits the psychology of the commisvoyageur to harden himself into a practical aggressorFINGALDO not let us be like the PrussianforKEMPHeavenforbidah yesforbidWe could not be if we triedWe therefore could introduce a little of his methods without the danger he runs of foolishness and vulgarityFINGALWhat exactly do you want us to doKEMPI was talking about the individualThe Nation nowadays always has as much vulgarity as it can standFINGALQuiteThen you meanKEMPWeas individualsare at a disadvantage in a struggle with the communityIt containsinvariablyinevitablycriminal energystoicism and vulgarity of a high orderFINGALBut why do you make this opposition between the individual and the communityKEMPI did not make itFINGALBut does it exist to the extent youKEMPIt existsIt exists like thisA hundred men is a 10 The Little Review giant Kemp makes his points with a finger flattened out on the tableThe Proprietor brings his stomach forwardKemp waves it hurriedly away with his flatstiff finger KEMPA hundred men is a giantA giant is always rather lymphatic and inclined to be weak intellectuallywe are toldHe is also subject to violent ragesJust as legendary men were always at war with the giantsso are individuals with soceityThat exceptional men can be spoilt by the world is a commonplaceBut consider another thingSee how two or three distinguised people lose personal value in a mob at a dinnerat a meetingTheir personalities deteriorate in a momnt for an hour or twoThey hardly ever become the head and brain of the GiantFINGALThat doesn t apply to all menIt is due to some weakness in the personalitySome shine mostKEMPAhyesBut examine those shiners by themselvesand look steadily at their words and actsTheirs is a practical and relative successThe solitary test is the only searching oneThe fine personality losesin every caseby associationThe problem in life is to maintain the Ideal GiantThe artist is the Ideal Giant or ManyThe Crowd atits moments of heroism also isBut Art is never at its best without the assaults of Egotism and of LifeFor the health of the Giant as much as for that of the individual this conflict and its alertes are necessaryRevolution is the normal proper state of thingsFINGALParaguay or Venezuela offering the picture of the Ideal StateKEMPThey are not StatesThey are just RevolutionsThey should be called theRevolution of Venezuela etcetraetcetra Fingal leans back against the wall and stretches FINGALWellas though we hadn t war enough alreadyHere you are trying to stir up a new war a World WartooI supposeKEMPNoI m afraid one war might make us forget our other warsFINGALI wish it would Fingal stares back into the RestaurantTwo tables away a stout Belgian woman is eatingwith her leg heavily bandaged resting on a chairKemp turns towards Restaurantpivoting on his chairone elbow on table KEMPDid the Germans do thatFINGALNOShe comes from Louvainbut she did that herselfKEMPHas not she the grace to attribute it to the GermansShe comes from Louvainbandagedat a moment like thisIt is a case for the policeShe must be in German payFINGALQuite likelyAnd as we are the only people she impresses The Proprietor approaches from door at left THe PROPRIETORMiss Godd wishes to speak to you on the telephone Kemp get up KEMPI must go and telephone Fingal gets up FINGALI must goKEMPI shall see you soon againperhapsFINGALYesI m going North for a few daysI shall be back the beginning of next week They both walk back into RestaurantKemp going out through door at lefthalf way down the wallFingal through street door at farther end of Restaurant SCENE IICharactersMRJOHN PORTER KEMPScene A dark recessabout 6 feet longwith a telephone desk on wallon which John Kemp is leaning and speaking at telephoneAt the back is a staircaseon which several people go up and down during actionHis nose occasionally obscures the telephone mouthpiece as he bends his head and listensWhen he answers his nose seems fighting and fumingor drawing itself up solemnlyadmonishing the mouth into which he is speakingHis face is redthe veins protruding on the side of his foreheadpartly from the effect of holding the earpiece up to his earKEMPNoI did not say thatWhat I meant was that honesty was a rhythmit must be broken upI found myself becoming the first cousin to George WashingtonI really couldn t tell a lieI became the slave of any bloody factSimilarlybut oppositelyin my writingI did not introduce a single real character taken from lifefor over a yearI was becoming in both cases a maniacIn the case of art a man I met every day in the Restaurant might coincideexcept for some irrelevant detailswith my last dream or will pictureBut I steered all round him askanceand never touched himas though he had been a ghostHe was somethingI feltthat was too true to be trueDo you seeNot to consider life partially a dreamor fancy partially a substanceis utter madnessMyfancies are so mater of factshameless and conceitedthat they march about the streets ilke Golyadkin s doubleI have refused to accept them as realup till nowsimply because they happened to be thereIt is absurdWhatAbsurd Kemp inclines his head and listens crosslyThe voice speaking in his ear evidently annoys him KEMPYesI mentioned Golyadkinhe But that is wandering from the point His face becomes a confused mass of ironyshameand irritation KEMPYour father s spoons are excellentYesThat shows the right spiritBut it is not by pawning a spoonWhat Kemp seems no longer listeningHe says What occasionally and then relapses into staring at the groundHe at last begins speaking with impatient emphasisputting two more pennies into the machineKEMPMy point is plainIt is entirely a question of whole hoggingand escaping from the dreariness and self contempt of playWe play at everything hereat loveartwinning and losingdon t weWe doThe artists take themThey are the rottenest and most contemptible crowd discoverable rotten as most artists crowds areanywhere in the worldone of the worst sort of crowdsChelseaIt is a name to day that does not leave us many memoriesalasof genuninely Guinevere loving able dreamersIt is the most pestiferous haunt of dilettantismsnobbery and bourgeois selfishnessConsider thatragwe went to last weekOh my GodBut all that we are agreed onNowat least all that we must not beHow shall we avoid becoming that play actingThe Little Review 13 bickeringpretending trashEasilyfor you require years of selfish nursing to become thatYou sayWhen there is fire and intelligence and will all round youyou will become modelled to a reality that spits on thatYour quiet will not be contaminatedyour dreaming will ignore the mess in which it sits and contrivesNot quiteWe owe ourselves a sacrificeI would rather be out there with the soldiers than here with the playmn of the Western WorldBut when you think of battles you cannot help remembering that it is that art crowd that are being fought forinstead of theOur women and childrenfor whom you are tolend our strong right arm Women can always look after themselvescan t they We are the civilisation for which you are fighting I read to day in a newspaper that one of theCafe Royalties as the delighted paper called themhad said thatAnd thenhaving uttered that boasthe departed to a studio ragand the next morning he sculpted his daily sculpor pawed on to his canvas his daily slopprobably German as regards its emotions and intelligenceindubitably vomitNoactionfor medoes not lie that wayAnd then again if you don t remember the art crowdyou remember other equally nauseaous ones that linger behind and contaminate the Waractually dirtying with their existence the bitterest heroismdegrading deathYet actionif you could find the right actionis thesovereign cure for our ills And it is maddening to live with such a profusion of action suddenly poured outmost wastedat least not curing what requires that cure Kemp places two more pennies in the boxmutteringwhat porridge had John Keats He seems pursuing some parallel between his oratory and the pennies KEMPYesWell thenI doubt if you can act nowin the sense I meanany more than you can swim without waterBut at least avoid degrading substitutes for actionIf you actin however slight a wayactIf you are not doing anythingdo not pretend that you areDo nothingIt is the only clean proceeding when conditions are against some particular form of actionDo not shrink from misfortuneIt will not hurt youThen I can hold this thing no longer to my earI must goas wellAre you at your father s houseAloneI shouldn t interfere with his property any moreHaHaWe meet to morrowFarewell14 The Little ReviewKemp places the receiver upand walks quickly back through the door into the

large boned flatfaced woman of twenty years When she stands up she is very tall and strong lookingwith a small head and thick neckThe Mongol intensity of her face is mitigated by self consciousnessHer lips are painted a bright red in the midst of her yellow skinShe is always perfectly calmShe feels that her intelligence is not quite good enough for her companybut pride in what she considers her latent power of action brings her into steadfastnessKempas he looks at herwonders sometimes whether theactionhe preaches will not be found in his case in Rose Godd flinging herself on him and trying to tear him to piecesBut he is satisfied on reflectionand turns from the fact with distasteusuallythat it is a softer conflict that she desiresBut as between Rose Godd and himself that action could not be disguised into the role of discoveryKEMPWill you have coffeeAlbertTwo coffees pleaseWAITERTwo coffeessirYes sirKEMPThat is the situation and there is no preambleBut Hakluyt travelled into lands

intelligentIt would be a reconstruction as foolish as Don Quixote s was wiseYet we suffer from this shrivelling up of our horizonsWe need those horizonsand action and adventure as much as our books need exerciseWe have been rendered sedentary by perfected transportOur minds have become home keepingWe do not think as boldlyour thoughts do not leap out in the same wayWellin the case of the Earth

want of a better explanationto his reasoningHe feels he has not held his audience KEMPI feel that my lies and your spoons were about as playful as some of the absurdities with which we reproach our

havelike a great many other people whom I do not knowa curious lack of emotionThis thing is called restlessnessIn the streets at sight my unrest becomes a mild and gentle sorrow and gives birth to numerous adjectivesI walk on and on and the adjectives form themselves into remarkable thoughts that sometimes startle me and cause me to forget to listen to the castenets of my heels upon the lonely pavementThe little greedy half dead are in their bedsThe night like an army possesses the cityswarms upon the buildingsIn my walking I have a habit of likening the night to different thingsIt is a little game that diverts me and also causes me to forget to listen to the sound of my heels upon the lonely pavementLater I try to remember these images that came to me as I was walking and curse myself for an idiot and a profligateFor the night has a way of making a careless and unselfish lover even of a poetThe Little Review On this night I walked with my thoughts full of the grimaces of the little greedy half dead become now no preposterously silentThrough the little empty labyrinths of stone the centures sighed their desolationYellow and lonely advertisements burned here and there above invisible roofsand I observed that the buildings which were so important by daythe great perferated rectangles of stonethe streets that fulfilled the mighty functions of trafficlay under the stars like some gloomyuseles toylandThe city was an anachronism in the nightSilence with its dark and enigmatic face stared at the skyThe moon made inanimate blue fire flies of the windowsWhat a racket there was in these street by dayA rumble and a mumble and a bangbangbangThe shuffle of feet like the sound of a harsh windAnd I remember having watched the smoke of factories toppling at a precise angle out of chimney mouths and drawn in grey black awning stripes across a blue skyand the little greedy half dead with their endless faces and their innumerable hats and their indomitable complacencies crawling as usual along the treadmill of time and vastly excited about itBut now the immemorial smear of gestures had gone to bedThe millions had taken off their clothes and lay silent in the immemorial and hairy democracy of their skinsThere was something beguiling in the thought that all the countless and unnecessary people I saw during the day were practically naked at that momentStretched on their bellies and their backs they lay in fantastic imitation of their sincerer brethern packed away under the earthIt was night and the world was almost rid ofits raceThere remained only the figures like myselfthe isolate and furtive figures of the night that move here and there in the shadowsWhat a melodramatic company we areA few murderers standing like bold merchants on desolate street cornersA few prostitutes with the most practical of intentionsAnd a little scattered army of the uncataloguedThe fat world sleeps with its window cautiously opened three inchesfor it is autumn and chillthe while we move about adventuring on the treadmillPerhaps I lied when I said I was a person with a curious lack of emotionor boastedFor there was in me as I walked this night the knowledge that I had been growing olderMy thoughts were The Little Review 47 such that I stopped to wonder under the menacing shadow of what had been a great building why it was that old people were not always weepingAlready I had begun to think of youtha dreary omenI walked on until I came to the climax of archtiectural detail that is called the heart of the cityHere the night seemed broken into great lumps of shadowsThe curious hollow pallor like the light of vacant silver eyes hung about the shafts of stoneIt was as if the night had found itself unable to efface the rumble and the mumble and the endless faces of the dayThey persisted in this dead and hollow gleam like a shout that has just died or eyes that have just closedThe streets and their spread of fan like templesthe bleakglittering windows and the yellow advertisements burning above invisible roofs were lonesome for gestures and grimaces and noiseWe pass each otherwe murderersprostitutesbeggarswanderersvagabonds and thievesWe approach each other in the lonelydesolate streetsmuscles tensejaws setWe come up behind each other slowlymaliciouslyFor we are a different company than stuffs the streets by dayThus I walked through the heart of the citynoting it to be a place of suspended thundersa gloomyuseless toyland whose elaborate geometries were almost devoured by the nightHere the great hotels cast patches of light upon the empty sidewalksA taxi cab behind which trailed the wild laugh of a woman darted out of gloom and swept around a cornerThe all night restaurants were also lightedThey made each a little oasis in the nightWithin them could be seen through the large patient and effulgent windowshunched and inanimate figures drinking coffeeTheir faces were pale and they stared at their fingersI found myself before the entrance of a theaterIts grimy little facade lighted with innumerable yellow lamps strutted out of the darknesa dirty and insolent gypsy amid the black tombstones in this funereal streetGayety and entertainment here for the company that does not sleep at nightSardonic lights and mocking lithographseternal joy and Saturnalian defianceamid them in a little round office sat a fat faced blousy eyed woman like some imperturbable exile selling tickets for the mysteries of IsisIt had grown chill and a weariness had come over meI was tired of my adjectivesSoon the little greedy half dead would be stirring in their millions bedscoming larvalike into these waiting streetsI thought of long brown roads flanked by red leaved trees and of the processional of great white bellied clouds over the curving stagnant fieldsWhat a strange thing is the citya hard faced witch babbling and stinkingAnd here the mysteries of Isisthe forbidden things before the triangular altar of AstarteThere were two of usmyself and a little man with a watery faceand we moved into the theaterThe chillferruginous night of the city vanishedI felt as if I had suddenly thrust my head under the heavy dress of an old beggar womanA rusty lavender light filled the place and the uncoiling tinsel of tobacco smoke moved in spectral clouds through the mephitic gloomThere was a sharp fish like odor thatswam before my eyes in a chlorinated mistBeyond I could make out the glare and sparkle of the black and white shadowsand the click and whirr of the moving picture machine came to my earsI sat down with a feeling of relief and the theater seemed to grow brighterHeads of men and women grew out of the shadows and remained motionlessly sprinkled here and there among the rows of seatsOn the moving picture screen three horses with furious muscles were galloping at break neck speed over the crest of a sunlit hillOn the horses bounced three mentheir heads stiffened and tucked downtheir bodies reaching forward like claws in the windWe were quite distinct now in our seatsa silentbroodingdisinterested company of heads sprinkled here and thereThe reek and stench of us dragged itself along the walls in ulcerated clouds and circled our heads in violet spiralsThese figures sat in their seats as if they had been dropped from a great heightTheir faces spotted the gloom with little luminous patches of greyThere were snores and coughs and a curious unceasing shufflingThe darkness continued to lift as if some half hearted dawn were approachingLittle dog faced menold men with faces moulded out of phlegimwomen with scarred drawn skinsa shaggylifeles company herewhose headsas I closed my eyesremained in my thoughts a hand full of little withered nuts gathering mouldI opened my eyes and against the wall in my row sat an old man with a long bony faceHis ragged hat was pulled down over his forehead and his hair stuck out in whisps from under itHis The Little Review 49 head rested against the wall and with his mouth open he sleptHis body was folded in a strange angularity in the seatHis coat was tied in front with a piece of yellow rope and his trousers were openedIn the lavender gloom his face had an ashen mutilationIt was the sunkeninhuman mask of one long unburiedThe hands of this old man moved about as he sleptHe was dreamingHis body twitched and his feet crawled with elaborate caution about on the floorThe odor which came from himembracing me with polite neighborly insistencewas partially explained by the streaks of vomit on his clothes and the color of his handsA line of Turgenieff entangeld itself in my thought How redhow red are the roses On the moving screen a man with remarkable eyelashes was pointing a gun at a villainIn one arm this man held a clinging chrysanthemum eyed girlThe moving picture machine from somewhere behind me whirred and clicked and spurted forth its flickeringglazed moonbeamI looked about meAcross the islea row in front of where I satwere two figures parted by several seatsThe figure on the isle was that of a womanHer face seemed to be crudely carved out of rough red and grey stoneShe had a wide mouth and a flat noseShe had decourousely removed her hat and her hairgrey and green under the violet light of the moving picture raywas visibleA pair of short black cotton gloves were on her hands as she raised them one at a time to scratch at the back of her neckShe stared with round parrot eyes at the pictures in front of herchewing vigorouslyswallowing with great excitement and rubbing her nose with a forefinger as a climax to her enthusiasmsIt was evident that the pictures were effecting herI looked again at the moving picture screenThe man with the remarkable eyelashes and the stiff cupid s bow mouth had come to griefHe lay on a white sunny bed and appeared to be dyingHis hair was carefully combedThe chrysanthemum eyed girl was kneeling at his bedsideI recalled now having seen the fellow shotThe old woman s chewing gained vigor and she began to weepTears moved unnoticed down her cheeksHer forefinger remained in position under her nosemoving violently back and forth as the tears lost themselves in the black cotton of her golveI became aware of a softdeliberately spaced hissIt came from the figure 50 The Little Review that sat several seats to the left of the old womanHe was a stocky shouldered man with a black haired leonine head and strong featuresHis flashing dark eyes were turned upon the old womanHe was hissing to her and making perceptible signals with his chinThere was something eager and amorous about this mansomething solid and Rodinesque about his figureAnd the old womannoticing him through her tearslooked at him for several moments and screwed her hard slippery face into a hesitant smileA strange animation came upon the manHis shoulders twitchedhis massive head bobbed wierdly aboutHis eyes rolled in their sockets and his mouth opened and shining with teeth made clucking moist soundsTwice his body shot forward as if about to crash into the seats and then straightened to remain shaking from side to side like the vibrations of a long ropeThe old woman returned her eyes to the picturebut she appeared to have lost her enthusiasmHer black gloved forefinger rested in her lapThrough the corners of her eyes she observed the large headed man at her leftHe hadit was evidentchanged his tacticsThe flash and glitter of his previous emotion were gone from his faceInstead he had become nervousquerulous and pleadingHe was making little mouths with his stronglarge lips and pouting like an aggrieved boyHe tossed his leonine head in little coquettries and then suddenly held up a single fingerThe old woman staring at this elevated finger shook her headWhereat two fingers appeared in the gloomy air and remained stiff and shaking like amazing wordsThe old woman s little parrot eyes turned full upon him and stared shrewdly and with a curious disdainThere was a violent coughing in my rowThe old man with the bony face had awakenedHe sneezedcoughedrubbed his eyes and straightenedHis body flopped about and with a longtwisted finger he began to scratch behind his earHis face turned dully toward me and his curiousgelatinous eyes rested on me as if I were not presentHis face reminded me of the breast of a bird that had been pluckedAs I looked at him his eyes moved from me and drifted across the theaterHe began suddenly to wag his head and blink with his dead lids and his jaw rose on one side in a grinThe old woman across the isle was looking at him and smilingThere was a shuffle and clatter in my isle and the bony faced one sprawled to his feethis clothes hanging stiff and shapeless from himHe moved by meand I felt the thin little structure of his body under his loose rags as he shoved between me and the seat backsAnodor of herring and medicinal decay marked his passageHe walked up to the old womanhis feet shuffling along the floor and tapped her on the shoulderThe old woman cast a quickcontemptuous glance at the leonine head to her leftand rising with a chucklewalked up the isle after the shufflingragged figureThere was left the defeated oneHe sat with a look of wonder on his facethat slowly darkenedand bit at the nails of his handsAs his teeth worked in a growing ferocity upon his nails a look of agony came into his eyesHis shoulders began to twitchHe lurched about like a man drunkThen suddenly he disappearedOut of the row of seats came crawling a stump of a man whose body was fastened with straps to a square board on four little wheelsThe head of this manblack haired and leoninebarely reached to the tops of the seatsHe propelled himself by swinging two apelike arms back and forthIn his huge fists he held two flat ironsSlowly he rolled up the isle and came opposite mea half born thing with his thick torso waving snake like above the floorHe stopped and raised a pair of flashing eyes and glowered at meHis face worked into savage and undecided grimacesHis lips twisted and a drip appeared at their cornersFor several instants he eyed me while hisfury kept him silentThen his voice burst forth coming with a violent incongruity out of this half thing on the floorIt was a huge gruff voicethat of a man fat and towering Didyou see that he demandedHis hands remained motionless holding the flat irons to the floor Did you see itI had her firstI got her eye firstAnd then that stew butts inDidn t I have her first The face lifted toward me twitched and the fury passed out of itIn its place came a curious child like despairThe legless man began to weepHis shoulders jumped up and down in great sobsHis voice when he raised it again had become a whimperHe stared at me as the tears climbed out of his eyes and smeared themselves over his rugged face She beat it with that stew he said Sayhonest t God didn t I have her first He rolled on up the isle swinging long ape like armsOutside the night was vanishingThe chill morning air came like a scent of fresh water to my nosedried by the odors of the theaterPeople were moving in the grey streetsAt the end of the block they moved in a thin procession across the car tracksa string of dark figures without faces and shaped like sevensThe city was wakingThe rumble and the mumble and the bangbangbang had started againThe buildings stretched out of the early mistsFrom a corner came the shout of a manI looked over and saw beside a stand heaped with fresh newspapers the heavydwarf like stump of the legless manHe was selling papersHe raised his voice in a shout as we of the little thin

would I impinge upon your new domesticitiesYoursWalter VillerantWOMEN AND MEN Ford Madox Hueffer IV Average People I HAVe reflected for a long timeI have reflected for a very long timeI have really done my best to make a discovery which most people would regard as the easiest in the worldIt is one of those matters which every one would say at first sight was known to everyonebut which no one ever really knowsIf you ask any person in the world how many steps lead up to his front door he will not be able to tell youor if you ask him whether the figures on his watch are Arabic or RomanAnd yet there will be a portion of that man s brain that knows these thingsthough from his consciousness they are entirely absentThusevery man can descend his own steps without paying attention to the number of themwhich proves that somewhere in his automatic memory the knowledge is hidden awayAnd every manif presented with his own watch and the watch of another precisely similar inevery detail save that of the dial platewill know his own watch by itslook Along somewhat similar lines is the discovery that I am trying to makeFor what I want to know is What is an average man Whatfor the matter of that is an average womanWho has seen either of these impossible monstersAssuredly neither I nor you For such a sunflower never bloomed beneath the sun We all have very strongly within us the belief that there is such a thingThe belief is as strong as that in the immortality of our soulsAnd we thinkwhen we are not thinking about itthat we know a large number of quite average men and womenWe should laugh loudly if we were told that we could not put our finger immediately upon a perfectly average man or a perfectly average womanAnd yetthe moment you come to try to do it you will find that it is absolutely impossibleBy carefully going through the Alphabetand my calling bookI have found that I know at the present moment 1 642 men and womenI know themthat is to sayall of them to speak toAndhaving a fairly tenacious memeorywhich practically never forgets even very small things connected with the careers of other peopleI may say that I know something of the circumstances and the characters of all these peopleMy own acquaintance divides itself into three main bodies the distinctly lower classesthe intellectual classes and the distinctly leisured and upper classesOf the commercial middle classes I know practically very littleThese distinctions are of course arbitrarybut they more or less express what I meanI am aware that the objections will at once be made If you know nothing of the middle classes you cannot of course know anything of the average manfor it is precisely amongst the middle classes that the average man is to be found And of course there is something to be said for the objection until one comes to regard it scientificallyThen at once it disappearsForin the very nature of the case the middle classes are numerically small by comparison with the bulk of the peopleAnd indeed every aspect of this bewildering subject bristles with difficulties as soon as one approaches itThuslet us for the moment accept the dictum that the average man is to be found among the middle classesLet us carry it even a step further and say that the middle class man is the average manFor of course the great bulk of readers will be found among the middle classes or they would have been so found until yesterday when the coming of the cheap press spread some kind of printed matter into the hands even of the very poorest of servant girlsHere then is another difficulty of classificationOne cannot really say that the middle classes are the reading classesOne cannot even really say that the middle classes are the classes that most read thoughtful literatureIn a book dealing specifically with the life we live to day it is almost impossible to avoid mentioning the names of individuals or of institutionsAndto name individuals or institutions is always open to certain objectionsThese objectionsgrave as they areI must just face as best I canor rather I must just ignore themIf I couldI would just deal with my own readersbut I haven t the least idea who my own readers may beNo author ever has or ever can haveA certain number of people tell me that they have read my booksThey may have or they may not havebut I have no means of classifying themI don t in fact know my ownpublic But as soon as it comes to thepublicsof other authorsor more particularly of various journalsone arrives at much more definite groundOne knows at least what sort of person will not read the Sporting TimesYet having written the statement down I am at once driven to hesitationFor it occurs to me that I know very well a lady most of whose interests are intellectual or are connected with public movements in one way or anotherand she quite frequently mentions this journalcalling it by its orthodox nameThe Pink Un Or againI was once an inhabitant of a very remote village and became rather closely friendly with the vicarThis gentleman was just a vicarHe was quite unwordlyhe preached simplegentle sermonshe was good to the poor in the ordinary clerical mannerHe spent a good deal of time in fishingBut every now and thenhe would astonish be by letting drop startling pieces of gossip as to rathersmartpeople with whom he could not possibly have come into contactOne day he said something so oddconcerning a notoriety in the world of sport who was at that time on his trial for an offence against the laws of the country something so odd that I could hot help questioning himHe said I have it on the authority of a journal that I read regularlyI have never heard its statements questionedBut I dare say you do not read it yourself He uttered these last words as if the paper was a little over my head for social of for learned reasonsOf course the good man was quite nice about itbut he could not get it out of his head that he was the clergyman of the parish while I was some casual nobody who happened to have taken a house within the limits of his cure of soulsThen he told me the name of his paperIt was the PelicanSo that it is almost impossible to say even who will not read any given paperI have pursued this argument with such tenacity that I am aware that the matter I have in hand for the moment may have escaped the remembrance of the readerIt is whether or no the middle classes may be said to make up the bulk of the thoughtful reading classesLet us then take the case of two or three definite journalsLet us mention saythe Spectatorthe New Agethe Mercure de Francethe Frankfurter Zeitung or Maximilian Harden s journalDie ZukunftAl l these papers might be called journals with a The Little Review 59 thoughtful publicAnd of these we can say pretty accurately that the SpectatortheFrankfurter Zeitung and in a less degree Die Zukunjt appeal to the middle classesAs to the Spectator and the Frankfurter Zeitung there cannot be any doubt at allThe appeal of the one is mainly psychologicalof the other it would be too much to say that it is mainly financial for the German daily paper has an excellent newsorganisationvery good leader writersa numerour and wellequipped staff of critics and a general tone of sober liberalismBut you would not expect either from the Spectator or from the Frankfurter Zeitung anything startling in the thougts it expressesIn politics each is a sound but not violent party organthe Spectator being of a Whiggish Conservative one and the Frankfurter being Liberalwhich in Germany means practically Whiggish ConservativeIt is almost essential for every business man in Southern or Middle Germanywhatever may be the shade of his political opinionsto read this particular paper on account of the excellence of its business and financial informationThe English business reads his Spectator in order to keep himself from thinking anything originalAnd in that way much the same result is achievedIf we come to the New Age and to Die Zukunft we arrive upon much more delicate groundThe readers of the New Age are very numerous and come from widely different classesI have known several army officers who regularly studied its pagestogether with at least two colonial governorsquite a number of higher Civil Service officialssolicitors and members of the barOn the other hand I have known it read regularly by board school teachersshop assistantsservantsartisans and members of the poor generallyOf course they were the intelligent poorThe New Age is a much lighter organ than Die Zukunftthough the latter represents about the same type of thoughtBut the appeal of Die Zukunft is much more exclusively middle classIt is read with enthusiasm by the younger and more brilliant of German students of both sexesIt is more scientific in its views than any socialist paper that England can showIt is more brilliantly writtenit makes more appeal to the knowledge of its readers and it is in consequence distinctly harder to read on the other hand it is impossible to imagine any German officerofficialor any German working manservant or skilled artisan reading Die ZukunftAndwhile there is an enormous amount of socialistic literature in Germanythere is no well known journal that so mixes progaganda with advanced criticism of the arts and various aspects of life as does the New Age in EnglandAnd the circumstances in France are somewhat similar to those in GermanyYou have excellent Whiggish papers like the Journal des debats or the TempsAnd in matters of advanced political thought you have a great many socialist and even anarchist journals occupying themselves solely with propagandism of a greater or of a less violenceBut advanced criticisms of the arts or of life are left to journals like the Mercure de FranceThe Mercure has a large circulation all over the worldI have come across it in England more frequently than in Francebut that is probably merely accidentalBut its appeal is almost exclusively to the intellectual classes to presonseven among those classes who practise one or other of the four artsWhat results then do we arrive at from this cursory survey of the principal organs of journalistic thought through western EuropeI fancy at none at allNeither should we arrive at anything very useful if we considered thepublicsof the distinguished thinkers of todayWe might very well say that the readers of MrGalsworthy belong almost exclusively to the comfortable classes to the richer members of the middle class with a certain number of intellectuals who cannot be classed at allThe readers of MrHGWells were until latelywhen he began to be read by societywhich is not at all the same thing as the comfortable classes the readers of MrHGWells in his sociological moods were almost exclusively the not so wealthy middle classes with a sprinkling of the more scientifically minded intellectuals and teachersBut the works of MirKipling of MrKipling the imperialist must have been infinitely more familiar may still be infinitely more familiar to the distinctly poor than ever were the works of MrWells or MrGalsworthythough both these writers troubled their heads much more about the poor than ever did the author ofThe Absent Minded Beggar On the other hand it is customary to say that the real writers for the lower classes are men like MrCharles Garvice or the brothers Hocking gentlemen whose names are absolutely unfamiliar to any literary circlewho would probably modestly lay claim to no literary merits at all but whose books sell by the many million literarlly by the many millionBut this customary saying is probably quite fallaciousThe appeal of the brothers Hocking is I believepurely a sectarian one they are read by the members of the particular Free Church to which they may happen to belongThe works of MrGarvice are very little read by the really poor but have their millions of supporters among all sorts of classes ranging from city clerks to the wives of chemists in the provincesof manufacturers in the Potteriesand of quite rich commercial persons in the NorthSo that here again we arive at no results at allor at no results that are worth very muchLet us just restate what we have arrived atThe most definite fact that we can state is that certain journals like the Spectatorthe Frankfurter Zeitungthe Temps or the Debats are read by a number of person s who desired to be safe either in their opinions or in their investmentsAnd it is safe to say that the persons who desire to be safe are persons who have something to loseAnd it is also fairly safe to say that the majority of people who have something to lose belong to the comfortable section of the middle classesAnd without doubt it is to this section that we should go to find the average manIt is at least for a typical member of this class that the most inisistent claim would be made by the widest selection of members of thepress If I should say that the average man was a skilled artisana country grocer or a farm laboureror if I should say that the average woman was a Lancashire cotton handmine girl or a labourer s wifethe whole Conservative and Whig press the Spectator the Daily Telegraph the Yorkshire Postand Truthand possibly even the Manchester Guardian would sneer at me in the peculiar way that the Reviewers belonging to these organs of the cultivated classes so efffectually cultivateThe Radical papers the Daily Newsthe Daily Chronicle New Age and so on would not take the trouble to back me upbecause I am not a propagandist of their particular typeBut if I say that the average man is a gentleman of no occupationbelonging to the comfortable section of the middle classesall the Whig and Conservative papers that I have named would cordially agree with meThe more advanced organs would agree sadlyThis is because it is the ambition of every Englishman who is worth calling and Englishman his secret ambition deep down in his heart is to become a gentleman of no occupation belonging to the comfortable section of the middle classesThis is the great ideal of every EnglishmanWe all of us want to be peersbut that is only a day dreamTo become a gentleman of leisure we all of us have a chanceso that this particular Average Man is the ideal of all sections and of all classesThe Daily Telegraph would like to limit the number of him and render him privilegedthe Fabian Society and other socialist societies wish to turn every Englishman into such an individual perhaps not quite so well offbut specifically the sameLet us then consider the life and habits of such a person to be continuedThe CriterionArt said the aged MrWilliam Dean Howellsspeaking for MabieWoodburyVan Dyke and Co

his magazineTHE READER CRITIC Israel SolonNew YorkNow a word or more about the April Review moresurelyif I know anything about myself by nowIt is the best single number I have yet come acrossIt is really a wonderful thingI don t believe a magazine has ever given me so much joy beforeIt is first rate from a purely commercial stand point alsoHuefferMay Sinclair and Joyce ought to be good business getters for any commercial magazineHow in the world did Pound ever get hold of themThis of course does not mean that I agree with the propositions formulated in the magaaineI do notMay Sinclairfor instancefalls foul ofsubjective and objective As a result she seems to think that toplungeis the same as toplungeinto one s selfThat is not soWhen we plunge into ourselves we aresubjective and when we plunge into others we areobjective James Joyce has plunged deep into himselfto be surebut not before he had erected about himself an almost insurmountable wallHe has devoloped a technique that none but the most disciplinedthe most persistent and sympathetic are able to break throughFor myselfI should never make use of any term nearly so precipitate as plunging when describing the art of James JoyceI should say that James Joyce adventures slowly and panifully with a huge stone deliberately tied to his middlethat he might sink readily and stay under long and be all but unable to retreatI seem to detect in Miss Sinclair an error common to humanityShe seems to mistake what she herself finds difficult for what is intrinsically meritoriousIf I were to go on to explain why some of us plunge into ourselves and some of us into othersI should have to bring in sexAnd sexI am told by those who ought to knowis simply impossibleAnd James Joyces portrait of young Cyril Sargentpp36 37is marvelous beyond wordsHe is the most sensitive writer aliveI wish I could advise him to make friends with himselfHe is not nearly so bad as he seems to believe he isHis is merely a youthful judgment hanging overBut what gave me the most spontaneous and continuous joy was Hueffer sWomen and Men He keeps getting better with each instalmentWhy the shop keepers had not bought that up is beyond meBut his theory that the observable differences between the sexes are differences resulting from their different employments must be pronouncedunproved Even granting that barbers and waiters are effeminateit does not follow that their effeminacy is the result of their occupationsIt may befor instancethat effeminate men take to barbering and waitingHe must be awareof coursethat all his arguments have been pretty well gone over in the endless debates between the Darwinians and LamarckiansI don t mean that anything has been settledThe debate as to which is the greater factorheredity or environmentwill no doubt go on as long as there is no agreement as to the definition of heredity and environmentand we are today further from any such definition than ever beforeIt is a shortsighted assumptionfor instancethat heredity ends with the emergence from the uterusNor is it more than a merely arbitrary assertion that birth takes place thenFor we are then driven to admit that man islet us saytwenty years younger at birth than a calfIf Hueffer s theory were sound it would follow that the differences between the sexes would disappear as men and women continued to follow the same occupations for any great length of timeThere are many such families in EnglandTake the gloversfor instanceor peasantsNosex differentiation having once set init will become greater with timeSpecificgiven characteristics may and no doubt will disappearYouthful types may replace ferocious among menMany or even all the present secondary sexual characteristics may fade out and disappear for biometricsbut only to reappear in psychologic formIt appears to me that he is unaware that he is merely making a dogmatic assertion of a personal prejudice when he says that the only woman a man ever gets to know is the woman he learns to know during a passionate experienceOne could with equal truth assert that in passion we are incapable of learning to know anythingNo one woman is the womanexcept for a given interestBut all that I have said does not detract from the value of the essay as a piece of styleIt is quite the mellowest and most wholesome piece of composition that I have read in a long whileBut I must get to write something for theaverage reader or theeconomic manorGeorge WashingtonQuotes OKor whatever it may be that is supposed to be reading our magazine fictionI
