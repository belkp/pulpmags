innocent people who were indicted and why the Chamber of Commerce wanted them indictedon page twenty nineBut what happened after the indictment is more interesting and more horrible to mefive victims

argument and hesitation and won t it be better togo a little slow and is it advisable to distribute pamphletsetc etc no lawyer had been engaged and none of theworkerscould agree about whatstandto take would it be better to express sympathy openly with the anarchistsnone of the five has ever claimed to be an anarchistI believeor would it be wiser to try to prove they were not anarchistsor would it be safer to get a small lawyer who costs little and is worth nothing or a big one who costs too much and might do somethingor would it be more expedient to keep out of it altogetheretc etc etc or The Little Review 18we just do the best we can even if it isn t muchDo you think there was a single worker with the incredible inspiration todo the most we can and make sure that it is very much I saw Emma Goldman and Berkman brooding over this strange and awful spectacle like two prophets whose souls are slowly petrifying under the antics of their discipleshere some one told me a storyOnce upon a time Bjôrnstjerne Bjornsonup in Norwayheard of a little French seamstress who was accused of murder in ParisShewas poor and quite unbefriended and there was practically no chance of her receiving justiceBjôrnson hurried to Paristook her caseand won it in the French courtsin Frenchfor the simple joy of doing something he believed inyou imagine that happening in AmericaThere isn t a single labor lawyer in the country who ever does itIf there are any who are willing they are not able if they are able they are not allowedCESWood tried to do it for Caplan and Schmidtbut the workers themselves prevented him from taking the caseThey kept him trotting between Portland and Los Angeles while they decided that it would be fatal to have him come straight out with the fact that it was a labor fightSometimes I imagine a young god springing up in labor ranks strong enough to rush in and fight the courts for his peopleyoung enough to devote his life to itnaive enough to do it for an idea rather than for a feeand ironic enough to do it whether his people want it or notto continue about the bombFinally a prominent lawyer was found one whose name carried enough weight to impress even the important and ignorant San Francisco citizens who were howling aboutanarchists But the fee he charged before even touching the case was so large that Emma Goldman and the unions could raise only half of itand the rest was supplied by the daughter of a man whom the workers would call a capitalist and whose money they would repudiate as having been drained from the blood of their classShe not only supplied the moneyshe said she would stand behind the victims if it took the last cent she had not merely because they were innocentand the only thing she asked was that the money should be used in a direct and active way and not for the pretending and denying and covering up that characterize all labor fights in this countryWellI wouldn t get half so disgusted with labor if it would ever acknowledge that vision is not necessarily a matter of classIt is almost terrifying to watch aThe Little Review 19labor propagandist thinkIf he is talking about Henry Fordfor instancehe will sketch the picture of a man who has created a5 a clay minimum wage only by such speeding up of labor that labor is too nerve racked to benefit by it so that Ford becomes a clever rascal who makes labor rich only to make himself richerOf course Ford is an idealist of appalling and marvelous simplicityin quite the same position that an anarchist would be whose scheme had begun to workand no more to blame for the spots in which it didn t workpropagandist can t thinkBut for that matter only one kind of mind really does thinkand that is the artist kindI mean this only the artist mind sees that this is the way things happen in the world and refuses to sentimentalize over it or to do nothing about itHere are five labor people misunderstood bysociety unchampioned bylabor and rescued by the bloody capitalist who has neither the limitations with which labor endows capital nor the limitations with which capital endows laborWhat funAnd some of the propagandists will feel likeMajor Barbaraabout accepting that moneyOnly the artist mind knows that it doesn t matter where the money comes frommoney is moneyand it is made of slavery whether it comes from a financier or a coal diggerOnly the artist mindcourse the point of the whole business is thisthe labor farce isn t confined to labor it is merely the farce in which all people contentedly luxuriateIt is a matter of rebellions that never become realis the sixteen year old girl living in the midst of a typical American familyNowno one can live long in such a place without losing his mind unless he has none to loseBut let the girl try to get out of that hideous hell and the family detectives can have her back in a minute and arrest any one who tried to help her as an abductora thing happened the other day in ChicagoIt happens every few minutes all over the earthThe only way to get out of such a mess is to get out of it detectivesjailsfamilies and friends to bootFollow through Make it real Your friends can t afford to be very real one of them probably has a family to support and the others probably couldn t stand the horror of being in the papers But a girl or a boy can stand up to anythingIf they can t their old age will

GourmontThe Little Reivew 22York Letter ROSS MACDOUGALL New Playhouse and a New Play have always felt that the hope of a new spirit in the theatre will come not so much from amateurs and their talking organizations as from the rebels within the theatre and the work they can accomplishI agree with Gordon Craig when he says that no one has any right to meddle withand potter aboutthe theatre who does not know it from the insideIn no other field is there such a gang of busy bodies old women of both sexeswho have the ignorant reformers talking sense developed to such a pernicious degreeThe air is dark with the empty words they belch forthbut from their deeds the world remains light and freeIf the regeneration of the theatre from the base influences that now possess itis to take place it will notI am surebe by the work of the drama leagues and so calledarttheatresThe work of such managers as JDWilliams and producers like Granville Barker and BIden Payne does more for the theatre by the working out of certain ideals than all the talk about those ideals and the jumbling with them by the old ladiesleagues and theartyamateursA plague on them allNew York this season a new theatre is to be openedHelen Freemanwho for a time was a Belasco star and later the leading woman with William Gilletteis to own and direct this latest attempt to establish a new spirit in the theatreWith Miss Freeman will be associated a group of six professional actorsAll of themlike their directorhave ideals which they plan to work forFor the first few months they are to produce one act thingsAmong them will be plays by Evreinova young Russian not yetdiscoveredby this rapacious countrytwo plays by the Spanish dramatistJacinto Benvenetoof whose seventy five excellent plays not one has yet been given here plays by other unknown European dramatistsnew plays by Zoë AkinsWitter BynnerRollo Petersand other American writersFreeman has chosen as a name for this interesting theatre the hour of the curtain riseIt will therefore be known asThe Nine o Clock Theatre Much is expected from Miss Freeman and much from her theatreSuccess to itand to herLittle Review 23 New Play I heard that a new fantastic play was to be produced by Arthur Hopkinsand that the scenes and costumes were to be designed by Robert Edmond JonesI booked seats as early as I couldI remembered the work of Jones in Anatole Frances s The Man Who Married a Dumb Wife and his work on the inner scenes and costumes of the Shakespeare MasqueBoth were the works of a new decorative genius who had much to give to our theatre that is barren of the work of artistsI expected much of the new playand lowhat was disappointment was waiting thereplay firstIt is the story of a princess of a mythical landwhose lover has been killed in war and who in the last act joins him The play is name The Happy Ending The curtain rises on a dark forestthrough which the princess is wandering and posingand mumbling and moaning to herselfComes then three Maeterlincian maidens also mumbling and playing chorus to themselvesExit the mumbling maidens and enter the King and Queen of this mythical landMumbleth then these two for a whiletillwithout any warningthe King bluntly asks the Queen for a child Yes Right there in the forest he does itIt s the last thing one expects in a fantasythis realistic demand for a son and heirBut that s a minor pointLike many another thing that happenedit had nothing to do with the dramaa dreary scenein which the wandering princess seats herself on some potato sacks and mumbles to the accompaniment ofyesprincessnoprincess spoken at half minute intervals by a dull witted woodsmanthe curtain rises on a sceneentitled in the programmeThe Hereafter What a HereafterA bank of sunburnt stage grassa bilious yellow tree much amber lightCrowds of children with squeaky voices lolled and pranced about the placeThe authors seem to have taken their cue from the old hymn children will be thereWho have sought the Lord in prayerIn Heaven we all shall meetOh that will be joyfulcan assure you that it was anything but joyfulA sort of stagey joy was evident but not a sight of the real spontaneous feelingThere was a sort of Queen hostesswho welcomed everyoneI have an ideaThe Little Review 24she was MrsGod or maybe assistant to StPeterShe wore an elaborate shiny yellow evening gown and a set smile after the fashion of the ladies in charge of YWCAhostels on earthA nicewell spoken motherly sort of person this Queen waswho did her best to make everybody feel at homethere was a wreck at sea or a railway accidentmany male and female supers waddled their bodies in joyous movement across the stage and laughed and made mouthy noisesOhso glad they were to be in Heaven after the shocks they had gone through on earthIt was curious to note that they all entered Heaven with whole bodies and unmessed clothesthese merry wreck and collision victimsthe curtain rings down on the scene of the Hereafter it does so to the sound of cheeringAnd whyA whole army has just been annihilatedand to the tune ofJohn Brown s Bodytheir spirits are marching toward HeavenAnd so the happy inhabitants of the Hereafter must cheer to think of this influx to their landAfter the tawdry Heaven one is refreshed by the beauty of the unnecessary scene On the way to the islands of sleep They still use rowboats in that land it seemsbut as they are rowboats with beautifully lighted innards one doesn t object very muchOne does objecthoweverto the next sceneIt is calledSpace Imagine Space as a back drop sprinkled with stars like an old fashioned frosted Christmas CardIn the middle of this a scarlet circle with the continents of North and South America painted in a muddy brown colorA sorry picture of space to come from an imaginative artistlast sceneand the best from the scenic and dramatic standpointtakes place in the palace of the KingHere comes the princess after having wandered through the forest awake and the Hereafter in a dreamand after falling in some queer kind of fit dies and so joins her dead lover and the rest of the cosmopolitan group in Heavenmess by masters A very messy messÀ sloppy play to start withBad acting to carry it alongMediocre music and stage setting that seem to have been influenced by the play instead of rising above itI await with interest to see the work that Jones is to do for the Russian BalletHe will have his chance to re establish himselfI m sure he is artist enoughto grasp it Little Review 25Reader Critic Paralysis H New YorkYou have the
