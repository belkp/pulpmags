evening falls And the yellow lights leap one by one Along high walls And along black streets that glisten as if with rain The muted city seems Like one in a restless sleep who lies and dreams Of vague desires vague memories and half forgotten  pain Along dark veins like lights the quick dreams run Flash are extinguished flash again To mingle and glow at last in the enormous brain And die away As evening falls   A dream dissolves these insubstantial walls A myriad secretly gliding lights lie bare The lover rises the harlot combs her hair The dead man s face grows blue in the dizzy lamplight The watchman climbs the stair The bank defaulter leers at a chaos of figures And runs among them and is beaten down The sick man coughs and hears the chisels ringing The tired clown Sees the enormous crowd a million faces Motionless in their places Ready to laugh and seize and crush and tear The dancer smooths her hair Laces her golden slippers and runs through the door To dance once more Hearing swift music like an enchantment rise Feeling the praise of a thousand eyes  As darkness falls The walls grow luminous and warm the walls Tremble and glow with the lives within them moving Moving like music secret and rich and warm How shall we live tonight where shall we turn To what new light or darkness yearn A thousand winding stairs lead down before us And one by one in myriads we descend By lamp lit flowered walls long balustrades Through half lit halls which reach no end   Conrad Aiken  MELODY IN A RESTAURANT  The cigarette smoke loops and slides above us Dipping and swirling as the waiter passes You strike a match and stare upon the flame The tiny firelight leaps in your eyes a moment And dies away as silently as it came  This melody you say has certain voices They rise like nereids from a river singing Lift white faces and dive to darkness again Wherever you go you bear this river with you A leaf falls and it flows and you have pain  So says the tune to you but what to me What to the waiter as he pours your coffee The violinist who suavely draws his bow That man who folds his paper overhears it A thousand dreams revolve and fall and flow  Someone there is who sees a virgin stepping Down marble stairs to a deep tomb of roses At the last moment she lifts remembering eyes Green leaves blow down the place is checked with shadows A long drawn murmur of rain goes down the skies And oaks are stripped and bare and smoke with lightning And clouds are blown and torn upon high forests And the great sea shakes its walls And then falls silence And through long silence falls This melody once more Down endless stairs she goes as once before   So says the tune to him but what to me What are the worlds I see What shapes fantastic terrible dreams I go my secret way down secret alleys My errand is not so simple as it seems  ILLICIT  Of what she said to me that night no matter The strange thing came next day My brain was full of music something she played me I couldn t remember it all but phrases of it Wreathed and wreathed among faint memories Seeking for something trying to tell me something Urging to restlessness verging on grief I tried to play the tune from memory But memory failed the chords and discords climbed And found no resolution only hung there And left me morbid Where then had I heard it What secret dusty chamber was it hinting Dust it said dust and dust and sun  light A cold clear April evening snow bedraggled Rain worn snow dappling the hideous grass And someone walking alone and someone saying That all must end for the time had come to go  These were the phrases but behind beneath them A greater shadow moved and in this shadow I stood and guessed Was it the blue eyed lady   Conrad  The one who always danced in golden slippers And had I danced with her upon this music Or was it further back the unplumbed twilight Of childhood No much recenter than that  You know without my telling you how sometimes A word or name eludes you and you seek it Through running ghosts of shadow leaping at it  Lying in wait for it to spring upon it Spreading faint snares for it of sense or sound Until of a sudden as if in a phantom forest You hear it see it flash among the branches And scarcely knowing how suddenly have it Well it was so I followed down this music Glimpsing a face in darkness hearing a cry Remembering days forgotten moods exhausted Corners in sunlight puddles reflecting stars Until of a sudden and least of all expected The thing resolved itself and I remembered An April afternoon eight years ago Or was it nine no matter call it nine A room in which the last of sunlight faded A vase of violets fragrance in white curtains And she who played this same thing later playing  She played this tune And in the middle of it Abruptly broke it off letting her hands Fall in her lap She sat there so a moment With shoulders drooped then lifted up a rose   One great white rose wide open like a lotus And pressed it to her cheek and closed her eyes You know we ve got to end this Miriam loves  you If she should ever know or even guess it What would she do Listen I m not absurd I m sure of it If you had eyes for women To understand them which you ve never had You d know it too  So went this colloquy Half humorous with undertones of pathos Half grave half flippant while her fingers softly Felt for this tune played it and let it fall Now note by singing note now chord by chord Repeating phrases with a kind of pleasure Was it symbolic of the woman s weakness That she could neither break it nor conclude It paused and wandered paused again while  she Perplexed and tired half told me I must go Half asked me if I thought I ought to go  Well April passed with many other evenings Evenings like this with later suns and warmer With violets always there and fragrant curtains And she was right And Miriam found it out And after that when eight deep years had passed Or nine we met once more by accident But was it just by accident I wonder She played this tune Or what then was intended   Conrad Aiken  HAUNTED CHAMBERS  The lamp lit page is turned the dream forgotten The music changes tone you wake remember Deep worlds you lived before deep worlds hereafter Of leaf on falling leaf music on music Rain and sorrow and wind and dust and laughter  Helen was late and Miriam came too soon Joseph was dead his wife and children starving Elaine was married and soon to have a child You dreamed last night of fiddler crabs with fiddles They played a buzzing melody and you smiled  Tomorrow what And what of yesterday  Through soundless labyrinths of dream you pass Through many doors to the one door of all Soon as it s opened we shall hear a music Or see a skeleton fall  We walk with you Where is it that you lead us W e climbed the muffled stairs beneath high lanterns W e descend again We grope through darkened cells You say This darkness here will slowly kill me  It creeps and weighs upon me is full of bells  This is the thing remembered I would forget No matter where I go how soft I tread This windy gesture menaces me with death  Fatigue it says and points its finger at me Touches my throat and stops my breath   My fans my jewels the portrait of ray husband The torn certificate for my daughter s grave These are but mortal seconds in immortal time They brush me fade away like drops of water They signify no crime  Let us retrace our steps I have deceived you Nothing is here I could not frankly tell you No hint of guilt or faithlessness or threat Dreams they are madness staring eyes illusion  Let us return hear music and forget  COUNTERPOINT TWO ROOMS  He in the room above grown old and tired She in the room below his floor her ceiling Pursue their separate dreams He turns his light And throws himself on the bed face down in laughter She by the window smiles at a starlight night  His watch the same he has heard these cycles of ages Wearily chimes at seconds beneath his pillow The clock upon her mantelpiece strikes nine The night wears on She hears dull steps above her The world whirs on New stars come up to shine  His youth far off he sees it brightly walking In a golden cloud wings flashing about it Darkness Walls it around with dripping enormous walls   Conrad Aiken  Old age far off or death what do they matter Down the smooth purple night a streaked star falls  She hears slow steps in the street they chime like music They climb to her heart they break and flower in beauty Along her veins they glisten and ring and burn He hears his own slow steps tread down to silence Far off they pass He knows they will never return  Far off on a smooth dark road he hears them faintly The road like a sombre river quietly flowing Moves among murmurous walls A deeper breath Swells them to sound he hears his steps more clearly And death seems nearer to him or he to death  What s death she smiles The cool stone hurts her elbow The last few raindrops gather and fall from elm boughs She sees them glisten and break The arc lamp sings The new leaves dip in the warm wet air and fragrance A sparrow whirs to the eaves and shakes its wings  What s death what s death The spring returns like music The trees are like dark lovers who dream in starlight The soft grey clouds go over the stars like dreams The cool stone wounds her arms to pain to pleasure Under the lamp a circle of wet street gleams And death seems far away a thing of roses A golden portal where golden music closes Death seems far away   And spring returns the countless singing of lovers And spring returns to stay  He in the room above grown old and tired Flings himself on the bed face down in laughter And clenches his hands and remembers and desires to die And she by the window smiles at a night of starlight The soft grey clouds go slowly across the sky  MULTITUDES TURN IN DARKNESS  The half shut doors through which we heard that music Are softly closed Horns mutter down to silence The stars wheel out the night grows deep Darkness settles upon us a vague refrain Drowsily teases at the drowsy brain In numberless rooms we stretch ourselves and sleep  Where have we been What savage chaos of music Whirls in our dreams We suddenly rise in darkness Open our eyes cry out and sleep once more We dream we are numberless sea waves languidly foaming A warm white moonlit shore  Or clouds blown windily over a sky at midnight Or chords of music scattered in hurrying darkness Or a singing sound of rain We open our eyes and stare at the coiling darkness And enter our dreams again  Conrad Aiken   FACETS  COMPLETION  My heart has fed today My heart like hind at play Has grazed in fields of love and washed in streams Of quick imperishable dreams  In moth white beauty shimmering Lovely as birches in the moon glimmering From coigns of sleep my eyes Saw dawn and love arise  And like a bird at rest Steady in a swinging nest My heart at peace lay gloriously While winds of ecstasy Beat round me and above  I am fulfilled of love  ON THE HEIGHT  The foothills called us green and sweet W e dallied but we might not stay And all day long we set our feet In the wind s way  We climbed with him the wandering trail Up to the last keen lonely height   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Where snow peaks clustered sharp and frail Swimming in light  Sheer on the edge of heaven we dwelt And laughed above the blue abyss While on my happy lips I felt Your windy kiss  You were the spirit of the height The breath of sun and air A bird dipped wing and swift and white Peace brooded there  PARTING AFTER A QUARREL  You looked at me with eyes grown bright with pain Like some trapped thing s And then you moved your head Slowly from side to side as though the strain Ached in your throat with anger and with dread  Soon you had turned and left me and I stood With a queer sense of deadness over me And only wondered dully that you could Fasten your trench coat up so carefully  Till you were gone Then all the air was thick With my last words that seemed to leap and quiver And in my heart I heard the little click  Of a door that closes quietly forever   Eunice Tietjens  PRAISE FOR HIM  And if I find you beautiful what then Shall I not take my pleasure in the line Of your clean chiseled nostril and the fine Crisp curve your hair makes on your forehead Men Are plenty who are dull and dutiful I owe you thanks that you are beautiful  And if your spirit s vividness is such That with the swiftness of a flight of birds Rises the covey of your colored words Where is the song shall praise you overmuch I hold no brief for pious lividness I thank you for your spirit s vividness  And if your soul Is there a soul Perhaps At least admit it as a way men speak Your soul then lonely as a mountain peak And naked as a fawn if it can lapse Sheer outward from the rim of things I see Well Still I m thankful for your liberty  AT THE BANQUET  Above the wine and cigarettes  Below the jest that flies I catch with half amused insistence A throb of music in the distance  Your eyes   They knit the wine and jest together  In deeper harmonies With my own thoughts they interlace Like some strange contrapuntal bass  Your eyes  The words we speak say all and nothing  In them no mystery lies Only between my soul and sense Steal half amused and half intense  Your eyes  DEFEAT  I have seen him and his hand Has that slow gesture still  My tutored heart That had gone quietly these many months And happily securely beat its way Glad to be free of the old instancy My heart betrayed me Cowardly it stopped And then it leaped And the old Panic hoofbeats thundered in my ears  Oh is there then no peace for me When old love will not die And shall I conquer all things Thrusting up through the intolerable pain of growth Until my soul   Eunice Tietjens  Leaps winged to the sunset s rim Only at last to break myself on love And fall a trembling like an aching girl Because he has a beautiful slow hand  THE TEPID HOUR  In such a tepid night as this Strange formless sorrowings lie hid Like melancholy in a kiss Like what we dreamed in what we did In such a tepid night as this  From out some shadowy depths of me Vague longings struggle dreamer wise They stir and moan uneasily Then sleep again too weak to rise From out those shadowy depths of me  Life holds me by so frail a thread That scarce I feel the drag of it Alive I seem and yet half dead But quick or dead I care no whit Life holds me by so frail a thread  I would not snap the thread and yet  Light as it is I grudge its hold  Twere broken with no more regret  Than lingers round a love grown old  I would not snap the thread and yet  Eunice Tietjens   THE SOUL OF SUMMER  Incessant chatter of blackbirds over the flags Sinuous falls of the swallows and sudden turns Short flights preoccupied of the robin mothers This is the living summer this is summer  The fine dust drifts in the torpid air sluggish A faint blue shadow veil hung before green A dry hush on the grass stalks on the corn stalks Lazy dust drift of the heavy summer  This is summer fulfilled this is the summer Of waiting wings still wings in passionate tremor This is the summer when torpor blossoms to storms And throbbing wings burst out to the height of the wind  I too know the summer I know the summer Of light poured on the soft white of her neck I know the hair that flashed in the summer sun I know the summer whose laughter pierced my heart  MARY MARY MY LOVE  Why are you trembling so Mary Mary my love Why are your hands so cold Your hands that burn my lips  And the night is throbbing with us Mary Mary my love   Edward Sapir  But your little hands are cold Your hands that have set me aflame  I know why you tremble so Mary Mary my love I know why your hands are cold I see your eyes aflame  And we are one in the silence Mary Mary my love We are one in your trembling One in our hearts aflame W e are one in the night My Mary Mary beloved  Edward Sapir  ON INDIAN LAKE  Apple trees on a low hill And the dead sun behind The water red and still No sound no wind  Sudden the booming flight Of coots upstirred Overhead in the early night The moon white bird  Charles L O Donnell   THREE SONNETS  SANCTUARY  How is it faith outstrips the doubting word Leaving the skeptic brain in overthrow And swift as arrow from the archer s bow Flies up and ever upward like a bird Today the heavy mists of doubt are stirred By distant currents winds that softly blow As if a promise given long ago Were faintly whispered and as faintly heard I sometimes think that high above Earth s dome Our hopes from turret to dream turret soar And like gray pigeons build their nests and mate There Beauty harbors them when they turn home From their wide circling and forevermore Their sanctuary is inviolate  RITUAL  Kneeling I worship at that holy shrine Where Love returns when the beloved is gone Where night the sea and one dark Gothic pine Breathe their old covenants of golden dawn Again I hear the reverberant plaintive tides Chanting their litanies upon the dune And dream I await you where the sea divides Cleft by the silver pathway of the moon   Florence Kìlpatrick Mixter  Though when the eastern rim of heaven pales I shall arise alone uncomforted Now like a jewelled censer night exhales The perfumed incense of a dream long dead And your rapt spirit like an organ pours Its glad hosannas on long echoing shores  THE DEATH OF AN ARTIST  I tire of looking at the sea he said The composition s bad it needs a tree Within the line of vision where the red Of sunset pales before immensity There s too much water and there s too much sky Without a frame to hold them in their place And not enough of shore to rest the eye Or any little thing to shatter space If I were painting it he suddenly smiled You d come upon it almost unaware Down avenues of green your soul beguiled Would yield the sea a glance and find it fair How swiftly then the spirit would go free I tire he said of looking at the sea  Florence Kilpatrick Mixter SONGS AND CATCHES  DICKY  Oh what a heavy sigh Dick are you ailing  Even by this fireside Mother My heart is failing  Tonight across the down Whistling and jolly I sauntered out from town With my stick of holly  Bounteous and cool from sea The wind was blowing Cloud shadows under the moon Coming and going  I sang old heathen songs Ran and leaped quick And turned home by St Swithin s Twirling my stick  And there as I was passing The churchyard gate An old man stopped me Dicky You re walking late   Robert Graves  I did not know the man I grew afeard At his lean lolling jaw His spreading beard  His garments old and musty Of antique cut His body very lean and bony His eyes tight shut  Oh even to tell it now My courage ebbs His face was clay Mother His beard cobwebs  In that long horrid pause Good night he said Entered and clicked the gate Each to his bed  Do not sigh or fear Dicky How is it right To grudge the dead their ghostly dark And wan moonlight  We have the glorious sun Lamp and fireside Grudge not the dead their moonshine When abroad they ride   HAWK AND BUCKLE  Where is the landlord of old Hawk and Buckle And what of Master Straddler this hot summer weather He s along in the tap room with fat cheeks a chuckle And ten bold companions all drinking together  Where is the daughter of old Hawk and Buckle And what of Mistress Jenny this hot summer weather She sits in the parlor with smell of honeysuckle Trimming her bonnet with white ostrich feather  Where is the ostler of old Hawk and Buckle And what of Willy Dodger this hot summer weather He is rubbing his eyes with a slow and lazy knuckle As he wakes from his nap on a bank of fresh heather  Where is the page boy of old Hawk and Buckle And what of our young Charlie this hot summer weather He is bobbing for tiddlers in a little trickle truckle With his line and his hook and his breeches of leather  Where is the she goat of old Hawk and Buckle And what of pretty Nanny this hot summer weather She stays not contented with mickle or with muckle Straining for daisies at the end of her tether  For this is our motto at old Hawk and Buckle We cling to it close and we sing all together Every soul for himself at our old Hawk and Buckle And devil take the hindmost this hot summer weather   Robert Graves  TH E CUPBOARD  What s in that cupboard Mary  Which cupboard Mother dear  The cupboard of red mahogany With handles shining clear  That cupboard dearest Mother With shining crystal handles There s nought inside but rags and jags And yellow tallow candles  What s in that cupboard Mary  Which cupboard Mother mine That cupboard stands in your sunny chamber The silver corners shine  There s nothing there inside Mother But wool and thread and flax And bits of faded silk and velvet And candles of white wax  What s in that cupboard Mary And this time tell me true  White clothes for an unborn baby Mother But what s the truth to you  Robert Graves   WHIMSEYS  KALAMAZOO  Once in the city of Kalamazoo The gods went walking two and two With the friendly phoenix the stars of Orion The speaking pony and singing lion For in Kalamazoo in a cottage apart Lived the girl with the innocent heart  Thenceforth the city of Kalamazoo Was the envied intimate chum of the sun He rose from a cave by the principal street The lions sang the dawn horns blew And the ponies danced on silver feet He hurled his clouds of love around Deathless colors of his old heart Draped the houses and dyed the ground O shrine of the wide young Yankee land Incense city of Kalamazoo That held in the midnight the priceless sun As a jeweller holds an opal in hand  From the awkward city of Oshkosh came Love the bully no whip shall tame Bringing his gang of sinners bold And I was the least of his Oshkosh men But none were reticent none were old And we joined the singing phoenix then   Vachel Lindsay  And shook the lilies of Kalamazoo All for one hidden butterfly Bulls of glory in cars of war W e charged the boulevards proud to die For her ribbon sailing there on high Our blood set gutters all aflame Where the sun slept without any heat Cold rock till he must rise again She made great poets of wolf eyed men The dear queen bee of Kalamazoo With her crystal wings and her honey heart We fought for her favors a year and a day Oh the bones of the dead the Oshkosh dead That were scattered along her pathway red And then in her harum scarum way She left with a passing traveller man With a singing Irishman Went to Japan  Why do the lean hyenas glare Where the glory of Artemis had begun Of Atalanta Joan of Arc Cinderella Becky Thatcher And Orphant Annie all in one Who burned this city of Kalamazoo Till nothing was left but a ribbon or two One scorched phoenix that mourned in the dew Acres of ashes a junk man s cart A torn up letter a dancing shoe   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And the bones of the dead the dead Who burned this city of Kalamazoo Love town Troy town Kalamazoo  A harum scarum innocent heart  THE MODEST JAZZ BIRD  The Jazz bird sings a barnyard song A cock a doodle bray A jingle bells a boiler works A he man s roundelay  The eagle said My noisy son I send you out to fight So the youngster spread his sunflower wings And roared with all his might  His headlight eyes went flashing From Oregon to Maine And the land was dark with airships In the darting Jazz bird s train  Crossing the howling ocean His bell mouth shook the sky And the Yankees in the trenches Gave back the hue and cry  And Europe had not heard the like And Germany went down The fowl of steel with clashing claws Tore off the Kaiser s crown   Vachel Lindsay  DAVY JONES DOOR BELL  A Chant for Boys with Manly Voices Every line sung one step deeper than the line preceding  Any sky bird sings  Ring ring  Any church chime rings  Dong ding  Any cannon says  Boom bang  Any whirlwind says  Whing whang  The bell buoy hums and roars  Ding dong  And way down deep Where fishes throng By Davy Jones big deep sea door  Shaking the ocean s flowery floor His door bell booms  Dong dong Dong dong  Deep deep down  Clang boom Boom dong  THE CONSCIENTIOUS DEACON  A song to be syncopated as you please  Black cats grey cats green cats miau Chasing the deacon who stole the cow   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He runs and tumbles he tumbles and runs He sees big white men with dogs and guns  He falls down flat He turns to stare No cats no dogs and no men there  But black shadows grey shadows green shadows come The wind says Miau and the rain says Hum  He goes straight home He dreams all night He howls He puts his wife in a fright  Black devils grey devils green devils shine Yes by Sambo And the fire looks fine Cat devils dog devils cow devils grin Yes by Sambo And the fire rolls in  And so next day to avoid the worst He takes that cow Where he found her first  THE HORRID VOICE OF SCIENCE  There s machinery in the butterfly There s a mainspring to the bee There s hydraulics to a daisy And contraptions to a tree  If we could see the birdie That makes the chirping sound   Vachel Lindsay  With x ray scientific eyes W e could see the wheels go round  And I hope all men Who think like this Will soon lie Underground  MY LADY IS COMPARED TO A YOUNG TREE  When I see a young tree In its white beginning With white leaves And white buds Barely tipped with green In the April weather In the weeping sunshine Then I see my lady My democratic queen Standing free and equal With the youngest woodland sapling Swaying singing in the wind Delicate and white Soul so near to blossom Fragile strong as death A kiss from far off Eden A flash of Judgment s trumpet April s breath  Vachel Lindsay  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  EDITORIAL AMENITIES  OWADAYS we are frequently reminded of the poetic renaissance as the journalese of the day puts it Apparently this renaissance has admittedly arrived for its initial creative stage has already yielded so fast do we travel in this motor era to the secondary critical stage when a multiplicity of books are written about it and about Mr Lowes Convention and Revolt Mr Untermeyer s New Era Mrs Wilkinson s New Voices and a trail of volumes much less valuable volumes middling to worthless these offer amazing evidence that something has been going on during the past seven years since POETRY unlocked the gate  How misty and moss grown a gate it was in the autumn of 1912 few of the ardent spirits who rushed through need take the time to remember still less the editors and reviewers who ambled after them But now and then an incident reminds us A month ago for example the newspapers far and wide announced the award of the annual Pulitzer Prize for poetry to Carl Sandburg and Margaret Widdemer The truth is of course that there is no Pulitzer Prize for poetry that when Joseph Pulitzer a most representative American died in 1911 poetry was so negligible and neglected that he did not recognize its existence as a modern art  Thus his will which enriched his School of Journalism at Columbia with one thousand dollar prizes for everything   Editorial Amenities  else under the sun for the best novel of the year the best play the best editorial etc committed the absurdity of omitting the highest of the literary arts When the newspapers unconsciously try to rectify his error by giving his name to a prize for which Mr Wheeler president of the  P S A with great difficulty secured the cash they are merely acknowledging the absurdity of the omission If Mr Pulitzer had died a few years later he not only would not but could not have made the mistake by that time poetry was in the air the great journalist like all the world would have had to breathe it and in his will its name like Abou ben Adhem s would have led all the rest  If POETRY opened the gate and carried the banner through it has not kept its lead without numerous challenges Every month or two a new special magazine is born and we welcome it to the field on the principle of the more the merrier for the field is large and no one magazine can gather all the harvest It doesn t afflict us much if the newcomers show ignorance or at least a polite disregard of our presence or turn upon us from their various eastern points of vantage each a coldly superior eye  Contemporary Verse thus appoints itself the best of the poetry magazines to the joy of the sapient New Republic which weary of its own too numerous editors attributes this self confessed supremacy to C V s lack of either editorship or standards And the modest Philadelphia monthly proceeds thus to corner the market and obliterate the rest of us Contemporary Verse alone of the new poetry magazines   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  endeavors to express broadly and simply the best phases of American idealism  Youth announces with appropriate enthusiasm For a long time there has been felt the need of a magazine which would do for the allied countries in the field of poetry what our Governments are doing in the political realm as if POETRY had not printed poems from sixteen nations of the old and new worlds and Youth had been appointed official spokesman of neglected peoples  And The Lyric or The Lyric Society proclaiming itself the only American organization devoted to the interests of the vision bearers of America undertakes the job of organizing the readers of poetry at five dollars a year apiece have we not been trying for years to do it for two and even offers to buy three books a year at five hundred per to fill three poets pockets promising to distribute their editions to subscribers those coy poetry lovers who like Viola are too prone to conceal their love  All these and others yes and Others our gayest contemporary which has always loyally concealed its despair over our old fogeyism all these and others whether they like us or not may be less rivals than aids every banner means a new ally in support of the Cause They are helping to spread the gospel to gather the great audience By hammering away in school or college and out in print and by word of mouth they we may at last make the great world understand that a poet has a right like other artists to live by his art that the art requires public recognition and sup   Editorial Amenities  port even to the point of numerous prizes scholarships free club houses or institutes even to the point of eager publishers selling many editions  And what of the critics What of the literary editors Are they doing their share they whose function it is not only to give the public what it wants but gently to make the public want what it should Mostly they are full of good will genuine even when puzzled but they don t express it often enough or loud enough They don t give each of our numbers a column and a half review and call upon the reading public to weigh each new poet in scales of  gold And sometimes he the critic knows it all with a finality which is the despair of specialists Most people admit that adequate criticism of a symphony a painting an edifice of an airplane a locomotive or even a rag doll requires not only special aptitude but a certain preparatory training But any typewriter strummer who has read Hiawatha in the eighth grade thinks himself fully equipped as a critic of poetry quite competent to denounce all the poets of this century and enforce his anathema by contrasting them with Shakespeare and Keats or even with David and Solomon  Every day the mail brings us expert testimony of this kind not only from Podunk but from Philadelphia and even London And we who hare specialized in this subject for years stand convicted of wilful idiocy before a larger public than we can hope to reach with our side of the story  At a banquet recently given in Chicago Congressman James R Mann that noble pillar of the past referred with   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  illuminating candor to the old order which has temporarily passed away But there are moss backs in poetry who would scorn to admit that the old order has passed away even temporarily moss backs who stoutly deny that the poets of this age of enormous change may have things to say and ways of saying them quite different from those immortalized by the masters of the past H M  THE POETRY OF THE FUTURE  Now that the war is over the world s youth is approaching freedom again still weary perhaps with the struggle but with an intense eagerness for life And out of this intensity should grow poetry not perhaps large in bulk but yet enough for us to be able to say to future generations We hooligans who fought for those long years in the mud and in spiritual darkness could yet make a few songs to test your emulation  I do not know what form this poetry will take very possibly the great living poets of to day are in poverty and obscurity unknown to any of us But I do know what form I should like it to take I know the sort of poetry I should like to see written by this generation a generation which has not been altogether ignoble  First of all I want this poetry to be aristocratic not in any trivial monarchical or plutocratic sense but in the root sense as the free equal citizens of a Greek republic were aristocrats It must be the expression of distinguished minds in a distinguished manner The republic of letters can   The Poetry of the Future  have no use for Bolshevism though all within its boundaries are equal it cultivates good manners and at least avoids scrupulously those whose presumption leads them to assume a capability they do not possess  Secondly I want this poetry to be human There is no excuse for affectations or prejudices or any sort of narrowmindedness I want to see human nature expressed by people who are sensitive enough to sympathize with it and talented enough to express it I am so utterly weary of the little person who has never lived never loved passionately never hated never seen death never known anguish or gaiety or any real emotion so weary of that person s little rhymes or vers libre The coal miner who says It s bloody in them bloody mines is more of a poet and a coal miner who could express to us adequately the real emotions of his life would be a poet He would be ipso facto a citizen of the aristocratic republic  Thirdly I want this poetry to be competent Doesn t everyone know the poet who by some slight eccentricity of clothing or behavior convinces himself that he is different And who moreover is far less competent at his job than any of the merely industrial people he dares to despise Try and make a table without learning how try and drill a company without learning how and observe the mess Are we to assume that poetry which is almost the most difficult thing in the world to create can be created without knowing how I said before Poetry has no rules but a poet must know how his predecessors achieved their results he must find out for himself how it was that   the poets he admires obtained the effects which move him If he does nothing else he will achieve the negative result of knowing what not to do These people in the past did not just say to themselves Tiens I will be a poet c est une idée and then sit down and produce the Ode to a Nightingale or the Ballade de la belle Héaulmière There was of course that indefinable thing we call genius to begin with but there was also the conscious work the conception of poetry as an art  Fourthly I want to see this poetry individual I want about it that personal flavor which is a guarantee of sincerity If we hear someone read Swinburne or Heine we know at once that one master only could have written this we know it by the feel of the thing the music the personality behind it I should like the future to be as sure about the poets of to day as we are sure of the great men of the past  Fifthly I should like to see this poetry develop along the lines which it has taken in the past few years I should like to see all the possibilities of vers libre explored and exploited I should like to see it richer more controlled more shapely I should like it to express all the moods and emotions of men the cities of to day no less than the glory that was Greece the things that are steadfast as well as the things that fade I should like to see vers libre developed in competent hands into a varied medium as lovely as the old poetry was lovely but more virile more essentially artistic should like also to have the capabilities of our language for the writing of quantative verse tested and experimented upon   The Poetry of the Future  by poets who are also musicians as the Elizabethans were And in conclusion I should like the impossible an interested public with sufficient taste to know if a work is well or badly written sufficient liberality of mind to appreciate novelty when it has talent and sufficient liberality of purse to afford its poets at least as much remuneration as its boot blacks and policemen Richard Aldington  REVIEWS  CONVENTION AND REVOLT  Convention and Revolt in Poetry by John Livingston Lowes  Houghton Mifflin Co  In the last few years so much has been written in defense of radicalism in poetry so much has been said of the hampering restrictions of what is regarded as conventional conservative verse that now perhaps it becomes necessary to defend the classics against what we may call the New Academism of the radicals Such a defense although of course the classics do not really need defense they are permanent and defy abuse has now been prepared by Mr Lowes What he has done is to reinstate the classics as the radicals of their day and age to show that conventions are created by usage and acceptance but that as these conventions cease to be inspired by the breath of life they must be discarded or rehabilitated and new ones created in their place He has thus shown that although revolt has always the aspect of novelty and complete modernism it is historically ancient and re   current in the great tradition of verse It is no yawning gulf no precipice incapable of being jumped or bridged and cutting off all approach from the rear or front It is rather a law of growth to be balked at the cost of life itself It is evident therefore at the outset that Mr Lowes is not out of sympathy with the radicals nor yet unduly startled or alarmed by them At the same time he is not without a background as too many critics of modern verse have been especially many of the radicals themselves and the wisdom inspired by this background has given him a wise tolerance and even temper in discussing his subject too often lacking in partisan criticism of the present new movement  Beginning with the roots of convention which are of the essence of art itself the acceptance of illusion rather than the experience or fact the need of a communicative medium the use of the symbol for the thing then examining the growth and decay of conventions the question of how far originality may dispense with or accept conventions the inevitability of reaction Mr Lowes goes on to consider in detail the problems of poetic diction rhyme metre and vers libre prose and verse rhythms the incursions of prose and other important phases of the subject in relation both to the tradition and to the new poetry finishing with a chapter on the Anglo Saxon tradition  One of the most interesting and provocative of all his chapters is that on Rhyme Metre and Vers Libre in which he shows that the restrictions of metrical verse are far less than the inexpert might imagine Here his distinction be   Convention and Revolt  tween the two rhythms of verse that follows a regular metric pattern or rather his exposition of these two rhythms is more clearly stated than I have ever seen it elsewhere After admitting that metrical verse imposed restrictions upon the freedom of ordinary speech which is merely to say in other words that verse is a convention of art whose very essence is restraint he goes on to show that this restraint is not after all unduly rigid as follows  Now there is a fundamental fact which the protestants if I understand them overlook Upon the length or the development of the larger infinitely varying rhythmic units metre does not impose any limitations whatever These are free They are merely taken up into and merged with another rhythmic movement Let me make clearer what I mean The movement of regular verse is a resultant a resolution of two rhythms one of which taken alone tends towards restraint There is in verse on the one hand the metrical unit that is to say for our present purpose the line There is on the other hand what we may designate as the sentence rhythm or cadence If the line length and the sentence rhythm uniformly coincide as they do in some of Pope s couplets for example we get monotony deadly and intolerable If there is only the sentence cadence without the beat of the line there is variety but it is merely the variety of your speech and mine when charged with emotion in varying degrees Metrical verse that is not sheer doggerel is built upon the harmony of both Behind the endlessly weaving rhythms  of the sentence cadences beats steadily in the best verse unobtrusively the rhythm of the line  By this too it may be seen why verse that scans accurately may yet have no rhythm whatever a fact too generally ignored by the prosodists  It is unfortunate that one has not the space for a complete exposition of Mr Lowe s book particularly one would like to dwell on his chapter Originality and Conventions in which he shows that originality consists in its power to re   create beauty out of old conventions quite as much or more than in its power of invention The supreme test of originality is its power to give us the sense of a footing on trodden and familiar ground which all at once is recognized as unexplored One would like to quote at length many passages equally illuminating and suggestive but one can only conclude with the advice to all poetry lovers radicals and conservatives alike to read the book themselves It has but one fault the bad habit of indulging in quotations to illustrate a point when such quotation is unnecessary and really detracts from rather than enforces the statement but this is a very minor annoyance  Mr Lowes has covered many if not all the points under discussion during the last few years he has gone over the battlefield without omitting any of the scars and with full recognition of the strategic merits of both sides He renders no decision and although one instinctively feels that his taste is conservative it is a very liberal conservatism and he accepts willingly and enthusiastically all that the radicals have to offer Indeed he is even a little too timid and temperate about expressing himself on just what the new poetry may add or fail to add to the great tradition W e are too near he says to judge our contemporaries A hundred years from now the good will have been sifted from the bad The happy lecturer will find the house swept and garnished and will have the simple task of discoursing on the early twentieth century classics but I shall not anticipate his list But that is just what we wish Mr Lowes would   Convention and Revolt  do Why the timidity Certainly it is not shared by Mr Lowes confrère Professor Phelps of Yale who has manifestly failed at the job Mr Lowes on the contrary has shown himself in this book abundantly qualified to furnish us with just what is so sorely needed disinterested fresh purely aesthetic competent and therefore authoritative criticism of the poets who are writing today Must we have  only Griswolds and worse for the unhappy lecturer of a hundred years hence to refer to Now that Mr Lowes has prepared this excellent general groundwork we wish that he would go on and give us a series of lectures in like detail on the subject of our contemporaries  A C H  A PRIZE WINNER  The Old Road to Paradise by Margaret Widdemer Henry  Holt amp Co  One is tempted to examine this book with unusual care because it has just received the emphasis of a prize Or let us say half a prize perhaps an even greater honor since thus Miss Widdemer s name is paired with Carl Sandburg s For this book and Cornhuskers as we announced last month divided the prize of five hundred dollars awarded by the Poetry Society of America and Columbia University for the best book of verse published in 1918 a circumstance which reminded us that POETRY had not yet reviewed it  The book contains much graceful verse and a few lyrics of higher quality songs which lack only the final poignancy   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  to lift their too cultivated feeling into passion their ripple of music into magic The best in my opinion are the love song I did not know from POETRY for October 1917 the simple and moving Prayer for the New Year save for an agonizing error of grammar The Dark Cavalier Interim Garden Dream and Poem for a Picture of children at play on a French battlefield of which we quote the beginning and end  When I was a child You shall tell one day Children on these blackened fields Gallantly at play All the quiet sky Burst in death aflame One day I was young Then the Horror came  Dauntless in your rags Insolent in mirth Laughing with young lips that know All the griefs of earth God who loves a high heart well Will not let you fail You are France who laughs at Hell France who shall prevail  Is the book prize worthy Well hardly since the prize would not only try to level it with Cornhuskers but to lift it above Mr Masters Toward the Gulf and Mr Aiken s Charnel Rose besides a number of books in more radical forms Miss Lowell s Can Grande s Castle Sherwood Anderson s Mid American Chants Dr Williams Al Que Quiere Wallace Gould s Children of the Sun and others   A Prize winner  With few of these books would Miss Widdemer s stand any chance in a properly arranged professional competition In the whole volume she says nothing new nor does she say anything old in a new manner or a manner convincingly spontaneous and personal Her book is full of echoes echoes from the Celtic from old balladry from The Shropshire Lad and poets even more modern and now and then one detects the tinsel quality of assumed emotion an offer ing up of the popular thing to a public too easily pleased as in The Singing Wood and Other People The book is indeed too much what the public wants so many war poems so many love songs a few about fauns and elves and Pierrette and a young girl s dreaming with now and then deep thoughts of death and worshipful salutations of God Everywhere the accepted thing the usual emotion and melody never an original or adventurous idea never a pang of wild joy or bitter suffering never a strain of strange and haunting music The award of a prize or even half a prize to this book shows that at least one mind and a half of the committee of three prefers to keep the American muse in a proper and submissive conventional mood  It may be objected that the old subjects love war death dreams are the perpetual stuff of poetry and are likely to be to the end of time Yes but they must be hunted and captured anew by each individual singer they cannot be taken from another hand or passed over a counter No butterfly s wing so easily loses its freshness at an alien touch It is not a question of form the simplest old forms will do   Some of Orrick Johns country rhymes Sara Teasdale s best love songs Edna Millay s wistful little lyrics have this quick pang in them which Miss Widdemer s just miss It is a thing difficult to define but it makes all the difference  H M  IRONICS LIGHT AND DARK  Ironica by Donald Evans Nicholas L Brown New York  Like a proud parrot preening his feathers is the art of Donald Evans smooth showy adroit fifth generation tropical chained to a northern perch Its ornamental green andscarlet though a bit quaint in these after the war days has not quite lost its flare let us shake the dust off one or two Ironica to prove it  Her breath suspired in a little sigh  Of plausive aspect with upturned eye She begged a boon from Him on high A softer breeze for her butterfly  Or this one  He held his stick as though it were a sword He held his head as though he were the Word He held his mouth as though he had been heard He held his eyes as though naught had occurred  The irony is not always so light as this in fact At the Bar the twenty four page poem which opens the book misses the poignancy of tragic narrative by only a hair sbreadth perhaps by only a certain deft elegance of touch as though one should search a battlefield in a dress suit The end of the story is just a bit too neatly turned for the larger amenities of perfect art   Ironies Light and Dark  Almost Mr Evans persuades us back into the fin de siècle nineties Yet he is aware of the new era far faintly aware of change For he greets it at the end of this book in this  Bonfire of Kings  Kingship is passing down the yellow road And crowns are dangling from the willow tree Royalty flees to seek a last abode With the other outcasts of eternity The palaces are burning for bad kings Have brought the breaking of the whitest dream That man has ever dreamt imaginings That bathed the throne with a diviner gleam The mob is jigging to a ribald air That mocks the dying pulse of sovereignty Humanity is singing everywhere All men are equal Dupes of democracy  In a small pamphlet The Art of Donald Evans N L Brown Cornwall Hollies plays up his subject with rather naive exaggeration H M  JOURNEYMEN POETS  The Madman by Kahlil Gibran Alfred A Knopf Lanterns in Gethsemane by Willard Wattles E P Dutton amp Co A Family Album by Alter Brody B W Huebsch Outcasts in Beulah Land by Roy Helton Henry Holt amp Co  City Tides by Archie Austin Coates George H Doran Co There be books that I have heard praised and that highly I am tempted to apply to certain volumes Hamlet s   splenetic remarks about certain players for in spite of the approval of megaphonic critics I have thought that some of Nature s journeymen had made them instead of true sons of the muses  Thus I confess myself something of a skeptic in regard to Kahlil Gibran whose parables and poems in poetic prose have been conspicuously printed and praised His book shows an adroit use of parallelism and a rather oriental sounding symbolism cleverly applied to modern affairs and points of view Perhaps the best of it is in such a parable as God which presents the gradual change from fear to love in mankind s ideal of worship or in the irony of The Sleepwalkers or The Perfect World which touch off prevalent insincerities But the symbolism is too expository and its high sounding easy wisdom too often boils down into platitudes The book annoys by its prosy and somewhat pompous triteness as in The Greater Sea or this briefer parable  The Good God and the Evil God met on the mountain top  The Good God said Good day to you brother  The Evil God made no answer  And the Good God said You are in a bad humor today  Yes said the Evil God for of late I have been often mistaken for you called by your name and treated as if I were you and it ill pleases me  And the Good God said But I too have been mistaken for you and called by your name  The Evil God walked away cursing the stupidity of man  If Auguste Rodin actually called this Syrian poet the William Blake of the twentieth century as the slip cover reports I can only smile in remembering from personal   Journeymen Poets  acquaintance with the great Frenchman his serene amiability toward all fellow artists and in this case it was the fellow artist the limner not the poet that Rodin s alleged remark must have referred to But even Mr Gibran s drawings though much more interesting than his parables are a long way off from William Blake  Willard Wattles has written a few fine lyrics there are even one or two especially The Builders I in Lanterns in Gethsemane But as a rule the religious poems in this volume do not escape triteness of sentiment or attain poetic beauty of form or phrase The long philosophizing Christ monologues are particularly ineffective whether uttered by or to the Man of Nazareth and that sermon on the war The Seventh Vial escapes prosiness in only a couplet or two  Two or three poems and those brief ones attain something like lyric expression of a fresh and personal devotional mood Prayer and one or two quatrains and this Absolution  Once I was bound in slavery But now my sins have set me free  No matter what the songs have sung It is my sins have kept me young  When cruelly my heart inclined  My own dead sins have made me kind  It s some are blind and some are wise  But only sins have gentle eyes  Twas little recked the brittle thong  When my sins woke to shake me strong And when I face the certain grave It is my sins have made me brave    In Heaven beside the jasper sea The sins of Christ will pardon me Louis Untermeyer stands sponsor for Alter Brody s Family Album both in his introduction to the book itself and in his own critical volume The New Era and one may sympathize with his ascribing to Mr Brody sincerity and sensitivity and keen racial feeling a distinctly personal experience and point of view The trouble is nowhere in this book of carefully lined up free verse can one trace a poet s instinct for poetic rhythm and rarely a poetic quality of imagination The line divisions are purely empirical the book has the feeling and movement of prose from beginning to end Sometimes the prose is vivid as in A Sunlit Room sometimes tiresome as in The Neurological Institute but however reflective or descriptive it escapes the musical magic of poetry Here for example is Lamentations which Mr Untermeyer especially praises but here printed without disguise  In a dingy kitchen facing a Ghetto backyard an old woman is chanting Jeremiah s Lamentations quaveringly out of a Hebrew Bible  The gaslight flares and falls   This night two thousand years ago Jerusalem fell and the Temple was burned Tonight this white haired Jewess sits in her kitchen and chants by the banks of the Hudson the Lament of the Prophet  The gaslight flares and falls   Nearby locked in her room her daughter lies on a bed convulsively sobbing Her face is dug in the pillows her shoulders heave with her sobs the bits of a photograph lie on the dresser   Roy Helton is another of Mr Untermeyer s favorites at least he is accorded a few leaves of laurel if not a wreath   Journeymen Poets  complete like Mr Brody s An analysis of Outcasts in Beulah Land if we had time and space might be fruitful in revelations of the difference between the real thing and a facile imitation Mr Helton as the accommodating slipcover confesses writes of beggars and millionaires shopgirls and ladies honest folk and thieves the here and the hereafter all with engaging impartiality And his art reverses the magic of the alchemist for everything he touches turns to tinsel  If Mr Brody s free versified prose is fraught with a message from the ghetto that of Archie Austin Coates carries  no such burden Neither rhyme nor the newer forms can make anything but journalism out of the lightly satirical poems in City Tides The touch is not deft and delicate enough to lift any of them to the graceful immortality of a vers de société anthology All this in spite of the fact that POETRY once gave a page to Lavender for which may the muses forgive us In spite also of Mr Charles Hanson Towne whose Introduction hails Mr Coates as a new poet of the city wise with a wisdom beyond his years blest with vision and comprehension H M  ANTHOLOGIES  There must be a large public for poetry or the crop of anthologies would not outrun as it does the capacity of this magazine It is out of the question to review adequately indeed well nigh impossible to mention all the verse collec   tions many of them narrowly specialized which reach this office There is Your Dog and My Dog for example  Houghton Mifflin Co with dog poems from Byron and Scott to W M Letts but incomplete since it omits Orrick Johns who writes the most doggy dog poems in the language There is To Mother same publisher which introduced by Kate Douglas Wiggin and reinforced by Whistler s familiar portrait offers a round hundred poems of filial or maternal devotion There are Mrs Waldo Richards High Tide and Melody of Earth also the Boston firm the one sub titled Songs of Joy and Vision and the other Garden and Nature Poems which with singular catholicity of somewhat sentimentalized taste gather together good bad and indifferent poems of today in an amiable effort to increase the cheerfulness of the world  And there is no end to the war anthologies Six or eight of them POETRY reviewed in August 1917 and 1918 but many others are on sale or in press One is War Poems from the Yale Review Yale University Press with nineteen poems from seventeen poets Frost Masefield Fletcher Letts Untermeyer Noyes etc some of them good but none of supreme authority Another is Humanity or Hate Which Cornhill Co German and French war songs translated into rather perfunctory rhymes and contrasted as symptomatic of the German Soul and the French Soul by Harvey C Grumbine The War in Verse and Prose T S Denison amp Co Chicago is a collection of floating newspaper verse mostly collected by W D Eaton in order to preserve   Anthologies  its popularity And Carnegie Tech War Verse is an ingratiating little pamphlet by Professor Haniel Long s doughboy students led by Francis F Hogan and Richard Mansfield II who both died in service  Then there are the more inclusive student anthologies all containing promising work all showing a wide spread activity and interest among undergraduates whether the various faculties sympathize or not The most comprehensive of these is The Poets of the Future edited by Henry T Schnittkind Stratford Co which has now reached its second biennial volume gathering its interesting material from the various college periodicals An English effort to introduce and stimulate youthful talent is the Oxford Poetry annuals  B H Blackwell The same enterprising publisher of old Oxford gives us also At a Venture Poems by Eight Writers also once a year or so a small volume called Wheels which is a brief collection of poems by the newly emerging poets whom he delights to introduce  More familiar to our readers as representing the new poets or groups of them are the Georgian Verse anthologies Poetry Bookshop London of which three volumes have now been issued Some Imagist Poets the much discussed three annuals Houghton Mifflin Co the very intriguing Others anthologies representing the radicals Alfred A Knopf of which A Pagan Anthology Pagan Pub Co  N Y is a far away faint echo and Mr Braithwaite s annual Anthology of Magazine Verse Small Maynard amp Co with its over generous inclusions and its empirical   Baedeker like exactitudes of stars and double and triple stars to aid the innocent seeker for poetic treasure And last but not least we must not omit our own indispensable anthology The New Poetry Macmillan Co already in its eighth edition  And the local collections like The Chicago Anthology The Book of New York Verse and Sunflowers Willard Wattles Kansas anthology these already reviewed as well as the more recent Golden Songs of the Golden State  A C McCIurg amp Co selected by Marguerite Wilkinson to present the claims of California And Notre Dame Verse perhaps belongs here though its locale is a university and the poets are its alumni Now that the procession of states and towns has begun there can be no end to it  We have also subject anthologies like the all inclusive Book of Lincoln George H Doran Co and Christ in the Poetry of Today Woman s Press  As for more general anthologies they also are numerous Volume V of Thomas Humphry Ward s The English Poets Macmillan Co is now ready with British and Canadian selections from Browning to Rupert Brooke but including no one now living a collection whose first volume was issued long ago with a general introduction by Matthew Arnold Also each poet gets a special critical introduction written by some more or less noted admirer  One wonders what is the principle of selection in a book like this but whatever it is any modern poet may take comfort to find so much trivial and stodgy verse dug out of the   Anthologies  past and set up in the company of its betters for even second rate modern stuff is more alive and less wordy than much of this volume Why disinter Richard Watson Dixon for example or Thomas Gordon Hake or Sir Francis Doyle Baronet Our old Victorian friends are represented by their more familiar poems and one new friend William Barnes is well worth while whether he writes in plain English or the difficult Dorsetshire dialect  A comprehensive anthology of four thousand pages representing almost everybody from the Elizabethans to the Imagists is The Home Book of Verse Henry Holt amp Co This was originally published in 1912 with the idea of reprinting in ten years But the editor Mr Burton Egbert Stevenson now explains that the recent astonishing renaissance in English and American poetry made imperative the present new edition and he has inserted many of the new poets among their elders for the book is arranged according to subjects In spite of its sentimental title this anthology which is well indexed seems a pretty good thing of its all inclusive kind  And there are period anthologies like Samuel White Patterson s Spirit of the American Revolution as Revealed in the Poetry of the Period a competent study with extensive quotations Another of these much more inviting is an admirable collection of fourteenth to seventeenth century English verse called Corn from Olde Fieldes John Lane Co reviewed in POETRY for May  This brings us to our concluding group of anthologies   the translations some of which are valuable The present keen interest in Chinese art of all kinds has compelled E P Dutton amp Co to reprint The Lute of Jade L Cranmer Byng s well known and on the whole excellent renderings of Chinese classics and we have also James Whitall s recent  versions through the French of Judith Gautier in Chinese Lyrics from the Book of Jade B W Huebsch and the admirable new translations by Arthur Waley 170 Chinese Poems of which Alfred A Knopf has just issued an American edition a book which demands separate attention Wholly admirable are Mrs Livesay s vivid Songs of Ukraina  E P Dutton amp Co long since praised in POETRY Less important than these because less vitally translated though still interesting as opening windows into other lands are Armenian Poems translated by Alice Blackwell Robert Chambers Boston and sold for the Fund for Armenian Relief A Harvest of German Verse done with sympathy and sometimes with distinction by Margarete Münsterberg D Appleton amp Co and Charles Wharton Stork s rather perfunctory Anthology of Swedish Lyrics American Scandinavian Foun  dation New York From this too brief summary our readers will perceive that almost any kind of verse collection in English in almost any department of the art is now at their disposal And we cannot close without saying a good word for the two volume collection of modern French poems Poètes d Aujourd hui published in Paris by the Mercure de France and now in its eighteenth edition H M   Villon Again  VILLON AGAIN  The Jargon of Master François Villon by Jordan Herbert  Stabler Houghton Mifflin Co  This book is in large octavo printed in rare type on handmade paper and its pages are decorated with beautiful borders and quaint pictorial initials The first half of the book is given to the English translations the second half to the original French versions of these seven ballads Mr Stabler is to be congratulated upon the zeal with which he conducted his researches into the realms of the well nigh impossible and upon the artistic quality of his results  The church loves a sinner As a good man his dinner  and so François Villon has lived for us through more than four centuries and a half not only through his verses but in fiction and out off the stage and on in the character of the gentleman burglar clever cultivated often arrested and with always a friend at court to save his neck from the noose The author tells us that the seven ballads appear to be advice and warning Sermons they have been called to his companions the brothers of La Coquille and that they are supposed to have been written about the year 1461 But sermons would seem to be a somewhat equivocal term in which to speak of these ballads Warning is certainly sounded for Villon knew well whereof he wrote and could paint the hangman in vivid colors But the advice   he gives is mostly an urging of caution upon thieves in their manner of thieving as in this fragment  And now for this Beware beware Companions robbers thieves and all And for the trysting place take care Where rests the band within your call Who seeks to rob by acts too bold Will not succeed as well as he Who lays his plans with care I m told To trick the ones less wise than he But ofttimes they are tricksters too And archers also wear disguise And ye are caught and hung tis true By those ye rob who are too wise  Envoi  Prince beware hard times come fast  Take all that comes before your eyes  Be not imprisoned at the last  By those ye rob who are too wise  According to Mr Stabler the jargon of Villon in these seven ballads was probably known only to the friends of the Coquillards to whom they were addressed And this seems to be more than probable For a comparison of this with the language employed in his other verses for instance in Le Petit Testament Le Dit de la Naissance de Marie Le Grand Testament etc shows the latter to have been written in the current French of Villon s period while these seven ballads are so veiled in his peculiar slang as to be almost incomprehensible The author admits that much of it is impossible to translate and that this is why he has been so free in bis English Agnes Lee Freer   NOTES  All but two of this month s contributors have appeared before
