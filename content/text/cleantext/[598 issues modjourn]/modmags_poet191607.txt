two negroes and a girl  The scene represents a forest of heavy trees on a hilltop in eastern Pennsylvania To the right is a road obscured by bushes It is about  four o clock of a morning in August at the present time  When the curtain rises the stage is dark The limb of a tree creaks A negro carrying a lantern passes along the road The sound is repeated The negro comes through the bushes raises his lantern and looks through the trees Discerning a dark object among the branches he shrinks back crosses stage and goes out through the wood to the left  A second negro comes through the bushes to the right He carries two large baskets which he places on the ground just inside of the bushes Enter three Chinese one of whom carries a lantern They pause on the road  Copyright 1916 by Wallace Stevens dramatic rights reserved   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Second Chinese All you need To find poetry Is to look for it with a lantern The Chinese laugh  Third Chinese I could find it without On an August night If I saw no more Than the dew on the barns  The Second Negro makes a sound to attract their attention The three Chinese come through the bushes The first is short fat quizzical and of middle age The second is of middle height thin and turning gray a man of sense and sympathy The third is a young man intent detached They wear European clothes  Second Chinese Glancing at the baskets  Dew is water to see  Not water to drink We have forgotten water to drink  Yet I am content Just to see sunrise again  I have not seen it  Since the day we left Pekin  It filled my doorway  Like whispering women  First Chinese And I have never seen it  If we have no water  Do find a melon for me  In the baskets   Three Travelers Watch a Sunrise  The Second Negro who has been opening the baskets  hands the First Chinese a melon First Chinese Is there no spring The negro takes a water bottle of red porcelain from  one of the baskets and places it near the Third Chinese Second Chinese To Third Chinese Your porcelain water bottle  One of the baskets contains costumes of silk red blue and green During the following speeches the Chinese put on these costumes with the assistance of the negro and seat themselves on the ground  Third Chinese This fetches its own water Takes the bottle and places it on the ground in the center of the stage  I drink from it dry as it is As you from maxims To Second Chinese Or you from melons To First Chinese  First Chinese Not as I from melons  Be sure of that Second Chinese Well it is true of maxims He finds a book in the pocket of his costume and reads  from it  The court had known poverty and wretchedness humanity had invaded its seclusion with its suffering and its pity  The limb of the tree creaks  Yes it is true of maxims Just as it is true of poets   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Or wise men or nobles Or jade First Chinese Drink from wise men From jade Is there no spring  Turning to the negro who has taken a jug from one of the baskets  Fill it and return  The negro removes a large candle from one of the baskets and hands it to the First Chinese then takes the jug and the lantern and enters the trees to the left The First Chinese lights the candle and places it on the ground near the water bottle  Third Chinese There is a seclusion of porcelain  That humanity never invades First Chinese With sarcasm Porcelain Third Chinese It is like the seclusion of sunrise  Before it shines on any house First Chinese Pooh Second Chinese This candle is the sun  This bottle is earth It is an illustration Used by generations of hermits The point of difference from reality Is this That in this illustration The earth remains of one color It remains red It remains what it is   But when the sun shines on the earth In reality It does not shine on a thing that remains What it was yesterday The sun rises On whatever the earth happens to be  Third Chinese And there are indeterminate moments Before it rises Like this With a backward gesture Before one can tell What the bottle is going to be Porcelain Venetian glass Egyptian Well there are moments When the candle sputtering up Finds itself in seclusion He raises the candle in the air And shines perhaps for the beauty of shining That is the seclusion of sunrise Before it shines on any house Replacing the candle  First Chinese Wagging his head As abstract as porcelain  Second Chinese Such seclusion knows beauty As the court knew it The court woke In its windless pavilions And gazed on chosen mornings As it gazed On chosen porcelain   What the court saw was always of the same color And well shaped And seen in a clear light He points to the candle It never woke to see And never knew The flawed jars The weak colors The contorted glass It never knew The poor lights He opens his book significantly When the court knew beauty only And in seclusion It had neither love nor wisdom These came through poverty And wretchedness Through suffering and pity He pauses It is the invasion of humanity That counts  The limb of the tree creaks The First Chinese turns for a moment in the direction of the sound First Chinese Thoughtfully The light of the most tranquil candle Would shudder on a bloody salver Second Chinese With a gesture of disregard It is the  invasion That counts If it be supposed that we are three figures Painted on porcelain   Three Travelers Watch a Sunrise  As we sit here That we are painted on this very bottle The hermit of the place Holding this candle to us Would wonder But if it be supposed That we are painted as warriors The candle would tremble in his hands Or if it be supposed for example That we are painted as three dead men He could not see the steadiest light For sorrow It would be true If an emperor himself Held the candle He would forget the porcelain For the figures painted on it  Third Chinese Shrugging his shoulders Let the candle  shine for the beauty of shining I dislike the invasion And long for the windless pavilions And yet it may be true That nothing is beautiful Except with reference to ourselves Nor ugly Nor high Pointing to the sky Nor low Pointing to the candle No not even sunrise   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Can you play of this Mockingly to First Chinese For us He stands up First Chinese Hesitatingly I have a song Called Mistress and Maid It is of no interest to hermits Or emperors Yet it has a bearing For if we affect sunrise We affect all things  Third Chinese It is a pity it is of women Sing it  He takes an instrument from one of the baskets and hands it to the First Chinese who sings the following song accompanying himself somewhat tunelessly on the instrument The Third Chinese takes various things out of the basket for tea He arranges fruit The First Chinese watches him while he plays The Second Chinese gazes at the ground The sky shows the first signs of morning  First Chinese The mistress says in a harsh voice  He will be thinking in strange countries  Of the white stones near my door  And I I am tired of him She says sharply to her maid Sing to yourself no more  Then the maid says to herself He will be thinking in strange countries Of the white stones near her door   But it is me he will see At the window as before  He will be thinking in strange countries Of the green gown I wore He was saying good by to her  The maid drops her eyes and says to her miistress I shall sing to myself no more  Third Chinese That affects the white stones  To be sure They laugh First Chinese And it affects the green gown Second Chinese Here comes our black man The Second Negro returns somewhat agitated with  water but without his lantern He hands the jug to the Third Chinese The First Chinese from time to time strikes the instrument The Third Chinese who faces the left peers in the direction from which the negro has come  Third Chinese You have left your lantern behind you It shines among the trees Like evening Venus in a cloud top  The Second Negro grins but makes no explanation He seats himself behind the Chinese to the right  First Chinese Or like a ripe strawberry Among its leaves They laugh I heard tonight That they are searching the hill For an Italian He disappeared with his neighbor s daughter   Second Chinese Confidingly I am sure you heard The first eloping footfall And the drum Of pursuing feet  First Chinese Amusedly It was not an elopement The young gentleman was seen To climb the hill In the manner of a tragedian Who sweats Such things happen in the evening He was  Un misérable Second Chinese Reach the lady quickly The First Chinese strikes the instrument twice as a pre  lude to his narrative  First Chinese There are as many points of view From which to regard her As there are sides to a round bottle Pointing to the water  bottle  She was represented to me As beautiful  They laugh The First Chinese strikes the instrument and looks at the Third Chinese who yawns First Chinese Reciting She was as beautiful as a porcelain water bottle  He strikes the instrument in an insinuating manner First Chinese She was represented to me As young   Therefore my song should go Of the color of blood  He strikes the instrument The limb of the tree creaks The First Chinese notices it and puts his hand on the knee of the Second Chinese who is seated between him and the Third Chinese to call attention to the sound They are all seated so that they do not face the spot from which the sound comes A dark object hanging to the limb of the tree becomes a dim silhouette The sky grows constantly brighter No color is to be seen until the end of the play  Second Chinese To First Chinese It is only a tree Creaking in the night wind Third Chinese Shrugging his shoulders There would be no creaking In the windless pavilions First Chinese Resuming So far the lady of the present  ballad Would have been studied By the hermit and his candle With much philosophy And possibly the emperor would have cried More light But it is a way with ballads That the more pleasing they are The worse end they come to For here it was also represented That the lady was poor The hermit s candle would have thrown   Alarming shadows And the emperor would have held The porcelain in one hand She was represented as clinging To that sweaty tragedian And weeping up the hill  Second Chinese With a grimace It does not sound like an elopement First Chinese It is a doleful ballad  Fit for keyholes Third Chinese Shall we hear more Second Chinese Why not Third Chinese We came for isolation  To rest in sunrise Second Chinese Raising his book slightly But this  will be a part of sunrise And can you tell how it will end Venetian Egyptian Contorted glass   He turns toward the light in the sky to the right darkening the candle with his hands In the meantime the candle shines Indicating the sunrise As you say To the Third Chinese For the beauty of shining  First Chinese Sympathetically Oh it will end badly The lady s father Came clapping behind them   Three Travelers Watch a Sunrise  To the foot of the hill He came crying Anna Anna Anna Imitating He was alone without her Just as the young gentleman Was alone without her Three beggars you see Begging for one another  The First Negro carrying two lanterns approaches cautiously through the trees At the sight of him the Second Negro seated near the Chinese jumps to his feet The Chinese get up in alarm The Second Negro goes around the Chinese toward the First Negro All see the body of a man hanging to the limb of the tree They gather together keeping their eyes fixed on it The First Negro comes out of the trees and places the lanterns on the ground He looks at the group and then at the body  First Chinese Moved The young gentleman of the ballad Third Chinese Slowly approaching the body And the end of the ballad Take away the bushes  The negroes commence to pull away the bushes  Second Chinese Death the hermit Needs no candle In his hermitage  The Second Chinese snuffs out the candle The First Chinese puts out the lanterns As the bushes are pulled   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  away the figure of a girl sitting half stupefied under the tree suddenly becomes apparent to the Second Chinese and then to the Third Chinese They step back The negroes move to the left When the First Chinese sees the girl the instrument slips from his hands and falls noisily to the ground The girl stirs  Second Chinese To the girl Is that you Anna  The girl starts She raises her head looks around slowly leaps to her feet and screams Second Chinese Gently Is that you Anna She turns quickly toward the body looks at it fixedly  and totters up the stage  Anna Bitterly Go Tell my father He is dead  The Second and Third Chinese support her The First Negro whispers to the First Chinese then takes the lanterns and goes through the opening to the road where he disappears in the direction of the valley  First Chinese To Second Negro Bring us fresh water From the spring  The Second Negro takes the jug and enters the trees to the left The girl comes gradually to herself She looks at the Chinese and at the sky She turns her back toward the body shuddering and does not look at it again  Anna It will soon be sunrise  Second Chinese One candle replaces   Three Travelers Watch a Sunrise  Another  The First Chinese walks toward the bushes to the right He stands by the roadside as if to attract the attention of anyone passing  Anna Simply When he was in his fields I worked in ours Wore purple to see And when I was in his garden I wore gold ear rings Last evening I met him on the road He asked me to walk with him To the top of the hill I felt the evil But he wanted nothing He hanged himself in front of me  She looks for support The Second and Third Chinese help her toward the road At the roadside the First Chinese takes the place of the Third Chinese The girl and the two Chinese go through the bushes and disappear down the road The stage is empty except for the Third Chinese He walks slowly across the stage pushing the instrument out of his way with his foot It reverberates He looks at the water bottle  Third Chinese Of the color of blood Seclusion of porcelain Seclusion of sunrise   He picks up the water bottle  The candle of the sun   Will shine soon On this hermit earth Indicating the bottle It will shine soon Upon the trees And find a new thing Indicating the body Painted on this porcelain Indicating the trees But not on this Indicating the bottle  He places the bottle on the ground A narrow cloud over the valley becomes red He turns toward it then walks to the right He finds the book of the Second Chinese lying on the ground picks it up and turns over the leaves  Red is not only  The color of blood  Or Indicating the body  Of a man s eyes  Or Pointedly  Of a girl s  And as the red of the sun  Is one thing to me  And one thing to another  So it is the green of one tree Indicating  And the green of another  Which without it would all be black  Sunrise is multiplied  Like the earth on which it shines  By the eyes that open on it  Even dead eyes  As red is multiplied by the leaves of trees   Three Travelers Watch a Sunrise  Toward the end of this speech the Second Negro comes from the trees to the left without being seen The Third Chinese whose back is turned toward the negro walks  through the bushes to the right and disappears on the road The negro looks around at the objects on the stage He sees the instrument seats himself before it and strikes it several times listening to the sound One or two birds twitter A voice urging a horse is heard at a distance There is the crack of a whip The negro stands up walks to the right and remains at the side of the road The curtain falls slowly  Wallace Stevens   IN MEMORY OF BRYAN LATHROP  Who bequeathed to Chicago a School of Music  So in Pieria from the wedded bliss Of Time and Memory the Muses came To be the means of rich oblivion And rest from cares And when the Thunderer Took heaven then the Titans warred on him For pity of mankind But the great law Which is the law of music not of bread Set Atlas for a pillar manacled His brother to the rocks in Scythia And under Aetna fixed the furious Typhon So should thought rule not force And Amphion Pursuing justice entered Thebes and slew His mother s spouse but when he would make sure And fortify the city then he took The lyre that Hermes gave and played and watched The stones move and assemble till a wall Engirded Thebes and kept the citadel Beyond the reach of arrows and of fire What other power but harmony can build A city and what gift so magical As that by which a city lifts its walls So men in years to come shall feel the power Of this man moving through the high ranged thought Which plans for beauty builds for larger life The stones shall rise in towers to answer him  Edgar Lee Masters   SACRIFICE  Love sufíereth all things And we Out of the travail and pain of our striving Bring unto Thee the perfect prayer For the lips of no man utter love Suffering even for love s sake  For us no splendid apparel of pageantry Burnished breast plates scarlet banners and trumpets Sounding exultantly But the mean things of the earth Thou has chosen Decked them with suffering Made them beautiful with the passion for Tightness Strong with the pride of love  Yea though our praise of Thee slayeth us Yet love shall exalt us beside Thee triumphant Dying that these live And the earth again be beautiful with orchards Yellow with wheatfields And the lips of others praise Thee though our lips Be stopped with earth and songless Yet we shall have brought Thee their praises Brought unto Thee the perfect prayer For the lips of no man utter love Suffering even for love s sake   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  O God of sorrows Whose feet come softly through the dews Stoop Thou unto us For we die so Thou livest Our hearts the cups of Thy vintage And the lips of no man utter love Suffering even for love s sake  19022 Private Frederic Manning 3rd R S L  THE WILD BIRD  Like silence of a starlit sky Like wild birds rising into night Such was her dying such her flight Into eternity  But I who dwell with memory Dream in my grief that she may soar Too high and needing love no more Come nevermore to me  Gretchen Warren   HE BUILDETH HIS HOUSE  He hewed him the gray cold rock To make the foundations under The walls and the towers should lock Past the power of the earth to sunder Then masking the bastions frown Art came embroidered and gilded That beauty and joy might crown The palace which power had builded  God sighed Why build so tall Thy prison wall  THE POET S PART  It is a little world where poets dwell A little hidden world and few there be Who know its sign or language or can tell Whence come the visions that the poets see The great world beats about it heedlessly With things to win to own to buy to sell With myriad cares that leave no mortal free With hopes that spur and bafflements that quell  Yet ever does the great world in its might Swing onward through the darkness by the light   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Caught up by poet hand from poet hand And if but once should sink that flaming brand Why then would come at last the endless night To hide the ruin of what God had planned  Lily A Long  THE WIND IN THE TREES  The wind goes whispering The leaves among It has a silken A siren tongue  The leaves all listen Quivering there A thousand kisses Caress the air  So stirs my heart When he goes by Wind is a breath Love is a sigh  Lulu W Knight   GOOD MORNING  Why there s the morning and get up o clock The dream dewed freshness and the keen delight Do you remember There those ashes were Our fire last night the sun is laughing at them Look in the valley where we passed before You see that little winding of the road The selfsame big important yesterday That seemed so steep and threatening a hill Come let us bathe and break the fast and start  Peter Norden  TO A CERTAIN FAIR LADY  Your heart is like a poplar tree Full of sunlit greenery A thin lace pattern on the sky That trembles when the winds go by  And every zephyr every day That comes adventuring that way Feels it as tremulously waken As if it never had been shaken  Lyman Bryson   A COLLOQUY IN SLEEP  Did ever aught make love to you as I  Ah no  Oh yes the mirror and the sea The sea communes with you as silently The mirror and I hold your beauties high We love you as our queen and never lie  You scarcely know my voice how can I be Your queen You must give over seeing me  Raiment and food and drink would you deny You have the worship of mine eyes and rare Devotion such as none may mar or break What more  Your very silence is unfair Nor will you let me speak when I m awake  You speak to me in music everywhere Through all sweet music that the masters make  John Regnault Ellyson   POEMS  THE FLEDGLING  The fire is nearly out The lamp is nearly out The room is untidy after the long day I am here unhappy Longing to leave the hearth Longing to escape from the home The others are asleep But I am here unhappy The fire is nearly out The lamp is nearly out  IMPRESSION  The orchards are white again There was one I knew Whose body was white as they fairer  Alas that we drifted apart Faster than pear petals fall to the ground  STUDY  Oh carrot cat slinking over the snow Your skin is blue where the bitter wind ruffles your fur Can you not find one shivering sparrow in all this white  world   DOMESTIC  Sometimes Having read By the fireside Through a long evening I look up The old people Apathetically Are sitting The dim eyes gazing In the past That seems so good And then pity Dews all my sight For old age Is the guerdon The only laurels Of their life And mine uncrowned So far away I cannot cry  Hail  DOUBLE  Through the day meekly I am my mother s child Through the night riotously I ride great horses   In ranks we gallop gallop Thundering on Through the night With the wind  But in the pale day I sit quiet  TOWN MOUSE  These things for today The threat of rain And great hasting clouds Wet soil s scent Fine cobwebs on the heather Keen air Even a park of green lawns Bare boughs and brown sparrows Oh for no roof overhead And full lungs  These things for today  ENOUGH HAS BEEN SAID OF SUNSET  I  Light imperceptible as One thin veil drawn across blackness Is it dawn    Comes the twitter whistle of sleepy birds Crescendo Now bright grayness creeping Drowns the dark and waves of sea wind Rock the thin leaves A door bangs sharp barks from dogs released scampering After some silence footsteps And the rising bustle of people Roused by the day break  II  Mysterious threatening Dawn over housetops silhouetted Like crenelated battlements Against light of a stage scene  IMPRESSION  At night Neither joy ambition love nor want In my heart But the leaves called And the earth called And there was only waiting Against the coming of rain And the whipping of hair About my head  Iris Barry    POEMS BY CHILDREN  THE PURPLE GRAY  Star like a little candle Moon like a silver sickle Which has lost its handle Glows that downward trickle Clouds that are pinkened by the glimmer of the faintly blinking sun  Shadows across the road Scurries in the bushes Made perhaps by a toad Or a stone one pushes Lamp light faintly shining through the twitching vines  After sunset glows In the purple gray Gray that no one knows Parting of the day That s when grayish trickling drowsy things are dreamed  Arvia MacKaye  SONGS  I  Rosy plum tree think of me When Spring comes down the world  II  There s dozens full of dandelions  Down in the field  Little gold plates  Little gold dishes in the grass  I cannot count them  But the fairies know every one  III  Oh wrinkling star wrinkling up so wise When you go to sleep do you shut your eyes   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IV  The red moon comes out in the night When I m asleep the moon comes pattering up Into the trees Then I peep out my window To watch the moon go by  V  Sparkle up little tired flower  Leaning in the grass  Did you find the rain of night  Too heavy to hold  VI  Blossoms in the growing tree  Why don t you speak to me  I want to grow like you  Smiling smiling  VII  The garden is full of flowers  All dancing round and round John flowers Mary flowers Polly flowers Cauli flowers  They dance round and round  And they bow down and down  To a black eyed daisy  VIII  I will sing you a song Sweets of my heart  With love in it  How I love you And a rose to swing in the wind The wind that swings roses  Hilda Conkling four years old   Summertime  SUMMERTIME  I  Babies are running all around In the fields Getting a waxful of honey The honey was made of blue flowers But the babies had pink in their wings  II  Rosebushes on a happy day Rosebushes on a happy day Are you all calling your roses  On a happy day  III  Oh the apple blossoms will be apples some day And cherries will be ripe first of March or first of May  IV  Gay as the flowers Nice as the night I for one Am in delight  V  Clover tops are coming Cows will soon arise The sun comes up And the stars go by Green grasses are growing Your trees are blooming with apples And flowers grow right near the water To get a drink today  VI  The violin makes brown music Brown like bees and honey   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Gold like the sun  Oh ray violin  VII  The daisies are shining in the sun March till you come to the creek The creek will show you the way to the moon March march march The little creek runs by all day Singing River river And never stops to play It just keeps going night and day March  VIII  O cherry tree  Why don t you give me some cherries  I love to see you bow them down  On the grass  Cherries red in your cheeks  Did you come out of the white blossoms  IX  I saw the clovers flow through the field  Like a spread of cloud  A wing of pink cloud  Clovers are you playing sunset  X  I think of you Mr Mapletree  And I know you have loads of pleasure  For you stand so sweet  Now this is my farewell song  Elsa Conkling five years old  EDITORIAL COMMENT  HOW NOT TO DO IT  WE have often discussed in these pages the ques  tion of prizes arguing in favor of them in the  art of poetry as in the other arts The editors  of POETRY believe that prizes properly en  dowed and awarded conduce to the advancement of the art and increase a little its very small financial returns But we would not be understood as approving the method adopted by the Poetry Society of America for the impending award of two prizes of one hundred and twenty five dollars each the first ever placed by a generous and well intentioned donor at the disposal of the Society  The prizes are to be awarded by popular vote of members and others in the following fashion  During the past season the society has held at the National Arts Club New York five monthly meetings open to members of the Poetry Society and their guests meetings attended chiefly of course by the local members with an unlimited number of guests At each of these meetings from ten to twenty poems were read without the disclosure of their authorship after which all those present both members and guests were asked to vote for their favorites As the second stage in the award unsigned copies of the ten poems which received the highest votes two poems from each meeting were mailed to all members of the Poetry Society The prizes are to be given presumably to the two   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  poems receiving the greatest number of votes from those members whose consciences permit them to sanction with their votes such a method of choice  It may be true that no completely satisfactory manner of awarding prizes will ever be devised but meantime it is safe to say that the above method is the worst that could possibly be devised The jury is not even professional since guests as well as members voted at the five meetings and such voting represents not thoughtful and deliberate judgment but the casual and hasty preference of people competent and incompetent who listen more or less attentively to a group of poems read once or twice aloud  At the only meeting which I attended that of March the two poems receiving the largest votes were of all the twelve or fifteen read the two which most closely fulfilled the journalistic ideal of popular poetry an ideal which should hardly be set up as the Poetry s Society standard of excellence in the art Meantime poems submitted by Robert Frost Witter Bynner Margaret Widdemer and the guest of the evening Lawrence Housman for the poets names were disclosed after the voting are not even eligible for the prizes because a casual crowd turned them down  Naturally not one of the ten poems thus selected deserves to be honored with a prize bearing the cachet of the Poetry Society and many members who respect their art have refrained from considering them  The result of such a method of choice can have no significance whatever and its lack of significance will of course tend to discredit the Poetry Society of America The society   is not obliged to award prizes but if it assumes this obligation it should fulfil it with due dignity and effort at justice so that the award will be an honor No doubt the officers of the Society have already recognized the futility of their first year s experiment and resolved to change the method of award next year It is to be hoped that they will abandon altogether the present limitation of the award to poems read at the meetings and give the prizes simply to the two most distinguished poems or books of poems published by any two members of the society during the year And the Jury of Award should be small and of the highest professional standing as with similar juries in painters and sculptors exhibitions H M  THE REJECTION SLIP  If the subscription list of this magazine approximated the yearly inflow of manuscripts the editors would hire a long string of assistants have cut flowers replenished daily on their desks and be less harassed generally Even then however the impossibility of answering personally each letter that reaches the office would be equally manifest  What is one to do about such a condition One can not turn oneself into a human machine the capacity even of an inhuman machine is limited When visiting poets are shown the bulging drawers full of one day s incoming verse and are asked how they would like to have to read it they usually faint on the spot  A few facts may induce a more sympathetic feeling for   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the editors a less impatient denunciation of the rejection slip as brutal and dispiriting What sort of rejection slip would not be brutal and dispiriting As one who is responsible for so many of these barbed arrows I must confess that not even I can steel my sensitiveness against the rebuke on those few occasions when I have been bold enough to invite it  But for the facts All the verse that has come into this office up to date has been read by the editors The first reading has been considered extremely important and the editors have not been willing to relegate this to underlings or to outside readers If this is the usual method as I have heard with the larger magazines it may be one reason why a certain conventional standard has so oftened marked the poetry printed in them The first reading is vitally important and exciting as well for in this vast heap of manuscripts may lurk a discovery The handwriting may be slovenly apparently illiterate yet who knows if it may not be the accidental disguise of a real poet Or the name may be quite unfamiliar the work uneven yet something startles one to a closer scrutiny I could in fact give instances of some important discoveries which were made in just this manner  So even he who receives a rejection slip may count upon this much editorial attention and consideration from this magazine I wish often that the poets would show a little more consideration for the editors that they would beg borrow or steal a type writer that they would not enclose a return envelope three sizes too small for their manuscript that they would not send their poems unfolded in an enormous stiffened envelope too large for any office cubbyhole The Rejection Slip  which consequently gets misplaced and delayed that they would not fold each poem separately where oh where did this custom start is it a trick to catch the editor is it well heaven only knows what it is except that it is infinitely wearing  After three years and a half about four years of reading a mixed assortment of verse the danger is not so much in a growing tolerance for the mistakes of editors though that is considerable as it is in a certain relaxation of one s expectation of the poets a softening of discipline which makes it harder than ever to send out the rejection slip Yet punctually with each morning s mail the hope renews itself that genius may be discovered beneath the flap of each envelope and punctually with the outgoing mail this hope is sealed beneath the flap of the three sizes too small envelope which the poet has so kindly enclosed with his manuscript  N B Any envelope is better than none In the familiar language of childhood the rejection slip hurts the editor far more than it does the poet The poet knows that he is a genius and the editor still hopes to discover that he is in each manuscript examined The editor has a hundred sorrows for the poet s one The poet may swear at the editor and rather adds to his dignity in doing so but the editor in addressing the poet has to assume the polite demeanor of the dancing master I once forsook the official manner of a machine for that of a human being in writing  to a poet the result was a cataclysm Truly the lot of an editor is a hard one  A C H   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  RUBEN DARIO  Rubén Darío s work has a threefold significance aesthetical historical and social As an aesthete in the purest meaning of this term Rubén Darío is the Spanish Keats he taught that beauty is truth truth beauty and that sincerity is the highest virtue This message he delivered to his people the family of Spanish speaking countries with such power that through his influence and that of the other poets and writers who with him for a leader formed the revolutionary modernist school Spanish poetry during the last generation was changed from the rhetorical conventional sort of thing into which it degenerated after it had flourished gloriously in the time of Gongora to vibrant real sincere song  His was a fine horror of literature you will recall Ver laine s dictum Le pauvre Lelian was his master not his only master it is true for seeking orientation for his genius in that pilgrimage of discriminate assimilation that all great poets must make before they find themselves Darío worshiped at many a shrine Nor did our poet lose his own personality but rather enriched it when he chose in one of his earliest phases to become a symbolist The song he made on the bald faun s flute came from within his own self To critics who would tag him as belonging to this that or the other school he would cry I am myself He despised servility and warned those that sought to imitate his writings that at best they would be but as lackeys bearing the uniform of his house Sincerity of expression only can bring forth real poetry and this he knew could not be attained through   mere imitation But he was eager to learn and the Pre Raphaelites of England the Parnassians and Symbolists of France Carducci among the Italians and Poe and Whitman of the Americans as well of course as the classics of all languages had much to teach him And the wealth of knowledge that he made his own brought to bear upon his work gave it that cosmopolitan bigness that made him a truly universal poet His work like America as he would often say is for all humanity  With this ideal always before him it is not surprising that he should be as the phrase goes a coiner of words and an enemy of steel ribbed grammars His work always impeccable and rich in form is of supreme importance in the history of Spanish literature not only because of the spiritual renaissance of which it was the dawn the awakening of Latin America to a realization of its literary individuality but chiefly because of the changes that he wrought in the language giving it a treasure of new expressions new turns of phrase nuances in prose as well as in verse  To appreciate this achievement justly it must be remembered that for centuries the Spanish language had hardly been free to follow new paths of development such as English and French and German had taken The dykes of linguistical traditions raised by the conservative and tyrannical Royal Academy of Spain had all but stagnated literary style Up to Dario s time Spanish prosody was perhaps the poorest in Europe it is true that sundry measures new to the language such as the Graeco Latin hexameter the French alexandrine and verses based on a four syllable foot had   been essayed now and then but there had not been a poet of sufficient power to use them as medium for great poetry and so to give them permanence  The enneasyllabic verse for instance in which Rubén Darío wrote some of his best poems had for a long time been used by comic opera libbretists in Spain but the makers of serious poetry had always shown utter disregard for it never realizing its musical virtues and possibilities And so with no less than a score of other metres which Darío invented or introduced and gave permanence to or dignified or revived He was an indefatigable prosodist and his poetry magnificently sonorous at times always elfin touched reveals the master craftsman no less than the born poet His verse possesses the very magic of pure music Rubén Darío was a virtuoso of words fully as great as Swinburne or D Annunzio with more ideas than either  And since the publication of Prosas Profanas his fourth book in 1893 the poetical leadership in Spanish is incontestably no longer of the mother country but of the neo Latin republics of America It was the wresting of this leadership that made Dario a social power in all the countries south of the United States To realize fully what this means we must consider the poet s position in all the Latin and especially in the Spanish American countries The poet there is a prophet an inspired God anointed leader of the people He is for us the treasurer of hope the master of the tomorrow  It is true that we have never enriched him with worldly goods as for instance Kipling and Masefield and Walt   Rubén Darío  Mason are said to have been enriched true that the publications that print his verses do not often pay him for it But on the other hand we believe in him We alone of all peoples have elected poets to be our presidents and political leaders solely on the ground that they were great poets and we have not fared so ill as readers of Plato s Republic might imagine For instance José Martí the Cuban liberator was also one of her chief poets and it was because he was a poet that he realized the epic task of uniting his people solidly and enlisting on their side the sympathy of the entire world The American guns at San Juan Hill and at Santiago but echoed the patriot poet s songs  And Darío by his singing united all the Latin American countries intellectually and morally arousing them to a sense of their true grandeur When in one of his sincerest poems he said  La patria es para el hombre lo que siente o que sueña which freely translated means a man s country is as great as his mind and heart are great each petit pays chaud the bitter phrase is Daudet s shook from itself that terrible feeling of littleness in size that had so weighed upon it  Horrified by the war he left Europe where he had lived for some time as minister of Nicaragua his native country to Spain and France and came to America late in 1914 to preach peace and to work for a Pan American Union based on a community of ideals and the intellectual fellowship of the two Americas His last great poem not yet published entire is a magnificent ode voicing this aspiration During   his visit to this country early in 1915 he read this poem at Columbia University He had planned to make a continental tour starting here But death blocked his path He became seriously ill in New York and in February of this year the forty ninth of his life he died at León Nicaragua his native town  The solemnity of death has served to emphasize his message of fraternity Latin America waits to hear it echoed by the poets of this country It is dawn  Salomón de la Selva  REVIEWS  SHELLEY IN HIS LETTERS  The Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley Edited by Roger Ing  pen Bohn s Library G Bell and Sons London  That light whose smile kindles the universe  That beauty in which all things work and move  That benediction which the eclipsing curse  Of birth can quench not that sustaining love  Which through the web of being blindly wove  By man and beast and earth and air and sea  Burns bright or dim as each are mirrors of  The fire for which all thirst now beams on me  Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality  This stanza of Adonais will recur often to the reader of the contradictions and the complications of Shelley s life as these are revealed in his fascinating correspondence  Without strength to hold up for long at a time the magnificent torch of his belief that human love is the light that kindles the beauty of creation Shelley could yet wave the   Shelley in His Letters  wild gleam of that flame with a free grace which will long waylay mankind s imagination He waves it in his extremely candid and vital letters as expressively as in his verse for me in general more expressively Few of his admirers I believe will deny that the stuff of Shelley s poetry is more sympathetically communicated in his correspondence with Claire Clairmont alone or Thomas Love Peacock or Hogg or Byron alone than in Julian and Maddalo Rosalind and Helen and all his controversial verse put together  Absorbing as it is to follow the gusty flame of the poet s torch of creative thought through the labyrinths of mortal life where he leads us it must be confessed that in the course of the two volumes I often forgot to look at the divine fire in my interest in the endlessly wonderful scene of human figures which that light chances to illuminate Lord Byron Claire Clairmont John Keats Leigh Hunt Godwin Mary Shelley the gifted Mrs Boinville never was a poet s biography more fully peopled than Shelley s with men and women of brilliant endowment and striking character This element of the interest commonly attributed to novels and so sadly to seek in numbers of them is greatly enhanced by quotations from Peacock s memoir from Mrs Shelley s prefatory notes accompanying the first collected edition of her husband s poems and from various other sources as well as by the addition of letters heretofore unpublished or only privately published  Time has walked past the day of apologies for Shelley and of defamations Time has put these in his fabular bag   and at last has given us a book void alike of Jeaffrean miserable malice and of Professor Dowden s excessive zeal in partisanship a book of amazing and convincing spiritual portraits This is not the place for comment on the wonderful tale we may find here of Shelley s relations to men and women beyond the remark that few of its readers will be found to deny its power as a human document I couldn t skip a word of it cried a friend I read even the letters to the money lenders  About poetry qua poetry perhaps the most curious and arresting observation one will have to make on the topic as presented in these two volumes is that Shelley seems to have paid on the whole very little attention to it The fluent and voluminous expression of an ardent mind a delightful resource a natural exercise Shelley s poetry and by this I mean his writing of poetry was never with him an absorbing obsession He could never have averred for himself Poe s saying For me poetry has ever been less a pursuit than a passion Keats few words on poetry in his distinguished letter to the beautiful and ineffectual angel outweigh in force and dignity anything presented on the subject by his generous admirer Shelley writes to Peacock  I consider poetry very subordinate to moral and political science and if I were well certainly I would aspire to the latter for I can conceive a great work embodying the discoveries of all ages and harmonizing the contending creeds by which mankind have been ruled Far from me is such an attempt and I shall be content by exercising my fancy to amuse myself and perhaps some others and cast what weight I can into the scale of the balance which the Giant of Arthegall holds   The Giant of Arthegall one is asked to remember is that defeated hero and lover of justice in the Faerie Queene who is knocked into the sea by mere brute power And it is on record that Shelley once said beautifully to the forceful author of  The mountain sheep were sweeter But the valley sheep were fatter  I am of the Giant s faction  Too little concerned with poetry as an art Shelley can yet hardly say a word about it without revealing the grace of a great nature nobly indifferent to the mere question of career modest and impersonal concerning his own achievements very splendidly occupied with the eternal verities Shelley is indeed too modest by far concerning his own achievements and yet you would not have him in this respect other than he was  You will go back again after you have read the letters and read the poetry and you will agree with Shelley that Adonais is his greatest work and look with his vision on the vibrant light and cloud swept way of our mortal lives through cosmos The charm of reading his verse will be recreated for you by the fine pleasure of reading the correspondence of one of the world s greatest letter writers  These volumes have another haunting beauty the beauty of a way of human intercourse which has now all but disappeared Deserted for the short cuts of telegrams and telephones and the trails of an earth compressed by innumerable conveniences of travel and information the old great   highway of vitally expressive correspondence has been almost overgrown About it breathes the air surrounding yellow cave cliffs classic plinths and Theocritean idyls the air of something vanished but immemorial As an admirer closing the book exclaimed No one will ever write such letters again E W  ARENSBERG AND THE NEW REALITY  Idols by Walter Conrad Arensberg Houghton Mifflin Co  The problem that chiefly agitates the mind of the modern artist I mean the artist who is possessed by life and who must express its beauty as clearly and sincerely as he can is what position he should take toward reality  The positions that for many years used to be taken as a matter of course by English or American artists are no longer tenable The modern painter for instance if he is a student a searcher will no longer be satisfied with expressing the poetry of nature not even in the styles of Inness or Corot Prettiness which used to be called beauty preachi ness wistfulness more or less refined allegory realism whether of light line or substance spirituality none of these will answer his soul s needs not entirely His aim is to express the rhythm the color or line rhythm the song of reality His manner may be fantastic whimsical or even realistic His highest ideal perhaps is to be excited enough by the wine drunk by his senses to create something Create Something new As the trees and the moon and the sun were new on the first day   Arensberg and the New Reality  Of course his attainments are not always so great as his aspirations  How far are these new strivings these new effects attainable in poetry  Poetry has some advantages over painting and it is also under some disadvantages Its advantages lie in the fact that the poet has always used reality with more freedom boldness than the painter and so has escaped even in its most conservative form the prettiness and other defects so distasteful to the modern palate In his free handling of reality he has to a certain extent reached the ideal of the modern artist  But poetry being made up of words of which each one has a distinct sense it is hard for the poet to escape realism with its temptation toward prettiness more or less refined allegory etc A combination of colors even if one could not understand the harmony underlying it might still seem beautiful I believe that a color symphony of Kandinsky s has some charm even for those who can not see in it what that painter expects them to see While words without sense would of course be nonsense  Mallarmé has tried to overcome this difficulty by devising a new kind of symbolism or rather by emphasizing an established poetic form he tried to express emotions pictorially But this if accepted could hardly bring us any nearer as it would turn an art in many ways more advanced than painting back to an earlier stage of painting and Mallarmé himself seems to have recognized this   These thoughts occurred to me while reading Mr Arens berg s Idols This poet modern as he is and scorning to conceal the influence of Mallarmé on his mind seems to have recognized the difficulty of expressing in poetry the effects the modern painter expresses in his art With perhaps two or three exceptions he submits to what appears inevitable In most of his poems there is a boldness in the handling of symbols or a capricious mysticism which distinguishes them as twentieth century work but on the whole they are not as regards their newness alone different from other poems  The present reviewer though not ready to admit that poetry could not be brought more into accord with the ideals of the modern painter has read this book with very great pleasure I can read again and again the Song of the Souls Set Free sung from above the clouds  What can they be bowing under Wild and wan Peep and draw the clouds asunder Peep and wave a dawn  Or in a somewhat similar strain though in a dissimilar mood and speaking probably of the poet in a poem entitled Dirge Make of the moon about the eaves of space You who upon the earth are doing nothing The circle of a swallow In the twilight  When this poet is a little mystical he is convincing a rare and felicitous faculty as in After Thought and in To the Gatherer Among so many beautiful poems I really do not know which to single out In Falling Asleep perhaps the most modern poem in the book the author speaks of the   mind s vague wanderings before losing consciousness in this  charming manner  Lay aside your sandals  That have fled  Down a night of candles  By the bed  Consider the Lilies with its wistful worldly advice Landscape and Figures At Daybreak Servant June The Swan each one of these is as beautiful as the other Human reads too much like a translation of Mallarmé Autobiographic I do not clearly understand it seems to be based on the mystical side of Cubism its least important side strange as this may sound Max Michelson  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  I  Timeliness is not one of POETRY S vices writes one of our contributors adding a thank heaven by way of propitiation Because of an effort to practice this vice we must make amends to Señor de la Selva the distinguished young Nicaraguan poet and critic whose article on Rubén Darío listed for our May number was delayed till June and then July because of the pressure of subjects more immediate until his topic had been appropriated by Mr Silvester Baxter in the June Poetry Review of America  In this the second number of the new Boston paper the editor graciously thanks POETRY and the later organs of the art for breaking a path through an unknown field beset with great obstacles The path of progress like that of true love   never did run smooth for either poet or editor but we may wish for Mr Braithwaite the minimum of rocks and brambles In size of page and weight of paper the new sheet seems a bit formidable but it looks important with its large type and there is room in it for contrasts We find Joyce Kilmer and John Gould Fletcher side by side Amy Lowell talking about imagists and Amelia Josephine Burr praising Hermann Hagedorn The pièce de résistance of the number is Louis Ledoux s Persephone in Hades no doubt a very distinguished classic lyric dramatic poem of a kind which I find it difficult to read  Contemporary Verse for June

death of Captain August Stramm the young German soldier and poet who was killed last autumn during a cavalry charge in Russia  Stramm gave poetry a new method poetic drama a new field of imaginative vision Yet he was but little known even in Germany when he died As with Rupert Brooke the glamor of his death may render tardy justice to his poetry His gift to imaginative literature was just beginning to be perceived and one or two French literary circles began to show signs of his influence Eventually he might have meant to Germany what Synge did to Ireland   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He created five Storm Books and it is by these that I know him He may have published other volumes If so it was obscurely Sancta Susanna and Die Haidebraut are the two little books by which he will be longest remembered English translations of these plays a typographical mess were published in Poet Lore during 1914 A great many of Stramm s poems remain uncollected in the pages of Der Sturm and probably elsewhere  I know of no contemporary poet who has compressed vaster distances of wind and sunlight into a line or two He absorbed a wide moor in a single pulsation and restored it in an inevitable rhythm transformed by his own vision of its beauty into a personal utterance He was plunged in the mystery of open spaces He denied nothing a secret  I think that mountains would have been a revelation to him He required shadows to satisfy his play of light and he wove them into wonderful lyric patterns of terror and exultation as if they were flaming projections of his own spirit of worship animate in form But he required distances if only for contrast Sometimes they were spiritual distances to be found only in the uttermost reaches of the human heart but always they were passionately linked to nature by some form of creative prayer He was not at all interested in the surface embodiments of nature in pretty landscapes What he felt behind all the beauty of the world was its elemental passions and he believed these to be the projections of human passions in waves of wind and light and water in flames of earth He felt the terror of beauty rather   August Stramm  than its charm and he surrendered his heart to that Perhaps he always saw nature in a human image  Because his heaven was subjective the material facts of life did not press him closely He lived in a world he had created in the mage of a personal ideal He probably regarded his death on the battlefield as a casual incident  I find it impossible to convey the method by which Stramm out of the simplest words evokes the sense of space and fatality that encompasses all his action He can wring the most tremendous emotional values out of utter stillness In his plays the characters more often than not speak by their silences The words he gives to them to utter are often merely counters or masks if you like to conceal the passions smouldering just beneath the surface His own life must have been a concealment  He was a strange man drifting through life in the world but not of it never puzzled but often unhappy feeding the fires of his inspiration with his own passion for nature relieving his spiritual nostalgia in the only way in which it can be relieved by artistic expression a man out of his time who walked alone yet had friends a man whom Germany felt that she could afford to waste Perhaps it was because he had a Russian soul Edward J O Brien   THE PARTING  W e receive the following report of a conversation from a contributor who leads a double life being not only a poet but
