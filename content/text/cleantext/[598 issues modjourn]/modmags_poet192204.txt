and quaint alone Among the cities But I I who have known Her tenderness her courage and her pity Have felt her forces mold me mind and bone Life after life up from her first beginning How can I think of her in wood and stone To others she has given of her beauty Her gardens and her dim old faded ways Her laughter and her happy drifting hours Glad spendthrift April squandering her flowers The sharp still wonder of her autumn days   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Her chimes that shimmer from St Michael s steeple Across the deep maturity of June Like sunlight slanting over open water Under a high blue listless afternoon But when the dusk is deep upon the harbor She finds me where her rivers meet and speak And while the constellations gem the silence High overhead her cheek is on my cheek I know her in the thrill behind the dark When sleep brims all her silent thoroughfares She is the glamour in the quiet park That kindles simple things like grass and trees Wistful and wanton as her sea born airs Bringer of dim rich age old memories Out on the gloom deep water when the nights Are choked with fog and perilous and blind She is the faith that tends the calling lights Hers is the stifled voice of harbor bells Muffled and broken by the mist and wind Hers are the eyes through which I look on life And find it brave and splendid And the stir Of hidden music shaping all my songs And these my songs my all belong to her  EDGAR ALLAN POE   Once in the starlight When the tides were low    DuBose Heyward  And the surf fell sobbing To the undertow I trod the windless dunes Alone with Edgar Poe  Dim and far behind us Like a fabled bloom On the myrtle thickets  In the swaying gloom Hung the clustered windows Of the barrack room  Faint on the evening Tenuous and far As the beauty shaken  From a vagrant star Throbbed the ache and passion Of an old guitar  Life closed behind us Like a swinging gate Leaving us unfettered And emancipate Confidants of Destiny Intimates of Fate  I could only cower Silent while the night Seething with its planets Parted to our sight   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Showing us infinity In its breadth and height  But my chosen comrade Tossing back his hair With the old loved gesture Raised his face and there Shone that agony that those Loved of God must bear  Oh we heard the many things Silence has to say He and I together As alone we lay Waiting for the slow sweet Miracle of day  When the bugle s silver Spiralled up the dawn Dew clear night cool And the stars were gone I arose exultant Like a man new born  But my friend and master Heavy limbed and spent Turned as one must turn at last From the sacrament And his eyes were deep with God s Burning discontent   MATINS  I saw you pray today  Out in the park Poor little storm driven Child of the dark  Body to earth you lay On the young grass Learning the shining way April may pass  I saw the clear song Cardinals make Brush your face tangibly Like wind on the lake  Then in the hedge Where japonicas grew A little breeze was born Boyish and new  I saw it find you And rustle your name Lift you and carry you Like a slim flame  Out where the trees break Leaving wide skies Now I see always The prayer in your eyes  DuBose Heyward  DuBose Heyward    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE SEA ISLANDS  SHADOWS  There is deliberateness in all sea island ways Outlandish to our days as stone wheels are The islands cannot see the use of life Which only lives for change Their days are flat And all things there move slowly Even the seasons are conservative No sudden flaunting of wild colors in the fall Only a gradual fading of the green As if the earth turned slowly Or looked with one still face upon the sun As Venus does Until the trees the fields the marshes All turn dun dull Quaker brown And a mild winter settles down And mosses are more gray  All human souls are glasses which reflect The aspects of the outer world See what terrible gods the huge Himalayas bred And the fierce Jewish Jaywah came From the hot Syrian desert With his inhibitory decalogue The gods of little hills are always tame Here God is dull where all things stay the same   Hervey Allen  No change on these sea islands  The huge piled clouds range  White in the cobalt sky The moss hangs And the strong tiring sea winds blow  While day on glistering day goes by  The horses plow with hanging heads  Slow followed by a black faced man  Indifferent to the sun The old cotton bushes hang with whitened heads And there among the live oak trees Peep the small whitewashed cabins Painted blue perhaps with scarlet turbaned women Ample hipped with voices soft and warm And the lean hounds and chocolate children swarm  Day after day the ocean pumps The awful valve gates of his heart Diastole and systole through these estuaries The tides flow in long gray weed streaked lines The salt water like the planet s lifeblood goes As if the earth were breathing with long taken breaths And we were very near her heart  No wonder that these faces show a tired dismay Looking on burning suns and scarcely blithe in May Spring s coming is too fierce with life And summer is too long   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The stunted pine trees struggle with the sand Till the eyes sicken with their dwarfing strife  There are old women here among these island homes With dull brown eyes that look at something gray And tight silver hair drawn back in lines Like the beach grass that s always blown one way With such a melancholy in their faces I know that they have lived long in these places The tides the hooting owls the daylight moons The leprous lights and shadows of the mosses The funereal woodlands of these coasts Draped like a hearse And memories of an old war s ancient losses Dwell in their faces shadows like gray ghosts And worse The terror of the black man always near The drab level of the rice fields and the marsh Lend them a mask of fear  SUNSHINE  Do you suppose the sun here lavishes his heat For nothing in these islands by the sea No The great green mottled melons ripen in the fields Bleeding with scarlet juicy pith deliciously And the exuberant yams grow golden thick and sweet   And white potatoes in grave rows With leaves as rough as cat tongues And pearly onions and cabbages With white flesh sweet as chicken meat  These the black boatmen bring to town On barges heaped with severed breasts of leaves Driven by put put engines Down the long canals quavering with song With hail and chuckle to the docks along Seeing their dark faces down below Reduplicated in the sunset glow While from the shore stretch out the quivering lines Of the flat palm like reflected pines That inland lie like ranges of dark hills in lines And so to town Weaving odd baskets of sweet grass Lazily and slow To sell in the arcaded market Where men sold their fathers not so long ago  For all their poverty These patient black men live A life rich in warm colors of the fields Sunshine and hearty foods Delighted with the gifts that earth can give And old tales of Plateye and Bre r Rabbit While the golden velvet cornpone browns Underneath the lid among hot ashes   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Where the groundnuts roast Round shadowy fires at nights With tales of graveyard ghost While eery spirituals ring And organ voices sing And sticks knock maddening rhythms on the floor To shuffling youngsters cutting buck and wing Dogs bark And woolly pickaninnies peek about the door Sundays along the moss draped roads The beribboned black folk go to church By threes and twos carrying their shoes With orange turbans ginghams rainbow hats Then bucks flaunt tiger lily ties and cobalt suits Smoking cob pipes and faintly sweet cheroots Wagons with oval wheels and kitchen chairs screech Where Joseph coated white teethed maidens sit Demurely While the old mule rolls back the ivory of his eye Soon from the whitewashed churches roll away Among the live oak trees Rivers of melancholy harmonies Full of the sorrows of the centuries The white man hears but cannot feel  But it is always Sunday on sea islands Plantation bells calling the pickers from the fields Are like old temple gongs   Hervey Allen  And the wind tells monodies among the pines Playing upon their strings the ocean s songs The ducks fly in long trailing lines Geese honk and marsh hens quank Among the tidal flats and rushes rank on rank On island tufts the heron feeds its viscid young And the quick mocker catches From lips of sons of slaves the eery snatches And trolls them as no lips have ever sung  Oh it is good to be here in the spring When water still stays solid in the North When the first jasmine rings its golden bells And the wild wistaria puts forth But most because the sea then changes tone Talking a whit less drear It gossips in a smoother monotone Whispering moon scandal in the old earth s ear  MACABRE IN MACAWS  After the hurricane of the late forties Peter Polite says in the live oak trees Were weird macabre macaws And ash colored cockatoos blown overseas From Nassau and the West Indies These hopped about like dead men s thoughts   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Amid the draggled Spanish moss Preening themselves all at a loss Mewing faint caws And shrieking with nostalgia With dull screams like a child Born with neuralgia And this seems true to me Fitting the landscape s drab grotesquery  HAG HOLLERIN TIME  Black Julius peered out from the galley door Behind Jim Island lying long and dim An infra owl light tinged the twilight sky As if a bonfire burned for cherubim Dark orange flames came leering through the pines And then the moon s face struggling with a sneeze Along the flat horizon s level lines Her nostrils fingered with palmetto trees  Her platinum wand made water wrinkles buckle Old Julius gave appreciative chuckle It s jes about hag hollerin time he said I watched the globous buckeyes in his head Peer back along the bloody moon wash dim To see the fish tailed water witches swim   Hervey Allen  UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS  The judge who lives impeccably upstairs With dull decorum and its implication Has all his servants in to family prayers  And edifies his soul with exhortation Meanwhile his blacks live wastefully downstairs Not always chaste they manage to exist With less decorum than the judge upstairs And find withal a something that he missed  This painful fact a Swede philosopher Who tarried for a fortnight in our city Remarked one evening at the meal before We paralyzed him silent with our pity Saying the black man living with the white Had given more than white men could requite  PALMETTO TOWN  Sea island winds sweep through Palmetto Town Bringing with piny tang the old romance Of pirates and of smuggling gentlemen And tongues as languorous as southern France Flow down her streets like water talk at fords While through iron gates where pickaninnies sprawl The sound comes back in rippled banjo chords   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  From lush magnolia shades where mockers call Mornings the flower women bring their wares Bronze caryatids of a genial race Bearing the bloom heaped baskets on their heads Lithe with their arms akimbo in wide grace Their jasmine nodding jestingly at cares Turbaned they are deep chested straight and tall Bandying old English words now seldom heard But sweet as Provençal Dreams peer like prisoners through her harp like gates From molten gardens mottled with gray gloom Where lichened sundials shadow ancient dates And deep piazzas loom Fringing her quays are frayed palmetto posts Where clipper ships once moored along the ways And fanlight doorways sunstruck with old ghosts Sicken with loves of her lost yesterdays Often I halt upon some gabled walk Thinking I see the ear ringed picaroons Slashed with a sash and Spanish folderols Gambling for moidores or for gold doubloons But they have gone where night goes after day And the old streets are gay with whistled tunes Bright with the lilt of scarlet parasols Carried by honey voiced young octoroons  Hervey Allen   HIGH TREES  There is imprisoned day up there  The even flow of level lights The passing of the wilder rains The perfect circle of the world These and the longer ride with sun The earlier tryst with stars The virgin silver of the moon  It must be well to hear The broken song of trampled dust The long complaint of streets Soothed to uncertainty Earth s weaving flutter laid aside Like a folded fan  See how deeply their lifted breasts Are stirred See how the highest leaf Fingers a star  Henry Bellamann   POETRY A Magazine of Vers  TWO POEMS  RECORDITION  I have hailed you Out of centuries out of aeons During this fractional part of an infinitesimal clock tick  of time I have seen you And hailed you  I have yearned toward you Burning I have looked into your eyes During this fractional part of an infinitesimal clock tick  of time  Quicker than the shadow of a monoplane Passing over the shadow of a humming bird Shall we two pass And be to all men s memory Inconceivably remote  Yet it is recorded That out of all time During this fractional part of an infinitesimal clock tick  of time I have seen you and hailed you It is recorded   Marx G Sabel  THE CORE  I have won free of your body at last The fire and ice of it Can neither burn nor freeze me fast  I look upon you now no whit Afraid for I do not desire And yet what is the benefit  I still must worship something higher Impels me youward constantly Yet I am fagot for a fire  The heat of which is of such degree That I shrivel painlessly therein And I am flower for a sea  So cold all things that find it win To death without the slightest change Although I have torn the cabals of sin  I drift beyond the senses range In spiritual perfectness To lands remote grotesquely strange  That thrill my passions now no less Than even your beauty thrilled before But this this joy is fathomless   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  More certain steadfast deeper more Inexorable and it demands The core of what we thought the core  You cannot touch it with your hands You cannot see it with your eyes Only your soul that understands May teach you its divinities  Marx G Sabel  WHEN LOVE IS GONE  I am as a field of grass Over which the hot winds pass I am bowed  As an organ left alone Organist and songs long gone I am dumb  I am as a goblet dried Wine stained crystal rim and side I am drained  As the ashes dead and gray When the fire has burned away I am cold  Louise Jones   VERSES  IMPRESSIONS  I feel the sands of time Crunch beneath my feet Out on the open road Or in the narrow street  And when my heart is glad My foot prints are light Tracing faintly the sands That glitter cool and white  But when my soul is sad Heavy sinks my tread Deep furrows in the dank Dark sands where lie the dead  RECOGNITION  Disguised a little hope Came to my door one day And begged for food and drink And pled to stay  Frightened my heart said Wait He may be born of sin But then my soul sang out Come in come in   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  TWILIGHT  The grey cloaked dusk Is like a nun Her hands folded Her prayers done  In that hushed hour She seems to wait Kneeling beside The convent gate  DEATH  Driftwood am I And oblivion seems like the sea That comes creeping creeping Nearer to me  Some day a wave Will pass all the others by And come lapping lapping To where I lie  Then on the tide I shall be taken out to sea Until nothing nothing Is left of me   Elfrida De Renne Barrow  I WONDER  My heart is a small room And life is the light of day That peeps in through the window Joyous and gay  When Time draws down the blind And leaves me to the night Will God come then I wonder And bring me light  Elfrida De Renne Barrow  SPRING MAKES ME WONDER  Always my love for you Was an escaping thing Like gray smoke seen through half green boughs Or the shadow of gray smoke wavering On the bare ground of spring  Why was it never joy Clear joy of looking up Through drifts of porcelain white plum blossoms Into the sky s blue cup  Josephine Pinckney   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MARSH SKETCHES  SEA MARSH  Like a woman who remembers Is the marsh A woman who forgives and yet Whose every mood is dimmed Because forgiving She cannot ever quite forget  None knows her secret heart One can but guess What crying winds have stirred To dumb distress Her quietness What sodden rains have trampled her What lust of August suns She has no words Impassive inarticulate Save for the flight of birds Slow heron slumbrous crane She keeps her counsel Though cities bloom and fade And forests fall She does not change The slow years pause pass And leave no trace   Frances Dickenson Finder  Like snowflakes on a peasant s face So long The seasons have defrauded her There is no festival Upon her calendar In spring no hint of welcoming For the few flowers That seek her smile No song upon her lips How should she sing For nothing whole is hers No perfect gift Only the spent and broken things That drift In from the unrepentant sea  MARSH POOLS  And now I know Where are those stars That slip like jewels Between the night s Most jealous fingers At dusk I found them Where the marsh had hidden them In a silver pocket Of her grey green gown   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SHALLOWS  I must swim out  Overlong have I stayed  Here on the warm shale  Aimlessly played  Gathering sea shells  Empty and frail  One dwindles here Where the tides creep Grows dazzled Gazing too long through the clear Wave at the sun asleep On the sands overnear What if the thought of the deep Should become a fear  I must swim out Lest the urge fail Darken duskward And fade as a sail  Frances Dickenson Finder   TWO POEMS  OPEN A DOOR  Open a door suddenly And you may see Loved ones whom you call dead Happy and free  Listen oh stealthily You ll find it true These whom you weep for Are pitying you  Close the door softly Lest they may learn They have been spied on And never return  JENICE  If Jenice dies who is as white As apple blossoms blanched by night If Jenice dies what shall I care If there be beauty everywhere All beauty will be dead for me The silver moonlight on the sea The shining glory of the skies Will die for me if Jenice dies  May Thomas Milam   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TIDEWATER  HARBOR WATER  All through the night I can hear the sound of dancers Soft

way that glamours out of sight Something of sea and something of the sky Drawn from the earth as blossoming dreams are drawn Most strange are you in this that dreams alight and fly But you dream on all your translucent day  Sweeps of divinest nothingness abyss Of beauty you are the stirred subconscious place Of flowers you are the rathe and virgin mood Of young azaleas  Where heaped branches

EVER since POETRY began it has believed in and tried to encourage a strongly localized indigenous art Such art may not produce masterpieces the gods alone decide that but no one can deny that the world s most precious masterpieces such things as Dante Homer Rembrandt or the old Egyptian sculptors have left us sprang out of intensely local loyalties and attained to universality because the locale grandly handled becomes as wide as the earth and a great master s neighbors re created in his art will speak to the end of time for the whole human race Today especially art needs to concentrate on the locale against the generalizing scattering tendencies of the age else it is in danger of becoming vague and diffused and theoretic of losing precision and vitality So it is consistent that we should offer our readers this Southern Number and should request two leaders of the Poetry Society of South Carolina to share its editorship with our usual staff No one can go talking about poetry through the states of our south eastern coast as I did a year ago without feeling that the local loyalties always dramatically intense in that region are turning with deep enthusiasm toward the arts The people are beginning to realize what wonderful material has been   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  awaiting observant eyes and creative minds romantic episodes of early history and legend involving three strongly contrasted races plantation life and city life and sea life with all their bewildering changes through three centuries of valiant history a landscape of languorous beauty melting into the vividly colored tropical ocean along white stretches of sand and a proud people who have always commanded life a bit cavalierly contrasted with the sweetly indolent humorous more or less loyally subservient African  All this has waited long for its interpreters for the South this particular South especially held more firmly than any other section of the country to eighteenth century literary manners and Victorian sentimentalities Two southern poets escaped the thraldom of course Poe by sheer force of genius driven by egoistic will and Lanier by good taste and a high order of poetic instinct Both spent most of their lives in the neighborhood of Baltimore but more tropical sojourn in the Carolinas and Georgia strongly influenced their imaginations  But Poe was an individualist rather than an interpreter his high lyric strain was an intensely personal magic coloratura of surpassing brilliancy and of an exquisite melancholy beauty It is as southern as Charleston s moss hung Magnolia Gardens and the refuge it creates is as unreal as weirdly remote from earth While one should know that particular South to understand Poe s spiritual sources and sympathies one sees his proud and   This Southern Number  tragic figure slip through like a ghost haunting but touching not the life around him  Nor did Lanier attempt the story His finely observant mind delighted in nature and he remains essentially a landscape poet establishing in such poems as The Marshes of Glynn the rather narrow limitations of his lofty spirit and delicately sensitive talent A worshipper of beauty was Lanier a true poet but hardly a great one  Much remains to be said for this South in the arts For a long time its people were scarcely aware of this fact preoccupied with recovery from a destructive war they were indifferent to the arts Now their attitude is becoming expectant they are at least preparing the way for the poets painters and other artists who shall speak for them Local exhibitions are being held beautiful old houses are being preserved and restored and poetry societies in various cities are gathering together and encouraging the poets who may yet immortalize their place and hour  Of these the Poetry Society of South Carolina thus far the most important is exerting an influence which may yet be felt throughout the South It is appropriate that this society should be centralized in Charleston for as an observer said recently  Charleston is the logical centre for this poetical renaissance because the old culture which is the only thing capable of bringing forth the new is stronger there than in any other southern city not excepting Richmond   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This society is well organized and intelligently conducted offering the stimulus of criticism lectures local contests and prizes with the Blindman Prize of two hundred and fifty dollars as an annual invitation to poets far and near  The groups in Columbia Savannah and Jacksonville are near neighbors of the Charleston society and closely affiliated with it Its example has been felt as far away as the Lone Star State for the Poetry Society of Texas with similar aims is being organized by Mrs Therese Lindsey of Houston and others Texas indeed has been keenly hospitable to modern poets and the ideas they represent many of the more prominent ones are familiar figures in Dallas Austin Waco San Antonio and other cities  The present number attempts to represent the southeastern groups of the Carolinas Georgia and Florida The poems which we print by Mr Heyward and Mr Allen come with one exception from their projected book of Carolina Chansons to be published next autumn which will endeavor to remind their neighbors and those further north as well of the heroic history and romantic legendry of this region much of which will fade from human memory unless the poets make it live  H M   Poetry South  POETRY SOUTH  It is a truism that creative art from its very nature must be original the peculiarly different and unexpected reaction of the artist to his environment This is especially true of poetry the least concrete of the arts and it is this very quality of unexpectedness in the poet constituting as it does so much of the charm of poetry that makes an attempt to forecast the reactions of any group or school of poets a task which calls for the prophetic rather than for the merely constructive critic  Nevertheless poets as a rule are so profoundly affected by their environment that by understanding it if we cannot precisely predict their reactions we can at least say within limits what they will not write about and perhaps even be able to forecast the general tendencies of a school or group in its day and place If in addition to the physical environment we have also some grasp of the historical and ethnic background from which poets speak some comprehension of the immediate social and local problems which surround them in short some knowledge of the poets themselves we shall be able to a large extent to tell not only what subjects they will be most likely to select but also in a more limited sense in what mood they will approach their theme and from mood their style for it is mood that dictates style  It is from this standpoint of physical and spiritual environment from the historical background and from   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  a survey of the tendencies evident in the verse being written by southern poets today that this cursory presentation of the condition of poetry in the South is attempted In so brief a space its statements must be rather general with all the many exceptions implied  Despite some vigorous assertions to the contrary it seems as if southern poetry were going to be decidedly regional in spirit with a quick human appeal but strongly local in tone poetry of and about places Much of American verse is city poetry It is the similarity of our city life perhaps which has given to a great deal of American verse a note of sameness that is too often mistaken for a universal realistic appeal The city too has given American poetry a tendency to mirror back the drab and accentuated an almost morbid desire for self expression which the crowd begets There has been to be sure a gain in thought content and sophistication but the spontaneous and simple have been sacrificed while the constant search for the new has brought about a ceaseless experiment with alien forms It seems probable that poetry written from the South will be in nearly all these respects the opposite of what has rather arbitrarily been called city verse for the South is still predominantly agricultural Although industrialism under the spur of northern capital has ridden in ruthlessly here and there the plantation of one kind or another is still the economic vital unit and it may be expected that when the plantation poet speaks it will not be from the   Poetry South  necessity of introspectively asserting his existence as an individual apart from the crowd but of objectively reflecting in simple measures the patriarchal life remnant about him In this he will very likely be profoundly impressed by his sub tropical or mountain landscapes and reflect the spontaneously lyrical and primarily rhythmic melodies of the Negro Indeed the effect of the Negro on southern poetry demands a treatment by itself  It is significant that the syncopation of the Negro which has found its way into jazz music and verse has seldom been adopted by southern poets This is partly due to a subconscious intellectual color line for strong social and racial prejudices are carried over into art but to a still greater extent the omission of jazz in southern poetry is due to the fact that the short choppy effects of syncopated rhythms do not lend themselves to the intimate mood of memory and contemplation which the South has to express Therefore the more obvious employment of Negro rhythms and the attempts to gain the ear by poems in unauthentic dialect must not be overestimated Due credit must be given however to the Valentine Museum of Richmond for its publication of authentic Negro dialect poetry and its experiments in recording for phonographic reproduction the exact sound of the passing speech of the old Negro Thomas Nelson Page of Virginia Harry Stillwell Edwards and Joel Chandler Harris of Georgia and Janie Screven Hey   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ward of the South Carolina coast country together with a few others are deserving of mention for having created literature which correctly records the Negro dialect of their own localities  The southern muse must be careful how she handles the tar baby but the weird the bizarre and the grotesque in Negro life and story and the tone of the spiritual will have to be reckoned with indeed they have already made themselves felt With the Negro poetry music and the dance are still closely associated as in all primitive races and in the recognition and perpetuation of this condition lies a great opportunity for American art in the South It is much to be desired that the southern group may recognize this immense fund of rich material for poetry which Negro music legends and folk lore hold in trust and that the time may rapidly come when there will be Negro poets who can use adequately the artistic values inherent in their own race and produce something worthy Unfortunately Paul Lawrence Dunbar stands almost alone his was a unique contribution to literature as Tanner s has been to painting  The Negro however is not the only source of folk lore in the South Even richer in poetic material is the lofty back country of the Appalachians The rush of American civilization has thus far touched only the fringes of this rugged land Today one may take a trail from one of the mountain towns and by traveling horseback for fifty miles in from the railroad he will discover for him   Poetry South  self an eighteenth century pioneer settlement provided he is not mistaken for a revenue officer and his route subjected to an immediate change of destination  The mountains of the Carolinas and Kentucky were settled in the days of Daniel Boone and earlier by sturdy Scotch Irish and English pioneers who built their isolated settlements behind the ramparts of rock There sequestered from the flow and change of civilization they have continued to live the life of the pioneer There are certain remote districts in the Black and Great Smoky ranges where life has remained absolutely static for a century and a half There it is still possible to hear old English ballads and folk tales which passed from current use generations ago and one still encounters Elizabethan words Certainly nowhere else in the America of today can one find conditions so favorable to the development of genuine folk expression with the background of an old but still remembered civilization and an absolute isolation which encourages the crystallization by word of mouth of the idea into the story  The mountaineer responds but little to beauty In his great tumble of hills which contains forty six peaks of over six thousand feet including the highest point east of the Rocky Mountains amid a flora that is bewildering in its pageantry of color he is stubborn vindictive in anger elemental as a child in his amusements shrewd silent and unerring in his estimate of the furreners he may chance to meet It should be added here by way   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of extenuation that the mountaineer is naturally on the defensive Living as he does by a code of ethics and morals out of the past he finds himself contending with the incursions of the present and he knows instinctively that he is at a disadvantage  But it is among the mountain women that one finds the pathos and tragedy of these isolated people Burden bearers tillers of the soil the women are old at thirty Their faces tell nothing of their thoughts but there is always a characteristic quality to the speaking voice the tone is low soft and drawling invariably dropping to a lower key at the end of every remark with an effect of hopelessness and infinite sadness  The only emotional outlet for the mountaineer is the religious revival and the occasional neighborhood dance To both of these forms of entertainment he responds with the greatest gusto and the extreme revivalist sects such as the Holiness and the Holy Rollers have made many profitable excursions into his fastnesses But such outbursts can not long combat the native reticence of the people and they soon become self conscious and indifferent  In spite of the fact that the southern mountaineer is probably the most interesting and least known figure in our national life it will be many years before he will write his own story if ever The lack of schools and his rooted indifference to educational advantages will keep him much as he is but he should be transcribed through   Poetry South  the medium of some art before he passes for there is nothing else quite like him on the continent  The statement has been made earlier that southern poetry may be largely of and about places If environment is going to affect our southern poets if they are going to be at all objective this will necessarily follow for there is no other portion of the country so districted  i e where sections differ so one from the other as in the South To pass from the country of the mountain whites to the Carolina Low Country for example is to pass from one world to another one with a different fauna and flora and a different ethnic background Here the poets may tell of the sea islands with tidal lagoons where the wild fowl ducks marsh hens and strange gawky heron feed and the migrating song birds pass through each year like a recurring flame They may speak of magnolia and azalea gardens oriental in a polychromatic spring of swamps and eerie live oak forests where the Spanish moss hangs like stalactites in twilit caverns of the miles of deserted rice fields where turbaned blacks walk ruined dykes and of the ancient baronies and manors each with its legend where the deer feed around the stately columned houses shells of a life and an epoch which have passed away  But if the past does not call the southern poet the thrusting of industrialism into the Piedmont cotton and tobacco regions with the rise of the factory system child labor and a burning racial problem offer a tre   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  mendous theme and a possible chance of legitimate propaganda for the present Then in Florida at such towns as Miami a frontier is being peacefully settled and dotted with villas Roman in their scale and magnificence while from the Everglades the firelight of the stone age Seminole glows in the midnight sky when he holds his secret corn dances Southward stretch the coral keys haunted by huge sea turtles that crawl out to hide their eggs where pirates once hid gold and even today the eagle boat of the whiskey runner shelters there making for Nassau or Bimini Then there are the plains of Texas rich with the dusty golden dreams of Spanish empire with enchanted mesas pueblos Indian stories and cow boy songs or the cane brakes of Louisiana and faded Creole New Orleans of the old river days  How absurd to say the South has nothing but genealogy Who will sing of them these cities of Santa Fe or El Paso San Antonio or St Augustine and of old Charleston with her three hundred years of memories Who is going to write the epos of Coronado of the lost Fountain of Youth of De Soto of the pirates of Africa transplanted of the outlandish voodoo that still lingers and of the strange new Christ the Negroes worship Is there no one who will tell over again from the clearer light of a better time how the awful keen sword of civil war struck down these states how the slave and freedman passed and how through bitterness they have come to a saner sweeter life again Here is a challenge to the American   Poetry South  renascence It is ardently to be hoped that the South will continue to reply to it as she has begun to do and that she will give us largely of her rich landscapes and historical material and speak of and from the life of her memory and of her present And it is also to be hoped that the cleverly inane or the small accidental dream life of the individual so seldom worth uttering tiny loves and smaller hates and the baldly phrased usual above all the banal echo and the purely sentimental will be left unsaid  Faked sympathy and crocodile tears for the past are the stops which the southern poets must most carefully avoid Unfortunately the vox humana pulled out full is still good for a round of applause almost anywhere but in the South there is an inherited bias in its favor  In colonial times no other section of the country was so much affected by the eighteenth century classical school as the South particularly the Carolinas and Virginia New England seems to have preserved and perpetuated almost down to modern times the spirit of the Puritan seventeenth century literature but in the South your Cavalier gentleman imported his advance leaves of the latest books published in the United Kingdom had them specially bound added his book mark and read his Pope his Johnson and his Goldsmith not always his Burke with complete satisfaction Education and plantation tutoring were largely in the dead languages and in South Carolina the old Huguenot French stock read the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  French Bible Voltaire or Rousseau according to their generation Nowhere was the effect upon originality of style more blighting Almost until the civil war the couplet of Pope held full sway the English romantic movement seems to have had little effect upon it verse remained an accomplishment of the idle and the polite extremely sentimental and absolutely eighteenth century in style Even today the old idea that there is a distinct poetic jargon persists in the South and realism in poetry shocks the academic sense while in files of old newspapers and privately printed books that throng second hand book stalls these old voices still tinkle from the dust in their endless couplets In the aggregate an astonishing amount of such verse was written Take General Albert Pike s Hymns to the Gods for instance and William Gilmore Simms who heads the list with eighteen volumes How many single poems survive today  Poe stands out from this crowd of gentlemen poetasters as the great exception He actually developed his own forms not turning to new forms but improving on the old He reflected the life about him for his poems are much more biographical than is generally suspected and most of his verse shows strong southern influence in landscape and rhythms Nevertheless he also did not escape tradition entirely and partly for that reason he seems more European now than American but none the less great for that  It took the civil war to goad southern poets into an   Poetry South  authentic local utterance although there were a few years just before 1861 when it seemed as if the Charleston group Hayne Timrod Simms and some others would make that city a southern literary capital A magazine Russell s was started there under much the same kind of impulse as the Atlantic Monthly but Sumter was fired on and the war put a period to all such activity Both Hayne and Timrod dealt with landscapes and nature but they are chiefly remembered for their war poems and because with a very few others they were the only voices which to any degree adequately phrased the despair of reconstruction Timrod once wrote to Hayne I can embody it all in a few words beggary starvation death bitter grief utter want of hope It is impossible to judge men writing under such conditions by the ordinary standards of criticism The wonder that they wrote at all is only transcended by the miracle that they also achieved some memorable lines  Art as it is the finest expression of the life of a people is the last thing to recover from the ravages of war Reconstruction with its spiritual and economic despair put a gag in the mouths of singers the few voices that did speak were more like croaks than songs However one ludicrous little man by the name of Coogler in Columbia  S C conferred five volumes upon a faintly amused world  Maude for her gentle name was Maude Wore many smiles and they were sad A thousand virtues she possessed Many of which I never had   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This in its own way is really great and the last two lines could have stood truthfully for the relation of the southern poet of that time to his muse for these were the days when prejudices and the heritage of war were too strong to permit of literature being written Shakespeare himself would have been taboo on account of the Dark Lady of the Sonnets That Sidney Lanier should have spoken out of this environment is all the more wonderful He was indeed a protest against his age north and south  O Trade O Trade would thou wert dead The time needs heart tis tired of head Like Poe he developed his own style and theory of verse and was not content simply to use the old forms as Hayne and Timrod had done His knowledge of the two arts of music and verse largely made this possible Lanier was too modern in one sense for his time and too conservative for the moderns He worked against frightful physical and spiritual odds in the seventies and eighties and despite it all at times achieved great beauty He and Poe are of course the great names the South has to offer to American poetry Madison Cawein should not be forgotten These men overcame literary taboos and traditions and dared to have personality with them poetry was not simply polite The last few years have brought a new spirit into the South With the recovery of her economic life has come the possibility of renewing the old culture and an oppor   Poetry South  tunity for a leisure not due to apathy and despair The great war has also stirred and disturbed her subtly and immeasurably till a vast territory which has for a while lain poetically fallow is now awakening and from here and there voices small and inadequate perhaps but nevertheless earnest and distinctive voices are giving it utterance  It is their desire that the rest of the country know and recognize this for while these voices may utter with a timbre peculiarly their own it is because they are moved not by a provincial pride but by the renascence of poetry throughout America and being so moved by this spirit they claim to be of it The South will never express itself in constricted forms mood inclination and tradition forbid nor does it feel the urge completely to slough the old Here where the tides of immigration have brought no alien tongues the grand tradition of English poetry still lingers strongly in an old culture which has survived the wrack of civil war and of reconstruction a European culture planted by a strong stock in colonial times and it is from this tradition and from the descendants of that stock that the southern poetical renascence must come It will accept with modern spirit the new forms in verse but accept them as being valuable for their loosening effect upon the old rather than as being all satisfactory in themselves and it brings to American poetry a little known but tropically rich store of material an unurbanized beauty the possibility of legend folk   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  song romance

Heyward  POE IN SOUTH CAROLINA  In May 1828 Poe enlisted in the army under the name of Edgar A Perry and was assigned to Battery H of the First Artillery at Fort Independence In October his battery was ordered to Fort Moultrie Charleston  S C Poe spent a whole year on Sullivan s Island Professor C Alphonso Smith the well known Poe authority says So far as I know this was the only tropical background that Poe had ever seen That the susceptible nature of the young poet was vastly impressed by the weirdness and melancholy scenery of the Carolina coast country there can be little doubt The dank tarns and funereal woodlands of his landscapes or at least a strong suggestion of them may all be found here The scene of The Goldbug is definitely laid on Sullivan s Island and here are dim

imposed verse patterns it is mistakenly considered a special province of poetic art which it is not It may be an important form only by virtue of its history it is perhaps the only purely romantic system which has become entirely acclimated in periods of great fecundity in our literature it has had the cry of fashion it has attracted profound and celebrated writers Sequences of sonnets have been substituted for that anomaly of our art the long lyric as in Christina Rossetti s Later Life and Donne s Holy Sonnets probably the best we have It is fortunately based on a ten syllable line peculiarly pleasant in the English tongue Within it one can experiment as the Elizabethans did in complex passions and subtle argument properly dramatic It may be made the journal of an introspective or passionate life as in Mr Blunt s Proteus and Esther sequences But   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  its possible rhymes are easily exhaustible in our language and thereafter reminiscent Unlike its musical namesake the sonata there is no esoteric logic or balance to govern it Other forms such as the sestina may set a pace for more varied music I suspect its present dismal distinction is due in part to the mere fact of its obsolescence Modern sonnets are many and usually mediocre Each new bundle arouses one s hope Here after all at last may be the real thing  One s hope is not altogether dashed by Stewart Mitchell s book which contains about two dozen although he does not invent a new music or trouble the old unsubtle cadence The effect never achieved by this poet of a truly great sonnet like Donne s Death Be Not Proud is produced by the clash of a surging internal movement upon or against the rigid scheme Among contemporaries Miss Millay will best bear comparison with her masters in this respect Sonneteers like Mitchell write too much in the pattern with a resultant tonal emptiness or invirility  His art rather reeks of the intellect Vision and passion are strained through nets of speculation and sieves of analysis Nothing actually escapes or would seem quite to satisfy him That any trace of ecstasy is hard to identify may be because he makes the mistake of codification inaccurately associated with the fin de siècle with Ernest Dowson the original work of that subtle translator Arthur Symons et al When human affairs   A Sonneteer  are generalized into parched desire redolent splendor pitiless fates etc the odd commonplace holds true that identity force and conviction go out of them Modes of thought and address preserved as fruit is preserved tend to limit the precision of verse as a means of communication The conditions of life pre determined slavery to be easy and freedom hard says Marianne Moore One wearies to the point of fury of this brand of expressivism  Bring me this evening crimson wine Such as in twilight seems to keep Secrets of death in serpentine Sinuous sleep At its best however this book is not an arid field for those who prefer the rewards of a discreet cultivated mind to the glare and quaver of more fickle if stronger imaginations Glenway Wescott  A FRENCH VICTORIAN  Plays of Edmond Rostand translated by Henderson  Daingerfield Norman Illustrated by Ivan Glidden  Macmillan Co  In spite of certain confusions of idiom this is a rather spirited translation of the most popular French playwright of his day It rhymes almost as lightly and easily as the original and has a similar slam bang movement and the same flavor and color of swashbuckling noisy   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  romance Rostand put it over adroitly with the crowd almost persuaded his audiences that L Aiglon was tragedy and Cyrano high comedy and now that he is dead we have him Englished in extenso and majestically enthroned in an octavo edition with illustrations of a naive sentimentality worthy of 1850  But already the tinsel is tarnished and the loud fame of the dead poet slinks around the corner into the past These plays though of French origin seem as Victorian as The Princess they bear no relation to modern poetic or theatric art  The translator in his preface is at some pains to explain the meaning of Chantecler that subliminal mystery Like so much great poetry he says its application is at once local and universal We refer the faithful to his guidance if anyone has failed to understand Chantecler now is the time for enlightenment  He meant much to the French remarks one who knows them Yes he stressed certain conventions certain traditions as dear to the hearts of Frenchmen as the pioneer cowboy convention stressed by Service et al is to our own That he should further artifi cialize these conventions was inevitable a temperament of such romantic ardor must glamourize and melodrama tize must repay not only principal but interest The public is always grateful for this service great was Rostand s reward in his day But the day was short already it is a quaint yesterday H M  CORRESPONDENCE  NOTES FROM THE P S A ANNUAL DINNER  Which way to the dinner we asked of the doorman at the Hotel Astor  Which dinner do you want to go to he said unrolling a long scroll the Shoe lace and Ribbon Manufacturers banquet the wedding on the ninth floor   The Poetry dinner we told him  Central ballroom straight ahead  Stopped by a jazz band and loud applause we asked again if that was the Poetry dinner No we were told that was the Flower and Feather Manufacturers banquet The Poets opened with organ music their music was over Centre door straight ahead  Yes music for a long time was over through a redundant parade of meats and sauces and the polite murmur of poets and friends of poets broken now and then by loud clapping from without perhaps from the hip flasks of the Flower and Feather Manufacturers of America  A guest at the table where we sat an army captain suddenly wished the dinner might be reported as Rabelais would have done it We wished so too though it seemed a petition for the moon If Rabelaisian eyes and ears were there what could they do but sleep beneath so decorous a murmur of two hundred and fifty poets and friends of poets all in standardized evening array   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Readings and speeches and more speeches in which we were told that poetry in the last twenty years had become a practical traditional force in the life of America that the Poetry Society of America was starting young poets on the right road creating a more catholic art In fact anything now is poetry one speaker permitted himself to say was breaking down the standardized patterns giving the individual a show making the country safe for poetry turning out vital valiant normal practical poets that the poets were too humble that we live in a glorious age for poets that they are a force for good against preachers reformers business men etc etc In the course of which one was glad to meet refreshing honesty in the Nebraskan voice of Edwin Ford Piper light skill in the humoresques of Wallace Irwin flame in the rhymes of John V A Weaver  And in the five hour program there were three numbers in higher relief moments of waking for any Rabelais present those of Chang Peng Chun Amy Lowell and Carl Sandburg  Early in the evening Chang Peng Chun brought a stillness into the room a brief mood of contemplation He wondered if American poetry today was just a passing phase of trenchant curiosity or the poetry of power poignancy and mist To the Chinese he said poetry meant something leisurely unhurried seriously seeking the depths enjoying the feeling of pain happiness He thought of it as an art that might bring about   Notes from the P S A Annual Dinner  in this country a new way of judging values according to human satisfaction and not material gain it might correct the evils of mechanization He ended on an evidently bitter note a hope that China might be made a paradise for China and not for pirates and profiteers He gave these as classic definitions  Poetry is like the sound of the rhythm in the void is like the color in phenomena is like the moon in the water the image in the mirror There is an end in words but the meaning will waft on forever  Two hours more of speakers and Miss Lowell rose and curdled some of the guests by the acid of her anathema against the trend of the evening With the one Chinese exception she damned it as a kind of benefit performance a phonograph repeating encores She called for the sharp clash of critical emotional insight but in vain that evening  At length at midnight Carl Sandburg did what seemed beyond doing brought a maimed and dying audience to life again by magnets of the art which after all they must have come for The room at last began to take on an air of enjoyment extending even to the two surviving head waiters in the wings The definitions he submitted stood beside those fished from Chinese lore poetry a mystic sensuous mathematics of fire smokestacks waffles pansies people and purple sunsets a kinetic arrangement of static syllables the capture of a picture a song or a flair in a deliberate prism of words The mathematics of a long deliberate supple poem The   POETRY A
