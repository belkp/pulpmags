EMBARKATION  UL L masses of dense green The forests range their sombre platforms Between them silently like a spirit The river finds its own mysterious path  Loosely the river sways out backward forward Always fretting the outer side Shunning the invisible focus of each crescent Seeking to spread into shining loops over fields  Like an enormous serpent dilating uncoiling Displaying a broad scaly back of earth smeared gold Swaying out sinuously between the dull motionless forests As molten metal might glide down the lip of a vase of dark  bronze  1  While this the steamboat slowly drifting out upon it Seems now to be floating not only outwards but upwards In the flight of a petal detached and gradually moving sky  ward Above the pink explosion of the calyx of the dawn  HEAT  As if the sun had trodden down the sky  Until no more it holds air for us but only humid vapor The heat pressing upon earth with irresistible languor Turns all the solid forest into half liquid smudge  The heavy clouds like cargo boats strain slowly up gainst its current And the flickering of the heat haze is like the churning of  ten thousand paddles Against the heavy horizon pale blue and utterly windless Whereon the sun hangs motionless a brassy disk of flame  FULL MOON  Flinging its arc of silver bubbles quickly shifts the moon From side to side of us as we go down its path I sit on the deck at midnight and watch it slipping and  sidling Under my tilted chair like a thin film of spilt water  It is weaving a river of light to take the place of this river  2  John Gould Fletcher  A river where we shall drift all night then come to rest in its shallows And then I shall wake from my drowsiness and look down from some dim tree top Over white lakes of cotton like moon fields on every side  THE MOON S ORCHESTRA  When the moon lights up Its dull red camp fire through the trees And floats out like a white balloon Into the blue cup of the night borne by a casual breeze The moon orchestra then begins to stir Jiggle of fiddles commence their crazy dance in the dark  ness Crickets churr Against the stark reiteration of the rusty flutes which frogs Puff at from rotted logs In the swamp And the moon begins her dance of frozen pomp Over the lightly quivering floor of the flat and mournful  river Her white feet slightly twist and swirl She is a mad girl In an old unlit ball room Whose walls half guessed at through the gloom Are hung with the rusty crape of stark black cypresses Which show through gaps and tatters red stains half hid  den away  3  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TH E STEVEDORES  Frieze of warm bronze that glides with cat like movements Over the gang plank poised and yet awaiting The sinewy thudding rhythms of forty shuffling feet Falling like muffled drum beats on the stillness  Oh roll the cotton down Roll roll the cotton down From the further side of Jordan Oh roll the cotton down  And the river waits The river listens Chuckling with little banjo notes that break with a plop  on the stillness And by the low dark shed that holds the heavy freights Two lonely cypress trees stand up and point with stiffened  fingers Far southward where a single chimney stands aloof in the sky  NIGHT LANDING  After the whistle s roar has bellowed and shuddered  Shaking the sleeping town and the somnolent river The deep toned floating of the pilot s bell  Suddenly warns the engines  They pause like heart beats that abruptly stop The shore glides to us in a wide low curve  4  And then supreme revelation of the river The tackle is loosed the long gang plank swings outwards And poised at the end of it half naked beneath the search  light A blue black negro with gleaming teeth waits for his chance to leap  THE SILENCE  There is a silence which I carry about with me always A silence perpetual for it is self created A silence of heat of water of unchecked fruitfulness Through which each year the heavy harvests bloom and  burst and fall  Deep matted green silence of my South Often within the push and the scorn of great cities I have seen that mile wide waste of water swaying out  to you And on its current glimmering I am going to the sea  There is a silence I have achieved I have walked beyond its threshold I know it is without horizons boundless fathomless per  fect And some day maybe far away I shall curl up in it at last and sleep an endless sleep  John Gould Fletcher  5  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A TOWN ON THE RIVER  MY TOWN  I know a town all through Better than I know myself Sometimes I think perhaps it is myself I know this little town lives unproclaimed On the banks of a rushing river I know that it is there And it rests me to know In the quiet of this town There is something living greatly I know that too When I was little I knew it  We played we always played The out of doors was ours The town the prairie the hills and the river Given with God s prodigality We made new games to fit the great playground We played we always played Old and young played  We didn t take God on faith There he stood out in the open And we worshipped him Our hearts bursting with the full blooded joy of it We worshipped him In the rain and the snow and the sun  6  Laura Sherry  In the summer A lavender lady slipper Suddenly come upon in the hills Was an adventure The rock hung coulees The rainbow pearls locked in the flesh of the river clams The unkempt shaggy sloughs hiding away from the enter  prising river In retiring distances muffled echoes of steamboat whistles The silent voices of the trees in the great log rafts travelling  from Minnesota woods to St Louis The season when the hills rang with the songs of the nut  gatherers A flock of wild geese flying south The Indians hot palette splashed on the October hills All all were adventures  And when their brothers called from Picardy  Old and young came from the hills the fields the mills  To fight as they played for the full blooded joy of it  In shell torn trenches  Above the cries of the battle  My people could laugh and shout  There s nothing to worry about  In the hills by a rushing river  A lavender lady slipper blows  I know that it is there  It rests me to know  like to think about it  7  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ON OUR FARM  Indian Bruce and Big Charlie and Bohemian John have gone And boys with white tender hands and weak backs Are cleaning the cow sheds and tossing the hay I wonder over there If Big Charlie still wears a sprig of green in his hat If Bohemian John s pipe has been shot away And if Indian Bruce sings his weird lullabies Coming home in the twilight  THE HUNTER  The lumber jacks called him Pine tree Parker He was long and lean and straight and lovely He hunted big game moose and caribou One year under the north star He got a shot at a polar bear And carried the glistening white hide to the door of the  woman he loved His step was as light as a child s And padded like an animal s But the hard knuckles of his fist split the panel of the door When the woman he loved locked it against him All right girl all right And his light step again sought the woods And big game Moose and caribou  8  Laura Sherry  A WOODSMAN  Yes I know I m tryin to hog these woods I m worse than any capitalist or corporation judge or prof  iteer But damn it I couldn t live in one o them neat little cities I d smother I like to live in a lean to tent Its peak against the air With the flap up so s I can breathe And in the winter jest outside for company A big fire burnin No I ain t advertisin anythin around here It s for them to come who has the eyes to see And sufrerin Moses I ain t prayin God to give em eyes Can t everybody live in the woods it ain t big enough Some have got to live in the city  JEAN JOSEPH ROLETTE  Jean Joseph Rolette Captain of the fortress of Prairie du Chien Envoy extraordinary from John Jacob Astor New York Owner of pelts of the Northwest  Jean Joseph Rolette  9  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Your tomb stands high on the bluff Commanding the river the Northwest and your widow You tamed the blood of the red Indian Made a fortune in furs Captured in St Louis the most beautiful woman in the Mis  sissippi valley Your passionate blood on that adventurous honeymoon Sang lustily As your paddle cut into the strong current And your canoe with its precious voyager Shot through the waves three hundred miles up the great  river  Under an arrogant stone on the hill Your humble ashes rest Peace lies on the valley  But there is adventure in barter And the blood of swift spirits is on the scent Your rival has captured the fur trading post Built a fine house boldly facing the hill Defying your arrogant tomb And married your widow  LOUIS DES CHIENS  The ground under the apple trees is flat Like any other ground Louis des Chiens as he sits in his doorway  10  Laura Sherry  Feels a difference between it and the rest of the garden Old Henri des Chiens And his Indian wife Evening Sun Lie under the apple trees Apple trees planted by two young gods building a new  world Old Henri des Chiens And his Indian wife Evening Sun Lie under the apple trees The new world and the apple trees They left in trust to their son  Louis des Chiens sits restlessly in his doorway Watching the neglected trees shrivel and die The blood of the half breed has fought long I am so fatiguÃ© he mumbles The white boys from the village Ruthless on sacred ground Strip his apple trees and run away laughing They fling at him Dog from a family of dogs  Old Louis sees his red ancestors counting with pride The scalps of white men dangling from their belts Old Louis sees his white ancestors tomahawked Defending white women and little white boys Old Louis sits in his doorway and mumbles It is you who are dog puppy dog Two three four time puppy dog  11  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  BOHEMIAN TOWN  An army of geese cross the prairie by day At sun down they stream in grey and white processionals  through the streets Bohemian Joe sits on his stoop Dreaming into the smoke of his pipe Dreaming of a boy in Bohemia Back of him lies a settlement of squat houses And women with flowered shawls are calling the geese The gleaming coaches of the Burlington express Flash through the street in front of him Beyond the railroad track lives another race Bohemian Joe has not learned the new language and the  new ways But his children have crossed the track And are teaching American in the public schools  Laura Sherry  12  THE CORN FIELD  Five stacks of fodder are waiting in my corn field The last for my barn I shall watch in the weak sunlight A little while though warmth is in the houses Unneeded till now and the drift of the chill of autumn Is falling swiftly to cover my field with silence Soon its unkempt bareness shall be uncovered Completely and its pebbly ground shall tighten In the first frost and no man be there to witness Its lonely withered stubble and at its sky line Smoke of gray sky and delicate twigs of bushes  I have gathered yet await a subtler harvest As others have waited through long years of labor In other fields to find not though the corn s returning Be sure as the quiet and sting of coming winter I have gathered and for my finer harvest Now are waiting but these five stacks of fodder And my love out given at last to my lonely corn field And the planting of love for a distant other reaping Where perhaps my yield shall be garnered with the corn  Charles R Murphy  13  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TOSTI S GOODBYE  In a Southern Garden  Very still she has stood by the stucco wall In the fine dust in the piccaninnies tracks Now that she is going does no one see her no one care  Indian summer still is here cry the virgins on the walks In their old tight muslins and cashmere shawls  But freer than wood smoke she steals from the yard When the last leaves go Dropping one by one on her moving head On her hair as soft as cotton when the bolls are bursting  open In November in the fall Dead leaves that touch the maidens forty one and thirty  nine Rousing in their hearts all the sharp sweet cries Their mouths have never said Till the held down sighs go flying on before Small faint flutters in the thin gold air Blown like feathers to that gleaming head  And lo blackbirds are there feet and wings in her hair  How they swirl against the sun says Josephine to Rose  Walter McClellan  14  FANTASY  My heart is a valley of black tulips Blue black tulips That are sorrow  Your smiles are cool white moonbeams  Faint white moonbeams Of childish laughter  Moonbeams among black tulips Are silver kisses Caressing sorrow  A A Rosenthal  ADORATION  The night has let down her warm dark hair Powdered with Stardust  She has broken the alabaster box Of ointment  She anoints the feet of her god In a passion of fragrance  Languorously She caresses them with the dark of her hair  Hazel C Hutchison  15  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE GYPSY  Where do I live when I m at home The gypsy laughed to me My heartstone s set in the good red loam  And the sky was raised for my own roof tree As he hoists his shell on a shiny track I carry the sky like a snail on my back  Till it dabbles its eaves in the sea  And when dark comes down and its arch grows thin I haven t a place to be lonesome in For I look through the moon like a clean glass pane  And a candle set  In the house of a friend where I ll come again But Lord not yet While the earth is warm to my side and kind  And the mischievous star in the curving tree Is the spark of a wild faun s pipe maybe  He with a mind To happen in for an hour or two Without any words as a pal might do  Where I wake with a baby fern leaf curled In my rumpled palm as a child could come That s where I live when I m at home  Right in the world  Beatrice Ravenel  16  LIFE EVERLASTING  And will you hear the proof now Of immortality An old English tinker Is come to life in me  His feet were on the highroad When buds and bees were young Many a traveller since then Has hummed the songs he sung  He wakened to the bird notes We hear through window bars Vagrant son of the countryside Who slept under the stars  He sat beneath the hedgerows To eat his bread and cheese Every English springtime Is built of things like these  I cannot leave off wondering That such a one as he With all the world to choose from Should come to live in me  Esther A Whitmarsh  17  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WAVES  One by one upon my shore The little waves are laid Each one a new and perfect thing Which the sea has made  From that which is forever old They come forever young The latest faintest echoes Of the song the sea has sung  They echo it in whispers I listen ceaselessly For fear the echoes die away And I should hear the sea  BEAUTY  Why did you stop me God that day Upon my rutted road of living Why might I not have kept my way  And never known your ruthless giving  I should not walk so burdened now Nor be alone in this new land If all there is of beauty in the world  You had not pressed into my hand  Louise Townsend Nicholl  18  TO ONE BELOVED  Because I willed to have it so I went last night where great trees grow And under them I made a bed Of leaves and grasses and my head Was pillowed on the ripened clover   It was beside a mountain stream Where laden branches bending over Make many patterns for a dream And there before I slept I heard The leaves make melodies that stirred An answer in my heart and soon  New beauties flooded from the moon About that cool calm place To me Was given as to stream and grass and tree And now I come this morning to the town  With sunlight over me Like a sun crested river that goes down  To give its light to the sea I am as grass that has known touch of dew I am as leaves the moonlight has shone through  This is the morning when I may express More understanding of your loveliness  Glenn Ward Dresbach  19  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE LAST LADY  I have now no love nor lady Yet I do not wail bereft There are many many beautiful ladies And in the world there is much love left  I have now no love nor lady I have made a brave good bye It is terrible not to have a lady When the summer months run high  And the summer and the autumn And the winter may be gone But my mind is quite decided I shall have no other one  It will need a greener spring time To seed new love in me But in another spring time Ah where shall I be  Matthew Josephson  20  THE PELICAN  Unwieldy huge with no defined Plexus to gauge his gravity An ancient mariner he stands And gravely bends his gaze on me  His black eyes twinkle he confirms The memory of some struggling fish Caught like a jewel in his beak Which serves him both as bowl and dish  The fringed rock buttressing the spray The burnished kelp the sea the sky He views with quiet nonchalance And elephantine majesty  With legs wide spread and solemn mien Like some old graybeard of the seas He balances his heavy chest A metamorphic Socrates  Alice Louise Jones  21  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  GOSPEL WITH BANJO AND CHORUS  Dear ones I have gambled I have rolled the bones  It s the truth praise God  Hell was open

silence  O the flames that are arrows  Shaken in a golden quiver  The flames   O the flames that are sudden ripples  In an imprisoned river  The flames   O the flames that are screaming children  Danced in a slippery lap The flames   O the wide striding shadow of the flames The dark and stately smoke That needs heaven For a floor to die upon  O burning Fire Tearing the face of the midnight Hissing into the ear of silence  O red mouth And yellow teeth Of Fire  24  Isidor Schneider  I have seen you eat up trees and houses  And fatten Till your obese shadow covered the sky  But men are your delicacy Men whose flesh is flavored with the blood of God  You eat them with a hungry joy With flames flung upward As though with arrows To spit the souls  How you pant When you steal into a house And search  For a man  We can yell louder than you Our shriek is leaner and longer W e call for the touch of you to prickle our flesh Like insidious lewd fingers  When the night grows over the houses With broad black leaves When silence shuts And sounds are like grits In a shell W e come to you  O snarling Fire  25  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Oh curse grovelling on the ground Where the sky hurls you  Oh we stand close around You you are the god whose touch is death Who piteously asks for deaths Oh oh to embrace you To become Fire Always him whom we destroy Death makes a god  Our faces gleam We are cheeks of wet coral And our sweat is as hard as diamonds Our shouts spurt And our smiles Are like nooses that have caught our joy And we watch your feast  O red mouth With yellow teeth   The skin puckers up from the flesh  How your breath grows heavy  The blood drops into your tongue  The hiss is a snap of teeth  Pain beats like a heart  Pain is the heart  And the blood of pain flows swiftly   Swiftly   26  Isidor Schneider  O Fire grow dark Call the shadows to pick your teeth Lie back and rest Your shadow in the distance grows numb W e are exhausted with too much joy  The keenness of our pleasure has grown dull W e are like lovers  Nodding at last within the marriage bed Our drained eyes seeking the swelling breast of the night  Heal for us the darkness and the silence  Now we can talk of our pleasures  Talk is like licking the lips   Better than goading animals  Into crouched fear  Or strangled pain  Better than beating with sticks  Or prodding where pain breaks quickly  Better than tearing at girl s flesh  And letting the fingers suck  At the bleeding maidenhood  Better than all the terrible lusts  O green laughter of Herodias  O leper white feet of Astarte  O self embracing totem poles  Better than all the terrible lusts  Is to give a man  To fire  27  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A MEMORY  What shall I remember of this day  The song that I uttered at rising  I have forgotten it  The tapestry of yellow sunlight  Over the wall of the house opposite  I have seen a richer cloth  The scampering of the little white cat which seemed to be dancing with its own fleas The empty leg of my trousers which the arm of the chair  held up The milk and bread of my breakfast The untroubled blackness of the hallways In which even a shadow might stumble And which knows no day and no night Only Time Who passes by trailing a dusty coat tail The morning hush of the streets where one could hear the  gutter drains gurgling The sleek clouds that had fattened on the dew The ring of my own feet on the pavement Sounding doubled as though I were running to meet my  self  Doors are sieve holes with a sift of people And on Fifth Avenue they become a heap But through them all I can see myself coming nearer  28  Isidor Schneider  Over the tall man s shoulder Around the stout man s torso Bodies are diaphanous They have been worn thin by the usage of my vision  A smile lies on them like the glint of a bubble A bright face like a tatter of rainbow Clothing a bubble  Through them I see myself walking toward me And here I have met myself on a piece of paper  This shall be my memory for to day  THE HEROES  This is the procession of heroes Tall and stately they are And their feet are hard And crush the flowers  So have they gone through the ages the heroes Heads lifted into a heaven Where their eyes could mix with the visions But forever their hard feet Trod the flowers under  Yesterday my friend joined the procession These are his feet that you hear on the road They are tramping the flowers under  Isidor Schneider  29  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  FRUGALITY AND DEPRECATION  OETRY arriving this month at its eighth birthday a great age among special magazines may fitly pause and reflect Subjects for reflection are numerous but perhaps two will be sufficient for one article and even these two may be essentially one the general American attitude toward our poets and their poetry The first division of this subject might be entitled Frugality the second Deprecation  Consideration of frugality is enforced upon us at this moment by the puff ball finance of this post war period the general inflation of prices which we are compelled to emulate if we would survive In government lists and other official catalogues POETRY is classed as a trade paper along with  The Breeders Gazette Bakers News Barrel and Box The Billiards Magazine and hundreds more from A to Z Of all the many lines of human activity represented in those closely printed columns probably the poet s trade is the only one possessed of but one organ of some apparent authority and permanence and it may be that no other trade supports its organ with such severe and chastening discipline of frugality If all poets actual and potential would only subscribe for their magazine as eagerly as all millionaires achieved and aspirant subscribe for the Wall Street Journal POETRY would be lifted far above paltry considerations of the H C L  But if poets enforce on their organ this iron discipline  30  of frugality matched in the spiritual sphere by that of critical austerity so the great American public enforces the same discipline on its poets In these days of leaping expenses POETRY has not been able to raise its paltry rates to them and probably other magazines would tell the same tale The three or four prizes given them in this rich country show little increase in number or size and no scholarships are as yet endowed The millionaire collector who pays twenty thousand dollars for a first edition of Poe s Tamerlaine would not hand over five hundred to keep some other starveling poet alive or print a book for him which may some day be a prize of collectors This editor comes across cases of poignant necessity and suffering the failure to relieve which and thereby release brilliant talent for its true work is an absurdity of our civilization As the New York Nation said last March in its editorial A Broker in Books  The pitiful amount of public or private assistance given to American artists men of letters scientists is one of the scandals of our civilization Even England by the pensions of her Civil List has done infinitely more than we And in countries where Anglo Saxon neglect of the arts is not a tradition literature has for a hundred years been encouraged as we have not even dreamed of encouraging it We are the richest people in the world and we are importing the rarest books as fast as we can find them and dislodge them Yet we have practically no pensions or prizes for literature and almost no endowment of research  Our scholars spend exhausting and prohibitive hours at teaching or editing to keep themselves dustily alive Our poets even our successful poets paid less for years of admirable work than a successful painter may receive for the work of a few weeks or even days must live on the very margin of subsistence or else devote the greatest part of their strength to trivial work If the  31  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  state will not pay as much attention to such matters as it pays to experiments on hog cholera or the eradication of poultry pests our men of great wealth might be expected to take a hand Yet every day brings tales of amounts paid for books of merely eccentric or fashionable value the income from which would sustain some precious career of poetry or learning  From this iron discipline of frugality enforced on our poets by their fellow countrymen let us pass to the second division of our subject shall we call it the brazen discipline of deprecatory skepticism  We are accused of being a boastful race or agglomeration of races and in certain crude and obvious commercial specialties perhaps we have earned the impeachment but we have never boasted enough of our men and women of original creative genius never believed enough in the distinction of their achievement or sufficiently impressed upon them our sense of its value We have waited for Europe to remind us of them the cases of Poe and Whitman of Wilbur Wright and Willard Gibbs are only too typical and we have withheld due recognition and reward until the foreign wreath was sent over to decorate their brows or more often their graves  What might not be said for American poetry of the past  eight years if our Kultur were energized with as militant  a national consciousness as that of our late enemy Listen  to this rounding up of the new German poets sent from  Berlin to the London New Age by our former compatriot  Herman George Scheffauer who has been in the country  of his ancestors since 1915 when he went there from  England  32  Frugality and Deprecation  In Germany a new voice is rising out of the discordance perhaps one that will dominate it In this voice there is a note of eternity it is tidal  Whole choirs of poets have arisen following a new star and burning with a new message to men Let the Englishman who reads German procure for example Dr Kurt Pinthus anthology Mensch heits Diimmerung Let him read Theodor DÃ ubler Franz Werfel Johannes Becher Ludwig Rubiner Walter Hasenclever August Stramrn RenÃ© Schickele Georg Heym Oskar Loerke and scores of others Let him give ear to the sonorous symphonic note of the artisan poets of the Werkleute Nyland movement Jacob Kneip Wilhelm Vershofen Josef Winckler The book shops swarm with books the titles the very bindings of which cry out that they have arisen new fledged out of ruins A new age is climbing out of the Past  To day more vital poetry is being published and read in Germany than ever before and this is again characteristically German probably more enemy than in enemy lands themselves The price of paper and printing has reached ruinous heights yet so intense is the thirst for books that more are being published than in war time or in peace time when Germany s production reached  1912 34 800 volumes England s 12 100 France s 9 600 or 51 25 and 24 per head of population respectively  Now I have never listened to those choirs of poets  whose names Mr Scheffauer rolls off with such enthusiasm  my German is insufficient even if their books had crossed  the ocean So I have no right to confess a private skep  ticism in regard to the brilliancy of their new star and  the potency of their new message My point is simply  to contrast the enthusiasm of their audience with the depre  catory skepticism of ours and to urge upon our country  men a little of that loyalty to one s own which is perhaps  over developed in Germany  Of course I should be willing to pit our present day  poets man for man or choir for choir against those of any  33  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  country in Christendom because I believe aided by such  small linguistics as I possess and fortified by such information  as I can gather that no other group is doing work so vital  and various and beautiful so true to the locale and to mod  ern life So let us assume Mr Scheffauer s attitude and  capture his eloquence for the service of our own poets  perhaps even improve upon it as follows  In America a new voice is rising out of the clamor and tumult perhaps one that will dominate the storm In this voice there is a note of eternity it is tidal  Whole choirs of poets have arisen following a new star and burning with a new message to men Let the European who reads American procure for example Dr Monroe s anthology The New Poetry as well as the files of her magazine Let him read Carl Sandburg Edgar Lee Masters Vachel Lindsay Ezra Pound John Gould Fletcher Amy Lowell Robert Frost Edwin Arlington Robinson Wallace Stevens and scores of others Let him give ear to the sonorous symphonic note of the socialist poets of the labor movement James Oppenheim Arturo Giovannitti C E S Wood and many more Let him listen to the clear singing of women sopranos like Sara Teasdale and Edna Millay mezzos and contraltos like Helen Hoyt Alice Corbin Agnes Lee and Eunice Tietjens Let him be amazed at the variety of mood and manner displayed from the romantic rhyming balladry of William Rose BenÃ©t to the Imagists delicate discoveries of new beauty set forth in new measures from Vachel Lindsay s rich orchestrations of the white pioneer the Negro and the Chinaman to the aboriginal tunes of Dr Gordon and Miss Skinner from the high aesthetic aloofness of Wallace Stevens to the democratic loving tenderness of Carl Sandburg and the searching almost surgical realism of Edgar Lee Masters The book shops swarm with books the titles the very bindings of which cry out that they have arisen new fledged out of the spiritual need of a thinking imaginative people A new age is climbing out of the Past  To day more vital poetry is being published and read in the United States than ever before The price of paper and printing has reached ruinous heights yet more books are being published than in war time or in peace time when the production reached  will some statistician supply the figures  34  Frugality and Deprecation  How does it sound this German eloquence applied to our own poets If as is certain this is not over praise why should it not be uttered Why should we always smile and deprecate and question with a niggardliness disguised as scrupulous intellectuality Such an attitude conceals our most precious spiritual treasures and deceives the rest of the world It lays us open to such charges as Mr Scheffauer hurls at us from the capital of his land of poets and thinkers whose latent creative energies have gone forth to conquer a new empire From that lofty Prussian vantage ground we and our former Allies are Brute Might armed to the tusks and Germany is molding the New Renaissance of Humanity content to leave the offal and rubbish of a doomed mechanized and mammonized epoch to those to whom these things are still Baal  The people of America should learn that their poets cannot do their work alone An artist must feel his neighbors behind him pushing urging arousing him if he is to achieve his utmost The great epochs in any department of human activity come only when a strong creative impulse in the minds of the few meets an equal impulse of sympathy in the hearts of the many A masterpiece is no isolated miracle but a conspiracy between a man of genius and his epoch  H M  THE DISCIPLES OF GERTRUDE STEIN  It is somewhat rashly concluded by many English and even by some American critics that the literature of the  35  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  United States has had no considerable effect on that of Europe If we consider modern French poetry at all closely it is possible to trace a distinct and growing American influence Baudelaire who condescended to copy Longfellow in his sonnet Le Guignon was profoundly influenced by Edgar Allan Poe MallarmÃ© was also a translator of Poe and as these two Frenchmen share with Verlaine the mastership of Symbolisme the whole of that vast and fertile movement may be said in some degree to have originated in America  Coming to more recent days we find with the French Unanimistes that Whitman has ousted Poe Leaves of Grass some poems of which were translated in Paris as early as 1871 was translated in full a few years ago by M LÃ©on Bazalgette and even M Claudel has tried his hand at a few Whitman poems French poetry from about 1908 to 1914 was largely Whitmanian I run over these facts so well known as scarcely to need repetition by way of introducing the new school of French humorist poets who derive from the works of Miss Gertrude Stein and typographically from the newspapers of Mr Hearst The Raven Leaves of Grass Tender Buttons are three impingements of American genius upon the mind of Europe  French humor from the earliest times has been marked by a kind of ferocious irony and a self mockery very astonishing to Spaniards and Englishmen but clearly it has some kinship with American calculated facetiousness I need only  36  The Disciples of Gertrude Stein  refer to the satiric fabliaux of early France and to the writings of Rabelais Claude d Esternod Claude le Petit and in the nineteenth century Aristide Bruant and Laurent Tailhade to prove how persistently this humorous strain has endured Since about 1912 there has been a revival of more or less humorous poetry in France The poÃ¨tes futuristes the poÃ¨tes cubistes the simultanÃ©istes the fantaisistes and lastly the Dadaistes have contributed in varying degrees to the gayety of nations Obscurity of diction extreme fragility of thought a pleasing vacuum in place of a subject and typographical excesses are the hallmark of genius with this  new group  In the short space allotted me I cannot hope to give a really adequate account of these numerous and talented authors or even to comment on them at any length What I can do is to translate a few typical specimens and leave the reader to fill in his own comments I begin with the late Guillaume Apollinaire a man of considerable erudition and a writer of novels and literary criticism Like other French disciples of Miss Stein Apollinaire omitted the triviality of punctuation and as his vers libre has no strongly marked rhythm I compress my translation into prose form to economize space  Thy scarlet face thy biplane transformable into a hydroplane thy round

rings of gold near sandals in the sun are lighted but the hair is the trolley across Europe dressed in little many coloured fires  This work is entitled Rotsoge a word I cannot find in  any dictionary nor can anyone tell me what it means The  poem itself does not suggest to my incomplete intelligence  what Rotsoge means Indeed I do not know what the poem  means but the syntax proves it a masterpiece After  Apollinaire who may be considered the first French apostle  of Steinism I come to other not less talented poets Th e  works of M Blaise Cendrars are frequently tainted with  intelligibility and he has written some poems which display  both emotions and ideas He is not an out and out Steinist  but the following quotation from his book Du Monde  Entier will show what he can

DermÃ©e and CÃ©line Arnauld I know nothing of them beyond their works It is noticeable that the style of these ladies and gentlemen so obscure in their poetry is comparatively limpid in their advertisements their names are also easy to read  Americans who believe with me that literature is something more than a series of little jokes leg pullings astonishing the grocers and so on must forgive me for throwing the ultimate responsibility for this new art upon America Perhaps Italy with Marinetti should bear some of the blame but Tender Buttons and America are the real parents Richard Aldington  REVIEWS  CAMOUFLAGE  Reynard the Fox or the Ghost Heath Run by John Masefield Macmillan Co Enslaved by John Masefield Macmillan Co  John Masefield is almost too good to be true too divinely simple and child like Here are his two latest books one a superior nursery rhyme for growing up and adult boys and girls and the other mostly romantic tales creaking with all the old machinery the first long narrative Enslaved giving us actually a lovely lady abducted by pirates followed by her voluntary slave lover rescued by him from the Khalif s  40   Camouflage  own harem and finally freed from sentence of death by the noble autocrat when he hears of the heroic adventure  The super naÃ¯vetÃ© of a mind which can indulge in such romantic and acrobatic stunts in sober middle life is a faculty upon which we must congratulate the poet and the world Reynard the Fox is a rattling good story which is like to replace Hiawatha and The Lady of the Lake in school catalogues and carry on for several more generations the grand old English tradition of fox hunting The poet s hero the fox is more vividly alive perhaps than any man or woman in all his books but the various human types not to mention the horses and hounds are sketched in with a lively sympathy the country squire and his wild riding sons and daughters the groom and huntsman the vicar and the lordling all those familiar figures of English country gentleman life who still follow the hounds exactly as their ancestors did half a thousand years ago in spite of inconvenient modern obstacles Here for example is an equestrian portrait almost worthy of Chaucer himself  A pommle cob came trotting up Round bellied like a drinking cup Bearing on back a pommle man Round bellied like a drinking can The clergyman from Condicote His face was scarlet from his trot His white hair bobbed about his head As halos do round clergy dead He asked Tom Copp How long to wait His loose mouth opened like a gate To pass the wagons of his speech He had a mighty voice to preach Though indolent in other matters He let his children go in tatters  41  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And here is Reynard pictured at the moment of swiftest chase when his game heart gulped and he put on steam and escaped  Like a rocket shot to a ship ashore The lean red bolt of his body tore Like a ripple of wind running swift on grass Like a shadow on wheat when a cloud blows past Like a turn at the buoy in a cutter sailing When the bright green gleam lips while at the railing Like the April snake whipping back to sheath Like the gannet s hurtle on fish beneath Like a kestrel chasing like a sickle reaping Like all things swooping like all things sweeping Like a hound for stay like a stag for swift With his shadow beside like spinning drift  Enslaved I confess is too much for me Byron writing The Corsair knew what he was doing he was writing for women as he put it bluntly in asserting that his memoirs destroyed alas by those two false friend snobs Moore and Murray were written for men But whom is Mr Masefield writing for in this post war period when even fine ladies are wearing short skirts and sitting in Parliament Pirates and khalifs are as much out of fashion as the smooth rhyme bounded line cut iambics in which the tale is told all early in the April And this be furbelowed balderdash is by the author of Gallipoli by a man who lived and suffered through the Great War and wrote one of the most mournful and beautiful poems in the war anthologies  We have in Mr Masefield a curious example of a man who cheats his mind feeds it sugar plums and sleeping draughts He is not of course a profound or original thinker but his meditative poems in Good Friday and  42  Camouflage  Lollingdon Downs are the earnest inquiry of a typical  modern mind into the meaning of life one whom science  has deprived of its orthodox God and its faith in personal  immortality This is the feeling expressed once more in  the finest and sincerest poem of this latest volume The  Passing Strange of which we quote the closing stanzas  So in this water mixed with dust The byre cock spirit crows from trust That death will change because it must  For all things change the darkness changes The wandering spirits change their ranges The corn is gathered to the granges  The corn is sown again it grows The stars burn out the darkness goes The rhythms change they do not close  They change and we who pass like foam Like dust blown through the streets of Rome Change ever too we have no home  Only a beauty only a power Sad in the fruit bright in the flower Endlessly erring for its hour  But gathering as we stray a sense Of Life so lovely and intense It lingers when we wander hence  That those who follow feel behind Their backs when all before is blind Our joy a rampart to the mind  Yet we find him in another poem offering the sedative  And now perhaps the memory of their hate  Has passed from them and they are friends again  Laughing at all the troubles of this state  Where men and women work each other pain  43  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Indeed he is constantly slipping out of his own richly romantic epoch blown by all the eager winds of change and evading its beauty and terror He escapes not only by excursions into pirate haunted seas and fox hunted downs but by feeling and presenting modern life as melodrama in such narratives as The Widow in the Bye Street and The Everlasting Mercy instead of searching it as truth He lulls his soul with out worn orthodoxies and conventions just as he dulls his art with clichÃ©s and then excuses himself with the plea of aging energies as in these few lines of the poem On Growing Old  Be with me Beauty for the fire is dying My dog and I are old too old for roving Man whose young passion sets the spindrift flying Is soon too lame to march too cold for loving  Only stay quiet while my mind remembers The beauty of fire from the beauty of embers  It s too early for that kind of talk Mr Masefield It is mere self indulgence sleepiness of the spirit In the fifties a poet should not be too old for either roving or loving certainly not for thinking H M  FLINT AND RODKER  Other world by F S Flint Poetry Bookshop London Hymns by John Rodker The Ovid Press London  If I cannot say that these two poets have genius if I am unable to persuade myself of their immortality I can at least declare that I find the art of Mr Flint infinitely  44  Flint and Rodker  preferable to that of Mr Rodker The value of a writer to his generation as a representative of his generation to other times is fluctuating and capricious In honesty no man can say of a book more than what it means to him he can express only his own reactions The works which the future critic will choose as representing to him the spirit of this time cannot be a matter of more than remote speculation Therefore we shall not try to imagine that we are dealing with imperishable masterpieces but shall confine ourselves to the proposition that Otherworld and Hymns are each the expression of a Londoner during the second decade of this century Let us see what these poets imagine life and art to be and so discover what they themselves are  Melancholy sometimes a little bitter sometimes mellowed by reflection an eager love of beauty which is often thwarted and disappointed an essential sweetness homeliness and good sense above all an instinctive gusto for ordinary human life in spite of all the weakness and folly and sordidness these are the qualities I find in Mr Flint s Otherworld The long poem which gives its name to the book is simple and moving It is a contrast and a desire a contrast between the maimed incomplete existence of daily life and the full healthy joy that life might be if all things concurred a desire even a yearning to create this not unreasonable earthly paradise at least in the imagination Already one or two superior people have found this dream a thing to sneer at it is altogether too simple and homely for their refined tastes Mr Flint s emotions are  45  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  not of a truly large and generous spring says the Times Literary Supplement the vision of the infinite in its transcendence is beyond his ken Perhaps it is I for one do not know the infinite in its transcendence and I should not be able to recognize it if I met it But I confess I am moved by Otherworld even if it is not large and generous in the Sir William Watson Reynard the Fox Mr Brett Young manner beloved of the Times I admit I am moved by the poet who confesses himself and his dreams so simply and unaffectedly who is tired of being a servant at a paltry wage who longs for a house in the country where his wife and children could be happy and well fed where he could have his books his reveries and the society of the friend who loves him I confess I cannot compass the noble and generous emotions of the Times reviewer which enable him to dismiss Mr Flint with such refined condescension Like Mr Flint and unlike the Times reviewer I am a humbly born rather ignorant sort of person I am quite out of it in the society of dukes and transcendent infinities perhaps that is why I am so moved by doubtless plebeian emotions in reading Otherworld The superior  reader must pay no attention to my opinion he must read the superman in the Times from whom he will receive the pure gospel of transcendent snobbery  The shorter poems in this book have the same direct simplicity as Otherworld They show on a smaller scale Mr Flint s control of his art Sometimes as in Trees he gives in emotional revery the sensations of his childhood sometimes  46  Flint and Rodker  as in Zeppelins and Lament he gives poignant pictures or meditations on war more often these lyrics are the expression of a mood of exquisite perceptions of a sort of spiritual contrast between reality and imagined beauty In all of them I feel a healthy mind struggling against bitterness and discouragement an intense sincerity a realism which is neither sordid nor affected for nowadays even realism can be affected He is himself he is an individual without being either grotesque or unintelligible his originality is very seldom consciously sought  I find Mr Rodker s Hymns the exact opposite of Mr Flint s book Where the one is all candor simplicity naturalness and health the other is affectation insincerity falseness and disease I can find little in Mr Rodker s hymns which is not the expression of a vain and morbid sensibility When he talks about avalanche pickled in splintered quartzes I yawn when he screams Under the whips of men the skin shreds off I bleed from every pore my compassion is quenched by repulsion for this mawkishness Ã  la LeautrÃ©amont and when he feebly damns the universe in his pretentious Hymn of Hymns then I am frankly sorry for Mr Rodker who finds life such a devastating and unpleasant process Numerous remarks scattered through these pages are possibly intended to cater to the amateur of furtive pornography they can serve no other purpose  There is something painfully weak and dismal in this work Its affected style where mixed and mangled metaphors are panted out in telegraphic journalese is the husk  47  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of a terrible spiritual sterility painful to envisage There was once a man who said En art tout est faux qui n est pas beau a strong though noble dogmatism Mr Rodker is not of the opinion of M France he would say En art tout est faux qui n est pas sale It is the fashion of the day  It pleases me to congratulate Mr Flint on not following the fashion so perfectly congruous to Mr Rodker s intelligence Richard Aldington  THREE POETS OF THREE NATIONS  Messines and Other Poems by Emile Cammaerts with  English translations by Tita Brand Cammaerts John  Lane Co  Reading Cammaerts one has in mind Verhaeren But the sombre Verhaeren with his heart of rumbling machine has become smiling vaguely and sentimentally smiling telling us a tale which we can t believe Yes in Belgium besides the tempest and the earthquake that were Verhaeren one imagined and asked for the serenity and peace and smile that are over all the countries in the world But the smile and serenity that came are rather fit to soothe children than to satisfy our desire  However one cannot deny that some of these sweet words are actually sweet  Du linge sur une corde au bout du jardin Bat de l aile dans la brise rieuse  48  Three Poets of Three Nations  Je crois en ce brin d herbe qui pousse sur mon abri Je crois ce que je vois It is obvious that Cammaerts strives towards the simple wistfulness of the folk song and the startling naivetÃ© of the modern but his naivetÃ© lacks subtlety and his song is too light ever to resemble folk song  Life Immovable by Kostes Palamas translated by A E  Phoutrides Harvard University Press  Kostes Palamas is so an American Greek professor and a French critic assure us incontestably the greatest European poet of these days To call anyone the greatest poet without telling us just how great is a miserable stunt of poor criticism Well how great  We are helpless too We can t say The translator has put a mask on his face not a cheap mask but incontestably a mask Evil demons seized my all My frame is bent thrice beautiful thrice happy thrice wonderful magic beauty s charms if these be features of a face the face is certainly not that of the greatest poet But we perceive that a mask is on it for even in the translation Kostes Palamas size can be guessed by the quantity of his poetry descriptions are minute to the tiniest particular and symbols are presented to the faintest line of their contours One may not however call these descriptions startling or exact because the language of the translator is not such and for the same reason one may not call these symbols real A gorgeous symbolism which in order to succeed demands the full strength and precision of pure words is  49  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  wasted by the correct I said not a cheap mask quite an expensive one indeed but ugly too but cold and limp English of the translation It is as though some of the beauty of the original had forced its way through the hurdles of the professor s English Some very lovely words in this book strike one as helplessly accidental And one does not know whether when the gorgeousness becomes pompousness which happens often the change is due to uninspired translating or to the overmuch self satisfied sense of form of the Greek national genius  To be sincere we suspect that superlative greatest There s too much of the old mythological rhetorical highbrow stuff too poetical for these days of gas masks and Einstein Theories and we cannot blame that on the translator There is too much of the involved long winded symbolism that makes Hawthorne boresome to modern readers educated to the brevity and the sharpness of say a Carl Sandburg or an Alfred Kreymborg  Altogether it is a puzzling proposition I am reminded of seeing once two English translations of that truly greatest poet Giosue Carducci and of being convinced how few were the chances that an American who does not know Italian would ever get the beauty of his work How easy it had been for both translators to make palaver and doggerel out of Carducci s beautiful Ode alle Fonti del Clitumno  And as for the rest of the European poets we ask how a comparison of Kostes Palamas with Jean de BosschÃ¨res  50  Three Poets of Three Nations  would run De BosschÃ¨res would be just Greek to Palamas and Palamas much worse to de BosschÃ¨res  One thing definitely strikes me Palamas is a promoter of Neo Greek of a living language versus an ancient dead one and the language of the translation is stale and pseudo Elizabethan  The Soothsayer by Verner von Heidenstam Four Seas Co  Here s another greatest a Nobel Prize winner If there was any beauty in the original only God or a Swedish speaking man may know The idea is Thou canst not serve two gods and the play is a play of ancient Greece where you were supposed to serve not only two but a hundred gods at once And the play shows the tragedy and horror of serving two gods instead of only one isn t it awkward  But all in all what lack of faith in our beautiful world makes these poets find refuge in stale legends of ancient Greece And what perversion is this of a man who has no enthusiasm for us living and finds grandiloquent words to give to a bunch of dead men The explanation is this Heidenstam has been the great champion in Sweden of the more classical school so says the cover writer and he goes on speaking of the beautiful in literature and other such ugliness Emanuel Carnevali  51  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ARGENTINE DRAMA  Three Plays of the Argentine Juan Moreira Santos Vega  The Witches Mountain Edited with an Introduction by  Edward Bierstadt Duffield amp Co  The Brazilians have their race of peerless aborigines typified by Guarany the Indian demi god of unofficial tradition The people of the Argentine have their gaucho who takes most characteristic shape in the person of Santos Vega the singer of the pampas defeated only by the devil himself incarnate as Juan Sin Ropa modernity progress the ruthlessly impersonal  Of the three plays translated by Jacob S Fassett Jr and conscientiously edited by Mr Bierstadt The Witches Mountain is the single example of the modern conception of drama Its action is the expression of a psychological sequence in the emotional experience of its characters but this psychology is on a broad plane where motives are simplified to a point which elevates a theme of every day until it touches the proportions of the heroic The alchemy of this method of transmuting clay into gold is best known to Scandinavian romanticists such as BjÃ²rnson It is the technique of realism modified to serve the romantic spirit Jacobson used it in Marie Grubbe  Romanticism is the wish motif in life justified in art only when through naivetÃ© it avoids the laxity of sentimentality or when consciously it presages tragedy by a vainglorious militance The sense of tragedy is invariably tinged with the romantic spirit and the partial disappearance of this  52  Argentine Drama  sense from the work of the most modern writers in prose and verse is it seems to me an evidence of the indecisiveness of a complex consciousness which no longer challenges the gods with a whole heart  The Witches Mountain is the best of the plays in the literary sense but it reveals less of the spirit of a race than the episodic dramas which precede it Mr Bierstadt gives us a fair outline of the development of a theatre in the Argentine telling us that the gaucho dramas were originally introduced to supplement the performance of the circus a platform was erected in one part of the ring where more or less impromptu tableaux were enacted These playlets dealt with local conditions or incidents but the interest of audiences gradually centered about certain traditional characters who had a popular appeal and around these figures the dramas crystallized From such beginnings sprang a theatre which had a national inspiration  The gaucho is the minstrel of the Argentine and the plays here set forth as prose were in the original Spanish largely compositions in verse often to be declaimed or sung to musical accompaniment Mr Bierstadt quotes Alfred Coester who tells us that the cantor or professional troubadour of the plains possessed a repertory of popular poems in octosyllabic lines variously combined into stanzas of five ten or eight lines He was wont to intersperse his heroic songs with tales of his exploits but his original poetry was clumsy monotonous and irregular and he was more occupied with narration than with the expression of feeling  53  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Juan Moreira more indigenous in composition than Santos Vega which is a young Spaniard s dramatized version of a poem by Obligado utters the sentiments of a race still unsophisticated but no longer primitive in feeling In short it springs from a soul which has discovered for the first time the enhancement of a lie It is childish rather than childlike for it is the expression of a being who no longer deceives himself and is deliberately rhetorical  Santos Vega is based on a common Argentine legend which has been handled before in various forms There is triteness in this interpretation but there are also moments of beauty and of the epic quality to be found in childlike races Santos Vega with perfect spontaneity flings the winds of the pampas about him like a cloak and the posture he assumes is at the same time puerile and godlike  In Brazil there has been no poetic movement comparable to the one which gave rise to these dramas criollos for the Portuguese American has left it to the pedantic exponents of his early literary culture to reveal the glorious vanity of his traditions The vaqueiros it is true have songs in feeling much like those which our negroes have taught us of similar poetic value and with an impromptu dramatic quality and there are sambas of African origin also that mingle recitative with the dance recounting in intimate fashion the woes or joys of a class which has escaped slavery only to find itself in peonage  However in Brazil the formal art of the theatre and especially the poetic drama has been an imposition rather  54  Argentine Drama  than an expression and in the instances in which I have seen the people participate as creators it has never been more than a tawdry adaptation of a convention already stale The Brazilian nature is more facile than the Argentine and is almost fatally assimilative To me a most characteristic figure was a barefoot shepherd of the Itagiba Mountains who being fatherless accepted the definitive appellation of Chico Musico a tribute to his talents as a performer on the accordion This person who could neither read nor write who had never been farther from the fazenda of his patrÃ¢o than the village where the weekly feira was held composed technically presentable sonnets that were in flawless conformity with the emotional commonplaces of civilization  Evelyn Scott  CORRESPONDENCE  DISARMAMENT  Dear POETRY May a former A E F man now offer you this Song of a
