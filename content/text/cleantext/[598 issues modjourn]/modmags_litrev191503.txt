in America WILL LEVINGTON COMFORT enemy has written a book This is not man to man enmitybut there need be no quibble about itFor seventeen years I have studied TRas representative of that America which has consistently betrayed the finer aspirations of our peopleshamed the real workmanbewildered the young in millions with noise and show and shineand unerringly dimmed for the many the approaches to the RealHe stands today for armamentagainst all that the New Spirit has shown us out of the bleeding heart of the worldagainst the plain fact of the war as the quickener of spiritual lifeand against every dream that was ever born in the human breast out of the loss of the love of selfYou will say But why this study of TRnowSurely he has received his Thumbs down even from the crowdand with a unanimity seldom accorded a public man still in the fleshI am not so sureI wish I could be sure that his latest message would be shut from the receptivity of this landas a door upon an evil draughtWe have managed to clump along with bunglers through the recent dropsical years of peacebut there was never such a need as now for a man of vision and power at the forefront of our affairsThese States since August have committed atrocities of short sightedness and triumphs of selfishness enough to complicate us for future yearsThe partisan and the militarist have already made our neutrality uncleanI would like to be sure that their strongest influence has already been encounteredOn our southern borders is warand our northern border is black with distrust and the British point of viewFrom Vancouver to Halifaxthe voice of this hour is If Roosevelt were only in the chair at Washington The ensuing part of theifcovers the present issues from Mexico to Belgiumand the trouble is that Canada knows from England what she is wishing us at leastin partthe venom and abomination of the sayingTo judge from the Press of the States there are still many who would incite afresh the animal efficiency of our countryand who range themselves in the background with this master of the low vibrationcalling upon us to answer Europe with a similar desolationHow many times have you heard it said This TRis in the comprehension of the crowd This is trueThe saddest conviction ever forced into the mind of genius of any age is the opaqueness of the surface which the crowd presents to light or loveliness of any kindAnd TRis inAmerica and the World Warby Thedore Roosevelt Charles Scribner s SonsNew York The Little Review the comprehension of the bleakest generation which this country has ever known nor will there ever be another like itfor we are at the end of the nightThat which is about to break is either dawn or doomTRis still searching for the crowd through the endless folds of its obliquityWho shall say that these folds are not endless that he may not turn over still another fatefulif momentary allegiancefrom the bowels of our materialismEnough that he is the voice to day of the Prussian factor in Americaa voice from the throat of the militarists that curious solution of beefiron and winefrom which as Thou seest the Oise and the Aisne and the Vistula flow red ohLorddeliver us I hold the conviction that if the militarists ever get in full cry after this countrywe shall lose our Peace and our personalityThis is an hour to stand byand it is only in such an hour that I would venture to study a party through the character of its loudest voiceFor seventeen years I have watched TRstand for the physical and the obviousThere has been more noise about his name in America than about any otherand yet he has never risen to a single great momentAnd steadily he has mounted higher in the consciousness of TRMany of us thought that the crisis was reachedwhen for a daya little before the last presidential nominationsthe ego broke within himand those close at hand saw a deranged creatureA troop of us camped beside him in Tampaand followed the Rough Riders afield above SantiagoPerhaps he has a certain animal courage the cheapest utility of the nations but there is no moral quality to the courage of a man who would permit himself to be cast into popular approval on a fakeThere was a reunion two years afterward of those same Rough Riders in OklahomaTRwas therecampaigning on the shoulders of McKinleymuch as DrCook didOn the way down through Kansas for two dayswe heard him on the back platform of the private coachat every station where two or three would gather together pouring the most terrific physical energy into political bickerings and half truthsthe same at each station until we drew the press table as far as possible forwardand bore the oppressive heat with shut windows rather than that repeated clamor of words He would come in conqueringlythe black coat damp with sweat I remember the ruffian exhibition with the cattle steer torturingthe brandthe snap of bonethe tightened noosethud of poor beasts to the ground all in a frame for him the hat with the pinned back brimwaving over allNo other man has been so mighty to keep the pestiferousness of America alive in the minds of medieval EuropeAs our representative citizenhe has romped our yankeeisms and cutenesses from Queenstown to Port Said and aroundAnd so it has been for seventeen years since that Tampan campfrom party to groupfrom fame to notorietyfrom brute shooting and affidavitsto cocktails and new African rivers furnished with sworn state The Little Review mentsfrom woman s suffrage back to bayonetismalways in the sweat and heft of fleshunvaryingly the animal manThey say that if a child is bred and born righthis earlier years passed in hands that start him straight such a child will return to the beauty of his inceptionif time and the world are permitted to work sufficient misery upon him misery being the great correctiveThese States of America were bred of a fair dream and born of a singular beautyThe hope of the world today is that as a nationwe restore the old dreamthe old inspiration not a turning backfor that is against the lawbut turning to a finer dimension of that old passion which made us a refuge and a brotherhoodThere has been fine living virtue in two recent actions of this government two bits of high behaviorThrough one of theseit seemed that a shaft of light poured down from the fatherland of the future if day is ahead and not doomI refer to the return of the Boxer indemnity to ChinaIt was like a fine moment in a busy lifeand there was poetry in the answer from old Mother ChinaThere are men who love these States well enough to hate her many moments of unworthinessThe other figment of true national character is the determination of the part of Washington to keep her promise to Colombia I perceived that TRhas risen against thateven since his book setting forth the needs of a new predatory impetus for our national life To anyone who asks a law to go byfor the good of the country and the rectitude of selfI would say Take the side that this man does notand it will be impossible for you to lose The Little Review 5 Maurice Browne and The Little Theatre JOHN COWPER POWYS SICK of war and discussion of war sick offirst and last thingsand discussion of themdeafened by the raucous howling of the preachersand dumb before the fathomless stupidity of the mobone may totter into the cool quietness of The Little Theatre just as Heinescarcely a century agoescaped from the madness of the crowdand in that gallery on the Seine fell at the feet of the armless Goddess And she smiles at us too poor unknown strangers just as she smiled at that famous Wandererand thoughshe has no arms to help it is enough if for a little while one can rest at her feet and forgetthe voices of hate It was by the incantation she has never been known to resist that she was drawn here to restafter her long pilgrimagefor here she has found the altar they had lost the secret of buildingand the incense they had forgotten how to burn O the heavenly quietness of this placeand the absenceeven round about the purliens of itof the voices that grate and jar and harrow and murder Favete Linguis

guidingbalancingmellowingsweetening influencein this enterprisewhich has enabled the austereFormulaof the Founder to take to itself flesh and bloodFor the director of the Little Theatre of Chicago is no Dilettante no Petit Maître of a pompous coterie no bric à brac VirtuosoStern and high and cold is his Ideal clear and clean cut the lines that limit it To reproduce in the heart of the great mad City the City of theMiddle Westthe City of America that Rhythm and Harmony which Plato felt as the secret of the ultimate spheresis not such a thing worthy of the gift of a man s lifeAnd it is nothing less than a man s lifeand a woman s toowhich is being given for thisFor such temples are not built without the shedding of The Little Review 7 bloodThose who have ears to hear let them hear As the wise Lady sayswho comes from the Isle of the Saints The Bridge to the World s Future hides within its arches the bodies of the World s First BornIt is not for anystrayed reveller however sensitive to what he has seento give the word of Initiation to these devoted oneslong labored MysteryMaurice Browne s methods may be seenand the passionate irritability of his overtasked nerves may be teased and rung upon but the high invisible walls of the Citadel he is raising thetopless towersof his Ilium are not for the searching of the profaneAnd yet a modest guess may be hazarded as to wherein our horizonthose towers will growThey will growas all true classical ramparts have grownprotecting us from the hordes of vulgarityout of the ground and soil of inveterate traditionThey will not grow to the tune of the idealization that spurnsreality they will grow to the tune of the idealization that siftsselectswinnowspurifiesand heightensreality They will not be builtthey are not being builtaccording to the fierce fanaticism of any particular School or Cult or Pass wordThe sub soil of their tradition has been watered by no tears but those of Humanityand will be sown with no harvest but the harvest of HumanityIf they are more Greekor more Hebraicthan anything elsethat is only because to the Greeks and the Jews rather than to the rest it has been allowed to sweep the unessential absolutely aside and return with clear eyed innocence to the main factsMaurice Browne is not the slave of Euripides thoughby God some might think so nor is he the slave of the BibleIt is only that he knows too welltoo well for his peace and the peace of his friendsthat only from the depths of that one tragic fountain the naked human heartmy friendsspring the little opal tinted bubbles that reflect the World What has been revealed to our modern Faust in those queerabsences from the Body what has been revealed to him in those hourswhen his nerves find us so hard to bear whatthe Mothershave really whispered to him who were bold enough even to guessBut this much a poor Satyr of the Outer Court may without impertinence divineFor Maurice Browne the whole world resolves itself into an act of worshipThe thing worshiped we know nothing ofsave in the eternal rhythm of lifeand theother worshipperswe know nothing ofsave in the music which responds to that rhythmbut the whole drama down the long desperate centuries resolves itself into nothing less than an attempt to attune to reciprocity those two cadences the voice of the Unknown World Priestintoning through the agesand the voice of the innumerable generations answering Have I been able in the remotest degree to indicate why to the good sneering philistines who mock at all this and askwhat is a Little Theatre but a Little Theatrethere may come some day a somewhat ghastly awakeninga somewhat damning remorseIn that hour in thatJudgmenthappy will those citizens of Chicago be who have prepared the wayand not laid themselves down in the wayof the builders of the Abbey of Thelema What The Little Theatre is doing is nothing less than a restoration to the worship of the Eternal Gods of an Institution which has been bastardizedperverted and profanedThink what the Drama in our days has becomeThink whatbuyers and sellershave set up theirtablesin the Lord s House The Theatrein our generationis no more that sacred stage where Life is purged and winnowed and heightened and whereout of the Tragedy and Comedy of itclear triumphant music is made audiblePoetic Drama is extinctAnd yet can Life be said to be even approximately mimicked by anything less than poetryEmotions we have enough of and to spare emotions and sensations But these are not poetryThese are but the heavyrawcrudechemical protoplasm of poetryThus the only plays of our time which are beautiful and successful and true to the life instinct are FarcesFarces need not be poeticalThey represent the kicking up of satyr heels round the outer circle of the Dionysian groveThey represent the insurgent rebellion of the humorous mob against all law or ruleAnd as such they are admirableAs such they have their placeIndeed they are all that is left of admirable in our modern TheatreThey are our only contribution to this world old act of worship the contribution of beautifully kicking up our heelsPutting aside Wagner and Strauss and half a dozen Latin Opera Makerswhat has our stage got which really answers to the religious exigency of which I am speakingNothing but Farcenothing but Satyr heelsDevoted revivals of Gilbert and Sullivan restore to us our youth once in a long season and Fanny s First Play and Pygmalion hit our tired heathen fancy But for the rest Hyperborean morbidities technically adjusted to bourgeois drawing rooms with snow avalanches muttering at the windoware indeed enough to make unlaid troublesome ghosts of the great psychological names of Ibsen and StrindbergBut psychologywhether it dissect the old Bourgeois Family or the New Feminist Lureisafter allonly a transitory analysis of ephemeral situationsIt does not spring from whatin the relations between Man and Womanis eternal and unchangeableIt does not turn into dramatic poetry the long cry of our common fateThe pathologicalmacrabrismof Ibsen and Strindberg dissolves like mephitic scum when the eternal constellationsunder which Job and David and Sophocles wrotemount up through the deep hushed airMrBrowne has an artist s and an Irishman s passion for Synge but he knows better than we could tell him that gaelic Mythology is not classical Mythology and gaelic poetry is not Universal poetryAnd so we return to the one old Path the one undying TraditionWe literally return to itForafter all their lovely and alluring experiments in a hundred directionsthe great work of The Little Theatreuntil MrBrowne writes his own epoch making Poetic Play isas we all confessthe revival of EuripidesIt is here and only here that The Little Theatre of Chicago rouses itselfthrough every nerve and vein of its corporate bodyto grand and undistracted reciprocityAnd here we are in The Little Review 9 the presence of a true Renaissance a Renaissance as authentic and deep as that which the fifteenth century stumbled uponThe truth of what I am saying will be sealedfor the few who understand thisopen secret by the fact of the instinctive preference displayednot only by the director but by the whole companyfor The Trojan Womenover the less universalthe less classicalthe more modern MedeaNo one who has a real insight into what Poetic Drama means Poetic Drama the highest of all human Arts can hesitate for a moment as to where The Little Theatre rises to a permanent and tradition making heightIt rises to such a height in its performance of The Trojan WomenAnd it does so because here and here aloneby reason of the universal nature of the subject nothing less in fact than the incarnation of World s Sorrowevery member of the company is touched and attuned and compelled and transfigured to the same ultimate Pity It is not only ofIlionwe thinkit is not only forIlionwe weepin those world deep choruses we weep for all the sons and daughters of mendoomed by the same doomwhomust endurewith Argive Helentheir going henceeven as their coming hither The magical Irishplummetof Synge does notcannotsound much depth and before the bowed figures of those world mournerscarved as if by the chisel of Pheidiasour pathological Hyperborean Phantoms go squeakingbat liketo oblivionWhenin the futurePoetic Drama once more attains the position to which the self preservative instincts of humanity entitle itit will be recognized for what it is the true religious focussing of man s permanent protest against Fate lifted above the dust of all ephemeral questioningIt will then be seen that in Poetic Dramarather than in the noblest sacraments of Religionthe race must find its orchestral unitythe rhythm of its natural and Tragic breathingAnd when this is seenand the history of the thing writtenThe Chicago Little Theatreits directors and its companywill receivetoo lateas alwaysfor personal relieftheir delayed appreciation It

wise tobe cautious and discreetAny praise of a particular performer must needsfall a little discordantly when a certain impersonal rhythmic orchestrationis the note of the whole matterNo such faux pas

this side of the Atlantic And with the name of Raymond Johnsonthe artist of the companyit is necessary to link that of Edward Mosemanits greater actorIt is strange that it should have been left to a wandering European and yet perhaps not strangeto make audible the predictionwhich all discerning dramatic critics must inevitably be making in their heartsthat in not so very many years MrMoseman will be recognizedfrom shore to shoreas the most interesting and most personally arresting player that this country has produced since BoothThat a genius of his peculiarly idiosyncratic type should have been magnetized against his will into theformalismof the One Traditionis about as good an evidence as could be found of the power and conviction of Maurice Browne s impersonal Ideal The third name I may be allowed to mentionwithout impertinent intrusion into orchestral harmoniesis the name of Miss Vera WhiteI am not now referring to Miss White s untiring constructive labor upon what one might callthe architectural scaffoldingof The Little Theatre s productionsI am referring to her personal genius as an actressNothing more naturalnothing more inevitablenothing more winning and seductivethan this gentle actress s rendering of the wronged mother in MrsEllis s Cornish Play could be possibly imaginedAnd the same enchanting qualities of direct self effacing emotion will no doubt be even more irresistible whenin a classic roleshe comes to play the Nurse in MedeaOf Ellen Van Volkenburg s own acting in this classic Renaissance which she is helping her husband to summon fromthe vasty deep I cannot speak for I have only seen her in those charminggenreplays where she lovesmischievously enoughto transform herselflike a witch fairyinto every mortal kind of dream person But I know enough of her to know at least one aspect of her October shadowy moodswhich will make us tremble before her MedeaWell The Euphorion the child of this encounter of Past and Present has yet to grow his full

merely different aspects of the one great sex problemwhichaccording to MrsHavelock Ellismust be solved within the hearts and souls of men and women and not by the acts of any legislative bodyThose who braved the wind and the rain to hear this well known writer and thinker talk aboutSex and Eugenicswere rilled with sharp expectancy as she stepped forward to speaka short woman about fifty years oldwith iron gray hair cut close to her headpiercing blue eyeseloquent hands and a low voicewonderfully modulated and seemingly as tireless as her poisedvigorous body yet expectation seldom fulfills the bright dreams it dangles before our eyesWe let ourselves be carried away with enthusiasmand then are hurt because our visions lack fulfillmentSome expected too muchChicago has welcomed MrsEllis warmlyyet within this cordiality there have been hidden germs of fearunreasonable hopesslavish admirationmental indifference and misunderstanding it is always soShe is without question in the foremost ranks of women thinkersand behind hertrying more or less sincerely to gain an understanding of the great truths that she teaches and upholdsare hordes of women curiousbroad mindedbigoteddesperatefrightenedsane thinkersand sentimentalists women who are economic slaves and others who are financially independentWhat does MrsEllis mean to each one of themWhat messageif anyhas she broughtHas she added anything vital and new to our store of sex and eugenic knowledge which is already burdened with much mediocre and even valueless informationNothing but death could have kept me away from her lecture in Orchestra Hall February 4th to which after considerable unnecessary hesitation men were admittedAlthough I knew that I was approaching a burning bush I felt it was doomed to be hidden in a cloud of misapprehensiondisappointmentand disapprovaland I walked gingerly with my mind open and unprejudiced and alertI was fully as eager to catch the atmosphere of the audienceto fathom the thoughts of the thousand odd brains that listenedas I was to see and hear MrsEllis herselfThe lecture was an eventThe dignitythe lack of sensationalismthe quiet earnestness of what was said revealed a force at work in the world as steady and inevitable as the glacier s erosion of the Swiss hillsYet this quality of MrsEllis s mind is shown in all she writes and is shared by all The Little Review 13who read her pagesHer great gift to Chicago was her personalityItgleamed through every word she spoke and blazed into a pure white flame that seemed by its very intensity to create a new heaven and a new earthwhere love shall rise Phoenix like from the ashes of souls and bodies consumedby a misunderstood and misused passion There were well known and influential women who stayed away from the lecture because they were afraid afraid of the truthBecause in their blindness they could not see behind the cheap sensationalism of certain newspapers and understand the spiritual purity for which MrsEllis has always stoodYet their absence showed them not so much cowards as women incapable of reaching the great white lights of lifeThen there were women who came to the lecture expecting to be shocked and they went away disappointedThere were women who came laughing and gossipingand they went away still laughing and wondering what all the fuss was about anywayThey could not see anything extraordinaryit was all rather commonplace and not altogether newAnd a few came quietlyknowing that they were to contact a great earnest and wonderful personality who above all her broad wisdom stands for the highest ideals that humanity knows a little woman with a big mindThese went away thoughtfullyand were satisfiedfor they understoodThey felt as well as did MrsEllis herself what could and what could not be said on a public platform to a gathering of more than a thousand prejudiced and in some cases antagonistic listenersThey had in their mindsas of course she had alsoknowledge of the many scientific volumes that her husband has writtenThose familiar with Havelock Ellis were better prepared to listen than the othersThey were grounded in the facts and science of sex which has never been disclosed as he has done itand those who have read his pages know that in them he is the complete scientistweighingcomparingcreditingand discrediting the facts that have come to himIn no way are his sex studies propagandic they are a tremendous reservoir of static powerIt has been for his wife and co workershe of independent mind and high purposeto take all this vast collection of scientific information in her small handscrush out the sordidnessthe miserythe heart sickening perversions and distortions of human lives and holding up the bright idealsfling them out to her listeners in phrases burning with hope for both men and women and faith that true love will make everything wholeShe did not pose as a righter of personal grievances or a solver of private woesThe individual was lost in the group details were submerged in generalities isolated examples made way for guiding principlesWhen MrsEllis saidWe must improve our knowledge if we would improve our moralsand that there can be no guide to right living except that which comes from withinshe gave us the key to happinessThe Little Review If one might guessshe is a little impatient with laws and quite out of sympathy with those whoknowing but little themselvestry to bind others by rules and regulations which often defeat the very ends for which they were made What we want is more eugenics by educationand less eugenics by legislationshe cried and what she implied many times was that when we come to regard sex love as one of the greatest manifestations of the soulnot one of the offensive expressions of the body then and then only shall we have eugenic babies and happy men and women MrsEllis referred to the sex function as agreat spiritual enterpriseand said that only through the conflict of ideals can progress be madeWithcouragesanityand cleanlinessin our hearts we mustcease to regard sex as mere animalism and mustforge passion into powerThe sex function is divine fire it isas much an affair of the soul as of the bodyandit is no more disgraceful to function on the sex plane than on the hunger plane or on the thirst plane She sees that only in the economic independence of women can sex relations be righted love and money must be completely divorcedAny form of barterwhether lawfully within marriage or unlawfully outside of marriageis fatal to the free giving of loveSex love must exist only where there is affinity never where there is question of possessionOnly by being economically free can a woman raise herself above the rank of a prostitute MrsEllis spoke of our changing idealsthat what is normal for the ape is gross for the average man and womanand that what has been accepted as inevitable by ordinary men and women will be utterly intolerable to the super men and women of the near future The woman of the future will be the high priestess of sensenot the victim of sensuality as she now isShe will learn to love beautifully and live joyfully She referred to the way our bodies have sunk into disrepute ever since Greek times until to the Puritans everything was impure and emphasized the fact thatour bodies and our souls are not enemiesbut mates MrsEllis could not in a lecture of this sort have touched upon special sexual situationsShe was raising the standards of purityright livingand sanityshe was creating idealsshe was destroying sordidnessshe was upholding the sanctity of knowledge and holiness of a love that is free to give or withholdShe was showing women their weakness and pointing out where men have been tyrannicalshe was creating a divine dissatisfaction in every soul that heard herShe was the angel fearing to tread where legislative and police fools rush in and slash about with the sword of reform Create in us clean hearts and our bodies will take care of themselves seemed to be her prayerShe showed the goals of happiness and right livingrevealed that her own life had proved these things and found them goodThose who went away disappointed were those who expected her to lay down rules and sayThis shall you do and thatbut not the other thing The Little Review 15 But that is not MrsEllis s wayShe shows us what it is possible to dobut she distinctly leaves it to every individual to find his or her own wayunhampered by lawand free to make mistakes if unavoidableShe points out that some of the world s greatest geniuses have been neuroticsas Oscar WildeMichael AngeloChopinRosa BonheurNietszcheWe must make our own paths by looking withinnot trusting to man made laws and customsThose who found the lecture vague and unsatisfactory must increase their knowledgenot expect a woman to tell in thirty five minutes all she has learned in thirty five yearsWas it not enough for her to confess that we must engage in the sex relation with afine passionateness and spiritual deviltryWas it not enough for her to set up the ideal that the sex function is thegreat spiritual enterpriseWas it not enough for her to set before men and women the highest ideals that the human mind had yet conceivedAnd was it not enough to look at and to listen to a woman who knows whereof she speaks and who has lived all that she teaches She has found her way through the same clouds of prejudice and prudery that surround usand to us of Chicago she has given the great privilege of sharing with her what she called the proudest moment of her life and of listening to whatfor the first time in her lifeshe could freely sayThose looking for cheap sensations will not find them in MrsEllisThose trying to limit human action by passing laws will receive no help from her wordsThose hampered by conventions and shackled by fear of the truth must be born again into the beauty and holiness of every side of human life before they can even see the heights whereon MrsEllis standsLet those who would find happiness for themselves and a happy issue out of the sufferings of the men and women and children and unborn babeslook into their own hearts and bravely face what is thereWomen have always run away from anything sexual as unwomanlyShe must face her own nature she must learn that to most womenthe sex impulse is the hunger of her soulshe must study men and find a way to raise them from the errors into which they have fallenShe must cease to be a prudeand learn to be bravepatientwise she must studyread and thinkNothing is unwomanly save dishonestyand until women are honest enough and fearless enough to face what is within themselvesneither MrsEllis nor anyone else can help themMrsEllis is a leadernot a driverand because she has found life good she is an inspiration which no woman can afford to disregard16 The Little Review MrsEllis s Failure MARGARET CANDERSON There was one great fault to be found with MrsEllis s lecture it was not illuminatingIt might have failed in any number of other ways and still have been a real contribution but it should not have dared to fall short in that respectbecause MrsEllis came forward in the role of one who has a message and because she chose a subject upon which one must have a message or not talk at allWhat MrsEllis did is the kind of thing against which our generation has its deepest grudgeand it constitutes a very special case of what we mean when we talk so heatedly about TruthWe mean nothing startling by thatsimply that quality which some one has had the good sense to callreleasing A few days before the lecture MrsEllis said that she might as well call her talk anything except merelySex and Eugenics because she meant to discuss lovespirituallysex abnormalitiesand many other matters I have read all my husband s manuscripts before they were published and I know he has never told anything but the truth about sex she said I have waited some thirty years to talk about these thingsand I shall tell the truth as I know itif I am sent to jail or put out of Chicago for it On another occasion she said that she meant to talk of those people whothrough perverted or inverted sexual tendenciesfaced the problem of having to turn their abnormality perhaps their gift of geniusif we understood these things better into creative channelsBecause of all this it was only natural to expect a message from MrsEllisBut what actually happened was this DrWAEvans opened the meeting by reading a short paper on Havelock Ellis a paper full of pompous phrases and of real interest in its utter lack of thoughtHe gave some biographical data which everyone knewtold the dates of MrEllis s various publicationsrepeated the chapter titles of one of his less important worksand really said nothing at allThen MrsEllis read a paper which her husband had written especially for the occasion the most uninteresting thing that wonderful man has ever writtenI am sureIt had a lot of abstractions about masculinism and feminismand really said nothing at all I use the wordnothingon a basis of Ideas Then MrsEllis read her own paperwhich was beautifully written and charmingly deliveredand which said nothing at allShe said in brief that there should be no war between body and souland that Oscar Wilde should have been understood rather than sent to jailThese things are not ideas they are common senseThey are all quite simply recognized by thinking peopleand most of MrsEllis s audience was composed of thinking people who wanted her individual philosophy on these mattersThey were not asking her for art but The Little Review 17 for thought not for expression but for meaningHer failure was of the sort of which prophets are never guiltyOf courseMrsEllis may not wish to be considered a prophet or a philosopherThen there should not have been so much talk of offering a completely new view of sexShe may regard herself as a poetan interpreterVery well then she should have given a substantial vision of a future state when love in all its aspects is valued and understoodMrsEllis cannot be blamed for the sensational stories in the paperHer suggestion that men be admitted to the lecture because they need education in this field as much as women need itwas made simply and without any thought of sensationEverybody knows what the press will make of such material as thatAnd everybody knows how an organization managed exclusively by women is likely to be twisted into sillysentimentalor malicious issuesBut MrsEllis can be blamed for that attitude which promises more than it has to giveand very seriously blamed for that spirit which hints that there may be cause for shame where there is no causeThere has been something altogether too suggestive ofDid my lecture shock you in MrsEllis s attitudeThese things are not shockingthey are beautiful or terribleaccording as they are understood or misrepresentedbut so long as the truth about them is faced squarely they should carry no hint of shockThe only test of anemerged personalityis its arrival at a point where it is not shocked by anything human beings may do or beYou may be deeply moved or terribly hurtbut you are not merely offended or embarrassed or startledAll that brings things down to such a little scaleI don t know just whybut MrsEllis s attitude has reminded me of the man who advised me not to read Havelock Ellis s volumes on the psychology of sexbecause after such an experience I could never respect human beings againIf he had been ignorant or puritanical his remark wouldn t have matteredbut he was a rather well known sexologist and he believed those books to be very valuable What he meant was that it isso disillusioningto know the truthIf MrsEllis were that sort of person these things I object to wouldn t matter in the leastAs it isthey matter hugelyHer failure to assume that knowledge is too important a thing to concern itself with people s pruderies is on a par with the man s failure to recognize that truth is never disastrousNearly all the people in Orchestra Hall that night had read Ellis and Carpenter and Weininger and other scientistsand they expected to hear how far MrsEllis s personal views coincided or disagreed with these authoritiesBut she had no intention of such elucidationit seemsShe didn t say what she thought about free lovefree divorcesocial motherhoodbirth controlthe sexmoralityof the futureor any of these thingsOn the other side of the questionin her reference to intermediate typesshe didn t mention homosexuality she had nothing to say about the differences between perversion and inversionnor did she even hint at Carpenter s social efforts in behalf of the homosexualistWhat does MrsEllis think about Weininger s statement that intermediate sexual forms arenormalnot pathological phenomenain all classes of organismsand their appearance is no proof of physical decadenceDoes she agree with himin his reference to the idea that inversion is an acquired character and one that has superseded normal sexual impulseswhen he says It might equally be sought to prove that the sexual inclination of a normal man for a normal woman was an unnaturalacquired habitIn the abstract there is no difference between the normal and the inverted typeIn my view all organisms have both homosexuality and heterosexuality In spite of all present day clamor about the existence of different rights for different individualitiesthere is only one law that governs mankind just as there is only one logic and not several logicsIt is in opposition to that law as well as to the theory of punishment according to which the legal offensenot the moral offenseis punishedthat we forbid the homosexualist to carry on his practices whilst we allow the heterosexualist full playso long as both avoid open scandalSpeaking from the standpoint of a purer state of humanity and of a criminal law untainted by the pedagogic idea of punishment as a deterrentthe only logical and rational method of treatment for sexual inverts would be to allow them to seek and obtain what they require where they canthat is to sayamong other inverts It is not enough to repeat that Shakespeare and Michael Angelo and Alexander The Great and Rosa Bonheur and Sappho were intermediates how is this science of the future to meet these issuesThey move into the realm of the world s sublime tragedies when one reads the manifesto of a community of such people in GermanyThe rays of sunshine in the night of our existence are so rare that we are responsive and deeply grateful for the least movementfor every single voice that speaks in our favor in the forum of mankind MrsEllis may have thought her audience entirely too unsophisticatedtoo untutored in these mattersto admit of specific treatmentBut that is all the greater reason to talk plainlyWhen you reflect how difficult it is for the mass to become educated about sex it becomes rather appalingIt is worth your life to get Havelock Ellis s six volumes from a bookstore or a libraryYou can only do it with a doctor s certificate or something of that sortEven if you ask for Weininger you are taken behind locked doorsforced to swear that you want it out of nomorbid curiosity that you will keep it only a weekand above all that you won t let anyone else read itOf courseit is practically impossible to do work of this Sort under the auspices of women s medical leagues or similar organizationsBut MrsEllis had dared the impossibleI can t help comparing her with another woman whose lecture on such a subject would be bigbravebeautifulI am criticised for having too much about this other woman in THE LITTLE REVIEWSOnot to mention any names as the story goes I will merely say that Emma Goldman could never fail in this wayThe Little Review It is not a question of what could or could not be said on a public platform it is a question of what should be saidIf the findings of science are not to be made accessiblewe must all find ourselves in the position of Rousseau when he said that the renascence of the arts and sciences had not ennobled moralsIsn t that almost as true now as thenA week agoas I writea young man named Roswell Smith was hanged in Chicago for having strangled a four year old girlHe had no recollection of the murderand his father s testimony brought out the fact that the boy had always been epilepticSince he must die for hiscrimeohthe heart breaking tragedy of his quiet acceptance of that hellish law Smith begged that he be allowed to die under the knifeso that at least humanity might benefit by an examination of his brainButno he must be hangedJustice must be donethe public wrath appeasedthe penalty held up to other criminalsprevention enforced again by methods which don t prevent The governorunwilling to risk public indignationsalved his conscience by the testimony of one alienist who pronounced Smithsane And so the boy paid the penaltyto the accompaniment of Psalms and readings from the Word theLight of the world And sixty people watched the murder and not a voice was raised in protestThink of itor rather don t think of it unless you are willing to lose your mind with horror and shameHow far have we advanced when things like this can still happen among us With us love is just as punishable as murder or robberyMrsEllis knows the workings of our courtsshe knows of boys and girlsmen and womentortured or crucified every day for their love because it is not expressed according to conventional moralityAll this was part of her responsibility on February 4thand this is why I say she failedThe Little Review The Acrobat ELOISE BRITON Poised like a panther on a bough swings and leapstaut body flashes clearin a long blue arc cuts the hushed air

Little ReviewI watch him And a quick desire comes over me Of those slim hipsThose long clean slender limbs That stand for healthand for the sheer Keen beauty of the bodyI desire himAnd I desire the spirit of the manThe bodily fearlessnessThe reckless courage in a swaddled ageI desire himHow lithe and firm would be the child Of such a man A Young American Poet RICHARD ALDINGTON IT is the defect of Englishand in a lesser degree of Americancriticism that such criticisms as are not merely commercial are doctrinaireThe criticthat is to saycomes to judge a work of art not with an open mind but with a whole horde of prejudicesignorancesand eruditions which he termscritical standardsA work of art you can hear him say must be thismust be thatmust be the other when indeed a work of art may well be no such thingJust now the cry is all formodernity for lyrical outbursts in praise of machineryof locomotionand of violenceAnd thecriticsobediently fill their minds with these prejudices until at length you discover them solemnly declaring that a work of art has no value except it treat of machineryof locomotion or of kindred subjectsI have yet to find the critic who approaches his job in the right spirit who asks himself firstWhat has the artist attempted to do and thenHas he succeededThe commercial critic is of course the more reprehensiblethe doctrinaire critic is nevertheless a serious menace to that liberty of the arts of which one cannot be too jealousIn England especially the doctrinaire critic reignsYesterday it was all Nietzsche then Bergson now there is a wild fight between a dozenisms combats between traditional imbeciles and revolutionary imbecilesSo that one spends half one s time becoming anistand the rest of the time in getting rid of the titleThe neglect of the poems of the young American poet HDwho is the subject of this articleis dueI think to the following factsThe authorwho apparently possesses a great degree of self criticismproduces a very small bulk of work and most of it is lost in magazines such work as attained publicity was judgedbefore being readfrom its surroundingsthe work being originalseemed obscure and wantonly destructive of classic English modelsyou must remember that there are veryvery few people in England who have the faintest idea of what is meant by vers librethe use of initials rather frightened peopleand the author had no friends among the professional criticsNow America has this advantage over most European countries that its inhabitants are mostly willing to accept a fresh view of thingsThe lack of atraditionhas advantages as well as disadvantagesAn American authorthenis less likely to see things in a conventional wayand is less likely to be deterred from any novel and personal method of expression For in 1911when HDbegan to write the poems I am consideringvers libre was practically unheard of outside France If I were asked to define the chief quality of HDs work I should say The Little ReviewI can only explain it by a paradox it is a kind of accurate mystery And I should go on to quote the ballad of Sir Patric Spens in which from a cloudyvagueobscure atmospherewhere nothing is precisewhere there is nostory no obvious relation between the ideascertain objects stand out very sharply and clearly with a very keen effectobjects likethe bluid red winethe braid letter the young moon in the old moon s armsand the ladies withtheir fans intil their hands And then I should go on to say that thisaccurate mysterycame from the author s brooding overnot locomotives and machinery but little corners of gardensa bit of a stream in some Pennsylvanian meadowfrom memories of afternoons along the New Jersey coastor of a bowl of flowersCuriousmysteriousrather obscure sort of broodings with startling and very accurate renderings of detailAnd then I should explain the author s use of Hellenic terms and of the rough unaccented metres of Attic choruses and Melic lyrics like those fragments of Alcaeus and Ibycus and Erinna by pointing out that it is in those poems the choruses in the Bacchaefor example that this particular kind of brooding over nature found its best expressionLet me quote a portion of a poem to illustrate these qualities the quality which I have calledaccurate mystery the quality of brooding over nature and the quality of spontaneous kinship with certain aspects of Hellenic poetryI take it thatif one liked to be specifically modern the poem could be calledWind on the New Jersey Coast But the author s innate sense of mysteryof aloofnessjust like that of the anonymous author of Sir Patric Spensmakes her place the action in some vaguedistant place and timeThough it be contrary to current opinion I hold that the poem gains by thisHERMES OF THE WAYS The hard sand breaksthe grains of it are clear as wine Far off over the leagues of itwindon the wide shorelittle ridgesthe great waves break over it But more than the many foamed ways the seaknow him the triple path wayso awaiteth The Little Review DubiousFacing three waysWelcoming wayfarersHe whom the sea orchard shelters from the westFrom the east Weathers sea windFronts the great dunesWind rushes Over the dunesAnd the coarsesalt crusted grass AnswersHeuIt whips round my ankles etc etcI am not willing to have that poem read quickly and cursorarilyas one reads a column of newspaper printIt must be read with some of the closeintense attention with which it was writtenEach word and phrase were most carefully considered and arrangedThe reader must remember that the object of such writing is not to convey information but to create in the reader a moodan emotiona sense of atmosphereMrYeats is right when he complains that newspapers have spoiled our sense of poetrywe expect poetry to tell us some piece of newsand indeed poetry has no news to tell anyoneIts object is simply to arouse an emotionand no emotion is ever aroused in a person who skims through a piece of poetry as he skims through a journalWhen I read that poem I have evoked in me a picture like a picture of Courbet or Boudin of a white sea roaring on to yellow sands under a bright skywith the wind sweeping and whistling in the dunesAnd I have a feeling that it is a magic sort of pictureof somewhere a great way offwhere it would not surprise me to find the image of a god at the cross roadswith the offerings of simple people about the pedestalAnd at the same time I always remember bathing from some sand dunes near Ryein Sussexon a very windy afternoonwhen the sand blinded me and the sharp grass cut my ankles as I ran down to the waterI cannotof coursetell what sort of an effect such writing has on other peopleIt may be that I am especially sensitive to itBut let me quote another of the author s poemsconveying a totally different moodSITALKAS Thou art come at length More beautiful than any cool god In a chamber under Lycia s far coastThan any high god who touches us not Here in the seeded grassAyethan ArgestesScattering the broken leavesThe Little Review 25 If you ask me to say precisely what thatmeansI could only explain it in this wayWhen I read that poem I experience the emotions I should expect to receive if I were lying in a sunny meadow on some hot late September afternoon somewhere far inlandwhere there would be a great silence broken very gently by the rustle of the heavy headed grass and by the stir of falling beech leaves somewhere so far inlandsomewhere so hotthat it would come as a shock of delighted surprise to think of acool god in a chamber under Lycia s far coast It does not annoy me that I have never been to Lyciathat I have no more idea who Sitalkas and Argestes were than who Sir Patric Spens wasit is all oneI get my impression just the samewhichI take itis what the author aimed atAnd indeed the odd unknown names give it a very agreeable sense of mystery and of aloofnessSuch are some of the qualities of the work of the young American who hides her identity under the initials HDI believe her work is quite unknown in Americathoughbefore the warI remember seeing some comment on it in a French literary paperIt was in another French review that a critic complained that this author was not interested in aeroplanes and factory chimneysSomehow I feel quite coldly about factory chimneys when I read sudden intense outbursts of poetry like those I have quoted and like this The light of her face falls from its flower As a hyacinthHidden in a far valleyPerishes upon burnt grassThe Little Review Editorials and AnnouncementsOn Criticism THERE is something particularly delightful to me in reviewing John Cowper Powys s bookVisions and Revisionsin THE LITTLE REVIEWFor MrPowysthough quite unconscious of itwas one of the main inspirations behind the coming to be of this magazineTwo years ago we heard him lecture on Pater and Arnold and came from that rite determinedif possibleto reflect something of his attitudehis critical appreciationin a magazineI remember the thrill of it very vividly That is criticism we saidAnd so I am going to let MrPowys speak for us by quoting almost the entire preface from his new volume with its critical essays on RabelaisDanteShakespeareEl GrecoMiltonLambArnoldShelleyKeatsNietzscheHardyDostoevskyPoeand othersI am sure thatas THE LITTLE REVIEW S godfatherhe will not mind being quoted so at lengthMost books of critical essays take upon themselves with unpardonable effronteryto weigh and judge from their own petty suburban pedestalthe great Shadows they reviewIt is an insolence How should Professor Thisor Doctor Thatwhose furthest adventures ofdangerous livinghave been squalid philanderings with their neighborswivesbring an Ethical Synthesis to bear that shall put Shakespeare and HardyMilton and Rabelaisinto appropriate nichesEvery critic has a right to his own Aesthetic Principlesto his own Ethical Convictions but when it comes to applying these in tiresomepedantic agitationto Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Lambwe must beg leave to cry offWhat we want is not the formulating of new Critical Standardsand the dragging in of the great masters before our last miserable Theory of ArtWhat we want is an honestdownright and quite personal articulationas to how these great things in literature really hit us when they find us for the moment natural and off our guard when they find us as men and womenand not as ethical gramaphonesThere is an absurd notion going aboutamong those half educated people who frequent Ethical Platformsthat Literary Criticism must beconstructive O that wordconstructiveHowin the name of the mystery of geniuscan criticism be anything else than an The Little Review idolatrya worshipa metamorphosisa love affairThe pathetic mistake these people make is to fancy that the great artists only lived and wrote in order to buttress up such poor wretches as they are upon the particular littlethincardboard platform which is at present their moral security and refuge No one has a right to be a critic whose mind cannotwith Protean receptivitytake first one form and then anotheras the great Spellsone by oneare thrown and withdrawn Who wants to know what

spectacleas he comes under the influence first of one great artist and then anotherwhile as a sillylittlepreaching school masterhe is only a blot upon the world mirror It is because so many of us are so limited in our capacity forvariable reactionthat there are so few good criticsBut we are allI thinkmore multiple souled than we care to admitIt is our foolish pride of consistencyour absurd desire to beconstructivethat makes us so dullA critic need not necessarily approach the world from thepluralisticanglebut there must be something of suchpluralismin his natural temperor the writers he can

very different mastersand to let your constructive consistency take care of itselfyou may becomeperhapsan admirable moralist you will never be a Clairvoyant criticAll this having been admittedit still remains that one has a right to draw out from the great writers one loves certain universal aesthetic testswith which to discriminate between modern productions But even such tests are personal and relativeThey are not to be fostered on one s readers as anythingex catheda One such test is the test of what has been calledthe grand stylethat grand The Little Review style against whichas Arnold saysthe peculiar vulgarity of our race beats in vain I do not suppose I shall be accused of perverting my devotion to thegrand styleinto an academicnarrow way through which I would force every writer I approachSome most winning and irresistible artists never come near it And yet what a thing it isAnd with what relief do we return to itafter thewallowingsandrhapsodies the agitations and prostitutionsof those who have it not And what are the elementsthe qualitiesthat go to make up thisgrand style Let me first approach the matter negativelyThere are certain things that cannot because of something essentially ephemeral in them be dealt with in the grand style Such arefor instanceour modern controversies about the problem of SexWe may be Feminists or Anti Feminists what you will and we may be able to throw interesting light on these complicated relationsbut we cannot write of themeither in prose or poetryin the grand stylebecause the whole discussion is ephemeralbecausewith all its gravityit is irrelevant to the things that ultimately matterSuchto take another exampleare our elaborate arguments about the interpretationethical or otherwiseof Christian DoctrineWe can be very entertainingvery moralvery eloquentvery subtlein this particular sphere but we cannot deal with it in thegreat style because the permanent issues that really count lie out of reach of such discussion and remain unaffected by it Let me make myself quite clearHector and Andromache can talk to one another of their loveof their eternal partingof their childand they can do this in the great style but if they fell into dispute over the particular sex conventions that existed in their agethey might be atractive stillbut they would not be uttering words in thegreat style The test is always that of Permanenceand of immemorial human associationIt isat bottomnothing but human association that makes the great style what it isThings that havefor centuries upon centuriesbeen associated with human pleasureshuman sorrowsand the great recurrent dramatic moments of our livescan be expressed in this style and only such thingsThe great style is a sort of organicself evolving work of artto which the innumerable units of the great human family have all put their handsThat is why so large a portion of what is written in the great style is The Little Review anonymous like Homer and much of the Bible and certain old ballads and songsIt is for this reason that Walter Pater is right when he says that the important thing in Religion is the Ceremonythe Litanythe Ritualthe Liturgical Chantsand not the Creeds or the Commandmentsor discussion upon Creed or CommandmentWhyof all the religious books in the worldhavethe Psalms of David whether in Hebrew or Latin or Englishtouched men s souls and melted and consoled them They are not philosophicalThey are not logicalThey are not argumentativeThey are not moralAnd yet they break our hearts with their beauty and appealIt is the same with certain well known wordsIs it understoodfor instancewhy the wordSwordis always poetical and inthe grand style while the wordZeppelinorSubmarineorGatling gunorHowitzercan only be introduced by Free Versifierswho let thegrand stylego to the DevilThe wordSword like the wordPlough has gathered about it the human associations of innumerable centuriesand it is impossible to utter it without feeling something of their pressure and their strainThe very existence of thegrand styleis a protest against any false views ofprogressandevolution Man may alleviate his lot in a thousand directions he may build up one Utopia after another but the grand style will remain will remain as the ultimate expression of those aspects of his life that cannot change while he remains Man There are a certain number of solitary spirits moving among us who have a way of troubling us by their aloofness from our controversiesour disputesour argumentsourgreat problems We call them EpicuresPagansHeathenEgoistsHedonistsand VirtuososAnd yet not one of these words exactly fits themWhat they are really doing is living in the atmosphere and the temper ofthe grand styleand that is why they are so irritating and so provocative To them the most important thing in the world is to realize to the fullest limit of their consciousness what it means to be born a ManThe actual drama of our mortal existencereduced to the simplest termsis not enough to occupy their consciousness and their passionIn this sphere in the sphere of theinevitable thingsof human life everything becomes to them a sacramentNot a Symbol be it noted but a Sacrament The food they eat the wine they drink their waking and sleeping the hesitancies and reluctancies of their devotions the swift anger of their recoils and retreats their long loyalties their savage reversions their sudden The Little Reviewlashings outtheir hate and their love and their affection the simplicities of these everlasting moods are in all of us becomeevery one

spirit of thegrand style It has nothing to do withrightorwrong Saints may practise itand sometimes doSinners often practise itThe whole thing consists in growing vividly conscious of those moods and

desirelusthatejealousydevotionadmirationpassionthey are victims of the eternal forcesthat can speakif they willinthe great style When a man or womanarguesorexplainsormoralizesorpreaches they are the victims of accidental dust stormswhich rise from futility and return to vanityThat is why Rhetoricas Rhetoriccan never be in the great styleThat is why certain great revolutionary Anarchiststhose who have the genius to express in words their heroic defiance ofthe something rotten in Denmark move us moreand assume a grander outlinethan the equally admirableand possibly more practicalarguments of the Scientific SocialistsIt is the eternal appeal we wantto what is basic and primitive and undying in our tempestuous human nature The grand style announces and commandsIt weeps and it pleadsIt

Plight it isyet clear to seetake solace of your sinningye sink unfathomablygrows ever easier winningye who saved would beand shake a leg with meA New Standard of Art Criticism and a Significant Artist HUNTLEY CARTER IT has been clear to me for some time that a new standard of art criticism is needed to assist the present day revaluation of ArtA constant examination of advanced pictures has shown me that the key to revaluation resides in the ultimate effect attained by the newmasters In studying this effect I have become aware of certain facts 1The effect is one of solid motion at a greater intensity than is found in actualityIt is solid motion actually exaggerated By solid motionI mean motion expressed by actual forms2The greater the intensity the more it tends to obliterate actuality 3There is a fluid motion behind phenomenaThis motion informs phenomena but loses its intensity when it becomes phenomenalizedIt changes its character from fluid motion to solid motionas though undergoing a process of conversion similar to that by which water is frozen into ice 4The meaning of the attainment of the said effect would therefore seem to be that solid motionas expressed by artistsis being melted into fluid motionas ice is melted into waterand water isin turnconverted into steamMoreoverthe solid motion is being melted by the higher intensity of the fluid motionIn other words fluid motion is converting solid motion into its own flowor that from whence solid motion cameThe conclusion is that the quest for intensity is a sign that artists are awakening to a feeling for fluid motion behind solids Perhaps artists are becoming purer mediumsIt is conceivable that the revolt against academic formulae and the consequent movement towards neo primitivismhave had a refining influenceIn ridding artists of certain forms of culture and conventionthey have removed inner obstacles to the intense stream line flow or fluid motionand have made them accessible to the motion itselfHence the present day pursuit of abstraction in painting and the tendency of representative formsiesolidsto disappear from the canvas and to be replaced by non representative formsiefluids As an example I may point to the shadowy forms pursued by KandinskyIt is true that many of Kandinsky s studies do not contain evidence of fluid motion working freely through the artist and tracing its own designs on his canvasIn his earlier studies he certainly expresses solidsHe puts down forms which the conventional memory recognizes as having a relation to the knownand thereby defeats his own objectBut his recent studies exhibit a refining away of solids and a larger feeling for fluiditythat leads one to believe the artist is striving for a true dream like state in which the fluid motion is left to express itself at its own degree of The Little Review 37 intensityWhether he will ever attain this state is uncertain as yetespecially in view of the intellectual attitude of his writingsIn Spiritual Harmonyfor instancehe is seen working out a scheme of color thus showing he hopes to produce an effect upon the spectator by the use of a mathematical formulaHe has evidently conceived the theory that certain colors are equivalent to certain emotions and by adding or subtracting color he can add or subtract an emotion to or from the spectatorThus yellow equals joybut add red to the yellow and the effect will be joy tinged with passionIn this way the fluid motion actuating Kandinsky is bound to be subjected to theoretical treatment instead of being left free to do its own workThe emotion of joy in passing through the painter on its way to the spectator will be subjected to mental checkswith the result that it will be deprived of its greatest value in its original intensityThe study of the aforementioned facts led me in turn to new views on Art aas to the origin and nature of Art bas to the orderintelligibilityand coherence that exist in the natural manifestations of Art c as to the law of growth and progression to be applied to art forms das to the illumination of this law by a proper standard of criticismAccordingly I came to see that Art is a potential creative movement in spaceIt first exists in the fluid motions of the universe and ultimately in a work of art only as the inevitable and efficient expression of itself through a specially adapted medium called the artistIn a metaphysical senseArt may be said to be a spiritual experience capable of assuming visibilityBut it becomes visible only by a process of debasementApparentlyas I have saidthe fluid motion in which Art expresses itself loses its intensity and becomes solid motion in the process of conversion into a work of artas applied by all civilized artistsas far as we knowup to the present dayIn factit is only recent years that have witnessed the discovery by the artist of the fluid motion potential in solid motionCezanneGauguinand Van Gogh were among the first of the moderns to arrive at the point of realizing this potential characterAll three were actively engaged in the refining of solids and suggesting their potential ultimate fluidityWhat they actually did was thisThey demonstrated that Art is a fluid motion seeking to produce an ultimate creative effect upon the spectator through efficient applicationand that fluid motion can only produce its creative effect as fluid motionNowlargely owing to blindness or wrong directionartistswith rare exceptionshave hitherto concerned themselves with converting fluid motion into various forms of solid motionThey have in fact stopped at the expression of representative forms of nature and human lifeapparently unconscious that in doing so they were not completing the expression of the art flowbut were stopping at a half way houseso to speakwhere of course the maximum creative effect could not be producedBefore this effect can be produced it is necessary to complete the journey by reconverting the solids 38 The Little Review into fluid motionIt cannot be said that either CezanneVan Goghor Gauguin completed the magic journeyBut if they did not refine away the solids in their canvases and set them going as fluid motionif they put down forms recognizable as housesmentreesand so onthey certainly exhibited such forms undergoing a process of meltingIn Van Gogh s canvases the forms are simply being melted by the fierce internal intensity to which the artist is subjecting themVan Goghperhaps more than any of his contemporariesshows us known forms in the act of being converted into their original fluid motionAnd it is for this reasonI thinkVan Gogh s pictures produce a greater creative effect upon the spectator than any merely representative forms of artWe experience in them a rush of liberated energy due to the change from solidity to fluiditySo much for the new conception of the origin and nature of ArtWith regard to the principles by which Art moves towards its ultimate effectI believe they are analagous to those by which an unseen agency assumes visibility in natural formsThere is the same orderintelligibilityand coherence throughoutCorresponding to the invariable order of growth and progression in a plant as represented by the seedenclosing the life and unifying principlestembranchesleaves and fruitis the order of ascentor perhaps it should be descentby which Art takes concrete formFirst there is the initial flowthen the root point answering to the seed or unifying principlethen follow in turnlinesplanesand solidsThe fruit and the solids appear to be the culmination of the initial flowbut really they contain a potential power of growth in a realizable fluid motionThis abstract motion has ever since the start been descending and slackening into solid motionand its forms have become more and more concrete as they attained actualityBehind these actual formsit is clearthere is the potentiality of further movement and growth which in our limited state of intelligence we conceive of as realisable only on the original linesIf there is an infinite growth and development inherent in actual forms very few persons are aware of itIndeed most persons are aware only of particular growthTo them growth begins with the seed and stops with the fruit or its art expression as fruitand the only form of continuation is to be found in repetitionThe old process must be repeated from seed to fruitAccording to this view the phenomena of growth as expressed by art forms is manifested in a succession of parallel movements and not in one continuous and ever expanding movementGenerally speakingthings are transferred to canvas as they appearparticular solidsnot infinite fluids as they areIf they have a life principle in them it is carefully concealedfor they suggest no power of infinite growthIt would seem indeed as though art expressionduring civilized timeshas reached a deadlockFor it is noticeable that throughout all the great periods of art expressionartists have expressed the same thingsIn the canvases of the old masters a flow of solids manifests itself with The Little Review depressing regularityTimeone might thinkwould have lifted the soul of the artist out of solid spaceButas we knowthe feverish desire to express a too solid world has not grown less till of recent yearsIt may be due to this deadlock that art criticism has seldom risen above mediocrityHow indeed could it reach the highest creative achievement of the critical mind if works of art lack the creative principle to be judgedThe creative critic cannot possibly build his house of illumination without the essential fundamental materialsAnd these the artist must provideHe cannot illuminate the non existantAnd if there are no creative elements to work upon criticism is bound to fall and remain far below the creative standardIt will be uncertain and chaotic in its judgmentsHistory says it is soand not without proofIt shows us that the art judgment of one age has been sufficient to reverse the art judgment of a previous ageYet Art itself does not changeIf it is badly expressed at any time it is badly expressed for all timeTherefore the said fluctuating judgment has but one interpretationIt means that the judgment itself is at faultand much of the art criticism to which art critics have given utterance is worthlessThe reason is apparentArt criticism is not based upon a fundamental principleThere is no established law of art criticismOf course I shall be told there is no such law to establishbecause it does not exist and never will existThe art critic has been and will continue to be guided by his conscious experienceAnd as such experience varies from age to ageso judgment founded upon it varies alsoBut a statement so independent of common sense is plainly nonsenseThe law to which I refer is within the critic just as it is within the artistIt does not always operate because it is not allowed to do soIt is hindered by conscious experienceActually the law is the artistand if left to itself it would make an efficient application of itself to produce the highest creative effect of which fluid motion is capableSuch is the unconscious method of using the lawThe artist uses it not because he can or will but because he mustHis picture producing is a work that can only be done in one waynot by thought and reasonnot by compulsions and restraintsbut through the livingness of free energies left free to find their own expressions through their own channelsHis starting pointrepresenting the seed of unityis sensibilityand feeling if left alone will do everything to unite all parts of his visionto bind and cement them togetherThe result would remain as an example of organic growth not limited to solid space but extended to a higher space as far as the emotional impulse in the artist can be expressed by the limited means at his disposalThe question of how far the artist can use solidthat isdeadmaterialspaint brushesand canvasto reach a transcendental effecteffect of livingnessis one that I must leave for future considerationIn such a result would be found evidence not only that there is a great principle or law by which art operates and reaches its highest mark humanly 40 The Little Review possiblebut that it remains constant and true in the sensible artist and can be traced running through all he doesIf further evidence of the existence of the law is needed I can point to the conscious use of it today by painters who are seeking to give the facts of ordinary experience a non representative characteras though belonging to a world of abstractionWe know that Picasso is busy converting everyday forms of his own contemporary surroundings into rhythmic shape from which all ditches have been care fully eliminatedWe know too that other painters following the epoch making example of John DFergusson are boldly rhythmising the people and affairs of everyday life as though convinced that the big unified rhythmic design is symbolic of the intense movement by which Art moves and expresses itselfWe see in their canvases an obvious attempt to give the widest expansion to the fundamental rhythm of each subject treatedAt first sight it appears to be a step in the right directionone leading away from the fallacy or blindnesswhich led the old masters to turn out wonderful patchworks by giving each object in their canvases a structural unity of its ownIndeed it looks as though these painters have mastered the secret of binding a composition together by a unified design springing from a central note that expands by spontaneous motion till it not only fills the canvas but passes out of it on a very wide sweepand having orderintelligibilityand coherence in all its partsIt looks as though they have discovered the great law of creative organic unity of which I speakCloser examination of their workhoweverreveals it is not soFor one thing their pictures are not growths from small beginnings to great endseach the successive sweep of one curve expanding in oneness from a root pointIt is true that the starting point in them may be feelingas with the work of the unconscious artistBut as soon as feeling has decided the startknowledge and reason decide the restThey decide what shapes and colors are to be selected and carefully related to the central shape and colorIf the character of the subject is zigzag then the composition will take a zigzag courseIf a sharp curvethen sharp curves will be gathered from objects surrounding the central one and related to itIn fact the law of association is called in and kept busy throughoutEverything in a picture is consciously associated just as a builder associates the materials of a houseIntuition is checked by reasonSo we find one principle being applied alike by conscious and unconscious methodsWith this differencethat whereas the movementgrowth and unity attained by the unconscious method is organic that reached by the conscious method is mechanicalIt is the difference between the natural growth of a plant and the artificial manufacture of oneThe first is a process whereby the life flow organizes itselfThe second a process of eliminating the life flowThe one is mediumistic and spontaneousthe other is volitional and mechanicalWhatit may be askedis this principle or law Briefly it is the law of The Little Review spiral growth and progression traceable in all natural phenomenaIt is a law which actuates human nature at its best and which shapes all work done in the finer wayIf we wish to see how it operates we cannot do better than symbolize it in the form of a motion curve starting from a point in space and expanding in ever widening curvesThus This law may be found completely applied to one picture or it may be traced running through a succession of pictureseach a part of a creative unitythe whole manifesting the growth and development curve of the artistIn the first case the picture would have an organic unity of its ownIn it the fluid motion would be seen coming to fruition from the initial point of feeling to its fullest statement as vision at the highest pressure of fluid expressionThus In the second caseeach period of the artist s work would represent a section of the development curveBy placing the sections together it is possible to view his work as a whole and to construct the course of development which he has undergoneAnd we can tell by the widest sweep of the curve precisely where he stands and how much he has detached himself from the world of solidsThus Needless to saythis motion curve may be applied as a standard of art criticismIndeed it is the business of art critics to experience this curve in themselves and to apply it to all works of artSo far as I know it has never been appliedWhen it is it will transform art criticismFor it will enable the critic to judge whether a work is an inevitable growth of a movement inherent in the artistand to value it rightly and fully in its relation to this movementor whether it is merely a bit of clever brain jugglingI have not time nor space to illustrate in minute detail the truth and importance of the application of this law to art formsBut I may take one concrete instance of its existence and inevitablenessand of the growth and progress that result whenever the artist happens to work under its guidanceI have within recent months seen the existence of this law and traced the course of its working in the studies of a new and comparatively unknown comer in the world of paintingHere is a painterClarence EKing by 42 The Little Review namewho is undoubtedly working out his high destiny in terms of Artat the bidding of a force to whose direction he is willing to surrender himselfAnd he surrenders himself not because he has no judgmentno discriminating sense of his ownbut because he believes that the true artist works without volitionI know very little about MrKing s first experiencesbut I can quite imagine that art expression came to him as a bewildered dreamPerhaps he felt instinctively it was but an imaginary magician s wand and the effect it ever sought to produce was far above the limited measure of the artist s dead materialsIt was an effect that could only be attained in one waynot by stonewoodor canvasbut by direct surrender to its livingnessI remember once receiving a letter from MrKing in which he hinted at some such transcendental vision of Art and indicated its difficultiesboth aesthetic and economicThe latter will be seen to be very real when I say that MrKing is a poor manthat he has to engage in a mechanical form of occupation which constantly opposes him with the dread of losing guidance and his real purposeand of falling under the subjection of aims and methods entirely opposed to his ownFrom the letter I learned that he began with a longing to attain the maximum intensity of expression and he has ever since been impelled irresistibly towards this endBut the path was not easyfor it seems he became aware at an early period of the small measure of expression in the painter s dead materialsHe relates how one day he took his colors into the sun so that they should rival its livingnessBut when he looked at themin the light of the sunthey were deadThen he bought the most expensive painthe kept his palette cleanhe slept in the openwatched the sunriseabsorbed its magicand prepared himself and his materials in every wayas he thoughtto express the fluid character of the experience flowing through himHe grappled with powerful feelings and sought to fix them in formTo no purposeApparently there was a point beyond which paintlike wordscould not goThe faulthoweverwas not altogether in the materialsThe artist too was to blameHe was a boy strenuously striving to transcend representative formsBut in doing so he neglected one thingHe made no attempt to escape from the illusion of volume and solidity contained in solid spaceIn other words he tried to transcend solids by the process of merely copying solidsHe tried to express the eternal livingness of a tree by painting an ephemeral treeThis is the meaning underlying the earliest example of his workIt accounts for the expression of representative forms very slightly raised above actualityIn the second example the next upward sweep of the curve is apparentThe pursuit of the maximum intensity of expression is maintainedwith the result that there is a further escape into fluid motionAnd actuality becomes very much exaggerated as by a hand that feels the stimulating impulse which the steadily increasing growth of an unknown power brings with itPerhaps the most noticeable characteristic of the second example is the attainment of The Little Review 43 a greater freedom of expressionThere is in consequence an increase of intensityand as intensity is the source of rhythmrhythm being but the natural characteristic of what we call intensity a greater manifestation of rhythmThis rhythmic ascentif I may call it somarking the growth and development of intense expressionis continued in the third exampleThe illusion of volume and solidity to be found in the other two examples is still noticeableBut the flow is at a far higher pressure than in actualityand if the painter is not yet fully afloat on fluid motionhe is certainly moving in the desired directionHe is in fact true to his widening curveIt is too early to predict what degree of intensity of effect MrKing will ultimately attainHe is still a young man with an enviable future before himAnd he approximates more and more towards an unconscious method of expressionHe applies the natural law of growth and progression because he mustA time may come when he will take up his pencil and trace a picture as in a trance simply at the bidding of the inner flow called inner necessityIt is certainly hopeful that he has remained up to the present a fairly pure mediumhaving escaped the pollution of conventional art educationHe turned to painting at the urge of inner necessity and expressed himself in intense form and color because such form and color were in him to expressThe technical characteristics of his work are really a part of himselfHe expresses everything with simplicity and freedom because they are characteristics of his own natureIt should be said that he does not aim to produce the so called automatic work of artThere is nothing automatic in a fluid force organizing itself by uniting itself to a medium that is really a part of its own livingnessIf the artist s hands are guided by a mysterious agency it is not a mechanical process any more than the guiding of a plant into leavesblossomand fruit is oneThe artist is really guided by that which is a part of his higher selfHe surrenders himself to the guidance of a spirit which is his ownthe spirit of ArtAnd in doing so he achieves his highest destinyFor in the complete surrender to Art lies the affirmation of Art44 The Little Review My Friend The Incurable vWAR HALLUCINATIONS An interview with MmeTruth I found her in an obscure corner of a wein stube which bore the legend In vino VeritasShe

from this initial production of Alice in Wonderland the new management of the Fne Arts Theatre is going to justify the name of the theatre and yet compete with the loop theatres in attracting the attention of the general publicThe Players Producing Company has been wise in securing the services of an exceptionally good professional company under the direction of MrWHGilmoreand they have made an unusually happy start with Miss Gerstenberg s dramatization of Lewis Carroll s classicsupplemented by the scenery of MrWmPHenderson and the musical setting of MrEric de LamarterAt first thought it seems incredible that the subtle comedy of Alice in Wonderland could lend itself to the wider stage values but the dialogue loses nothing it gainsratherby the transpositionSome doubt has been expressed as to whether Alice is really a children s classic or an adult classicOn the stage that doubt is resolved it is bothThe children appreciate seeing all the quaint creatures and people that Alice meets in her adventuresand the grown ups enjoy the humor of the dialogue and the extraordinary real unreality of Carroll s imaginationAs a matter of fact the psychology of Lewis Carroll is amazing He lived long before MmeMontessori yet in his own whimsical fashion he has recorded how absurdly unreal and fantastic the unrelated elements of education must seem to the child mind The grown up who does not appreciate the humor of Alice in Wonderland must be a very dull personBoth the fun and the dream quality of the original have been carefully emphasized in the productionMrHenderson s scenery is successful in more senses than oneFirst of all it is beautiful and entirely in the spirit of the playandsecondlyit does not sacrifice the actors as so much of the new stage craft has a tendency to doAlthough extremely rich and varied in colorthe setting waits for the final complement of the actors in costume before the design is completeAs MrHenderson is a painterrather than aman of the theatrethat vague term invented by Craig he knows how to obtain effects on the stage by colorand does not depend upon the manipulation of direct lighting often as imitative and theatrical as the old style scenery to create illusionHe obtains the effect of depth or distance on the stage by the tonal quality of his painted droprather than by an increased cubic depth which is apt to reduce an actor to the thin and non existent quality of a paper silhouetteIt is well to indicate these principlesfor they are all important in connection with drama that depends upon speechand in his use of these principles MrHenderson is probably the most radical of all the advanced scenic artistsThe Little Review Altogether Chicago has reason to be proud of this productionIt reveals the fact that Chicago is not without independent artistic initiativeand a full conviction of this fact should lead to interesting developmentsUnforunately in this review it is impossible to speak of the acting in detailbut this is hardly necessary as the critics have given it the stamp of their approvalFor the professional finish of the performance credit is due to MrWHGilmoreLittle Miss Alice Tobin made an ideal AliceIn fact not one part is mis castand all the actors give the impression that they are having the time of their life which contributes much to the spirit of the entertainmentMrDe Lamarter s music has a charming fantastic quality and great delicacy of imaginationAnd above all the delightful freshness of the play is due to Miss Gerstenberg s good faith in sticking to the text of the original and not attempting to pump into it any extraneous matter which might have deteriorated into musical comedy or farceAs it is the play is a fantasyandwhen successfulas in this caseno form is more capable of giving lasting enjoymentSHRMusic SAMAROFF AND CLAUSSEN Olga Samaroffis not conspicuous for her bad piano playingThere are a great many othersas prominent as MmeSamaroffas popular in their own waywho make just as much noise when they play pianists who seem to exert an odd vigilance lest music enter in for a momentMmeSamaroff played Beethoven s E flat piano concerto with the Chicago SymphonyThis work is unique in its bombastcausing one to blush for the composerThe soloist appeared in an ample gown of scorched orangewith slippers of scarletand gave the work its traditional beatingThe eye suffered only less than the earBut the excellent Claussentaking part in a Wagner programswept away all pettinessShe liberated emotions that Wagner alone can touchwhen adequately interpretedHere is no prima donnabut an artist who singsHer voice is a brimming over of loveliness her emotional power becomes inevitablefor she sings in phrases of beauty a living beauty that moves to tearsHers is an art that pervades and satisfies something to be treasuredVocalists are generally peacocks usually moultingIt is a great event to discover a singing artistfor when the lack is neither a matter of intelligence nor of intensityit often happens that the musician uses a voice that The Little Review 51 could never perjure itself as beautifulJulia Claussen gives a feeling of utter securityNo sensibility is wounded or left asleepSamaroff is not to be blamedindividually although what she represents is not an artbut a menacefor it is always applaudedcopiedand taught to the youthSonority and power in tone masses are never obtained by blows upon the piano keysor by waving the arms over the headThe piano is capable of infinite shading and many kinds of tonefrom mighty chords and fierce tumult to delicate tontal weavings and vague states of calmfrom crystalline brilliance to low sung intimate melodies and there are certain artists now living who listen closelyhear these strange secretsand bring them out for other earsOlga Samaroffapparentlylike her Chicago audienceis aware chiefly of the difference between loud and softHERMAN SCHUCHERTBook Discussion Peter Pan LoverYoung Earnestby Gilbert Cannan DAppleton and CompanyNew YorkA manwho is submissive to his emotions is not in power over himself so wrote Spinoza and such a man is René Fourmythe Peter Pan lover of Gilbert Cannan s latest novelwho never grew up into the fact that he should not have everything he wantedAfter a boyhood and youth of almost unconscious surrender to environmenthe suddenly rebelled against the pretense that surrounded him and gave himself up as completely to his emotions as he had hitherto yielded himself to external circumstancesHe had been educated to be a professor and had married an ambitious girl without having awakened to the meaning of lifeloveor passionHis first great disillusionment came with his honeymoonwhen instead of finding in his bridethe new wonders and sweet joyof fulfilled lovethey togetherattained nothing but heathungerand distress When he could bear this relationship no longer he fled to Londoncast in his lot with Anna girl of the slumsand became a taxi driverHere he was happy for a time because of his savage hunger for real thingsno matter if they were degradingThe crudeharsh reality of this life fascinated him until he discovered that Ann s love was no more the fulfillment of his dreams than his wife s had been only its honesty had made it endurableWhen he discovers that Ann is to have a child an unwantedunexpected child that will be like a chain binding their two lives he is driven to a second rebellion and the ultimate rediscovery of his first sweetheartAnn shows her anger in the vulgaruncontrolled outbursts natural to such a womanand finally 52 The Little Review disappears to Canadaleaving René free to go to CathleenWe are given to understand that at last René has attained to the happiness of his love dreambut nothing MrCannan has told us warrants the belief that he might not suddenly discover that Cathleen too falls short of his vision of what real love should be and start out madly once more in pursuit of he knows not whatIf he and Cathleen do finish their lives together it is safe to gamble that it will not be because René has learned to adjust himself to life but because he has met his Waterloo in Cathleena clever woman who wanted him and understood how to keep himRené was a rebel against the conventions which interfered with his happinessa dreamerand a seeker after the Holy Grail of loveHis attempts to find happiness were utterly selfishyet honestso that our quarrel is not with his morals but with his egotismHe never awoke to the responsibilities of lifenever felt remorse for the sufferings that he caused othersnever grew up to the consciousness that life was intended for something higher than the fulfillment of his enthusiastic visionsbut blundered into more or less freedom where another manperhaps equally rebellious but more scrupulouswould quietly maintain his outward equanimity and let conventional spiders weave their webs all about himQuarrels there will be and condemnation arising from Young Earnestbut will they be because readers think MrCannan does not understand whereof he writes or because he is audacious enough to describe a man who would not accept shamsWe may not like the subject any better than we would a painting of a maimed or ugly personyet that objection does not destroy its artand art it hasin an unusual degreeOnly a skilled writer could depict a man doing sensual things without being a sensualistand René was just the opposite of thatAll his sins were of the spirit rather than of the fleshHis ambition in life was to find happiness at any costHe desired love as many desire money and with as little consideration for othersand although hopelessly at odds with conventional standards and prudish morals it seems to me that the study of Young Earnest s efforts to understand life and his own self is rather a glorious attemptand that Gilbert Cannan has been decidedly courageous to try to reduce to printed terms the emotionsaspirationscravingsand blunders of a young man too honest to accept deceitsyet too cowardlyor perhaps too braveto stand by his blundersNot a pretty storyof coursebut life is seldom pretty when it is frankand his stumblingfrom one love to anotheris not the expression of sensuality but rather a spiritual attempt to live out the best that was in himThe book has many passages of beautymany expressions of keen philosophy which seem to indicate that the author s soul belongs to the divine side of life not to its sordidnessSo wonderfully does he reproduce mediocritymiddle class respectabilityand the vital if less commendable phases of Mitcham Mews that one is led to believe that all of life from visions to slums is unfolding to himand that no matter what his subjecthis pen The Little Review will paint a picture that rings trueOne could hardly find a more subtle task than has been accomplished in Young Earnest that of painting a man who was not a sensualist doing sensual thingsThat MrCannan knew precisely what he was doing is revealed in the words that he puts into the mouth of one of his characters who describes René as being a mansimply inappropriate in a community

PAROXYSM IN POETRY Rex LampmanPortlandOregonQuoting MrEdward JO Brien s instructive article in TH E LITTLE REVIEW for JanuaryParoxysm is the poetic expression of that modern spirit which finds its most notable expression in the sculpture of Meunierthe polyphonic music of Straussthe philosophy of Bergsonand the American skyscraper It aims to attain and expresswith the quickkeen vigor and strength of steelthe whirlingaudaciousburning life of our epoch in all the paroxysm of the New Beauty Quoting the dictionarya paroxysm isany suddenviolent and uncontrollable action or emotiona convulsion or fit The dictionary definition seems more nearly to apply to inspirational poetic effortsuch as Poe had in mind when he advanced his theory that a long poem is an artistic impossibilty such an effort is as necessary to any truly poetic performanceMrO Brien s definition refers to a particular kind of poetic effortwhichto achieve its aimsalso must be inspirationaland finds its inspiration inmodern industrial and mechanical effort rather than in all creationfree field for the poet of no prescribed and particular provinceI am totally unacquainted with the sculpture of Meunieralmost as innocent of knowledge of Strauss s musicand of Bergson I know but a littlebut I have seen the American skyscraper clutching its black steel fingers toward the blueamid the rat tat tat tat tat of the pneumatic riveting hammersHere in Portland the skyscraper is pre empting one by one our views of the evergreen hills and the snowy mountainsPerhaps the other things MrO Brien enumerates as paroxyst manifestations are shutting off our views of the eternal verities of life and the silent splendors of the soulor ratherperhaps they symbolize the materialistic ideals that are walling us away from the things of the spiritIf we accept these paroxyst manifestations as artand keep our eyes fixed on themsurely the infinite horizonwith its never conquered boundaries always beckoning out and onis lost to usBut do we accept themBeyond the skyscrapers are the quiet hillsand however we throw ourselves into the vortices of citieshowever often we go down among the red mouthedroaring furnaceshowever we may acquiesce inand even exult in and exaltthe materialistic horrors that multiply around us like monsters in a steamy primal fendeep in ourselves we know that all these things are vain and vanishingand that the actual and enduring lie outside and beyondor within ourselvesThe skyscraper is a monument to the Moloch of RentThe furnaces are those of Baalin which we give our souls as well as those of our children for sacrifice The evolution of poetry is to be as rapid and terrible henceforth as material evolution says MNicholas Beauduinas quoted by MrO BrienNothe gods will not forbid itfor it is their way to let things run their coursesThe Little Review Doubtless there were singerswhen Babylon was buildingwho insisted that a new poetry was necessary to celebrate the citywith its walls and towers and the efficient wonder of its sewer systemif it had onePerhaps these poetsblinking in the glare of the furnaces and confused by the thunder of the shops whence issued the swords and spears and war chariotssaid to each other These are the supremest thingsthe worth while thingsand we must sing of them or be out of date And a paroxyst school was bornBut always the heart of man has yearned toward things other than the works of his handsWhen the walls and towers and spears and chariots have returned to the earth from which they were fashionedthere still endured the love for those other thingsand the joy in their artistic expressionThe springtimebanal as it is as a poetic subjectwill remain forever more pleasing to the singer and his audience than can any paroxysmof howeverscientific technique proclaiming inswifthurtlingdynamic rhythmsthe clamor and clangor of an armor plate factory or the din and danger of a textile millThe earth is our motherand hers are our deepest yearningsfirst and last She waits for each and all And if the paroxysts seek for power for power that overcomes and subduesthat smites suddenly or conquers slowlyand recreates again

whoever it was that indited the Canticle willI believeoutlast any paroxysm which records acinematographic vision of modern life This is possibly the idea of the paroxysts themselvesthey to sing anew
