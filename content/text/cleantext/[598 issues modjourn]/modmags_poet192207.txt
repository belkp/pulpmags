sitting down with the outward aid of crooked canes and the inward support of sighs on what is presumably a park bench shaded by mountain laurels with a swan pond for a background The men also carry the venerable pipes of tradition in this case heavily crusted corn cobs Their speech very slow and gentle gives them the sound of impersonal instruments improvising a harmless duo prosaic music blown into the air at the end of smoke spirals the re lighting of pipes necessarily frequent The only apparent difference between them traceable perhaps to the unconscious bias of habitual meditation and perpetual comparison of ideas has reduced itself to a slight wagging of the head on the part of the one as opposed to a slight nodding on   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the part of the other Speech and movement coincide almost as caressingly as the effect produced by lips brushing wood instruments  Henry Nay but I insist that the quick sharp touches the rain and slower titillation the sun put upon those flowers we saw have in them the same heedless passion heedless of all save the self which envelops unconscious adolescence That isn t the type of caress I m seeking  Hodge Those flowers were pale indeed with a suggestion of pink and beginning of blue  Henry Early degrees of coloration solely indicative of the mood of self interest of rain and of sun alternately shaping something like a left hand and right of one and the same conjurer reproducing his own vague image the flower somehow a captive clay just as we are subject to the next modulation towards the next helpless state of being I ve had my share and enough of such no longer magical passes  Hodge Nearer to red and closer to purple   Alfred Kreymborg  Henry That is the type of caress which has made of what I was the droning instrument I am played upon in the one tonality of a careless self love so long that the grave itself will simply be the final effort of the same somebody using me to express himself in a minor cadence his little alas but a sigh that his composition closed so shabbily  Hodge And still you cannot recall stubborn lad that you are a single variation a dissonance a breve  Henry Neither can you Hodge  with your eye pointing forward Hodge Let us try just once more again Henry Folk song of the hopeful Hodge And perhaps Henry Da capo of the hopeless Hodge Possibly the shade of this laurel  itself the design of accident angle of sun and of tree meeting rounding spreading will quiet your melancholy and some quaint caress have room to stir your memory mislaid  Henry Memory is a cupboard   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I have gone to myriad times and have returned the one time always with relics so tedious I find them heavier than boulders Since you who persist must try once again pray take down the future if you can  Hodge Let us then sit here and wait and the strange the new may yet transpire  Henry You nod your head and I wag mine that is the difference between us you have verticals left in you I am all horizontal  Hodge But we are breathed into moving in accordance with the odd delicately reciprocal nuance of our one and the same  Henry Bassoonist Hodge You dub him lugubriously Henry Accurately Hodge Henry  Henry looks at Hodge Hodge smiles They smoke in silence Hodge points with his pipe stem Hodge That swan  a white interrogation embracing the water and being embraced in response  Henry Their eyes reflecting each other their bodies displacing   Alfred Kreymborg  Hodge That swallow cleaving the air trusting his wings to the waves of ether  Henry And the air trusting him with room in her body relinquishing just enough space for him to fit himself into  Hodge Or the worm underground digging cylinder channels Henry And the earth undulating  to the pressure of excavation Hodge Caresses like these simple Henry Henry Caresses like those simpler Hodge  have been clapped in my ear by your credulous tongue with such affectionate fortitude I m a bell attacked by echoes each time the sea moves  Hodge looks at Henry and wags his head Henry nods and smiles Hodge turns away  Henry You also remind me of evergreens refusing to acknowledge the seasons or unable to distinguish between white flowers and snow You re as old and as young as romance  Hodge It s you who fall redundant you who fondle the rondo why not have done and call me senile   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Henry Senility is a sling invented by cynical youths who envy and would rob the old of their possessions  Hodge You admit possessions you contradict yourself  Henry My property comprises the realization stripped bare of hope or hypothesis that I own neither things nor persons least of all these myself Nor am I longer deluded with even the thought of touching a body that pirate youth would filch who cannot rid his blood of desire  Hodge Then you must be that youth  since you crave Henry A type of caress Hodge How do you wriggle out of that  Hodge and Henry relight their pipes  Henry The type of caress I crave must have in it no desire to make of me aught of what it would make of itself It must not say to me I would make of you more of me and less of you   Alfred Kreymborg  Hodge Nor must it lure me by virtue of the bounty of its body or the beauty of its mind to sigh I would make of myself more of you and less of me  Henry I have had enough of such juxtaposition Hodge The immortal dialogue of life and of death Henry The recurrent symbol of being and reflection Hodge Of Narcissus in love with himself  Henry Of God chanting a solo to comfort His loneliness like an aged woman knitting things for her children to wear in her own image singing This is I and you are mine so wear my love as I love you  Pause Henry lowers his head so does Hodge  Henry If it is God who fashioned me is it He who asks is He pleased   POETRY A Magazine of Ve  Hodge Does my prayer which is His if I m His move or leave Him unmoved  Henry It is He who lifts these questions or am I to blame for thinking  Hodge If He noticing me at last notices Himself what s wrong with Him  Henry Really I m not regretting what I am nor begging make me better  Hodge If I have a sense of the droll surely He has one too  Henry Asking Himself to pray to Himself that is if He fashioned me  Pause  Hodge Does it comfort you Henry A little for a moment   Alfred Kreymborg  Hodge Farther than last time Henry A tiny stretch beyond  They raise their heads  Hodge It s still a wee mad melody  Henry Innocent blasphemy of the inner frantic to grow to the outer to the more than itself the molecule a star the instant universal the me a trifle closer to the you that gave it life  Hodge You recall how you composed it years before we came to this  Henry As clearly as a brook and you sitting in its midst like a pebble nodding assent to the foolish reckless sound  Hodge Strange that we return to it Henry Stranger still we do naught but return  They continue smoking Henry wagging Hodge nodding  Hodge Did you feel something stir Henry Only another breeze Hodge But didn t you see that cloud alter Henry The cause of the breeze   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Hodge Caressing us Henry Leaving me colder Hodge Me warmer Henry When the temperature in a room  is higher or lower than normal it is needful to open or to shut a window  Hodge Which  Henry A west wind urges me to shut a west window an east an east that is all And I have known the same touch to thrill and leave me cold and this monotonous heart of mine to open and close in childish acquiescence  Hodge Button your coat about you  Henry We have no business gadding around in the spring it was you who suggested it you with your nodding  Hodge It was the look of the world outdoors let us try another place or wander back home again  Henry And try just once more Hodge Perhaps providing Henry We are like twin philosophers  phrase practitioners who argue with slender   Alfred Kreymborg  tapering sensitive beards which each lays persuasive hold of pulling first the one the other and the other the one in turn till their heads collide and rebound back to the starting point  with if or suppose or providing or but Hodge But you have more wisdom Henry And you more happiness  And thus the moon pursues the sun  Hodge touches Henry  Hodge Are you angry Henry Angry with you  They eye each other smile faintly and turn away  Henry Your talk comes to me from afar though you are only an elbow away like rain making an arid soil intimate with better things They perhaps are what are left me  Hodge If I say I love thee in some guise or other this is more than talk  Henry The gesture of a lonely spirit reaching out to a lonelier  They methodically shake out their pipes and stuff them   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  away Hodge nudges Henry ever so gently Henry tries to rise Hodge has to aid him They move away haltingly Hodge s stick tapping a little in advance of Henry s and Hodge s arm through Henry s Henry tries to shake off Hodge hut the latter persists They move slightly faster  Henry Was it yesterday I said  Hodge What Henry  Henry I love thee  Hodge In actual words nay  but the day before Henry Then let them have been said  yesterday as well  for if words ever fail me Hodge They never fail you Henry Nor you Hodge  They nod together  Henry Let us go silently  the next pace or two Hodge As you will Henry And let other things speak Hodge For us Henry For themselves  They disappear Hodge s stick still sounding in advance of Henry s Alfred Kreymborg   IN THE DARK CITY  There is a harper plays Through the long watches of the lonely night When like a cemetery Sleeps the dark city with her millions laid each in his tomb  I feel it in my dream but when I wake Suddenly like some secret thing not to be overheard It ceases And the gray night grows dumb  Only in memory Linger those veiled adagios fading fading Till with the morning they are lost  What door was opened then What worlds undreamed of lie around us in our sleep That yet we may not know Where is it one sat playing Over and over with such high and dreadful peace The passion and sorrow of the eternal doom  John Hall Wheelock   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NOTES OF TRAVEL  ON THE TRAIN  I  The lady in front of me in the car With little red coils close over her ears Is talking with her friend And the circle of ostrich foam around her hat Curving over like a wave Trembles with her little windy words What is she saying I wonder That her feathers should tremble And the soft fur of her coat should slip down over her  shoulders Has her string of pearls been stolen Or maybe her husband  II  He is drunk that man Drunk as a lord a lord of the bibulous past He shouts wittily from his end of the car to the man in the  corner He bows to me with chivalrous apologies He philosophizes plays with the wisdom of the ages Flings off his rags Displays his naked soul Athletic beautiful grotesque   Harriet Monroe  In the good time coming When men drink no more Shall we never see a nude soul dancing Stript and free In the temple of his god  III  She comes smiling into the car With iridescent bubbles of children She blooms in the close plush seats Like a narcissus in a bowl of stones She croons to a baby in her lap The trees come swinging by to listen And the electric lights in the ceiling are stars  AT O NEILL S POINT  Grand Canyon of Arizona  Cardenas I salute you You marauding buccaneering Spaniard You ragged and sworded lordling slashing through to the  Seven Cities of Cibola You athirst in the desert seeking to drink from the great  river The mother of western seas dear to your Hopi guides You Cardenas the Spaniard three centuries before the  next first white man   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  You with your handful of starvelings stood on this Rim  of the Canyon And looked down at flecks of water in the deeps Like yellow petals fallen You scrambled a few hundred feet down the sheer rock  wall And knew you would never drink of that tawny torrent You gave it up and thirsted and cursed your guides  And your leader Coronado the adventurer Thought you mad when you told your story Mad of thirst in the desert Dreaming of loud deep rivers In demon haunted caverns  But I believe you Here where I stand you stood On the rim of the world You saw these sky wrapt towers These terraced purple temples august and terrible And over them over You gazed at the Celestial City And counted the steps of gods on its ramparts And saw the Great White Throne all pearl and moonstone Beyond through the turquoise gates   Harriet Monroe  IN THE YELLOWSTONE  Little pin prick geysers spitting and sputtering  Little foaming geysers that spatter and cough  Bubbling geysers that gurgle out of the calyx of morning glory pools Laughing geysers that dance in the sun and spread their robes like lace over the rocks  Raging geysers that rush out of hell with a great noise and blurt out vast dragon gulps of steam and finishing sink back wearily into darkness  Glad geysers nymphs of the sun that rise slim and nude out of the hot dark earth and stand poised in beauty a moment veiling their brows and breasts in mist  Winged geysers spirits of fire that rise tall and straight like a sequoia and plume the sky with foam  O wild choral fountains forever singing and seething forever boiling in deep places and leaping forth for bright moments into the air  How do you like it up here Why must you go back to the spirits of darkness What do you tell them down there about your little glorious life in the sun  UTAH  It was a queer country your harsh Lord gave you Great Brigham whom I see coated and curled   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In bronze before me in the public square It was a scraped and shining skeleton Gnawed to the bone long since at God s first breakfast And thrown away to bleach out in the sun Yet here He led you The Lord and his vicegerent Joseph Smith He ordered you To take the dead earth from His niggard hand And set His Throne up by the salty sea The little bucketful of ocean poured Over the desert s feet between the hills  And so you starved and prayed Thirsted and starved and prayed through the lean years Keeping the faith digging your little ditches Making the desert blossom as the rose You married many wives And got you many children to fulfil The special order whispered in the night To His apostle by the Lord Himself The God of Abraham of Saul and David Of Solomon and other lustful kings  And here tithe upon tithe stone upon stone Your saints built up His throne unto the Lord From plans the angel taught your hand to draw His new Solomon s Temple heaven remembered To rise again here at the western gate  And prove His glory in these latter days   Harriet Monroe  Great Brigham sleeping now under the desert With all your wives What summary vengeance have you meted out To that ironic angel  He alone builds Who buildsfor beauty shrining his little truth In stones that make it fair  IN HIGH PLACES  My mountains God has company in heaven Crowned saints who sing to him the sun long day He has no need of speech with you with you Dust of his foot stool No but I have need Oh speak to me for you are mine as well Drift of my soul I built you long ago I reared your granite masonry to make My house of peace and spread your flowered carpets And set your blue tiled roof and in your courts Made musical fountains play Ah give me now Shelter and sustenance and liberty That I may mount your sky assailing towers And hear the winds communing and give heed To the large march of stars and enter in The spirit crowded courts of solitude  Harriet Monroe   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  THE WHITE MOTH  Every night At my windy when I quench the light Between nine an ten  A White Moth Soars through the trees Light as the froth Blown off of the seas  At the same time It flutters white In the scented lime Every night  Seems like it is When I draw the blind As if the hair riz Straight off me mind  For how do it come Just to the minute As if it heard some Clock strikin in it  Seems like the spell Of some Mighty One Come for to tell Of some thing I done   Rosamond Langbridge  Seems like a sign I done him some hurt When I whipped from his line Quilty s white shirt  Me heart wouldn t crack But the spell would break If I took it back As a little mistake  Still I m no debtor To a bit of light froth Maybe twould be better To crush the White Moth  THE GENTLE HOUSEWIFE  There s the first white butterfly dancing abroad There are wild wind flowers dotting the sward There are wild green breakers combing the bay There s a red ferret darting over the way  But I am chiding the children for being so wild I am chiding the nurse for chiding the child I am careful to lay down tea leaves in the hall I am gazing at that spot of mildew on the wall  And my heart is breaking breaking With the hatred of it all  Rosamond Langbridge   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FULL OF LAUGHTER  Very full of laughter is the old man The air is full of wings Of the little birds of laughter Which the old man flings From his mouth up to the rafter In the white washed ceiling That vibrates with his laughter And quivers and sings Till the little birds come stealing To the lips whence they came And you only hear the laughter In the shaking of the flame In the tapping of the leaves And you only hear the laughter Very faintly if at all Until as you drowse suddenly once more He awakes with a roar And the laughter goes flapping from the ceiling to the wall Very full of laughter is the old man  Very full of laughter is the old man I know not what I say I mistrust what I hear There s an evil tongue licking where the log fires play The round cat heaves with a laughter and a fear There are wells lying deeper   Louis Golding  Than the laughter in his eyes There are glooms lying deeper Than the lost lands of the sleeper There are sounds behind the laughter Which I dare not follow after There s a choked heart tolling and a dumb child cries There s an old mouth full of laughter But a dumb heart cries  Louis Golding  SYNCRASY  I am a reed Wind throated and rain tuned You are the player Wise as the world  What will you blow through me Softmouth What sorrows must I echo From your honied lips To learn the sweetness of pain What lachrymations must I silver To learn the bitterness of love  1 am a reed Waiting and silent You are the player Searching your heart  A A Rosenthal   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  KING ALFRED AND THE PEASANT WOMAN  Throw me from the house did he  Well to new chivalry that is no great thing  I am my father s daughter lady  And he s a pretty figure in the ring  But my man my master there he sat a dreaming While all the house might burn and he d not sorrow Nor had I any warrant that his scheming Would bring us any victory on the morrow  And I spoke to him Oh I informed him He d be a dead man if he were not stung Could any man keep hands down and me lashing Friend you insult my tongue  I d rather he fought me than missed his combats Though I m not built for blows upon the heart Give me a breast plate and I ll at em Though

POET ADVISES A CHANGE OF CLOTHES  Why wears my lady a trailing gown And the spurious gleam of a stage queen s crown Let her leap to a horse and be off to the down Astride let her ride For the sake of my pride That she is more ancient than Diana Ancient as that she ape who lurking among trees Dropt on a grazing zebra gript him with her knees And was off across the breadths of the savannah Barking her primal merry deviltry Barking in forecast of her son s sovereignty My timeless lady is as old as she And she is moderner moreover Than Broadway or an airship or than Paris lingerie  O my eternal dominating dear How much less dated thou than Guinevere Then for your living lover Change your gown And don your queenship when you doff your crown  Anna Wickham   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PREDICTION  In some inimical starry night  When the worthies are abed  Suddenly will come a flight  Of baleful things about your head  These will not be simply bats  These imponderable as leaves  These will not be timid gnats  These will be audacious thieves  Devils of the midnight s action Wrong ones of the twisted spheres A fluttering unholy faction Of Port Havoc mutineers  In your spirit s corridors There will that night be strange things What were dances will be wars There will be vain imaginings Slaughter and knavery and laughter Sights to make a man afraid Boozing cajoling boasts and after I need not say you ll be betrayed  Since the story is so bitter The quaint world will find its proofs What is left of you will flitter Like a grey cat on the roofs  Morris Gilbert   IN RUSSIA  THE SPILLING OF THE WINE  The soldiers lie upon the snow That no longer gyrates under the spinning lights Night juggles in her fat black hands They will not babble any more secrets to loose mouthed  nights Expanding in golden auras While sleigh bells jingle like new coins the darkness  shuffles They will not drink any more wine Wine of the Romanoffs Jewelled wine The secret years worked slowly at Till it was wrought to fire As stones are faceted Until they give out light The soldiers lie very still Their shadows have shrunk up close As toads shrink under a stone And night and silence The ancient cronies Foregather above them  But still over the snow that is white as a ram s fleece Arms swing like scythes   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And shadows in austere lines Sway in a monstrous and mysterious ritual Shadows of the Kronstad sailors Pouring blood and wine Wine Spurting out of flagons in a spray of amethyst and gold Creeping in purple sluices Wine And blood in thin bright streams Besprinkling the immaculate snow Blood high powered with the heat of old vineyards Boring into the cool snow Blood and wine Mingling in bright pools That suck at the lights of Petrograd As dying eyes Suck in their last sunset  The night has a rare savor Out of the snow piles altar high and colored as by a  rosy sacrifice Scented vapor Ascends in a pale incense Faint astringent perfume Of blood and wine   Lola Ridge  SNOW DANCE FOR THE DEAD  Dance little children it is holy twilight Have you hung paper flowers about the necks of the ikons Dance soft but very gaily on tip toes like the  snow Spread your little pinafores And courtesy as the snow does The snow that bends this way and that In silent salutation Do not wait to warm your hands about the fires Do not mind the rough licking of the wind Dance forth into the shaggy night that shakes itself upon  you  Dance beneath the Kremlin towers golden In the royal Purple of the sky But not there where the light is strongest Bright hair is dazzling in the light Dance in the dim violet places Where the snow throws out a faint lustre Like the lustre of dead faces Snow downier than wild geese feathers Enough filling for five hundred pillows By the long deep trench of the dead  Bend little children To the rhythm of the snow   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  That undulates this way and that In silver spirals Cup your hands like tiny chalices Let the flakes fill up the rosy Hollows of your palms And alight upon your hair Like kisses that cling softly A moment and let go Like many kisses falling altogether Quick cool kisses  THE WHITE BIRD  Man of the flame eyes And mouth with the bitter twist of in grown laughter And little bald man whose seeming stillness Is akin to the velocity of a spinning star Holding its perfect poise You two yea sayers Beetling over the little deniers Two great levelers building from the earth up among  puttiers and pluggers of rotten piles  You of the rich life running in ample measure amidst life deleted of its old raw fire as earth is deleted of its coal and iron  You be mighty hunters and keepers Trotsky and Lenine   Lola Ridge  Yet can you hold the unconstrainable One Of the slow and flaming deaths And multiple resurrections  Hands reaching in hundreds of millions Backs straightening under the keeling floor of the world Can you hold the great white bird She that sweeps low over the chain gangs When they glance up from their stone breaking Into morning s burning gold She that goes down into underground cells Sending the cool wind of her wings Through unsevering stone And departs unbeknown from those who announce her Saying Lo she is ours  Ah what a mighty destiny shall be yours Should you persuade her  The Unconstrainable One  Who has slid out of the arms of so many lovers  Leaving not a feather in their hands  Lola Ridge  POETRY A Magazine of Vers  COMMENT  SHELLEY  N these days of revolutionary changes it is appropriate to be reminded of Shelley by the centenary of his death and the reminder may well lead us to a deeper study of the man and his work than a casual reading of The Cloud and The Skylark For of all the ranking English poets Shelley was preeminently the poet with a message a type somewhat decried by modern esthetic theorists who would not permit the muse to stiffen her lips with didactic emphasis Even Milton the Puritan partisan of Cromwell pleader for free speech free thought free divorce and other heresies was a conservative conformist beside Shelley whose stark idealism accepted no compromise whose ardor for a complete revolution in human society would have been like Lenin s the same in act as in desire if he also could have faced the tragic ironies of fate by achieving political power  Of course we have only the beginning of Shelley s thinking for he was under thirty and young for his age when he died Yet there is a kind of finality about it for he seems youth incarnate youth immortal and perhaps as with the great mystics among whom Mr Yeats classes him old age with him would have been but a diviner childhood Aflame with reformatory zeal he theorized with complete conviction and his theoretic picture of a perfect world was as untroubled by common sense as a   Shelley  cubistic painting and as unaffected by the humane perspectives of humor He had youth s singlemindedness single sightedness perceiving a vivid truth he struck out toward it through all obstacles no matter how many conventions laws or even human hearts were broken on the way only to be deflected from the immediate goal by the more flaming ardor of a newer revelation  His creed was essentially Godwin touched by emotion eighteenth century radicalism transfigured by a poet s dreams Freedom sacrosanct and glorified was its cardinal principle evil is an accident could man always have been free he would never have wandered from virtue government is but the badge of his degradation Lift from his past history the incubus of the law with its consequences of obedience fear faith and slavery grant him through all his course freedom of thought of action and of love and man s career would have been one long millennium of universal justice And now this long delayed peace on earth must be invoked on the instant by chosen souls Live out your life fulfil all natural impulses so long as your heart is pure restrain neither thought nor deed and neither change nor falter nor repent such was the counsel of perfection which his impulsive practicalness urged upon his puny neighbors and flaunted brightly in the face of the canting world He had no time to wait or think If his intellect built too slowly his imagination lightly overleapt logic and perched upon cloudy ramparts for a sunrise song   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The lyrics by which he is chiefly remembered were mere tangents from the rounding circle of his message he would rather have destroyed them probably than let his fame rest upon such slight sparks of personal emotion such flashes of joy or love or despair thrown off casually while from Queen Mab to The Triumph of Life he was summoning to action the hosts of a happier world The language of his summons was clear In The Masque of Anarchy and certain more directly political poems of anathema his faith in the power of the human soul utters a command to the proletariat of his time  Rise like lions after slumber In unvanquishable number Shake your chains to earth like dew Which in sleep had fallen on you Ye are many they are few  In Prometheus Unbound this faith becomes an assertion of man s ultimate supremacy when the painted veil called life is torn aside  The man remains Sceptreless free uncircumscribed but man Equal unclassed tribeless and nationless Exempt from awe worship degree the king Over himself just gentle wise but man Passionless no yet free from guilt or pain Which were for his will made or suffered them Nor yet exempt though ruling them like slaves From chance and death and mutability The clogs of that which yet might oversoar The loftiest star of unascended heaven Pinnacled dim in the intense inane   Shelley  With a zealot s precision Shelley demanded the absolute His was a religious spirit always fascinated by the supernatural seeking communion with an impalpable divine essence Therefore in spite of the buffetings of fate he stands for the revelation to men of ineffable spiritual realities beyond the reach of sensuous experience His soul flamed upward like Blake s though with less detachment He explored the empyrean he touched the intangible his poetry brought down to earth the vision of supernal beauty which had eluded even the blind eyes of Milton Through him the vitality of mystical abstractions the power and sweep of subtle unseen forces the loveliness of secret beauty the glory of naked truth and the upward reach of the human mind toward the infinite splendor are given the fiery proof of song On earth he was ill at ease in the highest heaven of imagination his poise was perfect He never wavered in his flight never stooped to catch the popular ear never degraded for the sake of transient rewards a mission which seemed to him the holiest of all confided to mortal man For poetry he held to be the noblest and most universal of the arts by which truth is made manifest to men language being as a mirror which reflects and the materials of other arts as a cloud which enfeebles the light of which both are mediums  One is tempted to quote whole pages of his magnificent Defence of Poetry in this connection an essay which makes a royal progress through the universe and shows that the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  spirit of poetry is the manifestation of the eternal order and harmony the vitalizing and regenerating principle the exemplar of wisdom and the revealer of love the soul of aspiration the echo of the eternal music the destroyer too of wrong a sword of lightning ever unsheathed which consumes the scabbard that would contain it As an art poetry redeems from decay the visitations of the divinity in man being the record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest and best minds He defends these happiest and best minds who make immortal all that is best and most beautiful in the world from the charges the world has brought against their lives insisting that their frailties are merely the rebound of what is animal and passionate in their nature from a spiritual exaltation they experience and express but do not understand  Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present the trumpets which sing to battle and feel not what they inspire the influence which is moved not but moves Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world  He at least would be true to his high office He would illumine a path for men s hopes to travel even though they mocked him The glorious vision of an exalted destiny for his race was before him and in the fit disclosure of that vision he felt secure of immortal influence even though the world rejected him in life And the world did reject him He threw down the gauntlet and his country took   Shelley  it up His name was the synonym for unspeakable crimes his poems were a target for the wrath and ridicule of reviewers their small editions lay unsold with his publisher and his sympathetic readers could be counted on the fingers of one hand It was long after his death that the song of the nightingale who sat in darkness began to penetrate to men s ears  For in form as well as in feeling Shelley was a revolutionist and therefore unwelcome English poetry was but newly awake from its eighteenth century trance Coleridge Burns and the quiet Wordsworth had brushed away forever those reams of rhymed eloquence with which Pope and his kind had smothered the goddess but the world was as yet scarcely aware of it preferring the old heroics Though Byron was forcing down its throat his modern message Shelley and Keats were still exotics outlandish birds singing a wild strain Perhaps Shelley himself scarcely realized how different his style was from all that had been so long in vogue Like every true poet he had an instinct for form and it was probably by instinct rather than deliberate intention that he followed Coleridge in breaking the long reign of the iambic measure that he played with anapaests and trochees and surpassed in delicate complexity of rhythm even the gay Elizabethans For the expression of modern subtleties he added more strings to their instrument and passed it on to us enriched with new notes and capable of a broader range   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Beauty love and freedom are the triune chord at the basis of Shelley s song We hear it again and again like the Holy Grail motive in Parsifal Prometheus Unbound is the spirit of freedom braving omnipotent tyranny for love of the human race who still declares after aeons of agony  I would fain  Be what it is my destiny to be  The savior and the strength of suffering man  Or sink into the original gulf of things  and at whose release and reunion with Nature when Eternity has conquered the evil principle of Power all earth and her children rejoice in the ecstasy of inextinguishable love and holiness and peace Shelley is at home in the heaven of heavens the Prometheus soars like livid flame and its choruses reach a celestial height of lyric exaltation Whether spirits or echoes or furies speak they speak with eternity behind and before them reveal to us birthless and deathless minds  Prometheus and Adonais and the lyrics are the best of Shelley for in most of the longer poems as even occasionally in these he does not escape grandiloquence With Coleridge and Burns and Keats he restored the lost Elizabethan tradition resumed the grand manner even though his one deliberately Elizabethan experiment was a failure It is curious that this radical could not carry his radicalism into the theatre The Cenci is an imitative dramatic essay rather than a drama an experiment in the Elizabethan manner modified by classic austerities It   Shelley  out Websters Webster in horrors but misses Webster s vitality its characters are premeditated types rather than suffering men and women  Shelley met the world of men and women with the solemn unquestioning belief of some flower or child and when things proved not what they seemed he thought they must be the exact reverse The strength of the recoil was the natural result of the violent eagerness of the attack and it was all a part of his passionate youthfulness For not only the glories of youth but its weaknesses were his its irreverence its fiery impatience its haughty intolerance of the work a day world its reckless daring in the first onset flagging under prolonged effort Thus it is by his upward reach more than his capacity for sustained flight that Shelley wins his place among the masters For this reason his lyrics are the most typical expression of his genius These are the record of his ardent emotionalism each one comes fresh from a burning mood There is no time for inconstancy for the dulling of the fine edge of inspiration such as makes even the Prometheus strongest in its first act a thing which can not be said of a faultless work of art  If he had lived to be old the record might be different But as yet his thinking had not passed through youth s sense of dissonance and unreality When he died he was still aloof from life As to real flesh and blood he said you know I do not deal in those articles and he called himself the knight of the shield of shadow and the lance   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of gossamere Humanity disappointed him and even the momentary joy of dreams brought despair in its wake It was because of the very ardor of his ecstasies that life was for Shelley a series of disillusions One after another the raptures of his youth went out and his path grew darker and more lonely to the end He died at a crucial point in his development when everything seemed to be falling away from him when the struggle with despondency was tempting him to suicide that golden key to the chamber of perpetual rest If he had lived longer he must either have withdrawn more and more from actualities or have emerged into a more mature and humane wisdom  But we need not quarrel with his fate or lament that his eager restless baffled spirit found swift repose in death Life could scarcely have satisfied him in the very exaltation of his purpose lay its doom As it is we may recognize in him the spirit of immortal youth who had scarcely time to cry Then what is life before fate sealed his lips In Adonais he prophetically praises death as if for his own burial but in that last moment of the storm on the Gulf of Spezia he might have sung a still grander song For he was glad to die He was one of  the sacred few who could not tame Their spirits to the conqueror but as soon As they had touched the world with living flame Fled back like eagles to their native noon  H M   A New Pulitzer Prize  A NEW PULITZER PRIZE  The award of a Pulitzer Prize of one thousand dollars to the Collected Poems of Edwin Arlington Robinson is a most agreeable surprise as this is the first Pulitzer Prize ever granted to a poet  Four years ago when the Poetry Society of America gave its first annual five hundred dollars to Sara Teas dale s Love Songs the award being made in conjunction with the Pulitzer prizes was falsely attributed to the same origin An editorial in POETRY for August 1918 called attention as follows to the omission of poetry from the will  Mr Pulitzer s will creating a school of journalism at Columbia University with annual thousand dollar prizes for a novel an editorial a book of science etc omitted poetry Probably he never thought of it nobody was thinking of poetry during the period when his will was drawn Of course the omission of poetry from any prize list which included at least two literary products the novel and the play was preposterous and we may hope that the present donor or other donors may permanently atone for the slight with an annual prize as large as the other prizes  The poem of each year or book of poems must be we submit at least as prize worthy as the editorial of the year It may be of course of a value immeasurably greater for by the favor of the gods it may be a masterpiece an enduring work of genius a distinction which could scarcely be claimed for any editorial  When this year s awards were announced with Mr Robinson s book among them the editor wrote to Columbia University a letter inquiring about the improved status of poets and received the following answer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To the Editor In reply to your letter of May 24th I beg to say that the poetry prize to which you refer was established by the Advisory Board of the School of Journalism at their meeting in May 1921 at which meeting it was on motion unanimously  Resolved That a prize of One thousand dollars be established for the best volume of verse published during the year by an American author  The Board at the same time discontinued another prize for which there had been no competition which action set free sufficient funds to establish the poetry prize Frank D Fackenthal  The initial award is of course worthy of all praise though the committee may have regretted that they could not honor also Miss Millay s Second April Indeed the year 1921 presenting two such books was singularly rich The three members of the poetry jury were Wilbur  L Cross Richard Burton and Ferris Greenslet Though we cannot criticize the verdict in this case we must repeat once more our plea that all juries should be strictly professional and that poets alone have the right and the authority to award honors in their art H M  REVIEWS  CARLOS WILLIAMS NEW BOOK  Sour Grapes by William Carlos Williams Four Seas Co  This is I believe the fourth book that Dr Williams has published The Tempers which came first was a bit thin but contained two fine poems of their sort Next came Al Que Quiere a hard bitten book that attempted to create poetry out of urban modernity Sour Grapes   Carlos Williams New Book  develops more or less the manner of Al Que Quiere and probably contains a greater number of successful poems In between these two came Kora in Hell a mass of prose fragments of Flaubertian precision that as a whole got nowhere  Dr Williams has a considerable leaning toward the conceit and some of his finest poems are examples of it although at other times he drags this structure in by the heels By conceit I mean an intellectual relationship between two objects physically unrelated one of which fuses with the sound and takes on an image existence For example the poem called To Waken an Old Lady  Old age is a flight of small cheeping birds skimming bare trees above a snow glaze Gaining and failing they are buffeted by a dark wind But what On harsh weedstalks the flock has rested the snow  is covered with broken seedhusks and the wind tempered by a shrill piping of plenty  Such poems as this and The Nightingales as the Love   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Song in Al Que Quiere beginning Sweep the house clean are as perfect and as final as Herrick they make a reviewer feel ridiculous But in A Celebration the method is worked to death perhaps because it was a bit tired before it got under way and then had a long way to go and in Primrose the conceit is superfluous If we had been given the images without the explanatory yellow they would have hit harder  In such poems as The Widow s Lament in Springtime however one finds the simple physical image the image without ulterior meaning or even metaphor used with great power  Today my son told me that in the meadows at the edge of the heavy woods in the distance he saw trees of white flowers I feel that I would like to go there and fall into those flowers and sink into the marsh near them  Dr Williams concerns himself with certain phases of American life which he seems to feel acutely and up to date he is not the dupe of his material That is he knows that stenographic reports of snowbirds or hawthorns do not suffice even when smeared with pretty language He looks for relations and the sharpest way to get them down  Despite all Dr Williams passion to the contrary he is greatly influenced by his contemporaries and predecessors   Carlos Williams New Book  by which I do not mean to condemn him but simply to indicate that he like any good writer is inextricably caught in Mr Eliot s tradition His prose is obviously of the school of Flaubert and his verse has gone through various influences The poems in this book have for the most part worked away from the earlier jagged bitterness into a certain serenity of manner that one associates with Mr Pound s Chinese translations a manner that Mr Pound among others has used consciously and successfully How conscious Dr Williams use of it may be I do not know but if it is used unconsciously it may be dangerous the poet may cease to be able to see his material through the sticky haze of his manner Anyway one has a right to wonder when so many of Dr Williams trivialities Spring Epitaph etc have become sweet instead of censorable His grapes are not so sour as they once were although this may be no great matter  There are more fine poems in the book than one can mention in a short review among the most extraordinary being Romance Moderne despite a few low spots Occasionally a good poem is marred by some unnecessary triteness as Overture to a Dance of Locomotives by its title and last line Several fine poems have been omitted among them Wild Orchard and A Coronal I choose to end by quoting one poem without comment The Nightingale  M y shoes as I lean  unlacing them  stand out upon   POETRY A Magazine of Vers  flat worsted flowers  under my feet  Nimbly the shadows  of my fingers play  unlacing  over shoes and flowers  Yvor Winters  A SUNLIT CLEARING  Dreams Out of Darkness by Jean Starr Untermeyer B  W Huebsch  Jean Starr Untermeyer is so completely a mistress of form that though at times her content is weak one still admires To have pinned down form in these days of wavering outline Lake Song realizes the lake suggestion the rush forward and the sudden restraint through toning down becoming almost prose but subtly avoiding prose The rhythm grows upon one but since the matter is slight and inapt grows upon one as a pattern woven of air such an intangible pattern as the wind might have woven above her lake In Sinfonia Domestica and many other of the woman poems the poet is fundamental These poems when they do fail fail for lack of le mot juste they are always psychologically poignant Mastery of form is one achievement of spirit another of diction word and image still another Although I can understand how one might call Sinfonia Domestica a fine poem for its theme and passion for me although I grant the theme and passion and call them fundamental it is a beating   A Sunlit Clearing  about the bush there are many words but few clear cut images so many words that the essential motive is almost submerged For me the two lines in the poem are  And bank my flame to a low hearth fire believing You ll come for warmth and life to its tempered glow  From the Road in November is a good example of poetic paradox expressing a thought in such a fashion as to create an atmosphere belying it The first stanza is The Road in November no questioning that the second and third stanzas are comfortable pictures having nothing to do with either November or death so completely departing from the keynote that the last two lines of the third stanza in which the primary mood recurs are rendered impotent  But then the last line of Little Dirge My youth is slipping through the door  is so complete and so profound that it might be one of Yvor Winters Musterbook poems and stand alone In Berkshire Twilight again paradox The first stanza is inconsequential I quote the second  Evening drops over their peaks And chars their flame Their color sifts into grayness With me it is the same  A preponderance of r s voluptuous sound that nullifies the negativity of even such a word as chars There are certain words that in spite of their accepted definition   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  one may not use in writing in certain contexts Flame and color here outweigh not only grayness and sift but the three dulling periods The poem has the effect of a double negative Impressionism understands the art of juxtaposition of word as of sound and of color I am put in mind of two lines of an autumn poem by Janet Lewis  The deer the deer among the withered asters The spider making tight his web  On Temples though propagandistic is apt Eve Before the Tree I should call a brave failure The story scarcely lends itself to psychological treatment It has in fact been told perfectly in the third chapter of Genesis Consciousness is the anathema of this generation Let us pray that our children will not be introspective Eve analyzes digs up motives she is more the Eve of after the eating than before it Not to mention such anachronisms as  If there was life before I have forgotten it nor can remember Father nor mother sister nurse nor friend  Dreams Out of Darkness is in truth uneven in texture Throughout one finds an abundant womanly sympathy the power of nice observation and a deftness in the employment of metrics The rhythms are plastic and comfortable If one objects to the paucity of idea in say Mist one finds oneself instantly refuted by the authenticity of Anti erotic and Little Dirge Throughout one finds vacillation between the naturalistic method and   A Sunlit Clearing  the conventionally poetic The tone is muted always in a low key There are no new words no significant digressions no discoveries But one has a sense of having gone into a woman s heart found it lovely and understandable and come out satisfied with womankind The tiptoe of rapture however is not there Two and a Child is perhaps representative  Does the spring night call little boys As it calls their wild young mothers But what can a child know of us or others He has different joys A tree that bends and almost smothers Two in the road who clasp and quiver To him is only a swing by the river One of his outdoor toys  Put him to bed and let us flee Out in the night with other lovers It will not be long till he discovers What s known to you and me And then when a destined maiden hovers Near for what only he can give her No Close the door What makes me shiver I will stay here Let me be  Pearl Andelson  TARNISHED GOLD  Paul Verlaine by Harold Nicolson Houghton Mifflin Co  This book is a dispassionate appraisal of the life and work of the greatest French symbolist poet The reader who delights in a good biography should follow step by step through his dark byways of struggle this poet of the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  shifty Mongolian eyes should apprehend his pitiful weaknesses and failures He was like other boys constitutionally although perhaps handicapped by the fact that he was the only child of parents who were already middle aged when he was born It is interesting to read of his days of schooling of how at eighteen he obtained his degree at the Sorbonne like other ordinary French schoolboys with no brilliance but quite creditably Mr Nicolson tells us that in general Verlaine s childhood had little effect upon his future development The great factor in his life was alcohol and this had not menaced him before the age of eighteen  Verlaine s life is the story of hopes and disappointments not unknown to other poets But in his case the green of absinthe spread its taint over everything He made great efforts at reform notably once when for a year the influence of his young wife kept him sober But the evil days returned invariably and he became an habitual inebriate It is hard to believe that in spite of the devils which were dragging him down his literary output did not seem to suffer and that some of his most beautiful poems were born of these times  And yet many of those which he wrote before this period have touched the human heart more poignantly than those of his maturer years indeed in the last few years of his life his work sometimes showed Symbolism gone wrong it was so steeped in intimate details as to be banal But Verlaine at his best can throw us into an   Tarnished Gold  atmosphere if he writes about a mist the hair feels wet with mist if he writes of a garden we actually inhale the warm perfume so subtly does he use intimacy suggestion association the fundamentals of Symbolism Other poetry has had these qualities from the Greeks down but as Mr Nicholson points out The Symbolists were the first to raise what had been an accidental virtue in others to the level of a doctrine for themselves And he says also Verlaine did not invent Symbolism he certainly did not direct its future development but he was able at the psychological moment to catch and reflect the floating aspiration and to give to it a definite cadence and a form  A comparatively large portion of the book is devoted to the life of Arthur Rimbaud and after reading these chapters we realize that to have given less space to the subject would have been to omit what is a valuable contribution to a true understanding of Verlaine s character Mr Nicolson has scant liking for Rimbaud and his picture of this writer is not attractive A large red fisted boy with filthy hair that hung down lank between his shoulders a snub nose and a damp fleshy mouth He regards his entrance into the life of Verlaine as the greatest influence for evil that ever came near it He tells us how Rimbaud forced himself upon Verlaine how Verlaine forced Rimbaud upon his literary intimates in Paris a very tactless performance and how he dragged him to gatherings where he behaved like the boor he was and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  from which he was promptly excluded He became linked with all his friend s doings he drank with him helped him to spend his poor mother s capital left him when there were no resources and reappeared when he found it to his profit to do so and he enticed him on the fateful and ever to be regretted trip to London  Yet the most enthusiastic followers of Rimbaud cannot accuse Mr Nicolson of having failed to estimate his work at its true value In speaking of the Bateau Ivre he calls it an astounding production  That is should be the work of a boy of sixteen is well nigh incredible In the glare of its inspiration the glib architecture of the Parnassians the cadence of Verlaine s own poetry assume but a paltry complexion No wonder that the generation of today looks for stimulus to Rimbaud rather than to Verlaine or even Mallarmé to Rimbaud who at nineteen was forever to fling literature behind him  He designates Saison en Enfer as an acid human document and speaks at length of Les Illuminations which after the former is most typical of Rimbaud s unpleasing genius Aube in this collection he considers to be as fine a prose poem as exists in any language  Mr Nicolson explains that he had hoped at first to give in an appendix a translation of the poems quoted in the text We are glad that he abandoned the plan Doubtless he if anyone could express Verlaine s poetry in English But attempts by others to render into our language even French poets more easily translated are almost sure to be disappointing few of the results rising above libretto English Mr Nicolson has decided wisely   Tarnished Gold  and it is a pleasure to find that he has given us almost all of the poems which are the most exquisite or the most characteristic in the tongue in which they were meant to exist The author says Verlaine of all poets is too elusive to admit of translation and above all of a literal translation into English prose This is what I have maintained whenever I have spoken of Verlaine s work in other articles in this magazine The peculiar music is purely an emanation of his own atmosphere perhaps more so than in the case of any other foreign poet His syncopation is of the sort to be found in no other language than his own To omit it or to try to approach its like could hardly fail to be a distortion  This whole book is carried through with a subtle yet firm and often audacious touch Scholarly it certainly is but not in the sense of that word which restricts the pedagogic mind There are a few inaccuracies the American reader will be surprised to learn that Stuart Merrill is an Englishman and there are occasional phrases which startle but these are slight flaws  The author bares Verlaine s weaknesses and gives his mitigating characteristics without a hint as to his own opinions regarding them He lays the facts before you and it is for you to conclude He tells us incidentally in the Rimbaud chapters that Verlaine had no spark of jealousy or personal ambition and that he flung himself with real generosity into the task of helping other poets Those who derive from this poet s work only an aroma of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the wine shop who picture him first of all as a vulgar sot will have a change of heart after reading this biography Paul Verlaine had noble traits he had lovable traits and these went into his poetry Agnes Lee Freer  SLAVIC POETRY  Modern Russian Poetry selected and translated by Babette Deutsch and Avrahm Yarmolinsky Harcourt Brace amp Co  Anthology of Modern Slavonic Literature translated by P Selver E P Dutton amp Co Modern Czech Poetry translated by P Selver E P Dutton amp Co  An Anthology of Jugoslav Poetry Edited by Dr B S Stanoyevich Richard G Badger The vigor and elegantly tutored violence of the Russian  ballet the drastic investigations and discoveries of Russian fiction the naive splendor of Russian painting and Russian music with its delicate French soul in a rioting body may lead you to expect in Russian poetry something equally vivid and fresh a balancing surprise You may be prepared as I was to add to the French and English the only modern literatures so far as I can discover that have a life and character of their own and enjoy the distinction of possessing masterpieces a Russian literature embodying that figment of the European imagination the Slavic Soul   Slavic Poetry  Modern Russian Poetry if approached with such expectations will bring a somewhat chilly disillusion For until the last pages there are no particularly arresting poems And the last poems while they deal with events that may be localized have fortunately no local flavor They are written in the tone and from the attitude of the modern man everywhere in the world in the same idiom and with the same ratiocination  In many ways the haunting anachronism of Russia s political machine has stalked and parried its poems One feels not only confusion but even evasion of realities Russian poets have been led to sentimentalize their attitude to the land to life to the peasantry to the misery of Russia Patriotism and Revolution trespass continually and are unpleasantly immobilized in figures of speech And too often the poets exaltation is the rapid breath of running away their simplicity the content of hasty refuge  Russian life is too tentative too provisional If stands stark in the thinking the hurdle of every decision To my mind it has been the reason for much of the mysticism Much of the pessimism and despair is also traceable to this ghastly warning To be faced continually with this lean and quick legged and always outstripping If is finally to lose hope  Alexander Blok in his wonderful Scythians repeats it Russia is undecided wavering She is between East and West between a beloved betrayer and his foe ambushed   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  by her elbow Magnificent and challenging is the poem a clue to the instability of Russian life  As this anthology reveals it we have the poetry of a troubled minor literature exceedingly rich in promise Unless it is a mere activity of sick nerves the intensity of life in Russia today should bring great poetry is bringing a hint of it in the poetry of the minute  The book may be regarded also as a fine contribution to English literature Never is one conscious that the work is a translation For the approximately one hundred and twenty Russian poems which have been rendered parallel English poems have been created  The notes are perhaps too copious They make of the book almost a guide to Russian literature with excerpts for illustration The method betrays itself most keenly when in the case of Baratynsky a closely printed paragraph of two hundred words introduces a verselet of six puny lines whose banality too impudently satirizes the expectations raised by the fattening preface  To realize that nationalism has made a great master of Pushkin is to appreciate the unhappy effects of this virtuoso emotion proud of the iridescence of stagnation Reports come that young poets are harking back to Pushkin it is pitiful with so many powerful men about them  To me the book s area of interest begins with Valery Brusov although stray poems before him paint the desert Ivanov Blok Byely Kluyev Yesenin Oreshin and Marienhof these shouting a bit strident a bit knowing   Slavic Poetry  but independent and conscious young poets are the poets of Russia The buzzing Pushkin the crooning Lermontov the ballyhooing Konstantin Balmont are the bad starts of Russian poetry  These young men write as original poets are writing in England France and America Marienhof might almost be a Russian visit of Ezra Pound  Jesus is on the Cross again and Barrabas We escort mealy mouthed down the Tverskoi Prospekt Who will interrupt who The gallop of Scythian horses Violins bowing the Marseillaise  Pile rubbish all the rubbish in a heap And like Savonarola to the sound of hymns Into the fire with it Whom should we fear When the mundiculi of puny souls have become worlds  A quatrain from Yesenin contains an image that has obsessed me From empty straths a slender arch ascending Fog curls upon the air and moss wise grows And evening low above the wan streams bending In their white waters washes his blue toes  These whispers will not give any suggestion of the full throated singing of the two poets quoted For these and their splendid company in the last half of the book redeem the whole book make it about as valuable as any book of poetry recently issued in America  Mr Selver s Anthology of Slavonic Literature attempts too much and therefore the results are negligible The job might as well not have been done To represent   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  adequately the prose of Russia Poland Bohemia Jugoslavia etc in one ordinary volume and pack in the poetry of these peoples as well is so obviously futile that it is a wonder to me that so accomplished an editor and critic tried to do it  Mr Selver s book of Czech verse is admirable however The translation flavor is sometimes on these verses but it gives an exotic aroma which makes one pleasantly aware of tasting something foreign One feels that the pre contemporary Czech poets were stronger and more robust than their brothers in Russia This little book will serve as a companion to Modern Russian Poetry although different in spirit and manner and even in format The original texts are included  Space is lacking for extracts which indeed would give scarcely a hint of the quality of some of the poetry in this book but I wish to call attention to a remarkable nationalist whose utterance has the stark obsessive simplicity of frenzy and is extraordinarily effective Pietr Bezruc whose poems are too long and continuous for quotation They are written somewhat in the sweeping manner of Whitman who has strongly influenced Czech poetry  The Stanoyevich anthology is mentioned last because it has so little affinity with the others Its title is anomalous for all the poetry given is folk song The specimens given are melodious charming but a bit one stringed and monotonous Isidor Schneider   NOTES  Mr Alfred Kreymborg author of Mushrooms Blood of Things Plays for Poem
