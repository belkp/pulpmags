mountain with a mother and son Two old believers They did all the talking  The Mother  Folks think a witch who has familiar spirits She could call up to pass a winter evening But wont should be burned at the stake or something Summoning spirits isn t Button button Who s got the button you re to understand  The Son  Mother can make a common table rear  And kick with two legs like an army mule   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The Mother  And when I ve done it what good have I done Rather than tip a table for you let me Tell you what Ralle the Sioux Control once told me He said the dead had souls but when I asked him How that could be I thought the dead were souls He broke my trance Don t that make you suspicious That there s something the dead are keeping back Yes there s something the dead are keeping back  The Son  You wouldn t want to tell him what we have  Up attic mother  The Mother  Bones a skeleton  The Son But the headboard of mother s bed is pushed Against the attic door the door is nailed It s harmless Mother hears it in the night Halting perplexed behind the barrier Of door and headboard Where it wants to get Is back into the cellar where it came from  The Mother  We ll never let them will we son We ll never  The Son It left the cellar forty years ago And carried itself like a pile of dishes Up one flight from the cellar to the kitchen Another from the kitchen to the bedroom   Another from the bedroom to the attic Right past both father and mother and neither stopped  it Father had gone upstairs mother was downstairs I was a baby I don t know where I was  The Mother  The only fault my husband found with me I went to sleep before I went to bed Especially in winter when the bed Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow The night the bones came up the cellar stairs Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me But left an open door to cool the room off So as to sort of turn me out of it I was just coming to myself enough To wonder where the cold was coming from When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar The board we had laid down to walk dry shod on When there was water in the cellar in spring Struck the hard cellar bottom And then someone Began the stairs two footsteps for each step The way a man with one leg and a crutch Or little child comes up It wasn t Toffile It wasn t anyone who could be there The bulkhead double doors were double locked And swollen tight and buried under snow The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust   And swollen tight and buried under snow It was the bones I knew them and good reason My first impulse was to get to the knob And hold the door But the bones didn t try The door they halted helpless on the landing Waiting for things to happen in their favor The faintest restless rustling ran all through them I never could have done the thing I did If the wish hadn t been too strong in me To see how they were mounted for this walk I had a vision of them put together Not like a man but like a chandelier So suddenly I flung the door wide on him A moment he stood balancing with emotion And all but lost himself A tongue of fire Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes Then he came at me with one hand outstretched The way he did in life once but this time I struck the hand off brittle on the floor And fell back from him on the floor myself The finger pieces slid in all directions Where did I see one of those pieces lately Hand me my button box it must be there  I sat up on the floor and shouted Toffile It s coming up to you It had its choice Of the door to the cellar or the hall   It took the hall door for the novelty And set off briskly for so slow a thing Still going every which way in the joints though So that it looked like lightning or a scribble From the slap I had just now given its hand I listened till it almost climbed the stairs From the hall to the only finished bedroom Before I got up to do anything Then ran and shouted Shut the bedroom door Toffile for my sake Company he said Don t make me get up I m too warm in bed So lying forward weakly on the handrail I pushed myself upstairs and in the light The kitchen had been dark I had to own I could see nothing Toffile I don t see it It s with us in the room though It s the bones What bones The cellar bones out of the grave  That made him throw his bare legs out of bed And sit up by me and take hold of me I wanted to put out the light and see If I could see it or else mow the room With our arms at the level of our knees And bring the chalk pile down I ll tell you what It s looking for another door to try The uncommonly deep snow has made him think Of his old song The Wild Colonial Boy He always used to sing along the tote road   He s after an open door to get out doors Let s trap him with an open door up attic Toffile agreed to that and sure enough Almost the moment he was given an opening The steps began to climb the attic stairs I heard them Toffile didn t seem to hear them Quick I slammed to the door and held the knob Toffile get nails I made him nail the door shut And push the headboard of the bed against it  Then we asked was there anything Up attic that we d ever want again The attic was less to us than the cellar If the bones liked the attic let them like it Let them stay in the attic When they sometimes Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed Behind the door and headboard of the bed Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter That s what I sit up in the dark to say To no one any more since Toffile died Let them stay in the attic since they went there I promised Toffile to be cruel to them For helping them be cruel once to him  The Son  We think they had a grave down in the cellar  The Mother  We know they had a grave down in the cellar   The Son  We never could find out whose bones they were  The Mother  Yes we could too son Tell the truth for once They were a man s his father killed for me I mean a man he killed instead of me The least I could do was help dig their grave We were about it one night in the cellar Son knows the story but twas not for him To tell the truth suppose the time had come Son looks surprised to see me end a lie We d kept up all these years between ourselves So as to have it ready for outsiders But tonight I don t care enough to lie I don t remember why I ever cared Toffile if he were here I don t believe Could tell you why he ever cared himself   She hadn t found the finger bone she wanted Among the buttons poured out in her lap  I verified the name next morning Toffile The rural letter box said Toffile Barre  Robert Frost   SONGS OF NIGHT  ODE TO MYSELF TRYING TO SLEEP  Draw in the threads of thought Each delicate filament Reaching into too many places Finding forgotten faces Draw in the long twisting thoughts you have sent  Strange that you lie here wondering About things that don t matter Strange that you lie here pondering And outside the raindrops patter A fog is on the town And over the river The drenched lights cross and quiver And the far harsh rumble of trams goes up and down  Once like a wind beauty swept through you Once like a small song that sings and sings Happiness crept through you Once love seemed the reason for things And once you thought Peace had come upon you   And then all came to naught  Draw in the threads of thought Each delicate filament   Quivering and bright Draw in the long twisting thoughts you have sent Cast all the tangled old dreaming and groping To the still deep Strange heart of Night Gentle forever to all grieving and hoping And sleep  IN DARKNESS  Deep in the heart of darkness I am lying Alone and still And all the winds of darkness and of silence Work their will  Blowing about me through the awful spaces Of night and death Nor all immensity can touch or thrill me To thought or breath  Deep in the heart of darkness I am dreaming Quiet alone Careless alike of tender words or cruel Even your own  BY A WINDOW  The owl and the bat Are alone in the night   What are they at  By the dead moon s light Hush How the wings of the black bat whir Oh hush for the sleepers moan and stir  The moon is bleak Like a monk in a cowl What do they seek  The bat and the owl What danger brews in the night what sin But hush for the sleepers dream within  SONG FOR A MAY NIGHT  Heigho Many mysterious things I know  I know why the moon is like a moth Do you I know why stars are many and suns  Are few I know a place where a star fell down And made a hole in the middle of town And all the people jumped in And so  Heigho  Other mysterious things I know   COLOR OF WATER  You will be the color of water Your voice will be like the wind You will go where the dust goes None will know you have sinned  None will know you are quiet  Or fluent or bound or free None will care you are nothing You will be nothing to me  Except a scarlet remembrance As if in a dream of pride A poppy had flaunted her petals One day to the sun and died  LONELY SKY AND SEA  lonely lonely sky and sea Where time is a wind that plays between Blowing the colored centuries by Tiny tragedies quaint and mean  Why are you waiting What have you heard What majestic thing have you known That you watch each other listening So long so long alone   COMRADES  Time sweeps through me like a wind Space engulfs me like a sea Time and Space are at me always They will not let me be  I am weary weary with years Troubled by immensity With eternities around me How can I be free  Marjorie Meeker  FIRST SNOW  The night was hiding a secret When it stole Through the red gates of sunset Coming so silently We heard it whispering To the bare trees  And while we wondered The white souls of the autumn leaves Came softly back Drifting drifting  Esther Louise Ruble   SONGS OF THE PLAINS  There s no hiding here in the glare of the desert If your coat is sham the sun shines through Here with the lonely things and the silence There is no crowd for saving you  When hearts love here the love lasts longer And hate leaves here a heavy scar But we with the desert s beauty of distance If you hav Our eyes have looked on Rome and Tyre  But if you come with dreams for baggage Sit with us by the cedar fire  II  The sultry sudden darkness Like some black mantle thrown From shoulders of a giant  On children left alone Falls over us and stilled with fear In dark we see in silence hear  Then rain a sudden pounding Of unformed maddened things   Pounding splashing stubborn  As vultures heavy wings That pound the air too sure to hate In hunger and move low and wait  III  Four old trees stand tall on a hill Wind swirls around them never still And their heads together bow and sway As if in talk of a game they play Sometimes they laugh and sometimes sigh And there beneath a low gray sky I ve seen them drop their leaves when thins The gold and crimson as near dawn Wise gamblers drop their cards upon The table saying kindly Why Quarrel with a game that no one wins  IV  The wood was so old that I thought I d hear it saying its prayers In the aisles like cloisters wrought  But I came on it unawares Chuckling like old men mellow grown Talking of youth on a hill alone The birds love you too Calling Sweet sweet sweet In the windy lane Where the tree tops meet  But I love you best Since my lips let pass No song lest I miss Your steps on the grass  VI  I ll go where willows quicken Their dances in the glow Of morning and the wild brooks Make music down below For I am weary seeking The things I may not know  And I shall feel the silver Of willow leaves and hold A drop of water winking With rainbows yet unsold What more may all the world find Now all its dreams are old  Glenn Ward Dresbach   TWO POEMS  I SHALL REMEMBER  Open to me the door of heaven For an hour an hour Let me pace the floor of heaven Let me pluck one flower  Forever and forever heaven Will live upon my lips I shall remember Never heaven Shall fail my seeking ships  I shall be shod and swathed with heaven Ah the blue filmy veil Because for an hour I bathed in heaven Whose winds hurt and heal  I shall remember Songs of heaven I shall sing them still Like the silver throngs of heaven I shall have heaven s will  So open to me the door of heaven For an hour an hour Let me breathe the air of heaven Let me pluck one flower   SHY PERFECT FLOWER  Shy perfect pearl white flower blooming alone In northern woods where snow has sown Its myriad seed shy perfect flower Fragrant alone Your dark leaves cluster close to hide you the more  I part them and remember bright poppies on the plain They run in the wind a ragged gypsy train They fling themselves at the feet of the golden grain When it is slain they too are slain Their life is a cry Their life is a sudden scarlet stain Their dream dark seeds have fearful power  And you shy perfect pearl white flower  Grace Fallow Norton  TO SAPPHO  Torn fragments of your woven words I read And less their throbbing cry has power to stir My passion than to soothe me to strange peace Remembering the long silence fallen on you  Julia R Reynolds   IRISH SONG  Where the highway steps along In Donegal in Donegal I gave my feet the choice o way wherever they would  roam They might have marched to Londonderry Belfast Dublin The foolish eager feet o me they marched straight home  The little gown o blue you wore In Donegal in Donegal Cried out to me Come in Come in Your apron it said  Stay  The tying o the plaid shawl across the warm heart o you Tied in along the heart o me I couldn t get away  I took off my wander shoes In Donegal in Donegal The highway stepped along alone until it slipped from  view I laid aside my dusty dreams hung up my ragged lifetime And rested feet and heart o me before the sight o you  Helen Coale Crew   ON THE WING  A wind that blows from the sea and smells Of spring and fall together Runs racing up the yellow fields Into the autumn weather  And I run too for I am young And breathless with all living The trees are shouting as we pass The asters singing in the grass  In half an hundred years from now  When all my songs are sung I ll not be old and crossly sage I ll love the bright hill of my age  Under its winter sun And wave the gayest hand I know To everything that s young  Dorothy Keeley   FOUR POEMS  I ASK FOR A FRIEND  I ask a girl for a friend a playmate Full of May blown dreams and lilac in her hair With boyish ankles intimately strange And hands forever busy with applause And mothering lash screened virgin eyes And a slim breasted body made of joy  Her coming would mean spring to my heart We d give our souls a holiday cut loose Arrange a rendezvous with Love somewhere And forget to keep it being good friends  I ask a girl for a friend a playmate Full of May blown dreams and lilac in her hair  SONNET  When Love unveiled her body to my sight And in my heart a strange unquiet grew As soft winds stir the bosom of the night And after spill their tears as drops of dew When first Love laid aside her woven dress Of silken tissued dreams and scented stuff And fastened my young eyes with loveliness Until I thought one world was scarce enough To hold such utter happiness and pain   I begged the god of love to strike me blind And seal Love s image up within my brain Queen of my thoughts the kingdom of my Mind  But when I took Love s body to my breast Her lips were bitter and her face a jest  THE FICKLE LOVER  I have made Life my mistress built temples Of song to her in my heart paraded Before her enemy Death And smiling Have kissed Life before Death s envious eyes Proud in my lust gay in my strength love wise  But often in my dreams I ve wished to touch The cool sophisticated lips of Death  COLLAPSE  As an old tree bent by ages of winds So I am tired  As an oak leaf blown out upon the sea I am lonely  As a storm conceived adventurous wave Divides before its thousand lonely deaths On alien shores My life shall end  Ernest Walsh   TABLEAUX  SCHERZO  My soul is a dancer A dancer under shimmering willows in the sunlight  The wind draws a bow across his violin He plays a scherzo Rippling notes on strings of silver  Play faster wind My feet are more swift than the leaves of the willow Shimmering shimmering Amber shadows in the sunlight My feet are more swift than the laughter of waters Play faster wind  TRYST  I will wear my gown of dusk blue silk And in my hair A crescent moon curved like a petal  From the rim of the shadowy pool I will pluck an iris Dusk blue shading to purple Faint scented as the breath of sandalwood  Softly I will come through the drooping willows   Ellen Margaret Janson  The leaves will catch at my gown Dusk blue In the purple shadows The grasses will whisper sighing As if they knew  Down at the wall I will wait alone in the darkness And close my eyes Dreaming that I hear your voice  INCENSE SMOKE  One stick I lit in the bronzen image The smoke curls upward lazily between his lips Ivory and the frail blue of shadows  The image is speaking Words of lazy dream blue smoke Carved like ivory D o you remember The priests wore dragons great jeweled dragons on their  robes They sang dreamily To the god of the dim temple Chanting chanting Through the twisted smoke of incense But the god did not stir His eyes were like opals veiled with lost mystery   The smoke curls upward drowsily Between his lips Mist gray and the amber of shadows  The image is speaking Words of dim gray gold smoke Graven like amber D o you remember The offering you burned alone at dawn To one who did not answer Across the ashes You saw the sea mist rising rising Like the smoke of incense And cried out with the pain in your heart  The smoke curls upward dreamily Between his lips Ivory and the lost blue of shadows  NIGHT IN THE CITY  I hear them pass by the wall of my garden The swift whisper of silk And laughter Tinkling like the wind bells on the shadowy terrace Tinkling and calling  Their lanterns form a necklace Of gems   Low strung across the dusk Their laughter dies away past the wall of my garden  In the willow The echo lingers The echo of laughter failing Into sudden weariness  THE UNKNOWN  I am the stir of garments that you heard Pass by you in the wood I am the lips that smile but speak no word For evil or for good  I am the voice that whispered in the long Sweet twilights of the spring I am the haunting music of the song I would not let you sing  I am the finger beckoning in the street The strife and the reward The quivering joy that stabbed you with its sweet Sharper than any sword  I am the dream that shines a light apart When other lights are spent I am the pain that grips and breaks your heart To save it from content  Ellen Margaret Janson   POEMS  WILD ORCHARD  It is a broken country the rugged land is green from end to end the autumn has not come  Embanked above the orchard the hillside is a wall of motionless green trees the grass is green and red  Five days the bare sky has stood there day and night No bird no sound Between the trees  stillness and the early morning light The apple trees are laden down with fruit  Among blue leaves the apples green and red upon one tree stand out most enshrined  Still ripe heavy spherical and close   they mark the hillside It is a formal grandeur  a stateliness a signal of finality and perfect ease Among the savage  aristocracy of rocks one risen as a tree has turned from his repose  THE LONELY STREET  School is over It is too hot to walk at ease At ease in light frocks they walk the streets to while the time away They have grown tall They hold pink flames in their right hands In white from head to foot with sidelong idle look in yellow floating stuff black sash and stockings touching their avid mouths with pink sugar on a stick like a carnation each holds in her hand they mount the lonely street   SPOUTS  In this world of as fine a pair of breasts as ever I saw the fountain in Madison Square spouts up of water a white tree that dies and lives as the rocking water in the basin turns from the stone rim back upon the jet and rising there reflectively drops down again  THE WIDOW S LAMENT IN SPRINGTIME  Sorrow is my own yard where the new grass flames as it has flamed often before but not with the cold fire that closes round me this year Thirty five years I lived with my husband   William Carlos Williams  The plum tree is white today with masses of flowers Masses of flowers load the cherry branches and color some bushes yellow and some red but the grief in my heart is stronger than they for though they were my joy formerly today I notice them and turn away forgetting Today my son told me that in the meadows at the edge of the heavy woods in the distance he saw trees of white flowers I feel that I would like to go there and fall into those flowers and sink into the marsh near them  William Carlos Williams  COMMENT  THE HOPE OF PEACE  ALL the movements of the day all the isms and schools and drives fade into insignificance compared with the movement to get rid of war This movement is not out of place in these pages in fact it is immediately the poet s business  I am tempted to repeat now an editorial from POETRY for September 1914 In the first white heat of those terrible first battles I wrote this page on The Poetry of War  Poets have made more wars than kings and war will not cease until they remove its glamour from the imaginations of men  What is the fundamental the essential and psychological cause of war The feeling in men s hearts that it is beautiful And who have created this feeling Partly it is true kings and their armies with banners but far more poets with their war songs and epics sculptors with their statues the assembled arts which have taken their orders from kings their inspiration from battles Kings and artists have united to give to war its glamour to transmute into sounds and colors and forms of beauty its savagery and horror to give heroic appeal to its unreason a heroic excuse to its rage and lust  All this is of the past The race is beginning to suspect those old ideals to give valor a wider range than war affords to seek danger not at the cannon s mouth but in less noisy labors and adventures When Nicholas of Russia and William of Germany in solemn state the other day invoked the blessing of God upon their armies the emotion that went round the world was not the old thrill but a new sardonic laughter  As Cervantes smiled Spain s chivalry away so some poet of the new era may strip the glamour from war Tolstoi s War and Peace and many lesser books are chapters of the new revelation and modern science   The Hope of Peace  modern invention have aided the race in its half conscious effort to  unveil the bitter hideousness of the war god s visage But the final  word has not been said the feeling that war is beautiful still lingers in  men s hearts a feeling founded on world old savageries love of power  of torture of murder love of big stakes in a big game This feeling must  be destroyed as it was created through the imagination It is work for  a poet  There will be a new poetry of war  The time for that poetry is now It must be written in peace for when war begins there is nothing to do but fight War is no more inevitable between nations than between individuals as duelling was outlawed long ago in all civilized states and its elaborate and long accepted code of honor relegated to the scrap heap so shall war be outlawed by the assembled nations of the world and its elaborate and long accepted code of international law become a dusty byword of history War is an absurd anachronism in this closely connected talking and trading world and modern science has made it an anachronism poisonous and murderous beyond the maddest dreams of the darkest devils of hell It must end if the white race is to preserve its numbers its supremacy its creative energy and power and the proud fabrics of its civilization  We face a war to the death on war and none can afford to be a slacker in it In this ultimate war the deadliest weapon is the germ of thought in human brains Only the poet can spawn that germ and send it flying forth by invisible millions to mature in the minds of men Cervantes wrote Don Quixote and suddenly a rotten   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  thing long ready for death was dead Let some poet or perhaps a number of poets in a number of arts stab with laughter or scorch with tears the rotten hulk of war and suddenly the world will know that war is dead  M  MUST ART BE INTERESTING  Implicitly all interesting things have beauty and the most interested person is no doubt the most esthetic Such a thesis is not hard to support on the ground that interest can relate only to things of immediate worth and beauty But to travel from this rather nervous doctrine of values to the position that beauty is determined by the interest it arouses is another and more complex matter Though Ford Madox Hueffer in his recent Thus to Revisit reiterates charmingly and with convincing disregard for the logical responsibilities of his theme that art must be interesting the shadow of an unsolved problem rather obscures the result He rests his proposition it is true on human impulse not on philosophical consideration but the question is not easily confined In that speculative periphery of art where beauty dissolves into metaphysics no problem is more persistent  As a weapon against the absolutism in art which makes no compromise with the public taste the book will be effective It undermines this stern and puritan dogma with the suggestion that final values in art as well as in other fields of human experience lie after all in human   Must Art be Interesting  nature itself It abandons the rigorous heaven reserved by the absolutists for the saved few and returns frankly to popular interest for its standard To their ascetic practice in casting off mundane and popular interests it can oppose the Protagorean formula Man is the measure of all things But in liberating art from these moralisms Mr Hueffer imposes another moralism in his repeated dictum Art must be interesting Why after all must these highly complex things art and interest always be associated That interesting things as a matter of descriptive fact are in a measure beautiful does not imply that art as a matter of moral or artistic imperative must be interesting Mr Hueffer rather increases than diminishes the speculative difficulties and enticements of the problem  Overburdened beauty carries many theories on its back All of them from absolutist to pragmatist aim in some way to find a functional value of beauty in the social system The mere act of erecting a rational theory about it indicates an effort to organize beauty into a system of human relationships There remains to remark no doubt that beauty is not a theory that it is not subject to theorizing that it needs and possesses no justification in the social order But that too in its way is incorrect In this field rich with questions Mr Hueffer s interesting book quite appropriately asks what it cannot answer  Baker Brownell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVIEWS  A SYMPOSIUM ON MARIANNE MOORE  Poems by Marianne Moore Egoist Press London  Such contrary opinions of this provocative little pamphlet have reached us that perhaps the most suggestive review will be a more or less questioning rehearsal of them Miss Moore s steely and recondite art has long been a rallying point for the radicals Although her first appearance was in POETRY in May 1915 most of the entries in these twenty four closely printed pages date from Others and The Egoist a few from The Dial and Contact Rumor has hinted that the selection and publication were made by certain friends of the author without her knowledge  If one were to accept the challenge of the title and of the geometrical verse designs which frame these cryptic observations one might be led straight to the ancient and rather futile inquiry What is poetry Poetry is evidently a matter of individual definition H D surely a critic of authority calls Miss Moore a poet and a number of young radicals are eager to pronounce her a very great poet as Yvor Winters did in a recent letter With the exception of Wallace Stevens he wrote she is about the only person since Rimbaud who has had any very profound or intricate knowledge and command of sound and I am not sure but I think her about the best poet in this country except for Mr Stevens   A Symposium on Marianne Moore  A more moderate admirer Miss Winifred Bryher sends  us the following estimate from England  This volume is the study of a Marco Polo detained at home It is the fretting of a wish against wish until the self is drawn not into a world of air and adventure but into a narrower self patient dutiful and precise Those Various Scalpels is sharper than a diamond It is as brilliant a poem as any written of late years and yet it is but a play with the outside of substances and the inside of thoughts too tired to feel emotion And Dock Rats again or England are wrought as finely as the old Egyptians wrought figures from an inch high piece of emerald but they lack the one experience of life for which life was created  The temperament behind the words is not a passive one however much environment may have forced meditation upon it as a form of protective coloration The spirit is robust that of a man with facts and countries to discover and not that of a woman sewing at tapestries But something has come between the free spirit and its desire a psychological uneasiness that is expressed in these few perfect but static studies of a highly evolved intellect  Technically it is a triumphant book There are scenes which are a joy to remember the shifting color of  wade through black jade of the crow blue mussel shells  And the vivid beauty of The Talisman  Under a splintered mast torn from ship and cast near her hull  a stumbling shepherd found embedded in the ground a sea gull  of lapis lazuli a scarab of the sea with wings spread   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  curling its coral feet parting its beak to greet men long dead  Miss Moore has preferred to date to express simply the pictorial aspect of the universe and she has fulfilled perfectly each self imposed task Her Poems are an important addition to American literature to the entire literature of the modern world Only Marco Polo your sword is ready and your kingdoms wait May it soon please you to leave the fireside and ride forth  But Miss Moore s admirers don t have it all their own  way Here is the point of view of one of POETRY S  associate editors Marion Strobel  Even a gymnast should have grace If we find ourselves one of an audience in a side show we prefer to see the well muscled lady in tights stand on her head smilingly with a certain nonchalance rather than grit her teeth perspire and make us conscious of her neck muscles Still we would rather not see her at all  Just so we would rather not follow the contortions of Miss Moore s well developed mind she makes us so conscious of her knowledge And because we are conscious that she has brains that she is exceedingly well informed we are the more irritated that she has not learned to write with simplicity  The subject matter of her poems is inevitably dry the manner of expression pedantic She shouts at our stupidity Literature is a phase of life Words are constructive when they are true the opaque allusion the simulated flight upward accomplishes nothing And we yawn back at Miss Moore s omniscience  And another poet critic Pearl Andelson says  Marianne Moore has much the Emily Dickinson type of mind but where Emily Dickinson s not infrequent obscurities arise out of an authentic mysticism Marianne Moore s are more likely the result of a relentless discipline in the subtler ologies and osophies She is brilliant at times to the point of gaudiness although one feels that in   her brilliance she is most herself As to form the fact that she wavers between prose and poetry is not disguised by the breath taking line formation Indeed I should say the incongruous effect was heightened rather than diminished by occasional rhyming The same for the most part may be said of content as of form Such poems as Picking and Choosing and Poetry are hybrids of a flagrantly prose origin  Well let us turn to the book without prejudice one way or the other In the first place the lady is delightfully independent she says in Black Earth  Openly yes  with the naturalness of the hippopotamus or the alligator when it climbs out on the bank to experience the  sun I do these  things which I do which please no one but myself Now I breathe and now I am submerged the blemishes stand up and shout when the object  in view was a  renaissance shall I say the contrary The sediment of the river which encrusts my joints makes me very gray but I am used  to it it may  remain there do away with it and I am myself done away with for the patina of circumstance can but enrich what was  there to begin  with This elephant skin which I inhabit fibred over like the shell of the cocoanut this piece of black glass through which no light  can filter cut  into checkers by rut upon rut of unpreventable experience it is a manual for the peanut tongued and the   hairy toed Black but beautiful my back  is full of the history of power Of power What  is powerful and what is not My soul shall never  be cut into by a wooden spear And so on for about forty more lines which develop and elaborate the elephantine symbol and then drop it as it were in mid career with a quizzical trunk flourish As Black Earth is admirably representative of its author s thought and style it may serve as the text for a few inquiries Meditative self confession is no novelty in English poetry we have countless examples in as many different patterns Hamlet s soliloquies Gray s Elegy Pope s Essay on Man Byron s Childe Harold Whitman s Song of Myself many sonnets by Milton Wordsworth Keats and other supreme sonneteers these are but a few of the numerous high precedents in English poetry for more or less imaginative and more or less metrical meditation And one may not deny imaginative power to the mind which can create and round out and energize so effectively the grotesque image which appears when she holds up the mirror to her soul Neither may one refuse any poet the right to attempt new metrical patterns since only through such attempts does any achievement become possible any enrichment of the English prosodic scheme So it remains to attempt to estimate the validity of Miss Moore s processes and the degree of her achievement   Unquestionably there is a poet within the hard deliberately patterned crust of such soliloquies as Black Earth Those Various Scalpels Pedantic Literalist Reinforcements almost any of these titles though a poet too sternly controlled by a stiffly geometrical intellectuality Miss Moore is in terror of her Pegasus she knows of what sentimental excesses that unruly steed is capable and so her ironic mind harnesses down his wings and her iron hand holds a stiff rein This mood yields prose oftener than poetry but it wrings out now and then the reluctant beauty of a grotesque or even more rarely such a lyric as Talisman  No amount of line patterning can make anything but statement and argument out of many of the entries in this book for example Picking and Choosing which begins  Literature is a phase of life if one is afraid of it the situation is irremediable if one approaches it familiarly what one says of it is worthless Words are constructive when they are true the opaque illusion the simulated flight  upward accomplishes nothing Why cloud the fact that Shaw is self conscious in the field of sentiment but is otherwise rewarding that James is all that has been said of him but is not profound It is not Hardy the distinguished novelist and Hardy the poet but one man  interpreting life through the medium of the emotions  If the mood instinctively flouts the muse what of the method If the mood may rarely yield more than the   hard reluctant beauty of a grotesque is the method inevitable and right fitting words musically magically to the motive as in all the masterpieces of the art Well let me confess that I do not find the divine shapeliness and sound richness which Mr Winters referred to in his letter What I do find in certain poems is a brilliant array of subtly discordant harmonies not unlike those of certain ultra modern composers set forth in stanza forms purely empirical even when emphasized by rhyme forms which impose themselves arbitrarily upon word structure and sentence structure instead of accepting happily the limitations of the art s materials as all art must When Miss Moore uses the first syllable of accident as a whole line to rhyme with lack or the article a as a line to rhyme with the end of Persia when she ends a stanza in a split infinitive or in the middle of the swift word very indeed anywhere in the middle of words or sentences she is forcing her pattern upon materials which naturally reject it she is giving a wry twist even though her aim is a grotesque and when her aim is more serious such verbal whimsicalities strike at once the intensely false note of affectation And as she takes her own way in these details of style so she gives little heed to the more general laws of shapeliness each poem begins as it ends and ends as it begins a coruscating succession of ideas with little curve of growth or climax  What I do find throughout this book is wit wit fundamental and instinctive which expresses itself not   only in words phrases rhymes rhythms but in ideas emotions The grim and haughty humor of this lady strikes deep so deep as to absorb her dreams and possess her soul She feels immense incongruities and the incongruity of her little ego among them moves her art not to grandeur but to scorn As a satirist she is at times almost sublime what contrary devil balks her even at those moments tempting her art to its most inscrutable perversities  Youth is sometimes penetrating in self diagnosis am tempted to recall the first poem Miss Moore ever published That Harp You Play So Well from the 1915 group in POETRY  David if I had  Your power I should be glad In harping with the sling In patient reasoning  Blake Homer Job and you  Have made old wine skins new Your energies have wrought Stout continents of thought  But David if the heart  Be brass what boots the art Of exorcising wrong Of harping to a song  The sceptre and the ring  And every royal thing Will fail Grief s lustiness Must cure the harp s distress  I f the heart be brass every royal thing will fail   It is not this reviewer who says that or invokes for this poet grief s lustiness May even grief soften a heart of brass And is a deep resistless humor like Miss Moore s the most subtly corrosive destroyer of greatness  M  A MYSTIC WARRIOR  The Mystic Warrior by James Oppenheim A A Knopf  We might count as art every cross country flyer cutting its shriek into a black sky or a blue sky every sky scraper flinging windows light smoke into an incredulous sky every unimpeachable bath room trinity the giant torsos of boilers and bellies of gas tanks the bird like or fish like aeroplane the architecture of the farm silo granary and barn or for the matter of that the fields of grain themselves the vain prodigal orchards It is in the air to do this Out of such industrial shapes men are making violent tragic comic drama ruled as in art by the mathematics of the elements So the analogy is close and tempting and we can point that way to America as rich in self expression Or we may follow another trend of fashion an import out of French dadaism or a mood synchronous with it and abandon the word art altogether as an obsolete and paupered notion A composer of genius was recently heard to bandy the idea of an anti art society where he said lightly but seriously any artist of consequence belonged Ben Hecht in his first work of size follows his apparently biographic hero to say it is not   art he wants art is something he can spit out in conversation In a foreword to an exhibition of his photographs Alfred Stieglitz formally junks the word along with a number of abstractions Yet it was a word concrete enough to artists not so long dead either Cezanne Degas Rodin Whistler to whom the living still pay homage  People may be wiped from the face of the earth but art is  And there are still those who echo this as a hard truth in whose eyes even the machine has been unable to break the essential sequence of things They have need of this word to name the one human reality running so close to all reality as to far outstrip that vanity self expression as to make shapes more intentional more delicate more potent than any American industry has yet made In the pages of The Mystic Warrior an analysis of himself James Oppenheim writes himself down as one of these His sense of the relentless absolutes of art his denial of himself as an absolute instil this poem with a deep candor a kind of darkened tranquillity virtues rare enough today to mean in themselves distinction  The artist finally the artist  America shuns him cutting herself off from her own greatness But he comes nevertheless he is Walt riding on top a bus and Poe dreaming of stars in a cottage with his wife dying And Emerson absent minded minded of the Oversoul in Concord woods And Hawthorne moody in sad Puritanism   And Mark Twain smoking cigars in bed sweating and groaning over Huckleberry Finn And giant like tearful Dreiser and Sandburg sitting in a newspaper  office And Vachel Lindsay jazzing in Paradise or is it Springfield Illinois And Masters among all souls in strange Spoon River  So I speak for the artist But also I speak for the multitude like myself with equal struggles and  the same yearnings The same sorrows joys and lamenting But no gift inarticulate frustrated America s victims  There is the argument in the unfolding of which perhaps Oppenheim does not quite go the length of candor For his indecisions and his failures he can t resist blaming America more than the mere fact that the inevitable image word phrase come seldom to him You enjoy the drift of the book but you have to ignore more than one lapse of taste that unerring instinct for the word and the place Perhaps too breathless an awe has sometimes defeated him There is a hint of this in the picture of a meeting with our most powerful novelist Theodore Dreiser one is led to suppose  So we walk we talk And here is the Hudson the North River with shouting gold of sunset  and smokes of the tugboats Shadows of cliffs like the spacious threshold of a spiritual universe And I grow tense with the wonder of it and feel the artist s despair of  setting it down in words So I turn to him Just look I say could you describe that He speaks carelessly Oh yes that or anything   A Mystic Warrior  Yet this reverence for great vision great craft has had its reward the reward of concentration workmanship If this writer were a house painter you might not always like the colors he mixed but his surfaces his finish would be scrupulous So The Mystic Warrior contains pictures indelible pictures snatches of rhythm voices pictures of childhood in New York schools and brownstone houses pictures of a death and a funeral  I am a tailor I am cutting and sewing a pair of pants for my little brother  My little grandmother comes in walks softly inaudibly by me   She carefully pulls down the shades making the room yellow   I confront her Why do you pull down the shades grandma  She says there is too much sunlight Then she looks at me hesitates takes me by the arm Whispers in my ears James your father is dead  I smell flowers lilies roses violets I shall never forget that smell I am taken down in the long parlor There are people there uncles and aunts grandpa grandma There are camp stools and a black cloth coffin smothered in flowers   And now my infancy is ended For this is death I have come face to face with my enemy death   Servant girls soothed me saying He is an angel now   Vivid portraits of people pictures of offices wharves homes pictures of a Jewish bourgeoisie in New York redolent of the race recalling the riches Rembrandt made of the same theme in Amsterdam centuries ago and the breath of countless streets Old days on the West Side   Old nights Summer nights when there was a faint Coney Island stir down electric lit Eighth Avenue A moth stir flame shadow Bagdad  There is unction in The Mystic Warrior but almost no sham no bunk At its best the tenor of it is curiously dark and steady a suggestion of slow night rain or a ship at anchor in night waters The poem succeeds in being a distillation in contrast to the brew made it seems after the recipe T o hell with work novelty will provide the kick Oppenheim you feel has earned the right to say  In the grey air we walk in the glister of the dying year And my soul goes down to roots and the roots like a tree s are deep in the earth  Acknowledging this you are even willing to ignore the abstract use of the word soul Dorothy Dudley  MRS WYLIE s POEMS  Nets to Catch the Wind by Elinor Wylie Harcourt  Brace amp Co  A lyric voice slight but clear and fine may be heard in this book the voice of a free and lightly ranging spirit The sound of it is now gay now grave but always it holds a little aloof one detects that something austere immaculate for which the poet herself holds her Puritan ancestry responsible In a number of poems her mood is thoughtfully admonitory as The Eagle and the Mole Madman s Song or Say Not of Beauty she is Good   Oh she is neither good nor bad But innocent and wild Enshrine her and she dies who had The hard heart of a child  Again it is meditative or descriptive or as in Valentine self searching But always the emotion is shy and delicate as of a cool small wild flower growing by some whim of Nature not in the woods but in the protected area of a garden The flower is very simple and of quiet color but it has an individual vitality nevertheless  The Eagle and the Mole urging toward the high or the profound as against a safe middle of the road policy is perhaps the most temptingly quotable poem in the book But as it has already gone the rounds and as POETRY has printed Velvet Shoes and certain others we prefer to offer The Prinkin Leddie as an example of pure and irresistible gayety a mood extremely rare in modern art  The Hielan lassies are a for spinnin The Lowlan lassies for prinkin and pinnin My daddie w u d chide me an so w u d my minnie If I s u d bring hame sic a prinkin leddie  Now haud your tongue ye haverin coward For whilst I m young I ll go flounced an flowered In lutestring striped like the strings o a fiddle Wi gowden girdles aboot my middle  My silks are stiff wi patterns o siller I ve an ermine hood like the hat o a miller I ve chains o coral like rowan berries An a cramoisie mantle that cam frae Paris   When the skies are low an the earth is frozen Ye ll be gay an gled for the leddie ye ve chosen When ower the snow I go prinkin and prancin In my wee red slippers were made for dancin  It s better a leddie like Solomon s lily Than one that ll run like a Hielan gillie A linkin it ower the leas my laddie In a raggedy kilt an a belted plaidie  An unusually interesting first book M  THOUGHTFUL MEASURES  Out of Mist by Florence Kilpatrick Mixter Boni amp Liveright Carefully studied delicately wrought are these poems  this sequence of twenty nine sonnets followed by as many other poems If they are in a sense too studied and deliberate they yet express genuine emotion in grave and thoughtful measures of modern straightness and simplicity there is no pretense in the feeling and rarely a trace of rhetoric or palaver in the style The best of them rise to a quiet beauty and distinction Lullaby which was in POETRY last summer is a fine lyric and this one To a Young Girl is almost as quotable though the word holocaust is a bit melodramatic  I had forgotten there were hearts so young As yours tonight Whose voice now echoing with songs unsung Fills me with strange delight I had forgotten there were eyes so swift Of April mirth   Flashing as though with some invisible gift From Heaven to Earth  I had forgotten there were lips that pray Like a gray winged dove For one more hour of laughter and of play Before the holocaust of love  The sonnet sequence hints at the story of a youthful love affair finished by autocratic death We follow it a little apart watching out of mist through translucent veils an experience not unusual not strongly individualized but for that very reason of wide appeal Many a first love story appears here in thoughtful reminiscence its joy and sadness real but softened by time and change In sonnet XXVII we have the climax of it  In memory I sit beside your bed  And see again the smile that lit your face  Nor do the slow forgetful years erase A syllable of those last words we said  For through my tears seeing your brightness fled  Because of them I pled with Heaven for grace To make you smile once more while with quick pace  I heard night passing that would leave you dead  Swiftly I took your hand and held it tight Then told in words that choked me ever after Some foolish trifling thing And though the light That came with your brave laugh was gone thereafter Yet as a rocket fills the quiet night With falling stars I hear again your laughter  Cradle Song Dressing Up Elegy and The Candle use  the familiar four line measure to present emotions of flower like grace M OUR CONTEMPORARIES  NEW INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINES  Three magazines which aim at international authority and circulation send us their first numbers from Rome London and New York All three appear in a luxury of format and typography more easily attained abroad than here attainable here indeed only at a cost so high as to be almost prohibitive We have first The Broom described as an international magazine of the arts published by Americans in Italy at 18 Trinita dei Monti and edited by Harold A Loeb and Alfred Kreymborg with Giuseppe Prezzolini as associate editor second Fanfare a musical causerie issued on the first and fifteenth of the month edited by Leigh Henry and published by Goodwin amp Tabb Ltd at 34 Percy Street London and third we have the resuscitated Little Review issued as a seven dollar a year quarterly of arts and letters in an initial autumn number from 27 West Eighth Street New York the administration consisting of Margaret Anderson jh Ezra Pound and Francis Picabia  In The Broom Alfred Kreymborg shows once more his ability as an editor but the new paper does not start something nor arouse the excitement of anticipation to the degree that the first number of Others did in July 1915 There is much variety in the contents which range from   a strictly correct sonnet by Walter de la Mare to phantasmagoric designs in black and white and gray from paintings in the most approved cubistic manner by Albert Gleizes and Juan Gris  We see many familiar names among the fifteen or so literary contributors Lew Sarett has a Maple sugar Song of the Chippewas Amy Lowell offers a three page chant in praise of Lilacs  Your great puffs of flowers Are everywhere in this my New England Lola Ridge sings of Hospital Nights Wallace Gould offers a prose poem narrative about Marnia The only other verse entries are some Chinese poems of J Wing translated by E Powys Mathers and a twelve line rhymed poem Lake by Bayard Boyeson which opens the number Other poets appear in prose James Stephens with a tragic Dublin story Hunger as ruthless and terrible in its deliberate detail as the title implies James Oppenheim with a quite wonderful study of a sanely insane mind Haniel Long with a whimsical sketch Conrad Aiken Louis Untermeyer and Emmy Sanders offer certain critical inquiries concerning poets and their art and the invasion of Europe by America In short almost everyone appears except the over modest Mr Kreymborg The magazine has a beautifully printed page about five by seven inches set sumptuously in hand made large paper measuring nearly nine by thirteen   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Fanfare which is primarily musical blows a gay trumpet  as it enters  Fanfare does not the word suggest something stirring brilliant joyous exciting something which preludes adventure We are the heralds of the new era sounding the fanfare for its union with new beauty Such union calls for revelry hence our Fanfare will be merry We set forth boldly our trumpets bright to reflect sunlight our Fanfare ringing truly alike for ritual ceremony battle joust forlorn hope festival triumph or masquerade  This paper although a musical periodical believes like POETRY in a closer alliance of the arts Its editor thinks that musicians are too narrowly trained therefore  Fanfare will deal with literature drama painting sculpture and theatre craft as matters a knowledge of which forms a necessary complement to musical culture  So we have two or three clever drawings and a poem by John Gould Fletcher among the musical entries within the gaily decorative cover of Fanfare s first number  The Little Review is larger than of yore an hundred and twelve pages measuring more than seven inches by nine It aims at the very latest thing and achieves as its piece de resistance a fifty page poem by Jean Cocteau translated by Jean Hugo The Cape of Good Hope Having read half of it and being still in a state of innocence I commend the rest to those who can watch the dangerous hallucinations continue  On the way to Cocteau we have Ezra Pound on Bran cusi illustrated some Fumigations by Picabia a phi   losophy of Psycho democracy set forth by Mina Loy poems in French by Paul Morand and in German by Ivan Goll Also there are some rather outspoken tales and Ezra Pound tells us all of our sins in a Historical Survey  It is said that Mr Pound readopted The Little Review because of its editor s brave fight against the suppression of James Joyce s Ulysses Well it was a brave fight any fight against the censor s gag laden fist takes bravery The trouble is The Little Review never knows when to stop Just now it seems to be headed straight toward Dada but we could forgive even that if it would drop Else von Freytag Loringhoven on the way  VARIOUS PRIZES  The Dial s first award of its annual prize of two thousand dollars for one of its contributors was announced December first It goes to Sherwood Anderson of Chicago the distinguished author of a number of novels and short stories and of Mid American Chants poems in free verse of which a group first appeared in POETRY for September  1917  This is the most generous literary prize as yet awarded in this country an admirable example which should have a train of followers Although Mr Anderson s contributions to The Dial have been in prose his being a poet as well gives POETRY the opportunity to congratulate him   and also the staff of the magazine which honors him The Poetry Society of America announces the award of two prizes each of five hundred dollars  First the prize offered for the best book of verse by an American poet published in the United States during the year 1920 is divided equally between Heavens and Earth by Stephen Vincent Benet and Smoke and Steel by Carl Sandburg The judges were Richard Le Gal lienne William Lyon Phelps and Harriet Monroe  Second the prize offered in the William Lindsey Contest for poetic drama has been awarded to Harry Lee for his four act play Il Poverello One hundred and forty five plays were submitted and the judges were Stuart Walker George Arliss George P Baker Jane Dransfield and Jessie B Rittenhouse  The Friday Club of Chicago at a recent meeting of its board of directors voted fifty dollars to POETRY as a prize for a young poet for the current year  This gift is acknowledged with special pleasure as it is the first offer of the kind which POETRY has received from any women s club or indeed from any society A number of clubs in Chicago and elsewhere have given annual prizes to painters sculptors and perhaps musicians we hope that the Friday Club s example will remind them that prizes to poets being excessively rare should have the preference from clubs largely devoted as most of them are to the study of literature  CORRESPONDENCE  A LETTER FROM PARIS  My Dear POETRY Interest in American letters seems to be increasing in France As one evidence note that the program required for the English teaching certificate contains Frost s North of Boston This is due to M Charles Cestre the well known professor of American literature at the Sorbonne I consider it a bold step to admit in University studies a quite modern poet whose genius has not yet been fully acknowledged by our critics  French verse is still a matter of discussion Yet Paul Valery seems to attract partisans from sundry corners La lune mince verse une lueur sacree Toute une jupe d un tissu d argent 1eger Sur les bases de marbre ou vient l ombre songer Que suit d un char de perles une gaze nacree  A scintillating symphony of vowels and a modern rendering of an old romantic theme Valery and a few other poets have united to form a New Pleiade The original French Pleiade you remember was formed at a moment when the French language needed clarification and enriching What seems to be the aim of the actual Pleiade The names of the members will speak for themselves Countess Mathieu de Noailles Pierre Camo Derennes Gasquet de Magallon Mazade Valery all artists of classical or semi classical verse It is a protest against the extremist and cryptic schools of art The   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Countess is a great favorite among women tender youths priests if I dare trust a friend s testimony and bourgeois readers in whose ears still lingers the flowing cadence of our traditional verse Camo writes finely chiselled sonnets and odes in which the modern notes blend exquisitely with fading reminiscences Gasquet was a fiery artist of the South whose experiments in polyphonic stanzas together with alexandrines have just been cut short by death Our poetical tradition has definitely acquired a pliancy which not even the attempts at classic tragedy of the official Comedie Francaise are able to endanger Even Max Jacob the sweet child of humor who keeps apart from any coterie with his bons mots and new faith even Max Jacob writes exquisitely modulated alexandrines You see that our extremists Dada excepted but who knows what they mean not even Ezra Pound display a certain coquetry towards our well ordered muse  Le ciel a pour la mer des regards qui benissent Le soleil sur la mer est un bateau qui glisse Chaque lame a son or chaque ecume a sa nuit   What do you think of this gold and black up to date fabric  Every wave has its gold every foam has its night  More robust and more thoughtful has become the muse of Vildrac and of Romains The Chants du Desespere by Charles Vildrac ring with the sorrow of the poet s bruised dreams Vildrac bends over the corpse of his friend a   A Letter from Paris  victim of the war he turns his clear eyes on his suffering fellow men he sees more ugliness than before  Jules Romains Le Voyage des Amants seems to remain more true to his former philosophy A smiling fancy direct sensations of Paris and the world with sometimes a cosmic vista  Les jours grandissent Chaque jour est un coup plus dur Porte plus profond dans la nuit Et la matiere des tonebres Tantot molle tantot cassante Se pulverise ou s aplatit  The art of the New Pleiade and of the Unanimists make this a great epoch for French poetry Alas that it should not also be glorious for the French drama But here we have to deplore that our official theatres leave to private and too little moneyed initiative the production of new vigorous and audacious plays The Comedie Frangaise practically gave nothing worth mentioning apart from the classical repertoire La Mort Enchaine e by Maurice Magre has won a prize of a few thousand francs for the best new play and it is grievously accurate that this heavy and obscure mythological drama was merely one of the passable novelties of the Comedie As for the Odeon we feel sure that the new play by Paul Fort is going to make up for the stuff that has been produced there in the course of the few past months But of course we have our secondary stages the Vieux Colombier the Theatre des Arts and we have the Group of the Six   I shall have occasion to write you about this young group of Six Musicians and about Jean Cocteau as a poet Let me say now that Les Maries de la Tour Eiffel played at the finest and most comfortable theatre in Paris the Champs Elysees before a smart audience and a good number of buoyantly hostile traditionalists has not proved a failure It is a farce mimed by dancers for actors while a phonograph explains in the words of Cocteau the progress of the plot A nervous cerebral music with here and there patches of sunlight has been composed by the Six It is a healthy combination of sound color and gesture with no human voice which may be deplored but at least with nothing of the thundering declamation of too many comedians Jean Catel NOTES  Mr Robert Frost has recently accepted an invitation

seven poems from our January number  The varied interest and beauty presented are typical of POETRY S quality Thanks to a rare coincidence of poise and generous imagination of sense and sensitiveness it ranks as easily the best vehicle of poetry in the English language  In the London Times of Nov 25th 1920 we read  We need not linger over the many English and French contributors to this periodical We do have to note that it has published as it honestly claims much of the best experimental poetry written by Americans in the past eight years They have succeeded in their primary design to create a poetry which should be American in thought feeling subject and form That is after all a distinct achievement  The Chicago Evening Post in commenting on POETRY S eighth birthday said  No editorship is infallible but it is rather interesting and enlightening to look over the old numbers of POETRY and to realize that the first important chance for publication in America was given to many poets almost unknown who have since obtained fame We wonder how many more may yet be helped POETRY is so far as we know unique in the length of its life recognized position and rigorously artistic standard  POETRY
