I am companioned Miracle most strange By youth And its high dreams  West with the sun  From rim to rim And then  Beyond ken   Tired miles of trails On sod fresh trod  So new The billows of your grass So new Your breezes born each morn  But old so old The ghosts that pass  HOPI SONG OF THE DESERT  You are so beautiful Like the face of Ta wa wis ni mi  I cannot speak the words To tell of your too much beauty You the desert You the going down of the sun You my beloved  If I could hold you If I could touch you But you flee from me As runs the deer  You are so beautiful If only my song Could tell of your beauty   YUCCA IS YELLOWING  Yucca is yellowing Hello yellow Cactus is crimsoning Glow glow red fellow And in the mesquite bush is seen A splash of green  As when sunset colors spill Their beauty down an evening hill  No one rides the trail today Who cares if strange or lonely No one goes the desert way  It is for beauty only  BAREBACK  The winds ride bareback Swinging lassos  Their reins hang loose Their knees cling tight  The trees bend down Behind rides the rain   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  RAIN IN THE HILLS  Were I the rain Coming over the hills  I should be glad That my cool fingers could ease the little fevers of dusty water holes And caress curled leaves of the cottonwoods  The herd Pawing bellowing would let me quiet them Standing in fresh pools by dusty water holes  If I were the rain Coming over the hills  NAVAJO  Your desert land is An old squaw Mumbling old words Beside dead embers of old thoughts  What she has told you Is not told to me Though I ask  Your desert land is Coyote   William H Simpson  Running alongside white horses As the wolves howl  What it has found out running Is not told to me Though I ask  TEWA SONG  Above the lands Above the seas You see you know All mysteries  Sun Old Man Moon Old Man  Would I could fly On widespread wing Where whirlpools are And flame tips sing  Sun Old Man Moon Old Man  Die in the sea And rise at morn Thus would I go And thus be born  Sun Old Man Moon Old Man   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  DESERT NIGHT  June moon of the desert Sailing low The ways are free Where God s fleets go  The palo verde You silver tip The mesquite leaves With your ghost glow drip  Deep down in furrows Of wind plowed hills You shine and their glory Overspills  MAÑANA  Si si señor Should one ask what for This slumbering When day is on the wing  There is roof overhead On the table bread On the vine Grapes for new wine Burros two And querida mia you   William H Simpson  Tomorrow Why trouble borrow  BURRO LOADS  What do you carry O burros gray Heaped high with loads at break of day  Pinyon for fires when days are cold And old men shiver so cold so old  Pinyon for fires when coals are red And brown skinned bodies are blanketed  Pinyon for fires like a crimson rose Flaming in camps by the early snows  Paisano nina or señor bold Light for their souls as bells are tolled  LANDSCAPE  Quiet of November waters White in the twilight A narrow rippled ribbon thrown carelessly by anybody  across faded fields  Troubled March waters Black in the noonshine In curves pushing against the late snows tumbling them  in   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TREES  You root deep And reach skyward  Something you say to me That is under the earth Something you say to me That is over the earth  What it is Perhaps the closed eyes know What it is Maybe the folded wings know  COUNTRY NIGHT  Night you have soft fur And it is black I hear you purr purr  Night you fly to my door A tired raven From the world quarters four  Is your nest in the hedge By the road Or on the moon s edge  Night you are a sleepy girl Arms around my neck Your dark hair in a whirl   William H Simpson  INARTICULATE  O dumbness of tree  And of sod You can say so little to me So much to God  SO LITTLE YOU ARE  I  O Earth  So little you are  In the whirl of all worlds  Through the long cold  And the long night  I marvel That the tips of the sun flames Find you Across wide ways of the dark  Or is it That life May come from its hiding  II  O loved one  So little you are  In the swirl of all souls  Through the long days  Through the long years   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I wonder  That the flames of my longing  Find you  Across wide ways of desire  Or is it  That life  May come from its hiding  DE NOCHE  O mother of all the dark  Draw near on tiptoe  Blindfold me and say  Go to sleep to sleep to sleep  If only the hills of the night would stay in their steadfast  places Bulging bulk of the hulk of the range They creep like a she panther to where I rest in the  valley They come down tumbling to where I lie on the pine boughs  The river runs away The aspens by the runaway river are afraid  THE TRAIL UP SKY  Too soon Fades that last whiteness of the moon   William H Simpson  The face of noon is wrinkled old Like Pablo s of the sheepfold Who has seen all youth go by On the long trail up sky  Evening waits At her turquoise gates To fondle us And sing and sing With croon of mothering  We ask not whither Ask not why On the long trail up sky  CAMPO SANTO  Ines Anita Tomas Jose I sup with you on my pilgrim way  Craving the stillness of dobe walls And earth floors trod by soft footfalls  Yon campo santo is earthen too Room in it for me and room for you  Little earth homes for the weary all Who seek their sleep by the earthy wall  William H Simpson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ON THE ROAD  PROMENADING  As I went down to Baldwin s Pond The mud hens dove from sight And then like corks bobbed bravely up And paddled with delight  Oh green blade rushes fringed the pool Eye lashes delicate The waters were as calm as though A seer should gaze on fate  And reed birds piping holy notes Inspired me with such faith That I walked on the shining pond As though I were a wraith  Yes hand in hand with whitest flowers M y heart beat mad and high I went a walking it was spring With lilies on the sky  THE SCISSOR GRINDER  The scissor man tramped into town Ding a dong ding a dong He set his little grindstone down and to its music hummed a song   Carlyle Mclntyre  Old Grandma Dumpkins scissor shears he edged their blades so finely That she cut off her children s ears and made them sing divinely  And Gaffer Smither s pruning hook he whetted to such keenness That Gaffer trimmed the town and took the shade away for meanness  But furthermore the butcher s knife he rounded off so dully That cattle now enjoy their life and fill the milkpails fully  Then ding a dong ding a dong I saw his red hat top the hill But all night long I heard his song played by his brother watermill  THE VISIT  My latch was lifted a tall light crept in His wings were bleeding and his feet were sore His eyes were vacant as a wind swept moor Most pitiful of glorious cherubim I fed him as I thought an angel must Be weary from a way so long and hard I bathed his feet and balmed his wings with nard Then sat before him nibbling my poor crust   Oh are you Death I asked him I am Faith Then shall I be exalted Nay brought low What shall I have for he had risen to go T o prove I have not succored a fell wraith You shall have doubt and bitterness he said And hence it is that I am worse than dead  Carlyle Mclntyre  TWO POEMS  I HAVE WAITED FOR YOU LONG  I have waited for you long the sun withdraws To covert under the hills I am alone No bell disturbs the evening monotone I seem to merge with those implacable laws Which left the pyramid a graven pause In some gigantic attitude of stone There is an advent I have never known There is an imminence that overawes  Approach me making pallor with your feet I have waited for you long my cold white one Let not another muffled night repeat The tragic gesture of oblivion Let all death be concentred in your tread You will not walk with me when I am dead   Joseph Auslander  LITTLE LOU  To drink where the birds drink Oh the draught s touch is tender and cool Think Scattered like soft buds over the brink Of this delicate pool The birds leave their kisses for you Little Lou  To dream where the birds dream Oh the wind on the leaves is drowsily wild Stream Feathers of slumber in magical number Over our child The birds breathe their pale dreams on you Little Lou  To die where the birds die Oh why is the woodland so hushed everywhere And why Are all the leaves listless and limp in mid air Beneath a dead sky The birds they are dying for you Little Lou  Joseph Auslander   A PSALM FOR CATHLEEN NI HOOLIHAN I one of the grey sands cousin to him that was crucified Who am come from the breast of Sheba to Caesar s poisoned wine Of which no Israelite may die Have not forgot the tang of grey sands Nor the tang of keen black grasses I who have danced in Rome And known Roman women of the dances I have not strayed from my tribe Nor am I lost to my sires For today I came to an island Green as my mother s song of Canaan Fragrant as rain on the flax by the Nile And I heard Cathleen Ni Hoolihan crying  She silenced her grief and when I heard her speak Her breath was a breeze from a hill of blue flowers And though there was no crown upon her I knew she was a queen And though she raised a queenly cheek and shoulder I knew she was a slave  Tell me who you are 0 intruder on my sorrow  I a n one of the grey sands cousin to him that was crucified Who am come from the breast of Sheba majestic for all time Whose cheeks like meat of the fig were violet and white And Cathleen Ni Hoolihan I heard your crying   David Greenhood  She hid her white face in the sorrow of her hair That fell to the white petals of her feet  LIBERTY  Wantonly I ve been a freed man In a weary checked freedom  Far from the spinning in the pure blue of air Out of the hymnal curve of worlds  And I wish I were caught by an orbit in tune With the choral serfdom of stars  Here beneath the tree tops even I find Among meadowing sheep random more sure than mine  More sure than the frolic of pennies And the eddy of men in the streets  Hear O Democracy Unless I be captive to rhythm I am least free Unless the rose can hold me meek Or tiredness of dusk put me to sleep Unless I be creature of the morning Sheep of a shepherd  I am gone far astray in liberty Homesick beyond song  David Greenhood   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IN WESTERN MOUNTAINS  I  He stood a moment at the weathered edge Of the highest cliff and looked far out with me Upon great valleys ending in the haze And mountains that from haze drove up a wedge Of snow in skies of lapis lazuli Then something of the littleness of days His life could span came to him dizzily And he who boasted of his strength with men Turned back and grasped a little cedar tree Near by for safety and he shut his eyes Shaken and would not turn to look again Back from that cliff edge jutting to the skies He crawled and spoke at last with heavy breath God what a place What is it Life or Death  II  Our words seemed much in vain  How many Ages helped those heights attain  Such silence in the sun  O silent One   III  Faint jingle of little bells And the half heard shuffle of feet   Glenn Ward Dresbach  High up on the mountain side  Crept down through the waves of heat And a gray thread wove through the wide Cloth of the mountain side  The burro train came down With ores men take apart As the thing they love the best  From the multitudinous heart Of the mountain But all I could see Was a gray thread through tapestry  Glenn Ward Dresbach  QUESTION  When I make ready to go to sea The prairie ways keep calling me And when from the deep I d be sailing home I am beckoned seaward by the breaking foam Why need my heart be divided so Going when I stay and staying when I go  Flora Shufelt Rivola   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ROUGH WAYS  BURNT OUT  I started laying sod along the roof While the smoke thickened Blown from tree to tree The fire came on At last I dropped the spade And bitterly  I watched the timbers smolder and catch fire Heard the flame chuckling at the work I d done A pleasant mouthful Even now I can t Quite see the fun  BLIZZARD  All day the wind has sent along the trail A cry of battle Now night falls again Swept through the dusk like horsemen spectral pale The charging snow gusts spur across the plain  Beneath their onslaught fades each wagon mark The winding road is captured Mad to slay They thunder down upon me in the dark They strike me blind me I have lost the way Kemper Hammond Broadus   A PORTRAIT  His eyes can be quite old and stern But I have often watched them yearn Over an animal in pain And I have seen him through the rain Carry young lambs into the fold If a September night turns cold He leaves his sleep and in the gloom Covers the bushes that might bloom I know that when his eyes grow dim The first young bud will shout to him For in the spring I see him kneel Upon the rigid earth and feel With gentle hands among the leaves No glistening rim of frost deceives His instinct for arbutus flowers He sings during his working hours In a young voice a rousing song And sweeps the lagging work along To the delighted earth he brings Abounding love of living things So when he climbs the slopes to meet The rising sun they kiss his feet  Mildred Weston   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CREEDS  I  Men build rough high walls Along straight narrow lines And call them Creeds  Men carve distorted shapes Upon the rough high walls And call them Truth  Men put fantastic rags On those distorted shapes And call them Beauty  Men keep forever Within those rough high walls And call it Right  Men manacle their minds Fearful lest they scale the rough high walls And be free  Men blind their eyes Fearful lest they see the mysterious world And be wise  Men deafen their ears Fearful lest they hear Enthralling music calling them beyond And go   John H Gavin  Men creep onward Between those rough high walls Those grotesque walls those queer decked walls And call themselves saved  II  I am not saved  But friend weep not my lot  For I was born of sun and earth  And the stars are relatives of mine  I am brother to the wind  And the sea is a sister of mine  I am kinsman to the wolf  And the lamb is a cousin of mine  The blood of the eagle is part of me Part of me is blood of the dove The blood of the lark flows through my veins And the venomous blood of the snake  My mother nestles the pine The columbine aster and rose  M y mother fosters the oak And the violet suckles her  My mother gives life to the palm And the poppy grows red at her breast   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Yes and nothing trammels me  Save men my most beloved fools  Men would deafen my ears blinder my eyes  Manacle my mind  Ah my kindred I ll have no walls around me No rough high walls no queer decked walls  IMMORTALITY  I am immortal as a burst of song That quivers from the thrush s throat And sinks to silence  I am immortal as the kiss of love That wakes the world to melody And leaves a memory  I am immortal as the laughing hour That throws her leaven on the sodden heart And trips away  I am immortal as the purple dusk That drugs the weary brain to dreams And fades  I am immortal as the wind of March That woos the barren earth to life And passes   John H Gavin  I am immortal as the stubborn hills That breast the storms of centuries And wear to sand  I am immortal as the living sun That flames a moment in eternity And sputters out  John H Gavin  SILVER FOG  Hush hush hush Steady as footsteps in the sand I hear two other oars crunch in their locks And look now how my boat rocks To feel another boat close by So close so close that if I reach my hand  Who are you who am I To halt each other with a cry  Let us continue blurred and lonely Touched by each other s trembling only It is so seldom two can be Each for each a mystery  Winifred Welles   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A YEAR  I  Before the snow had melted from north slopes John Mortimer could feel the coming spring The imp that stirs the sleeping roots of trees And sends the sap up to the highest twigs Was in his blood He envied the gaudy rooster Who from his throne upon the leaning gate Shouted his challenge through the morning air Across the sleeping fields where snowdrifts lay  One morning going townward with the milk He offered Mary Allindale a ride Her father was a queer old man who worked A little farm and sometimes played his fiddle Half the night after his work was done She taught the village school John never knew How pretty Mary was until that day  Dusky horizons deep blue skies where clouds Float slowly in the distance three black specks They must be horses and a man plodding Along the boundary line between the gray Of last year s life and the black earth new plowed Resting upon a bed of last year s leaves At noon John Mortimer could see tall ranks   Raymond P Fischer  Of ripening corn he dreamed of growing stock And bigger barns and Mary Allindale  The evening wind blew sweet across the fields Of clover when at last he went to her It brought them tell tale odors of the farms They passed the faint warm smell of growing corn The cool and heavy incense of the stream That wanders half asleep through Watson s pasture A whip poor will was crying in the birches By the bridge the stars were tiny points Of gold above and the road was dim and gray  John Mortimer said little for it seemed That Mary Allindale belonged to him That night the stars and mist hung road were his And awkwardly he took her in his arms All the way home he heard her stifled laughter He called himself a fool and vowed that he Would think no more of Mary Allindale  II  The mower sang from dawn until the sun Was overhead from noon hour until night When hay was in he started on his barn He liked the sound of hammers at the work And liked to see the visioned barn take form   August came and turned green fields to gold Now binders moved across the sunny fields Men followed them and left the grain in shocks The threshers crawled along the country roads Great Chinese dragons Men brought them loads of grain To be devoured in a cloud of dust  When the barn was done his neighbors came in crowds But Mary did not come Shrill fiddles scraped Feet stamped and shuffled but he stood outside So she preferred to him a good for nothing Fiddling fool who scarcely owned the clothes Upon his back They ve gone out west to make A fortune then they ll study music The moon Came from behind a cloud and grinned at him A screech owl laughed from somewhere in the dark  III  A steady thud and clump of horses feet A single crow seemed frozen in the sky Borne on the cruel wind it drifted by John Mortimer plowed on from dark to dark He cut his fields in furrows for the frost And snow to smooth But earth had lost its goodness He did not care whether it shone or rained The days when sun poured down like golden wine Did not deceive he knew the world was wrong   Raymond P Fischer  IV  The tiniest stream is hushed when winter comes  It cannot whisper to the passing banks About the great green ocean and its ships The days when it has run before the wind Laughing and beckoning with hands of foam The nights when tired of play it has crept up Some distant bay and murmured round the piling Of silent rocks are all forgotten now  And winter hushed the whispering memories He swung his ax all day and had no thoughts  Except the quiet things about his work That come unsought to every worker s mind  One morning going townward with the milk He stopped to give the new schoolma am a lift Though he had often passed her on the road He had never known how beautiful she was Though snow still lay in drifts on northern slopes Though trees and roadside brush were white with frost John Mortimer could feel the coming spring  Raymond P Fischer   COMMENT  MOVING  POETS and prosers have discussed in many volumes man s relation to his environment but how much we are what surrounds us is still an open question  For nearly ten years POETRY has been at home in the not over spacious room to the left of the entrance of 543 Cass Street By the time this number is issued we shall have torn ourselves away from this cubic box of memories we shall have shifted our furniture and files our books and back numbers our gallery of poets photographs and other pictures our tempers and temperaments our hearts and hopes and hospitalities to a strange place as yet unenriched by history leaving this atmospheric chamber doubled in the big Victorian mirror over the mantel piece to the coldly calculating advances of the medical department of an insurance company  But we cannot depart without saying goodbye without consecrating our farewell by recalling the things which have happened the people who have entered or lingered in this old haunted and haunting room Once it was part of a dwelling which erected soon after the Great Fire of Seventy one housed the family and the books of Ezra McCagg owner of the largest private library in Chicago For two or three decades the house stood among congenial neighbors abodes of the quality set in spacious grounds But the quality including the McCaggs scattered and   Moving  business penetrated at first on tip toe hesitatingly The American Bankers Insurance Company bought the place and connected it in the rear with a new building the two right angling an apartment house on the corner And while their alterations were still fresh in the summer of 1912 the inexperienced prospective editor of a poets magazine to be entered the Ohio Street door one morning in search of a North Side office in the neighborhood  Whom should she find in possession as president of the insurance company but one of the magazine s guarantors Mr James P Whedon of happy memory one of the most generous of all because his fortune was always moderate Soon the editor and her first associate Alice Corbin Henderson were hospitably installed in one of the two rentable rooms beside the Cass Street entrance their good friend adding office desks and chairs to their meagre business equipment From this room during that summer of 1912 the first letters and circulars went out in search of contributors and subscribers and hither came those first responses on which depended the vitality of the magazine  Ezra Pound s first letter for example I have often recorded the cordiality of his co operation as POETRY S first representative abroad Along with him came through the mail the other first imagists H D and Aldington W  C Williams and Flint and Cannell John G Neihardt greeted us with a tragedy Joseph Campbell with The Piper Allen Upward with his Scented Leaves from a   Chinese Jar Joyce Kilmer long before the brutal War which killed him with Trees John Reed heroic beloved vagabond with Sangar Mrs Conkling with her musical minded Symphony in a Mexican Garden which arriving in the nick of time for our first number aided us in antedating a proposed Boston contemporary who had threatened to requisition our title And so on those important early contributors who enriched the magazine with their own values  The excitement of the adventure is what I remember best from that first experimental year The novel enterprise hovered in the mind of the public on the delicate border line between the sublime and the ridiculous and our own minds trembled between a thrill and a laugh If pride was inflated by authoritative words from poets and critics it soon collapsed under expert stabs of wrath or ridicule If a few new and unknown poets aroused our hopes of genius hundreds astounded us with self satisfied mediocrity or worse We were dashed between extremes like a rubber ball in the play of a juggler and the thing least expected was what happened next  Who led the long procession of distinguished visitors whose faces and words now haunt these walls I think Rabindranath Tagore was the first of the then unknownbut now famous bards who have actually darkened the Cass Street door and sat in our poets chair Tagore the sage of Bengal whom we had thought of as in England or maybe India but who wrote to us from Urbana   Moving  Illinois upon his first appearance in English in POETRY S third number December 1912 And the second was Lindsay who followed his General Booth to Cass Street that first winter sealing his hardship with the hand of friendship Witter Bynner and Arthur Ficke the Damon and Pythias of the art were among the early arrivals and Agnes Lee Freer a newly married resident of Chicago and Helen Hoyt who soon graduated from her commercial post into POETRY S office and Maxwell Bodenheim then mute and inglorious  And so on The magic transformation of abstract name carrying entities into living breathing men and women was then as it continues to be the editor s high reward Poets it became evident were not mere voices far away but human beings who could come into Cass Street and even develop into friends During our second twelvemonth there were important miracles in this kind Amy Lowell pilgrimaging from Boston to Chicago with poems under her arm seemed a prophet of change was East coming West at last was an era passing and a new one on the way As if to give answer here came Carl Sandburg walking solidly into the office when the fateful year 1914 was new or perhaps unborn entering with his strong hand out and his slow rich loyal voice uttering words of greeting  In the spring arrived two British poets from opposite curves of the world The illustrious William Butler Yeats changed from a Poet Enshrined into a living   Irishman who could give tit for tat to George Moore s imaginative gossip about him which had just appeared In his honor POETRY eased out of Cass Street long enough to give a banquet which has since been recognized as a milestone in the path of the new movement And along in April or May one afternoon when the editor was alone entered on his way home from the South Seas a handsome young Englishman then still obscure one Rupert Brooke a member of the Georgian group whose first anthology had but recently appeared How peaceful was the day how remote the possibility of war to this blond young poet whose spirit was to straighten like a flame at the then so imminent bugle call and run into the war god s deadly arms with a song  Sara Teasdale John Gould Fletcher Edgar Lee Masters these and many others from Missouri Arkansas Chicago the Seven Seas were Cass Street guests of those early years Later came Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens opposite poles of the renaissance The procession goes on still may it find its way into Erie Street the procession of shadow shapes assuming flesh and blood  Nor should we forget the others the countless visitors who have arrived at our doors but never in our covers They come with verses mostly by mail but often in person some modestly some over sure They ask for criticism which if granted rarely satisfies the urge or ache within They can not be classified they are as varied as other growths of the living earth Rich and poor bourgeois   Moving  and bolshevik refined and coarse tragic and absurd they have played their different parts in Cass Street strangely unlike but moved always by the same motive the longing to express themselves to reveal their naked souls  If these walls could speak these walls that we are leaving They have heard everything discussed and torn to bits men women poems theories tendencies the war the peace marriage divorce clothes coiffures eyebrows the abstract beauty and the ultimate defeat life death and immortality the weather and the curve of a dog s tail And they have listened through hours of silence with nothing ringing but the telephone while the editor wrote in old fashioned long hand countless breathlessly brief notes to poets or summoned spirits from the vasty deep to infuse wit and wisdom into her editorials and help her come to the end with a flourish as now when she must test POETRY S personality by shifting its environment as she signs a final farewell to old Five forty three H M  REVIEWS  A WOMAN WITH A HAMMER  The Contemplative Quarry and The Man with a Hammer  by Anna Wickham Introduction by Louis Untermeyer  Harcourt Brace amp Co  The most casual reading if such a thing were possible of Mrs Wickham s work reveals the strength of   her candor the intense singleness of her purpose writes Mr Untermeyer in an introduction that makes one admire the shrewdness of the gentlemen who chose him for his task And without wishing to disagree the hesitant reader may be permitted to wonder what candor and a purpose may have to do with an art In the present case they seem to resolve themselves into pugnaciously put platitudes like the following  Am I your mate because I share your bed  Go then Find each day a new mate outside your house  I am your mate if I can share your vision  Nor is one entirely ready to question the possible necessity of this explanation to the person addressed It is simply that one as a male in general has a right to a sort of hypothetical intelligence for a poet is presumably addressing the more illuminated of mankind  Nor again should a reviewer allow himself to be too greatly piqued by a technical insult to his sex and the present reviewer does not purpose to be so But even perspicuous generalities do not constitute poetry and platitudes are not perspicuous and a perusal of this sort of poetry in quantities enforces boredom This poet like too many others becomes more interested in the reason for her unhappiness than in the unhappiness itself and having reasons that are commonplace enough there is no subtle evasion in her statement nothing to disguise however thinly the barrenness of trodden ground   A Woman with a Hammer  When she essays a more lyric mode she is equally  stale and her staleness is even more obvious to the  average eye  With other thrift I turn the key Of the old chest of Memory And in my spacious dreams unfold A flimsy stuff of green and gold And walk and wander in the dress Of old delights and tenderness  In The Cherry Blossom Wand she achieves something  of a literary grace perhaps slightly more than that and  in Sehnsucht an epigram that is really very hard and well  done but otherwise there is little in the book to commend  I quote Sehnsucht  Because of body s hunger are we born And by contriving hunger are we fed Because of hunger is our work well done And so are songs well sung and things well said Desire and longing are the whips of God God save us all from death when we are fed  Mrs Wickham s handling of sex problems is too obvious coming after Lawrence for serious consideration indeed her handling of all topics coming after someone or something else is so Nothing is so awkward to the mind of him addressed as a belated irony  She is in quick succession burning hot and icy cold she is driven from fiery antagonisms to smoldering apathy she is acutely sensitive restless harassed writes our commentator approaching his climax and most of us will leave him with the field Yvor Winters   WOODWINDS  We the Musk Chasers by Loureine Aber Ralph Fletcher  Seymour  The most significant men of this poetic era have surrounded themselves like the princess who slept for a hundred years with brambles of objectivity striving to insure inviolableness man being resentful of intrusion All the while the women have given themselves from day to day without reserve There are rare exceptions of course But in the main it is the man who is on his guard and the woman generous in poetry and in life So Loureine Aber has written without subterfuge as though like Marie Bashkirtseff for her own journal She speaks not alone of and for herself but puts in order the chaotic protest and exaltation of numberless inarticulate girl voices There are in this age so many printed and in a measure successful poets that one forgets how many times that number of sensitive spirits are more silent than the dumb For them it is not so simple a matter to net the flickering moth of emotion and mood and preserve it in adequate expression Quite often the deterrent is laziness and a Nietzschean desire to exhale a god and a universe in one breath Poetry says the aspirant with eyes in a fine frenzy rolling is a matter of inspiration and she grasps feverishly at vers Hire perverting it into undigested prose divided arbitrarily into lines unmindful of the euphonic devices by which it can be given beauty and charm Loureine Aber has done   Woodwinds  her service not for these but for the thousands of girls in cities either born speechless or submerged in a bedlam of typewriters adding machines and switchboards  Miss Aber makes use not of a niggling rhythm of syllable for syllable or a subtle rhythm of vowel but of a large rhythm of word and phrase so large in swing as to be almost Sandburgian In it there is more than a trace of the influence of popular syncopation  Go so far and halt your tracks Catch the first glimpse turn your backs  Her work is done with commendable neatness and frugality I have mentioned Sandburg in connection with rhythm the resemblance goes deeper than that But Loureine Aber has lopped off all extraneous material and presented herself in the kernel Here are no polemics or propaganda One is often tempted to do with poetry as a friend of mine does with the drama when she divides it into problem plays and good plays or to say with Yeats and emphasize well the last word One makes of one s struggle with oneself poetry of one s struggle with others rhetoric The self is not in the poet as in elementary forms a simple whole like the cipher Rather in the higher organism it is a grouping of rebellious and often anarchistic parts and in every such being the struggle is both common and unique Moreover this is an age of acute self consciousness as witness not only its verse but its novel such as it is the more diffuse form therefore the fuller evidence In order to be authentic one must have   the keen observation and the frank speech of a surgeon  One has however the option of distilling one s speech into  the essence of itself This Miss Aber does not do She  is very simple but gives glimpses as in Old Man of an  elemental strength that may be developed far  Dawn sprang wildly to her lips And the little hard breasts burst as a waterfall over the rocks I the dark pine at the precipice neck Lunged and was still Then swiftly as wild birds go to the kill Toppled and ran with her youth to the sea  They said I was wanton and cruel To have taken her youth at the height To have matched the great might Of my years With her slender beauty and tremulous fears  I tell you I lunged and was still Then swiftly as wild birds go to the kill Toppled and ran with her youth to the sea Pity me  Though one may disagree with the poet on beautiful hills as a necessary adjunct to the concept of God God in the City is as strong an indictment against those who wrought pigsties out of gauze as though it were legally drawn up witnessed signed and sealed It is a universal confession  Beautiful hills Valleys And all the other things we think of when we think of God Are not here I find myself at a loss to formulate much good And so I simply say God   Woodwinds  As you call Fido  And let it go at that  If Miss Aber has not yet reached her poetic majority she is at any rate among the few one would have bring their gifts to perfect fruition through a study of the masters new and old and through the sacrifice of ease  I should like also to add an appreciative word to Mr Seymour for the format of this book and to Mr Blackwell for his delicate decorations Pearl Andelson  QUAKER GRAY AND ROSE  Willow Pollen by Jeannette Marks Four Seas Co  In this first book of verse with its non committal cover of quaker gray I like best the poems in which Miss Marks clear sharp and often whimsical mind is in the ascendency over her emotions  In some spirits pain is a flame that flares and consumes till the burning consciousness lights up all around it in others a smouldering ache that however it be heaped with green withes throws up a screening smoke In the groping cries of some of these songs of pain I feel a lonely and proud spirit that has been hurt much but the hurt has blurred instead of sharpening expression  The cleavage between Miss Marks mental and emotional approach gives a curious effect of duality of personality Sometimes it seems as though the verses must have been written by two esthetically dissimilar personalities On one page you will find the innocent sentimen   tality of a piece of album verse and on the other such  acidly lovely lines as these from White Hair  All the warmth has gone out of white hair  It only answers to the wind  And lifts and stirs like creeping snow  Close to the frozen scalp of earth  This disparity can no doubt be partly explained by the inclusion of early poems but it is surprising to find such pallid stuff as Your Sunlit Way between the same covers as a sharply faceted poem like Stars with its molded form and finely pointed thought  Often you feel how this southern woman loves the sun In Calendar where the tender intimately whimsical gossip about nature recalls Emily Dickinson the sun is likened to a bee a big bee a burning bee  Throughout the book are scattered delightful whimsicalities and stanzas from which luminous images leap like sudden lights out of a mist Sometimes with an unexpected line Miss Marks can push out the walls of a narrow room into an unlimited horizon Take the rose gray magic of this conjured picture  Sea gulls I saw lifting the dawn with rosy feet  In Jeannette Marks more intense moods Sea Gulls from which the above lines are taken Dragon and others there is a note of hysteria a desperate half fascinated peering into the depths where  myriad eyes float and sway stab sting and die away   Quaker gray and Rose  You feel the terror and curiosity of a romantic imagination that is drawn by the sinister grotesque into the darker ways of fantasy But always in this nature the romanticist is in eternal conflict with the moralist no mind made moralist at that but one into whose quivering soul is bitten as with an acid a sense of inescapable responsibility for others woes  For me the charm of Willow Pollen lies in those verses where the poet s heart is quiescent and the alert and supple mind is free to play delicately as in Cloud  Tut it is a ship as plain as anything Full spread to find the silver edges of the world Where ships and island daffodils Burn follow sun dip Cling to the shining brim like flapping butterflies  And the sky Now you tell what the sky is  In the last two lines you touch a certain elfin quality in Miss Marks mind a quality that is emphasized in the delicious sleep song Rose Toada  Shoo Rose Toada Shoo Jewelled red eyes for you Shoo Rose Toada Shoo  Hoosh Rose Toada hoosh Little green snake in the bush Hoosh Rose Toada hoosh  Bizz Rose Toada buzz Gold on its wings and fuzz Bizz Rose Toada buzz  Lola Ridge   VICARIOUS EXPERIENCE  Clouds and Cobblestones by Hortense Flexner Houghton  Mifflin Co  Though Miss Flexner s poetry builds up the picture of an attractive and cultivated personality and though her verse is always polished and sometimes sparkling it is never heart wringing It has not one imagines wrung the heart of the poet We find her deeply moved by a number of things a newspaper account of a pogrom a child s death in a charity ward the futility of war Her sympathetic scope is wide she sees with a pitiful vision devoid of mockery the tragedy of approaching age in the life of a rich and shallow woman she has a wistful comprehension of a child s day dreams But all this is after all vicarious experience One misses the swirl and rush of unimpeded personal emotion  We find also a generous sprinkling of poetic themes and words Helen and asphodel with an occasional charming vers de societé of which we may instance For an Old Lady to whom Sonnets had been Written and less often such a skilfully wrought interpretation as The Death Mask of an Unknown Soldier For the rest we learn that the poet loves April blossoms the colors green and gray the little child next door facts agreeably but not memorably recorded Some of the love lyrics have fragrance and charm but none of them seems deeply motivated There is hardly a poem in the book that seems to have sprung into being because of an irresistible inner urge   Vicarious Experience  Too frequently these poems are weighted down verbose Miss Flexner uses words unsparingly a defect not excused even by the intrinsic and evocative beauty of many of her favorite words This criticism does not hold true of her free verse however clever frequently humorous flashes from an active mind which serve to counterbalance the easy sentimentality of the lyrics  As a proof that the volume contains much that is lovely it is only fair to let the poet speak for herself as she does very characteristically in Four Things  Four things I cannot remember In the fulness of their grace Wind of the spring curve of the sea The moon s pale touch on a white birch tree And your kiss upon my face  For though I cherish and hold them The heavy winter through Spring is more gay the sea foam wrought And the birch are lovelier than I thought And a kiss is always new  Muna Lee  JEAN COCTEAU  Poesies 1917 1920 and Carte Blanche by Jean Cocteau Editions de la Sirène Paris  M Cocteau has been described as the enfant prodige of contemporary French literature As to whether this description conveys the whole truth about him or only a part opinions will necessarily differ His latest book of poems reveals both his weaknesses and his strength   Whatever else may be said about them the fact remains that here is the expression of a very definite personality reacting to an extraordinary degree to visual and tangible stimuli and endowed with both imagination and fantasy  Indeed so vivid are the impressions this poet receives and so contemptuous is he of the ordinary rules governing the use of language that in the attempt to fuse the one with the other the result is frequently baffling even to the most intelligent reader and must be often completely incomprehensible to the majority This must be counted a fault if clarity and universal intelligibility are reckoned as characteristics of the greatest art and most people take this view Similarly contempt or neglect of form can be pushed to extreme limits and this is a reproach to which M Cocteau evidently lays himself open But once these points have been conceded to the not necessarily carping critic it must be admitted that the poems themselves merit serious attention even if they fail to arouse universal admiration  We are conscious that the poet is as it were walking on a tight rope all the time or at least on some level to which the ordinary reader is to say the least unaccustomed To vary the metaphor we might compare him to an excessively agile mountain goat who will soon be lost sight of by his pursuer unless the latter in his turn manages to reproduce with tolerable exactitude each perilous leap from peak to peak so carelessly undertaken by the quarry he pursues Indeed unless the   Jean Cocteau  reader possesses the power not only of making mental leaps but of making the same mental leaps as the author of these Poesies he will often find himself hopelessly left behind and floundering in valleys of apparent nonsense  This poetry is elusive in the extreme obeying it might almost be said no rules but those of the author s imaginative caprices M Cocteau reminds one at times of Humpty Dumpty in his treatment of words When I use a word Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what I choose it to mean neither more nor less The question is said Alice whether you can make words mean different things The question is said Humpty Dumpty which is to be master that s all  But none of this is said in condemnation Certain means are proper to certain ends and the ultimate test of a poem as of anything else is whether it achieves the effect intended And it must at once be conceded that  M Cocteau s poems do this in nine cases out of ten Take for example Ascenseur of course unpunctuated  Tant de douceur dans notre moelle c est un masseur graissé d étoiles Gabriel artificiel en tombant du ciel freine un peu  On m a parlé d un ascenseur extraordinaire à New York   il donne le baiser du vacuum cleaner et on vous retire en bas comme une loque  Petite cabine vernie abominable douceur  La mort fauche avec son aile tous les échelons de l échelle  une ébauche d agonie  Le mât de hune huilé de lune  on touche le bouton à gauche à l angle de la vitrine  La lune douche l estomac ouvre la bouche  ut de poitrine  Here we have in a few lines all the physical and psychological sensations connected with our experiences of lifts and the whole poem is on a definitely imaginative level  Le Voyage en Italie is another good example of M Cocteau s style and while it is far too long for quotation it is rich in happy phraseology and striking images such as  Rome Le pape a enfermé tout le monde dehors Shelley a toujours eu l air d une grande fille noyée Naples A Paris ce soir il fait un temps de concierges dehors   Jean Cocteau  While the nostalgia of this most Parisian of Parisians amongst the monuments of Rome and the plafonds lourds is eloquently voiced in the following poignant lines  J ai besoin de Paris et des Champs Elysées j ai besoin de Paris je ne suis pas de Rome je ne suis pas de Moscou Marie rue d Anjou douceur angevine pauvre Marie j ai mal à mes Champs Elysées  In Batterie the poet reveals another side of himself his love of the sun and of the contrast between the black skins of negroes and the azure skies under which they live and toil This note is of frequent occurrence but nowhere is it more eloquently expressed than in this hymn to the sun which is one of the most formal of the poems in this volume  Soleil je t adore comme les sauvages à plat ventre sur le rivage  Soleil tu vernis tes chromos tes paniers de fruit tes animaux  Fais moi le corps tanné salé fais mon grand douleur s en aller  Fais braire la cigale en haut du pin fais moi sentir le four à pain  Fais moi répandre mes mauvais rêves soleil boa d Adam et d Eve  Fais moi un peu m habituer à ce que mon pauvre Jean soit tué   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The poem is too long to quote in its entirety but it is one of the most striking in the collection a collection redolent of the exoticism of ships and ports American bars and sky scrapers negroes films ice cream sodas and the melancholy of swings and roundabouts the  whole seen through the eyes and filtered through the sensibility of a highly cultured versatile imaginative curious and extremely modern mind  Carte Blanche is a reprint of a series of articles which appeared in Paris Midi during the summer of 1919 They treat of a variety of subjects ranging from a discussion of the latest movements in French music and painting to essays in sheer reporting such as the description of the Défilé de la Victoire at the peace celebrations on July fourteenth 1919 They furnish another example of the versatility of M Cocteau and of the never failing lightness of his touch and the quickness of his comprehension The paper devoted to Landru is full of good things and a model of this kind of topical essay  Landru inaugure le retour du Fait Divers civil Avec lui le chien écrasé retrouve ses droits L amoureux médiocre brûle des souvenirs n est il pas plus simple de brûler toute la dame Si Landru se livrait à cette liquidation j aime l imaginer au coin du feu tisonnant les cendres de sa belle d un air rêveur et soupirant Du courage il ne faut plus penser à tout cela  Perhaps some readers will prefer M Cocteau s prose to his verse enough has perhaps been quoted to reveal the quality of both Rollo H Myers   OUR CONTEMPORARIES  MORE NEW MAGAZINES  If new magazines may be assumed to indicate a certain  vitality in the art they represent modern poetry may be  congratulated for its voices are speaking everywhere in  organs from leaflet to folio size Some of these organs  are for poets only but most of them admit him with  writers of tales critics sometimes limners and composers  Here is The Beacon published in Oxford England by  B H Blackwell who has given so many young English poets their first appearance in small volumes beautifully made The Beacon aims to deal broadly and constructively with three essential and inseparable things Education Religion and Art The first number introduced by a poem by Tagore and A Credo for a New Era by Stephen Graham contains interesting articles and drawings but little in our special province  Broom our international Roman contemporary which is now in its fifth number has lost Alfred Kreymborg from its staff Harold A Loeb now conducts it in Rome and Lola Ridge has recently become its American editor her office being at 3 East Ninth Street New York  Another international monthly began in Barcelona Spain last February Prisma proclaims itself una revista internacional de poesia and enriches its first number with Opffer s portrait of Carl Sandburg an article on the latter by Louis Butcher Lee and translations of   nine of his shorter poems including Jan Kubelik and Cool Tombs Indeed Spain has been sending us a number of magazines of late Two from Madrid are La Pluma now in its third year and the first three numbers of  Indice Revista Mensual  And another impending international is Secession which instigated at Paris opens fire this spring at Vienna will march on Berlin and eventually establish itself in New York It will in its early numbers expose the private correspondence hidden sins and secret history of its American contemporaries The Dial Little Review Broom POETRY etc  From the far antipodes comes The Australian Poetry Annual of 1922 published by the Melbourne Literary Club and presenting poems sometimes creditable but not yet exciting or suggestive of the locale  Youth the Chicago monthly which we welcomed last autumn must have been beloved of the gods as it died with a promptness befitting its title To The Wave also published by Steen Hinrichson we may wish a longer and more prosperous life Its editor is Vincent Starrett and it contains poems and prose by a number of our friends also in the second number a group of beautiful wood cuts by Birger Sandzen  The Reviewer of Richmond Virginia now in its second volume is discovering some interesting material in the South We quoted last month one of Mrs Peterkin s bits of Negro folk lore   More New Magazines  From here and there come tiny leaflets of local verse for instance The Bard from Dallas Texas and The Poet s Scroll from Sherwood Oklahoma No strong evidence of genius in these but they represent each a group and an aspiration CORRESPONDENCE  FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE P S A  To the Editor Please let me say a word as to your correspondent s report of the P S A annual dinner  She begins with an interested reference to other dinners banquets of Shoe lace and Ribbon Manufacturers Flower and Feather Manufacturers which may have been held that evening at the Hotel Astor and which might have appealed to the avowed Rabelaisian taste of your reporter more than did the dinner which she attended The poets were decorous she complains they were all in standardized evening array So as far as I could observe in spite of her having written verse was your reporter  She follows with a saucily lackadaisical account of the program some of it accurate The gist of the remarks that bored her was very much akin to the gist of the leading editorial in the April POETRY Local loyalties are turning with deep enthusiasm toward the arts She would evidently prefer a clever monopoly perhaps   in Chicago She missed the deliberate intimation of the evening Some of us realize that New York is quite as provincial as Chicago and the Executive Committee deferred at the January dinner all along the line to speakers from the other provinces  She instances with relish Miss Lowell s challenge to the Society Miss Lowell a critic who has quaintly and ably won for herself the right to be blunt assumed an absence of sharp clash and critical emotional insight from the Society s meetings and announced her preference as one often does for her own judgments and methods of expression Miss Lowell was largely wrong in her assumption Her clash this time was rather flat than sharp for the reason that she was recklessly judging by meetings of other poetry groups the regular sessions of the P S A where there has certainly been more sharp clash than at any smaller contemporary gatherings of poets anywhere whether public or private As to critical emotional insight it is easier to talk about than to exhibit especially at a dinner  Miss Dudley concedes an hour of values contemplative and exciting That seems to me a fair ratio in a professional program She complains of four hours of futility During two of those hours she and the army captain she mentions were free to contribute at their own table whatever they desired of Rabelaisian stimulus and general interest If they chose to contribute futility it was their own fault   From the President of the P S A  Large dinners whether social or professional are not ideal means of intellectual or emotional exchange In lieu of something better they have become an occasional method of assemblage for the membership of organizations The P S A in addition to its monthly meetings of give and take chooses to listen quietly once a year to some group or other of members and guests This year all the speakers except Mr Chang Peng Chun were Americans from widely different parts of the country There were no expatriates even Only one of them had been heard before by the Society Some of them may have been dull So were some of their critics But none of the speakers if you will forgive me made the lapse of mistaking mere smart distemper for critical emotional insight  That sort of lapse if you will forgive me again is becoming too frequent in the pages of POETRY Miss Dudley is not the only offender Are there no stages dear editor between the stodgy and the supercilious Are there no happier ways of avoiding one kind of emptiness than by substituting another Is sharp crash valuable to you Must a crackling of thorns boil the pot and the poet Is even prose less important than pose Should a magazine which has shown signs of health permit itself these amusing but unlovely sounds of literary indigestion  Incidentally let me thank you for printing in a recent  issue an honest and thoughtful article by Mr Baker Brownell Witter Bynner    A WORD FOR MR GUEST  To the Editor I suppose you will hardly care to print a brief protest against your condemnation of Mr Guest Let me say at once that I entirely agree with you that his verses are not poetry perhaps not even literature in your and my sense of the term Neither is the bulk of Longfellow Yet both Longfellow and Mr Guest touch the human heart in a fashion quite out of the reach of most of the estimable writers who monthly adorn your pages Mr Guest s trivial little poems impart something perhaps not much but something of the sweet high consecration of rhythmic ecstasy to the common things that make up the daily experience of millions of readers who would be quite insensible to Ezra Pound and Amy Lowell Also I think you vastly over estimate the importance of Mr Guest s reward It is precisely proportioned to his production dull sordid dollars and the loud vociferation of the thick breathed vulgar which your finer natured poets would instinctively disdain And I disagree totally with your view that Mr Guest is a menace to literature On the contrary I do not believe that his verses distract one single reader from a better order of poetry while they may lure many readers through the medium of his rather obvious music to something much more worth while Surely you do not imagine that if Mr Guest were altogether eliminated from a world of which I esteem him a considerable benefactor the circulation of POETRY would be increased by   A Word for Mr Guest  a single subscriber Those who read Guest will never read Sandburg and those who read Sandburg will never read Guest Why not let each reader have what appeals to him and helps him Gamaliel Bradford NOTES  The initial Blindman Prize of 250 has been awarded by the
