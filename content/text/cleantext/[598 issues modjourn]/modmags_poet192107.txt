Under the forge Men hold red bars of iron with black iron tongs It crashes sparks spatter out it crashes again again At last the iron is bent as it belongs  Swedes Norwegians Poles or Greeks they are men They grin when they please look ugly when they please They wear black oakum in their ears for the noise They know their job handle their tools with ease  Their eyes are clean and white in their black faces If they like they are surly can speak an ugly no They laugh great blocks of mirth their jokes are simple They know where they stand which way they go   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  If I wore overalls lost my disguise Of womanhood and youth they would call me friend They would see I am one of them and we could talk And laugh together and smoke at the day s end  DINGY STREET  It is twilight by the dreary edge of town And the December air Is harsh and bitter All the trees are bare The leaves are scattered and trodden down To pulp and every house is brown There is no trace of beauty anywhere  Night comes slowly the houses hide in the gloom But toward the muddy street One by one their shabby windows bloom Like golden flowers to shine and greet The bundled effigies on sodden feet Trudging toward welcome in the hidden room  There is a magic in it There once more Body and spirit they are warmed and fed There as a thousand times before The ancient feast is spread The simple miracles of love and bread They stumble into beauty at the door   Marjorie Allen Seiffert  INTERIOR  Words curl like fragrant smoke wreaths in the room From the majestic beard of an old man Who props his shabby feet upon the stove Recalling ancient sorrows In the gloom Beyond the lamp a woman thinks of love Her round arms wrapped in her apron her dark head Drooping She has a bitter thing to learn His words drift over her uncomforted Her pain whirls up and twists like a scarlet thread Among his words He rises shoves his chair Back from the stove pauses beside her there Shuffles irresolutely off to bed  CUBIST PORTRAIT  She is purposeless as a cyclone she must move Either by chance or in a predestined groove Following a whim not her own unable to shape Her course From chance or God even she cannot escape  Think of a cyclone sitting far off with its head in its hands Motionless drearily longing for distant lands Where every lonely hurricane may at last discover Its own transcendent implacable indestructible lover  What is a cyclone Only thin air moving fast From here to yonder to become silent emptiness at last   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TWO WOMEN  Two faint shadows of women were ascending The pathway of a desolate hill Pale as moth wings beneath the low bending Sycamore branches in the moonlight paler still  This one is dead said the moon her face is ashen She is dry as a withered leaf What has she known of beauty or of passion To come by moonlight to the mountain of grief  The other too is dead said the earth yet her feet are burning I feel them hot and restless as blown fire She has known many paths why is she turning Here from the secret valley of desire  They passed the moon paled and from leafy places Morning crept forth At last they came From the mountain of grief women with tear wet faces Who had been withered leaf and shadow of flame  PORTRAIT OF A LADY  Good morning madam in your sleepy brown hair Twist yourself awake blink and stare I am lying on the floor With the old rose red   Marjorie Allen Seiffert  Dressing gown you wore When you went to bed  Don t look stupid with your drowsy blue eyes Here by the bed is your disguise You re a gentle wife And a tender mother And all your life You shall be no other  Life is a shawl to wrap about your shoulder Every day warmer every day older In half an hour You ll be dressed Youth like a flower Wilting on your breast  DREAM KISS  Moment of delight most delicate Cool as a rose is cool Swift and silent as a pool To mirror wings in flight Passionate as frost is passionate With patterns intricate and white Pure as music in the night Far off yet intimate It came   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Poignant as beauty on swift feet of flame It paused was gone most delicate Moment of delight  SHADOW  Like the flickering shadow  Of birds flying  Over a wide meadow Something passes  Some forgotten or untold  Dream flies over  Its wings brushing  Lightly against me as rushing  Fingers of wind touch clover  And bending grasses I am cold With the shadow of something dying  AS YOU ARE NOW  Under golden boughs that lean and drift You lift your head and ripples of light Touch the leaves till they quiver Reaching down in a motionless Unachieved caress The branches ache with their desire And the wind holds its breath The moment dies in a shiver   Marjorie Allen Seiffert  Of icy fire eternity and death Then leaves fall softly on your head  NOCTURNE  The moonlit hill And the black trees Where a hidden bird Sings and is still Even these Leave me unstirred I am hidden deep Like the secret bough Of a tree in leaf I am safe asleep What can touch me now Of joy or grief  For night and noon The sky is shut The winds are dumb Behind the moon No gates are cut For the winds to come  Could wind from the moon Sweep down until Like a winter tree   POETRY A Magazine of Verse My leaves were strewn On the moonlit hill And I stood free Beauty and pain Would touch me now With bitter cold As moonbeams rain Through a naked bough When the year is old Marjorie Allen Seiffert   UNDER THE TREE  THE CORNFIELD  I went across the pasture lot When not a one was watching me Away beyond the cattle barns I climbed a little crooked tree  And I could look down on the field And see the corn and how it grows Across the world and up and down In very straight and even rows  And far away and far away I wonder if the farmer man Knows all about the corn and how It comes together like a fan  THE PILASTER  The church has pieces jutting out Where corners of the walls begin I have one for my little house And I can feel myself go in  I feel myself go in the bricks And I can see myself in there I m always waiting all alone I m sitting on a little chair   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And I am sitting very still And I am waiting on and on For something that is never there For something that is gone  THE STAR  O little one away so far You cannot hear me when I sing  You cannot tell me what you are 1 cannot tell you anything  WATER NOISES  When I am playing by myself And all the boys are lost around Then I can hear the water go It makes a little talking sound  Along the rocks below the tree I see it ripple up and wink And I can hear it saying on And do you think and do you think  A bug shoots by that snaps and ticks And a bird flies up beside the tree To go into the sky to sing I hear it say Killdee killdee   Elizabeth Madox Roberts  Or else a yellow cow comes down To splash a while and have a drink But when she goes I still can hear The water say And do you think  CRESCENT MOON  And Dick said Look what I have found And when we saw we danced around And made our feet just tip the ground  We skipped our toes and sang Oh lo Oh who oh who oh what do you know Oh who oh hi oh loo kee lo  We clapped our hands and sang Oh ee It made us jump and laugh to see The little new moon above the tree  STRANGE TREE  Away beyond the Jarboe house I saw a different kind of tree Its trunk was old and large and bent And I could feel it look at me  The road was going on and on Beyond to reach some other place I saw a tree that looked at me And yet it did not have a face   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It looked at me with all its limbs It looked at me with all its bark The yellow wrinkles on its sides Were bent and dark  And then I ran to get away But when I stopped and turned to see The tree was bending to the side And leaning out to look at me  A CHILD ASLEEP  And I looked for him everywhere Because I wanted him to play And then I found him on his bed Asleep but it was day  His eyes were shut behind the lids He couldn t lift them up to see And I looked at him very long And something in him looked at me  And he was something like a cat That is asleep and like a dog Or like a thing that s in the woods All day behind a log  And then I was afraid of it Of something that was sleeping there   Elizabeth Madox Roberts  I didn t even say his name But I came down the stair  MY HEART  My heart is beating up and down Is walking like some heavy feet My heart is going every day And I can hear it jump and beat  At night before I go to sleep I feel it beating in my head I hear it jumping in my neck And in the pillow on my bed  And then I make some little words To go along and say with it  The men are sailing home from Troy And all the lamps are lit  The men are sailing home from Troy And all the lamps are lit Elizabeth Madox Roberts   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SEMPER EADEM  FOURTH DIMENSION  His life was strangely hedged about By three though he seemed not to know it One whom he loved who shut him out One hid her passion in her doubt One was too fond and wise to show it  The first blew on desire s dark flame Until he tossed with every flicker In agonies of sad self blame That left him tired but not yet tame Enough to cease love s tireless bicker  The second tried in vain to bind him Uncertain of what stirred in each Walking through labyrinths to find him She saw him shorn but could not blind him And silence was her wittiest speech  The third had known him since she bore him And suffered though she may have smiled To know that barren wishes tore him When one was ready to adore him As if he were not still her child  Too wise to hate the one he wanted Too fond to pity her he scorned   Babette Deutsch  Her hours like his own were haunted By devils that might well have daunted A monster likewise hoofed and horned  The first meeting his mother knew her A woman very like her own The second wondered how to woo her While ever seeking to eschew her Fearful of what she must have known  And so their days were all one tangle Of this one dropped and that one dared While he from his peculiar angle Half wished that loneliness might strangle What they so curiously shared  OVERTONES  Keep up your talk There is no need for silence now I am content to listen and watch you now Your voice stops while you walk  You move about And toss back from your brow The lock that always falls across your brow Your grin is tinged with doubt  Einstein and art And ranching it goes on somehow   Don t stop or it will be too much somehow And you will hear my heart  REFLECTIONS  Your eyes were strange with sorrow were there tears That touched their color to such troubled light Those mirrors wherein mine had shone so bright Refused the image looking on the years Like naked runners running upon spears That showed so impotently few tonight The pageant of a passion men requite With death and freedom whose chief wage is fears  I would have outstared sorrow in your eyes But looking on them mine reflected yours As the most lucid pool shows stormy skies Cloud facing cloud when deepest calm endures And though my lips had drunk your bitter wine You would have tasted bitterer touching mine  KNOWLEDGE  Now there is no confusion in our love For you are there With the big brow the cheek of tougher grain The rougher greying hair And I am here with a woman s throat and hands We are apart and different   Babette Deutsch  And there is something difference understands That peace knows nothing of It is the pain in pleasure that we seek To kill with kisses and revive With other kisses For by our hurt we know we are alive  The tides return into the salty sea And the sea fingered rocks are swept and grey There are no secrets where the sea has crept But the sea Has kept its ageless mystery And we Beaten by the returning passional tides Searched by the stabbing fingers Washed and lapped and worn by the old assault Knowing again The bitterness of the receding wave With renewed wonder facing the old pain We are as close As one wave fallen upon another wave We are as far As the sky s star from the sea shaken star  Love is not the moon Pulling the whole sea up to her And there is something darkness understands These moons know nothing of  Babette Deutsch   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FOUR POEMS  IN THE BARN o  The sun in wanton pride Drenches the country side With spilt gold from his old autumnal store But Scipio sits within the barn s thick gloom The merest crack of light coming in the door Sits and husks the corn long after working hours Vainly for him the autumn bloom Is on the flowers The inside of the barn is velvet black Except where a gold thread runs along a crack And the inquisitive sun thrusts points of light Through chink and cranny piercing the midnight The dry husks rattle and his shuffling feet Keep time to what he sings an elusive tune Husky and monotonous and sweet Scarce audible so softly does he croon To keep away the evil eye  Everybody Who is livin Got to die  Across the evening fields the setting sun Richly intones toil done The home bound negroes idle in the lanes Gossiping as they go coarse laughter falls   Josephine Pinckney  On the resonant air from a far field cat calls Float over and a banjo s strains Shucking corn in the darkness Scipio in reply Sits and sings his mournful husky stave  Wid a silver spade You kin dig my grave Everybody Who is livin Got to die  STRANGE  We believed That the tides of our being Set to each other  But when we came to speak There was a distance between us More wide and strange Than the silvery waste Of the marsh under the moon  And your voice came From that untrodden stillness Like the calling of some marsh creature Disturbed seeking  And I too was dumb frozen Like the flood tide And moon silent marsh   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE OUTCAST  Into the valleys I flee into the shadows But there is no peace no sanctuary The hills like elephants Shoulder noiseless through the clouds And close in on me Where shall I hide from the tread of their feet  I have overset the gods in the temples and there is none  to protect me The little gods of jade with staring eyes The great gold and black gods with foolish faces  Tell me little gods of the North and East and of the  South and West How long shall my bones wait lying on these rocks To become as white as the broken plaster Of the images in the temple Tell me true gods Speak a swift word For the clouds descend in a hot white mist of wrath And through them stamp the elephants The terrible elephants Trumpeting   SWAMP LILIES  Today I feel new born for I have seen A stretch of cloistered wood thick spread with green   Josephine Pinckney  Where wet wild lilies grew on every side Streaming away an immobile white tide Not as the sun that bursts upon our eyes At morning making glory of the skies But like the slow pervading evening light They filled the eye a world of silvery white Withdrawn and exquisite as from the sod They breathed the still inviolateness of God  Josephine Pinckney  FORGOTTEN  How can I remember Autumn and pain When trees hold dreams In their arms again  How can my heart break Till it cries The joy of summer Has made me wise  I can t remember What hurt me so Autumn and winter Were so long ago  Harold Vinal   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NUMBERS  Three sheep graze on the low hill  Beneath the shadow of five trees Three sheep Five old sycamores  The noon is very full of sleep The noon s a shepherd kind and still The noon s a shepherd takes his ease Beneath the shadow of five trees  Five old sycamores Three sheep graze on the low hill Down in the grass in twos and fours Cows are munching in the field Three sheep graze on the low hill Bless them Lord to give me wool Cows are munching in the field Bless them that their teats be full Bless the sheep and cows to yield Wool to keep my children warm Milk that they should grow therefrom  Three sheep graze on the low hill Beneath five sycamores Cows are munching in the field All in twos and fours  On an elm tree far aloof There are nine and twenty crows   Louis Golding  Croaking to the blue sky roof Fifteen hundred ancient woes  In a cracked deserted house Six owls cloaked with age and dream In a cracked deserted house Six owls wait upon a beam Wait for the nocturnal mouse  In the stackyard at my farm There are fourteen stacks of hay  Lord I pray Keep my golden goods from harm Fourteen shining stacks of hay  Fourteen shining stacks of hay Six owls nine and twenty crows Three sheep grazing on the hill  Beneath five sycamores Fat cows munching in a field  All in twos and fours Fat cows munching in a field Fourteen shining stacks of hay  At a table in a room Where beyond the window frames Glows the sweet geranium At a table in a room My three children play their games Till their father poet come   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Stop a moment listen wait Till a father poet come Lovely ones of lovely names He shall not come late  Fourteen shining stacks of hay Six owls nine and twenty crows Fifteen hundred ancient woes Three sheep grazing on the hill  Beneath five sycamores Fat cows munching in a field  All in twos and fours Fourteen shining stacks of hay My three lovely children one Mother laughing like the sun Sweetheart laughing like the sun  When the baby laughters run  Now the goal I sought is won Sweetheart laughing like the sun Now the goal I sought is won  Sweet my song is done  Louis Golding   O CHANGING ONE  Sometimes O changing one Your feet are like white foam Riding the long blue rhythms of my thought Like foam on a subsiding lake In the hour next before sunset  And sometimes your feet are leaves Red from the first frost Whirling into the corners of my mind Whirling into the sunlight again Dancing chaotic Gay in their brief autumn  But sometimes Your feet are like black velvet And you move without sound within the shadows You circle the firelight of my thought And I by the red fire that fights the shadows Wonder what prey you seek I not wholly at ease  William A Norris   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  GOLDEN DARKNESS  THERE WAS A TIME  There was a time when I was shy and lonely And stood in strange bewilderment apart And no one spoke to me and silence only Would fold my songs into her tender heart  There was a time when only windy darkness Would fan my dreams with glamoured loveliness But you have come and nights are filled with starkness And I am lonely for my loneliness  Oh you have come and silence is a stranger And darkness keeps aloof from my distress And you oh you are all too fraught with danger And I am lonely for my loneliness  CLOUDS AND WAVES  With bent heads hidden the clouds run by Muffled in shadow across the sky  With lowered eyes in the darkness of the sea The hunched lean waves scud away fearfully  How great is the wrong and where is the place What is the truth that they cannot face   Oscar Williams  COBWEBS  Rise in the cool dim dawn When a mist is hung on the pane The loose gray cobweb of the fog Spun by the rain  When the sun s long golden fingers Have brushed it away then go And watch the sky through the tree tops Fall like snow  And after when you are tired And twilight hangs on the leaves Listen and the silence will tell you Why it grieves  For the fog the sky and the twilight Are the cobwebs that brush the eyes When a man would enter the dusty door Of paradise  GREY  A bleak wind rides on the waves And the shadowy foam is hurled Grey rains are on the hills And a grey dusk is over the world  Bleak moods and shadowy moods Move like the moods of the sea   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The mist a grey unspoken thought Is looking strangely at me  And I am lost in greyness My dreams are still and furled For the grey rains are on the hills And a grey dusk is over the world  RAINS  In the country the rain comes softly with timid feet A grey silence is in her face and strands of darkness blowing from her hair And trees are dark in her eyes and the wind is a mournful gesture  Softly the rain comes over the hills and her face is memory  It is filled with the twilight blowing of waves and grasses  It is filled with shadowy cloud paws feeling among the valleys  It is filled with the leap of trees that are instantly caught by the earth  The spirit of all things breathes on the invisible pane of time  And slowly out of the shadows the grey face of the rain comes into being  Softly the rain comes over the hills and her face is sorrow  But the rain in the city is a jazz rain The legs of the rain in the city are nimble   Oscar Williams  She is loud on the stones on the roof tops on the windows  Her dancing is filled with the sway and the glitter of tinsel  Behind her the street is a wide grin showing the black teeth of houses The street is a wicked leer dark with ugly passion But though the laughter of the jazz rain is coarse in the gutter  Though her legs are nimble and innumerable on the pavements Though the jazz rain speaks so loud The brazen rain has never a word for me  THE GOLDEN FLEECE  I know that life is Jason  And that beauty is the witch maiden helping him  I know that the soft luminous night of stars Is the golden fleece he is seeking I know that in the beginning  He sowed the boulders the teeth of dead ages  And the innumerable armored cities have arisen I know that he has thrown among them love and desire  And they have warred and shall war with each other until the end And if you doubt the least word I have said Come out on the dark beach some strange summer night And watch the huge quivering serpent of the ocean Still coiled around the trunk of the tree of paradise   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  BECAUSE  Because I have not kissed as yet one burning mouth  I have kissed a hundred Because I have not looked into one pair of eyes A hundred have haunted me  Because I have not lived one hour in passion s flame I have died in a hundred others  MOTES  The stars are mystical motes Delicately glimmering In blue sunlight I move my hand Through the elfin radiance And my fingers are strange With dream and glamour  THE SUBWAY IS LIT  The subway is lit like a great cathedral And myriad shadows whisper and float But the eyes of darkness are filled with fury And a scream of steel is in the wind s throat The trains are moving like things of madness And the eyes of men have a glassy stare Where is the music of holiness And where the uplifted face of a prayer   Oscar Williams  THE BUBBLE  We have kings and the deadly sins seven We have lives for all things that die We have wars and quite a bit of trouble But God ensconced in his heaven Watches through air blue as sky And delights in his beautiful bubble  THE RETURN  In some far and lonely midnight I shall arise as in a dream And part dark curtains on a strange room Where mysterious candles gleam  I shall open an unknown book In that weird and wind stirred place And come upon a poem With a sad face  I shall listen to my dead heart s cry Faint through the years that are gone And I shall feel over my shoulder The Silence looking on  And very softly he will touch me And I shall turn toward the gloom He will take my arm and quietly Lead me out of the room  Oscar Williams  POETRY A Magazine of Verse COMMENT HERE IN CASS STREET  WE should like to pass on to our readers a more liberal share of the life of the POETRY office to introduce them to our extremely varied callers show them scraps of our still more varied correspondence let them read our contradictory clippings And if only the seal of confidence could be removed we should make them laugh by printing a few of our museum features poems so amusingly bad that we could not bear to send them back without making copies for preservation  One day for example the arriving editor discovers so to speak a foundling on the door step a young poet from New York or Oklahoma who has started out to see the world with a few dollars in his pocket and who must find some kind of a job in State Street or La Salle to keep him fed and housed and to oil the wheels of his journey Again an elderly poet adventurer appears fresh from prison where he had been tangled up in some friend s attempt at counterfeiting a lank starveling figure the gaunt picture of despair but offering to the editor s surprise two or three acceptable poems and leaping alive even to a smile at the actual receipt of a check Or a rainy morning is brightened with color by the visit of two quite astonishingly superb English ladies a poet and her sister who are speeding through the town   Here in Cass Street  with their uncle Sir Kenneth Somebody and who leave us edition de luxe books and Queen of Sheba memories  Helen Hoyt once gave us a guest book it was while she was still Helen Hoyt two years before her bridal New Year s day of 1921 when she became Mrs William Whittingham Lyman out in California and took up her abode in Berkeley Let us look over its entries since Christmas and pause a moment with a few of the visitors  There are Henry Bellamann and Glenn Ward Dresbach just before the turn of the year Southern poets both the one from South Carolina and the other New Mexico Mr Bellamann a musician as well as president of the Columbia Poetry Society and Mr Dresbach an efficiency expert a rare talent for a poet who had been making copper efficacious at Tyrone And with the new year comes Edward Sapir from Ottawa where he has been gathering and translating French Canadian folk songs And bluff black bearded Jo Davidson sculptor of all the war heroes draws his inky portrait in the book And little Winifred Bryher writes her slender name there the quiet English girl author who was even then on her way to New York to surprise her friends by marrying Robert McAlmon  Sara Bard Field the warrior suffragette from California and Nora Douglas Holt the beautiful bronze colored founder and editor of the new and interesting Negro organ Music and Poetry these two are neighbors in the book A week later comes John Drinkwater and at the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  end of March Franklin P Adams the St Simeon Stylites of the New York Tribune Next Clinton Masseck now of Kansas erstwhile a warrior in the most fiery battle line of the Argonne A few days later it is Nicolas Roerich the big brained high souled Russian painter and dreamer whose pictures are a more vivid revelation than Lenin s politics and whose poems if we could get at them in the three or four books he has published may be as full of color and vitality  And so it goes The correspondence is more full of contrasts possibly than the visitors Bits of it come from remote corners of the earth but most of it bears George Washington s familiar red portrait on the envelope The editor is asked not only to criticize poems that is an obvious and common request but to advise about publishers to prepare club programs to write an article on Florence Kiper Frank or Haniel Long for the benefit of some college student s thesis to reveal the author of some wandering poem usually an incredibly poor one to save some hapless poet from starvation or get him out of jail to pass judgment on some elaborate system of psycho analysis or on some meticulous questionnaire which is to reveal with mathematical accuracy the ability of students in a certain great university to judge poetry a questionnaire which so befuddles the editor s brain that judging poetry becomes a madhouse dance These are but a few of the demands put forth by acquisitive minds sometimes of marvellous ingenuity and still more marvel   Here in Cass Street  lous confidence in the editor s lavishness of time interest and spirit to meet them  The poets themselves are usually more reasonable than these questioners who are studying or writing about them Of course now and then the ego flaps its wings and temperament becomes temper but on the whole they are tolerant of the editor s short comings and astonishingly patient during that too long period which usually divides acceptance from publication They are very different these poets one an I W W coal miner another a bedridden invalid in New Zealand number three a fine lady in the smartest of smart sets number four a plantation Negro in Georgia number five a Syrian rug dealer number six a live wire reporter on the New York Scald seven a corporation lawyer eight a little crippled seamstress sewing and writing in a wheeled chair nine a lovely red haired siren the heroine of an hundred romances ten a lonely spinster inaccessible in her emotional desert eleven a half mad starveling whose little gleam of genius may be extinguished by niggardly denial of light and air and food for body and soul and twelve fortune s favorite whose gleam may be extinguished by the sheer mass and weight of his possessions and opportunities And there are the married and the single the too much married and too little the much divorced and the undivorced and the careless few who get on without any of these formalities  In short there are today five hundred and ninety six   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  names in POETRY S card index of accepted poets and a history thrilling but never to be fully revealed goes with each card Nearly a score of nationalities are represented either directly or through immigration and forty one of our forty eight states besides the District of Columbia and Hawaii One of the severest shocks of the editor s career is the discovery that Indiana is not among them Are there no poets left in Riley s own state the state where they were wont to foregather and go on pilgrimages Or have the poets of Indiana one and all boycotted POETRY Anyway Indiana is missing from our list along with Delaware Idaho North Dakota Mississippi North Carolina and Utah  It s a long and crowded trail we have travelled these eight and a half stirring years H M  THE NEBRASKA LAUREATE  The legislature of the state of Nebraska has fitly honored its most conspicuous poet citizen by appointing him Poet Laureate of the state Mr Neihardt earns this distinction not only by his artistic achievement in general but also by the fact that as the resolution puts it he has written a national epic wherein he has developed the mood of courage with which our pioneers explored and subdued our plains and thus has inspired in Americans that love of the land and its heroes whereby great national traditions are built and perpetuated   The Nebraska Laureate  We congratulate Nebraska upon its gracious decree and Mr Neihardt upon the official appreciation of his state The appreciation might have been further emphasized by a salary or some form of financial award but perhaps that is too ideal an expression of truly poetic justice to expect at present  We have criticized Mr Neihardt s artistic principles and methods in the writing of his epic narratives but a difference of opinion in detail does not prevent our appreciation of his artistic sincerity and quality and of the value of his exploration of a field too little recognized in the arts It will be remembered that one volume of the projected trilogy The Song of Three Friends shared last year with the Poems of the late Gladys Cromwell first honors in the  P S A prize award for the best book of verse published by a poet of the United States during the year 1919  The New York Evening Mail discovers subtle Sinn Fein propaganda in the new Nebraska laureateship This would seem to be straining a point even if Mr Neihardt were an Irishman which no one ventures to allege of a poet born in Illinois of middle western ancestry However this laureateship is not quite the first the Nebraska State Journal to the contrary notwithstanding for in 1919 the legislature of California bestowed a similar honor upon Miss Ina Coolbrith in declaring her by official decree The Loved Laurel crowned Poet of California  H M REVIEWS  A CENSUS SPIRITUAL  Domesday Book by Edgar Lee Masters Macmillan Co  Mr Masters is both a lawyer and a poet a fact which has advantages and disadvantages As a lawyer it makes him one of the shrewdest most keenly imaginative cross examiners who ever turned inside out the soul of an unfortunate witness and on the other hand it probably tempts him away from legal drynesses and asperities As a poet it gives him a comprehensive and sympathetic experience of the innards of life the human motives and processes enforcing upon him respect for the truth for all the aspects and values in any given case and on the other hand it carries these qualities too far toward absolute legal justice involving the precision and prolixity of an argument or brief with its thorough and searching statements of all aspects of a given question  The mere use of a ten syllable iambic line through hundreds of pages of course does not make a poem it may as well be admitted that many of these monologues are throughout the baldest prose and that even the finest of them have passages which strain the rather liberal amenities usually accorded to the epic bard Indeed a more exacting taste would have struck out quite a number the statements of people whose tangent touch upon Elenor Murray was too remote to be artistically relevant  However after granting the numerous and manifest   A Census Spiritual  deductions Domesday Book establishes its epic claim Not by accomplishing its specific charge to be  a census spiritual Taken of our America  although perhaps it comes nearer than any other book to such a prodigious achievement but by the sheer immensity and weight of its masses the depth and richness of its colors all thrown together into a rough shapeliness and charged with a rude glamour like a mountain lifted against the sunset fires of the sky The mountain has not been molded and perfected by art in all details it is faulty yet there it stands of a truth and beauty formidable and unquestionable  Mr Masters book whether a complete census spiritual or not is life modern life unfaltering uncompromising and unashamed not a mere photograph moreover but a transfigured vision presenting the beauty and terror inherent in the human tragedy in our modern human tragedy which always seems half wrought out infinitely complicated unachieved a thing to laugh as well as to weep Like all artists of power and sweep this poet neither palliates nor apologizes He carries his heroine and her friends through deeds of vulgar disrepute and even crime and yet brings them out unbereft of piteous dignity and beauty He accepts all with understanding and sympathy for human frailty and aspiration  Certain of the actors in the ever widening circles of this drama confess themselves with ruthless precision so that   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  we know them completely and recognize their hard dilemma Henry Murray for example the ineffectual father who sees his girl slipping away and agonizes because he is powerless to hold her  This daughter and myself while temperaments Kept us at swords points while I saw in her Traits of myself I liked not also traits Of the child s mother which I loathe because They have undone me  And Gregory Wenner futile both as business man and lover And Gottlieb Gerald absorbed in making pianos and dreams And the slap dash Alaska man and the cheaply second rate Barrett

Half disciplined half lettered crude and smart Enslaved yet wanting freedom brave and coarse Cowardly shabby hypocritical Generous loving noble full of prayer Scorning embracing rituals recreant To Christ so much professed adventuresome Curious mediocre venal hungry For money place experience restless no Repose restraint before the world made up To act and sport ideals go abroad To bring the world its freedom having choked Freedom at home the girl was this because These things were bred in her she breathed them in Here where she lived and grew   A Census Spiritual  Yet that word however searching is not all One of the jurymen protests  Look at her she s brave Devoted loyal true and dutiful She s will to life and through it senses God And seeks to serve the cosmic soul  And with all potencies clamorous but impotent within her giving herself away generously passionately but always wastefully she passes by and goes out like a little flickering torch borne by Fate through the high winds of Time  Does the poet prove his thesis Does he make this girl restless sterile erotic but somehow clinging to even while violating a certain integrity of soul a symbol of our country of tireless searching immense achievement and fertile dreams Probably most of us will deny the authority and completeness of the picture probably the most searching critical challenge to this epic bard would be a demand for a hero or heroine for a single luminous soul to whom our hope and faith might cling The heroic is found in life and in all the great epics of the past Perhaps it is not justly evident here  However whether we grant the main thesis or not the book has immensity of scope and power It is a modern tale of psychological adventure grouping somewhat with The Ring and the Book no

poet of profound experience and insight H M  LITTLE THEATRE RHYTHMS  Plays for Merry Andrews by Alfred Kreymborg Sunwise  Turn New York  There are certain Broadway critics using the term generically who decry the potentialities of the Little Theatres because they do not function like Big Theatres Without considering the medium or the plays written and produced through this medium these critics damn them as piffling It will require a new hatch of critics to handle this art of the Little Theatre  Because a small group gathers to hear subtleties in humor minute shadings in tone experiments in rhythms to concentrate on complexities or relax to simplicities one may not necessarily infer that its blood is thin A healthy audience functions in various ways it does not always wear its heart on its sleeve or stand in a ten acre lot to hear its soul bellowed to the highways  Alfred Kreymborg s soul would feel cramped in a ten acre lot whereas it expands in intimacy He has accepted the Little Theatre as his natural medium accepted it also as a form of art to be expressed through poetry music and dance We have here no note book jottings from real life dialogue heard in passing sketch life class work In the Plays for Merry Andrews the use of sug   Little Theatre Rhythms  gestion is not so remote as with many of the Fifth Avenue school of opacity In a play the poet must consider that the auditor does not register with the same concentration as the reader Mr Kreymborg s simplicity appears to be guileless but there is always the suggestion under his naive surfaces His rhythms and images are easy to imitate but not his charm and his humor and to capture his agile handling of suggestion is a challenge the quiet glance with a keen edge back of it which points up to a dart and shoots through so deftly that we are unaware of its awareness  In the matter of rhythm he is not an eye poet He is a musician arranging and combining words as notes and musical phrases He writes gavottes scherzos minuets and fugues and he sings and dances his thoughts about the stage Often his verbal attempts at polyphonic musical forms result only in the husk of tone His words do not always vibrate but on the whole there is a blending of tone through the combining of vibrations from his succession of sounds His rhythms riot in their variety through all of his plays which helps to promote the feeling of dance When his staccato verges on the monotonous he gives it a fillip with a sudden turn or lift One culminating effect which he uses is to lead us up to the height of expectancy and leave his suggestion suspended in mid air while we go soaring on the impetus  The rhythms of his prose are neither intentionally odd nor intentionally dark they are patterned to   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  express his whimsical personality according to the varied meanings of his fanciful plot Take a passage of staccato from Vote the New Moon The citizens are voting they are definite and determined and although their hammers have been dropped the concise rapping is continued in the speech  Crier Burgher what do you mean by One for the red  Burgess you by One for the blue Burgher I mean Burgess I mean Crier What do you mean Burgher We mean Burgess We re tired Crier Tired Burgher Of old moons Burgess We want Crier You want Duo A new moon  He also uses his staccato to convey his numerous sprightly moods Again in Vote the New Moon the harmonized resolve to vote for the purple is expressed in a fine blending of resounding vibration  Burgher One for the purple Burgess One for the purple Burgher One for the purple Burgess One for the purple  ending in a strong chord from the Crier  Crier Blasphemous  Although this volume is freer from the fault shown in his earlier group of Poem Mimes the fault of assembling   Little Theatre Rhythms  poems more or less related into a play instead of conceiving the play as a whole poem in quality it falls short of the earlier book which is consistently fanciful poetic musical The Plays for Merry Andrews is made up of two plays in this earlier manner Vote the New Moon and Monday whose quality is up to his standard while they have developed in form The two attempts to mix the reality of farce and burlesque with the fanciful result in At the Sigil of the Thumb and Nose and Uneasy Street Of these the first is the more successful the second being a rather doubtful experiment for the Little Theatre The bulk of the coffin would crowd the humor off the boards It begins in irony and ends in farce The first half is nicely pointed and balanced but this is lost in the later confusion of a rather commonplace dialogue and a bizarre ending The Silent Waiter is a topic discussed with some new angles but it is not a good play The handling of the window panels the hands and the headless waiter while piquing the interest at first proves tricky The end of the discussion is trite  The danger of the subtleties of the Little Theatre becoming effete is obvious but then there is the danger of the Big Theatre becoming banal The two theatres cannot be paralleled they are two different mediums  Alfred Kreymborg s danger lies in his facility to sing to be whimsical to charm in the temptation to spread his material too thin and caper for the fun of capering  Laura Sherry   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NIGHTMARE FINGERS  Resurrecting Lije by Michael Strange Alfred A Knopf Clair de Lune by Michael Strange G P Putnam s Sons The New York Times quoted on the jacket of the first  of these books recommends it as follows Michael Strange is a signature underneath which can always be found images phrases the embodiment in colorful words of things seen or felt or thought so unusual and so outstanding that they strike the attention at once and remain in the memory  Benjamin De Casseres says of it  The poems of Michael Strange do not fly to the eyes They touch you remotely at first as with nightmare fingers You go back to study them to concentrate on them to marry them  In the light of such praise it is only fair to give an  example  O those vast limbs in the chrysalis of me  O this titanic aerial being so fettered yet  In the slime of my defective understanding  This God with spheres nestling in His palm  Asleep in me yet  And veiled in the stupor of my fear of things  Concerning this one tiny world  However in case one quotation is insufficient and because the poems have as yet only touched us with nightmare fingers whereas someone else may want to marry them it may be reassuring to quote Vision in its entirety  I will follow the inward chime Back through empurpling cups of concave hills Back through a swaying clot of drowned faces   Nightmare Fingers  All fastened and by nightmare pain into the sedges of memory Back through those negative rivers stilled past egress And out at last beyond brightening grasses Grasses rushing up into hills peaks And up through these through a fume of clouds aye at last into ether Ether bright with those silver tracks of planet visiting angels And austerely fragrant from the trailing of their doom lined scarves Aye out into ether humming from the dart of stars Shaken by a choral thunder Until at last appearing among arching naves These ascending in architectural jet And arrested in vast foaming coils of livid lace And where enlarging at the farthest end of distance The Eucharist chromatic rayed And holding forth its Mystic Tenant Of Transfigured Rest  Clair de Lune the play by this author which John Barrymore produced recently in New York is at least written in prose Marion Strobel  THE SILVER STALLION  Young Girl and Other Poems by Hildegarde Flanner with an introduction and decorations by Porter Garnett  H S Crocker Co San Francisco Poems

Henry Bellamann  Poetry Book Shop New York  Wading through these young first books reminded me of a time I had last summer looking for a run away horse in the Maine woods The silver stallion appears for an instant now and then but it is an uncomfortable business looking for him through the uncouth growths  Possibly Hildegarde Flanner offers us freer and wider glimpses through the leaves of her little volume Indeed her book is a small wood of white birch trees pale and slender and frail The poems are delicate and in This Morning she offers us a moment like this  After the emotion of rain The mist parts across the morning Like the smile of one Who has laughed in sleep And cannot remember why  There is a quaint simplicity in Discovery but in the main the book lacks music though one finds a hint of music and even strength in Communion Young Girl received last year the Emily Chamberlain Cook Prize at the University of California and she is almost if not entirely worthy of the beautiful dress and golden ornaments which Porter Garnett and the Crocker Company have so generously given her  Mr Austin s Poems for Men if more virile are full of a cold reserve and a traditional and hampering growth of words and coming as they do in the newer and freer   The Silver Stallion  forms they are but the wolf in sheep s clothing The book is studied stuff impersonal and unstirring but in the rhyming verses the poet confesses a little and in A Bedroom one comes on  The fancied forest of Desire Among whose unseen leaves Flits the golden feathered bird  I have read and re read Star drift and Poems and Essays trying to be convinced that they are poetry I cannot doubt that Mr O Seasnain and Mr Hitch appreciate the glittering of great cities at night and the beauty of a dawn over the mountains I cannot doubt that the wonder of earth has a word for them that they have ideas that Mr O Seasnain is furious with the littlenesses of life and that Mr Hitch sees his old age with its white hair a signal of distress white flag of surrender and is sometimes struck with the futility of his own too many words But what has all this to do with the great silver stallion whose hoof beats are shaking the unknown winds like curtains over the hills  Somewhat removed from forests and the mythological silver stallion is Miss Kueffner s Moods of Manhattan In Afterword she begs us not to ask Is it prose is it verse And we shall spare her the inconvenience of asking her Is it poetry We shall not compare or contrast her with Whitman or Sandburg whom she has obviously imitated and the only little comment we make is that her work is very much like Oppenheim at his worst   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The Blue Crane by Ivan Swift is crammed with respectability and politeness and a triteness that sometimes washes its face Old fashioned words like yon thy full sure are found all over the book And for Mr Swift A quiet place is full of eloquent whispers a tree is a trim sentry and I fain would laugh if you please  Captain Harry Lee probably realizes that his High Company is shredded prose as he subtitles it Sketches Some of these are good war sketches simple and sincere and there is sympathy and drama in Winged Heels Others are sentimental and melodramatic and through the whole book runs the so called free verse style of certain cigarette advertisements John Burroughs who in a recent issue of Current Opinion called Mr Sandburg s poetry Bolshevic trash wrote on the cover of High Company These poems have great merit they strike me as about the best free verse poetry I have seen  I have saved the last book for a little relief One finds in Mr Bellamann s poems a precision and a choice of words that give a mood without any fringes or muddle mist and moonshine as in Yellow Leaves  Yellow leaves among the green Like gold coins Deep in old fountains  In Dans Le Sillage the poet touches off some of his contemporaries There s Fletcher Painting with frost On silk watered like an opal sea   The Silver Stallion  Amy Lowell rides like Joan Under colored banners Flashing a thousand lights From her two edged sword  Ezra Pound mutters darkly Behind a Chinese veil  And here one strikes the gravest fault in the book there is too much of Fletcher Amy Lowell and Ezra Pound in the poems  If these first books are a bit discouraging still The winds are neighing Amid the monotonous hills  and the silver stallion may be not far away  Oscar Williams  WHO WRITES FOLK SONGS  Poetic Origins and The Ballad by Louise Pound Macmillan Co Just when and how the theory of the communal origin  of folk song and hence of poetry itself came to be evolved I do not know But for many years students of folk lore have held tenaciously to the idea that folk poetry is of crowd origin i e the spontaneous improvisation of many minds preferably during a dance or some community festival  The idea is very like and no doubt based upon that similar play instinct theory of the origin of art a theory which saw nothing incongruous in the analogy between creative effort and a sportive calf s jumping   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To me the belief that the genesis of poetry or of rhythm was in the hand clapping and thigh slapping of primitive people during a dance has always seemed unnecessarily far fetched As if man were outside creation and some special arbitrary means had to be devised for inculcating in him the laws of that world of which he is a part And also how account then for the genesis of space rhythm Did the primitive potter and artist evolve their volumes and lines to a similar bodily accompaniment And should the artist today who wishes to regain the old simplicity take a twirl or two and jump like Nijinsky between each stroke that he gives to his canvas  Miss Pound does not attempt to explain psychologically the beginnings of poetry Her method is historical and she adheres very strictly to the task she has set herself which is to show that the classic English and Scotch ballads such as are preserved in the Percy and Child collections could be only the work of individual poets and not of a crowd or festal throng and that the accepted belief in the communal origin of folk poetry thus falls down so far as it is based specifically upon these ballads Miss Pound then uses the evidence of the living folk poetry nearest at hand that of the American Indian the Negro and the cowboy to show that it too is almost always of individual authorship and most markedly inferior when presumably it is not but that it is in any case of a character essentially different from the Child ballads these latter being of a much higher artistic   Who Writes Folk songs  order and obviously the work of individual poets above the peasant average whether in that time or this  One chapter seems to me to be missing from Miss Pound s book which would make it finally conclusive a chapter on the medieval troubadours of the Continent With this as a background the conviction that the Percy and Child ballads must have been the work of individual authors who held as stock in trade the poetic traditions of an older guild of minstrels and entertainers would be inescapable  Apart from the specific problem of comparison involved Miss Pound s summary of the origins of our indigenous folk poetry is exceedingly interesting Beginning with the poetry of the American Indian she shows that the individual poet is as well known in the most primitive tribe as in our own more sophisticated society and that there is no evidence that Indian poetry although communally sung is so composed She shows also that many of the Negro spirituals are based upon the white man s hymns from which their form and substance are largely derived Thus although the individual authorship of the spirituals may be lost sight of their parentage at least is not of crowd origin and the additions made by the Negro congregation in singing these songs are mostly in the nature of refrain  As for the American cowboy songs for which Mr Lomax has claimed a communal origin Miss Pound shows that almost all of these are of known authorship although   she does not on this account deny their genuine folk character nor as Professor Gerould in the New York Evening Post implies discount them as mere derelicts because they have been based upon earlier songs or adapted to familiar tunes On this score one would have to call many of Burns poems mere derelicts and discard with them as well a large body of accepted folk songs  But Miss Pound s définition of folk poetry is perhaps wider than many folk lore scholars will accept She says  All types of song are folk songs for the literary historian which fulfil two tests the people must like them and sing them they must have lived in the folk mouth and they must have persisted in oral currency through a fair period of years They must have achieved an existence not dependent upon a printed original Whatever has commended itself to the folk consciousness and has established currency for itself apart from written sources is genuine folk literature  By this she does not mean of course that the song must never have had a printed origin but that it must have become independent of this by being transplanted into the folk memory If the folk lore scholars object to the inclusiveness of this definition they will have to admit that many of their own restrictions would if collectively applied rule out practically the whole body of accepted folk song including the classic English ballads  Thus if known authorship discounts the term folkpoetry then the poetry of the American Indian is not folk poetry If printed sources are not allowed then all the old ballads collected in broadsides or chap books must go If the fact that The Cowboy s Lament was adapted   Who Writes Folk songs  from a popular Irish song of the eighteenth century makes its folk pretensions insecure then Barbara Allen which was also a stage song will have to be discarded In fact if all the arbitary barbed wire fences of the folk lorists are heeded what will be left of the open range of folk song The professor of folk song like the melancholy cowboy will have to go  We are faced then with the necessity of accepting a wider definition of folk song or we may be brought to the pass of confessing that there is no such thing there is only poetry of various kinds Also it may as well be admitted that folk songs are as diversified in character as any other kind of poetry and it is impossible to make any one type the norm to which all other examples must conform Certainly the classic English ballads can not as is too often done be made the touchstone of what is or is not folk poetry Theirs is a highly specialized form their authors were undoubtedly fairly sophisticated poets and we have every right to believe that the ballads became folk songs by the well known process of descent  In other words we must recognize two broad sources of folk song one of the soil as with genuinely primitive people like the American Indian though none the less of individual origin and the other of the stage the church the court or the city descending again to the soil and the folk there to be rediscovered as folk song  Such ideas as these presented by Miss Pound are sufficiently radical to meet much opposition from the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  adherents of the accepted belief in the communal crowd origin of folk song But just one thing is needed from Miss Pound s opponents to prove her theory a house of cards and that is some evidence of a crowd or group improvisation of the ballads or of any poetry higher than the nursery rhyme type used in games Did anyone ever see it happen A C H CORRESPONDENCE  PROFESSOR PHELPS AND ROSTAND  My dear POETRY William Lyon Phelps has set my nerves cringing is it possible that a Yale University professor should write the silly pompous windy stuff about Edmond Rostand which appears in the April Yale Review  What a pity when the whole world is trying to get a clear insight into things to read such trashy stuff Fortunately we know better but some Frenchmen may judge American criticism and clearness of perception by Mr Phelps oracular utterances Note the wisdom of this  Creative genius is the most valuable gift that man can receive Isn t this a wonderfully stamped medal He is a poet and a playwright but above all he is a magician But I wouldn t care about Mr Phelps platitudes if he didn t pretend to judge France and French drama with the same sweeping alacrity I shall not trouble you with a reply en forme Suffice it to say that nobody here with    Professor Phelps and Rostand  a sane mind thinks Rostand a national poet and that anyhow poetry had nothing to do with our aching backs our smarting feet and final triumph Nobody but dusty mediaeval people can foster such illusions  The article contains such luminous ideas as these  We must go back to La Fontaine for anything approaching the human manipulation of the animal kingdom  No modern dramatist has reached the Shakespearean level except Rostand  If Mr Phelps wants to understand our modern drama better let him come to Le Vieux Colombier with Copeau as a director to Le Theatre des Arts and a few others Let him not forget above all that what we applaud is a dozen immortal masterpieces among which we do
