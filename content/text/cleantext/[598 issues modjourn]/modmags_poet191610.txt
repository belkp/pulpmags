is seated in the theatre of his imagination After an Overture delicate and not without irony the curtain between the reader and the play is drawn upward Before him is placed a decoration in black and white a flat conventionalized design of tall white trees upon a black background This background is framed and occupies somewhat more than half the width of the stage To his left the white disc of the moon is drawn in a clear space of black sky Opposite on the branch of one of the trees is a black owl faintly outlined Beneath the trees the  Copyright 1915 by Cloyd Head Right of representation

forward from this background extending from its edge to either side of the stage is a frame of dark gauze behind which droop the Grotesques inanimate awaiting the need of them They have white faces lined with black and their arms and hands are white  Close against the background in the center stands Capul chard master of the decoration a sardonic figure with long tense fingers He is the designer And because the basis of decoration is pantomime he weaves but the minimum of words through these episodes developing them rather by curious groupings broken in outline by the mergence of white and black against the black and vhite of the background  Capulchard After a pause turning towards the Audience This is a forest that is a Grotesque You will find the forest somewhere in your thought Its trees are graphic like an arabesque The pale moon shines I touch it with my hand I dip the water from the brook beneath And fling it high among the leaves like dew The effect is there although the fact is not So shall all things here seem illusory Who cares who knows what brook is in his mind or in  yours   Grotesques  It s the quintessence only that endures The moon that clear quintessence see is split To myriad moons by the brook each moon like it The moons are washed away but there s the moon Thus with design I draw you these Grotesques For your amusement spur them into life Sign for thing signified the hieroglyph Give o er philosophy to Beldame Owl She thinks not but you think the thoughts she should How wise a counsellor if she does not hoot And break the illusion  The Owl Softly Hoot  Capulchard The idol speaks And thence the abode of wisdom is transferred Its seat is now I dare say in the moon Till sunrise Open the picture book The first design a song these be the words  Capulchard makes a sign towards the Woman who inert is behind the screen on the left She lifts her head and sings as if without consciousness  Woman Singing at left  With body enwrapped in a mantle light Softly a down the shadowy night Lo the moon neath overlaced branches white  The song pauses for a moment while he takes the Crone from behind the screen on the right gives her a staff and places her within the edge of the decoration whereof she at once becomes a part   Capulchard Resuming his former position  In counterpoint enter a stooped Grotesque  Tell where goest thou Crone Crone Crossing To a palace that s dark Capulchard The grave Crone I know not I am blind stone blind Woman Continuing her song  White birds on the white branched motionless trees Two by two Dark my steps fall faint Japanese Love am I I am hate yet know nothing of these  Capulchard Thou art old read the song She is young Crone Time is naught When it s past and the staff seeks no light o the moon Capulchard Frail withered leaf the first November wind  Exit the Crone who upon reaching the edge of the decoration becomes inert and sinks down limply behind the screen  The song full throated dark and passionate Her lover No we ll save the pencil stroke  Woman Continuing her song  My beloved awaiting me swift toward the spring  I approach Capulchard There is silence Woman The kiss that I bring Capulchard has pushed the Crone back He now lifts  the Woman clad in a dark mantle edged with white and places her at the edge of the decoration She enters   Grotesques  The kiss to the mocking voiced echoes I sing  An interval To herself in a slow monotonous voice  War m path by the stream thou art chill to night  Phantom shadows weave  She glides off right and sinks down inert  Capulchard Her voice glides past Like it was she dark sinuous delight Expressive outline bound her beauty fast Therewith she and the episode stop short Inceptive decoration play it out Each as you will the sequence unenslaved It s naught to these Grotesques unconscious strings Scraped into melody but else inert And yet why hunt your pleasure to its death Ignore the ending trace a new design Black background disc of the moon create a Sprite Whose presence makes this wood an eerie place  He goes right and lifting the Sprite a curious black and white figure brings it to the edge of the decoration There s little trick to the supernatural  Sprite Tiptoe a tread through the wood by the brook  the Sprite enters oh ho Dance crinkled stream Ha a dragon fly poised upon air  Blows Begone  Reflectively It is night  Bowing Madame Owl Hoot to whoo   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The Owl Hoot  Sprite Brisk maker of shadows clown moon  He stands grimacing at it then upon a gesture from Capulchard he begins with arms and fingers a shadow dance rapid and spontaneous but wholly conventionalized There are of course no shadows  Quick clown moon make them faster  Capulchard abruptly stops him on a posture at the extreme left  Capulchard The dance proceeds conventioned in a pose Yet the design wants counterbalance Here to the right I ll place the Girl motive  He lifts the Girl from the receptacle right and places her at the edge of the decoration giving her at the same time a conventionalized symbol representing a bird She enters in the controlled and exaggerated manner characteristic of the grotesques her movements wholly conventionalized and idyllic Her costume predominantly white remains constant through all the episodes Capulchard at once developing the possibilities of the design directs the notice of the Sprite to her  Girl To herself motionless Who am I that come Caressing tenderly the sign of bird A Girl in white alone beside the pattern brook I wander without fear of fear not having heard  Capulchard Meanwhile  Girl Upon this sward beneath these trees I rest and say   Grotesques  Sweet bird here bathe your wings where the pure white lotus flowers dream Prettily  Capulchard To the Audience  Hark the bird sings Girl With éclat With éclat Capulchard I gave her that phrase out of character  She looks  Girl Seeing the Sprite who stands hungrily erect poised to leap towards her She is struck motionless  Neath the moon   Capulchard Holding them apart in a pause which he carefully guards  Note How sensitively to the artist s will Even the minutest shade the figures drawn Respond Though tense the moment yet the crux Seems somewhat too abrupt If we instead Design her as if thralled by fantasy Bound by the spell of her own wayward longing   Her expression changes from fear to eagerness Capulchard places on her robe one or two conventionalized black leaves He then extricates the Man from among the Grotesques left gives him a bow and places him at the edge of the decoration Capulchard steps back almost invisible against the wood  Man With tread firm and taut deep through this strange wood fearless come I   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Hunter of mighty beasts by prowess conqueror else slain One arrow unsped yet left sole in my quiver  Capulchard Designing as she cowers from the Man  Having crossed he turns  But she who shuns release from love of dreams Girl Go hence Man Are you a mortal maiden that dread less  This place than Sees the Sprite Ah  Capulchard The tragic primitive Sprite Triumphantly  She s mine Come spirits Capulchard Portray ghosts by effect  Against the black Man Black ghosts White Capulchard Against white Man Recoiling  Pale phantoms four three five Girl Fright him dear dreams Capulchard Thoughtfully as the Man turns to flee  His movement outward draws discordant line Courage would make the rhythm more compact Stand therefore  Man Made to assume toward the Girl an attitude of protection which would surmount his own fear  Therefore I stand Capulchard His courage wakens love   Grotesques  Sprite Beckoning her as she turns from him  He cannot hold you  A pause then the Sprite snaps his fingers indifferently Man They are gone Sprite Forth I follow the brook to the end where a  pixie  Exit Outside the frame he falls inert Capulchard The end is not far distant either way T o left to right the picture has an edge  Girl Passing her hand across her brow  How came I to this forest  Capulchard We ll omit The anti climax princess the routine That ends all well Instead a love theme weave A tapestry of passion darker toned Placing the Woman motive in her stead Re draw the Man as Warrior  Girl Ever then  You will protect me Man From all danger Capulchard Grasping the Girl Come He replaces the Girl inanimate among the Grotesques  right then he returns to the Man who now is alone on the stage giving him a mantle and sword instead of a bow As  he does this the Man by a great unconscious effort tries to reach towards her Capulchard is surprised but smiles ironically The impulse dies   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Capulchard A mantle then a sword thus achieve  strength Intelligence rank power and the rest That give a warrior capability To lead an army to a city s gates And she the daughter of his foe  He lifts the Woman giving her a costume that suggests a princess and places her at the right edge of the decoration Capulchard To the Man Adjust to rhythm of the  new design Man The shout of battle has ceased from the darkened  plain Black swords now no more clash in a white sky Here shall I rest till dawn not victor while Their four walled city holds unvanquished  Woman Holding out her hands towards him Forth  from the citadel I bear a gift Man Would it were thou Woman Desire as thou wilt To herself of the city which love had tempted her to  betray to him  No longer am I peril of my realm  No barrier lies between my will and me Man Go lest that weary after battle I A pause which leads to a new grouping Man This bank shall be our bed  O my beloved Woman This brook shall be the music of our night   Grotesques  Man The lotus shall yield wine  O my beloved Woman Perfume of drowsiness desire Man Thou to the might of my love captive Capulchard Translate the rhythm from their words to  deeper silence None draw the erotic quite as Beardsley could Yet strange this governed transcript of a mood They cannot feel while you Disquietude Sex love The theme s not false Is it you prefer Tang always Well then chance shall wreck their love  Woman Though I am lost my realm I ve not betrayed By opening our strong walled city s gates To bring thee  Man Forcing her from him with a vitality of rhythmic line which suggests will effort  To thy realm thou shalt return Quick lock thy beauty by a thousand bars That my one longing may give armies strength To find my way to thee  Woman That strength is vain The dawn shall tell them that from thee I come  Capulchard Disaster Climax Let us turn the page New motive her as Queen the Man as one Neath even her scorn an Outlaw Meanwhile say  Woman The dawn shall tell them that from theecome And they will send me forth an outcast shamed   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Capulchard with his hand touches her as she moves to the edge of the decoration right  What art thou  Alan Stay I will spare thy realm Woman Dawn blackens  She falls inert Capulchard After a pause That every episode must  this way end Limits the rhythm like a clash of line Breaking it by mere harsh irrelevance  Man She does not answer Where  Capulchard An afterglow Searching Interpret as avoiding search Thereby our Outlaw fleeing  Man Uncertainly They hunt me Warrior Outlaw She is lost I Capulchard Concealing apprehension Let the theme Create me ex officio spectre Appear  Man Recoiling in the grotesque manner in response to a direct gesture from Capulchard  What figure tense dark robed phantom against the dark Capulchard Resuming his mastery The Outlaw baf  fled in his strength aghast Stares seemingly since he is a Grotesque And by good fortune to his self respect Insensible But with the tang you crave As I no less being vicar rhythm s restored  Man He speaks to someone Capulchard Ha Grotesques  Man As before vaguely to himself He speaks to  someone Capulchard Does the marionette grasp at its strings Man Slowly and with effort but turning directly to  wards Capulchard  You speak  Capulchard To the Audience  Howe er this lead exit waits poised  Whereby to render him inert Man With increasing persistence You speak Capulchard To those who see you make to disobey  Who come to observe that which you would resist For whose regale the decoration s wrought  The Audience Man Gods  After a moment of indecision he kneels slowly in an attitude of worship before Capulchard at a distance from him Capulchard Eh what s this Man Gods look upon us He has seen the gods Capulchard I speak with them Man Faltering They answer Capulchard After a pause They are there Man High priest Capulchard To himself not without self consciousness True I address the gods He steps aside Man Left kneeling to vacancy looks up Vanished He rises devoutly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Tis holy ground an altar I will raise  He shapes the stones into a rude altar Capulchard smiles holding the design in rhythm  I will give thanks unto our gods and plead Of them protection I am their Grotesque I will be strong and bold  Capulchard Placing the convention of fire on the altar  Not strength from you But cowardice an Outlaw they require Man With proud fear Hid in this forest at their will I lurk Capulchard The courage of the willing sacrifice The mannikin in uniform his pride  He goes right and lifting the Woman places upon her shoulders the white mantle of a Queen  At the scene s edge a crown upon her brow She stands Contrasted motives Soon shall she Recoil in terror Would you have her speak  To the Woman  I ll give you utterance of what you are  Woman A Woman in her eyes the sign of grief A Queen who walks in solitude gravely Within her heart who knows what sorrows mourn Who knows what sorrows still She comes  She sees the Man and starts back in a conventionalized Grotesques  movement suggesting dread with her body They look at one another A silence A change comes over the Woman She closes her eyes I feel a strange unfolding as from sleep  Look at me longer Man You are beautiful Woman Why do you cower from me Capulchard Without irony Puppet Queen Man Proudly Ay and the gods have me their Outlaw made Woman Re acting to the decoration  The dread of capture held his eyes to mine Man I love Woman That dagger bright wakes Capulchard Dexterously Fear Perhaps  Conscious a bit they might have further tang There s naught more pliant than a little fire Alan Helplessly Twas the gods will we ve pleased  them they Woman Alas that I am royal Man Harshly Stay Capulchard makes a gesture that separates them Woman With a gesture of great tenderness gliding back  repulses the Man  The Man looks at Capulchard  Capulchard Turn not aside to ask the obvious  Are you not Outlaw Man Trying to explain Ay the gods the gods Capulchard does not answer but places the Girl at the  edge of the decoration right With a gesture he causes the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Man in conventionalized movement to creep back into the forest left  Capulchard There was a theme had it been wise to risk That for her he had slain the King and she But no  Woman Who has started to speak to the Girl  Such was I once I will not wake her  Exit the Woman right She falls inert Capulchard Relaxing However now they are no  more extant  Dismiss them out of memory behold  Amid the night sounds of the forest enter  The Girl motive Girl Expressing fear Only the cold white trees And the silver moon and rippling thin at my feet The slender glint of the zigzag brook Clear waters fleet I alone in the darkness lost Who Is that tall Ah  Capulchard I ll hedge her with a storm  Uprise the rushing sound of wind The Owl To whoo Girl An owl cry Capulchard Blunder storm phantoms blind The Owl To whoo Girl They scream Capulchard Tis the rattle of branches Girl Save me   Grotesques  Capulchard Seek Shelter  He places a cloud pattern across the moon  Veil of the moonlight Quick ere the flashing streak White fire shall speed ignition to the clouds and form A fusion with their black genetic strength  He abruptly unrolls a sharp white streak of lightning against the sky With éclat  The storm  The Girl with highly elaborated gestures expressing fear sinks down Capulchard takes the fire from the altar Silence to imply the presence of the storm  Loud roars through the thick pouring rain thunder  At each imagined sound of thunder she trembles  Fears throng her heart terror to her supplied By your fecund imagination Girl Oh Take down the storm Capulchard Therein she doth abide As in a fortress Let the storm be past  He takes the clouds and lightning down  From shelter creep symbols of forest things Girl I now exclaim Lead me hence someone help me  I am lost Capulchard Footsteps then Girl Hark Capulchard Of whom   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Capulchard lifts the Crone placing her at the left edge of the decoration  I ll honor you with their attention As she hesitates through weariness Forth Crone I heard two voices one of them a maid  If she be young enough Where are you dear  Silence She wanders toward the right the Girl crossing frightened in rhythmic contrast  I had these words to speak are you afraid About warm love old age comes soon   A pause  I dare not leave the stream side She will learn  Teach her whoever it be Capulchard So Crone Capulchard Exit the Crone right She falls inert Girl Designed as if frightened but a little curious  What would she teach Capulchard White cheeks to flame and burn  Till all their fire is dead Girl Repeating To flame and burn  Capulchard shrugs his shoulders then striding left he  takes a handful of water drops from the brook and flings them into the sky beside the moon They become seven conventionalized white stars  Capulchard A curtain cannot be the play goes on Scene follows scene must follow without pause   Grotesques  He turns reluctantly to the Man who lies inanimate outside the frame Subtly glancing at the Audience I ll put his consciousness in fealty  He lifts the Man clothes him in a monastic garb and places him at the right edge of the decoration In his hand he places an actual brilliantly colored flower  He shall forget the Woman motive now Garbed mind has use it keeps the scene intact Alan Sometimes intoning Behold the ancient altar of  this wood I cannot quite remember yet there was Someone it was not you  Capulchard Though she is fair  Man It seems I ve journeyed here from far away From distant plains great cities o er a sea Where the waves are alternate black and white And a black sun shines in a chalk white sky Flecked by dark clouds and birds black soaring high While over the sea ride chequered ships With white sail fastened to ebon mast The ports they make are cities vast With spires minarets and domes All black and white Here first the very presence of the gods  Girl What have you in your hand Man An offering Girl Standing very close to him and looking at the  flower This flower is not real like that one   Indicating the conventionalized lotus Alan No it lives Capulchard The lotus is like time misunderstood Girl And here and there it s neither black nor white Man I know not what that is which came as I  Fashioned the petals Gift of the gods a seal  Of their benignity Girl I like the gods Alan Turning towards the Audience  The gods watch over us they guard us well They have no other thought but for our good And not a bird sign falls but they behold it Place now this flower humbly on their shrine Your hands are pure and stainless as the light Reflected to the moon and seven stars  Girl You like my hands Man His tone changing Why do I find you here Capulchard That theme has character I ll give her words Girl It is dark night and I had lost my way  But now that you are come I do not care We are alone the gods seemed so far off  She takes the flower crosses with delicate conventionalized movement to the right of the altar and kisses the flower She starts slightly but does not speak until she has placed it on the altar  The fragrance withered  Man Not heeding his words Twas acceptable Night and the stars and silence in the wood And she   Grotesques  Girl What do you mean Man I love you Girl Then  You will not do me harm Capulchard She creeps away The Alan gaining control of himself kneels penitently  beside the altar  Somewhat a climax if we quickly pass We ll take her off though that is dangerous Scenes must progress  The Girl creeps into the forest right Capulchard stands at the edge of the decoration as she falls inert Presently the Man looks up A pause  Alan In remorse Forgive me oh forgive I know that I shall never see her more Beyond this length of forest all is void How can the gods stand by and see so fair And innocent a creature perish yet Raise not one hand to help her or restrain Do they snatch joy from her unhappiness  Capulchard places the Woman at the right edge of the decoration Nay they are gods their silence must have cause Immortal life  Woman Death would not then be true The Alan turns abruptly Man Who are you that have strength to look at grief Woman I know grief s pain the memory s garnering   Capulchard Swift let the past sweep backward from their ken Completed Man They might will the past restored Did we appeal humbly   He looks in mute appeal towards the Audience A pause His hope breaks Capulchard smiles  Capulchard The gods are kind but wish to be amused Obey the decoration be not like The marionette who learned that there were strings And seeking independence severed them  A silence Capulchard has removed the monastic garb  from the Man Woman If I knowing sorrow could teach happiness Capulchard Await the tang their search will yield you  tang  Brief shall the scene be so with stress designed Man You were their answer Woman Yes She starts Gods kill at last   All moods of life in turn sweep through my heart Each sings a moment passes and is gone Like winds of evening winds of night and dawn  Man Your heart is not inconstant Woman Not my heart There is a mystery I know there waits Man Our love deep grounded in the roots of life Eternal Woman Flee I bring unhappiness   Grotesques  Capulchard Has he learned not transcience Let them  weave the theme Man One weapon craft We ll make our own design Capulchard Shadows who d swing the moon The Man draws her into a pose suggesting two lovers  This becomes the motive of the design Alan As with a glance at Capulchard she yields  Victory  Capulchard Surprised grimly How slight A breath would puff them pell mell into space And free the canvas for a different theme  Woman After a long pause  Seize in this one embrace our happiness  Swift to my lips Capulchard Designing Now duty What n importe Woman Quietly looking past the Man to Capulchard  I know that you must leave me Man Now Woman The while  That love may so be perfect ere the gods Destroy and return to find me  They move to the right edge of the decoration  Dearest Man Wait He turns aside left She smiles looking upward Her smiles becomes ecstasy  Capulchard Abruptly The tang   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He touches her upon the shoulder She steps quietly from the decoration The Man turns A very long silence Capulchard watches the design with interest  Capulchard Filling the silence Dynamic To the Man In the will lies no redress He grasps the lotus from the stream and offers it to the  Man  Taste of the lotus it s forgetfulness  The Man unconsciously in deep thought wanders into the forest left Capulchard Thus ends revolt If they should strive  once more To the lotus Re grasp the brooklet doubtless they will strive Nietzsche implies a Gòtterdàmmerung Grotesques are something that must be surpassed But you their gods for whom they are create Ultimate critics in Olympian chairs Shall laugh at their weak struggle to be gods Therefore we ll give them incarnation now Though many interludes suggest themselves War themes the Lithuania We ve warned  He takes the Woman from where she has fallen right and places her at the edge of the decoration Speaking to the Audience but she hearing  If still untamed they catch at the design First like a net it shall them close enmesh Then you may strike almighty gods by me Let her be Woman Temptress he a Knight   Grotesques  He places the Man not in a knight s costume at the left edge of the decoration The Woman crouches at the right  Man I wove a path here swiftly through the trees Did not a voice call to the great white road In peril  Woman No Man It was your voice I heard Woman Seeing the opportunity for a double rhythm  Mine was a voice in silence crying Stay Capulchard To her That misses character Man The lifted voice  Of all down trodden pleads What right hath love Save us And therefore I adventure forth With deep reluctance We must part bravely  Woman To him directly  Part that you may seek quest where search is vain  Beyond the decoration Alan Your glory foredoomed ever to suborn Woman Think not of that yield if I tempt thee Capulchard Misinterpreting Good Alan False to ourselves Woman The gods will welcome it  That gives their picture zest Capulchard With a look at the Audience They blaspheme you Woman Our honor nay our love they have made sport To thrill them I am set to tempt that they   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  May see you false if yet our baffled love Again reincarnated plead unslain There is no duty greater than our love Yield let them relish it  Man They ll hear us  Woman Ay And let them Cruel they are powerless Except to gaze You love me let them gaze Why heed their laughter or their froth of tears  Man Indicating Capulchard But he Woman Their priest He too seeks but design Man Cynically with elaborate care for the design  I strive my strife is futile and I yield  He reclines beside her  You were alone Woman I needed you so much After a pause  We must have strength Capulchard To the Audience Enjoy what reck their  words So the design lead whither it was planned A little and they forth shall fly in space After the manner of created things To plead you mercy I will see to that  Man What does he mean Woman Knowing well It is some threat perhaps Capulchard If we could draw remorse Going quickly to the right edge of the decoration   Grotesques  The Girl motive Woman My lover Man We have found our buried life  Fear not they only see what matter Capulchard Designing Voices Voices Without Come we call Man No No Woman Muttering to him as he glances at the Audi  ence Beyond is naught Except the gods Man To her terrified Do you not feel their eyes  Eyes that stare waiting We were happy Voices Without Come Capulchard To the Audience  They hear the voice but only in your minds That was a symbol merely this is fact  He has lifted the Girl right She stands for an instant then with conventionalized movement turns towards the Man  Girl As always controlled  Alas not lost nor slain Even that were best Rather than find you false to the gods will They tell you to go forth It might be you Could save all decoration  Woman Save Thereby Girl Staccato  His going would depict altruism   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Man To the Woman  She does not know Nor we surely  Looking towards the Girl almost in the manner of the early Grotesques Beyond The decoration there is naught that s real Except the gods   Capulchard Not without disappointment  The good will conquer  Woman In passionate defiance Us Our love our life for the pleasure of strengthless gods If there be  She stops The Man with a conventionalized movement is approaching the Girl With a sharp cry  No it is revolt concealed Man Those ancient staring eyes that will outlive  The moon and stars compel us to submit Capulchard The puffed up bubbles burst Woman Looking toiuard Capulchard Whatever we  do  Ends as he planned Man Apart Once more unhappiness Woman To herself Now we may conquer hope and  end all fear  To the Man  Unhappiness I ask no less from them  Man After a moment  What would you have me do I have betrayed You even her our love This penance   Grotesques  Turning front I Am a Grotesque we will no longer bow The prey of gods  He destroys the altar A pause  They have no answer ha Nor power They can only stare Hear O ye gods who brought us into life W e fling defiance give us freedom  Girl Horror struck Oh   Capulchard They shall have freedom even as they wish Freedom beyond their wish freedom complete And even the gods shall hesitate to laugh We ll pause merely to mend the broken rhythm  Alan W e must stand firm I cannot save you Woman No Capulchard brings the Sprite from the right edge of the  decoration At Capulchard s direction the Sprite bends towards the Girl Girl As the Sprite seizes her  Ah catch me not so Sprite I have you for myself Capulchard With a glance at the Man  Thus far forever if there come no help  A silence that brings the design to complete stagnation A pause The lights of the auditorium are very slightly illuminated A pause The lights diminish and go out  Man Mercy not mercy from them hate   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Capulchard Himself awed in a whisper  At last the gods  Capulchard looks at the Grotesques He smiles  What matter Let the end be dexterous Then to new canvas and a different theme Backgrounds are many as the stars themselves And these Grotesques would seek a wider range A third dimension something infinite  Girl Pray to the gods Woman Gently Yes offer them a prayer Capulchard Now like a daemon of dread power vast  To their small eyes but small to me myself Lo I take down the moon erase the stars  He does so There is no less light Man It is the end I love you Woman We have loved Capulchard Caught in the void we ll sweep the can  vas clear New decoration say by Alastair For naught is permanent excepting change  He tears away the background and goes out leaving the stage a void filled by a strange diminishing light which penetrates beyond into the surrounding nowhere an emptiness in which the Grotesques including the Crone whom he flings forward with the others move vaguely A pause  Girl Have mercy upon us  A long silence Curtain Cloyd Head  NOTE ON GROTESQUES  Mr Cloyd Head s brief tragedy which we have the honor of presenting this month to our readers was first produced on the evening of Tuesday November sixteenth 1915 at the Chicago Little Theatre the director Mr Maurice Browne enacting Capulchard Our illustrations are from photographs of this production and they are published through the courtesy of the Chicago Little Theatre  The play ran three weeks the initial cast being as follows Capulchard Mr Maurice Browne The Woman motive Miss Gwendolen Foulke The Man motive Mr Knowles Entrekin The Girl motive Miss Miriam Kiper The Sprite motive Mr Edward Balzerit The Crone motive Miss Winifred Cutting In printing the play the word motive has been omitted to avoid the monotony of repetition As POETRY said editorially last January One could hardly say too much for the beauty of the presentation But that was to be expected for Mr Browne poet and dramatic artist that he is is perhaps the only manager who could work out with complete delicacy the pictorial and theatrical subtleties of the theme Already those of us who love the poetic drama are deeply in his debt  An enthusiastic word should be added for the beauty of Mr Raymond Johnson s part of the production Scenically this play was a new and difficult problem whose fit solution required a man of daring vision and delicate instinct for line and balance in decorative design In many earlier Little   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Theatre productions Mr Johnson had shown rare ability and originality as a scenic designer as well as extraordinary taste and ingenuity in producing new and strange effects with fixed or changing lights Grotesques might have been ruined by a scenic artist less sensitive to conventionalized rhythms in background costumes and the posing of figures  The author the director the assistant director Mrs Maurice Browne and the scenic designer all artists of creative and adventurous imagination had the joy of working in perfect harmony the vision of each inspired and fulfilled by the others And the actors thus led and inspired worked in perfect harmony with these four emphasizing by every pose and intonation the delicate conventionalized rhythms of action and dialogue  The result was a memorable performance If some of the spectators were disconcerted by the strangeness of it unable to dissociate their minds from ordinary theatrical experiences so far as to enter into the poet s mood others found in it that rarest and most poignant of all delights an experience of complete poetic beauty one never to be forgotten so long as life endures or so long perhaps as art preserves her annals H M  The author adds the following word I wish to say two things with regard to this play first to add ray own high appreciation of the artistry and insight which the Chicago Little Theatre brought to the making of the production and second to ask the indulgence of the reader for certain obscurities inevitable to a play designed wholly for the theatre The episodes are conceived as pantomime the words being often a rhythm superimposed upon that pantomime C H  EDITORIAL COMMENT  THE FUTURE OF THE MAGAZINE  FOUR years ago this month POETRY began At  that time the magazine was an experiment  a lone adventurer into a new field A great  art was neglected even ridiculed was in need  of not only a defender but an aggressive  spokesman an organ Whether POETRY has fulfilled this function we will leave to its friends or even to its enemies The most casual observer cannot fail to admit the extent of the change during these four years both in the spirit of the art and in its position before the critics and the public And no informed person can fail to admit that the new movement the new vitality has been stimulated chiefly by this magazine and the currents of influence which have issued from it  It is therefore a question of immediate importance whether the magazine is to continue after its initial period is over The financial arrangement which made the experiment possible was a five year guarantee fund of a little over five thousand dollars a year donated to the cause by more than an hundred lovers of the art This fund which still amounts to more than one half of our annual income has enabled us to pay our contributors and to keep abreast of office expenses the rising cost of printing and paper an ever increasing correspondence and all the incredibly numerous details of publication   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  As a business enterprise however POETRY is as yet far from independent Its annual reports to the guarantors have shown steady and sure progress but progress too slow to put the enterprise on its feet by October 1917 Indeed the present editor thinks that financial independence should not be expected poetry like the other arts deserves and requires not one but many endowments and this particular endowment far from diminishing should grow in order that the work so enthusiastically begun may be still more effectively carried on  Many of our guarantors under the generous impulse of this feeling have already expressed a desire to continue their contributions for a few more years Others however feel rightly enough that they have done their share or in some cases even more than they could reasonably afford We therefore appeal more generally to all lovers of the art all who wish to encourage its production and promote its public

in the effort to extend its life and increase its power H M  THE CHINESE CHANTING OF THE CLASSICS  In one of Mr Yeats books Thoughts on Good and Evil I think it is he gives an account of the method of chanting poetry in use by the early Irish bards These bards he says deliberately pitched the speaking not the singing voice in definite if irregular intervals He illustrates it with a magical setting in this style of a short poem of his own from  Countess Kathleen  It is interesting to compare this method of Irish bards with the system of chanting the classics in China a system which was doubtless in use before the days of St Patrick and which flourishes among scholars today   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To be able to be or chant from memory a large part of the Book of Odes is an essential to a classical education in China and every scholar of the old school falls automatically into the chant when asked to recite them  Unlike the Irish bards the Chinese use the full singing voice in their chanting and the tunes they use have a much more definite melody than that recorded by Mr Yeats Yet it is in its essence much the same thing a loose flowing chant which varies from individual to individual and from moment to moment as the exigencies of the poem and the emotions of the singer dictate  The rhythm of the chant is very definite though more complex than the usual song rhythm with us This follows the rhythms of their verse forms which unlike the Japanese have a system of scansion much like our own a system in which the quantitative element in English poetry is replaced by the accentual element inherent in the vocal tones which distinguish the Chinese language The usual stanza in Chinese is four or eight lines in length each line having five or seven syllables the whole being as definitely set as to rhyme and rhythm scheme as a villanelle with us  With the help of Miss Elizabeth Hammond the violin cellist I am able to set down here the tunes used by two scholars in reciting a famous four line poem Spring Evening by Su Shih 1036 1101  The literal translation which seems to me to give the taste of Chinese thinking better than any formalized version is this   The Chinese Chanting of the Classics  Spring evening one moment price thousand gold  Flowers have fresh odor moon has shadow  Singing piping comes from the balcony floor fine fine  Children are Swinging in the garden evening drips drips  The words in parenthesis are understood The last three words mean that the water in the water glass which is recording the evening drips and drips  The poem is a tsüeh beginning in the Ping tone and the metrical skeleton is as follows The Ping is the low even tone and the Tseh includes the other three tones of the Chinese language which are all higher and sharper than Ping Tseh is therefore higher and louder than Ping but there is no difference in length The first second and fourth lines rhyme  Ping ping tseh tseh tseh ping ping Ping tseh ping ping tseh tseh ping Ping tseh ping ping ping tseh tseh Ping ping tseh tseh tseh ping ping  In setting down the chants which follow we have perhaps put them slightly out of joint as the intervals of the Chinese scale do not correspond exactly with the arbitrary intervals of our well tuned clavichord But we have tried to remedy this by placing an L for lower and an H for higher over certain notes to indicate that they are between the note written and the half tone next above or below There are also numerous slurs quavers and grace notes which we have not been able to render exactly but some effect of the whole may be gained from these transcriptions particularly if given glissando by the voice or a stringed instrument   It will be seen that the rather complex rhythm scheme is identical in the two chants and that they bear some general   The Chinese Chanting of the Classics  thematic resemblance one to the other although the details may vary infinitely the same man singing the same poem differently at different times The general effect of the monosyllables each one of which is a word is clear and nasal in quality with the soft yet nasal ng sound of the French language much in evidence  It is interesting to think of the probable effect on an Anglo Saxon audience of reciting one of our own classical lyrics say Herrick s To Daisies not to shut so soon in this oriental fashion The closeness of the Chinese soul of which Carl Sandburg writes so assuredly has decidedly its limitations  Eunice Tietjens  A JITNEY BUS AMONG MASTERPIECES  A type of criticism coming into vogue lately is of the subjective or pseudo impressionist variety imitative of the leisurely mode of the mature minds of certain distinguished French critics But the minds of those in this country who affect the method are anything but mature in years or in experience Having accepted as their motto Anatole France s remark that criticism is a soul s adventures among masterpieces it does not occur to them that it may make some difference whether the soul is or is not well qualified for the adventure I often feel when reading such criticism as if I had been asked to take a jitney bus sight seeing tour through a metropolis of masterpieces or near masterpieces as it may happen With these the guide is indifferently familiar but familiar at any cost and their raison d être as   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  explained by him is somewhat vague On the right ladies and gentlemen this is in a style I do not care for On the other hand this on the left means much to us This I like This although very beautiful in its time is impossible today Why But of course you know  For criticism of this type is no more exact than that It does not come to grips with anything I have been waiting a long time to use that phrase I have seen it in almost every article I have read for the last month In fact nothing is easier than this sort of criticism when there is no real thought back of it It is often only too obviously the product of a lazy mind a lazy mind that tries to protect itself by affecting a knowingness that covers ignorance and inertia For it is not necessary in this type of criticism to have any background whatever  All criticism is of course subjective and personal But it only becomes of value through the critic s attempt to relate his subjective and personal feelings to the objective qualities of the work criticised If he does not so relate it his personal reaction is of no value whatever  In this country we have a dire need of constructive or synthetic criticism I do not like the term creative criticism as I think it is itself partially responsible for much of the delusion concerning the value of irrelevant and unspecific criticism noted above Criticism may not be as parasitic as the mistletoe but it adheres to the thing criticised as tenaciously as the bud to the tree Otherwise it is not criticism   A Jitney bus among Masterpieces  not even creative criticism it is something else Pater s eulogy for instance of Leonardo s Mona Lisa is not criticism it is an entirely separate literary performance taking Mona Lisa s smile as a starting point It is no more criticism than Keats Ode on a Grecian Urn The urn was a perfected work of art and propagated another work of art as art forms are capable of doing but no one would claim that Keats was indulging in creative criticism  However I have no desire to indulge in an argument over this term an argument capable of being prolonged indefinitely and never settled like that other equally futile argument over the dividing line between prose and poetry I merely wish to indicate that when a definite work is under consideration as for instance in a review constructive or synthetic criticism may not be arrived at through a shunting of the critic s responsibility for exact thought and exact expression in relation to the thing criticised It is rather the direct result of these A C H  ARMENIAN POETRY  The Armenian poems which follow appear in English for the first time They are the lamentations of a race that in spite of five centuries of subjection remains one of the naturally poetic peoples of the world These poems were not written by intellectuals but by untrained men and women whose inheritance for more than two thousand years has been poetic During the turbulent and arid periods in Armenian history when massacres and deportation brought   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  political anemia the poets have endured have been the historians of their race The first poem by a woman to her deported husband is probably from the early eighteenth century  Oh my beloved it is a dozen years since thou art gone I commence to lose the features of thy face I long to see thee again with mine own eyes But during all the twelve months of the year Thou stayest yonder on the other side of the sea I stretch out mine arms like a bridge On which thou may st cross the ocean and return to me  There have been women poets in Armenia but their  songs during the last five hundred years have been full of despair An Armenian mother of the seventeenth century in the following lullaby to her child voices her own tragedy of subjection  I sing a lullaby that in listening to Thou shalt lie down and sleep sweetly Sleep my child and grow Grow and become a great man Where there is no ruler Be the ruler of thyself Enlarge thyself and become a village Become a dense forest  Forcing thy roots to the foundations of the earth Force thy roots into the foundations of the earth And let thy trees cast all about thee The shadow of their branches  Another poem a quatrain in its original form is of un  known date During the seventeenth century a group of  women living in Eghine in Turkish Armenia became cele  brated for the gentle lyric melancholy of their verse and this  poem is attributed to that period  He is not dead thy son he is not dead He has gone away into the garden   Armenian Poetry  He has gathered roses and in pressing them against his face Has been lulled into sleep by their soft perfume  In Armenia the trouvère still fills the office of publisher to many poets and by his singing in the streets of the villages and towns gives to the people the poetry of the nation Djivani who died only a few years ago sang of his wandering brotherhood  The trouvère is a bird without wings Today here tomorrow there Sometimes devoured by hunger and by thirst Again the favorite of fortune He goes he comes never ceasing to roam Today here tomorrow there He is in the shadow a shining wing A cloud propelled by the wind In quest of vain hopes Djivani stops nowhere In cities or villages Today here tomorrow there Until his death he will live thus Fluttering about as a bee Today here tomorrow there  Kate Buss  REVIEWS  POET AND THEORIST  Goblins and Pagodas by John Gould Fletcher Houghton Mifflin Co Of the first poem of this volume The Ghosts of an Old  House Mr Fletcher says in his preface I have tried to evoke out of the furniture and surroundings of a certain old house definite emotions which I have had concerning them I have tried to relate my childish terror concerning this house to the aspects that called it forth   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This he has done skilfully Now and then possibly out of too literal an adherence to the image possibly from mere paucity of image the effect is scanty and incomplete And infrequently the spell is marked by a certain lack of taste a clumsiness in the manner of the gossip who tells too much or tells it with two great relish Despite these flaws out of the weave ghosts do take shape and live ghosts both ordinary and strange whimsical and fearful of that indeterminate life existing between men and the objects about them This house with its six white columns and the nine great windows of its face stared into by uncivil ancient trees does exist perhaps not as inevitably as the house of Usher or the castle of Golaud yet by some kindred magic Its story in the best of the poems proceeds out of an economy of language a delicate adjustment of word to word of verse to verse that maintains the line of rhythm and makes of the poem a shapely thing like a vase from which flowers rise beautifully  The second section of the book Symphonies seems a less simple matter To refer again to the preface these poems aim to narrate certain important phases of the life of an artist each phase in the terms of a certain color or combination of colors The first of these Blue Symphony spreads life before one in a rare pattern of words certainly marked by new genius Day and night gardens and waters the palace and the temple foot passengers in scarlet pilgrims of autumn treasure lying in the marsh grasses and the distant blue mountains of death these symbols ar   Poet and Theorist  range themselves with clarity and measure and flow together as if some great Japanese had used them in a landscape Readers of POETRY will remember the cadence  The darkness rolls upward  The thick darkness carries with it  Rain and a ravel of cloud The sun comes forth upon earth  Palely the dawn Leaves me facing timidly  Old gardens sunken And in the gardens is water  Sombre wreck autumnal leaves Shadowy roofs In the blue mist And a willow branch that is broken  Oh old pagodas of my soul how you glittered across green trees  Blue and cool Blue tremulously Blow faint puffs of smoke Across sombre pools The damp green smell of rotted wood And a heron that cries from out the water  The Green Symphony likewise though tonally not so perfect paints with fine motion and freshness the intoxication of flowers clouds winds lakes pine forests light and air Black and Gold contains two or three swift notes of the city at night And always one finds from time to time in White Symphony and Blue and White especially beautiful moments poignant notes of color and sound and now and then a lyric with the value of this one  Autumn Golden fountains And the winds neighing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Amid the monotonous hills Desolation of the old gods Rain that lifts and rain that moves away In the green black torrent Scarlet leaves  But except always for the first and third symphonies Mr Fletcher goes in these poems where I for one find it irksome to follow It is not that he loses the gist in the image as some wag has said these imagists do but in a wild concatenation of images in which adjectives play too insistent and meticulous a part especially those denoting color Sometimes for pages it seems he allows no noun to appear without its blue white gray green strong red T o me even after a repeated use of the guide in the preface these dramas of the soul in terms of color lack life and motion become turgid and dry almost to choking The artist runs out like the wind no one can hold him races between the gray guns birds fan him with hot winds rugged waves of blue black water lash him lap him dash him do not let him rest a minute a howling sunset a shrieking storm assail him fierce whirling swords spit and stab his lungs and heart fight for air appalling scarlet sears his eyes And yet with all this one only gets the sensation that dreams give of violent effort and no progress To borrow from Frank Tinney Mr Fletcher put it over and it lay there  I wonder if this failure is not due to a courting of the impossible if he has not sought to build a system out of too elusive intuitions and so has foundered in abstractions The same tendency to depart from the concrete is apparent in his prefacing discussion of poetry a tendency to generalize   Poet and Theorist  which Blake bluntly says is to be an idiot He tells us for example with an eye always to modernity that no sincere artist cares to handle subject matter already handled and exhausted forgetting that Aeschylus Euripides and Sophocles made use of the same ancient stories and that anyway manner and matter being inseparable talk of subject matter is not pertinent  Wouldn t it be well for the poet to leave to the litterateur all this solemn elation over the new art the new poetry the new technique Why worry about it The great artist inevitably is neither conventional nor hackneyed lesser men are certain to echo him and then follow the echoes of the echo and so on to emptiness Why clamor and admonish The story will remain the same great art always un solvably old and new as established as mathematics as surprising as the spring Possibly some one of the new school is already echoing Mr Fletcher and some of his verses distinctly owe their piquancy to the old device of rhyme  Owls flap in this ancient barn With rotted doors  Rats squeak in this ancient barn Over the floors  Owls flap in this ancient barn Rats eyes gleam in the cold moonlight  There is something hidden in this barn With barred doors  Something the owls have torn And the rats scurry with over the floors  Dorothy Dudley   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A SOLDIER POET  Le Prisonnier des Mondes par Jean Le Roy Société  d Éditions Mansi et Cie Paris  Amid the masses of to day s poetry of detail heaped high on every editorial desk from an ode to an egg shell found in an alley to reflections upon suspenders hanging in a shop window it is at least a change to come upon Le Prisonnier des Mondes by Jean Le Roy one of the younger French poets and a soldier who took part in the great offensive in Champagne This poet signals to us from high places His themes are the elements which possess him whirl him about till he is occasionally in danger of losing his balance True he may write about a tramway but he is less concerned with the tramway than with what he sees from it fleeting houses landscapes He likes to write of the open with its sounds and sights and does not tire of looking at life which builds of cells wonderful animate structures He handles cosmic laws vastly and impersonally Must these great facts be always related to the human the personal in poetry I think not Poems of nature when they are warmed by the human appeal are perhaps those most lingered over yet it is good to feel the wide coldness of the elemental forces Not that Le Roy s work is heedless of the human pulse but he sees in the heart of a man the heart of all creation  Instant de Clarté the opening poem in the little paperbound book whose titles all told number only eight is interesting from a wide point of view   A Soldier Poet  Je sens comme un fantôme Derrière moi Un homme Plus grand que moi Et qui pèse sur mes épaules Et puis derrière un autre Et puis derrière celui là D autres hommes échelonnés  Et puis toujours plus grands des géants en sommeil Qui de moins en moins éclairés Par le soleil Se reculent dans l ombre Mes ancêtres depuis les premiers temps du monde  This will make you want to go on The poet sees now before him others small at first then smaller dwindling to smaller still and others ever others who are his son and his son s sons They fall asleep in the past or plunge into the future till at last there is but one existing conscious being himself As in the foregoing quotation throughout his poems Le Roy uses rhyme  Danse des Globes is beautiful with sounding language though it may contain a few misapplied pictures W e like to accept this invitation at the outset Let us ascend into the oak trees the oak trees balmy as houses by the twisted stairway of branches let us ascend in the whiteness of evening let us gather on the flat roofs of evening as gathered the herds of Chaldea And behold we find ourselves amid the rolling and crackling of worlds  Et nous ainsi que des pâtres de la Chaldée Nous regardons danser nous écoutons la danse Des globes La pluie des globes autour de la terre Fille endormie qui rêve parmi l azur En tremblant d une folle chute   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Le Roy has written poems not contained in this volume I have seen some of his trench poems and they all reflect the strength and sincerity of one who really knows In La Chair et l Acier which was printed in the New Republic for June 10 1916 the poet draws a striking contrast He describes the days when a young man felt pleasure and pride in his muscles as he trod the smooth pavements of Paris or swam in pleasant waters not yet conscious of the frailty of his own body and then he pictures the days of a bombardment Now at last he apprehends flesh flesh that could once shiver luxuriously at a beautiful strain of music or thrill with delight at some dear memory He describes with the bold truth of an artist in words the pitiless steel as it cuts with monstrous ease into lithe white adolescent flesh  Jeunes corps confiants jadis Sur le bitume de Paris But even lovelier is this poem which we quote entire as it will be new to our readers having been printed only in an extremely limited edition of a rough little trench paper  PRINTEMPS  Des pétales jeunes frêles lisses Pleuvent sur un coin d ombre du tennis Dans une allée les jeunes filles ont oublié Leurs chapeaux de jardin  Vous nous gênez les fusains Nous qui jouons au croquet Vêtus de bleu soldats français  Dans ce printemps très clair où le canon s entend Nous sommes là dans ce printemps   A Soldier Poet  Jouant ensemble Et l azur tremble  Nous sommes là jouant ensemble  L employé du Crédit Lyonnais  Le tourneur et le professeur  Le carreleur  Le mécano et le typo  Les deux petits merlans  Et moi aussi dans ce printemps  Les minutes pleuvent lentement Comme les jeunes pétales blancs Comme les bombes à l horizon  Et c est ainsi que va le temps Plus précieux que les autres temps Celui qu il faudrait arrêter Pour l écouter et pour le voir passer de près Non parce qu un coeur à jamais Pleurera sa fuite  Comme en son vieux parc Olympio  Ou Lamartine au bord de l eau  Mais parce qu au bruit lointain des obus qui se cassent  Ardente étonnante rapide  L histoire du monde se passe Jean Le Roy s work shows us what fine flowers are lifting  their loveliness to the scythe of war A F  A STACCATO POET  Mushrooms a Book of Free Forms by Alfred Kreymborg John Marshall Co Ltd New York An insinuating meddlesome quizzical inquiring spirit  sometimes a clown oftener a wit now and then a lyric poet  such is the author of this book He trips about cheerfully  among life s little incongruities laughs at you and me and  progress and prejudice and dreams says I told you so  with an air as if after a double somersault in the circus ring   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  grows wistful even tender with emotions always genuine even though not too deep for momentary tears And always whatever his mood whatever his subject or purpose he is as becomes the harlequin philosopher entertaining  Mr Kreymborg s free forms suit his temperament and they accompany his thought fitly with the delicate aplomb of a ukulele As a rule they are extremely staccato a movement that tires if one reads too many though usually any incipient yawn turns into a smile Who could resist the deftness of this bit of consummate wit an epigram called  Life  I met four guinea hens today Creaking like pulleys  A crrk said one A crrk said two A crrk said three A crrk said four  I agree with you cheerfully ladies  And here is another from the same laughing philosopher  Tiny boy staring at me with eyes like toy balloons That broom is much bigger than you put it down You won t Then don t put it down  And I should like to quote also the divertingly true I am four monkeys but that is already almost famous Are these poetry Why not Did not Horace write  satires long ago and successfully put them over with the  Romans yes and with sober minded professors of Latin   A Staccato Poet  even to our own day Are these not as much poetry as Pope s diffuse and ingeniously rhymed satirical skits which were gulped down though with wry faces by the wits and beaux of that Augustan age Is there no room for satire in modern poetic art Because thou art virtuous shall there be no more cakes and ale  I own it doth amaze me to hear some critics solemnly reading the law against Messrs Kreymborg Eliot Pound and others whenever they indulge in contemporary satire As if the muse must always march grandly to heroic tunes or dance to approved classic measures and never while away a more intimate hour to steps of her own devising among our own hidden and cherished frailties These poets are witty in a modern fashion They give us satirical verse of a kind more fit for our telegraphic age than Horace s sententious periods or Pope s ingenious couplets but verse as well entitled to be called poetry as theirs in this kind  I do not mean that Mr Kreymborg is always a satirist Even in his most serious moods however he keeps his light touch and go manner and his telegraphic almost telescopic style His free forms are not always so good a fit for the serious as for the whimsical mood their rhythms become as obvious in their way as certain familiar hymns are in theirs But sometimes he does a thing worthy of that overused adjective exquisite like this wistful Dance  Moon dance You were not to blame Nor you lovely white moth But I saw you together   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Again as in one or two of the group To My Mother a  feeling delicately tender is set to soft music Entity perhaps  came by wireless yet I find it not quite unworthy of the  muse I am And you And atoms Censure Forgiveness Why  I should like to quote America which rather bravely suggests the big swinging march of a young nation but I must stop with one more and that one a portrait Cézanne  Our door was shut to the noon day heat We could not see him We might not have heard him either resting dozing dreaming pleasantly But his step was tremendous are mountains on the march  He was no man who passed but a great faithful horse dragging a load up the hill  H M  SOUTHERN SONGS  Plantation Songs and Other Verse by Ruth McEnery Stuart D Appleton amp Co  These are negro dialect songs of the best type gay humorous rollicking and tender full of sympathy and rioting with color It is safe to predict that some of these for their human qualities of mirth and patience will be chanted and   Southern Songs  loved in nooks and corners of the earth for many a long year If Mrs Stuart s place were not already secure this book alone would endear her to the hearts of the people  Her serious poems for the most part
