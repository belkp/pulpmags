Tool Maker Stacker of Wheat Player with Railroads and the Nation s  Freight Handler Stormy husky brawling City of the Big Shoulders  They tell me you are wicked and I believe them for I have seen your painted women under the gas lamps luring the farm boys  And they tell me you are crooked and I answer Yes it is true I have seen the gunman kill and go free to kill again  And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is On the faces of women and children I have seen the marks of wanton hunger   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And having answered so I turn once more to those who sneer at this my city and I give them back the sneer and say to them  Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning  Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on job here is a tall bold slugger set vivid against the little soft cities  Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action cunning as a savage pitted against the wilderness Bareheaded Shoveling Wrecking Planning Building breaking rebuilding  Under the smoke dust all over his mouth laughing with white teeth Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young man laughs Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has never lost a battle Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse and under his ribs the heart of the people Laughing  Laughing the stormy husky brawling laughter of Youth half naked sweating proud to be Hog Butcher Tool Maker Stacker of Wheat Player with Railroads and Freight Handler to the Nation   Chicago Poems  JAN KUBELIK  Your bow swept over a string and a long low note quivered to the air A mother of Bohemia sobs over a new child perfect learning to suck milk  Your bow ran fast over all the high strings fluttering and wild All the girls in Bohemia are laughing on a Sunday afternoon in the hills with their lovers  THE HARBOR  Passing through huddled and ugly walls By doorways where women haggard Looked from their hunger deep eyes Haunted with shadows of hunger hands Out from the huddled and ugly walls I came sudden at the city s edge On a blue burst of lake Long lake waves breaking under the sun On a spray flung curve of shore And a fluttering storm of gulls Masses of great gray wings And flying white bellies Veering and wheeling free in the open   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE HAMMER  I have seen The old gods go And the new gods come  Day by day And year by year The idols fall And the idols rise  Today I worship the hammer  AT A WINDOW  Give me hunger O you gods that sit and give The world its orders Give me hunger pain and want Shut me out with shame and failure From your doors of gold and fame Give me your shabbiest weariest hunger  But leave me a little love  A voice to speak to me in the day end  A hand to touch me in the dark room  Breaking the long loneliness   Chicago Poems  In the dusk of day shapes Blurring the sunset One little wandering western star Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow Let me go to the window Watch there the day shapes of dusk And wait and know the coming Of a little love  LOST  Desolate and lone All night long on the lake Where fog trails and mist creeps The whistle of a boat Calls and cries unendingly Like some lost child In tears and trouble Hunting the harbor s breast And the harbor s eyes  WHO AM I  My head knocks against the stars My feet are on the hilltops My finger tips are in the valleys and shores of universal  life Down in the sounding foam of primal things I reach my hands and play with pebbles of destiny   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I have been to hell and back many times I know all about heaven for I have talked with God I dabble in the blood and guts of the terrible I know the passionate seizure of beauty And the marvelous rebellion of man at all signs reading  Keep Off  My name is Truth and I am the most elusive captive in the universe  MOMUS  Momus is the name men give your face The brag of its tone like a long low steamboat whistle Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray  Against horizons purple silent  Yes Momus Men have flung your face in bronze To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street whirl of folk They were artists did this shaped your sad mouth Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm broad wis  dom All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones   Chicago Poems  Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes purple silent fled from all the iron things of life evaded like a sought bandit gone into dreams by God  I wonder Momus Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter On men who play in terrible earnest the old known solemn repetitions of history A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze You give me the human ease of a mountain peak purple  silent Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves Careless eye witness of the spawning tides of men and  women Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil the salt of tears And blood drops of undiminishing war  THE ROAD AND THE END  I shall foot it Down the roadway in the dusk Where shapes of hunger wander And the fugitives of pain go by   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I shall foot it In the silence of the morning See the night slur into dawn Hear the slow great winds arise Where tall trees flank the way And shoulder toward the sky  The broken boulders by the road Shall not commemorate my ruin Regret shall be the gravel under foot I shall watch for Slim birds swift of wing That go where wind and ranks of thunder Drive the wild processionals of rain  The dust of the travelled road Shall touch my hands and face  Carl Sandburg   LOVE SONGS  OLD LOVE AND NEW  In my heart the old love Struggled with the new It was ghostly waking All night through  Dear things kind things That my old love said Ranged themselves reproachfully Round my bed  But I could not heed them For I seemed to see Dark eyes of my new love Fixed on me  Old love old love How can I be true Shall I be faithless to myself Or to you   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  OVER THE ROOFS  I said I have shut my heart As one shuts an open door That Love may starve therein And trouble me no more  But over the roofs there came The wet new wind of May And a tune blew up from the curb Where the street pianos play  My room was white with the sun And Love cried out in me I am strong I will break your heart Unless you set me free  DEBT  What do I owe to you Who loved me deep and long You never gave my spirit wings Nor gave my heart a song  But oh to him I loved Who loved me not at all I owe the little open gate That led through heaven s wall   Love Songs  SEPTEMBER MIDNIGHT  Lyric night of the lingering Indian Summer Shadowy fields that are scentless but full of singing Never a bird but the passionless chant of insects  Ceaseless insistent  The grasshopper s horn and far off high in the maples The wheel of a locust leisurely grinding the silence Under a moon waning and worn broken  Tired with summer  Let me remember you voices of little insects Weeds in the moonlight fields that are tangled with asters Let me remember soon will the winter be on us Snow hushed and heavy  Over my soul murmur your mute benediction While I gaze O fields that rest after harvest As those who part look long in the eyes they lean to  Lest they forget them  Sara Teasdale   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SONGS  WHO LOVES THE RAIN  Who loves the rain And loves his home  And looks on life with quiet eyes Him will I follow through the storm And at his hearth fire keep me warm  Nor hell nor heaven shall that soul surprise Who loves the rain And loves his home  And looks on life with quiet eyes  THE CHILD S QUEST  My mother twines me roses wet with dew Oft have I sought the garden through and through I cannot find the tree whereon My mother s roses grew  Seek not O child the tree Whereon thy mother s roses grew  My mother tells me tales of noble deeds Oft have I sought her book when no one heeds I cannot find the page alas From which my mother reads  Seek not O child the page From which thy mother reads   Songs  My mother croons me songs all soft and low Through the white night where little breezes blow Yet never when the morning dawns My mother s songs I know  Seek not O child at dawn of day Thy mother s songs to know  COLOGNE CATHEDRAL  The little white prayers Of Elspeth Fry Float up the arches Into the sky  A little black bird On the belfry high Pecks at them As they go by  SKELETONS  Gird thy warrior s armor on And fare thou forth thyself alone  Empty frame upon the wall Secret presence in the hall In the closets we abide Of the whole green country side   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Savage chief who sold his wife Priest who took a martyr s life  Madman raving of his gain Cruel pirate of the main  Drunkard fallen in her track Soldier wounded in the back  Scarlet letter branded deep Just the tendency to sleep  Empty frame upon the wall Secret presence in the hall In the closets we abide Of the whole green country side  STAR THOUGHT  I shall see a star tonight From a distant mountain height From a city you will see The same star that shines on me  Tis not of the firmament On a solar journey bent Fixed it is through time and weather Tis a thought we hold together   Songs  LITTLE PAGAN RAIN SONG  In the dark and peace of my final bed The wet grass waving above my head At rest from love at rest from pain I lie and listen to the rain  Falling softly falling Song of my soul that is free Song of my soul that has not forgot The sleeping body of me  When quiet and calm and straight I lie High in the air my soul rides by Shall I await thee soul in vain Hark to the answer in the rain  Falling softly falling Song of my soul that is free Song of my soul that will not forget The sleeping body of me  Frances Shaw   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EROS TURANNOS  She fears him and will always ask What fated her to choose him She meets in his engaging mask  All reasons to refuse him But what she meets and what she fears Are less than are the downward years Drawn slowly to the foamless weirs  Of age were she to lose him  Between a blurred sagacity That once had power to sound him And Love that will not let him be  The seeker that she found him Her pride assuages her almost As if it were alone the cost He sees that he will not be lost  And waits and looks around him  A sense of ocean and old trees Envelops and allures him Tradition touching all he sees  Beguiles and reassures him And all her doubts of what he says Are dimmed with what she knows of days Till even prejudice delays  And fades and she secures him   Eros Turannos  The falling leaf inaugurates The reign of her confusion The pounding wave reverberates  The crash of her illusion And home where passion lived and died Becomes a place where she can hide While all the town and harbor side  Vibrate with her seclusion  We tell you tapping on our brows The story as it should be As if the story of a house  Were told or ever could be We ll have no kindly veil between Her visions and those we have seen As if we guessed what hers have been  Or what they are or would be  Meanwhile we do no harm for they That with a god have striven Not hearing much of what we say  Take what the god has given Though like waves breaking it may be Or like a changed familiar tree Or like a stairway to the sea  Where down the blind are driven Edwin Arlington Robinson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THREE IRISH SPINNING SONGS  I  A young girl sings  The Lannan Shee Watched the young man Brian Cross over the stile towards his father s door And she said No help For now he ll see His byre his bawn and his threshing floor And oh the swallows Forget all wonders When walls with the nests rise up before  My strand is knit  Out of the dream Of me into The round of his labor he will grow To spread his fields In the winds of Spring And tramp the heavy glebe and sow And cut and clamp And rear the turf Until the season when they mow  My wheel runs smooth  The Lannan Shee is the Faery Mistress of Irish peasant romance   Three Irish Spinning Songs  And while he toils In field and bog He will be anxious in his mind About the thatch Of barn and rick Against the reiving autumn wind And how to make His gap and gate Secure against the thieving kind  My wool is fine  He has gone back And I ll see no more Mine image in his deepening eyes Then I ll lean above The Well of the Bride And with my beauty peace will rise O autumn star In a hidden lake  Fill up my heart and make me wise  My quick brown wheel  The women bring Their pitchers here At the time when the stir of the house is o er They ll see my face In the well water And they ll never lift their vessels more   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  For each will say How beautiful Why should I labor any more Indeed I come Of so fair a race Twere waste to labor any more  My thread is spun  II  An elder girl sings  One came before her and said beseeching I have fortune and I have lands And if you ll share in the goods of my household All my treasure s at your commands  But she said to him The goods you proffer Are far from my mind as the silk of the sea The arms of him my young love round me Is all the treasure that s true for me  Proud you are then proud of your beauty But beauty s a flower will soon decay The fairest flowers they bloom in the Summer They bloom one Summer and they fade away  My heart is sad then for the little flower That must so wither where fair it grew He who has my heart in keeping I would he had my body too   Three Irish Spinning Songs  III  An old woman sings  There was an oul trooper went riding by On the road to Carricknabauna And sorrow is better to sing than cry On the way to Carricknabauna And as the oul trooper went riding on He heard this sung by a crone a crone On the road to Carricknabauna  I d spread my cloak for you young lad Were it only the breadth of a farthen And if your mind was as good as your word In troth it s you I d rather In dread of any jealousy And before we go any farther Carry me up to the top of the hill And show me Carricknabauna  Carricknabauna Carricknabauna Would you show me Carricknabauna I lost a horse at Cruckmoylinn At the Cross of Bunratty I dropped a limb But I left my youth on the crown of the hill Over by Carricknabauna  Girls young girls the rush light is done What will I do when my thread is spun   POETRY A Magazine o Verse  THE SEA BIRD TO THE WAVE  On and on  O white brother  Thunder does not daunt thee  How thou movest  By thine impulse  With no wing  Fairest thing  The wide sea shows me  On and on  O white brother  Art thou gone  Padraic Colum   EDITORIAL COMMENT  VERS LIBRE AND METRICAL PROSE  T IS the fashion today to call everything  which is without metre vers libre Accord  ing to those who most use this term vers  libre fades imperceptibly into prose and  in some cases indeed to the lay mind it actually is prose The object of this article is to establish a division in the spectrum of word values and to show how the extreme of prose at one end changes to the extreme of poetry at the other through the grades of metrical prose and vers libre Unless we adopt Mallarmé s definition that all prose which has style is poetry we must recognize the fact that there are at least two steps between pure prose and pure poetry  The term vers libre originated in France and was adopted to describe the revolt against the cut and dried rules of French versification To a Frenchman of the classic tradition almost all the poetry in the English language would be vers libre In order to make this clear let me state the principal rules of French classic verse French is a language without accent and the French foot is one sound or syllable The classic French metre is the hexameter so called although it consists of twelve feet It has a marked caesura in the middle   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Other metres are used but although they each contain the requisite number of feet as do our English metres the feet can often be discerned only by counting them so little does the stress appear Mute syllables are pronounced before a consonant not before a vowel which again adds a certain stilted and unreal effect It is imperative that the rhymes should alternate masculine and feminine endings feminine endings being those words which finish with a mute syllable It will be seen at a glance how difficult it is to escape monotony with such firm and inelastic rules  The Frenchman therefore would consider all our verse vers libre as it is so much freer and permits of so much more change than his In trying to adopt his term we are led into a difficulty because in endeavoring to be freer than we were we often overstep and land in the division of metrical prose  Metrical prose existed long before the term vers libre came into use But many people consider the two phrases interchangeable the latter being merely more up to date As a matter of fact they are not The French themselves have prose rythmée it was this very prose which Mallarmé referred to when he spoke of prose stylée or styled prose It is in metrical prose that he did much of his work for he caught its true cadence as few writers have done But true to his belief that styled prose is poetry he confined to that his use of free metres and did not employ vers libre practically all of his verse being   Editorial Comment  written in the classic hexameter Take this passage from Frisson d Hiver  Cette pendule de Saxe qui retarde et sonne treize heures parmi ses fleurs et ses dieux à qui a t elle été Pense quelle est venue de Saxe par les longues diligences autrefois  Now as an example of vers libre let us take the following quotation from Fernand Gregh  Mais à mon tour j aurai connu le goût chaud de la vie J aurai miré dans ma prunelle Petite minute éblouie La grande lumière éternelle Mais j aurai bonne joie au grand festin sacré Que voudrais je de plus J aurai vécu Et je mourrai  It is not the presence of rhyme in the one and the absence of it in the other which makes the real difference It is what one of POETRY S contributors has called the divisions of rhythmic wave lengths I prefer to call these wave lengths simply curves And I wish to show that it is the length and sharpness of the curve which makes the difference between vers libre and metrical prose  The rhythm of prose is long and slightly curved the rhythm of verse very much shorter with a tendency to return back upon itself For instance this passage from Julius Caesar  Then none have I offended I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences enforced for which he suffered death   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The line of stress is long and with no distinct harking back On the other hand  Yankee Doodle came to town Riding on a pony Stuck a feather in his hat And called it macaroni  Here the curve is short and choppy and returns on itself by the rhymes The desire to return upon itself is one of the most characteristic traits of verse To that is due the rhyme the refrain so usual in folk poetry and all the meaningless words of repetition like fol deriddle lol and the French dondaine When there is very little metre and no rhyme as in much oriental poetry the return is effected by the repetition of certain words So positive a characteristic of poetry is this in all ages and in all countries that the distinction between poetry and prose would seem to consist more in this quality of return than in the lengths of the curve or wave length Sometimes the return is indicated more in idea than in absolute words but in poetry it is always present in some form to give the balance which produces the effect of music on the ear  Now as prose is a long curve with very little return and poetry is a much shorter curve with a very sharp return so metrical prose may be considered as a slightly more curved line than is usual in prose with a return beginning to be felt and vers libre as curving still more markedly and the return becoming pronounced   Editorial Comment  To cite an example from Walt Whitman  The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh themselves the body of the flock feed the sentinels outside move around ith erect heads watching and are from time to time reliev d by other sentinels and I feeding and taking turns with the rest  This is metrical prose The curve is very long but the return is quite evident On the other hand Edward Carpenter in Towards Democracy has I look upon my life as from afar I hear its murmur mark its changeful sheen As one who from a high cliff marks the waves He just now rode on Beautiful gleaming shot with hues from heaven With strange pale lustre beautiful indeed  O God from this great eminence of Death which is distinctly vers libre The curve is much shorter and the return excessively marked  French and English are interestingly differentiated in the fact that it is easier to find examples of vers libre in French and of metrical prose in English The unaccented French language instantly becomes vers libre when it departs from the props and stays of classic tradition while in English the distinction between free verse and metrical prose is so slight that it requires a very delicate ear to detect the difference The great poets of the nineteenth and preceding centuries contain no example so far as I know It is a modern metre and must be sought among the moderns  Henri de Régnier is one of the greatest writers of vers libre His Le Vase is a perfect example of the metre   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To quote a stanza in the middle of the poem  Le vase naissait dans la pierre façonnée Svelte et pur il avait grandi Informe encore en sa sveltesse Et j attendis Les mains oisives et inquiètes Pendant des jours tournant la tele A gauche à droit au moindre bruit Sans plus polir la panse ou lever le marteau L eau Coulait de la fontaine comme haletante Dans le silence entendais un à un aux arbres du verger Les fruits tomber de branche en branche je respirais un parfum messager De fleurs lointaines sur le vent Souvent Je croyais qu on avait parlé bas Et un jour que je rêvais ne dormant pas J entendis par delà les prés et la rivière Chanter des flûtes  Then there is an excellent example in English in Fiona Macleod s The Founts of Song  Oh Poet said the Pine Thine Is that song Not mine I have known it loved it long Nothing I know of what the wild winds cry Through dusk and storm and night Or prophesy When tempests whirl us with their awful might Only I know that when The poet s voice is heard Among the woods The infinite pain from out the hearts of men Is sweeter than the voice of wave or branch or bird In these dumb solitudes   Editorial Comments  In both these cases there is rhyme And the French almost always rhyme their vers libre even when it is written as plain prose For instance Paul Fort s Sur le Pont au Change  Sept heures vont sonner à l horloge du Palais L occident sur Paris est comme un lac d or plein Dans Vest nuageux gronde un orage incertain L air est chaud par bouffées à peine l on respire Et je songe à Manon et deux fois je soupire L air est chaud par bouffées et berce l odeur large de ces fleurs qu on écrase On soupire en voyant de frais courants violets s étirer sous les arches du Pont Neuf qui poudroie sur le soleil mourant Tu le sais toi Manon si je t ai bien aimée L orage gronde au loin L air est chaud par bouffées  This is written as metrical prose but on account of the constantly recurring rhyme it seems to be distinctly  vers libre  A remarkable example of Unrhymed vers libre is Rem de Gourmont s Litanies de la Rose  Fleur hypocrite  Fleur du silence  Rose couleur de cuivre plus frauduleuse que nos joies rose  couleur de cuivre embaume nous dans tes mensonges  fleur hypocrite fleur du silence  where the return is so happily got by the repetition of words I am sorry that space forbids its quotation entire  One more example of metrical prose from The House of Usna by Fiona Macleod I am the voice of the House of Usna I am the voice in the wind crying for ever and ever Kings shall lie in the dust great princes shall be brought to shame the champions of the mighty shall be as swordsmen waving reeds as spearmen spearing the grass as men pursuing and wooing shadows   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The question is so much a matter of ear that it is only by examples that it can really be illustrated But anyone who takes the trouble to read these quotations aloud and listen attentively will instantly feel the difference between them and detect the subtle and delicate gradations by which they fade into poetry at one end and prose at the other Amy Lowell  HOMAGE TO WILFRID BLUNT  On Sunday January 18th a committee of poets Messrs W B Yeats T Sturge Moore Frederic Manning John Masefield Victor Plarr F S Flint Richard Aldington and Ezra Pound presented to Wilfrid Scawen Blunt in token of homage a reliquary carved in Pentelican marble by the brilliant young sculptor Gaudier Brzeska ornamented with a female nude recumbent and an inscription Homage to Wilfrid Blunt  Mr Blunt is perhaps known in America rather for his various political martyrdoms than for his poems His claims upon posterity would however be sufficiently established if he had written no more than the double sonnet With Esther  He who has once been happy is for aye Out of destruction s reach His fortune then Holds nothing secret and Eternity Which is a mystery to other men Has like a woman given him its joy Time is his conquest Life if it should fret Has paid him tribute He can bear to die   Editorial Comment  He who has once been happy When I set The world before me and survey its range Its mean ambitions its scant fantasies The shreds of pleasure which for lack of change Men wrap around them and call happiness The poor delights which are the tale and sum Of the world s courage in its martyrdom  When I hear laughter from a tavern door When I see crowds agape and in the rain Watching on tiptoe and with stifled roar To see a rocket fired or a bull slain When misers handle gold when orators Touch strong men s hearts with glory till they weep When cities deck their streets for barren wars Which have laid waste their youth and when I keep Calmly the count of my own life and see On what poor stuff my manhood s dreams were fed Till I too learn d what dole of vanity Will serve a human soul for daily bread Then I remember that I once was young And lived with Esther the world s gods among  Mr Blunt is about the last man who has been able  to use the old fashioned Elizabethan grand style  effectively  The reliquary contained the following verses of  homage signed by the committee  Because you have gone your individual gait Written fine verses made mock of the world Swung the grand style not made a trade of art Upheld Mazzini and detested institutions  We who are little given to respect Respect you and having no better way to show it Bring you this stone to be some record of it  Beneath this there was an interesting collection of manuscripts Mr Manning s Korè Mr Plarr s Epita   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  phium Cytheristriae from the first book of the old Rhymers Club Mr Moore s The Dying Swan an unpublished poem by Mr Yeats called When Helen Lived The Return Mr Masefield s Truth Mr Flint s Third Poem in Unrhymed Cadence and Mr Aldington s In Via Sistina  Mr Blunt said in his speech of acceptance that this was the first time in his life that any admiration of his poetry had been expressed to him that he had been honored only as a politician and as a breeder of horses  The committee had proposed a large dinner of honor but Mr Blunt pleaded age as an excuse and preferred to receive the committee in private This he did with great charm regaling us with the roast flesh of peacocks at Newbuildings a sixteenth century defensible grange in Sussex  Had he accepted the dinner he might have had about him all the reputable poets of England save those who hold official positions for he is a little Englander and has never ceased to protest against the tyrannies and swindles of the Empire a Semitic invention of Disraeli s As it was the committee may be considered representative of the present vitality of English verse although there were among the younger men unavoidable omissions as follows Mr D H Lawrence who is in Italy Mr Padraic Colum now in Ireland Mr James Joyce in Austria and Mr Rupert Brooke somewhere in the South Pacific Still it was a fairly complete sort of tribute representing no one clique or style but a   Editorial Commen  genuine admiration for the power behind all expression for the spirit behind the writing Mr Yeats replying for the committee summarized this admiration as follows  When you published your first work it was at the very height of the Victorian period The abstract poet was in a state of glory One no longer wrote as a human being with an address living in a London street having a definite income and a definite tradition but one wrote as an abstract personality One was expected to be very much wiser than other people The only objection to such a conception of the poet was that it was impossible to believe he existed Now instead of abstract poetry you wrote verses which were good poetry because they were first of all fine things to have thought or to have said in some real situation in life We are now at the end of Victorian romance completely at an end One may admire Tennyson but one can not read him If I take up today some of the things that interested me in the past I can no longer use them They bore me Every year some part of my poetical machinery suddenly becomes of no use  Stendhal said it some time ago and said it rather better for he was writing instead of speaking impromptu  La poésie avec ses comparaisons obligées sa mythologie que ne croit pas le poète sa dignité de style à la Louis XIV et tout l attirail de ses ornements appelés poétiques est bien au dessous de la prose dès qu il s agit
