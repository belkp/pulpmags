ever tasted anywhere in the WorldMary Garden THE LITTLE REVIEW THE VALET by Djuna Barnes THE fields about Louis Georges house grew green in early springleaving the surrounding country in melancholly grayfor Louis Georges was the only man who sowed his ground to ryeLouis Georges was of small statureHis face was oblongtoo paleA dry mouth lay crookedly beneath a nose ending in a slight bulbHis long animal like arms swung half a rhythm ahead of his legsHe prided himself on his farmingthough he knew nothing about itHe surveyed the tender coming green with kindly good naturehis acres were always a month ahead of his neighbors in their debutSometimes standing in the doorwaybreathing through the thick hair in his nostrilsstreching his gloveshe would look at the low lying sheds and the stables and the dull brown patches of ploughed earthand mutterSplendidsplendid Finally he would stroll in among the cattle wherein dizzy circleslarge colored flies swayedemitting a soft insistent drone like taffeta rubbed against taffetaHe liked to think that he knew a great deal about horsesHe would look solemnly at the trainer and discuss length of neckthinness and shape of flank by the hourstroking the hocks of his pet racerSometimes he would say to Vera Sovna There s more real breeding in the rump of a mare than in all the crowned heads of England Sometimes he and Vera Sovna would play in the hayand about the grain binsShe in her long flouncesleaping in and outscreaming and laughingstamping her high heelssetting up a great commotion among her rufflesOnce Louis Georges caught a ratbare handedand with such Leah would spend hours in the gardenher little one crawling after herleaving childish smears on the dusty leaves of the growing corndigging his hands into the vegetable topsfalling and pretending to have fallen on purposegrinning up at the sun foolishly until his eyes wateredThese two women and Louis GeorgesvaletVankamade up the householdsaving occasional visits from Louis GeorgesauntsMyra and EllaThis man Vanka was a mixture of Russian and JewHe bit his nailstalked of the revolutionmoved clumsilyHis clothes fitted him badlyhe pomaded his hairwhich was reddish yellowpulled out the short hairs that tormented his throatand from beneath his white brows distributed a kindly intelligent lookThe most painful thing about him was his attempt to seem alerthis effort to keep pace with his masterLouis Georges would sayWellnow Vankawhat did they do to you in Russia when you were a boyThey shot my brother for a red Vanka would answerpulling the hairs They threw him into prisonand my sister took him his foodOne day our father was also arrestedthen she took two dinner pails instead of oneAnd once she heard a noiseit sounded like a shotand our father returned her one of the pailsThey say he looked up at her like a man who is gazed at over the shoulder He had told the tale oftenadding My sister became almost bald later onyet she was a handsome womanthe students used to come to her chambers to hear her talk At such times Louis George would excuse himself and shut himself up to writein a large and scrawling handletters to his aunts with some of Vanka s phrases in themSometimes Vera Sovna would come in to watch himlifting her rufflesraising her browsTooshe would turn and look for a long time at Vanka who returned her look with cold persistencethe way of a man who is afraidwho does not approveand yet who likesShe would stand with her back to the fireplaceher high heels a little aparttapping the stretched silk of her skirtsaying You will ruin vour eyes adding Vankawon t you stop him She seldom got answers to her remarksLouis Georges would continuegrunting at herto be sureand smilingbut never lifting his eyesand as for Vanka he would stand therecatching the sheets of paper as they were finishedskill that it could not biteHe disguised his pride in showing it to her by pretending that he had done so to inform her of the rodent menace to winter grainVera Sovna was a tall creature with thin shouldersshe was always shrugging them as if her shoulder blades were heavyShe dressed in black and laughed a good deal in a very high keyShe had been a great friend of Louis Georgesmotherbut since her death she had fallen into disreputeIt was hinted that she wassomethingto Louis Georgesand when the townsfolk and neighboring landholders saw her enter the house they would not content themselves until they saw her leave itIf she came out holding her skirts crookedly above her thin anklesthey would find the roofs of their mouths in sudden disapprovalwhile if she walked slowlydragging her dressthey would say See what a dust Vera Sovna brings up in the drivewayshe stamps as if she were a mareIf she knew anything of this feelingshe never showed itShe would drive through the town and turn neither to right or left until she passed the markets with their bright yellow gourds and squashestheir rosy apples and their splendid tomatoesexhaling an odor of decaying sunlightOn the rare occasions when Louis Georges accompanied her she would cross her legs at the kneeleaning forward pointing a finger at himshaking her headlaughingSometimes she would go into the maidsquarters to play with Leah s childa little creature with weak legs and neckwho always thrust out his stomach for her to patThe maidsBerthe and Leahwere well built complacent women with serene blue eyesquite far apartand good mouths in which fine teeth grew gratefully and upon whom round ample busts flourished like plantsThey went about their work singing or chewing long green salad leavesIn her youth Leah had done something for which she prayed at intervalsHer memory was always taking her hastily away to kneel before the gaudy wax Christ that hung on a beam in the barnResting her head against the boards she would lift her work worn handsbosom highsighingprayingmurmuringOr she would help Berthe with the milkingthrowing her thick ankles under the cow s uddersbringing down a sudden fury of milkshining and splashing over her big clean knucklessaying quietlyevenly I think we will have rain before dawn And her sister would answer Yesbefore dawn Finally Louis Georges would push back his chairsaying Comewe will have tea In the end he fell into a slow illnessIt attacked his limbshe was forced to walk wth a caneHe complaned of his heartbut he persisted in going out to look at the horsesto the barn to amuse Vera Sovnaswaying a little as he watched the slow circling fliessniff ng the pleasant odors of cow s milk and dungHe still had plans for the haying seasonfor his cropsbut he gave them over to his farm handswholeft to themselveswandered aimlessly horrte at odd hoursAbout six months later he took to his bedHis aunts cametesting with their withered noses the smell of decaying wood and paragoricwhispering thathe never used to get like this Raising their ample shoulders to ease the little black velvet straps that sunk into their fleshthey sat on either side of his bedThey looked at each other in a pitifully surprised wayThey had never seen illnessand death but once a suicideand this they understoodone has impulsesbut not maladiesThey were afraid of meeting Vera SovnaTheir position was a difficult onehaving been on friendly terms while Louis Georgesmother livedthey had nevertheless to maintain a certain dignity and reserve when the very towns folk had turned against herTherefore they left her an hour in the evening to herselfShe would ccme creeping in saying Oh my dear telling him long unheard stories about a week she had spent in LondonA curious week full of near adventurewith amusing tales of hotel keepersnobilityAnd sometimes leaning close to himthat he might hearhe saw that she was weepingBut in spite of this and of his illness and the new quality in the airVera Sovna was strangely gayDuring this illness the two girls served as nurseschanging the sheetsturning him overrubbing him with alcoholbringing him his soupcrossing themselvesVanka stool long hours by the beside coughingSometimes he would fall off into sleepat others he would try to talk of the revolutionVera Sovna had taken to dining in the kitchena long bare room that nleased herFrom the window one could sec the orchards and the pump and the long slope down to the edge of the meadowAnd the room was pleasant to look uponThe tablelike the earth itselfwas simple and abundantIt might have been a meadow that Leah and Berthe browsed inred cheekedgaining healthstrengthGreat hamssmoked fowl with oddly taut legs hung from the beamsand under these the girls moved as if there were some bond between themThey accepted Vera Sovna s company cheerfully uncomplaininglyand when she went away they cleared up her crumbsthinking and talking of other thingsforgettingNothing suffered on account of his illnessThe household matters went smoothlythe crops ripenedthe haying season passedand the sod in the orchards sounded with the thud of ripe falling fruitLouis Georges suffered alonedetachedas if he had never beenEven about Vera Sovna there was a strange quiet brilliancythe brilliancy of one who is about to receive somethingShe caressed the medicine bottlestended the flowersLeah and Berthe were unperturbedexcept from overworkthe face of Vanka alone changedHe bore the expression at once of a man in pain and of a man who is about to come into peaceThe flickering light in Louis Georgesface cast its shadow on that of his valetMyra and Ella became gradually excitedThey kept brushing imaginary specks of dust from their shoulders and bodicessending each other in to observe himThey comforted themselves looking at himpretending each to the other that he was quite improvedIt was not so much that they were sorry to have him dieas it was that they were not prepared to have him dieWhen the doctor arrived they shifted their burden of worryThey bought medicine with great relishhurriedlyFinally to lessen the torment they closed their eyes as they sat on either side of his bedpicturing him already deadlaid outhands crossedthat they might gain comfort upon opening themto find him still aliveWhen they knew that he was really dying they could not keep from touching himThey tried to cover him up in those parts that exposed too plainly his illnessthe thin throatthe damp pulsing spot in the neckThey fondled his handsdriving doctor and nurse into a passionAt lastin desperationMyra knelt by his bedtouched his facestroked his cheekstrying to break the monotonous calm of approaching deathDeath did not seem to be anywhere in him saving in his faceit seemed to Myra that to drive it from his eyes would mean lifeAnd it was then that she and hqr sister were locked outto wander up and down the hallafraid to speakafra d to weepunless by that much they might hasten his deathWhen he finally diedthey had the problem of Vera SovnaBut they soon forgot her trying to follow the orders left by the dead manLouis Georges had been very careful to see to it that things should go on growinghe had given many ordersplanned new seasonstalked ofnext year knowing that he would not be thereThe hens cackled with splendid performancesthe stables resounded with the good spirits of the horsesthe fields were all but shedding their very life on the earth as Vanka moved noiselessly aboutfolding the dead man s clothesWhen the undertaker arrived Vanka would not let them touch the bodyHe washed and dressed it to suit himselfIt was he who laid Louis Georges in the shiny coffinit was he who arranged the flowersand he finally left the room on the flat of his whole noisy feet for the first time in yearsHe went to his own room overlooking the gardenHe paced the roomIt seemed to him that he had left something undoneHe had loved service and orderhe did not know that he also loved Louis Georgeswho made service necessary and order desirableThis distressed himhe rubbed his handsholding them close to his mouthas if by the sound of one hand passing over the other he might learn some secret in the stoppage of soundLeah had made a scenehe thought of thatA small enough sceneconsideringShe had brought her baby indropping him beside the bodygiving the flat voiced Now you can play with him a minute He had not interferedthe child had been too frightened to disturb the cold excellence of Louis Georgesarrangementand Leah had gone out soon enough in stolid silenceHe could hear them descending the stepsher heavy slow tread followed by the quxk uneven movements of the childVanka could hear the rustling of the trees in the gardenthe call of an owl from the barnone of the mares whinnied andstampingfell off into silence againHe opened the windowHe thought he caught the sound of feet on the pebbles that bordered the hydrangea bushesa faint perfume such as the flounces of Vera Sovna exhaled came to himIrritated he turned away when he heard her calling Vankacomemy foot is caught in the vine Her facewith wide hanging lipscame above the silland the same moment she jumped into the roomThey stood looking at each otherThey had never been alone together beforeHe did not know what to doShe was a little disheveledtwigs from the shrubbery clung to the black flounces of her gownShe raised her thin shoulders oncetwiceand sighedShe reached out her armwhispering Vanka He moved away from herstaring at her Vanka she repeated and came closeleaning a little on himIn a voice of commandshe said simply You must tell me somethingI will tell youhe answered automatically Seelook at your hands

glass eyes To propagate PROHIBITION AND ART OF CONVERSATION by John Butler Yeats HOW is it that every American whether man or womanhere in his own country or abroad in Europepossesses the genius of acquaintanceshipand why is it that the English possess so little of this delightful quality that it is hardly an exaggeration to say that there are in England old married couples wholiving in absolute loyaltyare not and never will be real acquaintancesneither of them knowing or caring what the other thinksThe answer is that class is an English institution and has the character of the peopleand that it has never been adopted in this countryIn an American train if two people like each other s looks they follow the natural impulse and become acquaintedIn England we examine each otherunder such circumstanceswith suspicious criticismbecause notwithstanding appearancewe might not be of the same classEvery Englishman is of classdown to the cats meal manand classes do not associateThe inferior class would indeed fraternize readily enough with the higher classbut to that the other would not consentThe social atmosphere in England is dark and chilly as its November skiesAnd this Novemberweather penetrates everywherenot merely keeping men apartbecause of different classbut encouraging strangeness and aloofness as a habit and social lawso that every Englishman remains solitarywith his friendseven with his wifeComing to this country some ten years agoIbeing of friendly and social kind and a portrait painter interested in physiognomynothing delighted me so much as my sudden escape from class restrictionI found that everywhere I went I could speak to the man whose face attracted meHe would not rebuff meHe had neither the sulkiness of my inferior nor the haughtiness of my superioranddoing our best to be mutally agreeablegood manners flourished and often in the train there was good conversationwithout which life would be unendurableYetthese last few weeksit has been borne in on me that classeven the rigid unbending class of Englandhas its advantagesfor it is only too evident that this country is in its social and moral relations cyclonicwhile England enjoys a peaceful mental and moral climatethe skies undisturbedexcept for an occasional breezea mere zephyronly enough to ruffle the anglican seas of 12 The Little Review stagnation and dullnessBecause of class Englishmen do not think alike and are resolved to resist as long as possible every attempt to make them do soA family named Smith will not hold the same opinion as a family called Brownif they re of different classone being in the retail trade and the other in the wholesaleAnd then there is the enduring distinction between the people who are in business and those who are outside itand so it is everywhereBefore any opinion can get possession of the national mind it has to knock at so many doors and explain itself so often and meet this and that objection that the process is long and tedious and the result a compromisebut one from which every kind of violence and extreme is purged in the original propositionIn America it is differentHere the aim of every American is to think as his neighbors doThe Englishman thinks as his class doesand he likes to remember that the aim of his class is to divide itself in forced hostility from every other classHenceit comes about that Americain its politicsin its mannersin what it reads and thinks is cyclonicand England anticyclonicThere is plenty of gun powder in England but the grains are so widely separated thet a general conflagration is more than difficultThereforeI saysadlythat if you will have democracydemocracy must guard itself against its own failings by establishing in its midst the institution of classThat Americans should be condemned to put away their good manners and easy charm and virile friendlinessand adopt in their place the churlishness and sulky hostility of English bad mannersis a dreadful thoughtYetwhat other remedy is there against the evef recuring democratic cycloneWe are now in the midst of a great cyclone and perhaps a succession of themfor I am told prohibition is to be followed by a movement against tobaccoIt is a genuine cyclone with all the characteristicsIt has come from nowhereand it came swiftlyand it is so violent that it destroys what is good as well as what is badThe innocent suffering with the guiltyThe innocent who are innumerable and the guilty who are comparatively few in numberandas the years go bygrowing fewer every day that passesAnd this is not at allfor there are good and prudent men whowith their familiespeople of the highest charactersas good citizensmust also sufferFor is not their property to be destroyedVast sums anxiously put into what seemed good investmentsI said just now this cydonic movement has come from nowhereYet beyond a doubtits birth has been in the feminine mindThe woman has no sense of propertyshe has not the feeling because we have never allowed her to own anythingIf among children you give anything to a little girl at once she is ready to give it awaygive it to a boyif he be normal he will carry it away where he can lock it up in selfish securityHe has the sense of property which she is withoutAgainthe missionary spiritwhich is one of the curses of Americaand of every society and every household into whichit entersand of poetry itself which we are told must be upliftingThis desire to improve your neighbor by making him adopt all your ideas and be as like yourself as possiblereaches its most aggravating form in the female mindThere is also such a thing as feminine venganceIt is a fact that through all the past and every where except in the highest aristocratic circles of Europewoman has been a subject raceHumiliated and crushed by husbands and fathers and brothersShe has at last asserted herself andbeing as it is a servile warvengeance is one of its objectsOf courseshe she does not say soBold frankness and sincerity are not feminine characteristicsAll the sameall over America in every homein the big house and in the little cottagesthe women are triumphant and vengeance smiles in their eyesWe men are now in our turn to have a case of subjectionFirst goes the drinkand then tobaccoIt is our consolationhoweverto know that they won t abolish themselvesPerhaps indeed they calculate thatevery other temptation being removedthey themselves will remain the one sovereign temptationand be sure they will not start any sumptuary lawsTo the last they will paintthey will trick themselves out and make themselves armourously delightfulNor shall we objecton this matterat any ratethere will be on our part no resentmentThey can never be too charmingtoo temptingWe both can sayLet temptation flourish which brings me to another great distinction of man or womanWe men believe in temptation and would walk surrounded and wooed by it in our heartswe think of temptation as invitationwhich any manaccording to his knowledge and discretionmay accept or refuseWoman on the other hand would clear life of every temptationmaking it as bare as a barrackyard or a prison dormitoryAnd for that matter I have sometimes met a woman whoif she had the powerwould abolish every other woman except herselfSuch an egotism lurks in the soul of the seductive sexWe men believe that we are here to be temptedthat temptations are the richness and value of life and that we should be free to choose among our temptationswhich we should yield to and which refuseAnd there are cases where we would make some compromiseFor in this wise do men gather experience and learn to know themselves and find out the will of Godgrowing in stature and in strengthand every poet will tell you that if temptations were not numerous and powerful there would be no songs to singThe whole movement is a female originIt has the birthmarkI have said that women are without the feeling of propertyLet me add that they have no feeling for conversationThey do not know what it meansFor one thing they lack the impartial intellectWoman is a contradictory beingShe is devoted in self sacrifice and yet remains a hardened egotistFor many years I belonged to a conversation society in London where sometimesa uxorious member would bring his wifeAs long as she remained in the room there was no real conversationWe thought only of pleasing herIt is what she asked of usThe woman s idea of conversation is a something inspired by herselfTo conversation that is inspired by women I prefer that which is inspired by wineWoman made conversation is mere gallantrythe talk of courts and royal circleswhere as wineaccording to the old proverbis the very spirit of truthNo less is it the spirit of friendlinessI have often dined in tetoal ed housesand though everything was there that taste and wealth could providethe one thing without which nothing mattered was absentThere was no conversationIt did not even beginWe looked at each otheradmired each otherand the ice water circled and I was glad when it was all overIn contrast with thisI rememberthe first evening I dined out in New YorkI was only a few days in the country and at the house to which I was invited I met a company all strange to me andI fanciedto each otherwhenas we sat togetherin embarassed silence and constrained attitudesa footman enteredwith a salver on which were cocktailsto me at that timea noveltyHow gladly all of usmen and women drank theseand with what good will an intelligent acquan tanceship began and talk sprang upI observed afterwards that most of the guests contented themseves with their one cocktailyet all talked with animationThe blessed effect of a few cocktails handed to each of usby the kind hearted footmanFor I am sure he had a kind heartYears ago I belonged to a well known conversation club in IrelandWe were a numerous company and we met every Saturday eveningIt was an important clubfor we discussed current events and at that time current events were momentouswhen are they not so in Irelandyetalthough we met early in the eveningconversation invariably started so late that it finished lateI myself seldom getting home till four in the morningWhy this tedious delay and these unseemly hoursBecause the club was tetotaledHad there been a round of drinkswe should have start edand finished our discussion in time for every decent man to have got home and to bed by twelve o clockThat club was a fascination and I remember it with gratitudeYou heard the latest news and divined politcial secrets andto crown allthe police suspected usbut it spoiled my Saturday night s sleep andby the fatigue that resultedall my Sundayand all because of its damned tetotal ismA little drink is to conversation what a little petroleum is in the lighting of a fireI am told conversation can be started without drinkexactly asif you had the patienceyou might light a fire by rubbing together two sticksBut they must be dry sticksConversation among shy strangerswithout the kindly touch of generous wine is just as impossibleDrink is one of the conveniences of social life as petroleum is of the kitchenHave you ever observed the tetotaler among a company who took their wineWas not the good man invariably a trouble and a kill joyDrink quiets the critical facilitiesIt cuts away the ligatures that bind the wings of the imaginationThat is its high function for which we thank itFor a space it frees the soul from black care and we are free as the birds in the skyThe tetotaler is all criticismand it is destructive criticismConstructive criticism is with us who taste the ruby grape and we like paradoxfor we do historically know that every great movement of thought and speculation has made its first appearance as paradoxand besideswhile it challenges constructive logic to do its bestit baffles the other sortThe man of cold water hates paradox and loves himself andrejoicing in his diabolical lawyer like faculty of destructionproceedes to destroy what he cannot possibly understandParadox embodies desire and of desire he has noneexcept for his own egotistical gloryThe French general who overcame the Germans at Verdune was asked how he did it The Germanshe said thought two and two made fourwhereas we knew they made fiveThat is why we conquered the Germans It was a famous man of genius who remarked thata glass of port wine ripened thought Take away wine from human converseand you hand it over to the pedantsand the womenAmong the enemies of conversationas of life itselfI count the drunkardsas well as the tetotalersand had I my way I would put them all into some large prison that they might torment each otherthe drunkardsbecause they have no drinkand the tetotalersbecause they have no one to scoldno one on whom to exercise their missionary giftI hate the drunkard because he insults my dignity as a manand puts me to shameFor the same reason I detest the prohibitionistwho would turn our cities into prison reformatoriesBut what do women careWhat have they ever cared for the dignity of human natureThat is a Roman thoughtquite beyond their scopeAlaswe have only ourselves to blame and cannot wonder ifeducated as slavesthey manifest the faults of slavesBehind all movements of this kind we invariably find the idle richand particularly their womenThese people leading empty lives would fain persuade themeselves that they are not as useless as they seem to themselves and othersThere is besides to mindsso constitutedthe irresistable attraction of a movement which because of its alleged importance offers them absolution for every kind of misdeed in carrying it outIt is only by struggling with life that people discover the importance of scruple and the moral lifeand these people lead lives in which there is no sort of struggleThere is the irresponsible street boy who will break a window merely because he finds a stoneequally irresponsible are the idle rich and their womenkindThis whole movement is branded with the whimsies and caprices and hysterical nonsense of the rich womenof whom some are very mature in yearsNow finding their charms vanished they would try and recover a lost ascendencyBeauty and youth gone foreverwomen are still interesting because of increase in goodness and wisdomThese withered women have nothing except their money and their frenzied partizanshipIt is lamentable and it is piteousAnger is drowned in pityTurgenieff said of George Sand in her old age that she wassuch a good comrade These matured women of the idle rich are not good comradesFor charm they have only their money and their hard eyed partizanshipThey are new without being lovedThis womanhood is wretchedULYSSES James Joyce Episode IX You were speaking of the gaseous

The Children s Prize printed in letters that pretended to be holly sprigsInside the holly wreath was the number of the yearin fat gold letters1869Soon after Christmas she had another birthdayShe was six years oldShe could write in capitals and count up to a hundred if she were left to do it herselfBesidesGentle Jesusshe could sayCock RobinandThe House that Jack BuiltandThe Lord is my ShepherdandThe Slave in the Dismal Swamp And she could read all her own story bookspicking out the words she knew and making up the restRoddy never made upHe was a big boyhe was eight years oldThe morning after her birthday Roddy and she were sent into the drawing room to MammaA strange lady was thereShe had chosen the high backed chair in the middle of the room with the berlin wool work parrot on itShe sat very uprightstiff and thin between the twisted rosewood pillars of the chairShe was dressed in a black gown made of a great many little bands of rough crape and a few smooth stretches of merinoHer crape veilfolded back over her hathung behind her head in a stiff squareA jet necklace lay flat and heavy on her small chestWhen you had seen all these black thingsshe showed yousuddenlyher whitewounded faceMamma called her Miss ThompsonMiss Thompson s face was so light and thin that you thought it would break if you squeezed itThe skin was drawn tight over her jaw and the bridge of her nose and the sharp naked arches of her eye bonesShe looked at you with mournfulstartled eyes that were too large for their lidsand her flat chin trembled slightly as she talked This is Rodney she saidas if she were repeating a lesson after MammaRodney leaned up against Mamma and looked proud and handsomeShe had her arm round himand every now and then she pressed it tighter to draw him to herselfMiss Thompson said after Mamma And this is Mary Her mournful eyes moved and sparkled as if she had suddenly thought of something for herself I am sure she said they will be very good Mamma shook her headas much as to say Miss Thompson must not build on itEvery week day from ten to twelve Miss Thompson came and taught them readingwriting and arithmeticEvery Wednesday at half past eleven Daniel s tutuorMrSippettlooked in and taught RodneyMensaa table Mamma told them they must never be naughty with Miss Thompson because her mother was deadThey went away and talked about her among the gooseberry bushes at the bottom of the garden I don t know how we re going to manage Rodney said There s no sense in saying we mustn t be naughty because her mother s deadI suppose Mary said it would make her think she s deaderWe can t help thatWe ve got to be naughty sometimeWe mustn t begin Mary said If we begin we shall have to finish They were good for four days from ten to twelveAnd at a quarter past twelve on the fifth day Mamma found Mary crying in the dining room OhMaryhave you been naughty she said Nobut I shall be to morrow I ve been so good that I can t keep on any longer Mamma took her in her lapShe looked pleasedas if Mary had said what she had wanted her to say Being good when it pleases you isn t being good she said It s not what Jesus means by being goodGod wants us to be good all the timelike JesusBut Jesus and me is differentHe wasn t able to be naughtyAnd I m not able to be goodNot nil the timeYou re not able to be good of your own will and in your own strengthYou re not good till God makes you goodDid God make me naughtyNoGod couldn t make anybody naughtyNot if he tried hard NoBut Mamma saidspeaking very fast he ll make you good if you ask himWill he make me good if I don t ask himNo said Mamma You must want to be good before you ask himI do wantAhAnd What makes you want Mamma lowered her head to youholding it straight and stillShe was watchingready to pounce if you said the wrong thing What what you told meMiss Thompson s motherBecause she s deadThat won t do Mamma said You must want to be good because God wants you to be goodand not because you re sorry for Miss Thompson 11 Miss Thompson She was always sure you would be goodAnd Mamma was sure you wouldn t beor thatif you wereit would be for some bad reason like being sorry for Miss ThompsonAs long as Roddy was in the room Mary was sorry for Miss ThompsonAnd when she was left alone with her she was frightenedThe squeezing and dragging under her waist began when Miss Thompson pushed her gentlemournful face close up to see what she was doingShe was afraid of Miss Thompson because her mother was deadShe kept on thinking about Miss Thompson s motherMiss Thompson s mother would be like Jenny in bed with her cap offand she would be like the dead dormouse that Roddy found in the laneShe would lie on the bed with her back bent and her head hanging loose like the dear little dormouseand her legs would be turned up over her stomach like histoes and fingers clawing togetherWhen you touched her she would be cold and stifflike the dormouseThey had wrapped her up in a white sheetRoddy said dead people were always wrapped up in white sheetsAnd MrChapman had put her into a coffin like the one he was making when he gave Dank the wood for the rabbit s houseEvery time Miss Thompson came near her she saw the white sheet and smelt the sharpbitter smell of the coffinIf she was naughty Miss Thompsonwho seemed to have forgottenwould remember that her mother was deadIt might happen any minuteIt never didFor Miss Thompson said you were good if you The Little Review 43 knew your lessonsand at the same time you were not naughty if you didn t know themYou might not know them to daybut you would know them tomorrow or the next dayBy midsummer Mary could read the books that Dank readIf it had not been for MrSippett andMensaa table she would have known as much as RoddyAlmost before they had time to be naughty Miss Thompson had goneMamma said that Roddy was not getting on fast enoughVi The book that Aunt Bella had brought her was calledThe Triumph over Midian and Aunt Bella said that if she was a good girl it would interest herBut it did not interest herThat was how she heard Aunt Bella and Mamma talking togetherMamma s foot was tapping on the

thinking ofbringing her clown hereThey want to be near EmiliusThey think he ll look after herIt was Victor who would have her at homeand Victor might look after her himselfShe was his favourite sisterHe doesn t want to be too responsibleThey think Emilius ought to take his share Aunt Bella whispered somethingAnd Mamma said Stuff and nonsenseNo more than you or IOnly you never know what queer

that made him look enormousHe had twirled back his moustache to show his rich red mouthHe had put something on his beard that smelt sweetYou noticed for the first time how the frizzledred brown mass sprang from a peak of silky golden hair under his pouting lower lipHe was letting himself gently up and down with the tips of his toesand he was smilingsecretlyas if he had just thought of something

big arm chair by the hearth rugand Mamma on the parrot chairEND OF BOOK ITHE LITTLE REVIEW EditorMargaret Anderson Foreign EditorsJohn Rodker Jules Romains Advisory Boardjh DISCUSSION Playing the Piano as a Modern Art by Margaret Anderson I HAVE had some twenty five letters asking me to continue the discussion about piano playing begun in the last numberwhy theolder standardsof playing restrict the full vibrations of the pianoThis is an unexpected response and I hasten to unburden myselfPiano playing as it has been taught for years has ignorantly overlooked the necessity of adapting the mechanism of the body to the mechanism of the instrumentI suppose because the mechanism of the body has been considered the province of physicians and only lately have the psychologists begun to develop a definite science of the interdependence of mental and physical coordinationA tight rope walker has always used his whole body to make his feet do what he wished upon a wirePianists have always been taught to use their fingers and hands and arms for everything they wish to achieve on the pianoHave any of the teachers talked of back and shoulder musclesof the rhythms that centre in the spine and can be set in motion by a flexible waist lineor controlled by the position of the body on the piano stool and the distribution of weight and balance of the feet upon the floorBecause of all this pianists usually do one kind of thing well and assume that the things they can t do well belong outside their temperamental equipmentOf course much of this is truebut the good modern piamst shows where it does not hold trueFor instancethe older pianist will be orchestral in everythingor delicate in everythingor brilliantly hard in everythingor play always as if the piano were a spinetor always as if it were an organThe modern pianist tries to combine all these registers He develops a method of technique that gives his instrument the range of a fully equipped modern orchestraIt is this that I like to call hiskeyboard It is an entirely different idea of the pianomodern music has made it necesaryand the intelligent use of the body has made it possibleGabrilowitsch is one of the best examples I know of the old school of playingHe is looked upon by musicians who are an tigonistic tomoderntheories as the pianist with a beautiful toneHe has a beautiful tone in pure melody passageshe has no tone at all when he tries to play the big organ passages of Cesar Franck Therefore we don t speak of him as a pianist with tonewe say he has no keyboardThis could easily be remediedThere is no temperamental barrier to prevent MrGabrilowitsch making the piano sound like an orchestra when he wishes toHe can conduct an orchestraand he shows plainly that he wants to make the piano pour out orchestral soundHe works pitifully for these effects with all the muscles of fingersarms and neckthe rest of his body is tight and rigidand the result is that he never strikes a chord that is not tight and hardcompletely unresonantHarold Bauer is perhaps the best example of the modern pianist in this countryHis keyboard is absolutely comprehensivehe achieves all the gamut of sounds so far demonstrated as piano possibilitieswith the exception of the so called pearly toneand this is a temperamental preference rather than a temperamental limitationone look at MrBauer will tell you that he has never been interested in pearlnessBut since this article is intended as a pedagogical treatise I am going to talk only of how MrBauer produces these tone qualitiesnot why he produces themthough of course thewhyis the cause of thehow Harold Bauerseated at the pianooffers an example of a properly coordinated bodyAs he raises his hands above the keys you can follow the movement of backshoulder and arm muscles that allows his fingers to strike the keys in a certain wayYou can watch him demonstrating that a tiger is stronger than an oxhe shows you how to get the fullest vibrations by pouncing on the keys rather than by merely striking themHe demonstrates the thing a carpenter knowsthat to hold a hammer by the neck will give no force or swing or rhythm to the blowThe sum total of such a coordination is thiswith all the varied and complicated action of the fingers themselves there is a continuous up and down legato movement of the armscontrolled from the spinevery similar to the undulating arm movements of a dancerby which alone it is possible to put upon the stringsdirectly and uninterruptedlythe dramatic conception of the musicSUSAN GLASPELL S PLAY BERNICEA Great Drama THE dominant character in the play Bernice lies dead in a room adjoining the living room of the country house in which the three acts of the drama take placeThat in itself is a daring move which imposes a severe task upon the author s knowledge and artBut she was dealing with the good psychological fundamental that the past is the richest in glamor and charmThe success of the playfor it is a great dramais due to the vivid portrayal of the admirable traits of Bernice which serve as a background upon which the weaknessesstrengthsfoiblesof the other characters are thrown in contrasting colorsa unified personality versus a series of dissociated personalitiesall very humanBernicethe wife of Craig Norrisa popular writerwho died while the husband was in New York upon a love adventure with another womanis shown as a sort of earthly flowering of the AbsoluteThe continual inspiration she was to her relatives and friends is felt by the audience themselves throughout the playShe was a typicalonce bornof William Jameslovingthoughtfulgayat peace with lifefree from maliceclear headedunselfishShe knew about and was indulgent to Craig s amoursShe loved her associates for the good in them and laughed at their foibles with a good humor that even the victims enjoyedBut what made her uniquely lovcable and inspiring was that her friends saw in her an embodiment ofthe whole of life with agift for being herself And she wanted each one to have a chance to be himself This background is developed and ever richened to suit the dramatic situations that result when the temperaments of the various characters come in conflictWe seeloveand sympathize with Bernice from curtain to curtainCraigthe husbandis an egoist who brings to mind in the drawing and with no disparagment to Susan Glaspell s arta comparison with Sir Willoughby in George Meredith sThe Egoist If anything the lines of Craig are more expressive because of the terseness of drama in contrast with the verbal resources of the novelCraig s egotism is supremeit even triumphs over the remorse that one would expect from a man who has been led to believe that Bernice s death was self inflicted because of her love for himHis lack of power toreshape Berncie to dominate hertoget toher who wasthe whole of life are some of the egotistic manifestations which impelled Craig to seek in other and feebler women the compensations which his neurotic character demanded to attain the feeling of security necessary to his adjustment to the worldThe author plumbs Craigand his banal writingsthus Did you ever see a child try to do something fail and then turn to something he could do and make a great show of doing thatYour life is a continuous attempt to appear effective to persuade yourself you arc something These lines are spoken by Margaretthe finest of the living characters in the playBernice s closest friendwho arrives at the house without knowing of her deathMargaretan idealistuncompromising in her fidelity to her intelligent conception of moralityhas devoted her life to the cause of freedom of thought and speech to the extent of working for the people imprisoned for their ideasHer clashes with Craigwhose life is known to herare frequentvarieddramaticshe exposes him to himself ruthlesslybut rarely does she penetrate his selfish coverMargaret comes to us as a power whenin the first actAbbie the servant who had loved and lived for Bernice all of the latter s lifetells Craig that Bernice killed herselfMargaret accepts Abbie s statement as true but cannot reconcile the act with what Bernice stood for in lifeIt seemed to her like hatred pettyMargaret s intuitions were believed in by herself and everybody who knew herher clairvoyance put Abbie through a third degree which finally forced the confession that Bernice died of natural causes but had made a dying request of Abbie to tell Craig the lie that would make him believe Bernice loved him better than her beautiful life itselfOf course Margaret s impulse is to judge Craig by her standards pi Tightness instead of Bernice sto tell him of the lieThis leads to two of the strongest scenes in the playthe conflicts beween two good womenAbbie and Margaretand between Margaret s goodness and Craig s weaknessAbbie wins the day for Bernice by the wisdom And when you take that away from him what do you give to him Craig unconsciously helps in the victory by flaunting to Margaret his supreme egotism in crowing that Bernice killed herself for love of himit proved thatevery bit of Bernicebelonged to himMargaret saw that what would have been remorse in a normal person was but a highly sublimated egotism in CraigShe yielded to what she characterized as Bernice s superiorinsightandcourage and refrains from telling Craig the truth about the deathThe denouement is the weak part of the play if one judges it by the high standards of knowledge and intelligence which the author herself has set and maintained up to that pointShe gives a vivid picture of a man whose self centredness has scarcely an extenuating featurethe mechanism of his egoism is probably beyond the therapeutic effects of the shock of his wife s death for love s sakeit is fixatedHoweverthis criticsm may possibly be more a reflection upon human nature than upon Susan Glaspell s artWomen do love as Bernice didand sometimes but very rarelysuch love as Craig thought Bernice had proved for him does work its cureand sometimes even great characters like Bernice do resort to acts incongruous with their general make upsGranted all these possibilitiesthe plot is still weak at that point because it fails in the psychological ensemble which the author has built up with such great knowledge and skill in practically all other detailsOne is inclined to the belief that the playafter allis but an expression of hopewoman s hopeand that in its expression and exposition there enters an element of the operation of the unconscious self of which the author is herself unawareAt any rate the play is one which will livebecause of it ainsightor itscouragecombined with skill in making subtle situationsoften only nuancesdramatically movingThe Provincetown Players have scored a triumph with an important playsuperbly actedpatly dissoluble as you presume Which is whatI can see often on the faces of those about usCan t you too sometimes see it if you listen to people s eyesBut let us not get too far afield here but on to your finalities and then to mineAnd so through my digression to your paragraph that followsYou write Taking for her hero a man without the power she gives him power such an idea that a man without power ever gains it through any source is a lie If he s got it he must have attained it or do you mean that if he has it that is the powerful manthat he always had it or in reality is itThe dilema is too fraughtI do not care whether or not Miss Glaspe ll sheroas you call him has itWhat does concern me is that her heroineher Ber nicedid have itand through the amazing art of Miss Glaspell s method we are made thrillingly conscious of the factThere s the themeMargaret AndersonThe play according to your premise of what is all or nothing in a playdoes nt concern the husband at allIf you must have a character use power to stir the lives of others why seek out the powerless and say he hasn t got it and therefore that the play is not a playWho do you thus strangely neglect BerniceIs it because you think she isn t in the playAs for me I think that what Miss Glaspell really meant wasthat there really isn t anybody in the play expect BerniceIt s her power that s dramatisedIf you have missed thissurelythe lack of power isn t entirely Miss Glaspell sBut for a moment back to your hero and what wre can deduct from the predicament your Ye left him inWhat is to become of all of us if power is not to be attainedAre most of us powerlessly finished before we are begunThat s the ugly wraith of a determ nism that would justify the picturesque progression of burnt babies with which Shelley regales usI think it is in theRevolt of Islam What have you doneMargaret AndersonSent to the limbo of the not needed all those nice old fashioned prophylactics like education and healing and medicine and hopeall those thread bare illusions that drug us with a sense of powerThe issue in which you print it should be confiscatedYou have robbed us of our dreamsYou have sat thirteen at the table and in publicYou have pillfered us of the beautiful happy lie in our soulsFrom us who had not you have taken that which we didn t haveIt was nt nice of youAren t you sorry that you said itPause a second ere you smite us with the hideous thought than we can never be better than we arethat we are powerless to gain power if we An Important Play by Philip Moeller My dear Margaret AndersonYou ask me if I am not going to hold forth about Susan Glaspell s playI hasten to assure you that such a suggestion is an amazingly dangerous oneNever give an enthusiast the chance to hold forthrather hold him downforce him to take intellectual breathI shall try to go a quiet pace though my admiration for Miss Glaspell s play urges me to quick praiseIt is youMargaret Andersonwho have rushed in fluttering your mental wings into a very hell of theoryYou tell in some few sentences what is nt drama and what makes a playI don t knowYou may be right about itthough I ve a dim suspicion that in a discussion of that sort there really is nt any finalityIn drama as in all thingsa new form creates its new reasona new reason forges its new formI cannot battle with you about what makes a playAlasI assure you I ve read far too many to knowBut for a momentif you will let meI will join issues with you aboutBernice We ll both agree that it s well writtenI don t think Miss eilaspell has ever written anything but welland often spendidlyand inBernice to my mindso well and spendidly that her play I think takes rank amongst the pitifully few plays that count clone by us AmericansSo far you and I stay together and now I begin to quote youandemotingbegin to leave youYou write You must either work through cause and effect to get drama or you must present dramatically the foibles of a human being There s such an old fashioned bit of naive pessimism here that I can t resist holding you up for a momenteven though we both fall strangled in a net of quibblesI supposeaccording to the point of view that you suggest that all strengths and virtuesall high and mighty heroismsdeeds and thoughts are to your mind but missread weaknessesDo I missread youYour pardon if I doBut the sentence still bothers meI quote again You must either work through cause and effect to get drama May I be permitted to hint that as I see life there s a clean cut distinction in your phrasing that makes me a bit nervousI mention this here because one of the inante virtues of Miss Glasspell s play is to me more than a hint of what I am afraid will be to you the appalling truth that cause and effect are not so are not powerfulThat destroyment is too bitter to gulp down even with the usual heroic smileBut thereI m afield againI haven t the power to stick to the highroad of the one ideathese little shadowy lanes of half truths I find are altogether too beguilingBut for the rest I ll tie myself down to one last issueYou write You make drama out of itand what you mean byit I supposeis all or nothing by having your hero subconsciously aware of what he is doingor you can make him a man who is not on to himself but some one must be on to what is happeningeither a character in the play or you yourself when you write And hereMargaret AndersonI m forced to divide against you twiceI m perfectly certain that Miss Glaspell was both consciously and unconsciously quite aware of what her characters weredoingbut whether he was aware of what she herself was doing is quite a different matter and does nt in any waythat is from the point of view of aesthetic criticsmtouch on the virtues or limitations of the playI don t for an instant believe that any artist is everin the last analysison to himselfwhen he writesWe know so little about the infinite ramifications of the psychology of association that to presume that we are I find it difficult to avoid your phrase alwayson to ourselvesis to presume a separateness which to the human mindpowerful or fragile as you willis inevitably impossibleI m perfectly sure Miss Glaspell knew what her characters meantI m certain that the almost too pregnant incisiv ness of the dialogue was quite within the holding rein of her inspirationbut what I m equally sure of and what gives the play to my mind its rare importance is thatconsciously or unconsciouslyshe has approached throughout nearer than almost any other dramatist I know to those multitudinous vast forces that sense of something beyond our small and smug pat knowingthat she haswith bewildering clnirvoyancytouched the suggestion of those infinite sources of subtle sly reactionsof those tremendousreasons whyof which we hear but the dimmest echoes and know but the shadowsIf most of the plays of today are but arid wastes of wordsbut the oft rewarming of stale and ancient hashesit is because the stuff has all been chewed and chopped beforeYou cannot hope even for the growth of grass where the path is trodden too oftenMiss Glaspell in a playit seems to meof rare distinction and powerhas pointed the way to a new and teeming field for the dramatist who sensitively understands and can touch with sympathetic strength or delicacy the finer values and nuances in the perpetual problem of the human soulAnd that is whymy dear Margaret Andersonthat Miss Glaspell s play is something beyond the reason for an age worn discussion of thewhatsof dramaturgysomething beyond a driftless debate as to whether jxwer is possible to the unpowerfulor whether or not we know more or less than we think we know we knowThanks for letting me hold forthI too havejust touched the fringe of the discussion BerniceI know is worthy of pro founder praise and a more deft defence than mineNeither Drama nor Life Margaret Anderson OF course I agree with neither of these articlesNor do I see that such criticism leads to anything but what an intelligent Frenchman might describe asbla Firstwith the exception of his last paragraphwhich scores a point that I recognize and approve MrBarnes has merely told what Susan Glaspell intendedI am conscious that she intended these thingsI was conscious of it when I saw the playWhat has all this to do with my articleThe glimmering of an idea that I tried to present last month is that she didn t do what she intendedOrsince this statement goes beyond the necessities of the present argumentI will concede that she achieved what she intendedand then I am forced to state that as far as I am concerned she intended something uninterestingbanalsentimentalundramaticsomethingas I tried to say beforewithoutsignificantcontentsomething therefore outside ArtDoes either of these writers answer thisDoes either of them say a word to convince me that I should have been enthralled with what I consciously rejectedNojust as in all the verbal arguments we have with people in America they begin back behind the point established and expect to hold my attentionHow do they think this is going to interest me Of course after this paragraph I have given my opponents their chance to utter the inevitable stock argumentwith the inevitable finalitythat what issignificant contentto me is not to themandso where do we get to At intervalsfor two yearswe have directed a certain cerebration against the vapidity of this argumentI am willing to devote a whole number to itwith brilliant dialogue and convincing illustrations 60 The Little Review WellI shall at least begin with patience and calmI will say that I am used to arguments that follow no sequenceand that I am perfectly willing to go back over the ground againI will say that I don t like the feeling of having written words which can t be construed into meaningbut that the fault must be mineI must have spoken with such vagueness as to conceal entirely what I had to saySo thenfirstboth these critics think that Susan Glaspell has written a good play because she has shown them something of life that interests themIn neither article does the writer prove to me that what interests him is bound to be goodPeople can offer such proofa poetfor instanceis his own best argument that what he believes in is in some way superior to what his philistine opponent belives innot because of any knowledge of poetry that he presents but because of the existence of poetry in himMrBarnes as a psychologist and MrMoeller as a dramatist must offer me this kind of proofIs this clear enoughI mean that if MrBarnesout of his knowledge of psychologycalls Bernice a unified personality he must offer something beyond this statement to change my mind about her being a half grownhalf consciousmilk and waterand therefore ununifiedpersonalityAnd this is what gave rise to all my objections My reasons for undervaluing Bernice laterI must first dispose of MrMoeller s statement that I missed the significance of Bernice as the dominant character in the playNot at allI know that this is Miss Glaspell s ideabut I am willing to overlook itI need not insult Miss Glaspell by harping on the fact that she chose this uninteresting Pollyanna as a person worth writing a play aboutI am perfectly willing to suspect that she merely regarded her as subject matterthat as a dramatist she knows a play can be made out of any subject matterand that if she couldn t make her Pollyanna interesting she could make the reactions of Pollyanna s friends interestingThis was my contribution to Miss Glaspell s ideaBut it is a mistake to make these contributionsYour reward is merely to be accused of knowing less than a deaf and dumb mute about what you are observing Now about BerniceI want to know how anyone can think of this character as a complete and unified personMiss Glaspell has drawn her in a very life like wayso we will discuss her as a human being and not as a characterIs she really indicated as an interesting human beingWhat is said about herThat she is lovingthoughtfulgayat peace with lifeSo are a million uninteresting peopleThat she is free from maliceSo are thousands of perfectly gutless peopleThat she is inspiringThe playwright will have to show thatThat she is unselfishUnselfishness is sometimes a hideous viceland1 therefore interestingbut I m afraid Bernice s brand was merely a mild virtueThat she loves her friends for the good in them and appreciates their foiblesTo do the first is valuableif you re a good judgeto do the second is to be a civilized personif you choose interesting foibles to appreciateThe playwright doesn t indicate againThat she has a gift for being herselfI can prove that you can never talk about a person being himself until you have shown him as a differentiated personOtherwise he merely belongs to a kind of collective selfThat she wants everyone to have a chance to be himselfHave you ever known a civilized person who talked such stuffNoThe permanently adolescent talk itthe initiated know that to give people the freedom to be themselves won t do the trickthat to assume every one wants to be himself is a ridiculous ignoranceand to hope it a delightful luxury which only protoplasmic souls indulge inwith grotesquenopathetic resultsI could go on and on talking about Bernice s lacks of qualityShe hasn t even interesting limitationsShe can t be looked upon as anything but anAmerican girl butwe are in Americaand I must give you right to adore herLet me say only one thing moreWhat does Bernice do by way of proving herinsight her identification withthe whole of life She believes that if her husband thinks she has killed herself for love of him he will be jerked up into some power of self that he has never yet been able to attainEven people without insight sometimes know that this is not the way things happenScorn is usually efficacious in waking a person up to his deficienciesBut the Christ idea doesn t workexcept upon exceptional people who resent it stronglyCraig is certainly not made of this stuffand Bernice might have proved her insight by recognizing this simple factThere are three other general points that must be coveredthough I am afraid I grow boringI shall try to be brief1Philip Moeller feels that my refusal to grant this play the distinction of drama has to do with some petty hard and fast theorizing about dramaturgy2that I have destroyed the whole fabric of optimism by denying power to the powerlessand 3that I am foolish to believe that a creator must work with consciousnessHe didn t sayart is not conscious but spontaneous and for this much I thank himPerhaps I can answer all three in oneI was talking beyond allrulesof what is and what is not dramaThe convention thatemotion expressed in motion makes drama didn t originate with meneither did the convention that a chair is a chair rather than a table have its birth in my capable butafter allcontemporary mindThe only thing I have to do with it all is to discover or recognize or decide whether any emotions have been expressedgranted that I am a touchstone for such matterswhich is my claim and when I see a play in which none of the characters has had his feelings made into emotionswhich means that Susan Glaspell cannot transfuse her own feelings into emotionswhich only leads to the fact that nothing lives until some emotion has been created about itwellthen I can only say that what Susan Glaspell writes does not interest meShe and I live in worlds too far removedShe believeswith MrMoellerthat human nature is interestingI believe that it is never interesting until it has been affected by consciousnessShe believesalso with MrMoellerthat the powerless can develop themselves into powerThat I believe differently doesn t seem to me of much significancethe fact remains that no one has ever become what he is notwhich doesn t mean that a thief may not become a ministeretc etc it only means that self consciousness is possible only to the few who attain itand that their indication of itat the age of birthis the proof they offer of being interesting peopleSelf consciousnessor the unified personalityusually makes an outward sign of its existencethis sign we call ArtWhy should such facts destroy your dreamsThey offer something worth worshippingTHE PROVINCETOWN THEATRE by jh THE Provincetown Theatre is the most amazing of all theatresIt is composed of people of intelligence and of some achievement in other linesand yet it spends season after season giving plays that are not playsI have heard that its slogan isthe play s the thingwhich is evidently interpreted to mean the manuscript and not the playnot even insisting that the manuscript be formed wordsliteratureseeming to disregard utterly that drama has its form as every art has its formIn its original state as an art drama wasand isamong savageswithout wordsMusic was its first elaborationverses the nextand finally speechNo art can be developed by developing its elaborationsThe Provincetown Players put on many performances that show time and thought and much cherishingbut for the most part they are stories illustrated with action and sometimes with very good effects of lights and settingor some member puts on a problem from his own little psychological laboratoryBut plays there are noneI believe there is a controversy on at present over Susan Glas pell sBernice It isn t a playit bears no relation to drama as an artIt is quite patent that neither the emotional nor intellectual conception ofBernicepresented itself to the author in the form of drama but as a psychological problema problem to be worked out in wordsWith this idea in mind I don t see why the Provincetown Theatre didn t start on some basis differentfrom the conventional theatrea theatre without actors and scenerya theatre where the author illustrated his play with blackboard diagrams or read it aloud as a storyIt must be disheartening for an actor to find himself a superfluous thing in a playHowever it is the feeling of all who attend the performances that the actors are better than the playwrightsIn spite of the fact that she has never had a play in which she could show her powerIda Rauh has been able to convince audience after audienceand even some uptown criticsof that power and of her creative abilityShe has a distinction and gives a feeling of first energiesShe is spoken of as having asmouldering fire but it is something more subtle than this it is not related to firebut to things which contain their own heatit is like the heat in spices BONDS OF INTERESTby jhTHE first production of the New York Theatre Guild was one of those things which threaten to destroy one s youth and hope at a single blowI felt like Blanco Posnet at the performanceI wanted to shout every few minutes It s rotten actingit s rotten sceneryit s a rotten play It was a Spanish play calledBonds of Interest and there were times when it was possible to believe that perhaps in the original it was not sorotten it was just possible to think that the author had intended his play as a jeer at humanityat all its typesat all its activitiesat a tattered threadbare materialistic worldAs it was given at the Garrick it had beenjazzed upwith pleasant scenery and costumesand the love scene doped into a high sweet note of hopeNo one expects much acting and interactingof any kindin a newly organized company of professionals and amateursBut it might remove some hindrances and produce less chaos if all the actors were working on the same idea of the pieceHelen Westley somehow knew she was in a farce and played it as a farceAugust in Duncan seemed to feel that it was up to him to give the entire clown act from the circusRollo Peters soulfully struggled to give a sincere effect of Romeo and JulietHere we have a play translated from the Spanishthe words are vulgar in their uncadenced commonplacenessthe humour and philosophy embarrassing in their cheapnessIf this is true in the original why choose it for productionIf it is not true to the original but has been completely translated into American street english with all the mannerrhythmtemperament of the race and period levelled out to meet the appreciation of our untempered audienceswhy do the producers feel any necessity to cling to the costumes of the country and periodWe have all agreed that scenery is not paintinglandscape gardeninginterior decorationThere have even been efforts to make designs in the line and rythymthe moodof a play designs creating an ambient in which the play livesAirPeters creates for this rather sordid farce semi pictorial scenery which would do for a pastoralI am interested in experimentsI carry life long wounds from having gone over the top with little theatres in several sectorsI ask youwhere is the experiment in this guildTo put over a bad play badly actedThat is done every day on BroadwayIs it an experiment in combining the dignified and accomplished settings of the French Theatre with abortive p ctorial effortsThere is no experiment in a thing that lies back behind the achievement of many of the little theatresIt is romantic and sentimental because it is merely a messing around in the theatre that belongs to a past condition of lifea violation of tradition and of mediums of expression instead of an attack on tradition and an effort to extend the mediumI am not asking for a new theatrenor a modernnor a present theatreI am asking why is there no experiment to reestablish the theatre in some relation to artWhy is there no experiment to rediscover the primary form for the dramamovements to the rhythm of emotionsWhy is there no effort to purge acting of sententious and restricted gesturesof its unemotional and unintel lectuai elaboration and dispersings of intensitiesrepetitious to flaccidity The above note was written with a hope that it could be understood by the Chicago newspaper criticsIf simple phrases likeeternal essencesdisturb the entire underbrushwe willjazzone article each monthThe little line on our magazine which readsmaking no compromiserefers only to those publics which have heard of civilizationWe ll do what we can for the rest Two First Books by Babette Deutsch To wander anions the delicate subtleties of Bodenheim and to turn thence to the harsh verities of Lola Ridge throws the work of these two poets into bold reliefTheir poems are like the games created by foster children who have one common parentBoth are lessoned in the rough discipline of those whoeat dust in their throats and die empty heartedFor a little handful of pay on a few Saturday nights They know the kindling life of the streetsand the rusty death of the factoriesThey approach experience with the abandon of their lucidityBut to read Bodenheim is to listen to chimes and fhitings in a gallery that throws strange echoes from its secret cornersTo read Lola Ridge is to shudder with the throb of unrelenting engines and the hammer on the pavement of numberless nervous feetBodenheim comes to his moods like a sophisticated loverHe caresses them with novel and exquisite phraseshe bejewels them with little raptureshis adorationlike his griefis as deliberate as it is acuteOne feelseven in such poems asSoldiersorFactory Girl that art is his escape from life even while it is his representation of lifeAs though one should kill an emotion by analysissave that when he has concluded his examinationhis instruments are stained with the colors of his subjectPerhaps that is why certain words recur continually through his poemsand though they are so usual as to have got a bad namehe turns them to startling and refreshing usesFlowers and hearts and pallor make a bouquet that his fine percipience just saves from the rococcoIndeed it is when he points a moral and adorns a tale that he failsthough even here failure must be taken rather as an incomplete achievementThat is why such poems asThe InterneandTo An Enemyare so much weaker than poems whose intention may be less significantsuch as many of the nameless lyrics ofMinna It is in his over tonesto use the only adequate if much abused wordthat Bodenheim gets his effectThe landscape suggested beyond the horizonthe person remembered behind the closed doorthe silence waiting under the busy voicesthese are his gifts and his distinctionHis rhythms have the quality of his symbolismApproaching the familiar iambic pentameterthey escape it with just sufficient resemblance to tease and please the lulled senseThey are lingeringquiet and slowwithal provocativeMore than most poets writing vers libre with any skillBodenheim achieves the music of rhyme without ever using so easy a contrivanceOne hesitates to say whether this is the effect of imagery which uses all the gestures of the danceor whether it lies in his skill with verbal nuancessuch as this A wind sprawls over an orchard Frightening its silent litany to sound To come from these quaint alleys into the loud jostle ofThe Ghettois to be aware of the power of the latter at the cost of its intensityThat may be nothing more than the ultimate difference between the symbolist and the realistBut symbolism divorced from reality is purely vapidand a realism too stark is like the barren triumph of the intellect which MBergson so eloquently deprecatesNot that Lola Ridge is either cold or insensitiveBut her vision is no less limited than Bodenheim sif engaged with another sceneand her violence is sometimes strident rather than sternIt is curious that one should feel her the more immature of the twomore sincere in her emotions and less earnestor perhaps only less concentrated in her artThere are flashes of insight as clear as hisbut she cannot sustain her attackShe works on a larger canvasbut her colors are all dull crimsonsorange and sullen blackBoden Maxwell Bodenheim deim s metaphors may come hurtling like seven astounding flashlights crossingbraidedand swung through the night skyLola Ridge throws the glow of sudden lampssharp and electricbut single and scatteredShe is capable of such a perfection as showing the Friday night candles Coupling other lightsLinking the tenements Like an endless prayer Or of that final arresting picturewherein Hester street Like a forlorn woman over born By many babies at her teatsTurns on her trampled bed to meet the day And she is also capable of such an anomalous confusion of New York s east side with the conventions of New England as to speak of an old Jew asone who holds The wisdom of the Talmud stored away In his mind s lavendar Nearly all her poems are too longBodenheim may pour a bright liquor into too narrow a jarthat will overflow in sweet drops on its lipLola Ridge brews a darker potionaniron wine but it lies in deep flagonsheavy to liftIt is in the brief glimpsethe dark vivid drama of a phrasethat she challenges ugliness and poverty and futile deathShe should be able to make hokkus that would sting and rend as her semi epical efforts do in sudden incisive momentsAn angry mob is terriblebut its anger is a thing diffused and obscure contrasted with the deep intensity of an individualBoth of these poets are more penetrating when one reads single poems than when one accepts an entire bookBodenheim s subtlety is apt to become a labyrinth of crowding imagesLola Ridge s vigorous apprehension of life is apt to descend to the monotonous savagery of a drumEach retainshowevera rare and exciting savorthe intriguing strength of those content to be solitarythe beauty of those in whom the passions of the body are no more imperative than the passions of the mind Minna Myself by Maxwell

still unprohibited incense Certain hasty writers have attempted to obfuscate my criticisms of the conditions of contemporary letters by chauvinistic and sectional criesI have seldom asked for fair playand I am no longer in that naive state wherein one expects itI onlythereforesuggest that the next writer who thinks he answers some criticism of mine by talking about myflaying of America mycontempt of America etc adinf will do me at least the courtesy to rememberor learnor considerthat I have been much more drastic in my condemnation of English publicational destestabilia and despicienda than ever I have been in my remarks about America s contemporary or past productionPossibly the English have thicker hidespossiblysince I live herethe stuff is trust more frequently under my noseAt any rate I have offendedI thinkquite as many English matoids as I have American rusticiAnd I have been if anything still more severe in my handling of contemporary French writersthough I have written much less about themand feel that they areor should bebetter able to take care of themselves and heal their own patent diseasesIshonestlythe American public content with this sort of thingI quote from a contemporaryMost modern French poetry is mannered and bloodlessI thinkbut I gather that Professor Pound does not Now whenO reasonable and decent peruserhave I ever burst into praise of most modern poetry of any nation I have at my wildest but put forth the work of Rimbaud and of Tristan Corbiere and objected to the free Rocky Mountain elanthesplendid largenessof inanity

thank God a few poets rise out of the welterAlso a small number of brilliant or passionate people have learned something about writingtheir work is subjectable to dispassionate analysis and their qualities may be discernedmay even be contrasted with their defects or with opposite virtues in othersAll I have ever asked of American writers is that they should not in utter and abject intellectual

WCBryant to Frangois Villonif they prefer Emily Dickenson to Laforguewe do not wish to interfere with their domestic enjoymentsBut the answer to a critical contention is not by shifting the argument

PROLOGUE ContinuedWilliam Carlos WilliamsPrologue to a book of Improvisations now being published by the Four Seas Company Iwish that I might here set down myVortexafter the fashion I live herethereor elsewhere or succeed in thisthator the other so long as I can keep my mind free from the trammels of literaturebearing down every attack of its retiarii with my mirmillonesBut the time is pastI thought at first to join to each Improvisation a more or less opaque commentaryInstead I have placed some of them in the preface wherewithout losing their original intentionsee reference numerals at the beginning of each they relieve the later text and also add their weight to my present fragmentary argument I have discovered that the thrill of first love passesIt even becomes the backbone of a sordid sort of religion if not assisted in passingI knew a man who kept a candle burning before a girl s portrait day and night for a year then jilted herpawned her off on a friendI have been reasonbly frank about my erotics with my wifeI have never or seldom saidmy dear I love youwhen I would rather saymy dear I wish you were in Terra del FuegoI have discovered by scrupulous attention to this detail and by certain allied experiments that we can continue from time to time to elaborate relationships quite equal in qualityif not greatly superiorto that surrounding our weddingIn fact the best we have enjoyed of love together has come after the most thorough destruction or harvesting of that which has gone beforePeriods of barreness have intervenedperiods comparable to the prison music inFidelioor to any of Beethoven s pianissimo transition passagesIt is at these times our formal relations have teetered on the edge of a debacle to be followedas our imaginations have permittedby a new growth of passionate attachment dissimiliar in every member to that which has gone beforeIt is in the continual and violent refreshing of the idea that love and good writing have their security The Impovisationswith noteswill appear in the next numberAlfred Kreymbourg is primarily a musicianat best an innovator of musical phraseWe have no dishes to eat our meals fromWe have no dishes to eat our meals from because we have no dishes to eat our meals from We need no dishes to eat our meals fromwe have fingers to eat our meals fromKreymbourg s idea of poetry is a transforming music that has much to do with tawdry thingsIt has always amused and instructed me to observe what a bone Kreymborg is in the crop of MrPoundEzra cannot see KreymborgKseems to have a laudable desire to do something but he cannot writehas been the burden of more than one London letter complainig of my friendship for AlfredKreymborg believes in the effect of music upon words to transform themThere is a good story of Pound the elder s visit to New York in the summer of 1917A few of those acquainted in one way or another with Ezra went to pay homage to his parent at the Holley House on Washington Square Why don t you people write like my son MrPound is reported to have saidAlfred has little help from the eyes I once attended a lifelass to improve my sense of visual valuesOne day was enoughI couldn t see anythingWith this handicapwithout a richness of phrase to help himnofrost upon the grassblade the sheer imparting of the ocular values in natureone cannot expect to write like your sonsirFew people know how to read KreymborgThere is no modern poet who suffers more from a bastard sentimental appreciationIt is hard to get his things from the pageI have heard him say he has often thought in despair of marking his verse into measures as music is markedOh well The man has a bare ironythe gift of rhythm and OthersI smile to think of Alfred stealing the stamps from the envelopes sent for return of MSSto the Others officeThe best thing thcould happen for the good of poetry in the United States today would be for someone to give Alfred Kreymborg a hundred thousand dollarsIn his mind there is the determination for freedom brought into relief by a crabbedness of temper that makes him peculiarly able to value what is being done hereWhether he is bull enough for the work I am not certainbut that he can find his way I knowA somewhat petulant English college friend of mybrother sonce remarked that Britons make the best policeman the world has ever seenI agree with himIt is silly to go into a puckersnatch because some brass button minded nincompoop in Kensington flies off the handle and speaks openly about our United States prize poemsThis MrJepsonAnyone who has heard MrJread Homer and

it have not thatno loveliness or heroic proportion or grand manner will save itIt will not be saved above all by an attenuated intellectualityOur prize poems have been mostly junk though there is certain candid indecency of form about Lindsey s work that is at tractiveBut these poems are especially to be damned not because of superficial bad workmanship but as MrJagain correctly adjudgesbecause they are rehashrepetition just as Eliot s more exquisite work is rehashrepetition in another way of VerlaineBeau delaireMaeterlinckconscious or unconsciousjust as there are Pound s

MrJthere is theLove Song of JAlfred Prufrock It is convenient to have fixed standards of comparisonall antiquityAnd there is always some everlasting Polonius of Kensington forever to rate highly his

was one day irately damning those who run to London when Stevens caught me up with his mild But where in the world will you have them run to Nothing that I should write touching poetry would be completed without Maxwell Bodenheim in iteven had he not said that the Improvisations wereprefect the best things I had ever c onefor that I place himJanusfirst and lastBodenheim pretends to hate most peopleincluding Pound and Kreymborgbut that he really goes to this trouble I cannot imagineHe seems rather to me to have the virtue of self absorption so fully developed that hate is made impossibleDue to this also he is an unbelievable physical stoicI know of no one who lives so completely in his pretences as Bogie doesHaving formulated his worldneither toothache nor the misery to which his indolence reduces him can make head against the force of his imaginationBecause of this he remains for me a heroic figurewhich after all is quite apart from the stuff he writes and which only concerns himHe is an Isaih of the butterfliesBogie was the young and fairly well acclaimed genius when he came to New York four years agoHe pretended to have fallen in Chicago and to have sprained his shoulderThe joint was done up in a proper Sayre s dressing and there really looked to be a bona fide injuryOf course he couldn t find any work to do with one hand so we all chipped inIt lasted a monthDuring that time Bogie spent a week at my house at no small inconvenience to Florence who had two babies on her hands just thenWhen he left I expressed my pleasure at having had his company Yes he replied I think you have profited by my visit The statement impressed me by its simple accuracy as well as by the evidence it bore of that fulness of the imagination which had held the man in its tide while we had been togetherCharlie Demuth once told me that he did not like the taste of iliquorfor which he was thankfulbut that he found the effect it had on his mind to be delightfulOf course Li Po is reported to have written his best verse supported in the arms of the Emperor s attendants and with a dancing girl to hold his tabletHe was also a great poetWine is merely the latchstringThe virtue of it all is in an opening of the doorsthough some rooms of course will be emptya break with banalitythe continual hardening which habit enforcesThere is nothing left in me
