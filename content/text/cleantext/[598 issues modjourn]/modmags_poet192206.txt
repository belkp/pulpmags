wind is only the beating of fairy wings And fairy fingers doffing your hat to invisible majesties  He sat on the bench motionless The dust sifted upon him Leaves caught upon his clothing Vagrant sheets of paper wrapped about his feet  Chance is decent and does not leave the silent things  exposed She covers the stone with moss and spreads A coverlet of mold upon the unmoving things   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Suppose I stayed here a year Would the elves come and cover me with leaf drift and  dust Carefully shaken over me Would they sow seeds under my feet Would the moss grow from the clay on the soles of my  shoe Would I be wound in spider webs  II  Another one sat down beside him And cut his world in two He moved back as if to drag back the severed half But the other one held it tenaciously His very shadow was a seal of possession ineffaceable For a moment they sat still taut Like two who tug at a rope  Pleasant day  Pleasant day  And so they fused their world with sticky speech  I was wondering how it would be To be a year in one place For the rain to soften you and the wind to mold you And the dust to fill in your cracks  You would be a tree then   Isidor Schneider  Your toes would drip into roots Your arms would be long brown branches Holding leaves like cups to fill with sunlight and dew  I f I were silent The invisible realms would open about me The unseen people would build a road between my feet They would build a city in the shadow of my knees Like cities built below mountains I might be their sphinx satiate with questions  There is no invisible world Except the worlds you do not see These can be reached by travel Your stillness will not be inviolate All things using life will apportion you With shrewd husbandry The birds will inherit your head and your shoulders Hungry things will not spare you Insects and beasts will dispute your flesh And bound your body for dwelling places  There is no need of travel Stillness will invite these other worlds That are delayed by distance The wind will plant about my feet Their final flowers The rivers will wash their soil under my roots The travel urge will throw   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Their curious sampled people out to me The other worlds I mean are mixed with this They course within our life Like floods within the ocean  I do not think these things They walk like strangers out beyond my mind Only of this world which I see suddenly Like clouds disclosed by lightnings Love came to me suddenly Hatred armed my hands once And I knew remorse Hunger and a red wound Taught me the thin texture of life  They say the sky is distance only And the color of distance is blue And that is why violets who have the distance of frag Are blue Since there are larger worlds around us There must be smaller other worlds within us If one could find them  We who are within the waiting rooms of existence Should not peer into the deeper halls Nor tempt the attendants with our lauding curiosity  Can you not watch how the ceilings and the walls Mark the backs of other rooms Can you not let your mind tentatively therein   Isidor Schneider  No I would still suspect it  Well  Well I ll be going good day  Good day  And one man walked away brushing from him crawling  words While the other sat still Wiping from his world The stains of conversation  THE MIST  Is death a mist  In which life becomes invisible  Yesterday The world ended in mist It lay shrunken by immobility Into a gray coffin The steeple rose Prodded and pricked the mist Like a question Investigating doubt Its dim spire   Found the horizon new arranged In stories The world became strange Ungrateful Of the jagged lights That seamed its veils  To me walking The long road unravelled A guiding string And my eyes Carried before and behind Its constant small visibility  I faced the mist made microcosm Where pebbles are boulders Puddles lakes Sidewalk cracks long chasms The curb a precipice Where towers flew Roofs floated like rafts And smoke wreaths Were like dark veins Under a skin  Is death a mist In which life becomes invisible  Isidor Schneider   A MOOD  I am sad for the beauty that is dead  For the sunset that I saw tonight As I walked on a hill For the tangle of clouds in the light Where the rim of the sun was showing still  For the breath of a lily slim and pale That I brought from the forest yesterday For the song of a lark on an old fence rail For a ground wren s nest in the last year s hay  For three slim dogwoods on a mountain side Like ghost trees whitely nodding at the grass For a field of buttercups upon a river bank For a jaybird jeering shrilly as we pass  For a wild rose by an alder tree For a ginger bloom more fragrant than the rose For a swallow sailing by with sapphire wings Where a waterlily in the shallows grows  For all the things that are passing and are fair For the shortness of the hour that gave them birth For the paucity of human hearts that care For all the things that are only of the earth  I am sad for the beauty that is dead  Joseph Andrew Galahad   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NIGHT ABOVE THE TREE LINE  You berries that are full of the dark dusks Of mountains and the moisture of chill dews Swell on your stems and break your ripened husks For lips which it would wither you to lose If there are lips to what is wandering here Feeling you underfoot in the rocky night Moving about like wind blowing you clear Of mists hanging your leaves with drops of light  Listen There is a sound of water falling Down the dark shafted night into the trees Wild birds that should be quiet now are calling How shall I sleep tonight troubled with these The cool wind through the moon s invisible strings Blows like a striking of clear silver bars The great black peak shudders and leaps and swings And I am blinded by the fall of stars  I cannot rest I cannot quiet my limbs A sense of climbing keeps my body burning And the white flame sweeps over me and dims All that inclines within me toward returning Did I see only earth once long ago And only flesh in faces turned to me Sleep Rest With my senses shaken so And the world s valleys lost so dizzily   Raymond Holden  Why have I come so near the fearful stars  When what is in me is so much a want Of utter dark too thick for any wars Of flesh and spirit dazzlingly to haunt I do not know I do not want to know Only to make a fire of weariness And fling myself upon it and burn and go Thinly like smoke to wind walled quietness  Raymond Holden  THESE FIELDS AT EVENING  These wear their evening light as women wear Their pale proud beauty for some lover s sake Too quiet hearted evermore to care For moving worlds and musics that they make And they are hushed as lonely women are So lost in dreams they have no thought to mark How the wide heavens blossom star by star And the slow dusk is deepening to the dark  The moon comes like a lover from the hill Leaning across the twilight and the trees And finds them grave and beautiful and still And wearing always on such nights as these A glimmer less than any ghost of light As women wear their beauty through the night  David Morton   MAXIXE  Los enanitos Se enojaren Old Mexican Song  The Mexican dwarfs can dance for miles Stamping their feet and scattering smiles Till the loud hills laugh and laugh again At the dancing dwarfs in the golden plain Till the bamboos sing as the dwarfs dance by Kicking their feet at a jagged sky That torn by leaves and gashed by hills Rocks to the rhythm the hot sun shrills The bubble sun sketches shadows that pass To noiseless jumping jacks of glass So long and thin so silent and opaque That the lions shake their orange manes and quake And a shadow that leaps over Popocatepetl Terrifies the tigers as they settle Cat like limbs cut with golden bars Under bowers of flowers that shimmer like stars Buzzing of insects flutters above Shaking the rich trees treasure trove Till the fruit rushes down like a comet whose tail Thrashes the night with its golden flail The fruit hisses down with a plomp from its tree Like the singing of a rainbow as it dips into the sea Loud red trumpets of great blossoms blare   Osbert Sitwell  Triumphantly like heralds who blow a fanfare Till the humming bird bearing heaven on its wing Flies from the terrible blossoming And the humble honey bee is frightened by the fine Honey that is heavy like money and purple like wine While birds that flaunt their pinions like pennons Shriek from their trees of oranges and lemons And the scent rises up in a cloud to make The hairy swinging monkeys feel so weak That they each throw down a bitten cocoanut or mango Up flames a flamingo over the fandango Glowing like a fire and gleaming like a ruby From Guadalajara to Guadalupe It flies in flying drops a feather And the snatching dwarfs stop dancing and fight together  Osbert Sitwell  FRIENDSHIP  No foe could strike this blow Could draw this blood this tear By the deep wound I know A friend was here  Daniel Henderson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COCKLE SHELLS  THE SHIP  The sky is great and the land is great and the ocean is great said he And a bird is a lovely thing in the air and a supple fish in the sea And a horse is a beautiful thing to watch running so gay and free  But a ship that is built of land grown oak with her sails in the wind said he And who goes and comes in the very thick of the calm and storm of the sea Is light as a bird and swift as a fish and like a horse runs free  THE cows  I have seen cows that lay in the summer meadows Hearing the sound of breezes amidst the grass While every hair in the sunlight glittered with rainbows  Oh but they were bland and placid and smooth and  beautiful Their mates were great bulls with curl matted horns And the bellow of lions Their offspring were playful and gay   Elizabeth Coatsworth  With innocent staring eyes Laborers toiled in the fields to find them food for the winter And built them against the wind dark temples scented  with hay While women eased them of milk That swelled their udders at twilight I have seen cows that lay in the meadows like gods Breathing forth peace that smelled of dampness and  clover  STREAM  Like a troubadour riding to battle Flinging his sword in the air And catching it As he sings The stream comes in white armor down the hillside  BROADWAY  That man has the head of a goat and the paunch of Silenus As he walks down the sidewalk alone conventionally going to dine His little bright eyes are glancing his little hard feet are prancing As though all the crowd about him were maenads and fawns in a line   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The horns of the motors for him are puffed by the cheeks of centaurs The buildings and shops are cliffs draped and festooned with the vine The little cane that he swings he has used on the ribs of his donkey When the ground was rocking with laughter and the trees were reeling with wine  AT VERSAILLES  I have watched the hours pass along the walks of Versailles Among the drifting autumn leaves Madame Four O Clock a tumble of silken skirts and smiles On a donkey her lover lured forward with brown southern  pears Madame Five O Clock pouting among the petunias Flower face flower hands flower breasts barely sheathed  in her bodice Madame Six O Clock languishing by a balustrade Her thin yellow hand on the head of a black page And Madame Seven a white shadow among the tree  trunks As still and as arch as the statues upon their pedestals  Elizabeth Coatsworth   PORTRAIT OF A HOUSE  Far from a town I know a house that s a girl s dream come true And there is one room done in blue In queer still blues with shades drawn down  In a room near Are candles thick as a man s arm Of yellow wax and then a warm Great golden bowl of burning bloom And past there is a little room For tea and being glad and proud One is alive There is a crowd Of tall flowers shaken as with fear Outside a door And walking by Three great windows filled with sky  We came to a Chinese room Where a Buddha sits in gloom He is as still as witchery But in his eyes weird things I see Like the waiting to be wild In the eyes of a young child  Past this room are wonders still Altar vestures from Brazil Blue and silver ones and red She loves old rich things She said Cream or lemon in your tea   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In a strange laughing voice She has Dusk eyes I think or maybe blue And a heart for telling secrets to  A bear skin out of Russia yawns On her wide hall There have been dawns A many on her waiting lawns  The rocky cliffside glacier scarred And mountain trails are in her yard The widest river of the west Goes past her door There is a jest In all she does and a greatness too And little gardens hidden where Her guests find them unaware  Gravely in the court beyond Her gardeners have made a pond Where waterlilies were and where They are gone now except two rare And perfect ones like trembling young Shy things and deep and red among The lily roots the goldfish go In a discontented row Breaking and wheeling A white wall Bears bowls of trailing vines There fall Out of the air great seagulls High Cliffs and rough crags break up the sky Across the river and beyond   Mary Carolyn Davies  The level lawn the level pond  The mountain rises menacing And a great waterfall comes down  Like a sullen tiger s spring  I have watched her calm eyes cling  To the waterfall while slow And sweet she spoke in her still way Of books and men that we two know  Prisoner in her house she dwells As do we all Our rooms are cells Loveliness is only bars To shut out faces from the stars  THE LAST OF THE COWBOYS  They have gone down like the sunset who like the sun Were mighty and high and scornful their hour is done Slowly into the night they ride each one  They have gone down like the sunset sharp on the hill A moment against the sky they stood until The dark came down and they met it stoic and still  Mary Carolyn Davies   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  YOUR WORDS  God gave you words so you must give them to me Let me lie here on the ground Breaking brittle pine needles with my fingers You have no right to keep a gift God gave you words so you must give them to me  Your words are perfect things They are birds with full smooth breasts That fly in wide clean skies And sleep in warm brown nests  Your words are little globes Of glass or ruby flake They tinkle in the air And whisper as they break  Your words are little ships  With silver shining sails That sing against the winds Like purple nightingales  Your words are colored fruits In crystal jars and tall You break them with your lips I catch them as they fall  So give me your words Let them slip Cool fingers through my hair   Athena McFadden  There is no world but me no heaven but you Somewhere outside of these there may be birds And fruit and ships and little crystal globes  For me there are only your words Athena McFadden  OWL BLASTED  Farmer Hunt doubted whether there really were any tongs which he seemed to hold in his hand Ah these solid houses real estates have wings like so many nimble mosquitoes and do exceedingly hop and avoid me Emerson s Journals  Y u can trap no sweet From such nimble things They have goblin feet They have goblin wings  Chase them everywhere Everywhere they flee Emptier than air Are the world and we  Who has heard the madmen Shall remember long All their goblin music And their goblin song  John McClure    FANTASY  High in the cloudy skies Along the barren hills Where short brown grass grows sparingly and spots of  orange earth shine forth Where trees of sombre brown uprise Fantastic horses roam  Cropping the scanty grass Their full white tails blown outward by the wind They move about majestically with slow and tranquil step  Their necks are strangely thin and beautiful Their fiery eyes fixed steadily on the ground Seem to be contemplating inward wonders With their unshod hoofs they leave no mark on the  bare hard earth  Slowly they move With their heads bent downward Munching the short spare grass While the passing clouds grey with incipient storm Hang low over the hills  They know no day nor night Those pale fantastic horses For daylight on the hills is but a cloud grey shadow And night is faintly luminous with livid mist   Helen C Russmarin  Slowly they roam With their unsleeping eyes fixed inward Treading with easy step the inaccessible heights Moving in tranquil peace Along the cloudy hills  Helen C Russmann  TWO POEMS  MOONLIGHT  It has covered the earth as this sheet my knee Where my body lies like a reed in snow It has altered my room to a satin tomb It has made of my soul a silver flute A silver flute in a white case mute A silver flute filled with prisoned song Long shrill song for your lips to free  CONVENT  As into a blue lake The little drops of days Fall quietly The lake fills but does not stir  Kathryn White Ryan

one of them of the welter of chaos and confusion in which that so called science finds itself foundering today Since poets and scholiasts are so at loggerheads about the fundamental technique of the verse art practiced by the one group and analyzed by the other it may be well to remind ourselves of the basic origins of rhythm and of the history not of poetry itself but of the system of laws formulated and developed by grammarians from the study of poetry  Rhythm is of course a universal principle the very pulse beat of life and of all the arts From the amoeba to man from the atom to the star rhythm or power moving regularly in time beats is a recognizable law which all creation must obey The more closely modern science studies the universe through microscope telescope or the naked eye and brain of man the more astonishing and magnificent becomes this infinite harmony an intricate weaving of small patterns within great ones a march of ordered melody outreaching human eyes and ears outracing even that only reality the human imagination The arts are an effort to join in to weave little imitation patterns sound little imita   Prosody  tion tunes Even the static arts must respond with balanced form and color in painting sculpture architecture else their manifestations are temporary and incongruous part of the perishable scum and waste  Music and poetry seem to have been among the earliest and most direct human manifestations of the universal rhythmic impulse At first they were united lyric rapture instinctively fitted words to melody as it does still in certain forms of spontaneous folk song like keening over the dead or other primitive rhapsodies of prayer and praise But as life became more complex the two arts separated developed each its own imaginative and technical expression of the rhythmic instinct Literature began in the creation of poems too beautiful to be left to chance memories and tongues and therefore committed to writing After the passing centuries had heaped up an accumulation of these masterpieces the analysts took hold of them and out of the practice of dead poets grammarians began to make rules for poets yet to come  Thus prosody was born And thus gradually it developed into a rigid science of verse structure a science about as scientific from the modern point of view as the astronomy or chemistry of the classic and mediaeval periods For a brief review of its history one need go no further than Edmund Gosse s article on Verse in the Britannica It was Aristoxenus of Tarentum a grammarian contemporary with Alexander the Great and therefore much later than the golden age of Greek poetry   who first laid down definite laws for prosody as a department of musical art From his time  The theories of verse tended to release themselves from the theories of music Rules often of a highly arbitrary nature were drawn up by grammarians who founded their laws on a scholiastic study of the ancient poets  One Hephaestion wrote a manual of Greek metres in the second century A D which became an authority in both the Byzantine and the Alexandrian schools and printed at last in 1526 carried on his influence into modern languages Of the elaborate system of classic verse structure set forth by these and other analysts Mr Gosse reminds us  It must not be forgotten that the prosodical terminology of the Greeks which is often treated by non poetical writers as something scientific and even sacrosanct dates from a time when ancient literature had lost all its freshness and impulse and was exclusively the study of analysts and grammarians  However the classic nomenclature the dactyls anapaests spondees iambs etc of Greek and Latin languages whose syllabic quantities were fairly rigid was carried over into modern tongues of much more changeable quantities and emphatic stresses Naturally it has proved a misfit especially in English it is inaccurate and misleading a mediaeval remainder strangely anachronistic in this age of scientific research It has been a hampering influence and would have been perhaps a destructive one if the poets most of them had not preserved either an invincible ignorance or a cold hearted indifference against   Prosody  all the wiles of prosodic theory I know two or three of high distinction who don t know an iamb from a cellar door and couldn t scan their poems according to formula to save their necks from the Lord High Executioner  But this virginal innocence however desirable in the face of a false prosody might learn much to its advantage from a prosody as accurate and scientifically complete as the system of musical notation which has so enormously stimulated musical production As I said in the Freeman  In any inquiry into poetic rhythms one is seriously handicapped by the inexactness of the old terms Prosody regarded as the science of verse notation is today about as scientific as pre Galilean astronomy Its inherited ancient terms iambic trochaic anapaestic dactylic etc deserve no better fate than the scrap heap after which a modern science of prosody might be built upon sound foundations Indeed a beginning has been made There is quite a bibliography of scientific articles by philologists chiefly German on the subject of speech rhythms and verse rhythms and Dr William Morrison Patterson formerly of Columbia University has made a most valuable contribution in his volume The Rhythm of Prose and in the phonographic researches which led up to it In reviewing this book in April 1918 I said  I am quite out of sympathy with those sensitive poetic souls who resent this intrusion of science The truth can do no harm and in this case it must do incalculable good in the enrichment of our sense of rhythmic values The poet of the future discarding the wilful empiricism of the past and proceeding upon exact knowledge will greatly develop and enrich our language rhythms just as music rhythms are being developed and enriched by composers fully educated in their art who add knowledge and training to that primal impulse of heart and mind which we call genius The poet hitherto has worked in the dark or at least in a shadow land illumined only by his own intuition Henceforth science will lend her lamp she will hand him the laws of rhythm just as she hands to the painter the laws of light and color or to the architect the laws of proportion and stress   Of course modern investigators including Mr Bridges recognize that even common human speech falls necessarily into what Sievers calls Sfrechtakte or speech bars rhythm being a universal law which prose must obey as well as poetry So Mr Bridges is in accord with the scientists in declaring that in English accentual measures the natural speech groupings must be supreme  Prof Patterson s researches were interrupted a few years ago unfortunately by his resignation from the faculty of Columbia University At present he is living in old Charleston where according to a recent letter he hopes soon to resume his study of this subject The work of a progressive scientific mind in this much befogged specialty cannot fail to be illuminating H M  REVIEWS  CHARLOTTE ME W  Saturday Market by Charlotte Mew Macmillan Co  A slim book of verse laden with so much observation knowledge passion sentiment that it is like an apple tree burdened by the excess of its own beauty Almost each poem has the material in it for innumerable poems and almost each poem is weighed down with words Yet though Miss Mew lacks simplicity she never lacks interest I think in fact that this book would appeal to a larger audience than any book of verse published in the past two years with the possible exception of Edna St Vincent Millay s Second April because the poems tell stories   Charlotte Mew  and tell them with genuine dramatic feeling For instance The Farmer s Bride  Three summers since I chose a maid  Too young maybe but more s to do  At harvest time than bide and woo  When us was wed she turned afraid  Of love and me and all things human  Like the shut of a winter s day  Her smile went out and twasn t a woman  More like a little frightened fay  One night in the fall she runned away  Out mong the sheep her be they said  Should properly have been abed  But sure enough she wasn t there  Lying awake with her wide brown stare  So over seven acre field and up along across the down  W e chased her flying like a hare  Before our lanterns To Church town  All in a shiver and a scare  W e caught her fetched her home at last  And turned the key upon her fast  She does the work about the house  As well as most but like a mouse  Happy enough to chat and play  With birds and rabbits and such as they  So long as men folk keep away  Not here not here her eyes beseech  When one of us comes within reach  The women say that beasts in stall  Look round like children at her call  I ve hardly heard her speak at all  Shy as a leveret swift as he Straight and slight as a young larch tree   Sweet as the first wild violets she To her wild self But what to me  The short days shorten and the oaks are brown  The blue smoke rises to the low grey sky  One leaf in the still air falls slowly down  A magpie s spotted feathers lie  On the black earth spread white with rime  The berries redden up to Christmas time  What s Christmas time without there be  Some other in the house than we  She sleeps up in the attic there Alone poor maid Tis but a stair Betwixt us O my God the down The soft young down of her the brown The brown of her her eyes her hair her hair  The above I think shows Miss Mew at her best She has taken one idea and has handled it with restraint In the longer poems such as Madeleine in Church and The Quiiet House she is in danger of becoming melodramatic and verbose And frequently she loses all sense of word sound as in the cacophanous ending of this stanza  Red is the strangest pain to bear In spring the leaves on the budding trees In summer the roses are worse than these More terrible than they are sweet A rose can stab you across the street Deeper than any knife And the crimson haunts you everywhere Thin shafts of sunlight like the ghosts of reddened swords have  struck our stair As if coming down you had split your life  The final lines are as unpleasant to the ear as a finger   Charlotte Mew  nail drawn across a blackboard particularly as they follow lines of accurate beauty  Almost all of the poems are objective which in itself is refreshing in this age when so many poets emphasize the diminutive flutterings of their colossal ego And the fact that Miss Mew successfully subordinates her own personality to that of the characters in her poems proves her a mature artist There is nothing slap dash about her nothing young her sophistication has mellowed to wisdom And when she does not try to impart too much of her knowledge we are exalted by it  Tide be runnin the great world over T was only last June month I mind than we Was thinkin the toss and the call in the breast of the lover So everlastin as the sea Here s the same little fishes that sputter and swim Wi the moon s old glim on the grey wet sand An him no more to me nor me to him Than the wind goin over my hand  Marion Strobel  A SPIRIT OF QUEST  Explorations by Robert McAlmon Egoist Press London  If poetry is an easily understood self fulfilling bead string of so called beautiful images that he who runs may read if it implies not a continual rebellion to standardized beauty if it should be simple and naive then this bitter burning caustic stuff the broken rhythm of it the labyrinthine sophistication of it have nothing to do with   Pegasus The old venerable horse would lose his head in it and get his hoofs scorched McAlmon seeks it is hard to say just what he seeks there is a spirit of quest in this book We might call it the struggle of the poet versus his own sophistication For that he is a poet some lines tell even to the skeptical  Between sunrise and sunrise any life is left pendulating What if a few stars are stitched To the hem of the garment one cannot throw off The sky one cannot look far into  and  I have been a vermilion geyser breaking into petals of hot mist that freeze to crack clinking on the too thin ringing glass of silence  The very spirit of quest and struggle is in this book and it is that which makes McAlmon say  Wind wear yourself to stillness to death do not listen to the careful ones Do not subside You inevitably shall be made to but never degrade yourself with ingratiation  These are essentials to that spirit which prompted Prometheus theft the poetic spirit  The tedium and the nausea of sophistication with the struggle thereof are emphasized in this slim book Yet McAlmon is sometimes simple and direct Witness his book of short stories and momentary essays thus he calls them A Hasty Bunch stories which are plotless unfinished and sketchy but always honest always interesting and often very free with a dark sullen trend of fatalism running through them What is best in Explora   A Spirit of Quest  tions The Via Dolorosa of Art a beautiful title is a rather simple song of the mood that precedes artistic conception indeed it is rather adolescent taking the word not to mean derogation but a rather charming insecure ness and transparency The same could be said of Mood Decisions and Prose Sketches which are like the face of the artist of Via Dolorosa sullen with youth often boisterous and sometimes bombastic In striking contrast these are with some other poems which sound like did you ever hear a vaudeville actor string a lot of high sounding nonsense words In the Via Dolorosa there is perhaps too much nomenclature and nomenclature means a vain effort at conception McAlmon makes an impression It may be unpleasant it all depends a youth agile and attractive passing by without taking his hat off to anybody Emanuel Carnevali  A PROMISE  The Golden Darkness by Oscar Williams Yale University  Press In Gossamer Grey by Oscar Williams The  Bookfellows Chicago  The ghost of tradition no longer walks insinuating repetition conventionalities of form have been cast aside as snares and delusions Yet anarchy also is being ruled out it has begun to be remembered that discipline is one of the duties of the artist for of what virtue the title artist if selection and organization are to be left to   the public The new generation of poets studying the French symbolists going to school in technique to William Butler Yeats H D and Wallace Stevens infusing a new flexibility into old forms with Edna Millay the new generation has done with the inchoate Perfection has again become the grail subtlety is demanded of rhythm and rhyme and profundity of observation One says what one has to say and ends Above all no digression or elaboration for the sake of the mechanics  Oscar Williams however is no disciplinarian His is a gift horse into whose mouth he has not looked He has taken it been duly grateful cherished it and spared it heavy burdens  Nature naively as in primitive religions is his protagonist She is his lady and he is her troubadour In a rhythm subtle only by instinct in facile rhyme in image and execution varying from the painfully beautiful to the painfully mediocre he sings without affectation and in a single strain like a bird The beauties of dawn of stars of the palpable dusk of twilight and the palpable darkness of night prick him like needles urging him to his single noted song and his gyrations as of a dancing dervish ever and ever around in the same spot One is aware however above all of an authentic urge aware that Oscar Williams is a poet and no mistake In spite of an endless repetition of grandiloquent abstractions mystery darkness vastness strangeness grandeur glamour in spite of banal rhythm and rhyme one realizes that when   A Promise  Oscar Williams arrives at the maturity promised by the isolated lines quoted below he will be a far better poet than he is now  One does not demand great depth of thought of one s lyrists We shall be satisfied if Oscar Williams but plucks consistently  And far away the poised gray mountains Like billows caught in a trance  The tears within the twilight s eyes  Fantasy is lithe like a hound  And he compares the emergence of the earth at dawn to a clenched fist knuckled with crags  The Golden Darkness In Gossamer Gray is in effect supplementary is a promise and not a fulfilment The young poet has just awakened he stands before life rubbing the mist from his eyes He has experienced little He has not yet begun to sing of love that primal theme of lyrists Life hides behind a fog secretive illusory When he has done rubbing his eyes he may come into that clarity of vision one demands of good creative work no matter how subjective or how mystical At present he is a novitiate who has taken his first vows  Ruminationsquotation is perhaps the poem that offers most in So I said I am feeling What I shall always feel The sharp toe of a stone And a shadow s heel So I said I am seeing What I shall always see The snow blossoms of moonlight Blowing on a tree  So I said I am hearing What I shall always hear The winds with hair of starlight Crying wild and clear  So I said I glory in What shall always be mine The flowers flushing red In the sky s blue wine  So I said I am living What I may not be A dusty masterpiece A mouldy biography  Pearl Andelson  SLIGHT SONGS  Songs from the Journey by Wilton Agnew Barrett Geo  H Doran Co  Unfortunately for Mr Barrett one feels an almost irresistible impulse to review the publisher s blurb upon the slip cover of this volume rather then the relatively unimaginative poems which the volume contains The advertising agent who could speak of these frail and somewhat crudely made vessels for an evident sincerity and almost painful earnestness as the strange songs vibrant with passion of a poet humanly great yet clear of eye for the little things why yet we wonder deserves individual attention It is a pity that the   Slight Songs  blurb is so conspicuously placed as to demand a reading since it gives a distorted idea of the poems within  These are the work of a poet seemingly young or inexperienced who sings without much originality of how youth intoxicates itself with the sights and sounds of the city at dusk or refreshes itself under the country pines Mr Barrett pauses to pay appropriate tribute to Francis Thompson to A E Housman to Stephen Phillips and his work gives back now and then a faint echo of the two last named poets and even of Alfred Noyes His verse lacks the smoothness that one expects from an admirer of Housman however One observes a gift for inept metaphor a bouquet of young clouds the scarf of evening sea flows far adown the grassy beach Trees with fretted stars In their lacy hair and a disregard for the assonances of English speech which leads him into such phrases as the love loveliness of leaves Nor has he any great respect for the mot juste here are adjectives of almost inconceivable clumsiness unbefrenzied laughter adjectives long since threadbare impenetrable obliterating years and adjectives that set one s teeth on edge his cozy  spouse  Yet in spite of these defects most of which are due to immaturity and are therefore excusable in a first book the poems have the charm of sincerity and of a sympathetic vision We feel this particularly in The Valley of the Shadow That Night I Danced The House and A   Dead Man Some of his pictures are skilfully constructed even if unmagical there is vividness in Miriam a white birch in a pine forest and in his portrayal of tanagers in a city square  Where toiling Adam stops to watch Tired Eve forgets her apple  Mr Barrett says somewhere I am looking for stars and in that voicing of his determined search he has revealed his worst trespasses against poetry self  consciousness and straining after effect Are not stars most exquisitely and most beautifully reflected from pools of waiting water Muna Lee  A JAPANESE COSMOPOLITE  Seen and Unseen or Monologues of a Homeless Snail  by Yone Noguchi New ed Orientalia New York Selected Poems of Yone Noguchi selected by himself  The Four Seas Co  With the publication of Seen and Unseen in 1898 in San Francisco Yone Noguchi came into being and with him came a new tide of oriental influence into our literature Ethical teachings philosophy of life manufactured by human intellect and long narrative stories were entirely absent from his poems He wrote as he felt this is the essence of oriental poetry While the West was busy preaching to the people through its poetry the East discarded intellectual discussions and   A Japanese Cosmopolite  devoted itself to creating mood if philosophy entered  at all it was the result of the poet s feeling and not of  his intellect Although the poems in Seen and Unseen  were a little nebulous and undefined they were the first  poetry of an oriental expressed in English  Reading through selections from Voice of the Valley  we find this passage in Song of Day in Yosemite Valley  The shout of hell wedded to the silence of heaven completes the valley concert  To feel that strange silence of the mountains and the  sky in the roar of the fall is typically Japanese To feel  and create this poetic silence and through it to suggest  the roar the power and the majesty of the fall without  describing it is the mission of Japanese poets And if  such a poem is successfully written it has infinitely  stronger expression at least to a Japanese than hun  dreds of adjectives piled upon each other by western  poets Yone felt this silence and had he been completely  a Japanese poet he would have centered his effort in  the creation of the silence instead of in describing the  sublimity of the fall as he did in the opening of this  poem O thunderous opening of the unseen gate But this is not a Japanese poem Yone felt the mood  of Japanese poetry and expressed it to a certain degree  through the western medium Should western readers  discover that strange silence in his poetry his mission  will be fulfilled Whether they do or not time alone  will tell The so called oriental influence in western   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  literature today I am afraid is taking the form it has assumed in the other arts which to a great extent have adopted the carcass of Japanese pictures and missed the essence In this respect Yone s Japanese Hokkus published in 1920 is misleading For example  Speak not again Voice The silence washes off sins Come not again Light  This is written in a hokku form seventeen syllables in three lines But the form does not make a hokku Some of the best hokkus are written without this form Where is that fine and illusive mood big enough to illuminate the infinity of the universe which is essential to the hokku I cannot find it This verse may be poetic but perhaps it should have more words more lines and stronger expression The hokku is not condensed milk condensed milk never becomes cream Most of Yone s hokkus sound almost like those of Amy Lowell which miss the essential quality of the type Miss Lowell is of course ignorant of Japanese but Yone  has no such excuse The free verse of today has moved far away from the example which Yone set during the nineties but it owes something to him it acknowledges frankly enough the oriental influence Jun Fujita   Dante in English Rhyme  DANTE IN ENGLISH RHYME  The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri line for line trans  lation by Melville Best Anderson World Book Co  New York  No translation of The Divine Comedy can be altogether acceptable unless in rhyme Prose however faithful is wholly inadequate blank verse however skilful is not much better And the rhyme ought to be titanic achievement the terza rima of the original that endless chain which imposes poetry upon those pedestrian passages that occur even in Dante  Furthermore no version of the Comedy not even the original is fully intelligible and effective without notes These need not be detailed nor need they busy themselves over minor points but they must be present for the sake of a broad and general guidance through the intricacies of Dante s great conception and the labyrinth of an erudition which drew upon all the learning of the time And if these notes be marginal rather than at the bottom of the page or at the end of the volume their usefulness is increased threefold  These requirements are met in the newest translation of the Comedy that of Dr Melville B Anderson now presented after twenty years of labor This translation is in the triple rhyme of the original and is practically line for line Dr Anderson has favored the strong simple direct words of our English speech with scant dependence upon Latinized limbs and outward flour   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ishes Though the employment of terza rima was discouraged by such a Dante scholar as Charles Eliot Norton its use here may be pronounced highly successful The rhyme scheme is maintained with considerable taste and skill throughout and many lines equal the concision and impressiveness of the original ones with no loss of poetic quality  The nub of the Comedy is the thirtieth canto of the Purgatorio with the appearance of Beatrice in the car and the climax of the work is the Beatific Vision in the last canto of the Paradiso Brief excerpts will show Dr Anderson s treatment of these crucial passages  Blessed be thou that comest cried that band Filling the air with flowers along the way O give ye lilies all with liberal hand  is assuredly a satisfactory equivalent for  Tutti dicean Benedictas qui vents  e flor gittando di sopra e dintorno  Manibus o date lilia plenis  and is none the worse for being in one language  With Hallelujah on requickened tongue  is a noble equivalent for  la rivestita voce alleluiando  and  Angels and ministers of life eterne  stands effectively for  ministri e messaggier di vita eterna   Dante in English Rhyme  unless a stress perhaps undue be laid on the fact that ministers scripturally form but one of the general order of angels  In the Beatific Vision of the Trinity the translator employs hendacasyllables speaking roughly our so called weak ending This is of course in high conformity with the scheme of the original I believe there are but six ten syllable lines in the entire Comedy  To me within the luminous deep being Of Lofty Light appeared three circles showing Three colors and in magnitude agreeing  And from the First appeared the Second flowing Like Iris out of Iris and the Third Seemed fire that equally from both is glowing  Truly in English the eleven syllable line leans heavily on the present participle Immediately afterward comes a passage in which the line for line principle is set aside  O luce eterna che sola in te sidi sola t intendi e da te intelletta ed intendente te ami e arridi  becomes  O Light Eterne who dost thyself include Who lovest smiling at thy own intents Self understanding and self understood  a departure which is more than justified by the splendid success of the concluding line The notes as I have indicated are placed where they do the most service and they often have a touch of un   conventionality and informality which makes them not only serviceable but enjoyable For minor detailed points the translator refers us properly enough to well known and easily accessible handbooks  In make up the volume is handsome and intelligent Cover jacket and the few illustrations are highly apropos However the number of the canto might have shown in the running heads and it would have done no harm if the lines themselves had been numbered by the usual threes or fives  On the whole a great achievement Possessing Scartazzini in Italian and Anderson in English one is well equipped indeed other editions and versions might even be dispensed with Henry B Fuller CORRESPONDENCE  A WORD FROM MR UNTERMEYER  To the Editor The few of us who have been worried about the sometimes monotonous heresies of POETRY S younger critics are grateful for the catholicity exhibited in your May number The magazine threatens to become what it used to be an adventure in excitement Where else in one journal I wonder could one hope to find so scornful an attack on feminist poetry as Yvor Winters querulous review of Anna Wickham s book and so   A Word from Mr Untermeyer  incongruous a defense of the jingle of chronic optimism as Gamaliel Bradford s laudation of Eddie Guest  Because of a personal thrust in the first review I am appending an expostulation to these congratulatory sentences Thus Mr Winters beginning his review of  The Contemplative Quarry  The most casual reading if such a thing were possible of Mrs Wickham s work reveals the strength of her candor the intense singleness of her purpose writes Mr Untermeyer in an introduction that makes one admire the shrewdness of the gentlemen who chose him for his task And without wishing to disagree the hesitant reader may be permitted to wonder what candor and purpose may have to do with art  The spectacle of an author championing his publishers is so rare that I take a double pleasure in asking Mr Winters as courteously as possible what secret agents led him to believe that Harcourt Brace and Co chose me to introduce Mrs Wickham to the American public The truth is exactly the opposite for better or for worse I chose them For many years an enthusiastic reader of Mrs Wickham s work as it appeared in England I suggested and prepared a condensed edition of two of her books offering brashly and with malice prepense to supply an appreciatory foreword which I had written for The New Republic Mr Winters in all fairness should attribute to the gentlemen who publish no more shrewdness than they actually possess  But my chief quarrel with your reviewer is based on his second sentence Mr Winters is a poet and he is sensitive enough to know that art like beauty is not a   thing but a relation And yet he writes about it as dogmatically as though he were using a sacrosanct capital A as if art were a static property or a fixed form which one could violate as easily as breaking a vase or dropping the fourteenth line of the sonnet The term itself tends increasingly to such confused thought and cloudy writing that I would like to see an insurgent movement which had for one of its objects the elimination from the language of certain words I refer particularly to the tag ends of literary jargon which have be become as full of contradictions and as empty of meaning as Art Beauty Magic Rhetoric Design Lyric etc Mr Winters should remember what he undoubtedly knows that the desire to write definitely of definite things if Mr Cabell will pardon the realistic paraphrase is as much a province of art as the most subtle interweaving of nuance and overtone And for such creation candor and purpose are not wholly negligible  Louis Untermeyer  Note by the Editor It is hardly necessary to remind Mr Untermeyer that the editors are not responsible for opinions printed in our correspondence section That is partly a protest department and even Mr Guest may find a defender there  Reviews are a different matter If the editor were to permit only her own exact opinions to be expressed in reviews she would needs write them all herself In a general way she endeavors to print reviews which agree on the whole with the feeling and attitude toward the art which the magazine seeks to encourage The reviewer s ardor may sometimes carry him too far but to insist on meticulous modifications might destroy all ardor   Robert Burns Wilson  ROBERT BURNS WILSON  To the Editor Many of my friends and myself were interested in the editorial in your southern number entitled Poetry South The treatment of southern literature seemed to center chiefly about the southeastern states but as passing mention was made of certain Kentuckians we wish to call your attention to the omission of the name of the poet painter Robert Burns Wilson  To any Kentuckian it is almost anathema that our greatly beloved and distinguished poet should be missed from any discussion of southern letters and I venture to say that in the coming revival of interest in southern literature his name will be prominent The contemporary and friend of Madison Cawein James Lane Allen Henry Watterson James Whitcomb Reilly Richard Watson Gilder and a host of other American men of letters there is hardly an event in the literary history of his time with which he was not connected Few Americans who went through the Spanish American War can forget his Remember the Maine and To a Kentucky Cardinal the children of the South learn in their readers In 1909 he received the Memorial Medal for his commemorative poem at the Poe Centenary held at the University of Virginia his home state he migrated to Kentucky and his tribute to Robert E Lee is immortal In the cemetery at Frankfort his monument stands side by side with Daniel Boone s overlooking the Elkhorne River and his bust is in the State House   Wilson s name was familiar in the magazines and he left three books of verse Life and Love The Shadows of the Trees and The Chant of a Woodland Spirit Another book is to be published shortly His daughter has once contributed to your magazine I believe her name is Anne Elizabeth Wilson A Kentuckian NOTES  Certain problems of editorial policy may perhaps be confided to our contributors and readers Of late we have been informed of cases of disappointment and irritation due to our holding accepted poems too long before publication  This impatience is hardly to be wondered at but these poets might be still more disappointed if we should refuse their poems merely because we have no immediate room for them The greatest editorial difficulty we encounter is the temptation to accept more poems than we are able to publish promptly It seems an injustice to send back a good poem but delay is the only possible alternative W e cannot enlarge the magazine as each copy printed being partly paid for by endowment already costs more than its retail price moreover a monthly sheaf of verse should be discreetly small  Apparently there is but one thing to do we must be less hospitable The editors will be compelled hereafter to draw a more stringent line in the acceptance of poems W e have too much advance material on hand but the conquest of soft moods may enable us to begin our next volume in October with a cleaner slate Hereafter we must try to keep the edge of resolution sharp even at the risk of errors of exclusion  W e deeply regret to announce the recent death in Portland Oregon of Joseph Andrew Galahad whose poem A Mood appears in this number  For years this poet has fought gallantly his deadly enemy tuberculosis In his last letter to the editor written February 17th he said I m much better and the old dragon has run away for a whole year   Notes  the doctors tell me I m going to believe them this trip and work as no one ever dreamed of working for that year  His was a heroic spirit and his death means the loss of a friend whose letters were as warm and personal as a hand clasp His poems reflected the spirit of the man one of the best of them Argosy which was first printed in the North American Review presented allegorically his own struggle for life and beauty  Of the poets represented this month

Kerek was my shipmate on a four masted schooner for a nine months trip in the South Pacific He is Lettish by birth but by profession he is an alien a wandering man at home everywhere and nowhere at ease in short a sailor   He is unlettered but not uncultured His poems were spoken to me without his understanding what they were and without my realization at the time They were pitched in a key that the sea knows whispered to me at night in the lantern lighted forecastle confided to me on the forecastle head when I came to relieve him and he lingered a moment loath to quit the comfort of a seat on the anchor windlass the mysterious peace of the hushed water under the forefoot and the aching lunge of the jib boom at the stars I set down what he told me in my journal and months after my return on rereading his phrases I said to myself This is the stuff of which poetry is made And I set myself to interpret it  I may not have done justice to Michaelis Surely if you do not get the impression of a wistful soul longing beyond the possibilities of his intelligence which is what we all are doing I shall have failed but at least I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have done my
