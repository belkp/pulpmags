woods of Trebizend  Hate crouched near him as he strode Down the darkness of the road Where my lord seemed some huge toad  Eyes of murder glared and burned At each bend of road he turned Or where wild the torrent churned  And with Death we stood and stared From the bush as by he fared But he never looked or cared   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He went singing and a rose Lay upon his heart s repose With what thoughts of her who knows  He had done no other wrong But to sing a simple song I have loved you loved you long  And my lady smiled and sighed Gave a rose and looked moist eyed And forgot she was a bride  And my lord saw gave commands I was of his robber bands Love should perish at our hands  Young the knight was He should sing Nevermore of love and spring Or of any gentle thing  When he stole at midnight s hour To my lady s forest bower We were hidden near the tower  In the woods of Trebizend There he met an evil end Night you know is no man s friend   The Troubadour  He had fought in fort and field Borne for years a stainless shield And in strength to none would yield  But we seized him unaware Bound and hung and stripped him bare Left him to the wild boars there  Never has my lady known But she often sits alone Weeping when my lord is gone  Night they say is no man s friend  In the woods of Trebizend There he met an evil end  Now my old lord sleeps in peace While my lady each one sees Waits and keeps her memories  Madison Cawein   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  CLOVER  The clover s grassy breath  To him who listeneth  Upon the pastured lea Is like the monotone Of some far sheep bell blown  From tranquil Arcady  The airs of that last rose  That late and crimson blows  And frosted dies  Smell as in green and dew  The first first rose that blew  In waking Paradise  What fragrance ages hence  Shall tell the listening sense  Of men who guess  Men whose far lives shall range  On paths remote and strange  Our happiness   Poems  APRIL WEATHER  If you could have a perfect day To dream of when your life were done Would you choose one all clear all gay If you could have a perfect day The airs above the wide green way Sheer virgin blue with crystal sun If you could have a perfect day To dream of when your life were done  Or would you have it April s way Haphazard rain haphazard sun Divine and sordid clear and gray Dyed like these hours own work and play All shot with stains of tears and clay Haphazard pain haphazard fun If you could have a perfect day To dream of when your life were done  SUMMER HAIL  Once the heavens gabled door Opened down

walking on and on  Deep beyond all singing Wonderful past singing  Wonderful our road Long and many changing Infinitely changing This more wonderful We are here together You and I together I am your companion You are my companion My own true companion  Let the road side fade Morning on the mountain top Hours along the valley Days of walking on and on Pulse away in silence   On the Great Plateau  In eternal silence  Let the world all fade Break and pass away Yet will this remain Deep beyond all singing My own true companion Beautiful past singing We were here together On this earth together I was your companion You were my companion My own true companion  ON THE GREAT PLATEAU  In the Santa Clara Valley far away and far away Cool breathed waters dip and dally linger towards another day Far and far away far away  Slow their floating step but tireless terraced down the great Plateau Towards our ways of steam and wireless silver paced the brook beds go Past the ladder walled Pueblos past the orchards pear and quince   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Where the back locked river s ebb flows miles and miles the valley glints Shining backwards singing downwards towards horizons blue and bay All the roofs the roads ensconce so dream of visions far  away Santa Cruz and Ildefonso Santa Clara Santa Fé Ancient sacred fears and faiths ancient sacred faiths and  fears Some were real some were wraiths Indian Franciscan years Built the Khivas swung the bells while the wind sang plain and free Turn your eyes from visioned hells look as far as you  can see In the Santa Clara Valley far away and far away Dying dreams divide and dally crystal terraced waters sally Linger towards another day far and far away far away  As you follow where you find them up along the high  Plateau In the hollows left behind them Spanish chapels fade below Shaded court and low corrals In the vale the goat herd  browses Hollyhocks are seneschals by the little buff walled houses Over grassy swale and alley have you ever seen it so Up the Santa Clara Valley riding on the Great Plateau   On the Great Plateau  Past the ladder walled Pueblos past the orchards pear and quince Where the trenched waters ebb flows miles and miles the valley glints Shining backwards singing downwards towards horizons blue and bay All the haunts the bluffs ensconce so breathe of visions far  away As you ride near Ildefonso back again to Santa Fé Pecos mellow with the years tall walled Taos who can  know Half the storied faiths and fears haunting Green New  Mexico Only from her open places down arroyos blue and bay One wild grace of many graces dallies towards another day Where her yellow tufa crumbles something stars and grasses  know Something true that crowns and humbles shimmers from the Great Plateau Blows where cool paced waters dally from the stillness of Puyé Down the Santa Clara Valley through the world from far away Far and far away far away  Edith Wyatt   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ANNIE SHORE AND JOHNNIE DOON  Annie Shore twas sang last night Down in South End saloon A tawdry creature in the light Painted cheeks eyes over bright Singing a dance hall tune  I d be forgetting Annie s singing I d not have thought again But for the thing that cried and fluttered Through all the shrill refrain Youth crying above foul words cheap music And innocence in pain  They sentenced Johnnie Doon today For murder stark and grim Death s none too dear a price they say For such like men as him to pay No need to pity him  And Johnnie Doon I d not be pitying I could forget him now But for the childish look of trouble That fell across his brow For the twisting hands he looked at dumbly As if they d sinned he knew not how   IN THE MOHAVE  As I rode down the arroyo through yuccas belled with bloom I saw a last year s stalk lift dried hands to the light Like age at prayer for death within a careless room Like one by day o ertaken whose sick desire is night  And as I rode I saw a lean coyote lying All perfect as in life upon a silver dune Save that his feet no more could flee the harsh light s spying Save that no more his shadow would cleave the sinking moon  O cruel land where form endures the spirit fled You chill the sun for me with your gray sphinx s smile Brooding in the bright silence above your captive dead Where beat the heart of life so brief so brief a while  Patrick Orr   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE LOST KINGDOM  In the dead city where the waning moon Lights the strange faces of the carven kings With subtle smiles and curiously each rune Upon the emeralds of their signet rings  Paints with dull light there upon each eyelid The weary footed Sleep sits sorrowful And calm upon the painted pyramid The night owl with his blear eyes sad and dull  Keeps watch and desert lions hungry eyed Prowl through the palaces all pale with gold Under the moon where even as they died In some phantasmal ruin centuries old  Lie jewelled guards with golden scimitars And glorious women wound with green and red So beautiful and evil under the stars Not even the gray wolves rend them fair and dead  Ethel Talbot Scheffauer   CONQUERED  O pale O vivid dear O disillusioned eyes Forever near O Dream arise  I will not turn away From the face I loved again Your beauty may sway My life with pain  I will drink the wine you pour I will seek to put asunder Our ways no more O Love O Wonder  THE WANDERER  The ships are lying in the bay The gulls are swinging round their spars My soul as eagerly as they Desires the margin of the stars  So much do I love wandering So much I love the sea and sky That it will be a piteous thing In one small grave to lie  ZOÉ Akins   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EPIGRAMMES  JE N AIME PLUS  Je n aime plus les fleurs elles

They come And the feet that were dancing And the music and laughter Are still And the wreaths that were Of poppies and vine leaves And the sheaves of wheat And the purple fruit of the vineyards That they bore in their hands And the colored robes that they wore Were of one tint and transparence  Silver And lightly they passed And music Long sought and forgotten music  Lifted the mists  And One holding a scourge Whose devious flames  Sang  Bade them kneel down And each ineffable Victim Went forth  Bearing a golden never healing wound   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TO H D  You were all loveliness to me Sea mist the spring The blossoming of trees The wind Giver of Dreams Then A wistful silence guarded you about As in the spring Iris and anemone are guarded And like a flame Your

passed out of the wood into the wood again Dark gray like the mould  A beautiful woman in gray colors came Tall slim golden lilies on her dress were woven The iris joined her for a moment they walked together  The iris returned again  The light of the world was centred in the iris The woman faded for ever  A bent old man arrived an old distorted man His legs short like a tortoise his body long and baggy His face was ugly the nose knobbed the lines and wrinkles  alive He folded a newspaper with work distorted hands He ambled on drab worn and shabby   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Shuffling the dim

tide I catch the cry and moan of every breaker I read the secrets of the sands I the child of Weir the musicmaker  In the white hush before the storm I hear a heavy calling from the ocean The souls of men who drowned at sea Aweary of its restless flowing motion  I am choked with sand Says Jan the fisher A pearl in each hand Says Jan the fisher  One for the earth My grave to be One for the priest

breathless even when the sun withdrawn The shallow moon hangs empty in the blue Chill spring is mine when eager winds pursue The tree boughs traced with chary fringe of tawn And trenchant blades fresh pierce the russet lawn Mute questions asked despaired and asked anew  I am that hunger which all mad Youth is Fretful and faint with fever burning eye Its thin arms dread with sweet concavities Reached out to wisps that beckon and deny Strange unresolving chords and ironies That stir excite yet never satisfy  Alice Ormond Campbell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE TEMPLE  Hear me brother Boldly I stepped into the Temple Into the Temple where the God dwells Veiled with Seven Veils Into the Temple of Unbroken Silence And my joyous feet shod with crimson sandals Rang out on the tesselated pavement Rang out fearlessly Like a challenge and a cry And there in that shrouded solitude There before the Seven Veils There because of youth and youth s madness Because of love and love s unresting heart There did I sing three songs And my first song praised the eyes of a wanton And my second song praised the lips of a wanton And my third song praised the feet of a dancing girl  Thus did I desecrate the Temple Thus did I stand before the Seven Veils Proudly Thus did I wait upon the God s Voice Proudly And the sudden shaft of death   But no Voice stirred the Seven Veils Though I stood long  And my knees shook My bones were afraid  Swiftly I loosed the crimson sandals And tearing them from off my feet Crept shuddering forth  Hear me brother Now am I as one stricken with palsy Now am I sick with the close ache of terror Now am I as one who having tasted poison Cowers waiting for the pang  For the God spake not  And the sense of my littleness is upon me And I am a worm in my own sight Trodden and helpless A casual grain of sand Indistinguishable amid a million grains And I take no pleasure now in youth Nor in youth s madness In love Nor in love s unresting heart   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And I praise no longer the eyes of a wanton Nor the lips of a wanton Nor the light feet of a dancing girl  ONLY NOT TO BE TOO EARLY OLD  Only not to be too early old Only not to feel too soon the day Emptied of all desire unyielding gray Only not to sink too weary and cold For fireside mirth for friendly talk for free Soul kindling thought about it and about Nay I would rather end life in a rout Stricken low by folly dropping with a laugh  Than creep thus tamely out Trailing the tatters of my mystery To the dull cadence of an epitaph   THE COMRADE  Call me friend or foe Little I care I go with all who go Daring to dare  I am the force I am the fire I am the secret source Of desire  I am the urge The spur and thong Moon of the tides that surge Into song  Call me friend or foe Little care I I go with all who go Singing to die  Call me friend or foe Taking to give I go with all who go Dying to live  Lee Wilson Dodd  POETRY A Magazine of Verse COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  CONTEMPORARY POETRY AND THE UNIVERSITIES  I HAVE had occasion lately to speak with several university professors of literature on the subject of contemporary poetry In each case I have surprised a look of polite inquiry whenever any poet of a date more recent than 1890 was mentioned Of course there were exceptions that proved the rule Mr Alfred Noyes and Mr W B Yeats have lectured before American colleges Mr Masefield s fame has reached the classic walls But these are the exceptions My surprise was perhaps the greatest when I encountered the head of a certain Romance department expecting from him some illumination on the subject of modern French poetry If he were living in France would his interest have stopped short with the French symbolists Would he have come as it were to the brink of a precipice with Baudelaire Verlaine and Mallarmé and consider himself even at that as the most ultra modern of his kind  Why is it that the college literary courses establish no direct contact with modern life in so far as poetry is concerned The novel fares better The student who is fortunate enough to have attended lectures by Mr Robert Herrick does not venture out into the world supposing that the novel stopped suddenly with Thackeray or Dickens But the average student is likely to leave college firmly rooted in the belief that poetry ceased with Shelley or Keats or Tennyson or Browning as the case may be   Contemporary Poetry and the Universities  A scientific department conducted as a literary department is conducted with no consideration of the achievements of the last thirty years would be a disgrace to any college  It is the gap unbridged by the university course which is of most vital consequence to the student and when after much false subsequent groping that gap is bridged finally the student is often no longer a student and the first flush of the formative creative period is passed College students in literary courses remind one of rows of bleaching celery banked and covered with earth they are so carefully protected from any coloring contact with the ideas of the living present  The other day the literary department of Princeton telegraphed to Mr Vachel Lindsay to come down and recite his poems and talk about poetry to the students This for an American poet is so far as I know a unique phenomenon It is characteristic of the academic system that William Vaughn Moody was required to correct prose themes rather than to speak directly during all the time that he was connected with the University of Chicago on the subject of contemporary poetry One could name at least a dozen living American poets whose creative enthusiasm might prove stimulating to members of the younger generation if it were decided to expose the students to it  Of late the modern drama and the modern novel have been considered not wholly unworthy of academic consideration but modern poetry and modern art remain the outcasts and pariahs of the institutions of formal education  A C H   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MODERN GERMAN POETRY I In the notes which follow I shall touch briefly upon some aspects of modern German poetry suggesting the problems which beset the poets and indicating as far as possible the line upon which they have approached their task A consideration of a poet s outlook is of primary importance because other things being equal it is upon this that the value of his work and its chances of survival ultimately depend Europe has been chary of admitting the existence of a German culture France ever jealous of art and letters outside her borders has shrugged her shoulders contemptuously England suspicious of anything she cannot readily understand has been consistently skeptical Nevertheless there can be no possible doubt of the reality of German culture and in the light of present events it would be interesting to study this culture more profoundly and compare it with the achievements of other European countries and with the culture of America For the outstanding feature of German culture is the fact that it is the exclusive possession of a small class The culture of other lands is the possession of the whole nation In England it is handed down the classes feudalwise Born in the upper classes which set the standard it is enthusiastically caught up through snobbism by each class beneath which gets as near to the standard as possible As the English are conservative progress though steady is slow and the last lines are relatively not so far behind In France   Modem German Poetry  and Italy their culture is an inherited tradition as much the birthright of the hairdresser as of the litterateur In Germany culture is the monopoly of the professional thinking classes not what we call the professional classes but a class which has officially adopted thought as a profession The German intellect is capable of intense thought and unremitting labor and this small class has attained to a very high state of culture It is a strange self conscious thing their culture heavy laden with accumulated evidence encyclopaedic full of curious disproportions The German savants have a mania for cataloguing for filing for reducing the most abstract speculation to scientific form They are at once clerical and esoteric in their outlook They acquire all the available knowledge greedily but they often use it unintelligently and they have absolutely no humor Nevertheless the results of their labor are important and eminently worthy of study  But just because the thinking class is so small and so immeasurably in advance of the rest of the population it has very little influence on the nation s life This is especially true in that phase of its activities which finds expression in art This is moreover its least admirable phase for the German genius has always shown itself more philosophic and scientific than aesthetic The arts with the obvious exception of music have not flourished in Germany for centuries Since the days of German Gothic Germany s painting has been negligible and the modern revival has produced singularly uninspired results The reasons for this are similar   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  to the reasons for the comparative failure of the main mass of modern German poetry and must be attributed partly to the isolated position of the artists who form a small portion of the thinking class and partly to the frantic efforts they have been forced to make to produce quickly an art which shall be worthy of the new Germany both in extent and character Modern Germany has demanded an art as glittering and imposing as her army and on the same scale The artists have felt themselves bound to demonstrate that centuries of artistic achievement count for nothing and that a systematized effort can create a harvest without seed The poets have the same duty imposed upon them They have in fact not only to produce a harvest without seed but to destroy weeds in plenty before they start For their tradition is overgrown with sentimentalism and no conditions could be more unfavorable to fine art than those in which the modern poets in Germany have found themselves  By modern German poetry I mean poetry written within the last forty years that is within the period synchronising with the consolidation of modern Germany with the rise of the Krupp factory the army and the war party and with Germany s commercial expansion A poet would be inevitably influenced by this environment But he would as inevitably be influenced by the poetical tradition of this country The German tradition in poetry as in all the arts has been as I have said intensely sentimental from the days when Walter von der Vogelweide sang  Untcr den linden An der Heide   Modem German Poetry  Da unser zweier bette was  Da muget ir vinden  Schoene beide  Gebrochen bluomen unde gras  Vor dern walde in einem tal  Tandaradei  Schoene sanc diu nachtegal  The modern poet can find no vitality in his country s verse until he reaches the lyrics of Heine the Jew The classical period he finds obsessed with the sentimental melancholy which appeared for centuries the outstanding feature of the national character It was perhaps partly due to the undeniably melancholy character of the German landscape or perhaps to a fundamental passivity in the German character when allowed to develop on its own lines freely However that may be the modern poet found the German tradition sentimental and if he was a well educated young man he was bound to respect it Here however his dilemna began For he was surrounded by a generation which cast aside the sentimental tradition and cried out for a new Germany of howitzers and cut prices and which called for an up to date culture to keep pace with it He was between the devil and the deep deep sea  The poets set to work to solve the problem in various ways Some of them such as Dehmel Dauthendey Hille George decided to be good and stick to the tradition and they won themselves thereby a reputation and perhaps some gold Others compromised Their high priest is Liliencron Detlev Freiherr von Liliencron who conceived the ingenious plan of writing sentimental verses about soldiers   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I have not yet struck the poet who wept gently over a falling market but I doubt not he exists Others flung in their lot with the modern spirit They would sing no more of smiling harvests or of gloomy forests beneath the moon or of mothers suckling infants at their breast they would sing of the life in a Grosse Stadt of trams and American bars and ladies of the demi monde  O komm O komm Geliebte In der Bar Verrat der Mixer den geheimsten Tip Und uberirdisch himmlisch steht dein Haar Zur Rôtlichkeit des Cherry Brandy Flip  Thus sings Ernst Blass in Der Kondor Eine rigorose Sammlung radikaler Strophen which appeared from Heidelberg in 1912 and in which a number of these up todate young men published their poems In a year or two this book will be curiously out of date Its most ultra modern flashes will ring as strangely as a man writing today of the fierce speed of the bicycle Yet it is worth reading in spite of its vulgarity and its silliness for here we find some real vitality strangely misapplied and some experiments in versification essays in vers libre and attempts at new methods of expression Take the following which presents the poet s emotions at three o clock in the morning  Bôses Stampfen Vom Lauschen vom Warten   Grunliches Hammern wie in der Chloroform Narkose  Ein Pumpwerk zerstôsst die Nacht  Drôhnt  Mein Herz explodiert Die Angst arbeitet rhythmisch exakt  Aus einer Rôhre einem Trichter einer Trompeté   Modern German Poetry  Fliesst schleimiger Schein Das morastgelbe Licht der Welt meiner Welt Der Lichtkegel trifft mein Ohr Leider bin ich verdammt aus diesem schmutzigen Licht Angst  zu pulsen den Schein in Grauen zu transformieren in Sentiments in Elend Quartsch Das dauert

nicht in Betracht kommt Kein Leben keine Schminke um mich Nur die Angst meine Dame Blicke kratzten stàchen mich Ich schriee stampfte hautlos ich  Nur verschrumpfte Gebete gelingen Keine Gebet

ausserste Das isolierte Brennen heiliger Nervenspitzen letzter Nahrung  des Brandes Zuckende Reserven zungelnd im Dampf im Krampf Ûbrigens bin ich durchaus im stande den Ablauf solcher  Empfindungen brusk zu unterbrechen Amerikanismus  anzuordnen und mit einer Cigarette kiihlsten Herzens  weiterzulesen in Henri Beyles Le Rouge et le Noir Selbstverstàndlich Die Lampe brennt ja noch  Here we have a daring attempt by Ferdinand Hardekopf  Its weakness is its exotic character It is all frankly deriva  tive a German copy of a French model It is Guillaume  Apollinaire dressed up in the Friedrichstrasse and it has  much of the affected babbling of a blasé youth without   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  experience Moreover there is much in it to sadden us For we see here traces of another aspect of the poet s dilemma  Isolation is a dangerous thing for highly strung sensibilities The violent change in the outlook of the main mass of the German people in the last few generations the change from the outlook of the traditional poets to the outlook of the Crown Prince and the Handelsbank has had disastrous results upon personalities too thin skinned to adapt themselves and neurosis is today a real danger destroying the best brains in the country W e find this expressed in the plays of Wedekind and no class is more affected by it than the litterateurs In Der Kondor we have poems which are the expression of minds turned inward upon themselves revolving in a vicious circle as much out of touch with the root springs of life as with modern German civilization Poor ailing creatures with pale fingers and sunken cheeks voicing their obsessions in a café  But over and above the main body of poets who have succumbed to the equivocal position of the poet in modern German society one or two men stand out who have overcome their difficulties To be concluded  Reginald H Wilenski  FRENCH POETS AND THE WAR  How many young writers how many poets will be cut down by the war in the flower of their life There has been a good deal of talk of Péguy killed at the battle of the Marne where he commanded a company as officer de   French Poets and the War  réserves He was admired by some and disliked by many But after recent events he would have been destined to a considerable amount of fame which would have found no opposers It is one of the saddest things in these great contests between nations that the finest minds are dragged from their work tables and thrown into the trenches those minds whose work was desired by humanity like a benediction I know one man whose life is in danger every day and whose death would leave me inconsolable  But then Sophocles was a soldier Descartes was a soldier Fate is not always disastrous And though a man of forty may not have finished his work he has laid the foundations and indicated its general scheme everything is not lost for humanity Much more pitiful are those who die like plants which have just flowered or only budded Some of us cared for these young men whose deaths have brutally disappointed our hopes and people ask each other what will remain of the younger generation after the war  And what will be the spirit of the survivors after these days of danger and heroism Will they hate or will they respect war What souls will come through this test It is perhaps too early to think of such questions but time though it passes in horror passes all the same It passes on the battle fields and in peaceful meadows it hovers on the same wing over dreaming towns and over towns engaged in daily work  Yes we may well ask ourselves what will be the awakening from this nightmare Economists and statisticians have   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  calculated that the wounded world will need about five years in which to recover its health Perhaps But others think that the recovery will be quicker and that humanity still stricken will be suddenly seized with a furious desire for life The world will not give itself a respite for convalescence People will desire to live at any price and to spend their scarcely recovered powers while the grass covers the buried bodies In minds as in the world there will be an unsuspected renewal of strength to which all will submit Something stronger than death will arouse those who have escaped from death and they will want to live twice for themselves and for those who are no more There will be everywhere a flowering of that plant now practically abolished in the greater part of Europe joy  If it still flowers it is on the battle fields for those who hold back do not know it If there is still gaiety in the world it is under the shells and in the midst of the shrapnel The soldiers one meets who are coming back from the battle or who have been wounded and healed and are returning speak of these hours which seem to us so terrible not indeed as pleasure parties but as hours profoundly moving because they are dangerous I was listening to one the other day who after some anecdotes about the life of an advanced out post concluded But I like it it is something out of the ordinary And he was returning to his regiment with an incredible joy  I know that every soldier is not of so happy a disposition and that more than one is miserable in those murderous   French Poets and the War  trenches where shells are the only visitors But these are fewer than one imagines In war the soldier becomes a fatalist There are a number of Mohammedans among the allies but all have become Mohammedans in fatalism and in contempt for danger A second soul is grafted upon the everyday soul an extraordinary soul upon the ordinary soul and man becomes again what civilization has never been able to stamp out a dangerous being for whom danger does not exist  But the peril once passed he will take up with an inconceivable facility his habits as a civilized man a man that is to say whose efforts are directed toward escaping from pain I have myself seen in a provincial hospital a man wounded in the horrible battle at Charleroi where there were so many killed that the bed of the Meuse was choked show terror at the idea of an insignificant operation This man who could not be held back during the fight and who rushed recklessly upon danger had to be held down while a bullet was extracted from his arm  During a battle the imagination has no time to work A man is suddenly borne into surroundings which absorb and inspire him while he blanches before a peril which he has had time to consider coldly The best and happiest soldiers are the men without imagination It is the same in ordinary life which is also dangerous sometimes imagination destroys the power for action  It is for this reason that at this time I think above all of the poets of the men of imagination of the dreamers   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  They also make good soldiers soldiers for the sake of duty but they are more deserving of praise than the common people with their coarser brains who only perceive evil at the moment they feel it themselves  Remy de Gourmont Translated by Richard Aldington  NOTE The first number of the Bulletin des Ecrivains 19141915 printed privately which I have just received tells us that among the French writers who are actively at the front twenty have died on the battle field more than thirty have been wounded and a certain number are in hospitals for illnesses contracted during service R A  REVIEWS  You and I by Harriet Monroe Macmillan  Miss Monroe both as editor and as creator has done so much for the art of poetry in the

catholic attitude toward the revolutionists in verse the Imagists and Futurists is not a matter of liberal taste alone it is a matter of genius for mingling perception and philosophy with a musical skill all her own We wonder with this poem before us why she   Reviews  has clung so largely to the choral and symphonic effects of her earlier work It is not a question of her failure to make good use of these forms But we incline to the belief that in the free measures and as to certain phases of modern life her vision would find closer expression for which opinion The Hotel is ample proof On the other hand some of Miss Monroe s lyrics of the swifter and intenser sort justify her large adherence to rhyme and the classical methods Nancy Hanks and The Childless Woman are among these successes The music of the latter with its antistrophic movement and impression of double rhyme is unusual indeed  O mother of that heap of clay so passive on your breast Now do you stare at death woman who yesterday were blest  There is subtlety and a lyric quality in The Wonder of It not to be passed over These things we say with the conviction that the author s artistry if not the realization of her conceptions shows at its best in her odes rather than in her lyrics She seems to require dithyrambic lines and a soft diffusion of color for the complete out pouring of her gifts But we predict that her growing realism and the gradual emancipation of her art here evident from classical expletives and exclamation will drive her closer to the living flesh of future subjects rhyme or no rhyme Rhyme must give way more and more where it results in spiking a subject about with javelins that do not pierce the heart of the theme  Anyone who has practiced the art of poetry and mastered its literature measurably as well as Miss Monroe has can well understand the irresistible temptation to treat subjects   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of modern life with something of the majestic form by which the ode is distinguished Some years ago Kipling essayed to describe a locomotive in the manner of Homer Our modern machinery buildings works of engineering our cities are truly cyclopean and Pindaric effects seem at first to give these subjects pictorial and aural expression They would do so if our modern eyes could see an aeroplane or a ship canal through them It is a question how nearly a Greek saw an Olympian game through an ode of Pindar and whether he got an idealization or an ennobled image through the excitation of the imagination or whether he saw it clearly and abstracted a vital significance from it The final question is how much has been seen with the inner eye and also how much so seen has been unified into relations of truth and beauty and intelligible significance  Miss Monroe s poems such as Night in State Street The Ocean Liner Our Canal have varied music and loftiness of conception but they do not seem to measure up to her sense of realism Such lines from The Ocean Liner as  Steel hulls impenetrable  To the waves that tease and pull  Bright engines that answer the beat  Of their foam slippered dancing feet  stand out brilliantly against a back ground of swirling color And The Turbine which is written in iambic pentameter  contains these lines  What is this crystal sphere  In my hand it lies  Cold and inert its puny artery  That curling cob web film ashen and dead   Reviews  These quotations show with what precision Miss Monroe can visualize her imaginings And yet while confessing that the judgment may not be founded upon principles of art it seems to us that simple quatrains or free verse would have given us more perfectly what was so clearly before her eyes It may help out the argument to mention that there are among the accepted classics of English poetic literature more successes in the manner of The Ode to the West Wind and To a Grecian Urn and To a Skylark than in the manner of Wordsworth s Ode on Intimations of Immortality Again let us quote this time from At Twilight  The long white lights that glisten Through Michigan Avenue With the red lights down the middle Where the street shines mirror wet While the rain strung sky is a fiddle For the wind to feel and fret  The fifth line in a flash reproduces one of our Chicago skies seizing the reality with wonderful truth There are pictures and music in abundance throughout the book and a wide variety of subjects treated there are fugues and simple melodies and sonnets of power The double sonnet Pain is unforgettable both for feeling and sound  E L M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The Cry of Youth by Harry Kemp Kennerley  Mr Kemp s voice is rather raw and strident and not so young as the title of his book would indicate but now and then it is a poet s voice singing to a brass band accompaniment of the miseries of the down and out and the compensating freedom of the open road Some of the poems are obvious others melodramatic but the best of them are authentic revelations of life with something of pity and terror in their emotion Of these the best is The Ride in which the eerie suggestion of companionship of murderer and victim is carried with perfect aplomb to a strong climax  In such dialect poems as The Tramp s Confession The Harvest Fly s Complaint Cashing In we have flashes of the under dog s point of view his vision as well as his pain And in poems like Kansas In a Storm and Mount Rainier  Snow garmented immense And holding audience With subject clouds  in these we breathe far blowing western winds Such a phrase also as with star seas a wash at thy feet is a not unworthy tribute to this poet s God H AI  My Lady s Book by Gerald Gould Kennerley  Much love poetry comes to this office presenting all phases of the subject from tepid amorousness to erotic madness But not often is the well worn theme treated with such simplicity and freshness as in this thin little white volume   Our Contemporaries  Mr Gould has the singing voice not powerful but delicate He attains softly musical cadences and jeweled phrases Many a lover poet has ranted about his passion through stormy odes without once convincing us of his emotion But we do not question the quiet poignancy of the brief poem which begins thus  My love is fair she is better than fair to me She puts me in mind of a white sea gull flying over the sea She puts me in mind of a dim wind going softly in the grass Of things remembered and young things and things that shall  come to pass  H M  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  I am so glad you like to see parts of the Saturday Transcript and it will give me pleasure to send them to you The editorials are usually bosh but the paper reflects the tone and mode of thought of a certain part of Boston and the thirty six or forty eight pages do what they can to guide and enlighten the Bostonian Someone told me the other day of a spook who comes back daily to his old home to read The Transcript  So writes a member of the older generation to a young  relative in the west happily enclosing a copy of The  Transcript containing Mr William Stanley Braithwaite s  review of magazine poetry for the year 1914 And having  like the spook fallen a victim to the spell of The  Transcript I would not presume to criticise a paper which   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  affords Mr Braithwaite this generous opportunity to enlighten Bostonians on the subject of modern poetry Indeed we can only regret that other papers do not afford other critics and other communities an equal opportunity If they did there would be more chance for a liberal congress of opinion and there would be greater publicity for the poets who need publicity in order that their art may be shared not by Bostonians alone but by their contemporaries in each centre of this nation s ninety nine million inhabitants One poet to a million is not too much to expect but is there any single poet in the United States unless it be Mrs Ella Wheeler Wilcox with the combined circulation of the Hearst newspapers who has a million readers Are there all told a million readers of contemporary poetry in the United States I believe there are but their interest is sporadic and unorganized and it is for this reason that one must applaud Mr Braithwaite s valiant attempt to effect a co ordination of interest between poets and readers even though one may disagree radically with his standards of selection  Mr Braithwaite has subjected six hundred and forty seven poems to an impartial test and out of this number one hundred and fifty seven emerge as poems of distinction and thirty of these are given particularly honorable mention We believe that the gentleman s intention is just and that he honestly believes that his test is impartial But all judgment is human and Mr Braithwaite s judgment remains Mr Braithwaite s Every prisoner has a right to a jury   Our Contemporaries  and every poet is a prisoner until he is given the liberty of recognition If Mr Braithwaite were multiplied by twelve other critics performing a like service in other newspapers it is possible that there might not be so many sins of omission and commission Why Mr Braithwaite chooses just the seven magazines that he does to stand as monumentally as the churches of Asia is not quite clear It is incredible that the Atlantic Monthly should have so fallen from grace as not to be included in this list or why there should be this limit at all we do not quite understand POETRY fares as well as the Atlantic for two poems have been singled out from each But the St Louis Mirror gets no mention at all and thus Mr Edgar Lee Masters fine Spoon River Anthology from which we quoted in our November number one of the year s most important achievements passes  unnoticed  Will the newspaper editors of the Middle West please copy A C H  THE DEATH OF MADISON CAWEIN  The death of Madison Cawein which occurred on the eighth of December in Louisville is a deep grief to his many friends and admirers  Born at Louisville in 1865 he was still a young man when Mr Howells warm greeting of his first book of verse gave him an authoritative introduction to American   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  readers Since then he has published many small volumes which were united in 1907 in his Complete Poetical Works 5 vols Three years later Mr Howells reaffirmed his early praise of the poet in an introduction to a volume of selections Publishers E P Dutton amp Co New York  This is not the moment to attempt a critical review of Madison Cawein s work Many of his poems have been much quoted and dearly loved and time no doubt will select a few for permanent honor in the anthologies of American song Meantime we can only regret his too early death and recall the gracious charm the fine gentleness of his character  POETRY is fortunate in being able to offer to its readers one of his most recent poems  NOTES  The poets
