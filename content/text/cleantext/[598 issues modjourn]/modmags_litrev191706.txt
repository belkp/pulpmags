their odor filled a water palaceI saw a king s daughter Upon the roof garden of the water palaceShe was half drunk and she dancedHer curling body killing her strengthShe grimaced languidlyShe smiled

clothes about meAnd could not sleepThe perfume of your clothes has stayed three yearsIt will always be with meBut you will never come backWhile I think of you yellow leaves outside Are droppingand

not talk loudlyFor I fear to surprise the people in the sky Push Face jhIT is a great thing to be living when an age passesIf you are born in an age in which every impact of its expression is a painthere is a beautiful poetic vengeance in being permitted to watch that age destroy itselfWhat other age could have so offendedInstead of pursuing the real business of lifewhich is to livemen have turned all their denials and repressions into the accumulation of unessential knowledge and the making of indiscriminate thingsOther ages have taken out their repressions in religious frenziesbut this age has taken everything out in motionIt is an elementary fact of sex knowledge that rythmic motion is part of sex expressionIsn t it ironical and immoral that those nations which have prided themselves most on their virtueand have hugged tightest to themselves the puritanic idealare the ones that have gone maddest over motionAmericabeing the most virtuousobviously has the least sense of humor and has exceeded herselfFrom the The Little Review cradle to the turbine enginefrom the rocking chair to the spinnings and whirlings of a Coney Islandshe has become a national mechanical perpetual whirling DervishThe wheels became rollers which have rolled life out thin and flatThen Art cried out with all her voicesIn the last few years we have had a return to the beginnings of all the ArtsIf there ever comes a time in the world when men will give their attention to the life of Art and understand its movementthey will find it alert and inevitableLife would follow it trustingly if it were not for the intrusions and hindrances of menThe Thing had happenedLife had made its protest through ArtBut this consciousness never reached the unendowed mindItthe unendowed mindforced Life to avenge itself by flying into warIII pray God said President Wilson that the outcome of this struggle may be that every element of difference amongst us will be obliterated The spirit of this people is already unitedand when suffering and sacrifice have completed this unionmen will no longer speak of any lines either of race or association cutting athwart the great body of this nation BUT the Anarchistswho are never agreeable or content in any countryno matter how perfectarranged a non conscription meeting in a hall in Bronx Park the night before registrationSounited was the spirit of this peoplethat no one attended this non conscription meeting except the 5 000 who crowded the hall and the 50 000 who stood outside in the streets for several hoursThere were squads of the usual police and dozens of rough raw fellows in soldiersuniforms to hold back the crowd and keep it in order a crowd that scarcely moved and seldom spoke except in low tones or in foreign languagesa crowd too full for speechbecause of this last numbing disappointment in AmericaThe only demonstration it made was to applaud when an echo of the applause inside the hall reached itAny attempt to get nearer the hall was met with clubs and the fists of soldiers in your faceNasty little Fords with powerful search lights raced up and down and about the hollow squareA huge auto truck hung with red lights acted as a mower at the edgesWord went about that it was mounted with a machine gunThe Little Review As I was pushed about in the crowd I overheard always the same conversations Is she thereOver there where the light isYeson the second floorAre there any people insideOh it s full since seven o clockOh Will they let her speakWhoHer Silence Will they get herdo you thinkWill the police take her A thin pale Russian Jewstanding on a rock looking over the heads of the crowdwas spoken to by a stranger They ll get her tonight all right The Russian looked over to the lighted windows of the hall and said in revolutionary voice She s a fine womanEmma Goldman Suddenly in the densest part of the crowd a woman s voice rang out Down with conscriptionDown with the war Several other women took it up The police charged into the crowdThe crowd made a slight standThe soldiers joined the policeand with raised clubsteeth bared and snarlingthey drove the crowd backward over itselfbeating and pushingThree times the crowd stoodThree times they were chargedWomen were beaten down and run overMen were clubbed in the face and escapedstaggering and bleedingHow much of this treatment will it take to obliterate every element of individuality amongst usIII In the same week the plutocrats and artists held an Alley Festa for the Red CrossAt a cost of10 000 they turned the stables of MacDougal Alley into a

Collar Bone of a Hare Would I could cast a sail on the waterWhere many a king has gone And many a king s daughterAnd alight at the comely trees and the lawnThe playing upon pipes and the dancingAnd learn that the best thing is To change my loves while dancing And pay but a kiss for a kissI would find by the edge of that water The collar bone of a hare Worn thin by the lapping of waterAnd pierce it through with a gimlet and stare At the old bitter world where they marry in churchesAnd laughover the untroubled waterAt all who marry in churchesThrough the white thin bone of a hareJuly

PetrogradFebruary1917MY DEAR LYDIAOnce more to the chargeIn your answer to my letter I feel the new touch of an independent attackVillerant comes inbut I feel this time that you have set your own dear person up for a rebuffYou have not sent me any Aunt Sallybut my Grecian wifeI will take two things and answer them Firstyou object to my treatment of the Gentlemanbecause you sharply maintainmore or lessthat I by no means object to being a gentleman myself On that pointmy dear girlyou have not got meFor many purposeson occasion I should not hesitate to emphasize the fact that I was not born in the gutterIffor instanceI was applying for a post where such a qualification was necessaryHarrow would not be forgottenThe Gutter generally spoils a man s complexion in childhoodHe grows up with sores around his mouth and a constantly dirty skinHis eyesunless he has them well in handbecome wolfish and hardetcWho would not be better pleased that he was born on the sunny side of the wallAll that has nothing to do with my argumentThose things are in themselves nothing to linger roundalthough the oppositesqualor and meannessit is more excusable to remember and lamentBut in your last letter you reveal an idea that seems chiefly to have struck youand which is at the bottom of your present obstinacyIn your letter of last month you kept it in the backgroundor did not state it in so many words In once more reading through your present letterI find you have not even stated it thereBut 1 seeI believethe notion that has found favour with you I will give you my opinion on it in the form of a criticism of an article I read yesterday in an English paperone of those you sent me A Russian war novel is discussedThe writer of the articledoes not care much for Russian books he finds thatthe Englishman begins where the Russian leaves off The Russian book seems to deal with the inner conflict of a Russian grocer on the outbreak of WarThe Russian grocer is confused and annoyedHe asks what all this bloody trouble has to do with him the small grocerHe cogitates on the causes of such upheavalsand is not convinced that there is anything in them calling for his participationBut eventually he realizes that there is a great and moving abstraction called Russia the old abstraction in factthe old Pied Piper whistling his mournful airsand waving towards a snow bound horizonAnd le voilà in khakiror the Russian equivalentAt this point he becomesnoble and of interest to the writer of the article But therealasthe book ends Now of course the writer of the article continueswe in England do not do things in that wayWe do not portray the boring and hardly respectable conflictNo Englishmanall Englishmen having the instincts of gentlemenadmits the possibility of such a conflictWe are accomplished beingsdes hommesou plutôt des gentlemen faitsWe should begin with the English grocer already in khakiquite calm he would probably be described as a littlegrimwithalin the midst of his military training on Salisbury PlainA Kiplingesque picture of thatRevetting would come inand bomb throwing at nightHe next would be in the trenchesThe writer would showwithout the cunninghardly respectabledisguise of any arthow the Balham grocer of to day was the same soldierreallythat won at WaterlooYou would not get a person or a factbut a piece of patriotic propagandathe writer of course being meanwhile a shrewd fellowhighly approved and well paid Now glance at Tolstoi for a momentthat arch Russian boreand at his book of Sebastopol sketchesHe was an hereditary nobleand it is rather difficult to say that an hereditary noble is not a gentlemanBut can the English journalist in hisfort intérieuradmit that Tolstoi was a gentlemanall things consideredThese foreignnoblesare a funny sort of gentlemenanywayFor let us see how Tolstoi writes of the Russians at SebastopolHe arrives at the town of SebastopolHe has read in the Moscow newspapers of theheroic defenders of Sebastopol His first impression is one of astonishment and disappointment of a sortFor there is nothing noticeably heroic about the demeanour of the soldiers working at the quays or walking in the streetsThey are not even heroic by reason of The Little Review the ineffablecheerinessof the British Tommy No journalist would be tolerated for a moment who did notonce in every twenty linesremark on this ineffable national heroism of humourTolstoithat isdoes not want to see heroesbut men under given conditions andthat issure enoughwhat he seesHe alsobeing an hereditary noble and so ondoes not want to make his livingOne more opportunity of truth and clearnessNextwhen Tolstoi gets up to the bastionshe again sees no heroes with any ineffable national cachetTheheroesof his sketches and talesin factstoop and scurry along behind parapets in lonely sectorsand when they see another man coming straighten themselves outand clank their spursThey kill people in nightmaresand pray pessimistically to their GodYou cannot at the end apply any labels to themTolstoi s account of their sensations and genuine exploits would not strike terror in the heart of future enemies of the Russian raceit is not an advertisementor the ordinary mawkish bluff thrown over a realityHe had the sense to see human beings and not RussiansAnd Russians are chiefly redoubtableand admirablebecause of this capacity of impersonal seeing and feelingWhere they are least Russian in factThe discriminating enemy in reading these sketcheswould fear that more than he would any unreal or interested gushThere always remains the question as to whetherby gush and bluff and painting a pretty picture of a manyou cannot make him become that pictureand whetherpoliticallyit may not be desirable to manufacture illusions of that descriptionBut what have we got to do with politiciansAgainI am not saying that Russians have not a national gushTolstoi himself indulges in itEverybody indulges in such thingsIt is a question only of the scale of such indulgenceof the absence per head in a population of the reverseSo thenwhat the paper writer s point amounted to was that only gentlemenorsententiouslymenwere worth writing about or only at the moment when a man becomes agentlemanis he interestingworth noticingor suitable for portrayalWe allhoweverknow the simple rules and manifestations of this ideal figureThere is not much left to say on the subjectAh yesbut there is such and such a one s ineffable way of being a gentleman In London you will meet few educated people who really are willing or able to give Russian books their clueDostoevsky is a sort of epileptic boreTolstoi a wrong headed old altruistic boreGorky a Tramp stunt boreTurgenevevenalthough in another categoryin some way disappointing All Russian writers insist on discovering Americaopening discussions on matters that our institutionsour position in societyour Franco English intelligence preclude any consideration ofThere is something permanently transcendental and disconcerting about the Slav infantand he pours his words out and argues interminablyand is such an inveterate drunkardas though his natural powers of indecorum and earnestness were not already enoughWhat really could be said of the Russian is this Shakespeare is evidently better than any Russian novelistor more permanently valuableBut the little Russian Grocer could rival Hamlet in vaccilationor any RussianShakespearein his portrayal of the machinery of the mindDostoievsky is not more dark and furiuos than Shakespeare s pessimistic figuresLearMacbethetcBut we are not Englishmen of Shakespeare s daysWe are very pleased that in the time of Elizabeth such a national ornament existedBut Shakespeare would be an anachronism to dayDostoevsky and Cowere anachronisms as contemporaries of Tennyson and Napoleon IIIHad they been embedded two centuries back in Sixteenth Century Russiathey would not be readbut would not cause annoyance and be called epileptic boresEpilepsy would have been all right in those distances There is nothing dévoué about epilepsy to dayany more than there is about a KingI think I have been lucidif rather long windedHow I look on these Christian Demi Gods of the Steppes you knowI like them immenselyFor a single brandyish whiff from one of Dostovesky s mouthsat some vivid angle of turpitude I would give all English literature back to Shelley s songsTurgenev s Sportsman s Sketches enchant meThey are so soberdelicate and nonchalantI can think of nothing like themGogol s Tchichikoff is back with CervantesSterne and the others who have not any peers in these daysTodaythe requirements of the little manespecially of this dayare a similar thing to the Russianthe EnglishmanetcWe must disembarrass ourselves of this fetish or gushas of that otherI want to live with Shakespeare and Cervantes 26 The Little Review and I have gone to war for good with all things that would oppose a return to those realitiesI feel youin my absencebecoming enmeshed in environing respectability and its amiable notionsI feel that this letter may require another fervour to drive homeor excuseits own A coup de poing is the best method of enforcing an ideaor a shell the mouth is similarly a more satisfactory aperture than the ear for introducing a philosophy into another bodyYorke is the embodyment of my philosophyI love Yorke in exactly the way that I love a character in Molière or TurgenevYorke is the only living thing except yourselfthat I know or find alive to the same extentI shall stick here a little longerand see what comes of my new ventureThere have been lots of delays and difficulties which I will recite to you when we meetI canI am afraidsay absolutely nothing definite about my returnBut I will write to you in a few days and tell you more certainlyMeantimemuch lovemy dear girlI wish you were here with meBut on seeing how active the Germans areit is out of the question your crossing the North SeaI am looking forward to your next letterMuch loveYoursWBBurn Next letter of series will appear in July numberThe Reader Critic From James Joyce James JoyceZurichSwitzerlandI am very glad to hear about the new plans for The Little Review and that you have got together so many good writers as contributorsI hope to send you something very soon as soonin factas my health allows me to resume workI am much better howeverthough I am still under care of the doctorI wish The Little Review every successApproval Alice GroffPhiladelphiaNever has The Little Review pleased mefrom cover to coveras in the May numberI cannot imagine finding any one to express me for myselfbut MrEzra Pound in his editorial comes the nearest possible to doing thisas far as he goesWhat he says about the Christian religion is delicious in its gentle toleranceabout organized religionsis the last wordaboutthe formation of thought in clear speech for the use of humanity a religion in itselfHe utters my whole voice oncodes of proprietyin asserting thatthey have no place in the arts I would addnor in lifeother than as subject matter His rallying cry to The Egoist stirs my egoist soul to its depthEver since I have known this journal I have felt it to be the finestfreestfrankestbravest avenue of expression in English ever opened to the creative literary mindin all its variety of facultywithout having the least bias or prejudice as to any one varietyThat The Little Review should respond to this rallying cry would add a still deeper and stronger point to my already deep and strong interest in this brave little magazineFear Not MrsODJ I have great faith in the artistic life of America and I don t think Ezra Pound s notions of it are very healthyI sincerely hope the trend of it will not emulate thesmartor dissipated literature which seems to please London and which can hardly come under the head ofgood letters America must not necessarily be content with jejune flows of wordsReally the only half interesting articles that appeared in the May number were Eliot s and Pound s the former because it was about as good as The Smart Set and the latter on account of auld lang syneMy harshness is really flattering because it shows that I expect better things from theculturedEnglish We will take this opportunity of answering all those who have verbally or in letters expressed the fear that The Little Review will entirely change its nature and be influenced in the future by its Foreign EditorI do not want to be flippantbut indeed little faith is shown in us by all those who have known our struggle to be what we believeand our financial struggle to be at allFear notdear onesWe have learned to be penny wisewe will not be Pound foolishWe agree with Pound in the spiritif we don t always agree with him in the letter be sure we will mention itAnd Pound didn t slip up on us unawareA mutual misery over the situation brought us togetherAnd youdear MrsOD T what made you think that Ezra Pound and TSEliot wereculturedEnglishBecause geese are white and float upon water they are not necessarily swansPound too seems to have enough faith ingood lettersto spare a little for America and shareculturedEnglish with herHealthyThe unhealth is in the artistic life of Americaand whatever the ailmentbitter and acid medicine seems necessary to cure itAmerica must not be content for a great while with the stuff produced herejejune flows of words about popularizing arthome town poets and great American novelistsand never been abroad paintersThis seems to content it well enough nowBut I congratulate you on being able to read The Smart Set as literatureMaybe the audience will after all produce the artI wonder The Little Review A Poet s Opinion Maxwell BodenheimNew YorkEzra Pound writes in his editorial which headed your last number thatthe two novels by Joyce and Lewisand MrEliot s poemsare not only the most important contributions to English literature of the past three yearsbut are practically the only works of the time in which the creative element is presentwhich in any way show inventionor a progress beyond precedent work It is easy to make statements of this kindbuthaving made thema critic should tell us on what he bases his dictumThe trouble with criticism of arttodayis that it isn t criticismThe critic writes statements of untempered liking or dislikingand does not trouble to support them with detailed reasonsWe are simply supposed to take the critic s word for the matterI haven t sufficient belief in the infallibility of Ezra Pound s mind to require no substantion of his statements1 have several faults to find with his methods of criticising poetryHe s a bit too easily swayed by his personal emotionsin that regardI happen to know that in an article of hiswhich appeared in Poetrysome time ago he omitted the name of a very good modern American poetfrom theAmerican Teamhe was mentioningmerely because he has a personal dislike for that poetHe has alsotoo great a longing to separate poets into arbitrary teamsof best and worstPoets are either black or white to himnever greyIn speaking of Harriet Monroe he says that she has conducted her magazine in a spirited mannerconsidering the fact that she is faced with the practical problem of circulating a magazine in a certain peculiar milieuBut he does not add that those are not the colors in which Miss Monroeherselfcomes forthIf she admitted that she was a practical womantrying to print as much good poetry as she canand still gain readersthere would only be the question of whether one believed that compromise is always the only method of assuring the existence of a magazineBut she refuses to admit that she is a serious compromiserShe stands upon a pedestal of titter idealismMrPound did not mention this aspectHis claim that Eliot is the only really creative poet brought forth during recent times is absurdHD FletcherMarianne MooreWilliamsMichelson at his bestCarl Sandburgand Wallace Stevens are certainly not inevitably below Eliot in quality of workEliot s work is utterly originalattains moments of elicate satireand digs into the tangled inner dishonesties of menBut many of the poets I have mentioned are as good in their own way as Eliot is in hisin addition to their being just as original as heI have not MrPound s fondness for making listsso I m afraid I may have ommited the names of some American poets entitled to mentioneven from my own limited view pointBut I will say that at least the number of poets I have mentioned are fully the equals of MrPound s nominee for supreme honors TSEliot I get very tired of the talk about the establishment of two autocracies of opinionand the claim that since each is the opinion of a capable brain each has therefore the right to serious artistic considerationNow it is a fact that one particular kind of brain can put forward this claim and establish its legitimate autocracyIt is the brain that functions aesthetically rather than emotionallyMost artists haven t this kindTheir work drains their aesthetic reserve and they usually talk rot about artThere are thousands of examples such as Beethoven treasuring the worst poetry he could findThere are notable exceptionssuch as Leonardosuch as Gaudier BrzeskaEzra Pound seems to have this kind of brainI am not familiar with all his judgmentsbut those I have read have always been characterized by an aesthetic synthesis which means that he can rightly be called acritic To this kind of brain things are black and white which means good or bad of their kindIf by grey you mean that a poet is almost goodthen the critic will have to call him blackmeaning that he is a bad poetThere is no middle groundIf by grey you mean that he is a grey poet doing good grey workthen the critic will call him whitemeaning that he is a good poetMCA Complaint New York SubscribersWe have read the first installment of the much advertised London stuff and our comment is that unlessAnd andThe Reader Criticare restoredand at oncewe withdraw our moral and financial supportFor the Ancheologist That great journalThe New Republic I cannot say that great contemporary journalit is here with us in the fleshbut in the spirit it abides with the Biblethe Koranthe Books of Maroniand all great and ancient works of prophecytruth and revelation that great journalmentioning even the least of usspoke thus There was The Little Review which began in high spiritspublished some interesting experiments and a few achievementsand in the course of three years has sunk to pink covers with purple labels and an issue ecstatically dedicated to Mary GardenWhen these quaverings of senility reached us we were laid wasteand brought to silenceWe knew not whether Isaiah or Hosea or Mohamet had spokenBut now from the archives of The New Republic comes this fragment in the form of a rejection of some Chinese poetry Our expert on Chinese poetry does not think that these translations are etc We feel that we have come upon something of great interest to archeologists and to all our readers who are excited over the Mysteries of HistoryIs it possible that Li Po himself may be on the staff of The New Republicnow too old to create but still retained on its board of expertsThe Little Review Mary MacLane s Criticism Mary MacLaneButteMontanaAll your bits of criticism of my book are true but didn t I say them firstDon t I say I have a conscience Don t I say it s an exasperating book don t I say it s all incongruousDon t I tacitly tell you fifty times it is not

label me with thatsexual I wrote also of my shoesI contributed also the theory of Shoes DearI Mary Maclane All you have to say about mycriticismof your book sounds just to meYesyou said them first and fifty times at leastthat s why I mentioned them at allI thought perhaps the reason you said them so often was because you hoped it otherwisePerhaps you are toosubtle toosub analytic too educated for meI am just a painterWhile I knowfrom the aching of the heart to the sickness of the stomachwhat human days must includeI haven t yet got to the point where I am willing to believe that writing a book doesn t come under the same laws as painting a picturesculpingor making musicIf subject is not transformed into design by some inevitable quality in the artist then you have not made a bookyou have merely helped to clutter up the placeI may be narrow minded but I can t quite see any art as a common activity or a household dutyindulged in or performed as an either or I will clean off the snow or paint a pictureI will milk the cow or do a little modelling I haven t been about enough to have found it so in any familiesnor have I read enough to have found it so in many familiesexcept perhaps the Da Vinci family Refined is not my word you sayI think the book exonerates youbut why your concern with it at all was my pointnot my criticismAs to the labelsexual I meant shoes and allthe whole hereditary attitudein your case intriguing because neurasthenicSorrybut I did not solemnly take you to taskOne must even criticize with joyjh FromThe Dial A quaint manifestation of editorial ethics crops out in the April issue of The Little ReviewIt is in connection with a vers libre contestthis being the issue in which the awards are madeThere was a regularly constituted board of judges three people sufficiently competent and sufficiently well known in their fieldbut the editor has chosen to indulge in some disclosures as to the lack of unanimity amongst her aids and even in some pointed animadversions on their tastes and preferencesOf the first choice of one of themshe saysWhat is there in thesubtle depth of thought Almost every kind of person in the world has had this thoughtAnd what is there in the treatment to make it poetry And the poem itself followsOf the two chosen for prizes by another judgeshe observes These two poems are pretty awfuland she prints themwith the authorsnamesas beforeThe third judge plumped for a pair of othersprovided Richard Aldington wrote themotherwise notIf he wrote them they are authentic as well as lovelybut if he did notso flagrant an imitation ought not to be encouraged A perfectly sound position to takeHere again the poems followand they are under a name not Aldington sQueryhas the judgewhose name is given tooexactly made a friendThen comesof coursea succession of poems approved by the editor but ignored by her helpersIf such a system spreadsthe embarrassments and even perils of judgeship will growHereafter few may care to serve as judgesexcept under stipulations designed to afford some protectionAnd as for the poor poets themselvessuch treatment should act to keep them out ofcontestsaltogetherHere is the old Dial showing them all upSo there is an American editorial association just like the American Medical Association with all its crimonology of professional ethicsWe thought that the idea of that verse libre contestit wasn t our ideawas to stimulate interest in and more understanding of free versenot to offer an operation for judges nor a fee for poetsTaking it simply as a free verse contestthe editor thought the only concern was with free verseSince when has Art to do with ethics or with tasteIf the poets and judges in the contest were as impersonaldirectand sincere in their attitude toward poetry as the editorthe fussy anxiety of The Dial over their plight is needless But of course if to serve poetry is to serve yourself there isn t much point to a contest except the moneyOn the other handif a contest is to be run on thetastes and preferencesor sensitiveness of the judges then it is clear that the neatest poem chosen by the touchiest judge should winprovided the poet who wrote it was also easily offended and needed the money badly And as for the poor poetsthere should be something to keep them out of contests and also out of any other literary activityjh The Little Review You Do Us Too Much Honor Louis PuteklisCambridgeMass You see it is a fact that yourart for art s sakecannot exist without supportersnothing is free from economic conditions which are the creators and destroyers of people s tendencies and deedsAlthough I appreciate your surprising effortsI must confess that I cannot yet agree with your dictum as tothe two most important radical organs of contemporary literature Until you strike your roots deeper you cannot soar so highAs for meI am in touch already with many other radical magazines in English and in other languagesRadicalism does not consist in vers libre which murmurs about green grasssoft kissesclinging limbsecstasy and faintnessthe surprises of passionate intercourseThere is too much of such senuapoetrySolomon long ago played the changes on that themeSuch poems come perilously near the emanations of diseased sexual appetitesThere is neither life nor originality in themWhen I readgreen grass I know that I am close uponclinging limbs Drink
