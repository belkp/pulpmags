Sept 30th 19I7 and although the endowment has been partly resub scribed for another period this Fund is insufficient and expenses are constantly increasing The art of poetry requires if it is to advance not only special sympathy from a discriminating public but also endowment similar to that readily granted to the other arts All who believe in the general purpose and policy of this magazine and recognize the need and value of such an organ of the art are invited to assist thus in maintaining it    VOL XI No II  NOVEMBER 1917  THE FOUR BROTHERS  Notes for War Songs  AKE war songs out of these Make chants that repeat and weave Make rhythms up to the ragtime chatter of the machine guns Make slow booming psalms up to the boom of the big guns Make a marching song of swinging arms and swinging legs Going along Going along On the roads from San Antonio to Athens from Seattle to Bagdad The boys and men in winding lines of khaki the circling squares of bayonet points  Cowpunchers Cornhuskers shopmen ready in khaki Ballplayers lumberjacks ironworkers ready in khaki   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A million ten million singing I am ready This the sun looks on between two seaboards In the land of Lincoln in the land of Grant and Lee  I heard one say I am ready to be killed I heard another say I am ready to be killed O sunburned clear eyed boys I stand on sidewalks and you go by with drums and guns  and bugles You and the flag And my heart tightens a fist of something feels my throat When you go by You on the kaiser hunt you and your faces saying I am ready to be killed  They are hunting death Death for the one armed mastoid kaiser They are after a Hohenzollern head There is no man hunt of men remembered like this  The four big brothers are out to kill France Russia Britain America The four republics are sworn brothers to kill the kaiser   Yes this is the great man hunt And the sun has never seen till now Such a line of toothed and tusked man killers In the blue of the upper sky   Carl Sandburg  In the green of the undersea In the red of winter dawns Eating to kill Sleeping to kill Asked by their mothers to kill Wished by four fifths of the world to kill To cut the kaiser s throat To hack the kaiser s head To hang the kaiser on a high horizon gibbet  And is it nothing else than this Three times ten million men thirsting the blood Of a half cracked one armed child of the German kings Three times ten million men asking the blood Of a child born with his head wrong shaped The blood of rotted kings in his veins If this were all O God I would go to the far timbers And look on the grey wolves Tearing the throats of moose I would ask a wilder drunk of blood  Look It is four brothers in joined hands together The people of bleeding France The people of bleeding Russia The people of Britain the people of America  These are the four brothers these are the four republics   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  At first I said it in anger as one who clenches his fist in wrath to fling his knuckles into the face of someone taunting  Now I say it calmly as one who has thought it over and over again at night among the mountains by the sea combers in storm  I say now by God only fighters today will save the world nothing but fighters will keep alive the names of those who left red prints of bleeding feet at Valley Forge in Christmas snow  On the cross of Jesus the sword of Napoleon the skull of Shakespere the pen of Tom Jefferson the ashes of Abraham Lincoln or any sign of the red and running life poured out by the mothers of the world  By the God of morning glories climbing blue the doors of quiet homes by the God of tall hollyhocks laughing glad to children in peaceful valleys by the God of new mothers wishing peace to sit at windows nursing babies  I swear only reckless men ready to throw away their lives by hunger deprivation desperate clinging to a single purpose imperturbable and undaunted men with the primitive guts of rebellion  Only fighters gaunt with the red brand of labor s sorrow on their brows and labor s terrible pride in their blood men with souls asking danger only these will save and keep the four big brothers   Carl Sandburg  Good night is the word good night to the kings to the  czars  Good night to the kaiser The breakdown and the fade away begins The shadow of a great broom ready to sweep out the trash  is here  One finger is raised that counts the czar The ghost who beckoned men who come no more The czar gone to the winds on God s great dustpan  The czar a pinch of nothing The last of the gibbering Romanoffs  Out and good night The ghosts of the summer palaces And the ghosts of the winter palaces Out and out good night to the kings the czars the kaisers  Another finger will speak And the kaiser the ghost who gestures a hundred million  sleeping waking ghosts The kaiser will go onto God s great dustpan The last of the gibbering Hohenzollerns Look God pities this trash God waits with a broom and  a dustpan God knows a finger will speak and count them out  It is written in the stars It is spoken on the walls   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It clicks in the fire white zigzag of the Atlantic wireless It mutters in the bastions of thousand mile continents It sings in a whistle on the midnight winds from Walla  Walla to Mesopotamia Out and good night  The millions slow in khaki The millions learning Turkey in the Straw and John Brown s Body  The millions remembering windrows of dead at Gettysburg  Chickamauga and Spottsylvania Court House The millions dreaming of the morningstar of Appomattox The millions easy and calm with guns and steel planes and  prows There is a hammering drumming hell to come The killing gangs are on the way  God takes one year for a job God takes ten years or a million God knows when a doom is written God knows this job will be done and the words spoken Out and good night  The red tubes will run And the great price be paid And the homes empty And the wives wishing And the mothers wishing  There is only one way now only the way of the red tubes and the great price Carl Sandburg  Well Maybe the morning sun is a five cent yellow balloon And the evening stars the joke of a God gone crazy Maybe the mothers of the world And the life that pours from their torsal folds Maybe it s all a lie sworn by liars And a God with a cackling laughter says I the Almighty God I have made all this I have made it for kaisers czars and kings  Three times ten million men say No Three times ten million men say God is a God of the People  And the God who made the world And fixed the morning sun And flung the evening stars And shaped the baby hands of life  This is the God of the Four Brothers This is the God of bleeding France and bleeding Russia This is the God of the people of Britain and America  The graves from the Irish Sea to the Caucasus peaks are ten times a million The stubs and stumps of arms and legs the eyesockets empty the cripples ten times a million The crimson thumb print of this anathema is on the door panels of a hundred million homes   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Cows gone mothers on sick beds children cry a hunger and no milk comes in the noon time or at night  The death yells of it all the torn throats of men in ditches calling for water the shadows and the hacking lungs in dugouts the steel paws that clutch and squeeze a scarlet drain day by day the storm of it is hell  But look child the storm is blowing for a clean air  Look the four brothers march And hurl their big shoulders And swear the job shall be done  Out of the wild finger writing north and south east and  west over the blood crossed blood dusty ball of earth Out of it all a God who knows is sweeping clean Out of it all a God who sees and pierces through is break  ing and cleaning out an old thousand years is making ready for a new thousand years The four brothers shall be five and more  Under the chimneys of the winter time the children of the world shall sing new songs Among the rocking restless cradles the mothers of the world shall sing new sleepy time songs  Carl Sandburg   TWO SONNETS  I COME SINGING  Youth Answers the Call  Not with the fear or the hot swift fever of war But with the calm sure courage of the right I come singing of youth s far visioned sight The dreams of youth so well worth dying for  Not with the dread of one who finds no more Than the guns rumble and the bloody fight And ruin and the long sleep under the night Adventure lures me like an open door  I come as one who has found glorious waking And goes supremely girded to the foe Knowing my songs have power to lay him low I come as one upon whose lips are breaking Snatches of melodies beyond unmaking And in whose soul unalterable rhythms flow  AFTERWARDS  To M E S  I fancy that perhaps you think of me At times when the curtain of dusk has fallen low And dim strange ghosts of daylight come and go Gold footed where the shadows leap and flee And I fancy that perhaps a memory   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Lingers of silent moments we dared not know Of words said softly laughter sudden and slow And tokens and signs and symbols we dared not see  picture you alone in your dark room Curled in a deep chair quiet and lost in thought Pondering curious riddles in the gloom Of one who came and something that he brought Of one who worked and something that he wrought Of one who searched and something that he sought  H Thompson Rich  RECIPROCITY  I do not think that skies and meadows are Moral or that the fixture of a star Comes of a quiet spirit or that trees Have wisdom in their windless silences Yet these are things invested in my mood With constancy and peace and fortitude That in my troubled season I can cry Upon the wide composure of the sky And envy fields and wish that I might be As little daunted as a star or tree  John Drinkwater   NOVEMBER  Where like ghosts of verdant days Whispering down Leaves in the November haze Drift and drown  Stand two lovers motionless And apart In their sturdy nakedness Of the heart  Two dark figures side by side In the mist Standing as though time had died Since they kissed  Whose deep roots alive and sound Blindly reach Mingling in the fertile ground Each with each  Pray that we when gaunt and old Like bare trees Through our common earth may hold Close like these  Marjorie Allen Seiffert   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ON THE BEACH AT FONTANA  Wind whines and whines the shingle The crazy pier stakes groan A senile sea numbers each single Slime silvered stone  From whining wind and colder Grey sea I wrap him warm And touch his fine boned boyish shoulder And trembling arm  Around us fear descending Darkness of fear above  And in my heart how sweet unending Ache of love  ALONE  The moon s soft golden meshes make All night a veil The shore lamps in the sleeping lake Laburnum tendrils trail  The sly reeds whisper in the night  A name her name  And all my soul is a delight  A swoon of shame   James Joyce  SHE WEEPS OVER RAHOON  Rain on Rahoon falls softly softly falling Where my dark lover lies Sad is his voice that calls me sadly calling At grey moonrise  Love hear thou How desolate the heart is ever calling Ever unanswered and the dark rain falling Then as now  Dark too our hearts O love shall lie and cold As his sad heart has lain Under the moon grey nettles the black mould And muttering rain  James Joyce  A POET S EPITAPH  When comes the last long silence to this lute And by its plea no more the calm is broken In charity O world let it be spoken No human sorrow found this player mute  John Black   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  BAREFOOT SANDALS  Ah little barefoot sandals brown and still Do you long to be a roaming on the hill Flashing down the garden way Fellows with the winds at play  Are you weary waiting wingless silent chill  When the morning mounts and makes the old earth sweet  With the lilt of laughing children in the street Do you ache to join them there To be twinkling down the stair  To the darling dancing gladness of her feet  Do you know the asters troop in purple gloom  Too late to greet the love that bade them bloom That they wonder watch and wait At the quiet garden gate  While you weary in the lonely upper room  Ah hapless little shoes that held my all  My joy of life within your trappings small Where s the lithe and lovely thing That each morning lent you wing  Are you weary waiting wingless for her call  Mary White Slater LAVENDER  The twilight hangs like smoke in the streets Pearly veiling all the stretches in illusion And the new lit lamps are the glow of hearts That grope unseeing and unseen  At the corner a lean young girl offers me lavender Offers me youth and romance to hold in my palm closed thus  She gives dreams to the world She who knows nought of dreams Gives gardens and waters and the young shy moon Hung in the laurels Gives the smoke of evening in the willows And the complaining stream And the lavender s subtle reawakening of old dead thoughts  These all these she gives this lean girl A shawl is over her head and her eyes look into the dark  ness What does she know of dreams How more happy is she than I who have dreamed And may dream no more  Archie Austin Coates   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  MOODS AND MOMENTS  CHILD EYES  Bits of us Peering out From child eyes What more is immortality  FREEDOM  Free am I As a summer cloud But I resent The insistent urge Of the wind  HUMAN CHORDS  He drew life From the strings He gave life To the strings As feeling draws life from words Gives life to words A fragment of life Died away with each strain But something it awakened Endures   ENSLAVED  With his millions Came gold handcuffs Wrought by millions While he slept And when he awakened  He felt them bind  And the crowd  Envied His golden bracelets  THE PEASANTS  They may in their hearts Ask Why  But their faces are  Stolid and silent  Buffaloes Facing with lowered heads The blizzards Of the plains  THE BEACH  The chill clung to the water A bevy of boys In naked beauty Venturesome   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Shivering Shy with wonderment Huddled into themselves Like street sparrows On snowy mornings  REACHES OF THE DESERT  The way is empty As far as the eye can see But the wish of my heart Lights a moonpath Across the reaches of the desert To your adobe doorway And my heart feels The shelter Of your yearning  THE ASCENT  With following the paths that ascend 1 have lost the sense of my dwarfish stature Lost the sense of the city s bigness As it dwindles to mosaics Lost the sense of the teeming streets As they dwindle into threads Lost the sense of the cultivated foothills As they dwindle into a faded quilt With following the paths that ascend  David O Neil   MY NICARAGUA  You take the street on which the large church fronts And go some twenty blocks and up a hill And past the three arch bridge until you come To Guadalupe where the houses are No stately Spanish buildings flat and lazy As in the center of the town you see them Heavy with some three centuries upon them Accustomed to the sunlight and the earthquakes To sudden dawns long days and sudden sunsets Half bored you fancy by these ways of nature But little things ugly almost and frail With low red roofs and flimsy rough cut doors A trifle better than an Indian hut Not picturesque just dreary commonplace As commonplace and dreary as the flats Here in your cities where your poor folks live And yet you notice glad the sun is shining And glad a cooling wind begins to blow Too glad too purely humbly glad to say it And all the while afraid of the volcanoes Holding their breath lest these should wake to crush them Look through these doors and see the walls inside With holy pictures saints and angels there Sold to my people reverenced by them Look through these doors and see the children playing Or wrangling just as children will elsewhere Look through these doors and see the women sewing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Setting their tables doing the thousand things Hardly worth noticing that women do Around their houses meaning life to them And if you listen you may hear them singing Not anywhere are better songs than theirs It s nothing thrilling Tourists do not care And if you hire a common guide he ll never Think of directing you to see this mere Unhonored dailiness of people s lives That is the soil the roots of beauty know  Yet if you wish to know my country it s there  The old Cathedral that the Spaniards built With hand carved altars for two thousand saints The ruined fortress where they say that Nelson Who was a pirate then lost his left eye Fighting a woman all that tourists see That s what my country used to be not now The dear hotel with palm trees in the courtyard And a self playing piano drumming rags The shops of German English and French owners The parlors of the ruling class adorned With much the same bad taste as in New York That s not my country either But the rows Of ugly little houses where men dwell And women all too busy living life To think of faking it that is my country My Nicaragua mother of great poets   Salomón de la Selva  And when you see that what Just this Despite Newspaper revolutions and so forth The different climate and the different Traditions and the different grandfathers My people are pretty much the same as yours Folks with their worries and their hopes about them Working for bread and for a something more That ever changes hardly twice the same Happy and sad the very joy and sorrow Your people feel at heart just plainly human And that is worth the journey to find out  TW O SPANISH FOLK SONGS  THE TINY MAIDEN  I am so little They say She s so young I can t bear it mother So I sing this song  Girls of fourteen Little babies bear I am almost twenty For this I despair  I am so little They say She s so young   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I can t bear it mother So I sing this song  My breasts are ripe And I am of age God grant me for lover The king s little page  THE MERCHANT  Little ants in a double row  One for coming and one for going  Do you know what the market s doing  No but the way the wind is blowing  Little ants in a double row An you never heard of market things  Never a whit nor a two pence worth  For when it s the rain then we grow wings  And take them off to be ants again  When the cricket sings  Little ants in a double row  I am tired of buying and selling  I wish I were an ant like you  Brother there is no telling Salomón de la Selva   THE DEAD PECOS TOWN  Above the steep arroyo of russet running straight with rose The Pecos pueblo sleeps A mound of dust timbered with bones Three silver yuccas flower on the grave For headstone cut by frost and all its edges shriveled by  the desert heat A mission leans against the wide still sky I too am watching with time Where I stand the crusted gravel cracks And ghosts of seven centuries are stirred Shards of painted pots lie like mosaic on a shattered floor A frost white shin bone rattles down the slope Strikes a fellow and finds the plain Jaws are set and dead mouths smile Bones of martyrs pioneers Feet that once were dancing lie with rain gods And thin broken spears  Kate Buss   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NEW MEXICO SONGS  After the roar after the fierce modern music Of rivets and hammers and trams After the shout of the giant Youthful and brawling and strong Building the cities of men Here is the desert of silence Blinking and blind in the sun An old old woman who mumbles her beads And crumbles to stone  LOS CONQUISTADORES  What hills what hills my old true love Old Song  What hills are these against the sky What hills so far and cold These are the hills we have come to find Seeking the yellow gold  What hills what hills so dark and still What hills so brown and dry These are the hills of this desert land Where you and I must die  Oh far away is gay Seville And far are the hills of home   Alice Corbin  And far are the plains of old Castile  Beneath the blue sky s dome  The bells will ring in fair Seville And folk go up and down And no one know where our bones are laid In this desert old and brown  What hills what hills so dark and cold What hills against the sky These are the last hills you shall see Before you turn to die  THREE MEN ENTERED THE DESERT ALONE  Three men entered the desert alone But one of them slept like a sack of stone  As the wagon toiled and plodded along  And one of them sang a drinking song He had heard at the bar of The Little Cyclone  Then he too fell asleep at last  While the third one felt his soul grow vast  As the circle of sand and alkali His soul extended and touched the sky His old life dropped as a dream that is past   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  As the sand slipped off from the wagon wheel The shining sand from the band of steel While the far horizon widened and grew Into something he dimly felt he knew And had always known that had just come true  His vision rested on ridges of sand And a far off horseman who seemed to stand On the edge of the world in an orange glow Rising to rose and a lavender tone With an early star in a turquoise band  And his spirit sang like a taper slim As the slow wheels turned on the desert s rim Through the wind swept stretches of sand and sky He had entered the desert to hide and fly But the spell of the desert had entered him  Three men entered the desert alone One of them slept like a sack of stone One of them reached till he touched the sky The other one dreamed while the hours went by Of a girl at the bar of The Little Cyclone   Alice Corbin  OLD TIMER  His legs were bowed in leather chaps His hair was sun bleached brown No barber s hand had touched his beard Since he was last in town  Beneath his high sombrero s brim His gait was wide and free He walked as if he rode the range He hardly seemed to see  The shops or windows of the street But passed as if he dreamed His pale blue eyes were desert dimmed His face was desert seamed  He had an air of open space About him as he walked He was a priest of mystery Because he never talked  He ate in silence the café Was hushed about his chair He brought the mountains to the town The mesas blinding glare  He brought siestas of high noon Sierras bleak and lone   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Where sunlight builds on sunlit hills A sun bronzed overtone  He brought the breath of all outdoors Close shut within himself He kept his wisdom all inside I only guessed his wealth  PEDRO MONTOYA OF ARROYO HONDO  Pedro Montoya of Arroyo Hondo Comes each day with his load of wood Piled on two burros backs driving them down Over the mesa to Santa Fé town  He comes around by Arroyo Chamisa A small grey figure as grey as his burros Down from the mountains with cedar and pine Girt about each of the burros with twine  As patient as they are he waits in the plaza For someone who comes with an eye out for wood Then Pedro wakes up like a bantam at dawn Si Señor si Señor his wood is gone  Pedro Montoya of Arroyo Hondo Rides back on one burro and drives the other   Alice Corbin  With a sack of blue corn meal tobacco and meat A bit to smoke and a bit to eat  Pedro Montoya of Arroyo Hondo If I envied any I d envy him With a burro to ride and a burro to drive There is hardly a man so rich alive  IN THE SIERRAS  Do not bring me riches From your store in the Andes Do not bring me treasures From deep ocean caves Bring me but yourself And I ll gladly go with you Bring me but yourself And I will not be sorry  Do not bring me patterns Of silks or of satins Do not bring me silver Or gold wrung from slaves Bring me but yourself And my heart will rest easy And your head will be light With my breast as its pillow   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Do not bring me servants Or oxen or cattle Or sheep for the shearing Or ships from the waves Bring me but yourself For my share and my treasure Then our fortune will grow And will never diminish  A SONG FROM OLD SPAIN  What song of mine will live  On whose lips will the words be sung  Long years after I am forgotten  A name blown between the hills  Where some goat herd  Remembers my love and passion  He will sing of your beauty and my love  Though it may be in another tongue  To a strange tune  In a country beyond the seas  A seed blown by the wind He will sing of our love and passion  Alice Corbin   COMMENT  A WORD TO THE CARPING CRITIC  IN examining the editorial conscience as I have been forced to do of late in order to decide whether POETRY ought to continue to serve the art at the expense of its guarantors I have been brought face to face with modern immensities Of old indeed not so long ago each artist each poet worked for a little group in a little city his appeal was direct and immediate Now each artist exhibits his work from Rome to San Francisco and each poet in English at least throws his voice to the ends of the earth  This sounds inspiring but that is not the effect In this case one bird in the hand is worth a whole bushful overseas The far flung audience is too remote and distracted art becomes irrelevant as a writer in the New Republic Mr George Soule said some time ago The relation betwen artist and audience which should be intimate becomes strained to a hair or snaps altogether The artist wearies of speaking into a vacuum and the audience wearies of art s egoistic demands begins to think art a luxury a mere ornament which may be accepted or dispensed with at will Art tends to become not a necessity of joyous and rational and expressive life but merely one among too many demands As Mr Soule says  Too much of the best has been written in too many languages If one has to spend a life in study before one can recognize an authentic poem true recognition will vanish Art to keep vital must be related to the community How is it to   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  be at the same time derived out of the complex and over burdened modern consciousness and made natural to a community without the ability to specialize in it  Mr Soule and other casual complainants present the problem but discourage efforts at solution In fact the tenor of their criticism suggests that there is no solution that modern art losing thus the immediate response the immediate relation with life lacks power to survive This may possibly be true today is too early to assert or deny it though most of us think that certain modern achievements will prove a denial of it when the next age sits in judgment on our own  But the point I wish to make is that such a mental attitude is sterile no modern artist with fighting blood in his veins can accept it any more than a soldier can accept the finality of the enemy s numerous and powerful guns And the critical writer who accepts it who does not see the invitation that difficulty offers to a powerful and adventurous mind ranges himself with the enemy instead of against him  Among the modern efforts at art presentation which Mr Soule deprecates are the little reviews and the numerous magazines of verse into which he looked some years ago for the signs of greater vitality in our own literature and art In pronouncing them with a few exceptions precarious and unproductive it never occurs to him to suspect the selective authority of his own mind and as his attitude represents fairly the suspicion and inhospitality toward modern poetry of a large and highly educated and influential class it must not pass without a protest   A Word to the Carping Critic  What would Mr Soule do with these desperate conditions which in his opinion confront our poets and artists Would he close the current exhibitions and stop the special magazines If not the tone of his article belies him for it nowhere admits that these are the artist s only means of being seen or heard and should therefore at all hazards be encouraged He never offers the modern poet a fighting chance against the formidable immensities which threaten him but implies on the contrary that so slight a chance is hardly worth offering  It is a strange fact that this type of critical mind has learned to take the current exhibitions of painting and sculpture highly endowed and beprized as a matter of course while it still shrugs its shoulders at their exact parallel the magazines which exhibit current poetry and which are of course more or less precarious so long as they have no permanent endowment Why do the critics and the public give the painter and sculptor this great advantage over their brother artist the poet unless their minds follow naturally the institutional trend and find values only where they have been long emphatically asserted in stone and mortar and constantly re emphasized with cash  The magazines of verse which have sprung up in dozens during the past five years are not yet so numerous nor so rich as the current exhibitions in our various cities which give annual prizes of from three hundred to two thousand dollars but their aim is identical with these to give the poet a fair start his chance at the public to exhibit the best work   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  now being produced and thereby to lead to the production of better work I think I speak for the other special magazines as well as for POETRY in thus stating the common object No more than the current exhibitions can they pretend to offer numerous masterpieces if they show one now and then they and the public as well are fortunate But just as Mr Soule may find among hundreds of negligible pictures and statues in the current exhibitions a few which will be permanently treasured as worthy of the great age we live in so in the files of these precarious and unproductive magazines of verse he will find the first appearances of poets afterwards distinguished and also if he is discerning enough poems which will be cherished by coming ages as worthy of and representative of our own  At any rate I would plead for a more generous and adventurous hospitality among critical minds and critical journals toward the effort which we are making to win for the art and the poets more public respect and recognition something of the attention and favor so freely granted to the other arts Any cause in these crowded days needs its special place and organ a strongly concentrated effort by those who love it and one may almost say that every one of the few special magazines represents a sacrificial effort of this kind There may be some better way of making room for the poet and gathering his audience in this enormous and preoccupied modern world but as yet no one has found it nor provided the subsidy which its discovery would entail H M   Irony Laforgue and Some Satire  IRONY LAFORGUE AND SOME SATIRE  As Lewis has written Matter which has not intelligence enough to permeate it grows as you know gangrenous and rotten to prevent quibble let us say animal matter Criticism is the fruit of maturity flair is a faculty of the rarest In most countries the only people who know enough of literature to appreciate i e to determine the value of new productions are professors and students who confine their attention to the old It is the mark of the artist that he and he almost alone is indifferent to oldness or newness Stale ness he will not abide jade may be ancient flowers should be reasonably fresh but mutton cooked the week before last is for the most part unpalatable  The unripe critic is constantly falling into such pitfalls Originality when it is most actual is often sheer lineage is often a closeness of grain The innovator most damned for eccentricity is often most centrally in the track or orbit of tradition and his detractors are merely ignorant The artist is in sane equilibrium indifferent utterly to oldness or newness so the thing be apposite to his want  The scholar often selfish will as a rule have little to do with contemporary letters He plays it safe He confines himself to what many have already approved The journalist is left as our jury He is often an excellent fellow and in that case a scoffer at his chosen or enforced position He says It is this that makes banderlog of us all I quote his phrase quite correctly he was speaking of journalists He talked intelligently on many other matters and he did   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  not look in the least like banderlog He looked in fact rather like the frontispiece to my edition of Leopardi Within three weeks as many journalists all successful and one of them at least at the top of the tree have all said the same thing to me in slightly varying words The journalist and his papers exist by reason of their protective coloring It is their job to think as their readers think at a given moment  It is impossible that Jules Laforgue should have written his poems in America in the eighties He was born in 1860 died in 1887 of la misère of consumption and abject poverty in Paris The vaunted sensitiveness of French perception and the fact that he knew a reasonable number of wealthy and influential people did nothing to prevent this He had published two small volumes one edition of each The seventh edition of his collected poems is dated 1913 and doubtless they have been reprinted since then with increasing celerity  He is perhaps the most sophisticated of all the French poets so it is not to be supposed that any wide public has welcomed or will welcome him in England or America The seven hundred people in both those countries who have read him with exquisite pleasure will arise to combat this estimate but no matter His name is as well known as Mallarmé s his writings perhaps are as widely distributed The anthology of Van Bever and Leataud has gone into I suppose its fiftieth thousand  Un couchant des Cosmogonies Ah que la Vie est quotidienne    Irony Laforgue and Some Satire  Et du plus vrai qu on se souvienne  Comme on fut piètre et sans génie   What in heaven s name is the man in the street to make  of this or of the Complainte des Bons Ménages  L Art sans poitrine m a trop longtemps bercé dupe  Si ses labours sont fiers que ses blés décevants  Tiens laisse moi bêler tout aux plis de ta jupe  Qui fleure le couvent  The red blood has turned away like the soldier in one of Plato s dialogues Delicate irony the citadel of the intelligent has a curious effect on these people They wish always to be exhorted at all times no matter how incongruous and unsuitable to do those things which almost anyone will and does do whenever suitable opportunity is presented As Henry James has said It was a period when writers besought the deep blue sea to roll  The ironist is one who suggests that the reader should think and this process being unnatural to the majority of mankind the way of the ironical is beset with snares and with furze bushes  Laforgue was a purge and a critic He laughed out the errors of Flaubert i e the clogging and cumbrous historical detail He left Coeur Simple L Education Madame Bovary Bouvard His Laforgue s Salome makes game of the rest The short story has become vapid because sixty thousand story writers have all set themselves to imitating De Maupassant perhaps a thousand from the original  think Laforgue implies definitely that certain things in prose were at an end I think also that he marks the next phase after Gautier in French poetry It seems to me that   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  without a familiarity with Laforgue one can not appreciate  i e determine the value of certain positives and certain negatives in French poetry since 1890  He is an incomparable artist He is nine tenths of him critic dealing for the most part with literary poses and clichés taking them as his subject matter and and this is the important thing when we think of him as a poet he makes them a vehicle for the expression of his own very personal emotions of his own unperturbed sincerity  Je ne suis pas ce gaillard là ni Le Superbe Mais mon âme qu un cri un peu cru exacerbe Est au fond distinguée et franche comme une herbe  This is not the strident and satiric voice of Corbière calling Hugo Garde Nationale épique and Lamartine Lacrimatoire des abonnés It is not Tailhade drawing with rough strokes the people he sees daily in Paris and bursting with guffaws over the Japanese in their mackintoshes the West Indian mulatto behind the bar in the Quartier It is not Georges Fourest burlesquing in a café Fourest s guffaw is magnificent he is hardly satirical Tailhade draws from life and indulges in occasional squabbles Corbière is hardbitten perhaps the most poignant poet since Villon in very much Villon s manner  Laforgue was a better artist than any of these men save Corbière He was not in the least of their sort Corbière lived from 1842 to 1875 Tailhade was born in 1854 and is still living During the eighties he seems to have been writing Swinburnian verse and his satires Au Pays du Mufle now part of Poèmes Aristophanesques appeared in   Irony Laforgue and Some Satire  1891 Corbière s poems first printed in 1873 were hardly obtainable until the reprint of 1891 Thus so far as the public is concerned these poets are almost contemporary with each other  They reached England in the nineties Beardsley s Under the Hill was until recently the only successful attempt to produce anything like Laforgue in our tongue Under the Hill was issued in a limited edition Laforgue s Moralités Légendaires was issued in England by the Rick etts and Hacon press in a limited edition and there the thing has remained Laforgue can never become a popular cult because tyros can not imitate him Recent translations of his prose are held up because of copyright laws  I do not think one can too carefully discriminate between Laforgue s tone and that of his contemporary French satirists He is the finest wrought he is most verbalist Bad verbalism is rhetoric or the use of cliché unconsciously or a mere playing with phrases But there is good verbalism distinct from lyricism or imagism and in this Laforgue is a master He writes not the popular language of any country but an international tongue common to the excessively cultivated and to those more or less familiar with French literature of the first three fourths of the nineteenth century  He has done sketchily and brilliantly for French literature a work not incomparable to what Flaubert was doing for France in Bouvard and Pécuchet if one may compare the flight of the butterfly with the progress of an ox both  proceeding toward the same point of the compass He has dipped his wings in the dye of scientific terminology Pierrot    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  imberbe has  Un air d hydrocephale asperge The tyro can not play about with such things the game is too dangerous Verbalism demands a set form used with irreproachable skill Satire needs usually the form of cutting rhymes to drive it home  Chautauquas Mrs Eddys Dr Dowies Comstocks societies for the prevention of all human activities are impossible in the wake of Laforgue And he is therefore an exquisite poet a deliverer of the nations a Numa Pompilius a father of light And to the crowd this mystery the mystery why such force should reside in so fragile a book why such power should coincide with so great a nonchalance of manner will remain forever a mystery  Que loin l âme type Qui m a dit adieu Parce que mes yeux Manquaient de principes  Elle en ce moment Elle si pain tendre Oh peut être engendre Quelque garnement  Car on l a unie Avec un monsieur Ce qu il y a de mieux Mais pauvre en génie  Laforgue is perhaps incontrovertible John B Yeats has written of the relation of art and certitude and we are perhaps too prone to connect certitude only with the strong silent man of the kinema There are however various species Ezra Pound   REVIEWS  WILLIAM H DAVIES POET  Collected Poems by William H Davies Fifield London and Alfred T Knopf New York William H Davies writes in a curious traditional dialect  that is to say in a language that is more or less the tongue of Burns and Blake and the Elizabethans he puts his words hind side to as the ancient writers were wont and he says did go and did sing and so forth Sero te amavi etc Also Mr Shaw once introduced him as a curiosity and all these things put one off Having found out this much one has also found about as much fault as one can find with Mr Davies or at least all the fault that he would not find with himself  I do not know that I can submit Mr Davies work to my usual acid test Those who have caught my habit must put it aside for a time Here is Sweet Youth  And art thou gone sweet Youth Say nay For dost thou know what power was thine That thou could st give vain shadows flesh And laughter without any wine From the heart fresh  And art thou gone sweet Youth Say nay Not left me to Time s cruel spite He ll pull my teeth out one by one He ll paint my hair first gray then white He ll scrape my bone  And art thou gone sweet Youth Alas For ever gone I know it well Earth has no atom nor the sky   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  That has not thrown the Kiss Farewell Sweet Youth good bye  Now I suppose that lyric is not quite Elizabethan in fact I am sure that it is not Lyric it certainly is  I wonder what further concession we must make Certainly Davies uses his verse as a vehicle for a philosophy as well as for communicating his mood Certainly he does talk about things quite as often as he presents them possibly more often still he does now and again present men or things without comment as for example a drunk who has done time Watching school house after school house in the hope of finding his children  And Balmy Tom is near as bad A drinlcing ale till blind No absent child grieves he but there s A dead love on his mind The poem is possibly sentimental There are flaws in its technique But you know it s only about one thing in thirty I do that s any good is the author s own summary criticism of his poems so we may as well take the good with the flawed for a moment Poet Davies is without any doubt if one will but read enough of him for conviction Despite the ancient speech the speech that is at least as old as Tom Moore there is here and there the fine phrase and the still finer simplicity The last line of the above four for example I think I had better quote one poem which makes it necessary to accept Davies as a poet after which we can at our leisure decide which verses we are going to hold as good Davies The poem is A Lovely Woman   William H Davies Poet  Now I can see what Helen was Men can not see this woman pass And not be stirred as summer s breeze Sets leaves in battle on the trees A woman moving gracefully With golden hair enough for three Which mercifully is not loose But lies in coils to her head close With lovely eyes so dark and blue So deep so warm they burn me through I see men follow her as though Their homes were where her steps should go She seemed as sent to our cold race For fear the beauty of her face Made Paradise in flames like Troy  I could have gazed all day with joy In fancy I could see her stand Before a savage fighting band And make them with her words and looks Exchange their spears for shepherd s crooks And sing to sheep in quiet nooks In fancy saw her beauty make A thousand gentle priests uptake Arms for her sake and shed men s blood The fairest piece of womanhood Lovely in feature form and grace I ever saw in any place  Frankly I do not think that most of Davies poems are so good as the two just quoted Yet sometimes he uses the classic English manner to perfection In Dreams of the  Sea for example are lines and strophes which I think we  would accept without quaver or question if we found them in  volumes of accepted great poets  And I have seen thy gentle breeze as soft As summer s when it makes the cornfields run And I have seen thy rude and lusty gale Make ships show half their bellies to the sun   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Thou knowest the way to tame the wildest life Thou knowest the way to bend the great and proud I think of that Armada whose puffed sails Greedy and large came swallowing every cloud  But I have seen the sea boy young and drowned Lying on shore and by thy cruel hand A seaweed beard was on his tender chin His heaven blue eyes were filled with common sand  And yet for all I yearn for thee again To sail once more upon thy fickle flood I ll hear thy waves wash under my death bed Thy salt is lodged forever in my blood  Robustezza This verse is not in the latest mode but compare it with verse oí its own kind and you will not find much to surpass it Wordsworth for instance would have had a deal of trouble trying to better it The sound quality is again nearer that of the Elizabethans than of the nineteenth century writers The philologist will find scarcely a Latin word in the foregoing verses Armada is a proper name and gentle is so tempered by mediaeval French popular usage that one forgets its Latin derivation I do not wish the reader to imply from this that the use of Latin words in English is taboo Simply certain effects are very often due to the omission of Latin words from the verse  There is a resonance and a body of sound in these verses of Davies which I think many vers librists might envy  I am by no means attempting a full examination of Davies in this brief annotation I think I have however quoted enough of him to show that he should be considered at least as much for his verses as for his better known prose Autobiography of a Super Tramp Ezra Pound   A Modern Solitary  A MODERN SOLITARY  Ideal Passion Sonnets by George Edward Woodberry Printed for the Woodberry Society George Edward Woodberry a study of his Poetry by Louis  V Ledoux Poetry Review Co Cambridge  Mr Woodberry s sonnet sequence has the frail beauty of perfumed summer days days spent in an old garden out of range of the winds of the world The garden is formally patterned but softly overgrown a sweet refuge for a sensitive solitary soul In its paths beside its mossy marble finials a poet may live in the spirit and be indulgent of dream He may see the light that never was and celebrate a mystic marriage with a lady too fine and fair for flesh and then dreaming himself into etherealized passion he may weave a fabric of poesy in her praise  Indeed the suggestion of the book is monastic The poet took the vows early and his life has been expurgated of all common things He is monkish in both his distaste for the world and his rapture of spiritual emotion Mrs Henderson four years ago in POETRY characterized one of Mr Woodberry s poems as the tragic experience of a conventional soul facing unconventionality life But the attempt was not only tragic but abortive Mr Woodberry has never really faced life he could not And the present poem recording a frank withdrawal is perhaps the truest expression we have had of his delicate bookish meditative soul  It has fineness of form and phrase perfect finish polish It is an expert modern handling of old forms old fashions   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  old ideals It has the pathetic and somewhat futile beauty of a fine lady of the old regime revisiting the glimpses of the moon in these days of war and slang and bad manners and feeling out of place as she confesses virginal ecstasies Mr Woodberry has never lived in his own time and the penalty he pays is that nothing his art fashions can have quite the quality of an authentic original No one today can quite put over a Louis XV Sevres plate or a Donatello altar or a sonnet sequence of disembodied and ecstatic passion The moment for those things is gone our attempts at them have the flavor of a revival a reproduction Their sincerities are bookish sincerities ardors for truth to type and period not life but literature  This sonnet for example is almost but not quite Sir Philip Sidney  Full gently then Love laid me on his breast And kissed me cheek and hands and lips and brow So sweetly that I do remember now The wonder of it and the unexpressed Infinite honor wherewith his eyes caressed Youth in my soul then ripening to the vow That binds us and he said to me Sleep thou One comes who brings to thee eternal rest  I know not how in that dread interval My lady did herself to me make known So deep a slumber did upon me fall I woke to know her being in my own The nameless mystery whereon I call When every hope hath from my bosom flown  Sonnet XVII is a still franker expression of monastic rapture Perhaps XXX I is the furthest of all from that mood a fine tribute of gratitude for royal lineage   A Modern Solitary  The kings of thought and lords of chivalry Knighted me in great ages long ago  Mr Ledoux s book is a reverent and thoughtful biography and critical estimate of the poet with a complete bibliography If in our opinion it overestimates his art we at least get from it an admirable presentation of the point of view of his admirers H M  THE OLD GODS  The Story of Eleusis a Lyrical Drama by Louis V Ledoux Macmillan Co Yzdra a Tragedy by Louis V Ledoux Macmillan Co  These two plays may be regarded as experiments in an old fashion one as quaintly outworn today as hoop skirts or powdered wigs They are eighteenth century classic the studied library work of a cultivated man of letters who follows literature with gentlemanly discretion as an agreeable occupation for his leisure And The Story of Eleusis has a certain charm the old gods the old myths are handled with a delicate touch we feel soft airs blowing perfumes from far away The characters are figures in a pale frieze they move as in a dream behind a veil If the poet can not aspire to the Greek magic and if some of his choruses are too obviously of Swinburnian cadence he yet attains a certain harmony of tone in a balanced composition and fine lines of studied and reverent simplicity light the picture with notes of soft color  In Yzdra published later we find the style stiffening as is natural with a manner so essentially artificial Even that   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  whalebone fashion has outgrown one would think such tinsel phrases as ay forsooth perchance tis he as wise as fair and such lines as  Some fate impendeth in the womb of time  or  I cannot choose but love in spite of all Moreover the theme is beyond its reach Alexander the Great wears knee breeches and a powdered wig like the actors of the early Georges and is never for a moment convincing either as king conquering soldier or passionate lover  Both Eleusis and Yzdra are period plays the period being neither Persephone s nor Alexander s but the later Addison s One has more atmosphere than the other but like the period rooms of the modern rich they don t quite get the flavor  IL M  FOR CHILDREN  Songs of Childhood by Walter de la Mare Longmans  Green amp Co London and New York  It is a delight to have a new edition of these lovely lyrics for children first printed most of them fifteen years ago and of late out of print The author was a lyrist of sure instinct then as now even though certain of his later poems have a rarer beauty Already we have the delicate humor the eerieness and wistfulness so characteristic of the man  One wonders whether the faint light perfume of these poems would escape one s robust child friends Perhaps some of them would feel it anyway this one on The Fly should appeal to them all   For Children  How large unto the tiny fly Must little things appear A rose bud like a feather bed Its prickle like a spear  A dewdrop like a looking glass A hair like golden wire The smallest grain of mustard seed As fierce as coals of fire  A loaf of bread a lofty hill A wasp a cruel leopard And specks of salt as bright to see As lambkins to a shepherd  H M  OTHER BOOKS OF VERSE  Verses by Hilaire Belloc With an Introduction by Joyce Kilmer Lawrence J Gomme Mr Kilmer says Hilaire Belloc is a poet Also he is a  Frenchman an Englishman an Oxford man a Roman Catholic a country gentleman a soldier a democrat and a practical journalist He is always all these things  But only very casually is Hilaire Belloc a poet only now and then in this book Always he is a personality though in his ballads and devotional poems and drinking songs there is a rich feel and flavor whether they are quite poetry or not sometimes they are frankly nonsense or slap dash journalism But the three poems of the Virgin Our Lord and Our Lady In a Boat and Courtesy have a high beauty and simplicity and The Leader is that rare treasure of the muse a truly heroic ballad and with a modern meaning We quote the beginning and end   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The sword fell down I heard a knell I thought that ease was best And sullen men that buy and sell  Were host and I was guest All unashamed I sat with swine We shook the dice for war  The night was drunk with an evil wine But she went on before  She rode a steed of the sea foam breed All faery was her blade And the armour on her tender limbs Was of the moonshine made  I hear them all my fathers call I see them how they ride And where had been that rout obscene Was an army straight with pride A hundred thousand marching men Of squadrons twenty score And after them all the guns the guns But she went on before  Her face was like the king s command  When all the swords are drawn She stretched her arms and smiled at us Her head was higher than the hills She led us to the endless plains  We lost her in the dawn  H M  Pilgrimage by Eric Shepherd Longmans Green amp Co  Because of its absolute sincerity one likes and respects this book even though not in accord with its religious doctrines or its doctrines of art The emotion and the craftsmanship are so honest so lucid and basically sound one wonders what poetry Mr Shepherd would have given us if he had come to see the world with equal sincerity through different glasses There is a delicacy and perfection of form in these poems   Other Books of Verse  which suggests The Shropshire Lad and the same blending of intimacy with reserve H H City Dust by Jane Burr Frank Shay New York  The best poems in this book are those that have to do with people but only the Tilly ones are really good The foundling baby is a delightful enviable baby but not quite sublimated into poetry The Lunger on the Roof and the wife in The Old Debt sound as if the writer had not yet come into sharp enough realization of these people to make them live in poems The tone of the book is journalistic and one wishes Jane Burr had waited a little longer before going into print H H  CORRESPONDENCE  COALS OF FIRE FROM THE COWBOY POET  Dear Madam A friend called my attention to the version of my Glory Trail appearing in your August issue also to your editorial announcement that I was unknown I mentally admitted the truth of the latter statement but felt pained that my obscurity should be trumpeted about the country through the pages of your excellent magazine Today however I saw your September issue and my wounds are healed While I am in a good humor I will set an honest heel squarely upon the corns of my writhing egotism and confess that you are right in saying that the cowpunchers version of the song is an improvement over the original  During my years on the ranch in the border country I had no idea that more than one or two of my companions of the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  roundup ever read my poetical paroxysms If I had apprehensions for my personal safety might have made my life on the range a less perfect memory than it is One night around the fire while I was cooking for an outfit on the drive during the alcoholic disability of the regular incumbent I heard the story of a cowboy in the Chiricahua mountains I think who had roped a bobcat and dragged it to death The same night Dave asked Bronc to sing a song a real folk song I reckon that must have been which began with the words  Way high up on Pecos stream but Bronc couldn t remember it These fragments with various amazing lies which the boys told of their prowess with the rope went into my melting pot however and a year or so later the rhyme of High Chin Bob resulted much as Aaron s golden calf came out of the fire after the Israelitish bracelets and earrings had been thrown in  And so there isn t an atom of mystery about it nor a scrap of romance Instead of being some mysterious sun tinged singer of the old free days who has now crossed the Great Divide and is drinking straight whisky and shooting holes through the roof of the Valhalla to which Wild Bill and Calamity Jane and Big nosed George and the Apache Kid and the other old worthies have gone I am a drearily ordinary Western man who wears shoes and goes to church and boosts for prohibition like most of the other reformed cowpunchers Your kind words though rattle around in my heart as merrily as the ball on a roulette wheel and I thank you for them Badger Clark   ANNOUNCEMENT OF AWARDS  It is the happy but difficult prerogative of the editorial staff of POETRY to award
