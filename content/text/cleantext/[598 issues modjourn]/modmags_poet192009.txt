night we spied upon See sawing home Singing a hot sweet song to the super stars Shuffling off behind the smoke haze Fog horns sentimentalizing on the river Lights dwindling to shining slits In the wet asphalt Purring light red and green and golden whiskered Digging daintily pointed claws in the soft mud  But you did not know As the trains made golden augurs   Boring in the darkness How my heart kept racing out along the rails As a spider runs along a thread And hauls him in again To some drawing point You did not know How wild ducks wings Itch at dawn How at dawn the necks of wild ducks Arch to the sun And how sweet in their gullets Trickles new mown air  II  As water cleared of the reflection of a bird That has swiftly flown across it Yet trembles with the beating of its wings So my soul emptied of the known you utterly Is yet vibrant with the cadence of the song  you might have been   But twas a great night With never a spoiling look over the shoulder Curved to the crook of the wind And a great word we threw For memory to play knuckles with A word the waters of the world have washed Leaving it stark and without smell    Lola Ridge  A word that rattles well in emptiness Good by  ALTITUDE  wonder How it would be here with you Where the wind That has shaken off its dust in low valleys Touches one cleanly As with a new washed hand And pain Is as the remote hunger of droning things And anger But a little silence Sinking into the great silence  AFTER STORM  Was there a wind Tap tap   Night pads upon the snow With moccasined feet And it is still so still An eagle s feather  Might fall like a stone  Could there have been a storm   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Mad tossing golden mane on the neck of the wind  Tearing up the sky loose flapping like a tent about the ice capped stars  Cool sheer and motionless The frosted pines Are jewelled with a million flaming points That fling their beauty up in long white sheaves Till they catch hands with stars Could there have been a wind That haled them by the hair And blinding Blue forked Flowers of the lightning In their leaves  Tap tap Slow ticking centuries Soft as bare feet upon the snow Faint lulling as heard rain  upon heaped leaves So silence builds her wall about a dream impaled   Lola Ridge  CACTUS SEED  I  Radiant notes  Piercing my narrow chested room  Beating down through my ceiling  Smeared with unshapen  Belly prints of dreams  Drifted out of old smokes Trillions of icily  Peltering notes  Out of just one canary All grown to song As a plant to its stalk  From too long craning at a sky light And a square of second hand blue  Silvery strident throat So assiduously serenading me My brain flinches under The glittering hail of your notes Were you not safe behind rats know what thickness of  plastered wall I might fathom Your golden delirium With throttle of finger and thumb Shutting valve of bright song   II  But if away off on a fork of grassed earth Socketing an inlet of blue water If canaries do they sing out of cages Flung such luminous notes They would sink in the spirit Lie germinal   Housed in the soul as a seed in the earth To break forth at spring with the crocuses  into young smiles on the mouth Or glancing off buoyantly Radiate notes in one key With the sparkle of rain drops On the petal of a cactus flower Focusing the just out sun  Cactus why cactus God God Somewhere away off Cactus flowers star yellow Ray out of spiked green And empties of sky Roll you over and over Like a mother her baby in long grass And only the wind scandal mongers with gum trees Pricking multiple leaves at his wondrous story   Lola Ridge  THE DREAM  I have a dream To fill the golden sheath of a remembered day  Air Heavy and massed and blue  as the vapor of opium Domes Fired in sulphurous mist Sea Quiescent as a gray seal And the emerging sun Spurting up gold  over Sydney smoke pale rising out of the bay  But the day is an upturned cup And its sun a junk of red iron Guttering in sluggish green water Where shall I pour my dream   Lola Ridge  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  UNDER THE SUN  TO ONE UNKNOWN  I pass you by in the public street O beautiful one O wind of gladness You are a call to me a promise of mystery Of delirium and aching madness  I pass you by in the public street You are a challenge O entrancer I am a boy afraid and I pass you by Though my heart is breaking to answer  I pass you by but the memory of you Is as a breath from some strange world crying As a scent of oranges in the nostrils of the sick As music in the ears of the dying  O MY LOVE  Do not lose yourself O my love in song and in music Or you will be lost like a dewdrop s dream of the morning Swept away by a cataract s myriad throated rushing Do not lose yourself in the light words of gay voices In the drumming of dancing feet in the loudness of laughter Do not lose yourself O my love in song and in music For only in the silence can love speak to you Only in the silence can you whisper your answer   Oscar Williams  Do not hide yourself O my love in light or in color Or you will be hidden as the world is hidden in sunlight Away from the dreams and the twilights of nebular spaces Do not hide yourself in crystal bulbs or in rainbows Though romance wears scintillant tinsel her heart is crying Do not hide yourself O my love in light or in color For only in the darkness can life find you Only in the darkness can you follow his light  MY GREATNESS  When I realized my greatness at once 1 shrivelled and grew little As clouds shrivel when they realize the wonders of their cargoes Carrying the fates of flowers and rainbows and the souls of little children The moment I realized how great I was I was great no longer  From the depth of earth and ocean through the eyes of flowers and spray I gazed at the blue skies across which I had sailed in crimson splendor And slowly and unseen I climbed up the stairways of the sun rays And slowly and unseen I lifted myself on the wings of the wind And I rose from my littleness that was the fulfilment of my greatness   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MOOD  A sky filling with shadow as a flower with rain A wind gray with the secret moods of the sea And the old singing comes back again The old aching perplexity  The old questioning comes back once more Asking the little shadows hiding in tears Why love cries in the rain outside the door And beauty blunders forever down the years  CHIAROSCUROS  I  I was begotten in joy And born in pain As a raindrop is begotten in gold And born in gray And in the heart of me as in the heart of the raindrop The twilight and the rainbow Keep their rendezvous  II  As dawn moving among the dews Stirs the shadows that slumber in them So have you beloved one Rustled your delicate gold Among my dreams   Oscar Williams  REVENGE  I have come out of my grave For my revenge upon death Who bound me to a wind swirled gnarled crag And set the stars picking at my bones Like a million tiny vultures Long long before Prometheus I too had stolen a fire greater than his  But now I have come out of my grave  For my revenge upon death  Out of the curves of petals The curves of my face  Out of the caverns of the winds  The little caverns of my lungs  Out of the sunlight and moonlight  The glimmer of my eyes  Out of the rains and snows  My heart s cataract of plunging flames  Out of the tip toeing twilight  The hush of my soul  Oh I have come out of my grave  For my revenge upon death  For the little revenge men call life  Oscar Williams   DIARY WRITTEN ON PEONY PETALS  I  When the wind is soft  Amigo  Softer than the mittens on the magnolia buds When crocuses have dissolved into air again And the grass is lonely 1 should like to hear you say Let s talk I should like to be transfixed by your blue gaze And to defy your challenge  Amigo mio  When the magnolia is quite out You may come to see me It will make your eyes more blue The heaped white tree At the same time it may help me to resist Your impudent charm  II  It is under your trees I would walk my friend Under your black pines Looking out at summer in the meadows As at a pantomime  Summer is all very well   Grace Hazard Conkling  For a golden fringe around your forest   Tell the dark trees to expect me Afterward If I utter human words of longing They will not heed me Inscrutable dreamers above their indigo shadows  I shall not trouble them  But they will know I am there  III  The garden wrestling with dusk  Flings out a gleaming arm  To fend off shadows   Night she cries Why take away my white foxgloves When you have the stars  I have shining thoughts That resent darkness When foxgloves give up their radiance When lilies lean lower under weight of shadows I think of you My thoughts hold the last light  Night I cry  Why claim my love thoughts  When you have the moon   IV  Now these are dear to me Hyacinth with petal points curled back Twigs of willow Thin twisting smoke of green Along the poplars Trillium from the tall ravine   Hyacinth you broke into separate stars Willow you plaited into a fillet for my head Poplar leaves you crushed for their spring breath Trillium you read aloud to me Like a poem   v  It is because I am afraid of my heart  That I write about clouds and flowers  It is because no poem will hold you  That I occupy my mind with rhymes and patterns  VI  Where am I going  I am going down the garden to the circle of the seven rose trees wherein I shall stand very still and close my eyes and tell myself roses do not exist  What shall I be doing this afternoon  I shall be exchanging words with you through an hour   Grace Hazard Conkling  cool like green shadow even words and well chosen words of soft color and of pleasing shape to help me try to believe you do not love me  VII  I have come back to the dusk And your flowers in the dusk Shadows hide them But I know they are crimson I can lose my thoughts among satin petals The color of wine  Home to the dusk And the sense of you in the dusk Distance withholding you bringing you near There is crimson At the heart of this darkness If you were with me We should need no light But peonies  VIII  On your way to the carnival in my heart You kissed my lips   The whole sea plunged Endlessly it poured  In green and shuddering columns past my spirit   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Drowning what I had thought Myself  felt the great waters possess me They followed my veins As they flow through the wavering anemone Far down the salt pool Afterward I remembered How I swayed and swayed in the strange light But you did not let me fall  IX  Fold down your love closely about me  Like petals of a dark rose  Hide me in the wonder of it  As in the golden core of a rose   Wrapped in your proud tenderness  Petal with petal softly interwoven  How I shall sing and sing  Though none may hear  Yet I shall be heard   The stirring of wings in your heart  Will be my dreaming  And your voice uttering yourself  Will be my voice  Forever  Grace Hazard Conkling   IF YOU WERE CARELESS  If you were careless ever if ever a thing you missed In the forest a serpent twist Of shadow ensnaring the star lit way of a tree If at your wrist The pulse rang never never to the slow bells of the sea If a star quick carven in frost and in amethyst Shone on the thin thin finger of dawn you turning away  your face  You shall be sorry sorry for when you die Those three Shall follow and follow and find you As you go through the Difficult Place The strong snake shadows shall bind you The swords of the stars shall blind you And the terrible bells of the sea shall crash and cry The bells of the sea shall ring you out from under the sky In a lost grave to lie Under the ashes of space Ah never look back run fast you impotent passer by Those three Run behind you  Stella Benson   I ve bought a bit of broken land a scant three quarter acre tract  A ragged hill slope to the lake that ripples in the breeze A little house to shelter us with windows open to the sun Where friendly do the stars lean down above the listening  trees And there I walk at dusk o day amid the rank persimmon bush While fireflies light their flickering lamps among the whispering grass I hear the little frogs begin to chant their merry evening song And sweetly shrill the cricket s pipe salutes me as I pass  For once I was a vagabond I knew the smoke of eventide And once I was a rover how the hilltops sparkled then But now I am a freeholder and this alone belongs to me And all the shining earth beside belongs to other men  So here I ll have a garden plot and there a bush of lavender And underneath the spreading oaks a hive or two of bees With clambering roses on the fence and there a clump of purple flags And figs and trellised scuppernongs and fragrant myrtle trees The frogs shall sing my lullaby the flaming dawns awaken me Victor Starbuck  The silver rain shall wet me and the wandering winds shall dry And I will watch the seasons pass in green and golden pageantry And mark the armies of the night go marching through the sky  For once I was a wanderer with wind and star for company And once I was the over lord of all the clouds and trees But now I am a husbandman with spade and hoe com  panioned And you may have the winding roads and all the seven seas Victor Starbuck  AUTUMN PROPHECY  The dead leaves dance like withered witches Teetering swirling Dropping and curling  And crackling in the dried up ditches  Hear them whisper as we go past How each dry lip Rustles gossip  Do you hear them saying our love won t last  J M March   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  WORSHIP  EARTH SONG  Earth you have made me Of smoke and the flying Of strong winged birds  And the freedom of wind With the freedom of waves Has entered into my being  From dust of a moth wing You have made me Earth  A CERTAIN GIRL  Emotion springs from every facet Of her being Every mood leaps shining  THE ARCHER  Dawn throws her arrows of gold Into the oval Of my turquoise colored egg shell  Dawn breaks her arrow points  In torrents Of molten gold  Frederick Shea   AUGUST GARDENS  Failing petals and dusty leaves And drooping flower heads Beneath unpitying skies Unpromising of cloud or change Yet some faint life still moves In your pale veins Some dumb unknowing courage Meets each day s mocking sun  How you keep faith with wind and rain  I watch you in your silence Touch your curled tendrils While my tired eyes  Search heaven for promise Or for change  Can you know in your dim nerves  The touch of one who waits like you  And still keeps faith with God  As you keep faith with wind and rain  H H Bellamann   WOODROW WILSON  After seeing Drinkwater s Lincoln  I  We weep over the dead Lincoln  We bring tears  To the pretty playhouse  We bring tears To make a pleasant holiday  For we must have our tears Tears gently mingled with laughter And the muted clarinets  We bring tears For our holiday  We weep over the dead Lincoln  Yea we are a people chosen Young mighty and glorious  So  If we would have tears We must have woe From out some woeful land Or write it from an epitaph Making of it a sweet melancholy   Albert Frederick Wilson  We would have tears Yea this is no time for singing Or I should have voice Beyond these penny whistle tunes Of Jack and Jill  So I stand dumb When they weep When they weep Over the dead Lincoln  III  But it is not because I have not tried to sing  Here in my New England hills With December on the pasture land I have walked all day By the shores of Chimney Pond  Yea this is no time for singing  For the white chill is on me And the black alder path is frozen  The field mouse scuttles From the dried corn shock   And on the new snow  Runs the trail  Of the liver colored hound  That hunts all day  With toothless gums  IV  This is no time for singing  And yet  I cannot weep  I cannot bring tears  To the dead Lincoln  But if I could take my heart  From out this chill  I know full well  Where tears would flow  V  We would have tears  Gentle tears  To make a pleasant holiday  So  Then come along with me And I shall find for you   Albert Frederick Wilson  A comedy as melancholy As ever you could wish  But you must bring The muted clarinets  VI THE COMEDY  I think it is an old Morality Like Everyman I told you it was melancholy  Sift through with muted clarinets  My seat was so far back  I could not always get  The drift of it  A curious play For no one knew who had the lines The players or the people  And often it was just the chorus  With its burden  A myriad host  Emptying from the shoulders  Of a myriad years  Bringing each its myriad years  Coming up   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Coming up from the unending valleys Singing  Hosanna And Hosanna  Singing Hosanna To one who came  VII THE PLAYER  I thought I knew him by his face I thought I knew him by his dress I thought I knew him by his walk And all those old familiar gestures Of his hand and head  I d seen him so A thousand times or more Walking from his class room Down a quiet college green With the students playing base ball All about him  No silken robes transfigured him No sandaled feet No crown of light about his brow  I said It must be that the author   Albert Frederick Wilson  Needing to explain the plot Has brought him here to introduce The action and the time and place  And I think that he Had thought so too For he did not seem to know Just what to do Just what to say Just when to speak the lines The text had given him And so be gone  For they were singing Hosanna  And they would not let him go  How could he know There came the ox carts Bringing up a cross  But when his vision cleared And he could see down that long road To where the sky line closed I think he knew  For then he turned He turned and buttoned up his coat And started out to meet them   VIII  In that still moment Some one tittered down the aisle  And some one laughed And some one gave a loud guffaw  Then came the cat calls Back and forth across the house  Who was this gaunt buffoon Who made a mockery Of such a part  Where were the old tragedians Of the voice and hand Where the trappings of this noble board Where the rolling organ tones of salutation Where the strut and posture Where the studied smile Bending for the crown of thorns Where the riven chest So that all might see The slowly breaking heart  Oh sift through with muted clarinets  For then he turned He turned and buttoned up his coat And started out to meet them   Albert Frederick Wilson  IX  The little man beside me With blue mirthful eyes Laughed out until his face was red Crying  The same old buncombe We got from Barnum  The same old buncombe  In a high silk hat  And bending to my ear  He whispered  They can t even see the chalk marks  On his old tweed vest  x  But all the while  That myriad host  From down the valleys  Singing  Buddha Confucius Mohammed Christ Buddha Confucius Mohammed Christ  No matter who laughed No matter who scorned   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Buddha Confucius Mohammed Christ  Until at last  The little man with mirthful eyes  Wearying of his laughter  Cried  If he be a Messiah Let him save himself  And thought the words were new  But no one left  His red plush seat  To follow up the hill  XI THE PLAY ENDS  So when at last  They came out from the play One said A comedy indeed  And one Who wrote the travesty  And one  It doesn t go to music  And one It doesn t go to singing   Albert Frederick Wilson  And one You will not find it Written on an epitaph  XII  We bring tears To the pretty playhouse We make a pleasant holiday We weep over the dead Lincoln  But as for me I think evermore My feet shall follow The trail of the liver colored hound  Albert Frederick Wilson   COMMENT  IN TEXAS AND NEW MEXICO  HILE campaign oratory is loud in the land and the nation is weighing its two or three candidates in the balance and wishing it had more what can most of us do but go fishing The editor s fishing trip stretched southward through an arc of Texas Waco San Antonio El Paso and curved back northward through New Mexico with brief stops at Taos Cochiti and other more or less aboriginal villages and a long stop at Santa Fe  It was a deep plunge into our romantic Spanish and aboriginal past for the British conquest of our Atlantic coast though thorough and lasting was a prosaic affair compared with Coronado s little trip to the Seven Cities of Cibola and the tramp of Fray Marcos and the other brothers of Saint Francis across burning deserts to rock perched pueblos full of perishing heathen souls Moreover though our Pilgrim Fathers landed on a stern and rock bound coast they did not encounter useless and waterless wastes temple haunted gorges a mile deep and plains running like a river with huge horned beasts to the horizon And the Indians who opposed their progress King Philip and the rest were easily disposed of as savages they were not the inheritors of primitive rites dispensers of primitive arts guarding the tradition of beauty on the tip of their fortress rocks against malevolent Apaches  It was a reversal of the usual tourist s order to go to   In Texas and New Mexico  Texas in summer but only he who trusts the South can see the South loitering soft and golden under its quiet persistent sun Baylor University celebrating its diamond jubilee was as quaint and sweet as an old rhyme San Antonio modernizing itself as fast as possible with Woolworth buildings and spacious parks and trim policemen at the street corners was still dominated by the Alamo of heroic history and imaginatively guarded by the three old Missions crumbling into dust and memories a few miles away And to dine in the patio of the Hotel Menger was to slip into the mood of a perfect lady of the old South in a day when there was room for crinolines and leisure for  politeness  El Paso making a proud show of one hundred per cent Americanism at the Mexican gate holding your orator on the northern bank of the straggling Rio Grande when she longed to cross to Juarez and penetrate those long low yellow adobe streets and see the festal bull fight and the still more festal row of transplanted Texan saloons El Paso seemed to point its warning bridge finger southward with a commanding Spanish gesture insinuating that there lay the future of the world  And Santa Fe is Spanish too in fact New Mexico is  indeed a Spanish Aztec survival with a Mexican governor  and bilingual legislature and with dark men in som  breros and dark women in long black head shawls giving  you Castilian greetings as they pass you on the street The  long low colonnade of the Governor s Palace shadows three   centuries of Spanish history and down a side street from the little Plaza one may find the crumbling adobe walls of the oldest house in America the oldest that is built for white men in an outpost of the conquering race  Moreover the modern New Mexican school of adobe architecture is a reminder of the Spanish and aboriginal past for it derives from the low towered churches built by the Christianizing friars at neighboring pueblos churches which in turn accepted the hint of the hand molded pueblo houses with their projecting shadow casting beams Indeed the High School the Sunmount Sanatorium the little power plant building and above all the new museum are all beautiful modern expressions of this old idea the development of a molded adobe architecture innocent of sharp corners and rigidly straight lines an idea which may prove fruitful in that age of cement which seems imminent  Taos San Domingo Chimayo and the other pueblos as well as the old capital itself have colonized artists and poets of late as everyone knows At last the wisdom of the ages has opened our eyes to the wonderland beyond our western gates and made us aware not only of nature s stark and gorgeous sublimities but of immediate and vivid creations of primitive art one of the rarest remotest and most precious things on earth This is ancient Greece said William Vaughn Moody fifteen years ago after watching a katchina dance in northern Arizona but we Americans who would travel by the many thousand if we had the chance to see a Homeric rite in Attica or a serpent   In Texas and New Mexico  ceremony in old Egypt are only beginning to realize that the snake dance at Walpi or the corn dance at Cochiti are also revelations of primitive art expressions of that original human impulse toward the creation of beauty which modern civilization does so much to defeat and destroy  The Cochiti corn dance is a quieter longer more monotonous ceremony than the dramatic Hopi festival which I saw long ago and Cochiti lies low beside the Rio Grande while the sky city of Walpi perches precariously on its narrow mesa six hundred feet above the desert But both dances carry one s imagination into a past remote beyond our searching and both assemble all the arts with primitive spontaneity to the unified expression of a race and its earthly and spiritual life The many movements of the dance the curiously painted and costumed figures the slow chants to subtly varied rhythms of drums and rattles set in the village plaza against the saffron adobe walls all this grew as naturally out of the desert as the crimson cactus flower after a rain as vivid and spontaneous an expression of the life impulse and the life glory  A Cochiti squaw saw me cherishing a small bowl I had just bought so with many explanatory gestures she led me to her newly white washed picturesque little dwelling and to the acquisition of larger bowls which she had molded and painted out of an inherited instinct for design so sure and true as to put me to shame What are we doing I reflected we superior people who build Indian schools and send missionaries what are we doing to cherish and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  protect this precious inheritance of beauty to secure to these tribes their tribal customs and loyalties even while accepting and honoring their citizenship Fray Marcos and the other Franciscans grafted their mediaeval Christianity on those precious customs and loyalties built on them without destroying Shall we be wise enough to do likewise  But what has all this to do with modern poetry Ah much and more and still more I was almost oppressed with the wealth of our inheritance of our tradition if you will Why go to Greece or China O ye of little faith This South west which is but one chapter of our rich tradition is our own authentic wonderland a treasure trove of romantic myth profoundly significant and beautiful guarded by ancient races practicing their ancient rites in a region of incredible color and startling natural grandeur H M  THE DEATH OF MR REEDY  William Marion Reedy is dead A great journalist an enlightened and progressive critic a big broad human deep thinking laughter loving generous hearted man has gone over to the majority and the thousands of friends who mourn his loss look around in vain for anyone to fill his place in the service of the higher letters and the higher politics in America  Mr Reedy editing Reedy s Mirror in the centre of the  Mississippi Valley had a cosmopolitan mind and a spirit   The Death of Mr Reedy  which lived on familiar terms with all the big minded democrats all the men and women of light and leading of yesterday and today His talk belonged to the ages he could have held his own in the Mermaid Tavern or across the table from Dr Johnson or under the dialectics of Socrates or at the Gargantuan feasts of Rabelais Indeed his spirit really belonged to more spacious times than ours times with leisure in them and mountainous rages of laughter and keen pursuit of the idea through forests of entangling questions  The St Louis Mirror under this exceptional editor was the happy discoverer and first publisher not only of the Spoon River Anthology its most conspicuous trouvaille but also of numerous other poems and tales by gifted men and women until then unknown Mr Reedy was a prodigious worker his omnivorous reading and his weekly long hand writing of most of his paper did not prevent his catching any golden gleam of talent in the literary ore submitted to him Thus for many years the Mirror was an honorable refuge for progressive minds a conspicuous leader in progressive literary art  Bill Reedy genial philosopher that he was always kept away from the little deaths He loved laughter but he had no patience with cheap cynicism and facile humorous distrust in short with lack of faith in life One of the latest issues of his paper the Mirror for July 15th contains certain Reflections which may well bear the emphasis of a great man s parting word to the people of his time   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and especially to his fellow craftsmen They occur in an editorial about The Trained Seals the group of special writers who wrote from San Francisco desperately humorous and cynical articles about the democratic convention all done with a fine abandonment to every impulse to attribute every action of the politicians to the lowest possible motive  Mr Reedy points out that these expert observers made a nice big mutual admiration society exchanging compliments with each other which they denied to the politicians And he concludes  One can hardly refrain from reflecting that a people trained so to think of our political processes are in a fair way to get the kind of government they deserve If there is any great danger to this government in my opinion it is to be found in just the cynicism cultivated by the trained seals rather than in the roaring and raving of the reds We can t get anywhere other than into trouble if we are going to mock everything and believe in nothing or nobody  Reedy s Mirror is the only paper of which I never miss an issue said Carl Sandburg not long ago I have to know what Reedy thinks He is only one of many poets and others who will feel this loss as that of a wise counsellor and a genial friend  Edgar Lee Masters who knew him much better than the rest of us says  He had climbed and he stood naked and alone and tired upon the heights His last letter to me contained these words I often think of what some old sage said that immortality is a threat not a promise The best we can expect is rest  I shall not look upon his like again  H M   REVIEWS  TWO ENGLISH POETS  Poems First Series by J C Squire Alfred A Knopf The Queen of China and Other Poems by Edward Shanks  Alfred A Knopf  One may regard the poetic medium as a vehicle for the expression of thought or emotion not necessarily intimately connected with that vehicle as one looks through a window glass to the scene beyond or one may regard it as thought or emotion raised to such a pitch that it achieves an inevitable form from which the content could no more be separated than one can separate the component elements in a crystal and still preserve the crystal formation  Mr Squire s poems belong to the earlier category The vehicle is loose and ambulator although hardly so clear as a window glass it is almost as incidental One never feels that the emotion and form were reciprocally generative one feels rather that the elements of each were languidly concident seldom to the point of crystallization Only in a few lyrics does Mr Squire achieve anything approaching an inevitable unity And even in these he fails of that perfection which belongs for instance to an Elizabethan poem for the contour of an Elizabethan lyric is clear and self contained the image is not shattered before it is half stated and blurred with another In A Chant which in spite of its defects is one of the best of Mr Squire s lyrics the three stanzas are really separate poems   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and one notes the unwillingness of the syntax poetic rather than grammatical to follow the theme  Gently the petals fall as the tree gently sways That has known many springs and many petals fall Year after year to strew the green deserted ways And the statue and the pond and the low broken wall  Faded is the memory of old things done Peace floats on the ruins of ancient festival They lie and forget in the warmth of the sun And a sky silver blue arches over all  Oh softly oh tenderly the heart now stirs With desires faint and formless and seeking not I find Quiet thoughts that flash like azure kingfishers Across the luminous tranquil mirror of the mind  That has known here is weak the emphasis is on petals but that has known refers to tree Again in the second stanza one is a little uncertain about the antecedent of they Precisely it is the ruins but one has to look back to be sure that it is not peace or the memory of old things done which have more emphatic position than the ruins one is not sure at first just who they are who lie and forget in the warmth of the sun And in the third stanza With desires faint and formless is forced into a prominence which the weakness of the words and the rhythm will hardly stand This analysis is not meant as a pedagogical quibbling it represents a definite difficulty on the part of the reader and it explains the faultiness of the rhythm and sequence prevalent in so many of the poems a weakness which confuses the reader and makes the effort to follow Mr Squire wearisome The longer poems are diffuse and   Two English Poets  rambling Witness Town which has twenty eight stanzas of this level  There are the empty waiting spaces We watch we watch unwinking pale and dumb Till gliding up with noiseless paces Night covers all the wide arch the night has come Not that sick false night of the city Lurid and low and yellow and obscene But Mother Night pure full of pity The star strewn Night blue potent and serene Certainly one would not choose these stanzas with their crude makeshifts of rhyme and banal thought as examples of poetic good form and yet we are constantly chided this reviewer in particular for lack of appreciation of the technical excellence of the younger English poets who are supposed to surpass American poets in this respect It must not be thought however that this selection is malicious the poems are full of just such makeshifts of lines as poor as And when the rain adown it streams Or this as the beginning of a poem  Rivers I have seen which were beautiful  Or stanzas that have as little stanzaic structure as this  The evening closes in As down the last long lane I plod there patter round First heavy drops of rain  On whatever score Mr Squire may be praised it can  not be on that of technical craftsmanship He is too ob  viously an amateur   POETRY A Magazine of Verse Several lyrics however almost rise above the amateur  level they are The Stronghold Behind the Lines The March In The Park and A Chant quoted above Of the longer poems Antinomies in a Railway Station and  Ode in a Restaurant are perhaps the most interesting But they are too long and diffuse the emotion is lost before the poem is half done  Mr Shanks seems to share with Mr Squire a too great complaisance toward his medium Otherwise how could he let a stanza like this see the light of cold print  And have I other lives what love have they Of mine except what in your love I learnt In whose eyes first I saw immortal day In whose arms first my sorrow to joy was burnt  There is little immediacy in Mr Shanks poems They are cloaked with phrases that have slight power to stir the imagination  However much there is There s not too much for bare and mortal days That now receding in youth s golden haze Seem dim but ever full eternities  In his sonnets there is more brittle line rhythm than that internal cadence which makes of the sonnet a series of strong upward and downward curving waves culminating in the final musical resolution  I was a soldier once How fear was then Mixed with bright honor and delightful pride How different we were from other men Who lived in houses and in houses died How huge the morning was before the sun Sullenly found us marching in the mist   Two English Poets  And sleep was dark and deep when work was done And food awoke in us a greedy zest But all that s over I no more shall see Quick to the word and ready to my hand The smooth and easy moving company Marching in column on the heathery land There s no pride now and fear s the fear that s bred Of money and such like maggots in the head  Notice the distinctly Georgian flavor of the final couplet  Nature is described in Mr Shanks poems but never seems to live or to flow The scene and the observer remain separate they do not merge  The narrow paths branch everyway up here And cross and tangle and are nowhere clear And the empty sky swept clean by a rainy breath Smiles on our tortuous scrambling underneath But here s the top for round a sudden bend We stumble breathless on the unlooked for end And stare across the misty weald Below The lonely trains through the wide country go Each with its plume of steam And westward see Past the far shoulder streams tumultuously A black and driven storm across the air And casts about the downs its troubled hair Thick at the middle at the edges thinned Heeling over like a ship before the wind It eats the weald up with a greedy mouth Still twenty miles or further to the south Dimly and grandly Chanctonbury stands A moment clear above the blotted lands It s gone But still the blue and empty sky Smiles on over our heads unwittingly  This book was awarded the first Hawthornden prize of one hundred pounds for the most distinguished book of poems published by an English author under forty years of age The judges were J C Squire Laurence Binyon and Edward Marsh A C H    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NEW WAR POETS  The Tempering by Howard Buck Yale University Press Chords from Albireo by Danford Barney John Lane Co There and Here by Allen Tucker Duffield and Co Poems by Cecil Roberts Frederick A Stokes Co The Poets in Picardy by E de Stein John Murray Poems in Captivity by John Still John Lane Co  New books of war poems mostly confirm the conviction that war and poetry are neither cause and effect nor even usual companions  War releases the emotions of the crowd which psychologists have shown are wholly different from the sum of the emotions of the individuals in the crowd Doubtless they are a theme for poetry what is not but only in the hands of a master Their treatment by the ordinary versifier does what a photograph does it shows what any observer can see There is of course a certain pleasure in recognition in saying Gosh ain t it natural But that is an elementary esthetic pleasure if it is an esthetic pleasure at all  Then too the emotions of war get expressed in action They are not for the time inhibited and then later expressed in art After intense emotion followed by equally intense physical action it is a long time before there can be intense expression in art The expression is over at least until the emotions can be remembered in tranquillity and that is a long time yet  The six books under consideration confirm these observations although the volumes themselves divide easily into   New War Poets  two groups Three are English and three American and nobody could be misled into confusing them The Englishmen are in a measure crystallized They produce larger more conventional volumes They have a certain maturity They seem older perhaps not in years but in experience and background They write as Englishmen have written for generations  The young Americans are anything but crystallized Instead of maturity they have the serious mindedness of the undergraduate Instead of background they have the mid Victorian attitude that still reigns in pristine purity in many American colleges But what gleams they show are gleams of promise These boys have not grown up  To anyone who is looking for promise Howard Buck s The Tempering is the most interesting of the lot It is by the way the first volume in The Yale Series of Younger Poets just started to afford a publishing medium for the work of young men and women who have not yet secured a wide public recognition There are similar series in England and it is a fine thing to have one in the United States  But to return to Mr Buck His book is young as he is and particularly in the earlier poems the cliché blossoms unashamed  Ah drain to the dregs that dizzy draught The bliss of a kiss from the Infinite  The later poems dealing mostly with the war in which the author won the Croix de Guerre show freedom and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  promise a group of them was awarded the Albert S Cook Prize in Poetry at Yale in 1918 In these the author says what he feels not what he thinks he ought to feel or what the mass feels His Dedication 1917 with its restrained final couplet  The husks of life are gone only the corn Waits for its golden grinding with the morn  has none of the professional heroics that characterize much war verse Mr Buck believes in the righteousness of the war but he does not idealize it  Their strange eyes hold no vision as a rule No dizzy glory  he says in what is probably the best poem in the volume The poem on Robert Hall Killed September 12 is remarkable for simplicity and sincerity in spite of two or three conventionally poetic expressions  Danford Barney is likewise a Yale man but a very different one The most remarkable thing about his volume is the foreword by Lawrence Mason a Yale professor who states and elucidates the obvious with dull persistence  In his poems Mr Barney does the same thing His verse lacks individuality It is reminiscent of the classics especially the classics in which to quote phrases by his sponsor Beauty Innocence and Aspiration stalk about and pose in eternal sanctity Dr Mason teaches a course known as The English Lyric may not Mr Barney have got his poetic inspiration from that indubitably platitudinous source   New War Poets  Allen Tucker is in form a modern Nearly all his poems are in vers libre but they are hopelessly commonplace and conventional The sun is bright and life is full to Mr Tucker as it is to thousands of versifiers Likewise Beauty was everywhere as it or She has been on countless occasions When Mr Tucker does hit upon a new image or comparison it is of doubtful appropriateness  Twenty years ago Cecil Roberts would have been esteemed a better poet than he can be today His is the workmanship of that generally sterile period from 1890 to 1910 In both theme and phrase his work has echoes of poems from the Elizabethan age down He is cultivated accomplished a thinned out Alfred Noyes though more modern in his intellectual and spiritual outlook  John Masefield writes a preface to Mr Roberts Poems why it is hard to see unless merely because he was as he admits asked to do so It is only fair to point out that he does not claim greatness for his protégé The poems have facile singable qualities and show a measure of descriptive ability but hardly more can be said of them The literary editor of the Liverpool Post and already at twenty eight the author of a dozen books Mr Roberts granted a normal term of life will doubtless produce several times that number One hopes that most of them will be prose for he is an excellent prose writer  Pleasant English humor largely satirical characterizes Mr de Stein s Poets in Picardy though there are notes of seriousness in the book So called fragments imitate   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the manner of Homer Shakespeare Gilbert and others in treating themes connected with the late war Natural and light hearted the volume reminds the reader agreeably of Captain Bruce Bairnsfeather s cartoons and the musical play based on them The author manifestly is the sort of person one would enjoy knowing  The interest of John Still s poems is in their subject matter The verse that gives the volume its title Poems in Captivity was written while the author a British officer was a prisoner of the Turks The more attractive poems however are those which deal with the history and lore of Ceylon where the author formerly lived The average reader knows nothing about Ceylon and endures the too facile monotonous verse to get the stories As poetry the volume is inconsequential It is a pity it was not written in prose Nelson Antrim Crawford  ANOTHER VIEW OF MR BARNEY S BOOK  Chords from Albireo by Danford Barney John Lane Co  Chords from Albireo is perhaps a fitting title for a book of poems whose qualities and their limitations it at once indicates Mr Barney s work has the effect of a passage of music so faintly heard as to be barely intelligible indeed its very magic is sometimes due to its veiled and indefinable character Like a faraway singing heard at night from an open window it haunts the imagination while teasing the senses which strain forward to make out if possible the more satisfying outline of definite melody   Another View of Mr Barney s Book  It is now nearly four years since the publication of the author s first book Dust of Stars During that period he has passed through the severe experience of service in France and of spiritual expansion in other directions but from the new volume as from the first arises the same veiled if often tremendous music I say tremendous advisedly because while the average reader and even the hardened athlete of poetry will frequently be sorely taxed to know what it is all about there can be no question that this poet has something to say and something somewhat bigger than his command of his medium will yet permit him to make as clear to others as it already is to himself Everywhere is felt the laboring and tumult of some intelligible thing not yet fully delivered into language the progress the motion toward a determinate end are all evident the book abounds in gorgeous similes organic periods of spacious verbal music and an astonishing range of vocabulary and yet the import of it all often so nearly revealed as to appear imminent somehow just fails of piercing through The poet thinks he has said it at last but the reader while mysteriously enchanted remains no wiser than before  Take for instance the following lines full of that large music and long flowing rhythm characteristic of all Mr Barney s blank verse  Nay time will come when every saint shall bear The gift of sense perfected in the thirst Of clear fulfilment hear and see and touch Until delight of graver ecstasies Garner the immortalities of earth So harmony of many instruments   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In poignant overture must raise the thought In universal theme beyond the sense Of this our every day until the years Spin to the heavens planetary tune Beyond the casual dreamer s power to hold The greater vision in his common life  A meaning is felt in these lines almost beyond sense they have the force and form of meaning but their baffled thunder upon analysis defies translation into intelligible thought The same is true of the more lyrical passages in which this poet has an equal power of verbal melody  Where unexpected sense shall quaff The choiring beauty of no form Or from its peace ride as the chaff Giddy on pinnacles of storm  Moreover much of his work is vitiated by intolerable dilutions the careless intrusion of cheap and outworn phrases and of whole stanzas or passages which add nothing whether of meaning or music and therefore detract a great deal His indebtedness to Francis Thompson and Gerard Hopkins is perhaps also too evident  What shall be said then of a poet so inexplicably tantalizing a poet who seems forever just withholding the momentous secret with which all his utterance travails a poet moreover who lets fall in moments of less tortured intensity such lines as Where the wind moved like rain mysteriously or of troops on parade before embarkation  Others shall fill the ranks where the lines of smiling men Marched as shadows away in the wonder of dark belief  Or again   Another View of Mr Barney s Book  If he has seen the apple blossoms sway  In all their hallowed vesture  The answer is to be found in a few of the maturer poems scattered throughout the volume and most frequently perhaps in the section entitled France These latter embody a sensitive yet strong and austere nature s reactions to the sodden tragedy of war Life has wrung a clear cry from the chaotic heart of youth and a distinct personality and a distinct message begin to emerge from the cloud of adolescent imagery  Few living poets have possessed to the same degree as Mr Barney with equal master of verbal music the austere and inexorable spirituality which is so passionately revealed in his moments of genuine articulacy  John Hall Wheelock CORRESPONDENCE  A PARIS LETTER  This is my first letter from Paris I have asked a friend of mine to help me choose the flowers that I present to the readers of POETRY out of the overgrown gardens of modern verse He is also a poet and I shall tell you some day about his Coureur d azur Azure Runner  Some critics had fondled the hope that the war would bring a new sort of lyricism and bury forever the traditional forms of French verse But the course of poetry has not been changed by five years of cannon roar The pre   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  war poets seem to consider the terrible adventure of 1914 as a mere accident In 1914 the poetic schools were fast disappearing they are quite extinct in 1920 Yet two or three strong influences seem to permeate modern verse We shall try to make them clear  Since October 1919 several books of verse have appeared Imageries des Mers is perhaps the most interesting Its author had already attracted the critics and amateurs attention by his La Floraison des Eaux Livre de la Mort and Des Fleurs pourquoi The artistic tendencies of Guy Lavaud have not been changed by the war This verse is the most savory fruit of the Mallarméan tree Mallarmé s teaching has been profitable and his glory is brighter than ever  Guy Lavaud s poetry is a perpetual illusion The fading of the hills in the night the sun abandoned waters made one with the dying body of the beloved in Livre de la Mort Today it is the sea its sands its islands its barks its ever changing pageantry that molds the face of destiny and the mystery of poetic inspiration  D un coeur qui se détache on a quitté le monde Un froissement d étrave ouvre l immensité Mais tout de même en nous quel souvenir si blonde Comme un sein de sirène une ile reparait  His form is pure artistry and here again Mallarmé s influence is discernible  A quite different book is Lampes á arc by Monsieur Paul Moraud who belongs to the so called cubist school the only group of poets which has survived the war But its leader Guillaume Apollinaire died a soldier and his was a very   A Paris Letter  pathetic death Max Jacole Jean Cocteau Paul Moraud are the only inheritors of Apollinaire s ideas worth mentioning  Paul Moraud is a fanciful ironist  Les villas sont serrées au bord de la promenade Comme des incisives Tandis qu au dessus Comme de noires molaires déchaussées Les couvents jésuites Mastiquent un paysage de montagnes  Lampes á arc reveals another strong influence that of Rimbaud only we do not find in Moraud s book the psychological vistas that illumine Arthur Rimbaud s extraordinary work  The cubist school has entirely freed itself from any kind of rhythm We need not blame them for it we may even assert that they have given us far better things than myriads of insipid alexandrine writers Yet the cubist school lacks an essential character of eternal poetry its lyrical sway  Opposite the cubist school we find a few good writers of traditional verse only Francis Eon s and Vincent Muselli s tradition is not a wrinkled dame they both are disciples of Moréas whose Stances have been another strong influence on French verse Muselli who had already given us Les Travaux et les Jeux displays in his Masques a real ability for heroic comic verse There is quite a tradition of heroic comic poetry in French literature Muselli s muse reminds the reader of another no less famous Saint Amand s Muselli is obviously influenced by the Parnassian school whose perfection of form occasionally tempts a French mind José Maria Heredia has taught a great lesson of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  elaborate artistry to Muselli and others yet Moréas Stances are less overwrought with descriptive details and for that reason nearer to the directness of our times Muselli writes  Mieux que des potentats les pompeuses demeures Ta gargote m est chère et libre de soucis Sous un plafond tombant entre des murs noircis J y coule sans compter les plus belles des heures  Les Masques presents that easy going philosophy that serene melancholy that smiling acceptance of human destiny which are so beautifully disclosed in the Stances  La Vie Continue by Francis Eon is a book of lyrics with French scenery as a background and with echoes of recent events  Je l aime cette plaine avec un moulin mort Ses champs bien partagés expriment la mesure Mais j entretiens en moi trop soucieux du sort  Une étrange blessure  In spite of the ruined houses in spite of the mutilated landscape in spite of death life continues Wa r has inspired numberless poets Louis Mandin already known by his Saisons ferventes Ariel esclave has given us Notre Passion a book full of the horrors and suffering of war expressed in both verse and prose This poet was a great soldier but he is not so great an artist His poetical transposition of facts is not sufficient His hand shakes with emotion while writing and though he finds occasional strains of real poetry  Vents qui soufflez la mort vents qu embaumait la rose Ah que vous soulevez en nous de souvenirs   A Paris Letter  his moods remain too often untranslated into artistic form  Beyond the ordinary production of verse the above mentioned books mark an important period of French poetry our muse has kept her poise and melancholy smile during the five last years Mallarmé Rimbaud Moréas with their cult of artistic form their subtle sincerity are all pervading influences Yet in spite of influence France possesses now a few original poets to say nothing of those who had already attracted universal attention and are well known in America Fers libre and traditional form have acquired a great pliancy in the hands of real artists whose offerings are a joy forever to the lovers of poetry Jean Catel  MACHINERY IN ART  To the Editor of POETRY In
