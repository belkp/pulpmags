which expired Sept 30th IÇI7 and although the endowment has been partly resub scribed for another period this Fund is insufficient and expenses are constantly increasing The art of poetry requires if it is to advance not only special sympathy from a discriminating public but also endowment similar to that readily granted to the other arts All who believe in the general purpose and policy of this magazine and recognize the need and value of  such an organ of the art are invited to assist thus in maintaining it   JULY 1918  PRAIRIE  I WAS born on the prairie and the milk of its wheat the red of its clover the eyes of its women gave me a song and a slogan  Here the water went down the icebergs slid with gravel the gaps and the valleys hissed and the black loam came and the yellow sandy loam  Here between the sheds of the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians here now a morning star fixes a fire sign over the timber claims and cow pastures the corn belt the cotton belt the cattle ranches  Here the grey geese go five hundred miles and back with a wind under their wings honking the cry for a new home  Here I know I will hanker after nothing so much as one more sunrise or a sky moon of fire doubled to a river moon of water   The prairie sings to me in the forenoon and I know in the night I rest easy in the prairie arms on the prairie heart  After the sunburn of the day handling a pitchfork at a hayrack after the eggs and biscuit and coffee the pearl grey haystacks in the gloaming are cool prayers to the harvest hands  In the city among the walls the overland passenger train is choked and the pistons hiss and the wheels curse  On the prairie the overland flits on phantom wheels and the sky and the soil between them muffle the pistons and cheer the wheels  I am here when the cities are gone I am here before the cities come I nourished the lonely men on horses I will keep the laughing men who ride iron I am dust of the dust of men  The running water babbled to the deer the cottontail the  gopher You came in wagons making streets and schools Kin of the ax and rifle kin of the plow and horse   Singing Yankee Doodle Old Dan Tucker Turkey in the Straw  You in the coonskin cap at a log house door hearing a lone wolf howl You at a sod house door reading the blizzards and chinooks  let loose from Medicine Hat I am dust of your dust as I am brother and mother T o the copper faces working in flint and clay The singing women and their sons of a thousand years ago Marching single file the timber and the plain  I hold the dust of these amid changing stars I last while old wars are fought while peace broods motherlike While new wars arise and the fresh killings of young men  I fed the boys who went to France in great dark days Appomatox is a beautiful word to me and so is Valley Forge  and the Marne and Verdun I who have seen the red births and the red deaths Of sons and daughters I take peace or war I say nothing  and wait  Have you seen a red sunset drip over one of my cornfields the shore of night stars the wave lines of dawn up a wheat valley  Have you heard my threshing crews yelling in the chaff of a strawpile and the running wheat of the wagonboards my cornhuskers my harvest hands hauling crops singing dreams of women worlds horizons   Rivers cut a path on flat lands The mountains stand up The salt oceans press in and push on the coast lines The sun the wind bring rain and I know what the rainbow writes across the  east or west in a half circle A love letter pledge to come again  Towns on the Soo Line towns on the Big Muddy laugh at each other for cubs and tease as children  Omaha and Kansas City Minneapolis and St Paul sisters in a house together throwing slang growing up Towns in the Ozarks Dakota wheat towns Wichita Peoria Buffalo sisters throwing slang growing up  Out of prairie brown grass crossed with a streamer of wigwam smoke out of a small pillar a blue promise out of wild ducks woven in greens and purples  Here I saw a city rise and say to the peoples round the world Listen I am strong I know what I want  Out of log houses and stumps canoes stripped from tree sides flatboats coaxed with an ax from the timber claims in the years when the red and the white men met the houses and streets rose   Carl Sandburg  A thousand red men cried and went away to new places for corn and women a million white men came and put up skyscrapers threw out rails and wires feelers to the salt sea now the smokestacks bite the sky line with stub teeth  In an early year the call of a wild duck woven in greens and purples now the riveter s chatter the police patrol the song whistle of the steam boat  T o a man across a thousand years I offer a handshake I say to him Brother make the story short for the stretch of a thousand years is short  What brothers these in the dark What eaves of skyscrapers against a smoke moon These chimneys shaking on the lumber shanties When the coal boats plow by on the river The hunched shoulders of the grain elevators The flame sprockets of the sheet steel mills And the men in the rolling mills with their shirts off Playing their flesh arms against the twisting wrists of steel  What brothers these in the dark of a thousand years  A headlight searches a snowstorm A funnel of white light shoots from over the pilot of the Pioneer Limited crossing Wisconsin   In the morning hours in the dawn The sun puts out the stars of the sky And the headlight of the limited train  The fireman waves his hand to a country school teacher on a bob sled  A boy yellow hair red scarf and mittens on the bob sled in his lunch box a pork chop sandwich and a V of gooseberry pie  The horses fathom a snow to their knees Snow hats are on the rolling prairie hills The Mississippi bluffs wear snow hats  Keep your hogs on changing corn and mashes of grain O  farmerman Cram their insides till they waddle on short legs Under the drums of bellies hams of fat Kill your hogs with a knife slit under the ear Hack them with cleavers Hang them with hooks in the hind legs  A wagonload of radishes on a summer morning Sprinkles of dew on the crimson purple balls The farmer on the seat dangles the reins on the rumps of  dapple gray horses The farmer s daughter with a basket of eggs dreams of a new hat to wear to the county fair   On the left and right hand side of the road  Marching corn I saw it knee high weeks ago now it is head high Tassels of red silk creep at the ends of the ears  I am the prairie mother of men waiting They are mine the threshing crews eating beefsteak the farm boys driving steers to the railroad cattle pens  They are mine the crowds of people at a Fourth of July basket picnic listening to a lawyer read the Declaration of Independence watching the pin wheels and Roman candles at night the young men and women two by two hunting the by paths and kissing bridges  They are mine the horses looking over a fence in the frost of late October saying good morning to the horses hauling wagons of rutabaga to market  They are mine the old zigzag rail fences the new barb wire  The cornhuskers wear leather on their hands There is no let up to the wind Blue bandannas are knotted at the ruddy chins  Fall time and winter apples take on the smoulder of the five o clock November sunset falltime leaves bonfires stubble the old things go and the earth is grizzled  The land and the people hold memories even among the ant hills and the angleworms among the toads and   wood roaches among grave stone writings rubbed out by the rain They keep old things that never grow old  The frost loosens corn husks The sun the rain the wind  loosen corn husks The men and women are helpers They are all cornhuskers together I see them late in the western evening  in a smoke red dust  The phantom of a yellow rooster flaunting a scarlet comb on top of a dung pile crying hallelujah to the streaks of daylight The phantom of an old hunting dog nosing in the underbrush for muskrats barking at a coon in a treetop at midnight chewing a bone chasing his tail round a corncrib  The phantom of an old workhorse taking the steel point of a plow across a forty acre field in spring hitched to a harrow in summer hitched to a wagon among corn shocks in fall  These phantoms come into the talk and wonder of people on the front porch of a farm house late summer nights  The shapes that are gone are here said an old man with a cob pipe in his teeth one night in Kansas with a hot wind on the alfalfa   Look at six eggs  In a mockingbird s nest  Listen to six mockingbirds Flinging follies of Oh be joyful Over the marshes and uplands  Look at songs  Hidden in eggs  When the morning sun is on the trumpet vine blossoms sing at the kitchen pans Shout All Over God s Heaven  When the rain slants on the potato hills and the sun plays a silver shaft on the last shower sing to the bush at the backyard fence Mighty Lak a Rose  When the icy sleet pounds on the storm windows and the house lifts to a great breath sing for the outside hills The Ole Sheep Done Know the Road the Young Lambs Must Find the Way  Spring slips back with a girl face calling always Any new songs for me Any new songs  O prairie girl be lonely singing dreaming waiting Your lover comes your child comes the years creep with toes of April rain on new turned sod  O prairie girl whoever leaves you only crimson poppies to talk with whoever puts a good by kiss on your lips and never comes back   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  There is a song deep as the fall time redhaws long as the layer of black loam we go to the shine of the morning star over the corn belt the wave line of dawn up a wheat valley  O prairie mother I am one of your boys I have loved the prairie as a man with a heart shot full of pain over love  Here I know I will hanker after nothing so much as one more sunrise or a sky moon of fire doubled to a river moon of water  I speak of new cities and new people  I tell you the past is a bucket of ashes  I tell you yesterday is a wind gone down a sun dropped in  the west I tell you there is nothing in the world only an ocean of to morrows a sky of to morrows  I am a brother of the cornhuskers who say at sundown To morrow is a day Carl Sandburg   ISLAND SONG  Look you the flesh how it has fallen away And that dear beauty of my youth The lips You loved to press they are grown cold enough With years and this poor heart that beat so high God it is like a stone within my breast I will sit down where the old women sit And pound the Awa with these withered hands I will chew beetle till my teeth are black That were like little pearls you said and spit With them My tongue shall be a wagging tongue For old wives tales and I shall learn to laugh At the low things they whisper leering still Half foolishly scratching their shrivelled thighs And trying to recall passion that s dead  Oh many a weary day  So our lives run When that first stroke is spent that drove the barque Against an ebbing tide We drift we fade Like Kepi blossoms drooping in the sun That the night knew for fragrance  Robert Paine Scripps   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MOONRISE  And who has seen the moon who has not seen Her rise from out the chamber of the deep Flushed and grand and naked as from the chamber Of finished bridegroom seen her rise and throw Confession of delight upon the wave Littering the waves with her own superscription Of bliss till all her lambent beauty shakes towards us Spread out and known at last and we are sure That beauty is a thing beyond the grave That perfect bright experience never falls To nothingness and time will dim the moon Sooner than our full consummation here In this odd life will tarnish or pass away  PEOPLE  The great gold apples of night Hang from the street s long bough  Dripping their light On the faces that drift below On the faces that drift and go Down the night time out of sight  In the wind s sad sough  The ripeness of these apples of night Distilling over me Makes sickening the white   D H Lawrence  Ghost flux of faces that hie Them endlessly endlessly by Without meaning or reason why  They ever should be  D H Lawrence  SACRAMENT  My body dear like bread I break For Love s sweet sake My soul like wine I give Each day that you may take And taking love and live  But when the altar empty lies Before my eyes The veil in twain is rent For me alone the sacrifice Has been a sacrament  Pauline D Partridge   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE TREES  The house is haunted by old trees So close they stand and still No yellow sunlight seeps through their shingled leaves And drips down on the sill Beech with the mist on his flanks Pine whose old voice is a muffled bell Gaunt wan bodied poplar That has a bitter smell Tapping elm and oak tree They stoop and peer within By the side of the twisted apple tree His grey hands under his chin They do nothing but peer and haunt through the windows That are dead as the eyes of the drowned And listen until their silence Makes a strangeness all around Then suddenly they quiver and shake at the wind Their arms that are furrowed as river sands And whisper Did you see to one another And beckon to one another with their hands And they laugh a hungry laughter There is no one understands  By night they creep close to the windows As quiet as grey lichens creep And pick at the catches with their fingers How they can get in and peep   Eloise Robinson  To see their own shadows thronging The quiet house of sleep Yes they look in at their own shadows Stealing up by the stair To the closed doors of the chambers And listening there They watch how their shadows with pulseless fingers Noiselessly push and strain And beat their breasts on the dark panels To open them in vain And how the thin moonlight trickles round them Creeping down by the banisters again  Eloise Robinson  CRÉPUSCULE  In all the lonely places and the hills By dusk comes down faint trumpeting it fills The hollows and the river banks with sound And music is like mist along the ground In all the forest paths and secret places The lilies seem like small forgotten faces And clothed in dimming gold and by our side With muted hoofs the dead contented ride  Maxwell Struthers Burt   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THERE WAS A ROSE  There was a rose that faded where it grew There was a bird that could not brook the wind There was a sunset whose wild glory thinned To nothing wonder and the night s ash hue Pale blossoms when they quicken count life sped And there were purple asters in the fall Of the cold year that withered by the wall And died with all spring s dreams about them dead  A rose a bird a sunset and a weed A blossom whose death sentence is its sky Yea and dead waves that break on sobbing seas Man is a faint frail brother with no creed These know not of Behold all things must die And all the vaunting ages are as these  AN OLD MAN S WEARINESS  I want to lie alone beside the sedges Where the dim faced waters are quietly singing There is peace there and a deep old happiness That the drake knows when he is tired of winging  The far heights and avoiding The craft of the grey hunter  I have long avoided the grey hunter Death And now I am weary and in much need of learning   Arthur L Phelps  What still peace is I need the voice of the sedges  That knows not any of the old earth yearning And its cry but is quiet Like the air and the water  Arthur L Phelps  THE SCREECH OWL  He sits all day in a cemetery tree The damp of sinking graves upon his breath Brooding the little ways of life and death  Chuckling at thought of immortality  Long rows of tombstones make his library Rare tomes of wit dry wit he seems to say He cons them till night comes then flies away  Into the dark to call for you or me  Or so when as a boy I heard his cry Grate the harp strings of night I thought it was A man 1 cross myself a boy still half As on that night I saw a dear friend die And long sat brooding on the patient stars And seemed to hear far off his mocking laugh  J E Scruggs   Le MÉDECIN MALGRÉ LUI  Oh I suppose I should Wash the walls of my office Polish the rust from My instruments and keep them Definitely in order Build shelves in The little laboratory Empty out the old stains Clean the bottles And refill them buy Another lens put My journals on edge instead of Letting them lie flat In heaps then begin Ten years back and Gradually Read them to date Cataloguing important Articles for ready reference I suppose I should Read the new books If to this I added A bill at the tailor s And the cleaner s And grew a decent beard And cultivated a look Of importance   William Carlos Williams  Who can tell I might be A credit to my Lady Happiness And never think anything But a white thought  William Carlos Williams  PLUMS  It is a waste of time to talk to my cousin about his plums Though I know  standing on the path with the sun in my hair I make a sufficiently pleasing picture The plums are soft with bloom and luscious purple If I took a step forward and held out my green smock Looked up and laughed at him He would throw them showering rain drops into my lap And quickly descending Slide his arm round my waist and probably kiss me Shall I go I wonder  No I will have none of these things  P T R   T O A PHRASE  I have been combing the sands of my thought for you You Who left me the trace of your fragrance In lieu of yourself A pungency as of sandalwood Or things lain long in lavender Very faint But of a stabbing sweetness Now that I have found you Your delicate coloring Which once delighted me Has faded in the wash of many tides Yet you can still Sting the tears to my eyes Little Phrase someone said to me long ago Who might have meant so much But who meant so little  But I think I have untangled you from the seaweed of forgotten things I think I shall toss you back into the sea  Hazel Hall   KALEIDOSCOPE  IN THE FRAIL WOOD  Marie Laurencin How she likened them to young gazelles Disporting in a quiet glade with their thin legs And their large wondering eyes Full of delicate trembling shy tender suspecting Furtively watching for the stranger in the wood  L éventail exquis la main d ivoire  Les yeux de gazelles glimmering provocative  _ Magic tumbling out of them like bronzed hoops Or circled ropes to dance with like gilded wire The hand touches a frail cheek and faints In its cushioned depths with the excess Of its palloring fragility  Light zephyrs hover over the edges of frail lace And roll from off dark coils of ribboned hair Great bird swings poised at the nape of the childish neck Setting out the white throat from the blue or rose shadow Blue and a far cerise with a gentle dove like grey Encircling them covering them with mists of timidity Speak they in concert of a little girl s morning As she steps frailly out of the linen and the lace That folded her young virgin limbs from the terrors Of the monstrous undivulging night Stepping out upon the edges of a world too bright With glinting facets of a diamonded despair   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Into the busy bustling world of young gazelles With their long thin legs tripping noiselessly Into the thronging glade of girlish hopes and fears In a harsh world where the folding and the unfolding Of tenderly sequined fans makes a living music For their anguished eye and ear And a wall to keep the beasty wolves from their fingertips And the tongues of hummingbirds distantly From their young and frightened throats I hear the hearts of little girls beating Against the hearts of the young gazelles It makes a white commotion in forests of thick pearl And their young white fingers waver as would Young jasmine buds on the fallen embers of the breeze  SPINSTERS  October in New England They are the gargoyles supporting old buttresses These virgins that roam wistfully among the ruins  Victims of an effete worship  Some of them love their father  Some of them love their mother  Some of them love themselves  Some of them watch for a sail  That will never skim their horizon They form the granite supports in the arches  Of old cathedrals and mausoleums with shut doors   They hold the rafters up whose lacework Is the fluttering place of bats There is a spacious cobweb covering all their nights With a dewless gossamer A stillness that is the speech of ice Consumes their swiftly gliding days They mother the owl and nurse the adder In their vacuous dreams Lost hopes run rivulets of despair Down their parchment cheeks They are rushing eagles without a sky Their pinions are drenched their heads droop And they cannot soar for the beating of the rain Soon and they will join their sisters the leafless trees Who stand like stone until the lightning strikes Them to the mouldy earth or a lusty axe Fells them to the ground for the evening fire Delicious would the blow of the axe seem With health and vigor and lust springing from the handle Leaves are they that droop when the first frost touches Their veins they coil together and wither on the stem Swaying and swirling to the earth Their eyes are like lanterns in the depths Of old cellars that are riddled with the years Deserted farms are they with the good grain gone The flax spun The fox eats the grapes the deer Pass furtively by on the edge of the dusk For the sweet apples fallen from the once young boughs   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  They search the cellar seeking the hummingbird And find the cutworm on the beam Gargoyles of stone soon the wind will have lifted The furrows from your brows and cheeks and hands Soon when the work of the wind and rain are done You shall have the youth of the dust upon you Then you can run and dance and blow And toy with the wind as if you had borne Litters of laughing children The dust is your sighing place When you have finished with the mottoes Of old gravestones here lies and what was good Graven in white words You shall yourselves have one  Bats breed in belfries hummingbirds on young boughs Spinsters you are the gargoyles for high towers The burr of the chestnut hides the meaty nut  HER DAUGHTER  She was so young so like a tigress Her large round eyes of jet and amber Lanceting one through from edge to edge And from side to side with a girl s ferocity Her hair was short also jet in hue With blue lustres in it and her lips were round And full and her breasts were round and full   And they shot through the black wool mesh Great shafts of jungle fire out at one She made no other overture  Following her upon the bridge made of young trees Turned so like dusted ivory with the heats and rains And fogs and early dews and mists Or as one would say blanched to a veritable white Her mother Her mother shaded by a parasol walked discreetly So many paces behind her so many paces Smiling at something surely not this Smiling with a vague enthusiasm For she was too old to laugh heartily about lusting flesh She had no breasts now and her eyes were rimmed With gold and there was no light and no heat in them Or any tendency to casual fervors  But she was young so like a tigress  Her very large round eyes of jet and amber  Lanceting through one from chest to spine  And from scalp to heel with a girl s ferocity  She had her lusty appointment with the sea  Her suit of black wool showed all of that  Her lips were not colored  And her hands were pale the mother had no breasts  This was certainly a fair exchange for the sea   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  AFTER BATTLE  I  I don t know where We re going to one said Tis but a week has sped Since I saw the blooming sun Up there where it is day And every day was fair How the water gurgles by the port I hear the tread Of dreadful waves Above my head Or is it just the sea Or is it just eternity They do not call us now Who have a sorrow On their brow  II I heard the thunder Climb the bleeding hill I heard it loud and then I heard it still They must have got some more For the long rows in our yard I heard someone implore How many have you heard   Marsden Hartley  And one said ten thousand One said not a word I heard the spades go clinking In our earth We must go clinking All we re worth The bright spades said For they are piling Up the youngest dead And they must have a place By heaven s grace There must be rest For those that cannot longer Heave a breast  III They speak of death Among deep roots of grass They speak of death Among deep waves of glass They tell of light and star and love But who shall ever them believe The earth is not the sea Nor sea the earth can be But death is much the same To them and me It is but one felicity  Marsden Hartley   POEMS BY CHILDREN  FAIRY FOOTSTEPS  AUTUMN SONG  I made a ring of leaves  On the autumn grass  I was a fairy queen all day  Inside the ring the wind wore sandals  Not to make a noise of going  The caterpillars like little snow men  Had wound themselves in their winter coats The hands of the trees were bare  And their fingers fluttered  I was a queen of yellow leaves and brown  And the redness of my fairy ring  Kept me warm For the wind blew near  Though he made no noise of going  And I hadn t a close made wrap  Like the caterpillars  Even a queen of fairies can be cold  When summer has forgotten and gone  Keep me warm red leaves  Don t let the frost tiptoe into my ring  On the magic grass  THE DREAM  When I slept I thought I was upon the mountain tops And this is my dream I saw the little people come out into the night I saw their wings glittering under the stars And crickets played all the tunes they knew It was so comfortable with light Stars a rainbow the moon The fairies had shiny crowns On their bright hair The bottoms of their little gowns were roses It was musical in the moony light   Hilda Conkling  And the fairy queen Oh it was all golden where she came With tiny pages on her trail She walked slowly to her high throne Slowly slowly to music And watched the dancing that went on All night long in star glitter On the mountain tops  BUTTERFLY  Butterfly  I like the way you wear your wings  Show me their colors  For the light is going  Spread out their edges of gold Before the Sandman puts me to sleep And evening murmurs by   EVENING Now it is dusky And the hermit thrush and the black and white warbler Are singing and answering together There is sweetness in the tree And fireflies are counting the leaves I like this country I like the way it has But I cannot forget my dream I had of the sea The gulls swinging and calling And the foamy towers of the waves  THUNDER SHOWER  The dark cloud raged Gone was the morning light The big drops darted down The storm stood tall on the rose trees And the bees that were getting honey Out of wet roses The hiding bees would not come out of the flowers Into the rain   RED CROSS SONG  When I heard the bees humming in the hive They were so busy about their honey I said to my mother What can I give What can I give to help the Red Cross And Mother said to me  You can give honey loo Honey of smiles Honey of love  ROSE MOSS  Little Rose moss beside the stone Are you lonely in the garden There are no friends of you And the birds are gone Shall I pick you  Little girl up by the hollyhock I am not lonely I feel the sun burning I hold light in my cup I have all the rain I want I think things to myself that you don t know And I listen to the talk of crickets I am not lonely But you may pick me And take me to your mother  THE CHAMPLAIN SANDMAN  The Sandman comes searching across the Bay He goes to all the houses he knows To put sand in little girls eyes That is why I go to my sleepy bed And why the lake gull leaves the moon alone There are no wings to moonlight any more Only the Sandman s hair  Hilda Conkling seven years old   Elmond Franklin McNaught  SPARKLES I See I am bringing you happiness  A great handful of cherry blooms  Hear that bird singing  The trees are full of witchery  And there s where we find poems  II  The rose bush is afire with roses I could make a flag of flowers The corn flowers are as deep as the blue And daisies are the flag s white stars  Ill  July is a time of fireworks  Some leave a trail of light like a comet  One is a rainbow  One makes a geyser of fire  And one an eddy of stars  These are foolish fires  Winter fire has thoughts  Elmond Franklin McNaught nine years old  IN THE MORNING  In the morning I hear the night Pitifully crying And the leaves Standing on their little arms Sing and sing In the daylight When the sun is rising It is so sweet To hear the trees dance For when they dance They sing a little song  For the people whom they love so  For those who are good they sing a good song  But for those who are bad they sing a bad song  And so it always goes  Juliana Allison Bond four years old   RIPPLES  THAT LITTLE GIRL NEXT DOOR  Evening  That little girl next door She always wants me to play with her I don t get time to water my flowers any more I don t get time to take care of my flowers I don t get time to do anything She just makes me play with her all the time I won t play with her any more When tomorrow morning comes I won t play with her I ll say You go away little girl I have to work I won t play with you ever any more I have to take care of my flowers  Morning  Mama that little girl next door Won t come out to play with me She has to work she has to help her Mama I saw her wiping a cup I don t think she ought to work so hard I think she ought to play with me I don t care if she rides my velocipede I don t care if she plays with My spade and wheel barrow She can play with 01 Mister Nichols And Amy Lowell and Turn Turn She won t break them She never breaks anything She can play with all my toys Mama you go over And tell that little girl next door To come over to our house to live We won t make her work all the time We won t make her work ever at all We will tell her to play every morning   Evans Krehbiel  LOGIC  You said God was near And tells me what to do If I can t see him he must be somewhere If he isn t outside of me He must be inside of me If I eat this egg It might land right on top Of God s head I don t think I can eat any more  TRAVELS  When I go to sleep In my bed My hair climbs up My eyes fall down The cover crawls around my back  My feet go up hill and down My hands float around The bed goes up in the sky The stars look at me The moon takes me Way up where God is My pillow wakes up  In the morning  And my feet want to get up  TREES  The trees Grow and blow And walk in a row Along the world  If they grow too high They will put God s eye  Out with their leaves  I like trees  Evans Krehbiel four years old  POETRY A Magazine of Verse COMMENT MR JEPSON S SLAM  MR EDGAR JEPSON a self appointed London critic of poetry author also of those epoch making novels  Happy Pollyooly The Terrible Twins Whittaker s Dukedom etc has quite obliterated POETRY and all its works in the May number of the English Review And Mr Burton Rascoe literary editor of the Chicago Tribune has quite obliterated Mr Jepson whoever he is in his summary of the latter s article in the Tribune of May 25th And Mr Jepson s happy phrase plopp eyed bungaroo descriptively applied to the Great hearted Young Westerner on the make no doubt We Us amp Co which has been started by B L T on a rapid journey up and down the various colyums will soon be as common coin as a five cent nickel And the editor of POETRY has wiped Mr Jepson off the map in an article recently sent to the editor of the English Review who will publish it unless he feels too sorry for Mr Jepson All this being the case it seems unnecessary for POETRY to do anything more it may go on its way rejoicing quite oblivious of its all British critic  Certain details of his arraignment however are amusing enough to give us pause Like Mr Rascoe we don t give a damn that Mr Jepson has no use for four of POETRY S fourteen prize winners he doesn t mention the other ten Messrs Lindsay Masters Frost and Head Neither are we moved by his scorn of Chicago as the seat of a new   school of poetry United States poetry and inferentially his scorn of the new school so seated The four prize winners above mentioned being abundantly able to take care of themselves will go on with their poem making in spite of Mr Jepson s anathema and Chicago the powerful will go on mirroring her new flowering beauty in Lake Michigan and her new flowering soul in her poets and other artists who will give a new glory to her fame that long ago crossed the world Indeed is not Spoon River already published in many languages has not the sky scraper traveled to many cities and is not one of our young radicals designing the new capital of Australia It is better to look forward than back more stimulating for a city to have her art history in the future than in the past Chicago needs no apologists rather should we say of her as Pericles said to his fellow citizens when the beauty of their metropolis was in the making You must yourselves realize the power of Athens and feed your eyes upon her from day to day until love of her fills your hearts  What does give us pause is Mr Jepson s praise rather than his blame In all POETRY S history covering five anda half years the only events or persons he mentions at all are the four poets above listed and Mr T S Eliot and the only event or person he mentions with approval is our discovery of the last named poet It should be explained that his article being on Recent United States Poetry does not take up the British side of our history   Perhaps I am ungrateful in having mixed feelings over this one item of praise We should consider it honor enough no doubt to present in the course of half a decade one poet worthy of Mr Jepson s laurel wreath Why shouldsmile in thinking of it and detect moreover a sympathetic smile on Mr Eliot s lips and the quiver of a wink in his left eye as he tries to wear the wreath gracefully It is not that I don t admire the combination Mr Eliot deserves all the honors that are coming to him But why is he the only American of all our tribe to win this tribute If Mr Jepson admires the fine ironies and sophisticated intuitions and decoratively balanced rhythms of Mr Eliot why is he so blind to Cloyd Head s delicate modern patterning of the human tragedy so deaf to the sombre yet whimsical emotional and musical motives of Wallace Stevens These men as well as Mr Eliot are super intellectuals and quite as profoundly as he are they stirred to the heart by the beauty and the sorrow of life as it is today Indeed their art gives the effect of having more behind it richer experience and sympathies if not deeper at least broader in range Can it be that Mr Jepson is unconsciously prejudiced in Mr Eliot s favor by the fact that he has left this barbaric land of plopp eyed bungaroos and gone into what seems to be alas permanent exile in a country truly civilized I pass over the probability that our critic s feeling has been stimulated if not by personal acquaintance with his favorite then by subtler atmospheric influences the fact that Mr Eliot is now very much in the air of influential   literary London It would be enough for Mr Jepson that Mr Eliot finds his native land intolerable indeed he says as much in his closing paragraph  It would be the last absurdity for such a poet to go West and write for that plopp eyed bungaroo the Great hearted Young Westerner on the make  Well in our humble opinion Mr Eliot s choice of exile has definitely narrowed the range of his art He is probably in less danger than Mr Jepson of identifying his hero Prufrock with the soul of America he knows better than that no doubt but like Henry James another superfine artist he has cut himself off from all possibility of expressing that soul by giving up the inward union with it and removing himself from the spiritual claim of it Making a wandering cosmopolite of himself he probably dooms his art again as Henry James did to the presentation of the various phases of that rather forlorn human type The Love song of J Alfred Prufrock is a masterpiece in precisely this kind it is doubtful if even its author will be able to surpass it But we protest that it is not the soul of America Listen to Mr Jepson  Could anything be more United States more of the soul of that modern land than The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock It is the very wailing testament of that soul with its cruel clarity of sophisticated vision its thin sophisticated emotions its sophisticated appreciation of a beauty and its sophisticated yearning for a beauty it cannot dare to make its own and so at last live  Such a statement is curiously typical of much foreign misunderstanding of us A certain kind of intellectualized stay at home Englishman falls in with the intellectualized   wandering American The two sympathetically admire the beauty of the old things the old ways in literature art and life and distrust and dislike the new Thus Prufrock s cruel clarity of sophisticated vision covers the western horizon for Mr Jepson becomes the soul of that modern land which we are informed is afraid to live  Of course Mr Jepson knows absolutely nothing about our soul Probably his plopp eyed bungaroo is nearer it than Mr Eliot s world weary hero But Mr Jepson has no longer the excuse of remoteness the soul of America a cross section of it so to speak has now crossed the sea and may be discovered by anyone who cares to get acquainted with our boys in the trenches They are of all kinds from farm and university factory office and forest range They are not afraid of life or death We commend them to Mr Jepson H M  THE NEW POSTAL RATE This office has been bombarded of late by arguments against the new zone rate for periodicals which goes into effect July first The Authors League the Publishers Association and other objectors tell us that the new law should be repealed as it means the death of the magazines of popular education in a great measure and of American literature Well we are not yet convinced For years this nation has been giving as President Taft once put it a subsidy of over fifty millions a year to the periodicals This was   questionable policy even in time of peace as abuses usually grow up around subsidies In time of war it would seem obvious that the magazine business should cease to demand help from the government but should pay full cost for the carriage of its products like farmers and manufacturers  It is probable that the educative value of periodical literature would not be impaired The present system tends to centralize and standardize American literature By enabling the publisher of Collier s for example to send his paper to San Francisco as cheaply as to Albany it discourages spontaneous self expression through local publishers in San Francisco and encourages a marketable New York point of view By enabling the Collier s man to send a mass of advertisements over the country at government expense it makes him publish his paper to distribute these ads instead of to distribute the educative literature it contains Thus however noble his intentions his paper is forced to print only the most popular thing the thing which the people will buy in such numbers as to impart enormous value to the advertisements Writers who can and will supply this purely commercial demand are thus forced more and more to a standard when they conform they get a large audience and enormous prices prices out of all relation to the literary or educative value of their product  Local self government in intellectual matters would be we believe vastly more educative and vastly better for literature than the present domination of New York And local self government will be enhanced by the new law   In various respects the new law should tend somewhat to de commercialize the magazines at any rate it will put them on a just basis before a people at war It will increase POETRY S bill for postage more in proportion to income than that of the Saturday Evening Post But POETRY is not howling and probably both magazines will survive the change H M  REVIEWS  AS OTHERS SEE US  The New Poetry An Anthology edited by Harriet Monroe  and Alice Corbin Henderson Macmillan Co  The spirit which led the editors of The New Poetry in their approach to the problem of selecting an anthology of modern American and British verse which should be hospitable to all poets entitled to a place therein is happily embodied in Robert Frost s intriguing line  Something there is that doesn t love a wall The portcullis of Carl Sandburg s hog butcher of the world has been lowered in democratic fashion to an hundred and one men and women all the alphabetical way from Conrad Aiken to Edith Wyatt Lyrist and imagist sonneteer and Vorticist lover of Attica in modern guise and proclaimer of New England after the fashion of Homer priest of form and neophyte of freedom the ism and the anti ism which is just as passionate an ism each is permitted to argue his case It is apparent to be sure that   several folk who have distinguished themselves since the year 1900 have been excluded or overlooked and others who are included are not represented by what some of us consider their best effort and still others are included whom the same some of us would have excluded or overlooked I regret for example the absence of two such individualists as Marianne Moore and Mina Loy artists who represent respectively the intellectual and the moral independence of the modern woman and both of whom were recently graced with the paternal approbation of no less a mortal than Mr Pound And a book which hobnobs with aristocrats from every stratum of thought should not have snubbed that prince of Fifth Avenue Donald Evans who with his amazing nonchalance of style might likewise be termed the prince of poet satirists In the Irish galaxy there should have been humble domicile for the Dublin singer W M Letts On the other hand while I do not miss Alfred Noyes or Lascelles Abercrombie who belong to the Victorian limbo I am more than gently irritated by the presence of mouthing poetasters and rhetoricians of the stamp of Hamlin Garland William Ellery Leonard Percy Mack aye James Oppenheim Charles Hanson Towne and Louis Untermeyer Luckily there is compensation in the exile imposed upon Jessie B Rittenhouse Clinton Scollard Seumas O Sheel George Sylvester Viereck and their ilk It is obvious that I am not an expert in cataloguing names nor for that matter a well read man so permit me to open for myself the volume per se advancing like the editors   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  from A to Z Isn t that all so called criticism amounts to The impressions I offer touching upon only the most significant or the most widely advertised of the denizens of The New Poetry are neither arbitrary nor impersonal neither infallible nor final  It is impossible for me to enthuse about the work of Conrad Aiken I admire the man and critic but not the poet He is hemmed in by electicism the poetical and an affectation of method due perhaps to that ancient enemy of the creative faculty inhibition I don t question his integrity as a man and critic but the poet in him is too often a mockingbird Richard Aldington one of the most potent forces of the days when Mr Pound was the Barnum of imagism is a shadow of the poet who wrote Choricos Choricos is a magnificent dirge with an authentic rhythm and choice of language The Poplar is as fine a tree poem as the new movement has contributed and Lesbia an effusion containing at least five famous lines one of them a quotation Popularity and too much publicity have since led Aldington from art to cleverness Walter Conrad Arensberg is richer and poorer through a scholarship which begets and hampers expression Nevertheless Voyage à L Infini is more than a tour de force Scholarship only intrudes far enough to polish an idea which is as original as it is profound As a rule William Rose Benêt is tiresome He abuses the foot rule and at the same time fails to remove its traces after his carpentry job is finished He is too often that damnable citizen the facile craftsman I prefer the work of his   younger brother Stephen Vincent Benêt Maxwell Bodenheim was at one time my arch enthusiasm Today he represents for me the arch example of the man who fits Renoir s warning Success is harder to combat than poverty Bodenheim is joined in this combat by the great majority of poets who have deservedly won the reputation which is theirs They find it impossible to throw away the prize of a style perfected through the most arduous labor In other words they are as self imitative as the average sonneteer is imitative of the past academic form prevails over a form naturally evolved from new adventuring Bodenheim has made a fetish of his extraordinarily rich gift for images His greatest strength is his greatest weakness Rupert Brooke is tremendously overrated Witter Bynner like Aiken is often threatened with that bugaboo the poetical However it does not scare away an easy flow of lyricism which is native to Bynner The three poems To Celia are lovely persuasive songs which do not require the aid of wild eyed controversy Joseph Campbell is a better imagist than some of the imagists themselves At Harvest and On Waking sway to provocative cadences Skipwith Cannell who has not been writing for the past three or four years is well represented by The Red Bridge and The King Primarily Cannéll s influences are two such varied forces as the Bible and the Russian ballet to which he has added a note of personal scorn which is healthier than the mawkish optimism so often mistaken for a virile attitude towards living Padraic Colum sings quietly and with straightfor   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ward diction about Irish folk His jovial nature and unaffected narrative style move forward like companionable horses dragging along the themes of country life Adelaide Crapsey a courageous human hewing out tiny five line etchings as huge as mountains with death peering out from behind should go down in American poetic lore with Emily Dickinson Death was the earthly victor after a short struggle but life will cherish her art for years to come I am tempted to continue the same strain around H D and why should I be ashamed of so doing Aren t women a valiant and integral part of the renascence of American poetry H D is the finest of the imagists and the single one who has maintained an unflagging devotion to what one might call the best a fellow can attempt The selection made by the editors reflects credit on all three women concerned Still another woman Mary Carolyn Davies of California might if she would but simply refuses to measure up with the three preceding poets When first I saw her work I turned somersaults of pleasure Here was a girl expressing the girl consciousness with delightful naivete But Miss Davies came to New York grew popular joined the Poetry Society of America and sold yards of verse to editors Walter de la Mare is my favorite English poet Whimsical sorrow inventing tunes which are as simple and as subtle as Schubert do not require analysis And analysis would only lose the duel T S Eliot s two long poems Portrait of a Lady and The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock easily confute the recent statement of that overrated pudding of   As Others See Us  conceit Mr H L Mencken who asseverates not only that a long poem is an act of criminal procedure but that a story is lost when told in verse Eliot is an exquisite satirist with an uncanny power for intricate narrative Major Arthur Davison Ficke is another member of the fraternity of poetical poets When John Gould Fletcher is good he is almost the best of Americans when he is bad he is almost the worst If one is concerned only with a man s magnificent qualities Fletcher will pass the glittering gate His Irradiations of which four are quoted and The Blue Symphony a splendidly sustained composition belong to an earlier period of Fletcher s expression He is the experimenter among the imagists and as such is certain to emerge from the rut in which he is traveling at present F S Flint is the least significant of the imagists He contributed several lovely poems to the first imagist anthology some of which have been chosen by the editors Sentimentality is the bain of Flint Need one spill further rhetoric in behalf of Robert Frost He is a greater poet than any of the early New Englanders which has probably been said by another Wilfrid Wilson Gibson leading imitator of John Masefield is a literateur patronizing the lowly Perhaps that is why he is so popular with the intelligenzia Ralph Hodgson is responsible for my favorite Eve poem For this my heart holds him blessed The poem is not included in The New Poetry Helen Hoyt makes a genuine appeal in her woman poems Had she the courage of a Rousseau we might eventually learn what this thing called woman   is But she is often side tracked by her Puritanical forebears Orrick Johns Songs of Deliverance are Whitman esque in their breadth of feeling and eloquence of expression I wish there had been room as well for his Country Rhymes originally presented in POETRY They well nigh stamp Johns as our finest American lyrist It was William Gillette wasn t it who said that if a man speaks well of himself nobody believes him if he speaks ill everybody believes him So I leave the work of a certain A K to others i D H Lawrence is a poet who writes good novels whether in verse or prose His prime fault is exaggeration He doesn t fit into imagist anthologies Vachel Lindsay the Billy Sunday Ty Cobb and Bert Williams of poetry has made art out of vaudeville and then again and alas vaudeville out of art He has immortalized rag time Amy Lowell is represented by her best poem Patterns by an atrocious piece of journalism 1777 and some miscellaneous numbers The Lowell following is to me one of the mysteries of this planet she is facile prolific a reader of good books a genius as a propagandist and a scintillating lady but she has contributed absolutely nothing which is new to poetry For this sin may Hell pardon me John Masefield though a greater poet than Amy Lowell is not a great poet George Moore said of Victor Hugo that his novels live along the same level of excellence which expresses my objection to Masefield By way of luring me still closer to Beelzebub along comes Edgar Lee Masters Spoon River is universal material handled by an islander The   idea is supernaturally unusual the handling ordinary Anybody with a name like Edna St Vincent Millay cannot avoid writing poetry Popularity has been getting its vulgar hand into her work but she has enough Irish in her for a come back some day Ezra Pound Let me replenish and relight my pipe Pound is the enfant terrible of modern verse but not quite as terrible as he and some others consider him Behind his leer and braggadocio lurks a circumspect consciousness as to the past as to what his neighbors in the Elysium to come will think of him He is the most brilliant and most versatile of Americans but when he is more concerned with himself and less with outsiders and their opinions the true Ezra will emerge His prose is more Ezraian than his poetry What is the fare one way  to Hindustan Among those who are concerned with tradition for the form of their thought Edwin Arlington Robinson is clearly the chief of present day poets for he has been enhanced instead of retarded by tradition Isms and movements and men of momentary lustre come and go Robinson remains In his fashion he is the proudest name in American letters When Carl Sandburg is deaf to propaganda to the call of the bleacher fans he can toe the plate with any slugger on the diamond and drive the outfielders to the fences Like Hans Wagner he misses many an easy one but show him the wings of a fast one farewell A writer who is rarely advertised but who deserves advertising is Clara Shanafelt For sheer artistry for intricate originality of thinking and its component evocation into   marvellously lovely patterns and rhythms the self conceit I own by nature of being a human doffs its cap to Wallace Stevens In his fashion he is the equal of Robinson He has invented more free forms than any other devotee of free verse Sandburg once said of him that he can be reread more frequently than any other I leave conjecture in re Rabindranath Tagore to the woman s club and the university professor All three are above me If honesty is still an admirable virtue I believe it lives in disrepute William Carlos Williams deserves a garland with which he would hang you There is no cleaner man There are folk to be sure who denounce his cleanliness as filth As an artist he is erratic he has not arrived as they say But many who have arrived unfortunately there are too many are through Williams will never be through A few of his best poems are worth a library of the so called successful  The New Poetry is the most valuable anthology of modern verse yet published Any anthology has faults which arise from the viewpoint of the beholder assign the work to him and he would have produced a better volume But even the most derogatory critic has had to admit that The New Poetry affords an adequate retrospect of the renascence of American verse And towards this renascence for the most part six or seven years old the editors have contributed more than the combined efforts of the commercially endowed editors of The Atlantic Harper s The Century et al When I say this I say something for no one person has   As Others See Us  quibbled more valiantly with this or that phase of the Harriet Monroe doctrine than your humble servant I say this or that because I have never doubted the general policy of POETRY even though my particular breed of poetasting was politely rejected for three consecutive years so that Uncle Bill Reedy once ejaculated that I had to publish my own magazine to see my stuff in print  As to the present moment of American verse I am pessimistic as the above screed possibly argues I feel that for the past year or two most of our poets have been merely repeating themselves and erecting a new academy from a radical cornerstone I have followed American art in all its manifestations with all the passion I possess over a period of about eighteen years only to discover that the average American artist falls sooner or later into the maw of success and its material twin commercialism Or he is turned aside from his real pursuit or vigil by some issue far less vital than self expression and by the self I mean that force ing into wedlock of the inner with the outer self which makes for the broadest individualism and which renders a man a citizen of the world The war may or may not be responsible for this present moment Aside from this I feel about the war that nobody will be able to press it into the service of art until it has receded into the shadow of fablehood when the values of the war shall become as apparent as the values in Homer s epic around the fable of Troy or those in the Shakespearean symphonic stories around Italy Denmark and England The terrible business is so huge   and so close well that German sunbeam as Irwin Cobb calls Schopenhauer once said that even a small object held close to the eye limits and distorts our field of vision and the war is no small object  Miss Monroe s Introduction an unostentatious statement of the facts of the present studied in the light of English poetic history is opportune in view of the car loads of controversial mis statement shunted by the admirers as well as the detractors of modern poets This happy foreword defines the general ideals of the new in acceptance of and opposition to the old they follow the great tradition when they seek a vehicle suited to their own epoch and their own creative mood and resolutely reject all others It traces concisely and accurately the story of English poetic history bringing out in relief the pioneers Chaucer and Langland Burns Coleridge Keats Shelley and Byron with a particular reference to the influence wrought by them over the story of to day and the added influence of such factors as the Bible the Orient Greece Italy the Celt remote France and the France of the nineties which re introduced Whitman to America and it concludes with an hypothetical appraisement of the place held by to day between yesterday and to morrow The pessimism implied in the preceding paragraph doubtless finds a retort in Miss Monroe s quiet prophecy that our poets have the qualities of pioneers who look forward not backward and who may lead on further than we can see as yet to new domains of the ever conquering spirit of beauty Alfred Kreymborg   MR O NEIL S CARVINGS  A Cabinet of Jade by David O Neil Four Seas Co  T o this book in spite of the redundant lyricism on the cover of it people who have long breathed the somewhat heavy and fulsome air of our poetic renascence may come to cool off and forget for awhile It is tiny and delicate and nowhere large and it defies and breaks down even the author s efforts as in the misintroductory Quo Vadis to make it a little overwhelming to use it for large ideas or ideals  The best poems show an artist with clear keen and selective eyes In them the image is clean and perfectly self sufficient the expression of a purely contemplative poet as in First Love  At the window she watches Down the lane His coming shadow Like a quiet pool Flecked by the wind Her heart quivers  And in a few others like this Peasant Thought Tramping The Beach and in Vernal Impulse when the startled lovers turn with a look of conscious oneness in their eyes in these brevity aloofness from nearly any emotion and plain music go to make up vivid pictures so swift that one sees them rather than reads them Also very fine are others of a symbolic character where the image is the true and direct vision of the artist and the symbol is therefore inseparable from it arising from it as if by magic The symbolism of these poems is not obvious that is the symbol has   not been mechanically forced into the image or vice versa might say impressionistically that if we were to ignore the suggestion in them which we cannot do since the suggestion is intrinsic we could still enjoy them as neat and powerfully short presentation Here to justify my paradox is Wantlessness  Out West Where there is boundless freedom Where distances tire the mind I saw storm drenched ponies Dejected motionless With liberty to do But not knowing what  As good as this and I really wish I could quote them are Lime Light Nakedness The Prodigal Son and that fine short song The River  Unfortunately there are others and they are in greater quantity in which the image being unauthentic the symbol is inevitably false Enslaved Walt Whitman Amor Omnia Vincit Love Aftermath The Answer An Epitaph A Character Lights show either obesity or leanness two aspects of impotence And others which I would call the more personal poems of the book mostly love poems are full of stale grandiloquence and sentimentality two other aspects of impotence  Mr O Neil s brevity is lightness delicacy and spontaneity and the healthy exclusion of rhetoric vagueness and excrescences of thought old things that are ever so copious in this our too prosperous poetic era But that brevity is also smallness of content Although naked washed cool looking and perfumed the book is slim and weak Emanuel Carnevali  MR BYNNER AT GRENSTONE  Grenstone Poems A Sequence by Witter Bynner Fred  A Stokes Co  Although published later Grenstone Poems is certainly in the main of earlier composition than The New World which appeared in 1915 for it shows the author at a stage not so near as The New World to achieving for his utterance its own style and voice Perhaps it is the impression of the book as a whole rather than any individual poem that seems most strongly echo ish And the effect is not unpleasant even when the derivation is most distinct as in the pieces that inherit from A Shropshire Lad gifts of feeling and grace which they all but make their own For the workmanship is delicate and though the book as a whole would bear considerable cutting away the poems themselves are always compact God s Acre which is short enough to quote is typical of Grenstone quality  Because we felt there could not be A mowing in reality So white and feathery blown and gay With blossoms of wild caraway I said to Celia Let us trace The secret of this pleasant place We knew some deeper beauty lay Below the bloom of caraway And when we bent the white aside We came to paupers who had died Rough wooden shingles row on row And God s name written there John Doe H H  CORRESPONDENCE  OF PURITANS PHILISTINES AND PESSIMISTS  Dear Editor You hit the nail on the head in your editorial on Mr Bourne s article Traps for the Unwary in The Dial only you might have hit harder For it is significant in connection with Miss Lowell s Tendencies in American Poetry which Mr Bourne praises that out of the six poets represented Carl Sandburg John Gould Fletcher and H D were first published and introduced by POETRY and Edgar Lee Masters and Robert Frost received in it their first appreciation But perhaps Mr Bourne does not consider POETRY one of the little magazines he mentions so slightingly Indeed Mr Frost s The Code appeared in POETRY before his general American acclaim and Mr Pound s review of Mr Frost preceded by some time the more heralded article by Mr Garnett in The Atlantic  What Miss Lowell s book accomplishes for these poets is a greater measure of publicity to be valued of course and its chief merit is the outline given of the poet s personality his history etc As criticism it clears up nothing except that it escapes the Philistine and Puritan traps although not in the measure proclaimed by Mr Bourne being tinged with both in given places The book is based on a purely fictitious scheme of evolution with no historical background and only the critic s desire that the scheme should be so to make it so Miss Lowell s book is enjoyable in many ways but it can hardly be held up as a model of criticism even negatively   as Mr Bourne would have us believe Witness the Puritan point of view in her treatment of the sex motive in Edgar Lee Masters work so insistent as to be amusing  Criticism of course that weighs and balances only after the event is indeed of little consequence to the artist The only criticism that is of value to the artist and to his contemporaries is contemporaneous criticism the kind that is perfectly able to navigate in an uncharted sea take soundings and proclaim new depths and new shores We have too little of this in the United States indeed except in POETRY and the other little magazines I don t know where to look for it Why should the critics cry out continually upon the need of this criticism instead of giving it to us Who will deliver us from the parlor pessimism of Mr Bourne and Mr Van Wyck Brooks whose article On Creating a Usable Past in a succeeding number of The Dial is of the same breed as Mr Bourne s giving the critics and the professors the entire responsibility and lamenting their bankruptcy Incidentally one cannot help being amused by Mr Brooks short sighted one sided dig at Vachel Lindsay who has succeeded in creating for himself not only a usable past but a usable present as well which is certainly something that Mr Brooks has not been able to achieve for himself I think that everything I have read of Mr Brooks criticism has amounted to an almost complete negation of our present and an exceedingly doubtful hope for our future hardly what one would call the most creative sort of a matrix  A C H   AN ANTHOLOGY OF 1842 Dear POETRY Have you reflected that these days of the revival of poetry are not unlike those of seventy five years ago when America was waking up to the art and anthologies were almost as numerous as now Time has obscured many names then brilliant and added to the lustre of others will it treat our decisions with similar scorn I have here a copy of Griswold s Poets and Poetry of America published in 1842 in which Edgar Allan Poe is represented by three poems Emerson by five Longfellow by eleven Whittier by twelve Holmes by fifteen and Bryant by twenty At the same time there are eighty two other names familiar only to the specialist in the history of American poetry Lowell is represented by four poems and eight sonnets and Charles Fenno Hoffman by forty five exercises in verse Of course much of what is now our great American inheritance was not written in 1842 but the selection is none the less significant Edgar Allan Poe three poems and Lydia Sigourney seventeen Moreover the epidemic of Annuals from The Atlantic Souvenir through all the twenty years of Gems Opals Caskets Wreaths significant juxtaposition Amulets Keepsakes Brides Nuns and Fair Penitents is somewhat similar to the outbreak that followed The Lyric Year of 1912 It makes my blood boil when I think of Griswold s grandfatherly patronage of Poe and the harm he has done Poe s reputation in the minds of the children of darkness But Poe could be trusted safely to emerge from the mass   of poseurs and dilettanti and the cheerful thing about the retribution is that now Griswold is remembered because of Poe and not Poe because of Griswold  Willard Wattles NOTES  Of the poets represented in this number four need no introduction Mr Carl Sandburg
