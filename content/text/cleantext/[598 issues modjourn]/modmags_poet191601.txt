JANUARY 1916  POEMS  ONE CITY ONLY  NE city only of all I have lived in And one house of that city belong to me I remember the mellow light of afternoon Slanting across brick buildings on the water  And small boats at rest on the floating tide And larger boats at rest in the near by harbor And I know the tidal smell and the smell of mud Uncovering oyster flats and the brown bare toes of small  negroes With the mud oozing between them And the little figures leaping from log to log And the white children playing among them  remember how I played among them And I remember the recessed windows of the gloomy halls   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In the darkness of decaying grandeur The feel of cool linen in the cavernous bed And the window curtain swaying gently In the night air All the half hushed noises of the street In the southern town And the thrill of life Like a hand in the dark With its felt indeterminate meaning I remember that I knew there the stirring of passion Fear and the knowledge of sin Tragedy laughter death   And I remember too on a dead Sunday afternoon In the twilight When there was no one else in the house My self suddenly separated itself And left me alone So that the world lay about me lifeless I could not touch it or feel it or see it Yet I was there The sensation lingers Only the most vital threads Hold me at all to living Yet I only live truly when I think of that house Only enter then into being  One city only of all I have lived in And one house of that city belong to me   Music  MUSIC  The ancient songs Pass deathward mournfully  R A  The old songs Die  Yes the old songs die  Cold lips that sang them  Cold lips that sang them The old songs die  And the lips that sang them Are only a pinch of dust  I saw in Pamplona In a musty museum I saw in Pamplona In a buff colored museum I saw in Pamplona A memorial Of the dead violinist I saw in Pamplona A memorial Of Pablo Sarasate  Dust was inch deep on the cases Dust on the stick pins and satins Dust on the badges and orders On the wreath from the oak of Guernica   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The old songs Die And the lips that sang them Wreaths withered and dusty Cuff buttons with royal insignia These in a musty museum Are all that is left of Sarasate  TH E POOL  Do you remember the dark pool at Nimes The pool that had no bottom Shadowed by Druids ere the Romans came Dark still with little bubbles rising So quietly level with its rim of stone That one stood shuddering with the breathless fear Of one short step  My little sister stood beside the pool As dark as that of Nimes I saw her white face as she took the plunge I could not follow her although I tried The silver bubbles circled to the brink And then the water parted With dream white face my little sister rose Dripping from that dark pool and took the hands Outstretched to meet her   The Pool  I may not speak to her of all she s seen She may not speak to me of all she knows Because her words mean nothing She chooses them As one to whom our language is quite strange As children make queer words with lettered blocks Before they know the way   My little sister stood beside the pool I could not plunge in with her though I tried  APPARITIONS  I  A thin gray shadow on the edge of thought Hiding its wounds These are the wounds of sorrow It was my hand that made them And this gray shadow that resembles you Is my own heart weeping You sleep quietly beneath the shade Of willows in the south  II  When the cold dawn stood above the house tops Too late I remembered the cry In the night of a wild bird flying Through the rain filled sky   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COLOR NOTE  The yellow street lamp by the lake Leaps out against the turquoise sky And there s a patch of amethyst Where the old snow drifts lie The russet leaves of maple and oak Catch in the corner of the eye And all because that yellow flame Sets up its piercing little cry  SONG  A king s but a puppet A lover a fool A sage is a wise man Who was never at school  Then why should I bother To read in a book The world is my fancy Wherever I look  Alice Corbin   SUMMER DAWN  Tem Eyos Kwï  She comes Tem Eyos Kwi The maiden who has known love Last night Love touched her in the house of waiting Love hid the seeds of life in her garments In the wind of her walking they are scattered All the sod will bloom with them  None shall be lost because of her gladness the gladness of love known  Ah hi i She sees the earth not as we see it We who were not overtaken by Love in the house of waiting  Wake women maidens and wives Greet Tem Eyos Kwi Greet her with feet dancing With songs of the heart and lips trembling to silence Hands that lift their wonder to the breast Yet touch not the flesh  Wake sons lovers young chiefs hunters with arrows I Sharpen the darts make strong bend the bow Keen keen as light and clear as the wind be your eyes The women await you in secret places They have hidden themselves in the leafy shelters All the green leagues of the forest are ashake with invitation   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The quick beating of their hearts is the whisper along the bending grass The sod grows warm O men Summer dawn is the spirit of the women  They have washed their hearts with prayer And their bodies with juices of cedar Perfumed and dried by the wind they have come up from  the shore The great hosts of the women Unwrapping themselves from the mists of the morning They have entered the forest with the footfalls of muted  music With light tossing steps like the spray on long beaches The swinging trees drip dew With lines of sparkling rain they point the way the women  have gone Leaving all the paths to them open  Harken They follow Tem Eyos Kwi singing  Come come O swift and strong We are the women seek us Our hearts like little swallows nest above the secret pools Oh say shall not the winged dart pierce And the shadow of the bended bow Stir the still deep pools Oh the waters shall sparkle and leap and mingle And brim at your lips O men   Summer Dawn  They shall be poured out and drip upon a chief s feet They shall fill the hollows of his house with children Flowing in laughter and whispers and little cries As smoke through the smoke hole at evening Ai ah ai Women Waken the soil with freshets Bear joy upward as a canoe with sails swifter than paddles O men hunters of life We are the harborers the fosterers the women Seek us  It was the women the harborers the fosterers who rose first And followed Tem Eyos Kwi They called to the men  The men go forth like one Lightning and heat are their weapons hurled crashing be  fore them Their hairs spreading wide give black wings to the sun As a cloud filled with eagles blown up from the sea They enter the forest with the tramp of thunder and the  darkness of storm And the song of the women is stilled The cry of offering ascends it passes the swooping shadows There is a sigh through the forest of winds sinking Then the hush  On the leaves is a sweet whisper of rain Whispered sweetness of pangs past The warm soil drinks the coolness of tears   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Tears that are dropping melodies Because cunning hands and strong have shaken the living cords The skies part the black wings fold The Sun chief s canoe rides on the upper blue with furled  sails Tem Eyos Kwi laughing is at the paddle Our village is drenched with light Ai i Tem Eyos Kwi is glad because Love has overtaken us Because now we see the earth as she sees it Two by two they come up from the forest the men and  the women The women s smiles are the little sun tipped clouds Floating across the face of the mountain The look in their eyes is deeper than the seas High in the light the men lift their heads On their clear brows is the mystic mark Of those from whom a great dream has gone forth Firmly they hold the hands of the women Who have given peace to their strength and a meaning Together together the race makers enter the lodges  KAN IL LAK TH E SINGER  TO NAK KU  Nak Ku desired Thine eyes speak gifts But thy hands are empty   To Nak Ku  Thy lips draw me Like morning s flame on a song bird s wing I follow but thy kiss is denied I am a hunter alone in a forest of silence Under what bough Are the warm wings of thy kiss folded  Amid the scent of berries drying From my high roof I have seen the dusky sea Trip rustlingly along the sand floors In little moccasins of silver moon broidered with shells of  longing Ah thy little moccasins Nak Ku But thy feet recede from me like ebbing tides  I have closed my door The heavy cedar blanket hangs before it Since thou comest not Better that my narrow pine couch seem wide as a winter field The moon makes silver shadows on my floor through the  poplars The wind rustles the leaves Swaying the boughs o er the smoke hole The little silver shadows run toward my couch Ah hi Nak Ku  I hear the pattering of women on the sand paths Fluttered laughs bird whisperings before my lodge Oh lover lover   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Brave little fingers tap upon the cedar blanket But I do not open my door Better this grief I am thy poet Nak Ku Faithful to her who has given me Dreams  NAK KU ANSWERS  I have given dreams to Kan il Lak the singer  Oh what care I Kan il Lak Though thy hut be full of witches Thy lips melody flown before their kisses Know I not that all women Must to the singer bring their gifts Know I not that to the singer comes at last His hour of gift judging  I will lie like a moonbeam in thy heart  A hundred gifts shall fall regarded not But where among the dust of forgetfulness The one pearl shell is found Pure faint flushed with longing The deeps no man has seen Brimming its lyric mouth with mystical murmurs There shalt thou pause And render me thy song  Constance Lindsay Skinner   FOOTNOTES  I MAGDALEN  God made my body slim and white  To be men s torture and men s delight  God made my heart a wayside inn  And there the guests keep merry din  God left my soul a lamp unlit  But only God ever thinks of it  II HARVEST  I sowed my thought like seed  Up sprang a noxious weed  I shall sow my thought again a flower may be the meed My thought is hard and cold The soil is worn and old  What if marybuds should rise and turn the earth to gold  III  I who had sought God blindly in the skies Listening for heaven to thunder forth my name Waiting for doves descending to my head Looking to see the bushes burst in flame   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Went from the temple with a weary throng Of questions in my soul and told my grief To the heart of the yellow flower with the scent Of citrus clinging to its pointed leaf  IV  I shall not sing again of love I weary of the old unrest But like a hangman love has burned His crimson emblem on my breast  But like a hangman love has set A crimson scar my heart above Yea I am wearied with old pain I shall not sing again of love  V  I took my sorrow into the woods Saying Nature will bend to me And hold me close and her quiet moods Shall be as physician and friend to me  Looking to hear her rivers sigh Because my heart was worn with grief To hark the thunders break her sky To catch the moan of her aspen leaf   Footnotes  I carried my sorrow to Nature s breast And behold her sky was the gladdest blue And a laughing demon her breeze possessed How did I dream that Nature knew  VI  Lips you were not anhungered for And those that won your praises A century hence will blossom out In little purple daisies  Eyes that smiled lightly into yours And eyes that frowned on you Ah soon not Love himself might know The brown eyes from the blue  Yes even he will come to dust And even beauty passes That crumbling flesh may feed the growth Of the hungry rooted grasses  VII  Behind the house is the millet plot And past the millet the stile And then a hill where melilot Grows with wild camomile   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  There was a youth who bade me goodby Where the hill rises to meet the sky I think my heart broke but I have forgot All but the scent of the white melilot  VIII  Though you should whisper Of what made her weep She would not hear you She is asleep  Though you should taunt her With ancient heart break She would not listen She is awake  Passion would find her Too cold for dishonor Candles beside her Roses upon her  IX  Now have I conquered that which made me sad The bitterness and anguish and regret Yea I have conquered it And yet and yet  The moaning of the doves will drive me mad  Muna Lee    THE HOME COMING  SCENE A room in a house half demolished by shell fire on a deserted battlefield Indistinct figure of an old woman Enter another figure like a young soldier through a half open door  Old Woman Is that you Charles Young Soldier Yes Granny where are you Old Woman I am here in the corner Charles How did  you escape from the battle Young Soldier I do not know but here I am as you can  see Old Woman I do not see you very plainly Charles Young Soldier I cannot see you at all Granny Old Woman I tell you I am here in the corner Young Soldier Very well Granny I begin to see you now Old Woman Please close the door behind you I would  not have it open for a minute with all those strange noises  about Young Soldier I cannot close the door Granny It must  have been jammed by the explosion Old Woman But it has been swinging in the wind Young Soldier Yes but I cannot close it Where are all  the others Old Woman They went away in a big cart Young Soldier Is Margaret safe Old Woman She went away in the cart   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Young Soldier Why did not you go  Old Woman I am too old to leave the house where I was born I hid myself and your father said they could not waste time looking for me  Young Soldier How long before the firing began did they  leave Old Woman About an hour I think Young Soldier Then they must all be killed Old Woman Yes perhaps Young Soldier They might have hidden in the hills Old Woman They did not have time War is terrible  for poor people Charles  Young Soldier It is indeed If you could see the things I have seen Our field and the old barn are all torn and the bridge over the brook is blown up  Old Woman It is very terrible to think of Young Soldier Granny Old Woman Yes Charles Young Soldier If I tell you something you must not be  frightened Old Woman I will try not to be Young Soldier I am only a ghost Granny I am lying dead  out there with my eyes open I could not close them any more than I could close the door Old Woman Now I can tell you Charles I am only a ghost too my body is lying in the cellar Young Soldier You were killed when the shell blew the house to pieces   The Home Coming  Old Woman Yes Charles Young Soldier What shall we do now Granny Old Woman We can do nothing but linger now Per  haps when the war is over we shall die completely  Ralph Cheever Dunning   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  UNDER THE TREES  I sit a stone Empty black diffuse one with this spongy mould and quiet I sit bleak and friable and a wind whistles itself quietly into distance And the trees chink the fairy gold which is so thin so cold so immeasurably remote All is become metallic Salt bitter very still  Inert I sit And all the débris of ten thousand years snows me under Godlike inert bleak and friable porous like black earth I sit where quietly pitters the ruin of ten thousand years  John Rodker   SAINT JOHN OF NEPOMUC  Last summer I Columbused John in Prague that deadly  Bush League town I d quit em cold on pictures and cathedrals for awhile I hung around for Ma and Sis Good Lord there wasn t  one they d miss Pale martyrs till you couldn t sleep Madonnas by the mile  I read some dope in Baedeker about a tablet on the bridge And how they slipped this poor old scout the double cross for fair I m off high brow historic truck but Father John of Nepomuc You must admit he was the goods Believe me he was  there  The king was Wenzel Number Four John was sky pilot for the court King gets a hunch that Mrs King has something on her mind He goes to sleuthing more and more He says Gadzooks I ll have their gore Don t ever let em string you on that bunk that love is blind  The queen I ll bet she was some queen she tangoes blithely on her way   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  She fails to see the storm clouds on her regal husband s dome I got him guessed that Wenzel guy harpoons a girl that s young and spry And tries to seal her up for life in the Old Peoples Home  The way I had it figured out she married him to please her folks Our son in law the Kink you know Some speed I guess that s poor So when she sights a Maiden s Dream some real live wire that s made the team Well she sits up and notices like any girl Why sure  Old Wenzel can t quite cinch the case but what he doesn t  know he thinks The lump he calls a heart congeals beneath his fancy vest He sends for poor old Father John and says as follows  I am on I merely lack a few details What hath the queen confessed  He holds the court upon the bridge Speak up he says or otherwise These spears shall thrust you down to death Come through I am the king Kick in What did my spouse confess The queen sends frantic S O S Maybe I sort of dozed but well here s how I got this thing    Saint John of Nepomuc  He saw the startled courtiers straining their ears He saw the white queen swaying striving to stand He saw the soldiers tensely gripping their spears Waiting the king s command He heard small page drawing a sobbing breath He heard a bird s call poignant and sweet and low He heard the rush of the river spelling death Mocking him down below  But he only said My liege  To my honor you lay siege  And that fortress you can never overthrow  He thought of how he had led them all the years He thought of how he had served them death and birth He thought of healing their hates stilling their fears Humbly he weighed his worth He knew he was leaving them far from the goal He knew with a deep joy it was safe and wise He knew that now the pale queen s pitiful soul Would awake and arise  And he only said My king  Every argument you bring  Merely sets my duty forth in sterner guise  He felt the spears points merciless thrust him down  He felt the exquisite fierce glory of pain  He felt the bright waves eager reaching to drown  Engulf him body and brain   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He sensed cries faint and clamorous far behind He sensed cool peace and the buoyant arms of love He sensed like a beacon clear beckoning kind Five stars floating above   To the ones who watched it seemed That he slept and smiled and dreamed And the waters were abated and the dove  And there I was on that old bridge boob freshman me on that same bridge The lazy river hummed and purred and sang a sleepy song Of course I know it listens queer but gad it was so real and near I stood there basking in the sun for goodness knows how long  Sometimes I see it even now I see that little lean old saint Put up against the shining spears his simple nerve and pluck And once by Jove you know he came right down beside me  in the game We know who made the touchdown then old John of Nepomuc  Ruth Comfort Mitchell   LATIN QUARTER WAYS  STUDENTS  John Brown and Jeanne at Fontainebleau Twas Toussaint just a year ago Crimson and copper was the glow Of all the woods at Fontainebleau They peered into that ancient well And watched the slow torch as it fell John gave the keeper two whole sous And Jeanne that smile with which she woos John Brown to folly So they lose The Paris train But never mind All Saints are rustling in the wind And there s an inn a crackling fire It s deux cinquante but Jeanne s desire There s dinner candles country wine Jeanne s lips philosophy divine  There was a bosquet at Saint Cloud Wherein John s picture of her grew To be a Salon masterpiece Till the rain fell that would not cease Through one long alley how they raced Twas gold and brown and all a waste Of matted leaves moss interlaced Shades of mad queens and hunter kings   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And thorn sharp feet of dryad things Were company to their wanderings Then rain and darkness on them drew The rich folks motors honked and flew They hailed an old cab heaven for two The bright Champs Elysées at last Though the cab crawled it sped too fast  Paris upspringing white and gold Flamboyant arch and high enscrolled War sculpture big Napoleonic Fierce chargers angels histrionic The royal sweep of gardened spaces The pomp and whirl of columned Places The Rive Gauche age old gay and gray The impasse and the loved café The tempting tidy little shops The convent walls the glimpsed tree tops Book stalls old men like dwarfs in plays Talk work and Latin Quarter ways  May Robinson s the chestnut trees  Were ever crowds as gay as these The quick pale waiters on a run The round green tables one by one Hidden away in amorous bowers Lilac laburnum s golden showers Kiss clink of glasses laughter heard   Students  And nightingales quite undeterred And then that last extravagance O Jeanne a single amber glance Will pay him Let s play millionaire For just two hours on princely fare At some hotel where lovers dine A deux and pledge across the wine They find a damask breakfast room Where stiff silk roses range their bloom The garçon has a splendid way Of bearing in grand déjeuner Then to be left alone alone  High up above Rue Castiglione Curtained away from all the rude Rumors in silken solitude And John her head upon your knees Time waits for moments such as these

horror at a misapplied Sauce Béarnaise He supervises with a noble air The ignorant s menu The little mademoiselle from Maine Mais oui Red wine and pot au feu  Some twenty years ago he boiled the mash

maiden aunts dropped in or better clambered up For impecunious Blanche was always perched tip top She painted hard and won a Salon prize Then something happened Oh her tell tale eyes The man went back I think No money so what use And she as lovely as a fawn let loose In Fontainebleau and with that infant s face Her age it s hard to guess Oh yes a studio place Terrors behind the screen a divan and all that Goes out to tea with the same picture hat At blank Grande Chaumière you know the number Where certain rules the gaiety encumber Jests of her griefs so gallantly Yes poor in truth So she s a

Elizabethans feel when the young Shakespeare tried his first experiments on them when he passed from the graceful romancing of the Two Gentlemen of Verona to the living symbolism of A Midsummer Night s Dream Did Molière s provincial audiences confess a thrill beyond the common when the obscure player mad with genius strutted through his early parts And that London publisher who first read the manuscript of Wuthering Heights did a wind from the moors put out his guttering candle and hale him through the dark Did these people know what was happening Was their little personal emotion their pleasure of the moment seized and swept on into timeless spaces of wonder and joy A little of this larger thrill shook me twice last month The first time was at the Chicago Little Theatre where I watched Mr Maurice Browne and his company play the one act tragedy Grotesques by Mr Cloyd Head Was it possible that we were really doing something Could it be that a young poet here in boiling and bubbling Chicago was seeing visions and setting them forth in a new strange form too beautiful to die Was I listening to a bold interpreter of the mystery and poetry of life one who felt and could suggest its magic and despair Mr Head s thesis is by no means new what thesis or theory is new in these latter days but he weaves it into a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  new design he makes us feel it with a new poignancy Life as a shadow play men and women as puppets moved by a master experimentalist for gods who like the audience are kind but wish to be amused as they sit with staring eyes something like this we have heard for thousands of years And the key to the special motive of this poet s decoration the black and white panorama through which his breathing puppets move is to be found of course in Aubrey Beards ley or even if we search further in Japanese prints and Chinese art of the great ages But every artist builds on the past If this poet young and unknown can line up his brief tragedy with these masterpieces he is offering us a large measure to judge him by and we owe him the record of a triumph  Mr Head s Prospero his omnipotent weaver of dreams is Capulchard who with his first speech takes the centre of the black and white stage the framed in decoration beyond which lifeless figures collapsed immovable await behind the veil their chance to appear  This is a forest that is a Grotesque  You will find the forest somewhere in your thought  Its trees are graphic like an arabesque  The pale moon shines I touch it with my hand  I dip the water from the brook beneath  And fling it high among the leaves like dew  The effect is there although the fact is not  So shall all things here seem illusory  We need not follow the wizard hero s work as he lifts his human puppets into the frame and puts them through their paces of passion and sorrow Through symbols he   Grotesques and Overtones  makes strange magic with a sword thrust into a man s right hand he creates the Warrior with a robe and crown on a woman s brow and shoulders he makes a Queen And  through their clashing drama of love and war he moves his figures but always escaping the obvious always omitting  the anti climax the routine That ends all well  For as he says  Why hunt your pleasure to its death Ignore the ending trace a new design I own to a real thrill when the man or the Man motif  as the poet puts it rebels crying We ll make our own design  and Capulchard exclaiming sardonically  how slight A breath would puff them pell mell into space And free the canvas for another theme  marches them through a new round of experience before the Ultimate critics in Olympian chairs  At last when rebellion becomes blasphemy when the tortured grotesques fling defiance  will no longer bow The prey of gods 1  and Capulchard rises to full power saying  They shall have freedom even as they wish Freedom beyond their wish freedom complete I And even the gods shall hesitate to laugh  when stripping moon and stars from the sky he sends his beings of an hour out into the void the thrill becomes an exaltation a shiver of spiritual sympathy with the poet s vision   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  One could hardly say too much for the beauty of the presentation But that was to be expected for Mr Browne poet and dramatic artist that he is is perhaps the only manager who could work out with complete delicacy the pictorial and theatrical subtleties of the theme Already those of us who love the poetic drama are deeply in his debt Who that has seen The Trojan Women or Medea at the Chicago Little Theatre has failed of conviction that the Greek drama is available for the modern stage in a wider sense than the strictest academic rules might approve And who can see Mrs Browne as Medea without recognizing a great tragic actress an actress moreover capable of amazing variety as her impersonation of broad comedy parts especially old women proves  I have left little space for praise of Overtones the strangely imaginative one act piece in which Miss Alice Gerstenberg proves her ability in poetic comedy as Mr Head in poetic tragedy Not that this play is in verse if that makes any difference As I saw it given with the author in the cast by the Lake Forest Players I paid once more to perfect art the tribute of spiritual exaltation for the Primitive Selves of those two much mannered women seemed really supernatural shadows endowed with flesh embodied desires  Twice in one month the poetic drama alive modern and magical by Chicago playwrights on little Chicago stages Let us have more and let us not be afraid to salute the miracle when it comes H M   Remy de Gourmont  REMY DE GOURMONT  Remy de Gourmont is dead and the world s light is darkened This is another of the crimes of the war for M de Gourmont was only fifty seven and if he had not been worried to death if he had not been grieved to death by the cessation of all that has been life as he understood it there was no reason why we should not have had more of his work and his company  He is as much dead of the war as if he had died in the trenches and he left with almost the same words on his lips Nothing is being done in Paris nothing can be done faute de combatants There was an elegy on current writing by him in the Mercure It was almost the same tone in which Gaudier Brzeska wrote to me a few days before he was shot at Neuville St Vaast Is anything of importance or even of interest going on in the world I mean the artistic London  M de Gourmont is irreplaceable I think I do not write for myself alone when I say no other Frenchman could have died leaving so personal a sense of loss in the minds of many young men who had never laid eyes on him Some fames and reputations are like that Mallarmé is almost a mantram a word for conjuring A critique of M de Gourmont s poetry would be by no means a critique of M de Gourmont s influence For again I think that every young man in London whose work is worth considering at all has felt that in Paris existed this gracious presence this final and kindly tribunal where all work would stand on its merits   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  One had this sense of absolute fairness no prestige no overemphasis could work upon it  Permettre à ceux qui en valent la peine d écrire franchement ce qu il pense seul plaisir d un écrivain these were almost the last words he wrote to me save a postscript on the outside of the envelope and they are almost his whole law and gospel And indeed a right understanding of them means the whole civilization of letters  Outside a small circle in Paris and a few scattered groups elsewhere this civilization does not exist Yet the phrase is so plain and simple to permit those who are worth it to write frankly what they think  That is the end of all rhetoric and of all journalism By end I do not mean goal or ambition I mean that when a nation or a group of men or an editor arrives at the state of mind where he really understands that phrase rhetoric and journalism are done with The true aristocracy is founded permanent and indestructible It is also the end of logrolling the end of the British school of criticism for the preservation of orderly and innocuous persons It is the end of that gravity to which Sterne alludes as a mysterious carriage of the body to cover the defects of the mind  M de Gourmont did not make over statements His Diomedes is a hero because he is facing life he is facing it quite sincerely with no protection whatever Ibsen with his smoky lightning had rumbled out There is no intermediator between God and man M de Gourmont with his perfect and gracious placidity had implied yes implied made   Remy de Gourmont  apparent rather than stated that no formula can stand between man and life or rather that no creed no dogma can protect the thinking man from looking at life directly forming his own thought from his own sensuous contact and from his contact with thoughts  Nietzsche has done no harm in France because France has understood that thought can exist apart from action that it is perfectly fitting and expedient clearly to think certain things which it is neither fitting nor expedient to spoil by action  Spoil by action is perhaps a bad memory of the phrase but just as Dante was able to consider two thoughts as blending and giving off music so Diomedes in De Gourmont s story is able to think things which translation into action would spoil As for Diomedes career I am perfectly willing to accept Robert Frost s statement that there is nothing like it in New England What there is in all provincial places is an attempt to suppress part of the evidence to present life out of proportion with itself squared to fit some local formula of respectability  Remy de Gourmont had written all his life in absolute single mindedness it was to express his thought his delicate subtle quiet and absolutely untrammeled revery with no regard whatsoever for existing belief with no after thought or beside thought either to conform or to avoid conforming That is the sainthood of literature  I think I can show what I mean almost by a single sentence In the midst of the present whirlwind of abuse he said   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  quietly By Kultur the Germans mean what we mean by state education  It had been so all his life on whatever matter however slight the matter or however strong his own passion there had been that same quiet precision that same ultimate justness  The rest of us oh the rest of us are caught in the flurry of controversy Remy de Gourmont had found it might not be incorrect to say that Paris had given him a place where all things could be said quietly and openly where one would not think of circumlocution and prejudice where circumlocution and prejudice would have seemed unnatural  En tous les pays il y a un noyau de bons esprits d esprits libres Il faut leur donner quelque chose qui les change de la fadeur des magazines quelque chose qui leur donne confiance en eux mêmes et leur soit un point d appui  That is good news but for years M de Gourmont had believed it and written accordingly He had written self lessly and was glad when other men could write well He dared to write for the few for the few who are not a clique or a faction but who are united by the ability to think clearly and who do not attempt to warp or to smother this faculty who do not suppress part of the evidence  The significance of M de Gourmont and the significance of his poetry are two things apart He has written for the most part beautiful prose much controversy a book on Le Latin Mystique du Moyen Age etc He has written a poème champêtre and some Litanies  I have praised these litanies elsewhere and a man s obitu   Remy de Gourmont  ary notice is not perhaps the best place for analyzing his metric Suffice it to say that the litanies are a marvel of rhythm that they have not been followed or repeated that M de Gourmont was not of the young French school If he is grouped anywhere he must be grouped as poet among les symbolistes The litanies are evocation not statement  M de Gourmont was indubitably of the young in the sense that his mind had not lost its vigor that he was alive to contemporary impressions that he had not gone gaga over Catholicism like poor Francis Jammes nor wallowed in metrical journalism like the ill starred Paul Fort He had never lost touch with the men born ten or twenty years after he was for a man of fifty seven that is a very considerable achievement Or rather it is not an achievement for it can not be done by effort it can only come from a natural freshness and aliveness of the mind and is a matter of temperament  I had forgotten the French Academy until an article in L Humanité reminded me that M de Gourmont was not a member thereof that the ancient association which contains Auguste Swallou Thibaudet de Mimmil and so many other immortals had not seen fit to elect him It is evident that the Académie Françoise has outlived its usefulness and if France does not set an example what can be expected of other academies In M de Gourmont s case the academy had no excuse He had not only written supremely but he had given back to the world a lost beauty in Le Latin    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Mystique in the Sequaire of Goddeschalk with its Amas ut facias pulchram  But perhaps as a friend of mine wrote when Swinburne was refused sepulture in Westminster Abbey they said there was no room and buried the canon s wife the week after perhaps as my friend wrote at the time perhaps it is just as well he suffered fools badly  I have known also that the really distinguished member at a meeting of another great body encouraged one of his more serious colleagues who was showing signs of tedium with Come come we are not here to enjoy ourselves  M de Gourmont has gone  Blandula tenulla vagula almost with a jest on his lips for his satire on M Croquant et la Guerre continues in the current Mercure  Ezra Pound  REVIEWS  MISS LOWELL ON FRENCH POETS  Six French Poets Studies in Contemporary Literature by  Amy Lowell Macmillan  This is fine bookmaking beautiful paper beautiful print Yet I entered upon the studies with a slight dread that I should find bewildering classifications waters of modern technique in which I should flounder helplessly Not at all The book is clear sailing from title page to colophon sounding its message straight out The essays are written in a   Miss Lowell on French Poets  scholarly way and they form I think the first book on the subject in the English language It is a curious choice of poets in some respects I could wish to see it include Jean Moréas or Fernand Gregh whose poetry has a subtle and glowing quality or perhaps others But it is a very important work One is spared the tediousness of exploring volume after volume and is given a generous supply of the best poems of each of the six men carefully selected by one who is herself a distinguished poet  The impression left by Emile Verhaeren is one of greatness and charm His is an austere yet mobile mind Miss Lowell tells us that the Flemish character is made up of two parts one composed of violent and brutal animal spirit the other of strange unreasoning mysticism This is why Verhaeren is capable of being sodden with drink capable too of the highest flights of the soul He believed in mankind and his poems express the common passions of the race Here we have no superficialities signals of false successes but a pen dipped in truth Rhymes yes he used them all the time even in vers libre But these French rhymes or is it that our ears are so attuned to the dailiness of the English do not shout at you We are rhymes they efface themselves His colors are fiery furious his beauties engloomed by factory smoke but his words are opals with strange bright flashes Here is a lovely thing  Le vent se noue et s entrelace et se dénoue  et puis soudain s enfuit jusqu aux vergers luisants  là bas où les pommiers pareils à des paons blancs  nacre et soleil lui font la roue   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Here is the very feel of a storm  Un poing d effroi tord les villages  Les hauts chochers dans les lointains  Envoient l écho de leurs tocsins  Bondir de plage en plage  Such a storm may well typify all of Verhaeren s work before the war that storm which was to lick up cities and meadows and leave in him the finest flower of a ruined country  Albert Samain is like the slow trickle of water from a faucet in comparison with the giant billow preceding him in the book Yet the lover of biography will delight in the story of this lonely sensitive life as revealed by the tender touch of the author She calls him a minor poet and says of his work It is chamber music as tenuous and plaintive as that played by old eighteenth century orchestras It is full of charm but too often it lacks the bold stroke of origination Elle écoute la vie au loin comme la mer has a familiar flavor The dedication of Au Jardin de l Infante is beautiful yet Gautier might have written it He too uses the rhyme even extols it in his verse And isn t this lovely  De vers silencieux et sans rythme et sans trame Où la rime sans bruit glisse comme une rame I forget who has said L âme n existe pas pour ellemême ou du moins on ne peut la connaître mais elle reflète celles qui s y mirent Here we have Remy de Gourmont He said The sole excuse which a man can have for writing is to write down himself to unveil for others the sort of world which mirrors itself in his individual glass The   Miss Lowell on French Poets  author excuses her inclusion of this poet on the ground of his great influence upon the generation of writers that has followed his Gourmont s poetical output is small as compared with his work in other fields but it is full of sweet sound and fresh with color Les Feuilles Mortes is hauntingly beautiful  Herri de Régnier is a symboliste poet an Immortal and an acknowledged master of French prose receiving the mantle slowly dropping from the shoulders of Anatole France His younger poems though powerful are more or less the happy expression of unhappy moods Oh but the haunting lines the dripping words Un à un et un encor adorable Of his masterpiece Le Vase the first poem in the division of Les Roseaux de la Flûte Miss Lowell says It is the most perfect presentation of the creative faculty at work that I know of in any literature I wish I might give here all its wonder and warmth  Je sentais sur mes mains amoureux ou farouches Des souffles de naseaux ou des baisers de bouche From Les Médailles d Argile I take this fragment which makes one ache for the whole J ai dit encor Écoute Écoute Il y a quelqu un derrière l écho Debout parmi la vie universelle Et qui porte l arc double et le double flambeau Et qui est nous Divinement In La Sandale Ailée one of his later books which contains little else to impress the reader Septembre in vers libre   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  shows De Régnier in a new light and is a notable poem Here we have at last a soul set free from its masters Miss Lowell says  Admitting him to be in poetry the voice of a vanishing quarter of a century he is still the greatest French poet alive to day and one of the greatest poets that France has ever had  Francis Jammes more than any other of these six poets compels our love For he loves animals birds insects trees loves them with kindness compassion understanding And he loves periwinkles He is distinctly a modern and his works far from recording the graceful writhings of pain are voices of serenity Sometimes his language might be called by the undiscriminating childish This is because his words not childish at all are but clothed with the delicate shades of young spring Nevertheless in sweetness and simplicity his mind is akin to that of a child Francis Jammes is a charming child on one side says Miss Lowell and a most lovable genius on the other But a man of mature and balanced intellect he certainly is not She goes on to say that he is still in the prime of life and that he has had a powerful effect upon the younger generation  Paul Fort like Jammes sets his heart to the sun He writes mostly in the Alexandrine and he prints his poems as prose the rhymes becoming evident only when read I refrain from quoting him as there are so many riches that I do not know where to choose Besides one should discover for oneself Joachim La Fille Morte dans ses Amours Les Baisers a delicious little poem and the great poem Henri III which Miss Lowell calls his masterpiece   Miss Lowell on French Poets  Six French Poets is a book to be read It makes one feel that in comparison with many poets who write in English these Frenchmen have lived more largely the eternal verities of which poems are made A L  THE FIRST MODERN Some Love Songs of Petrarch Translated and Annotated and with a Biographical Introduction by William Dudley Foulke LL D Oxford University Press Petrarch has been called fairly enough the first modern He was the earliest example in our era of the literary man who lived by his writings the first to make his emotions pay the first to turn personal feelings into fame and fortune He survives to our times chiefly through his sonnets and canzoni of some of which Dr William Dudley Foulke of Indianapolis now offers a translation The sonnets in which Petrarch celebrates his love for Laura are not in translation the most interesting and varied reading in the world Sonneteering is largely a sort of game and Petrarch one may choose to think was a poet first and a lover afterward However a good measure of interest may be got out of these new versions by anyone who possessing some knowledge of Italian and some taste for sport reads them with Petrarch in one hand and Mr Foulke in the other He will be constantly surprised and pleased by dexterities and felicities and will rest on the opinion that the work is very tastefully and adequately done In many instances the translator has made things easier for himself by using the Shakespearean form of the sonnet   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  instead of the Petrarchan and in some of the canzoni there has been a partial sacrifice of the elaborate rhyme schemes But such slackening of rigor doubtless works for ease and fluency In some instances a happy shifting of lines produces an effect that seems to surpass the original Thus the following lines  And he who never knew her tender sighs Nor heard her gentle words or laughter gay Knows not how Love can heal how Love can slay  may be felt to make a more striking close than these  Non sa come Amor sana e come ancide Chi non sa come dolce ella sospira E come dolce parla e dolce ride  Another vigorous and decisive fourteenth line is this No wound is healed by slackening the bow which fully equals the original  Piaga per allentar d arco non sana  The choice of sonnets for translation seems sometimes arbitrary several that are highly esteemed by the Italians themselves are omitted among them Solo e pensoso Chi vuol veder Ne mai pietosa madre Che fai che pensi and the one on Vaucluse itself but the chief war horses among the canzoni such as Chiare fresche e dolci acque and Vergine bella che di sol vestita are rendered with distinguished success though with the modifications already noted  The volume is much more than its simple title would indicate It contains among other matters a well considered introduction an elaborate biography of the poet appendices dealing with the real Laura etc The introduction offers   The First Modern  translations of certain sonnets and canzoni that are unrelated to Laura A more tonic air and a manlier fibre are felt in the sonnet on the corruption of the papal court at Avignon and in the great trumpet toned ode Italia mia in which the poet calls upon the rulers of Italy to cease their mutual enmities and to unite in freeing Italy from the stranger a cry that half a millenium was required to make effective  On the whole Mr Foulke s volume gives and gives well about all that the average modern reader may need with regard to the second of the great Italian poets H B F  NEW POETS  Vision of War by Lincoln Colcord Macmillan  It is scarcely in our province to discuss Mr Colcord s thesis which seems to be that in a world unworthy of peace a world in which peace is only meaner war war is not only natural and necessary but the most effectual means of stimulating the life of the spirit He says The spirit seems to fail in peace and be revived in war And again  Whenever men die for a cause mistaken or not misled or not there truth advances an imperceptible degree If our business were with Mr Colcord s philosophy we might insist that dying for a cause is all very well but that killing for a cause is of more doubtful spiritual value and that it is the killers rather than the dead who survive We might argue that those meaner wars of peace which Mr Colcord scorns have advanced are advancing the date of democracy and brotherly love more than all the slaughter   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of this year and the last that war merely confuses the issue by substituting the outworn romanticism of a feudal society for the slow conquests those meaner wars again of their rights by the common people the workers of the world It may be as this poet says in one of his wiser moments that the world will have war until it deserves peace that men will fight until they really love one another but again are not the struggles of peace rather than the slaughter of war the means by which truth advances an imperceptible degree  In short I would say that Mr Colcord s thinking is soft emotional and quite incapable of logical analysis a restatement of many oft exploded platitudes of the militaristic ideal with its usual evasions and omissions If as a philosopher Mr Colcord is negligible what then of Mr Colcord as a poet Does his poem transcend thought Is there a magic in it which may make men mad or a truth beyond thinking which may inspire and exalt them  If he is a poet right or wrong we may not brush him aside What of Nietzsche for example It may be that the world is afire today because of the fierce power of his vision and the incomparable beauty of his prose poetry rhythms It is not wine alone that makes men drunk  I must admit that I think Mr Colcord a poet Though much of his Whitmanesque verse is merely prose argument or eloquence he rises at times to a powerful chanting rhythm which inspired as it is by a high spiritual sincerity sweeps across one s questions with its affirmation of beauty This rhythm is scarcely to be judged by brief extracts it needs   New Poets  space And no brief extract can give the brazen clang of the refrain which he uses in certain sections of the poem Therefore I apologize for quoting the following passage as a mere first hint of the poet s music and argument  Are there no signs then only hope unseen obscure Our spirits fail 1 Give us a sign give us a sign  Take heart take heart my brother 1 Oh sometimes I think that there are nothing but signs Signs in the sky Signs in the stirring sea Signs running along  the ground like fire Signs in the swaying parliaments Signs in the trembling courts Signs in the stifled press Signs in the sundering schools 1 Signs in disintegrating governments Signs in ancient authorities fiercely defied Signs in alarmed society Signs in quick arming wealth in  quicklier arming poverty Signs in the life the heart the spirit of the average man Nothing but signs I say Nothing but signs And they are signs of war  H M  A Little Book of Local Verse by Howard Mumford Jones La Crosse Wis Here is a promising first book a tiny pamphlet pri  vately printed by a young poet who is still a college student It was read with interest recently in the POETRY office by a poet a few years older and much better known who made the following notations  Worth notice somewhat too full of adjectives in spots also somewhat too much like Carman s Songs from Vagabondia The best are the last poem You who have read this book Old Men A Red Leaf Anent the Street cars and Railway Sketches These show fancy a rare quality From Trempealeau has gleams of imagination and the walking songs are good POETRY A Magazine of Verse  With this verdict I agree in the main There is an excellent simplicity in Mr Jones style and honesty in his themes And he does not stop with the surface he sees through Besides the poems mentioned above I like this one The Movies  They sit like shadows in the playhouse dim Through half an hour s film of smiles and tears They watch life like a shadow flow That cannot speak but only walks and feels One thing they do not know Within the darkened playhouse of the years Themselves like moving pictures come and go Upon the film of Time in seven reels For entertainment of the seraphim  H M  CORRESPONDENCE  I  Dear Editor I want to submit the following poem which I think should be interesting and educative especially to our friends the imagists the polyrhythmists and other vers libertines It is not only to my mind an excellent piece of grotesque imagism but a remarkable experiment in color and strange cadences The poem follows  TIOTIO TIOTIO TIOTINX  An enchanted nightingale sits on a red coral bough In the silent sea Singing a song of the loves of my ancestors Pearls peer curiously from their shells Strange water flowers shiver with emotion Wise sea snails with iridescent Chinese towers on their backs Crawl out to listen Sea roses blush with a pink confusion  Correspondence  Sharp yellow creatures shaped like stars  And jelly fish with a million hues  Quiver and stretch  Everything is alive  The bright swarm crowds and listens   The above lines were written by Heinrich Heine They may be found in the second series of the Reisebilder in the fifth chapter of the subdivision The Book of Ideas published in April 1827 Louis Untermeyer  II  Dear Editor Padraic Colum in his recent article in the New Republic accuses the Imagists of egoism and quotes together part of a poem by Byron and one of Aldington s to prove the latter egoistic He even goes so far as to say that Landor Landor who wrote  I strove with none for none was worth my strife was not egoistic And of course the Imagists are There is no excuse for a lyric poet if he is not going to tell us about himself about his innermost emotions his inner being What business has a poet to try to write about something of which he knows nothing which is foreign to himself None whatever All poets and not poets only but all men of ability have been and are bound to be egoists It is simply a question of self respect Aldington gives in his poem the emotions he experienced and his shock of horror and pity on finding in the streets a girl he once knew Byron years after parting from the lady hears her name spoken and wonders why she deceived   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  him and was unfaithful Mr Colum fails to quote the last stanza In silence I grieve That thy heart could forget  Thy spirit deceive Byron flattered himself into thinking himself irresistible Could egoism go further Yet both poems are beautiful What therefore becomes of Colum s argument Nothing  John Gould Fletcher  III  Another correspondent informs POETRY that Alan Seeger the young American poet member of the Foreign Legion of the French army whom we mourned as dead in a recent issue is now reported alive and well We rejoice with his other friends and commend our obituary to his indulgent attention NOTE ABOUT PRIZES  Once
