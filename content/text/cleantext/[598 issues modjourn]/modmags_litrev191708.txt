Propped upon pillowsrouge on the pallor of her faceShe would not have us sad because she is lying thereAnd when she meets our gaze her eyes are laughter lit Her speech a wicked tale that we may vie

YeatsCuala PressDundrumDublin1 2 shillingsTo begin with one of the more recentI have already sent a longer review of John Yeat s letters to Poetry on the ground that this selection from them contains much valuable criticism of the art to which that periodical isdevoted I again call attention to the book for its humanismfor its author s freedom from the disease of the ageIt is goodfor America in particularthat some even minded criticwriting in detachmentwithout thought of publicationshould have recorded his meditationsThere can be no supposition that he hoped to start a social reformCarlos Williams wrote a few years ago Nowhere the subtleeverywhere the electric Quibblers at once began a wrangle about the subtlety of electricityWe can not massacre the ergoteur wholesalebut we might at least learn to ignore himto segregate him into such camps as theNew Statesmanand theNew Republic to leave him with his system ofgraduated gruntsand his criticalapparatus his picayune little slot machineJohn Yeats writes as a man who has refused to be stampededhe has not been melted into the crowdthebuttonmoulderhas not remade himHe praises solitude now and thenbut he has not withdrawn himself into a pseudo Thoreauian wildernessnor attempted romantesque BorrovianaLest weof this generation and decadeimagine that all things began with usit is well to note that a man over seventy has freed himself from the effects of theGreat Expositionand of Carlyle and Wordsworth and Arnold perhaps he never fell under the marasmusI have met men even older than MrJohn Yeatsmen who remembered the writings of the French eighteenth centuryThey had endured the droughand kept a former age s richnessWhen I sayremembered the writings of the French The Little Review 7 eighteenth century I mean that they had received the effect of these writings as it were at first handthey had got it out of the airthere is a later set who took it up as a specialityalmost a fanaticismthey are differentThen there came the bad generationa generation of sticksThey are what we have had to put up withJames Joyce s NovelThe EgoistLondonBWHuebschNew YorkA PORTRAIT of the Artist as a Young Man was so well reviewed in the April number of this paper that I might perhaps refrain from further commentI have indeed little to addbut I would reaffirm all that I have yet said or written of the bookbeginning in The Egoistcontinuing in The DramaetcJoyce is the best prose writer of my decadeWyndham Lewis s Tarr is the only contemporary novel that can compare with A PortraitTarr being more inventivemore volcanicandnot so well written And that last comparison is perhaps viciousIt would be ridiculous to measure Dostoevsky with the T Square of FlaubertEqually with Joyce and Lewisthe two men are so differentthe two methods are so different that it is rash to attempt comparisonsNeither can I attempt to predict which will find the greater number of readersall the readers who matter will certainly read both of the booksAs for Joyceperhaps Jean de Bosschère will pardon me if I quote from a post card which he wrote me on beginning A PortraitIt wasnaturallynot intended for publicationbut it is interesting to see how a fine piece of English first strikes the critic from the continent Charles Louis Philippe n a pas fait mieuxJoyce le dépasse par le style qui n est plus le styleCette nudité de tout ornement rhétoriquede toute forme idiomatiquemalgré la plus stricte sévérité contre le détour ou l esthétiqueet beaucoup d autres qualités fondamentales font de ce livre la plus sérieuse oeuvre anglaise que j aie lueLes soixante premières pages sont incomparables Themost serious or to translate it more colloquially It matters more than any other English book I have read 8 The Little Review De Bosschère has not yet published any criticism of Joycebut he is not the only established critic who has written to me in praise of A Portrait Joyce has had a remarkablepress but back of that and much more important is the fact that the critics have praised with convictiona personal and vital conviction3 Certain Noble Plays of JapanCuala PressDublin12 shillingsNohor AccomplishmentKnopfNew York 2 75MacmillanLondonTHE earlier and limited edition of this wrok of Ernest Fenollosa contains four playswith an introduction by WBYeatsThe larger edition contains fifteen plays and abridgements and all of Fenollosa s notes concerning the Japanese stage that I have yet been able to prepare for publicationThis Japanese stuff has not the soliditythe bodyof RihakuLi Po It is not so important as the Chinese work left by Fenollosabut on the other hand it is infinitely better than Tagore and the back wash from IndiaMotokiyo and the fourteenth century Japanese poets are worth more than KabirFenollosa has given us more than Tagore hasJapan is not a Chinese decadenceJapanwent on with thingsafter China had quitAnd Chinaquitfairly earlyT ang is the best of her poetryand after Sung her art grows steadily weakerIt would be hard to prove that the Japanese does not attemptin his artthat isto die in aromatic pain of the cherry blossombut his delicacy is not always a weaknessHis preoccupation with nuances may set one against himWhere a Chinese poet shows a sort of rugged endurancethe Japanese dramatist presents a fine point of punctilioHe isromanticistagainst theclassicaland poetic matter of factness of the Chinese writerThe sense of punctilio isso far as I can make outa Japanese characteristicand a differentiating characteristicand from it the Japanese poetry obtains a quality of its ownThe Little Review 9 The poetic sensealmost the sole thing which one can postulate as underlying all great poetry and indispensible to itis simply the sense of overwhelmingemotional values For those who must have definitionsPoetry is a verbal statement of emotional valuesA poem is an emotional value verbally stated In the face of this sense of emotional values there are no national bordersOne can not consider Rihaku as a forignerone can only consider him humanOne can not consider Odysseusor Hamletor Kagekiyo as foreignersone can only consider them humanAt one point in the Noh playsnamely in the climax of Kagekiyo we find a truly Homeric laughterand I do not think the final passages of this play will greatly suffer by any comparison the reader will be able to makeIf I had found nothing else in Fenollosa s notes I should have been well paid for the three years I have spent on themIf I dispraise Tagore now I can only say that I was among the first to praise him before he became a popular fadThe decadence of Tagore may be measuredHis first translations were revised by WBYeatslater translations by Evelyn Underhillfacilis et perfacilis descensusand now they say he has taken to writing in Englisha language for which he has no special talentIf his first drafts contained such clichés assunshine in my soul he was at least conscious at that time of his defectsPraise was rightly given to his first poems because it was demonstrated and demonstrable that they were well done in Bengaliiethat they were written in a precise and objective languageand in a metric full of interest and varietyThe popular megaphone took up phrases made to define the originals and applied them to the translationsImagine a criticism of Herrick and Campion applied to a French or German prose translation of these poetshowever excellent as a translation in proseAs the vulgarizer hates any form of literary excellencehe was well content with obscuring the real grounds for praiseThe unimportant elementthat which has made Tagore the prey of religiose nincompoopsmight easily have passed without commentHoweverit has proved the baccillus of decaySir Rabindranath having been raised in a country where the author need not defend himself against blandishment I mean the force of the babu press is scarcely enough to turn anyone s head or his judgement Sir Rabin The Little Review 10 dranath is not particularly culpableHis disciples may bear the blame as best they mayalong with his publishersBut no old established publishing house cares a damn about literatureand once Tagore had become a commercial propertythey could scarcely be expected to care for his literary integrityHe might still wash and be cleanthat is to say there is still time for him to suppress about three fourths of the stuff he has published in Englishand retain some sort of literary positionAnother man who stands in peril is Edgar MastersHe did a good job in The Spoon River AnthologyWhat is good in it is good in common with like things in the Greek anthologyVillon and Crabbeplus Masters s sense of real peopleThe work as a whole needs rewritingThe difference between a fine poem and a mediocre one is often only the fact that the good poet could force himself to rewrite No appearance of labour Nothere need be no appearance of labourI have seen too many early drafts of known and accepted poems not to know the difference between a draft and the final workMasters must go back and take the gobbetts of magazine cliché out of his later workhe must spend more time on Spoon River if he wants his stuff to last as Crabbe s Borough has lastedThere is a great gulph between asuccessfulbook and a book that enduresthat endures even a couple of centuriesI would not at any cost minimize what Edgar Masters has donebut his fight is not yet over4 The Interpretation of the Music of the XVIIth and XVIIIth Centuriesby Arnold DolmetschNovelloLondonWHGrayNew YorkARNOLD DOLMETSCH S book has been out for some timeNo intelligent musician would willingly remain without itNo intelligent musician is wholly without interest in the music of those two centuriesBut this book is more than a technical guide to musiciansIt is not merelyfull of suggestionfor the thorough artist of any sortbut it shows a way whereby the musician and theintelligentcan once more be brought into touchIf Dolmetsch could be persuaded to write a shilling manual for the instruction of children and of mistaught elders it might save the world s ears much tortureDolmetsch s initial move was to demonstrate that the music of the old instruments could not he given on the pianoany more than you could give violin music on the pianoHis next wasto restore the old instruments to usThere is too much intelligence in him and his book adequately to be treated in a paragraphI am writing of him at greater length in The EgoistHis citations from Couperin show the existence of vers libre in early

in life interest me more than other thingsArt and good talk about ArtThe Little Review was launched as an organ of those two interestsFor three yearsat irreglar intervalsit reflected my concern about various other mattersWhen I got incensed over the sufferings of what is called the proletariat I preached profound platitudes about justice and freedomI had always had the sense to know that all people can be put into two classesthe exceptional and the averageBut when I decided that the only way to prevent the exceptional from being sacrificed to the average was for everybody to become anarchistsI preached the simple and beautiful but quite uninteresting tenents of anarchismI have long given them upI still grow violent with rage about the things that arewrong and probably always shallBut I know that anarchism won t help themI have known good anarchists who are as dull as any other good laymenAnd I have no interest in laymenOnly sensibility mattersI had always known that education doesn t produce sensibilitybut I came to think that something could produce itNow I know that nothing under the heavens will make any one sensitive if he is not born that wayI had always known that people didn t want Artbut I imagined that they would be glad to be made to want itNow I know that they arenot merely indifferent to itthey hate it malignantly Thereforeto sum upall these ideas were not interesting enough to have bothered aboutBut the curious thing about America is that while she thinks such insipid and pleasant and harmless ideas are abominable and dangerousshe also thinks they are interestingAny magazine that concerns itself with such ideas is sure to get an audienceYour audience will think that you are crazy or that you want a sensationorwhat is worsethat you are a sort ofPollyannathrowing sunshine and optimism The Little Review 21 into dark places in order to help the worldBut it will be interested in reading you for one reason or anotherAnd now after working through unbelievable aridness The Little Review has at last arrived at the place from which I wanted it to startAt last we are printing stuff which is creative and inventiveandthank heavennot purely localThe audience mentioned abovein the aggregateresents itWe no longer interest that audienceThe layman says that we are now given over to the bizarre and theaesthetic that adjective which in America means something vaguely inconsequentialif not something shameless and immoral People who like tohelpmagazines withartisticleanings are not to be allured by ArtPeople who can t prove that they know anything about good letters dare to tell us that we don t know anything about themEditors who make it a point of honor to discover artistic value in the work of their contemporaries feel that we are meticulous and tooarty And tee writers themselves are the most absurdMaxwell Bodenheim writes that heknowsEzra Pound judges poetry on the basis of his personal dislikesThat is as necessarily untrue as anything can beAny one who is unwilling to praise what seems to him unworthy of praiseanyone whose interest in a poet s work abates when the work shows no signs of further progress any such critic will come in for this kind of slanderAny such critic will get himself talked about the way people love to talk in New Yorkif you try to discuss a man s work with them they saythat man is my enemy orthat man is my friend It s very puzzlingthey seem to think their remarks have something to do with literatureAnother remarkable thing that happens in New Yorkif you walk upon the street with a sensitive and rare and distinguished person you will find that he attracts more curious and resentful attention than the most badly madethe most atrociously dressedor the most grotesquely deformed human beings who surround himBut this is the attitude of all AmericaI have made several thoughtless statements aboutHelp us to make The Little Review a power etcI know that nothing on earth will do that except our own contentsThey tell me that Henley was a power in England with The National Observer when its circulation had shrunk to eighty subscribers I should be willing to pursue dominion even to that pointbut The Little Review 22 it will probably not be necessaryOur circulation grows in spite of criticism and misunderstandingYou can help us to give you more each month by subscribing for

excessively burdened with what you describe asstuff in which the creative element is present Indeed my impression is that it is devoted more to invention than to interpretationand therein misses its calling as an agency ofArt And as to qualityit is not my understanding thatArtis necessarilyor usuallyinsipid or bizarreas represented in your publicationThese are times for men to be attending to more serious things than aesthetic odditiesThe above letter was written to us by one of the front citizens of a large cityon his club stationarya men s club where old Betties gossip and criticize women s clothesYet he would say to men like Wyndham Lewisand other of our contributors now in the trenchesthat these are times for men to be attending to more serious things than aesthetic odditiesHow

am not writing this as ascholar of history I am just wandering on when I don t very much want toAt least I do feel strongly that nine tenths of the stuff written is a rotten impertinence to be

their intention from something more fundamental than will powerI have not read DrAdler s theory of thefictitious goal But I have learned from my study of the human bodyin drawing from itand from that eternal observation of it which becomes a tireless and almost unconscious preoccupation of the painterI have learned that it is possible for even the slightly intelligent to stamp his body with all the movementbearingand spirt of some cherished ideal or some protective colouring of himself which he wishes to present to the worldIn great stress or in crises where the entire will power is overthrown or engaged elsewhere the bodylike the mindassumes its true lines and presenceOn the stage this is a very simple way of unmasking a characteryou will sayan obvious wayThen why may not the fictitious role be obvious to the painternot a matter ofmere externalsbut a legitimate thing to seize upon as a subject for satire or what you chooseThis class of people those of the fictitious role are really the richest material for ArtIt is only in cases where there is creative power back of the fictitious role that the thing itself becomes an artin poetsmusicianspaintersetc when the fictitious becomes a thing createdwhere with mind and body they have created a wholly newunshakablewell designed character from themselvesByronthe unwantedspiritlessclub footed child who created from this material a brilliant symbol of romantic manly beauty flashing a flaming heart across Europe But all this is too interesting and immense to deal with in a paragraphSometime perhaps I will go into it at lengthThe stag s voice has bent her heart toward sorrowSending the evening winds which she does not seeWe cannot see the tip of the branchThe last leaf falls without witnessThere is an awe in

height of his fame he lost all his moneyHe was heavily in debtbut though 60 years oldhe started afresh and paid every centIt was the last heroic touch that drew him close to the hearts of his countrymenThe world has asked is there an American literatureMark Twain is the answerHe is the heartthe spirit of AmericaFrom his poor and struggling boyhood to his glorioussplendid old agehe remained
