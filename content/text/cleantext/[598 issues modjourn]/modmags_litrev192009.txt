cup of turfA thin spring sun painted its stones whiteTwo rollers of chalk down hung over itmidway between their crest and the sea the house crouched like a dragon on a saucer of jadeIn the walled garden behind the house the air was filtered from the sea wind and made a mixing bowl for scentsfor beescoloured insectsand noisy birdsAn old gardener picking gooseberries straightened his back to spitThe great drive up which the countryside crawled like weakening flies swerved to the right where a stream ran into the seaThere the cliffs parted and the hurrying sea beat into a round cove full of rocksThe waves rang within earshot of the lodgeIn storms they covered it with sprayThere Rings ended and the world beganThe station fly ground round the corner by the shoreAnthony Ashe poked his head out of the window and smelt his strip of beachHalf way up the avenue he stopped the cab and got out That will doMousemanthank youGood afternoon He passed under the trees whose long buds broke the light and 4 The Little Review took a footpath across the parkHe walked quicklyThe house has a thousand eyesHe turned his head to the sea under their scrutiny till a straggled wood of black pine hid him and the path turned redAnthony Ashe of Rings remembered that he should have insured the driver s silence the words had not shapedBut there were no wordsand tongue slithing out of fashionA great lord of the world would admit thatThe house would know already a small child running up the drive with the newsIt did not matter It is said of this place that in the time of Arthurthe legendary king of BritainMorgan le Fayan enchantress of that period had dealings of an inconceivable nature thereAlso that it was used by druid priestsand even before then as a place for holy and magical rites and ceremoniesA battle of the Danes and Saxons was fought thereToday the country people will not approach it at nightnot the hardiest shepherdThere is a tradition that in the barrow above the earthworks is placed a box of bright gold The first Ring raised its thirty feet of turfA ribbon of chalk path ran along its cresta loop a mile roundInside was a second wall and within that a thirdOn the plateau above them was a round barrowirrelevantly placedand a dewpond full of mudBehind the pond and barrow there was a groveragged trees exceedingly tallpines and beechesknit at the feet with hazel and bramble and fernOn its skirt a pleasant woodits centre a saggy tricket full of white marsh grassYear inyear outthe wind rang in its crest with the noise of a harpFrom these rings and this grove depended the fantastic houseand the generations called Ashe which were born there and pattered through its hall and bright passages like leavesThe triple circle was the sole device on their shieldrepresented from the hatchment of their dead to the coral and bells each baby shook and chewedAn old drawing represented the Rings come down from their hill and sitting like an extinguisher upon the houseIt had been calculated The Little Review 5 that allowing for all projections the house would fit exactly into the roots of the wood A British campbut of pre British possibly neolithic originused by the Romansa refuge for Celt and then for the Saxona place of legend and consequent aversion to the countryside ever sinceit is well that so interesting an historic site should have remained in the preservation of so ancient a family Anthony Ashe stamped his arms on the presentation copy of these sentiment and knew betterThe Rings preserved himHis son Julian had diedand that night he had gone up to them a blind beastAfter these years in the Eastin Russiahe had come backwithout matewithout heirto present his accounts and their deficitHe went through the gap in the first rampartcrossed the fosseand mounted the white chalk steps over the second ringand the thirdThe wind ran along them shiveringand a thistle tapped his bootHe climbed the barrowsat on itand looked back down the valley to his houseThe Rings kept the wide valley headFrom them a roadgreen white and faint ran into a birchwoodand through the delicate trees to a door in the kitchen garden wallThus no one but shepherds came to the Rings except through RingsAt the valley head the road was lost in a powdering of flintsThick white smoke rose from two chimneys belowThe fire was lit in the library and in his dressing roomThe news had comeHe dragged at his short beard with his knees till his chin achedThere must be childrenAnd for that some strong girlHis name would obtain oneWhat was left of his life could be given to her trainingA lively sacrifice to this placeIt did not matter whomI d be daft to refuse himthe laird oCockpenAn old tuneThat s itSoon to findEasy to keepBut a stale businessThere was

foregoesThe feather in Rings capYou could cover a broader skullMy old head aches with youHe wrote with his stick upon a patch of chalkAnthony Ashe1892 Iste perfecit opus I must go down and see about that child He stood up resetting his gray top hatA breath fluttered through the tree tops and ran through the grey hair fringes on the back of his skullHe shook his head Caprice Caprice stop tickling

nightsweet princeYou were a young dog to turn up your nose at the pretty ladies of Rings H ll I suppose I had better go in He ran down the side of the barrow and walked into the woodA light shell of turfand springing needlesThen mud curled over the toes of his bootsA springing bramble reversed its hooks across his noseThe blood dripped quickly through the thin skinHe controlled his furyAnother curled across his waistcoatHe loosed each hook in turnHigh up the wind sang with seraphic lightnessa transparent feather flattened into the crown of the gray top hatWith lovely lightness the wind fellthe last sigh ran down the shafts and scattered in minute touches He thrust on slowly into the clearing where there was a large stoneLight womenLight womenRings whoresOn this rock I have built my churchHe stood five minutes with greedy eyesThen The Little Review 7 he struck through and hurried from the woodover the rampart and down the rabbit darting hillChapter II The library had thirty two lancet windows to enclose a quartering of AsheAt the east end in the wall s angle seven stairs led up to a round roomthe floor of a tower called Rings RootAnthony Ashe ran upHe peered at the dim carved panels like a man inside a barrelThe sun lay in ochre strips on the floor s deep brown glassAcross each window the sea sparkledbut no breeze followed through the great depth of stoneA fire of fir cones charred to a chalk red ashA chair was placed at the third windowits arms finished with dolphin s headsHe stretched and straddled in his quintessence of privacya handsome daimon inside a Chinese ballThe room was in the heart of RingsThere Ursula Ashe had declared herself a witchThen there appeared at uncertain times a sphere of purelightOn the wall hung a lead hourglass filled with

written three such historiesand I am but a young manAlready I have written three hundredfour hundred thousand wordsMy wife is somewhere in this house where for hours I have been sitting and writingShe is a tall woman with black hair turning a little greyListenshe is going softly up a flight of stairsAll day she goes softlydoing the housework in our houseI came to this town from another town in the state of IowaMy father was a mender of shoesI worked my way through college and became a historianWe own this house in which I sitThis is my room in which I workAlready I have written three histories of peoplesI have told how states were formed and battles foughtYou may see my books standing straight up on the shelves of librariesThey stand up like sentriesI am tall like my wife but my shoulders are stoopedAlthough I write boldly I am a shy manI like being in this room alone with the door lockedThere are many books hereNations march back and forth in the booksIt is quiet here but in the books

along our street between our house and the yellow houseThe window before my desk makes a little framed place like a pictureThe yellow house across the street makes a solid background of yellowThe side door of our house bangsThere is a moment of waitingMy wife s face floats across the yellow background of the pictureGeneral Pershing rode down a hill and into a battleAlexander rode down a hill and into a battleLittle things are growing big in my mindThe window before my desk makes a little framed place like a pictureEvery day I wait staringI wait with an odd sensation of something impendingMy hand tremblesThe face that floats through the picture does something I don t understandThe face floatsthen it stopsIt goes from the right hand side to the left hand sidethen it stopsThe face comes into my mind and goes outThe face floats in my mindThe pen falls from my fingersThe house is silentThe eyes of the floating face are turned away from meMy wife is a girl who came here to this town

wife has gone out of the houseShe does not know that I know every little thought of her lifeI know about her and what she thought when she was a child and walked in the street of an Ohio townI have heard the voices of her mindI have heard the little voicesI heard the voices crying that night long ago when she was suddenly overtaken with passion and came running to crawl into my arms where she lay tremblingI heard the voices of her mind talking as we sat together on the first evening after we were married and had moved into this houseIt would be strange if I could sit hereas I am doing nowwhile my own face floated across the picture made by the yellow house and the windowIt would be strange and beautiful if I could meet my wifecome into her presenceThe woman whose face has just floated across my picture knows nothing of meI know nothing of herShe has gone off along the streetThe voices of her mind are talkingI am here in this room as alone as ever any man God madeIt would be

a word out of myself to the othersWhyin all our life togetherhave I never been able to break through the wall to my wifeAlready I have written three hundredfour hundred thousand wordsAre there no words for lifeSome day I shall make a testament unto myself Indisposition by Mark Turbyfill THE crested tulips By the white pebble path Array themselves as chattering birds of paradiseTheir flame streaks on iridescent surfaces Shock the great space of waiting in these thin daysA derisive little wind Executes pas de chat across the shaking budsAnd my eyes play tricks on my earsAnd I hear The piercingdeafeningflauntingcondemnation Of vivid angry birds Ulyssesin Court by Margaret AndersonTHE trial of the Little Review for printing a masterpiece is now over lostof coursebut if any one thought there was a chance of our winningin the United States of AmericaIt is the only farce I ever participated in with any pleasureI am not convivialand I am usually bored or outraged by the state of farce to which unfarcical matters must descendThis time I had resolved to watch the proceedings with the charming idea of extracting some interest out of the fact that things proceed as one knows they wlil proceedThere is no possible interest in this factbut perhaps one can be enlivened by speculating as to whether they will swerve the fraction of an inch from their predestined stupidityNothis cannot engage my interestI have already lived through the stupiditySo how shall I face an hour in a court roombefore three judges who do not know the difference between James Joyce and obscene postal cardswithout having hystericsor without trying to convince them that the wordsliteratureandobscenitycan not be used in conjunction any more than the wordsscienceandimmoralitycanWith what shall I fill my mind during this hour of redundant human dramaAh I shall make an effort to keep entirely silentand since I have never under attack achieved this simple featperhaps my mind can become intrigued with the accomplishment of itIt is a good ideaThere are certain civilized people who proceed entirely upon the principle that to protect one s self from attack is the only course of action open to a decent and developed human beingMy brain accepts this philosophybut I never act upon it any more than Ezra Pound doesI am one of those who feels some obscure need to have all people think with some intelligence upon some subjectsBut I am determinedduring this unnecessary hour in courtto The Little Review 23 adopt the philosophy of self preservationI will protect my sensibilities and my brain cells by being unhearing and untalkativeThe court opensEvery one stands up as the three judges enterWhy must I stand up as a tribute to three men who wouldn t understand my simplest remark But this is reasoningand I am determined to be vacuous Our attorneyMrJohn Quinnbegins pertinently by telling who James Joyce iswhat books he has writtenand what are his distinguished claims as a man of lettersThe three judges quite courteously but with a bewildered impatience inform him that they can t see what bearing those facts have on the subject theydon t care who James Joyce is or whether he has written the finest books in the world their only function is to decide whether certain passages ofUlysses incidentally the only passages they can understandviolate the statuteIs this a commentary onUlyssesor on the minds of the judges But I must not dream of asking such a questionMy function is silenceStillthere is that rather fundamental matter of who is the authorSince Art is the person But this is a simplicity of logic they would think I had gone madMrQuinn calls literaryexpertsto the stand to testify thatUlyssesin their opinion would not corrupt our readersThe opinions of experts is regarded as quite unnecessarysince they know only about literature but not about law Ulysseshas suddenly become a matter of law rather than of literature I grow confused againbut I am informed that the judges are being especially tolerant to admit witnesses at all that such is not the custom in the special sessions courtMrJohn Cowper Powys testifies thatUlyssesis too obscure and philosophical a work to be in any sense corrupting I wonderas MrPowys takes the standwhether his look and talk convey to the court that his mind is in the habit of functioning in regions where theirs could not penetrateand I imagine the judges saying This man obviously knows much more about the matter than we do the case is dismissed Of course I have no historical basis for expecting such a thingI believe it has never happenedMrPhilip Moeller is the next witness to testify for the Little 24 The Little Review Reviewand in attempting to answer the judgesquestions with intelligence he asks if he may use technical terminologyPermission being given he explains quite simply that the objectionable chapter is an unveiling of the subconscious mindin the Freudian mannerand that he saw no possibility of these revelations being aphrodiasic in their influenceThe court gaspsand one of the judges calls out Herehereyou might as well talk RussianSpeak plain English if you want us to understand what you re saying Then they ask MrMoeller what he thinks would be the effect of the objectionable chapter on the mind of the average readerMrMoeller answers I think it would mystify himYesbut what would be the effectI seem to be drifting into unconsciousnessQuestion What is the effect of that which mystifiesAnswer MystificationBut no one looks either dazed or humourousso I decide that they regard the proceedings as perfectly sensible Other witnessesamong them the publishers of the Dialwho valiantly appeared at both hearingsare waived on the consideration of their testimony being the same as already givenMrQuinn then talks for thirty minutes on the merits of James Joyce s work in terms the court can understand Might be called futurist literatureneither written for nor read by school girlsdisgusting in portionsperhapsbut no more so than SwiftRabelaisShakespearethe Bibleinciting to anger or repulsion but not to lascivious acts and as a final bit of suave psychologynauseating and diabolical aimed at that dim stirring of human intelligence which for an instant lights up the features of the three judgesI myself do not understandUlyssesI think Joyce has carried his method too far in this experiment Yes groans the most bewildered of the three it sounds to me like the ravings of a disordered mind I can t see why any one would want to publish it Let me tell you whyI almost leap from my chair Since I am the publisher it may be apropos for me to tell you why I have wanted to publish it more than anything else that has ever been offered to meLet me tell you why I regard it as the prose masterpiece of my generationLet me tell you what it s about and why it was The Little Review25 written and for whom it was written and why you don t understand it and why it is just as well that you don t and why you have no right to pit the dulness of your brains against the fineness of mine I suddenly feel as though I had been run over by a subway trainMy distinguished co publisher is pounding me violently in the ribs Don t try to talkdon t put yourself into their hands with that look of being untouched by the surrounding stupidities which sends me into paroxysmsI smile vacuously at the court MrQuinn establishesapparently to the entire satisfaction of the judgesthat the offending passages ofUlysseswill revolt but not contaminateBut their sanction of this point seems to leave them vaguely unsatisfied and they statewith a hesitation that is rather charmingthat they feel impelled to impose the minimum fine of100 and thus to encourage the Society for the Prevention of ViceThis decision establishes us as criminals and we are led to an adjoining building where another bewildered official takes our fingerprintsOwing to editorial mediation as to what passages must be deleted from the next instalment ofUlyssesEpisode XIV will not be continued until next monthMCA In this welter of crime and lecheryboth MrSumner and the judges deserve our thanks for one thingour appearance seemed to leave them without any doubts as to our personal puritySome of myfriendshave considered me both insane and obsceneI believefor publishing MrJoyce Poems by Philippe Soupault Flamme UNE enveloppe

globe of the worldits lung chartsits weighing machineits surgical chairand its bowl of ineffectual gold fishSomething inexpressibly funny and inexpressibly fecunda fecundity suppressed by coldnessand a terrible determination more terrible in that her husband Otto felt nothing of itHe was very fond of herand had he been a little more sensitive he would have been very glad to be proud of herShe never became confidential with himand he never tried to overstep thispartly because he was unaware of itand partly because he felt little need of a closer companionshipThe Little Review 29 She was a fine womanhe knew thathe never thought to question anything she didbecause it was littlenor what she saidbecause it was lessthere was an economy about her existence that simply forbade questioningHe felt in some dim waythat to criticise at all would be to stop everythingTheir life was typical of the East Side doctor s lifePatients all day for himand the children for her with an occasional call from someone who had a sick birdIn the evening they would sit around a table with just sufficient foodwith just sufficient silver and linenand one luxuryKatrina s glass of white wineOr sometimes they would go out to dineto some koscher placewhere everyone was too friendly and too ugly and too warmand here he would talk of the day s diseases while she listened to the music and tried not to hear what her daughter was crying forHe had always been aliberal from the first turn of the cradleIn the freedom of the peoplein the betterment of conditionshe took the interest a doctor takes in seeing a

vague colorand very restlessShe said simply We must talk about religion And with an awkwardness unusual to him he askedWhyBecause she said in a strained voicemaking a hurt gesture it is so far from me He did not know what to say of courseand lifting one thin leg in its white trousers he placed it carefully over the otherShe was sitting opposite himher head turned a little to one sidenot looking at anything You see she said presently I want religion to become out of the reach of the fewBecome s a queer word he said It is the only word she answeredand there was a slight irritation in her voice because it is so irrevocably for the manyYes he said mechanicallyand reached up to his beard and left his hand there under a few strands of hair You see she went on simply I can come to the pointFor

there was anger and pride in her Do not intrude now by word or signbut tommorrow you will come to me that is enoughthat is all you can do and in this wordallhe felt a limit on himself that he had never known beforeand he was frightened and disquieted and unhappyAnd he came the next daycringing a littlefawninguneasyand she would not see him she sent wordI do not need you yet and he called again the next day and learned that she was out of townand then one Sunday she was in to himShe said quietly to himas if she were preparing him for a great disappointment I have deliberatelyvery deliberatelyremoved remorse from the forbidden fruit and he was abject suddenly and trembling There will be no thorns for you she went on in a cold abrupt voice You will miss thatbut do not presume to show it in my presenceAlso my floor is not the floor on which you may crawl she continued and I do not permit you to suffer while I am in the room and she added unfastening her brooch slowly and precisely I dislike all spiritual odoursAre we all strange he whispered It takes more than will to attain to madnessYes 32 The Little Review Then she was silent for a whilethinking I want to suffer he murmuredand trembled again We are all gross at timesbut this is not your timeI could follow you into the wildernessI would not miss you And it was said in a terrible forbidding voice I suffer as a birthright I want it to be something more my own than thatWhat are you going to do he said Does one ever destroy oneself who is utterly disinterestedI don t know Presently she said I love my husband I want you to know thatit doesn t matterbut I want you to know thatand that I am content with himand quite happyYes Castillion Rodkin answered and began trembling againholding on to the sides of the bed But there is something in me she continued that is very mournful because it is being He could not answer and tears came to his eyes There is another thing she said with abrupt roughness that I must insist onthat is that you will not insult me by your presence while you are in this room He tried to stop his weeping nowand his body grew tenseabject You see she continued some people drink poisonand some take a knifeand others drownI take you In the very early dawnshe sat up with a strange smile Will you smoke she saidand lit him a cigaretteThen she withdrew into herselfsitting on the edge of the

One out of manyor only one He put his cigarette outhe was beginning to breathe with difficultyhe was beginning to shiver Well He turned overgot upstood on the floor Is there nothing I can say he

ARTShas driven WRTitterton to the columns of the English Review with Part One of a metrical diatribe which one suspects will become vitriolic about vers libre and abstract painting by Part ThreeTruth to tell the arts always were mad if the term connotes their continual wandering from the watch fires of tradition into the trackless places of growing human consciousnessSane art is usually shopkeeping trade in beautythe art school with the courage to open a department devoted to salesmanship will affect an advance both in membership and honestyBut the big people in art have usually wandered away from the counter just before the professors in literature and the fine arts have classified and labeled the goodsIn this tradition of deserting the traditionalthe movement of pictorial and sculptural art from the phase of representation to that of complete abstraction has been an orderly and inevitable progressionorderly and inevitablebecause once the principal of subjectivism is admitted in artas it was in the sentimental selectiveness and idealism of the romantic paint photographersit moves quite naturally through impressionismpost impressionismfuturismcubismneo vorticismand every otherismwhich yet sleeps in the mind of manAs Wyndham Lewis questioned the architectsthe problem always isWhere is your vortex So long as a man s art revolved around the pleasant portrayal of external appearances truth to those appearances and that pleasanteness must be the testBut always there had been even among artists the wise who realised that they had some more useful task to hand than the making of replicas in some dead material of the things of the vital universeAt lasthoweverthe tricks of the trade became so obvious that these wise concluded that what was not worth doing so well was not worth doing at all36 The Little Review One remembers a play of Rudolf Besier sA party of Cockneys invade the countryone by one they grow conscious of new phenomenaeach murmurs Cows an orses anthings the audience rocked with laughterThe analogyEminent Academicians spending their distinguished careers murmuringCows an orses anthingsin paintsometimes achieving the final d and the aspirate That is why the new movements matterthat is why abstract art and Lawrence Atkinson matterIt is something more than the reiteration of the existence of things it is the assertion of basic forces in the universe and of basic ideas in the mind of the artistAtkinson s work depicts both and establishes their relationshipThus he deals not in surfaces and the simple facts of optics appearancesbut in form and the known dynamics beneath surfacesMore important stillhe deals in the merchandise of the mindwhich releases his conceptions alike from the three dimensional of space and the single point of timeThat is where the new artescaping from the portrayal of one space at one time into the eternal present and limitless horizon of the human intelligencecan achieve so muchThat is where it may fail for the recesses of mentality are so remoteso unique and individual that there is danger of the artist who depends no longer upon the safe link of visual appearancesremoving his point of interest so far as to lose contact altogether with his audiencesharing the loneliness of God in looking on his work and seeing that it was goodHere it is that the search for the symbol commencesand that devotion to technique which must always play an important partand which in the case of the old schools had become exalted from a means to an end in itselfWith Atkinson s work the search for a suitable medium of communication between his own mind and that of others has led him to reject the sophisticated formula of some of the recent schools and to depend for his effect upon a use of lineform and colour to which generations of race consciousness have given a universal significanceOften it is true the complexity of his own mind assumes a power of instinctive comprehension in that of his audience which is notIN THE BEGINNINGBY LAWRENCE ATKINSON 38 The Little Review forthcomingand the more difficult of his worksparticularly the pictureslose their range so that their significance passes over the heads of onlookersRecentlyhoweverAtkinson has turned his attention to sculpturewhich by the very nature of the medium tends to broader effects and more simple statement than it sister art of paintingThe illustrations show phases of Atkinson s plastic workthe one where he was expressing himself in a formula practically geometricalwhich interesting as it was had too great an interest in the mechanical structure of its subjectsthe other which aimed at expressing an idea as nature would have expressed it had she been working in a medium of clay or stonea significant amorphismSo much of the recent abstract work in England has tended to be mechanicalGranted that much can be achieved with such a means as the piece calledIn the BeginningshowsHere the artist has been interested in somthing more vital than surface or even structurehe has endowed the abstract figure half humanhalf animal with a prophetic sense of tragedyThe structural lines are strong and heavy in token of the perfection of animal strengthIn striking contrast is the inertness of head and handthe hand hanging limplythe head bowed by the realisation of good and evilits melancholy emphasised by the sculptured patternIt is this emotional value in Atkinson s work which differentiates it from so much that has gone hitherto in the name of artistic abstractionHe is not making his appeal from the sophisticated intellect to intelligence equally sophisticatedbut from instinct to the instincts a safer and saner thing in an age run to seed in mere clevernessOccasionally Atkinson himself succumbs to the temptation and works out a concept so intellectually that it misses that direct appeal and simplicity which was the vital secret of early artUsuallyhoweverhe deals with elemental thingssimplifying to essentialsand choosing lines which have so long spoken to the sub consciousness of the race that their message is immediate and effectiveThe pictureTranquillewith

the lines diverge but are still governed by truth to their own relationship to a predestined paralellism and a movement back toward the central purposeThe three examples will serveAn eminent critic writing recently of Atkinson salted his appreciation with a doubt as to whether the art would ever become popularThe only art which has ever deserved that name has been this basic art which makes its appeal to the instincts and the subconsciousnessThat is why I believe that his work will find acceptanceHe is not working on a basis of appeal merely to the super intellectuals but along lines of universal appeal and capable of infinite development and expressionApropos art and its trials legal and spiritualby Emmy VSanders IF THE puritan were nothing but a puritan and the philistine nothing

and before each separate product of art and before each artistic individuality as suchconstant re adjustment of mental approach is requiredThe Little Review 43 He or rather his epidermis contacts everything in the same way and with the same demands and expectationsSometimes he mentions the artist as a being different from himselfa being of quicker vibrationsmore sensitive perceptions and unusual ways of contacting life and transmitting life experienceBut at the bottom of his heart he denies that the artist is different from himselfLacking imaginationhow can he conceive of that which is not a part of his world and his mental equipmentTherefore he treats the artist and his activities necessarily as he treats himselfa thing onto which empty generalities and inflexible rules and regulations can be pasted and stuck from the outsideStrangethisIt would never occur to this intelligent and cultured person that he might interfere and play the judge between two Chinamenby merely babbling things in his own tonguewithout the slightest knowledge of Chinese that might enable him first to find out what are the issues at stake and what is reallygoing on He never suspects that art has a language of its owna language not of words onlybut of subtle reactions and ever shifting valuations taking place in the depths of the artist soul and that a fair amount of knowledge of that language is indispensable for knowing what is at stakeHe suspects still less that this languagehoweveris a matter of birthright and cannot be acquired bybutting in So he goes oninterfering and

continued A NOVEL SHERWOOD ANDERSON POOR WHITE At Bookstores2 00 Recommended to you by The Little Review The Reader Critic Walter ShawNew YorkMay I ask in the name of art why next month you willreport all the blatant ineptitudes of the court proceedings and answer themSurely none of your audience gives a damn what the court sayswe have all reached that stage of sophisticationso why use up good paper on subjects with which we have no concernIt is purely a matter for your business manager to get out of as easily as possible unless you still believe inprogressand the possibility of education by yelling aboutinjustice but even then it is a matter of sociology not at all within the field of artBut what is within the field of aestheticsAs one of your audience who does not feelUlyssesis a work of artno one with whom I have discussedUlyssesconsiders it more thaninteresting I suggest or perhaps have the right to demandsince you agree with Coomaraswamy that the rasika has a duty to prove his contention that a certain work is arta criticism ofUlyssesfrom youThis is within your field and not an answer to the organized stupidity of the non aesthetics These things do not go by duty and obligation but by necessityYou have no more right to demand that the critic make a new work of arthis criticismthan you have a right to demand the original work of artCertainly the critic has to prove his case if he has the necessity to make other men see and believe what he has perceivedbut no one can demand it of him Ulysseshas been running in the Little Review for three yearsThere have been many discussions in that time about MrJoyce as an artist and about different aspects ofUlysses If you and your friends who think it only interesting have not the perception or the grace to know that Joyce is an artistthen no second sight could come to youI fearIf you have not seen him tight rope walking the cobweb of the human consciousnessconceiving and executing the rhythms of unspoken thoughtif you have not seen MrBloom spring full fledged from his own brainif you haven t the carefully organizedmasterfully coloured abstract picture of the mind of Dublinif you have not got the luminosity of his geniusnothing will help you but a work of equal magnitude which no one could write and which you again would not understandjh Errata In poems by Philippe Soupault beginning page 26 Flammefirst
