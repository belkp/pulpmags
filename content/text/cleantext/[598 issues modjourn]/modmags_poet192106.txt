astray Early morning s gold is gone They slumber on they slumber on I have never done with you Half the things I want to do I will put kisses on your knees And we will squander as we please This little lazy lovely day  Ninety million miles away The sun halloos Come out to play The winds are prancing on tip toe   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Impatient with long waiting so The hills look up Come out and oh Let your bodies dart and run While I make shadows says the sun  Boys and girls come out to play Before the river runs away I have never done with you Half the things I want to do  The Sun  Boys and girls come out to play Before the river runs away While you are fluid unafraid Beneath my light and shadow skim Before this folded gloom is dim And limb no longer follows limb Dancing under spotted shade  For dancing were your bodies made Before the roses of you fade Find your meaning for the mouth While I lean south while I go west Find your meaning for the rest  The Sun child  Throw back your head and fly with me Love me chase me lie with me Follow sweetheart of the sun   Genevieve Taggard  Turn and follow where I run Between blue vineyards and fruit trees Fall down and kiss me on the knees Pant beside me while I pull Berries for you from the full Blue jewelled branches Crush them red Not on your mouth on mine instead  The Sun  Nimble you move you are my own My pliant essence All alone On fire in the passive sky I burn a stone a liquid stone Together you in double shade Discover why your limbs were made  The Sun child  I have never done with you Half the things I want to do Link your arms and loosen them Pluck and suck a grass s stem Touch my breasts with that blue aster Kiss me fast I ll kiss you faster Link your arms and loosen them  Now link your arms like mine together Toward me lightly like a feather Dance Like feathers you ll be blown Across the level field alone   And like a brown wing my bare feet Will skim the meadow till we meet  The river skips but we are quicker Its little body s slender glisten Goes down alley ways of leaves Flicker sun and river flicker Listen lover listen listen How the river laughs and grieves  I have never done with you Half the things I want to do Leap for me sweetheart reach and try To catch me sweetheart Kiss and cry After me sweetheart darting by  After you seize me we will lie I in the grass you in the sky After you kiss me we will start To try and reach each other s heart And searching frantically find The unseen blisses of the blind  The Sun children  Before the river runs away Boys and girls come out to play They slumber on they slumber on Morning s glint is almost gone With yellow bubbles fill your veins   Genevieve Taggard  Before the lusty day star wanes They slumber on they slumber on Silken leopard noon is gone Die you may die you must Fill your mouths with pollen dust Calyxes and honey thighs Both will wither Beauty dies Find out why mouths are berry red Before you stiffen in your drab bed Over you humming summer will glide You ll never lie languid on your side And listen then as you listen now To half heard melodies oh how The river runs and runs and runs Fluid with splendor and the sun s Circuit is singing Fragile day Boys and girls come out to play  Genevieve Taggard   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TWENTY FOUR HOKKU ON A MODERN THEME  I  Again the larkspur Heavenly blue in my

Against the door dead leaves are falling On your window the cobwebs are black Today I linger alone  The foot step A passer by  SPRING  Down the slope white with flowers Toward the hills hazy blue A butterfly Floats away  MAY MOON  Milky night Through the resting trees A petal Falling  STORM  Against the gulls that play in the gale The black waves dart White fangs In vain   Jun Fujita  NOVEMBER

leaf moves  DECEMBER MOON  Among the frozen grasses Frosting in the moon glare Tombstones Are whiter tonight  ECHO  I know it is not she Yet I listen To distant laughter Fleeting away  Jun Fujita   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  GOODFELLOWSHIP  A Fragment by Li Po  Hast thou not beheld the Yellow River Which flows from Heaven It runs rapidly down and empties into the sea Nevermore to return  Hast thou beheld the mirror in the hall That reflects the grief of white hair In the morning it is like black silk In the evening it will be covered with snow  While we are in the mood of joy Let us drink Let not the golden bottle be lonely Let us waste not the moon  LONELY  By Wang Wei Eighth Century A D  When the moon begins to grow And the autumn dews to fall My silken jacket is lightly thin But I have not changed Wistfully I play my lute Long and deep into the night For my heart is shy Of the empty chamber  Translated from the Chinese by Moon Kwan    THE HUNCHBACK  I saw a hunchback climb over a hill Carrying slops for the pigs to swill  The snow was hard the air was frore And he cast a bluish shadow before  Over the frozen hill he came Like one who is neither strong nor lame  And I saw his face as he passed me by And the hateful look of his dead fish eye  His face like the face of a wrinkled child Who has never laughed or played or smiled  I watched him till his work was done  And suddenly God went out of the sun  Went out of the sun without a sound But the great pigs trampling the frozen ground  The hunchback turned and retracked the snows But where God s gone there s no man knows  John Peale Bishop   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE VILLAGER  YOUR HORSES  Often in clear winter afternoons or crisp fall mornings Walking long stretches of sand where waves charge in proudly Or standing on curving walls looking out over empty  water I am aware of the memory of you and your horses Prancing bays proud roans and wild white horses Your laughter syncopating the hoof beats of horses Pounding on clay turf land or drumming on long white  roads  Standing at the forks of the river at Orleans Street Watching the ice dip up and down in the oily water Big gray and white lake birds circling slowly slantwise  over the water A tug with smoke stack down for bridges And two engines coughing out of time with each other I ride again with the memory of you and your horses Of you mounting a flight of steps on a glossy black Riding down a railroad track to meet me on a deep chested  bay  And the sound of your laughter comes to me over the backs of horses The memory of your hair streaming with the manes of horses   Clifford Franklin Gessler  Your firm brown hand flung out in the crowding of horses Greeting me over the necks of wild white horses galloping home  NEVERTHELESS  Inasmuch as I love you And shall know no peace more unless I am near you Though you are a flame of will Proud and variable as you are beautiful and dear Nevertheless I will go your way Since you will not go mine  Therefore although the cool roads of my village Are more pleasant to me than the pavements of your city Although its dim streets are more kindly than your glar  ing arcs Though the unhurried voices of my townspeople Are more friendly music in my ears than the screamings And glib chatter of your city dwellers Nevertheless I will go down with you into the city And bruise my heart upon its bricks Become brother to its shrieking elevated And learn to hurry away my days in this brief world Among the grimy roofs that soil the clean young sunshine Thinking only at long whiles in summer dusks Of hushed paths where hurrying feet have never trodden Of cool lanes white in the splendor of the rising moon   CONCENTRIC CIRCLES  Cracks in broken windows Thread out like spokes from the center where a pebble  or a bullet struck Cross and recross and spread to the edge of the pane Ripples in still water or running water race out in con  centric circles from the place where a stone or a body is thrown in  Ice forms on pools in long thin slivers that knit slowly and close up the gaps till a hard brittle floor is formed  Fissures in stones spread slowly and widen and deepen with the prying of frost  Thoughts are like all these things  PRAYER  O thou elemental Rain sun and body of the quick warm earth Hear these words from the cells of thy blood Multitudinous various  Let the waters at the dim roots of the grass be sweet And the milk be abundant in the breasts of time Yet a little while till the pearl gray banners of smoke Be dissolved and the flowing of rivulets be but a distant  murmur In the shout and the far white splendor of thy coming   Clifford Franklin Gessler  Let thy kindness be as a wide white blanket covering all The brave inglorious futile race of men Who lift tired eyes ever to sad stars More desolate Than the wind harrowed wastes of ocean Whence comes no answer And after our futile striving give us Peace  Clifford Franklin Gessler  GOD LOVER  Who are you Why do you hide behind Your mask the sun and stars  The brazen day and The moon washed night Are alms that you give your beggars  I ask no mendicant s pittance I cry for the supreme desolation of your face  Muriel S afford   VOLUNTARIES  THE INTANGIBLE SYMPHONY  How shall I capture Sound and desire  Let candor stir upon candor As sword upon sword Tempering the tenor and the timbre Of this sweet ecstasy Grieved is my mind Harassed by music Untouched of any sound  Yet on trellis on infinite arch On bridges of fretted iron Frail to thought acrid to sight Thunderous with traffic of men Red budding peach petalled Beauty flames into view  But how shall I capture Sound and desire How shall I hear The pointed vagaries The evanescent harmonies That float unfingered Across the strings of the mind   Mark Turbyfill  How shall I hear Plucked from the intangible mind strings The song desire sings and sings  There is no create instrument  THE POWER OF NOTHING  I only laughed As at a gauche mistake When I learned we had paid With innocent counterfeit That such carnival confetti Festival of flamingo fun We had danced for nothing spent So much brightness All out of nothing  But when I learned of my awkwardness Mistaking the denomination color design Of a little word you gave me And of the bright shapes of dreams Germinated in my heart All out of nothing I could not laugh any more For there was a sharp severing of slender unseen roots And that fruit which they bore Fell dangling and bruised From the tendrils and the vine   REPLETION  I have fed on the radiance of my beloved Lying beneath the flowering pear tree Her breasts are inverted cups of sunlight She is dappled over with iridescence Light and heat Pierce the pear leaves And fall dizzily Through a flashing of petal flakes Burnishing and mellowing her My nostrils are prophetic With the sweetness of pear flesh My eyes are dazzled with love made manifest And my mind is parturient and tremulous With glistening schemes  THE SEA STORM  I hurtled like a hound for joy Through the storm Of your magnificence Wave on crashing dashing crested wave You hurl yourself against space You are positive force You might crush me to nothingness Yet I revel like a golden super carp   Mark Turbyfill  Flashing pas de poisson Through flowers of foam  And I know your ecstatic response Exquisite monster As I blossom into glittering spray Above you  THINGS NOT SEEN  The sea gull poises In the charged expectant air  The sea gull poises With delicate resistance  Its sheer conscious being Is cause to strike creation Out of all this emptiness  The sea gull waits Wavering slightly Against this mighty immanence  So does my heart wait For the release of a substance Not yet seen  Mark Turbyfill    FROM THE NEAR EAST  CAPE HELLES  This water is all rich and no great wave Rushing can ever sweep from the old ooze The witnesses of simple men who gave Their lives here to the sea  Our ship s foot goes Warily now for here she treads above The globed mortal homes of dreams all drowned Sometimes as if a man smiled at his love A smile turns in the water Round and round Sometimes a hundred cries go swimming while Such common woes and hopes are ocean freight That every eddy of the grey sea mile Is strewn with ardors inarticulate And homing memories  Yet this must be That men s ghosts ever shame old pagan Earth With human blood crimson grey Neptune s sea Snap the Fates thread with high impetuous mirth Cast in the dicing game mortality Slip from the moorings of sweet flesh and then Clean past the loom of the Ultimate Islands ride To bring a vision down to the sea again In ships and keep the faith and take the tide   Morris Gilbert  THE BOULGHAR DAGH  Day by day the sun booms over this long valley And the mountains are sun flowers And smile fondly at him as he goes by For only Gunesh the sun Of all the people they have seen pass Is steadfast  Alexander came through this valley And did not return At its mouth a lass unparalleled Found Antony in a market place Whistling to the air they sailed away together A man named Saul trudged up this road soon after He went on to Rome Godfrey de Bouillon passed this way to drown In Cydnus  Some troopers from Bavaria and Pesth Were here last year and they fled Now Pathans and Sikhs And other swarthy fighting men camp hereabouts But presently they ll be gone  Morris Gilbert   BY HILL AND DALE  PRAYER AT TIMBER LINE  Oh that I could fashion words As the wind bends the trees Could shape my lines as shining bare  As exquisite as these White branches of the writhen pine Standing alone at timber line  Winds of life blow stinging free Into my heart that s waiting still Beat on my words unceasingly And shape them to your stern white will  BEAUTY  I went where pines grew Beauty I found in these In stars and in the strange Twisted boughs of trees  I went where houses were Beauty I found then In eyes and in the strange Twisted lives of men   Ruth Suckow  THE ODD ONES  I like best those crotchety ones That follow their own way In whimsical oblivion Of what the neighbors say  They grow more rare as they grow old Their lives show in their faces In little slants and twisted lines Like trees in lonely places  GRAMPA SCHULER  Grampa Schuler when he was young  Had a crest of hair and shining eyes  He wore red flowered waistcoats  Wild Byronic ties  The whole land of Germany Wasn t wide enough  He ran away one night when winter Seas were fierce and rough  He has a sleek farm here With already a settled air He s patriarchal with his sons And daughters round him everywhere His son s son Jim has fiery eyes He wants to go where the land is new Grampa bitterly wonders What are Young fools coming to Ruth Suckow    PRIMAVERAL  You should have seen the griffin in the pine tree With stars for eyes  You are my own Mine though I never found you  There was the hollow valley With its river There was the big magnolia Strung with moons   I look for you Love makes my feel unsteady  One day The perul in the garden was on fire with tanagers I saw it burning  I wonder where you were  Yesterday the flower woman brought me violets Cape jasmine dark roses   When are you coming  Today the yucca has finished building her tower of ivory   It is late What excuse will you offer Grace Hazard Conkling   RECOMPENSE  You are growing old my lithe and gay  But age with you is different and rare  Gray yes but like the mist that veils an autumn moon  Stretched across the black trees gaunt array  Your light now opalescent and more gently bright  Makes beautiful the wintry night  Why do you long for the bronze hue of youth  Or the noisiness of its display  Let us be comforted in this sweet quietness where  There is nothing loved before But that our having loved so long can make more fair  THE SWEET LADY  She is so gay Such easy sweetness falls away From her Her words are simple as a little wind That sings all day Such lazy kindliness she spreads about As thoughtless as her hands that twine And turn their pink palms in and out Such loving weariness has she Of giving sweetness forth unthinkingly That she is almost sad still smiling sad Tired with her all unknowing ministry  Anne Elizabeth Wilson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ANNOTATIONS  JEREMIAD  What avail are these days The days come and the days go Limping like old men Over an uneven pathway  Day follows day And each day Falls over my last memory of you Like a thin white sheet Over a dead body Day after day Sheet upon sheet Until now I cannot see The lines of the dead body underneath  What avail are these nights The nights come and the nights go Shambling like heavy negresses Walking down a steep path With overflowing baskets on their heads  Night follows night And each night Falls over my last memory of you Like a heavy black sheet over a dead body Night follows night   Marx G Sabel  Sheet falls upon sheet  Until now I cannot see  The lines of the dead body underneath  What avail are these days  And these nights  These halt men and these  Cumbersome negresses burdened with baskets Day after day Night after night Sheet upon sheet Black on white Falling over a dead body Covering a dead body Falling upon and covering my memory of you  NO GOOD THING  It is no good thing Even on a dark night To clutch a memory for guidance I know because I have tried it Confidently I walked on in the dark night Remembering I walked on and on Yet no star shone   And there was no light nor even any ghost of light Ever To guide me  I shall walk on in the dark night Forgetting I shall clutch no memory for guidance I shall walk on and on Accepting the darkness Proudfully fearlessly without hope For it is no good thing Even on a dark night To clutch a memory for guidance  THE STRANGE LOAD  Things have come to a fine pass Just now As I sat teasing shy thoughts A strange load lifted Of its own volition  Maybe I should make a moan Or gurgle in my throat a bit On losing suddenly And for no apparent reason The strange load The little weight of chosen sorrowings The small warm woes of love   Marx G Sabel  Little lady whom my heart has nurtured The pressure of your petulance Has passed Your eyes chatoyancy In the deep dark night of my heart s heart Has faded And the phosphorescent glimmers of your body In the center of my mind Have faded  Faded lifted faded Entirely done away with  Shall I miss the strange load lifted Having carried it so far So long with such great care  Now I arise from a cramped posture Now I slowly swing my shoulders back And take a deep breath  Now I shatter heights of thin air Stretching forth rejuvenescent fingers  Yes surely Things have come to a fine pass A fine pass indeed  Marx G Sabel  POETRY A Magazine of Verse COMMENT  A WORD ABOUT KEATS  To remember in December a February centenary that is plainly an editor s duty In that plain duty the editors of POETRY plainly failed else would they have prepared the February number with reference to Keats No poet on our list having aspired to challenge Adonais with an elegy the editor should have indeed would have paid a brief prose tribute to a spirit whose flaring fame no longer needs one  As it is the month has gone by but not the year a year also sacred to Dante who died at Ravenna September fourteenth 1321 leaving his work achieved and complete after a rounded life of fifty six rich years Of all English poets since Shakespeare there may be two Keats and Synge who gave promise of genius as powerful and shapely as Dante s and of mind and will as capable of fulfilling its high serene commands and these two by the same tragic hazard were fatally interrupted by illness and early death  The Quarterly s reception of Keats has become a byword it is so easy for the casual inheritor of opinions to be wise after the fact But after all the youthful bard was trying out a new instrument and even Shelley himself was not at once impressed for he said of Endymion The author s intention seems to be that no person should possibly get to the end of it not to speak of Byron   A Word About Keats  whose remarks are almost unprintable So far as this luscious and exuberant exercise of youthful genius is concerned I sympathize with Shelley for I never could read it through without liberal skipping Ditto Hyperion but then my appetite for modernized Greek myth is distinctly limited I cannot appreciate the intensity and complexity of symbolic and spiritual meaning which Keats and many other poets have read into and wrung out of a folk lore beautiful in its original primitive simplicity  Isabella or the Pot of Basil was a more Chaucerian stunt of verse narrative a tale drawn from Boccaccio s rich mediaeval storehouse a pretty thing but slight even the poet soon tired of it called it mawkish Lamia also did not quite come off And the beauty of The Eve of Saint Agnes exquisite as it is is of the fragile the dreamily artificial kind like a Venetian goblet blown in many colored glass  These all were preparatory What have we to assert triumphantly the immortality of Keats the master We have a half dozen lyrics of beauty incredible and supreme beauty which admits this youth to the innermost magic circle of all the rich domain of English poetry the circle haunted by Shakespeare s voice by a few strains from Marlowe and Spenser from Coleridge and Shelley and Blake while beyond near but not quite within one may hear the chanting of Milton and of old John Donne and perfect chords from Burns Byron and Poe leading   on many others a number of moderns among them poets ever to be remembered who have sung a few songs or maybe only one too beautiful to perish  The Ode to a Nightingale and the ballad La Belle Dame sans Merci any long life were richly charged with these two poems alone And when we add to these the other great odes the Grecian Urn Autumn Melancholy Bards of Passion and of Mirth and certain sonnets On Chapman s Homer When I Have Fears and the last one of all Bright Star one must say Wonderful wonderful and feel that what Death robbed us of might have added to the mass but hardly to the splendor of this poet s gift  But what a man gives be he poet beggar or king is always himself and the fascinating thing about Keats imperishable gift is the torch like beauty of that glorious spirit which went flaming through the cluttered world for a few brief years leaving a cleared path for men s souls to walk in He saw straight and true in a perplexed and distracted age  Beauty is truth truth beauty that is all Ye know on earth and all ye need to know  To him Byron s rebellions Shelley s reforms were negligible details in the rounded spiritual experience of man To him as to Blake nothing is pleasing to God except the glad invention of beautiful and exalted things He knew that beauty includes all perfections sublunary and subliminal that it is the magic circle which encloses them all giving form and symmetry to the created uni   A Word About Keats  verse and to that infinitesimal detail of it the life and dreams of man  And then the tragic poignancy of his suffering for unfulfilled love and early death caught his spirit unready and unreconciled and the great things he had done seemed slight to his despair in contrast with those high piled books unwritten in his teeming brain Of course we know now that his disease was a direct infection from the young brother whom he had nursed tenderly to the end and that the medical malpractice of his time speeded him off as fast as possible by prescribing a starvation diet It is small consolation to feel that today a science more enlightened might have saved him to round out Dante s fifty six years and rival the majestic mass of the great Italian s completed labors Fortunately there is a higher consolation a few perfect poems which being perfect are therefore in themselves complete sufficient  H M  THE SUB CONSCIOUS CLICHE  To what extent does language created and constantly influenced by a nation s thinking react upon the thinking which creates it  Rabindranath Tagore brought this old question of the philologists to my mind afresh when he said recently in Chicago speaking of transferring his poems from Bengali to English It was not like translating it was recreating in another medium   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I take this to mean that the English words themselves influenced the thought back of the poems since this thought must have been the same in both cases So it has occurred to me that the influence of words in our mother tongue is probably so ingrained in us that we are unable to perceive it but that in a foreign tongue we might be able to catch a glimpse of its action And I have been amusing myself by comparing the stock poetical clichés of several languages I do not mean the stock similes for the influence would be too hard to trace here but the rhyme clichés in which it is more apparent I know only two other languages French and German well enough to do anything with this but I wish some more scholarly poet would consider it  A tendency is so much easier to recognize in its exaggerated forms when it reduces itself ad absurdum that I shall offer as examples the worst possible clichés  They pertain it seems in all languages to the tender sentiments The word heart for example In English the standard rhymes to it are part and dart Part follows naturally enough perhaps But why should we out of the innumerable images pertaining to love have fastened with such tenacity to that of Cupid s dart and the concrete image of a pierced heart except that it rhymes I can find no such persistent reference indeed very little reference at all in either French or German doggerel to this particular image Has not the accidental physical sound of the words foisted it on us In German the   The Sub conscious Cliche  standard rhymes to Herz are Schmerz pain and Scherz a gay whimsy orjoke In French coeur is a syllable more easily rhymed so the clichés are less marked but pleure seems to be the most common with meure a close second In all of these it appears that the melancholy side of love is uppermost in the mind of the budding poet of whatever nation But the precise form this melancholy takes would seem to depend on the rhymes he finds to hand  In this connection French offers an excellent example The word tendresse of which the French are very fond has a cliché ivresse literally drunkenness but figuratively rapture which follows it everywhere This image of being drunk on love is so seldom found in either English or German that one cannot help thinking it is suggested by the rhyme  Sometimes of course the natural sequence of ideas happens to rhyme and so the words become wedded as kiss and bliss or eyes and skies which last curiously enough since the words are both of northern origin rhyme also in French yeux and cieux But how about our English rhymes for love above and dove Is either of these ideas inherent in the idea of love L amour on the other hand seems to suggest to the sentimental Frenchman toujours though this follows more naturally and is not a perfect rhyme In German Liebe is difficult to handle and is most often either lopped off or imperfectly rhymed with trube forlorn  Of the clichés on other subjects life in English is accom   panied by strife naturally enough perhaps but more persistently than elsewhere And to the French patrie seems to carry with it most frequently tyrannie Country in English doesn t rhyme easily but we are apt to distort it to rhyme with free Germany which is fond of its Lieder brings in constant reference to Flieder lilacs for no very visible reason except the rhyme There are others of course but these are enough to point the question  Perhaps the poetaster who is responsible for these clichés does not set down in them what he wants to say but what he can say and certainly the better poet being more accustomed to riding the only half tractable steed of language hesitates to use them But is it not possible that the association of ideas started by the rhyme has driven with these better poets down into the subconscious whence it emerges in other forms than those required by the rhyme Have we not even in better English lyrics more reference to the dove though it be carefully Unrhymed and more wounded hearts than we should otherwise have Do not the French think more often of rapture and the Germans of lilacs because of this  Short of some instrument of precision on the order of that which my doctor friend invented in a dream one night after a bout with several poets an instrument which measured with scientific exactitude the value of a poem and gave it a number like the Bertillon system there will probably be no definite answer to this question But the idea has amused me E T   REVIEWS  FROM NEW MEXICO  Red Earth Poems of New Mexico by Alice Corbin  Ralph Fletcher Seymour Chicago  If a book is born out of high deliberation then the shrewdest comment on it shall come out of high deliberation  There are books all aloof from life s tumult like out of the way corner haunts where the flair of life equals the most vivid of flowers and the mob the stenches the clumping feet and the poking sightseers are not of it  Such a book is Alice Corbin s Red Earth clean and aloof as the high deliberate table lands where it was written elusive as the grave questioning faces of the dying nations of copper skinned people whose last homes are there  Here is a poem Trees and Horses It reads  Trees stand motionless among themselves Some are solitary Horses wander over wide pastures At night they herd closely Rumps hunched to the wind  The verbal weaving here is simple and direct as the stripes in an Indian blanket Of course there are touch and go readers who would get this as only an over stressed statement of livery stable fact Still others of us get an impressionist painting of few lines   Those who read a poem hear a song look at a picture must have seen some semblance of the thing the artist is trying to tell sing or paint else it is no use at all to read hear or look at what that artist attempts to deliver Take Afternoon as Alice Corbin saw it once on the high deliberate plateau of New Mexico  Earth tips to the west And the hills lean backward Cedar trees Hugging the hillsides  Smoke drifts in the valley The pinto sun Nickers over the gate Of the home corral  Here is a woman who has read nearly all books of importance and in the centres of so called culture absorbed wide ranges of intellectual fact And in the piece titled Sunlight written amid the aloof heights of New Mexico she voices the heart of a myriad of sunburnt farmers and farmers wives who joined the ashes of their ancestors with peace and few regrets Sunlight reads  The sunlight is enough And the earth sucking life from the sun Horses in a wide field are a part of it Dappled and white and brown Trees are another kind of life Linked to us but not understood Whoever can understand a horse or a tree Can understand a star or a planet But one may feel things without understanding Or one may understand them through feeling   From New Mexico  The simple light of the sun is enough One will never remember A greater thing when one dies Than sunlight falling aslant long rows of corn Or rainy days heavy with grey sullen skies Not love not the intense moment of passion Not birth is as poignant As the sudden flash that passes Like light reflected in a mirror From nature to us  The last five lines are five too many The fault is the crime of adjectives and negations that blur too dark a gray over the already decently crossed slants of afternoon light  Joseph Warren Beach once wrote of a poet He has been known to cry but never to weep That would apply to Red Earth the book  Attractions of a house swept and garnished ready for a hurdy gurdy or the undertaker an open door for tambourines and bells or crape and a coffin there is a hospitality that widely varied in Red Earth  Here is an Indian song only four lines to be read a hundred times and then again It is called The Wind and goes  The wind is carrying me round the sky The wind is carrying me round the sky My body is here in the valley  The wind is carrying me round the sky  Carl Sandburg   MR AIKEN S BOW TO PUNCH  Punch The Immortal Liar by Conrad Aiken Alfred A  Knopf  Four years ago I reviewed for POETRY a book by Conrad Aiken Turns and Movies it was called Looking back at that review I see that I accused him of being derivative always haunted by the ghosts of the other story tellers in verse And I added  This is the more unfortunate because Mr Aiken has invention vividness compression and at times a pleasing lyric quality His situations are real situations swiftly told his technique easy and effective It is hard to say just where the authenticity seeps out yet the total effect is that of a clever craftsman working well in the medium of his day yet never quite reaching to the heights  Today that accusation no longer stands the authenticity no longer seeps out Conrad Aiken has found himself  Punch The Immortal Liar is a real achievement All the good qualities of his earlier work are here the invention and swiftness and surety of his narrative sense the vividness of phrase and of situation and they are no longer troubled by ghosts Even the witty acerbity which in Mr Aiken s prose criticism in Scepticisms and elsewhere makes one instinctively doubt his judgments feeling that some personal complex must underlie so inclusive a displeasure even this acerbity is of value in Punch since one cannot doubt Mr Aiken s judgment of a character of his own invention  Developing the technique he used so effectively in   Mr Aiken s Bow to Punch  Sen in Mr Aiken has divided his poem into a number of short facets telling the story from different angles This cutting the story apart serves a double purpose it avoids the strain put upon poetry by a long sustained narrative a strain which the medium can seldom if ever survive and it serves to throw his character into relief to show Punch in the round  The section called What Punch Told Them contains a real masterpiece of bragging the good old robust bragging of burlier days with a big sweep of imagination a dash of Rabelais and a fine abandon The pathetic inadequacy of the man behind the bragging as it is later revealed comes with great poignancy  To my thinking however the Epilogue is a mistake Mr Aiken has thoroughly established in the body of the story the thesis that all men are puppets And when the reader has accepted this it is disconcerting to find it stated explicitly in the epilogue that the author of the book is no exception to the rule of mankind But this is quite unable to spoil what is otherwise a very fine piece of work  Here is a lyric spoken to Punch in a dream which gives the mood of the gallant and pathological braggadocio of the story  Solomon clown put by your crown And Judas break your tree Seal up your tomb and burn your cross Jesus of Galilee  For here walks one who makes you seem But atoms that creep in grass   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  You are the pageant of his dream And he will bid you pass  Let Rome go over the earth in gold With trumpets harshly blown For here comes one whose splendor burns More gloriously alone  Heliogabalus laugh your last Queen Sappho lie you down Punch the immortal shakes the seas And takes the sun for crown  E T  A CONTRAST  In American by John V A Weaver Alfred A Knopf The Well of Being by Herbert Jones John Lane Co  These two books offer an interesting contrast of character mood manner Here are two young American poets starting out from the same town Chicago with talent and literary ambition The one explores the neighboring streets shops parks and his first book presents the everyday adventures of every day city people in the slangy jargon with which they disguise the English language The other goes to London as the best place in which to work out a literary career and seeks beauty not in common life but in refined and sophisticated experience Two sonnets both love lyrics will present the resulting contrast better than pages of disquisition The first An Revoir is from Mr Weaver s book  Don t kiss me Not no more Oh can t you see Evcrythin s perfect now the way it is   A Contras  Why do I hafta fight and beg like this It s been so sweet oh can t you leave things be  Oh now I hurt you Dear don t look so sad Oh gee I guess men ain t got ways to know How a girl feels and when it s time to go  And how too much of even kisses is bad  But it s the things you didn t just quite do And what s left over for some other day That makes her wonder and hope and cry and pray  And tell herself Next time and dream of you Good night dear you must go it s for your sake I ll dream about that kiss you didn t take   Mr Jones sonnet is number XXVIII in a sequence of  sixty two  I know how it will be when we have met After these months which you as well as I Have spent in longing you ll be very shy Your grey eyes very bright a little wet You ll kiss me in the station crowd and yet When we re alone you ll blush and laugh and try Not to be shy and fail and wonder why And ask me if I ll have a cigarette  Doubtless I ll smoke it but I ll watch meanwhile The play of light and shadow blush and smile Over your face so quiet yet so stirred No matter if you think your mood absurd Bashful when you re alone with me I know How that will vanish in one soft breathed Oh  Both young men perhaps are feeling their way as yet toward their different goals There is nothing final nothing fully demonstrated in either book The danger in the one case is of course super sophistication an intellectual thinning out of emotion and a too dapper use of an   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  over studied instrument In the other case the danger is vulgarization a danger which may become a persistent and aggressive temptation if Mr Weaver s book proves a best seller so that popular magazines and newspaper syndicates try to make its author a rival of Walt Mason  As yet neither young poet has yielded to the danger Mr Jones poetry while slight as yet and naively full of clichés has a certain authentic youthful delicacy a delicacy a bit too gentlemanly perhaps but sincere and sweet as if he were playing with grace and feeling old fashioned airs on a flute And in Mr Weaver s book there is no vulgarity for no dialect that passes through human lips is vulgar per se however snobs may call it so in Piccadilly or Madison Street and these poems in the American language are lifted above vulgarity by the genuine human emotion in them the authentic characterization the unexpected little turns of pathos tenderness or humor  Sometimes Mr Weaver s imagination is adventurous but the leap is usually justified as in Moonlight Say listen If you could only take a bath in moonlight Hey Can t you just see yourself Take a runnin dive Inta a pool o glowin blue Feel it glidin over you All aroun and inta you Grab a star huh Use it for soap Beat it up to bubbles And white sparkin foam   A Contrast  Roll and swash  Gee  I just like to bet  You could wash your soul clean  In moonlight  Sometimes the monologues of a bar keep perhaps or a drug store man seem harsh in their bald realism but in each case the poet gives us a hint of the man s dream shows us the special queer glint that lights his life It is vital stuff this book a good rich promise  The pïece de resistance in Mr Jones volume is a love story in a thousand lines of rhymed verse a quiet tale simply told of a youth and maid meeting here and there in Europe and falling joyously in love The description of the girl will suggest the style  A beauty Never Something far more rare A spirit bright and flame like straight and clear That shone from laughing eyes and filled the air Around her knowing neither doubt nor fear A little out of breath with glowing cheeks As if the sun and tingling frost were brought Into the room with her and when she speaks Her quaint and happy phrases come unsought  The story moves along with a certain soft music in a style more mature than that of the sonnets There is a faint delicate perfume in it as of a genuine and sensitive youthfulness Mr Jones will have to guard against temptations toward literary sophistication which beset an American aspirant in London Probably he would be in less danger at home perhaps he needs crude contacts   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It will be interesting to watch these two young Chicago poets travelling such different roads from the same start  ing point H M STILL A SOUL TO SAVE Before Dawn Huebsch by Irene Rutherford McLeod B W  On the jacket of Before Bawn appears the same portrait of Miss McLeod which adorned the extremely promising Songs to Save a Soul published several years ago The fact is significant Miss McLeod has not developed She is still trying to save her soul but she has grown a trifle weary in the process  Most of the poems express a woman s reaction to the war One does not doubt the author s sincerity but fresh deep rooted poignancy is lacking And there is a lack of reticence of restraint qualities hardly to be expected in a poet who writes of a lover and his beloved as twin ships of joy upon a summer sea  Included in the book is a sequence of sixteen inconsequential sonnets There are good lines but enough atrocious ones to appal or amuse the reader for example  How sexual education still is rotten  Monogamy in males is nature s freak  This scorpion janitress whose watchful part Is to destroy who comes his heart to maim  Probably the best lines are at the end of one of the longer poems untitled like most of them   Still a Soul to Save  Patient Mother I have come  With some withered flowers home  Some were flowers some were weeds  Life has given to both their seeds  Lying in thy heart I pray  Winds may bear the weeds away  Where their roots shall sprawl in vain  But O my flowers spring again  For that matter Miss McLeod is at her best in her longer poems Maggie Winwood a narrative of some seven hundred rhymed octosyllabic lines has elements oí strength effectiveness in character portrayal and restraint Objectiveness is the saving grace of this poem as a somewhat futile subjectiveness explains the weakness of other poems in the volume Nelson Antrim Crawford  COLERIDGE AND WORDSWORTH  Coleridge s Biographia Literaria with Wordsworth s Preface  and Essays on Poetry University Press Cambridge  England  This caption summarizes the elaborate title of a work dealing with the earliest of the reform movements in modern English verse a work edited by George Sampson and introduced lengthily by Sir Arthur Quiller Couch The volume offers such portions of Coleridge s book as can be combined to form a shapely little treatise for the use of all who enjoy a poet s interpretation of poetry unclouded by the obscurity of yesterday s philosophy and also those Wordsworthian essays out of which the book arose and without which it might never have been written Quiller   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Couch s introduction offers a judicious union of the biographical the historical and the critical H B F CORRESPONDENCE  A LETTER FROM PARIS  My dear POETRY I was waiting for a masterpiece to unveil to you but the offerings if many have not been masterly Yet our muse has given a few golden songs I wish I might enclose in my letter something of their amiable beauty transmuted into the metal of your speech  Pierre Camo has published his Book of Regrets done in the mellifluous and azure tones of Ronsard and Chenier Camo is a troubadour from the Pyrenees who has pitched his tent in Madagascar his aloofness from Paris being the condition of his originality His classical prosody gives him a place apart from the crowd of modernists The sonnet the stanza are the genuine mold of his sensitiveness such molds might be crushed to dust in the topsyturvy productiveness of Paris  New books from Paul Valéry Georges Duhamel and Mallarmé have a somewhat different sound  Valery s works are few and most of them can be found only in reviews and anthologies Les Odes has just come out and La Nouvelle Revue Française has given us Sea Cemetery These works show an evolution in Valéry In his odes he turns back to the traditional forms of Racine   A Letter from Paris  Vigny Hugo yet he is a creator because of his breadth of vision and ecstasy Sea Cemetery is a meditation the poet stands before the graves where his dear ones sleep to the sea s perpetual chanting He sees their souls reborn in flowers A wide serenity carries him above the petty emotions of life  Fair sky true sky look down on me who change After so much pride after so much strange Idleness but pregnant with power I give myself up to this resplendent space On the roofs of the dead my shadow moves Subduing me to its fleeting frailty  Briny and cool water work an emotional change in the poet  The wind rises I must try to live The immense air opens and closes my book In foam dust the daring wave flashes from the rocks Away dazzled pages  Valery s verse unites the intellectual and verbal magics which Mallarmé blended so beautifully  George Duhamel s art is purely emotional His war meditations published as La Vie des Martyres have won world wide fame I am sure you have read some of them together with Barbusse s His Elegies are still permeated with the horror of those unforgotten scenes the Ballad of the Man with the Wounded Throat The Sadness of Sergeant Gautier the already famous Ballad of Florentin Prunier In the pages of the new book we hear the sighs of sleepless nights the rattle of dying throats the farewells of fellow   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  creatures But through the suffering we feel the approach of hope for the beauty of things earthly comes with biting acidity to the poet s heart Blossoming apple trees glittering sea a familiar street restore hope to his mind The Elegies hesitate between despair and bliss a smile exquisitely veiled with tears  I knew you happiness Despair I know you In turns have you not tortured My slavish heart  Of his Ballad of Florentin Prunier I shall quote a few lines The hero s mother has come from the farthest frontier of the provinces  She carries a basket with twelve apples  And fresh butter in a small pot All day long she stays in her chair Near the bed where Florentin is dying  She stares obstinately  At the wan face damp with sweat She stares and never complains It is her way being a mother  For twenty long days he held death at bay  While his mother was near him At last one morning as she was weary With twenty nights spent God knows where  She let her head hang a little  And slept for a little while And Florentin Prunier died quickly And quietly not to waken her  The daughter of Stéphane Mallarmé has carefully gath   A Letter from Paris  ered a few hitherto unpublished lines of the famous writer of The Afternoon of a Faun An amiable distraction of a great poet that s what they seem to be Some of them are a series of addresses written in quatrains Some are inscriptions for red Easter eggs for New Year s gifts for fans A certain number of these quatrains are delightful trifles a few relate the funny little facts of life Particularly charming is Mallarmé s fancy when he writes to the ladies Everywhere we recognize the delicate mirage which his more familiar works have taught us to admire  I am glad I can associate such a stern production as Duhamel s with Mallarmé s precious grace Seriousness and fancy have always attended our muse a new blending of them seems to be in the making  If the influences of Moréas and Rimbaud are still discernible in the verse of today yet a great deal of purely fanciful verse has been issued lately verse which reflects the ironical smile of Laforgue and Apollinaire The changes which the war has brought into our social life as well as our verse are suggested not only in serious poems but in occasional outbursts of gayety and fancy France may be a sober shall I risk saying puritanical country you should see her provincial towns and study her Parisian middle class but in spite of difficult circumstances in spite of an official gravity and its communicative gloom modern verse reflects the most diverse moods  Fancy has now left Montmartre Max Jacob is never at home to dwell with Jean Cocteau near the Champs   Elysées Having danced Auric s one step on the terrace of a fashionable sky scraper they both went back to the little band of their youth led by Poulenc at a street corner There they mixed up with soldiers nurses children and sentimental workmen  Back home the couple entertain their six musician friends and a few poets The apartment is simple of a refined poverty such as Okakura would have liked The chief ornament is a rose in a glass of water the very immortal French rose that Raymond Radiguet boasts of having thrown like a bomb in the Galerie des Machines full of modern and exotic monsters The poetry of this group aims to be as perfect as useless and as indispensable as red on beautiful cheeks as a rare wine or a silent promenade and some of Cocteau s and Radiguet s verse is not far from such perfection Jean Catel  THE WINTER S PUBLISHING IN ENGLAND  Dear POETRY The quite unnatural interest in poetry which the British public was stirred to by the emotional activity of the War has given way now broken down before another bad attack of the usual British lethargy in matters artistic Two books which a year or so ago would have won for their authors a wide as well as a narrow circle of readers Edmund Blunden s Waggoner Sidgwick amp Jackson and Alfred A Knopf and Wilfred Owen s Poems Chatto amp Windus books which have been greeted enthu   The Winter s Publishing in England  siastically by nearly all reviewers have achieved a reputation in the narrower sense it is true but have not reached the sales of far inferior stuff which appeared during those tragic years Edmund Blunden was recognized at once as a distinguished poet of English country life and Wilfred Owen whose posthumous war poems have now appeared is generally considered an abler war poet than Nichols Graves or even Sassoon himself He has an absolute clarity and intense vividness of vision and an unflinching sympathy which are hardly equalled anywhere in the poetry of the War  The Collected Poems of Edward Thomas Selwyn amp Blount and Henry Holt amp Co have now appeared with an introduction by Walter de la Mare A collected edition of Mr de la Mare s own poems has also appeared Martin Secher and Henry Holt amp Co but this does not unhappily include the poems published in illustration of Pamela Bianco s drawings in Flora Wm Heinemann in many respects his best work as well as his latest  W H Davies has published another volume the Song of Life Fifield which is in fair accord with his earlier work One of the most interesting books produced during the winter is Robert Graves Pier glass Martin Secher a work which shows that he is developing in a new and quite unexpected direction It is not a kind of poetry that is likely to be popular but such poems as The Gnat The Pier glass and The Jubilee Murder Cycle are an interesting variation from the usual modern trend   John Masefield s racing poem Right Royal is too widely known to need comment  The first number of a new annual anthology has appeared Mr Masefield contributing the introduction William Heinemann is the publisher and it is to present successive collections of Public School Verse thus in a way anticipating the poetry of the next generation The first number has discovered in P C Quennell of Berkhansted School at least one poet of surprising promise and no inconsiderable attainment It is to be hoped that those responsible will insure that his talent is not forced A second volume is in the press R Hughes OUR CONTEMPORARIES  KREYMBORG S MILLIONS  The Dial for May opens its page of

seven poems from our January number  The varied interest and beauty presented are typical of POETRY S quality Thanks to a rare coincidence of poise and generous imagination of sense and sensitiveness it ranks as easily the best vehicle of poetry in the English language  In the London Times of Nov 25th 1920 we read  We need not linger over the many English and French contributors to this periodical We do have to note that it has published as it honestly claims much of the best experimental poetry written by Americans in the past eight years They have succeeded in their primary design to create a poetry which should be American in thought feeling subject and form That is after all a distinct achievement  The Chicago Evening Post in commenting on POETRY S eighth birthday said  No editorship is infallible but it is rather interesting and enlightening to look over the old numbers of POETRY and to realize that the first important chance for publication in America was given to many poets almost unknown who have since obtained fame We wonder how many more may yet be helped POETRY is so far as we know unique in the length of its life recognized position and rigorously artistic standard  POETRY
