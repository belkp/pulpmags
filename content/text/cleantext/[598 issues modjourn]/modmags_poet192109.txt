BY PAUL FORT  LOUIS ELEVENTH CURIOUS MAN  OUIS ELEVENTH for trifles fain I love you curious man Dear chafferer in chestnuts discreetly did you plan to pluck the chestnuts of fair Burgundy You seemed all friendliness and courtesy Your hood was hung with images of lead and copper medals Watchers would have said your pious thoughts were fixed on things above Sudden you stooped your long arms outward drove Gently not even ruffling your sleek glove you filched a chestnut another half a dozen beneath the menacing gauntlet of your cousin  But if by chance he let his great fists fall upon your back your scrawny back you roared with laughter and his stolen goods restored Twas but an empty shell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Void were the chestnuts all Your gentle industry served your fortunes well  So I good singer sage of little worth pilfer both heaven and earth provinces of my brain under the hands of the Lord all light I deftly pull from His fingers the roses of the dawn the rings of the storm the lilies of starry nights and gain little ineffable images a heap of shining things stored up beneath my skull  To filch by slow degrees but sure sweet Louis Eleventh O man most rare May God good politician O rare among the Louis have you in His good care and as in days of old when you were pleased your favorite greyhound stretched beneath your breeches mildly to judge by that grateful warmth appeased beneath his golden slippers in Paradise may you be blest little king at rest his most fervent counsellor  And for having praised you counter to my teachers and with all candor having kept your law when the day of my doom is at hand when I in my turn shall stand awaiting judgment at the bar above pluck at God s robe that he place me in His love  THE MIRACULOUS CATCH  The tidings seemed so Heaven sent an uncle dead so apropos my dear little Louis Eleventh was fain to prop   Paul Fort translated by John Strong Newberry  erly express his glee and gain additional content with a modest fête but intimately in pleasant society  Master Tristan all imagination counseled a picnic in the plain and as he blinked with his sly red eyes I consent said the king Tis good advice You re an old villain though just the same  Next day neath skies of celestial blue gay and content my sweet little king Louis Eleventh with Tristan L Ermite and their fair frail friends Simonne of the Chains and Perrette of the Treasure together came to fish for the gudgeon that swim in the Seine at the reedy foot of the tower of Nesle  Master Oliver still a virgin stands sentry near the river s margin He strides along his tedious beat crushing the grass with careless feet Agape in boredom s black abyss no consolation can he find The fall of Buridan it is that occupies his mind  Simonne of the Chains soul and heart fast bound to the heart and soul of her well loved king like a dainty water lily bent above an ancient nenuphar on her lover s threadbare shoulder leant her bosom s snows her brow of milk her little nose of swan white silk and now and then the gracious king Louis of France with a tender look would bid his lovely handmaid bring a squirming maggot to bait his hook Then twas with such a melting charm that into a small green box she poured one   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  twas with such a sweet and profound appeal that she gave the creature all quivering to that reclining king her adored one that Louis the impulse no more restrains but kisses an ear not the ear of the maggot but that of Simonne of the Chains amorously whispering into its hollow meekly bent You shall be present when I call the Three Estates to Parliament  Perrette of the Treasure formerly King Louis light o love your pardon now bequeathed a charming guerdon to Tristan by royal clemency was plump and fresh as a rambler rose cheeks like a peach ample bosom bare where in duplicate glows the rising sun each breast an orb but a pointed one starred with grains of beauty ambulant fleas I would say whereon the gaunt Tristan from underneath his hood full often lets his glances brood And when good Tristan his line drawn taut a fresher maggot would fain acquire twas with a manner so languor fraught the plump dame granted this slight desire that quite transported with Cupid s blisses he dropped his line her side to gain The line released went flic flac floc and sank beneath the Seine while Perrette received on her neck all warm two or three hearty headsman s kisses  Master Oliver still a virgin stands sentry near the river s margin He strides along his tedious beat crushing the grass with careless feet Agape in boredom s   Paul Fort translated by John Strong Newberry  black abyss no consolation can he find The fall of Buridan it is that occupies his mind  He saw with inattentive eyes like a flower beside the river s brim a certain Master Villon skim the reeds in chase of dragonflies From eyes ablaze with anarchy a side long glance he sometimes sends towards the place where those boon companions ply the angler s art with their gentle friends Master Oliver still a virgin having other fish to fry that advent scarcely heeds Vaguely he saw Master Villon disrobe among the reeds but merely murmured in slumbrous tone like one who speaks in dreams That naked gentleman is not unknown to me it seems  And Tristan L Ermite landed naught And Louis Eleventh landed naught The maggots spun in vain in vain And Master François Villon now swimming in mid Seine as he floated whispered to his brother fish Liberty forever Don t let yourselves be caught  Gossip said Tristan if you are good and sage withal I here engage to give you a pass wherewith to break the cordon of the Scottish guard when I hang and when I decapitate Quoth Perrette of the Treasure A neat reward And continued Tristan in merry vein if your heart does not bid you the fatal view shun some fine spring morning you shall see the rapid and joyous execution of the virgin Oliver le Dain I ll be there   I ll be there responded Perrette clapping her hands with glee  Peace cried the king or this turbot I miss  A turbot seigneur is a fish of the sea timidly ventured the tender Simonne With my mother I ve sold full many a one in the market place of Saint Honoré in the time of my virginity A fish of the sea eh Then that was why I missed him The monarch made reply not disconcerted in the least  Days that are o er will return no more hummed Perrette on her hose intent Yes youth has only a single time Tristan intoned in hearty assent Thereat the timid the tender Simonne cooed to an air that is little known Twas twenty years ago my mother died It needed only that Tristan dissolved in tears While the king as he fished the wind chanted stentorianly No no my friends I do not wish a thing of naught to be  And Tristan L Ermite landed naught And Louis Eleventh landed naught In vain the tempting maggot spins The esthetic gudgeons loud applaud clapping their frantic fins Applaud no doubt is figurative but who knows what fantastic dream is truth in the depths where fishes live at the bottom of the stream  At the reedy foot of the tower of Nesle those cronies good headsman and king in chorus sing like birds of the   Paul Fort translated by John Strong Newberry  wood And about their floats the little fish waltz as sweetly as heart could wish  Master Oliver still a virgin stands sentry near the river s margin  Then suddenly Perrette smothered a laugh in her skirt My sweet little Louis Eleventh feeling his line drawn taut and heaving it up with ardor a king fisher had caught A wager Tristan said Simonne A winged gudgeon cried And Master Oliver halted dead in the middle of his stride  On my word the judgment was too empiric mused Villon swimming beneath the stream To fish for a gudgeon and catch a bird in the bourgeois soul of that curmudgeon mean somewhere survives the germ of a lyric  And about their floats the little fish waltzed as sweetly as heart could wish  THE LAMENT OF THE SOLDIERS  When they were come back from the wars their heads were seamed with bleeding scars Their hearts betwixt clenched teeth they gripped in rivulets their blood had dripped When they were come back from the wars the blue the red the sons of Mars   They sought their snuff boxes so fine their chests their sheets all spotless showing They sought their kine their grunting swine their wives and sweethearts at their sewing Their roguish children like as not crowned with a shining copper pot They even sought their homes poor souls they only found the worms and moles The carrion raven clamored o er them They spat their broken hearts before them  THE RETURN  Ivy has covered all the wall How many hours how many tears since last we loved How many years  No roses now Ivy has crushed the vine Soul whither didst thou go Climbing across the nests of nightingales ivy has stifled the whole chateau  Wind the deep wells are choked with the roses of yesterday Is that your hiding place O my dead wife  No one replies Who would reply Is it not best to listen to the wind that sighs through the grasses my sweet love  Flush with the roof the ancient crimson sun is cut through the midst so mournfully   Paul Fort translated by John Strong Newberry  Shall I bid the gardener come The gardener No It would be better to summon Death to reap the long grass  So many memories and so much love and the setting sun at the level of the earth  THE LITTLE SILENT STREET  The stormy silence stirs and hums Will there be none that this way comes  Cobblestones count geraniums Geraniums count the cobblestones  Dream young girl at your casement high Shelled green peas before you lie  They plump the apron white you try with rosy fingertips to tie  I pass in black from head to feet Is it forked lightning troubles thee  Young maiden or the sight of me The peas have fallen in the street  Sombre I pass Behind I see cobblestones count each fallen pea  The stormy silence stirs and hums Will there be none that this way comes   ETERNITY  One does not need to credit death The human heart to rest is fain O er sleeping fields the evening s breath dreams and I hear eternity chime in the bending ears of grain  Hark an angelus dies in heaven s blue height Be comforted Hours pass away Hushed is the belfry God doth wake The nightingale salutes the day hid in the turret s rose tree brake and in its turn will mourn the night  Hark once again the hour doth swell But the bell s already fast asleep Eternity is chiming deep borne by the sweet tormented breath of zephyr and of Philomel  One does not need to credit death  Translated from the French of Paul Fort by John Strong Newberry   STILL HUNT  OMINOUS CONCORD  As if I were Jeanne d Arc But wearier I prepare Answer and return To the prophetic air  My voice answering Voices of the unearthly nation With autumnal melody Of my own creation  Melody of alarm lest my So long imagined love retreat Into despair as sharp and fine As the print of sea gull s feet  They sing stilling my response With silvery indifference And what they mean or know Is like the falling of first snow An indecipherable cadence  WITHOUT SLEEP  He earns the oblivion of book and shelf Who will have for muse a Beatrice   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Sitting content by the hearth To whisper his history and thought  Poet uncuckolded he hears No mad ethereal crying For merciless cloud and ridge Tormented by the golden horn  Ah she will never lift Her intolerant head like a stag And scorn him thinking of wind And naked hunter and his hallooing hound  THE CHASTE LOVERS  Siberia is a land Drops from a cloud The shackles click Yet never loud  Upon a pavement Of the frost A road we know Yet still are lost  Within the semblance Of its cold Mile after mile Till we are old   Glenway Wescott  You and I man and maid Together form Procession or cavalcade Minute as a worm  Prisoners to each other And to these even less kind The bottomless beauty of body The bottomless pomp of mind  And perpetually discontent We eye the crows Or watch the weasel where it went Or hail the wind that blows  TO L S  I  O you Wing of the wind Why do you chant Ree ree with the mourning dove And dee dee with the male gannet  When you may live forever In the fray of her feathers And in the tumult of the dark wave Where he pillows In all weathers   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  II  Why the perpetual sway Of the air Why the rift of the heaven Into light and dark Into black and white of division  Women are deeper than sound They are the storm which continues In quiet in peace in sunshine Healing and building In the air the airy sinews  THE POET AT NIGHT FALL  I see no equivalents For that which I see Among words  And sounds are nowhere repeated Vowel for vocal wind Or shaking leaf  Ah me beauty does not enclose life But blows through it Like that idea the wind  Which is unseen and useless Even superseded upon The scarred sea   Glenway Wescott  Which goes and comes Altering every aspect The poplar the splashing crest  Altering all in that moment When it is not Because we see it not  But who would hang Like a wind bell  On a porch where no wind ever blows  THE HUNTER  You asked me what I did In peaked New Mexico Where lives the most wild beauty To which a man may go  And I answer that I pursued Content that would go in a song Upon its silvery mountains So vainly and so long  That if it were bear or lion Which I had hunted there I should now be like Orion Fixed hungry in the air  Glenway Wescott   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NIGHT  NADIR  I am part of lonely things Of this lonely city  A gold fish in a bowl Lowered into a lake Would feel the sleeping presence of fish Even as I Feel life withdrawn suspended   An immanence of life Like a remembered song of violins And oboes After a dance  Even the sound of my footsteps Dies in the snow  SUMACH  An old monk is my night   Long ago he was young Song shone between his lips And a necklace of round white arms Fulfilled his throat    John Crawford  Dried fruit of trees That blossom in bitterness Rustle on his bent shoulders Wry grey flesh festoons his yellow teeth   My night is old   BRACKISH WELL  If I were less than the sum of what I am I wonder  My eyes seek yours Coaxing the flame  If I were blind  If I were dumb And had no song  Say you would love me Blind and dumb Nothing to hold you Nothing to bind you to me Say you would love My spirit   I will say to you Go and love some puff of wind From a graveyard   ENDYMION  The universe Crumbles away Crawls away   A simoon Keyed down Hushed away To whispers   Trickling trickling Bare legs Impacts of sand grains Impacts of girls eyes  Up to my knees   Isolation Of flesh from flesh Slippery gritty Hands grip and slide Fingers roll On my face  Knee deep Waist deep Eyes prickling   It was my gift To catch their eyes Catch and hold their eyes   John Crawford  She knew that But She could not blind All their eyes  Waist deep Up to my arm pits   She found one Could keep my arms knit Body like a panther That one  Up to my eyes Sleep slides Grain by grain   What She did to you No one knows She ll never kill the feel of you With Her sand  Crumbling Crawling Creeping Ring about my neck   Yours Your hands at my throat Your lips   John Crawford  POETRY A Magazine of l erse  DESCENT  It is large life to sit on the door log Of the Hill Tavern Among the distinguished birches Standing in groups And look beyond the monotonous green floor Of the matted tree tops of the lower land To the high horizon and the barges And the purple island in a ring of gold  But I am of the lowland Of the undistinguished trees and juniper And must go down the deliberate trail Of the undistinguished dead And no noon  Below the bluff rim The trees now are more separate And individual of pattern But the dusk marries them to one another And their top branches intertwine Like parasols in a crowded park of listeners As far as the path leads to the valley terrace Then the black belt of tamarack And tangled bittersweet Is like the Lower Ten leaning on brothers To make stand against the uncertain winds And dying in the smother of a brief day   Ivan Swift  Out of this and on the far side I knew And the stranger would scarce surmise And rarely venture The sun dances in golden tack points On the near cool shallows of the sea The gray islands have gone down Over the world s rim And the freight barges are companion buoys Floating in pairs under thin smoke fans The ring of gold is at my feet glistening Washed clean by the white surf reefs Broken by the blue shadow of a gull A single tiger lily Flames in a whorl of beach juniper  Ivan Swift  AT NIGHT  Sometimes at night I hear the dark Wide and wind shaken calling me I should get up and flying high Above the tree tops to the sea Scream till the waves scream back at me  Marian Thanhouser   SPINNERS  SHE LONGS FOR THE COUNTRY  It is the May time now And in a place I know Some girl God will allow To see the cowslips blow  And the hyacinths the fern That grow by the riversides Narcissi white and stern Like sad unwilling brides  Some other girl will run And dancing through the grass Will laugh in the wholesome sun And feel the sweet hours pass  Laugh and be merry oh Laugh Laugh and play for me Go where the sweet flowers grow And see what I cannot see  THE SPINNERS AT WILLOWSLEIGH  The young girl passes by  The old women sit at Willowsleigh They spin And shriek and sing above the humming din   Marya Zaturensky  They are so very old and brown and wise One is afraid to look them in the eyes  Their bony fingers make a chilly sound Like dead bones shaking six feet underground  Their toothless singing mocks they seem to say What I was yesterday you are today  Stars kissed my eyes the sunlight loved my brow You ll be tomorrow what I am now  They dream and talk they are so old and lean And the whole world is young and fresh and green  Once they were flowers and flame and living bread Now they are old and strange and almost dead  The old women spin at Willowsleigh they fool And scold and sleep Once they were beautiful  SONG OF A FACTORY GIRL  It s hard to breathe in a tenement hall  So I ran to the little park  As a lover runs from a crowded ball  To the moonlit dark  I drank in clear air as one will Who is doomed to die   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Wistfully watching from a hill The unmarred sky  And the great trees bowed in their gold and red Till my heart caught flame And my soul that I thought was crushed or dead Uttered a name  I hadn t called the name of God For a long time But it stirred in me as the seed in sod Or a broken rhyme  A SONG FOR VANISHED BEAUTY  The house is desolate and bare So long ago young Honora left Her quiet chair  Through the rose bordered gardens reft Of all her pretty tender care The silent hall the lonely stair  No one can see her anywhere Here is her shawl her fan her book She is not there  No one remembers her bright hair Or how she looked or when Death came Few can recall her name   Marya Zaturensky  Where shall we turn to hope or look For beauty vanished like an air In what forgotten tomb or nook  AN OLD TALE  What shall we say of her Who went the path we knew of She is dead What shall we say of her  Men who are very old Still speak of her They say That she was far too beautiful they say Her beauty wrought her ruin But they Are very old  The old wives break their threads they shake their  heads They shake their heads when men will speak of her They say she was too beautiful  I must not think of her I must Not speak of her My mother says One should not think of her  She went the path we knew of she is dead They say few knew her truly while she lived Though men will speak of her  It really does not matter she is dead One need not think of her although one night   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Folks heard her weeping yet beside a pool One moonlit springtime I could swear she sang But she

retreat Closes its wings and shrinks a frightened bird  Oh I have known a peace once I have known The joy that could have touched a heart of stone The heart of holy Russia beating still Over a snow cold steppe and on a hill One day in Kiev I heard a great church bell Crying a strange farewell  And once in a great field the reapers sowing Barley and wheat I saw a great light growing Over the weary bowed heads of the reapers As growing sweeter stranger ever deeper From the long waters sorrowfully strong Came the last echoes of the River Song  Here in this alien crowd I walk apart Clasping remembered beauty to my heart  Marya Zaturensky   CHARLES THE TWELFTH OF SWEDEN RIDES IN THE UKRAINE  Kings in old legends seem Like mountains rising in the evening light They blind all with their gleam Their loins encircled are by girdles bright Their robes are edged with bands Of precious stones the rarest earth affords With richly jeweled hands They hold their slender shining naked swords  A young king from the North did fare Defeated in the Ukraine  He hated springtime and women s hair  And the sound of the harps refrain  Upon a steel grey horse he rode  And like steel was his grey eyes glance  Never for woman had they glowed  And to none had he lowered his lance  Never a woman his colors claimed  And none to kiss him would dare For at times when his quick wrath flamed A moon of pearls he would tear From a coil of wondrous hair When seized by melancholy mood He wreaked his will of a maid as he would And the bridegroom whose ring she wore pursued   Through the glade and across the heath With a hundred hounds for many a rood Till he hunted him to his death  He left his grey land dim and far Whose voice to him never spake And rode out under the thrall of war And fought for danger s sake Now he seemed under a spell to ride Dreamily slipping his steel gloved hand Over his armor from band to band But found no sword at his side And then a miracle occurred A glorious vision of battle stirred And fired his kindling pride He sat on his horse and glanced around No movement escaped him and no sound Steel unto steel in silver spoke Voices were now in everything Like many bells they seemed to ring As the soul of each thing awoke The wind too stealthily onward crept And suddenly into the flags it sprang Lean like a panther breathless leapt Reeling as blasts from the trumpets rang It wrestled and laughed and sang Then again it would softly hum As by some bleeding boy it would dart   Rainer Maria Rilke translated by Jessie Lemont  Beating a rally upon his drum Carried with uplifted head Into the grave borne like his heart Before his battalions dead Many a mountain upward reared As though the earth not yet old had grown But in the making still appeared And now the iron stood still as stone And then like a forest at evening swayed And ever the rising shape still neared The army s mightily moving shade The dust rose up like vapors veiled Darkness not of time enveloped all And everything grew grey and paled And smoke rose up and fell like a pall Again flame broadened and grew bright And all was festively in light They attacked the exotic colors reeled On swarms of fantastic provinces rode All iron with laughter suddenly pealed From a prince in luminous silver flowed The gleam of the evening battle field Like fluttering joys flags seemed to thrill Each gesture now showed the desire To regally waste to wantonly spill The flames leapt on far buildings till The stars themselves caught fire   Night came And the battle s surging range  Receded like a tired sea  That brought with it many dead and strange  And all the dead lay there heavily  The grey horse cautiously picked its way  Past great fists starkly warning it back  In a foreign land the dead men lay  Where it stepped over grass that was matted and black  And he who upon the grey horse sat  Looked down on the colors moist and frayed  Saw silver like shivered glass ground flat  Saw iron wither and helmets drink  And swords stand stiff in the armor s chink  Saw dying hands waving tattered brocade   And saw them not  After the tumult of battle he rode Onward as though in a trance alone And as with passion his warm cheeks glowed Like those of a lover his grey eyes shone  Translated from the German of Rainer Maria Rilke by Jessie Lemont   COMMENT  DANTE AND TODAY  On the fourteenth of this month Dante Alighieri will have been dead six hundred years Therefore the whole world is thinking of him and his spirit seems to be questioning the changes of six centuries challenging modern civilization Aristocrat and monarchist that he was he was of too immense stature not to have deeply humane sympathies his work was not for the elect in his day the classically educated but for the people of his time and tongue and thus for the people of all times and tongues Indeed it is symbolically significant that the three greatest men in Italian literature Dante Petrarca and Boccaccio wrote in the dawn of that literature in what was called il volgare the language spoken by the volgo the people Although this does not make of Dante a person of democratic tendencies still it points out again that all great things have their foundations in the volgo as all buildings in the earth  Dante Petrarca Boccaccio they embody the three traditions Boccaccio was the artist who works to entertain and amuse his public Among the thousands who follow this tradition are the buffoons as Papini calls them the souls sold to the public which the public buys with large sums Petrarca is the delicate artist for whom only the inner world exists in whose trail a thousand outcasts egocentrics morphinomaniacs came for whom   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  delicacy is not a luxury as it is for the strong but rather an incurable idiosyncrasy Dante embodies the greatest tradition that of those who through literature judge men and the times besides being representative of that sturdy healthy beauty which has a greater claim on longevity  Dante gathered into what is perhaps the most powerful work of all literatures all the history and philosophy and part of the science of his time He classified men and judged them but his judgment is like the history contained in the Commedia essentially and terrifically mediaeval A fierce god is this merciful god who gets a vengeance a thousandfold more terrible than the crime than any crime And a fierce little man it was who went wandering into hell cursing each and all of the Italian cities and several of the foreign ones and their unfortunate inhabitants for some slight reason or other Today his ethics are dead they are at best the skeleton around which the beautiful immortal flesh of Dante s words was cast Dante s words only an Italian and a good Italian may know the magical beauty of them The poignant dramatic beauty of his Conte Ugolino and the sweetness of his Francesca and the marvelous images scattered throughout his work like pearls and diamonds over a gorgeous gown  But as I say his ethics like the history in his work are past and dead We know now that hell is not necessary there is nothing so horrible that it may not be   Dante and Today  found at one time or another upon the face of our earth We have developed a philosophy which is more apt to give life all the credit due to life We are waiting for the poet who will give us a Divina Commedia of our own times but it is something entirely different from Dante s that we expect A hell more terrific than the hell of Dante is the hell of modern warfare an immense eyeless stupid machine that batters mangles crushes distorts tortures crazes men And as if this were not terrible enough men are studying how to contrive more terrible means to kill and the next war it is said will be mostly a war of gas and germs Henri Barbusse and Andreas Latzko gave us some horrible glimpses of the War But they left still a great area unmeasured an area perhaps immeasurable perhaps impenetrable  The world has become overcrowded human beings are lost in it and nobody knows This twentieth century world erects horrible structures that look like skeletons skeletons of a thing already dead living now in hell The mechanical cities loom like the menace of the future over our rivers over and under them the continual uproar of locomotives soul rending passes Railways hold the earth in a terrible embrace And the makers of these are business men who do not see and workers whom a whirlwind sweeps into this modern tremendous factory and leaves there like fledglings caught in the blast of an immense furnace Out of this factory the human soul comes crushed out of this factory of neurosis the modern world Ma   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  chines and neurosis out of this factory The last trees are pushed farther and farther away by the oncoming cities And there isn t a breeze but brings to them the feverish breath of the cities Paradise might be the peace and the happiness that man has in spite of the world he himself builds  This is Dante s challenge to a poet of today Who will tune down this noise arrange this turmoil find one voice in this chaos of voices His task will be a hundred times more arduous than Dante s Dante s conception of his narrow world was centered around two main hypotheses that of the absolute monarchy and that of the Roman Catholic power the Pope A modern poet would require besides Dante s great genius the energy to gather together in his thought a world which facility of transportation and science in general have made enormous  The question as to whether a poet should be concerned in this great outer world as opposed to the petty inner world of daily moods cares worries and affection is a ridiculous question And ridiculous is the thesis of the esthetic critic when he proposes that the individual who accomplishes the feat of expressing himself ably has thereby attained art implying that a mole s observation of life is as valid as that of a soaring eagle who sees the world from above the horizons  But there are still eagles Walt Whitman the multitudinous man for whom the world was a purgatory of striving joy and self redeeming pain he enumerated at   Dante and Today  least the modern world And Verhaeren with his Villes Tentaculaires put down some of the horror of it But it is either an Inferno only or a Purgatorio or a Paradiso only that the poets of the six centuries since Dante have accomplished No one has attained Dante s completeness  Emanuel Carnevali  JOHN ADAMS PROPHECY  Not long ago The Freeman reminded us of a penetrating remark of old John Adams first grand chief of the Adams clan and second president of the United States Nay not old for he was only forty five and still seventeen years from the seat of Washington when he wrote to his wife in 1780  I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy geography natural history and naval architecture navigation and commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting poetry music architecture statuary tapestry and porcelain  In 1780 America was quite innocent of art or rather such art as it had colonial architecture a few imported paintings plays poems it took quite innocently with abstemious discretion And Adams if not himself a thorough Puritan was only four generations from that Henry Adams who according to his tombstone in Quincy took his flight from the Dragon Persecution in Devonshire England and landed with eight sons near Wolles ton And the Puritan hostility to art and all its works   was it not attested by the closing of theaters the destruction of old churches the sale of Charles I s collection to Spain and other temporarily convincing devices to crush out the universal human instinct for creating beauty  Therefore it is surprising to find this eighteenth century wise man bequeathing the arts as a glorious heritage to his grandsons yet unborn and feeling his own hard labors in the founding of a nation to be a mere preliminary to that end Probably he never asked the much reiterated modern question What is art never debated whether it was an iridescent rust of the mind the beginning of disintegration or a white heat of creative energy the fulmination of spiritual planets and moons new dwellings for the soul of man  The nation John Adams helped to found has passed on to the third or fourth generation beyond him without yet getting its machinery into such perfect running order as to free its citizens for the active and creative life of the spirit There is plenty of machinery but it proves cumbersome it clogs For few descendants of those nation makers are capable of freedom they are bound hand foot and spirit to the machine and their unconscious effort is to bind in the same fashion those who could and would be free and thereby to conceal the evidence of their own slavery  Probably each age has its due proportion of artists actual or potential that is its due proportion of creatively imaginative minds Even John Adams time though   John Adams Prophecy  barren in artistic product was probably no more barren than any other in artistic impulse Certain square minded historians and critics are always talking of great artistic periods as if the artists who illuminate them were necessarily born in clusters as if between these clusters nature must hold her breath in barrenness There are great artistic periods of course but they arrive when the creative impulse in the few meets a sympathetic impulse in the many when all things conspire to bring the artists together into emulative clusters and make them freely expressive and productive The great artistic periods come when the creatively imaginative mind finds all conditions urging him compelling him indeed to produce temples songs tales murals carvings of men and gods rather than politics and war or even mathematics and philosophy geography natural history and the rest  The artist can not be born to order nor ordered after he is born Yet it is paradoxically true that only by the will of the people his contemporaries and neighbors can he come into his own  When will the sons of John Adams will it  H M   REVIEWS  GERARD HOPKINS  Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins now first published  Edited with notes by Robert Bridges Poet Laureate  Humphrey Milford London  When the author s preface and the editor s notes are eliminated we have here but a small volume of some eighty five pages of poetry and of these only a scant sixty three consist of complete poems the rest being fragments assembled from manuscripts in the Poet Laureate s possession The majority of them date from the years 1876 to 1889 only three earlier poems are included Hopkins is long in coming into his own but it is not too much to say that his own will be secure among the few that know if not among the crowd when many a Georgian name that completely overshadows him for the moment shall have become food for the curious  For Hopkins poetry is of the most precious His voice is easily one of the half dozen most individual voices in the whole course of English nineteenth century poetry One may be repelled by his mannerisms but he cannot be denied that overwhelming authenticity that almost terrible immediacy of utterance that distinguishes the genius from the man of talent I would compare him to  D H Lawrence but for his far greater sensitiveness to the music of words to the rhythms and ever changing speeds of syllables In a note published in POETRY in 1914   Gerard Hopkins  Joyce Kilmer speaks of his mysticism and of his gloriously original imagery This mysticism of the Jesuit poet is not a poetic manner it is the very breath of his soul Hopkins simply could not help comparing the Holy Virgin to the air we breathe he was magnificently in earnest about the Holy Ghost that  over the bent World broods with warm breast and with ah bright wings  As for imagery there is hardly a line in these eighty odd pages that does not glow with some strange new flower divinely picked from his imagination  Undeniably this poet is difficult He strives for no innocuous Victorian smoothness I have referred to his mannerisms which are numerous and not always readily assimilable They have an obsessive turbulent quality about them these repeated and trebly repeated words the poignantly or rapturously interrupting oh s and ah s the headlong omission of articles and relatives the sometimes violent word order the strange yet how often so lovely compounds the plays on words and most of all his wild joy in the sheer sound of words This phonetic passion of Hopkins rushes him into a perfect maze of rhymes half rhymes assonances alliterations  Tatter tassel tangled and dingle a dangled Dandy hung dainty head  These clangs are not like the nicely calculated jingling lovelinesses of Poe or Swinburne They no less than the impatient ruggednesses of his diction are the foam   flakes and eddies of a passionate swift streaming expression To a certain extent Hopkins undoubtedly loved difficulty even obscurity for its own sake He may have found in it a symbolic reflection of the tumult that raged in his soul Yet we must beware of exaggerating the external difficulties they yield with unexpected ease to the modicum of good will that Hopkins has a right to expect of us  Hopkins prosody concerning which he has something to say in his preface is worthy of careful study In his most distinctive pieces he abandons the running verse of traditional English poetry and substitutes for it his own sprung rhythms This new verse of his is not based on the smooth flow of regularly recurring stresses The stresses are carefully grouped into line and stanza patterns but the movement of the verse is wholly free The iambic or trochaic foot yields at any moment to a spondee or a dactyl or a foot of one stressed and three or more unstressed syllables There is however no blind groping in this irregular movement It is nicely adjusted to the constantly shifting speed of the verse Hopkins effects with a few exceptions are in the highest degree successful Read with the ear never with the eye his verse flows with an entirely new vigor and lightness while the stanzaic form gives it a powerful compactness and drive It is doubtful if the freest verse of our day is more sensitive in its rhythmic pulsations than the sprung verse of Hopkins How unexpectedly he has   Gerard Hopkins  enlarged the possibilities of the sonnet his favorite form will be obvious from the two examples that I am going to quote Meanwhile here are two specimens of his more smoothly flowing verse The first is from The Leaden Echo a maiden s song  How to keep is there any any is there none such nowhere known some bow or brooch or braid or brace lace latch or catch or key to keep  Back beauty keep it beauty beauty beauty from vanishing away Oh is there no frowning of these wrinkles ranked wrinkles deep Down no waving off of these most mournful messengers still messen  gers sad and stealing messengers of grey No there s none there s none oh no there s none Nor can you long be what you now are called fair Do what you may do what do what you may And wisdom is early to despair Be beginning since no nothing can be done To keep at bay Age and age s evils hoar hair Ruck and wrinkle drooping dying death s worst winding sheets tombs  and worms and tumbling to decay So be beginning be beginning to despair Oh there s none no no no there s none Be beginning to despair to despair Despair despair despair despair  This is as free as it can be with its irregular line lengths and its extreme changes of tempo yet at no point is there hesitation as the curve of the poem rounds out to definite form For long breathed impetuous rhythms wind like and sea like such verse as this of Hopkins has nothing to learn from the best of Carl Sandburg My second quotation is from The Wood lark a precious fragment   Teevo cheevo cheevio chce Oh where where can that be Weedio weedio there again So tiny a trickle of song strain And all round not to be found For brier bough furrow or green ground Before or behind or far or at hand Either left either right Anywhere in the sunlight Well after all Ah but hark I am the little wood lark  This is sheer music The stresses fall into place with an altogether lovely freshness  Yet neither mannerisms of diction and style nor prosody define the essential Hopkins The real Hopkins is a passionate soul unendingly in conflict The consuming mysticism the intense religious faith are unreconciled with a basic sensuality that leaves the poet no peace He is longing to give up the loveliness of the world for that greater loveliness of the spirit that all but descends to envelop him like a mother but he is too poignantly aware of all sensuous beauty too insistently haunted by the allurements of the flesh A Freudian psychologist might call him an imperfectly sex sublimated mystic Girlish tenderness is masked by ruggedness And his fuming self torment is exteriorized by a diction that strains and by a rhythmic flow that leaps or runs or stamps but never walks  Here is The Starlight Night one of his most characteristic sonnets white heat mysticism forged out of what pathos of sense ecstasy   Gerard Hopkins  Look at the stars look look up at the skies Oh look at all the fire folk sitting in the air The bright boroughs the circle citadels there Down in dim woods the diamond delves the elves eyes The grey lawns cold where gold where quickgold lies Wind heat whitebeam airy abeles set on a flare Flake doves sent floating forth at a farmyard scare Ah well it is all a purchase all is a prize  Buy then bid then What Prayer patience alms vows Look look a May mess like on orchard boughs Look March bloom like on mealed with yellow sallows These are indeed the barn within doors house The shocks This piece bright paling shuts the spouse Christ home Christ and his mother and all his hallows  Ah well it is all a purchase You cannot have it for the asking And finally this other sonnet addressed to his own restless soul with this tormented mind tormenting yet  My own heart let me have more pity on let Me live to my sad self hereafter kind Charitable not live this tormented mind With this tormented mind tormenting yet I cast for comfort I can no more get By groping round my comfortless than blind Eyes in their dark can day or thirst can find Thirst s all in all in all a world of wet  Soul self come poor Jackself I do advise You jaded let be call off thoughts awhile Elsewhere leave comfort root room let joy size At God knows when to God knows what whose smile s not wrung see you unforeseen times rather as skies Betweenpie mountains lights a lovely mile  But how many lovely miles could there have been   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  on the long rocky road traversed by this unhappy spirit  In face of this agonising poem one can only marvel at the Poet Laureate s imperturbable exegesis of the word betweenpie This word might have delighted William Barnes if the verb to pie existed It seems not to exist and to be forbidden by homophonic absurdities From our best friends deliver us O Lord  Edward Sapir  UNITY MADE VITAL  New Poems by D H Lawrence B W Huebsch  The unimaginative person divides life art science anything he is dealing with He analyzes it classifies it puts it into compartments The poet on the other hand is not interested in divisions so much as in unity because unity is the aspect under which life presents itself naturally to any unbound creative spirit  Probably there is no living poet whose perception of the unity of all things is keener and more profound than  D H Lawrence He goes further than Wordsworth and the romantic school He goes further than the symbolists His books give not only new pleasure but more than this new light to the understanding  Saturated with Pauline theology as all of us who have studied English literature at all are bound to be we are prone to draw distinctions between body and spirit or even between mind and spirit and to set one up as above the others The lesser poet may as well accept the   Unity Made Vital  distinctions an artist like Mr Lawrence abandons these He sees all experiences fused into the indissoluble whole which is life  Nay I persist and very faith shall keep You integral to me Each door each mystic port Of egress from you I will seal and steep In perfect chrism  So you shall feel Ensheathed invulnerable with me with seven Great seals upon your outgoing and woven Chain of my mystic will wrapped perfectly Upon you wrapped in indomitable me  The utter unity of art is brilliantly revealed in such a poem as Flapper which cannot fail to suggest architectural method in its structure and in its keeping of all ornament in inherent harmony with the line of structure  Love has crept out of her sealed heart As a field bee black and amber Breaks from the winter cell to clamber  Up the warm grass where the sunbeams start  Mischief has come in her dawning eyes And a glint of colored iris brings Such as lies along the folded wings  Of the bee before he flies  Who with a ruffling careful breath Has opened the wings of the wild young sprite Has fluttered her spirit to stumbling flight  In her eyes as a young bee stumbleth  Love makes the burden of her voice The hum of his heavy staggering wings Sets quivering with wisdom the common things  That she says and her words rejoice   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The ten page preface to Mr Lawrence s present volume is another witness to unity a unity perhaps more far reaching more comprehensive more marvelous than has been suggested by the previous examples In this preface the author points out that there are two types of poetry that it is either the voice of the far future exquisite and ethereal or the voice of the past rich magnificent Both types possess an exquisite finality perfection which belongs to all that is far off  The poet then turns to the unrestful ungraspable poetry of the sheer present poetry whose very permanency lies in its wind like transit As the best example of this he points to Whitman Free verse he says is the norm of this seething poetry of the incarnate Now which is supreme beyond even the everlasting gems of the before and after  In his discussion Mr Lawrence uses with great effectiveness biologic and physical examples Science and art may be popularly regarded as enemies Mr Lawrence does not attack science he puts science into his pocket and walks off with it a distinct achievement in the direction of unity  So much has been written about Lawrence intelligent readers know his work so well that detailed discussion of his poems seems hardly in place His New Poems has much the same qualities as his earlier volumes of poems There is the same passion filled deep running ardor the same exactness of phrasing the same fulness of conno   Unity Made Vital  tation the same subtle rhythms Places are much more extensively used as subject matter than in his previous books The volume has not the emotional completeness of Look We Have Come Through but that is due to the plan of organic development followed in that work  Nelson Antrim Crawford  YOUTH AND THE DESERT  The Bitterns by Glenway Wescott Monroe Wheeler Evanston Ill The Immobile Wind by Yvor Winters Monroe Wheeler  These brief first books of two friends may naturally be reviewed together since they are the product of sympathetic though quite different minds and temperaments working in the same tradition the ultra modern tradition of Ezra Pound H D perhaps Carlos Williams and one or two others and above all Wallace Stevens The two young poets are both seekers of austere beauty in her remote cool haunts and their Pegasus is reined in by a taut technique which gives him order and direction but possibly too little freedom of movement  Youth is so prone to prolixities and sentimentalities that the opposite excess is something of a relief at any rate it may prove good discipline for young poets keenly strung and not less sensitive because they abhor facility The temptations inherent in this compression are obvious self consciousness and what one might call a mannerism of tightness In both these books one feels this strain   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  one wishes that each poet would be less reluctant to speak out to let himself go to reveal his meaning with a less mystical air  Mr Winters poem The Priesthood suggests the kind of austere beauty both these poets are aiming at  We stand apart That men may see The lines about our eyes  We perish we Who die in art With that surprise  Of one who speaks To us and knows Wherein he lies  And Mr Wescott veiling a similar theme says in his initial poem After image  Oh I have never sought This image of remembered fear Which clings to the eye of thought  I have desired rather to create A balance of beauty as direct As the hills above the cruel farms Or the two eyes of a fawn  In ecstasy to separate Wheat of memory from rust But trees by night lift heavy arms Or a hawk screams at dawn  And my sight turns gray as dust  Residence of a year or two in New Mexico has confirmed this austerity by adding its own stark discipline   Youth and the Desert  of deserts mountain spaces and the art of primitive races These poets may be cryptic secretive but they can not rival the desert in either of these qualities nor yet in a certain harshness streaked with color Mr Winters book has the feel of the desert in its title The Immobile Wind which no one who has been in those still spaces can question as paradoxical This poet has experienced their gift of solitude he is  I one who never speaks  Again  On the desert between pale mountains our cries Far whispers creeping through an ancient shell  Indeed the whole book is a voice from the desert the expression of a spirit in intimate communion with it a spirit proud and separate who can say  I paved a sky With days I crept beyond the Lie  The reader may be left to his own interpretation of the more cryptic poems including the Two Dramatic Interludes for Puppets But even one who lives in the greatest of our valleys can hardly fail to get from this one with its beautiful last line a hint of desert grandeur and silence  Death goes before me on his hands and knees And we go down among the bending trees  Weeping I go and no man gives me ease I am that strange thing that each strange eye sees   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Eyes of the silence and all life an eye  Turn in the wind and always I walk by Too still I go and all things go from me As down far autumn beaches a man runs to the sea  My hands are cold my lips are thin and dumb Stillness is like the beating of a drum  Mr Wescott s experience of the desert is less intimate  and static He has followed the trail for him the desert moves The sun slides down I have not healed My lame leprous day I am not swift enough to walk From May to May Desert flows beneath my feet Drips out of the sky But I lie down beside content For victory is imminent  Night opens her deep eye  Indeed the desert does not pervade this brochure of twelve poems There is a hint of softer places and more personal emotions Mostly however it expresses youth s loneliness perhaps the following poem is typical in both mood and movement  These are the subtle rhythms rhythms of sloth  Mountains which fall in the green swirls Of twilight as petals fallen and languid Bud in the dawn and fall again In the green swirls of twilight a little Nearer the stars and the flickering final fires  These are the rhythms of sloth Mountains my feet on the trails   Youth and the Desert  Enough has been quoted from these two poets to show with what studious insistence they work out their closely packed thoughts in rhythms of original and delicate beauty If the effect is sometimes too tight too squeezed this may be the ardor of youth which will yield its overemphasis to time Meantime these poets have struck out each one a new and personal tune As Mr Wescott sings  I in my pitiful flesh Transfigured have woven Music of wilderness  H M  TWO ENGLISH POETS  The Waggoner by Edmund Blunden Alfred A Knopf The Kaleidoscope by Sherard Vines C W Daniel Ltd  London  If these two English poets were dancing I am sure one would do the foxtrot and the other the waltz And I do not imply any lack of deference in using this analogy of another art  Mr Sherard Vines the foxtrotter would be playfully pagan with shoulders and feet and Mr Edmund Blunden the waltzer would glide smoothly and turn slowly both with propriety And just as the waltz is a more finished dance than the foxtrot so Mr Blunden s poetry is more polished than that of Mr Vines  I would recommend The Waggoner to all those who prefer the 1 2 3 1 2 3 order of things The poems are suave smooth and have music They are very pleas   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ing to the senses and leave the emotions unruffled They are filled with soft alliterations and the simple panaceas of wood fairies and trysts and lilied lakes as well as more original ones  The wild rose bush lets loll Her sweet breathed petals on the pearl smooth pool The bream pool overshadowed with the cool Of oaks where myriad mumbling wings patrol  Frequently there are lines of arresting beauty The feather footed moments tiptoe past  Some bell like evening when the may s in bloom  And always Mr Blunden is a sincere follower of the old English pastoral tradition He has the same genuine appreciation and authentic knowledge of nature which inspired Wordsworth George Crabbe John Clare and the eighteenth century poets of rural life Sheepbells is characteristic  Moon sweet the summer evening steals Upon the babbling day Mournfully most mournfully Light dies away  There the yew the solitary Vaults a deeper melancholy As from distant dells Chance music wells From the browsing bells  Thus they dingle thus they chime  While the woodlark s dimpling rings In the dim air climb In the dim and dewy loneness  Where the woodlark sings   Two English Poets  Some of the poems are as coolly refreshing as their titles The Silver Bird of Herndyke Mill A Waterpiece Perch fishing etc and all of them have a quiet charm They tell of nature in her most gentle moods  The range of Mr Blunden s poetry is limited but it is highly perfected  Mr Vines on the other hand springs fearlessly from one subject to another starting with Sunrise and going with breathless versatility to The Gospel of Chimneys to A Ballad of Judas to Low Tide to The Dying Bolsh and so on concluding with Anastasis He uses the direct appeal of human emotions and hurls his observations on love hatred and despair with a brutal frankness  The cold The ghastly cold All colorless The only color is My blood like red wax from a guttering candle You know these red candles ladies use In piano brackets  Bitter wind A draught blowing so shrilly through my wound Blowing the life out blowing the life out  There are no sensuous cadences here as in Mr Blunden s poems there is no beauty of wording the effect is gained through a harsh simplicity and the subject matter is always more unusual than the manner of expression The poems are to use the simile again like the foxtrot the modern dance the dance that is primitive virile whimsical pagan The veneer of rhythm is strangely a part of and at the same time incongruous to the un   conventional audacity of the ideas like the harmony of discords in modern music Perhaps Little Mother of Sorrows is as good an example as any one poem may be  Little mother of sorrows What is her desire Pence to buy a drop of milk And a few coals for a fire  My baby gets no milk from me He s crying out for food I don t know who his daddy is But one that was no good  Yes sir I used to walk the streets Before I got so ill And now I sell spring flowers or beg Since there s two mouths to fill  Little mother of sorrows With holes in your thin shoes And little son of sorrows With bare pink toes  No one in the whole town Cares for you at all So go into the workhouse  Or drown in the canal  The two poets like the two dances have found a dissimilar yet each a merited recognition  Marion Strobel   CORRESPONDENCE  CONCERNING AWARDS  My Dear Miss Monroe Your comment on The Dial s generous offer of prizes and your suggestion repeatedly made that poetry should

awarded to the two students as you suggest for a couple of nice little academic bas reliefs but rather on the basis of these and all their school work during the past year plus their personal qualities and the prizes are for definite study abroad In these particular cases they were undoubtedly the culmination of three or four years of ardent work  There is so far as I know no school for poetry excepting as your magazine and perhaps to a less extent some others afford an intelligent and discriminating outlet and opportunity to the young poets  Could you devise and suggest some plan by which prizes would not be awarded for an individual poem but based on broader considerations of personal production and talent youth and need An outline for such   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  a prize might be worth publishing in POETRY on the chance of its attracting the generous sympathy of some well to do reader In the meantime let me repeat that POETRY is itself the best school and reward so far as I know which exists at the present time for young poets  Arthur T Aldis  Note by the Editor One of POETRY S annual prizes conforms to our correspondent s suggestion that of 100 for a young poet awarded last year and twice previously This is not given for an individual poem but is based on broader considerations of personal production and talent youth and need But we submit that there is a vast difference between this annual hundred dollars not yet secured for this year by the way and those two far richer memorial prizes permanently endowed for the benefit of the Chicago Art Institute art school  If anyone feels inclined to endow such a memorial prize in perpetuity for the benefit of young poets the editor will engage to satisfy him as to the terms of such an endowment Some trust company of proved reliability should be made custodian of such a fund and a committee of prominent poets should administer it The editor will be very glad of suggestions as to the best way of appointing and perpetuating such a committee in order to keep it freshly authoritative and uninstitution alized  Those who are interested and poets especially should be loyally interested are requested to give this subject careful thought and to send in their suggestions before September fifteenth so that we may resume the subject editorially in our annual Prize award Number in November  NOTES  Paul Fort has been crowned Prince des Poetes in Paris and has recently published through Eugene Fasquelle his twenty seventh volume of verse Au Pays des Moulins Yet though perhaps the most popular and prolific of French poets he was little known in this country if one may judge by slightness of sales and library circulation until Amy   Notes  Lowell introduced him in her Six French Poets to which volume the reader is referred for an intelligent presentation of the man and his art The Miraculous Catch is partly quoted by Miss Lowell and admirably translated into prose But as she does not attempt to reproduce M Fort s rhyme scheme with its chiming repetitions of sound not unlike her own polyphonic prose we present Mr Newberry s version in the hope that our readers will be interested to compare the two translations of a poem so deliciously and whimsically French in its mood and style its manner of achieving a modern picture of a mediaeval scene  M Fort s series of Louis Eleventh poems of which we present two have been incorporated recently in a play which is to be produced at the Odeon in October This autumn Mr John Strong Newberry will publish through Duffield amp Co his book of translations under the title  Selected Poems and Ballads of Paul Fort  M Fort was born at Rheims in 1872 directly opposite the Cathedral now la Cathédrale assassinée as he has called it since its destruction For years he has lived in Paris Miss Lowell speaks of his joie de vivre I know no one she says except Sam Weller who seems to me so bubblingly alive  M Fort s translator Mr John Strong Newberry is a resident of Cleveland Ohio  Rainer Maria Rilke the distinguished Viennese poet from whom we present a translation was discussed by Padraic Colum in POETRY for June 1919 in a review of a volume of the Lemont translations A mystic poet Mr Colum calls him one lonely amid the crowd  Mrs Jessie Lemont Transil Rilke s very competent translator is a resident of New York  Of the

read POETRY  The New York Sunday Tribune of Jan 9th 1921 said editorially in quoting seven poems from our January number  The varied interest and beauty presented are typical of POETRY S quality Thanks to a rare coincidence of poise and generous imagination of sense and sensitiveness it ranks as easily the best vehicle of poetry in the English language  In the London Times of Nov 25th 1920 we read  We need not linger over the many English and French contributors to this periodical We do have to note that it has published as it honestly claims much of the best experimental poetry written by Americans in the past eight years They have succeeded in their primary design to create a poetry which should be American in thought feeling subject and form That is after all a distinct achievement  The Chicago Evening Post in commenting on POETRY S eighth birthday said  No editorship is infallible but it is rather interesting and enlightening to look over the old numbers of POETRY and to realize that the first important chance for publication in America was given to many poets almost unknown who have since obtained fame We wonder how many more may yet be helped POETRY is so far as we know unique in the length of its life recognized position and rigorously artistic standard  POETRY 543 Cass Street Chicago Enclosed find 3 00 Canada 3 15 foreign 3 25 for one year s subscription to POETRY
