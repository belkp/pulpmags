VOL IVMAY 1917 NOI Editorial Ezra Pound I HAVEaccepted the post of Foreign Editor of The Little Reviewchiefly becauseII wished a place where the current prose writings of James JoyceWyndham LewisTSEliotand myself might appear regularlypromptlyand togetherrather than irregularlysporadicallyand after useless delaysMy connection with The Little Review does not imply a severance of my relations with Poetry for which I still remain Foreign Correspondentand in which my poems will continue to appear until its guarantors revoltI would sayhoweverin justification both of Poetry and myselfthat Poetry has never beenthe instrumentof myradicalism I respect Miss Monroe for all that she has done for the support of American poetrybut in the conduct of her magazine my voice and vote have always been the vote and voice of a minorityI recognize that shebeingon the ground may be much better fitted to understand the exigencies of magazine publishing in Americabut Poetry has done numerous things to which I could never have given my personal sanctionand which could not have occurred in any magazine which had constituted itself myinstrument Poetry has shown an unflagging courtesy to a lot of old fools and fogies whom I should have told to go to hell tout pleinement and bonnementIt has refrained from attacking a number of public nuisancesfrom implying that the personal charm of the late MrGilder need not have been4 The Little Review of necessitythe sign manifest of a tremendous intellectfrom heaping upon the high school critics of America the contempt which they deserveThere would have been a little of this contempt to spare for that elder generation of American magazinesfounded by mediocrities with good intentionscontinued by mediocrities without any intentionsand nownourishingunder the command and empery of the relictsprivate secretaries and ex typists of the second regimeHad Poetry been in any sense myinstrumentI should years ago have pointed out certain defects of the elder American writersHad Poetry been my instrument I should never have permitted the deletion of certain fine English words from poems where they rang well and soundlyNeither would I have felt it necessary tacitly to comply with the superstition that the Christian Religion is indispensableor that it has always existedor that its existence is ubiquitousor irrevocable and eternalI don t mind the Christian Religionbut I can not blind myself to the fact that Confucius was extremely intelligentOrganized religions have nearly always done more harm than goodand they have always constituted a dangerAt any raterespect to one or another of them has nothing to do with good lettersIf any humjan activity is sacred it is the formulation of thought in clear speech for the use of humanityany falsification or evasion is evilThe codes of propriety are all localparochialtransienta consideration of themother than as subject matterhas no place in the artsI can say these things quite distinctly and without in the least detracting from my praise of the spirited manner in which Miss Monroe has conducted her paperShe is faced with the practical problem of circulating a magazine in a certain peculiar milieuwhich thing being so I have nothing but praise for the way she has done itBut that magazine does not express my convictionsAttacks on itgrounded in such beliefand under The Little Review 5 taken in the magnanimous hope of depriving me of part of my sustenancecan not be expected to have more than a temporary success and that among ill informed peopleBlastfounded chiefly in the interest of the visual artsis of necessity suspendedWith Gaudier Brzeska dead on the field of battlewith MrWilliam RobertsMrWadsworthMrEtchellsand MrWyndham Lewisall occupied in various branches of the servicethere is no new vorticist painting to write aboutSuch manuscript as MrLewis has left with meand such things as he is able to write in the brief leisure allowed an artillery officerwill appear in these pagesIt is quite impossible that Blast should again appear until MrLewis is free to give his full energy to itIn so far as it is possibleI should like The Little Review to aid and abet The Egoist in its workI do not think it can be too often pointed out that during the last four years The Egoist has published seriallyin the face of no inconsiderable difficultiesthe only translation of Remy de Gourmont s Chevaux de Diomedesthe best translation of Le Comte de GabalisMrJoyce s masterpiece A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Manand is now publishing MrLewis s novel TarrEven if they had published nothing else there would be no other current periodical which could challenge this recordbut The Egoist has not stopped therethey have in a most spirited manner carried out the publication in book form of the Portrait of the Artistand are in the act of publishing MrEliot s poemsunder the title MrPrufrock and ObservationsI see no reason for concealing my belief that the two novelsby Joyce and Lewisand MrEliot s poems are not only the most important contributions to English literature of the past three yearsbut that they are practically the only works of the time in which the creative element is presentwhich in any way show inventionor a progress beyond precedent workThe mass of our contemporariesto say nothing of our debilitated eldershave gone on repeating themselves and each other6 The Little Review IISecondlythere are certain prevalent ideas to which I can not subscribeI can not believe that the mere height of the Rocky Mountains will produce lofty poetrywe have had little from Chimborazothe Alps or the AndesI can not believe that the mere geographical expanse of America will produce of itself excellent writingThe desert of Sahara is almost equally vastNeither can I look forward with longing to a time when each village shall rejoice in a bad local poetaster making bad verse in the humdrum habitual way that the local architect puts up bad buildingsThe arts are not the mediocre habit of mankindThere is no common denominator between the little that is good and the waste that is dullmediocreIt may be pleasing to know that a cook is president of the local poetry society in Perigordthere is no reason why a cook should not write as well as a plowmanbut the combination of several activities is really irrelevantThe fact remains that no good poetry has come out of Perigord since the Albigensian crusadeanno domini twelve hundred and nineThere being a local poetry society has not helped to prevent thisThe shell fish grows its own shellthe genius creates its own milieuYouthe publiccan kill genius by actual physical starvationyou may perhaps thwart or distort itbut you can in no way create itBecause of this simple fact the patron is absolutely at the mercy of the artistand the artist at the cost of some discomfort personaltransient discomfort is almost wholly free of the patronwhether this latter be an individualor the hydra headed detestable vulgusThere is no misanthropy in a thorough contempt for the mobThere is no respect for mankind save in respect for detached individuals The Little Review Eeldrop and Appleplex TSEliot IEELDROP and Appleplex rented two small rooms in a disreputable part of townHere they sometimes came at nightfallhere they sometimes sleptand after they had sleptthey cooked oatmeal and departed in the morning for destinations unknown to each otherThey sometimes sleptmore often they talkedor looked out of the windowThey had chosen the rooms and the neighborhood with great careThere are evil neighborhoods of noise and evil neighbor hoods of silenceand Eeldrop and Appleplex preferred the latteras being the more evilIt was a shady streetits windows were heavily curtainedand over it hung the cloud of a respectability which has something to concealYet it had the advantage of more riotous neighborhoods near byand Eeldrop and Appleplex commanded from their windows the entrance of a police station across the wayThis alone possessed an irresistible appeal in their eyesFrom time to time the silence of the street was brokenwhenever a malefactor was apprehendeda wave of excitement curled into the street and broke upon the doors of the police stationThen the inhabitants of the street would linger in dressing gownsupon their doorstepsthen alien visitors would linger in the streetin capslong after the centre of misery had been engulphed in his cellThen Eeldrop and Appleplex would break off their discourseand rush out to mingle with the mobEach pursued his own line of enquiryAppleplexwho had the gift of an extraordinary address with the lower classes of both sexesquestioned the onlookersandusually extracted full and inconsistent historiesEeldrop preserved a more passive demeanorlistened to the conversation of the people among themselvesregistered in his mind their oathstheir redundance of phrasetheir various manners of spittingand thecries of the victim from the hall of justice The Little Review withinWhen the crowd dispersedEeldrop and Appleplex returned to their roomsAppleplex entered the results of his inquiries into large note booksfiled according to the nature of the casefrom Aadulteryto Yyeggmen Eeldrop smoked reflectively It may be added that Eeldrop was a scepticwith a taste for mysticismand Appleplex a materialist with a leaning toward scepticismthat Eeldrop was learned in theologyand that Appleplex studied the physical and biological sciences There was a common motive which led Eeldrop and Appleplex thus to separate themselves from time to timefrom the fields of their daily employments and their ordinarily social activitiesBoth were endeavoring to escape not the common placerespectable or even the domesticbut the too well pigeon holedtoo taken for grantedtoo highly systematized areasand in the language of those whom they sought to avoid they wishedto apprehend the human soul in its concrete individualityWhy said Eeldrop was that fat Spaniardwho sat at the table with us this eveningand listened to our conversation with occasional curiositywhy was he himself for a moment an object of interest to usHe wore his napkin tucked into his chinhe made unpleasant noises while eatingand while noteatinghis way of crumbling bread between fat fingers made me extremely nervoushe wore a waistcoat cafe au laitand black boots with brown topsHe was oppressively gross and vulgarhe belonged to a typehe could easily be classified in any town of provincial SpainYet under the circumstanceswhen we had been discussing marriageand he suddenly leaned forward and exclaimed I was married once myself we were able to detach him from his classification and regard him for a moment as an unique beinga soulhowever insignificantwith a history of its ownonce for allIt is these moments which we prizeand which alone are revealingFor any vital truth is incapable of being applied to another casethe essence The Little Review 9 is uniquePerhaps that is why it is so neglectedbecause it is uselessWhat we learned about that Spaniard is incapable of being applied to any other Spaniardor even recalled in wordsWith the decline of orthodox theology and its admirable theory of the soulthe unique importance of events has vanishedA man is only important as he is classedHence there is no tragedyor no appreciation of tragedywhich is the same thingWe had been talking of young Bistwickwho three months ago married his mother s housemaid and now is aware of the factWho appreciates the truth of the matterNot the relativesfor they are only moved by affectionby regard for Bistwick s interestsand chiefly by their collective feeling of family disgraceNot the generous minded and thoughtful outsiderwho regards it merely as evidence for the necessity of divorce law reformBistwick is classed among the unhappily marriedBut what Bistwick feels when he wakes up in the morningwhich is the great important factno detached outsider conceivesThe awful importance of the ruin of a life is overlookedMen are only allowed to be happy or miserable in classesIn Gopsum Street a man murders his mistressThe important fact is that for the man the act is eternaland that for the brief space he has to livehe is already deadHe is already in a different world from oursHe has crossed the frontierThe important fact that something is done which can not be undone a possibility which none of us realize until we face it ourselvesFor the man s neighbors the important fact is what the man killed her withAnd at precisely what timeAnd who found the bodyFor theenlightened publicthe case is merely evidence for the Drink questionor Unemploymentor some other category of things to be reformedBut the mediaeval worldinsisting on the eternity of punishmentexpressedsomething nearer the truth What you say replied Appleplex commands my measured adherenceI should thinkin the case of the Spaniardand in the many other interesting cases which have come under 10 The Little Review our attention at the door of the police stationwhat we grasp in that moment of pure observation on which we pride ourselvesis not alien to the principle of classificationbut deeperWe could if we likedmake excellent comment upon the nature of provincial Spaniardsor of destitutionas misery is called by the philanthropists or on homes for working girlsBut such is not our intentionWe aim at experience in the particular centres in which alone it is evilWe avoid classificationWe do not deny itBut when a man is classified something is lostThe majority of mankind live on paper currencythey use terms which are merely good for so much realitythey never see actual coinageI should go even further than that said Eeldrop The majority not only have no language to express anything save generalized manthey are for the most part unaware of themselves as anything but generalized menThey are first of all government officialsor pillars of the churchor trade unionistsor poetsor unemployedthis cataloguing is not only satisfacory to other people for practical purposesit is sufficient to themselves for theirlife of the spirit Many are not quite real at any momentWhen Wolstrip marriedI am sure he said to himself Now I am consummating the union of two of the best families in PhiladelphiaThe question is said Appleplex what is to be our philosophyThis must be settled at onceMrsHowexden recommends me to read BergsonHe writes very entertainingly on the structure of the eye of the frogNot at all interrupted his friend Our philosophy is quite irrelevantThe essential isthat our philosophy should spring from our point of view and not return upon itself to explain our point of viewA philosophy about intuition is somewhat less likely to be intuitive than any otherWe must avoid having a platformBut at least said Appleplex we are IndividualistsNo nor anti intellectualistsThese also The Little Review 11 are labelsTheindividualistis a member of a mob as fully as any other manand the mob of individualists is the most unpleasingbecause it has the least characterNietzsche was a mob manjust as Bergson is an intellectualistWe cannot escape the labelbut let it be one which carries no distinctionand arouses no self consciousnessSufficient that we should find simple labelsand not further exploit themI amI confess to youin private lifea bank clerkAnd shouldaccording to your own viewhave a wifethree childrenand a vegetable garden in a suburb said Appleplex Such is precisely the case

the god of this universe and he meditated the law of the ShastrasHe was a man of moderate income inherited for the most part from his fathersof whom there were sevevralslightly augmented by his own rather desultory operations of commerceThe Little Review 13 He had never made money by conquest and was inclined to regard this method of acquisition as antiquatedas belonging rather to the days of his favorite author than to our ownHe had followed the advice of the Sutrashad become the head of an house in the not unprosperous city of Migdalbin a quarter where dwelt a reasonable proportion of fairly honest and honourable people not unaverse to gossip and visitsHis house was situated by a watercoursein lieu of new fangled plumbingand in this his custom was at one with that of the earliest CeltsIt was divided in various chambers for various occupationssurrounded by a commodious gardenand possessed of the two chief chamberstheexteriorand theinterior butt and ben The interior was the place for his womenthe exterior enhanced with rich perfumescontained a bedsoftlusciousand agreeable to the action of visioncovered with a cloth of unrivalled whitenessIt was a little humped in the middleand surmounted with garlands and bundles of flowerswhich were sometimes renewed in the morningUpon it were also a coverlet brightly embroidered and two cylindrical pillowsone at the head and the other placed at the footThere was also a sort of sofa or bed for reposeat the head of which stood a case for unguentsand perfumes to be used during the nightand a stand for flowers and pots of cosmetic and other odoriferous substancesessences for perfuming the breathnew cut slices of lemon peel and such things as were fittingOn the floor near the sofa rested a metal spittoonand a toilet caseand above it was a luth suspended from an elephant s tuskuncut but banded with silverThere was also a drawing tablea bowl of perfumea few booksand a garland of amaranthsFurther off was a sort of round chair or taboureta chest containing a chess boardand a low table for dicingIn the outer apartment were cages for Jodindranath s birdsHe had a great many too manyThere were separate small rooms for spinningand one for carving in wood and such like dilettantismesIn the garden was a sort of merry The Little Review go round of good ropelooking more or less like a May poleThere was likewise a common see saw or teetera green housea sort of rock gardenand two not too comfortable benches2Jodindranath rose in the morning and brushed his teethafter having performed other unavoidable duties as prescribed in the sutraand he applied to his body a not excessiveas he considered itamount of unguents and perfumesHe then blackened his eyebrowsdrew faint lines under his eyesput a fair deal of rouge on his lipsand regarded himself in a mirrorThen having chewed a few betel leaves to perfume his breathand munched another bonne bouche of perfumehe set about his day s businessHe was a creature of habitThat is to sayhe batheddailyAnd upon alternate days he anointed his person with oiland on the third day he lamented that the mossy substance employed by the earliest orthodox hindoos was no longer obtainableHe had never been brought to regard soap with complaisanceHis conscience was troubledboth as to the religious and social bearing of this solidified greaseHe suspected the presence of beef suetit was at best a parvenu and Mohametan substanceEvery four days he shavedthat is to sayhe shaved his head and his visageevery five or ten days he shaved all the rest of his bodyHe meticulously removed the sweat from his arm pitsHe ate three meals dailyin the morningafternoon and at evening as is prescribed in the CharayanaImmediately after breakfast he spent some time instructing his parrots in languageHe then proceeded to cock fightsquail fights and rain fightsfrom them to the classical playsthough their representations have sadly diminishedHe slept some hours at mid dayThenas is befitting to the head of an househe had himself arrayed in his ornaments and habiliment and passed the afternoon in talk with his friends and acquaintanceThe evening was given over to singingToward the end of it Jodindranathas the head of his houseretaining only one friend The Little Review 15 in his companysat waiting in the aforementioned perfumed and well arranged chamberAs the lady with whom he was at that time connected did no arrive on the instanthe considered sending a messenger to reproach herThe atmosphere grew uneasyHis friend Mohon fidgeted slightlyThen the lady arrivedMohonhis friendrose graciously bidding her welcomespoke a few pleasant words and retiredJodinranath remainedAnd for that daythe twenty fifth of August1916this was his last occupationIn this respect the day resembled all othersThis sortof thing has gone on for thirty five hundred years and there have been no disastrous consequences3As to Jodindranath s thoughts and acts after Mohon had left himI can speak with no definite certaintyI know that my friend was deeply religiousthat he modeled his life on the Shatras and somewhat on the SutraTo the Kama Sutra he had given minute attentionHe was firmly convinced that one should not take one s pleasure with a woman who was a lunaticor leperousor too whiteor too blackor who gave forth an unpleasant odoror who lived an ascetic lifeor whose husband was a man given to wrath and possessed of inordinate powerThese points were to him a matter of grave religionHe considered that his friends should be constant and that they should assist his designsHe considered it fitting that a citizen should enter into relations with laundrymenbarberscowmenfloristsdruggistsmerchants of betel leavescab driversand with the wives of all theseHe had carefully considered the sizes and shapes and ancient categories of womento witthose which should be classified as she dogshe horseand she elephantaccording to their cubic volumeHe agreed with the classic author who recommends men to choose women about their own sizeThe doctrine that love results either from continuous habit16 The Little Review from imaginationfrom faithor from the perception of exterior objectsor from a mixture of some or all of these causesgave him no difficultyHe accepted the old authors freelyWe have left him with Lalunmokish seated upon the bed humped in the middleI can but add that he had carefully considered the definitions laid down in the Sutrakiss nominalkiss palpitantkiss contacticthe kiss of one lip and of two lipspreferring the latter the kiss transferredthe kiss showing intentionBeyond this he had studied the various methods of scratching and ticklingand the nail pressures as followssonoroushalf moon and circlepeacock clawand blue lotusHe considered that the Sutra was too vague when it described the Bengali womensaying that they have large nailsand that the southern women have small nailswhich may serve in divers manners for giving pleasure but give less grace to the handBiting he did not much approveNor was he very greatly impressed with the literary tastes of the public women in ParaliputraHe read booksbut not a great manyHe preferred conversation which did not leave the main grooveHe did not mind its being familiar For myself I can only profess the deepest respect for the women of Paraliputrawho have ever been the friends of brahmins and of students and who have greatly supported the arts 4Upon the day followingas Jodindranath was retiring for his mid day reposehis son entered the perfumed apartmentJodindra closed the book he had been readingThe boy was about twelve years of ageJodindra began to instruct himbut without indicating what remarks were his own and what derived from ancient authorityHe saidFlower of my lifelotus bud of the parent stemyou must preserve our line and keep fat our ancestral spirits lest they be found withered like batsas is said in the MahabharataAnd for this purpose you will doubtless marry a virgin of your own caste and acquire a legal posterity and a good reputationStill The Little Review 17 the usage of women is not for one purpose onlyfor what purpose is the usage of womenThe use of women answered the boy is for generation and pleasureThere is also a third use said his father yet with certain women you must not mingleWho are the prohibited women The boy answered We should not practise dalliance with the women of higher casteor with those whom another has had for his pleasureeven though they are of our own casteBut the practise of dalliance with women of lower casteand with women expelled from their own casteand with public womenand with women who have been twice married is neither commanded us nor forbiddenWith such women said Jodindranath dalliance has no object save pleasureBut there are seasons in life when one should think broadlyThere are circumstances when you should not merely parrot a text or think only as you have been told by your tutorAs in dalliance itself there is no text to be followed verbatimfor a man should trust in part to the whim of the moment and not govern himself wholly by rulesso in making your career and positionyou should think of more things than generation and pleasure You need not say merely The woman is willingorShe has been two times marriedwhat harm can there be in this business These are mere thoughts of the sensesimpractical fanciesBut you have your life before youand perchance a time will come when you may say This woman has gained the heart of a very great husbandand rules himand he is a friend of my enemyif I can gain favor with hershe will persuade him to give up my enemy My sonyou must manage your rudderAnd againif her husband have some evil design against youshe may divert himor again you may say If I gain her favor I may then make an end of her husband and we shall have all his great riches Or if you should fall into misfortune and say A liaison with this woman is in no way 18 The Little Review beset with dangershe will bring me a very large treasureof which I am greatly in need considering my pestilent poverty and my inability to make a good livingOr again This woman knows my weak pointsand if I refuse her she will blab them abroad and tarnish my reputationAnd she will set her husband against meOr again This woman s husband has violated my womenI will give him his own with good interestOr again With this woman s aid I may kill the enemy of Rajawhom I have been ordered to killand she hides himOr again The woman I love is under this female s influenceI will use one as the road to the otherOrThis woman will get me a rich wife whom I cannot get at without her Nomy Blue Lotuslife is a serious matterYou will not always have me to guide youYou must think of practical mattersUnder such circumstances you should ally yourself with such women Thus spoke Jodindrabut the council is very ancient and is mostly to be found in the SutrasThese books have been thought very holyThey contain chapters on pillules and philtresWhen Jodindranath had finished this speech he sank back upon one of the cylindrical cushionsIn a few moments his head bowed in slumberThis was the day for oilThe next day he shaved his whole bodyHis life is not unduly ruffledUpon another day Jodindranath said to his son There are certain low womenpeople of ill reputeaddicted to avariceYou should not converse with them at the street cornerslest your creditors see you His son s life was not unduly ruffledThe Little Review 19 Imaginary LettersSix Letters of William Bland

speak all words with this voiceless mouth From the Greek AnthologyAnonymousI The New DawnYou have slept longoh heartAnd youmy heart s dear comradewhom men call Beauty why have you awakened me once more and made my bed no longer roses but sharp thorns Too many are yet asleepthey have slept overlongYou must awaken now and once morein this golden dawningsing to them and to this silence round about them out of your soul s rich painout of your body s wearinessSingthensingI willdear my heartmy BeautyI willBut ohthe silencethis silence II At Evening The lamp shines low in the silent roomand the lonely poet dreams of long forgotten eveningsPutting aside the volume in my hand I caress the sumptuous fur of the cat asleep on my kneescrooning to myself the while an old old folk songWithoutstretching far away into the horizonthe fields of golden wheat sway to and fro under the moon s full lightand on the screen of the window a single moth clings motionlessits fire The Little Review 25 like eyes drinking long draughts of the light which it cannot reachOh mothwhy should you love so well the thing that seeks your death An Invocation III You who love Beauty as the bee loves the floweras the bird loves the air hailYou who lie awake at night dreaming of the Beauty that is in the world yet not of the world all hailYou whose life is like a broken song trailing through the ceaseless monotone of human things hail and farewellWe were not long togetherbut haply neither will soon forgetAlmost we understood each otherand in all the world there is no word that touches life so quickly asalmost And on that word we partedBecause you have not learned that Beauty never stops to kiss her chosen onesYou do not know that with her sweettoo sweet and awful breath alone does she condemn them to journey forever from flower to flower by dayby night from star to starEven as you journeya frailwondrous and ghostly beingpouring forth your pain mad melodiesbroken melodiesceaselessly yearning toward the verge of that perfectionahand you would have me leap into those chill profunditiesout of the worldout of your dear remembranceout of the bright sun s warmthforeverHear mepassionate stricken oneHear me this oncethen if you will forget meif yon can remember stillFor I have pondered on the rune of dreams and therein I have readThat Beauty is always in the search and in the seekerit is a wandering and not a goala wave and not the seaa flame and not the candleIt is that soul which is not mannor womannor childnor anything at all save one long shattered cry echoing down the galleries of stupendous nightIt is this cry that I now send to youvaliant and wayward onemy sister Thisand once morethis Hail and farewell IV The Lover s Lament Once in the waning of an autumn dayas I was reading to my beloved from a little book of verseI came upon the lines They are not longthe days of wine and rosesout of a misty dream But suddenly a flower like hand covered the page from my eyes and the moment of sweet gladness that was mine vanished like the saffron tints from the clouds beyondas I felt her arms steal about my body and saw her mute poppy lips craving yet another kiss yet another kissV Wanderers Dreaming one night of a triumphant journey along the Milky Waytraversing the Infinite from world to world as though on flaming cushionsI was awakened by a dull shuffling noise outside my doorI listened for a moment Ahit is only the old blind woman across the hallstumbling in the darkness on the way to her room And I went to sleep againbut my dream had gone foreverVI The AccursedInto the same river thou mayst not step twice Oh sage grim oneweaver at a sable loomHeraclitusarise from your ashes and I will show you a woman so fair that looking on her you will loveand lovingnevermore plait your sombre nets of Change Into the same river thou mayst not step twiceNot even if the river s name is LoveAnswer mespirit of desperationruthless passer bynot even LoveSilenceonly silenceand the continual hasting of waters down to the seaThe Little Review VII Ennui I am tired of dancing and songof pictures and the words that men ceaselessy utter without needAnd of my own dancing and songof my own visions and unavailing speech I am more tired stillIf so it might beI would like to have a room at the top of a towerfar above the eartha room consecrated to silencewhere only the night could enterAnd there I would sit forever by the windowreceiving the benedictions of the starsand watching in the moon s pale disc the reflections in loverseyes as they drank from one another at the sorrowful fountains of illusionVIII The Rose Jar Rose jarsoft to the finger s touchrose jar like a maiden s breastthou chance issue from the womb of Beauty what coarse mouthed potter turned thee on his wheelshaping thee from the inert clayAnd in what ancient garden bloomed the flowers now so dry within thy comely bellynow so very dry but oh so fragrant to the nostrils of the poetRose jarsoft to the finger s touchrose jar like a maiden s breast and even thou some day will lie upon the earth and all thy loveliness and all thy perfume will return again unto the clay unto the clay beneath swift brutal feetIX Vcsperal Clear eyed eveningand thoudark shadowschildren of the moonlet us dance together a little whileand sing to one another antique melodiescompounded all of passion and youth and glad forgetfulness For soon the morning will come again out of the fateful East the morning with all its sullen duties28 The Little Review Announcements
