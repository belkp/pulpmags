REVIEWVOLIll AUGUST1916 NO5 A Real Magazine MARGARET CANDERSON I AM afraid to write anythingI am ashamedI have been realizing the ridiculous tragedy of The Little ReviewIt has been published for over two years without coming near its idealThe ultimate reason for life is ArtI don t know what they mean when they talk about art for life s sakeYou don t make art so that you may liveyou do just the reverse of thatLife takes care of itselfrolls on from the first pushand then falls over the edgeArt uses up all the life it can get and remains foreverArt for Art s sake is merely the sensible statement of the most self evident fact in the worldIt has been the easy creed of charlatansbut what does that matterIt has always been the faith of the strongestWell I wanted Art in The Little Review There has been a little of itjust a very littleIt is tragicI tell youAnd RevolutionRevolution is ArtYou want free people just as you want the Venus that was modelled by the seaAll my inadequate

fretting the souls of those who feel that it is their task to save the world from itselfOf late it hasbeen Birth ControlThey have been going to prison for merely mentioning the words Birth Control in the presence of an ingenue governmentAnd all the time the government has the most perfect system of Birth Control for genius and art the National Board of Censorshipso perfect as to produce sterility A simple mind would wonder why these agitators don t first fight the censorshipand perhaps all these things would be added unto them Last winter a rumor did come out of New York that a few of these and a few artists were trying to form a plan of unorganized but concerted actioneach profession or art or group protesting to the state on its own behalfIt turned out to be another of those Spoon River thingswhen the test came a few stood by the ideabut the others were either too lily livered to have their names appear or the inevitable Puritan ancestor arose to remind them that after all they were Plymouth Rocks And all the while the tale grows finer yetJerome Bluma painter of reputationa real painterreturned from China in the spring naively bringing with himto this land of the freea little collection of Chinese and Japanese art to keep by him for the delight of his soulIn the collection was a book over one hundred and fifty years oldcontaining eight original paintings on silkby one of the greatest of Chinese paintersand a Japanese scrolltwelve feet longof even finer workmanshipMrBlum was summoned before the Collector of the Port of ChicagoThe two works described had been declared obscene by an appraiser They would arouse the passions of an ordinary man They were to be destroyedwith the possible inclusions of the entire case of old bronzestapestriesembroideriesetc in which they were shippedMrBlum had laid himself open to a fine of thousands of dollarswith something like five years imprisonmentfor good measureLaw versus ArtMrBlum offered to paint out all objectionable partsasked permission to send the things back to China or permissionThe Little Review 5 to present them to some museum Art or no Artall paintings of the kind were to be burnedwas the decree from the customs officialsAnd the twoobsceneworks of art were burned in the furnace of the Federal buildingNo need here to go into what MrBlum must have suffered as an artist over the destruction of precious beauty never to be replacedor as a man over the delicate and unobscene discussionsby the officialsof the objectionable partsover the injustice of having his property destroyed without trial before a jury of his peersAll people of any education know that the art of all ancient peoples sprung from a desire to recreate forthe hearts of men the mystery of creation and reproduction of life thence came religion to explain to the minds of men the awe and wonder of creationThe Art of the Orient is almost wholly concerned with these subjectsHere was where MrBlum s becameobsceneartIf the censors should become informed woe for the Christian churcheseach raising anobscenephallic symbolin the crossshamelessly uncensored to the skythe bishops would mourn their fish mouthed phallic hatsand so on endlesslyWho knows but if left to themselves they may not even reach themselves in their unlimited censorship and be their own destructionIt is not doubtbut certitude

strutting weak willed human beingsWe are not heldand the light within the sacred space grows dimmerWe lose all interest in places where once we have found ArtAnd how desperate we have becomeThe procession of the Imagists has been the only sacred thing before our eyes thin and fragrantTheir fragility has the sap of eternity blustering windsblowing through the gaps back stagetear at them in vainThe Imagists have grown straight and strongThe beauty of their tiny procession strikes into our very hearts the emptinessthe appalling desolationof our positionCarl Sandburg has understood the failures and the lies and exposed the causeHe has shown the lie of your government and the farce and folly of monuments to those who kill to keep it aliveHe exposes your little deaths and their perfumed sorrow and the bunk of words and antics of your Billy Sunday and fellow citizensHe has heard thefellows saying here s good stuff for a novel or it might be worked up into a good play when speaking of an Italian widow living in city slumsHe has the courage and the knack of giving them the challenge calling their bluff and he declares with strong conviction that he s able to back up his defianceWho of the scatter brains living could put her or her daughterin law or the working girls or the entire mobfor that matterinto a playBut he has put themtheir spiritinto linesgaunt and vivid as

in all Holy Russia that could test his soul in supreme activityHe lacked the moral courage that forced the sons of the fathers into revolutionThere was left mockeryand the insulting of the soul with puny wickednessvapid and provincialSo genius was poured into the mould of the commonplacePechorin sought a splendid isolationHe killed humanity in his heartbecame a creature of selfand began to hate

excitement of mere change We live out of curiosityWe expect something newHow absurdand yet how vexatiousWomen fall at his feet and he asks derisivelyCan it be that wickedness is so attractive He knows the ways of his victim by hearthe anticipates her every moveand calls her accomplishment tiresomePassion has shriveled until it is an inglorious segment of his lifeIt is a thing of curiosity rather than of sympathyLove is an annoyanceyet he persists in it I feel within me an insatiate hunger that devours everything it meets upon the wayI look upon joy and suffering only in their relation to myselfregarding them as nutriment that sustains my spiritual forces To none has my love ever brought happiness because I have never sacrificed anything for the sake of those I lovedI have only tried to satisfy the strange cravings of my heartgreedily draining their feelingstheir tendernesstheir joytheir suffering and I have never been able to sate myself It occurs to Pechorin that such aimlessness cannot but be a misinterpretation of the mystic handwriting of life It cannot be that I came purposeless into the worldA purpose there must have beenand surely mine was an exalted destiny because I feel within my soul powers immeasurableBut I was unable to discover that destinyI allowed myself to be carried away by the allurements of passions innane and ignobleFrom that crucible I issued hard and cold as ironMy chief pleasure is to make everything around me subject to my willTo be the cause of suffering or joy to another without having a definite right to be is it not the

encased in philistinism there is a symphony orchestraconducted by a radical young man who knows his businessplaying a series of modern music programs during the summer The first day I went out to inspect San Francisco I was struck dumb before a poster in a music store announcing Sunday afternoon concerts by a People s Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by NSokoloffwith Debussy sFaunand those lovely Caucasian Sketches of Ippolitow Ivanow on the programand Tina Lerner as soloistetc etcall for a price ranging between twenty five and seventy five centsI wentnaturallynot because I expected it to be a very good concertbut because I was starved for musicI knew nothing of Sokoloffexcept that he had played the violin in Chicago last winter and I had missed his concertPerhaps you can imagine the shock and the joy of hearing theFaunconducted as I at least have never heard it done beforeso that it became really a thing of cool lavender shadows in a forestIt s impossible to describebut it made you weep it was so beautifully doneSince then I have heard the story of the unique organizationSan Francisco has one orchestra under the leadership of a man who may be called a conservativeI supposeand backed by numerous wealthy citizens who have the artistic interests of the town at heart without a very definite knowledge of what channels they should followBut MrsJBCasserlya musicianconceived the idea of having better music in San Franciscoand asked MrSokoloff to undertake these concertsMrSokoloffwho was a violinist rather than a conductorwas fired by the ideaand a skating rink was hired for the first rehearsalThere was The Little Review 19some embarrassment as to who should pay the expenses of the rehearsalbut it was finally decided that if the orchestra men liked the new conductor they would assume the entire costif notit was to beonMrsCasserlyAs I rememberthey played the Tchaikovsky Pathétique that afternoon in the sacred halls of the skating rinkand when it was over the men rose to cheer the conductor Wellgentlemen said MrsCasserly who pays But there was no hesitation over that trifling matterAnd so the concerts began in a local theatreIt is perfectly simple to realize that San Francisco would not largely appreciate such a blessingand that MrsCasserly and MrSokoloff would be criticised for theirmodernprograms but it is hard to understand the action of the other orchestra peoplewho locked up their scores so that therivalmusicians couldn t use them and were forced to buy new onesThis is the typical history of all struggles in the world to find beautyso one grows used to itBut the important thing is that the People s Philharmonic is to go on next yearand their programsI should have mentioned that they play old musicwhich is good as well as new musicare exciting to think ofI listened yesterday to their rehearsal of the Tristan Prelude and I know that MrStock in Ravinia Park is not offering his audiences anything so fresh and inspired as MrSokoloff s readingMay they live long and prosper An Anarchist s Question IN the day of the Preparedness Parade in San Francisco some one threw a bomb and killed eight peoplewho undoubtedly didn t deserve to dieSince then the city has gone around on tip toeas an anarchist I know expressed itFive people who undoubtedly don t deserve it have been thrown into jail and torturedPuzzleif the object of preparedness parades is achievedeverybody will be killed off anyway why is one kind of murder so much worse than anotherThe Little Review Julia to JimAfter reading Edgar

fashion for some timeI want to ask you if there has ever been framed a model statute providing for the dissemination of such information by the StateIf such a model statute exists I will arrange to have it introduced in the Washington State Legislature when that body convenes next JanuaryIf nothing of this sort is available I would earnestly recommend that steps be taken immediately to prepare a measure which will bring about the maximum amount of good and yet at the same time have an opportunity of receiving the support of law makers elected by a semi civilized and bigoted peopleIt should be borne in mind that the Initiative and Referendum are both in effect in the State of Washingtonso that there would be a strong probability that such a proposed law would be passed upon directly by the peopleeither through the failure of the legislature to meet the issue squarely or its over cautious desire to have its action approved by the voters individuallyI believe that such an act would have a fair chance of passageWe look upon our State as not altogether unprogressivefor in addition to the legislative progress indicated by the Initiative and Referendum we enjoy woman suffrageglory in non partisan direct primariescarry but do not wave a Red Light Abatement Acttolerate Prohibition and threaten Single TaxSo you see there are hopesThe Little Review 27 What Is the State An answer to Alan Adair sWhat Is AnarchyAlice GroffPhiladelphiaIs it not time that thinking people should cease to speak of the social order asthe state The very meaning of state is staticand if there be a qualifying word that does not apply to the life of the social order static is that wordThe social order is a growingdevelopingevolving thingMan is a social as well as an individual beingHe may be called a political being by virtue of his social activitiesand the methods he uses to live best his social life but the individual man is not a political being he cannotflock in a corner all by himselfas Dundreary would say he is political only in the sense of being an element in a social egowith a social will toward the desired social end of that egoSuch social ego is continually being formed anew in the social order The dominating social ego of any stage is not necessarily the highest ideal which the most advanced and thoughtful minds in that stage can conceiveIt is the highest ideal of the largest or most powerful number of individuals that are in unanimity upon that ideal and capable of ruling the rest of the social order with it for the time beingEvery form of social dominance that has ever prevailed in the history of the world will come under this head and answer to this descriptionAnd who shall say that the prevailing and dominating social ego at any one stage is not the best possible for the social order at that stageThe individual man with a high philosophic gift and a reasoning mind may say to himselfand to othersMan is capable of a better social order than thisthere are higher and finer ideals than those that prevailbut he can do absolutely nothing of himself to do away with the prevailing social egoand to substitute a new one with better idealsas he thinksexcept to teachto agitateuntil he can induce a number of individuals to take up his ideal and to join him in a social ego that shall become powerful enough to drive out the dominating ego and substitute for it the new oneThis is all that there is to political activityThis is the whole story of social evolutionAnd no individual or social ego can possibly decide that the new ideal is better than the old until it istried out It is of course likely to have better elements than the old in so far as it is born of criticism upon the old which then was beingtried out But no dominating social ego can ever hope statically to establish itself in the social order while the world endures consequently the reasoning mind must say to itselfThe highest social ideal that I can conceive and can induce a social ego to stand for is only the next step in social evolutionwhich must give place to the next and the next Hencesuch mind can only smile indulgently upon all static ideals monarchydemocracyanarchysocialism alike realizing that the only social ideals worthy the name are those based upon demonstrated scientific truth the collected and collated set of social facts that have been found to work in accordance with natural law in past social evolutionrealizing that the personal ideal of the individual manunless based upon such factsis socially a child s soap bubblewhatever it may be in the innermost of his own soul as to the evolution of his own individuality OTHERS A Magazine of the New Verse Various writers are being invited to edit Otherseach for a
