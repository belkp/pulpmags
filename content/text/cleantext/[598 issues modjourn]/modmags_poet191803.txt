THE WILLOW NODS  A Dance play for Poem mimes  CENE A dense and dusky wood which surrounds a willow leaning over a pool Sun splotches penetrate the shadows An old figure is seated on a low stone ledge at the right of the pool He is dressed in a simple hooded robe and he speaks with a detached air like one who improvises occasionally caressing a small hidden instrument or drum with exquisite haphazard rhythms Later a girl and boy enter simply dressed in thin flowing garments of vivid color They and afterwards a second boy act the improvisation of the figure in a dance or pantomime which discloses a series of unconscious poses naive awkward uncertain shy They appear to be the physical embodiment of the thought play of the figure He is unseen by them but it is evident that they can hear him most of the time separately It is questionable whether the figure can see them A clear unity of the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  vague elements of scene and lights speech and silences poses and pantomime is observed throughout the play At the rise of the curtain the figure is alone  The Figure  Only when the willow nods Does the water nod Only when the wind nods Does the willow nod Only when a cloud nods Does the wind nod And of course nod Rhymes with God   The girl wanders in looks up at the willow approaches the water kneels  Better that you look Lovely than that you are Lovely Yes oh yes touch your blouse touch your  hair When he comes touch your cheeks with the pink that flies But his glance will do more for your look than these  Indefinite poses of self contemplation The first boy wanders in carrying a small basket  Your least shy look Recreates folk to your image Not that they know what your image is Nor that they care but won t you look at him   Alfred Kreymborg  He d like to look like you Then you ll love him   Rapture holds the boy he sets the basket on the ground The girl stiffens into another pose  She has made cups of her hands She holds them palms waiting under her breasts If you look still higher you may see Three more cups her mouth her eyes Brave lad can you resist so many  The boy s ecstasy crumbles to excitement as the girl looks at him vaguely  What can you what should you what shall you  say So so only so only she ll What can you what should you what shall you  swear Could I let you give her the earth or a tree Lend you something more than you more than me How can you how should you how else could you Make her urge her to have her say whisper Breathe breathe she breathe that she What can you what should you what shall you do You might jump jump off and never come back And she she only she only say no   The girl looks at the boy clearly She moves from the water He follows She stops beyond the willow Ht hesitates   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Do you feel him a thing of silk now you can hear  him Must you be always tearing his flesh With your eyes and your silence Put a quick finger on one of his pores touch it at  least Or he will fall bloodless at your feet And leave you nobody You wouldn t enjoy turning ghoul Faun girl you are beautiful Be kind to yourself   The girl starts toward the boy permits him gradually and gently to caress her  Place your cool mouth to his Press hard and long There will come opening Things which have never sung before Things even you will never understand nor he Turn your large eyes to his Enter You will see what you heard and the mystery grow At the last bring your curious touch to his Hands move to the breeze   Frightened the girl draws away and suddenly disappears Awed the boy cannot follow her  She loves you And who are you who are you that she should Don t ask me that ask tiny questions She of the yellow hair she of the cool green eyes   She of the queer red mouth I know whom you mean Come lad tell me more about her don t be afraid She loves you so you said Let s sit on the grass it gives so pleasantly Now we can talk She loves you But let s talk talk about her You can t Neither can I  Away away from this place There s a pond past these trees Let s steal to a boat a long eerie boat And drift to the water lilies Pink blue or white lilies are quiet thoughts We won t break them for her we don t have to Eh She loves you Poor boy Are you so happy you re sad That s right shut your eyes Wake you when we reach the lilies I ll try I ll try  The boy is gone  She loves you I can assure you now you re asleep Dream boy lilies will wake you pink blue or white No matter the color no harm can come she loves you  Interlude  Trees too are innocent entities Sap sings through them in time with the weather One can see they care little about their fellows Though they do have a way   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Of waving branches to each other For themselves they have a way of nodding pleasantly Also of trying on dresses near a rain glass or a snow  glass Also of staying where they happen to be There are folk who doubt whether they care at all It would be mean though To censure trees they re trees   The lovers come running upon the scene he chasing her He throws the basket aside buttercups fall out  What animals you are Or whether you are Animals I am too dumb to tell Some moments I feel you ve come out of the earth Out of some cool white stone deep down in the earth Or there brushes past and lurks in a corner The thought that you slipped from a tree When the earth stopped spinning That a blue shell brought you When the sea tired waltzing You might be two mice The dryads of woodpeckers Or a pure tiny fish dream  You might be something dropped from the sky Not god children I wouldn t have you that Nor clouds though I love clouds You re something not birds I can tell If I could find you somewhere outside   V  Alfred Kreymborg  Of me I might tell But inside   The boy catches the girl she no longer resists he kisses her  Said the Mother She is lovely Her mouth is red Give her a kiss She wants it And when you are through Give her another But you don t understand Why should you   Exhausted the girl draws away The boy reluctantly builds her a throne of fallen leaves She sits down he hands her the buttercups and some colored scarfs  Do not make her so happy That when the time comes to make her unhappy She will be so unhappy she will die lad Can t you be cross with her Can t you fail to bring her those buttercups Can t you twang somewhere else now and then She ll love you the more Then hers is the crime if she dies It isn t Whose is it Better make her unhappy at once You can t Well I don t know what you should do    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The girl possibly sated with attention stretches out on the leaves The boy watches her comes closer seems doubtful stops Then he sits down near her Something holds him still something else draws him still closer  She wears no scarf over her hair No mask over her eyes over her mouth Nor do you ask her to thus you love her Nor do you see veils round her breasts Veils down her limbs Ask you to I speak to a stone You love her thus   The girl is startled The boy touches her She looks at him rouses herself gets up He turns aside She moves away He does not follow her  If he were sober He would love you as you wish to be loved And as he would love you If his muddled thought of you were clear of desire It is sad that one so young should be drunken so soon But had you not answered him Had you not answered him I know I know It wasn t your fault   Slowly the lovers depart in opposite directions  May the sun blink open your eyes And find the room within all blue And that tiny broken relic Of the night s unhappiness   Vanish like a moth  You will see no bird  Can fly more swiftly away   Interlude  Again under the spell Of these warm scented troubadour winds Brushing winter s convent with insinuating madrigals Those novices the trees Clicking their crooked black needles Are knitting lace is it yellow is it green Timid in pattern as clouds are What with their dropping of stitches Later grown almost heretic Through warmth of their own Or under the foolish persuasion That beauty can add to beauty and hold beauty One or two will work in patches of flowers Once again the troubadours Some sated some broken hearted Will slip away and the convent be as before Maybe the Mother Superior Frowns them off   The boy enters dejectedly His movements are indeterminate but he stops near the willow  You are so straight and still  What does it mean  Are you concerned in the tops of you now With sky matters and winter butterflies   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Do not the leaves you colored trouble you longer Try and recall Try and recall Over this path she used to tread her way Over there he used to throne them for her Green brown red yellow Did you look at me Did you say something   The boy departs The girl enters dejectedly She sits down near the scattered remains of the throne  Girl is the sap in you tired That you no longer resist the wind Did you feel the rain The rain that was here in the night You aren t old what then Another rain may be lighter Even if it isn t no   A silence She loved her love for him But ask her how it died she will cry His faults came and stabbed it Over the tomb she has scrolled My love for him is dead but my love lives on And her love carries white flowers To what was her love for him  The second boy enters He looks at the girl But as the figure continues the boy passes aimlessly through   Beware lad There s a lane of cherry trees On the turn from his grave Don t look at her Or you ll be plucking blossoms In blossom time blossoms being pink Or cherries in cherry time cherries being red And seeing they re a pretty variation from the white Her love will carry them To what was her love for him   The girl has not seen the second boy She leaves the wood A silence  Only when the willow nods Does the water nod Only when the wind nods Does the willow nod Only when a cloud nods Does the wind nod And of course nod  Rhymes with God Slow curtain Alfred Kreymborg    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE SPLENDID COMMONPLACE  IN THIS HOTEL  The headwaiter says Nice day to day He smiles sentimentally The headwaiter says It will rain to day He frowns gracefully Those are the greetings every morning To every old lady And every old gent And every old rogue And every young couple To every guest  And I who do not sleep who wait and watch for the dawn One day I would come down to the world I would have a trumpet as powerful as the wind And I would trumpet out to the world The splendid commonplace Nice day to day And another day I would cry out in despair It will rain to day For every old lady And every old gent And every old rogue And every young couple Are they not guests in this hotel   Emanuel Carnevali  Where the ceiling is the sky And the floor is the earth And the rooms are the houses  But I I this wretched tired thing May I ask for a job As headwaiter Of this hotel  HIS MAJESTY THE LETTER CARRIER  Half past seven in the morning And the sun winks at me Half hidden by the last house of the street His long fingers Scare away these trotting little men Who rush westward from the east to their jobs Laughing the sun pursues them Ah there he is Who The letter carrier of course  What do you think I got up so early for You never see him run He is so proud Because he s got my happiness in that dirty bag He s got a kiss from my sweetheart Some money for me to buy some food And a white nice collar That s why he s so conceited That s why he wants to show   That he doesn t know the sun is behind him That the laughing sun is behind him Pushing him along to make him bring me my happiness A kiss from my sweetheart Some money to buy some food and a clean collar And a letter from an editor that says You re a great poet young man  Damn it I guess he heard me raving about him He passed by my door and didn t even turn around  What shall I do what shall I do  Oh never mind tomorrow tomorrow  DROLATIQUE SÉRIEUX  Through the lowered awning s chink The sun enters my room with the glad fury Of a victorious dagger wielded by an adventurous child I smoke On the blade of the golden dagger The smoke of my cigarette Writhes struggles seems to wail and protest Then escapes runs away hurriedly out of the window It meets the sun This blue dream fed smoke meets the sun The sun has no dream Perhaps it is Truth itself So beautiful   Emanuel Carnevali  Then it s wrong very wrong To puff my dream in the radiant face of Truth Is it blasphemous cowardly Is it to insult the Sun  WHEN IT HAS PASSED  Love I thought it was a long ride in a boat Over a quiet lake around The weeping willows let fall their hair Into the water And amid those hairs the rays Which the sun had forgotten to take with him going away Were of indigo rose purple blue  But now that it has passed I know it was a stream That swept by roaring destroying all all In my soul all that is left is a shrub That sways and waves at the wind like the hair of a witch That whistles and curses the wind like the ghastly arm of a  witch The remembrance  TO THE POETS  Essences of the peoples beautiful selves Violins whose strings quiver With long soft delicate harmonies Even when touched by the world s rough fingers Even when touched by Grief s cold fingers   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Think of the day when you sleeping in your graves Shall be awakened by the thunder of your own voices And by the strong cool winds of your own music For in the fertile soil of the years Your voices will blossom and become thunder Your music will become winds that purify and create  SENTIMENTAL DIRGE  Sweetheart what s the use of you When the night is blue And I m sad with the whisper of the skies And I m heavy and I m weary With my many lies There is no music around me Not a sound But the whisper of the skies I am bound To my sadness with so slender so thin ties Oh so thin still you can t break them Sweetheart what s the use of you  And within me what then pains When it rains Ah the drops fall on the wound And it pains For my soul s a naked wound The rain drops are salty tears Are they tears of some great giant Who still fears   Just like me For the morrows for the things that passed away For the dead dead yesterday  Sweetheart what s the use of you When the laughters are too few When the trees will no more sing For the wind When they wave their ghastly arms Naked arms In despair and no one heeds And my soul is like the reeds Stooping under the low wind Hopelessly like the reeds Broken that shall rise no more And sing softly as before For the wind has been too cruel And too strong  Neath the snow wet lies the fuel And the flame Of my laughter of all laughters Now is dying Oh for shame All you promised that first day What ll you do for me now say What ll you do for me What s the use Of you sweetheart what s the use  Emanuel Carnevali   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THREE POEMS  ALCHEMY  Since I have loved you Every man I pass Goes by me with some hint of you Some windy grace Of your swift movement through the crowd Some similarity of up flung brow That lifts me with the thrill of mountains Some glance of eyes like yours That whisper phraseless things Since I have loved you Every man I pass Goes by me with some hint of you Since I have loved you Are you all men And has love made All men You  THE HARLOT S CHILD  She is a little downy Baby thing With eyes as quick as mirrors To give back what she sees   And she has a sidelong way Of peeking in the corners Of Life s eyes As though she begged a chance To please As though she promised To agree She knows somehow the colors of the world Are fast Chameleon of soul she sets herself To acquiesce  WAR  I have forgotten My old grief Because you love me not I have forgotten The slow rust Of loneliness upon my soul I have forgotten All my ways and woes of life I have forgotten My life Now  Susan M Boogher   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SONGS OF THE DUST  FOLDED POWER  Sorrow can wait For there is magic in the calm estate Of grief lo where the dust complies Wisdom lies  Sorrow can rest Indifferent with her head upon her breast Idle and hushed guarded from fears Content with tears  Sorrow can bide With sealed lids and hands unoccupied Sorrow can fold her latent might Dwelling with night  But Sorrow will rise From her dream of sombre and hushed eternities Lifting a Child she will softly move With a mother s love  She will softly rise Her embrace the dying will recognize Lifting them gently through strange delight To a clearer light  TH E MOULD  No doubt this active will So bravely steeped in sun   This will has vanquished Death And foiled oblivion  But this indifferent clay This fine experienced hand So quiet and these thoughts That all unfinished stand  Feel death as though it were A shadowy caress And win and wear a frail Archaic wistfulness  AUTUMN COMMUNION  This autumn afternoon My fancy need invent No untried sacrament Man can still commune With Beauty as of old The tree the wind s lyre The whirling dust the fire In these my faith is told  Beauty warms us all When horizons crimson burn W e hold heaven s cup in turn The dry leaves gleaming fall Crumbs of mystical bread My dole of Beauty I break   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Love to my lips I take And fear is quieted  The symbols of old are made new 1 watch the reeds and the rushes The spruce trees dip their brushes In the mountain s dusky blue The sky is deep like a pool A fragrance the wind brings over Is warm like hidden clover Though the wind itself is cool  Across the air between The stems and the grey things Sunlight a trellis flings In quietude I lean I hear the lifting zephyr Soft and shy and wild And I feel earth gentle and mild Like the eyes of a velvet heifer  Love scatters and love disperses Lightly the orchards dance In a lovely radiance Down sloping terraces They toss their mellow fruits The rhythmic wind is sowing Softly the floods are flowing Between the twisted roots   Gladys Cromwell  What Beauty need I own When the symbol satisfies I follow services Of tree and cloud and stone Color floods the world I am swayed by sympathy Love is a litany In leaf and cloud unfurled  STAR SONG  There are twisted roots that grow Even from a fragile white anemone But a star has no roots to and fro It floats in the light of the sky like a water lily And fades on the blue flood of day  A star has no roots to hold it No living lonely entity to lose Floods of dim radiance fold it Night and day their silent aura transfuse But no change a star can bruise  A star is adrift and free When day comes it floats into space and complies Like a spirit quietly Like a spirit amazed in a wider paradise At mortal tears and sighs  Gladys Cromwell   1  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE MARCH THAW  On turgid bellowing tramp the freshet rills  Heaped up with yellow wine the winter s brew Out thrown they choke and tumble from the hills And lash their tawny bodies whipping through  With flattened bells comes scudding purple rain The cold sky breaks and drenches out the snow Far from the perfect circle of the sky The heavy winds lick off the boughs they blow And fields are cleansed for plows to slice again For April shall laugh downward by and by  With purifying blasts the wind stalks out And sweeps the carrion of winter on It prods the dank mists stamps with jest about And sows the first blooms on the greening lawn Far up the planks of sky the winter s dross Goes driven to the north her rank smells wave In unseen humors to the icy pole The charwomen of the sky with brushes lave And wash the fields for green and rocks for moss And busily polish up the earth s dull soul  Edwin Curran   VERNON CASTLE  Killed in the Aviation Service Feb 15th 1918  Dead dancer how is this the laurel here Upon your bier The brazen wings the sword and the shrill tone Of bugles blown  Why do you wear light footed one O proud The flag for shroud Where have you danced from what high spheréd dome Have you come home  Bravo you trod the measure gallantly Swiftly flew free Goodbye perhaps your flight has just begun Under the sun  Harriet Monroe   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IN BARRACKS  DEPARTURE  America in shuffling crowds Pelted high voiced goodbyes Upon the ragged troop train Muddled sound of partings An accent here and there acute Popping sudsy soap sprays A girl s bright dress a frantic flag  America shuffling clattering To her high moment A swelter of faint calls  Upraised civilian arms and then Curdy floculations of vague color Drifted about the boarded station house Upholding it like an ark Ever more in the distance  L Company drifted crankily down the track Entrained in hasty coupled cars For mobilization And left there behind Democracy Slack Democracy on the station boards Left America clattering into emotion And shuffling heterogeneously home Emotional not spiritual one said  Who with Company L saw   A new America somewhere Waiting unknowing the future  THE NUMBER  The sheet of the morning Tribune bent With thin crashing and clutters of sound Tight hands held it its fabric Rattled in fragile catastrophe  Sudden figures in the morning Tribune Three with sudden significant being Among slight marks by thousands Strewing the page raised themselves In lustreless knobs small black metallic Above the dim paper breadth  A man Woodby saw three numerals  That rose in dull significant lumps  From the creaking page of the Tribune  His own number carved  Of hard stupid material they seemed  Woodby drafted man left His familiar papers his thesis On an unfinished and ancient past Forever to learn the cold accuracy Of near material of steel of half ounce bullets   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVEILLE  Sleep soaked bodies are pried Out of the obese night laziness Yearning in porous flesh Is squeezed as from a sponge  Silver tubes lifted upward by young buglers Spout glistening sound Upon the murk of early day The sounds of first call Clink and glisten in the early air Bright chips of sound tinkle and clash sweetly Like ice in the dusky water of an urn  Reveille and the murmur of men A murmurous cloud of dusk lifts From the earthen floor A murmur Distant huge sweet with Being s joy Rises from the awakening thousands Of earth born bodies The blare of regimental bands Hoists finally night s curtain With distant shattering  ON THE ROAD  The world sweats In a bedding of throbbing thick light Heat soaks like a bitter oil Into the texture of being   Dust steams from the earth Under the feet of infantry And coats the air with minute fur  Along the smothered road men plod Between silent horizons Between thin yellow borders of the earth Pressed flat under a burden of light Painted vivid silence Waits along the desert s rim  SOUTHWARD  Forbidden Mexico Four hundred yards away A drunken tawny beast Slept across the southward path There shall no soldier go The order was beyond The murky middle of the stream  Forbidden Mexico Its drifting slopes Slid back into sun hid distance Its tawny skin sleek With clean aridity Lay unpunctured by man s growth Four hundred yards away A thousand years could sink Into the gap between this river bank and that   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MAJOR FITZPATR1CK  His back had the sabre s curve Clean sitting on his mount His words were winged words steel tipped Loosed on drab men drilling His was the drama of the harpoon Driving barbed oaths driving deep Into drab men drilling On the battalion parade The dynamic of the oath was his Its knife energy its thrust At the third battalion Major Fitz Hurled personality like bitter shrapnel  FREEBOURNE S RIFLE  It s an old gun the major said But clean give him excellent And pushed the oil scrubbed gun Back on private Freebourne s chest An old gun Hell yes said Freebourne When he tried to turn it in To the Q M for a new one I put two hours a day on it But Freebourne loved its steel He never took the other Two hours on steel man s metal Till the inner twirl of bore Carried the light in gleaming gutters   Baker Brownell  Round coiled round on itself To lurch pointed bullets true A thousand yards Two hours Testing the severe materiality of steel Steel thought steel calculation  Severe absolute in hardness  Loyal to existence  It could transcend sense sogginess and flesh  Two hours the soldier loved his steel  Its truth its edge  Its fearlessness of fact its bitterness of line  Its certainty and decision  PRIVATE RAUSCH  Prisoner in life Rausch a private  Thumped at steel clad existence  Unavailingly  Caught in the impassive tank  Of the dull day firm  With a cool crust of metal  Wrapped around his fluid soul  Rausch thumped and failed  To break the riveting  Booze Rausch found one day  At a small bar under Corrine s room  And soul found vent  In a joyous spout   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Rausch was a gush  Out of a windowless dull tank  Soldier life armor of discipline  The close tyranny of small events  Broke and Rausch full of booze  Spouted himself expressively  Rausch died of tremens one pay day While finding his legitimate soul  THE HURRICANE  The wind soured into night  Acid of a narrow rain  Pitted the sentries paces  With spits of cold  The wind grew in hoarse breaths With the night s age Until the night was wind And darkness spouted on the prone earth From the West s nozzle  Wind and night roaring Like mated beasts Pressed huge bodies On the bulging walls Of tied Sibley tents   One by one the double headed pegs Pulled with a souseling kiss From the rain weak earth  A rope snapped a wall flap Jumped the tent heaved Bulged upward With scared awkwardness And fell on a broken tripod  The wind night rain With huge onwardness West south east north poured itself Bitterly on the fiat earth  Three Nature whipped sentries Tied into their ponchos Pried through the heaving night Like tired swimmers  TAPS  Into pure night A strand of golden sound Weaves a design  Life woven in sound Is night and song  Pathos of a soul Inspires the darkness  Baker Brownell  POETRY A Magazine of Verse COMMENT  THE WAR AND THE ARTIST  T IS difficult to say anything about the war without being platitudinous in these days when so much is being said and said often absorbingly well by people who are in it And yet the emotion of the moment is too keen for silence even if too keen for adequate utterance What right have we to live when so many are dying What right have we elders to send youth into battle while we keep our safe places by the fire What right has the thinker to his problem the artist to his vision the poet to his song while fresh lives are giving up their hope of thought and art and song How can we take the new era at our soldiers hands how can we who have laid on their shoulders the burden of the past accept the future from them who should have lived to possess it from them to whom not the past but the future belonged  All other issues seem small beside this heroic issue on which we stake those infinitely precious lives If agriculture and commerce become the feeders the tool makers of war the arts seem at first glance to be a pottering with toys a lisping of words out of relation with these marching armies out of the current of great events What flattering unction shall we poets lay to our bruised souls as we chant our little songs while battles are won and lost What are we doing to make the world safe for democracy  Well it may be that we are doing more than we know Poets have made more wars than kings and it is for them   The War and the Artist  and not for kings to make an end of war by removing its veil of glamour Kings are after all impotent It was men s imaginations that once gave them power and splendor but for a century or two men s imaginations have been dethroning them and stripping their pitiful figures bare War remains what it always was a contest not so much of material forces as of spiritual forces And the poet the artist are makers of spiritual forces leaders of men s imaginations  For years the poets the artists have been dictating terms of peace to the next age Every painter of his own woodlot every poet singing the beauty of working girls instead of queens or the bravery of common men instead of princes has been doing his bit to democratize the world The work has been done not only by Titans like Whitman but also by the sheer mass and weight of lesser men moved by the same spirit and leading their neighbors and admirers in the same direction The Kaiser is a man of straw against a force like this Whitman and Millet beat him before he was born our soldiers have but to finish the job  Never was the artist more necessary than now his freedom of spirit his self assertion his creative fire When the whole world is in the melting pot when civilization is to be reminted and no one can tell what stamp its face and reverse will bear when ideas which flowed hitherto in separate channels are gathering into vast tides that overwash the boundaries of nations when this swarming earth sun lit moon guarded seems a little ball fingered for a throw by some colossal Pitcher with his eye on the Ultimate Event   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  then the stand of the individual against immensities a stand always hazardous becomes a gesture of incredible power and pride an attitude of almost impossible heroism the lonely uprising of a naked pigmy between overpowering hordes and the abyss  This is the ultimate test of the poet This must be his attitude today between the forces of life and death between the embattled nations sweeping decrepit and rotten things into the gulf and those invisible rangers of the air whose breath is the future Puny unit of the unconquerable will he must hold up his little torch between the old and new  Unhurt amid the war of elements The wreck of matter and the crash of worlds  H M  REVIEWS  SWINBURNE VERSUS BIOGRAPHERS  The Life of Algernon Charles Swinburne by Edmund  Gosse C B The Macmillan Co  Gosse s Life of Swinburne is merely the attempt of a  silly and pompous old man to present a man of genius an  attempt necessarily foredoomed to failure and not worth the  attention of even the most cursive reviewer Gosse has  written one excellent book Father and Son prompted accord  ing to gossip by his wife s fear that Mr George Moore hav  ing been rashly allowed access to Mr Gosse s diaries  proposed to steal the material Mr Gosse has also held  divers positions of trust under the British government in   Swinburne versus Biographers  one of which at least he has fulfilled his functions with great credit and fairness Apart from that he resembles many literary figures of about his age and generation who coming after the more or less drunken and more or less obstreperous real Victorians acquired only the cant and the fustiness  Tennyson so muzzy that he tried to go out through the fire place Morris William not Lewis lying on the floor biting the table leg in a rage because Gabriel had gone off before he Morris had finished what he was saying Swinburne at the Madox Browns door in a cab while the housekeeper lectures the cabman Wot No sir my marster is at the ead of is table carving the j int That s Mr Swinburne taike im up to the barth were all vital and human people The real pre raphaelites lived with Ford Madox Brown s hospitable address sewn inside their coats in case of these little events Tennyson personally the North country ox might very well take refuge from his deplorable manners in verbal patisserie Thackeray might snivvel over not being allowed to write with desirable openness most of these people surround themselves with extenuations but for the next generation there is not much to be said save that they go like better men toward extinction W e do not however wish a Swinburne coated with veneer of British officialdom and decked out for a psalm singing audience  Gosse in the safety of his annual pension of 666 16 shillings 8 pence has little to fear from the slings of fortune   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  or from the criticisms of younger men If he preferred to present Swinburne as an epileptic rather than as an intemperate drinker we can only attribute this to his taste a taste for kowtowing  The events at the art club which he so prudishly glozes over were the outcome of alcohol and the story is worth while if only for the magnificent tanning that Whistler administered to the Arts Club committee You ought to be proud that there is in London a club where the greatest poet of your time can get drunk if he wants to otherwise he might lie in the gutter  There is more Swinburne and perhaps more is to be told of his tragedy in a few vignettes than is to be found in all Gosse s fusty volume Swinburne s tragedy was that he ended as a deaf querulous old man in Putney mediocre in his faculties W H Davies tells the story of the little old man looking into a perambulator in front of a pub and a cockney woman hastily interposing herself and pulling the clothes over her infant s head with Narsty old man e sharn t look at my baby  Thus departed his mundane glory the glory of a red mane the glory of the strong swimmer of the swimmer who when he was pulled out of the channel apparently drowned came to and held his French fishermen rescuers spellbound all the way to shore declaiming page after page of Hugo  As George Moore in his writings nearly always attributes to himself the witty remarks wherewith other men have   Swinburne versus Biographers  extinguished him in conversation we may be pardoned for another tale which may as likely as not contain verity It is said that Moore desired greatly to look upon Swinburne and having obtained his address repaired to the Temple and heavily climbing the stairs heard noises  come fa mar per tempesta  They proceeded from Swinburne s rooms Moore knocked the door was already open No answer was given The booming increased and diminished and increased Moore entered the room was empty he proceeded to the next open door and to still another He stood aghast Swinburne hair on end and stark naked strode backwards and forwards howling Aeschylus Moore stood paralyzed Swinburne after some moments caught sight of him thundered What the hell do you want Moore summoned his waning powers of expression and with mountainous effort brought forth the verbal mouse Please sir are these Mr Jones chambers  No sir  Whereat Mr George Moore departed  It is impossible that a self respecting biographer should not have found many such tales of Swinburne The anaemic Gosse prefers the epileptic version Any poet might be justified in taking to drink on finding himself born into a world full of Gosses Comstocks and Sumners  Swinburne s art is out of fashion The best imitations of him are by the Germans The nineties refined upon him   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and Kipling has set his cello tunes to the pilly wink of one banjo  Swinburne recognized poetry as an art and as an art of verbal music Keats had got so far as to see that it need not be the pack mule of philosophy Swinburne s actual writing is very often rather distressing but a deal of his verse is no worse written than Shelley s Ode to the West Wind He habitually makes a fine stanzaic form writes one or two fine strophes in it and then continues to pour into the mould strophes of diminishing quality  His biography is perfectly well written in his work He is never better than in the Ballad of Life the Ballad of Death and the Triumph of Time To the careful reader this last shows quite clearly that Swinburne was actually broken by a real and not by a feigned emotional catastrophe early in life of this his later slow decline is a witness There is a lack of intellect in his work After the poems in the Laus Veneris volume not particularly the title poem and the poems of the time when he made his magnificent adaptations from Villon he had few rallies of force one of them in Sienna  He neglected the value of words as words and was intent on their value as sound His habit of choice grew mechanical and he himself perceived it and parodied his own systemization  Moderns more awake to the value of language will read  him with increasing annoyance but I think few men who  read him before their faculty for literary criticism is awak   Swinburne versus Biographers  ened the faculty for purely literary discrimination as contrasted with melopoeic discrimination will escape the enthusiasm of his emotions some of which were indubitably real At any rate we can whatever our verbal fastidiousness be thankful for any man who kept alive some spirit of paganism and of revolt in a papier maché era in a time swarming with Longfellows Mabies Gosses Harrisons  After all the whole of his defects can be summed up in one that is inaccurate writing and this by no means ubiquitous T o quote his magnificent passages is but to point out familiar things in our landscape Hertha is fit for professors and young ladies in boarding school The two ballads and the Triumph of Life are full of sheer imagism of passages faultless  No one else has made such music in English I mean has  made his kind of music and it is a music which will compare  with Chaucer s Hide Absalon thi gilte tresses clere or with  any other maker you like  The Villon translations stand with Rossetti s and the  Rubaiyat among the Victorian translations The ballad  Where ye droon ane man I drown twa is as fine as any  reconstruction and the cross rhythms are magnificent The  Itylus the Ballad of Burdens what is the use of naming  over poems so familiar to all of us  As yet you get no whole or perfect poet He and  Browning are the best of the Victorian era and Browning  wrote to a theory of the universe thereby cutting off a fair  half of the moods for expression   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  No man who cares for his art can be deaf to the rhythms of Swinburne deaf to their splendor deaf also to their bathos The sound of Dolores is in places like that of horses hoofs being pulled out of mud The sound in a poem of sleep is so heavy that one can hardly read it aloud the voice is drawn into a slumber I am not sure that this effect is not excessive and that it does not show the author overshooting his mark but for all that it shows ability in his craft and has whatever one s final opinion an indisputable value as experiment Swinburne s surging and leaping dactyllics had no comparable forerunners in English  His virtues might be largely dug from the Greeks and his faults mostly traceable to Victor Hugo But a perception of the beauties of Greek melopoeia does not constitute a mastery in the creation of similar melopoeia The rhythm building faculty was in Swinburne and was perhaps the chief part of his genius The word selecting word castigating faculty was nearly absent Unusual and gorgeous words attracted him His dispraisers say that his vocabulary is one of the smallest at any poet s command and that he uses the same adjectives to depict either a woman or a sunset There are times when this last is not or need not be ipso facto a fault There is an emotional fusion of the perceptions and a certain kind of verbal confusion has an emotive value in writing but this is of all sorts of writing the most dangerous to an author and the unconscious collapse into this sort of writing has wrecked more poets in our time than perhaps all other faults put together   Forth ballad and take roses in thine arms  Even till the top rose prick thee in the throat  Where the least thorn prick harms  And gird thee in the golden singing coat   Borgia thy gold hair s color burns in me   The splendid lines mount up in one s memory and overwhelm any minute restrictions of one s praise It is the literary fashion to write exclusively of Swinburne s defects and the fashion is perhaps not a bad one for the public is still and will presumably remain indiscriminate Defects are in Swinburne by the bushelful the discriminating reader will not be able to overlook them and need not condone them neither will he be swept off his feet by detractors There are in Swinburne fine passages like fragments of fine marble statues there are fine transcripts from the Greek  A little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is man  And there is underneath all the writing a magnificent passion for liberty a passion dead as mutton in most of his contemporaries and immeasurably deader than mutton in a people who allow their literature to be blanketed by a Corn stock and his successors for liberty is not merely a catchword of politics nor a right to shove little slips of paper through a hole The passion not merely for political but also for personal liberty is the bedrock of Swinburne s writing The sense of tragedy and of the unreasoning cruelty of the gods hangs over it He fell into facile writing and he accepted a facile compromise for life but no facile solution for his universe His unbelief did not desert him no not even in Putney Ezra Pound   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A GLASS BLOWER OF TIME  Lustra by Ezra Pound Elkin Mathews London and  Alfred A Knopf New York  Reading in a single volume Ezra Pound s poems of the  last few years one discovers or at least should discover in oneself a certain misjudgment of this poet Though he has the habit of putting his unpopular foot forward so that one must be on one s guard he is not the extremist the bête noir one had thought him  Neither in form nor in substance is he the radical so many readers have assumed him to be What with his quantities stresses alliterations iterations and heaven only knows what his style is certainly not anarchical nor arbitrary On the contrary it is elaborate his forms are much more difficult and require more fineness of touch than a sonnet Neither is he the extremist in his choice of subjects indeed he seems almost timid about them One might imagine that this poet would not dare treat a subject that had not been sanctified or the reverse by Catullus Villon Arnaut Daniel or some other ancient of the many he knows  What are Pound s most important qualities and what are his most important contributions to English poetry  To me his most important quality is grace No matter what he takes up it melts into extreme grace Grace is present in the idea as well as in the form The movement of many of his poems suggests what a Greek dance must have been like they are rhythmical with a deep solemn graceful rhythm with never a shade of triviality or vulgarity One   can find proof of this almost anywhere in the book in Dance Figure in The Spring Here is a part of The Fish and the Shadow  As light as the shadow of the fish that falls through the water  She came into the large room by the stair  Yawning a little she came with the sleep still upon her  I am just from bed The sleep is still in my eyes Come I have had a long dream  And I That wood  And two springs have passed us Not so far no not so far now There is a place but no one else knows it A field in a valley  Quì ieu sui avinen Ieu lo sai  She must speak of the time  Of Arnaut de Mareuil I thought qu ieu sui avinen Light as the shadow of the fish That falls through the pale green water  O r this from the River Song  The purple house and the crimson are full of spring softness South of the pond the willow tips are half blue and bluer Their cords tangle in mist against the brocade like palace Vine strings a hundred feet long hang down from the carved rail  ings And high over the willows the fine birds sing to each other and  listen Crying Kwan Kuan for the early wind and the feel of it The wind bundles itself into a bluish cloud and wanders off Over a thousand gates over a thousand doors are the sounds of  spring singing  His other important quality is clearness Pound speaks  of having seen the dome of pure color it is this purity  of color which distinguishes him In Provincia Deserta   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  is a rich emotionalism in The Social Order II is humor in Cabaret Dancer is robustness All these qualities are found in other poets writing in free or metric verse yet the extreme cleanness and clearness with which these effects are expressed is the mark of Pound s uncompromising art soul  Of course readers will be irritated by one thing or another in this book The very subtle grace to which almost every poem subject is reduced the butterfly grace which gives it a sort of rarefied atmosphere together with the absolutely flawless technique will irritate some readers There is also the feeling to put it very crudely of the poet reformer with which he seems possessed This may be needed perhaps more needed than anything else yet the mind slightly resents it  Outside of the Chinese group of which his friend Ford Madox Hueffer writes intriguingly that if they were Pound s own they alone would make him the greatest poet of our time some readers will feel a lack of pabulum It is not more lyrical poems like Provincia Deserta nor more robust poems like Cabaret Dancer that would best make up for this need but rather poems in the manner of The Return with the infinite possibilities of the fantastic real  Our resentment though is often due to the fact that our palates have been spoiled by the cloying sweetness of much of what we read The lack of pabulum is often only superficial When Pound writes of a beautiful woman  The odor of your patchouli Assails me and concerns me almost as little   A Glass blower of Time  the lines though seemingly trivial will mean much to a mind which can grasp the delicacy of balance between the two objects  Pound is an important poet of our era just as other poets who are now classics were of their eras He is not hard reading or mysterious or anything else uncanny Any intelligent person who comes to him with an open mind will feel much of his beauty It is only the denseness of many of our established opinion makers which has kept thousands of lovers of poetry away  This poet evidently pays his respect to such critics in The Faun  Ha sir I have seen you sniffing and snoozling about among my  flowers And what pray do you know about horticulture you capriped Come Auster come Areliota And see the Faun in our garden But if you move or speak This thing will run at you And scare itself to spasms  Max Michelson  A GROUP OF ENGLISH CONTEMPORARIES  An Annual of New Poetry 1917 Constable and Co Ltd  An anthology has the same advantages that an exhibition of pictures has and it has also the same disadvantages It introduces work that might otherwise not gain the attention of the public and on the other hand it gives us perhaps too slight a showing of any one man s work for that full understanding which comes with a more extended view But   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  whether retrospective or contemporary anthologies and exhibitions are usually very vital things since they enable us to perceive the work of various poets and artists in juxtaposition making it incumbent upon the reader or observer to make his own choice and selection and thereby become as Mr Spingarn claims a critic who is also creative Certainly the task of reviewing an anthology of contemporary work unless it be merely perfunctory is far more difficult than that of reviewing a single author and making choice of pictures or poems that all have a certain unity in personality and style particularly when as in the present case the work represented is not dominated by any intention to write in any given way or to follow any definite school or ism  Of the eight contributors to this annual Gordon Bottomley W H Davies John Drinkwater Edward Eastaway Robert Frost W W Gibson T Sturge Moore R C Trevelyan all are Englishmen except Robert Frost though this of itself is of course no guarantee of unity either Yet the poets seem to be divided somewhat into groups Messrs Drinkwater Davies and Gibson in one and Messrs Bottomley Eastaway and Frost in another with Mr Moore and Mr Trevelyan in the third Of course this grouping applies only to this collection and is not meant in too strict a sense  The first group we may call the Wordsworthian These poets seem to follow the Wordsworthian convention of making simple folks more simple than they really are One re   calls in this connection Poe s Why with William on a stone when we can have Jacques under an oak In Mr Davies this tendency falls to the level of such a poem as Brothers which pictures imbecility in a truly imbecile fashion In Mr Drinkwater s section we have a pretty picture of a group of working people falling under the spell of nature in pre Wordsworthian style out from the city of mean emprise  into the world of June  Beneath cool clustered branch and bloom  Littered with stars of amethyst  Sun arrows glancing through the gloom  They slept the lush young bracken kissed  The tired forms Ah wellaway  Within so wide a peace to see  Fellows who measure every day  Merely the roads of misery  In Mr Gibson this tendency amounts almost to a fixed idea And what can one say of the monotony of Mr Gibson s style Is there any reason why poetic diction should be subjected to less stringent criticism than the language of prose Must we accept in poetry what would prove insufferable in prose A part of the monotony of Mr Gibson s style comes from his persistent use of the colorless nameless third person he who is the protagonist of all the poems but who never does anything of himself or without Mr Gibson s prompting And one continually feels Mr Gibson prompting One gets the gist of the poems at three removes what the author says he thinks or feels about things He sniffed the clean and eager smell He liked the daffodils until the he ness or her ness amounts to a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  positive grayness that blunts the mind And through all this writing about him or her one becomes conscious of a growing resentment that Mr Gibson should so persistently exploit in poetry the working classes It amounts to a literary propaganda and like much social propaganda it carries with it the suspicion of a rather patronizing attitude Folk poetry of or about the people is never class conscious One feels continually that this poet is One feels as Dostoevsky said that this is a gentleman writing about the masses  We find a very different spirit in the poetry of T Sturge Moore and R C Trevelyan for whom today and yesterday are one Mr Sturge Moore having chosen or been chosen by a Biblical subject invests it with new imaginative atmosphere and through the intensive study of character and mood creates and developes a crisis that is sharply modern Mr Moore s verse is involved but it has beautiful texture and however involved his style is one realizes that it is so on account of the nature of the thought which it follows and reveals whereas the poetic inversions to which one objects are those awkward externalities which are merely makeshifts and reveal nothing It is unfortunate for Mr Garnett s recommendation of this annual as a good style book that the first poem in it should be an example of what not to do in the matter of inversions  An even more exotic note is found in The Pearl Tree by R C Trevelyan If this is not a translation it is an even more remarkable production having the very spirit   A Group of English Contemporaries  and accent of the Hindu originals which celebrate the loves of Krishna and Radha with that union of secular and divine love which is so astonishing to our cruder western minds This is a poem in the form of a drama very beautiful in conception and verse  There is a new intensive lyricism in the work of Gordon Bottomley Edward Eastaway and Robert Frost a new landscape a new life Other men have looked on the earth to love it but with less sense of a merged identity Other men have written of love or of nature but in a more general way love being love and with less precision in regard to the emotion These men know the value of the thing so often disregarded they appreciate the shadow as well as the light and as Mr Frost says in The Oven Bird  The question that he frames in all but words Is what to make of a diminished thing  Mr Frost is represented here almost exclusively in a pastoral vein no doubt to bring him in closer harmony with the others but one wishes that his Hill Wife which is one of the most beautful and perhaps the most lyric of his poems could also have been included  Mr Bottomley s poetry has a personal and intimate charm and the quality noted above is apparent in such poems as Atlantis Sinai A Surrey Night and New Year s Eve 1913 Unfortunately much of his work is marred by awkward inversions as in The Ploughman and by occasional infelicities of sound unconsidered apparently by Mr Garnett as in  The thin light films a wider sky Than I have lived beneath   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  His blank verse has a greater security of style than one finds in the stanzaic poems although one may question if  Because I have no body to hide my thoughts That are being scanned as if by unseen eyes Perused and judged ineluctably judged I shivering in that exposury Until dissemination is complete  representing a certain rush of words to the pen represents also that distinction of style which the American poet is advised to emulate  The poems of Edward Eastaway the pseudonym of Edward Thomas who was killed in action last April are like hazel nuts hid in a hedge Their meaning only shyly reveals itself the words play with it and then reveal it although they are sometimes twisted and crossed a little like the branches of a tree through which the sky is more beautiful This poet experiences nature not as something seen outside one s self but within one His identity is only  complete through nature The secret of it is in the poem called Beauty What does it mean Tired angry and ill at ease  No man woman or child alive could please Me now And yet I almost dare to laugh Because I sit and frame an epitaph Here lies all that no one loved of him And that loved no one Then in a trice that whim Has wearied But though I am like a river At fall of evening when it seems that never Has the sun lighted it or warmed it while Cross breezes cut the surface to a file This heart some fraction of me happily Floats through the window even now to a tree Down in the misting dim lit quiet vale Not like a pewit that returns to wail   A Group of English Contemporaries  For something it has lost but like a dove That slants unswerving to its home and love There I find my rest and through the dusk air Flies what yet lives in me Beauty is there  One would like to quote more from Mr Thomas but already an American edition of his poems has been published by Henry Holt amp Co and readers will appreciate for themselves this poet s rare quality A C H  IMAGISM SECULAR AND ESOTERIC  Some Imagist Poets 1917 Houghton Mifflin Co  In this anthology we meet again the six poets who have appeared under this title in the volumes of 1915 and 1916 each one a little less provocative and challenging it may be now that imagism has become a staple in the market That is the way with all rebels they will go and get accepted and become fashionable Nowadays everyone is writing imagist vers libre or what the writers conceive as such particularly those who at the beginning made the most outcry against it Free verse is now accepted in good society where rhymed verse is even considered a little shabby and old fashioned  The term Imagism was invented to fit a certain element of poetry involving also a certain artistic approach or method The name alone was new this and the determination of a small group of poets living in London to write poetry as entirely imagistic as possible All the poets have been imagistic at times some more consistently than others In the March 1913 number of POETRY Mr Ezra Pound de   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  fined an image as that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time a definition to which all who are in doubt upon the subject should be referred  Unfortunately imagism has now come to mean almost any kind of poetry written in Unrhymed irregular verse and the image referred solely to the visual sense is taken to mean some sort of a pictorial impression  Even so astute a critc as Padraic Colum says in a recent review of Arthur Symons All are most efficiently rendered and as one reads them one queries why the imagists if they want only to render the visible thing should strive after a new technique  Yet even though imagism has become more of a catchword than a key to understanding the imagists early and late have added much to our enjoyment not only as poets but as sprightly antagonists In the latter aspect they have shown a marked disposition to come back at their critics Adverse criticism has been as meat and bread to them It has furnished them with the most capital material for advertisements the one that I remember best being that in which certain unfavorable not to say vicious remarks by Professor William Ellery Leonard were set side by side with extracts from the Blackwoods article condemning John Keats under the bold caption Is History Repeating Itself  But to turn to the present volume It is not with any light mood that one reads the poems of Richard Aldington filled as these are with the note of regret the unhappiness   Imagism Secular and Esoteric  of the conscript who has no taste for war and who is too  honest to bolster up his spirits with any false enthusiasm He  records instead the few moments that he can steal off by  himself he longs for solitude and if he refers to the war  and to his condition it is only through allusion inevitably  Greek as in Captive  They have torn the gold tettinx  From my hair  And wrenched the bronze sandals  From my ankles  They have taken from me my friend Who knew the holy wisdom of poets Who had drunk at the feast Where Simonides sang  One always gets the effect of a double image when reading Aldington s poems it is like watching Hyacinth looking at his own reflection but in this case it is a young Englishman who sees himself as a Greek youth One would like occasionally to feel the image more single Curiously enough these poems are more like H D s in method than Mr Aldington s usually are particularly Inarticulate Grief and they seem less like the poet of Choricos who has more fluency than H D Mr Aldington has never surpassed that poem He may hate it because it is so often quoted but it has permanence nevertheless  One detects a deeper note of passion in H D s poems What her work lacks is sequence the kind of music that involves and envelopes the thing It is hard to read more than two or three of the poems at a time because of a certain broken quality It remnids one of the work of certain   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  modern painters who are so intent on giving form to each object in a picture that the whole lacks cohesion Poetry is the language of crisis and H D s verse is admirably adapted to passionate utterance but all crisis and no relief is like a jewel with no setting Her work could be more fluid without loss of precision  Mr Fletcher s poems are more descriptive than usual a tendency which he knows how to avoid on occasion although it sometimes swamps his poems In these verses his words seem to have been mustered into service somewhat unwillingly They serve his mood but they do not themselves create or evoke the mood as in some of his most distinctive work  The war seems to have had a peculiarly unhappy effect upon Mr Flint s poetry it is almost purely reportorial without the excuse of journalism which is to convey news Bare statement even statement of sensations will not of itself make a poem Mr Lawrence on the other hand is introspective to the point of obscurity but he is not in the least unintelligible to one who understands states of consciousness beneath the surface Terra Nuova records a psychological experience with the sort of unflinching truth which one has learned to expect from Mr Lawrence There are perhaps people so undifferentiated that they could not possibly understand what Mr Lawrence is driving at to them this poem will be as dark as the tomb  Miss Lowell s contribution to the book is a series of Lacquer Prints translations or reflections from the Japanese   Notes  expressed with true Japanese brevity delicacy of feeling although a little more terse and epigramatic than one feels Japanese originals to be A C H  NOTES  Mr Alfred Kreymborg of New York is well known as the author
