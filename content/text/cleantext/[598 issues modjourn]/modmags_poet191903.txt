 Copyright 1919 by Harriet Monroe All rights reserved   VOL XIII No VI  MARCH 1919  POEMS FROM THE PROPERTIUS SERIES  I  HADES of Callimachus Coan ghosts of Philetas It is in your grove I would walk I who come first from the clear font Bringing the Grecian orgies into Italy  and the dance into Italy Who hath taught you so subtle a measure in what hall have you heard it What foot beat out your time bar what water has mellowed your whistles  Out weariers of Apollo will as we know continue their  Martian generalities  We have kept our erasers in order A new fangled chariot follows the flower hung horses A young Muse with young loves clustered about her  ascends with me into the ether And there is no high road to the Muses   Annalists will continue to record Roman reputations Celebrities from the Trans Caucasus will belaud Roman celebrities And expound the distentions of empire  But for something to read in normal circumstances For a few pages brought down from the forked hill un  sullied I ask a wreath which will not crush my head And there is no hurry about it  I shall have doubtless a boom after my funeral Seeing that long standing increases all things regardless of quality And who would have known the towers  pulled down by a deal wood horse Or of Achilles withstaying waters by Simois Or of Hector spattering wheel rims Or of Polydamas by Scamander or Helenus and Dei  phobus Their door yard would scarcely know them or Paris Small talk O Ilion and O Troad  twice taken by Oetaean gods If Homer had not stated your case  And I also among the later nephews of this city  shall have my dog s day With no stone upon my contemptible sepulchre My vote coming from the temple of Phoebus in Lycia at  Patara   Ezra Pound  And in the mean time my songs will travel And the devirginated young ladies will enjoy them when they have got over the strangeness For Orpheus tamed the wild beasts and held up the Threician river And Citharaon shook up the rocks by Thebes  and danced them into a bulwark at his pleasure And you O Polyphemus did harsh Galatea almost Turn to your dripping horses because of a tune under  Aetna W e must look into the matter Bacchus and Apollo in favor of it There will be a crowd of young women doing homage to my palaver  Though my house is not propped up by Taenarian columns From Laconia associated with Neptune and Cerberus Though it is not stretched upon gilded beams My orchards do not lie level and wide  as the forests of Phaeacia the luxurious and Ionian Nor are my caverns stuffed stiff with a Marcian vintage  my cellar does not date from Numa Pompilius Nor bristle with wine jars Yet the companions of the Muses will keep their collective  nose in my books And weary with historical data they will turn to my dance tune   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Happy who are mentioned in my pamphlets The songs shall be a fine tomb stone over their beauty  But against this Neither expensive pyramids scraping the stars in their route Nor houses modelled upon that of Jove in East Elis Nor the monumental effigies of Mausolus  are a complete elucidation of death Flame burns rain sinks into the cracks And they all go to rack ruin beneath the thud of the years  Stands Genius a deathless adornment a name not to be worn out with the years  II  I had been seen in the shade recumbent on cushioned Helicon The water dripping from Bellerophon s horse Alba your kings and the realm your folk have constructed  with such industry Shall be yawned out on my lyre with such industry My little mouth shall gobble in such great fountains Whereof father Ennius sitting before I came hath drunk  I had rehearsed the Curian brothers and made remarks on  the Horatian javelin Near Q H Flaccus book stall Of royal Aemilia drawn on the memorial raft Of the victorious delay of Fabius and the left handed  battle at Cannae   Ezra Pound  Of lares fleeing the Roman seat   I had sung of all these And of Hannibal  and of Jove protected by geese  And Phoebus looking upon me from the Castalian tree Said then You idiot What are you doing with that water Who has ordered a book about heroes You need Propertius not think About acquiring that sort of a reputation  Soft fields must be worn by small wheels Your pamphlets will be thrown thrown often into a chair Where a girl waits alone for her man  Why wrench your page out of its course No keel will sink with your genius Let another oar churn the water Another wheel the arena mid crowd is as bad as mid sea  He had spoken and pointed me a place with his plectrum  Orgies of vintages an earthen mage of Silenus  Strengthened with rushes Tegean Pan The small birds of the Cytherean mother  their Punic feces dyed in the Gorgon s lake Nine girls from as many countrysides bearing her offerings in their unhardened hands  Such my cohort and setting And she bound ivy to his thyrsos   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Fitted songs to the strings  roses twined in her hands And one among them looked at me with face offended Calliope  Content ever to move with white swans Nor will the noise of high horses lead you ever to battle Nor will the public criers ever have your name  in their classic horns Nor Mars shout you in the wood at Aeonium nor where Rome ruins German riches Nor where the Rhine flows with barbarous blood  and flood carries wounded Suevi Obviously crowned lovers at unknown doors Night dogs the marks of a drunken scurry These are your images and from you the sorcerizing  of shut in young ladies The wounding of austere men by chicane  Thus Mistress Calliope  Dabbling her hands in the fount thus she Stiffened our face with the backwash of Philetas the Coan  Ill  Midnight and a letter comes to me from our mistress Telling me to come to Tibur At once Bright tips reach up from twin towers Anienan spring water falls into flat spread pools   Ezra Pound  What is to be done about it Shall I entrust myself to entangled shadows Where bold hands may do violence to my person  Yet if I postpone my obedience because of this respectable terror I shall be prey to lamentations worse than a nocturnal assailant And I shall be in the wrong and it will last a twelve month For her hands have no kindness me ward  Nor is there anyone to whom lovers are not sacred at midnight And in the Via Sciro  If any man would be a lover  he may walk on the Scythian coast No barbarism would go to the extent of doing him harm The moon will carry his candle  the stars will point out the stumbles Cupid will carry lighted torches before him and keep mad dogs off his ankles Thus all roads are perfectly safe and at any hour Who so indecorous as to shed the pure gore of a suitor Cypris is his cicerone  What if undertakers follow my track such a death is worth dying   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  She would bring frankincense and wreaths to my tomb She would sit like an ornament on my pyre  Gods aid let not my bones lie in a public location With crowds too assiduous in their crossing of it For thus are tombs of lovers most desecrated  May a woody and sequestered place cover me with its foliage Or may I inter beneath the hummock of some as yet uncatalogued sand At any rate I shall not have my epitaph in a high road  IV  When when and whenever death closes our eyelids Moving naked over Acheron Upon the one raft victor and conquered together Marius and Jugurtha together One tangle of shadows  Caesar plots against India Tigris and Euphrates shall from now on flow at his bidding Tibet shall be full of Roman policemen The Parthians shall get used to our statuary  and acquire a Roman religion  One raft on the veiled flood of Acheron Marius and Jugurtha together   Ezra Pound  Nor at my funeral either will there be any long trail  bearing ancestral lares and images No trumpets filled with my emptiness Nor shall it be on an Attalic bed  The perfumed cloths shall be absent A small plebeian procession  Enough enough and in plenty There will be three books at my obsequies Which I take my not unworthy gift to Persephone  You will follow the bare scarified breast Nor will you be weary of calling my name nor too weary T o place the last kiss on my lips When the Syrian onyx is broken  He who is now vacant dust Was once the slave of one passion Give that much inscription Death why tardily come  You sometime will lament a lost friend for it is a custom This care for past men Since Adonis was gored in Idalia and the Cytherean Ran crying with out spread hair In vain you call back the shade In vain Cynthia vain call to unanswering shadow small talk comes from small bones  Ezra Pound   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  BROKEN WINDOWS  BERKET AND THE STARS  A day on the boulevards chosen out of ten years of Student poverty One best day out of ten good ones Berket in high spirits Ha oranges Let s have one And he made to snatch an orange from the vender s cart  Now so clever was the deception so nicely timed To the full sweep of certain wave summits That the rumor of the thing has come down through Three generations which is relatively forever  THE YOUNG LAUNDRYMAN  Ladies I crave your indulgence for My friend Wu Kee young agile clear eyed And clean limbed his muscles ripple Under the thin blue shirt and his naked feet in Their straw sandals lift at the heel shift and Find new postures continually  Your husband s shirts to wash please for W u Kee  TIME THE HANGMAN  Poor old Abner poor old white haired nigger I remember when you were so strong You hung yourself by a rope round the neck   William Carlos Williams  In Doc Hollister s barn to prove you could beat The faker in the circus and it didn t choke you Now your face is in your hands and your elbows Are on your knees and you are silent and broken  COMPLETE DESTRUCTION  It was an icy day We buried the cat Then took her box And set match to it In the back yard Those fleas that escaped Earth and fire Died by the cold  THE POOR  By constantly tormenting them With reminders of the lice in Their children s hair the School physician first Brought their hatred down on him But by this familiarity They grew used to him and so At last Took him for their friend and adviser   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A FRIEND OF MINE  Well Lizzie Anderson seventeen men and The baby hard to find a father for  What will the good father in heaven say To the local judge if he do not solve this problem Does one with a little two pointed smile Change the law pouff into a mouthful of phrases  THE GENTLE MAN  I feel the caress of my own fingers On my own neck as I place my collar And think pityingly of the kind Women I have known  TO BE CLOSELY WRITTEN ON A SMALL PIECE OF PAPER WHICH FOLDED INTO A TIGHT LOZENGE WILL FIT ANY GIRL S LOCKET  Lo the leaves Upon the new autumn grass  Look at them well   THE SOUGHING WIND  Some leaves hang late and some fall Before the first frost so goes The tale of winter branches and old bones   William Carlos Williams  EPITAPH  An old willow with hollow branches Slowly swayed his few high bright tendrils And sang  Love is a young green willow Shimmering at the bare wood s edge  SPRING  O my grey hairs You are truly white as plum blossoms  STROLLER  I have seen the hills blue I have seen them purple And it is as hard to know The words of a woman As to straighten the crumpled branch  Of an old willow  MEMORY OF APRIL  You say love is this love is that Poplar tassels willow tendrils The wind and the rain comb Tinkle and drip tinkle and drip Branches drifting apart Hagh Love has not even visited this country   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PLAY  Subtle clever brain wiser than I am  By what devious means do you contrive To remain idle Teach me O Master  LINES  Leaves are grey green The glass broken bright green  THE DARK DAY  A three day long rain from the east An interminable talking talking Of no consequence patter patter patter Hand in hand little winds Blow the thin streams aslant Warm Distance cut off Seclusion A few passers by drawn in upon themselves Hurry from one place to another Winds of the white poppy there is no escape An interminable talking talking Talking it has happened before Backward backward backward  THURSDAY  I have had my dream like others And it has come to nothing so that   William Carlos Williams  I remain now carelessly With feet planted on the ground And look up at the sky Feeling my clothes about me The weight of my body in my shoes The rim of my hat air passing in and out At my nose and decide to dream no more  MAN IN A ROOM  Here no woman nor man besides Nor child nor dog nor bird nor wasp Nor ditch pool nor green thing Color of flower Blood bright berry none nor flame rust On leaf nor pink gall sting on stem nor  Staring stone Ay de mil No hawthorn s white thorn tree here nor lawn Of buttercups nor any counterpart  Bed book backs walls floor Flat pictures desk clothes box litter Of paper scrawls So sit I here So stand so walk about Beside The flower white tree not so lonely I Torn petals dew wet blotched yellow my bare instep  William Carlos Williams   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  AND FORBID THEM NOT  Sentry at the Front Halt Who goes there A Little Ghost It is only I kind sir you must let me through  Sentry Little white thing stop Where do you come from These are the lines of the allied armies  Little Ghost Sir I m the ghost of a dream That the Prussians have murdered Once my robe was so pure soft shining Once I lived in a deep old forest Once they fed me with love and with music Now I must go to a far new country I and these others my little white sisters Strange new soldier give me the pass word Kind sir let us through  Sentry God but this war is a queer war Look at em starved white ghosties Waitin for me to pass em Beyond our lines Me I m hard headed practical I never had any traffic with dreams Why the world s turned dippy Halt I say  Numberless Little Ghosts trying to pass him wailing softly We are the ghosts of dreams   Louise Morey Bowman  That the Prussians have murdered Now we must go to a far new country Strange new soldier give us the password Kind sir let us through  Sentry How white and shinin their odd wee faces Well then it s Christ can ye say it ghosties  All the Little Ghosts together joyously Now we can search for our far new country Christ is the password the soldier gives us Thank you thank you kind sir  They flock swiftly past him their tattered filmy rags blow softly against him and now and then small skeleton hands reach out and touch him gently  Sentry Haven t ye one that would stay for a bit with me Now that I ve passed the whole lot of ye ghosties Wouldn t one stay with a dull lonely fellow Just for the company  First Little Ghost I will stay with you strange new soldier Where you guard the walls for the world  She grows suddenly tall and very beautiful with a shining robe and crown of stars All the other Little Ghosts calling joyfully and softly from far away behind the lines W e are the ghosts of dreams That the Prussians have murdered Forbid us not for we have the password Christ  Louise Morey Bowman   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WITH THE A E F  ANTE PROELIUM  In the clairvoyance of a midnight waking I took an inventory of Myself A little knowledge on a dusty shelf  A few good deeds Fragile Beware of Breaking  A light heart fissured by no hours of aching Scraps of old songs fragments of childish fears And blowing memories of unlit years  And litter of achievements in the making  And this I said is all I have to give In the extremity of all mankind I give it gladly for I do not find  It hard that this agglomerate should not live The only thing I said about being dead The hard part is I have three friends I said  BEFORE MY FIRE IN A FRENCH VILLAGE  Words and faces and jests and dreams all come to me again When I give my memory leave to play but what I see most plain Is the little towns that loll in the sun and shiver and crouch in the rain   Morris Bishop  The towns of my youth come crowding and tumbling they will not wait for my thought Varna Slaterville Danby Ransome Mesnil Butte La Motte The towns where I went searching and troubled not knowing what I sought  The towns that I saw with a young man s eyes Grafton  Half moon Bay Canutillo Whitewater Bolton Bolinas Monterey The sun was bright upon those towns the day I went away  Now I have found a kind of peace and long hours to beguile With thinking of the roads I ve trod for many a dusty mile And the little wayside towns where I have rested for a  while  LE PÈRE SECRET  He was a wise old man the color of earth From long upturning the earth his back was bent He told me how the wine was bad in the spring How the spring turned it moody and turbulent  He tapped his earthy finger on the glass The spring he said the spring runs into the soil And warms the vine clipped to the very blood To bring forth buds with agony and toil   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Not easily as the profuse wild vines do Only a few great buds on a quaking vine And in the caves the old wines suffer too And sour and turbulent is the spring time wine  O horny old man intimate with the earth Will you not tell me yet another thing What is the vine to which my hot blood yearns Bitter and turbulent suffering with the spring  THE PIKER  Youth is for madness youth is for dreams and visions Youth is for earnest folly and monstrous play So say the sages so say the wise old warriors And so do also the twitch lipped satyrs say  Youth is a thoughtless laugh in a house of mourning A burst of sun on a chill rain sodden day So say the gaunt faced priests and the hooded sophists So also the sidelong beckoning satyrs say  Youth is a rose to be plucked and crushed to the nostrils For in an hour it is utterly blown away So say the minstrels so say the wistful ancients So too the unclean satyrs say  Morris Bishop   SECRECY  Down the hushed corridors of your dim soul Lonely I go and yearning pause by each closed door They stand so blind indifferent while no sound No breath escapes to tell me of your more  Your less immensities or nothingness But there is one apart close barred and rusted in Shrouded by years your hand has never moved  To open Have you heaven in there or sin  From all the other secrecies in you Despairing I return to this and weep and lean   Here terror of your hiding burns like fire  The doubt of what will be and what has been  G O Warren  PINK BLOSSOMS  Pink blossoms blow against a blue spring sky Why must these blossoms die  The songs of birds are pain which once were sweet  Was ever life complete  Marion Ethel Hamilton   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  GRANDMOTHER  How can I wordless make you understand When you so gently stroke my withered hand And ask me if I like my tea And if the long night rested me  O girl my body not my heart is dead Tell me oh tell me what your lover said  Tell how the moonlight on the garden lay  And what is the red flower you wear today I knew it once the memory is dead Tell me oh tell me what your lover said  WORLD LULLABY  My cryin baby of a World I ve left behind today I would na mither it for a  The red jew ls of Cathay  For I am breasted to the moors And skirted for

This time his argument American Ideals of Poetry he calls it forms the preface to his new book of delicately wrought poems and songs and sonnets entitled Colors of Life Alfred A Knopf In this thirty page article he sums up his case the case of a man whose lingering conservatism chased out of other departments of his mind finds a last refuge in art  Why not admit that Max Eastman is one of the most vivid and exuberant of human souls an ardent creature who works as he lives with passion convinced that he would not cringe before the white light of truth The truth he finds it in the old pagan clarity uniting across the Christian centuries with the pitiless searching breath of modern science to bear away speculative fogs and aristocratic snobberies and humilities of faith Like Rupert Brooke he gives his ardor to a cause and would die for it in glamorous ecstasy if need were And again like Brooke he sees the figure of Beauty not quite lithe and nude as Blake saw it or let us venture to say as H D sees it today but decorously draped in the sheerest and most softly colored of veils silken chiffons that fall almost without effort into rhythmic folds into wistful modern reminders of the austere Greek line  But in presenting the fine brief sonnets and other lyrics   A Radical conservative  which are the result of his prayerful communings with Beauty he is not sure enough of them to offer them without preliminary theory without a plea His plea takes the form of a contrast between Whitman and Poe and an indictment of free verse as necessarily unrespectful of the line and therefore unstructural and formless He quotes from Whitman s proud invitation to the poets of the future that assertion that there is something inevitably comic in rhyme and that the truest and greatest poetry while subtly and necessarily always rhythmic and distinguishable easily enough can never again in the English language be expressed in arbitrary and rhyming metre and over against this he sets certain icy admonitions from Poe s Philosophy of Composition which he thinks assert that poet s preoccupation with verbal melody and his point that beauty is the sole legitimate province of the poem And Mr Eastman adds The details of this difference are fascinating but the generalization of it is what will illumine the modern problems about poetry  Well in Mr Eastman s generalization one gets indeed his point of view the clever argument of a special pleader but not much illumination He says The opposition of these two characters and attitudes is complete when in fact however the personal characters of Poe and Whitman may be in contrast their aesthetic principles are far from irreconcilable Does Mr Eastman seriously ascribe to Whitman a grand contempt for beauty or think that Poe in asserting beauty is the sole legitimate province of the poem means by beauty merely verbal melody indeed a metri   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  cally restricted verbal melody at that and does not include spiritual motive Does Mr Eastman mean to imply that iambic metrics rhyme the pentameter line or any other familiar instruments of English poetry are anything but tools and aids are in themselves structure Does he find more form much abused word more sheerly structural modelling in The Raven than in that glorious elegy When lilacs last in the door yard bloomed even though the former poem is in the school let us say of Houdon and the latter in that of Rodin  To come down to our own immediate moment does Mr Eastman find more form a more severely modelled classic shape in Witter Bynner s fine Celia lyrics or his own purely carved love sonnets in this volume than in Carl Sandburg s Lost or The Great Hunt H D s Oread or The Shrine Aldington s Choricos Amy Lowell s Venus Tran siens or Ezra Pound s Dance Figure and certain other lyrics Mr Eastman may prefer strictly measured iambics to free verse no one will deny him a right to his preference but when he tries to ascribe to these all the architectonics of the poetic art he is treading on shoals and quicksands  Mr Eastman complains that the line divisions of free verse are arbitrary that if they were once scrambled together in any poem even the author could hardly unscramble them But may one ask him what that alleged fact has to do with the case If this scrambling makes prose of any piece then it was always prose as indeed much verse is both bond and free Would Hamlet s soliloquy or Antony s death speech be   A Radical conservative  any the less poetry if written out as prose or if scrambled into irregular lines Is Lincoln s Gettysburg speech any the less essentially poetry in rhythm structure and spiritual motive because it happens to be printed without line divisions  If the eye test shatters Mr Eastman s arguments the ear test is similarly destructive He says if two or three of the most free and subtle of the vers librists were to read one of their favorite passages into the ear of an instrument it is safe to assert that there would be less identity in the actual pulsations recorded than if the same two or three were reading a passage of highly wrought English prose Possibly but if these same two or three were to read Paradise Lost or the Ode to the West Wind or any other poem of subtle or sweeping cadences there would be still less identity Such investigations as Dr Patterson s sensibly approved by Mr Eastman and thoughtlessly disapproved in a recent Dial by John Gould Fletcher will turn the pitiless light of science upon the empiricism of prosody and upon the unrhythmic misinterpretations of poetry which most readers are guilty of A life time of theatre going including more Shakespeare and other poet playwrights than may be found on the stage today has convinced me that ninety nine per cent of actors deliberately hash poetic lines into prose so that even Mr Eastman could hardly unscramble them And few poets whatever their rhythmic instinct may be trusted to read their own poems  In short Mr Eastman s argument will not hold water It   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  is a wistful effort to give the sanctity of unalterable law to merely individual theories and preferences Mr Eastman wants poetry as a refuge from life s passion and turmoil and he uses the great name of Poe as his authority Poe to whom a poem was an objective thing Poe who would take sounds and melodies of words almost actually into his hands and carve and model them until he had formed a beautiful vessel Ah but Poe s passion was beauty especially beauty as it is found in poetry whereas Mr Eastman s passion is life and its enhancement through social revolution In politics and social ethics he is a radical but shocked conservatism must take refuge in some sacred corner of one s being and in his case the muse presides there with draped and decorous dignity H M  A GOLD STAR FOR GLADYS CROMWELL  Died January 19th I9I9  The toll of our heroic soldier dead does not complete the list of those who have given their lives in the cause of liberty The friends and fellow artists of Gladys Cromwell may well display in her honor the service star of gold tempering their grief for her untimely death with the thought of her service even as though she had fallen in battle  Many sensitive youths unnerved by the agonies of war have been removed from the horrid bitter game by the nervous disability known as shell shock The self drowning of the twin sisters Gladys and Dorothea Cromwell should   A Gold Star for Gladys Cromwell  not be called suicide but the tragic result of over strain due to months of contact with the dark realities of war Delicately reared protected always from the common rough andtumble of life they must have over estimated their strength and power of resistance when they volunteered as canteen workers and went to France a year ago  We do not know the exact history of their service beyond the fact that for some weeks or months they were working near the Front No doubt they came into immediate contact with wounds and death with the devastation of homes and the pathetic misery of refugees For a creature so keenly sensitive as Gladys Cromwell s poetry shows her to have been the experience was too keen too poignant Over wrought nerves led her toward melancholia a pathological condition which time would have remedied but which her inexperience did not recognize That tragic leap into dark waters was in all probability the result of illness contracted in service  Thus her fellow poets of America are entitled to inscribe the name of Gladys Cromwell on their honor roll just under those of Alan Seeger Joyce Kilmer and the other poet heroes who died in battle Like them she was not afraid of death even though like them she felt to the finest fibres of her being the exquisite beauty of life  Her expression of this beauty was in her best verse of a sculpturesque austerity There was folded power in those Songs of the Dust which appeared in POETRY exactly a year ago a severe modelling of spiritual fabric into rhythmic form For these poems Mr Braithwaite in his annual Boston   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Transcript review placed Miss Cromwell s name with one  other at the head of his list for the year 1918 Their marble  beauty recording a sure advance over the earlier work in her  volume Gates of Utterance may well make her friends and  fellow craftsmen both proud and sorrowful proud of her  high service to the art and the cause of human liberty and  sorrowful that too eager death has stiffened her limbs in  youth and sealed her lips  She waves us a fine farewell in her poem The Mould  No doubt this active will So bravely steeped in sun This will has vanquished Death And foiled oblivion  But this indifferent clay This fine experienced hand So quiet and these thoughts That all unfinished stand  Feel death as though it were A shadowy caress And win and wear a frail Archaic wistfulness  H M  NOTE While the above was in proof the writer met Miss Anna Ryan whose valuable service in the Smith College Relief Unit is a matter of record Miss Ryan said The Cromwell sisters were working devotedly at Chalons sur Marne for weeks while I was there a particularly trying post as the town was then under bombardment from earth or air almost every day and from there they went directly to another post of duty at Verdun Although even robust soldiers must be relieved after six weeks at the Front no one seems to have ordered these girls to take a rest At the end they were undoubtedly suffering from what the French call cafard a condition of abysmal depression resulting from nerve exhaustion Unquestionably they deserve to be honored among those who have died for their country and the cause   REVIEWS  A DOUGHBOY ANTHOLOGY  Yanks A Book of A E F Verse Published in France by  The Stars and Stripes  No other book has stirred me so much as Yanks since The Spoon River Anthology It is a collection of poems from Stars and Stripes the doughboy paper published in France and your soldier boy should send you one While this book has by no means the artistic weight and finish of Spoon River it is full of suggestion and the sense of Tomorrow From end to end it records the moods of the private soldier and absolutely refuses to be heroic though some of the amateur versifiers are now dead on the field The whole book has an atmosphere of improvisation yet one third of the poems show a reasonable economy of language Yeats said rhetoric is heard poetry overheard Almost this whole book is overheard  It is written in the

clean eighteen year old boy with a gigantic power suddenly placed in his hands I have known college freshmen to be just this funny and fine and poetical when they were least aware of it  The book is a history of war for any man Though at first it has the casual aspect of an old shoe an old hat yet the cheapest poem has at least one line of beauty unawares But the whole book is far more precious than any one poem Rereading it the fourth time it grows and clarifies It is indeed news from the front It finally takes on the colossal simplicity of a gigantic dam of spring water and I prophesy for the work an enormous popularity  While we are reading it it delivers us from Whitman thank God If you really want AMERICAN poetry I suggest that you forget Whitman a moment and read Yanks It contains an invisible writing which appears on the fourth reading and which was never in Whitman even on the tenth reading  Here are two poems complete and following them some lines and phrases and one

American People In order to appreciate fully the challenge  of its seven lines one should know that Lola Ridge is Aus  tralian by birth She came to this country fourteen years  ago  Will you feast with me American people  But what have I that shall seem good to you  On my board are bitter apples  And honey served on thorns  And in my flagons fluid iron  Hot from the crucibles  How shall such fare entice you  Indeed this small book holds little which could entice  average American gentlefolk who are so content with con  ditions as they are that they never disturb themselves as to  their composition or de composition These conditions are   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  subjected to the most uncompromising excoriation I ve ever seen between two American bookboards through the twin media of conditions as they aren t and as they should be In other words Lola Ridge is a revolutionist She is a prototype of the artist rebels of Russia Germany and Austro Hungary who were the forerunners of the present regime over there men like Dostoievsky Gorky Moussorgsky Beethoven Heine Hauptmann Schnitzler I don t mean that Lola Ridge is that horrific creature a masquerading propagandist She is first and always an artist In trumpeting for freedom going to blows for it housing it in an art form one unconsciously destroys its opposite Love destroys hate and convention libertarians demi gods artists shackling traditions form formalism Beethoven hammered out nine symphonies at least five of which were revolutionary Back in Waterloo time he was denounced as a noisy lunatic a savage smashing old forms On the contrary he created Beethoven without destroying Mozart for Mozart was himself a revolutionary Without hinting at comparison I d like to predict that Lola Ridge will be charged with lunacy incendiarism nihilism by the average American who reads her book The everlasting minority will proclaim her another free singer another creator of free form  The Ghetto is a magnificent pageant of the Jewish race in nine chapters In this single work the poet surpasses the dramatist David Pinski who is in my opinion easily the leading figure among the Jews themselves over here and perhaps the foremost writer for the theatre regardless of race   A Poet in Arms  or language Her uncanny range of knowledge of the Jew and her realistic presentation of his lives are heightened and made plastic by the magic of the detached imagination which hovers always a little above realism and formulates its relative compositional values Philosophically she is more robust than Pinski In the final analysis she doesn t see the Jew as a tragic type  Bartering changing extorting  Dreaming debating aspiring  Astounding indestructible  Life of the Ghetto  Strong flux of life  Like a bitter wine  Out of the bloody stills of the world  Out of the Passion eternal  She sees the future of the race more clearly than the Jews themselves She prognosticates the Jew as one of the leaders in the new world and her vision is borne out by even a casual perusal of the present day names of men who are re moulding Europe For sheer passion deadly accuracy of versatile images beauty richness and incisiveness of epithet unfolding of adventures portraiture of emotion and thought pageantry of push carts the whole lifting falling stumbling mounting to a broad symphonic rhythm interrupted by occasional elfin scherzi well The Ghetto was felt by a saint who wasn t afraid to mix with the earth and recorded by a devil who must inevitably return to heaven Perhaps Lola Ridge is only another Babushka released from exile to a place of leadership among her contemporaries   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  There are a number of long poems the best being Flotsam Faces The Song of Iron Frank Little at Calvary The Everlasting Return and The Edge Poe s sentimental tirade against the long poem is refuted here There s only room for a few lines from Flotsam but they give you the plot of the poem and a reminiscence of a Rembrandt etching  This old man s head Has found a woman s shoulder The wind juggles with her shawl That flaps about them like a sail And splashes her red faded hair Over the salt stubble of his chin A light foam is on his lips As though dreams surged in him  Breaking and ebbing away And the bare boughs shuffle above him And the twigs rattle like dice She diffused like a broken beetle Sprawls without grace Her face gray as asphalt Her jaws sagging as on loosened hinges Shadows ply about her mouth Nimble shadows out of the jigging tree That dances above her its dance of dry bones  The Song of Iron is an exhortation to labor swinging to the rhythm of a paean and a warning to Dictators late Lords of the Iron It recalls the exultation of the last movement of Beethoven s dance symphony the Seventh Underneath the hammering rhythm as relentless as a machine and as primitively nude as the animal surges the call of mate to mate It is my favorite poem in the book Frank Little at Calvary is more than a fictitious rendering of the last moments of the I W W leader and suggests the part his execution may play in the future The Edge   And I lay quietly on the drawn knees of the mountain staring into the abyss  is an ecstatic nature lyric closing on the serene cadence  And I too got up stiffly from the earth And held my heart up like a cup  In some of her short poems Lola Ridge participates in the crystallization of concentrated strength achieved by Emily Dickinson Adelaide Crapsey and H D There are particularly three in seven lines Debris Spires and Palestine which hark back in form and spirit to the seven line dedication This is Débris  I love those spirits That men stand off and point at Or shudder and hood up their souls Those ruined ones Where Liberty has lodged an hour And passed like flame Bursting asunder the too small house  And this is Palestine  Old plant of Asia Mutilated vine Holding earth s leaping sap In every stem and shoot That lopped off sprouts again Why should you seek a plateau walled about Whose garden is the world  In these reconstructive days liberty is being re defined  nationalism is approximating internationalism the personal  is trying to approach the impersonal For myself I must  say that I cannot feel that liberty internationalism and the  impersonal will ever be realized But for every attempt  made however unsuccessful of accomplishment all the blood   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  drops in me are grateful and sing hosannas They respond to Lola Ridge Alfred Kreymborg  TWO BOOKS BY FLETCHER  Japanese Prints by John Gould Fletcher Four Seas Co The Tree of Life by John Gould Fletcher Chatto amp  Windus London  The reader who makes his first acquaintance with Mr Fletcher s work through these two volumes will have a very unfair impression of the author s real worth for these in no sense compare with his best work as it is revealed in Irradiations Sand and Spray or in Goblins and Pagodas The brevity of the small poems in Japanese Prints and possibly their subject matter are the only points of similarity with Japanese poetry they are decorative in phrasing but perhaps because of this very decorative element they seem to escape that union of spiritual delicacy and profundity which is characteristic of even the slightest Japanese verse We as westerners are too prone to overlook the underlying humanism of Japanese or Oriental art and to get only the outward appearance Of course the outward mask is in itself wonderful and decorative in truth but this is not all and when one in turn undertakes to create another mask one must not forget that there should be a face underneath it Otherwise the mask will be empty Masks that only imitate other masks eventually become lifeless  That is I think why these small poems by Mr Fletcher do not move us either as art or life They appeal rather   Two Books by Fletcher  as a sort of literary bric à brac This is perhaps too harsh for their intention which is relatively slight Nevertheless unless interpretation really adds something it is better discarded and these poems which continually suggest not the author but the double art from which they are derived do not after all do justice to the original For Japanese poetry however brief is not slight and it does not pose or attitudinize as these poems often seem to do If forgetting Japanese prints and Japanese tankas Mr Fletcher had written a series of small poems independently of Japanese models the spirit one believes would have been much closer to that of Japanese poetry  The Tree of Life represents a completely different phase of art from that exemplified in Japanese Prints In these love poems emotion has completely run away with the author It is impossible to retain any definite impression of the book or of single poems only a confused vague tangle of sifting moods and images none with enough contour to stay fixed even for a moment The book is a welter of emotion but it remains chaotic and without form All poets have lapses Only a comparatively small proportion of the work of the biggest men is retained and treasured So there is no reason to be too despairing because these two books do not come up to Mr Fletcher s already achieved level But any man who has the Ghosts of an Old House the Blue Symphony and some of the poems in Irradiations to his credit need not expect us to be satisfied with anything less A CH   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PALE COLORS  Minna and Myself by Maxwell Bodenheim Pagan Pub  lishing Co New York  This is not a negligible book You may like it or you may not but you will read it and then find that you have many things to say reasons for having liked and possibly even enjoyed Bodenheim and his peculiar visionary word forms or reasons for having felt irritated and displeased by his eccentricities  For simplicity s sake one may record a contrast or two For instance whereas his aesthetic color sense is clear his aesthetic sound sense is faulty and although he takes his words with a rare and delicate sense of their meaning he is apparently unconscious or uncaring of their oftentimes lumpy jerky ugliness of sound I think it is a matter of unfortunate consonants breaking too harshly into an otherwise harmonious enough tonal silhouette Such a line as Picking up forgotten hints of its heart is a strange amalgamation of jumps also this  The sea is pregnant with gracious discords That falteringly shroud the sleep rhythmed breasts of winds  Even at a Thanksgiving feast one does not wish for too thick a slice of turkey on one s plate On the other hand a line full of beauty but with an uncertain content is Upon an arched sarcophagus of pain  All through the book one is conscious of a strong technique not yet quite fully mastered a technique that does surprising things with the poet For instance although he shows   Pale Colors  in many poems a real appreciation of the idea of silence  he seems unable because of his multitudinous technique to  avail himself of its curious values A little silence some  where in this line would have been truly golden  Shaking nights noons tame and dust quiet and wind broken days  Th e poems To Minna contain many obvious and hidden  beauties although they seem hardly the kind of things to be  inspired by a young girl of eighteen suggesting always a  more mature personality Of the Myself portion of the book  Death is very beautiful and both soft and sharp  I shall walk down the road I shall turn and feel upon my feet The kisses of Death like scented rain For Death is a black slave with little silver birds Perched in a sleeping wreath upon his head He will tell me his voice like jewels Dropped into a satin bag How he has tip toed after me down the road His heart made a dark whirlpool with longing for me Then he will graze me with his hands And I shall be one of the sleeping silver birds Between the cold waves of his hair as he tip toes on  And another Death has a fine beginning  A fan of smoke in the long green white revery of the sky Slowly curls apart So shall we rise and widen out in the silence of air  Th e last lines of Poet Vagabond Grown Old may also be  quoted  But now I walk on alone And only after watching many evenings Do I dance a bit with dying wisps of moonlight To persuade myself that I am young   POETRY A Magazine of V erse  The two plays at the end of the book one written in collaboration with Ben Hecht are less interesting surely less Bodenheim than the short poems Bodenheim knows however what he means when he writes and this colossal virtue can hardly be over praised And whether you read to praise or blame you had better read him  I feel Greenwich Village in the repeated use of the word pale The pallor of Greenwich Village is a pallor too profound for light discussion but my respect for Bodenheim and his finer work is such that I would object less to these pale flowers these pale wearinesses pale purple lanterns and pale purple breaths if I felt them to be not Greenwich Village but Bodenheim himself He may find it being such a color lover a more stimulating atmosphere than that of his earlier dwelling place but if a poet must have a favorite cliché of the two it is far better to be stamped with something like the big common clichés of Chicago or even New York in the larger sense of course than with the little pale purple ones of Greenwich Village  Helen Birch  SWINBURNE S BABY POEMS  The Springtide of Life Poems of Childhood by Algernon  Charles Swinburne with a preface by Edmund Gosse  Illustrated by Arthur Rackham William Heinemann  London  Those who have loved Swinburne s love of babyhood will find his testimony gathered together at last and adorned by   Swinburne s Baby Poems  Arthur Rackham with pretty if rather conventional drawings in color and less adequate pen and ink decorations  Th e book gives one a chance to review fading impressions for none of Swinburne s baby poems absolutely

butterfly birth full grown and winged  The subject tempted the poet to a flowery interweaving of rhymes in forms old and new We have the series of Cradle Songs rhyming in triplets thus  Baby baby bright Sleep can steal from sight Little of your light Soft as fire in dew  Still the life in you Lights your slumber through  Four white eyelids keep Fast the seal of sleep Deep as love is deep  Yet though closed it lies Love behind them spies Heaven in two blue eyes  There are of course many roundels the charming ones on a baby s feet his hands his eyes his First Footsteps But no amount of graceful manipulation can quite make us forget the essential artificiality of this form One likes better the interweaving of flowery rhymes in A Baby s Epitaph here is one stanza  April made me Winter laid me here away asleep   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Bright as Maytime was my daytime night is soft and deep Though the morrow bring forth sorrow well are ye that weep  And this stanza form from In a Garden has an exqui  sitely appropriate grace and lightness  Baby see the flowers  Baby sees  Fairer things than these  Fairer though they be than dreams of ours  One may suggest the flavor but not the richness of  Swinburne s prodigality in this garden of babyhood the  reader must look for himself The book closes with that  thirty poem lament for a house without children A Dark  Month poems which are spun out too thin quite to deserve  Mr Gosse s adjective impassioned H M  CORRESPONDENCE  SERVING IN THE A E F  The following letter from one of this month s contributors  a First Lieutenant in the 330th Infantry is dated Paris  Jan 8th 1919  DEAR POETRY I am revelling in your bunch of back numbers as in a first taste of chocolate after months deprived of luxuries  I finally managed to give up being a liaison officer a piffling kind of job I got myself transferred to Aeroplane Observation which next to being a pilot is the nearest approach to deification possible to man And just as I was about to begin my flying Peace broke out and I came down to earth with a crash I was thrown into a Classification Camp and thence into the Railroad Transportation Service since I know as much about Railroad Transportation as I do about the weaning of infants Just at present I am R T O at Chartres in command of one enlisted man and with a rank be   Serving in the A E F  tween the Baggage man and the Assistant Station master It sometimes seems to me curious that when I order some seventy hard bit veterans into a freight car where they are to live during a two or three day trip they obey me without question it seems funny that they don t say Where were you when we were in the Argonne and refuse to ride in anything but first class coaches  It is a pleasant kind of life though the life of a railroad station is changeful and vivid did you ever read Zola s La Bête Humaine And it gives me a thrill to wave my hand to the engineer and see a gigantic locomotive go heaving and spitting out of the station as if I had kicked it out There s not much sense in grumbling because I haven t had a bloody job in the war because nobody would believe me anyhow  Is there anything in French you want Most modern French poetry is mannered and bloodless I think but I gather that Professor Pound does not Morris Bishop  NOTES  Mr Ezra Pound s free translation of a series of Latin poems by Propertius of which we offer numbers I II III and VI will be included in his new book to be published in May or June in London It is understood that Mr Pound will soon issue in the same capital the

additions there Most of them are from the third book the first as here given being made up of the first and second of the original The one numbered IV is mainly based on the thirteenth poem of bock

OF THIS WORK  Read also what a soldier in France thinks of it  have had very little to read since arriving in this country yet I have needed reading more than ever before Perhaps that is one reason why the poems in this book have so deeply entered my consciousness Some of them were read in a ridiculously lighted cave to the other fellows in my section Others I read to two boys in a hospital two boys almost dying of homesickness Some of them I saved just for myself and dared not read them aloud lest I might be thought an hysterical soldier Others like the Choricos of Aldington have shuddered with me along night roads and through their bold beauty have saved me from terror at moments when one of the great shocks the explosion of an enemy shell the sudden presence of pain or awful agony the nearness of death fell without preface upon me  TH E NEW POETRY AN ANTHOLOGY  Edited by Harriet Monroe and Alice Corbin Henderson First published Feb 1917 and already in its sixth edition  Price 1 75
