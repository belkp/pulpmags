Else von Freytag Loringhovenphotograph by Man RayTHE LITTLE REVIEW Art and the Law by jh THE heavy farce and sad futility of trying a creative work in a court of law appalls meWas there ever a judge qualified to judge even the simplest psychic outburstHow then a work of ArtHas any man not a nincompoop ever been heard by a jury of his peersIn a physical world laws have been made to preserve physical orderLaws cannot reachnor have power overany other realmArt is and always has been the supreme OrderBecause of this it is the only activity of man that has an eternal qualityWorks of Art are the only permanent sign that man has existedWhat legal genius to bring Law against OrderThe society for which MrSumner is agentI am toldwas founded to protect the public from corruptionWhen asked what publicits defenders spring to the rock on which America was founded the cream puff of sentimentalityand answer chivalrouslyOur young girls So the mind of the young girl rules this countryIn it rests the safetyprogress and lustre of a nationOne might have guessed itbut why is she given such representativesI recall a photograph of the United States Senatorsa galaxy 6 of noble manhood that could only have been assembled from far flung country stores where it had spat and gossiped and stolen prunesThe present case is rather ironicalWe are being prosecuted for printing the thoughts in a young girl s mindHer thoughts and actions and the meditations which they produced in the mind of the sensitive MrBloomIf the young girl corruptscan she also be corruptedMrJoyce s young girl is an innocentsimplechildish girl who tends children she hasn t had the advantage of the dancescabaretsmotor trips open to the young girls of this more pure and free countryIf there is anything I really fear it is the mind of the young girlI do not understand ObscenityI have never studied it nor had itbut I know that it must be a terrible and peculiar menace to the United StatesI know that there is an expensive department maintained in Washington with a chief and fifty assistants to prevent its spread and in and for New York we have the Sumner vigilantiTo a mind somewhat used to life MrJoyce s chapter seems to be a record of the simplestmost unpreventablemost unfocused sex thoughts possible in a rightly constructedunashamed human beingMrJoyce is not teaching early Egyptian perversions nor inventing new onesGirls lean back everywhereshowing lace and silk stockings wear low cut sleeveless gownsbreathless bathing suits men think thoughts and have emotions about these things everywhereseldom as delicately and imaginatively as MrBloom and no one is corruptedCan merely reading about the thoughts he thinks corrupt a man when his thoughts do notAll power to the artistbut this is not his functionIt was the poetthe artistwho discovered lovecreated the lovermade sex everything that it is beyond a functionIt is the MrSumners who have made it an obscenityIt is a little too obvious to discusthe inevitable result of damming up a force as unholy and terrific as the reproductive force with nothing more powerful than silenceblack looksand censureThe Little Review 7Our young girlsgrow up conscious of being possessedas by a devilwith some urge which they are told is shamefuldangerous and obsceneThey try to bepurewith no other incantations than a fewobstetric mutterings MrSumner seems a decent enough chap serious and colourless and worn as if he had spent his life resenting the emotionsA 100 per centAmerican who believes that denialresentment and silence about all things pertaining to sex produce uprightnessOnly in a nation ignorant of the power of Art insensitive and unambitious to the need and appreciation of Art could such habit of mind obtainArt is the only thing that produces lifeextends lifeI am speaking beyond physically or mentallyA people without the experience of the Art influence can bring forth nothing but a humanity that bears the stamp of a loveless raceFacsimile women and stereotyped mena humanity without distinction or designindicating no more the creative touch than if they were assembled partsA beautiful Russian woman said to me recently How dangerous and horrible to fall in love with an American manOne could never tell which one it was they are all the same There are still those people who are not outraged by the mention of natural facts who will askwhat is the necessity to discuss them But that is not a question to ask about a work of ArtThe only question relevant at all toUlyssesis Is it a work of ArtThe men best capable of judging have pronounced it a work of the first rankAnyone with a brain would hesitate to question the necessity in an artist to createor his ability to choose the right subject matterAnyone who has readExilesThe Portrait andUlyssesfrom the beginningcould not rush in with talk of obscenityNo man has been more crucified on his sensibilities than James Joyce An Obvious Statementfor the millionth timeby Margaret Anderson MRSUMNER is a representative intelligenceI will say later what value I put upon therepresentativea serioussincere manvery much interested in proving his conviction that James Joyce is filthy to read and contaminating to those who read himMy first point is that MrSumner is operating in realms in which it can be proved that he cannot function intelligentlylegitimatelyor with any relation to the question which should be up for discussion in the courtThat question is the relation of the artist the great writerto the publicFirstthe artist has no responsibility to the public whateverbut the public should be conscious of its responsibility to himbeing mysteriously and eternally in his debtSecondthe position of the great artist is impregnableYou can no more destroy him than you can create himYou can no more limit his expressionpatronizingly suggest that his genius present itself in channels personally pleasing to youthan you can eat the starsI should begin myquite unnecessary defense of James Joyce with this statementI know practically everything that will be The Little Review said in courtboth by the prosecution and the defenseI disagree with practically everything that will be said by bothI do not admit that the issue is debatableI state clearly that thequite unnecessary defense of beauty is the only issue involvedJames Joyce has never writen anythingand will never be able to write anythingthat is not beautifulSo that we come to the question of beauty in the Art sensethat isto the science of aestheticsthe touchstone which establishes whether any given piece of writingpaintingmusicsculptureis a work of Art or merely an effort in that direction by a man whohowever he may wish or workhas not been born an artistYou will say this brings us to an impassethat we now arrive at that point where two autocracies of opinion can be establishedone which saysThis is Artand the other which saysIt is not And you will tell me that one is quite as likely to be right as the otherand that therefore every man is thrown back upon his personal taste as a criterionetcI answerAutocracyIt is entirely a matter of autocracy of opinionAnd the autocracy that mattersthat can prove itselfas against that which cannotis the only thing we are concerned with in this discussionIt is the only thing to be considered in any Art discussionbut the last that ever is consideredWhy is thisBecause it never occurs to the MrSumners of the world that Art is a highly specialized activity to which they must bring something beyond mere knowledgeThey are content to approach even without knowledgeIf MrSumner were asked to judge pearlsfor instancehe wouldn t dream of expressing an opinion unless he really knew how a good pearl must feel to the touchhow it must weighwhat color it must beIf he were asked to buy a string of corals for a connoisseur he wouldn t undertake the commission unless he knew that Japanese corals are morebeautifulthan Italian coralsand that he couldn t buy an acceptable string for less than3 000In shortunless he were a connoisseur he wouldn t be doing these thingsIn Artand this is the crux of the whole businessone must 10 The Little Review judge with a touchstone beyond even the capacity of the connoisseurIt is not the tastethe judgment of connoisseurs that has established what are the great works of Art in the worldIt is the perception of the great artists themselvesthe judgment of the mastersIn begininng to talk of this kind of perceptionof who are the mastersit is necessary to begin with the fundamentals of aestheticsIn aesthetics it can be established Firstthat to a work of Art you must bring aesthetic judgmentnot moralpersonalnor even technical judgmentIt is not the human feelings that produce this kind of judgmentIt is a capacity for art emotionas distinguished from human emotionthat produces itSecondthat only certain kinds of people are capable of art emotionaesthetic emotion They are the artist himself and the critic whose capacity for appreciation proves itself by an equal capacity to createIn an old race of peoplelike the Hindooswhere the artist is protected from the assault of the philistine by as definite a caste system as exists in all other phases of Hindu lifethe kind of thing that will happen to us in a United States court could not take placeThat civilization is founded on the autocratic recognition of certain valuesthe artist as the highest manifestation of lifethe critic who recognizes him the philosopher who explains himAn autocracy the recognition of the valuable as against the less valuableis the only sound basis for lifeAnything else is shamefulAnything else means that the exceptional people must suffer with the average peoplefrom the average peopleThis is the ethics of the western worldNearly everyone believes this to be inevitable even desirableMrSumner believes itHe has quoted to me a remark of Victor Hugo s to the effect that personal freedom extends The Little Review 11 just to that point where it does not interfere with the personal freedom of anotherI have said to himMrSumnerthat is an inepetitudeThere is no thinking in that kind of remark I don t know just where Victor Hugo makes this banal and curiously unthoughtful statementPerhaps he makes it only in connection with physical freedom in which case it is not entirely senselessBut when a good mind begins to reflect on the subject of the more subtle freedomswhat does it sayFirst of allthat there is no such thing as freedomThere is only interdependenceAnd of the little freedoms that can be attained or respectedin this great maize of the interdependence of all lifelet us respect those of the superior people rather than of the inferior peopleIt is far more important that a great artist s freedom to write as he pleases be respected than that MrSumner s freedom to suppress what he does not know to be a work of Art be respectdWhy is there no such autocracy in this countrywhy is there no caste feeling which makes a man humble before what he does not understand before what he does not know that he does not knowrather than confident that he has some special capacity to deal with itIt is because in America every human beingno matter what his traininghis businesshis qualificationsmakes some mysterious identification of himself with the artistHe saysI love the better things of lifeI go to concerts and art galleriesI couldn t live without these thingsand that is supposed to endow him with some creative participationI can t tell you how many people have said to meI don t know anything about ArtI couldn t write a poem or compose a piece of music to save my lifebut I know what I likeI have a very good critical senseand I feel the way the artist does They mean that they eat Artlive on itgo to hear good music in order to drown in the emotions it gives themIn Americawhere the emotional life has been allowed so few direct outletsthis is what happens everywhereBut if this is the way the majority of humanity actsit is not the way the artist actsAnd the thing that will puzzle me to the end of time is this You can tell a man who knows a great deal about insurancefor instancethat he doesn t know enough mechanical engineering to build a bridgeand he doesn t feel insulted12 The Little Review But if you tell a plumberor an engineera business mana lawyera scholara club womana debutantethat they are not artistsnot creators in this special sensethey take it as the deepest insultOf courseI suppose this shouldn t exasperate meI should take it all as the deepest tribute a man can pay to that mysterious phenomenonthe artistwith whom he thus identifies his own highest instinctsWellI wouldn t be exasperated I could look upon it all as a rather charming foolishnessif it weren t for the prosecution of that human being whom all mankind in its best moments is trying to impersonateThis at least begins the argumentNext month I shall report all the blatant ineptitudes of the court proceedings and answer them simplyobviouslyand patientlyunless I shall have succumbed in the meantime to the general sense of devastating futility which is really the only good sense one can hope to preserve in these contentionsTo closeI shall quote some passages on the theory thatBeauty is a state from Ananda Coomaraswamy sDance of Siva published by the Sunwise TurnNew York The italics are my own It is very generally held that natural objects such as human beingsanimals or landscapesand artificial objects such as factoriestextiles or works of intentional artcan be classified as beautiful or uglyAnd yet no general principle of classification has ever been foundand that which seems to be beautiful to one is described as ugly to anotherTakefor examplethe human type every raceand to some extentevery individualhas an unique idealNor can we hope for a final agreementWe cannot expect the European to prefer the Mongolian featuresnor the Mongolian the EuropeanOf courseit is very easy for each to maintain the absolute value of his own taste and to speak of other types as uglyIn like manner the various sects maintain the absolute value of their own ethicsBut it is clear that such claims are nothing more than statements of prejuThe Little Review 13 dicefor who is to decide which racial ideal or which morality isbestIt is a little too easy to decide that our own is bestwe are at the most entitled to believe it the best for us It is the same with works of artDifferent artists are inspired by different objects what is attractive and stimulating to one is depressing and unattractive to anotherand the choice also varies from race to race and epoch to epochAs to the appreciation of such worksit is the same for men in general admire only such works as by education or temperament they are predisposed to admireTo enter into the spirt of an unfamiliar art demands a greater effort than most are wiling to makeThere are many who never yet felt the beauty of Egyptian sculpture or Chinese or Indian painting or musicThat they have the hardihood to deny their beautyhoweverproves nothing And yet there remain philosophers firmly convinced that an absolute BeautyrasaexistsIt is also widely held that the true criticrasikais able to decide which works of art are beautifulrasavantand which are notIt remains thento resolve the seeming contradictionsThis is only to be accomplished by the use of more exact terminologySo far I have spoken ofbeautywithout defining my meaningand have used one word to express a multiplicity of ideasBut we do not mean the same thing when we speak of a beautiful girl and a beautiful poem it will be still more obvious that we mean two different things if we speak of beautiful weather and a beautiful pictureIn point of factthe conception of beauty and the adjectivebeautifulbelong exclusively to aesthetic and should only be used in aesthetic judgmentWe seldom make any such judgments when we speak of natural objects as beautifulwe generally mean that such objects as we call beautiful are 14 The Little Review congenial to uspractically or ethicallyToo often we pretend to judge a work of art in the same waycalling it beautiful if it represents some form or activity of which we heartily approveor if it attracts us by the tenderness or gaiety of its colourthe sweetness of its sounds or the charm of its movementBut when we thus pass judgment on the dance in accordance with our sympathetic attitude toward the dancer s charm or skillor the meaning of the dancewe ought not to use the language of pure aestheticOnly when we judge a work of art aesthetically may we speak of the presence or absence of beautywe may call the work rasavant or otherwisebut when we judge it from the standpoint of activitypractical or ethicalwe ought to use a corresponding terminologycalling the picturesong or actorlovely that is to say lovableor otherwisethe actionnoble the colourbrilliant the gesturegraceful or otherwiseand so forthAnd it will be seen that in doing this we are not really judging the work of art as suchbut only the material and the separate parts of which it is madethe activities they representor the feelings they represent We should only speak of a work of art as good or bad with reference to its aesthetic quality only the subject and the material of the work are entangled in relativityIn other wordsto say that a work of art is more or less beautiful or rasavantis to define the extent to which it is a work of artrather than a mere illustrationHowever important the element of sympathetic magic in such a work may behowever important its practical applicationsit is not in these that its beauty consists What thenis Beautywhat is rasa what is this sole quality which the most dissimilar works of art possess in commonLet us recall the history of a work of artThere is 1 an aesthetic intuition on the part of the original artistthe poet or creatorthen2the internal expression of this intiution the true creation or vision of The Little Review 15 beauty 3the indication of this by external signslanguagefor the purpose of communicationthe technical activityand finally4the resulting stimulation of the critic or rasika to reproduction of the original intuitionor to some aproximation to it The source of the original intuition mayas we have seenbe any aspect of life whateverTo one creator the scales of a fish suggest a rhythmical designanother is moved by certain landscapesa third elects to speak of hovelsa fourth to sing of palacesa fifth may express the idea that all things are enlinkedenlaced and enamoured in terms of the General Danceor he may express the same idea equally vividly by saying thatnot a sparrow falls to the ground without our Father s knowledge Every artist discovers beauty and every critic finds it again when he tastes of the same experience through the medium of the external signsBut where is this beautyWe have seen that it cannot be said to exist in certain things and not in othersIt may then be claimed that beauty exists everywhereand this I do not denythough I prefer the clearer statement that it may be discovered anywhereIf it could be said to exist everywhere in a matrial and intrinsic sensewe could pursue it with our cameras and scalesafter the fashion of the experimental psychologistsbut if we did sowe should only achieve a certain acquaintance with average taste we should not discover a means of distinguishing forms that are beautiful from forms that are uglyBeauty can never thus be measuredfor it does not exist apart from the artist himselfand the rasika who enters into his experience The true criticrasikaperceives the beauty of which the artist has exhibited the signsIt is not necessary that the critic should appreciate the artist s meaning every work of art is a kamadhenu yielding many meanings for 16 The Little Review he

CHARLES DE MUTH The Bomb Thrower by Ben Hecht MEN and women swathed in streets and buildings factoriesavenueshouses and traffic winding them mummy fashionHe stood pressed against the wall of a skyscraperHatlessunshaventhin lipped and with the eyes of a frightened girlhe stood watching the people in the streetsTheir movement on the sidewalk in front of him was like the play of shadowsHe might lose himself in these shadowsHis legs inside their soggy trousers quiverer pleasantlyHe raised his eyes toward the window pitted altitudesA patch of sky lay neatly balanced between the roof lines of the streetThe curious smile of a man sayingyeswithout knowing what it means loosened his lipsHe must look at peopleMen were moving about in the city hunting himThey would come soon and take him awayIn the meantime he must fill his eyes with the sight of peopleof stone pavementsof doorways and plate glass windows lettered with gold and porcelainThese things constituted freedomCurves of peopleblur and drip of peoplewhy did they seem different nowThey were slaves and masters murderous bloodsucking rich and sweating back broken poorThere was this tableau in the crowd a strong lined terrible cartoon was in the crowdBut his eyes or his mind would not clearHe stared in vainThe people were like rain on the sidewalkHe watched them vanish in gusts before himHe felt frightened at their vaguenessRound and round them was the smoke of chimniesthe noise of traffic and swirl of buildingsThey were wound deepLegs moved under the swathingFaces wrapped in tons of stonein miles of steeldrifted blindlyLife seemed lost within an effigyHe removed a cigarette from his trouser pocket and lighted itstaring at the little pyramid of flame that danced at the end of his The Little Review 19 noseEventually the men who were hunting him would come to this cornerThey would see him against the skyscraper hatlessunshavedsmoking a cigaretteHe told himself these thingstaking pride in their lucidityThen his lips loosened in the smile againNo one was hunting the people on the sidewalkAnd yet they hurried running this way and thatdarting under carsin and out of doorwaysWhile he who was being hunted stood motionlessMen were worming their way through the layers of the city like bewildered maggots wandering over a mummy casehunting himWhen they found him they would become suddenly largeThey would take him by the wriststwisting them sharplyand hold him among them at the curbing while a crowd gathered and a wagonclanging vividlycame charging out of the trafficHe came back to himselfHe must deny himself the simplicity of fearIf he stepped into the crowd he would begin to runHe would runknocking people overjumping in and out among cars and wagonsHis legs quivered pleasantly at the thought and the cigarette dried to his lipsIt might be better than standing as he waswith unfocused thoughts nauseating his brainYet he held himself from runninghis unwashed hands flattened against the cool stone of the skyscraper and his fear like the soul of a stranger scurried about in his bodyHis thought became a dream that twisted itself before his eyesaddressing him with sudden intimate voicesHe felt the city like a great dice box shaking about himMen and women rolled and rattled out of it into the streetsStanding against the skyscraper he could observe the combinations the changing hieroglyphs of dotsNow the city shook out combinations of yellowblue and lavender hats luscious curves of women and doubled fists of men swinging against the black angles of legs faces that seemed like a soiled unraveling bandage and arrangements of wood and steel that were continually turning cornersAnd now it shook out the sound of laughter and the shriek of hornsThe intimate voices said to him there was no meaning to lifeHe had once been mistaken or perhaps insaneNow he was a man recovered from a delirium of mania and finding himself weak and calm in a sunny placeThe things that had peopled his mania be20 The Little Review came a distant part of the dream before his eyesan impossible and persisting yesterdayHe watched themThere was the high hammering purpose of ideals that had been in his brainThere was the clear lust that had animated himHe had been moving all his life in the light of this lustIt had played like a searchlight before hima searchlight on a tableauMasters and slaves exploitingintolerable tyrants with red faces and definitely shaped heartsand humanity crucified in factories and slumsThese things had been plain yesterdayNow they were far away and outside of him in a dreamAs he filled his eyes with the sight of people the impossible and persistent yesterday drifted continually before him as if it no longer belonged to the worldThe light of faith that had supported this yesterday had drained itself out of himHe saw himself stealing about through streets with a thing under his coatentering a crowded building and casually hiding the thing under a long stone bench on which people were sittingA few moments later amazing things were happeningWindows fell into the streetWalls flew through the airThe crowded building into which he had carried the thing became a confusion of stone and bricksHe watched the yesterday again and saw himself standing on a corner with the noise of explosion still in his earsIt had remained in his ears as he walked awayHe sought now to recapture itBut a silence remainedThe explosion had been a noise heard by someone elseThe yesterday in which it had occurred had been a yesterday inhabited by someone elseFrom his position pressed against the wall of the skyscraper hethe man who had carried the things under his coatlooked upon a world in which he had never lived beforeThe tableau and the patterns of yesterday were shuffled together and vanishedThe philosophy by which he had read into its heart was vanishedThought had become a fantastic shuffle of wordsa flood of ink and a flood of sound that broke against the movement of crowds and vanishedThe city stared down at him with its geometrical cloud of windowsThe streets wound themselves around him and the zigzag tumble of his dice played about his feetMen were prowling through the city hunting himpeering into alley waysringing door bellsThe Little Review 21 searching roomsquestioning scores who had merely known his nameThey would find him flattened against the wall of the skyscraper smoking a cigaretteHe thought idly of the things he had planned to say with his captureBut they were things of another world masters and slavesdignity of murderblasting a hole in the fat and purblind consciousness of the public through which it might see the vision of wrongs and crucifixionsThe words of the thoughts he had prepared in the world that no longer existed lost themselves in the dream before his eyesHe stared about himThere was something other hunting him than the policeA vision hunted himdemanding of him new words to give it lifeBut he could only think with his eyesWith his eyes he stared at the vision that had no meaning in his thought women swaying under colored dresseships jerking as they movedmen with faces loweredarms swinging

and rusted coloursblooming with purpleblackredgreen and yellow hatsThey bobbed by him faceshair and hats making queer lithographic masks running before his eyesHe watched them with an intensity that made him dizzyHats of men like a stretch of crazily slanted tiny roofs fled before him and remained always presentLean handled buildings swelling like great clubs at the topcars clanging and crawlingand the flutter of windows like a swarm of transfixed locustspassed into his eyes and left his thought blankThere was no meaning to be read in them22 The Little Review They were a vision for

its shellHis coat and trousers hung from him like garments heavy with raingiving him a soggyvoluminous exteriorThe corkscrew bone of his neck slanted punily like a soft candle out of the grimy socket

basinNelly Grissard was fat and lively to the point of excessShe never let a waxed floor pass under her without proving herself light of footEvery ounce of Nelly Grissard was on the jumpHer fingers tappedher feet flutteredher bosom heaved her entire diaphragm swelled with little creakings of whale bonelace and taffetaShe wore feathery things about the throathad a liking for deep burgundy silksand wore six petticoats for thejoy of discovering that I m not so fat as they say She stained her good square teeth with tobaccoand cut her hair in a bangNelly Grissard was fond of saying I m more French than human Her late husband had been French had dragged his nationality about with him with the melancholy of a man who had halfdropped his cloak and that cloak his lifeand in the endhaving wrapped it tightly about himhad departed as a Frenchman shouldThere had been manyperiodsin Nelly Grissard s lifea Russiana Greekand those privileged to look through her key hole said even a ChineseShe believed inintuitionbut it was always first hand intuition she learned geography by a strict system of love affairs never two men from the same part of the countryShe also liked receivingspirit messagesthey kept her in touch with international emotion she kept many irons in the fire and not the least of them was thespiritualironThen she had what she called ahealing touchshe could 32 The Little Review take away headachesand she could tell by one pass of her hand if the bump on that particular head was a bump of genius or of avariceor ifand she used to shudderclosing her eyes and withdrawing her hand with a slowpoised and expectant mannerit was the bump of the sensesNelly wasin other wordsdangerously careful of her sentimentalismNo one but a sentimental woman would have called her great roomy mansionThe Robin s House no one but a sentimentalist could possibly have lived through so many days and nights of sayingyesbreathlesslyor could have risen so often from her bed with such a magnificent and knowing airNo one looking through the gratings of the basement window would have guessed at the fermenting mind of Nelly GrissardHere well starched domestics rustled about laying cool fingers on cool fowls and frosted bottlesThe cookit is truewas a little untidyhe would come and stand in the entrywhen spring was approachingand look over the head of Nelly Grissard s old nursewho sat in a wheel chair all dayher feeble hands crossed over a discarded rug of the favorite burgundy colorstaring away with half melted eyes into the everlasting fountainwhile below the cook s steaming faceon a hairy chestrose and fell a faded holy amuletSometimes the world paused to see Nelly Grissard pounce down the stepsone after anotherand with a final swift and high gesture take her magnificent legs out for a drivethe coachman cracking his whipthe braided ribbons dancing at the horsesearsAnd that was about all noif one cared to noticea manin the early fortieswho passed every afternoon just at fourswinging a heavy black caneThis man was Nicholas Golwein half Tartarhalf JewThere was something darkevil and obscure about Nicholas Golweinand something bendingkindlycompassionateYet he was a very Jew by natureHe rode littledanced lessbut smoked great self reassuring cigarsand could out ponder the average fidgety American by hoursHe had travelledhe had lived as theRomans lived and had sent many a hot eyed girl back across the fields with something to forget or rememberaccording to her natureThe Little Review 33 This man had been Nelly Grissard s lover at the most depraved period of Nelly s lifeAt that moment when she was coloring her drinking water greenand living on ox liver andtestina en broda Nicholas Golwein had turned her collar backand kissed her on that intimate portion of the throat where it has just left daylightyet has not barely passed into the shadow of the breastTo be sure Nelly Grissard had been depraved at an exceedingly early ageif depravity is understood to be the ability to enjoy what others shudder atand to shudder at what others enjoyNelly Grissard dreamedabsolutely honestlystress on the absolutely when it was all the fashion to dream obscurelyshe could sustain the conversation just long enough not to be annoyingly brilliantshe loved to talk of ancient crimesdrawing her stomach inand bending her fingers slightlyjust slightlybut also just enough to make the guests shiver a little and think how she really should have been born in the time of the CenciAnd during the craze for Gauguin she was careful to mention that she had passed over the same South Sea roadsbut where Gauguin had walked she had been carried by two astonished donkeysShe had beenkindto Nicholas Golwein just long enough to make the racial melancholy blossom into a rank tall weedHe loved beautiful thingsand she possessed themHe had become used to herhadforgivenher muchfor those who had to forgive at all had to forgive Nelly in a large way and the fact that she was too fluid to need one person s forgiveness long drove him into slow bitterness and despairThe fact thather days were on her and that she did not feel the usual woman s fear of age and dissolutionnaythat she even saw new measures to takeand a fertility that only can come of a decaying minddrove him almost into insanityWhen the Autumn cameand the leaves were falling from the treesas nature grew hot and the last flames of the season licked high among the branchesNicholas Golwein s cheeks burned with a dull redand he turned his eyes downLife did not exist for Nicholas Golwein as a matter of day and after day it was flung at him from time to time as a cloak is flung a flunkeyand this made him proudmorosesilent34 The Little Review Was it not somehow indecent thatafter his forgiveness and understandingthere should be the understanding and forgiveness of anotherThere was undoubtedly something cruel about Nelly Grissard s loveshe took at randomand Nicholas Golwein had been the most randomperhapsof allThe othersbefore himhad all been of her own class the first had even married herand when she finally drove him to the knife s edge had left her a fair fortuneNicholas Golwein had always earned his own livinghe was an artist and lived as artists liveThen Nelly came and went and after him she had again taken one of her own kinda wealthy NorwegianNorda friend of NicholasSometimes now Nicholas Golwein would go off into the countrytrying to forgettrying to curb the tastes that Nelly s love had nourishedHe nosed out small townsbut he always came hurriedly backsmelling of sassafrassthe dull penetrating odor of grasscontact with treeshalf tamed animalsThe country made him think of Schubert s Unfinished Symphony he would start running running seemed a way to complete all that was sketchy and incomplete about naturemusiclove Would I recognize God if I saw him the joy of thinking such thoughts was not everyman sand this cheered himSometimes he would go to see Nord he was not above visiting Nelly s lover in fact there was that between themHe had fancied death latelyThere was a tremendously sterile quality about Nicholas Golwein s fanciesthey were the fancies of a raceand not of a manHe discussed death with Nord before the end there is something pleasant in a talk of a means to an endand Nord had the coldness that makes death strong I can hate he would saywatching Nord out of the corner of his eye Nelly can tshe s too provincialYesthere s truth in thatNelly s good to herself what more is thereThere s understanding he meant compassionand his eyes filled Does she ever speak of me It was begining to rainLarge drops struck softly against The Little Review 35 the café window and thinning out ran down upon the sill Oh yesAnd she saysWhy are you never satisfied with what you haveNicholas Nicholas Golwein turned red One dish of cream and the cat should lick his paws into eternityI suppose one would learn how she feltif she feels at allif one diedWhyyesI suppose so They looked at each otherNicholas Golwein in a furtive mannermoving his lips around his cigar Nord absentlysmiling a little Yesthat would amuse herWhat Nicholas Golwein paused in his smoking and let his hot eyes rest on Nord Wellif you can manage it Nicholas Golwein made a gestureshaking his cuff links like a harnessI can manage ithe saidwondering what Nord was thinking Of course it s rather disgusting Nord said I knowI know I should go out like a gentlemanbut there s more in me than the gentlemanthere s something that understands meannessa Jew can only love and be intimate with the thing that s a little abnormaland so I love what s low and treacherous and cunningbecause there s nobility and uneasiness in it for me well he flung out his armsIf you were to say to Nellhe hung himself in the small hourswith a sheet what thenEverything she had ever said to mebeen to mewill change for her she won t be able to read those French journals in the same wayshe won t be able to swallow water as she has always swallowed itI knowyou ll say there s nature and do you know what I ll answerthat I have a contempt for animals just because they do not have to include Nelly Grissard s whims in their means to a living conduct well listenI ve made up my mind to somethinghe became calm all of a sudden and looked Nord directly in the face I shall follow you up the stairsstand behind the doorand you shall say just these wordsNicholas has hung himself WellAnd then what36 The Little ReviewThat s allthat s quite sufficient then I shall know everythingNord stood upletting Nicholas open the café door for him You don t object Nicholas Golwein murmuredNord laughed a coldinsulting laugh It will amuse her Nicholas nodded Yeswe ve held the coarse essentials between our teeth like good dogs he saidtrying to be insulting in turnbut it only sounded patheticsentimentalWithout a word passing between themon the following daythey went up the stairs of Nelly Gissard s housetogetherThe door into the inner room was ajarand Nicholas crept in behind thisseating himself on a little tableHe heard Nord greet Nellyand Nelly s voice answeringAh dearhe listened no further for a momenthis mind went backand he seemed to himself to be peaceful and happy all at once A binding up of old soreshe thoughta oneness with what was good and simple with everything that evil had not contorted Religion he thought to himselfresting his chin on his handsthinking what religion had meant to all men at all timesbut to no man in his most need Religion is a design for pain that s it Then he thoughtthatlike all artmust be fundamentally against God God had made his own plans wellof that laterNelly had just said something there had been a death like silencethen her crybut he had forgotten to listen to what it was that had passedHe changed hands on his cane There is someone in heavenhe found his mind sayingThe rising of this feeling was pleasant it seemed to come from the very centre of his being There s someone in heaven who he asked himself who but there was no possible answer that was not blasphemy Jews do not kill themselves Nelly s voiceHe smiled there was someone in heavenbut no one here I m cominghe murmured to himself and felt a sensuous giving away in the promiseHis eyes filledWhat was good in death had been used up long ago now it was only dull repetition death had gone beyond the need of deathFunnily enough he thought of Nelly as she was that evening The Little Review 37 when she had something to forgiveHe had pulled her toward him by one end of a burgundy ribbon Forgiveforgive and she had been kind enough not to raise himnot to kiss himsayingI forgive she just stood there showing her tobacco stained teeth

neglect to answer his letter in the April number on my review of the works of Thomas Vaughan which appeared in Marchbut I have been out of England for some monthsand only lately received my copiesI found in Vaughan s worksto whose study I had come with great anticipationa vice which seems inherent in so much mystical writing and which has nothing to do with contemporary fashions of expression or fears of censorshipbut which comes from a want of quality in the intelligenceSignificant expressions of truth are clear in statementthey are not misleadingvagueor tiresomeThis clarity is the common factor in sciencecontemplationand artThe first chapter out of StJohn s gospeland theOrigin of Speciesare linked by itWhen one considers the nature of the mystic s research is it too much to demand the same precisionProfessional mystics however will have their mysticism a mysteryone result of which is that theuninitiategives it upthe man in some stage ofinitiationknows enough to resent the half deceptionAs to the fear of persecution which MrDamon thinks might influence Vaughan s successors today I can only say that as good men as he have faced itand that any profound knowledge of reality usually makes its possessor not only confidentand indifferent to its results in the worldbut capable of stating it under an adequate formulaI defy any one who reads Vaughan not to be reminded of the penny worth of bread and the intolerable deal of sackWilliam Carlos Williams Kora in Hellby Else von Freytag LoringhevenSee page 59The Little Review 59 The following five pages were originally given over to a very interesting review of William Carlos Williams s new book Kore in Hell by Else von Freytaf LoringhovenThe articleone of the most intelligent pieces of critism that has ever come to us was neverthelees marred for meby certain redundancies of thinking that destroyed the power and piquancy of the wholeWith great skillor so I thoughtmy editorial insight accomplised the necessary revisionsBut the author disagreed with me so violently that we agreed to omit the article until next monthwhen it will appear in its original formThe policy of the Little Review has alwaya been a free

photographyit seems to meshould very slightlyif at allinvalidate one s claim to the appreciation of such work as that of HWMinnsIn his casemy appreciation can begin only where the fundamental pedagogics of the camera leave offat the point where the craftsman merges into the artistwhere the creative element becomes distinctSome combination of eye and sympathy and hand are subtly responsible for the quality in his workHisarrangementsare not the emptyobvious contortions of so many modern photographersHe plainly could not content himself with thatThere isin his facesthe urge of an ethical curiosity and sympathy as strongly evident as in the novels of Henry JamesUndoubtedly his portraits are deepermore vividthan the daily repetitions of his sitters in their mirrors give back to any but themselvesbut this is only to mention again the creative element that gives to his portraits such a sense of drmatic revelationsMrMinns has often exhibited in Europeand has received extensive recognition at DresdenViennaand Copenhagen exhibitionsHe began taking pictures when he was considerably beyond thirtyand has since spent some twenty years working in the rather limited and

composed of slabs of cake and whose aliment is entirely jams and syrupsUnlike Alice in Won68 The Little Review derlandwhich is eminently reasonable if a little extravagantthis story has no roots in realityIt is certainly not the behaviour of one s grown ups gone suddenly goodAt any rate Mde Bosschère makes his curious vision absorbingly interesting and one rushes through the book for the denouement as in a detective story The Despoilerwho was always afraid that Some One would find out that he was only made of Cardboardnever slept in public is the most extraordinary of these characters and the drawing of the despoiler asleep in a tall attic with a blanket nailed across the windows is terrifyingMde Bosschère is certainly the most accomplished artist engaged in illustrating booksand his special sense of the decorative quality of black and white and his purity of line are a great pleasureThe colour reproductions are rather dirty and give but a vague idea of the gaiety of his colour and his delicious sense of decoration The SackbutLondonMonthly 10sNos 1 5 THE Sack but is an addition to London s musical papers if they existand we welcome the asperity of its opinions and the violence of its correspondenceIt is trying to do for music what the Little Review does for literatureand boosts chiefly Bernard van DierenKaikoshru Sorabjiand in passing DeliusIts recent passage with MrErnest Newman was a model of this kind of thingthough MrGray would have been less amusing had he not quoted in every line of his truly ponderous onslaughts enough great names to supply the whole of

plays the music of his own generation be classified asmodern and the question of his possible inefficiency in regard to theold mastersbe discussed from one end of the foolish country to anotherSuch

undoubtedly establish her as one of the greatest contraltos of the age a reputation she already enjoys in London and other parts of the worldOf course Americans are most skepticalat firstof personal magicIt took them years to acclaim Mary GardenAndonce acclaimedtheir recognition is as nauseating as their failure to recognizeThey never recognize essential qualityI really much prefer to hear them saying that Mary Gardencan t sing that she is a conceited freaka blatant showmanthan to hear them saying that she is a wonderful actress who gives them the sensation ofshooting up and down in an elevator MmeD Alvarez is a great artistShe not only has one of the most magnificent voices in the world she has an intellect which is preoccupied with discovering and creating new beauty rather thanlike most singerssatisfied with reproducing that already statedThe artist in a man very often finds the man a discordant environmentand expression is thereby tainted and limitedBut the artist in MmeD Alvarez finds in the woman a richestablishedcultural environmentboth of race and of personal civilizationThis combination doesn t produce a democratic artit produces a splendour and lavishness

CHARLES DE MUTH Study by Arthur Winthrop TAKING his usual morning walk after a hearty breakfastAnthony Brewer knew himself a fortunate manHe walked idlyleisurely soaking up the sunlightthe crisp windthe bitter smell of privethis eye delighted with their sombre greens and bright patches of viridianThe outlines of the houses reminded him of the village where his boyhood was spentthe low eaves jostled staid Georgian exteriorsOne house was calledThe Antlersit had a skull and antlers over the lintelThe broad opulent privet hedges pleased him mostIt was on one of these he saw the piece of string which was to be his ruinIt was plaitedand for some minutes intimation of terror made him contemplate itThis in itself he felt was remarkable since he was of strong will and decided actionThen concluding that to be so undecided was more than childish he picked it upIt was at this moment that there woke in him an impersonal feeling of inimical forcesFrom very far down in his memory the associationplaited stringsaidBe careful He remembered then quite simply and without effort that in certain places it was customary to untie every knot in the house in order to facilitate childbirthHe felt that he was on the tack but had not quite got what he wantedThen he remembered that string was often plaited as a charm an incantation was made over it and the string thrown awayThe curse would then alight on whoever untied the knotHe was faintly amusedIt was a sparkling autumn morningHe had only to be aware of the exhilaration of blood racing in his body to feel how absurd was all superstitionAutomatically and with only a faint reluctance he pulled out the stringImmediately it stuck fastHe tried the other end with the same resultAgain it unravelled for a The Little Review 77 moment and stuck fastHe carefully undid the knotsaying to himself throw it awayyou ve still time but all the time his fingers were working away at itSuddenly the string was unravelled and hung from his fingerHe said to himself You ve done it now and felt oppressed The morning had lost its headiness and he walked back quietlyHe thought of childbed that was impossibleA hideous and obscene thought flashed then through his brain some victim of insomniaSome unfortunate who lived in anguished anticipation of a night which would bring no reliefThat night which though all the world found repose must be for him a continual grinding of his brain about his life s folliesasburditiescrimesWas this the curse then that Brewer had brought upon himselfof all curses the most terribleThose occasional nights when he could not sleep had been more full of terror for him than anything in his lifeHow he had tossed from side to sidehugged his pillow in agonywith what tears and good resolutions waited for the dawnAnd now whenever he feared he might not sleep it took him hours to drop offAlready he saw a sleepless nightThe morning seemed suddenly coldHe hurried homeHis wifeall atremblemet him on the doorstepA strange cat had got into the cellarIt had stared at her with fierce yellow eyesNow it would not moveThe inspector had called to see the meter and the cat had leapt at himThe inspector had been cross and scolded her for not telling himPerhaps it had rabiesShe had heard of such thingsBrewer began to feel he was seeing prodigies lions in the streetheadless ghostsblood dripping from the skyHe was sure now that he had released some principle of evilHis brother in law came to dinner and smoked all the cigarettes and seized the best arm chairThis always happenedbut tonight it appeared to have a malign intentionFeeling she must get the matter overhis wifeas they undressedconfessed that the strange cat had so upset the maid that his Spode tureen was smashed beyond hope of rivettingThis convinced him that he had adopted another s curseFrom this day he went into a declineHe became superstitious78 The Little Review He carefully avoided the joints of paving stonesalways went once round every lamppostand before putting down any object ran his finger round the circumference seven timesEvery annoyance was put down to that unfortunate morningFinally two bills could not arrive by the same post without upsetting him beyond all measureHis back benthis fingers grew corpse coldand long pale hairs grew on the jointsthe hair of his head fell outLife was too much for him

face that was a young face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaidNine twelve bloodflows chiding her childlessAnd whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meatAnd there came against the place as they stood a young learning knight yclept DixonAnd the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learning knight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon wasThe Little Review 85 smitten him for which he did to make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might sufficeAnd he said now that he should go into that castle for to make merry with them that were thereAnd the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtleAlso the lady was of his avis and repreved the learning knight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtilityBut the learning knight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement he have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvelous castleAnd the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime veneryAnd in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantmentAnd on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellouslyAnd there were vessels that are wrought by magic out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blares into them like to bubblesAnd full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richerAnd there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are soAnd these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olive pressAnd also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheat kidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angy spirits that they do into it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountainAnd they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to meadAnd the learning knight let pour for the traveller a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every eachAnd the traveller Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of 86 The Little Review mead and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of his wileAnd he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile Thanked be Almighty GodThis meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child a gentle damewhose time hied fastSir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvelsaid hethat it be not come or nowMeseems it dureth overlongAnd he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan an that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gentlyButsaid heor it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and

goodliest guest that ever sat in scholar s hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very knight of the world one that ever did minion

and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avowAnd Sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to Sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his langour becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest mannerRuth red himlove led on with will to wanderloth to leaveFor they were right witty scholarsAnd he heard their each gen other as touching birth and righteousnessyoung Madden maintaining that put such case it were heard the wife to diefor so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne s house that now was trepassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case And they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her dieAnd not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedyThis was scant said but all cried with one acclaim the wife should live and the babe to dieAnd they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lackThen young Madden showed all the whole affair and when he said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grievedTo whom young Stephen had these words followingMurmursirsis eke oft among lay folkBoth babe and parent now glorify their Makerthe one in limbo gloomthe other in purge fireBut what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibiliseForsirshe saidour lust is briefWe are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than weThen said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what endsBut he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustiheadWhereas Crotthers of Alba 88 The Little Review Longa sang young Malachi s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice himwitnessing all and several by Saint Cuculus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to doThere at laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not betray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoeverThen spoke young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosomof law of canonsof bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth oras Virgilius saithby the influence of the occident or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses MaimonidesHe said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bring forth beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman s sealeven that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages foundedAll they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save lifeA wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all andlaying hand to jawhe said dissembling that as it was informed him and agreeing also with his experience of so seldom seen an accident it was good for that Mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questionsThat is truthsaid Dixonandor I erra pregnant wordWhich hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoonsBut sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terror causing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destinyAnd she The Little Review 80 was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb s woolthe flower of the flocklest he might perish utterly and lie akeledfor it was then about the midst of the winterand now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle couragefor all accounted him of real partsso grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whoresAbout that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily whopraying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiffhe gave them for a pledge the

footstepsCan t they do any pioneering of their ownI have followed your progress for the past five years and I am very loyal to your little journalThis loyalty may prejudice me to the extent of considering the Dial s policy a literary breach Yeswe have had this called to our attention many timesThe Dial s contents page often reads like our letter head but we don t mindand they seem to like itThere is room in America for any number of efforts of this kindAnd it is especially fittingnow that we have prohibitionto have a de alcoholized version of the Little Reviewjh In some such fashion as this do we seek to define the element which distinguishes the work of several young writersamong whom MrJames Joyce is the most notablefrom that of their predecessorsIt attempts to come closer to lifeand to preserve more sincerely and exactly what interests and moves them by discarding most of the conventions which are commonly observed by the novelistsLet us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they falllet us trace the patternhowever disconnected and incoherent in appearancewhich each sight or incident scores upon the consciousnessLet us not take it for granted that life exists more in what is commonly thought big than in what is commonly The World Movesfrom the London Times94 The Little Review thought smallAny one who has readThe Portrait of the Artist as a Young Manor what promises to be a far more interesting work Ulysses now appearaing in the Little Reviewwill have hazarded some theory of this nature as to MrJoyce s intentionOn our part it is hazarded rather than affirmed but whatever the exact intention there can be no question but that it is of the utmost sincerity and that the resultdifficult or unpleasant as we may judge itis undeniably distinctIn contrast to those whom we have called materialists MrJoyce is spiritual concerned at all costs to reveal the flickerings of that inermost flame which flashes its myriad messages through the brainhe disregards with complete courage whatever seems to him adventitiousthough it be probability or coherence or any other of the handrails to which we cling for support when we set our imaginations freeFacedas in the Cemetery sceneby so much thatin its restless scintillationsin its irrelevanceits flashes of deep significance succeeded by incoherent inanitiesseems to be life itselfwe have to fumble rather awkwardly if we want to say what else we wish and for what reason a work of such originality yet fails to comparefor we must take high exampleswithYouthorJude the Obscure It failsone might say simplybecause of the comparative poverty of the writer s mindBut it is possible to press a little further and wonder whether we may not refer our sense of being in a bright and yet somehow strictly confined apartment rather than at large beneath the sky to some limitation imposed by the method as well as by the mindIs it due to the method that we feel neither jovial nor magnanimousbut centred in a self which in spite of its tremor of susceptibility never reaches out or embraces or comprehends what is outside and beyondDoes the emphasis laid perhaps didactically upon indecency contribute to this effect of the angular and isloatedOr is it merely that in any effort of such courage the faults as well as the virtues are left naked to the viewIn any case we need not attribute too much importance to the methodAny method is rightevery method is rightthat expresses what we wish to expressThis one has the merit of giving closer shape to what we were prepared to call life itselfdid not the reading ofUlyssessuggest how much of life is excluded and ignoredand did it not come with a shock to openTristram Shandyand evenPendennis and be by them convinced that there are
