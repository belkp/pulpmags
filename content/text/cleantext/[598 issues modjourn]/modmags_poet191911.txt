PRAYER FOR MY DAUGHTER  I  ONCE more the storm is howling and half hid Under this cradle hood and coverlid My child sleeps on There is no obstacle But Gregory s Wood and one bare hill Whereby the haystack and roof levelling wind Bred on the Atlantic can be stayed And for an hour I have walked and prayed Because of the great gloom that is in my mind  II  I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour And heard the sea wind scream upon the tower And under the arches of the bridge and scream In the elms above the flooded stream Imagining in excited reverie   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  That the future years had come Dancing to a frenzied drum Out of the murderous innocence of the sea  III  May she be granted beauty and yet not Beauty to make a stranger s eye distraught Or hers before a looking glass for such Being made beautiful overmuch Consider beauty a sufficient end Lose natural kindness and maybe The heart revealing intimacy That chooses right and never find a friend  IV Helen being chosen found life flat and dull And later had much trouble from a fool While that great Queen that rose out of the spray Being fatherless could have her way Yet chose a bandy legged smith for man It s certain that fine women eat A crazy salad with their meat Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone  V  In courtesy I d have her chiefly learned Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned By those that are not entirely beautiful Yet many that have played the fool   William Butler Yeats  For beauty s very self has charm made wise And many a poor man that has roved Loved and thought himself beloved From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes  VI  May she become a flourishing hidden tree That all her thoughts may like the linnet be And have no business but dispensing round Their magnanimities of sound Nor but in merriment begin a chase Nor but in merriment a quarrel Oh may she live like some green laurel Rooted in one dear perpetual place  VII  My mind because the minds that I have loved The sort of beauty that I have approved  Prosper but little has dried up of late Yet knows that to be choked with hate May well be of all evil chances chief  If there s no hatred in a mind Assault and battery of the wind Can never tear the linnet from the leaf  VIII  An intellectual hatred is the worst So let her think opinions are accursed  Have I not seen the loveliest woman born   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Out of the mouth of Plenty s horn Because of her opinionated mind Barter that horn and every good By quiet natures understood For an old bellows full of angry wind  IX  Considering that all hatred driven hence The soul recovers radical innocence And learns at last that it is self delighting Self appeasing self affrighting And that its own sweet will is heaven s will She can though every face should scowl And every windy quarter howl Or every bellows burst be happy still  X  And may her bridegroom bring her to a house Where all s accustomed ceremonious For arrogance and hatred are the wares Peddled in the thoroughfares How but in custom and in ceremony Are innocence and beauty born Ceremony s a name for the rich horn And custom for the spreading laurel tree  William Butler Yeats   THE FLOWER OF FLAME  Un amour taciturne et toujours menacé De Vigny  I  Foamless the gradual waters well From the sheer deep where darkness lies Till to the shoulder rock they swell With a slow cumulance of sighs  O waters gather up your strength From the blind caves of your unrest Loose your load utterly at length Over the moonlight marbled breast  There sleep diffused the long dim hours Nor let your love locks be withdrawn Till round the world horizon flowers The harsh inevitable dawn  II  We watched together The sun shaft pierce The smoking weather The hail blasts fierce  One moment illume That waste so cold Irised sheets of spume Wild welter of gold   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The gaunt gulls flying Were backward tossed Their cruel crying In uproar lost  She flung aside Her fettering cloak Made of her wide Strong arms a yoke  Calling Haste lover Outstrip the hours It soon will be over This love of ours  Drove on my face Kisses like cries Gazed as to trace Light in blind eyes  Broke with strange laughter Headlong away Before nor after Ever so gay  HI  All is estranged today Chastened and meek Side by side taking our way   Robert Nichols  With what anguish we seek To dare each to face the other or even to speak  The sun like an opal drifts Through a vaporous shine Or overwhelms itself in dark rifts On the sea s far line Sheer light falls in a single sword like a sign  The sea striving in its bed Like a corpse that awakes Slowly heaves up its lustreless head Crowned with weeds and snakes To strike at the shore baring fangs as it breaks  Something threatening earth Aims at our love Gone is our ignorant mirth Love like speech of the dove The Sword and the Snake have seen and proclaim now Enough  IV  The moon behind high tranquil leaves Hides her sad head The dwindled water tinkles and grieves In the stream s black bed  And where now where are you sleeping   The shadowy night jar hawking gnats Flickers or floats High in still air the flurrying bats Repeat their wee notes  And where now where are you sleeping  Silent lightning flutters in heaven Where quiet crowd By the toil of an upper whirlwind driven Dark legions of cloud  In whose arms now are you sleeping  The cloud makes lidding the sky s wan hole The world a tomb Far out at sea long thunders roll From gloom to dim gloom In whose arms now are you sleeping  Rent clouds like boughs in darkness hang Close overhead The foreland s bell buoy begins to clang As if for the dead  Awake they where you are sleeping  The chasms crack the heavens revolt With tearing sound Bright bolt volleys on flaring bolt  Wave and cloud clash through deep through vault Huge thunders rebound But they wake not where you are sleeping Robert Nichols   HOKKU  I  Bits of song what else I a rider of the stream Lone between the clouds  II  Full of faults you say What beauty in repentance Tears songs thus life flows  III  But the march to life Break song to sing the new song Clouds leap flowers bloom  IV  Song of sea in rain  Voice of the sky earth and men  List song of my heart  Yone Noguchi   A Magazine of Verse  TANKA  I  A frail hepatica Shyly holds its fragrance Beneath the fresh morning dew So Elizabeth  II  The air is still And grasses are wet Thread like rain Screens the dunes  III  The storm has passed The sky washed clear Rain drops on twigs Reflect the moon  IV  A sloping sand plain Fades into pale night air A black tree skeleton Casts no shadow  v The brook has gone Left the lifeless bed behind   Jun Fujita  A lonely bird Seeks the water in vain  VI  On a country road An old woman walks The autumn sun Casts her shadow long and thin  VII  Across the frozen marsh The last bird has flown Save a few reeds Nothing moves  VIII  Graves are frozen A few leaves Stood danced And have gone  Jun Fujita   TROPICAL LIFE  White flower Your petals float away But I hardly hear them  TWENTY FOUR HOURS  The day is so long and white A road all dust Smooth monotony And the night at the end A hill to be climbed Slowly laboriously While the stars prick our hands Like thistles  THE STORM  Herds of black elephants Rushing over the plains Trample the stars The ivory tusk of the leader Or was it the moon Flashes and is gone Tree tops bend Crash Fire from hoofs And still they rush on   Evelyn Scott  Trampling the stars Bellowing Roaring  RAINY SEASON  A flock of parrakeets Hurled itself through the mist Harsh wild green And clamor tongued Through the dim white forest They vanished And the lips of Silence Sucked at the roots of life  THE YEAR  Days and days float by On the sides of the mountains Blue shadows shift And sift into silence Morning The cock crows There is that rosy glow on the mountains edge José in the door of his hut Maria s lace bobbins Tapping tapping Evening The parrot s shrill cry   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Pale silver green stars Night And ghosts of dead Josés And dead Marias Sitting in the moonlight Peace Depressing Interminable Peace  TROPICAL FLOWERS  An orange tree without fruit So am I without love His heavy lidded eyes sang up to her  Her glance dropped on her golden globe of breast And on the baby  MAIL ON THE RANCH  The old black man on the mule Opens the worn saddle bags And takes out the papers  From the outer world The thoughts come stabbing To taunt baffle and stir me to revolt I beat against the sky   Evelyn Scott  Against the winds of the mountain But my cries grown thin in all this space Are diluted with emptiness Like the air Thin and wide Touching everything Touching nothing  THE CITY AT MIDNIGHT  The golden snow of the stars Drifts in mounds of light Melts against the hot sides of the city Cool cheek against burning breast Cold golden snow falling all night  SHIP MASTS  They stand there Stark as church spires Bare stalks that will blossom Tomorrow perhaps Into flowers of the wind  THE SILLY EWE  The silly ewe comes smelling up to me Her tail wriggles without hinges Both ends of it at once and equal   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Yesterday the parrot bit her Last week the jaguar ate her young one  But experience teaches her nothing  CONSERVATISM  The turkeys Like hoop skirted old ladies Out walking Display their solemn propriety  A terrible force Hungry and destructive Emanates from their mistily blinking eyes  THE VAMPIRE BAT  What was it that came out of the night What was it that went away in the night The little brown hen is huddled in the fence corner Eyes already glazing How should she know what came out of the night Or what was taken away in the night A shadow passed across the moon The wind rustled in the mango trees And now in the morning The little brown hen is huddled in the fence corner Eyes already glazing   Evelyn Scott  Because a shadow passed across the moon And the wind rustled in the mango trees  FEAR  My soul leaps up at a sound What is the question I cannot answer That must be answered What is the blank face I must fill in with features  My brain pulls stretches tears But I cannot open wide enough to see Always at the agonized point of conception But never conceiving Always giving birth But never born What is it I am to conceive To what must I give birth  LITTLE PIGS  Little tail quivering Wrinkled snout thrusting up the mud He will find God If he keeps on like that  Evelyn Scott   THREE PORTRAITS  MOONRISE  The dance was over There was one last fiddle Playing a crazy jig but no one listened In couples his young friends walked through the meadow And down the lane He watched their bobbing lanterns That disappeared into the woods and thought She will be coming soon she will be coming  His mare stamped restlessly In the dull wood lot Two ghostly owls were mating Bullfrogs groaned Across the marshes and in some fence corner Over their liquor farmers were carousing But in his ears the shouting and the laughter The marsh frogs and the owls formed a wild music A chorus that his blood throbbed and repeated She will be coming soon she will be coming  Why was he waiting When the month was over He would be in the city and meet people Finer than these girls twenty times as lovely There he would find the adventures he was seeking He would have money and would hear no longer The drunken lumber jacks and backwoods farmers Stupid with beer and shouting  If he married And farmed as had his father and his brothers   Malcolm Cowley  Lifelong he would be following the round Of plowing soggy ground to sow with corn Of cultivating harvesting and husking He could not marry her But still that chorus Of silly words rang in his ears insistent She will be coming soon she will be coming  Out of the shadow she slipped into moonlight And stood beside him staring with round eyes Expectantly   Why Harry you re not angry What makes you you re so quiet Desperately He bent and kissed her  Their two shadows lengthened Across the hayfield where the dew had turned The stubble into silver And the frogs And lonely owls that screeched across the woodlot The drunken laughter and the lonely fiddle Out of discordance turned to symphony Turned to an intoxicated chorus She came to meet me here she came to meet me  BARN DANCE  He had been happy thinking she might love him And whistled at his plowing all the day But now while dancers stamped and scraped above him   On the barn floor he lay below in silence Among the cattle on a pile of hay  He had dressed quickly when his work was over And watched the guests stroll towards him up the lane But she came smiling with another lover Hurt and ashamed he stole off from the dancers Like a whipped dog to blubber out his pain  He breathed more calmly hearing the insistence Of horses munching fodder and he grew  Indifferent to the fiddles in the distance To womankind and to his disappointment Down here among the cattle that he knew  DANNY  You marched off southward with the fire of twenty  Proud of the uniform that you were wearing  The girls made love to you and that was plenty  The drums were beating and the horns were blaring  From town to town you fought and bridge to bridge  Thinking So this is Life so this is Real  And when you swept up Missionary Ridge  Laughing at death you were your own ideal  But when you limped home wounded and unsteady You found the world was new to you your clutch   Malcolm Cowley  On life had slipped and you were old already So who can blame you if you drink too much  Or boast about your pride when no one sees Or mumble petulant inanities  Malcolm Cowley  YOUR VOICE  To Edith Wynne Matthison  I  At your voice My heart dies a death of beauty As a wind blows a fruit tree in April And the blossoms lie white on the greensward As a wind shakes a golden forest And the leaves are strewn in their splendor  II  The wind of your voice has fallen on my soul making and unmaking its waters They rush together and apart from change to change unceasing Great deeps surging and breaking by that passionate music  divided And in the quietest coves in the inner caves and recesses Like hyacinths in spring are blowing the delicate pale  colored waters  Godwin Trezevant Corrali   LYRICS  IN MEMORY  Robert Clayton Westman of Massachusetts died in France August 10th 1918  Blest be the happy dead Where er they lay their head Out facers of pretence Who have achieved indifference  I will make his name silver I will loose it to run In terrible beauty From earth to the sun  I will cast it in bronze And carve it in jade And ring it in bells That his memory made  In beryl and jacinth In onyx and flame In pearl and chalcedony His beautiful name  I will set it in rubies Till it make the blood start And oh I will wear it In death on my heart   Willard Wattles  EPITAPH FOR THE UNBURIED DEAD  The old men sit and sit Long after they are dead And no one seems to know of it They look so kind and staid  The young men beat the bars That hold them fast inside Then one day comes they beat no more And know not they have died  BUT I HAVE LIVED  Love is in my heart tonight as a bird is in its nest I will build me a wall of song from the fragrance of thy breast For some are wise and some are not and some will go their  way But I have rifled the rose of life and I have had my day It s many will lay their golden heads in the muck of Flanders  clay And many are quick and warm tonight who will be cold in May But I have lived and I have loved a little song is best Love is in my heart tonight as a bird is in its nest   I WHO HAVE KNOWN YOUR BEAUTY  I who have known your beauty And bent beneath your spell Harry the hills of booty Unbroken as Ishmael  The white feet of your going Turn and turn again In a little round of the knowing Bruised heart of pain  But the cloud of your hair falling And the glory of your white hands Are mine past the bane s recalling In the inviolable lands  Willard Wattles  TREASURE  What will I remember and what will I forget Apple trees in blossom or wind at break of day I sang a song that no one heard I shall be singing yet Out beyond the high stars and through the Milky Way  One said he loved me and one said not a word You walked beside me and never heard me sing I waited in the darkness like a brooding bird And death came like a lover with a golden ring  Louise Driscoll   COUNCIL TALKS  CHIEF BEAR S HEART MAKES TALK  Agent man from Keetch ie O gi ma Our Big W ite Chief

education are far from perfect that the whole system is too much a cramming process too little that leading forth of the individual mind which is implied in the etymology of the word Too ofter the creative imagination of the child is not only not developed it is deliberately snubbed and stifled And even his critical faculty is discouraged by the average teacher s authoritative attitude which repeats day after day Your opinion is of no importance So and so Addison for example has been admired by two centuries of competent judges and it behooves young people like you to accept their opinion  Among the natural childish impulses which are stultified by this process is the love of poetry not only of taking it in but especially of giving it out The case of Hilda Conkling whose imaginative impulse toward poetic expression has been encouraged is merely an extreme example of what might be done with many other children in fact of what is being done in the English courses of a few progressive schools like the Francis Parker School in Chicago An editorial in the Holyoke Transcript puts the matter thus  Whatever may be the manner or the method or the mere inspiration of the coming of the verses of this little girl there stands out for us a vital suggestion as to the relation of poetry to the new education The cultivation of the imagination is very much the business of every teacher of every grade from kindergarten to   A Word to the Colossus  Ph D the cultivation rather of the creative power of the student sometimes to express itself in poetry sometimes in inventions to further the most practical matters of life  College curricula too frequently merely continue the stuffing and silencing process begun in the primary and secondary schools and the young mind inevitably wearied takes refuge in live up to date interests like athletics Thereupon the professorial mind puzzled and antagonized cries out that the modern youth is not a seeker of knowledge like his grandfather or even his father etc etc The common disease is intelligently diagnosed in a letter recently received from a student in one of the smaller middle western colleges a youth who according to one of his fellow students has changed the entire atmosphere pervading the student body of the institution and the remedial process which he outlines may prove suggestive He writes  Permit me to describe the ordinary college administration s idea of how to provide stimulation to intellectual pursuits It is apparent to all deans professors students parents and the administrative officers that scholarship and intellectual effort are on the wane Other interests less worth while some of them totally worthless some of them positively vicious take their place We must restore the ancient régime says the conservative dean or professor et al Scholarship and allied interests must take the place of what we see now and deplore And the procedure takes two directions First a campaign to which I can give no more dignified title than scolding On every hand in the class room from the pages of the current journals from the college chapel and lecture platform with many doleful waggings of the head the student is soberly told of his decadence Scolding then is the first method  The second means employed is the offering of prizes for high scholarship records I do not believe the giving of prizes especially if they are accompanied by honor to be utterly valueless   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But I do insist that permanently to instill intellectual ideas by the giving of prizes for marks and by the scolding process is to misjudge the true psychology of the average college student of today  And so contrary to the opinion of many of my elders grown men superior in mental equipment and training I do not believe that the student youth of America are decadent nor that they have sloughed off the fine intellectual traditions which may have existed in the past I only believe that the wrong methods have been employed in trying to restore a consistent and intelligent attitude toward intellectual things  Last year we turned to dramatics Here was a good chance to test what we regarded as the first principle in interesting students in intellectual pursuits i e the recognition and encouragement of original work  As head of the dramatic organization I sent out a call for original one act plays Two original plays written performed and coached and directed by undergrads were presented with great success within six weeks The interest displayed in the innovation was remarkable As one of the indirect consequences a literary magazine publishing essays stories poems and plays of the campus is to begin this fall Other inducements to work along creative lines are following in the wake of this first venture It has been said that these amateur imperfect attempts to encourage and secure recognition for creative work have already done more to revive the intellectual ideal than all the powerful moves of officials  The second part of the plan is the bringing to the college classroom of men and women who represent accomplishment and achievement The beginning of this was made at the same time as the production of the original plays It was also on a small scale but the idea and purpose carried much weight Two young women formerly of the Chicago Little Theatre consented to play pioneers to present a one act play and talk to interested students in an endeavor to show some of the possibilities of the drama and its present day developments Their success both in entertaining and in inspiring others was phenomenal If men and women of achievement could be brought to college campuses as a part of the educational policy the results would be astounding The falsity of the sentiment that the American college student has no interest in intellectual things would be quickly demonstrated   A Word to the Colossus  Another step in the same direction is the organization of poetry clubs among the students College faculties are reluctant to introduce courses in modern poetry though the Universities of Illinois and California Baylor University of Texas and a few other colleges have made a brave beginning But the students themselves may organize a poetry club and discipline each other quite effectively by reading and criticizing their poems at its meetings keeping up to date with the best current work by following the new publications In Harvard and the University of Chicago the members of such clubs have received to the editor s knowledge a more rigid training than is obtainable anywhere else in this art except in a few groups and coteries of poets who have already more or less arrived  Of course the only reasonable attitude toward that modern colossus Education may be one of avowed skepticism a sad acceptance of its stony and withering stride over the flowery meads of youth But if one is to resist this perhaps too facile temptation so far as to argue with the colossus it would seem that the first point to be insisted on must be that the flowers have individual rights to follow the creative principle within them into whatever shape and color it requires  H M  VISITORS FROM THE OTHER SIDE  Now that the war is over a number of foreign poets are coming to give readings or lectures in this country However one may deplore our well known American tendency   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  to lionize celebrities from across the sea at the expense of our own the list promised for this season includes three or four poets of high distinction whom we shall do well to honor besides a few younger men whose work is still experimental who may prove interesting on the platform  Of the former William Butler Yeats who was last seen in this country in the winter and spring of 1914 and who will reappear about February first under the auspices of the Pond Bureau needs no introduction to readers of POETRY and should require none before any audience beyond the mere recognition of his pre eminence as the most distinguished Irishman and the foremost poet in English of our time The dinner given to Mr Yeats by POETRY on the evening of March first 1914 has now passed into literary history partly because of the generous cachet accorded by the guest of honor to Vachel Lindsay who at that time was little known Mr Lindsay acknowledged the Irish poet s praise by reading for the first time his then unpublished poem The Congo Mr Yeats very suggestive speech printed in our issue of April 1914 has been an inspiration to all students and lovers of poetry and it will be a privilege to hear him again  Maurice Maeterlinck is another name too distinguished to require further emphasis Maeterlinck s career may be one of the tragedies of literary history the fact that his best work was done in youth and that life seems to have blurred his genius instead of developing it The theatri calism of Monna Vanna and even the somewhat over   Visitors from the Other Side  studied but delicate naïveté of The Bluebird weakening to mushiness in The Betrothal have been a serious disappointment to those who saluted the young playwright thirty years or more ago as a creative poetic genius of the first order However the softened fibre of his later work can not deprive his fame of Pelléas et Mélisande and those other early plays which reveal the very inmost soul of brooding and life bewildered youth Mr Maeterlinck s tour which begins in January with the operatic première of The Bluebird in New York will be his first acquaintance with this country  An Englishman of the highest distinction among present day poets and novelists is D H Lawrence who wrote last May to the editor of his intention to give a few lectures in America during the coming season Whether the intention has become a certainty or not we are uninformed but one can think of no one in the younger generation of British poets who would receive a more enthusiastic welcome from our literary artists Since January 1914 it has been our privilege to print many of Mr Lawrence s finest poems and his novels have the same searching and profound sincerity  Lord Dunsany Irish poet playwright and teller of tales has been ushered into this country by a good deal of littletheatre and magazine popularity His plays though written in prose are essentially poetic in spirit and essence Cloyd Head feels that while the new dramatic movement does not derive from Dunsany as it does from Synge and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Yeats the young Irishman s plays are the most important thing now going on in it that they have the unassailable validity of a fairy tale that effect of being far off in space but immediate in time and that moreover their dramaturgy is skilful to the point of magic Lord Dunsany has written also some reflectively fantastic stories a few being suggested by the war in which he served as a British officer  Siegfried Sassoon is a friend and soldier comrade of Robert Nichols the English soldier poet who was in these parts last year Eunice Tietjens reviewing Counter attack last July said Sassoon more than any other poet of war has gone straight to the root of war his book is a cringe of pain  John Drinkwater is another English poet whom the papers credit with an intention of visiting the United States this season the occasion being the American presentation of his play Abraham Lincoln which has had a popular success in England POETRY has printed a few of Mr Drinkwater s poems Dec 1915 Sept 1916 and Nov 1917 and will soon review his play  For a word about the Japanese poet Yone Noguchi we yield to Mrs Tietjens who knew him personally in Japan  H M  YONE NOGUCHI  Years ago when a group of gay young blades were making San Francisco a literary centre with the now traditional Lark when Gelett Burgess Bruce Porter et al were   Yone Noguchi  young and Joaquin Miller was still writing his rugged poetry Yone Noguchi came to this country a rather frail dreamy Japanese lad of perhaps eighteen He went to live with Joaquin Miller and the big hearted bard encouraged his dreams Presently fragile little poems began to appear in The Lark a first breath from the living Orient  Looking back on them now one can see how directly they forecast the modern movement They were in free verse in the nineties they were condensed suggestive full of rhythmical variations In matters of technic they might have been written today and though few people understood them then time has proven Mr Noguchi a forerunner  Since then he has grown to be the most important link between the poetry of America and the poetry of Japan He writes in both tongues though mostly in English interpreting the East to the West and the West to the East He lives now in a suburb of Tokyo and is professor of English in Keio University This year he is making a lecture tour of America  Mr Noguchi has lived also in London and his two books of poetry From the Eastern Sea and The Pilgrimage were both printed first in London and soon after in Japan also The Pilgrimage was published later in this country by Mitchell Kennerley They are books of subtle delicate lyrics full of that strange blend of old Japan and the West of today which makes the poetry of contemporary Japan so  intriguing This Ghost of Abyss from The Pilgrimage is typical of them    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  My dreams rise when the rain falls the sudden songs  Flow about ray ears as the clouds in June  And the footsteps lighter than the heart of wind  Beat now high then low before my dream flaming eyes  Who am I said I Ghost of abyss a Voice replied  Piling an empty stone of song on darkness of night  Dancing wild as a fire only to vanish away  But Mr Noguchi s chief service to English and American poetry is perhaps that of interpreting to us the spirit of his own land where every educated person is still a poet and where everyone writes a spring poem with as much regularity as every American purchases a straw hat His little book The Spirit of Japanese Poetry Dutton is really a door into the Japanese mind a door through which the western reader can take the first steps towards understanding and therefore loving the sharp condensed almost aching beauty of classical Japanese poetry E T CORRESPONDENCE  ABOUT COUNCIL TALKS  The author of Council Talks sends us the following descriptive and explanatory notes in regard to his poems which are interpretations of Chippewa character and life studied at first hand during nine summer seasons of life in and near the reservation  Dear Editor My poems are poetic versions of fragmentary talks made by Indians at recent councils The council is the formal meeting in which the Indians transact all tribal business all   About Council Talks  treaties and negotiate with the government Whenever any matter of tribal concern comes up a council is called Whenever the United States government through its Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs wishes to transact business with its Indian wards or desires to hear any complaints the tribe is called together for a council meeting Here representatives of the government and spokesmen for the Indians make their talks The Indians listen very attentively and quietly except for occasional grunts of approval or disapproval Here and there in the poems  In order to make Indian council oratory clear and effective for the reader will note Ho Ugh and so on italicized I used them in order to incorporate through these grunts of approval and disapproval the reactions of the Indian audience  These poems are not literal translations or interpretations by any means Indian oratory even the best among the Chippewas is fragmentary crude full of duplications and monotonous repetitions I have taken the fragments and the basic conceptions and built them up keeping in mind Indian character and thought as I know it These are therefore very broad free versions those who don t know Indian life and Indian thought it is necessary to supplement the original themes in many ways in subject matter diction words and so on And yet in doing that there is a constant danger of idealizing the Indian Every time you touch the original a bit you make him less Indian you Anglicize him The Anglicized idealized version of a council talk therefore although it gains in clearness and polish loses some of the rugged crude elemental qualities of the original article as it comes from the Indian s tongue with his crude vocabulary and ideas These experiments in dialect are attempts to solve the difficulty I have used the dialect spoken by many reservation Indians today in the remoter parts of the north woods a broken crude English that keeps the poems down to life makes them more realistic crude and elemental It makes them harder to read one has to read them slowly and brokenly but that is exactly the way they should be read Lew Sarett  FROM BRAZIL TO THE U S  The following letter from one of the poets represented in this number gives vividly certain reactions of a com   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  patriot returning to this country after a long sojourn in  tropical Brazil  Dear Editor It would take a long time to adjust oneself to this overpowering environment In a sense the very democratic aspect of our institutions when viewed at close range gives me an impression of hopelessness from the individual s standpoint Picturesque injustice may fire one to an equally colorful rebellion but there is something boyg like if I may coin the simile from Peer Gynt s experiences in this negative equality None of this is to decry Americanism but simply to express a perhaps too emotional conviction of one of its necessary evils Uniformity augments a meagre personality but diminishes the impressiveness of a vivid one So much of our education especially along cultural lines seems to content itself with admonitions as to what not to do  However there may be more than a little envy to sharpen this judgment envy of a uniformity from which the alien arrival is excluded America in some respects has developed very near to perfection and perfection is always oblivious Doubtless my criticism is born of the same impulse which leads so many European visitors to object to our rapid systems of transit and after all perfection s discouragement of original assertion has not altogether achieved its theoretical effect as one may observe who reads some of the poems that have appeared from time to time in POETRY  One could not find two poets less middle class or in other words two poets whose work lends itself less to generalization than  H D and William Carlos Williams To my mind they are in their very unlikeness among the most sharply individualized poets contemporary America has produced One could imagine the flower of H D s Narcissus like pathos as rooted among the crumbling ruins of decadent feudal institutions William C Williams questioning is deliberately defiant and the answer he demands from a homelier world But these two have it in common that their originality is inevitable There is one type of negation which is the other side of affirmation W C Williams denial for example is a species of self assertion very positive in effect while Alfred Kreymborg in particular and Wallace Stevens in a lesser degree by the insidious negative inference which accompanies their too exquisite solution of the universe transform the solid substance of earth into unstable vapor Of the other new poets too many fail to realize the futile paradox of the bizarre convention   From Brazil to the U S  I wonder if you will smile when I tell you that in the July number of POETRY I enjoyed most D H Lawrence and Hilda Conkling D H Lawrence has the trick of realizing the incidents of a tragedy in their cosmic relation and using this background of inhuman values to throw the exquisite and torturing insignificance of human suffering into relief He is a god playing at humanity When I read the little girl s poems I felt as though the one called Narcissus might just as well be called Hilda and so be perhaps more appropriately named She has the unashamed animism of the true poet  Of course I was interested in Edna Worthly Underwood s letter from Rio though from the tone of it I am afraid she must be a newcomer and in some part have mistaken quantity for quality La Revista de Semana Fon Fon Revista Souza Cruz and O Malho all publish a great deal of verse and I doubt if any American papers so preoccupied with politics as are Fon Fon and O Malho in particular give any comparable consideration to what passes for the art of the nation But Rio de Janeiro poets do not sing like birds unless the critic refers to the slight variation which the mechanism of bird expression allows to the individual songster These poets are indeed most often technicians of type and often as little aware of the deepest significances which their environment presents as are the birds of Mrs Underwood s comparison who sing on heedless of the jungle s proximity Evelyn Scott ANNOUNCEMENT OF AWARDS  Each November of POETRY S history has brought to the members of its staff the agreeable duty of awarding two or more prizes When the magazine began prizes in this art were practically unheard of in America although annual prizes and scholarships in painting sculpture architecture and music have been common The editors believed and still believe in these awards both as a stimulus to the artists and as a kind of advertisement of the art before the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  public We believe that they are as well deserved and as effective for these purposes in poetry as in the other arts and we rejoice that the example of the magazine is being followed by the Poetry Society of America through Columbia University and that other institutions and individuals are considering the bestowal of such awards  Compared with other artists the poet as everyone should know is absurdly ill paid POETRY is we believe almost the only one of the special magazines which has been able to pay anything to its contributors yet we should hate to expose the ridiculous smallness of our checks for some now famous poems of the past seven years ridiculous compared with the five eight even ten thousand dollars paid to our contemporary painters and sculptors of equal rank for a single work of no greater beauty and inherent value Nor will the few prizes offered in this art bear comparison with the numerous and extremely large awards to painters and sculptors in our various large cities for example thirty four hundred dollars in five prizes accompanied by gold silver and bronze medals at a single annual exhibition of the Chicago Art Institute  POETRY would like to change all this it would like to  be rich enough to pay for poems at least a living wage so  that poets would not have to face the grim alternative of  starving or getting an engrossing and art destroying job  The editors constantly run up against cases of poignant  suffering caused by this condition suffering which far  from enriching the poet s art tends to stifle it altogether   Announcement of Awards  They could dispose of thousands a year to individuals who desperately need the money and whose talent gives them fully as much right to financial endorsement as the numerous American art students have who enjoy local or travelling scholarships or even large allowances with studio and residence from the American Academy at Rome  If these arguments sound familiar almost a repetition of those offered last year and the years before it must be because we hope to convince by iteration And we must emphasize also our gratitude to all donors of prizes especially those two guarantors who have been for the past six years pioneers in a good cause  Mr S King Russell of New York specified last February that his prize was to be given as a mark of distinction and encouragement to the young poet comparatively unknown as yet who in the opinion of the jury most deserves and needs the stimulus of such an award And indeed most of POETRY S awards have been made in this spirit ever since Mr Yeats advised us to be so guided when he declined our earliest prize in favor of a younger man This year especially the Levinson Prize is awarded specifically on that principle for when the jury stood three to three the deciding vote was cast by a member who so explained it prizes in his opinion should be an expression of confidence in an artist s power a gamble on his future rather than an award for a more completed and achieved work of art but with less promise in it  It would be comparatively easy to award this year s prizes   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  to poets already so honored by us or others for example to Carl Sandburg for his beautiful Redhaw Winds published last October or to Edgar Lee Masters for the three epic chapters from his Domesday Book of last June or to Sara Teasdale winner of two P S A prizes for her exquisite lyric Song in POETRY last September or indeed to Mr Yeats himself for his poetic drama of last January The Only Jealousy of Emer But we are convinced that awards should not be mere repetitions or the mere ratification of loud applause In this conviction we prefer to consider hors concours these already laurelled poets including also Cloyd Head and Vachel Lindsay And poems by members of the jury also are not in competition in this case Red Earth and Candle light and Sun by Alice Corbin  The Harp by Helen Hoyt Facets by Eunice Tietjens and America by the editor Translations also are exempt  With this preliminary and in the hope that our contributors and readers will not demand infallibility in human judgment the editorial staff of POETRY has the honor of announcing three prizes the first two being for poems or groups of poems printed in this magazine during its seventh year October 1918 to September 1919 and the third requiring no limitation of date  The HELEN HAIRE LEVINSON PRIZE of two hundred dollars for a poem or group of poems by a citizen of the United States is awarded to  H L DAVIS   Announcement of Awards  of The Dalles Oregon for his group of poems Primapara published in the April number This prize was founded in 1913 by Mr Salmon O Lev  inson of Chicago Previous awards have been as follows 1914 Carl Sandburg for Chicago Poems 1915 Vachel Lindsay for The Chinese Nightingale 1916 Edgar Lee Masters for All Life in a Life 1917 Cloyd Head for Grotesques 1918 John Curtis Underwood for The Song of the  Cheechas  The prize of one hundred dollars offered by an anonymous guarantor for a poem or group of poems without distinction of nationality is awarded to  MARJORIE ALLEN SEIFFERT  of Moline Illinois for her poem The Old Woman published last January This prize or other prizes similar in intent have been previously awarded as follows 1913 Vachel Lindsay for General Booth Enters into Heaven 1915 Constance Lindsay Skinner for Songs of the Coast  dwellers 19I5_ H D for Poems 1916 John Gould Fletcher for Arizona Poems 1917 Robert Frost for Snow 1918 Ajan Syrian for From the Near East   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The prize of one hundred dollars offered by Mr S King Russell under conditions noted above for good work by a young poet is awarded to  MARK TURBYFILL  of Chicago because of the quality of his work printed in POETRY for May 1917 and August 1918 as well as last month  Three other special prizes of one hundred dollars each have been previously awarded to Louise Driscoll for Metal Checks as the best poem of the war received in competition and printed in our War Number of November 1914 to Wallace Stevens for Three Travellers Watch a Sunrise adjudged the best one act poetic play received in a prize contest July 1916 and to Muna Lee for a lyric poem or poems by a young poet in POETRY during its fourth year  Besides the above three awards and the poems by former winners of POETRY prizes listed above the following poems receive honorable mention  The Blue Duck by Lew Sarett November Nostalgia

 THE PRIZE POEMS  In deference to urgent requests we here reprint as many of the prize poems as we have room for for the benefit of those readers who do not keep their files of the magazine  Primapara by H L Davis is a group of eleven poems of which we reprint four For the first we revise the title according to the poet s corrected proof which arrived too late last March  PROUD RIDERS  We rode hard and brought the cattle from brushy springs From heavy dying thickets leaves wet as snow From high places white grassed and dry in the wind Draws where the quaken asps were yellow and white And the leaves spun and spun like money spinning We poured them out on the trail and rode for town  Men in the fields leaned forward in the wind Stood in the stubble and watched the cattle passing The wind bowed all the stubble shook like a shirt We threw the reins by the yellow and black fields and rode And came riding together into the town Which is by the gray bridge where the alders are  The white barked alder trees dropping big leaves Yellow and black into the cold black water Children little cold boys watched after us The freezing wind flapped their clothes like windmill paddles Down the flat frosty road we crowded the herd High stepped the horses for us proud riders in autumn  IN THE FIELD  The young grass burnt up so hot the air was And I was lying by her knee near the cool low   The Prize Poems  Spring branch in sight of the green shining meadow How red her mouth was how fine her hair and so cool Her hair was cool as the ground I thought how red Her mouth was and wondered at her white wrists Another would have meddled not have let me lie Another would have laughed when I put in items her beauty But she was still like any scene or the sky  Her red mouth her wrists so white This is cool blood And it is deep since it colors your mouth only I wonder and wonder at you do you seem best Playing with your hand in the dirt like any dumb person For then you are like a black river bird at rest Or like a poet sitting on the stairs among The people like yours and talking familiarly with them I wonder at you moreover because of your people Whose daughters should not seem sweet yet you seem to me Pleasanter to touch than are the light breast feathers  Of a bird and your heart plays lower more like wind  It is pleasure to lie by your knee here in the fields  I say yet the white alders and the willows switching  And the weaving of thin graceful weeds pleased me more  Than to own pastures because of her beauty But say  Nothing like Come away because her people  Work with her now where about cold low springs the smoke  From waters at morning stains the cold air all day  MY STEP GRANDFATHER  My step grandfather sat during the noon spell  Against the wild crabapple tree by the vines  Flies about the high hot fern played or fell  To his beard or upon the big vein of his hand  With their playing he seemed helpless and old in a land  Where new stumps piles of green brush fresh burnt pines  Were young and stubborn He mentioned the old times  As if he thought of this I have marched and run  Over the old hills old plowed land with my gun  Bumping furrows oh years old But in this new place  There is nothing I know I ride a strange colt   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  You know old times and have seen some big man s face Out of the old times what do you remember most  General Lee Once they called us out in a cold Plowed field to parade for him He was old with frost I remember our style of dress my dead friends last long I would have thought longer and there were peaked women Who watched us march and joked with us as they were trimming The green shoots of wild roses to eat But these with me Lack what the other has they are not so strong And lost battles I would be prouder starving in rain And beaten and running every day with General Lee Than fat and warm winning under another man  Alone presently I laid myself face down To avoid seeing the field and thought of how the book  Describes Esther and imagined how that queen might look Preferred for beauty in her old fields red and brown I am like my step grandfather I thought and could Follow whatever I love blind and bold  Or go hungry and in great shame and for a cause be proud And I came to work sad to see him so old  THE VALLEY HARVEST  Honey in the horn I brought my horse from the water And from the white grove of tall alders over the spring And brought him past a row of high hollyhocks Which flew and tore their flowers thin as his mane And women there watched with hair blown over their mouths Yet in watching the oat field they were quiet as the spring  Are the hollyhocks full bloomed It is harvest then The hay falls like sand falling in a high wind When the weeds blow and fly but steady the sand falls It is harvest harvest and honey in the horn I would like to go out in a few days through the stubble field And to all the springs yours too we have known for years And to the bearing vines and clean the berries from them  Call women why do you stand if not for your pride s sake   The Prize Poems  But the women would neither call to me nor speak Nor to any man not mowing during their harvest They watched with their hair blowing near the stalks In the row of red hollyhocks  Quiet as the spring What is by the spring A bird and a few old leaves  We reprint the whole of Mrs Seiffert s prize poem  THE OLD WOMAN  A Morality Play in Two Parts  Doctor There is an old woman Who ought to die Deacon And nobody knows But what she s dead Doctor The air will be cleaner When she s gone Deacon But we dare not bury her Till she s dead  Landlady Come young doctor From the first floor front Come dusty deacon From the fourth floor back You take her heels And I ll take her head  Doctor and We ll carry her Deacon And bury her If she s dead  House They roll her up In her old red quilt They carry her down At a horizontal tilt She doesn t say Yes And she doesn t say No She doesn t say Gentlemen Where do we go  Doctor Out in the lot Where the ash cans die   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Deacon  House Landlady  House  Woman Landlady  Deacon Doctor Landlady  Woman  There old woman  There shall you lie  Let s hurry away  And never look behind  To see if her eyes  Are dead and blind  To see if the quilt  Lies over her face  Perhaps she ll groan  Or move in her place  The room is empty Where the old woman lay And I no longer Smell like a tomb Doctor deacon Can you say Who ll pay the rent For the old woman s room  II  The room is empty Down the hall There are mice in the closet Ghosts in the wall A pretty little lady Comes to see Oh what a dark room Not for me The room is large And the rent is low There s a deacon above And a doctor below When the little mice squeak I will pray I ll psycho analyze  The ghosts away The bed is large And the mattress deep Wrapped in a featherbed You shall sleep But here s the door Without a key   The Prize Poems An unlocked room Won t do for me Doctor Here s a bolt Deacon And here s a bar Landlady Woman You ll sleep safely Where you are Good night gentlemen It s growing late Good night landlady Pray don t wait I m going to bed I ll bolt the door And sleep more soundly Than ever before Deacon Doctor House Good night madam I ll steal away Glad a pretty lady Has come to stay She lights a candle What do I see That cloak looks like A quilt to me She climbs into bed Where long she s lain She s come back home She won t leave again She s found once more Her rightful place Same old lady With a pretty new face Let the deacon pray And the doctor talk The mice will squeak And the ghosts will walk There s a crafty smile On the landlady s face The old woman s gone Landlady And she s filled her place It s nothing to me If the old woman s dead I ve somebody sleeping In every bed POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Of the poems by Mark Turbyfill which appeared previous to last month we reprint two  A SONG FOR SOULS UNDER FIRE  Lo that doves  Should soften These surging streets  I found him talking simply and gladly of God In the unmoved city of granite And noise  Thought kindled in his cheek And his white faith Was the tree in spring To look upon  He whispered me he knew the God of Daniel In the lions den The faith of Joan of Arc On parapets  He will walk a spirit  Of unguessed power  Into battle  He will walk unreached Into fire  THE FOREST OF DEAD TREES  I climbed up the rough mountain side Through the forest of dead trees  I touched their smooth stark limbs And learned much of the white beauty of death  Whose taut slender thigh was this And this whose gracious throat   The Prize Poems  O life you are not more beautiful Than this silent curving death is beautiful  And Eternity I think I heard it cry Centre within centre
