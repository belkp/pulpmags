and the oaks fer yaller Sometimes you d think the sun was shinin When taint nothin but leaves Ef you was to go up Tollman s hill You d see the country layin out in front o yer Jest like a big flower garden I don t wonder city folks is so partial to the mountains in the  Fall But they don t all care enough fer it To come a ridin shanks s mare The way you re doin What was it you wanted I should tell yer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Oh yes bout the brick house over on the Danbridge road I know well the one you mean Sort o tumble down ain t it Run to seed That s the one The old Steele farm we call it It s in a dretful state The last folks had it was a pack o Finns And I never see such a shiftless set as they be Don t seem to have no idea o nothin But the way they can grub a livin outer stones Do beat all There s a whole lot on em settled around here But I guess they wouldn t ha got aholt o the Steele place Only fer it havin a kind o bad name Sort o got set in a streak o cross luck somehow You hitch your chair up clost t th fire And I ll tell yer bout it It s a funny story And it ain t so funny neither Come to think of it I remember Tim thy Adams well When I was a girl He was innercent and feeble enough by then My father s told me the story often But it all happened long fore my day It must ha been nigh on to eighty year ago Ther was two brothers livin over to Danbridge at that time   Amy Lowell  Name of Steele George and Clif Steele Between em they owned that farm you seen And a hardware store to Main Street My father used ter say Nobody hereabouts thought they could cut a rakeful o hay Or split a log Onless they d bought the scythe or the saw or the sickle To Steele s Funny name for a hardware store warn t it But them things does happen Well es I said They owned the store and the farm tween em Old Steele left it that way But twas real onhandy And nat rally they kep a treadin on each other s toes So bout the time I m speakin of They made up ther minds to do the splittin therselves And they d fixed it up that George was to have the store And Clif was to take the farm Clif warn t more n five and twenty then And he warn t married And he seen well as another That a farm without a wife s a mighty ticklish thing So he told his brother He d look around a bit And when he found a likely woman He d marry her   And settle right away I guess he warn t quite square bout the lookin around Cause everyone knowed he d be n keepin comp ny Fer some time Mirandy Eccles twas And Father al ays said she was a fine sensible girl And a credit to the man that chose her Clif used ter take her buggy ridin With a fast sorrel mare he had Done two thirty or somethin Over to the County Fair Clif was proud as punch of her and of the girl too Father said the whole street ud set up to look When they two druv along it Like a streak o lightnin Clif thought his courtin was goin elegant And I guess twas When all of a suddint He was drawed for jury duty That put a stop to the junketin s And Clif was like a bear with a sore head Twas a kind of a queer case A man called Tim thy Adams was bein tried Fer saulting his employer and stealin four dimonds I don t rec lect the name o the man whose store twas But he was a jeweler and watchmaker The only one ther was to Danbridge One mornin they found him most beat to a jelly   Amy Lowell  And bound and gagged And four big dimonds was missin outer th stock Ther was a candle in the store Guttered to nothin And Mrs the storekeeper s wife Said when she last seed it Jest as she was goin to bed It was good and long And would ha burned a couple o hours anyway Tim thy used to come mornin s and open up the store He had a key And that was the only other one ther was So suspicion fastened on him good and tight He said he hadn t be n ther at all Sence closin time That he d be n fer a walk up the mountain But he hadn t be n gunnin Cause he didn t take no gun And he hadn t be n fishin Cause he didn t take no pole And nobody b lieved a man ud go walkin up the mountain Jest fer the pleasure o gittin ther So it looked bad fer Tim thy Clif set in that court room And twiddled his fingers And thought o Mirandy And never heerd so much as a haystraw o th evidence And when lockin up time come   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He didn t know no more about the case Than the town pump In them days Juries was locked up for fair They didn t low em home nights And they sent their meals in Stead o marchin em out to a hotel Clif had got awful sick o bein ther He d cut his name on the table in the jury room Till twas all pickled over with it I ve seed the table with the name on myself And the night after the ev dence was in Ther was a dance to the Town Hall And Clif wanted like pisen to be ther He set in that jury room Hackin at the table Till he couldn t stand it another minit Then he jumped outer th winder And shinned down a big elm tree was outside And went to the party And the first person he run acrost when he got inter th room Was the Judge That was a awful fix fer Clif But the Judge had be n young once And he jest turned his back and never seed a thing Clif didn t waste no time He went straight up to Mirandy and asked her to marry him And she d missed him so   Amy Lowell  She said yes right out And Clif went back and shinned up the elm agin And ther he was spick and span When the door was unlocked next mornin But he hadn t voted on the case And the foreman jest whispered to him would he agree As they went inter court Clif was in such good sperrits He d ha agreed to anythin So he jest nodded And poor Tim thy Adams was convicted o sault and batt ry With stealin And sent to States Prison fer twenty year I told you twas a queer story But it s a heap queerer than you ve heard yit  Clif married Mirandy And they went to live to the farm They was a well matched pair And everythin went as fine as roses in July Cept they didn t have no children But after it had all be n goin on like that fer most fifteen  year Somethin turned Clif s mind back to that old jury case Bits o things he d heerd in the court room Kep a risin up in his mind They must ha be n ther all the time But he d never sensed em   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And now they up and slapped him in the face The more he thought the more he felt That Tim thy couldn t ha done it He was a bit of a dreamer himself And he knowed a man could go up a mountain Ithout hankerin to shoot or fish He thought and thought Clif did Till he was so nervous and jumpy He was all of a twitch from head to foot Then one day he druv over to Danbridge To see Judge Proctor The Judge was a old man and retired But Clif thought it ud ease him some To see him He told the Judge all about it But the Judge said twas past and gone And he d better lay some of his fields down to red rye And try replantin his wood lot But Clif didn t buy no red rye seed that day He went straight to the lib ry And read a lot o old newspapers Then he ferreted out the court clerk And fussed and fussed Till he let him see the records He druv back and forth to Danbridge for weeks Readin all the papers bout that trial And the more he read em the more he knowed Tim thy hadn t had no head nor hand to do with it   Amy Lowell  Clif was most beside himself with worry And no wonder He felt he d sent a feller critter to States Prison Who didn t b long ther no more n he did hisself He act ally got to feelin he was the one b longed He d committed a wicked crime And he d got t expiate it I guess he was most mad Father often said so He was thin as a rail And he couldn t eat nor sleep And the farm all went to smithereens Cause he hadn t no time to work it For readin ev dence He didn t know much law And it curred to him That ef he got all the jury that done the convictin To change ther minds That would stop the sentence right where twas And Tim thy could walk out o jail So the poor lunatic started to git aholt o the jury Twarn t no easy matter to do Fer some was moved away and some was dead But he wrote and he travelled  And he run here and ther like a hen ithout its head And in the end he got all the livin members o that jury To sign papers reversin ther decision Is that very remarkable Sir   P raps you re right Anyhow he done it When he d got all the papers He went back to Judge Proctor And asked him would he please arrange things So Tim thy d be free O course the Judge told him twarn t no manner o use That all the papers in the world wouldn t git Tim thy out Onless ther was new ev dence Which don t you see ther warn t Not a scrap So Clif went home all broke to bits And put his papers in the chimbly cupboard And Mirandy had all she could do To git a little bacon and coffee down him It s al ays the women gits it in the end you know Sir  Well byme bye it come time fer Tim thy to be let out o jail He d served his term barrin what was took off fer good  conduct The very day he stepped out o prison Standin d rectly in front o the gate Wher he couldn t miss him Was Clif Steele Tim thy was took all aback And made to git out o th way But Clif up and hitched his arm inter his And marched him off real brotherly   Amy Lowell  Tim thy Adams says Clif I done yer a great wrong I know you never saulted nobody And never took no dimonds And I come here to day to make it up to yer best I can he  says Come to yer senses have yer says Tim thy Yes I have says Clif An I m goin to take yer right along home with me Mebbe Tim thy wouldn t ha gone Only his sperrits was all squeezed to nothin By bein so long in jail Anyhow Clif wouldn t hear no And them two went home together Like a pair o old shoes Folks wondered would Mirandy like it All I c n say is ef she didn t she darsn t say so I guess she was some feared bout Clif s stayin in his right  mind Whatever was th reason she acted pleased as pie So the three on em lived in the brick house And after a little nobody heeded em no more But Clif was all played out The worry d done fer him And two year come the next winter He died o pneumony Tim thy and the widder Stuck it out fer a bit as they was   But tongues got to waggin And they must ha heerd em Anyways one fine day they up and got married And that settled the talk fer keeps Then the good times seemed come fer Tim thy and Mirandy They warn t young no more but they was real well suited Folks kind o fergot bout the jail And Mirandy took a new lease o life Why the kitchin winders was all jammed full o flower pots You never seed sich rose geraniums Everybody wanted slips from em I don t know jest how it come bout But one way or tother Tim thy took to tinkerin clocks  agin He had a wonderful knack at makin em go Not the batteredest old clock es ever was beat him He d set ther in that kitchin Snuffn up the smell o them geraniums And foolin with little wheels and wires And all of a suddint he d have the clock as good as new Most everybody has a broken clock Well they brought em all to Tim thy The house was full on em  Now comes the queer part And ther ain t no explainin it nohow Many s the time I ve heerd my father tell it But I never give over startin when I think of it   Amy Lowell  One day Tim thy was overhaulin a fine wall clock The kind with big weights hangin down under it When he give a cry So loud Mirandy heerd it out in the clothes yard She come runnin in With her heart in her mouth And ther was Tim thy Starin as though he seed a ghost And holdin four big dimonds in his hand They was sparklin like icicles on a south winder All green and blue and red Father seed em And he said they was so bright You could most see to read by the flashin they made Wher d you git them things Tim thy Adams Mirandy  hollered out She was struck all of a heap And couldn t scarcely fetch her breath fer wonder Out o the clock says Tim thy quick as ef a bee stung  him Who put em in asked Mirandy kind o snappin out the  words I ain t no notion says Tim thy Now ther was a fine fix and dimonds agin Mirandy leaned up against the door jamb to save herself  from falliti Whose clock is it says she Twas old man Smart s clock and Tim thy telled her so   Well not to keep a talkin all day they sent fer old  Smart And showed him the dimonds But he said they warn t none o his Tim thy acted as ef he was afeared on em He d put em on the chimbly And he wouldn t tech em agin nohow Mirandy said she couldn t sleep with em in the house And ther was a fine hurrah boys The neighbors got wind on it somehow And they all come flockin to ask fool questions And git a sight o the dimonds Tim thy seemed kind o crazed all to onct He jest set ther and whispered In the clock In  clock Nobody couldn t git another thing out o him Mirandy d got to cryin by then And all the women was soothin her And burnin feathers under her nose Twas the awfullest mess ever was And all along o them pesky dimonds Somebody called in Lawyer Cary to Danbridge And he took charge o the dimonds And they got the house cleared somehow But nothiri ever warn t the same after Mirandy went inter a sort o decline And died fore Thanksgivin Tim thy didn t die but he didn t git well neither   Amy Lowell  He wouldn t tech a clock agin fer love nor money If anyone said Clock he d commence shiv rin As though he had th ague Then a nasty whisper got about You know how folks talk Well twas said the dimonds warn t really in the clock at all That Tim thy d had em all these years And that he only pretended to find em So s he could sell em at last Some said twas a trade twixt him and Clif Clif had kep em for him while he was to States Prison I guess that was all foolishness But what made em think so Was that old man Smart lowed he d bought the clock To a auction And it turned out twas the auction o that jewel ry store Where Tim thy worked The man that owned it had sold out and gone away Lawyer Cary tried to trace him But twarn t a mite o use He d gone to Boston and they couldn t find out another  thing But ther was the dimonds and ther was poor old Tim thy Half cracked with findin em Property like that s a terrible nuisance Old man Smart wouldn t look at the things And he told how he d burnt the clock Considerin it a sort o party   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  They warn t Tim thy s that was sure And Lawyer Cary said he wouldn t keep em after New  Years So the selectmen voted to sell em An buy books for the lib ry with the money You c n see em now with a card in em Bought with the proceeds o the sale o four dimonds I must ha be n bout ten when Tim thy died I mind it well cause Father told the story at supper The day they buried him And I ain t never forgot it Ther was some trouble bout the house too George Steele had moved to Boston years afore And his daughter he didn t have no sons had married And they had a time findin her under her new name Anyhow she didn t want the farm an twas sold It s be n goin down hill ever sence Lor s mercy Ain t this world a queer place Ther was three lives all gone to smash Over them dimonds  And nothin to show fer it but a ramshackle house And a passel o books in the lib ry Well that s the story And I must be seein to your supper  It s gittin late  Amy Lowell   POEMS OF THE HOUR  FOR PARENTS OF THE SLAIN  Weep not they would not have us weep for them Weep not for they are as the stars that shine Their glory spilt upon the darkened skies Can not be dimmed by frailty yours or mine  They cannot die shall not the best survive The flower of man too has its seed in death And as the Phoenix soars from ashen dust Man s spirit from the dead draws living breath  They live with us as they shall live with men Throughout the ages in the times to be Patriots and partners in the great emprise To make and keep their cherished England free  Only when foul is fair and fair is foul And honor fails shall men blot out their light Only when men shall call their courage crime Shall England know oblivion and the night  They shall not die so men be worthy them And the high motive shining through their deed So men be worthy they shall never die But shall be spirit warriors at our need   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE QUESTION  You in the dark of death Quietly sleeping I in my shuttered room Silently weeping  Quickens your being in God You unawaking Or does my heart alone Live on and breaking  THE MOURNER  O sea whose tides are as eternity Whose ebb and flow survive all human pain O timeless sea heal now this wound of time That my life tide may flow in hope again  But if though willing thou art impotent Beseech in pity the bland pain rid moon That she will take unto herself this heart And in her bosom fashion it to stone  THE BAYONET CHARGE  A forest of steel leaves Glints in the sun And shimmers in the wind The thing s begun   Charles Granville  A sea of faces set Grimly to kill A pack of wolves that rush To take their fill  A yell that rends the air And strikes the sky And stirs the dead who low In silence lie  A sense of clashing fray A bloody sun A mist of reeking blades And it is done  UNDER ORDERS  No shouting heralded the word As through the ranks it swiftly went But a low murmur such as trees Indulge when grateful summer s spent  A murmuring of seasoned wills Bent upon hellish wrong s redress A diapason sound from deep To deep presaging storm and stress  Then each to his allotted place For sleep You say your fancy heard The air beat by a thousand wings That night I could not doubt your word  Charles Granville   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WOLVERINE WINTER  The chickadee came in the morning Over the Lake hung snow clouds piling Wheeling for the signal for the signal Of the lake gods coming to battle  Up and down the West Coast went the Life Guards Sniffing at the air and frowning at the sky Peering out to westward muttering to their Pard To their Pard the surf seeping high  While the Winter came out of the North Stripped naked cruel as a bloodless sword  I carried in wood and I pumped me some water I cleaned out the chimney and doubled my quilts Then I phoned in to town and bid my pals adieu We cursed at the weather promised our God a prayer  For the Winter the frozen Hell of the West Coast Like a weasel was sneaking down the shore  Like the wraith of a profaned tomb it came I could see it twisting and writhing round the Point Round Little Sauble Point where the pines and spruces Whine in a gale like the over taut string of a viol  Out among the snow clouds swept its scythe like breath Fretting the pitching waves to frothy frenzies   Paul F Sifton  Catching their boiling crests in a creamy ice And where it passed the moisture was turned to snow  At dusk with a keening wrench and thrust it left the Lake Snarled at the Land froze the West Coast dead Paul F Sifton  SEA MUSIC  There is a place of bitter memories Dreary and wide and lonely as the sea Foaming and moaning there they come to me Like wild gulls crying sea taught monodies Iron winged hours heavy heavy with dread Dawn after death the sound of a shut door And shining love that has a withered core The eyes of those who fight and starve for bread There is doom and change and silence and denying Memories of these pluck at the heart of me And over the bitter roar of the old dumb sea The air is filled with the noise of wild gulls crying  Babette Deutsch   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CHILDREN  These are my children one boy one girl They have the beauty all children have They have entered the trap all children enter The trap that was set by God knows who  These are the flowers of love and spring The apple blossom and daffodils Tulip and bluebell lilac and hawthorn And the young green leaves on the trees But earth the giver is anhungered too  They do not know children and flowers That the ground beneath them is what it is The sun and the rain their laughter and tears Are all that they know  I watch them at play and I know the part I have played myself in bringing them here I too was once in the outer forest And decoyed like them have decoyed them in To be decoys in their turn perhaps To my grandchildren will they be mine And so it goes on father and son daughter and mother  But they look at me with their trustful eyes And they laugh at me in their games and graces They come and caress me they love me so The thoughtless treacherous eagerly lecherous Knave and husband whom they call father The man who betrayed them to certain death   F S Flint  And I am their wistful comrade and watchdog I go with them sometimes into the streets Among the crowds and I share their wonder A child with my children and my man s form And my man s strength is their contrite shield And my heart is a pool of tenderness for them For they do not know what the earth is yet Nor what the clay can be to the body When they know they will no longer be children They will make their link in the chain of treason And so it goes on father and son daughter and mother  IN THE CATHEDRAL  I have not dipped my hand in the stoup Nor bent my knee towards the altar Far away at the end of the nave The crucifix towers dimly above it Is this my God  The Stations of the Cross Are white on the dull brown brickwork Poor naked cathedral One pillar alone is clothed With green marble  O gloom of the aisles And darkness made darker By the candles burning in corners Here and there In front of the images   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Why am I moved Is this the house of my God  1 he voices of the priests far off Near the altar Have sound and no meaning as words But they fill the church with life And peace and resignation The music of it enters my heart  O God you need me I know Or why am I here why am I You will not cast me off You cannot O God I say it With a humble and desperate heart I am the least worthy atom of your Person But of you or nothing at all And this woman Kneeling in her ragged clothes Before the saint with the ten lighted candles Is happier than I Her worn and battered face Is shining with certainty She is in heaven and I My heart is twisted with sobs  And my eyes are weeping  And yet as I leave the cathedral I do not dip my hand in the stoup  F S Flint   SCHOOL ROOM SKETCHES  AMERICUS  A little

 RECEN T visit to St Louis enabled me to see Alfred Kreymborg s three Plays for Poem mimes which were given by the Players Club at the theatre of the Artists Guild on the evening of Monday December 3d The performance gave me quite a thrill for the plays acted extremely well indeed sprang to life in the presentation with a power which proclaimed the born playwright Two of the plays I had read Lima Beans in print and When the Willow Nods in manuscript read with admiration for the humane wit of the first and the searching poetic beauty of the second But as the proof of the pudding is in the eating so that of a play is in the acting it required the excellent performance of the Players Club to convince me that we have in Mr Kreymborg a poetic and interpretive playwright of original and authentic power a claimant for wide recognition on the American stage  It was the first performance on any stage for When the Willow Nods and Manikin and Minikin The former is a monologue in free verse a running comment half whimsical half pitiful uttered Greek chorus fashion by a quiet seated cloaked and hooded figure while a boy and girl act and dance out their little love affair in pantomime It would be impossible to over state the beauty of Orrick Johns interpretation of the enigmatic speaker Mr Johns being a poet and having a fine voice might be expected to read the lines   simply and with full sense of rhythmic values but only a true histrionic instinct could have kept him always in the picture always the master of the stage  Manikin and Minikin is a dialogue between two Louis Quinze ornaments on a mantel piece the figures beautifully dressed and posed And Lima Beans which has been played a little east and west is a more or less satiric farce conceived in the gayest possible whimsical spirit and it was set and acted in the same mood  Besides this Players Club St Louis has another amateur company that of the Artists Guild which this year has engaged a professional director Irving Pichel I was delighted to find that Mr Pichel has designs upon the play by Wallace Stevens to which POETRY gave a prize over a year ago Three Travellers Watch a Sunrise If all goes well St Louis may get ahead of Chicago which printed this play and New York the home of the poet by producing it next February  The advance of dramatic art in this country especially of the poetic drama is now the affair of the so called little theatres which have sprung up so numerously since Maurice Brown started the Chicago Little Theatre about the time POETRY began In fact Chicago s precedence antedates even the Little Theatre for the New Theatre started the ball rolling in the season of 1906 7 the Drama Players under Donald Robertson pushed it along in 1907 9 and the Hull House Theatre which had been giving plays even earlier was reorganized for progressive work under Mrs Pelham in   Little Theatres and Poetic Plays  1907 The movement started by these courageous pioneers has gained such headway that now even Broadway is trembling opening its dazed eyes to the vitality of a demand for more imaginative and beautiful work in the theatre than the typical commercial manager has believed the public would stand for The typical commercial manager and the typical newspaper critic has spent much time and space laughing at the efforts of these amateurs who out of love of the art with little thought of self or pelf have done the pioneer experimental work which the professionals preoccupied with self and pelf refused to do While the professionals have walked in their rut and stuck to the sure thing these amateur companies have offered the new thing the uncertain thing have given the young playwright a chance to try out his experiments and thereby learn his trade the young poet a chance to test his capacity for the stage And now the professionals find to their amazement that the sure thing is no longer sure and that a group of young playwrights poets and prosers both is springing up in whose introduction to the public they have had no share They will have to take lessons of the little theatres indeed the process is beginning And when Broadway bends a suppliant knee may our young playwrights of the new movement accept no compromise  It is a matter of deep regret to POETRY that the Chicago Little Theatre whose work has been so essential in the movement has found the financial problem too difficult and has now definitely brought its labors to a close Since its   curtain first rose in November 1912 its director Maurice Browne has given important and significant productions and its chief scenic artist Raymond Johnson has introduced beautiful and original effects of line color and lighting As I review its five year list of forty plays besides nine for puppets plays comic and tragic old and new foreign and native the most important and significant of all seems to me Cloyd Head s Grotesques If I give this production precedence over Ibsen Strindberg Schnitzler and Andrews over Oscar Wilde and Synge and Yeats over Shaw and Allan Monkhouse and Leonard Merrick over even the beautiful productions of The Trojan Women and Medea with Mrs Browne wonderful beyond words in the latter play it is because the special purpose of the little theatre seems to me to produce the modern and native thing to try the immediate experiment rather than to present old plays or foreign plays which in many cases have had other local productions  Mr Head s play was a modern and native poetic interpretation of life involving moreover a scenic scheme of great beauty and originality and therefore the success of it the special thrill that it gave was of more value to the art to the movement than the success of Medea of Rosmersholm of The Shadowy Waters or even of Dierdre of the Sorrows beautiful and significant as these are It was more valuable because it was ours because it uttered our own immediate feeling because the poet who wrote it was on the spot to see it and learn from it   Little Theatres and Poetic Plays  Other plays by modern poets produced by Mr Browne are Rupert Brooke s dark tragedy Lithuania Gibson s Womenkind Lord Dunsany s Lost Silk Hat Mrs Frank s Jael three short plays by Mrs Aldis a gay comedy by Alice Brown and Mr Browne s own King of the Jews The list should be longer and more adventurous perhaps and one might wish that the curtain had rung down on a more experimental play than Candida But the record of the Chicago Little Theatre is a proud one and fundamental in any consideration of the new dramatic movement as the authors of four recent books on the subject agree  I intended to discuss the work in poetic drama done by some of the other little theatres but space forbids more than a brief mention In Chicago the Peers Workshop tried numerous experiments last year among them Brown by Maxwell Bodenheim and William Saphier which beautifully symbolized the growth and final obliteration of life on earth and a fanciful thing called The Wonder hat by Kenneth Goodman and Ben Hecht This year the Workshop s successor the Philistine Theatre has given two poetic plays one Dead Eyes by H H Ewers being tiresomely conventional and the other Lady Lotus Eyes by Benjamin Purrington of San Francisco a delicate Japanese idyl delicately played The Philistine hopes for a new theatre on the North Side next year and an ambitious group on the far South Side has been given possession of a disused schoolhouse in which to develop its large plans  In New York the Washington Square Players were I believe first in the field if we except the Neighborhood   Playhouse on the East Side I saw them give a good performance of Zoë Akins rather lyrical melodrama in verse The Magical City and other interesting one acters But this company having gone over to Broadway is now somewhat tempted by the fat god of commerce To the Portmanteau Players also of New York though they have been lingering in Chicago with that gold mine Seventeen to them and their director Stuart Walker we owe the adequate introduction of Lord Dunsany to this country as well as other high services  The Provincetown Players and the Greenwich Village Players are the latest adventurers in New York the former in MacDougal Street the latter in that new Montmartre Sheridan Square The former have given this year James Oppenheim s Night a poetic dialogue in which Science Religion Poetry and finally Love in the person of her husband try to console a woman for the loss of her child also two satires in poetic prose by Messrs Bodenheim and Saphier The Provincetown company under the presidency of George Cram Cook formerly of Chicago is a true workshop giving only first productions of native plays We rejoice to hear that its seating capacity has been strained The Greenwich Villagers have given one poetic play thus far and that rather conventional Behind the Watteau Picture by Robert E Rogers  The Arts and Crafts Theatre of Detroit under the directorate of Sam Hume is the first theatre in America to follow consistently perhaps too consistently the Gordon   Little Theatres and Poetic Plays  Craig ideas and it has the finest modern scenic equipment including a sky dome But its repertory thus far is rather conservative  Mrs Laura Sherry has been adventurous with the Wisconsin Players giving this year Carlos Among the Candles and another by Wallace Stevens in both Wisconsin and New York Aline Barnsdall has tried some interesting experiments in Los Angeles Thomas Wood Stevens formerly of Chicago has now a great opportunity as director of the Dramatic Arts Department of the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh but a few plays by Kenneth Sawyer Goodman are the only modern experiments he has tried thus far Baltimore Duluth Boston even Philadelphia also certain universities are contributing more or less to the movement it is impossible even to mention all the little companies and clubs Let the good work go on H M  AMERICAN VERSE AND ENGLISH CRITICS  I wish English critics who discuss American poetry would provide themselves with the evidence Mr Edward Garnett in his Critical Notes on American Poetry published in the Atlantic makes no mention of Carl Sandburg or Vachel Lindsay and his estimate of Ezra Pound s work is based on juvenilia nothing later than 1911 though Mr Pound s work is published on the other side and might easily have been obtained Mr Garnett has been told that he is at his best in his translations from the Chinese And with this casual remark he rests his case against Mr Pound   It would not be so bad if the English critics Mr Garnett is not the first of them told us something new something that we do not already know or if their grasp of the subject were equal to their willingness to take long range shots without the assistance of a range finder But the chief impression gained from Mr Garnett s article is that he is uninformed or that he has been misinformed by mis representative guide books such as Mr Braithwaite s Annual Anthology of Magazine Verse and kindred blue books He says some interesting things some vital things in connection with the poetry of what he calls the transition period following Whitman and it is to this period that his criticism belongs He has hardly progressed beyond it It tempers one feels his reactions to contemporary American poetry  The fact is that English critics have not glimpsed the direction in which American poetry is moving It is creating a new diction a new idiom and it is going to be a much more fluid thing than they have any idea of It is on the score of diction that the American poets are said chiefly to err and it is on this very score that they are going to move away from their critics Carl Sandburg uses the English language as if it were a new instrument Vachel Lindsay and Edgar Lee Masters are not writing poems that will stack up with some already conceived model of good style or social form in English verse but poetry that will fit and respond to the conditions of their own life and place  When Mr Garnett says that the American poets lack distinction of style is he not thinking of a style with which   American Verse and English Critics  he is already familiar And when he says that they lack literary humus must not the emphasis be placed upon literary  Never I think have the American poets been so securely rooted in their native soil If one examines an anthology of contemporary English poetry the Annual of New Poetry recommended by Mr Garnett one finds a prevailing note of withdrawal or of remoteness from the concerns of contemporary life And this precisely is what is not characteristic of contemporary American poetry Our most distinctive verse is at present so much concerned with American life and so much a part of it that it may be said to be becoming genuinely national something that one does not find true of English poetry today for what is national in contemporary English poetry is not of today but of a century or more ago Whatever enrichment English poetry has had lately has been from outside sources not from within One does not feel the lack of literary humus in English poetry but one feels sometimes that the soil is a little weary a little sterile from having been so many times reworked without sufficient nutriment from life  Of course what Mr Garnett says of the adulterate literary style of the vast majority contemporary with Whitman and a vast majority todav is true the combination of a borrowed literary style imported from England and the native image is incongruous But and this Mr Garnett does not see it is the native image that is going to win out the native image that we are beginning to treasure That   is why our poetry is now for the first time beginning to have  roots  Mr Garnett begins his article with a very curious pre  mise the premise that English poets inherit advantages  denied their American brothers He says  The English literary soil has been fructified by the germs of poetic associations since the days of Chaucer Indeed not only were the Elizabethans inspired by the riches of the mediaeval world and the Renaissance but elements of the rich compost of the buried civilizations carried into Britain by the invading Celts Romans and Teutonic tribes reappear in the literary magic of Shakespearian drama  Just why this literary inheritance belongs exclusively to the English poet and not to his American brother who lives in the backwoods and still has hand to hand encounters with painted savages vet also possesses a few books is not explained  It is not because of a lack of background that the American poet differs from his English contemporary Why should not the American scene and many generations of American life tend to change one s reactions to the historic literary background When have backgrounds remained static and not receded from the middle to a possibly remote distance Yet whenever a poet or a critic boldly emphasizes a new middle distance say at the expense of one that has been pushed further back it is commonly assumed that that poet or critic has no background It is much easier to find fault with a critic on this score than on the score of failing to appreciate the thing that is pushing back the middle distance and creating a new foreground Thus I have had to suffer recently the implication of having no background because not suffi   American Verse and English Critics  ciently responsive to the literary appeal of Ralph Hodgson s poems Yet neither of the two critics who publicly upbraided me has noted the negative quality of Mr Garnett s criticism of American poetry If my reaction to English poetry is so obviously tempered by provincialism and a supposed dullness of response to the beauty of rhyme and all that is classic in English verse why not expose the unexpansive narrowness of Mr Garnett s vision of American poetry  It is not that the American poet can not write like his English contemporary but that he does not want to It is not that one does not recognize the excellence of an achieved literary style but that one may be more interested in a more poignant reality  Mr Garnett devotes more attention to the faults of Mr Masters least successful obviously early poems than he does to an appraisal of the highly original quality of the best poems in his later books He is more interested in calling attention to certain tedious unnecessary lines in some of these poems than in proclaiming the new drift of ore But if one turns from these to the poems of Mr W W Gibson in the recommended Annual of New Poetry in which we find not only lines but whole poems that are tedious and unnecessary and in which one looks in vain for that distinction of style said to be lacking in American poetry what must one think of Mr Garnett s comparative criticism  And what we may ask ourselves is the value of criticism which tells us all that we already know of the faults of American verse but does not approximate any true under   standing of its unique features If it tells us merely that American verse is different from English verse and therefore poor can we believe it If it tells us after a due consideration of all the evidence that American verse has not yet achieved its ideal or attained quite clearly to a full perception of its direction then we may begin to listen to it But the English critics have not looked for any direction They have thought of Whitman as an isolated phenomenon and have only recognized as his successors those who have borrowed his clothing and who are not really his successors at all Unless one recognizes the new autochthonic note in American poetry today in the most distinctive American poetry that is one realizes nothing of the subtle impulses and forces that are at work to create a new poetic environment for the coming generation And if one fails to recognize this one might just as well not write about American poetry at all A C H  ON BEING REVIEWED  I was recently asked to review a book I must confess this the highest compliment I ever attained to Reviewing a book presupposes with the average American mind a clear eminence in the personality of the critic I don t possess He stands above the book and the hypothetical public between which and the author he suspends his opinion Naturally I declined the invitation  Had my friend asked me to have the book review me this apologia would not exist To be reviewed by a poem   On Being Reviewed  to be played through by a sonata to be twisted into an arbitrary shape and burnt by symbols it is necessary for one to be a sheet of foolscap five veins of blood a lump of clay Have you ever permitted yourself to be read by Wallace Stevens Three Travellers Have you ever felt the spiritualized fingers of Robert Franz carefully trace one of his Tanagra modelled songs over your being Has an Indian squaw urged you blindly to her belief by dyeing your common clay to yellow or coral streaked with black signs Do you know what it is to be as helpless before art as a cloud to a wind or a wind to a cloud Do you know what it is to be resurrected from the death of being wholly oneself from the existence of being oneself to the life of  being every body spirit and thing near or foreign And no two the same And no one ever resembling you Do you know you for example who aren t religious what a faith is while you listen to Christ Mohammed or Buddha you who are no poet what a poet you are when Whitman or Nietzsche mesmerizes your every faculty you who never attended a conservatory what a supreme music maker you are under Bach or Debussy you who couldn t name the primary colors what it is to be Botticelli or Cézanne you who never pondered a riddle what a philosopher and scientist you are whether Plato or Darwin Do you know atom how universal you are mole you can see deaf mute hear dumb brute sing  Then you know why I cannot review a book Whenam able to say I am Rabelais I am Schopenhauer I am Jane   Austen I am So and so mayhap I ll try creative criticism But as long as I have to say Rabelais Schopenhauer Jane Austen So and so they are not I I cannot even have a book review me There is one obstacle between them and me I still love see feel myself beyond all else I cannot review them nor they me Are you the fool I am Is it possible a poem a song a bowl a human cannot transform you from the I am I to an I am you  Alfred Kreymborg  REVIEWS  STILL ALIVE  The Chinese Nightingale and Other Poems by Vachel  Lindsay Macmillan Co  This book like others by its author is of uneven quality Opening it at the Epitaphs for Two Players one wonders why the poet is satisfied with the obvious in meaning and rhythm at The Tiger Tree one wonders whether his fancy his love of symbolic color and incrustation is to lead him into mere confusion without intelligible pattern Simplicity becomes childish at times and gorgeousness a bit theatrical  One must select one must get in ahead of Time and play his part One must resist the seductions of the immediate moment this volcanic moment of war and of the subject subjects like Mark Twain prairies and buffaloes Kerensky Niagara which move us whether the poet enriches them or not We must search for Mr Lindsay s peculiar and individual magic does he still control his instrument   Still Alive  Mr Conrad Aiken in a recent review of this book says no With athletic alacrity he digs Mr Lindsay s grave and pronounces a would be mournful hic jacet It is never pleasant he sighs to have to set the seal of death on the brow that inclines for a crown and then proceeds to show what a poor thing even at his best was the poet he has buried how curiously overestimated was Booth how full of childish echolalia was The Congo two declamatory and orotund poems which let me see Mr Yeats has ventured to praise And now alas even his charm and skill as an entertainer are denied the new book is only a tired and spiritless echo etc  Nevertheless in spite of this nimble critic we need not yet despair of the Springfield bard If the new book contained only its title poem it would still be a record of growth The Chinese Nightingale has beauty of form a certain compactness and completeness beyond any other of its author s longer poems and in the molding of it his rarest qualities of whimsicality rhythmic invention humane intuition the very feeling of men and myths and best of all a profound ecstatic love of life are blended as happily as the colors of an old Chinese bowl The thing is so simple and shapely that its subtle beauty escapes Mr Aiken and critics of his calibre even as the soft loveliness of a Sung dynasty painting escapes an eye accustomed to the flare of Japanese prints The poem glows in the mind and increases in beauty No one can have read it more than I in manuscript proof and print but I find it finer   now than when POETRY first offered it to the world and crowned it with the Levinson Prize  But the title poem is not all One feels the march of races and nations in certain poems of this book I speak not so much of Kerensky though there is a big blare of trumpets and rush of flags in this greeting to new Russia still less of The Ghosts of the Buffaloes which somehow misses its effect But in Pocahontas and some of the negro poems there is a sweeping grandeur of design extremely rare in modern poetry Pocahontas grows to epic stature as the source and symbol of our love of the wilds  In Adams Street and Jefferson Flames coming up from the ground  She is exalted into a myth and becomes the common mother of our many races of pioneers  And John Brown also already half mythical grows into grandeur under Mr Lindsay s wand Who else with such simple motions can create immensities  I ve been to Palestine  What did you see in Palestine  Old John Brown Old John Brown And there he sits To judge the world His hunting dogs At his feet are curled His eyes half closed But John Brown sees The ends of the earth The Day of Doom And his shot gun lies Across his knees   Still Alive  Old John Brown Old John Brown  Indeed the Booker Washington Trilogy and Samson are not only extraordinarily imaginative as expressions of the art instinct of a more primitive race but they strip us all of sophistications bring us back to primitive simplicities They have what the advanced modern art movement is aiming at everywhere a bold and broadly balanced composition of rhythmic figures done in strong lines and masses of color And they use always our own jargon our own gesture Without aping any style of the past they have style  There is more than a Negro poem game in King Solomon and much more than a Negro sermon in Samson Any one who seeks for big adventure in modern poetry should be swept along with Samson when he felt a honey in his soul  For me the value of this new book is chiefly in these poems I have mentioned However some of the shorter poems should have a word especially The Flower of Mending as even Mr Aiken agrees  And I cannot close without a protest against the typography of King Solomon with its quite unnecessary effect of chopped up lines General Booth and The Congo were also battered out of shape in earlier books by similar tasteless printing H M   WIND IN THE CORN  The Wind in the Corn and Other Poems by Edith Franklin  Wyatt D Appleton amp Co  My songs may never in the world tell to the listener the chords that I can hear them singing says the poet in her preface But she is wrong her songs do express what she hears at least they express her rapture her sense of sweeping rhythms in the vast open spaces of her country and in the life of its populous cities The book in short expresses a personality one of singular vividness and fire one strong enough to draw deep breaths of joy and walk in high places without fear  The spirit of this poet is so free that one forgives her for fettering it sometimes with too intricate rhyme schemes One feels this fettering a little in the title poem still more in Niagara perhaps even in Winter Wheat and a few others poems in which the pattern intervenes so as to force the reader s attention away from its motive Miss Wyatt loves rhyme a bit too well perhaps at least in certain poems her plans for it are not wrought out to an effect of complete unconsciousness  In others however she attains this effect One of the most fortunate in this respect is On the Shore in which the light fall of syllables chimes as happily as temple bells and calls the wandering will as alluringly in which also a refrain is used with haunting beauty And she hears the call of the West We feel the swift step of the roamer in On the Great Plateau An Arizona Wind and Overland   Wind in the Corn  we feel it also in the city poems especially City Whistles and the beautiful City Afternoon both of which are full of wind and space We feel it even in An Unknown Country for sleep leads her into the deepest most spacious country of all  Where do I go  Down roads of sleep  Behind the blue rimmed day  A certain spaciousness is perhaps Miss Wyatt s special quality Free winds blow through her poems winds of the desert of the mountains of our cobalt skies She goes light footed wherever they blow and follows them with special joy through the magic ranges of our southwestern wonderland On the Great Plateau and An Arizona Wind both express this joy in the wilderness and make us feel the march of day and night through its open aisles of color Even in cities she does not get under roof though she is never inhuman or cold toward fellow mortals But she seems most at home out in the open  The crystal air of happiness Flew where their voices cried The winds that slipped their hands in mine Swift running by my side  H M  MR OPPENHEIM S BOOK  The Book of Self by James Oppenheim Alfred A Knopf  There is a kind of person in the world who has to discover everything for himself as if he were the first one to live He cannot take anyone s word for what is anyone else s experience but his own Of such is Mr Oppenheim   and The Book of Self recounts the author s performance of taking apart human nature not to see the wheels go round for speculation or mere amusement but to determine if they are running in the way they are supposed to be running and to catalogue the spokes As if life were only to be understood by analysis and you could not be sure that you grew unless you pulled yourself up by the roots These analyzers these searchers and uprooters what good have they of their search There is one of them I have known a long time and we often ponder the question Refusing to walk in any footsteps but their own traveling the road its whole length  so fearlessly and eagerly what do they find out What at last but that which everybody else knew all the while The Book of Self discovers that human nature the Self is egoistic as well as altruistic that it is subject to contradictions and to self deception as to its aims and motives that man may not be wholly animal nor wholly god and it solves the problems these discoveries present to be solved by accepting them What has been the gain for the reader then if after many pages the author brings him to the place from which minds untroubled with analyzing naturally start out to conclusions which for the rest of the world constitute the premises of life What has been achieved For the author conviction and the relief of utterance for the reader psychology if he likes psychology but if he looked for poetry he will come away with hands almost empty  Following The Book of Self is The Song of Life an allegorical narrative poem which flows along so smoothly through   Mr Oppenheim s Book  its fifty stanzas in a style so admirably adjusted to narrative purpose and conditions that one regrets the author should not be telling us a regular story in which the youth is a youth and not Youth in the abstract and the sweethearts are sweethearts and the mother is not a symbol but really the mother It is seldom one finds a pleasing narrative style in verse the form so easily grows monotonous or sounds artificial Mr Oppenheim s is both varied and natural  The second half of this volume is devoted to an allegorical work called Creation Some readers will recall its Prologue as having first appeared in The Seven Arts a kind of pageant of the world from its birth out of the sun and the emergence of man from the ape through the human dynasties and epochs down to the present day  So has the glimpse been given  Of all man knows of his coming hence  That epic writ in his Earth and in his body   Chasmic unorganized forces shaped into Man  And out of it the brief canto of historic times  The Prologue over a series of stage scenes follows reminiscent of the symbolism in Andreyev s Life of Man Except for the Epilogue and one or two other portions Creation has very little poetic appeal Mr Oppenheim seems to be most fully a poet when he is writing prose The editorials in that beautiful magazine of his The Seven Arts were more stirring poetry than any in this book they made us know more of self and life and man of ourselves and of America and of Mr Oppenheim H H   DIVINATIONS  Divinations and Creation by Horace Holley Mitchell  Kennerley  A delicate touch upon certain elusive human relations certain subtleties of human psychology has this young poet and dreamer Our readers no doubt observed this over a year ago in the tragic narrative Crosspatch here reprinted through the storm of which emerge two characters of high but ruined nobility But perhaps The Meeting which gives a situation rather than a story is even more intuitive  Rarely have I read a first book of poems so keen with spiritual passion Th e poet feels more than he can say perhaps but the beauty he divines and dreams is joy and pain to him emotion that makes life an almost impossible ecstasy  Then I fell Upon the knees that are no more my knees And with a voice that is no more my voice I cried a cry the single thing I am As one will cry whose house has fallen down For help to raise the ruin and go free And like the cry I fled outside myself And died like echo on the farthest hill  If the poet s art fails him often if we have turgid lines that seem to crush the fine ones we may reasonably hope for more assured control in his next book Indeed the worst failures Ecstasy for example are among the Post impressionist Poems written in 1913 The later work shows finer taste and a more stript and clarified style H M   The Yeats Letters  THE YEATS LETTERS Passages from the Letters of John Butler Yeats selected by  Ezra Pound Cuala Press Dundrum Ireland  I make no excuse for reviewing this small book which I myself have edited I have been through the matter more often than any other critic or reviewer is likely to go through it and I am in at least that degree more fit to praise it  This book is priceless because for the first time a detached critic without temper writing not for the public but simply to a member of his own family privately without any tinge of didacticism without hoping or thinking to convince anyone holding hostile opinion has defined and described America  I know of no modern book which contains so much good sense about poetry Good sense is perhaps too plain and prosaic a term there is a rich humanity in this old man s writing a freedom from the curse of Wordsworth and the Victorian era and an equal freedom from the petulance of our decade  Poetry is the last refuge and asylum of the individual of whom oratory is the enemy Imagination is the faculty by which truth is made real to the sentient man There is no use in my excerpting definitions for they will lose value taken apart from their context they will become current coin parrot phrases they will not induce a realization of John Yeats poetic philosophy and there is in these letters a whole and sound poetic philosophy There is in them a cure for our age and our country a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  cure for all the infection left over from Wordsworth and Carlyle and Arnold and there is in them a humanity no less rich than Remy DeGourmont s a very different humanity  I wonder if more of us would be as wise as this Nestor could we live so long think so much and publish so little  I keep reading the book backwards and forwards for the thirtieth and fortieth time delighted with the aptness of the diagnosis the erasing one can not call it destruction of literary idols and bogies which one had always known instinctively to be wrong which had been thrust upon one ad nauseum and which had only thrown one into a temper One s own attempts to eliminate them had been unconvincing incoherence And yet how easy it seems as in this passage  The supremacy of the will power infers the malediction of human nature that has cursed English life and English letters Bunyan foremost in the malediction movement He would have called Hamlet Mr Facing Both ways and Juliet Mistress Bold face or Carnality and Romeo Mr Lovelorn and Macbeth Mr Henpecked etc finding where he could epithets to belittle and degrade the temple of human nature and all its altars  I am haunted by single lines plucked here and there by infallible instinct there is no critic like the memory Wordsworth would not have made the homicidal Achilles lovable Aeschylus Athena is not beautiful till we see her timid with the Furies Because of his passion for truth the man with a poetical mind dislikes improvisation  I might go on until I had quoted most of the book for it is compact of such succinct formulations each full of persuasiveness and not one strained toward an epigram   The Yeats Letters  Of course they interpret Whitman literally as a few years ago they did the Bible the same lunacy in another form And Mr Yeats puts his finger thus on Browning s defect He tended away from the true mood of the whole man into the false mood of the idea But a stricture of this sort against Browning must be balanced by the concurrent praise of Aeschylus and Dostoievsky before it can convey all of Mr Yeats meaning The book is full of wisdom E P  A BACK NUMBER Retrogression and Other Poems by William Watson John Lane Co  Pencraft a Plea for the Older Ways by William Watson John Lane Co Is it possible that there is any writer living in these war  vivid days who can open his book of alleged poems with bombast like this Our daughters flower in vernal grace In strength our striplings wax apace Our cities teem our commerce rides Sovereign upon the fawning tides  A few pages further along we find this pearl of song and  criticism entitled The Sexes of Song  First in the empire of the Muse Are the broad athletes the all male Who from their cradles had the thews That unwithstandably prevail  But many a province she possesses Rich in fair manors and proud seats Bestowed on such great poetesses As Shelley and June hearted Keats   Mr Watson has it in for modern English He waxes apace throughout this slender volume and moved by the  perfections of his own style grows sarcastically admonitory Shun if thou wouldst by men be heard  The comely phrase the well born word Well we are willing to pass over these poems to that super critic Time in whom their author thus nobly expresses  Confidence  When criticasters of a day Seem to have sneered me quite away  When with a pontiff s frown  Some dabbler puts me down  Then draining mine appointed cup In patience do I gird me up  Knowing that Time one day  All his arrears will pay  Pencraft is the kind of criticism one would expect from this kind of poet The man whose best art has been mere echoes is always the one in despair over the art of his own time and all the influences which inspire it To Mr Watson Whitman is the boisterous and shaggy barbarian of Brooklyn Villon is a member of the dangerous classes with a knack of writing and Blake the wielder of a most unsure and infirm pen And he gently but firmly puts American literature in its place reminding us of a time when it saw no shame in bearing some such relation to the literature of Great Britain as that of Rome bore to that of Greece and condoling with us because the change from this attitude of filial piety has produced only verse which can perhaps be best described as an uncouth sincerity   A Back Number  Why do we pause over such fulminations Because they have been taken seriously in Britain and the States by certain readers critics and audiences Because Mr Watson has toured this country lecturing and reading from his works to literary circles women s clubs and even colleges who naively seemed to think they had captured a real poet of reputation and authority Because well because
