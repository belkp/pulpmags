CRISIS, THE CRISIS Vol. 15-No. 6 APRIL, 1918 Whole No. 90 Editorial LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT IT IS just an old lantern, filled with grimy oil. It cannot lead anywhere, yet its light leads. Its golden light streams throughout the night. Whose is the light? It is not the lantern's. It simply seems to be the lantern's radiance. It is the Light of the World and it leads not toward the millenium in the North, but out of the insult and prostitution and ignorance and lies and lynchings of the South—up toward a chance, a new chance,— nothing more. But thank God for that. The United States Department of Labor has been doing all it can to put this light out. Long since it stopped helping Negroes to find jobs in the North. Lately it has forbidden firms from advertising for southern labor. More lately it has begun what may prove a new slavery of 100,000 workers from the West Indies. We have asked for justice from this Department of the Government; we have asked not for jobs but for representation with power; the answer lingers. Lead, Kindly Light. . ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND. WE ARE publishing 100,000 copies of the Easter CRISIS and indications are that we shall sell the whole edition. This is no small physical accomplishment. End to end these copies would extend fifteen miles and the pages end to end would reach from Boston to Baltimore. The weight of the edition sent through the mails will be nearly ten tons. And yet, this is but a fair begin ning. It is not too much to ask for one million readers of THE CRISIS and toward this we are aiming. Meantime, there comes the insistent and proper question: "Why does not THE CRISIS do its own printing and presswork?" The answer is: We shall at the first possible moment. But it must be remembered that to print a magazine of this quality and circulation would call for an expenditure of capital larger than we can now afford. Nevertheless, we have already taken steps looking toward a future when we shall not only manufacture and publish TH E CRISIS, but do a general publishing business. The income of TH E CRISIS last year was nearly $33,000. Half of this was spent in publishing and over $9,000 in salaries. THE CRISIS is still out of debt with a net worth December 31, 1917, of $8,586. Thank you. ATTENTION. FIELD ARTILLERY has be come a highly specialized instrument of great precis ion. Front line trenches are frequently less than a hundred yards apart and nothing discourages your own infantry more than to receive a shell that was intended for the next trench. When the men of the 92nd Division go "over the top" they will frequently follow an accompanying barrage as close as a hundred yards. Now that "curtain of fire" behind which colored soldiers will move to 267 THE CRISIS THE ASSAULT OF BRUTAL GERMAN LINES WILL BE LAID DOWN BY THE FIRST FIELD GUNS EVER MANNED BY COLORED AMERICAN SOLDIERS. EVERY NEGRO IN THE UNITED STATES IS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT THE ARTILLERY OF THE 92ND DIVISION BECOMES AS EFFICIENT AN ORGANIZATION AS THE TENTH CAVALRY, FOR INSTANCE, OF WHICH EVERY COLORED AMERICAN IS JUSTLY PROUD. THE 167TH FIELD ARTILLERY BRIGADE IS TREMENDOUSLY HANDICAPPED TODAY BECAUSE THE DRAFT HAS FAILED TO BRING IN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF EDUCATED AND TECHNICALLY TRAINED MEN TO FILL THE SPECIAL DETAILS AND ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS. THE COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE ARTILLERY BRIGADE DESIRES AT ONCE TO SECURE THE FOLLOWING SPECIALISTS : FORTY-FOUR Telephone men WHO HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE AT INSTALLING AND OPERATING TELEPHONES, WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF ELEMENTARY ELECTRICITY. SIXTY-ONE Instrument men WITH AT LEAST A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. THEY WILL BE TRAINED TO USE THE BATTERY COMMANDER'S TELESCOPE, AIMING CIRCLE, RANGE FINDER, AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS SIMILAR TO SURVEYORS' AND ENGINEERS' INSTRUMENTS. CIVIL ENGINEERS ARE PARTICULARLY DESIRED FOR THIS WORK. FORTY-FOUR Scouts, HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES, IF POSSIBLE, WHO HAVE HAD SOME INSTRUCTION IN DRAFTING AND MAPPING AND CAN LEARN TO DO RECON NAISSANCE WORK. FORTY-SIX Typists AND 12 Stenog raphers TO DO CLERICAL WORK IN BRI GADE AND REGIMENTAL HEADQUARTERS, AND BATTERY OFFICES. THIRTY-ONE Mechanics WHO CAN KEEP THE GUNS AND MOTORS IN REPAIR, MEN WITH EXPERIENCE AS MACHINISTS OR MILLWRIGHTS. EIGHTEEN Saddlers TO REPAIR HAR NESS AND SADDLES. FORTY-SEVEN Horse-shoers. TEN Radio OR Telegraph Operators.

TO ALL OF THE ABOVE WHO PROVE COMPETENT, POSITIONS ARE OPEN CARRYING THE RANK OR THE PAY OF NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS: $36-$3 8 A MONTH AND SUPPORT. IN ADDITION THERE ARE NEEDED: FORTY Hospital attendants, MEN HAVING A KNOWLEDGE OF FIRST AID OR PREVIOUS HOSPITAL EXPERIENCE. THIRTEEN Truck drivers WHO UNDERSTAND AUTOMOBILE REPAIRS. MEN FROM 18 TO 40 YEARS OF AGE ARE ELIGIBLE. ANYONE DESIRING TO ENLIST SHOULD WRITE TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL, 167TH FIELD ARTILLERY BRIGADE, 92ND DIVISION, CAMP DIX, NEW JERSEY, STATING AGE, EDUCATION, AND EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASS APPLIED FOR.

For a moment we thought that the general's life had been saved, when all at once a number of soldiers smashed open the door and rushed into the ear. They seized Dukhonin by the shoulders, pushed him out on the car steps, and then down to the station platform. Krylenko ran after them. At the sight of the general there was an outbreak of yells. "Kill him at once!" the mob shouted. "It is enough that Kerensky and Korniloff have got away from us. This must be beaten down on the spot." The crowd began to surge closer around Dukhonin. In vain Krylenko shouted orders and entreaties; he was not heard. Rifle-butts flew up into the air. Then came a dreadful sight. Krylenko entreated the mob to spare the unhappy man, but out from the crowd jumped a tall sailor, whose cap bore the name of the cruiser Aurora, and shoved Krylenko back. "Look here, you, if you mix into this business, we will settle with you, too." Then, with a single blow of his musket, he beat Dukhonin to the ground. The General immediately leaped up, his face bathed in blood, and tried to speak, but he was immediately transfixed by a dozen bayonets, and then upon that bloody body a fury of blows from rifle butts and heavy boots descended. The crowd fought to get nearer to the corpse. It was stripped of every stitch of clothing. Scenes of grotesque horror were enacted. Two soldiers, having each snatched one of the General's boots, fell upon each other with curses and blows. Finally, the body, entirely naked, was propped up against the railway car and, laughing like madmen, the crowd gave itself up to a series of monstrous amusements. Sailors. Red Guards, and soldiers threw snowballs and mud at the head of the dead man. —New York Evening Post. AMERICA. Jim McIlherron, the Negro who shot and killed Pierce Rodgers and Jesse Tigert, two white men at Estill Springs, last Friday, and wounded Frank Tigert, was tortured with a red-hot crowbar and then burned to death here to-night at 7:40 by twelve masked men. A crowd of approximately 2,000 persons, among whom were women and children, witnessed the burning. McIlherron, who was badly wounded and unable to walk, was carried to the scene of the murder, where preparation for a funeral pyre was begun. The captors proceeded to a spot about a quarter of a mile from the railroad station and prepared the death fire. The crowd followed and remained throughout the horrible proceedings. The Negro was led to a hickory tree, to which they chained him. After securing him to the tree a fire was laid. A short distance away another fire was kindled, and into it was put an iron bar to heat. When the bar became red hot a member of the mob jabbed it toward the Negro's body. Crazed with fright, the black grabbed hold of it, and as it was pulled through his hands the atmosphere was filled with the odor of burning flesh. This was the first time the murderer gave evidence of his will being broken. Scream after scream rent the air. As the hot iron was applied to various parts of his body his yells and cries for mercy could be heard in the town. After torturing the Negro several minutes one of the masked men poured coal oil on his feet and trousers and applied a match to the pyre. As the flames rose, enveloping the black's body, he begged that he be shot. Yells of derision greeted his request. The angry flames consumed his clothing and little blue blazes shot upward from his burning hair before he lost consciousness. — Chattanooga DailyTimes. MINE EYES HAVE SEEN By Alice M. Dunbar-Nelson A PLAY IN ONE ACT. (Rights of Reproduction reserved.) CHARACTERS. Dan: The Cripple. Chris: The Younger Brother. Lucy: The Sister. Mrs. O'Neill: An Irish Neighbor. Jake: A Jewish Boy. Julia: Chris' Sweetheart. Bill Harvey: A Muleteer. Cornelia Lewis: A Settlement Worker. Time: Now Place: A manufacturing city in the northern part of the United States. SCENE. Kitchen of a tenement. All details of fur nishing emphasize sordidness— laundry tubs, range, table covered with oil cloth, pine chairs. Curtain discloses Dan in a rude imitation of a steamer chair, propped by faded pillows, his feet covered with a patch-work quilt. Practicable window at back. , LUCY is bustling about the range prepar ing a meal. During the conversation she moves from range to table, setting latter and making ready the noon-day meal. Dan is about thirty years old; face thin, pinched, bearing traces of suffering. His hair is prematurely gray; nose finely chis elled; eyes wide, as if seeing BEYOND. Complexion brown. LUCY is slight, frail, brown-skinned, about twenty, with a pathetic face. She walks with a slight limp. Dan : ISN'T IT MOST TIME FOR HIM TO COME HOME, LUCY? LUCY: IT'S HARD TO TELL, DANNY, DEAR; CHRIS DOESN'T COME HOME ON TIME ANY MORE. IT'S HALF-PAST TWELVE, AND HE OUGHT TO BE HERE BY THE CLOCK, BUT YOU CAN'T TELL ANY MORE—YOU CAN'T TELL. Dan : WHERE DOES HE GO? Lucy: I KNOW WHERE HE DOESN'T GO, DAN, BUT WHERE HE DOES, I CAN'T SAY. HE'S NOT GOING TO JULIA'S ANY MORE LATELY. I'M AFRAID, DAN, I'M AFRAID! Dan : O F WHAT, LITTLE SISTER? Lucy: OF EVERYTHING; OH, DAN, IT'S TOO BIG, TOO MUCH FOR ME—THE WORLD OUTSIDE, THE STREET—CHRIS GOING OUT AND COMING HOME NIGHTS MOODY-EYED; I DON'T UNDERSTAND. Dan : AN D SO YOU'RE AFRAID? THAT'S BEEN LUCY THE TROUBLE FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME— WE'RE AFRAID BECAUSE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. Lucy: (Coming down front, with a dish cloth in her hand.) OH, DAN, WASN'T IT BETTER IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN WE WERE BACK HOME—IN THE LITTLE HOUSE WITH THE GARDEN, AND YOU AND FATHER COMING HOME NIGHTS AND MOTHER GETTING SUPPER, AND CHRIS AND I STUDYING LESSONS IN THE DINING-ROOM AT THE TABLE—WE DIDN'T HAVE TO EAT AND LIVE IN THE KITCHEN THEN, AND— Dan: (Grimly.) —AN D THE NOTICES POSTED ON THE FENCE FOR US TO LEAVE TOWN BECAUSE NIGGERS HAD NO BUSINESS HAVING SUCH A DECENT HOME. Lucy: (Unheeding the interruption.) —AN D CHRIS AND I READING THE WONDERFUL BOOKS AND LAYING OUR PLANS— Dan: —TO SEE THEM GO UP IN THE SMOKE OF OUR BURNED HOME. LUCY: (Continuing, her back to Dan, her eyes lifted, as if seeing a vision of retrospect.) —AN D EVERYONE PETTING ME BECAUSE I HAD HURT MY FOOT WHEN I WAS LITTLE, AND FATHER— 271 272 TH E CRISIS Dan : —Shot down like a dog for daring to defend his home— Lucy: —Calling me "Little Brown Princess," and telling mother— Dan : —Dead of pneumonia and. heart break in this bleak climate. Lucy: —That when you— Dan : Maimed for life in a factory of hell! Useless—useless—broken on the wheel. (His voice breaks in a dry sob.) Lucy: (Coming out of her trance, throws aside the dish-cloth, and running to Dan, lays her cheek against his and strokes his hair.) Poor Danny, poor Danny, forgive me, I'm selfish. Dan: Not selfish, Little Sister, merely natural. {Enter roughly and unceremoniously Chris. He glances at the two with their arms about each other, shrugs his shoulders, hangs up his rough cap and mackinaw on a nail, then seats himself at the table, his shoulders hunched up: his face dropping on his hand. Lucy approaches him timidly.) Lucy: Tired, Chris? Chris: No. Lucy: Ready for dinner? Chris : If it is ready for me. Lucy: (Busies herself bringing dishes to the table.) You're late to-day. Chris : I have bad news. My number was posted today. Lucy: Number? Posted? (Pauses with a plate in Iter hand.) Chris: I'm drafted. Lucy: (Drops plate with a crash. Dan leans forward tensely, his hands gripping the arms of his chair.) Lucy: Oh, it can't be! They won't take you from us! And shoot you down, too? What will Dan do? Dan: Never mind about me, Sister. And you're drafted, boy? Chris: Yes—yes—but (He rises and strikes the table heavily with his hand.) I'm not going. Dan : Your duty Chris : —Is here with you. I owe none elsewhere, I'll pay none. Lucy: Chris! Treason! I'm afraid! Chris: Yes, of course, you're afraid, Lit tle Sister, why shouldn't you be? Haven't you had your soul shrivelled with fear since we were driven like dogs from our home? And for what? Because we were living like Christians. Must I go and fight for the nation that let my father's murder go unpunished? That killed my mother—that took away my chances for making a man out of myself? Look at us—you—Dan, a shell of a man— Dan: Useless—useless— Lucy: Hush, Chris! Chris: —And me, with a fragment of an education, and no chance—only half a man. And you, poor Little Sister, there's no chance for you; what is there in life for you? No, if others want to fight, let them. I'll claim exemption. Dan: On what grounds? Chris: You—and Sister. I am all you have; I support you. Dan: (Half rising in his chair.) Hush! Have I come to this, that I should be the excuse, the woman's skirts for a slacker to hide behind? Chris: (Clenching his fists.) You call me that? You, whom I'd lay down my. life for? I'm no slacker when I hear the real call of duty. Shall I desert the cause that needs me—you—Sister—• home? For a fancied glory? Am I to take up the cause of a lot of kings and politicians who play with men's souls, as if they are cards—dealing them out, a hand here, in the Somme—a hand there, in Palestine—a hand there, in the Alps—a hand there, in Russia—and because the cards don't match well, call it a misdeal, gather them up, throw them in the discard, and call for a new deal of a million human, suffering souls? And must I be the Deuce of Spades? (During the speech, the door opens sloivly and Jake lounges in. He is a slight, pale youth, Hebraic, thin-lipped, eager-eyed. His hands are in his pockets, his narrow shoulders drawn forward. At the end of Chris' speech he applauds softly.) Jake: Bravo! You've learned the patter well. Talk like the fellows at the Socialist meetings. Dan and Lucy: Socialist meetings! Chris: (Defiantly.) Well? Dan: Oh, nothing; it explains. All right, go on—any more? Jake: Guess he's said all he's got breath for. I'll go; it's too muggy in here. What's the row? MINE EYES HAVE SEEN Chris: I'm drafted. Jake: Get exempt. Easy—if you don't want to go. As for me (Door opens, and Mrs.O'NEILL bustles in. She is in deep mourning, plump, Irish, shrewd-looking, bright-eyed.) Mrs. O'Neill: Lucy, they do be sayin' as how down by the chain stores they be a raid on the potatoes, an' ef ye're wantin' some, ye'd better be after gittin' into yer things an' comin' wid me. I kin kape the crowd off yer game foot—an' what's the matter wid youse all? LUCY: Oh. Mrs. O'Neill, Chris has got to go to war. Mrs. O'Neill: An' ef he has, what of it? Ye'll starve, that's all. D an: Starve? Never! He'll go, we'll live. (LUCY wrings her hands impotently. Mrs. O'Neill drops a protecting arm about the girl's shoulder.) Mrs. O'Neill: An' it's hard it seems to yer? But they took me man from me year before last, an' he wint afore I came over here, an' it's a widder I am wid me five kiddies, an' I've niyer a word to say but— CHRIS: He went to fight for his own. What do they do for my people? They don't want us, except in extremity. They treat us like—like—like— Jake: Like Jews in Russia, eh? (He slouches forward, then his frame straightens itself electrically.) Like Jews in Russia, eh? Denied the right of honor in men, eh? Or the right of virtue in women, eh? There isn't a wrong you can name that your race has endured that mine has not suffered, too. But there's a future, Chris—a big one. We younger ones must be in that future—ready for it, ready for it— (His voice trails off, and he sinks despondently into a chair.) Chris: Future? Where? Not in this country? Where? (The door opens and JULIA rushes in impulsively. She is small, slightly built, eager-eyed, light-brown skin, wealth of black hair; full of sudden shyness.) Julia: Oh, Chris, someone has just told me—I was passing by—one of the girls said your number was called. Oh, Chris, will you have to go? (She puts her arms up to Chris' neck; he removes them gently, and makes a slight gesture towards Dan's chair.) Julia: Oh, I forgot. Dan, excuse me. Lucy, it's terrible, isn't it? Chris: I'm not going, Julia. Mrs. O'Neill: Not going! D an: Our men have always gone, Chris. They went in 1776. Chris: Yes, as slaves. Promised a freedom they never got. Dan : No, gladly, and saved the day, too, many, a time. Ours was the first blood shed on the altar of National liberty. We went in 1812, on land and sea. Our men were through the struggles of 1861 Chris: When the Nation was afraid not to call them. Didn't want 'em at first. Dan : Never mind; they helped work out their own salvation. And they were there in 1898 Chris: Only to have their valor disputed. Dan : —And they were at Carrizal, my boy, and now— Mrs. O'Neill: An' sure, wid a record like that—ah, 'tis me ould man who said at first 'twasn't his quarrel. His Oireland bled an' the work of thim divils to try to make him a traitor nearly broke his heart—but he said he'd go to do his bit—an' here I am. (There is a sound of noise and bustle without, and with a loud laugh, B ill Harvey enters. He is big, muscular, rough, his voice thunderous. He emits cries of joy at seeing the group, shakes hands and claps Chris and Dan on their backs.) DAN: And so you weren't torpedoed? Harvey: No, I'm here for a while—to get more mules and carry them to the front to kick their bit. Mrs. O'Neill: You've been—over there? Harvey: Yes, over the top, too. Mules, rough-necks, wires, mud, dead bodies, stench, terror! Julia (horror-stricken): Ah—Chris! CHRIS: Never, mind, not for mine. Harvey: It's a great life—not. But I'm off again, first chance. Mrs. O'Neill: They're brutes, eh? Harvey: Don't remind me. Mrs. O'Neill (whispering) : They maimed my man, before he died. Julia (clinging to Chris) : Not you, oh, not you! Harvey: They crucified children. D an: Little children? They crucified lit tle children. Chris: Well, what's that to us? They're little white children. But here, our fellow-countrymen throw our little black babies in 274 TH E CRISIS the flames—as did the worshippers of Moloch, only they haven't the excuse of a religious rite. Jake: (Slouches out of his chair, in which he has been sitting brooding.) Say, don't you get tired sitting around grieving because you're colored? I'd be ashamed to be— D an: Stop! Who's ashamed of his race? Ours the glorious inheritance; ours the price of achievement. Ashamed! I'm PROUD. And you, too, Chris, smouldering in youthful wrath, you, too, are proud to be numbered with the darker ones, soon to come into their inheritance. Mrs. O'Neill: Aye, but you've got to fight to keep yer inheritance. Ye can't lay down when someone else has done the work, and expect it to go on. Ye've got to fight. Jake: If you're proud, show it. All of your people—well, look at us! Is there a greater race than ours? Have any people had more horrible persecutions—and yet— we're loyal always to the country where we live and serve. Mrs. O'N eill: And us! Look at us! Dan: (Half tears himself from the chair, the upper part of his body writhing, while the lower part is inert, dead.) Oh, God! If I were but whole and strong! If I could only prove to a doubting world of what stuff my people are made! Julia: But why, Dan, it isn't our quarrel? What have we to do with their affairs? These white people, they hate us. Only today I was sneered at when I went to help with some of their relief work. Why should you, my Chris, go to help those who hate you? (Chris clasps her in his arms, and they stand, defying the others.) Harvey : If you could have seen the babies and girls—and old women—if you could have— (Covers his eyes with his hand.) Chris: Well, it's good for things to be evened up somewhere. Dan: Hush, Chris! It is not for us to visit retribution. Nor to wish hatred on others. Let us rather remember the good that has come to us. Love of humanity is above the small considerations of time or place or race or sect. Can't you be big enough to feel pity for the little crucified French children—for the ravished Polish girls, even as their mothers must have felt sorrow, if they had known, for OUR burned and maimed little ones? Oh, Mothers of Europe, we be of one blood, you and I! (There is a tense silence. Julia turns from Chris, and drops her hand. He moves slowly to the window and looks out. The door opens quietly, and Cornelia Lewis comes in. She stands still a moment, as if sensing a difficult situation.) Cornelia: I've heard about it, Chris, your country calls you. (Chris turns from the window and waves hopeless hands at Dan and Lucy.) Yes, I understand; they do need you, don't they? Dan (fiercely) : No! Lucy: Yes, we do, Chris, we do need you, but your country needs you more. And, above that, your race is calling you to carry on its good name, and with that, the voice of humanity is calling to us all—we can manage without you, Chris. Chris: You? Poor little crippled Sister. Poor Dan— D an: Don't pity me, pity your poor, weak self. Chris: (clenching his fist.) Brother, you've called me two names to day that no man ought to have to take—a slacker and a weakling! D an: True. Aren't you both? (Leans back and looks at CHRIS specula tively.) CHRIS: (Makes an angry lunge towards the chair, then flings his hands above his head in an impatient gesture.) Oh, God! (Turns back to window.) Julia: Chris, it's wicked for them to taunt you so—but Chris—it IS our country —our race— (Outside the strains of music from a passing band are heard. The music comes faintly, gradually growing louder and louder until it readies a crescendo. The tune is "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," played in stirring march time.) Dan: (singing softly.) "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!" Chris: (Turns from the window and straightens his shoulders.) And mine! Cornelia: "A s He died to make men holy, let us die to make them free!" Mrs. O'N eill: An' ye'll make the sacrifice, me boy, an' ye'll be the happier. DESERT-BOUND 275 Jake: Sacrifice!

Break! Break! ye flood-gates of my tears, All pent in agony; Rain! Rain! upon my thirsty soul, And flood it as the sea! A letter from Brazil By Jose Clarana. IN ACCEDING to your request that I send you "one or two letters about the color problems in Brazil," I keep within the limitations of my capacity and comply with your admonition that I "make them as short as possible," by writing one letter with the simple statement that there is no color problem in Brazil. By way of explanation, however, I must add that this does not mean that a black skin is an open-sesame to any and every drawing-room and a shibboleth of easy access to the heart of any maiden and the purse of her father. It means, for one thing, that a man is not necessarily black because his skin is not so white as somebody's else skin. In the terms of the "social equality," which the telegrams say that German spies have been trying to obtain for the not-quite-white-enough in Alabama, it means that the color of the pelts in a drawing-room is the exclusive business of the people who wear them, and that if the son of some gentleman violates the servant girl there is no law to prevent him from marrying her because she does not come up to the popular specifications as to complexion. In a word, in Brazil the mere possession of a white skin does not entitle a man to superior civil rights and opportunities, nor does an increased pigmentation condemn its owner to the status of a pariah. Occasionally an attempt is made in Brazil to establish a standard of whiteness to which all aspirants to a life of the greatest usefulness must conform. Generally, if not always, these attempts to divide the Brazilian people are made by foreign residents. For instance, the son of a, colored teacher was not long ago refused admittance to a college conducted by Belgian priests. I do not know how this affair ended, but the action of the rector of the school was severely criticized by the newspapers. A striking contrast to the attitude of the Belgian friar is the fact that recently one of the largest and wealthiest churches in Rio was crowded with people attending a mass of intercession for the early triumph of the ideals of the Allies, including, of course, those valiant defenders of the rights of oppressed peoples who used to cut off the hands of the natives on the rubber plantations in the Congo. Most of the worshippers at that mass were altogether white and many of them were distinguished foreigners. The celebrant was a colored man, who, when he is not saying mass or singing in the choir of a church, conducts a school whose students are nearly all white. Americans, of course, are not slow in attempting to establish caste discrimination, especially when they first come here. A friend of mine told me, shortly after he arrived here, that the Negroes ought to be separated from the whites in public places. I do not know whether he got that notion so much from having resided in Alabama as from reading The Outlook, which is ashamed to tell the American public that, in trying to show how superior they are to the "niggers," white people have disgraced their civilization by committing acts of savagery unexcelled by the lowest tribes in the heart of Africa. It does not mind libeling the colored people of the States by characterizing as "envy" the natural desire of a decent man to sit in a clean railway carriage or to enter a restaurant without fear of buying a steak fried with spit or sharing the fate of the colored Georgian who, in neutral Chicago, was killed for the crime of unwittingly seating himself at the side of a Texan at a public lunch counter. I got the Chicago story from an eyewitness, the son of a Confederate officer, who told it, with the greatest sang froid, at lunch in a Brazilian boarding-house.mention it here in the hope that some of 276 A LETTER the editors, politicians and counting-house anthropologists who make the color question in the United States and who are really responsible for crimes against civilization and against the good name of the United States like the Waco Horror, may have another concrete example of the effect of the "social equality" humbug in a land where nearly every one has some learning, but too many of the people have only enough to enable them to read a newspaper. Perhaps one reason for the absence of a color question in the countries of South America, where there is any great variation in the color of the inhabitants, is the fact that there are not so many people who can read as in the United States, but, proportionately, more persons who do more than just read, because they have more time, let us say. One of the thinking readers of Brazil and unquestionably one of the greatest intellects of all America, Ruy Barbosa, in speaking of slavery and its consequences in this country, says: "For three generations we were free, prosperous and rich at the cost of the oppression of our fellow-men. We are today undergoing the great expiation which never fails, which does not pardon historic outrages and capital crimes against humanity." The fact that slavery was a crime against humanity and not merely an economic mistake is, I think, something that no important public man in the United States would admit without reserve. In Brazil, it is the essential immorality of the institution, the inherent injustice to its victims, that is most emphasized. The date of the Abolition of Slavery, May 13, is duly commemorated as a national holiday, and there is no effort to reintroduce it in any form. Whatever penalties the nation may now be paying for the original error of importing and maintaining African slaves there is no desire to postpone the day of atonement and increase the sacrifice by aggravating the old offense. A friend of mine, a very likable fellow in himself, assures me that "the only way to handle an American 'nigger' is to knock him on the head and talk to him about it afterward." African blood is, perhaps, as plentiful in the States of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro as in Georgia or Texas, but in a country FROM BRAZIL 277 where great statesmen think and feel that the humblest blacks are their fellow-men, it would not be possible for white men to drag a man through the streets, bleeding from head to foot from the nails and knives thrust into him, burn him, still living, and wear his dead teeth as charms to "keep the 'nigger' in his place." Brazilians are very religious, but they are not quite that superstitious. Among them every one finds his place naturally. If one can afford to travel in a first class public conveyance, no one will attempt to make him go second class and pay first class fare. If a man wants a cup of coffee or a glass of milk or cane-juice, which are the most popular beverages among the Brazilians, who, by the way, are not prohibited from drinking whiskey if they want to, no cafe will refuse to serve him if he is clean and decent. They even serve Americans and Europeans who get drunk so long as these do not offend other people. When the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, whose policy is to be one of approximation to the United States, embraces the lawyer who makes a public address of godspeed and presents the Minister with a gold pen with which to sign his first official act, nobody has any objection to make because the Minister is white and the orator brown. The newspapers do not even mention the color of the people concerned. They never do, except, sometimes, in reporting civil statistics, accidents and crimes. In such cases the person is not called black if the skin is not black. Whether white or mixed, the color is mentioned only once, parenthetically, for identification, and not used to substitute proper nouns and pronouns, in a manifest effort to associate complexion with crime, as in the two inch paragraph I once cut from the New York Times, which contained nine references to the color of a man accused of a commonplace crime. The man, of course, was a Negro, more or less. Nobody wastes any time in the Republic of the Southern Cross in trying to determine the moral and intellectual potentialities of a people by skin color or facial configuration. In this country a man's accomplishments are the measure of his ability. Even before the complete abolition of slavery, the greatest statesman of the Empire was a mulatto. A black of the 27 8 THE CRISIS DEEPEST DYE WAS A COMMANDING FIGURE IN JOURNALISM. TODAY THERE ARE MEN OF NEGRO BLOOD IN THE NATIONAL AND STATE LEGISLATURES, REPRESENTING CITIZENS OF ANY AND ALL HUES. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES OF BRAZIL WOULD BE CALLED A NEGRO IN LAW" AND A "NIGGER" BY CUSTOM IN THE UNITED STATES. IN SHORT, IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE, FROM THE HIGHEST AND MOST USEFUL CALLINGS TO THE HUMBLE AND UNPRODUCTIVE ONE OF BEGGING AND THE LESS HONORABLE BUT LESS PREVALENT ONE OF STEALING, BRAZILIANS ARE ENGAGED, WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE, PURELY BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN OR THEIR GRANDMOTHERS' COLOR. BUT WITHAL WHITE CIVILIZATION IS STILL SUPREME AND IS CONSTANTLY INCREASING ITS POWER AND INFLUENCE, FOR IT IS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL CONSCIENCE OF A PEOPLE PASSIONATELY DEVOTED TO THE PRACTISE OF LIBERTY AND JUSTICE WITHIN THEIR OWN BORDERS AND AMONG THEIR fellow-men. SUCH A CIVILIZATION MUST ALWAYS ENDURE, FOR IT IS ONLY WHEN BETHMAN HOLLWEG DECLARES: "WE'LL KNOCK BELGIANS ON THE HEAD, AND THEN TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT AFTERWARD," THAT WACO BECOMES VERDUN AND WHITE CIVILIZATION COMMITS SUICIDE. THE SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE HAD THEIR WACOS AND VERDUNS, AND FOR THIS REASON THEY ARE NOT ANXIOUS TO PAY MORE THAN THEY CAN HELP OF THE PENALTIES FOR WRONGS DONE UNTO THEM RATHER THAN BY THEM. FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS EUROPEANS, AFRICANS AND AMERICAN ABORIGINES HAVE TOILED TOGETHER, ACCORDING TO THEIR GIFTS, TO MAKE THIS CONTINENT WHAT IT IS TODAY. OUT OF THIS LONG EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN EVOLVED THE ATTITUDE TOWARD MEN AND CITIZENS OF THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES, WHICH IS THUS EXPRESSED BY DON FRANCISCO GARCIA CALDERON, FORMER MINISTER OF BOLIVIA TO THE UNITED STATES, IN AN ESSAY ON PAN-AMERICANISM, PAST AND FUTURE: "TH E BIOLOGICAL NOTION OF RACE, THAT INTERNAL FATALITY AS INEXORABLE AS DESTINY OF OLD, WHICH IS REVEALED BY THE CRANIAL LINE AND THE COLOR OF THE SKIN, IS DECLINING IN PRESTIGE. SOCIOLOGISTS HAVE GIVEN UP DISCOVERING PURE BLOOD IN CONFUSED NATIONS, THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE HEREDITARY PRE-EMINENCE, WHICH USED TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO PARTICULAR ETHNIC GROUPS; THEY CONTEST THE SUMMARY OPPOSITION BETWEEN INDOGERMANIC AND SEMITIC WHICH EXPLAINED, IN THE MIND OF AMBITIOUS HISTORIANS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DRAMA OF PEOPLES, THEIR PROGRESS AND DECADENCE, THE CONSTRUCTION OF EMPIRES AND PHILOSOPHIES, THE MISSION OF ORIENT AND OCCIDENT. BUT WE DO NOT ABANDON THE IDEA OF RACE AS THE SYNTHESIS OF THE DIVERSE ELEMENTS OF A DEFINITE CIVILIZATION. RELIGION, ART, LANGUAGE, LENGTHY INHABITATION OF THE SAME TERRITORY, TRADITION, MORAL AFFINITIES WHICH FIX, THROUGH THE CENTURIES, LASTING CULTURES AND UNMISTAKABLE PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS." THIS IDEA OF RACE AS BEING SYNONYMOUS WITH NATION HOLDS TRUE IN BRAZIL. PERHAPS IN THE GREAT REPUBLIC OF THE NORTH THE TIME IS NOT FAR DISTANT WHEN AN AMERICAN WILL BE NO LESS THAN AN AMERICAN, NO MATTER WHAT THE SHAPE OF HIS HEAD OR THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN. AN D THEN, WHEN YOU HAVE NO MORE WACOS, YOU NEED FEAR NO VERDUNS. AT LEAST, YOU WILL HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT NONE OF THE BLOOD AND TREASURE WHICH YOU WOULD GENEROUSLY SPEND FOR THE REDEMPTION OF BELGIUM IS BEING PAID IN NEEDLESS SACRIFICE FOR THE SLAVERY THAT YOU MAINTAIN AT HOME.

ESTILL SPRINGS BURNING. ON February 12, Lincoln's Birthday, Jim M'Ilheron was burned at the stake at Estill Springs, Franklin County, Tenn. He was accused of killing two white men and wounding a third. February 9, a telegram was sent from the Secretary of the N. A. A. C. P. to the President of the United States: "Speaking on behalf of millions of Americans, we respectfully call your attention to the horrible crime at Estill Springs, Tenn., where a fellow-American, accused of murder, was first tortured by hot irons and then slowly burned to death by a mob, the second burning recently of this kind. "You have spoken out so nobly against German crimes in Belgium and on the high seas that we beg of you to break your silence and to denounce properly these terrible mob acts which cover us with shame and humiliation at the moment when we as a nation would speak and act for justice and righteousness, for decency and humanity abroad." On February 14 an acknowledgment of the Association's telegram to the President was made by his Secretary with the statement that the matter had been referred to the Attorney General. On February 18 the Association received a letter from the United States Attorney General, through Assistant Attorney General William C. Fitts, stating that "Under the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, the Federal Government has absolutely no jurisdiction over matters of this kind; nor are they connected with the war in any such way as to justify the action of the Federal Government under the war power." February 19: Extract from another letter to the President from the Secretary: "In view of this statement of the Attorney General and the silence of the Governor of Tennessee, we beg you to lay this matter again before the President lest the laws be flouted and justice denied. A statement from the President at this time, if he would be disposed to make it, would have a tremendously stimulating effect on the morale of the colored people whose sons' are preparing to give their lives for America and who in sadness of heart and some disturbance of mind are looking apprehensively toward Tennessee to see whether in our own nation law or mob violence is to be supreme. "The President's inspiring moral leadership as a man, no less than his position as President, gives him the opportunity, and may we suggest respectfully, the responsibility, of speaking out. Hundreds of thousands of colored soldiers in the army and millions of their fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers would receive a new baptism of devotion to their country if it were made clear that the equal protection of the laws was to be afforded all men, whether white or black. "This Association wishes it understood that it does not and will not condone the crimes nor apologize for the offenses of colored men." February 14 and 15: The Secretary of the Association wired Governor Tom C. Rye on the 14th and on the 15th wrote to him as follows: Dear Sir: "I wired you yesterday in a night letter from Washington as follows: "The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, speaking in the name of its ninety branches and ten thousand members, and on behalf of the outraged citizenship of the whole country, appeals to you to take action to bring to justice the perpetrators of the foul wrong against the honor of your State in lynching 281 TH E CRISIS and torturing on Tuesday night Jim M'Ilheron, a Negro accused of murder. Thousands of colored men in your State and the nation now serving their country in the battle for democracy await Tennessee's answer to their appeal for justice at home. "This Association, composed of representative citizens of both races, believes that such outrages as the one against which we protest are indefensible at any time but are particularly offensive and dangerous to the public welfare when the nation is engaged in a life and death struggle against autocratic powers. Such outrages as this, the third one to occur in your State within nine months, place America in an unenviable position when she seeks to protest, however rightfully, against Belgian atrocities committed by German soldiers. "Memphis, Dyersburg, and now Estill Springs! We ask, for the information of the newspapers receiving our press service, what the great State of Tennessee proposes to do in regard to the violators of her law. I am sure that it is your desire to put the best police and detective ability that can be secured on the trail of these violators of public order. Should lack of funds be an embarrassment to you, this Association offers to put at your disposal funds for this service. February 25: The Governor of Tennessee, Tom C. Rye, to the Secretary: "I beg to say that I deplore this murder as much as your Association or any other citizen of our common country, but I could not anticipate that local officers, whose duty it is to take custody of prisoners would fail to accord protection, nor could any action upon my part be taken without being requested so to do by the local authorities or court officers. "I do not seek to shift any responsibility about this or any other case and your telegram was wholly unnecessary in order to impress me with the gravity of the offense committed against the laws of this State or to induce me to take steps whereby the perpetrators of the offense could be found and properly punished. "It would not be wise or prudent for me to detail what steps are being taken by local officials in regard to this case at this time. You may be assured that everything that can be done by me will be done to remove the ground for criticism arising in regard to this unfortunate disregard for law and order in Tennessee." February 19: Letters to the Senators from Tennessee, the Congressman in whose district the lynching occurred, and to six Chambers of Commerce in Tennessee cities. February 27: Acknowledgment of Secretary's telegram received from Chattanooga Chamber of Commerce in which we were informed that the Chamber had passed the following resolution: "Be it Resolved, That we vigorously condemn the violation of our laws, and the defiance of our authorities by the mob at Estill Springs; and that we call upon the officials charged with the suppression of such acts, to comply with their obligations." A clipping from the Nashville Banner of February 18 containing an editorial from that paper condemning the burning was received in an envelope of the Commercial Club of Nashville, this apparently being their acknowledgment of our telegram. LOUISIANA LYNCHINGS. FEBRUARY 6: Inquiry made of the Gov ernor of Louisiana, as to lynching of Jim Hudson "accused of living with a white woman." March 4 : Telegram to the Governor of Louisiana: "Press dispatches in New York papers report that three Negroes whose names were given as Jim Lewis, Jim Jones and Will Powell, were lynched near Delhi, La., Tuesday, February 26, as the outgrowth of trouble between whites and Negroes, the lynched colored men having been accused of stealing hogs. . . . Such acts as this mob lynching because of alleged hog-stealing put the President and the United States in a most embarrassing and difficult position when the executive of the country seeks to protest, however rightfully, against outrages committed in Belgium or Armenia. "This is the second Louisiana lynching reported within thirty days by the press of the country. No reply has as yet been made by you to our inquiry of February 6 for information as to any action you might deem fitting to take in the circumstances of a Negro lynched on January 26. For the information of the newspapers of the country, which receive our regular press service, we inquire what action you as Governor propose to take to uphold the laws of Louisiana." N. A. A. C. P. OTHER LYNCHING MOBS. ON February 25 a telegram was received from a member of the Executive Committee of the Memphis Branch stating that a colored man had murdered a policeman and dangerously wounded another and that the murderer was being pursued by a posse, and that lynching was feared. The National Office immediately telegraphed to Governor Rye and to the Mayor of Memphis urging that they take vigorous action to insure punishment according to law and to prevent a repetition of Estill Springs, Dyersburg and Memphis. The Govenor was implored not to wait until a request for help came from local authorities as previous experience had shown that local Tennessee authorities could not be relied upon to safeguard Negro prisoners against mob violence. Bud Cosby was lynched at Aberdeen, Ga., on February 16. He was accused of entering a house to commit robbery and of having kidnapped a young child who was later found near the house unharmed. This lynching, which is described as an "orderly" lynching, was investigated by the Association's investigator and will be reported in another issue. THE 24th INFANTRYMEN. ON February 27 President Wilson grant ed a respite to the five colored infantrymen condemned to death by the second court martial for participation in the Houston affair. The President's order to the War Department announced that the respite was granted until the President had reviewed the trial record of these cases, of the forty-one who had been previously condemned to life imprisonment, and of the forty cases now being tried at San Antonio by a third court martial. This action was taken following the receipt of a large number of telegrams and letters asking for executive clemency. Perhaps the principal contributing factor in this result was the appearance before the President, by appointment, on February 19, of a delegation from the New York Branch of the Association, consisting of James Weldon Johnson, Field Secretary of the Association; Rev. George Frazier Miller, Rector of St. Augustine's Church, Brooklyn; Rev. Frank M. Hyder, Pastor of St. James Presbyterian Church, New York City, and Rev. F. A. Cullen, President of the New York Branch of the Association. The delegation present ed to the President a petition signed by twelve thousand New Yorkers. Mr. Johnson, the spokesman, said among other things: "The hanging of thirteen men without the opportunity of appeal to the Secretary of War or to their Commander-in-Chief, the President of the United States was a punishment so drastic and so unusual in the history of the nation that the execution of additional members of the Twenty-fourth Infantry would to the colored people of the country savor of vengeance rather than justice." EAST ST. LOUIS RIOT MATTERS. MESSRS. BAXTER of counsel, retained by the St. Louis Branch in the case of The People vs. Bundy et al., and Judge Edward Osgood Brown, President of the Chicago Branch, appeared before the Supreme Court of Illinois at Springfield on February 19 and submitted oral arguments and briefs in connection with the appeal taken against the conviction of eleven colored men accused of complicity in the East St. Louis riots who had been sentenced to fourteen years each in the State Penitentiary. Judge Brown's collaboration with the St. Louis counsel was on behalf of the N. A. A. C. P. and the Chicago Branch and was without expense to the defense fund. Judge Brown is hopeful that a writ of error will be granted by the court at its session in April or June, but, of course, nothing positive can be predicted. THE EAST ST. LOUIS CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION. ON February 29, the National Office wrote urgently to Congressman Ben Johnson of Kentucky, Chairman of the Congressional Committee which investigated the East St. Louis mob riots, to each member of the Committee and to the Speaker of the House, insisting that the full testimony, findings and recommendations of the Committee be published by Congress. Requests were sent to the Branch secretaries that they take similar action. IF YOU WANT THIS REPORT PUBLISHED IN FULL AND NOT EMASCULATED TELEGRAPH, WRITE OR SEE YOUR CONGRESSMAN AT ONCE.

"The Taxation of Negroes in Virginia," by Tipton Ray Snavely, is one of the publications of the University of Virginia under the Phelps-Stokes Fellowship. It is an unsatisfactory and unpleasant publication, as one would expect. The splendid efforts by which Virginia Negroes have bought over a million and a half acres of land since Emancipation are stated grudgingly and with every attempt to slur their character. The Negro's "lack of persistence" and "nomadic propensities," "thriftlessness" and "lack of foresight" are repeatedly insisted upon. Every evidence of discrimination against him is minimized. It is admitted that Negroes pay more for property than a white buyer would pay, but a page of reasons excuses this. It is admitted that whites are assessed at about one-third the value of their real estate, and Negroes at nearly one-half, but it would seem that there are adequate reasons for this. So eager is the author to make out a good case for the whites that he drops easily into this remarkable contradiction: It may be stated The Negro, learnhere that while a ing that his disfranlarge majority of the chisement was one of members of the conthe purposes of the vention thought it a convention, did not wise plan to curtail attempt to meet the the Negro vote the requirement of regismethod for doing tration — especially this was not to be when the capitation one of any sort of tax was imposed as a discrimination mereprerequisite also.

The net result of this gentleman's study is the astonishing conclusion that the rich people of the State of Virginia "support" the State, while the poor people pay only 4 1-10 per cent.! One wonders if the Stokes Fund is being properly spent in promoting such "science." Harry A. Williamson has published during the last six years ten articles on the "Negro Free Mason" in various leading craft publications in this country and abroad. We welcome The Liberator as a successor to the defunct Masses, particularly when its prospectus promises that It will assert the social and political equality of the black and white races, oppose every kind of racial discrimination, and conduct a remorseless publicity campaign against lynch law. "Penciled Poems," by Ray G. Dandridge, has come to us and is not without merit. The author is a bed-ridden invalid. "The American Labor Year Book" for 1917-18 has been issued by the Rand School, New York. It is edited by Alexander Trachtenberg and contains succinct information on labor and social subjects. It costs but sixty cents. Lightbourne's "Commercial Directory of the Virgin Islands" is full of information. THE PRESENT SOUTH. "No one can understand the South with out taking account of its essential underlying barbarism among the white people who represent its power today. The Courier Journal is simply supporting an out worn fiction when it calks about "the perfect understanding between black and white." We get down to the bed rock of real relationships when we read after the editor of the Little Rock Daily Neivs ; 288 THE LOOKING GLASS The News has no fight to make on the race, because God Almighty placed a mark upon the brow of Ham, made his nose flat, his skin black and his hair kinky—we would close to him no avenue in which his feet are fit to tread. That he is the intellectual inferior of the white man and will ever be so as long as man is superior to the monkey, as long as brains make intellect. That the Negro can never attain any social position in this country all goes without saying. . . . If Negroes of the present generation could be taught the limitations of race and conditions of servitude as their forebears knew and recognized, there need never be ill-feeling between the races. But as long as Negroes go wild with riotous disposition to murder; as long as they set lustful eyes on white women, as long as any of them seek to break down the barrier that has been between the Negro and the white man for a thousand years, our protests will continue to be vigorous, our revenge will continue to be "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth," and we will neither be slow or timid about our methods of consummation. This may be "Southern brutality" as far as the Boston Negro can see, but in polite circles we call it Southern chivalry, a Southern virtue that will never die. Add to this a letter from F. B. Lander in the Semi-Weekly Leader of Brookhaven, Miss.: The people of the country have no conception of the race conditions that exist in Washington. I did not have—though I visited here often—until I came here to live. If the people knew the real status of affairs, they would band themselves together and make a protest that would be heard in all the states in this Union. And it is my purpose to tell them a few things and to put them to thinking and to cause them, if I can, to make their protest. . . . This is one of the prettiest cities in the world. It has magnificent buildings—public and private; it is clean and well kept; it abounds in lovely parks and beautiful shade trees, but it is infested with black men and women and children at every turn. You cannot enter a street car that they do not jostle you. You cannot take a seat in any one of the beautiful parks that one of them does not take a seat beside you. You cannot enter a public building that they are not in evidence. Many of the finest apartment houses use them as sub-managers. Not a few of the stores have them as clerks. They are on the police force. They are everywhere; doing the work; usurping the places, holding positions that white men and women ought to have. You cannot picture in your imagination a worse race condition, a condition of more race equality than exists right here in the Capital of the Nation. . . . Anything that ought to be done can be done. "The truth is mighty and will pre vail." I may not live to see it; it may not come in my day; but if the people of Mississippi will start a movement to redeem the Capitol from Negro domination, the movement will spread more rapidly mayhap than some people think. Neighbor states will take it up; and some of the Northern States will not be as slow catching step as you may imagine; and in the end the Negro will be relegated to the back seats of the street cars, and taken off of the police force, and instead of door-keepers be made janitors, and placed in positions where they belong. The Beaumont, Tex., Enterprise says: Northern Negroes do not have much luck in the South. They usually get slammed in the mouth or shot by some fellow who doesn't understand them. Southern Negroes fare little better in the North. "T he Crisis," to the contrary, the only place for the southern Negro is in the South, and both The Enterprise and The Post are shoulder-to-shoulder in their efforts to keep them where they belong. Here we have the real South, not strutting and pretending and playing the "gentleman," but brutal, naively ignorant, and impudent. This is the South which it is the business of the Negro to civilize. Even when we get glimpses of that small minority called the "better" South we have such astonishing statements as this from the Columbia State: The State holds that no policy towards any race not grounded on principles of righteousness and justice is wise or expedient. The Negroes need comfortable houses, better schools and just treatment. They cannot save or substantially help themselves with the ballot. This is false and The State knows it is false. It knows that there is no mass of people in the world that has secured "comfortable houses, better schools, and just treatment" without the ballot. It would not think of making such a statement concerning any other people on earth except Negroes, and it makes it concerning Negroes because it does not dare face dominant public opinion in South Carolina. Such opinion, for instance, as is illustrated by this extract from the Anderson, S. C , Farmer's Tribune: "Recently a number of people have called the Tribune's attention to a condition in Anderson that we hardly believed could exist and not until yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock when we viewed the situation, did we fully realize that right in the heart of the city of Anderson is a rope mill, where white girls and women work almost side by side with big strapping, odiferous Nigger 290 THE bucks, but such is the case, for we took in the scene with our own eyes and there are hundreds of people who will take the stand today and swear that such a condition exists, although the law against whites and blacks working in the same room is very plain. "Standing at a row of machines was a bunch of pretty girls and young matrons, one of whom the writer recognized as a girl belonging to one of the best families in the county, but forced by adverse circumstances to work for a living. Within ten or twelve feet in the front and rear of these girls were a number of Negroes. No partition of any kind separated the two races." THE AMERICAN AMUCK. FEW Americans or Englishmen realize the kind of wild animals which they send abroad to represent them and the way in which these scoundrels seek to sow hatred and the despising of black folk among foreigners. In Havana, for instance, George M. Bradt, a Russian from Tennessee, edits the Havana Post and speaks for America. In a recent leading editorial he says: The high-brows of the Cuban Ateneo would have us believe that Washington was by no means alone—that Toussaint l'Ouverture, a contemporary, should occupy a pedestal beside him. Nothing more insulting to the memory of Washington has ever been said, for George III and his ministers never forgot that the commander of the American revolutionary forces was a gentleman. Toussaint l'Ouverture was just a bad nig ger who ran amuck in Haiti and lay down just as soon as Napoleon sent over General Leclerc to punish the rebellious Haitians. He was born a slave and showed his slavish streak by betraying his French masters to Spain, then surrendering to France, and later betraying every trust reposed in him. He finally died a prisoner in France. Now, we really object to this bad nigger, no better than Estenoz or a number of others happily dead in Cuba, being men tioned in the same breath with Washington. One might as well place Lincoln and Jose Miguel side by side. The same despicable methods are being used today by white American soldiers in France. A colored soldier from the former 15th New York Infantry, now in France, writes to his wife: Dear, you do not know what we have to go through here, but in the end "The Great God" above will right all wrongs. I would never have dreamed that the American white man would ever at this time, when CRISIS each and every man of the dear old U. S. A. is sacrificing his all and all for his country regardless of his creed or color, use preju dice and try his utmost to poison another nation against the American Negro soldier. Just for the sake of you I am swallowing some bitter pills in that respect. You know my temper. The officers in our regiment are all gentlemen and men in every respect, and our good Colonel Hayward is all that a man could be. We love our officers and our Colonel, and we are taking the slurs, insults, and the sarcasm that confront us daily on duty and off duty from the heathen people who do not know any better, but bye and bye, some day in the end, there will be a justification. Oh, our wives, our mothers, sisters, brothers, and our families pray that we may be able to govern ourselves! AFRICA. THAT this war is the beginning of the end of the world slavery in Africa no thoughtful person can doubt. Even the white South Africans are beginning to see this. The ninth annual report of the South African National Union says that after the war not only will it be impossible to keep the Indians in subjection, but also: The colored corps, many of them artisans who have captured several skilled trades at the Cape, will also become enlightened as to labor conditions in Europe, and will receive a more exalted opinion of their own worth. They will most certainly invade with success the industrial sphere in other parts of Africa. Even the humble Kafir who has gone in his thousands to France will come back from the point of view of his race a better man, and will no longer see the social or economic situation through a glass darkly. It must be remembered also that in Europe and especially in France there are none of our color prejudices; hence the returned black man will be largely "Americanised." We note also that General C. J. Smuts, a Negro-hating white South African now highly popular in England, is giving much time and discussion to the "native problem." In a speech at the Savoy Hotel, reported in the London Times, he begins with an in teresting discussion of race: It is really only in recent years that the remarkable doctrine of the pure race has sprung up—and again in Germany. I am sorry to say the man who has preached that doctrine most frequently is a Germanized Englishman with the name of Houston Chamberlain. The doctrine is to the effect that you must keep your race pure. There are certain races created by Providence for a great role in the world, and the conclusion was that the German race must keep to itself in future because it is one of the pure THE LOOKING GLASS nations. (Laughter.) Could there be any more arrant nonsense? We do not intend in South Africa to listen to these forces. We want to create a blend out of various nationalities. We want to create a new nation, and that is the South African nation. If we succeed in doing that we shall achieve a nation not standing on one leg, but on various legs. We shall have a nation which will embrace various traits. You will have a people all blending into one. It is only by bringing about a union like that and by making the different racial types of people work together, respect each other, co-operate with each other, and un derstand each other that you will bring into being a unanimous people which will take the broadest and the largest view of the problems with which it is confronted. I am hopeful that although we in South Africa travel slowly, travel at the rate rather of the ox-wagon than the train, we shall in the end achieve success and create under our South African sun a new type in the world. Immediately thereafter General Smuts comes to this remarkable conclusion: There are certain axioms which have been laid down in regard to the black and white races. One is that there must be no inter mixture of blood. All previous civilizations on the African continent have failed—per haps because that principle was never rec ognized. The superior civilized race was lost in the quicksands of African blood. Our forefathers, both English and Dutch, have been strong on that point, with the result that to an unexpectedly large extent the white blood has remained pure in South Africa. We cannot, of course, say just what expectations General Smuts and his social scientists had, but anybody who has seen the Boers with their dark and even brown faces and curly hair will conclude that their expectations must have been fairly large. Coming more specifically to the native problem, General Smuts says: In South Africa we are not simply a white man's country. It has been our ideal to make it a white man's country, but it is not a white man's country yet. It is still a black man's country. Our problem of racial unity is being solved in the midst of the much larger question of the black environment in South Africa. That is a much larger issue, and no one can have any great assurance that we shall succeed in solving it. We know that on the African continent civilization at various times has gained a foothold. You may have read in your books of a university of Timbuctoo. You know of the ruins discovered in Rhodesia and other parts, bearing testimony to a great civilization which at one time must have existed there. These civilizations have now disappeared and barbarism is once more in power over that once apparently civilized land. That is what creates the fundamental doubt about the whole position in South Africa. There are people in South Africa, and they are not foolish people, who are not certain that the white experiment there will be a success, or that we shall ever succeed in making it a white man's land. We are going to make the attempt. (Cheers.) The effort has now been made for some hundreds of years, and it may be that the way we have now set about it is the best way. Former civilizations in Africa have been more for the purpose of exploiting the native populations of Africa, and have probably followed lines of development and action which had the seeds of decay in themselves. But we have created a base, so to speak, in Southern Africa, and today we are in a position to move forward, and we are moving forward, in the promotion of the civilization of South Africa. Our problem there is a very difficult one, and quite unique in a way. In the United States you have a much smaller problem with the Negro population. In the United States you have an overwhelming white population with a much smaller Negro element in the midst of it. But in South Africa the relation is reversed. There you have an overwhelming black population with a small white population which is doing its best to make its footing secure for the future. You can understand that a problem like that is not only uncertain in its ultimate solution, but it is most difficult in the procedure which has to be followed for its solution. As to specific methods for the solution of the race problem, the General says: I think we are all agreed on these two points. I wish we had made more progress and had discovered also a political axiom. But there, although we have arrived at nothing definite or settled, still we have gained a great deal of experience in the years of our history, and there is now shaping in our institutions in South Africa a view which may have very far-reaching results in the future civilization of the African continent. We have found that the ideas which apply to our white civilization largely do not apply to the natives, and that to give a political existence on an equal basis to white and black alike does not lead to the best results. The practice is being built up in South Africa of creating parallel institutions and of making the natives run on different but parallel lines to the white. It may be that on these lines we may be able yet to solve a problem which might otherwise prove to be entirely insoluble. Years ago an experiment with native self-government was started in the old Cape Colony. Under legislation for which, I believe, Cecil Rhodes was largely responsible, and under which local self-government was given to the natives in a large location. That principle has been extended over a large part of Cape Colony, and so successful has the experiment been that when we came to frame the South African Constitution, an appendix was added about protec THE CRISIS torates in case they had to be incorporated in the Union. This was the work of Lord Selborne. I am not certain now whether in the distant future the South African Act will not be remembered more for its Appendix than for its principal contents. This Appendix lays down that the native territories in South Africa shall be governed apart from the Parliament of the Union, on entirely different lines, which will achieve the principle of native self-government. Subsequently commissions have been appointed in South Africa to deal with the native question; and more and more the trend of opinion has hardened in the same direction. We have felt that if we are to solve our native questions it is useless to run black and white at the same moment and to subject them to the same machinery of legislation. It is useless to try that. White and black are different not only in color, but almost in soul; they are different in political structure, and their political institutions should be different, though both should proceed on the principle of self-government. We now have legislation before the Parliament of the Union which is trying to put into shape these ideals I am talking of— ideals of creating all over South Africa, wherever there are considerable native communities, independent self-governing institutions for the native population. Instead of mixing up black and white all over the country, we are now trying to keep them as far apart as possible in government. In that way we are trying to lay down a policy which may take hundreds of years to work out, but which in the end may be a solution of our native problem; and the result will be that in the long run you will have all over South Africa large areas inhabited entirely by blacks, where the blacks are looking after themselves according to their own ways of life and forms of government. In suitable parts you will have your white communities. Economically, the native will go on working in the white areas. As far as possible the forms of political government will be such that each will be satisfied and each will develop according to its own proper rights. This is the attempt which we are now making in South Africa; and, although the principle underlying our legislation cannot be considered axiomatic in any way, I am not sure that we are not coming out on the right lines—and lines which, in the end, may prove more fruitful in the solution of the problem which has been confronting us. Of course, General Smuts is neither honest nor frank in his statement of this solution, because he omits to say that hitherto and in all future plans so far formulated the black areas are under the absolute domination of a white general government, in which they have no voice, vote, or influence. General Smuts then proceeds to another declaration: What the future of that country will be nobody knows, but, remembering my experience in East Africa—(cheers)—my eyes have been opened to the many serious dangers which threaten the future, not only of Africa, but of the world. I have seen there what I have never before realized—what enormously valuable material you have in that black continent. We are all aware of the great German plan that existed before the war, and is still no doubt in the background of many minds in South Africa, of creating a great Central African Empire, which would embrace not only Cameroon and Central Africa, but Portuguese East Africa and the Congo. It would be one of the most valuable tropical parts of the world, and one in which it would be possible to train one of the most powerful armies the world has ever seen. Before the war we were not aware of the military value of the natives. It will be a serious question for us in the future, and a serious question for the statesmen of the Empire and of Europe, whether they are going to allow a state of affairs like that to be a menace not only to South African problems, but to Europe itself. I hope one result of the war will be that some arrangement may be made by which the military training of the natives in that area will be absolutely forbidden. Otherwise, armies may be trained so large that, properly led by whites and properly equipped, they may be a danger to civilization itself. I hope that will be carefully borne in mind by our statesmen when the question of settlement comes. We are astonished to find that this pronouncement is receiving the enthusiastic support not only of the English War Party, but of Pacifists and even Germans; in other words, finding how effectively the Negro is fighting in this war there is arising a singular unanimity among white peoples that the African Negro should be disarmed "for his own good"; so that after the war he may still be the victim of the devils who have hitherto raped and enslaved him. In this "new Pacifism" we find such strange bed-fellows as General Smuts, the New York Evening Post and Dr. W. S. Solf, the German secretary for colonies! What I would like to do more than anything else is to work among the colored men over here. They are not having the happiest kind of a time and I have heard of no one who is specially interested in them, though there may be plenty who are. There have been some race disturbances. I hear that there are a good many colored men at Brest, and I shall hope to be able to do something for them there. Mrs. S. C. Armstrong, in the Boston Herald.

Dillard, of the Slater and Jeanes Funds, presented to the Department of Superintendents of the National Educational Association, a concrete plan for national aid to Negro education. His proposal, which was adopted by the convention, is as follows: 1. Let the aid be offered in fifteen States, as follows: Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Kentucky. Two other States, West Virginia and Missouri, might be added, if the addition be thought advisable. 2. Let the aid be given for salary of teachers in public schools of all grades. With increase of salary, the question of length of term would take care of itself. 3. Let the administration of the funds be in the hands of a committee of three, consisting of the State Superintendent, the State Agent of Negro Rural Schools, and the president or principal of the leading State Institution for Negroes. Eleven of the fifteen States already have State agents of Negro rural schools, and the remaining four should have and probably soon will have such an official. All of the States have one outstanding Negro institution supported by the State, except two. In North Carolina with three, and Alabama with two, the selection of the member of the committee might be left to the State Superintendent. 4. Let the amount be, for fifteen years, one-third; for ten years, one-fourth; for five years, one-fifth, of the amount expended each preceding year for all purposes of Negro education from public funds, in each county and city, and for each State institution of higher grade. In order to give a general idea of the amount needed to carry out this plan I have taken the figures available. Not all are of the same year, and so the amount makes no pretense of absolute present accuracy. According to such figures as I have, the amount spent in a year in counties and cities for Negro public schools in the fifteen States was in round numbers $5,125,000. The amount spent for the State schools was $275,000. These together made $5,400,000 so that, under these figures the amount of national aid would be $1,800,000. Lydia W. Mollison was graduated at the University of Chicago, with the degree of Ph. D. She received her former education at Tougaloo. Vice-President Marshall and Governor Catts took part in the dedication of a new building for the Daytona, Fla., Industrial School for Negro Girls. Mrs. Mary M. Bethune is principal. POLITICS. THE Wilson Ballot Law, which has been on the statute books of Maryland for five years, has been repealed by the Legislature. It was designed to make voting by Negroes difficult. (I Charles Scott has been elected to the City Council from the Third Ward of Worcester, Mass. Of the three-thousand voters in his ward only thirty-six are colored. Major R. R. Jackson defeated Oscar De-Priest for nomination as Alderman in the Second Ward of Chicago. Both men are colored. In the recent special election in New York City, Rev. Dr. Reverdy Ransom was the candidate of the colored people for Congress. The Republicans refused to nominate him and went into court to pre vent his name appearing on the ballot. They were successful on a technicality. Never theless 465 persons voted for Mr. Ransom, the ballots of 600 others who tried to vote for him were thrown out because they were improperly marked, and a large number of colored voters stayed away from the polls. The result was the overwhelming defeat of John A. Bolles, the white Republican candi date. MEETINGS.

They pledged the help of their 2,000,000 constituents in the war and favored national prohibition. The joint commission for the unification of the Methodist Church and the Methodist Church South, which met in Savannah, adopted the following plan of union: One general conference, a court of appeal, six or more regional conferences based on geographical divisions, and five or more central conferences based on racial lines. The regional and central conferences elect their own bishops, if they have 250,000 members or more, and are represented in the general conference. It is proposed, however, that the Negro central conference shall have only limited representation and that on reaching a certain membership (600,000) it shall "automatically" become a "jurisdictional conference," with either no representation at all in the general church or a very limited representation. In order to further work out this plan the commission will reconvene in St. Louis, April 10.
