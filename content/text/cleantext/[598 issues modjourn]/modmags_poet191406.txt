JUNE 1914  ON HEAVEN  To V who asked for a plan for a working Heaven  I  THAT day the sunlight lay on the farms On the morrow the bitter frost that there was That night my young love lay in my arms The morrow how bitter it was  And because she is very tall and quaint And golden like a quattrocento saint I desire to write about Heaven To tell you the shape and the ways of it And the joys and the toil and the maze of it For these there must be in Heaven Even in Heaven For God is a good man God is a kind man   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And God s a good brother and God is no blind man  And God is our father  I will tell you how this thing began How I waited in a little town near Lyons many years And yet knew nothing of passing time or of her tears But for nine slow years lounged away at my table in the  shadowy sunlit square Where the small cafés are  The Place is small and shaded by great planes  Over a rather human monument  Set up to Louis Dixhuit in the year Eighteen fourteen a funny thing with dolphins About a pyramid of green dripped sordid stone But the enormous monumental planes Shade it all in and in the flecks of sun Sit market women There s a paper shop Painted all blue a shipping agency Three or four cafés dank dark colonnades Of an eighteen forty Mairie I d no wish To wait for her where it was picturesque Or ancient or historic or to love  Over well any place in the land before she came And loved it too I didn t even go To Lyons for the opera Aries for the bulls  Or Avignon for glimpses of the Rhone  Not even to Beaucaire I sat about   On Heaven  And played long games of dominoes with the maire Or passing commis voyageurs And so I sat and watched the trams come in and read The Libre Parole and sipped the thin fresh wine They call Piquette and got to know the people The kind southern people  Until when the years were over she came in her swift red car Shooting out past a tram and she slowed and stopped and  lighted absently down A little dazed in the heart of the town And nodded imperceptibly With a sideways look at me  So our days here began  And the wrinkled old woman who keeps the café And the man Who sells the Libre Parole And the sleepy gendarme And the fat facteur who delivers letters only in the shady Pleasanter kind of streets And the boy I often gave a penny And the maire himself and the little girl who loves toffee And me because I have given her many sweets And the one eyed droll Bookseller of the rue Grand de Provence   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Chancing to be going home to bed Smiled with their kindly fresh benevolence Because they knew I had waited for a lady Who should come in a swift red English car To the square where the little cafés are And the old old woman touched me on the wrist With a wrinkled finger And said Why do you linger Too many kisses can never be kissed And comfort her nobody here will think harm Take her instantly to your arm It is a little strange you know to your dear To be dead  But one is English Though one be never so much of a ghost And if most of your life have been spent in the craze to  relinquish What you want most You will go on relinquishing You will go on vanquishing Human longings even In Heaven  God You will have forgotten what the rest of the world  is on fire for The madness of desire for the long and quiet embrace The coming nearer of a tear wet face   On Heaven  Forgotten the desire to slake The thirst and the long slow ache And to interlace Lash with lash lip with lip limb with limb and the fingers  of the hand with the hand And   You will have forgotten   But they will all awake Aye all of them shall awaken In this dear place And all that then we took Of all that we might have taken Was that one embracing look Coursing over features over limbs between eyes a making  sure and a long sigh Having the tranquillity Of trees unshaken And the softness of sweet tears And the clearness of a clear brook To wash away past years  For that too is the quality of Heaven That you are conscious always of great pain Only when it is over And shall not come again Thank God thank God it shall not come again Though your eyes be never so wet with the tears Of many years   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  II  And so she stood a moment by the door Of the long red car Royally she stepped down Settling on one long foot and leaning back Amongst her russet furs And she looked round Of course it must be strange to come from England Straight into Heaven You must take it in Slowly for a long instant with some fear Now that affiche in orange on the kiosque Seven Spanish bulls will fight on Sunday next At Aries in the arena Well it s strange Till you get used to our ways And on the Mairie The untidy poster telling of the concours De vers de soie of silkworms The cocoons Pile yellow all across the little Places Of ninety townships in the environs Of Lyons the city famous for silks What if she s pale It must be more than strange After these years to come out here from England To a strange place to the stretched out arms of me A man never fully known only divined  Loved guessed at pledged to in your Sussex mud Amongst the frost bound farms by the yeasty sea  Oh the long look the long long searching look And how my heart beat  Well you see in England She had a husband And four families   On Heaven  His hers mine and another woman s too Would have gone crazy And with all the rest Eight parents and the children seven aunts And sixteen uncles and a grandmother There were besides our names a few real friends And the decencies of life A monstrous heap They made a monstrous heap I ve lain awake Whole aching nights to tot the figures up Heap after heaps of complications griefs Worries tongue clackings nonsenses and shame For not making good You see the coil there was And the poor strained fibres of our tortured brains And the voice that called from depth in her to depth In me my God in the dreadful nights Through the roar of the great black winds through the  sound of the sea Oh agony Agony From out my breast It called whilst the dark house slept the stairheads creaked From within my breast it screamed and made no sound And wailed And made no sound And howled like the damned No sound No sound Only the roar of the wind the sound of the sea The tick of the clock And our two voices noiseless through the dark O God O God  That night my young love lay in my arms   There was a bitter frost lay on the farms   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In England by the shiver And the crawling of the tide By the broken silver of the English Channel Beneath the aged moon that watched alone Poor dreary lonely old moon to have to watch alone Over the dreary beaches mantled with ancient foam Like shrunken flannel The moon an intent pale face looking down Over the English Channel But soft and warm She lay in the crook of my arm And came to no harm since we had come quietly home Even to Heaven Which is situate in a little old town Not very far from the side of the Rhone That mighty river That is just there by the Crau in the lower reaches Far wider than the Channel  But in the market place of the other little town Where the Rhone is a narrower greener affair When she had looked at me she beckoned with her long  white hand A little languidly since it is a strain if a blessed strain to  have just died And going back again Into the long red English racing car Made room for me amongst the furs at her side And we moved away from the kind looks of the kindly  people   On Heaven  Into the wine of the hurrying air And very soon even the tall gray steeple Of Lyons cathedral behind us grew little and far And then was no more there And thank God we had nothing any more to think of And thank God we had nothing any more to talk of Unless as it chanced the flashing silver stalk of the pampas Growing down to the brink of the Rhone On the lawn of a little chateau giving onto the river And we were alone alone alone At last alone  The poplars on the hill crests go marching rank on rank And far away to the left like a pyramid marches the ghost of Mont Blanc There are vines and vines and vines all down to the river  bank There will be a castle here And an abbey there And huge quarries and a long white farm With long thatched barns and a long wine shed As we ran alone all down the Rhone  And that day there was no puncturing of the tires to fear And no trouble at all with the engine and gear Smoothly and softly we ran between the great poplar alley All down the valley of the Rhone For the dear good God knew how we needed rest and to  be alone   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But on other days just as you must have perfect shadows  to make perfect Rembrandts He shall afflict us with little lets and hindrances of His own Devising just to let us be glad that we are dead Just for remembrance  III  Hard by the castle of God in the Alpilles In the eternal stone of the Alpilles There s this little old town walled round by the old gray  gardens There were never such olives as grow in the gardens of  God The green gray trees the wardens of agony And failure of gods Of hatred and faith of truth of treachery They whisper they whisper that none of the living prevail They whirl in the great mistral over the white dry sods Like hair blown back from white foreheads in the enormous  gale Up to the castle walls of God   But in the town that s our home Once you are past the wall Amongst the trunks of the planes Though they roar never so mightily overhead in the day   On Heaven  All this tumult is quieted down and all The windows stand open because of the heat of the night That shall come And from each little window shines in the twilight a light And beneath the eternal planes With the huge gnarled trunks that were aged and gray At the creation of Time The Chinese lanthorns hung out at the doors of hotels Shimmering in the dusk here on an orange tree there on a  sweet scented lime There on a golden inscription Hotel of the Three Holy  Bells Or Hotel Sublime or Inn of the Real Good Will And yes it is very warm and still And all the world is a foot after the heat of the day In the cool of the even in Heaven And it is here that I have brought my dear to pay her all  that I owed her Amidst this crowd with the soft voices the soft footfalls the rejoicing laughter And after the twilight there falls such a warm soft darkness And there will come stealing under the planes a drowsy odor Compounded all of cyclamen of oranges of rosemary and bay To take the remembrance of the toil of the day away   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  So we sat at a little table under an immense plane And we remembered again The blisters and foments And terrible harassments of the tired brain The cold and the frost and the pain As if we were looking at a picture and saying This is  true Why this is a truly painted Rendering of that street where you remember I  fainted And we remembered again Tranquilly our poor few tranquil moments The falling of the sunlight through the panes The flutter forever in the chimney of the quiet flame The mutter of our two poor tortured voices always a  whisper And the endless nights when I would cry out running  through all the gamut of misery even to a lisp her name And we remembered our kisses nine maybe or eleven If you count two that I gave and she did not give again  And always the crowd drifted by in the cool of the even And we saw the faces of friends And the faces of those to whom one day we must make  amends Smiling in welcome And I said On another day And such a day may well come soon   On Heaven  W e will play dominoes with Dick and Evelyn and Frances For a whole afternoon And in the time to come Genée Shall dance for us fluttering over the ground as the sun  light dances And Arlésiennes with the beautiful faces went by us And gypsies and Spanish shepherds noiseless in sandals of  straw sauntered nigh us Wearing slouch hats and old sheep skins and casting ad  miring glances From dark foreign eyes at my dear  And ah it is Heaven alone to have her alone and so near So all this world rejoices In the cool of the even In Heaven   And when the cool of the even was fully there Came a great ha ha of voices Many children run together and all laugh and rejoice and  call Hurrying with little arms flying and little feet flying and  little hurrying haunches From the door of a stable Where in an olla podrida they had been playing at the cor  rida  With the black Spanish bull whose nature Is patience with children And so through the gaps in the branches   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Of jasmine on our screen beneath the planes We saw coming down from the road that leads to the  olives and Alpilles A man of great stature In a great cloak With a great stride And a little joke For all and sundry coming down with a hound at his side And he stood at the cross roads passing the time of day In a great kind voice the voice of a man and a half With a great laugh and a great clap on the back For a fellow in black a priest I should say Or may be a lover Wearing black for his mistress s mood A little toothache we could hear him say but that s so  good When it gives over So he passed from sight In the soft twilight into the soft night In the soft riot and tumult of the crowd  And a magpie flew down laughing holding up his beak to us And I said That was God Presently when he has  walked through the town And the night has settled down So that you may not be afraid In the darkness he will come to our table and speak to us   On Heaven  And past us many saints went walking in a company The kindly thoughtful saints devising and laughing and  talking And smiling at us with their pleasant solicitude And because the thick of the crowd followed to the one side  God Or to the other the saints we sat in solitude And quietly quietly walking there came before us a  woman That woman that no man on earth or in Heaven May not divinely love and prize above All other women even above love That woman even she came walking quietly And quietly stood by the table before us So near that we could almost hear her breathing In the distance the saints went singing all in chorus And our Lord went by on the other side of the street Holding a little boy Taking him to pick the musk roses that open at dusk For wreathing the statue of Jove Left on the Alpilles above By the Romans since Jove Even Jove Must not want for his quota of honor and love But round about him there must be With all its tender jollity The laughter of children in Heaven Making merry with roses in Heaven   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Yet never he looked at us knowing that would be such joy As must be over great for hearts that needed quiet Such a riot and tumult of joy as quiet hearts are not able To taste to the full And then that woman standing by  our table So near that we could mark her quiet breathing And the tranquil rise and fall of her breast beneath the  woolen cloak And the tender lovely and mild dear eyes that looked at  my dear That woman spoke in her soft clear certain tone It is so very good to have borne a son It is sad that you have no child  There went by an old man carrying many carven gourds And as if it gave her the thought of a pilgrimage To Lourdes She said is not so very far go there tomorrow And there shall come much joy and little sorrow With the coming of a son very slender and straight and up  right With a clear glance and fair cheeks red and white With our suns of France And a sweet voice very courteous and truthful Surely you shall rejoice And as she went looking back over her shoulder with eyes  so sweet so clear and so ruthful Go there she said when you have quietly slept   On Heaven  And kneel you down upon the green grass sod And ask then for your child my word shall be kept For these are the dear pretty angels of God And of them there cannot be too many  And so I said to my dear one That is our Lady And my dear one sat in the shadows very softly she wept Such joy is in Heaven In the cool of the even After the burden and toil of the days After the heat and haze In the vine hills or in the shady Whispering groves in high passes up in the Alpilles Guarding the castle of God  And I went on talking towards her unseen face Ah God the peace to know that she was there So it is so it goes in this beloved place There shall be never a grief but passes no not any There shall be such bright light and no blindness There shall be so little awe and so much loving kindness There shall be a little longing and enough care There shall be a little labor and enough of toil To bring back the lost flavor of our human coil Not enough to taint it And all that we desire shall prove as fair as we can paint  it   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  For though that may be the very hardest trick of all God set himself who fashioned this goodly hall Thus he has made Heaven Even Heaven  For God is a very clever mechanician And if he made this proud and goodly ship of the world From the maintop to the hull Do you think he could not finish it to the full With a flag and all And make it sail tall and brave On the waters beyond the grave It should cost but very little rhetoric To explain for you that last fine conjuring trick Nor does God need to be a very great magician To give to each man after his heart Who knows very well what each man has in his heart To let you pass your life in a night club where they dance If that is your idea of heaven if you will in the South of  France If you will on the turbulent sea if you will in the peace  of the night Where you will how you will Or in the long death of a kiss that may never pall He would be a very little God if he could not do all this And he is still The great God of all   On Heaven  For God is a good man God is a kind man In the darkness he came walking to our table beneath the  planes And spoke So kindly to my dear With a little joke Giving himself some pains To take away her fear Of his stature So as not to abash her In no way at all to dash her new pleasure beneath the  planes In the cool of the even In heaven  That that is God s nature For God s a good brother and God is no blind man And God s a good mother and loves sons who re rovers And God is our father and loves all good lovers He has a kindly smile for many a poor sinner He takes note to make it up to poor wayfarers on sodden  roads Such as bear heavy loads He takes note of and of all that toil on bitter seas and  frosty lands He takes care that they shall have good at his hands Well he takes note of a poor old cook Cooking your dinner   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And much he loves sweet joys in such as ever took Sweet joy on earth He has a kindly smile for a kiss Given in a shady nook And in the golden book Where the accounts of his estate are kept All the round golden sovereigns of bliss Known by poor lovers married or never yet married Whilst the green world waked or the black world quietly  slept All joy all sweetness each sweet sign that s sighed Their accounts are kept And carried By the love of God to his own credit s side So that is why he came to our table to welcome my dear  dear bride In the cool of the even In front of a café in Heaven  Ford Madox Hueffer   IRON  Guns Long steel guns Pointed from the war ships  In the name of the war god Straight shining polished guns Clambered over with jackies in white blouses Glory of tan faces tousled hair white teeth Laughing lithe jackies in white blouses  Sitting on the guns singing war songs war chanties  Shovels  Broad iron shovels  Scooping out oblong vaults  Loosening turf and leveling sod  I ask you  To witness  The shovel is brother to the gun  Carl Sandburg   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE FALCONER OF GOD  I flung my soul to the air like a falcon flying  I said Wait on wait on while I ride below I shall start a heron soon In the marsh beneath the moon  A strange white heron rising with silver on its wings Rising and crying Wordless wondrous things The secret of the stars of the world s heart strings The answer to their woe Then stoop thou upon him and grip and hold him so  My wild soul waited on as falcons hover I beat the reedy fens as I trampled past I heard the mournful loon In the marsh beneath the moon  And then with feathery thunder the bird of my desire Broke from the cover Flashing silver fire High up among the stars I saw his pinions spire The pale clouds gazed aghast As my falcon stooped upon him and gript and held him fast  My soul dropped through the air with heavenly plunder  Gripping the dazzling bird my dreaming knew Nay but a piteous freight A dark and heavy weight   The Falconer of God  Despoiled of silver plumage its voice forever stilled All of the wonder Gone that ever filled Its guise with glory O bird that I have killed How brilliantly you flew Across my rapturous vision when first I dreamed of you  Yet I fling my soul on high with new endeavor  And I ride the world below with a joyful mind I shall start a heron soon In the marsh beneath the moon  A wondrous silver heron its inner darkness fledges I heat forever The fens and the sedges The pledge is still the same for all disastrous pledges All hopes resigned My soul still flies above me for the quarry it shall find  William Rose Benêt   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  TO THE MEXICAN NIGHTINGALE  El Clarin  Clarin from what glens of air Chime your cameo colored bells When they ring I know them rare Fluted like the lips of shells For the tone to ripple down Honey pale or amber brown  When the tawny evening spills Drops of topaz down the pine Light denied the dusking hills Do you gather and confine In some clear aerial jar On the branch where flits the star  Do you pour the liquid light Early from your lyric urn Nay it was at midmost night That I heard among the fern Golden drops that fell in showers Shaken down as out of flowers  When the rain of light was gone  Poured in rhyming gold like rain  How your elfin bells at dawn   Poems  Delicately chimed again Soft as sea shells murmur of Her whose lovely name is Love  Did the Foam born brim those bells With the wistful melodies Of enchanted vocal shells Does the satin sigh of trees Bring a memory of foam Clarin do you sing of home  AVE VENEZIA  The ocean is a garden That folds you closely home With larkspur blue from heaven And roses of bright foam  The dawn upon your waters Is like anemones Your noons are flaked with scarlet As from pomegranate trees  The bubble towers that sunset Dilates with rainbow light Dusk turns to shadowed silver Like olive trees at night   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  O silver of dark olives Of cool night shrouded seas That gives you rest from color And time for memories  I WILL NOT GIVE THEE ALL MY HEART  I will not give thee all my heart For that I need a place apart To dream my dreams in and I know Few sheltered ways for dreams to go But when I shut the door upon Some secret wonder still withdrawn Why dost thou love me even more And hold me closer than before  When I of Love demand the least Thou biddest him to fire and feast When I am hungry and would eat There is no bread though crusts were sweet If I with manna may be fed Shall I go all uncomforted Nay Howsoever dear thou art I will not give thee all my heart   THE LITTLE TOWN  Written in Germany  O little town of memories So brown and golden in the light Do you remember one who sees You beckon day and night  There is a sweet French town that broods Dove grey upon a rounded hill Whose peopled streets were solitudes To me a wanderer still  And in the South a white town sleeps Carven of ivory it seems But a man s heart perversely keeps Such beauty for his dreams  The rosiest cosiest town I know Is this above the rushing Rhine Here might he stay who could not go Home to a town like mine  They do not know you little town Who say that all roads lead to Rome I ve tramped the broad world up and down And every road leads home  Grace Hazard Conkling   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE TRAM  Humming and creaking the car down the street Lumbered and lurched through thunderous gloam Bearing us spent and dumb with the heat From office and counter and factory home  Sallow faced clerks genteel in black Girls from the laundries draggled and dank Ruddy faced laborers slouching slack A broken actor grizzled and lank  A mother with querulous babe on her lap A schoolboy whistling under his breath An old man crouched in a dreamless nap A widow with eyes on the eyes of death  A priest a sailor with deep sea gaze A soldier in scarlet with waxed moustache A drunken trollop in velvet and lace All silent in that tense dusk when a flash  Of lightning shivered the sultry gloom With shattering brattle the whole sky fell About us and rapt to a dazzling doom We glided on in a timeless spell   A Catch or Singing  Unscathed through deluge and flying fire In a magical chariot of streaming glass Cut off from our kind and the world s desire Made one by the awe that had come to pass  ON HAMPSTEAD HEATH  Against the green flame of the hawthorn tree His scarlet tunic burns And livelier than the green sap s mantling glee The spring fire tingles through him headily As quivering he turns  And stammers out the old amazing tale Of youth and April weather While she with half breathed jests that sobbing fail Sits tight lipped quaking eager eyed and pale Beneath her purple feather  A CATCH FOR SINGING  Said the Old Young Man to the Young Old Man

EDITORIAL COMMENT  TOO FAR FROM PARIS  T is easy to be patriotic in the days of a coun  try s adversity for then patriotism means  something very personal Its root is personal  no doubt although that does not prevent the  emotion s transcending the bounds of a mere  ly selfish personal motive But the fact that the sentiment is emotional and personal rather than abstract and rhetorical is what constitutes its living force  When a country is in adversity then this emotion is continuously active It is a passion which absorbs all the energies So much so that it completely enlists the services not only of men of action and practical life but also of the contemplatives the poets the dreamers for whom this emotion like others becomes transmuted into something beyond the personal emotion  But when a country is in the full tide of prosperity this emotion may remain dormant The maternal love is often not awakened until the life of its offspring is threatened The panther fighting for its cubs or a people subjected to tyranny foreign rule or invasion impoverished or destitute of succor these are analagous And curiously enough it is exactly in such times of oppression and adversity that a country turns to its poets admits their worth and is consoled or inspired to fresh courage by their songs It may   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  be so far as practical demonstration goes that this is the supreme justification of the poet and it may be that only in such a crisis does the country realize how much its poets and artists have contributed to the essential growth mental physical and spiritual of the nation This contribution is woven into the national make up as surely as the wheat that has gone into the bread and nourished the bodies of the people It is an integral part of that national entity whose destruction the people resent as surely as the ravages of fire and sword that lay waste their territories  Happy is that country therefore which in times of prosperity nourishes and cherishes great poetry and great art and happy are those poets who do not need to wait for a threatening fate to move them to song whose spirit is at once national and individual a realization of life in terms of immediate experience  We in the United States have need at present of just such poets  It is easy for us to appreciate the Irishman s zealous love for Ireland the celebration of Bengal by the great East Indian poet or the passionate spirit of the Roumanian folk songs Not only have these the direct motive of adversity the minor note of which has been so much in sympathy with the spirit of the last century s literary movement but they are all deep rooted in that tradition which has had its earliest expression in folk songs and legends always an enduring basis for subsequent poets and artists and an integral part of the blood and bone of the people   Too Far From Paris  But here in the United States we have naturally that direct break with the past which is an artificial feature of the creed of certain revolutionary European artists and poets The European traditions of our early settlers have through the flux of constant new additions worn away the imported folk songs are almost all buried with the snows of yesteryear the legends remain as literary deposits in no way native vital or moving All that we owe to the native soil itself is Indian or negro and the latter we can not say certainly how much is of African origin These while very interesting do not belong to us in any racial sense They are exotic and any attempt to be national through the use of this material is begging the question Therefore whatever contribution this country makes to the great international body of literature or art must be largely individual and the contribution already made by this country has been individual The nation has been expressed through the individual Poe and Whitman in poetry Whistler and Sargent in art Hawthorne and Henry James Mark Twain and Bret Harte Lincoln and a few fine architects these although diverse have given us the soul of the nation through the expression of individuality  Meantime the nation is still very busy finding itself For the American poets of today to be told that they are too far from Paris is an anachronism Incidentally it may be remarked that the temperamental distance between Calais and Dover is very much greater than that between Calais and Chicago Know thyself is the first postulate for the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  poet as it is for the mystic The critical mind of France has a very great value but the creative source of much of the modern European movement is American in spirit or draws its inspiration from that international current of thought of which the fertilizing seeds are not confined to any one nation and of which the United States has certainly furnished heroic growths  Edgar Allan Poe who was never in France is nevertheless a leading figure in the French symbolist movement Hawthorne s fine realism not concerned with externals alone is of international significance Whistler by his keen analysis and perfect synthesis of the divergent tendencies of his period is recognized as the progenitor of all that is vitally true and lasting in modern art And then there is Walt Whitman whose large cosmic I and inclusive technique seem to embrace many separate schools of French German and English followers Especially to be emphasized in this connection is the fact that each of the Americans of acknowledged creative genius is equally gifted with the critical faculty building from basic first principles and owing nothing to superficial contemporary models  So individual is the creative structure reared by these men that imitation seems almost to bear upon its face the stigma of plagiarism Emulation is in the spirit rather than in method and for this reason the school or group unit is more rare in the United States than on the continent or in England or Ireland More numerous indeed in Europe than in America the continental followers of Whitman have   Too Far From Paris  escaped imitation through the diversity of language But if even so these European disciples complain of the allegiance of American poets to the Whitman model whose right is greater Indeed it is much better for the young American poet today to build upon Whitman as the Greeks upon Homer than to imitate the twilight tone of the Celtic Revival and the English poets of the nineties indirectly indebted through the French symbolists to Poe or the modern French school which furnishes them an indirect rather than a direct method of approaching Whitman  It may be that the spirit of Whitman is still in any large sense to capture It will be captured and transmuted into expressions varying widely in outward form if the American poets realize their birthright and heritage of individual genius There is no doubt that a wider acquaintance with the critical mind of France or England is valuable but its chief value lies not in imposing foreign standards and models against which a healthy reaction is a good sign of vitality but in awakening American poets to a sense of the creative sources and forces that lie nearer home  The main thing is self realization after that comes self expression and through self expression the expression of the race or nation  Nothing could have furnished a greater contrast at the recent dinner given in Chicago than the reading by Mr Yeats and Mr Nicholas Vachel Lindsay of their poems Supreme in his own art and a spokesman for his fellow craftsmen in England and Ireland Mr Yeats carried the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  audience by the power of his poetry as poetry We were moved with him for romantic Ireland dead and gone and O Leary in his grave although we did not know Mr O Leary any more than Mr Yeats knew Lincoln The poems of other writers that Mr Yeats read were also beautiful He praised their simplicity of diction which was wholly admirable He belittled the Victorian rhetorical morality which has already so far as we are concerned shrunk to the size of a pea though evidences of its survival are still as prevalent in the English Review and other English periodicals as they are in American magazines and indeed a large proportion of those in American magazines come from English sources But and I do not believe that Mr Yeats thought of it all the poems that he read except his own however simple and explicit in diction portrayed poetic fixities or took their root in past tradition Miss Coleridge s in the Nativity Mr Sturge Moore s in Greek symbols of emotion So it was naturally with something of a shock that Mr Lindsay broke the spell with his newly quarried  Congo Mr Lindsay did not go to France for The Congo or for General William Booth Enters Into Heaven He did not even stay on the eastern side of the Alleghenies The traditions of the past are as open to the poet of Springfield as to the poet of Paris Homer Dante Shakespeare the Upanishads Walt Whitman on the shores of Long Island accepted and acknowledged his debt But the tradition of the present is yet to make   Mr Hueffer and the Prose Tradition in Verse  We cannot forecast Mr Lindsay s future He is already as Mr Yeats said assured for the anthologies But his example is valuable He is realizing himself in relation to direct experience and he is not adapting to his work a twilight tone which is quite foreign to him as it is generally speaking to the temperament of the nation He is working out his salvation in his own way It will be his salvation at any rate and therefore worth more to him than if he trundled in on the coat tails of English or French credentials and much more worth while to the nation  The task for the American poet is twice as difficult as it is for his continental brother The artistic tradition upon which he has to build is solely as I have said individual It is a great tradition nevertheless and essentially so in spirit and it is in spirit that it must be emulated  A C H  MR HUEFFER AND THE PROSE TRADITION IN VERSE  Collected Poems by Ford Madox Hueffer Max Goschen  London  In a country in love with amateurs in a country where the incompetent have such beautiful manners and personalities so fragile and charming that one can not bear to injure their feelings by the introduction of competent criticism it is well that one man should have a vision of perfection and that he should be sick to the death and disconsolate because he can not attain it   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Mr Yeats wrote years ago that the highest poetry is so precious that one should be willing to search many a dull tome to find and gather the fragments As touching poetry this was perhaps no new feeling Yet where nearly everyone else is still dominated by an eighteenth century verbalism Mr Hueffer has had this instinct for prose It is he who has insisted in the face of a still Victorian press upon the importance of good writing as opposed to the opalescent word the rhetorical tradition Stendhal had said and Flaubert De Maupassant and Turgenev had proved that prose was the higher art at least their prose  Of course it is impossible to talk about perfection without getting yourself very much disliked It is even more difficult in a capital where everybody s Aunt Lucy or Uncle George has written something or other and where the victory of any standard save that of mediocrity would at once banish so many nice people from the temple of immortality So it comes about that Mr Hueffer is the best critic in England one might say the only critic of any importance What he says today the press the reviewers who hate him and who disparage his books will say in about nine years time or possibly sooner Shelley Yeats Swinburne with their unacknowledged legislators with Nothing affects these people except our conversation with The rest live under us Remy De Gourmont when he says that most men think only husks and shells of the thoughts that have been already lived over by others have shown their very just appreciation of the system of echoes of the general vacuity   Mr Hueffer and the Prose Tradition in Verse  of public opinion America is like England America is very much what England would be with the two hundred most interesting people removed One s life is the score of this two hundred with whom one happens to have made friends I do not see that we need to say the rest live under them but it is certain that what these people say comes to pass They live in their mutual credence and thus they live things over and fashion them before the rest of the world is aware I dare say it is a Cassandra like and useless faculty at least from the world s point of view Mr Hueffer has possessed the peculiar faculty of foresight or of constructive criticism in a pre eminent degree Real power will run any machine Mr Hueffer said fifteen years ago that a certain unknown Bonar Law would lead the conservative party Five years ago he said with equal impartiality that Mr D  H Lawrence would write notable prose that Mr De la Mare could write verses and that Chance would make Conrad popular  Of course if you think things ten or fifteen or twenty years before anyone else thinks them you will be considered absurd and ridiculous Mr Allen Upward thinking with great lucidity along very different lines is still considered absurd Some professor feels that if certain ideas gain ground he will have to rewrite his lectures some parson feels that if certain other ideas are accepted he will have to throw up his position They search for the forecaster s weak points  Mr Hueffer is still underestimated for another reason also namely that we have not yet learned that prose is as   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  precious and as much to be sought after as verse even its shreds and patches So that if one of the finest chapters in English is hidden in a claptrap novel we cannot weigh the vision which made it against the weariness or the confusion which dragged down the rest of the work Yet we would do this readily with a poem If a novel have a form as distinct as that of a sonnet and if its workmanship be as fine as that of some Pléiade rondel we complain of the slightness of the motive Yet we would not deny praise to the rondel So it remains for a prose craftsman like Mr Arnold Bennett to speak well of Mr Hueffer s prose and for a verse craftsman like myself to speak well of his verses And the general public will have little or none of him because he does not put on pontifical robes because he does not take up the megaphone of some known and accepted pose and because he makes enemies among the stupid by his rather engaging frankness  We may as well begin reviewing the Collected Poems with the knowledge that Mr Hueffer is a keen critic and a skilled writer of prose and we may add that he is not wholly unsuccessful as a composer and that he has given us in On Heaven the best poem yet written in the twentiethcentury fashion  I drag in these apparently extraneous matters in order to focus attention on certain phases of significance which might otherwise escape the hurried reader in a volume where the actual achievement is uneven Coleridge has spoken of the miracle that might be wrought simply by one man s feel   Mr Hueffer and the Prose Tradition in Verse  ing a thing more clearly or more poignantly than anyone had felt it before The last century showed us a fair example when Swinburne awoke to the fact that poetry was an art not merely a vehicle for the propagation of doctrine England and Germany are still showing the effects of his perception I can not belittle my belief that Mr Hueffer s realization that poetry should be written at least as well as prose will have as wide a result He himself will tell you that it is all Christina Rossetti and that it was not Wordsworth for Wordsworth was so busied about the ordinary word that he never found time to think about le mot juste  As for Christina Mr Hueffer is a better critic than I am and I would be the last to deny that a certain limpidity and precision are the ultimate qualities of style yet I can not accept his opinion Christina had these qualities it is true in places but they are to be found also in Browning and even in Swinburne at rare moments Christina very often sets my teeth on edge and so for that matter does Mr Hueffer But it is the function of criticism to find what a given work is not what it is not It is also the faculty of a capital or of high civilization to value a man for some rare ability to make use of him and not hinder him or itself by asking of him faculties which he does not possess  Mr Hueffer may have found certain properties of style first for himself in Christina but others have found them elsewhere notably in Arnaut Daniel and in Guido and in Dante where Christina herself would have found them   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Still there is no denying that there is less of the ore rotunda in Christina s work than in that of her contemporaries and that there is also in Hueffer s writing a clear descent from such passages as  I listened to their honest chat Said one Tomorrow we shall be Plod plod along the featureless sands And coasting miles and miles of sea Said one Before the turn of tide We will achieve the eyrie seat Said one To morrow shall be like To day but much more sweet We find the qualities of what some people are calling the modern cadence in this strophe also in A Dirge in  Up Hill in Somewhere or other there must surely be The face not seen the voice not heard  and in Sometimes I said It is an empty name I long for to a name why should I give The peace of all the days I have to live Yet gave it all the same  Mr Hueffer brings to his work a prose training such as Christina never had and it is absolutely the devil to try to quote snippets from a man whose poems are gracious impressions leisurely low toned One would quote The Starling but one would have to give the whole three pages of it And one would like to quote patches out of the curious medley To All the Dead save that the picturesque patches aren t the whole or the feel of it or Sussmund s capricious Address a sort of Inferno to the Heaven which we are print   Mr Hueffer and the Prose Tradition in Verse  ing for the first time in another part of this issue But that  also is too long so I content myself with the opening of an  earlier poem Finchley Road As we come up at Baker Street Where tubes and trains and buses meet There s a touch of fog and a touch of sleet And we go on up Hampstead way Toward the closing in of day   You should be a queen or a duchess rather Reigning instead of a warlike father In peaceful times o er a tiny town Where all the roads wind up and down From your little palace a small old place Where every soul should know your face And bless your coming  I quote again from a still earlier poem where the quiet  of his manner is less marked  Being in Rome I wonder will you go Up to the Hill But I forget the name Aventine Pincio No I do not know I was there yesterday and watched You came give the opening only to place the second portion of the poem  Though you re in Rome you will not go my You Up to that Hill but I forget the name Aventine Pincio No I never knew I was there yesterday You never came  I have that Rome and you you have a Me You have a Rome and I I have my You My Rome is not your Rome my You not you  For if man knew woman I should have plumbed your heart if woman man Your Me should be true I If in your day You who have mingled with my soul in dreams You who have given my life an aim and purpose   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A heart an imaged form if in your dreams  You have imagined unfamiliar cities  And me among them I shall never stand  Beneath your pillars or your poplar groves   Images simulacra towns of dreams  That never march upon each other s borders  And bring no comfort to each other s hearts  I present this passage not because it is an example of Mr Hueffer s no longer reminiscent style but because like much that appeared four years ago in Songs from London or earlier still in From Inland it hangs in my memory And so little modern work does hang in one s memory and these books created so little excitement when they appeared One took them as a matter of course and they re not a matter of course and still less is the later work a matter of course Oh well you all remember the preface to the collected poems with its passage about the Shepherd s Bush exhibition for it appeared first as a pair of essays in POETRY SO there is no need for me to speak further of Mr Hueffer s aims or of his prose or of his power to render an impression  There is in his work another phase that depends somewhat upon his knowledge of instrumental music Dante has defined a poem as a composition of words set to music and the intelligent critic will demand that either the composition of words or the music shall possess a certain interest or that there be some aptitude in their jointure together It is true that since Dante s day and indeed his day and Cassella s saw a re beginning of it music and poetry have drifted apart and we have had a third thing which is called word music I mean we have poems which are read or even in a   Mr Hueffer and the Prose Tradition in Verse  fashion intoned and are musical in some sort of complete or inclusive sense that makes it impossible or inadvisable to set them to music I mean obviously such poems as the First Chorus of Atalanta or many of Mr Yeats lyrics Th e words have a music of their own and a second musician s music is an impertinence or an intrusion  There still remains the song to sing to be set to music and of this sort of poem Mr Hueffer has given us notable examples in his rendering of Von der Vogelweide s Tandaradei and in lighter measure in his own The Three Ten  When in the prime and May day time dead lovers went a walking How bright the grass in lads eyes was how easy poet s talking Here were green hills and daffodils and copses to contain them Daisies for floors did front their doors agog for maids to chain  them So when the ray of rising day did pierce the eastern heaven Maids did arise to make the skies seem brighter far by seven Now here s a street where bus routes meet and twixt the wheels  and paving Standeth a lout who doth hold out flowers not worth the having  But see but see The clock strikes three above the Kilburn Station Those maids thank God are neath the sod and all their generation  What she shall wear who ll soon appear it is not hood nor  wimple But by the powers there are no flowers so stately or so simple And paper shops and full bus tops confront the sun so  brightly That come three ten no lovers then had hearts that beat so  lightly As ours or loved more truly Or found green shades or flowered glades to fit their loves more  duly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And see and see Tis ten past three above the Kilburn Station Those maids thank God are neath the sod and all their generation  Oh well there are very few song writers in England and it s a simple old fashioned song with a note of futurism in its very lyric refrain and I dare say you will pay as little attention to it as I did five years ago And if you sing it aloud once over to yourself I dare say you ll be just as incapable of getting it out of your head which is perhaps one test of a lyric  It is not however for Mr Hueffer s gift of song writing that I have reviewed him at such length this gift is rare but not novel I find him significant and revolutionary because of his insistance upon clarity and precision upon the prose tradition in brief upon efficient writing even in verse  Ezra Pound Note Mr Hueffer is not an imagiste but an impressionist  Confusion has arisen because of my inclusion of one of his poems in  the
