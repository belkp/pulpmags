and stands with a cloth between his hands The stage can be against the wall of any room  First Musician during the unfolding and folding of the cloth  A woman s beauty is like a white Frail bird like a white sea bird alone At daybreak after stormy night Between two furrows upon the ploughed land A sudden storm and it was thrown Between dark furrows upon the ploughed land How many centuries spent The sedentary soul In toils of measurement   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Beyond eagle or mole Beyond hearing or seeing Or Archimedes guess To raise into being That loveliness  A strange unserviceable thing A fragile exquisite pale shell That the vast troubled waters bring To the loud sands before day has broken The storm arose and suddenly fell Amid the dark before day had broken What death what discipline What bonds no man could unbind Being imagined within The labyrinth of the mind What pursuing or fleeing What wounds what bloody press Dragged into being This loveliness  When the cloth is folded again the Musicians take their place against the wall The folding of the cloth shows on one side of the stage the curtained bed or litter on which lies a man in his grave clothes He wears an heroic mask Another man in the same clothes and mask crouches near the front Emer is sitting beside the bed  First Musician speaking I call before the eyes a roof With cross beams darkened by smoke   William Butler Yeats  A fisher s net hangs from a beam A long oar lies against the wall I call up a poor fisher s house A man lies dead or swooning That amorous man That amorous violent man renowned Cuchulain Queen Emer at his side At her own bidding all the rest have gone But now one comes on hesitating feet Young Eithne Inguba Cuchulain s mistress She stands a moment in the open door Beyond the open door the bitter sea The shining bitter sea is crying out singing White shell white wing I will not choose for my friend A frail unserviceable thing That drifts and dreams and but knows That waters are without end And that wind blows  Emer speaking Come hither come sit down beside the bed You need not be afraid for I myself Sent for you Eithne Inguba  Eithne Inguba No Madam I have too deeply wronged you to sit there  Emer Of all the people in the world we two And we alone may watch together here Because we have loved him best  Eithne Inguba And is he dead   POETRY A M a gaziti e of Verse  Emer Although they have dressed him out in his grave  clothes And stretched his limbs Cuchulain is not dead The very heavens when that day s at hand So that his death may not lack ceremony Will throw out fires and the earth grow red with blood There shall not be a scullion but foreknows it Like the world s end  Eithne Inguba How did he come to this  Emer Towards noon in the assembly of the kings He met with one who seemed a while most dear The kings stood round some quarrel was blown up He drove him out and killed him on the shore At Baile s tree And he who was so killed Was his own son begot on some wild woman When he was young or so I have heard it said And thereupon knowing what man he had killed And being mad with sorrow he ran out And after to his middle in the foam With shield before him and with sword in hand He fought the deathless sea The kings looked on And not a king dared stretch an arm or even Dared call his name but all stood wondering In that dumb stupor like cattle in a gale Until at last as though he had fixed his eyes On a new enemy he waded out Until the water had swept over him But the waves washed his senseless image up   And laid it at this door Eithne Inguba How pale he looks Emer He is not dead Eithne Inguba You have not kissed his lips  Nor laid his head upon your breast  Emer It may be An image has been put into his place A sea born log bewitched into his likeness Or some stark horseman grown too old to ride Among the troops of Mananan Son of the Sea Now that his joints are stiff  Eithne Inguba Cry out his name All that are taken from our sight they say Loiter amid the scenery of their lives For certain hours or days and should he hear He might being angry drive the changeling out  Emer It is hard to make them hear amid their darkness And it is long since I could call him home I am but his wife but if you cry aloud With that sweet voice that is so dear to him He cannot help but listen  Eithne Inguba He loves me best Being his newest love but in the end Will love the woman best who loved him first And loved him through the years when love seemed lost  Emer I have that hope the hope that some day and somewhere We ll sit together at the hearth again   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Eithne Inguha Women like me when the violent hour is  over Are flung into some corner like old nut shells Cuchulain listen  Emer No not yet for first I ll cover up his face to hide the sea And throw new logs upon the hearth and stir The half burnt logs until they break in flame Old Mananan s unbridled horses come Out of the sea and on their backs his horsemen But all the enchantments of the dreaming foam Dread the hearth fire  She pulls the curtains of the bed so as to hide the sick man s face that the actor may change his mask unseen She goes to one side of platform and moves her hand as though putting logs on a fire and stirring it into a blaze While she makes these movements the Musicians play marking the movements with drum and flute perhaps Having finished she stands beside the imaginary fire at a distance from Cuchulain and Eithne Inguba  Call on Cuchulain now Eithne Inguba Can you not hear my voice Emer Bend over him  Call out dear secrets till you have touched his heart If he lies there and if he is not there Till you have made him jealous  Eithne Inguba Cuchulain listen   Emer You speak too timidly to be afraid Because his wife is but three paces off When there is so great a need were but to prove The man that chose you made but a poor choice We re but two women struggling with the sea  Eithne Inguba O my beloved pardon me that I Have been ashamed and you in so great need I have never sent a message or called out Scarce had a longing for your company But you have known and come And if indeed You are lying there stretch out your arms and speak Open your mouth and speak for to this hour My company has made you talkative Why do you mope and what has closed your ears Our passion had not chilled when we were parted On the pale shore under the breaking dawn He will not hear me or his ears are closed And no sound reaches him  Emer Then kiss that image The pressure of your mouth upon his mouth May reach him where he is  Eithne Inguba starting back It is no man I felt some evil thing that dried my heart When my lips touched it  Emer No his body stirs The pressure of your mouth has called him home He has thrown the changeling out  Eithne Inguba going further off Look at that arm   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  That arm is withered to the very socket  Enter going up to the bed  What do you come for and from where Figure of Cuchulain I have come From Mananan s court upon a bridleless horse Emer What one among the Sidhe has dared to lie Upon Cuchulain s bed and take his image  Figure of Cuchulain  I am named Bricriu not the man that Bricriu Maker of discord among gods and men Called Bricriu of the Sidhe  Emer Come for what purpose Figure of Cuchulain sitting up and showing its distorted face while Eithne Inguha goes out  I show my face and everything he loves Must fly away  Emer You people of the wind Are full of lying speech and mockery I have not fled your face  Figure of Cuchulain You are not loved Emer And therefore have no dread to meet your eyes And to demand him of you Figure of Cuchulain For that I have come  You have but to pay the price and he is free Emer Do the Sidhe bargain Figure of Cuchulain When they set free a captive  They take in ransom a less valued thing The fisher when some knowledgeable man   Restores to him his wife or son or daughter Knows he must lose a boat or net or it may be The cow that gives his children milk and some Have offered their own lives I do not ask Your life or any valuable thing You spoke but now of the mere chance that some day You d sit together by the hearth again Renounce that chance that miserable hour And he shall live again  Emer I do not question But you have brought ill luck on all he loves And now because I am thrown beyond your power Unless your words are lies you come to bargain  Figure of Cuchulain You loved your power when but  newly married And I love mine although I am old and withered You have but to put yourself into that power And he shall live again  Emer No never never Figure of Cuchulain You dare not be accursed yet he has dared  Emer I have but two joyous thoughts two things I prize A hope a memory and now you claim that hope Figure of Cuchulain He ll never sit beside you at the  hearth Or make old bones but die of wounds and toil On some far shore or mountain a strange woman Beside his mattress   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Emer You ask for my one hope That you may bring your curse on all about him Figure of Cuchulain You ve watched his loves and you  have not been jealous Knowing that he would tire but do those tire That love the Sidhe  Emer What dancer of the Sidhe What creature of the reeling moon has pursued him Figure of Cuchulain I have but to touch your eyes and give them sight But stand at my left side  He touches her eyes with his left hand the right being  withered Emer Figure of Cuchulain the dark My h But out ofusband there reach I have dissolved  That hid him from your eyes but not that other  That s hidden you from his Emer Husband husband Figure of Cuchulain Be silent he is but a phantom now  And he can neither touch nor hear nor see The longing and the cries have drawn him hither He heard no sound heard no articulate sound They could but banish rest and make him dream And in that dream as do all dreaming shades Before they are accustomed to their freedom He has taken his familiar form and yet   William Butler Yeats  He crouches there not knowing where he is Or at whose side he is crouched  A Woman of the Sidhe has entered and stands a little inside the door  Emer Who is this woman Figure of Cuchulain She has hurried from the Country  Under Wave And dreamed herself into that shape that he May glitter in her basket for the Sidhe Are fishers also and they fish for men With dreams upon the hook  Emer And so that woman Has hid herself in this disguise and made Herself into a lie  Figure of Cuchulain A dream is body The dead move ever towards a dreamless youth And when they dream no more return no more And those more holy shades that never lived But visit you in dreams  Emer I know her sort They find our men asleep weary with war Or weary with the chase and kiss their lips And drop their hair upon them From that hour Our men who yet knew nothing of it all Are lonely and when at fall of night we press Their hearts upon our hearts their hearts are cold  She draws a knife from her girdle   Figure of Cuchulain And so you think to wound her with  a knife  She has an airy body Look and listen  I have not given you eyes and ears for nothing  The Woman of the Sidhe moves round the crouching Ghost of Cuchulain at front of stage in a dance that grows gradually quicker as he slowly awakes At moments she may drop her hair upon his head but she does not kiss him She is accompanied by string and flute and drum Her mask and clothes must suggest gold or bronze or brass or silver so that she seems more an idol than a human being This suggestion may be repeated in her movements Her hair too must keep the metallic suggestion  Ghost of Cuchulain Who is it stands before me there  Shedding such light from limb and hair  As when the moon complete at last  With every laboring crescent past  And lonely with extreme delight  Flings out upon the fifteenth night  Woman of the Sidhe Because I long I am not complete  What pulled your hands about your feet  And your head down upon your knees  And hid your face  Ghost of Cuchulain Old memories  A dying boy with handsome face  Upturned upon a beaten place  A sacred yew tree on a strand   William Butler Yeats  A woman that held in steady hand In all the happiness of her youth Before her man had broken troth A burning wisp to light the door And many a round or crescent more Dead men and women Memories Have pulled my head upon my knees  Woman of the Sidhe Could you that have loved many a  woman That did not reach beyond the human Lacking a day to be complete Love one that though her heart can beat Lacks it but by an hour or so  Ghost of Cuchulain I know you now for long ago I met you on the mountain side Beside a well that seemed long dry Beside old thorns where the hawk flew I held out arms and hands but you That now seem friendly fled away Half woman and half bird of prey  Woman of the Sidhe Hold out your arms and hands again You were not so dumbfounded when I was that bird of prey and yet I am all woman now  Ghost of Cuchulain I am not The young and passionate man I was And though that brilliant light surpass All crescent forms my memories   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Weigh down my hands abash my eyes Woman of the Sidhe Then kiss my mouth Though  memory Be beauty s bitterest enemy I have no dread for at my kiss Memory on the moment vanishes Nothing but beauty can remain  Ghost of Cuchulain And shall I never know again Intricacies of blind remorse  Woman of the Sidhe Time shall seem to stay his course For when your mouth and my mouth meet All my round shall be complete Imagining all its circles run And there shall be oblivion Even to quench Cuchulain s drouth Even to still that heart  Ghost of Cuchulain Your mouth They are about to kiss he turns away  O Emer Emer Woman of the Sidhe So then it is she Made you impure with memory  Ghost of Cuchulain Still in that dream I see you stand A burning wisp in your right hand To wait my coming to the house As when our parents married us  Woman of the Sidhe Being among the dead you love her That valued every slut above her While you still lived   William Butler Yeats  Ghost of Cuchulain O my lost Emer Woman of the Sidhe And there is not a loose tongued  schemer But could draw you if not dead From her table and her bed How could you be fit to wive With flesh and blood being born to live Where no one speaks of broken troth For all have washed out of their eyes Wind blown dirt of their memories To improve their sight  Ghost of Cuchulain Your mouth your mouth  Their lips approach but Cuchulain turns away as Emer speaks 1 Emer If he may live I am content  Content that he shall turn on me If but the dead will set him free That I may speak with him at whiles Eyes that the cold moon or the harsh sea Or what I know not s made indifferent  Ghost of Cuchulain What a wise silence has fallen in this  dark I know you now in all your ignorance Of all whereby a lover s quiet is rent What dread so great as that he should forget The least chance sight or sound or scratch or mark On an old door or frail bird heard and seen In the incredible clear light love cast   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  All round about her some forlorn lost day That face though fine enough is a fool s face And there s a folly in the deathless Sidhe Beyond man s reach  Woman of the Sidhe I told you to forget After my fashion you would have none of it So now you may forget in a man s fashion There s an unbridled horse at the sea s edge Mount it will carry you in an eye s wink To where the King of Country Under wave Old Mananan nods above the board and moves His chessmen in a dream Demand your life And come again on the unbridled horse  Ghost of Cuchulian Forgive me those rough words How could you know That man is held to those whom he has loved By pain they gave or pain that he has given Intricacies of pain  Woman of the Sidhe I am ashamed That being of the deathless shades I chose A man so knotted to impurity  The Ghost of Cuchulain goes out Woman of the Sidhe to figure of Cuchulain T o you that  have no living light but dropped From a last leprous crescent of the moon I owe it all  Figure of Cuchulain Because you have failed I must forego your thanks I that took pity   Upon your love and carried out your plan To tangle all his life and make it nothing That he might turn to you  Woman of the Sidhe Was it from pity You taught the woman to prevail against me Figure of Cuchulain You know my nature by what name I am called Woman of the Sidhe Was it from pity that you hid the  truth That men are bound to women by the wrongs They do or suffer  Figure of Cuchulain You know what being I am Woman of the Sidhe I have been mocked and disobeyed  your power Was more to you than my good will and now I ll have you learn what my ill will can do I lay you under bonds upon the instant To stand before our King and face the charge And take the punishment  Figure of Cuchulain I ll stand there first And tell my story first and Mananan Knows that his own harsh sea made my heart cold  Woman of the Sidhe My horse is there and shall outrun your horse  The Figure of Cuchulain falls back the Woman of the Sidhe goes out Drum taps music resembling horse hoofs Eithne Inguba entering quickly I heard the beat of hoofs  but saw no horse   And then came other hoofs and after that I heard low angry cries and thereupon I ceased to be afraid  Emer Cuchulain wakes The figure turns round It once more wears the heroic mask Cuchulain Eithne Inguba take me in your arms I have been in some strange place and am afraid  The First Musician comes to the front of the stage the others from each side They unfold the cloth singing  The Musicians  What makes her heart beat thus Plain to be understood I have met in a man s house A statue of solitude Moving there and walking Its strange heart beating fast For all our talking Oh still that heart at last  O bitter reward Of many a tragic tomb And we though astonished are dumb And give but a sigh and a word A passing word  Although the door be shut And all seem well enough   Although wide world hold not A man but will give you his love The moment he has looked at you He that has loved the best May turn from a statue His too human breast  O bitter reward Of many a tragic tomb And we though astonished are dumb Or give but a sigh and a word A passing word  What makes your heart so beat Some one should stay at her side When beauty is complete Her own thought will have died And danger not be diminished Dimmed at three quarter light When moon s round is finished The stars are out of sight  O bitter reward Of many a tragic tomb And we though astonished are dumb Or give but a sigh and a word A passing word  When the cloth is folded again the stage is bare William Butler Yeats   RED EARTH  MUY VIEJA MEXICANA  I ve seen her pass with eyes upon the road An old bent woman in a bronze black shawl With skin as dried and wrinkled as a mummy s As brown as a cigar box and her voice Like the low vibrant strings of a guitar And I have fancied from the girls about What she was at their age what they will be When they are old as she But now she sits And smokes away each night till dawn comes round Thinking beside the piñons flame of days Long past and gone when she was young content To be no longer young her epic done  For a woman has work and much to do And it s good at the last to know it s through And still have time to sit alone To have some time you can call your own It s good at the last to know your mind And travel the paths that you traveled blind To see each turn and even make Trips in the byways you did not take But that por Dios is over and done It s pleasanter now in the way we ve come It s good to smoke and none to say What s to be done on the coming day   No mouths to feed or coat to mend And none to call till the last long end Though one have sons and friends of one s own It s better at last to live alone For a man must think of food to buy And a woman s thoughts may be wild and high But when she is young she must curb her pride And her heart is tamed for the child at her side But when she is old her thoughts may go Wherever they will and none to know And night is the time to think and dream And not to get up with the dawn s first gleam Night is the time to laugh or weep And when dawn comes it is time to sleep   When it s all over and there s none to care I mean to be like her and take my share Of comfort when the long day s done And smoke away the nights and see the sun Far off a shrivelled orange in a sky gone black Through eyes that open inward and look back  ON THE ACEQUIA MADRE  Death has come to visit us today He is such a distinguished visitor Everyone is overcome by his presence Will you not sit down take a chair   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But Death stands in the doorway waiting to depart He lingers like a breath in the curtains The whole neighborhood comes to do him honor Women in black shawls and men in black sombreros Sitting motionless against white washed walls And the old man with the grey stubby beard T o whom death came Is stunned into silence Death is such a distinguished visitor Making even old flesh important  But who now I wonder will take the old horse to pasture  EL RITO DE SANTE FE  This valley is not ours nor these mountains Nor the names we give them they belong They and this sweep of sun washed air Desert and hill and crumbling earth To those who have lain here long years And felt the soak of the sun Through the red sand and crumbling rock Till even their bones were part of the sun steeped valley How many years we know not nor what names They gave to antelope wolf or bison T o prairie dog or coyote T o this hill where we stand Or the moon over your shoulder    Let us build a monument to Time That knows all sees all and contains all To whom these bones in the valley are even as we are Even Time s monument would crumble Before the face of Time And be as these white bones Washed clean and bare by the sun   CANDLE LIGHT AND SUN  CANDLE LIGHT  It might have been me in the darkened room  With the shutters closed  Lying straight and slim  In the shuttered dusk  In the twilight dim  Like a silken husk  When the corn is gone  Life withdrawn  I am living and she is dead  It might have been me instead  THE MASK  Death is a beautiful white mask  That slips over the face when the moment comes  To hide the happiness of the soul   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  RAIN PRAYER  A broken ploughed field In the driving rain Rain driven slant wise Over the plain I long for the rain The dull long rain For farmlands and ploughlands And cornlands again O grey broken skies You were part of my pain  FAME  Fame is an echo Far off remote But love is a sweetness You taste in the throat Friendship a comfort When twilight falls But fame is an echo Through empty halls  SONG OF SUNLIGHT  Sunlight is in my eyes Every house edged with light Open fields are before me Mountains across the sky   What have I to do with cities  Here the gods are clean wind swept They run along the hills Mad with sunlight They tumble into a deep canyon They take hold of a cloud And swing with it listen They drop far off noiselessly Beyond the blue mountain  At night they lie down under the moon Do you see that hill move Heavily like a sleeper Wrinkling his skin Moving the contour of pines and rocks Resting his hips  It is not far to the stars Not far for them to lean down and whisper  Sunlight I am mad with your light Rocks I have never known you before Earth your red canyons Are sluiced through me The crests of your hills Break over me I ride upward to meet them  Alice Corbin  Alice Corbin    PICTURES OF WOMEN  AN OLD WOMAN WITH FLOWERS  I like to see the eager faced old woman Walking at sunset down the city street Always she holds against her heart with fervor Her sprays of meadow sweet  She passes daily and I never see her Without the flowers she gathers to her so I do not know how destiny softens hardens The ways her feet must go  Nor what her eyes forever are beholding Beyond the sordid walls and grimy towers Nor what against her aged heart she presses Pressing the meadow flowers  TH E SLACKER  The snow is lying very deep My house is sheltered from the blast I hear each muffled step outside  I hear each voice go past  But I ll not venture in the drift  Out of this bright security Till enough footsteps come and go  To make a path for me   Agnes Lee  THE BROKEN TIE  How the wind blew And the snow threw Its ermine softness at my window pane Now I am there again In the old house as once on a winter night About the rooms I stray A stranger yet at home forevermore A creak of the floor Why here comes Rosalie Here s Gordon tiptoeing to me Holding his candle high Children children I have come back yes I  What has become of the house I have forsworn What other forms are they Bringing new garnishment to nook and hall I see them not at all As here I sit a mother miles away And roam the rooms and roam the rooms till morn  BARK BOUND  In her home a woman I know Is a bark bound tree The flowers bloom at her feet But she does not see   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The knife has glittered by To the forest to prune And left her deaf to the wind And blind to the moon  She must live on her sap In her ease and dark Until she shrivels and dies In her walls of bark  Unless the glittering knife Should return her way And set its steel to the bark And let in day  IN THE MORGUE  She who walked with flaming dress And the gems of idleness  She who counted in her troop Young man Dream and old man Dupe  Comes at last to lay her head Here among the unclaimed dead  She was weary as the sages With the riddle of the ages   Saying to midnight Whether or no Half the world is builded so  Saying to morn Come do your mocking But there s money in my stocking  Now with strong insistent voice Calling urging to the choice  More than gems or loves that were The stern sea has tempted her  THE SWEEPER  Frail wistful guardian of the broom The dwelling s drdge and stay Whom destiny gave a single task To keep the dust away  Sweep off the floor and polish the chair It will not always last Some day for all your arms can do The dust will hold you fast   Agnes Lee  THE OLD WOMAN  A Morality Play in Two Parts  I  Doctor There is an old woman Who ought to die  Deacon And nobody knows But what she s dead  Doctor The air will be cleaner When she s gone  Deacon But we dare not bury her Till she s dead  Landlady Come young doctor From the first floor front Come dusty deacon From the fourth floor back You take her heels And I ll take her head  Doctor and We ll carry her Deacon And bury her If she s dead  House They roll her up In her old red quilt They carry her down   Marjorie Allen Seiffert  At a horizontal tilt She doesn t say Yes And she doesn t say No She doesn t say Gentlemen Where do we go Doctor Out in the lot Where the ash cans die There old woman There shall you lie Deacon Let s hurry away And never look behind To see if her eyes Are dead and blind To

Woman Oh what a dark room Not for me  Landlady The room is large And the rent is low There s a deacon above And a doctor below  Deacon When the little mice squeak I will pray  Doctor I ll psycho

and D Annunzio has reached the appreciation of fat American reviews This article is about a few young poets who were acknowledged in and contributed to the magazine La Voce and the futurists organ Lacerba As for the rest let me right here mention and rid me of the Mackaye type and the Woodberry type of poet They are many in Italy imitators of D Annunzio or Carducci over visioned over inspired overwhelming saviours of the world or sons of the Muses and the most popular of them is Sem Benelli known to the French and American public for his dramatic poems  Now I should speak of characteristics schools and tendencies but I am thinking of Verlaine Laforgue Browning Verhaeren and of how they stood out and above all schools and of how puzzled a critic would be who should want to pigeon hole them The first good poem that was ever written started the school of Homer Dante and Shakespeare and in so far as a poet succeeds in writing poetry he belongs to that school and no other  Here then are a few names  Palazzeschi Simplicity and naivete of a modern St Francis of Assisi Wonder eyed playboy swift and light artist  Papini At twenty each idea is to be suspected each man is the enemy having suffered our own great way we have   our own great remedies to suggest But after most of us shrink become humbler out of some defeat perhaps Papini has fulfilled the desire of his heart of twenty he has not shrunk More than a warrior or a martyr has Papini given his life to his country his people in tempestuous autobiographical complaints articles criticism and pragmatism Get the suggestion in these titles of articles which are Papini s best poems Give us Today our Daily Poetry The Two Literary Traditions Dante Petrarca To Become Geniuses  Slataper Died very young in the war Wrote of the Carso mountains the sheer hard landscapes where he lived a big hard and clean boy  Govoni The writer of the most musical most humane free verse I have read Delicate as a girl if at times he sings the luridist obscenest facts in the life of an old Italian city he does so with the same delicate voice Something of Frost in him or I should rather say something of Govoni in Frost  Di Giacomo Writes in Neapolitan dialect short stories and poems of the irremediable sadness and the irrational tragedy of the old Naples With a tenderness that is real in Italy because of the climate etc and would be sentimentality in America He has been acknowledged by Croce and is considered to be the national poet  Jahier Man of many scruples believing that a poet is any man bothered by a great conscience Works in an office for a living No language and no grammar fits Jahier   and they must widen and become more hospitable in order to accept him Jahier knows that it is the poet who shapes languages and grammars and accomplishes many other things  Soffici Most advanced of them all fights his way through French influences to a broken jagged sort of poetry words at liberty and lyric simultaneities which is as haphazard as life itself  And then Clemente Rebora very earnest and very rich who overflows into an imagism that is an orgy of cold senses and dwindles into a unanimism that is emotional vagueness Also Umberto Saba Luciano Folgore and Camillo Sbarbaro poets with too definite an attitude that is too narrow sometimes borrowed  Palazzeschi Govoni and Papini were of the futuristic movement for a time and more consistently than they so was Soffici who is well known as a painter  When a heavy mood of mine crushes the appreciative attitude that I like to maintain I see the flaws of Italian poetry as all being liable to definition under one name Futurism Futurism was built upon the mistakes exaggerations and aberrations of some of the poets I have mentioned It was born of the need for fellowship among those poets and with Marinetti of the need for notoriety and was fostered by the hustling of many vacant souls who made out of these exaggerations etc which were all they could reach a theory and a way of art The movement being largely a furious reaction was largely a merely negative manifestation The attitude was Since the Passatisti were obvious we   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  will be obscure Since they were grandiloquent with faith we will struggle from irony to despair and backward Since with them sexual matters were more or less fig leafed we will trace the minutes and the seconds of our sexual sophistication Since they were too definite rough drawn soared too high astride voluminous Pegasuses blown by the wind of universal moods we will herald the unimportance of art we will trace the formation of the mood but be careful to evade the mood itself write elements of proto psychology and Mallarmé started it Above all let s hate the bourgeois  The trouble with them was as Prezzolini put it that they were bourgeois themselves Vicious circles of weariness and sensualism disease and cynicism aren t these very bourgeois Squalor of unemployed senses where literature becomes an obsession wantlessness as with Ezra Pound who spends too many pages of his Lustra worrying whither and wherefore and when and how his songs go Do they go well snobs and freaks and business men are also always occupied with disoccupations of the sort All the vicious circles all the insanities all the decadences are of the world that the artist hates But he hates it because he suffers at seeing it thus he does not resolve upon hating while still he is in it and lives no better than anybody else this the bourgeois does and the futurist also And as to obscurity faces turn sour stale lurid twisted and are eaten up from inside in the street today every face is heart rending because people do not understand they do not see and cannot talk And to whoever would preach obscurity out out   in the open to be simplified by the clean weather out in the open and less in the rooms for the sake of health  And then of course their theories being absurd these writers betray their theories Marinetti is more grandiloquent more obvious and writes noisier classical bombast than any cheap passatista That s why they hear him around the world But Prezzolini lovable critic full of strength and cleanness has fixed him and his gang in the only intelligent articles on futurism that have appeared in Italian magazines where pigheaded professors have waged war against it and nasty ignorant youths have defended it  After all this I see in these five years of Italian poetry something that I want to call modern And if participation in futurism of the best poets of Italy has any good significance at all it means that it was the effect of a consciousness of modernity in those poets Whether there is or is not anything new under the sun things which must if you will be repeated are said in a line whereas in olden times they required a whole strophe Modern man grown into a consciousness that science and the experience of dead artists have given him sees a more intricate and nearer even if apparently smaller world than the large one of the old artists and I think it is Yeats who says that no traditional pose is adequate to express it Here a friend suggests that a kind of sophistication recurs more than once through the ages with the suavity of old civilizations Though I advance my view humbly and would defend it from attack by saying that it is mainly pragmatic I am thinking that my friend s   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  observation rather confirms it than confutes it Let this be food for speculation for those whose opinion that there is nothing new under the sun is also pragmatic and I agree to drop the subject  I want finally to point out the simple way of expression of Palazzeschi Govoni and Jahier which suggests to me that the only school is that of simplicity It has been said that making poetry is the process wherewith one frees the thing seen of all that is not artistic the unnecessary the commonplace the grandiloquent and the poetical And I should dare to say that simplicity is then also the quality of being true which means human which means beautiful  And I realize here that I owe an apology to Ezra Pound  Emanuel Carnevali CORRADO GOVONI  HAPPINESS  I don t know why but I m happy this morning Is it that I heard through the streets of the village the voice of the letter carrier Opening the green window have I felt that the little swallows were born have I seen the empty shells over the side walk Have I listened to the little hog grunting against the door of the pig sty with joy hearing my mother who was crossing the yard with a pail of warm slop calling him like a child Have I seen the wife of the cowherd take out from the oven rosy crosses of bread    or the white oxen coming back from the fields with the red cart crammed full of grass or the peddler in the yard weighing out to an old farmer cherries into his trembling scale Has the knife grinder come With his damp castle I am happy perhaps because there far away the cuckoo this grey gull of the dark green sea of hemp asks himself questions and answers them because the spikes of the ripe wheat are like blond tiny braids

call of your country Your tight waist was new in it you looked really like Italy over the buildings of the exposition And you didn t carry poison in your basket but oranges which are already so dear this season that maybe no reservist has tasted of them anymore now that they re so refreshing and juicy but dear in this time of the year and tempting cigarets smoke for gentlemen  It s an insult to refuse so much courtesy  That terrible 127 he shall be forever dishonored among the young ladies who distribute in oranges the gratitude of the fatherland in the stations  It s an insult and that s all  But let it be now I forbid you to explain These men have no fatherland because one has cried Down with the war which is not Down with the fatherland  You too cried Hurrah for the war which is not yet Hurrah for the fatherland It s an insult that s right to throw the orange after you miss  It s lack of education that s all but that s enough don t go any further to the heart of education because I too then am forced to appeal to the heart  And I tell you go along with the young men You see this was a reservist miss and under the uniform a man of sorrows Queer moment this sorrow that one can t even eat oranges and smoke cigarets offered by young ladies To go to war in spite of all the flags it was grave and serious to him like going to die  Because he wasn t young any more he was a reservist not young aged Ah the young fellows that s different They can live with death near they are strong and maybe they are going to be happy it s worth while to risk you too a pill of sublimate among mad blond curls if love betrays   Five Years of Italian Poetry  But he was a reservist Aged Many things are already irreme  diable The will has its limits To go to war was serious and grave to him like going to die Go along with the young men next time miss  And possibly students For they are your companions and they are not impressed by the fine odor of flesh O young lady forbidden to the man of the people Go with the students and you won t need to mortify them looking at them as they look at a watch dog young ladies He wasn t a student He was an aged reservist sad in the moment of going away A strange moment the departure one may realize that life has been all a mistake  If you knew how life is for others than young ladies temptations weaknesses saloons the children sometimes forgotten and that little woman sneered at because she went to church and sometimes even beaten up a little woman who remains with  0 75 and two kids she and the kids  And they are over the bridge because they would not let them pass  Then for a compensation you come the most beautiful of your class room with your orange in your hand and your patronizing look  Ah if he just threw it at you now I won t admit that it was an insult miss  ALDO PALAZZESCHI  INDIFFERENT  I am your father  Is that so  I am your mother  Is that so  This is your brother  Is that so  That is your sister  Is that so

leaves  The water is good and fresh It invades everything If you put your finger in the ground around the trunks you feel how the roots suck it All the lives in pain breathe freely  For the earth has a thousand pains On every creature a stone weighs or a torn branch or a bigger leaf or the fine dirt a mole has left or the step of some animal All the trunks have a scar or a wound  The Carso is a country of stone and junipers A terrible cry in stone   Five Years of Italian Poetry  But if a word shall be born of you kiss the wild thymes that squeeze their life from the rock Here is stone and death But when a gentian attains to lift her head and bloom in her all the deep sky of spring is gathered  Press your mouth against the ground and do not speak  The night the waning stars the warm sun the evening tremor  of branches the night I walk God said let even Sorrow have its peace God said let even Sorrow have its silence Let even man have  his solitude Carso my fatherland I bless you REVIEWS  GREAT POETRY  On Heaven and Poems Written on Active Service by Ford Madox Hueffer John Lane Co Has England any up to date twentieth century poet of  large calibre Has she given us any poetry of war true to the motive of this war and the spirit of these times and unlit by the rose and purple glint of ancient glamours of time exaggerated ideals Has any of her poets expressed our kind of spirituality the hope and faith and power that carry us through our days of agony and bring us our flashes of joy  Yes this book is the proof of it A man size book by a poet who does not shirk the bitterest issues of life and death and who admits no rose color of romance between his eyes and the white light of truth by a poet moreover whose molding of English words into a form fit and shapely and abso   lutely expressive has become after long practice and experiment as sure as a master potter s molding of clay  Going through this small volume with a favoring pencil one finds oneself noting all the poems and getting a fresh delight a fresh illumination from each The light shines through them as through prismatic glass separating into its pure and vivid color elements The book has the effect of justifying our modern spirituality our twentieth century ideals which have fought and won the greatest of all wars as against the fragmentary visions the ecstatic closet divinations which fought and won those lesser wars of the past wars temporal and spiritual that passed the torch along through the centuries Not that there is any remotest hint of propaganda any trace of the pulpit or the rostrum the poet never states he never directly tells us anything But through the depth and clarity of his own emotion he makes us feel what he feels and what he feels what his illumined mind knows is simply the whole immense range and beauty of the modern science illumined search for truth  One is tempted to compare or contrast this soldier poet for even On Heaven printed by POETRY in June 1914 reads like a soldier s poem with that other English soldier poet Rupert Brooke Brooke was moved by all the old romantic glamours he sang the glory of war the rapture of death in battle and true to type completed the image by dying in beautiful youth in inviolate faith Hueffer is moved by sterner forces unaided by illusion he can yet follow his country s flag and the world s hope through four long years   of agony knowing always the criminal absurdity of war  yet always completing the paradox with a deep realization of  war s sublimities of devotion and sacrifice As Brooke s  glamorous death was typical so is it typical that the more  modern poet has lived through the four arduous years of  battle to face the new struggle for the remaking of the  world And if Brooke s shining muse wore classic draperies  Hueffer makes no apologies for naked beauty in such poems  as One Day s List Clair de Lune The Old Houses of Flan  ders or Footsloggers which begins and ends with this strophe  What is love of one s land  Ah we know very well It is something that sleeps for a year for a day For a month something that keeps Very hidden and quiet and still And then takes The quiet heart like a wave The quiet brain like a spell The quiet will Like a tornado and that shakes The whole being and soul Aye the whole of the soul Perhaps the whole contrast the difference between the  old and the new is suggested in When the World Crum  bled Once there were purple seas Wide wide And myrtle groves and cyclamen Above the cliff and the stone pines Where a god watched  And thou O Lesbian   Well that s all done   The two longer poems which open and close the book are Antwerp and On Heaven Both are written in a rhymed conversational free verse the rhymes ringing those little bells of surprise which present day technique aims at rather than the exactly measured chime of the more accepted forms Mr Hueffer s Collected Works show how expert he has been in the manipulation of the usual measures but he has graduated into the freer form because let him tell us  It is because I simply can t help it Vers libre is the only medium in which I can convey any more intimate moods Vers libre is a very jolly medium in which to write and to read if it be read conversationally and quietly And anyhow symmetrical or rhymed verse is for me a cramped and difficult medium or an easy and uninteresting one  In the opinion of at least one reader Mr Hueffer s poetry in this medium is as much more beautiful than his earlier work as it is more simple and intimate The extreme skill which has gone into the making of these poems is most happily concealed under the easy distinction and clarity of an achieved style The poet complains of sloppiness in On Heaven indeed for four years he refused to reprint it leaving to POETRY the honor of exclusive publication and even now the earlier version contains a beautiful passage of thirty lines super critically omitted from the book But while the style has not that hardness which the imagists aim at being more fluent and less patterned than their discreet counsel admits as the latest vogue it has a silken richness shining and flowing with many colors in the wind and absolutely responsive in texture and movement to the delicate amenities of the theme   Great Poetry  This theme a materialist s Heaven is Mr Hueffer s present excuse for printing the poem  I know at least that I would not keep on going if I did not feel that Heaven will be something like Rumpelmayer s tea shop For haven t we Infantry all seen that sort of shimmer and shine  and heard the rustling and the music through all the turmoil and the mire and the horror We must have some such Heaven to make up for the deep mud and the bitter weather and the long lasting fears and the cruel hunger for light for graciousness and for grace  It may be questioned whether this Rumpelmayer Heaven is any more material than the mansions of gold and pearl and the harping angels of an earlier revelation At any rate the poem expresses in our unpretentious even a bit humorous modern way the same yearning for joy in love and beauty under the divine approval of a super human but strictly personal God a man and a half so to speak which our ancestors throughout the Christian ages have persisted in expressing through their more assertive and grandly gesticu latory arts And moreover it expresses also in spite of our more difficult modern questionings their faith that this little earth and its fragile fabric of lives are not the whole story  For God is a very clever mechanician And if he made this proud and goodly ship of the world From the maintop to the hull Do you think he could not finish it to the full With a flag and all And make it sail tall and brave On the waters beyond the grave  Antwerp is a heroic ode conceived in the modern spirit and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  fashion it is a tribute to the bravery of Belgium to the bravery moreover of the common man With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty Assuredly that is the way of it The way of beauty  The book as a whole and in detail makes us feel that that is the way of it that kings and knights and conquerors and all the pomp and pageantry of human grandeur and bluster have had their day and that the new way of beauty will follow the footsteps of the common man and penetrate the byways of his homely heroisms H M  KREYMBORG S PLAYS FOR POEM MIMES  Adults who remember their first Punch and Judy show may smile at the assertion that there is an element of similarity between that experience and the reading of Alfred Kreymborg s plays The grim and crude materialism of the former are ages and civilizations apart from the idealism and gentle humor of the latter yet it is through the use of puppets in both cases that the imagination is seized and carried beyond the limits of experience One feels now as then that the author draws upon an outside universe a supernatural world which though unfamiliar compels our acceptance One does not question the queer old figure who talks and guides the puppets in When the Willow Nods any more than of yore one doubted the devil who carried off wicked Punch though one doesn t believe in either The   Kreymborg s Plays for Poem mimes  loves of Manikin and Minikin the bisque figurines are as real as the sorrows of Judy once were more real for the moment than our own The marvel is that now it is over sophisticated unimaginative adult minds that the poet performer casts his spell We accept whole heartedly the idealism of Blue and Green and People Who Die though we have never met it we suffer the tragedies of Jack s House and When the Willow Nods only half comforted by the delicate humor with which the poet pretends to veil them  Through their presentation as puppets the loves and dreams of his characters are seen far off as through the small end of the opera glass and we the audience grow correspondingly to the size of immortals or super mortals When the Willow Nods the first play in the book printed in POETRY last March uses the device of an old figure who interprets and suggests the action of the dancing children In Blue and Green and People Who Die the actors themselves are mysteriously withdrawn till they look upon themselves and interpret themselves for us To them their past experiences become embodied as dreams This intensifies still further their detachment from reality These characters are groping toward interpretation turning away from realism from the undigested morsels of their experiences  When we look through Mr Kreymborg s glass we see the human comedy with whimsical sadness and humorous pity There is delicate farce in Jack s House Lima Beans and Manikin and Minikin modulated by a deeper note the ironic sadness of human destiny while the stark tragedy of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  theme in When the Willow Nods Blue and Green and People Who Die is lightened by a delicate accompaniment of humor A very individual grotesquerie is found in the loveliest passages love is not a theme for violins only the piccolos blow delicate bubbles of mirth at it  Kreymborg is unquotable One cannot lift a line or a speech from his plays and retain their beauty any more effectively than one can play a detached bar of music  The mention of music carries a hint of the special magic in this poet s style He chooses words with an apparently naïve simplicity only to combine them subtly into repetitions which form delicate rhythms not unlike the patterns of a fugue With each repetition the theme develops the harmonies deepen He gains his effect as directly as mysteriously as does music there is indeed a kinship between Kreymborg s style and Bach s I can think of no other musician combining his cerebral quality economy of ornament and architectural sense of form It may be considered slip shod criticism to interpret one art in terms of another but this illustration will aid readers who know music in feeling Kreymborg There is all too little co operation between music and poetry arts so closely allied might gain much from juxtaposition in the creative workshop of the artist Hitherto only the modern French poets have felt this kinship only in modern French poetry have genuine musical effects been heard But Mr Kreymborg who is a thoroughly educated musician has drawn upon the technique of counterpoint and melody in a wholly original man   ner thereby greatly enriching his style and introducing a new element into American verse  People who have seen these plays performed report that they gain immensely in beauty and poignance on the stage every word goes home every situation shines On the stage the obscurities which trouble the hasty reader clarify into action In short Alfred Kreymborg is a born dramatist as well as a poet Marjorie Allen Seiffert  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  TWO NEW ONES  New magazines tread on each other s heels

CORRESPONDENCE  ABOUT MR UNDERWOOD S PRIZE  To the Editor I am enclosing herewith a newspaper clipping of The Song of the Gheechas which has only just come to my notice The poem is listed as having been printed in the June 1918 issue of POETRY I have had no opportunity of seeing it as printed there and therefore I am unaware if mention was made that it is a very close paraphrase of certain passages in my book With Serbia into Exile published in 1916 by the Century Company For your convenience I am also enclosing a copy of the passages referred to above which appear on pages 71 73 Other phrases and figures of speech which appear in the poem are just as obviously drawn from other parts of my book Frankly I may say I am delighted that Mr Underwood should have been thus impressed with the spirit of the Cheechas as I attempted to picture them and by a skilful arrangement of my impressions and my words should have fashioned this effective chant I should be very unwilling to be guilty of any meanness in the matter but it seems to me he has contrived to add so very little to the original source of his verse that only simple honesty must have impelled him to give due credit to that source If in reality this was not done I cannot but think there was a definite desire to deceive the public In view of the fact that he has taken a valuable prize without so far as I know having made any such acknowledgment it appears to me but fair that you and   those who passed upon the merit of his work should be made familiar with its origin Paul Portier Jones  Passages from With Serbia into Exile  The cheechas defended Chachak Three times the Germans wrested the town from them and each time the cheechas retook it Only when four fifths of them had been put out of action did the Germans finally succeed in holding the place  With rifles of every possible description too old for real soldiers rejected by the first three lines of defense the cheechas of Chachak faced as fine troops as Germany could muster perfectly equipped splendidly provisioned and feeling with increasing assurance a whole nation crumbling before them For the cheecha knows not only how to thrive on half a pound of dry bread a day and nothing else he knows how to lie against a tree or turn himself into a stone and with Serbia in her death grip he only wished to die  I believe the cheechas felt the loss of their country more keenly than anyone else Most of them had lived through nearly all of her free history Unlike the educated Serb they could not see a bright political lining behind the present pall of blackness But I have yet to hear a complaint from one of them There was Dan one of the orderlies who retreated with the English nurses He had been to America and he had numerous failings but no one could see him at that time without forgetting everything except his grief The suffering he underwent the cold and hunger seemed to matter nothing to him but by the hour at night he would squat by his smoldering fire and mumble  Whata I care bout myself Whata I mount to T ree million people lost Nuthin else don t matter T ree million people t ree million lost  When seven weeks after Chachak I passed a company of the fourth line on top of the Montenegrin mountains during days when there was absolutely no food for them when they saw their comrades drop by the hundred dead of starvation cold and exhaustion when not one foot of Serbian soil was free separated from their families in all probability forever at best for years miserable it seemed to me beyond all human endurance the cheechas were singing I cannot forget that song The fine sleet cut their faces and formed grotesque icicles on their woolly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  beards The mountain wind blew their voices to shreds voices mechanical dreary hopeless unlike any Serbians I had ever heard before Not until I was right among them did I recognize the song a popular one that had sprung up since the war its content being that the Suabas are building houses the Serbians shall live in the Suabas are planting corn the Serbians shall eat the Suabas are pressing wine the Serbians shall drink  Note by the Editor Unquestionably Mr Underwood will be quite willing to acknowledge that his poem was based upon Mr Jones book and if he were not the most distrait and the least explicit of men he would probably have so informed the editors of POETRY in sending them the poem  Whether knowledge of this fact would have influenced the jury in its award of the Helen Haire Levinson Prize it is now impossible to say In any case the award is irrevocable It may seem characteristic of the tribe of poets in general and of this poet in particular that our first information of Mr Underwood s receiving the prize came from Santa Fé newspapers which acknowledged the receipt of our check for two hundred dollars as his contribution to the United War Work Campaign  Frankly we do not think that such knowledge should have biased the jury The passages above quoted are prose deriving from them his basic material and his inspiration Mr Underwood made a poem It was manifest that this poet a native American who had never travelled in Serbia must have drawn his material from printed or oral accounts In our opinion The Song of the Cheechas is not a mere paraphrase of Mr Jones excellent prose but a transmutation into poetry  MR AIKEN AND THE ESSENTIAL INDUSTRY  Dear POETRY Your editorial in the November issue does me too much honor It would have been indeed quixotically courageous of me to have asked military exemption on the ground that I was a poet it would even more perhaps have been presumptuous Tha t I did not do however It was not the real point at issue for I was already   in Class II The question was whether under the Work or Fight Law the writing of poetry was to be classed as non productive along with billiard marking setting up can  dle pins and speculation in theatre tickets and whether artists in general would have to change their occupation merely submitted that poetry should not be so classed and that it was not specifically implied in the terms of the law Was the consequent decision more commercial perhaps than  idealistic in motive Hac itur ad astra Conrad Aiken NOTES  The poets in this number require little introduction  Mr William Butler Yeats of London and Dublin
