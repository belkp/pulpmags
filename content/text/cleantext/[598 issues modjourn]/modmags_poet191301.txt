WILLIAM BOOTH ENTERS INTO HEAVEN  To be sung to the tune of THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB with indicated instruments  Booth led boldly with his big bass drum  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb  The saints smiled gravely and they said He s come  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb bass drums  Walking lepers followed rank on rank Lurching bravos from the ditches dank Drabs from the alleyways and drug fiends pale Minds still passion ridden soul powers frail Vermin eaten saints with mouldy breath Unwashed legions with the ways of death  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb  Every slum had sent its half a score The round world over Booth had groaned for more Every banner that the wide world flies   Ease drums  slower and  Flutes  Bass drums  louder and  faster  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Bloomed with glory and transcendent dyes Big voiced lasses made their banjos bang Tranced fanatical they shrieked and sang  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb  Hallelujah It was queer to see Bull necked convicts with that land make free Loons with bazoos blowing blare blare blare On on upward through the golden air  Are you washed in the Mood of the Lamb  Booth died blind and still by faith he trod Eyes still dazzled by the ways of God Booth led boldly and he looked the chief Eagle countenance in sharp relief Beard a flying air of high command Unabated in that holy land  Jesus came from out the Court House door Stretched his hands above the passing poor Booth saw not but led his queer ones there Round and round the mighty Court House square Yet in an instant all that blear review Marched on spotless clad in raiment new The lame were straightened withered limbs uncurled And blind eyes opened on a new sweet world  Drabs and vixens in a flash made whole Gone was the weasel head the snout the jowl   Sages and sibyls now and athletes clean Rulers of empires and of forests green  The hosts were sandalled and their wings were fire  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb  But their noise played havoc with the angel choir  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb  Oh shout Salvation it was good to see Kings and princes by the Lamb set free The banjos rattled and the tambourines Jing jing jingled in the hands of queens  And when Booth halted by the curb for prayer He saw his Master through the flag filled air Christ came gently with a robe and crown For Booth the soldier while the throng knelt down He saw King Jesus they were face to face And he knelt a weeping in that holy place  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb  Nicholas Vachel Lindsay   Grand chorus  tambourines all  instruments  in full blast  Reverently  sung no  instruments    WASTE LAND  Briar and fennel and chincapin And rue and ragweed everywhere  The field seemed sick as a soul with sin Or dead of an old despair Born of an ancient care  The cricket s cry and the locust s whirr And the note of a bird s distress  With the rasping sound of the grasshopper Clung to the loneliness Like burrs to a trailing dress  So sad the field so waste the ground So curst with an old despair  A woodchuck s burrow a blind mole s mound And a chipmunk s stony lair Seemed more than it could bear  So lonely too so more than sad So droning lone with bees  I wondered what more could Nature add To the sum of its miseries And then I saw the trees   Waste Land  Skeletons gaunt that gnarled the place Twisted and torn they rose  The tortured bones of a perished race Of monsters no mortal knows They startled the mind s repose  And a man stood there as still as moss A lichen form that stared  With an old blind hound that at a loss Forever around him fared With a snarling fang half bared  I looked at the man I saw him plain Like a dead weed gray and wan  Or a breath of dust I looked again And man and dog were gone Like wisps of the graying dawn   Were they a part of the grim death there Ragweed fennel and rue  Or forms of the mind an old despair That there into semblance grew Out of the grief I knew  Madison Cawein   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MY LADY OF THE BEECHES  Here among the beeches Winds and wild perfume  That the twilight pleaches Into gleam and gloom Build for her a room  Her whose Beauty cometh Misty as the morn  When the wild bee hummeth At its honey horn In the wayside thorn  As the wood grows dimmer With the drowsy night  Like a moonbeam glimmer Here she walks in white With a firefly light  Moths around her flitting Like a moth she goes  Here a moment sitting By this wilding rose With my heart s repose   My Lady of the Beeches  Every bough that dances Has assumed the grace  Of her form and Fancies Flashed from eye and face Brood about the place  And the water shaken In its plunge and poise  To itself has taken Quiet of her voice And restrains its joys  Would that these could tell me What and whence she is She who doth enspell me Fill my soul with bliss Of her spirit kiss  Though the heart beseech her And the soul implore  Who is it may reach her Safe behind the door Of all woodland lore Madison Cawein   THE WAYFARERS  Earth I dare not cling to thee Lest I should lose my precious soul  Tis not more wondrous than the fluff Within the milkweed s autumn boll  Earth shall my sacred essences But sink into thy senseless dust  The springtide takes its way with them And blossoms blow as blossoms must  Earth I swear with solemn vow I feel a greatness in my breath  The grass seed hath its dream of God Its visioning of life and death Anita Fitch   LES CRUELS AMOUREUX  Two lovers wakened in their tombs They had been dead a hundred years And in the langue of old Provence They spoke of ancient tears  M amour she called I ve pardoned you How sad her dreaming seemed to be When I had kissed your dead face once Love s sweet returned to me  M amour he called it was too late How dreary seemed his ghostly sighs Blessed the soul that love forgives He whispered ere it dies  And then they turned again and slept With must and mold in ancient way And so they ll sleep and wake tis told Until the Judgment Day  ENVOI  O damoiseau et damoiselle  Guard ye your loving while ye live Sin not against love s sacred flame While yet ye may forgive  Anita Fitch   LOVE SONGS OF THE OPEN ROAD  MORNING  The morning wind is wooing me her lips have swept my  brow Was ever dawn so sweet before the land so fair as now The wanderlust is luring to wherever roads may lead While yet the dew is on the hedge So how can I but  heed  The forest whispers of its shades of haunts where we have been And where may friends be better made than under God s green inn Your mouth is warm and laughing and your voice is calling low While yet the dew is on the hedge So how can I but go  NOON  The bees are humming humming in the clover The bobolink is singing in the rye The brook is purling purling in the valley And the river s laughing radiant to the sky  The buttercups are nodding in the sunlight The winds are whispering whispering to the pine The joy of June has found me as an aureole it s crowned me Because oh best beloved you are mine I   NIGHT  In Arcady by moonlight  Where only lovers go There is a pool where only  The fairest roses grow  Why are the moonlit roses  So sweet beyond compare Among their purple shadows  My love is waiting there  To Arcady by moonlight  The roads are open wide But only joy can enter  And only joy abide  There is the peace unending  That perfect faith can know In Arcady by moonlight  Where only lovers go  Kendall Banning   SYMPATHY  As one within a moated tower I lived my life alone And dreamed not other granges dower Nor ways unlike mine own I thought I loved But all alone As one within a moated tower I lived Nor truly knew One other mortal fortune s hour As one within a moated tower One fate alone I knew Who hears afar the break of day Before the silvered air Reveals her hooded presence gray And she herself is there I know not how but now I see The road the plain the pluming tree The carter on the wain On my horizon wakes a star The distant hillsides wrinkled far Fold many hearts domain On one the fire worn forests sweep Above a purple mountain keep And soar to domes of snow One heart has swarded fountains deep Where water lilies blow And one a cheerful house and yard   Sympathy  With curtains at the pane Board walks down lawns all clover starred And full fold fields of grain As one within a moated tower I lived my life alone And dreamed not other granges dower Nor ways unlike mine own But now the salt chased seas uncurled And mountains trooped with pine Are mine I look on all the world And all the world is mine  Edith Wyatt   A SONG OF HAPPINESS  Ah Happiness Who called you Earandel Winter star I think that is And who can tell the lovely curve By which you seem to come then swerve Before you reach the middle earth And who is there can hold your wing Or bind you in your mirth Or win you with a least caress Or tear or kiss or anything Insensate happiness  Once I thought to have you Fast there in a child All her heart she gave you Yet you would not stay Cruel and careless Not half reconciled Pain you cannot bear When her yellow hair Lay matted every tress When those looks of hers Were no longer hers You went in a day She wept you all away   Once I thought to give You plighted holily No more fugitive Returning like the sea But they that share so well Heaven must portion Hell In their copartnery Care ill fate ill health Came we know not how And broke our commonwealth Neither has you now  Some wait you on the road Some in an open door Look for the face you show d Once there no more You never wear the dress You danced in yesterday Yet seeming gone you stay And come at no man s call Yet laid for burial You lift up from the dead Your laughing spangled head  Yes once I did pursue You unpursuable Loved longed for hoped for you Blue eyed and morning brow d   Ah lovely happiness Now that I know you well I dare not speak aloud Your fond name in a crowd Nor conjure you by night Nor pray at morning light Nor count at all on you  But at a stroke a breath After the fear of death Or bent beneath a load Yes ragged in the dress And houseless on the road I might surprise you there Yes who of us shall say When you will come or where Ask children at their play The leaves upon the tree The ships upon the sea Or old men who survived And lived and loved and wived Ask sorrow to confess Your sweet improvidence And prodigal expense And cold economy Ah lovely happiness   Ernest Rhys  HELEN IS ILL  When she is ill my laughter cowers An exile with a broken rhyme My head upon the breast of time I hear the heart beat of the hours I close my eyes without a sigh The vision of her flutters by As glints the light of Mary s eyes Upon the lakes in Paradise  I seem to reach an olden town And enter at the sunset gate And as the streets I hurry down I find the men are all elate As if an angel of the Lord Had passed with dearest word and nod Remembered like a yearning chord Of songs the people sing to God I come upon the sunrise gate As silent as her listless room There seven beggers sing and wait And this the song that breaks the gloom  God a mercy is

 EDITORIAL COMMENT  STATUS RERUM  London December 10 1912  THE state of things here in London is as I  see it as follows  I find Mr Yeats the only poet worthy  of serious study Mr Yeats work is already  a recognized classic and is part of the required reading in the Sorbonne There is no need of proclaiming him to the American public  As to his English contemporaries they are food sometimes very good food for anthologies There are a number of men who have written a poem or several poems worth knowing and remembering but they do not much concern the young artist studying the art of poetry  The important work of the last twenty five years has been done in Paris This work is little likely to gain a large audience in either America or England because of its tone and content There has been no man with a message but the work has been excellent and the method worthy of our emulation No other body of poets having so little necessity to speak could have spoken so well as these modern Parisians and Flemings  There has been some imitation here of their manner and content Any donkey can imitate a man s manner   There has been little serious consideration of their method It requires an artist to analyze and apply a method  Among the men of thirty here Padraic Colum is the one whom we call most certainly a poet albeit he has written very little verse and but a small part of that is worthy of notice He is fairly unconscious of such words as aesthetics technique and method He is at his best in Garadh a translation from the Gaelic beginning  0 woman shapely as a swan On your account I shall not die The men you ve slain a trivial clan Were less than I  and in A Drover He is bad whenever he shows a trace of reading I quote the opening of A Drover as I think it shows all Colum better than any passage he has written I think no English speaking writer now living has had the luck to get so much of himself into twelve lines  To Meath of the pastures  From wet hills by the sea  Through Leitrim and Longford  Go my cattle and me  I hear in the darkness Their slipping and breathing I name them the bye ways They re to pass without heeding  Then the wet winding roads Brown bogs with black water And my thoughts on white ships And the King o Spain s daughter   I would rather talk about poetry with Ford Madox Hueffer than with any man in London Mr Hueffer s beliefs about the art may be best explained by saying that they are in diametric opposition to those of Mr Yeats  Mr Yeats has been subjective believes in the glamour and associations which hang near the words Works of art beget works of art He has much in common with the French symbolists Mr Hueffer believes in an exact rendering of things He would strip words of all association for the sake of getting a precise meaning He professes to prefer prose to verse You would find his origins in Gautier or in Flaubert He is objective This school tends to lapse into description The other tends to lapse into sentiment  Mr Yeats method is to my way of thinking very dangerous for although he is the greatest of living poets who use English and though he has sung some of the moods of life immortally his art has not broadened much in scope during the past decade His gifts to English art are mostly negative i e he has stripped English poetry of many of its faults His followers have come to nothing Neither Synge Lady Gregory nor Colum can be called his followers though he had much to do with bringing them forth yet nearly every man who writes English verse seriously is in some way indebted to him   Mr Hueffer has rarely come off His touch is so light and his attitude so easy that there seems little likelihood of his ever being taken seriously by anyone save a few specialists and a few of his intimates His last leaflet High Germany contains however three poems from which one may learn his quality They are not Victorian I do not expect many people to understand why I praise them They are The Starling In the Little Old Market Place and To All the Dead  The youngest school here that has the nerve to call itself a school is that of the Imagistes To belong to a school does not in the least mean that one writes poetry to a theory One writes poetry when where because and as one feels like writing it A school exists when two or three young men agree more or less to call certain things good when they prefer such of their verses as have certain qualities to such of their verses as do not have them  Space forbids me to set forth the program of the Imagistes at length but one of their watchwords is Precision and they are in opposition to the numerous and unassembled writers who busy themselves with dull and interminable effusions and who seem to think that a man can write a good long poem before he learns to write a good short one or even before he learns to produce a good single line  Among the very young men there seems to be a gleam of hope in the work of Richard Aldington but it is too early to make predictions   Status Rerum  There are a number of men whose names are too well known for it to seem necessary to tell them over America has already found their work in volumes or anthologies Hardy Kipling Maurice Hewlett Binyon Robert Bridges Sturge Moore Henry Newbolt McKail Masefield who has had the latest cry Abercrombie with passionate defenders and Rupert Brooke recently come down from Cambridge  There are men also who are little known to the general public but who contribute liberally to the charm or the atmosphere of London Wilfred Scawen Blunt the grandest of old men the last of the great Victorians great by reason of his double sonnet beginning  He who has once been happy is for aye Out of destruction s reach Ernest Rhys weary with much editing and hack work to whom we owe gold digged in Wales translations transcripts and poems of his own among them the fine one to Dagonet Victor Plarr one of the old Rhymers Club a friend of Dowson and of Lionel Johnson His volume In The Dorian Mood has been half forgotten but not his verses Epitaphium Citharistriae One would also name the Provost of Oriel not for original work but for his very beautiful translations from Dante In fact one might name nearly a hundred writers who have given pleasure with this or that matter in rhyme But it is one thing to take pleasure in a man s work and another to respect him as a great artist  Ezra Pound   REVIEWS  The Lyric Year Mr Kennerley s new annual contains among its hundred contributions nearly a score of live poems among which a few excite the kind of keen emotion which only art of real distinction can arouse  Among the live poems the present reviewer would count none of the prize winners not even Mr Sterling s the best of the three whose rather stiff formalities in praise of Browning are however lit now and then by shining lines as  Drew as a bubble from old infamies The shy and many colored soul of man  The other two prize poems must have been measured by some academic foot rule dug up from the eighteenth century Orrick Johns Second Avenue is a Gray s Elegy essay of prosy moralizing without a finely poetic line in it or any originality of meaning or cadence And the second prize went to an ode still more hopelessly academic Indeed To a Thrush by Thomas Augustine Daly is one of the most stilted poems in the volume a far away echo of echoes full of the approved poetic words throstle pregnant vernal cerulean teen chrysmal even paraclete and quite guiltless of inspiration  But one need not linger with these As we face the other way one poem outranks the rest and ennobles the book This is The Renascence said to be by Edna St Vincent Millay who according to the editor is only   Reviews  twenty years old This poem is the daring flight of a wide winged imagination and the art of it though not faultless is strong enough to carry us through keen emotions of joy and agony to a climax of spiritual serenity Though marred by the last twelve lines which should be struck out for stating the thesis too explicitly this poem arouses high hopes of its youthful author  Among the other live poems trees saplings or flowers  are various species Kisa Gotami by Arthur Davison Ficke tells its familiar story of the Buddha in stately cadences which sustain the beauty of the tale Jetsam a Titanic elegy by Herman Montagu Donner carries the dread and dangerous subject without violating its terrors and sanctities with false sentiment or light rhythm Ridgeley Torrence s Ritual for a Funeral is less sure of its ground sometimes escaping into vapors but on the whole noble in feeling and flute like in cadence Mrs Conkling s bird ode has now and then an airy delicacy and Edith Wyatt s City Swallow gives the emotion of flight above the roofs and smoke of a modern town  Of the shorter poems who could ignore Harry Kemp s noble lyric dialogue I Sing the Battle The Forgotten Soul by Margaret Widdemer Selma by Willard H Wright Comrades by Fannie Stearns Davis or Nicholas Vachel Lindsay s tribute to O Henry a more vital elegy than Mr Sterling s These are all simple and sincere   straight modern talk which rises into song without the aid of worn out phrases Paternity by William Rose Benêt To My Vagrant Love by Elouise Briton and Dedication by Pauline Florence Brower are delicate expressions of intimate emotion and Martin by Joyce Kilmer touches with grace a lighter subject  To have gathered such as these together is perhaps enough but more may be reasonably demanded As a whole the collection like the prizes is too academic Georgian and Victorian standards are too much in evidence The ambition of The Lyric Year is to be an annual Salon of American poetry to this end poets and their publishers are invited to contribute gratis the best poems of the year without hope of reward other than the three prizes That so many responded to the call freely submitting their works to anonymous judges shows how eager is the hitherto unfriended American muse to seize any helping hand  However if this annual is to speak with any authority as a Salon it should take a few lessons from art exhibitions Mr Earle s position as donor editor and judge is as if Mr Carnegie should act as hanging committee at the Pittsburg show and help select the prize winners And Messrs Earle Braithwaite and Wheeler this year s jury of awards are not even though all have written verse poets of recognized distinction in the sense that Messrs Chase Alexander Hassam Duveneck and other jurymen in our various American Salons are distinguished painters   Reviews  In these facts lie the present weaknesses of The Lyric Year However the remedy for them is easy and may be applied in future issues Meantime the venture is to be welcomed at last someone somewhere is trying to do something for the encouragement of the art in America Poetry which is embarked in the same adventure rejoices in companionship H M  Already many books of verses come to us of which a few are poetry Sometimes the poetry is an aspiration rather than an achievement but in spite of crude materials and imperfect artistry one may feel the beat of wings and hear the song Again one searches in vain for the magic touch even though the author has interesting things to say in creditable and more or less persuasive rhymed eloquence  Of recent arrivals Mr John Hall Wheelock has the most searching vision and appealing voice In The Human Fantasy Sherman French amp Co his subject is New York typified in the pathetic little love affair of two young starvelings which takes its course through a stirring exacting milieu to a renunciation that leaves the essential sanctities intact The poet looks through the slang and shoddy of the lovers and the dust and glare of the city to the divine power of passion in both In The Beloved Adventure the emotion is less poignant or rather the poet has included many indifferent pieces which obscure the quality of finer lyrics More rigorous tech   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  nique and resolute use of the waste basket would make more apparent the fact that we have here a true poet one with a singing voice and a heart deeply moved by essential spiritual beauty in the common manifestations of human character At his best he writes with immense concentration and unflagging vigor and his hearty young appetite for life in all its manifestations helps him to transmute the repellant discords of the modern town into harmony The fantasy of Love in a City is a true thing and a vital  Mr Hermann Hagedorn is also a true poet capable of lyric rapture but sometimes when he seems least aware his muse escapes him The Infidel the initial poem of his Poems and Ballads Houghton Mifflin Co recalls his Woman of Corinth and others in this book remind one of this and of his Harvard class poem The Troop of the Guard in that the words do not like colored sands dance inevitably into the absolute shape determined by the wizardry of sound He is still somewhat hampered by the New England manner a trend toward an external formalism not dependent on interior necessity This influence makes for academic and lifeless work and it must be deeply rooted since it casts its chill also over the Boston school of painters  But now and then Mr Hagedorn frees himself perhaps in the end he may escape altogether In such poems as  Song Doors Broadway Discovery The Wood Gatherer The Crier in the Night and A Chant on the Terrible Highway we feel that he begins to speak for himself to sing with   Reviews  his own voice Such poems are a challenging note that should arrest the attention of all seekers after sincere poetic expression  Mr Percy MacKaye in Uriel and Other Poems Houghton Mifflin Co shows also the Boston influence but perhaps it is difficult to escape the academic note in such poems for occasions as these With fluent eloquence and a ready command of verse forms he celebrates dead poets addresses noted living persons and contributes to a number of ceremonial observances The poems in which he is most freely lyric are perhaps In the Bohemian Redwoods and To the Fire Bringer the shorter of his elegies in honor of Moody his friend  In two dramatic poems The Tragedy of Etarre by Rhys Carpenter Sturgis amp Walton Co and Gabriel a Pageant of Vigil by Mrs Isabelle Howe Fiske Mosher the academic note is confidently insisted on The former shows the more promise of ultimate freedom It is an Arthurian venture of which the prologue is the strongest part In firm knit iambics Mr Carpenter strikes out many effective lines and telling situations Indeed they almost prompt the profane suggestion that simplified and compressed they might yield a psychological libretto for some advanced composer  Mrs Fiske s venture is toward heaven itself but her numerous archangels are of the earth earthy In The Unconquered Air and Other Poems Houghton Mifflin Co Mrs Florence Earle Coates shows not inspir   POETRY A
