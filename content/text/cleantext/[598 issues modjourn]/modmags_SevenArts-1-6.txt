The Seven Arts  1.6 (1917-04) , made THE SEVEN ARTS YOUNG JAPAN By Seichi Naruse APRIL, 1917 25 Cents NOTES ON NAMES. Frederick Booth comes from a small Indiana town.   His story "Supers" which appeared in the December Seven Arts was included in the volume, "The Best Short Stories of 1916," edited by E. J. O'Brien. Randolph S. Bourne is a well-known essayist. He has published a book on the Gary School system, a volume of general papers entitled "Youth and Life," and has recently specialized on educational and industrial subjects. Kaj Klitgaard is a native of Denmark. He has followed the seas since he was a boy; is at present a ship-officer and has sailed before the mast with Johannes V. Jensen, the great Danish novelist whose work has received attention in The Seven Arts. Mr. Klitgaard lives in New York between trips to Singapore or Panama and has taken out citizenship papers. This poem is his first appearance in print, in any language. It introduces an authentic poet. Amy Lowell has achieved a conspicuous place among the younger generation of American poets. In addition to her own creative work she has been of great service in introducing the French poets to America. Kenneth Macgowan is a graduate of Harvard who has devoted himself to the study of the scenic and cinematographic arts. He was for some time on the staff of the Boston Transcript and is at present dramatic editor of The Philadelphia Evening Ledger. Peter Minuit is a man very much about town. Prior to the founding of The Seven Arts he confined himself to living. It was hard to persuade him to take a little time from the pursuit of his versatile sensations for the recording of them.   This is his third essay. John Chapin Mosher comes from Albany. He graduated from Williams College in 1914. The Provincetown Players, this season, have produced two of his dramas: "Sauce for the Emperor" and "Bored." At present he is a member of the staff of The Every Week Magazine. Seichi Naruse is introduced in a note preceding his essay. Paul Rosenfeld is a graduate of Yale. After a brief experience in reportorial work on a New York newspaper he specialized in criticism and has been devoting himself to this field since. Wilbur Daniel Steele is well-known as a writer of genre short stories. He spends his summers in Provincetown, Massachusetts—the scene of this tale and of many others from his pen. Louis Untermeyer's activities as poet and critic and leader in the poetic renaissance of America are too well-known to be dwelt on. John Butler Yeats, the Irish portrait painter, who has now for several years made his home in New York, is one of the fountain-heads of the Irish renaissance of which his son, the poet, is an active leader. Readers of The Seven Arts will be delighted to learn that Mr. Yeats' happy conversation will find a place also in future issues of the magazine. SCRIBNER BOOKS THE WAR, MADAME . . .

To possess a well-painted picture is to live in one's own palace. For consider how by virtue of harmonious color and significant line mere casual objects become endowed with meanings that open one into the other like an endless succession of spacious rooms. But how much more wonderful, how much more desirable an art whose effect is to endow people themselves with that same quality—an art which makes the spectator, as it were, part of the picture.

Reis, Secretary A. J. Leverton, Business Manager Louis Untermeyer-Two Abreast THESE TIMES By Louis Untermeyer, author of "Challenge," "—and Other Poets." $1.25 net When the first edition of "Challenge" appeared, the Philadelphia North American concluded its review by saying: "No other contemporary poet has more independently and imperiously voiced the dominant thought of these times." And it is the dominant thoughts, with their strange assembling of purpose and brute power, that unite and intensify "These Times." The new volume, moreover, indicates a remarkable advance in Mr. Unter-meyer's poetic gift ; the same force and fire that were evident in his earlier work is here, but it is chastened and at the same time strengthened. The tone is not louder, but it is somehow larger; what was often merely challenging is met and answered with an equal energy. It displays an even wider and more varied sympathy with the actual world ; an understanding that is not the result of any particular program or propaganda, but a genuine record of things experienced and felt. POEMS OF HEINRICH HEINE Three hundred and twenty-five poems selected and translated By Louis Untermeyer Octavo, $2 net Contains more individual poems than any previous one- or two-volume edition of Heine, many poems never before translated into English, and is, in a sense, an anthology of Heine's poetic work, as it includes examples from the many sides of his diverse genius. The prefatory essay on "Heine, the Man, the Poet and the Paradox" is a searching and analytic interpretation of the poet and his work. The translations keep not only Heine's music, his rhyme-schemes and changing metres, but reflect the swift play of his irony and constantly changing moods. This version is, in general, not only accurate but sympathetic; translations made not so much by a scholar as by a poet. Thus the reader is given (in many poems for the first time) not only Heine's words, but the strange and stubborn spirit that provoked them. It should speedily take its place as the translation of Heine. CREATIVE CRITICISM: Essays on the Unity of Genius and Taste By J. E. Spingarn, formerly Professor of Comparative Literature in Columbia University, author of "Literary Criticism in the Renaissance."  $1.20 net. There are four essays in the volume. The first, on "The New Criticism," is a statement of the New Freedom in the criticism of literature and art. The second, "Dramatic Criticism and the Theatre," applies this body of theory to the drama; and in the essay on "Prose and Verse" its application to vers libres and to the whole question of metre is made clear. The last essay, on "Creative Connoisseurship," deals with the fine arts, and with the new ideal of "creative collecting." The author's works on criticism have been widely accepted abroad, and in one of Eden Phillpott's novels, "The Joy of Youth," the hero quotes with enthusiasm the theories of "an honest critic, Spingarn, the American." Henry Holt and Company 34 West 33d Street New york The American WHEN the pressure of a great hour comes upon us, we may draw strength from one source only. Not from our place, nor our power, nor our possessions : but only in the very depths of ourselves. Those depths are the Past. That is why there was ever prayer before battle—a moment of burial in one's own fountain-head, that one might arise with the strength to conquer. And that is why the shock of war and the demand of the extreme sacrifice sends a nation into its own Past, that the sustaining strength of its great tradition and its God may nerve it to the risk of its whole existence. Our hour has come, and we are hurled backward on ourselves. Could any moment have been more untimely than the present one—the moment of our greatest doubt, of our most profound questioning? Was it yesterday when we painfully looked about us, and saw that we were not a nation, but merely a horde of shuffled races, fattening on the slaughter of Europe, with no purpose of our own, save that of keeping a whole skin? This yesterday of ours grows vivid, in the shock of a common awakening. In that shock, we grope backward for that central source of our existence, that unity of life from which we were sprung. And seeking for that morning when out of the soil a heroic youth came mysteriously with gods and warriors, the dream of our national childhood, echoing with song and tradition, we find nothing but the self-conscious enterprise and struggles of transplanted Europe. No: we have no past. Our past is part of our present, and only that present is ours. But at the moment when we might despair of nationality, we discover that there is something great in our life: that there is a spirit permeating our land. It is unlike the spirit of any other land, for by the miracle of [555] The American our destiny it is not a god and it is not a divine king, nor is it any ghostly visitant.   It was thumped together and thumbed painfully into shape out of the common clay of middle America. It was gnarled, and gaunt, and human : a homely solemn figure, whose sorrow had the power to beget laughter, whose wisdom was of the folk, whose mercy was part of a simple faith in democracy, whose strength was drawn from life itself. The tale of this man is the story of every man of sorrow.   The hero of the folk is born humbly, in a manger, a hut, a cabin.   He goes into the great forests, and learns wisdom from the trees, the brooks, the beasts and birds, and from lowly labor.   In the hour of great tribulation, in the hour of the people's need, he rises and leads them.   All their sorrows are taken upon himself, a heavy burden. All their knowledge comes to wisdom in him. All their faintheartedness and doubt flames into steadfastness and courage in his spirit.   He leads them to victory, and in the moment of triumph, dies a shameful death.   In his death, his people come to a greater life.   His sacrifice becomes a means to their re-birth. Once the marvellous thing was that this hero was a man of magic, a god, and was worshipped. With us, the marvellous thing is that he really lived this life, that he was one of us, that he remains one of us, and that his is a greatness not aloof, not of heaven, not something we must gain by mystic devotion and a separation from life, but a greatness possible to men here on earth, in this life. It is in the meaning of the life of Abraham Lincoln that we have the possibility of a common future; it is in the spirit that endured times of great confusion when our national destiny once before was threatened with disruption and death; the spirit that slowly drew the separated together; that was full of mercy in the moment of bloody hatred; that was patient in the face of derision and intrigue; that held steadily before himself and our people the great and [556] The American undying Cause; that brought about in his own life a meaning and a center for the American spirit. In his own person a vision gained reality for us: the vision of a people who might share one another, from the lowest to the highest, who might bring into fusion the necessary affairs of the day with the pro-foundest purposes of life, who might be alien to nothing human, and who might be rich and open in their sympathies without being weak and halting in their action. He is not the America we know, nor the America that has passed : yet he is the American. We have this heritage in common. We have this human and living symbol of what we believe in, and what it is worth our dying for. We go to him, not as we go to a god, but as we go to our own selves, ourselves brought to a common expression, a common height. We go to him, that we may go forward, united in one prophecy, in one great achievement of our national life, in one great hope for our future. [557] A Devil of a Fellow By Wilbur Daniel Steele HE had always been spoiled, by men, and especially by women.   Even in the name they called him in Portuguese Old Harbor, down cape, there was a ring of irrepressible triumph—"Va Di! Va Di!"—as it were, "a devil of a fellow," or "a gay bird." They had been dead for more than half a year, he and Stiff Peter—dead, that is, in the knowledge of the home world. And as befitting one out of the unknown, he returned more magnificent than ever, stepping down the fruit steamer's plank at the Boston dock dressed in a suit of cream-colored flannels gotten in the tropics, between which and the pale block of the Panama hat above, his face showed more than ever swarthy, rich-toned and clean-drawn, with its crisp black spurs of moustache breaking the line of either cheek, like a brigand on a poster. In his right hand he poised a slender cane, something he had learned in Port au Prince. Stiff Peter came behind, carrying the new, straw suitcase, clothed himself in much the same sort of shoddy in which he and his captain had been picked up from the fisherman's wreckage, seven months before, by a southward-going tramp. Stiff Peter was a small fellow ; he had to look up to Va Di ; had he had to look down to Va Di, the world would have been quite inexplicable. The pair stood outside the dock gates, staring about them at the heavy summer city, the vendors of colored fruits, the hot blue elevated trains thundering overhead,  the ice-carts sweating long, cold threads across the cobbles. "Here's the country fer you, eh, Peter?" [558] Wilbur   Daniel Steele Peter nodded, showing his bad teeth. "Betcha!" The master pointed the tips of his moustache and smiled easily at a passing shop-girl. "Say, Peter, I a'most wisht now I didn't send that letter home. Be some sport now, coming ashore into Old Harbor, like a—miracle." "Betcha!" The little fellow grinned, thinking that would have been fine. "I wisht you didn't either," he echoed. The fact that Peter himself had sent the letter, Va Di never having learned to read or write, did not obtrude itself upon either of them.  Peter waited patiently, eyes on the cobbles. "Well, Peter, we'll see a night, afore we go down home, anyhow. Wonder who'll be to Schlinsky's? Them boys off the fleet'll be tickled to see me." "Betcha!" Outside Schlinsky's place they were confronted by a slovenly-jointed man whose little, red-rimmed eyes seemed to be looking at ghosts. "Thousand devils!" the fellow gasped in his long throat. Va Di straightened the left lapel of his coat and flicked a damp curl from his forehead. No one enjoyed this sort of thing more than he. "Hello, Costa. How's fishin'—good? Any the boys done good this year?" "But for Gawd's s-a-k-e!" Costa stretched out an absurdly long finger to touch the flannel stuff. "And is that Stiff Peter?" His eyes wobbled about in a grotesque fashion. "Say, you fellahs is drownedV He closed his eyes tight and mopped the sweat from his brow with the back of a wrist. "I was onto the Arbitrator myself las' fall when she picked up your wreckage. Me and Tony Silva catched a dory-load o' corpses ourselves. The hull o' you's got good granite stones up to the graveyard. And here you come tackin' up to me in broad daylight." He [559] A   Devil   of   a Fellow popped his eyes very suddenly at the conclusion, as if to give nature a chance. "And you never knowed?" Va Di demanded, losing his dramatic composure. "Knowed what?" "Knowed we was picked up, me and Peter, and took to Brazil." Costa shook his head uneasily, still a little suspicious of them. "But looky here, didn't—who was it I sent that letter to, Peter? Mamie Cabrai? Say, man, didn't Mamie get no letter offa me, eh?" "N-n-naw." Costa's face changed abruptly from pale brown to brick-color and his unmanageable fingers fussed with his beard. "Mamie's went—" "Went?   Went where?" "Nowheres.  Only she went an' got married." "Got married?" "Got married." "Onto who?" "Onto that old store-keep, Henny Lake—you know." "Old Henny Lake with the crooked leg?   Looky here, Costa-" Costa backed away a step, licked his lips, fumbled uneasily in and out of his pockets, and after a moment spoke in a voice unnecessarily loud : "Come on up an' have a drink, Va Di, old fellah." He slapped the other on the back, crying: "There's other fish into the water, man!" "You go straight to hell!" Va Di stood for a long time after Costa had retreated up the stairway, scowling into the yellow sun of evening, his teeth playing with his nether lips, his hands tormenting the frail Malacca. [560] Wilbur   Daniel Steele "They—they's other fish into the water," Peter stammered, desperate to shift the great man's humor. Va Di wheeled with out-flung hands. 'Other fish! Well, I guesso. Mary Virgin, but I got a dozen girls in town, right here, better'n that run-around slut that jumps after an old man's money the minute I get out o' sight. Fish? I guesso! Come on up, Stiff Peter. I'll show 'em." He mounted the dusty stairs, with Peter sweating after him, and in the wide, many-tabled hall of the Jew, heavy with the arid lushness of a summer night in the city, he drank himself into an heroic insensibility, so that he had to be carried away to dark Ô Wharf, in the willing hands of the fish fleet, and dumped aboard a schooner bound down on the morning tide for the end of the Cape. They opened the town around Long Point, a straggling arc of infinitesimal houses and wharves and spires, all colored alike in the sulphur fires of sunset, with here and there a gleam of clear flame refracted from a window pane, a whole broadside from the cold-storage in the western sands. "Seven month," Peter mused, an eye cornerwise on the silent man beside him in the bows. "Seven month; and it's like yiste'day—er mebby ten, twenty year, lookin' at it another way, eh, Cap'n?" "They'll be took aback," Va Di muttered, rousing himself from his sour preoccupation. "I'm goin' to see the Silvado girls tonight, Peter. You watch their faces, now. Fish into the water—I guesso." He fell into another silence, broken only by the faint rustle of the cutwater and the tiny crescendo of men's voices as the bow-gang straggled forward to make the anchor ready. The fleet at mooring drifted nearer, spiring purple on a mat of pellucid gold. "I see Maya's shifted his off-shore trap," Peter struggled patiently. [561] A   Devil   of  a Fellow The tide was low when the dories came ashore, leaving a wide stretch of flats, soggy, half-reflecting. Two of the crew, to tell of it afterward, carried Va Di on their shoulders and saved his white shoes from the wet, their own boots leaving tiny lakes behind, full of yellow sky. A bare-legged girl with a clam-rake in her hand turned curiously as she crossed in front of them, opened her eyes wider, ran away blushing richly, the damp skirts flinging about her knees. Va Di called after her: "Ai there, you Angie—you watch out for me." People began to come out on the stranded wharves; some padded across the flats, hallooing to one another. At the "rising," Va Di kicked to be let down, and stood with the great hat held dramatically across his breast, watching the townspeople converging upon him. A party of summer visitors from the East End passed in a motor; one of them, a handsome woman of thirty or so, smiled amusedly at the figure, flushed and tightened her lips as she found her smile returned with a shocking candor, made to pluck her companion's sleeve, thought better of it, lowered her eyes to her lap, and so whirled on into nothingness. "Le' me alone," Va Di cried with a sudden ferocity. "Peter, gi' me that dress-suit-case." Grasping the shiny thing he wheeled and strode away into the mouth of a lane, leaving mouths and eyes wondering behind him. The day died very suddenly now. Passing beneath the willows that hung out of Ma Deutra's chicken pen it was almost night already, cool and struck through with the acrid foetal of the roots; and when he came out beyond, the world's color had changed perceptibly, its passion chilled by the faint white influence of the moon. Turning into the back street, he paused before a small weathered building with "Henry Lake, Merchandise and Provisions" lettered across the false front. [562] Wilbur   Daniel Steele "Shut up a'ready," he mused with a hard-won sneer. "Stays home of evenin's now—the old bastard. I'll wring his dried-up neck—you watch." He moved on again, smoothing out his coat-folds and tipping the Panama further back and to the side, for he had to pass the house now. The perfectly inexplicable thing was that he should find himself so upset over Mamie Cabrai— Mamie Cabrai—a good-enough girl, but . . . He walked along the white pickets of the fence, shoulders squared back, heart-rending chin thrust forward in an heroic preoccupation, eyes fastened on the moon, where Fergus's willows chopped it into ragged white fragments. But, somehow, he could not get past the gate; he faltered there, set down the suitcase, and leaned his elbows on the posts. Through all the years of his boyhood he had played around that house of Lake's; later he had stalked past it going to or from his various vessels. And yet he could not have told anyone definitely what it looked like. He retained a dim impression of a grape-vine, that was all. Now he looked at it for the first time with eyes of interest, intense glowering interest. The vine, shooting thick and rough from the ground near the front door and sprawling haphazard over the dimming whiteness of the walls till it came to the semi-restraint of a pergola, touched the man's ponderous imagination and made him think of a snake, or a kind of guardian dragon. ."And them two are in there," he mumbled to himself. "Into the dark." He leaned still more heavily on the gate post, his garments melting into the luminous streak of the fence, his dark, working face invisible against a further hedge, only that monstrous exotic bloom of a hat hanging in the dusk, air-sustained. "Tony!   Oh—Oh, Tony Va Di!" It came from the side of the house where a bay-window sheltered beneath the vine-strangled pergola, a low cry. Va [563] A   Devil   of   a Fellow Di stood up rigid, leaning slightly backwards as if before a blow, his tongue running over his lips. He muttered: "Name of God!" The low cry repeated itself, half in appeal, half-ecstatic. "Ton'! Ton'!" Opening the gate, careless now of who might see or hear him, he strode along the nasturtium-bordered walk and stood beneath the pergola, staring at the window slightly above the level of his head. She was kneeling inside, so that no more than her head was visible against the interior darkness, and her forearms crossed on the sill, bare and brown and sweetly modelled. The last dim effulgence of the sunset warmed her right cheek, the other was chilled by the waxing power of the moon—like the two phases of a man's passion. Neither seemed to have any words, save those scared, triumphant articulations of their eyes. So they gazed at one another for a long time, while the knotted shadows of the vine established themselves upon the ground and the house-side, austere and grotesque. A slow bewilderment took hold of Va Di; something began to flutter in the back of his brain, an intolerable, weightless thudding, and the pupils of his eyes dilated curiously. He could not understand. He had an instinctive desire to huddle down or to turn and run away, as a coral-islander might feel, put down miraculously in the midst of the Himalayas. "Where—where is he?" he whispered by and by. "He's dead, Tony." "Dead!" "Three days, Ton'." The man took off his hat and stared into it; vaguely astonished at a jewel shining on the brim, he raised his hand to find tears rolling out of his eyes. He had an almost uncontrollable impulse to pray. "Old Lake's dead," he echoed in a shallow, vacant voice. [564] Wilbur   Daniel Steele Sluggish visions tumbled through his mind as he stared at Mamie's dark, unmoving eyes. "Wha'—what was ailin' of him?" "I killed him." The air about the open window grew dank and old, shot with a faint reek of never-opened rooms, unaired wall-paper, crumbs of funeral cakes and spilled wine, and a memory hanging about it of withered old dead limbs. Va Di shrank back till his shoulders touched an upright of the pergola. His face was yellow in the half-light and one yellow finger scratched ð cross on his breast. "You—y-y-you-" "I killed him, Ton'—after I got your letter." If she would take her eyes away for an instant, then he could run. "You—got it—then?" She nodded slowly. "I didn't tell nobody. Why? I don't know, Ton'. But then I prayed to all the saints that he would die, and to the Blessed Virgin, and even to Christ Hisself—and three days ago he fell off Maya's wharf and drownded." "O-o-oh!" It was not tears now that wet his cheeks, but sweat, released suddenly from its pores. "They can't git— you—for—that." "They can't. They can't. No. But-" For all the frightful, occult implication of her words, her eyes were still level and unfrightened, full of a deep, transfigured calm. Va Di could not live up to that; without ceasing he crossed himself and looked out of the corners of his eyes, as though fearful of beholding in that moon-checkered nook the form of a black, relentless priest. "Oh, Ton'," she called softly. He had to look at her, and even the cold exhalations of the night light could not kill the color sweeping her cheeks.   He became aware of her hand [565] A   Devil   of  a Fellow reaching out to him, wavering close before him; heedless of all things else, earthly and unearthly, he took it in his own and turned it over and kissed the palm—kissed it over and over again till it smothered him. "Mamie!" he cried, searching her face with his reckless eyes. "You're mine, ain't you, Mame? Ain't you?" He came nearer and stood on tiptoe to draw down her lips, but she went white at that and pulled back, fluttering her free hand over her bosom. "Ton'—Ton'!   Don't!   I—I ain't—smart—Tony." He stood perfectly quiet for a moment, as if struck there in stone by a flash of some Medusa-head. After a time, becoming aware that he still held the girl's hand in his, he let it drop abruptly. He began working his lips, as if they were stiff from long disuse.  His face was yellow and hard. "The hell you say!" Turning away he walked around the corner of the house, a singular woodenness in his knees. But he returned immediately to lean against the upright and confront her with his blighted rancor. "You didn't waste no time, did you." She did not appear to have grasped it yet. Once again he flung off around the corner, and this time he did not return. When he came into his own lane, gated with clumpy willows and at the further end fading out into the blue-white slope of a dune dotted with rubbish, he saw that the news had run ahead of him and all the neighborhood was out-of-doors, hiding in the dusty thoroughfare, shouting, sobbing, squealing. His mother lunged forward at sight of him, an old, ragged-haired woman, full of fecund years, tripping over the torn hem of her skirt. Va Di glowered at her, holding her off with his strong hands. She had been handsome once, too; even now there were fine foundation-lines which the folds of her cheeks, red [566] Wilbur   Daniel Steele and rutted like a rooster's wattles, could not altogether hide. "Ma!" he cried of a sudden. "Ma, I'm back." Folding her in his arms, he patted her back with a rough tenderness, and wept. Then all the others, who had come pattering, fell to weeping and screeching and pounding him on the back. They got, finally, into the house, a bleak, tall, narrow structure with peeling clapboards without and a pervasion of linoleum within; into the kitchen, full of all the essentials of life, a stove, a pump, a lithograph of the Virgin, a mahogany wardrobe leaking cornmeal and onions, a phonograph, cot bed, chairs and a table. Eight brothers and sisters had to be heard; a ninth came running in from her husband's house up-street, her stolid velocity not in the least hampered by the protuberance under her shawl, understood to be a nursing infant, miraculously adhesive. "You'll git the house painted," she murmered with a hint of severity to Angelina, seventeen, and in high school. "Yeh." Angelina had thought of that herself, having callers. His mother busied herself in an oily nimbus above the stove, frying a linguisa and other things, watching her firstborn all the while with convulsive tremors about her mouth which made her appear to grin, at intervals, idiotically. Va Di pounded the red table-cloth with the butt of his knife. "Ma, git a move onto that.  Ain't I told you I'm hungry?" "Well, ain't I hurryin'?" The old woman made the linguisa crackle by poking it with a knife. Va Di rubbed the back of his hand across his lips and justified himself. "Well, I'm hungry." He ate in silence, only once raising his voice, and his hands, to bid the company be quiet. "You make me nervous," he cried. After he had finished he got up and dusted the crumbs off his fine clothes, scratching an old spot with a thumb-nail and rubbing it with his coat-cuff, ran a hand through his [567] A  Devil  of  a Fellow straight, black hair, and lounged to the front door. His mother called after him with a curious cluck in her voice. "Where you goin', son?" "Aw, see the town." But he got no further than the step to the gate, where he leaned on his elbows and gloomed at the roofs across the lane. Curious ones passed, turned back, cleared their throats, and, seeing his face, did not speak. "A kid," he mumbled in his throat. "A kid off o' that crooked-legged old sow." And after another sour silence: "I never remembered what a good-looker she was. Say! And crazy about me.  But . . . Hell!" The moon swam high over the end of the lane, filling the dusty passage with its effulgent silver. The clear notes of Town Hall telling eleven floated across the huddled dwellings, and Va Di, wondering at the hour, looked about to find all the windows dark in the lane, save one toward the street end where a mandolin twinkled an Island melody. A solitary figure moved in the vista, coming nearer, a girl, dark-faced and with her dark hair piled on either side of her ears, wearing a white linen skirt and a crimson sweater. Opposite Va Di's gate she paused to kick a twig lying in the dust and discovered the man with a slight start. "I heard you're back," she said, drifting easily nearer. "Glad t'see you." The man smoothed his moustache. "Hullo, Mary. Didn't 'spect to see me again, eh, girlie?  How's things?" "Lookin' up, now." She leaned against the other side of the fence, smiling and fussing idly with her hair, her eyes lowered demurely. By and by she raised them, nonplused by his failure to go on, and found him staring at the sky as if he had forgotten she was there. She drifted away, after a time, flinging her shoulders a little, and once looking back with a wounded, malignant expression.   Va Di shook himself and [568] Wilbur   Daniel Steele stared after her, moved by a faint sensation of regret. "I must be turnin' foolish," he muttered to himself. For a moment he thought she was coming back, and straightened up with a not unaccountable thrill. But then he sank down again, recognizing old Baldy Minn by a faint flapping of soles, many sizes too large for her, on the dust. Baldy Minn had a wide, gelatinous person, forever billowing and breaking against the precarious dams of her clothing when she moved about; a silky gray beard blurred the contour of her chin; her small eyes floated in a brownish liquor, prying, inquisitorial, continually suspicious of women's figures, seeming to say: "Mmmm—so you're at it again. Don't lie about it, because you can't fool me." A most horrible old woman. She came flapping through the moonlight and stopped in front of the gate. "Ai, Ai!" she greeted in a strong, bubbly voice. "They telled me you're back, Va Di. Too much f the devil, was y'u? Well, Blessed Saints take pity onto the maids, if they's any lef' .  .  . Isy'rmaup?" "I dunno." Va Di was a little afraid of this woman, and disliked her accordingly. "I'll take a look," he mumbled, after enduring her eyes for a moment. He turned to the door and called: "Ma—hey there, Ma." A sudden faint crash sounded from the other end of the house, as if someone had started out of a doze and knocked something over. "Huh, Tony!  That you, Tony?" "A'right," Va Di grumbled.  "You c'n go in, Baldy Minn. .   .   .   Say-"   He peered at the bundle swinging in her hand, an old shawl stuffed full and exuding ragged ends of things.  "Say, what you want, this time o' night?" The old crone turned within the entry and winked a leering eye. "That big kettle o' y'r ma's," she bubbled. [569] A   Devil   of  a Fellow "Oh! O-o-oh, I git y'u. Who is it this time, Baldy Minn?" The woman grinned and flapped a hand at him with a horrible coyness. "None o' your beezness, anyhow." After a time, driven by an unaccountable restlessness, he moved into the house, felt his way softly along a wall and stood in what had been meant for the dining-room. The air was heavy and sour with the sleeping of the three younger boys, but the door was open a crack into the kitchen, and in the lean, bright aperture he could see Baldy Minn's face with all its dewlaps shivering. "I knowed it all along," she was saying. "I knowed she'd never carry it—ugh-ugh—not outa that old crook-leg." The boards groaned ever so slightly beneath Va Di's heels. His mother's voice came through the crack, heavy with the burden of ages. "I've hear of seven-monthers livin'." "I kep' one myself." The midwife's lips sucked in and exploded with a suggestion of defiance. "Mis' Deutra claims she kep' one oncet, but she never. Sam Raphael's boy 's a seven-monther an' I kep' him, and' don' you let nobody tell y'u diff'nt, Annie.   .   .   .   But a six-monther—Ugh-ugh. No." Va Di's mother had borne sixteen and brought up ten. He heard her now, moaning gently through her apron: "Well, well, I don't know—I don't know. ... I go long with you, Baldy Minn. Poor thing—poor thing. I put my shawl, go long with you, Baldy Minn." "Naw, ain't no need, Annie. I got Angie Bragg up there now, an' Rosie Courier's there anyhow. Gimme the kittle. She ought to be comin' 'long now. Rosie come down two hour ago. " She stood for a moment ringing the huge kettle with a thumb nail. "Won'er what started her up. She ain't fell or nothin' I hear of.  Well  .  . ." She flapped away along the dark hall, not a yard from the [570 Wilbur   Daniel Steele silent man, humming and bubbling between her gums. There was a long hush, broken only by the snores of the sleepers and the continuous, subdued moaning from the kitchen, like the chant of a vigil. Va Di went out as softly as he had come in, and stood by the gate, fanning his face with the big hat. "Damn," he mumbled, and after a moment: " 'Tain't none o' my fun'ral, though." Putting the hat on his head, he opened the gate, turned aimlessly toward the back country and mounted the clear, blue slope of the dune, picking his way mechanically amongst the scattered tomato cans and disemboweled bedticks and skeletons of barrels. Sitting down on the crest he became part of it, moon-colored and still. The night was so intolerably quiet that the ground-swell eating the beaches far off on the outside crept in to him, and he ruffled the sand with his feet because it made him think of his mother's moaning and her words: "Poor thing—poor thing." "God, how that girl looked at me," he remembered out loud.  "She l-l-" He jumped up and shuffled around; rolled a cigarette, wetting it too much with his tongue so that it fell apart; threw it away. "She l-l-loves me," he came out, more racked by the word than ever a child by his virgin oath. He found himself at the foot of the dune on the other side, his canvas shoes sucking up moisture from a bog. He climbed another hill, drawn back toward the town, and waded across it knee-deep in scrub and wild roses that tore triangular rents in his flannel trousers. Descending into the shadow of familiar trees, he hunched himself up to sit on the shingles of a pig-sty, and heard the sluggish animals, whose distant forebears he had beaten with furtive barrel-staves, grunt and roll over in the interior muck. He took out his knife and whittled the shingles, trying not to look at the house.  There was something incredibly fearful [571] A   Devil   of  a Fellow about its being awake in the midst of all the sleepers, staring him down with its lighted windows, profligate of kerosene and tallow. The kitchen door was open ; by and by a woman came and leaned in the bright rectangle, a silhouette of fatigue. This was Rosie Courier. She had been old Henny Lake's housekeeper as long as Va Di could remember. Sometimes she had served in the store. Va Di could think of her, immensely tall and tight-garmented behind the counter, her lean, brown face with its cheek-cords pressing in the corners of her mouth, hovering over his head, righteous and suspicious. Quite invisible as he was in the shadow, he could not keep from cringing a little against the roof as she stood there in the doorway, breathing and resting. Town Hall clanged a single note, full and round, and as if in answer another note came and hung among the leaves, a high, unmodulated animal-cry, torn carelessly from the tissues of a throat. The austere silhouette in the doorway straightened and disappeared. "Oh, my God!" Va Di breathed. As a boy he had always been sent to play with neighbor children on those days when brothers or sisters accrued to his family, and so he did not know. He had supposed he knew; he had had a leg broken once by a jibing boom, and he had seen plenty of men crushed or torn in the bad seconds of ocean fishing. But they had always screamed like human beings. The distracted ululation was in the trees again. "Don't," the man whispered. "For Christ's sake, M-a-m-i-e —d-o-n't!" He got down and tried to walk away, but found himself back again, leaning his crossed arms on the sty roof. He had to be doing something, to dull the blade of that outcry, and so he made up an unearthly anger at those shadows moving against the window-squares. "God damn you to hell!" he mumbled, shaking his white [572] Wilbur   Daniel Steele fists, "Why don't y'u do somethin'? Why don't y'u do somethin'?" He was aware of Baldy Minn's figure flapping out of the door, a yawling cat held at arm's length. He watched her slay the little beast, make some horrible business with a kitchen knife, and flap into the house again with the warm liver. He knew well enough that this would soothe the sufferer a little, tied with a cord around her neck, but he became more than ever furious at the shadowy transaction. He did not want Mamie's agony allayed a little; he wanted it stopped, definitely and forever. He stood up and bawled after the retreating midwife: "Ow! Ow! Ow!" Baldy Minn turned and peered into the night, wondering, shook the fleshy pendants of her head, crossed her billowy bosom with the hand that contained the liver and slammed the door shut. Without any clear transition, his hate shifted from "them" to "it."  It was "it" that was tearing and killing Mamie. "Damn it—I'd like to-"  The finger-nails ate into his palms. He hoped that "it" would die—that "it" would be a "six-monther," so there could be no possibility of its not dying. "Her and I would be-" His ravening speculations tumbled on into giddy chaos. The night was laced with threads of agony, exquisite, racking, prolonged, still prolonged. Va Di reached out and gripped either edge of the roof, as if to keep himself from sliding. He pleaded with it to stop. The interstices among the leaves of the overhanging willows were filled with the gore of imminent day; Ma Deutra's rooster crowed in his hollow house away down a flushing lane. But still that haggard utterance hung over the world. It ceased. A faint breeze came to life and wandered across the back yards, tumbling papers; a lark, as though bribed and timed, mounted into the sky and whistled his morning triumph; Va Di's head sank down on his arms, his [573] A   Devil   of  a Fellow knees caved in to rest against the side of the sty, and his fingers fell out flat on the shingles. He opened his eyes by and by to find Rosie Courier standing in the horizontal radiance of the sun, regarding him from the other side of the pen. Her face was the color of a dusty boot, lifeless and flabby. "She wants to see you," she said. "Who? Her?" She nodded stiffly, allowed the thick, mottled lids to droop over her eyes, and turned back toward the kitchen door. Va Di followed. In the kitchen Baldy Minn sat beside the sink, her hands working in a huge blossom of suds. The tight little nubbin of hair had shaken down off the bald spot, lending her a curious expression of wildness. "Was it—did-"   Va Di groped for words.   "Did it live, Baldy Minn?" "Did it live?" Her eyes rolled in their liquor, her whole person quivered and dashed against its margins, and she grinned at him, closing the rent in her teeth with a meaning tongue-tip.  "Did it live? Ho-ho-ho!" He turned away and followed Rosie Courier through a dark passage, smelling of life and death, and entered a room full of sunshine. Within the door a profound embarrassment laid hold of him; he shifted from foot to foot and looked down at the great hat revolving in his hands. Mamie was so white and still and all eyes, and the eyes dwelt upon him with such a spent and inscrutable adoration. He was afraid to look at her; he felt curiously like a figure done in clay, destructible and worthless. Her hand, all the opacity burned out of it, lay on the flowered "comfortable," and remembering suddenly how it had come out to him from last night's window, he fell down on his knees and laid his cheek against it and wept the tears of weakness. "Mamie," he sobbed in the wadding.    "You're a good [574] Wilbur   Daniel Steele girl, M-m-mamie." After a little a sound of snickering behind him brought him to his feet, his face flaming. It was Baldy Minn, almost filling the doorway with her oceanic being, against which the bundle in her arms seemed incredibly tiny and helpless. She advanced, undulating and bubbling, to lay it across Va Di's hastily-crooked arms, laughing at his panic. He held his chin stiff and his eyes desperately horizontal. "Naw, naw," he mumbled, "Somebody come." He turned to Mamie, appealing, and Mamie, moved by that irresponsible humor which is deeper than solemnity, smiled. "Ton'," she whispered unsteadily. "It's killin', Ton'— how he favors you. It makes me laugh, Ton'—you without the moustache, exactly.   I wisht you'd look, Ton'." His knees were no good; he sat down in a rocker and looked around the room for mental help. Rosie Courier, standing, a black, unimpeachable spire, beside the bureau, gave him none. Her lids were lowered and her thoughts had turned inward for refuge. By an irony, he had to come to Baldy Minn. Dirty, evil-fleshed, full of matter prurient, there still endured in her a flicker of that essential fire that lives, somehow, through all the changing winds of orthodoxies.  She had to express it, of course, in her own way. "You old devil," she bubbled benevolently. "I might o' knowed  .  . ." The bundle in Va Di's arms became articulate, demanding its primal planetary food. The man's muscles suffered a poignant sensation of combat, a gentle struggle with an infinitesimal kicking. His face became pink; his mouth-muscles contracted in that species of self-conscious smirk so hard for others to bear; he opened and closed his lips tentatively, as though they were quite new and uncertain of their powers. "He's—he's—he's a s-s-stout little bastard," he stammered, in all innocence. [575] The Cloud-Ring By Frederick Booth THE daytime dreamer slept.   The mixed rays of star, moon, and arclight hardly struggled through the unwashed panes of the window at the foot of his bed and gave the rough quilt that covered him nearly to his chin, the dun wall, the face of the daytime dreamer, the sort of dull shine that anything has in the light of dying embers. The daytime dreamer lay on his back in a weary attitude just as he had first got into bed. His cheek rested in his right hand. His left hand was spread out on the quilt, a spray of wan color without substance that sometimes trembled a little. His face was now calm and impassive: the weary and bitter look was gone. The forehead was smoothed out, until the morrow. Far away, in a tall white tower, a large clock struck one. The sleeper stirred not. He had undressed in his lighted room, smoking his last pipe, wearily aware of his familiar furniture, the rattle of belated wheels in the street, the hissing of his hot gas lamp, the make and color of his worn garments, the lassitude of his flesh: weary of his long daytime dreams which bore little fruit of his soul, weary of his evening's accustomed fevered idling which bore a bitter fruit that somehow in its bitterness was like unto the bitterness engendered in his soul by the decay, the ceaseless and inevitable decay and crumbling of his daytime dreams, eager, resentfully eager to lie down in the arms of Sleep, the gentle, the ineffectual destroyer, he had turned out the light and crawled under that [576] Frederick Booth old quilt, whose pattern, texture and color he hated as being too much like the diurnal habit and pattern of his life. At first he saw the dim outlines of his room and the spots where played the night lights of the world outside. He saw the window and the crooked white shade, he saw beyond the dirty window panes the sky and its impenetrable garden of stars and the beautiful incomprehensible white clouds sailing nowhere. These things vanished. His eyes had closed but he knew it not: the earth and sky were gone from his knowledge and there remained only a certain wan light. Slowly, along the descending spiral of one nocturnal hour the soul of this sleeper descended amidst shades, went down to the temple of Sleep. The clock in the tall white tower struck three more hours and for this long the soul of the dreamer stayed within that chamber where all was dark, where thoughts were black coals and white ashes and even the white ashes made not even a whitish spot in the darkness that ruled there. His soul bowed down in the darkness that ruled in that chamber where no tapestries of dreams or fancies were woven on the walls. But at last the soul of the dreamer went forth, robed in the darkness of the inner chamber which was more than darkness; went forth robed in oblivion, knowing not where it went. But the robe of darkness that is the mantle and sign of dreamless sleep dropped from the dreamer at last, and his soul, the daytime dreamer himself, saw that he was standing in a field. In this field it was an even twilight. The daytime dreamer thought he was awake. He saw the field. It was so wide he could not see its limits in any direction, for the twilight set a near limit on its horizons. The field was covered with little weeds that had died and shed most of their leaves. A wind ran and searched amongst their dry stalks and rattled them and whistled against them, making a sound that to the dreamer was a sound of enmity toward him and toward all [577] The Cloud-Ring the world. He looked abroad over the field first and about him on the ground, seeing the weeds and hearing amongst them the wind, which was a little wind, though it was hateful, and did not blow against him hard. When he had seen all of this he lifted his eyes and looked toward the sky. He saw against the sky thick gray clouds of a leaden color, and they rolled as they rode on a wind that bore them swiftly and with power, a mightier wind than the little one that whined and searched amongst the little weeds in the field. The dreamer wondered why he should be standing in this empty and cold place seeing nothing but black weeds and gray clouds and hearing nothing but a spiteful little wind. As if his thoughts had been heard, he saw under the gray clouds and far away in the direction from which the gray clouds came, a great white ring, a ring of cloud flying swiftly toward him, more swiftly far than the gray clouds flew. The cloud-ring was white, though no light shone upon it—it seemed to have the glow and brilliance of life itself that a white flower has. It flew with its circumference horizontal with the earth. The dreamer thought that it was like the aureole of some great god or spirit flying in the night time to him that should wear it in the morning. He looked with that kind of wonder one has in dreams upon this sprite of the darkness whose lacy edges fluttered so in the wind, which flew so swiftly and so straight and which he thought was beautiful and significant beyond its shape and whiteness, which he thought was supernally, strangely beautiful and significant, though it was only a cloud-ring. He thought it might even be a spirit, or the image and sign of a spirit. Already the cloud-ring was directly above him; it had come straight toward him and as it flew over his head and flew down the wind the dreamer thought that it saw him or that it knew he [578] Frederick Booth was there: it seemed to have sought him: he seemed to have come here to the field to be sought by it. There seemed to be a message or portent in that magic white circle. He turned and followed the cloud-ring with his eyes. Where would it go? Whence had it come? It seemed to him that a good and kindly omen had dropped upon him from the cloud-ring as it flew over his head—a benediction had descended upon him from it. He looked with wonder and longing, with subdued joy, after this strange thing. He wished that it might return again and let him look at it once more. He thought that if it came again some message that he could understand might fall from its magic circumference, from the shining band. He had a faint memory of his daytime troubles, his dying daytime dreams and the ashes they left behind, and he thought the cloud-ring might relate to that. He thought it might bring him light and happiness if it would only return again. Then when the cloud-ring had gone far down the wind and was about to go out of sight he saw that it turned southward and went in a great circle and flew back against the wind as swiftly as it had flown with it so that at last it again rode in the sky where the dreamer had seen it first. And a second time the cloud-ring flew down the wind toward him. The dreamer said in his heart, Now the cloud-ring, the mystic symbol, will tell me its secret, will let descend upon me as it passes a message from On High. He said that the cloud-ring saw him, it had a supernal vision, not of eyes. And it had sought him out, he was the chosen, the fortunate one. Now it would drop upon him its message, its good saying. And the cloud-ring, whiter between the gray clouds and black earth than a lily on a troubled lake, came down again toward the dreamer to fly over his head. No message, no great saying, descended upon him, but he thought that it said, [579] The Cloud-Ring The third time, when I pass the third time I will make clear unto you my meaning. And it flew swiftly down the wind as if to hurry upon the third circuit, as if to make haste to come to him again. The dreamer looked after it, saying in his heart, I will wait until it comes again. And while he was thinking thus and while he marked how the cloud-ring grew fainter and smaller as it drew near to the place where it would turn to the southward he heard a great whistling in the sky over behind him. He turned about in order to look and see what made this whistling noise. He saw in the sky, high up under the gray clouds, a great flight of birds, a flock of birds vast in extent that made even darker the earth beneath as clouds darken the heavens and the earth. These birds were flying down the wind with a great whirring of wings. The dreamer thought that there before him in the heavens were all the birds of the earth, flying before his eyes, flying down the wind with joy as if they flew on a journey of happiness. He saw them pass before him in seemingly endless flight and their wings whistled with the speed of their flight. There were birds of gay and birds of sober plumage. They were of all sizes, birds of all habits, all habitats. But they flew at the same speed, they flew together before the wind as one great cloud. And the dreamer saw that a great ostrich flew with the rest, his plumes fluttering, and though he knew even in his dream that this was an incongruous thing he was not astonished for he thought that this was an ordained flight of all the birds. He thought that this universal flight of birds was a wonderful thing, coming to pass in a night of wonders. His soul was beguiled by these birds whistling down the wind like arrows and he forgot the cloud-ring. He was lifted up among the birds, his head was in the midst of them and he saw their flight near at hand.   But they looked not at him: they flew [580] Frederick Booth as birds fly, they were as birds are, mere wanton creatures of the air and earth, intent on flight and their happy destination and they only made a great whistling in his ear. The dreamer, wondering, was disappointed for that they were only as other birds and had no supernal qualities. The last two birds flew past him and away. The sky was empty where they had flown, save for the gray clouds. The dreamer stood again on the ground where he had stood when he first saw the cloud-ring, and he bethought him again of it, saying, Now I will see the cloud-ring the third time and know what it has to tell me. But he saw only the gray clouds rolling on a great wind that bore them with power, in the east and the west and the north and the south.   He stood alone in the field. Then the dreamer in his dream grieved and said in his heart, I looked at the birds of all plumages and whilst I looked at them and was beguiled the cloud-ring came the third time and I saw it not.   Now it is lost to me. Darkness came again upon the soul of the dreamer, the darkness that descends upon man when he sleeps and dreams not. When he awoke he hailed the day with bitter thoughts. He thought of all the other days, full of dreams that came and went empty—this day would be like them. He reminded himself, too, of the evening that would follow the day, and the night that would follow the evening, like other evenings, full of the merriment of fools and hypocrites, those who laugh when they are unhappy; and like other nights, full of black thoughts and black sleep. Then he remembered the dream he had had, the cloud-ring; it came again and filled the chambers of his mind. He thought to himself that there must be something in that dream, a meaning. So he made an interpretation of it according to his own lights, for and against all the contrarieties [581] The Cloud-Ring of his nature. When he had done so he resolved soberly to change the pattern of his life according to his interpretation of the dream: he became earnest and set about to fill his daytime dreams with life. So he did many fanciful works, which were according to the pattern of his daytime dreams and beautiful. He wrote poems, prose poems and poems that were set to rhyme and regular meter; he wrote plays; he wrote prophecies, for he was an ascetic sort of dreamer and dwelt much on immortality. His days were filled with writing. And like many of those who work in earnest and who are ascetic, when each day's work was done he made a prayer to the morrow and went to bed, under that old quilt. Many days he worked and as long as he worked he drank, as they say, water out of a wooden bowl. All of this was according to his reading of the message in the cloud-ring. There came a time when the last fancy and the last prophecy that he had in his head were put down on paper. Now for a time his head would be empty of those things that delight poets, prophets and dreamers. For a while he would be satisfied like a man who has drunk his fill of a spring. He would thirst again, soon, for the volatile crystals of dreams and poetry, but not yet. So he sat down to rest from his labors. He sat before the window in the spring evening and looked out into the little street. The sunlight cast a ruddy glow on the red brick houses and the daytime dreamer looked at this with pleasure; he heard with pleasure the cries of the children and the ring of feet on the pavement. Now within his soul memory awoke and showed forth her specious treasures to the dreamer, for such a long time kept hidden. For so long now he had lived like an old hermit and during the time of his hermitage he had seen people, even his friends, as shadows, and voices as a faint wind. Now again, memory made him see faces, made him hear [582] Frederick Booth voices. These were of old associations, old times. In his mind's eye he saw a certain woman. He saw her as a cameo set in a plaque of gold lightly carven and inlaid with more than one rich color. Thoughts of all that had once burned him with its fire stirred him much though at one time these things had wearied him; and passion again made his temples hot. He had done much work. Now he would go again amongst people, he would know again life and love, he would go again amongst the people, the sad and happy people, those who hate and love, who laugh and cry, who tremble and are glad, and who are forever living and forever dying. Said the dreamer to himself he would go again amongst them, the happy dying people   .   .   .   birds ffymg down the wind. [583] A Modern Accident By Peter Minuit I WAS impanelled a few weeks since as juryman in an accident case. I confess I served willingly. The opportunity to observe legal procedure from the safe and impersonal point of view of the jury box seemed most attractive. And so I obeyed the summons gladly, and rendered myself shortly before ten o'clock in the part of the City Court presided over by Justice Harold Rabinowitz. To my surprise, the courtroom was crowded. There were present when I arrived men of all ages and all degrees, and others filed in continually. A neighbor informed me that all these citizens had been called for jury duty. And for several minutes I reflected on the extreme wisdom of the law, that summoned all ranks and all conditions of men, and made use of their varying experiences and understandings in order to obtain justice. How superior, I thought, is our free and democratic system to the autocratic legal institutions of France and Germany! However, I retained my sentiment of pride but a short while. Hardly had the judge seated himself behind his high desk, when a clerk announced that all jurors who held positions of trust and responsibility, all who were managers of large business enterprises, all who had distinguished themselves in the conduct of affairs of whatever character, in fact, all jurors with ability, energy, and sureness of judgment, would be excused from duty without question. No sooner had this announcement been made than the major portion of those present quit the courtroom, leaving only a [584] Peter Minuit handful of timid and depressed men. I and eleven others were impanelled, and sworn in on a small block of wood. Directly before the jury box there stood a lengthy table. Several men came and seated themselves at it. One of them arose and addressed us, explaining the nature of the case about to be tried. It was what is termed an "accident case." Suit was being brought by a lawyer against a certain Mr. Napolitano, alleged to be an owner of real estate in the City of New York. This lawyer, whose name was Apponyi, I believe, claimed that a certain Mrs. Peter O'Toole lived in a tenement house, and that this house belonged to the said Mr. Napolitano. He further claimed that, owing to the negligence of the landlord, there was a staircase in the said house, and that one evening Mrs. O'Toole had fallen down it. As a result of this fall, the lawyer claimed that his own wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Apponyi, had suffered severe injuries, had had a miscarriage, was forced to keep her bed for days in succession, and could give him neither her society nor her services, to both of which he was rightfully entitled. Therefore, he brought suit against Mr. Napolitano, charging him with negligence, and demanding a monetary indemnity. After the jury had been examined and found satisfactory, witnesses were called. The array of evidence was truly imposing. First, several persons were introduced to prove that there was a staircase in the tenement of Mr. Napolitano. This was a grave point, hotly contested by the defence. Then, it was conclusively shown that in order to get from one floor to another, it was necessary to make use of the staircase, and that in descending the steps, it was advisable to hold on to the bannisters. After this evidence had been produced, three physicians appeared in succession. They testified that Mrs. Apponyi had suffered grievously through her miscarriage, that she was ailing, and scarcely able to resume her duties. [585] A  Modern Accident When asked whether this condition was induced by Mrs. O'Toole's accident, they swore roundly that there could be no doubt of it. At this point, the plaintiff rested his case. By order of the Justice, counsel for the defense then rebutted. "Gentlemen of the jury," he said, "my learned opponent has endeavored to persuade you that my client, Mr. Napoli-tano, owns this tenement. In other words, gentlemen, he wishes you to believe that he owns real estate in the City of New York. Gentlemen, in the name of all fairness, I resent that imputation! There is nothing before you, gentlemen, to prove my client guilty of anything of the sort. In fact, had 1 thought it necessary, I would have brought before you any number of witnesses to prove that he is in all ways an honorable man, fair in business and upright in all his relationships. The accusation that my learned opponent has levelled against him is absolutely without foundation! Gentlemen, this man does not own real estate! On the contrary, he is in every way worthy of your respect and admiration, and I beg you to dismiss from your minds all prejudice that my opponent's insinuation might have lodged there. Gentlemen, I do not deny that Mrs. O'Toole fell downstairs, nor do I deny that in consequence Mrs. Apponyi came to misfortune. But I do deny that it has been proven that my client owns a house in this city, and, therefore, gentlemen, I ask you to find a verdict in his favor." When he had concluded, and seated himself, counsel for the plaintiff arose. "Your Honor, and gentlemen of the jury," he began, "I will not affront your intelligence by pretending that my client, Mr. Apponyi, has a case. I am positive that it would be useless to attempt to mislead you into believing that he has. I see that you are surprised by my candor. Doubtless, you are wondering why I should confess as much to you, and not permit your natural distrust of the propertied classes, your [586] Peter Minuit pity for the sufferings of the poor, and especially for those of women, to influence you in favor of my client. Well, the truth is, that I am quite sure that if I tell you the actual facts, you will award him a larger damage than if I suppressed them.  Gentlemen, these are the facts: "The father of Mr. Apponyi, my client, was a bricklayer. Now, as you know, bricklaying is neither a richly paid nor a highly respected trade. The father of Mr. Apponyi often regretted his occupation. And he determined that his son should not have to follow in his footsteps, that he should have a more profitable and respectable business. And so he made him a lawyer. "Gentlemen, the tragedy of it is that Mr. Apponyi has not the slightest talent for practising law. He has neither the astuteness, the personal presence, the business sense, nor, wanting these, the influential connections that make for success in it. Perhaps, were the profession less crowded, he might be able to perform a certain amount of service valuable to the community. But, since it is so unfortunately overcrowded, he, and all others in his situation, instead of being called upon to serve the purposes of the law, call upon the law to serve their own purposes. And so they bring actions of this kind. What else are they to do? It is too late for most of them to learn a trade, or enter a business house. Most of them have wives and children to support, and cannot begin life anew. Their one means of livelihood consists of whipping up processes of this sort. "I do not blame them. In fact, I am always glad to accept their cases for very small remuneration. For, after all, it is society that put them into the positions they now hold, by underpaying the skilled trades, by giving such valuable occupations as bricklaying scant respect, and by permitting parents to do with their children as they will. And, in the last analysis, it is society that pays for the wrong it has done. The [587] A Modern Accident property owners who are sued to keep this man and his family alive are well insured with insurance companies. In order to cover their premiums, they raise the rentals of their tenements. Their tenants, forced to give more for housing, join unions and so increase their wages. And the public at large pays their wages. In this way, justice is done, and society makes good again its errors. Therefore, gentlemen, I ask you to make use of the power that is yours, and right the wrong done my client by an inefficient state, by returning a verdict in his favor." After he, in his turn, had seated himself, the Justice arose and addressed the jury. He told us that the question before us had nothing whatsoever to do with the evidence. The question before us—in fact, the only question before any jury —was whether we wished to remain in the jury-room in the interests of justice. He reviewed the aspects of the question. There was much to be said on both sides. If, on the one hand, we wished to remain in the jury-room, we would probably have to go without our dinner, and might even be locked up for the night. If, on the other, we did not, we would be able to reach home well in time for the meal. He left it to the insight of the jury to see the truth of the matter. As for the case actually before us, he begged us not to worry unnecessarily over it. He had fully weighed the evidence, and had quite firmly decided the merits himself. He was not to be shaken in his opinion that we ought to find a verdict in favor of the lawyer for the plaintiff, who was personally sympathetic to the court. He was obviously a gentleman, never intricated the court in difficult situations, quoted the choice legal axioms gracefully, in fact, was the very type of man the court was most anxious to see at the bar. In the light of his personal opinion, the Justice asked us to return a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. This we did.  We filed into the jury-room, put our feet up [588] Peter Minuit on a table there for that purpose, and listened to several of the more experienced members of our little group of serious thinkers recount some of the cases on which they had sat. From their stories it was easy to glean that General Sessions was the only court in which it was at all amusing to serve, for there alone cases of rape and murder came to hearing. Finally, when it became late, we decided to find a unanimous verdict in favor of the judge. The court had adjourned at three o'clock. So we handed in a sealed verdict, were presented with twenty-five cents, and returned home proudly as servants of the City of New York, and engines of human justice. [589] Some Little-Known Poems By Heinrich Heine (Translated by Louis Untermeyer) Prologue GOOD-FORTUNE is a giddy maid, Fickle and restless as a fawn; She smoothes your hair; and then the jade Kisses you quickly, and is gone. But Madam Sorrow scorns all this, She shows no eagerness for flitting; But, with a long and fervent kiss, Sits by your bed—and brings her knitting. From the Window WELL, this is awful weather; Storming with rain and snow! I sit at the window, staring Into the darkness below. A little glimmering brightness Goes down the uncertain street— A lantern, and a mother With tired and stumbling feet. [590] Heinrich Heine I think it's eggs and flour That the old lady has bought To bake a cake for her daughter, The lazy good-for-naught. Yawning at home on the sofa, She lies in front of the blaze— The golden hair is falling About her golden face. Doctrine BEAT on the drum and blow the fife, And kiss the vivandière, my boy. Fear nothing—that's the whole of life; Its deepest truth, its soundest joy. Beat reveillé, and with a blast Arouse all men to valiant strife. Waken the world; and then, at last, March on... .That is the whole of life. This is Philosophy; this is Truth; This is the burning source of joy! I've borne this wisdom from my youth, For I, too, was a drummer-boy. A Warning YOU will print such books as these? Then you're lost, my friend, that's certain. If you wish for gold and honor, Write more humbly—bend your knees! [591] Some   Little-Known Poems Yes, you must have lost your senses, Thus to speak before the people, Thus to dare to speak of preachers And of potentates and princes! Friend, you're lost, so it appears: For the princes have long arms, And the preachers have long tongues, —And the masses have long ears! Angélique ALTHOUGH you hurried coldly past me, Your eyes looked backward and askance; Your lips were curiously parted, Though stormy pride was in your glance. Would I had never tried to hold you, Nor seek your white and flowing train! Would I had never found your footsteps, Or seeking them, had sought in vain! Now, all your pride and wildness vanished, You are as tame as one could be; Gentle, and sweet beyond endurance— And, worse, you are in love with me ! Losses YOUTH is leaving me; but daily By new courage it's replaced; And my bold arm circles gaily Many a young and slender waist. [592] Heinrich Heine Some were shocked and others pouted; Some grew wroth—but none denied. Flattery has always routed Lovely shame and stubborn pride. Yet the best is gone.  Too late, I'd Give my soul for it, in truth. Can it be the blundering, great-eyed, Sweet stupidity of youth? To George Herwegh HERWEGH, you lark of iron! You rise on a swift and jubilant wing, Toward sunlight and freedom, Liberty's lover! Is the long winter really over? Is Germany really awake to the Spring? Herwegh, you lark of iron, Because your passionate flight is long You have forgotten earth's condition. The Spring you hail with such a vision Has blossomed only in your song. [593] From the Seas By Kaj Klitgaard I. THE whale goes in the Northern waters. It dives up and looks into the sunset. And the moose in the woods of Canada.   He looks over the lake—great and calm.   He hears men speak three miles away. I will lose myself in Nature: I will become a cry, and lose myself as echoes among the Mountains. No one can hurt me. The fire can embrace me; the water can close itself above me; or I can crush myself against the earth; and I only resolve into air, water, and earth: from which I am taken. ¦ Oh, to know oneself immortal!   To think that I shall fly into Space as heat, motion, or a bundle of light-rays. Or perhaps spring out of the earth again as daisies. And perhaps my daughter in the fourth generation will pluck me and tear off the white leaves to see if she is loved. Perhaps I'll be eaten by a roe, and become gracious motions. Possibly I'll fall in battle and die in a wheat field; and my substance will be sucked up through the straw and into the fat grain. Maybe I then will be eaten by a man and become a murder, a genial thought, or a love poem. Or be boiled or brewed and be poured in a bottle and drunk by a laborer and become a hiccough in the sunshine. Or poured on rose-leaves that once were a young virgin, and we [594] Kaj Klitgaard together rise like sweet scent to delight little girls or an old lady. Oh, the infinity of these thoughts! Like millions of flowers they shoot out in my brain and heart. Possibly I shall, as the green color in the Italian flag on a battle painting, through hundreds of years be looked upon by people, who, seeing the battle, do not see the beautiful relation in which I stand to a red color in the picture: a red color which maybe once was the woman I loved. Imagine dying in a ditch and becoming part of the multitudinous life therein! Becoming beetles, caterpillars, butterflies, grass, and dandelions! Or becoming a line in the chart from Cape Agulhas to the Equator. Behold the great French sailing ship gliding through the seas at Cape Horn. Behold these motions: have they not once been dancing Greek maidens? Shall I possibly become two seconds? Or can I possibly become Nothing? II. Music (piano, pianissimo) Now: God strikes a match in Heaven and a soft glimmer of rose-red lays itself new-born upon the clouds. Sunrise! Unquenchable shafts of light hurl themselves over the horizon; fanfare of a thousand trumpets; the Heavens are afire; the sun-ball rolls out. The little crescent runs over the sky in the North like a flying Mohammedan. The meridian on 720 West-longitude awakes and trembles. [ 595 ] From   the Seas Equator chuckles; he sleeps with one eye and is awake with the other the whole day. Then lies the day delivered   .   . . This is intended as a letter from the Panama Canal, but since I have been there I have sailed through 2,000 miles of Pacific Ocean, and what is the Panama Canal compared with 2,000 miles of Pacific Ocean? Down along the volcanic west coast of South America I have sailed, and it was like sailing along the edge of the Moon. The Panama Canal is like the handle of a fan that unfolds itself toward the West as the nearest way to the East. Its long ribs are the steamship lines to San Francisco, Yokohama, Hongkong, Melbourne, Valparaiso. And Uncle Sam smiles and fans himself, and the gold eagles fly into his coffers. Along the banks of the Gatun Lake remain dead trees, gray-white ghosts in the sunshine. They drowned when the Gatun Dam was blown up, and the Atlantic surged into the trough. When the waters settled white men rowed about in boats and plucked orchids from the tree-tops—think of that! Those men I envy. The boss of the Canal gang that came on board was a negro. But far away back among his ancestors grins a Chinaman; I can see it by his cheekbones and his almond-shaped eyes: his almond-shaped eyes which make me think of an Idol I once saw. He is afraid of the dead woods. He says someone speaks within. Yes—perhaps someone speaks within. Perhaps in French. Perhaps it is the green bronze man from Port Said who walks within and strokes his beard and looks upon his old canal. From behind the woods towered a crane, an enormous crane. It eclipsed in size everything I hitherto had seen.  Quite co- [ 596 ] Kaj  Klitgaard lossal it designed itself against the sky; like a prehistoric monster it stuck its neck above the naked trees. I heard the Canal pilot tell there had been two. They had arrived from Germany. And they quite looked as if they had swum across the Atlantic—aye!—I suppose they swam over energetically, in a tempest, to be along where other giants worked. They would lift the gate-locks to their places. But under the test collapsed the female, carrying a weight of i$o tons. I stood on the bridge and looked toward the coast. Then came the Captain's fair daughter and told me about a book she was reading: "Ships That Pass in the Night." But although women are fascinating I couldn't bear to listen, and turned my head away and looked out at the seagulls. And I observed that they sometimes dipped the end of one wing in the water to quicken a turn. And I thought they had discovered this recently. And I composed a myth wherein Darwin was the chief character. Something about a little hand or an oar. I went ashore last night to write about this Canal. I went up a mountain and looked out over the many lights of the City. Then I heard a voice saying: "All this shall be thine if thou wilt fall down and worship me." I laughed. "My friend," I said, "I just came here to worship you." And I went down to the temples. Arrived there I sat down before a table whereat already was seated a Catholic priest. He smiled at me. I told him about my meeting on the mountain, and in return he wrote three little verses on the table. Their thought and rhythm might perhaps be rendered in English thus:— [ 597 ] From  the Seas God's greatness greatest is The Sunrise hour; His standards red upon the mountains tower. Yea—God is great. Benign too; And next to Primal Thought, The Earth-Idea with Man and Sun is fraught. Benign, yea. And God is wise. At even-tide he hangs The lamp of Sun into another land. Yea, God is wise. Then he mentioned something about the Saints which I didn't understand, and he spoke of the Virgin Mother. I was freezing, and I got up and went away. I thought, How queer it is—here sits this man, and his soul is, no doubt, a beautiful crystal, but he bepeoples the Great Unknowable with holy images and three gods. He is not even their father, he has not made them himself. And I thought further, as I went up to my lodgment, I thought sometime I would create a flock of Gods, and I should over-reach Michelangelo, El Greco and Jehovah in power, beauty, and malevolence. I shall make them worthy of the Heavens, I shall not mould them gently between my hands—I shall pound them, kick and terrorize them into shape, shout life into them; like an enormous star-fog they shall traverse the Milky Way: they shall kill me when I have created them   .   . . Ï! I were satisfied if God pulled Aconcagua out of the earth, pulled it out with its root. Sucked fast in the center of the earth it has been, and is glowing and dripping. [598] Kaj Klitgaard And where the drops fall in the Pacific it sizzles and boils. Aye! then let him take this long root and strike the Moon a red streak right across the face. I look about me and I observe that I am alone in the beginning of Time, and between my hands I have Allfoldness; but I make not suns, planets, moons, asteroids, ether—no! I make a bewinged man! Ha-ha! and I make him glowing and radiant like the Sun. What then would there be beside him? Nothing—nothing. And he shall feel so lonely that he breaks off his fingers and sows them in Space and starts to search for them again. I woke up   .   . . I heard a drop of water fall from somewhere down into my spittoon.   By and by fell another: "Two," I counted. "Three." I waited. "Will it never come?" I waited.  I began to walk. "If I walk quite slowly I'll hear it fall." Suddenly I am grasped by the neck and shaken furiously, shaken quite furiously. I struggle; but after a while I slacken down. When the Power feels I cease to fight, it lets me fall. I fall, and fall. I look downward, but see nothing but the empty space. Then I bend my head back and behold a telephone. I take the receiver, and hear my name spoken, far away. And I whisper into the tube : "You are so little and dear, You are just like a rose in the rain. You open yourself up toward me, And bend yourself down before me : You are just like a beautiful red rose." [599] From the Seas For a long while I listen. Then I hear—it is as if you looked tenderly at me. It is as if your arm were around me and your left hand around my neck   .   . . Then I understand that I am listening to a conversation, and a feeling of sorrow goes through me, so blood-raising and thick that my slumbering brain cannot hold it. I wake up again. Thus plots the fever in me. And I arose and threw the shutters from the window. It was still night. High above Cordillias stood the Southern Cross. And humbly I thought into it: "Before the mountains were and You made the Earth, Yea! though a thousand ages of Sun, Art Thou! God." Once, far away from here, forty million miles from here, when the earth was on the other side of the Sun, did I look over the Southern European Alps into Cassiopeia and thought the same. Thus diverge these two thoughts from each other more and more,—until once again they meet. Thus does the distance between these two thoughts become greater and greater—until once again they meet. [600] Orange of Midsummer By Amy Lowell YOU came to me in the pale starting of Spring, And I could not see the world For the blue mist of wonder before my eyes. You beckoned me over a rainbow bridge, And I set foot upon it, trembling. Through pearl and saffron I followed you, Through heliotrope and rose, Iridescence after iridescence, And to me it was all one Because of the blue mist that held my eyes. You came again, and it was red-hearted Summer. You called to me across a field of poppies and wheat, With a narrow path slicing through it Straight to an outer boundary of trees. And I ran along the path, Brushing over the yellow wheat beside it, And came upon you under a maple-tree, plaiting poppies for a girdle. "Are you thirsty?" said you, And held out a cup. But the water in the cup was scarlet and crimson, Like the poppies in your hands. "It looks like blood," I said. "Like blood," you said, "Does it? But drink it, my Beloved." [601] Fee Fo Fum By John Chapin Mosher Persons in the play: Rapunzel. Curdken. Fee Fo Fum, the giant, who, however, does not appear in person. SCENE: A room in the palace of Fee Fo Fum. The hangings suggest great luxury and spaciousness. In the center lies an immense divan covered with rich draperies and pillows brilliantly colored in scarlet and orange and purple, and especially cloth of gold. The divan is so low that when Rapunzel and Curdken lounge Upon it they have no difficulty in reaching the fruit, held in a golden salver on the floor, or the cups of wine. Rapunzel and Curdken are dressed in the garments that the poor heroes and heroines who were not princesses wore in the days the Brothers Grimm describe to us. The action takes place only at the front of the stage. As the curtains are drawn, Rapunzel and Curdken are feasting on the fruit and wine. CURDKEN I like fat black grapes. RAPUNZEL What rich brown loaves of cake Fee Fo Fum gave us to eat last night! How good they were . . . with raisins in them! [602] John   Chapin Mosher CURDKEN Seven days ago we were starving. RAPUNZEL (Biting a large grape.) Seven days ago I scratched my hands searching for blueberries in the forest   How white my hands are now! Don't you think I have beautiful hands? CURDKEN Your hands have always been beautiful to me. RAPUNZEL Now they are like a queen's. I am of a queen's race. My aunt was that Rapunzel whose red gold hair made a ladder for her lover. CURDKEN We have always been poor folk. Though my step-mother told me once my great-great grandfather wore for a whole day the seven league boots. RAPUNZEL Fee Fo Fum must give me rings for my hands. CURDKEN Do you not sometimes wonder that he gives us anything at all? No one used to give us anything . . . when we starved in the city. RAPUNZEL In the city they give only to the rich, because they know the rich alone can do the same unto them. CURDKEN (Moodily putting down his cup of wine.) I am afraid of the giant. RAPUNZEL He knows what we are worth. He appreciates us. That is why he gives to us. Ã 603] Fee   Fo Fum CURDKEN They say he eats gnomes. RAPUNZEL He spears them with his three-pronged fork. CURDKEN The goosegirl who married a prince was afraid of Fee Fo Fum.  Why was she afraid? RAPUNZEL Because she was a goosegirl.  Queens are never afraid. CURDKEN Are you a queen now? Seven days ago you were only a cobbler's daughter. RAPUNZEL Could a cobbler's daughter have hands like that? CURDKEN Because the giant has given you rich wine and silk robes, have you become a queen? Are those the things that make a queen? RAPUNZEL I have always been a queen. But the world does not know you are a queen unless you wear jewels and eat cakes. You do not even know it yourself. CURDKEN Are the high places of the world built only on such things? RAPUNZEL On what else? CURDKEN Why should we bow down to kings, and fight for them, and guess riddles for them, only because they eat cakes and wear cloth of gold? [604] John   Chapin Mosher RAPUNZEL Because they may give us cloth of gold and make us kings too.  It is very simple. CURDKEN When Fee Fo Fum saw us come from the city into the forest in search of blueberries, why did he urge us to come to his house? RAPUNZEL He saw the stupid city did not perceive what we were worth.  He has merely given us our rights. CURDKEN I do not understand it, but I am afraid of my rights. RAPUNZEL {With a laugh, and pouring him a cup of wine from the flask.) Drink more wine. Eat grapes. Then you will fear nothing.   Soon you will be a prince. CURDKEN I should rather be a poet than a prince. RAPUNZEL When you were a poet, you starved. CURDKEN It is easy to understand starving. But precious things have something terrible about them. RAPUNZEL Hunger is the only terrible thing in the world. CURDKEN When I was hungry I wrote songs. Now I have everything I can only be afraid. [ 605 ] Fee   Fo Fum RAPUNZEL (Snuggling luxuriously back on the couch.) I cannot live now without everything.  Since I have learned I am a queen that would not become me. CURDKEN (Who has put aside the fruit and the cups; the poet in him coming to the fore begins to seek some meaning in it all.) When I was poor I laughed at poverty.   Now that I am no longer poor, I am afraid of it.  Is that not strange? RAPUNZEL (Rather bored.) Only the rich fear poverty. CURDKEN I cannot bear to think now of the water of the well. I hate the memory of pieces of black bread. But until seven days ago I ate nothing but black bread, and drank always of the water of the well. RAPUNZEL Until seven days ago I stitched leather in my father's shop. When I walked barefooted in the streets, the hired soldiers from other countries called after me from the inns.  And I was to wed a poet.  Now I am a queen. CURDKEN But will you not wed me now? RAPUNZEL When you cease to be afraid and become a prince, then I will wed you. CURDKEN Rapunzel, Rapunzel, are you not mine more than you are a queen? [606] John   Chapin Mosher RAPUNZEL A queen cannot live in a garret. Whoever heard of a queen in a garret? CURDKEN But the giant who gives us all things will not allow us to live in a garret. RAPUNZEL Since he has taught us how to live as befits our dignity, he will expect us to do so.  I must wed a prince. CURDKEN If you are a queen, am I not a prince? RAPUNZEL You are afraid. CURDKEN But I will not ask you to live in a garret.   I will give you all a queen desires. RAPUNZEL How shall you do that? CURDKEN (Eagerly building his point.) My dear, I know why Fee Fo Fum feasts us with cakes and wines. RAPUNZEL Why? CURDKEN Because he knew you had the hands of a queen . . . RAPUNZEL That is true. CURDKEN And because he had read my poems. (Triumphantly.) He will buy my poems. [607] Fee   Fo Fum RAPUNZEL The things you wrote in your garret! CURDKEN I wrote them in a garret in the city, but they were always of beautiful things. I wrote of the carved jewels of kings. I wrote of the broad streets of capitals, of feasts, and of fair women who dance because they love life so. I wrote too of gallantry and soft-spoken words, of young boys and girls who had never been struck across the face or thrown into the gutter to sleep at night. Those things never happened to the people I wrote about. RAPUNZEL Tell me a poem. CURDKEN It is about the gardens of the very rich. RAPUNZEL Yes ... I should know about them now. CURDKEN (Reciting with all the glow of the creator. Rapunzel watches him a moment, then smoothes her hair, stares at the fruit dish, and examines her nails.) I like well-tailored gardens best, With smart stalks of asters and striped lilies . . . Smooth strips of close-clipped lawn, Foxgloves and violets and marigolds; One crisp red rose, Assured as is a woman of the town, Who has saved money; Hydrangeas cowled with lace as rich As wore those nuns of old, Who polished altar floors so bright, [ 608] John   Chapin Mosher They saw their faces in them when they kneeled to pray. In such a starched and well kept garden, I know I could walk naked, And in courtesy each blade of grass would turn aside. RAPUNZEL (Laughs heartily.) I cannot marry you. CURDKEN (Terribly hurt.) Rapunzel! RAPUNZEL No one will buy that.   We should starve. CURDKEN But may not a princess love a poet? RAPUNZEL I may love you . . . yes. And when I pass by you with my ladies in the garden of the palace, I shall sigh and toss you a rose. CURDKEN What shall I do? RAPUNZEL You will press my rose to your lips, and take it with you to your garret, and write a song about it. And the people who sing your song in the streets will wonder who the lady is you love so much. CURDKEN And you? RAPUNZEL I shall wed a prince. It will be arranged for me. He will come from the far country where they hire the soldiers. He will be old but very great. Our countries will rejoice, but I shall weep a little in secret and think of the rose I flung you. [609] Fee   Fo Fum CURDKEN Is that all life will hold for us? RAPUNZEL Of course if you were a prince . . . CURDKEN Then you might wed me? RAPUNZEL At our wedding I fear I could not grow very pale, or fall in a swoon when you kissed me. CURDKEN You will laugh.   The world will call you the laughter-loving bride. RAPUNZEL The whole world . . . yes. CURDKEN The laughter of our life together, and the feasting, and the dancing will spread abroad throughout our kingdom. The black gnomes will fly to the mountains, and the princesses held captive in the stumps of trees will escape and throng to our court. (In the exuberance of his vision he seizes Rapunzel in his arms.  She pushes him aside and rises majestically.) RAPUNZEL That is not how a prince must love. (She pulls from the couch a long drapery of cloth of gold and arranges it about her, Curdken watching her puzzled.) RAPUNZEL Now, Curdken, I shall show you how a prince woos a queen. CURDKEN I shall woo you all ways. [610] John   Chapin Mosher RAPUNZEL But I must make you a prince first. (She hesitates a moment, uncertain how to perform this feat, then rips a strip from the cloth of gold and binds it about Curdkens forehead.) RAPUNZEL Now you have a crown.  You should have a sword. CURDKEN We will say the armor bearer is polishing it. RAPUNZEL Yes . . . cleansing it of the blood of your enemies. CURDKEN (Concealing a slight tremor at this possibility.) And I come to you . . . RAPUNZEL In solitude I walk, up and down my palace colonnades. (Magnificently she enacts the scene, pausing now and then to peer back at the train of cloth of gold.) The heralds announce your coming.   I hear the cheers of the multitudes in the streets: "Rapunzel, our queen"! CURDKEN (Enraptured with the picture.) The doors swing open.  The court assembles: the generals, the soothsayers, the ladies-in-waiting in velvets . . . RAPUNZEL But my velvets shall be richer . . . CURDKEN Then the court makes way.   I come to you . . . (He stands before her.   For a moment she forgets the play in the allure of his charm.) [611] Fee   Fo Fum RAPUNZEL You come to me . . . CURDKEN Then the great doors close. We are alone together, as we are now. RAPUNZEL (Dreamily.) My prince. CURDKEN I take you in my arms . . . RAPUNZEL (Quickly.) No. CURDKEN What shall I do then? RAPUNZEL You kneel ... So ... I give you my hand . . . Yes . . . You raise it to your lips. (Gurdken, a little awkward on his knees, laughs up at her.) CURDKEN Is this all? RAPUNZEL You say . . . CURDKEN I am to talk now? RAPUNZEL A prince must not forget his duty to his people. Our betrothal makes two kingdoms one. It brings wars to an end and starts a new era in our commonwealths. You must speak of government, of the problem of the poor, and of taxes ... [612] John   Chapin Mosher CURDKEN Taxes? RAPUNZEL (With dignity.) The new laws of trade, and what countries we shall make war on next. CURDKEN (Rising, but still keeping her hand, and speaking with much ceremony.) Princess Rapunzel, I have come from the far country where they hire the soldiers to ask your hand in marriage. If you do me such honor we will remove all taxes and end all wars; we will make goosegirls ladies of honor, and teach high ministers to stitch leather for your father the cobbler. Only when the proud lords and ladies of the court beg that we let them be cobblers and goosegirls and live in garrets will we refuse them sternly.  Such honors are not for them. RAPUNZEL (Drawing him up to her.) Curdken,  I   thought  you  were  a  prince ... a real prince . . . that night you kissed me by the city gate. CURDKEN Sh . . . you must not say that.

[615] Young Japan By Seichi Naruse (Ed. Note: Mr. Naruse is the former editor of Shin-Sicho, "The New Tide of Ideas," a monthly magazine published in Tokio which, he tells us, corresponds in general purpose with The Seven Arts. He is the author of plays and stories expressive of the new spirit in Japan and has translated a number of the works of Romain Rolland into Japanese. Mr. Naruse is at present in America and this paper is his first work written in the English language.) WHEN a spiritual creed or tradition, which has ruled the soul of man for a certain length of time, comes to be questioned and threatens to dissolve, a period of transition more or less anarchic in its aspects inevitably comes about before the establishment of a new order. The awakening of the contemporary younger generation in Japan, of which I am going to give a short sketch in this essay, may serve as a remarkable example. It is natural that the more sudden and sweeping the change, the more terrible and intense will be the disorder. Prior to fifty years ago when their country was at last forcibly opened to the world, no science worthy of the name was known to the Japanese people. Their total possession was a small stock of experiential knowledge, objective, primitive and inadequate, accumulated and handed down through the generations. On their spiritual side the Japanese were even poorer. Buddhism and Confucianism were the prevailing religions; but they had gradually been Japanized in their transmission from India and China, and were almost totally different from the original forms.   The Japanese were too caught up in them- [616] Seichi Naruse selves to have gone out and discovered the realities of life and nature. Thus, it was not the theological aspect of Buddhism, not the consequence of a serious and ardent quest for the truth, which commended that religion to the Japanese. Rather they took that direction as the result of some temporal unhappiness or calamity which made the renunciation of pleasure and the retirement to a convent the natural reaction. People became Buddhists because they were disappointed in love or because they had lost a parent or because they had failed to rise in the world. They did not care for the high and unattainable ideal of Nirvana; religion was for them a simple means of escape from present suffering. Confucianism in Japan became formal and artificial. The criteria of good and evil were looked on as purely external and absolute. The nature of the individual mind was not considered. In other words, virtue and vice alike were founded on objective behavior. Loyalty and filial piety were in all cases looked on as the loftiest things in the world, even as their contraries were in all cases looked on as vicious. It was a primitive morality little concerned with subjective motive or personal character. And the literary productions of Japan, although valuable in their own way, were for the most part the expressions of this attitude. Of course there was much writing that did not deal with religion or morality. But this sort also did not seek beyond the actual world. It was the surface expression of calm and contented minds. Even fantastic and romantic works, which are very rare in Japanese literature, were unmistakably matter-of-fact. The prevailing note of all Japanese life was a contentment with the superficial aspects of reality. It would be wrong to give the name of realism to such an attitude; for it was nothing like a conscious creed. It was a simple tendency of mind. The Japanese had not even taken positive steps to justify their state or to compare it with pos- [617] Young Japan sible alternatives. This may seem strange to you. B.ut the explanation lies in the national isolation which had been maintained for so many centuries and which had prevented spiritual contact with any of the civilized nations of the world. The Japanese lacked a measure to put their thoughts to the test and to stimulate deeper thinking. They were self-sufficient in their own culture. What confusion must necessarily follow the sudden opening of a country under such conditions ! Naturally Japanese civilization could not cope with that of Europe, which had been tempered to its present state after incessant test and exercise. There was a tremendous distance between the intellectual development of the Japanese and the Occidental mind. It was obvious that even if the younger men wished to keep their own traditions, they would need some standpoint that was less dogmatic and less hostile to their new demands. But the power of foreign civilization was too great for such a compromise. The conflict with their fathers' creed was inevitable at the first contact of the two cultures, and at once some of the old real treasure of Japanese thought was swept away. Of course, the old modes of living had enclosed the people's souls for many centuries. However absurd they seemed in the new light, they were still powerful. And since absolute obedience to elders was of the very stuff of Japanese culture, the struggle rose to a quick intensity. Both new and old believed too blindly in their own point of view to go out and study that of the opposition. There was a deep gap between the two, over which neither side attempted to build the bridge of mutual understanding. The first state was one of extreme chaos. The two factions were content simply to abuse each other. It was the prelude to revolution. For the young people, Occidental culture was something like a star in heaven. They admired it without really knowing what it was.   And their rejection of past [618] Seichi Naruse authority was like the insubordination of self-willed children, emotional yet not entirely without reason. But it was not long before the stage of chaos was lived through; and the first period of conscious reformation followed. With the importation of concrete examples of western culture came an advance in mental understanding. The classic authors of Europe were translated; and books on spiritual subjects entirely new to Japan began to appear. The inevitable change took place in the spiritual tendency of the young men. For a sound appreciation of things one must have a definite axis of one's own, an established individuality on the basis of which the new knowledge may be related up. This of course was lacking in the Japanese. The young men took to reading everything without preference or judgment. The result was a confusion of mind caused by the blind appreciation of many great works which, although very impressive, were apt to be contrary in teaching and in nature. Still no conclusions seemed achievable. The chaos became more intense, more terrible because a new enemy had appeared in the Japanese soul—a bitter scepticism. As they became aware of the unfathomable depth and remoteness of the Truth they sought, a profound oppression stole over the Japanese like that of a traveler lost in the desert who after a weary walk finds at the day's end that he has not reached the longed-for oasis. Doubt was their enemy from within; and from without, to heighten their misery, they had to suffer the tyranny Of the past which weighed all too heavily upon them. Desperate pessimism, which is the strongest note of young Japan, had invaded their souls. This pessimism, the first known to the Japanese people, broke out at last in the suicide of a young student of philosophy at the Tokio High School. A young man named Misao Fujimra jumped down from the high cliff of the Kegon waterfall after carving the following words on a tree-trunk [619] Young Japan at the edge of the precipice: "How mightily and steadily go Heaven and Earth! How infinite the duration of Past and Present! Try to measure this vastness with five feet? A word explains the Truth of the whole Universe—unknowable. To cure my agony I have decided to die. Now, as I stand on the crest of this rock no uneasiness is left in me. For the first time I know that extreme pessimism and extreme optimism are one." These words, written in 1903, found their way into many young hearts, even as the act of the suicide brought to the surface many smouldering emotions. To the older generation this suicide was not a call but rather a sudden peal of thunder. To kill oneself because of a philosophical dilemma or a view of life was beyond the reach of their imagination. The episode was taken up by the conservatives. Grave fears were expressed for the spiritual welfare of the younger men. It was pointed out that western culture was poisonous and that there was need of returning to the ancient soul of Japan. But the outcry was too feeble to turn back the powerful trend of the times. The suicide was only too symbolic of the spiritual state of the Japanese youth. The heavy flood of European culture was too overwhelming. It laid bare the vacancy of the old way of living and at the same time supplied no concrete ground for the building of the future. The ignorant goodwill of the older generation only made matters worse. Young Japan had learned too many things, had become too intellectual to seek the solaces of the ancient order. Meanwhile, suicides increased. Death was exalted. The Kegon waterfall where Misao Fujimra killed himself became a popular sanctuary and the name grew to be a slogan for spiritual revolt. At last, however, the light of faith began to dawn. One writer declared that there were but three ways open to the Japanese:—madness, suicide and faith. The [620] Seichi Naruse laisser-aller of traditional Japan was rigidly condemned. But more and more, madness and suicide were passed by and faith was looked on as the goal. From this situation emerged the two main currents of contemporary Japan. The first is aspiration for religion and philosophy; the second is an extreme dilettantism and decadence. The hunger for philosophy and an adequate religion was sincere and serious, although of course rudimentary. The youth of Japan sought a key to release them from their agony, a fulcrum to support them. But they were too ardent to care for purely scientific philosophy, which seemed to them, to use their own term, as a play of logic. What they really aspired for was not the system itself, but metaphysical emotion. Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Pascal, Leopardi, the Bible, the Buddhist gospel, and the Koran were read with passionate love. It was in this epoch that all the great names of Russian literature were introduced. The somber, heavy touch of these masters was entirely in harmony with the tendency of young Japan. On the other hand there were those who quickly tired of the quest for authority and truth. These denied the cogency of religion and insisted on the impossibility of knowledge. They were the decadents and the a-moralists. The most remarkable trait of this group of writers was their devotion to the dark side of human nature—a side which had been entirely absent up to this time in Japanese literature. The fin de siècle culture of Europe found its way to Japan. Wilde and d'Annunzio, Baudelaire and other French writers of the sort were prevalent at this time. The old morality of Japan had been pragmatic. The one spiritual activity it had recognized was that which served the needs of sheer existence. Japanese religion, morality and literature were largely utilitarian. But now all this was changed.   These qualities ceased to be regarded as merely [621 ] Young Japan useful things. Their intrinsic value, their power of exalting man to a wider life came to be recognized. In the old times religion, morality and literature were subordinate to tradition; now they were regarded as guides by which tradition could be measured. Another remarkable change was the individualistic tendency. The old heteronomic conceptions were cast aside. Thinking became subjective; and its emotional impulse was heightened by the great mental suffering which clouded Japan. The young men seemed to find no energy for thinking of the past; nor for planning the foundations of the future. Doubtless, the tyrannical oppression of past authority was responsible for this. But this double side of the struggle in which the young men were engaged, destruction and construction, gives a vivid picture of the revolution. Finally several theaters were founded in which plays of the new tendency were to be produced. Ibsen, Hauptmann, Maeterlinck, Sudermann, and Shaw were among the favorites. Of course, these plays were directly subversive of the old authority of Japan, and it is quite natural to find the censor active. An interesting example is the episode that took place on the production of Sudermann's Heimat. The teaching of this play is of course opposed to the ideal of filial piety. It was suppressed and only permitted to go on, with Magda repentant of her revolt in the last act. The subsequent prohibition of the publication of many European and Japanese works intensified the struggle. So that today the young men are openly hostile to the government censorship. This is carried so far that many writers intentionally publish work which they are sure will be suppressed. For it is known that if an issue of a magazine is confiscated the demand for the following number will be very great. Unfortunately this same tone of distrust and complete isolation is found in the relations of the young men among themselves. [622] Seichi Naruse They are split up into various hostile groups and their polemic is often shafted against each other. It is the custom today for each little company of men to publish a magazine of its own. The majority of the Japanese cultural papers are on this order. And they seem to have overlooked the great kinship which ought to unite them. They struggle not only against their elders but equally against all the young men outside their group. This condition of revolutionary chaos may be called the second stage in the awakening of Japan. Its notable characteristic is the elevation of philosophy, religion and literature to something higher than utilitarian aims; to the recognition of them as valuable in themselves. This moralistic tendency has a deep resemblance to the movement in France of "art for art's sake." It may have been a necessary stage, but obviously it could not stand for long. A new spiritual basis—the realization of the need of spirit in actual life—was not slow to come. We find a remarkable example of this development in the new appreciation of Tolstoi, who was previously regarded simply as a great writer. Now his admirers, who are increasing more and more, have begun to transfer his doctrines into real life. The eccentric and absolutist literary tendency is slowly passing away. Similarly, in religion, transcendentalism has come to be justified only in so far as it is deeply rooted in reality. The individualistic and philosophic tendencies remain; but now the young men of Japan are exerting themselves to carry their ideals over into action. And this effort has made the struggle still more tragic. They were already at grips with all the emotional and ideal tenets of Japan; now they are at grips with daily life. The revolution has reached the stage of practice. Evasion of military service is becoming more and more prevalent; opposition to family life is becoming more and more bitter. [623] Young Japan The serious younger men are bewildered with their quandary: whether to be true to their convictions or to the affection of their parents, whether to devote themselves to truth or to love. The literary productions of the day are steeped with this dilemma. The new ideal and the old morality which requires them to sacrifice even their ideal out of loyalty are in constant struggle. Out of this conflict have been born the socialist and feminist movements of Japan. The sudden appearance of a group of extremely violent socialists in 1910 threw the nation into a panic. An attempt was made to do away with the great Figure whom all the people had always worshipped as a demi-god— the Figure for whom the language provided a special pronoun. How the undertaking was received may easily be imagined. It was called Dai-Gyaku—great treason. With no discussion, all the socialists were put to death. Their execution, however, did not end the life of socialism in Japan. It is impossible to deny its ever increasing power over the younger generation. The young men are becoming more and more democratic and cosmopolitan. An interesting result of this may be seen in the social position of the nobles, once looked upon with envy and now regarded with contempt. The feminist movement, another remarkable phenomenon of the reformation, aims at the individual freedom of women who, in the old regime, were confined strictly to home life. The Bible of this revolt is Ibsen's Doll's House. What distinguishes it from similar movements in Europe and America is the stress on women's free growth as personalities and human beings, rather than on their political and economic rights. This propaganda also has its magazines, but it must be said that the women have had a hard battle to fight, for they are pitted against society and against the time-worn custom which demanded blind obedience to men. Some of the women have taken extreme steps.  The marriage laws have [624] Seichi Naruse been disregarded and the idea of chastity scoffed at. Although their progress has not been great, the mere birth of an idea of this kind marks an amazing change in Japan. This is the present transitional stage. Its keynote is the passionate effort to place the new ideals in complete harmony with life. It is difficult to foretell the end. The reactionary and conservative tyranny is gradually dying down. The younger men are being left more to their own faith. But it is safe to say that any new authority which would become strong enough to prevail in the future must, as its necessary condition, regain a deep intimacy with Japanese and Oriental culture. This must be the basis of any permanent assimilation of European thought. For, after all, the Japanese are the Japanese. It is impossible to change the color of their hair and skin; it will remain impossible to change the constant fundamental quality of their souls. A great leader must appear to bring about this marriage of Occidental and Oriental cultures. Indeed the tendency has already made itself felt. Indian, Chinese and Japanese learning is regaining its hold and the comparative study of these cultures with those of the West is being taken up. The latest germination of humanism among the young men of Japan is in this direction. The strong note of pessimism still prevails among them; but at least the new feeling for internationalism no longer assumes the exclusion of their native culture. It may, then, be said that the first step of preparation has been achieved; that the real awakening of Japan, a renaissance in the true sense of the word, is at hand. Of course, the way is still long, but, if my opinion is right, and I am not too patriotic in saying so, the future rôle of Japan in the spiritual life of the world will be great indeed. For it is the Japanese who are in the most favorable position to understand [625] Young Japan the two great currents of world-civilization—that of the West and that of the East; it is they who must harmonize these currents into one great life. I have the firm belief that this vision will come to them before long. And it is my great wish to live to see it. [626] THE   SEVEN ARTS Editor James Oppenheim Associate Editors Waldo Frank        Van Wyck Brooks Advisory Board Kahlil Gibran Robert Frost Louis Untermeyer   Robert Edmond Jones Edna Kenton David Mannes JEFFERSON'S dream—that of peopling a continent with Americans—has become a reality. The epoch of expansion, whose beginning he magnified with a vision, has come to an end. A group of practical business colonies suddenly discovered through him that they were here for the purpose of making a nation unlike all others—a nation of free, equal people, unkinged, untraditioned, refuge of all slaves and serfs, a level prairie of humanity. All that was needed to keep this illusion alive was immense new territory, a boundary line ever beyond, and untapped resources. But now "Westward Ho!" is over, and Jefferson's vision, which was a vision for a migrating race, a nation on the march, a nation in [627] The   Seven Arts schooner-wagons, trails behind us like a dying smoke. We are left, temporarily, without a future. UNDOUBTEDLY Jefferson was our first national poet, and the Declaration of Independence was our first national poem. There was needed some fire to fuse the Colonies in a nation; to take a lot of separate states with nothing in common except speech and trade, and no rich tradition, no past, and make of them a land, a united country. It was an integration impossible along merely physical lines. Jefferson came then with his grandiose rhetoric, and presented America with a future. Lord Charnwood speaks of this in his "Abraham Lincoln" : "The patriotism of an older country derives its glory and its pride from influences deep rooted in the past, creating a tradition of public and private action which needs no definite formula. The man who did more than any other to supply this lack in a new country, by imbuing its national consciousness—even its national cant—with high aspiration, did—it may well be—more than any strong administrator or constructive statesman to create a Union which should thereafter be worth preserving." AFTER Jefferson came two other poets to reaffirm, if not to bear witness to his prophecies. Lincoln's highest expressions brought to the Jeffersonian phrases a reality that they lacked before : for Lincoln was engaged in the task of saving a country dedicated to the proposition that all men are created free and equal, and in this victory, and in the freeing of the slaves, and in the very fact that he was born poor and low and now was President, he seemed to live out the strange doctrine of freedom and equality. The same epoch produced Walt Whitman, who caught the national destiny up in the [628] The Seven Arts evolutionary process of the race, and who logically developed the Jeffersonian free individualism into the celebration of the divine average, the powerful uneducated person, and the untrammeled ego. The picture of the American scene as Whitman presents it would be chaos itself if it were not for the fact that he gives this chaos a center and a main-drive. The main-drive was the abstract principle of democracy: the center was the individual. He preached that the United States (if not the universe) revolved about any American like a wheel round its axis. JEFFERSON, like Lincoln and Whitman, then, are our national poets of the first order. They held in common one body of social theory, one American vision, and at their best they were all prophetic. So long as the physical condition out of which they sprang was maintained, just so long did their faith and fire keep America fused. The loose flow of individuals, the equality of possessions, the practically equal opportunity for all, the set of values in use—values dealing mainly with personal rights—really did make each man the center of the national life, and in his own expansion his country expanded, and he could feel that he was helping forward a grand scheme for creating a super-nation. NOW that is over: and that America, the old America, exists no longer. We have gone through a hiatus, a terrible pause of disillusion and aimlessness. In this juncture the last of the Jefïersonians has become President. He began bravely enough with the old reiterations, and we have seen how swiftly he has had to abandon one position after the other. Not only has he awakened to the internal change, but the international situation has compelled, to use Nietzsche's phrase, "a transvaluation of all values". Almost [629] The   Seven Arts simultaneously we realize that America is becoming not so unlike every other nation and also that we are no longer isolated, but merely a fragment of a world, a state in a greater federation. We are merely another part of the civilization of Europe, and the role of Messiah-nation is ours no longer. WE stand at the faint beginnings, the trembling dawn, of our second great epoch. There is no doubt of that. And throughout our country there is a great desire, an overwhelming need. It is well that we may revive in ourselves the memories of Lincoln and of Jefferson, and call up again the tale of the pioneers. All this is well. It gives us a sense of common rootage. But more is needed. What poet and prophet shall clarify for us and project a vision which shall lead us on to a new nationality? It remains to be seen at this time whether Woodrow Wilson has the stuff of prophecy in him. His January speech to the Senate on the League for Peace flung out a thin outline of promise ; and the test of great events, which is even now progressing, may send into such an outline a genuine fire of inspiration. But the time has come.   A new poet must appear among us. J. O. [630] The Puritan's Will to Power By Randolph S. Bourne TO THE modern young person who tries to live well there is no type so devastating and harassing as the puritan. We cannot get away from him. In his sight we always live. We finish with justifying our new paganism against him, but we never quite lose consciousness of his presence. Even Theodore Dreiser, who always revolted from the puritan clutch, finds it necessary now and then to tilt a lance against him. If there were no puritans we should have to invent them. And if the pagan Mr. Dreiser has to keep on through life fighting puritans, how much more intrigued must we be who are only reformed puritans, and feel old dangers stirring at every aggressive gesture of righteousness? For the puritan is the most stable and persistent of types. It is scarcely a question of a puritanical age and a pagan age. It is only a question of more puritans or less puritans. Even the most emancipated generation will find that it has only broken its puritanism up into compartments, and balances sexual freedom —or better perhaps a pious belief in sexual freedom—with a cult of efficiency and personal integrity which is far more coercive than the most sumptuary of laws. Young people who have given up all thought of "being good" anxiously celebrate a cult of "making good." And a superstition like eugenics threatens to terrorize the new intelligentsia. Every new generation, in fact, contrives to find some new way of being puritanical. Every new generation finds some new way of sacrifice.   Every new triumphant assertion of life [631] The   Puritan's   Will   to Power is counterbalanced by some new denial. In Europe this most proud and lusty young generation goes to its million-headed slaughter, and in America the social consciousness arises to bewilder and deflect the essor towards life. Just when convention seemed to be on the run, and youth seemed to be facing a sane and candid attitude towards sex, we find idealistic girls and men coming out of the colleges to tell us of our social responsibility towards the race. This means not only that our daily living is to be dampened by the haunting thought of misery that we cannot personally prevent, but that our thirst towards love-experience is to be discouraged and turned aside into a concern for racial perfection. That is, we are subtly persuaded against merely growing widely and loving intensely. We become vague and mystified means toward nebulous and unreal ends. This new puritanism will not let us be ends in ourselves, or let personality be the chief value in life. It will almost let us sometimes. But it always pulls us up somewhere. There is always a devil of inhibition to interpose before our clean and naive grasping of life. (You see, my puritanism takes the form of a suspicion that there may be a personal devil lurking in the universe.) This is why the puritan always needs to be thoroughly explained and exposed. We must keep him before our eyes, recognize him as the real enemy, no matter in what ideal disguise he lurks. We must learn how he works, and what peculiar satisfactions he gets from his activity. For he must get satisfaction or he would not be so prevalent. I accept the dogma that to explain anybody we have to do little more than discover just what contentment people are getting from what they do, or from what they are permitting to have happen to them, or even from what they are flinging their will into trying to prevent have happen to them. For, if life is anything positive, it is the sense of control. In the puritan, of course, we have the paradox how he can get satisfaction from rug- [632] Randolph   S. Bourne gedly and sternly subjecting himself and renouncing the world, the flesh and the devil. There is a popular superstition that the puritan has an extra endowment of moral force, that he reverses the natural current of life, that he resists the drag of carnality down toward hell, that his energy is thrown contra-satisfaction, that his control is a real straddling of the nefarious way. But, of course, it is just this superstition that gives the puritan his terrific prestige. In the light of the will-to-power dogma, however, this superstition fades. The puritan becomes just as much of a naturalistic phenomenon as the most carnal sinner. Instincts and impulses, in the puritan, are not miraculously cancelled, but have their full play. The primitive currents of life are not blocked and turned back on their sources, but turned into powerful and usually devastating channels. The puritan is just as much of a "natural" man as you or I. But we still have to explain how this lustful, headstrong creature called man, spilling with greed, could so unabatedly throughout the ages give up the primitive satisfactions of sex and food and drink and gregariousness and act the ascetic and the glumly censorious. How could an animal whose business was to feel powerful get power from being in subjection and deprivation? Well, the puritan gets his sense of power from a very cunningly organized satisfaction of two of his strongest impulses,—the self-conscious personal impulses of being regarded and being neglected. The puritan is no thwarted and depleted person. On the contrary, he is rather a complete person, getting almost the maximum of satisfaction out of these two apparently contradictory sentiments,—the self-regarding and self-abasing. The pure autocrat would feed himself wholly on the first, the pure slave would be only a human embodiment of the second. But the pure puritan manages to make the most powerful amalgam of both. What we may call the puritan process starts with the satis- [633] The Puritan's Will to Power faction of the impulse for self-abasement, (an impulse as primitive as any, for in the long struggle for survival, it was often just as necessary for life to cower as it was to fight.) It is only the puritan's prestige that has attached moral value to self-sacrifice, for there is nothing intrinsic in it that makes it any more praiseworthy than lust. But its pragmatic value is immense. When the puritan announces himself as the least worthy of men, he not only predisposes in his favor the naturally slavish people around him, but he neutralizes the aggressive and self-regarding who would otherwise be moved to suppress him. He renounces, he puts on meekness, he sternly regiments himself, he makes himself unhappy in ways that are just not quite severe enough to excite pity and yet run no risk of arousing any envy. If the puritan does all this unconsciously, the effect is yet the same as if he were deliberately plotting. To give his impulses of self-abasement full play, he must, of course, exercise a certain degree of control. This control, however, gives him little of that sense of power that makes for happiness. Puritan moralists have always tried to make us believe in this virtue of self-control. They forget to point out, however, that it does not become a virtue until it has become idealized. Control over self gives us little sense of control. It is the dreariest of all satisfactions of the will-to-power. Not until we become proud of our self-control do we get satisfaction. The puritan only begins to reap his satisfaction when the self-regarding impulse comes into play. Having given his self-abasing impulse free rein, he is now in a position to exploit his self-regard. He has made himself right with the weak and slavish. He has fortified himself with their alliance. He now satisfies his self-regard by becoming proud of his humility and enjoining it on others. If it were self-control alone that made the Puritan, he would not be as powerful as he is. Indeed he would be no more than the mild ascetic, who is all abnegation because his self-regard- [634] Randolph S. Bourne ing mechanism is weak. But in the puritan, both impulses are strong. It is control over others that yields him his satisfactions of power. He may stamp out his sex-desire, but his impulse to shatter ideas that he does not like will flourish wild and wanton. To the true puritan the beauty of unselfishness lies in his being able to enforce it on others. He loves virtue not so much for its own sake as for its being an instrument of his terrorism. The true puritan is at once the most unselfish and the most self-righteous of men. There is nothing he will not do for you, give up for you, suffer for you. But at the same time there is no cranny of your world that he will not illuminate with the virtue of this doing of his. His real satisfaction comes not from his action of benevolence but from the moral of the tale. He need not boast about his renunciation or his altruism. But in any true puritan atmosphere, that pride will be prevalent. Indeed, it is the oxygen of that atmosphere. Wherever you come across that combination of selfless devotion with self-righteousness, you have the essence of the puritan. Should you come across the one without the other you would find not the puritan but the saint. The puritan then gets the satisfaction of his will-to-power through the turning of his self-abasement into purposes of self-regard. Renunciation is the raw material for his positive sense of power. The puritan gets his satisfaction exactly where the most carnal of natural men gets his, out of the stimulation of his pride. And in a world where renunciation has to happen to us whether we want it or not, the puritan is in the most impressive strategic position. In economy of energy he has it all over the head that is bloody but unbowed. For the puritan is so efficient morally that he can bow his head and yet extract control both out of the bowing and out of the prestige which his bowing gives him, as well as out of the bowing which he can enforce on others.  The true puri- [635] The Puritan's Will to Power tan must become an evangelist. It is not enough to renounce the stimulus to satisfaction which is technically known as a "temptation." The renouncing must be made into an ideal, the ideal must be codified, promulgated, and, in the last analysis, enforced. In the compelling of others to abstain, you have the final glut of puritanical power. For in getting other people to renounce a thing, you thereby get renewed justification for your own renouncing. And so the puritan may go on inexhaustibly rolling up his satisfactions, one impulse reinforcing the other. The simultaneous play of these two apparently inconsistent personal impulses makes the puritan type one of the stablest in society. While the rest of us are longing for power, the puritan is enjoying his. And because the puritan is so well integrated, he almost always rules. The person whose satisfactions of control are more various and more refined is on the defensive against him. The puritan gets his sense of power not in the harmless way of the artist or the philosopher or the lover or the scientist, but in a crude assault on that most vulnerable part of other people's souls, their moral sense. He is far more dangerous to those he converts than to those he intimidates. For he first scares them into abandoning the rich and sensuous and expressive impulses in life, and then teaches them to be proud of having done so. We all have the potentiality of the puritan within us. I remember suffering agonies at the age of ten because my aunt used to bring me candy that had been wickedly purchased on the Sabbath day. I forget whether I ate it or not, but that fact is irrelevant. What counted was the guilt with which the whole universe seemed to be stained. I need no other evidence for the irrational nature of morality than this fact that children can be such dogged little puritans, can be at the age of ten so sternly and intuitively righteous. The puritan is a case of arrested development. Most of us do grow beyond him and find subtler ways of satisfying our [636] Randolph   S. Bourne desire for power. And we do it because we never can quite take that step from self-abasement to self-regard. We never can quite become proud of our humility. Renunciation remains an actual going without, sacrifice a real thwarting. If we value an experience and deliberately surrender it, we are too naive to pretend that there are compensations. There is a loss. We are left with a vacuum. There is only depression and loss of control. Our self-regard is not quite elemental enough to get stimulation from wielding virtue over others. I never feel so degraded as when I have renounced. I had rather beat my head rhythmically and endlessly against an unyielding wall. For the pagan often breaks miraculously through the wall. But the puritan at his best can only strut outside. Most of us, therefore, after we have had our puritan fling, sown our puritan wild oats as it were, grow up into devout and progressing pagans, cultivating the warmth of the sun, the deliciousness of love-experience, the high moods of art. The puritans remain around us, a danger and a threat. But they have value to us in keeping, us acutely self-conscious of our faith. They whet our ardor. Perhaps no one can be really a good appreciating pagan who has not once been a bad puritan. [637] A Prophet in France By Waldo Frank THE War has done away with the swarms of literary schools that in time of peace make a battlefield of Paris. With the War, the source of most of them died out. They sprang from the intellectual surfeit, the emotional groping and indirection, all the cultural ease that a fertile race produces as by-products of its future. They went like flowers in flame. And when the War is over, new swarms of them will rise—their number limited alone by the ingenuity of their leaders to find names for them. But there were exceptions to the general death. As the combative genius of France shook down to its widest levels, some of the groups that had been lost with their fellows appeared to be looming up. It became evident that they were not, like the others, mere cerebral mists, incidental births of excess energy. They, and the social movements below the War, rested on the same foundations. So that, when the War bared these seismic structures, their impulse came into the light. Among these exceptions, two movements stand out. The men banded together by the Nouvelle Revue Française are perhaps the greatest in accomplishment. The varied works of the late Charles Péguy, of André Gide and Paul Claudel— to mention only three—are a superb expression of the present experience of France. But another group, although far poorer in achievement, is perhaps more closely quickened with the future. Unanimisme is still a sketched, rather than an elaborated art.   But perhaps this is to be expected of a move- [638] Waldo Frank ment wilfully nourished by an ideal tendency.* The founder of this school is Jules Romains. In 1908, when he was a recent graduate in philosophy at Paris, he brought out the volume of verse that established it and named it: La vie unanime.t Since then he has written novels, poems, plays and a manifesto which met the French passion for classifying art. But it is apt that the first book of this essentially prose writer should have been a poem; for 1914 left him still at the threshold of his work; and despite the vista of its promise, its accomplishment is still no more than a sharp lyric note. The striking feature of the art of Jules Romains is that his characters are not individuals, but collective groups : complex and dynamic units created out of the stress and passion of society. He pictures the soul, not of the occupants of a room, but of the room itself; not of a soldier but of a regiment; not of travellers but of their railway-carriage; not of rebels but of the riot. He is concerned with the new creatures of the new age: with the group-individuals molded by economic forces and endowed with sense and nerves, direction and temper like the more simple organisms that compose them. The most compelling revolution in an art, when it has won its place, appears as the logical next step. If we regard human endeavor since the Renaissance as a single march, the effort of Jules Romains is simply a most recent outpost. Individualism was the swing away from the anonymous group-culture whose soul still stands expressed in the Gothic cathedral and the Gregorian chant. Since this revolt, Europe has sought to right its balance.   Individualism has had the constant *The recent productions of Verhaeren and of several of the unanimistes have appeared under the imprint of the Nouvelle Revue Française, suggesting an essential  rapprochement of the groups. f An English translation is soon to be issued by the Yale University Press. [639] A   Prophet   in France impulse to broaden out and to include the group. But there has been a deep reluctance against this need. It is almost as if a racial memory existed of how the older group-cultures had been achieved: a profound resolve that a community of such undifferentiated mass, made at such individual sacrifice, must not re-appear. The ideal group toward which individualism tended was to be one composed of highly conscious, self-active parts. With it, all of the individual— nourished through the last centuries—would have to fuse: and during the process all of the individual must be kept alive. This dual activity has often blinded us to the deeper unifying movement. On the one hand, was the passionate cult of the individual; on the other, such gross impersonal programs as those of the old socialists who seemed to be merely paraphrasing the Roman Church. It has been hard to see these two developments as factors in a single birth : one in which the newly organized individual would create the transfigured group. Man and men were working toward an amalgam. But the process was still being carried out in separate chambers. It was as if the two component parts needed intensive tempering and perfection before they could be brought together. The laboratory of the Group was, broadly, that of science and economics: the laboratory of the Individual was left to art. But now, we find each movement eyeing the workshop of the other: studying more and more the profound purpose that underlies the two. In the experiential field of literature, however, there was no aesthetic based on a consciousness of the new Group, before Jules Romains. But we can trace the antecedents of his art without leaving France—almost without leaving the modern novel which, in my judgment, the vision of Jules Romains will revolutionize. The eighteenth century built up a mass-architecture of the intellect; and romanticism was a revolt from it.  The standard [640] Waldo Frank was in Rousseau; the enemy was in Voltaire. Benjamin Constant and Chateaubriand were individualists to the extent that the heroes of their novels appear to float about in a sort of ether. And yet, no sooner did the romantic novel take to itself substance and reality than the tendency swung back to a group and social consciousness. The very program of Balzac's Comédie humaine makes this clear: his absorption in the scientific studies of men like Buffon, Bonnet, Saint-Hilaire and Lamarck. He looked on the human order as an exalted and complex zoology. We feel behind his gigantic individuals the brilliant and brutal stirrings of real group movements: the palpable inter-action of the modern guilds and the economic castes. In Stendhal, the movement is gaining consciousness. Julien Sorel, hero of "Le Rouge et le Noir" and Fabrice of "La Chartreuse de Parme" are in reality mere individual grains ground slow but exceeding small in the mills of the new social structures. The picture of the Battle of Waterloo in this latter book—and of Fabrice as a mere molecule within it —is a direct harbinger of the technique of Jules Romains. With Zola we have progressed still further. What is true today—and immortal—in his twenty-volume history of Les Rougon-Macquart is not the decadent family and the false naturalistic method, but the tide-like human floods that move beside his Seine, the rich, sluggish peasant streams that he makes flow in the valleys of Beauce. Still, these mass-creations were largely unconscious. The preponderance was personalistic, although it was a preponderance that dwindled. In Constant's "Adolphe" the group is nonexistent; in Balzac the group is mastered by the individual; in Flaubert and Goncourt, the individual goes down before the group—but unconvinced; and in the later novel, we find the individual saving himself by a complete withdrawal. The group is either passive, a thing to be transcended; or it is de- [641] A Prophet in France structive, a thing to be avoided. With Jules Romains, it becomes, for the first time, the Hero. But we are still at small beginnings. A thousand spectators of a play have become one theater; a thousand neighbors have become one street; ten thousand toilers are a town. Jules Romains has blocked out his Paris, almost his France, in these moving masses, small and large—and each complex with its own varied impulse. But he has not organized his masses, not endowed them with their complete social functions, not fitted them one into the other. He has merely inaugurated a technique—or rather, he has sprung a source of vision that for a long march of time may lead the way. II. How Jules Romains came to this consummation may be felt in the development of his older contemporary, Maurice Barrés. M. Barrés began with that type of individualism that conserved itself by withdrawing from reality. His first three novels are grouped under the title, Le culte du Moi. Thence, his egoism spread forth until at last it had become the nationalism of his later group of novels, Le roman de l'énergie nationale. Consciousness had wreathed out from Maurice Barrés himself, to Lorraine, and thence to France. The evolution was simply from a unicellular to a multicellular state. We find the same adumbration in the one book of Jules Romains that exists in English. "The Death of a Nobody"* is perhaps the most perfect and the least advanced of his novels. The author had not got too far afield in it, with his experimental method. The hero of the book is still an individual. But the tendency is clear in his choice of a person so insignificant that his life apart from the group counts for nothing. The narrative is the gradual infiltration of this individual into *Published by B. W. Huebsch, New York. [642] Waldo Frank the anonymous life of France. Jacques Godard is dead on page 17; and with this barrier of his body once removed, the process begins. We follow the concierge big with the news of his lodger's death, dripping his secret into the life of Paris. As the funeral procession moves through the serried streets, all who observe it are enlarged by it. Godard becomes a portion of life. And his peasant father, striking through the packed communities of France to attend the funeral, gives of his news and of his son to each absorbent group that blocks out his way. France is a unanimous land indeed: the logical birthplace of this aesthetic. Even its dissensions bear the marks (and bitterness) of family quarrels. We feel the luminous complexity of France in this novel: we understand how the dead Jacques Godard shreds and drifts and is absorbed into the emotions of a people. And in this picture of the creativity of experience, we understand as well why the creed of Berg-son should have sprung from the same nation. "La mort de quelqu'un" is a novel of departure. As the dead hero filters through the infinite conduits of existence and so disappears, it is as if Jules Romains were bidding farewell to the narration of such mere fragments of life. Henceforth he will deal with wider units. But he is not quite successful. In "Les copains," the group-characters are heightened, the individuals are dimmer and more caught up in larger rhythms. But organization is lacking. All that is really alive is the lusty, fallow background: the long breathing of landscapes, the plethoric closeness of cafés, the avid discomfort and fertility of crowds. It is not until his later volume, "Sur les quais de la Villette," that Jules Romains abandons altogether the conventional and individual plot-narrative of the older novel. And it is interesting to note that, having abandoned it, he has not yet gone [643] A   Prophet   in France so far as to create its successor. The volume is not a novel at all. It is a series of recitals of which the heroes are dynamic and conflicting group-individuals. The manifest personalities of the book merely tell the story. These sketches are at once so diverse and of such parabolic line that I almost suspect M. Romains of preparing by means of them for the organized magnum opus that his method calls for. We feel the will and the ponderous yet subtle conflict behind the general mobilization which checkmated the general strike of May, 1906. We understand how the remote death of the great anarchist Ferrer seeped through the life and fired the movements of Bordeaux. The cumulations of individual resentment and resistance that flowered in the murder of an Apache in a Paris street are laid before us. Everywhere the language of Jules Romains is complex and tortuously woven, like the life it creates. To take a phrase or a page from his pattern would be like lifting a street from his Paris or a tree from his poplar-chorded highways. In the ingredients of his style one feels the soul of his group-life; yet the weave of subtle substances, for all its plurality, remains compact and one. Of course, his stuff is the common one of novelists who have, before him, written of barracks and theaters, valleys and streets, riots and peaceful evenings. But in Jules Romains, these quantities are knit into new being: one might almost say, into primal being. It is the difference between anatomy and life. Prior to Jules Romains, these organized bodies had form, perhaps, and feature. But they lacked the substance that makes them get up and move. A greater consciousness causes these groups, forged from the new impulse of society, to catch fire, to become impregnate with it, and to give it forth. This same intensity of consciousness we find applied, in Dostoïevski and Andreyev, to the individual.   But here, for [644] Waldo Frank the first time, the social units are quickened and made luminous. And in this difference of application, is revealed a difference between France and Russia. In France, the social organisms are energized to the extent where they can be shown to give forth heat—where they can live. In Russia or in America, this is not the case. But if Jules Romains is typical of the advanced culture of his particular land, he is none the less prophetic of the goal of other countries. It is a way of French art to express the present of its people, and the future of its neighbors. III. This, in brief, is the aesthetic and the promise of Jules Romains. How true it is, its sensitive cohesion with the accent of life today makes clear. And science and economics leave no doubt of the reality which his art is beginning to express. We are indeed a chaotic maze of new-sprung social lives. And the tendency everywhere is for the individual consciousness to arch forth into more embracing fields. But from the more complex staves there must grow a harmony; and from the larger groups there must rise up a music. We feel it stirring in Jules Romains. But not in him alone. Strictly comparable with his art—in its interplay of collective, energized social groups and in its technique of presentation— are the developments of modern painting, and of modern music. It is impossible here to quote from his prose, since the units there are too extended; but the following examples from "La vie unanime" mark the new use in verse of dissonance whose analogy in music has of late been so much noticed and abused. It will be seen how even the prosody of Jules Romains bears out his preoccupation with the discords and cumulations of our social life: [645] A Prophet in France Je suis une gerbe de chair veule, Les rhythmes crépitent, le temps brûle ; Pas un geste, pas une parole, Rien qu'un tremblement de lèvres pâles. Servir de bonde à toute la ville Et ne pas éclater jusqu'au ciel! These end-words bear the same relation to rhyme that a diminished ninth does to the octave. Here is another variation (note the rhyme on the penultimate and the stressing of the overtone, as in modern music) . . . Le moteur vit d'explosions obéissantes; Les atomes de gaz se battent en chantant; Leurs groupent meurent et naissent.   Le métal tremble. Chaque dent des engrenages est un tremplin D'où la force prend son élan, les jambes jointes; In fact, the entire use of collective groups suggests the substitution in modern music of the chord as absolute unit in place of the single note and the linear theme: or the new organizations of mass and rhythm in modern painting. There is a meaning in these analogies. Our democracy is incomplete: machinery is our tyrant: our new-born social beings are jarring, half-isolated, hostile. Life today is full of new hot colors and new sharp discords—and the fire of impact. Jules Romains is helping to create a direct art to express it. But he has not forgotten the older, perhaps sweeter harmonies that remain. His art—unlike that of so many moderns—is not ashamed of an occasional simple interval. Even as the bases of our life are still traditional and personal, so the mold of his art is still a formal one. Therein lies not the least reason for its strength. [646] Waldo Frank IV. But the real significance of Jules Romains is not in his technique and not in his ideal : it is in the fact that he is forging the one to express the other. The widening consciousness is, of course, not singly his. Doubtless the achieved art that must spring from it will reach far beyond him. But his place in the discovery is assured. His direct spiritual master is Romain Rolland. "Jean Christophe" contains the soul of his effort, without developing the form. In a like way, the thoughts of Jean-Jacques Rousseau formed the matrix of the later Romantic Movement, despite his classical manner. These planetary figures rather move the current of the arts than belong within it. M. Romains has not published since the War. But perhaps we can find a clue to his development in a long poem which he has recently written and which is shortly to appear. It is called "L'Europe." And its very subject, coming from a soldier-Frenchman, seems to indicate a broadening of sympathy and vision. The recent work of another poet, Pierre-Jean Jouve, who is closely allied with Jules Romains, bears this out. M. Jouve has openly espoused the unpopular cause of Romain Rolland, whose quasi-exile he shares in Switzerland. It has been impossible for him to suffer for France to the exclusion of suffering as well with Germany. He has become an internationalist—a protestant against the War. For my part, I cannot help seeing in this trend, however inadequate its present state, a token of what the new consciousness in art heralds for the new consciousness of life. The passion of endeavor is for more consciousness—and always more. The mind and soul of man are painfully, inevitably spreading forth to become the mind and soul of men. As the unity of life comes to be revealed in its larger aspects and its greater movements, relationships that rest on the [647] A Prophet in France new vision must surely follow. The true knowledge of what underlies physical conflict must be the harbinger of its disappearance. For all life is a unit in which all parts must seek their place. In this dawn of mankind, we are still groping for ourselves, we are still groping for our place. We are unorganized and without comfort. And we are bruised, like creatures feeling in the dark. Even, we lack confidence that the place we seek is really there. For only such kindred sharers of life who fail to know themselves can strive to destroy each other. [648 ] Cross-Roads of Screen and Stage By Kenneth Macgowan THE new-born "Theater Arts Magazine," which concerns itself more with open air theaters and pageantry than with the drama, closes its introductory blast with the words: "P. S. We intend not to be swallowed by the movies." In that one sentence there is evidence of the editor's frank appreciation of a very real danger, a danger that may even prove inescapable. This, to be sure, is a bad time for theorizing about stage or screen. The ancient art of the drama, and the modern art of the photoplay, seem to be in an almost identical state of confusion. The drama has settled down into the staid naturalism that dominates our playhouses; the "art of the theater"—the new art of stagecraft and the development of imaginative plays for its exercise—has crept out through "little theaters" and gigantic pageant-masques to threaten the stage with a new dominion and to usurp most of the theater's first-rate energies. The movies, meanwhile, beginning as the romantic melodrama of today, have developed into epic costume spectacles, and now suddenly display the most alarming aptitude for expressing propaganda and character. Is it inconceivable then that the movies may be swallowing the new art of the theater already, that the new art may itself voluntarily choose the screen, rather than the stage, for its future dominion? The last half of the nineteenth century crystalized the drama into two forms, critical and romantic. The first decade of the twentieth expressed the difference between these [649] Cross-Roads of Screen and Stage forms, through the art of stage setting, as realistic and imaginative. We seem now to be entering on a period of still sharper differentiation, in which the influence of the movies may play a determining part. The theater has been all things to all men and all times. In Greece it was religious, ritualistic, poetic. In France it became "classic," as well as poetic and conventional, till Molière lighted it with a new brilliance of his own. The basis of the English theater was at first religious and, remaining always vigorous, soon became romantic. For two hundred and fifty years it developed poetic artd literary tendencies in varying degrees, always with a tinge of the romantic. It was not till the latter years of the nineteenth century that it discovered and accepted those predominant intellectual, moral and naturalistic qualities which have expressed themselves in a wide variety of writers, from transitionalists like Dumas fils and Augier, and pioneers like Ibsen, to the broad array of our own time. Undeniably, if we are to assign to our drama any predominant category it is that of naturalistic criticism. It presents life as we live it, and it thinks about it, or causes us to think about it, as the dramatist has done. At its best it is either deliberately or consequentially a criticism of life, and thus at bottom a parochial art. Out of immediate familiarities the dramatist must draw his material. His moral deductions, or those we make for him, must apply to his own community, and are likely to be alien to others, unless they are so superficial, so platitudinous, as to be compatible with the general average of civilized life, or unless they grasp things in so fundamentally and deeply human a way that all the world must listen. On the surface there is one obvious reason why the movies will never conquer this fine field of the modern drama; unless they achieve a synchronization with the phonograph, which will make them only a mechanical and inferior imitation of [610] Kenneth Macgowan the stage, they will never capture the whole power of subtle characterization and direct discussion which inheres in spoken dialogue. There is a less obvious but more cogent reason in the necessary economic organization of the movies. The true theater to which America is slowly moving will be a local institution, bringing a native audience, native playwrights and a native producing staff into harmony. The movies are international by their very nature. They have few words to translate, and they can remain as amazingly cheap as they are only through a wide-spread, virtually international, production and distribution. Thus, so far as ethical criticism is concerned, the breadth and range of the audience catered to will bring it down to a dead average of platitude. The movies will tend to express, as Bernard Shaw has said, "what an agricultural laborer thinks right, and what an old-fashioned governess thinks properly sentimental." There is, however, that other side of the theater, the imaginative, the influence of which has been great abroad and has begun to make itself felt here. Since the naturalism of the nineties and earlier, many dramatists as thoroughly "modern" as Hauptmann have turned to the field of poetic, imaginative drama which once dominated the stage, and which has now given us such great names as Rostand, d'Annunzio, Maeterlinck, Hofmannsthal, Masefield. There has grown up a large audience for the imaginative drama, not in England or America, but on the Continent. This imaginative drama has had its morals and its psychology, but like the romantic drama of other days its main emphasis has been on beauty, and on action as much as speech. Its appeal has been increased by the development in Germany and Russia of the new stagecraft and indeed its whole tendency seems to be summed up in the work to which Gordon Craig, Adolph Appia, Stanislawsky and Reinhardt have devoted their supreme energies. [651] Cross-Roads of Screen and Stage Now it is at this point that the movies will cut into the theater's work. The poetry of the spoken word remains with the stage, but the poetry of action and the poetry of spectacle are adapted equally to the picture palace. In the latter they come out so powerfully that an arch-romanticist like d'Annunzio writes a "Cabiria." They come out so powerfully that it seems safe to prophesy a great cinematographic art which will absorb energies now going into the imaginative theater and bring forth a beauty that the stage can never rival. It is a question, of course, how deeply the imaginative art of the theater has taken root in American playhouses. There is certainly a great deal of talk about it: the publication of the "Theater Arts Magazine" is itself an instance of this; and the miraculous Dunsany and the peripatetic Portmanteau Theater have brought imagination even to Broadway. Urban and Jones mount "Follies" and farces, and receive occasional opportunities in the legitimate field, while "the message" is being spread broadcast in women's clubs and "little theaters." Yet all this is the expression of the smallest class in the country, a class of "intellectuals" and people of wealth. It does not touch the ordinary theatergoer, it does not touch the casual masses. Now it is different with the art tendencies of the screen. They draw the interest of everyone, because they always play an obvious and useful part, and what they do on the realistic level they do also on the imaginative. The intimacy of screen art, built upon "close ups" and a gathering together of scores of impressions, suggests to us that characterization may be developed to a perfection we little suspect. The words thrown on the screen, coupled with the living evidence subsequently introduced, make possible a propaganda with which the Smalleys have already accomplished much. Yet those same printed "leaders," as the Ince studios have proved, are just as powerful in preparing an imaginative mood and in reinforc- [652] Kenneth Macgowan ing atmosphere. The photoplay of the moving picture camera can compile a social document that is the very reflection of our life of today; yet this photoplay, by simple adjustments of lighting, can gild the scenes with picturesqueness and give them artistic proportions and the flavor of beauty. It is an inherent property of the screen that the popularity of a film is not diminished by the beauty with which its story is told. Just as on the regular stage, the setting and the lighting can create a powerfully effective atmosphere about a given incident. And the screen can utilize that beauty of reality which everyone recognizes and treasures, the beauty of nature and, in lesser degree, the beauty of architecture. Only the beauty of deliberate, artistic conventionalization "registers" on the stage. The means are restricted and, although the results of this limitation may be finer, they can only be appreciated by the smallest of educated groups. The screen, for that matter, gives the artist this limitation also, if he cares to use it. The theater, as we know it, limits the artist still further. For a three-act drama he has only three scenes to create as against the hundred possible scenes of a photoplay. Moreover, the setting that he creates to match the mood of a given scene can rarely hope to match the mood of a whole act. It is ideally suited only to a brief situation, a few bits of dialogue, and varying the light to create a new mood can be permitted only in a limited way if it is to conform with reality. There results from this the tendency of imaginative plays to break up into many scenes, more, in fact, than the physical limits of the stage justly permit, and to demand a playhouse quite unlike the theater of today. It is hardly necessary to dwell on the opportunities of the screen in these respects; its ability, for example, to change the setting with every change of emotion in the story. There is one fundamental point of agreement, however, between the imaginative "art of the theater" and the art of the screen that needs [653] Cross-Roads of Screen and Stage to be mentioned. Lighting is now generally recognized as the essence of the art that Appia and Craig first championed, and lighting is equally the essence of the photoplay. Its application to human figures and, in slightly lesser degree, to the atmosphere or setting in which they are placed, is the crucial problem for the imaginative stage. The best that can be achieved in this field in the rambling, many-angled milieu of the ordinary theater can be surpassed a hundredfold in precision and control upon the screen, while the variety of emotional episodes thus rendered in the photoplay can be woven into a harmony of artistic expression beyond the reach of the stage. [654] The Culture of Industrialism By Van Wyck Brooks IF we are dreaming of a "national culture" today it is because our inherited culture has so utterly failed to meet the exigencies of our life, to seize and fertilize its roots. It is amazing how that fabric of ideas and assumptions, of sentiments and memories and attitudes which made up the civilization of our fathers has melted away like snow uncovering the sordid facts of a society that seems to us now so near the lowest rung of the ladder of spiritual evolution. The older generation does not recognize its offspring in the crude chaotic manifestations of the present day, but I wonder if it ever considers this universal lapse from grace in the light of cause and effect? I wonder if it ever suspects that there must have been some inherent weakness in a culture that has so lost control of a really well-disposed younger generation, a culture which, after being dominant for so long, has left in its wake a society so little civilized? What is the secret of its decay? And how does it happen that we, whose minds are gradually opening to so many living influences of the past, can feel nothing but the chill of the grave as we look back over the spiritual history of our own race? It was the culture of an age of pioneering, the reflex of the spirit of material enterprise—that is the obvious fact; and with the gradual decay of the impulse of enterprise it has itself disintegrated like a mummy at the touch of sunlight. Why? Because it was never a living, active culture, releasing the creative energies of men. Its function was rather to divert these energies, to prevent the anarchical, sceptical, extrava- [655] The Culture of Industrialism gant, dynamic forces of the spirit from taking the wind out of the myth of "progress," that myth imposed by destiny upon the imagination of our forebears in order that a great uncharted continent might be subdued to the service of the race. For the creative impulses of men are always at war with their possessive impulses, and poetry, as we know, springs from brooding on just those aspects of experience that most retard the swift advance of the practical mind. The spirit of a living culture, which ever has within it some of the virus of Pascal's phrase: "Caesar was too old to go about conquering the world; he ought to have been more mature"—how could this ever have been permitted to grow up, even supposing that it might have been able to grow up, in a people confronted with forests and prairies and impelled by the necessities of the race to keep their hearts whole and their minds on their task? No, it was essential that everything in men should be repressed and denied that would have slackened their manual energy and made their ingenuity a thing of naught, that would have put questions into their minds, that would have made them static materially and dynamic spiritually, that would have led them to feel too much the disparity between the inherited civilization they had left behind and the environment in which they had placed themselves, that would have neutralized the allure of the exterior ambition which led them on. Puritanism was a complete philosophy for the pioneer and by making human nature contemptible and putting to shame the charms of life it unleashed the possessive instincts of men, disembarrassing those instincts by creating the belief that man's true life is altogether within him and that the imagination ought never to conflict with the law of the tribe. It was this that determined the character of our old culture, which cleared the decks for practical action by draining away all the irreconcilable elements of the American nature into a transcendental upper sphere. [656] Van Wyck Brooks European critics have never been able to understand why a "young nation," living a vigorous, primitive life, should not have expressed itself artistically in a cognate form; and because Whitman did so they accepted him as the representative poet of America. So he was ; but it is only now, long after the pioneer epoch has passed and the "free note" has begun to make itself heard, that he has come to seem a typical figure to his own countrypeople. In his own time Whitman was regarded with distrust and even hatred because, by releasing, or tending to release, the creative faculties of the American mind, by exacting a poetical cooperation from his readers, he broke the pioneer law of self-preservation. By awakening people to their environment, by turning democracy from a fact into a principle, his influence ran directly counter to the necessities of the age, and his fellow-writers justly shunned him for hitting in this way below the belt. In fact had Whitman continued to develop along the path he originally marked out for himself he might have seriously interfered with the logical process of the country's material evolution. But there was in Whitman himself a large share of the naive pioneer nature, which made it impossible for him to take experience very seriously or to develop beyond a certain point. As he grew older, the sensuality of his nature led him astray in a vast satisfaction with material facts, before which he purred like a cat by the warm fire. This accounts for the reconciliation which occurred in later years between Whitman and his literary contemporaries. They saw that he had become harmless; they accepted him as a man of talent; and making the most of his more conventional verse, they at last crowned him provisionally as the "good gray poet." For the orthodox writers of the old school had a serious duty to perform in speeding the pioneers on their way; and they performed it with an efficiency that won them the gratitude of all their contemporaries.   Longfellow with his lullabies, [657] The Culture of Industrialism crooning to sleep the insatiable creative appetites of the soul, Lowell, with his "weak-wing'd song" exalting "the deed"— how invaluable their literature was to the "tired pioneer," forerunner of the "tired business man" of the present day and only a loftier type because, like the tired soldier of the trenches, it was in response to the necessities of the race that he had dammed at their source the rejuvenating springs of the spirit! Yes, it was a great service those old writers rendered to the progress of this country's primitive development, for by unconsciously taking in charge, as it were, all the difficult elements of human nature and putting them under chloroform, they provided a free channel for the élan of their age. But in so doing they shelved our spiritual life, conventionalizing it in a sphere above the sphere of action. In consequence of this our orthodox literature has remained an exercise rather than an expression and has been totally unable either to release the creative impulses of the individual or to stimulate a reaction in the individual against his environment. Itself denied the principle of life or the power of giving life, it has made up for its failure to motivate the American scene and impregnate it with meaning by concentrating all its forces in the exterior field of aesthetic form. ( Gilding and idealizing everything it has touched and frequently attaining a high level of imaginative style, it has thrown veils over the barrenness and emptiness of our life, putting us in extremely good conceit with ourselves while actually doing nothing either to liberate our minds or to enlighten us às to the real nature of our civilization.} Hence we have the meticulous technique of our contemporary "high-class" magazines, a technique which, as we know, can be acquired as a trick, and which, artistic as it appears, is the concomitant of a complete spiritual conventionality and deceives no sensible person into supposing that our general cleverness is the index of a really civilized society. [658] Van   Wyck Brooks II. This total absence of any organic native culture has determined our response to the culture of the outer world. There are no vital relationships that are not reciprocal and only in the measure that we undergo a cognate experience ourselves can we share in the experience of others. To the Catholic, Dante, to the aristocrat, Nietzsche, to the democrat, Whitman, inevitably means more than any of them can mean to the scholar who merely receives them all through his intellect without the palpitant response of conviction and a sympathetic experience. Not that this "experience" has to be identical in the literal sense; no, the very essence of being cultivated is to have developed a capacity for sharing points of view other than our own. But there is all the difference between being actively and passively cultivated that there is between living actively or passively emotional lives. Only the creative mind can really apprehend the expressions of the creative mind. And it is because our field of action has been preempted by our possessive instincts, because in short we have no national fabric of spiritual experience, that we are so unable today to think and feel in international terms. Having ever considered it our prerogative to pluck the fruits of the spirit without undergoing the travail of generating them, having ever given to the tragi-comedy of the creative life a notional rather than a real assent, to quote Newman's famous phrase, we have been able to feed ourselves with the sugar-coating of all the bitter pills of the rest of mankind, accepting the achievements of their creative life as effects which presuppose in us no causal relationships. That is why we are so terribly at ease in the Zion of world culture. All this explains the ascendancy among our fathers of the Arnoldian doctrine about "knowing the best that has been thought and said in the world." For, wrapped up as they were in their material tasks, it enabled them to share vicari- [659] The Culture of Industrialism ously in the heritage of civilization, endowing them, as it were, with all the pearls of the oyster while neatly evading in their behalf the sad responsibility of the oyster itself. It upholstered their lives with everything that is best in history, with all mankind's most sumptuous effects quite sanitarily purged of their ugly and awkward organic relationships. It set side by side in the Elysian calm of their bookshelves all the warring works of the mighty ones of the past. It made the creative life synonymous in their minds with finished things, things that repeat their message over and over and "stay put". In short, it conventionalized for them the spiritual experience of humanity, pigeon-holing it, as it were, and leaving them fancy-free to live "for practical purposes." I remember that when as children we first read Carlyle and Ruskin we were extremely puzzled by their notes of exasperated indignation. "What are they so angry about?" we wondered, and we decided that England must be a very wicked country. Presently, however, even this idea passed out of our heads, and we came to the conclusion that anger and indignation must be simply normal properties of the literary mind (as they are, in a measure) and that we ought to be grateful for this because they produce so many engaging gro-tesqueries of style. Our own life was so obviously ship-shape and water-tight—was it possible that people in other countries could have allowed their life to become less so? Unable as we were to decide this point, we were quite willing to give the prophets the benefit of the doubt, as regards their own people. But it was inconceivable that for us they meant any more by their contorting rages than the prophets of the Bible meant, whose admirably intoned objurgations we drank in with perfect composure on Sundays. Consequently, those very European writers who might, under normal circumstances, have done the most to shake us out of our complacency have only served the more to confirm us [660] Van   Wyck Brooks in it. Our immediate sphere of action being sealed against them, their influence has been deflected into "mere literature," where it has not been actually inverted. For in so far as our spiritual appetites have been awake, it has only gone to convince us, not that we are unenlightened ourselves, but that other people are wicked. This incidentally explains the charge of hypocrisy that has been brought against the Anglo-Saxon mind in general ever since the industrial epoch began, a charge that has followed Puritanism as inevitably as trade has followed the flag; and it explains also the double paradox that while our reformers never consider it necessary to take themselves in hand before they set out to improve the world, our orthodox literary men, no matter what models they place before themselves, cannot rise above the tribal view of literature as either an amusement or a soporific. How natural, then, that the greatest, the most "difficult" European writers should have had, as Carlyle and Browning and Meredith had, their first vogue in America! How natural that we should have flocked about Ibsen, patronized Nietzsche, found something entertaining in every kind of revolutionist, and welcomed the strangest philosophies (the true quite as readily as the false) ! For having ourselves undergone no kindred creative experience for them to corroborate and extend, we have ever been able to escape their slings and arrows with a whole skin. They have said nothing real to us because there has been nothing in our own field of reality to make their messages real. III. As a result of this immemorial inhibition of our humane impulses, this deliberate obliviousness to the facts of life, personal and social alike, the younger generation find themselves in a very peculiar position. For having, unlike Europeans of any class, no fund of general experience in their blood, as it [661] The Culture of Industrialism were, to balance the various parts of their natures, they are incapable of coordinating themselves in a free world. So long as their creative and their possessive, their spiritual and their material, instincts frankly face in opposite directions they are able to make some sort of "go" of life, as their fathers did before them. But the whole spirit of our age tends to make this dualism more and more difficult. When, therefore, their instincts face about and confront one another and attempt to make some sort of compact, the material instinct inevitably comes out on top, because the material instinct alone is acquainted with the life of action. Their inherited and acquired culture drops away from them like a dream in the dawn and their consciousness immediately contracts into a field of reality that is restricted almost solely to the primary biological facts. This accounts for the brutality of so much of our contemporary realism; it accounts for the general poverty and chaos of our spiritual life. Not that we only have suffered in this way, but that we have suffered more completely in certain respects than other countries. The world over the industrial process has devitalized men and produced a poor quality of human nature. By virtue of this process the orthodox culture of the world fell, during the nineteenth century, into the hands of the prig and the aesthete, those two sick blossoms of the same sapless stalk, whose roots have been for so long unwatered by the convictions of the race. But in Europe the great traditional culture, the culture that has ever held up the flame of the human spirit, has never been gutted out. The industrialism that bowled us over, because for generations our powers of resistance had been undermined by Puritanism, was no sooner well under way in Europe than human nature began to get its back up; and a long line of great rebels reacted violently against its dessicating influences. Philologists like Nietzsche and Renan, digging among the roots of Greek and Semitic thought, [662] Van   Wyck Brooks artists like Morris and Rodin, rediscovering the beautiful and happy art of the Middle Ages, economists like Marx and Mill, revolting against the facts of their environment, kept alive the tradition of a great society and great ways of living and thus were able to assimilate for human uses the positive by-products of industrialism itself, science and democracy. They made it impossible for men to forget the degradation of society and the poverty of their lives and built a bridge between the greatness of the few in the past and the greatness of the many, perhaps, in the future. Thus the democracies of Europe are richer than ours in self-knowledge, possessing ideals grounded in their own field of reality and so providing them with a constant stimulus to rise above their dead selves, never doubting that experience itself is worth having lived for even if it leads to nothing else. And thus, however slowly they advance, they advance on firm ground. For us, individually and socially, nothing of this kind has been possible. It has been the very law of our life that our ways should be kept dark, that we should not be awakened to the hideousness of our civilization, that the principles in the light of which we are supposed to stand should remain abstract and impersonal. It seems to me wonderfully symbolic of our society that the only son of Lincoln should have become the president of the Pullman Company, that the son of the man who liberated the slaves politically should have done more than any other, as "The Nation" pointed out not long ago, to exploit them industrially. Our disbelief in experience, our habitual repression of the creative instinct with its consequent overstimulation of the possessive instinct, has made it impossible for us to take advantage of the treasures our own life has yielded. Democracy and science have happened to us abundantly, more abundantly than to others because they have had less inertia to encounter; but like children presented with shining gold pieces we have not known how to [663] The Culture of Industrialism use them. Either we have been unable to distinguish them from copper pennies, or else we have spent them in foolish ways that have made us ill. Our personal life has in no way contributed to the enriching of our environment; our environment, in turn, has given us personally no sense of the significance of life. IV. Thus we see today, emerging from his illusions, the American as he really is: obscure to himself and to others, a peasant, and yet not a peasant, an animal, but full of gentleness and humor, physically sane but neurotic from the denial of his impulses, a ragbag of inherited memories and unassimilated facts, a strange, awkward, unprecedented creature, snared by his environment, helplessly incapable of self-determination in a free world—in a word, "low-brow", and aware of it. As I visualize him, rather dimly, he has "made his pile" or has otherwise "fixed things" more or less so that he has time to come out into the open and look around a little. He is rather jocose about this because he is not used to it. Things in general puzzle him so much that he cannot work up very much interest in them. The wheels of his natural self are too rusty to generate any friction. Presently, therefore, reminded that he is wasting time, he turns back again to his old habits—only to find that they in turn no longer appeal to him as they formerly did. Things, in short, repel him now instead of engaging him; they have worked up a momentum of their own; they scarcely require his cooperation even. And so he has to turn about once more and face that blank within himself where a world of meanings ought to be. Now is it possible that all the poets and artists of history, whose function it has been to create and manifest these meanings, are unable to fill up this blank in his mind? Our industrial conception of culture assumes that they can do so, out of [ 664] Van Wyck Brooks hand, and that by a process of injection from the outside, by means of indiscriminate lecturing and the like, the fact that life is a miraculous and beautiful thing can be somehow pumped into the middle of his soul. But how does he himself feel about the matter? He knows that by this process only the upper levels of his brain are touched, and that they are touched only by minds in which the true fires of life have never been lighted. That is why we feel today that it is the real work of criticism in this country to begin low. For the American mind will never be able to recapture the wisdom of the world except by earning it, and it can only earn this wisdom through its own ascent upward on the basis of these primitive facts to which it has been gradually awakened. Between the apparently civilized vision of life of our best conventional story-writers and the really civilized vision of writers like Anatole France there yearns a gulf that is wide and deep, and we shall have to descend to the bottom of that gulf before we can begin the exhilarating climb to our own true heights. There are plenty of writers, of course, who imagine that they can get across from peak to peak by aeroplane, as it were, by dazzling flights of sophistication; but they do not achieve their aim and something within them tells them that they do not. They divine, as we all divine, that the only strictly organic literature of which at the moment this country is capable is a literature that is being produced by certain minds which seem, artistically speaking, scarcely to have emerged from the protozoa. That our life contains a thousand elements to which these writers just now fail to do justice is quite beside the point. Not that we are Hottentots, or even peasants, although our arrested development somewhat resembles that of peasants. No, we are simply at the beginning of our true national existence and we shall remain there, stock still, as we have already remained for a century and a half, until we have candidly [665] The Culture of Industrialism accepted our own lowest common denominator. But once we have done that, we shall begin to grow, and having begun to grow we shall grow quickly. For we already possess elements that belong to every level of development, even the highest—some even that are higher than the highest and put heaven to shame. They are all there, but they are not grouped in the right order; and so they have no cumulative effect. As soon as the foundations of our life have been reconstructed and made solid on the basis of our own experience, all these extraneous, ill-regulated forces will rally about their newly found center; they will fit in, each where it belongs, contributing to the essential architecture of our life. Then, and only then, shall we cease to be a blind, selfish, disorderly people; we shall become a luminous people, dwelling in the light and sharing our light. [ 666] The Seven Arts Chronicle for April The Literary History of Spanish America North and South America are like two suburban towns that cannot recognize each other's existence because neither one is fully aware of its own. Take the suburbs of New York or Boston or Chicago ; they are all made up of people who have left the metropolis for much the same reasons and who find themselves face to face with much the same problems. And yet because they have no autonomous social life they are able to communicate with one another only through the medium of the metropolis itself. So it is with our two American continents. We throw no light on each other, although we are both largely in the same boat. While in the vital foreground of our lives we are confused by the same growing-pains and are seeking ends that are harmonious through means that are similarly conditioned, our understandings converge only in the European background of our common ancestral memories. That is the way it is with brothers at the awkward age. "The Literary History of Spanish America" by Alfred Coester (Macmillan) shows us that in all this the South Americans have been less pro- vincial than we. Whether or not we have produced greater poets than they I do not know. But their poets, notably Ruben Dario, have absorbed Whitman quite as generally as our own have done; and long before Whitman or any other North American poet, save Emerson, perhaps, they became aware that American literature, to become vital, must take its departure from the developing experience of the indigenous national life. "If it wishes to gain influence," wrote the Argentine poet Echeverria as far back as 1837, "it must ... be the most elevated expression of our predominant ideas and of the sentiments and passions which spring from the shock of our social interests. Only thus, free from the bonds of all foreign influence, will our poetry come to be as sublime as the Andes ; strange, beautiful, and varied as the fertile earth which produces it." No doubt the literature that grew up under the influence of this idea resembled in many respects that of Bryant and Cooper and their North American contemporaries, spending much of its original force in celebrating scenery and exploiting local color while running to the abstract or the merely [667] The Seven  Arts Chronicle picturesque in its portrayal of character. What makes the manifesto so remarkable for us is its prevision of a literature sprung from "the shock of our social interests." Why did South America discover this so much earlier than we? Mr. Coester is too busy with his facts to generalize or to institute comparisons, but one reads a number of reasons between the lines. The colonial civilization of Spanish America was certainly more highly developed intellectually than ours ; it was much more in the literary tradition and it was constantly recruited by fresh elements of the same sort. Without Puritanism, it was also without our all-embracing will to material power. The economic regime never being based on the suffrages of an immense commercial class, literature was continually kept in flow by the constant exigencies of revolution. And then, too, since the aboriginal civilization had reached in certain areas a state of development far higher than that of our North American Indians there were native roots for the Spanish culture to graft itself upon. Thus for one reason or another quite early in the nineteenth century Spanish-American literature grew to man's estate. We who are just beginning to recognize that the cowboy has fallen from grace may be surprised to find that in Argentina novelists were applying the methods of Zola to the gaucho forty years ago; while the ideal passions that our literature has scarcely known save under the stress of the Civil War have been shared by numberless poets of Spanish America, persecuted for their opinions. Tyranny, no doubt, has greatly stimulated their sense of social values, but being an active tyranny rather than a settled despot- ism it has tended to keep them on the political level instead of turning them inward to the universe of the personal life. We who have passed through the seven plagues of industrialism may require a more nutritious food than they are able to give us. But their literature is certainly an older, a richer, and a hardier growth than ours. GROWTH AND DECAY IN RECENT FERSE Recent as the poetic blossoming in America has been, it already has had its withered offshoots. The sudden birth of a hundred diverse energies has been accompanied by deaths even more sudden if less spectacular. Four years ago a prize of five hundred dollars was won by Orrick Johns for his "Second Avenue," judged the best of ten thousand poems, one hundred of which were chosen for "The Lyric Year." When last heard of Mr. Johns was trying on motley with "Others," since deceased. Two years ago the name of Ezra Pound was the last word in radical literary circles; today his least agile disciples have surpassed him in his contortions and chinoiseries, or have turned to Amy Lowell as their imagistic leader. Even such hardy annuals as John Hall Wheelock, Theodosia Garrison, Zoe Akins, Charles Hanson Towne and others have suffered from something which has eaten into the vitality of their work. But this blight has affected even stronger and more imposing growths. It has ruined the native and personal qualities of so native and personal a poet as Edgar Lee Masters; it has stripped him until he seems bare of almost everything but ideas. [ 668 ] Growth and Decay in Recent Verse What this blight, this deadening evil may be, cannot be answered with anything more accurate than a generality; but it can be traced, rather easily, I believe, to a surfeit of literature. The new interest In all scientific and creative writing has provoked a mass of other writing which is neither creative, scientific nor provocative. Much of our recent poetry is due to the poet's desire to create, rather than to any urge of creation. Swept on by the flood of things literary, he drives (as Symons said of Wilde) his emotions, instead of letting his emotions drive him. So with Mr. Masters. What makes a great part of his recent poetry such unstimu-lating reading is that he himself seems to have read so much. In "The Great Valley" (Macmillan), for instance, one sometimes hears the voice of Mr. Masters, but it is scarcely recognizable among the confusing echoes of Browning, Darwin, and Tennyson. Going through this volume is like going through a curiously large and curiously assorted library—a library somewhat musty, haphazardly collected, unsystematized yet somehow professional—where the works of Dr. Sigmund Freud are found between a volume of John Cowper Powys and "The Life and Letters of Gobineau." Only too much pre-occupation with books could give that bookish and pseudo-scientific air that persists in his later work. It turns such a poem as "To a Spirochaeta" into a humorless parody of itself; it reduces "My Dog Ponto" to stodgy statement and philosophic platitudes; it makes "The Furies" a piece of mystical pomposity; it hardens the dry facts of "Autoc-thon" in even dryer language. It is not that Mr. Masters is too fond of his facts (as some of the critics of "Spoon River Anthology" have maintained), the trouble is that he is not fond enough of them. He does not care so much for the thing as for the thought it suggests—and that thought touches springs in Mr. Masters that are in their way as archaic and didactic as the despised Victorians and as mystico-moralizing as our almost forgotten New England group. One has only to turn to the new edition of "Spoon River Anthology" to witness this decline. The first version (without the epilogue, the addenda and afterthoughts) presented to its many readers a keen, dramatic, disillusioned picture of village-life and village small-talk. For the first time in American literature we were given a narrow, cynical, small-minded village as it appears, not so much to the author as to the villager himself. It was the apotheosis of the drug-store gossip, the cracker-box scandal, the sewing-circle activities. As such, it struck the reader as sharp, penetrative, often critical and sometimes profound. But its profundity was in the casual revelation of people and an environment, rather than in the obviously philosophic passages in which Mr. Masters entered in the rôle of conscious explainer. It was when he intruded himself as pundit and interpreter of the world's runes and riddles that he ceased to interest and became a rather dull monologist. Unfortunately this is the rôle to which Mr. Masters seems to be most partial. It explains the scholastic doggedness of "Songs and Satires" (relieved by a few things lïke "Silence," "The Cocked Hat" and "Arabel") and the vapid stretches in "The Great Valley." William Marion Reedy intending to praise his newest volume said "There is more power of thought [669] The   Seven   Arts Chronicle in it" . . . That is just its trouble. It is little else but thought. Mr. Masters has almost become a philosophic index, a resume of recent and current history, a dictionary of scientific jargon. He is too heavily thoughtful; he is seldom poet enough to be rapt—and even thoughtless. It is this latter quality that one finds with surprising beauty in Mr. Frost's "Mountain Interval" (Henry Holt and Co.). Some of the poems in this volume are so spontaneous and simple a record of the thing observed that they are almost the direct opposite of literature; they seem devoid of anything even so intellectual as words. It is the thing and its accompanying emotion that distinguishes such an apparently inconsequential poem as "A Patch of Old Snow," possibly the most tired poem in our language; and lifts "Birches" to a new and always indigenous eloquence. Along with this growth in Mr. Frost's work, one notes the flowering of other qualities, detected in his two earlier volumes but ripened and enriched here. The quality of humor, for instance, is not a new thing with Frost. The previous volume had many kinds of it: it seeped through "Mending Wall" in a delicate irony; it made "A Hundred Collars" take on the tone of a narrative that was about to break into a laugh; while "The Code" was little more than a huge, downright joke. But there was usually something grim and careworn about the smile in these ; only an occasional line gave the hint of sheer gaiety. It remained for "Mountain Interval" to reveal this humor, unperturbed and almost careless; it manifests itself in so beautiful an etching as "The Cow in Apple Time" or the silhouette of "An Encounter"; it sweeps "The Bonfire" to a sudden heroic close and plays delightfully through such a modern Elizabethan conceit as "The Telephone." Along with this widening of horizons, there has come a lyric freedom; the whole volume is saturated with a new mellowness and music. For pure, unpretentious poignance, it would be difficult to match "An Old Man's Winter Night," or surpass the homely beauty of such an almost deprecating tribute as "Hyla Brook." The strongest impression given by "Mountain Interval" is that, through a quiet-colored but rich colloquiality, Robert Frost has not only grown but is still growing. So with Amy Lowell. In "Men, Women and Ghosts" (Macmillan) she has attained eminences that none of her scornful critics would have admitted possible. Using alternately a vivid, almost a violent emotionalism, and the external, "unrelated" manner, she amazes by her display of virtuosity and her vigor. It is hard to believe that the same author could have constructed such a brocaded, old-gold, Dresden china affair as "Pickthorn Manor" with its strict rhyme-scheme, and so stark and modern a free-verse narrative as "Reaping" ; it is even harder to reconcile such cool pattern-making as "An Aquarium" with such heated and human partisanship as one finds in "The Hammers." But this versatility is Miss Lowell's most outstanding gift; she is constantly pushing towards new interests, fresh adventures. Most of the poets have caught this contagious zest for experiment; this fever for being in touch with and responding to the restless and fluctuant [670] The Creative Will spirit of the times. But we still have those who turn away from the age and its imperative demands and strain back to the softer (and safer) charms of antiquity. They seem to need a highly-colored, archaic and preferably mythological romance to make life tolerable, or, at least, interesting. One might excuse a modern poet for dallying in the lyrical gardens of Prosperine if he came out of them with a fresh vision or even a fresh variation. But even so sympathetic a poet as Stephen Phillips could seldom re-create and vitalize legends which have been so handled and rubbed that they have become as dull as most of their adapters. If occasionally one of them would infuse new blood in the veins of an old story (Herman Hagedorn recently accomplished it in "The Great Maze"), the reader would be aroused and held ; but instead of a thrilling dip into an energetic past, we are immersed in a flood of tepid rhetoric that has no more exhilaration than a bath in the midnight oil. "The Story of Eleusis" by Louis V. Ledoux (Macmillan) is a case in point. It is graceful, erudite, tuneful, picturesque. But the Demeter and Persephone of this version are not in any way living figures, or types, or even symbols; they are merely literary names that are placed above literary speeches that have no more life in them than a well-oiled metronome. The story suffers even as a story; for the strength has gone out of it. It has the diluted, sweetened quality of something told by someone, who heard it from Swinburne, who got it from Bullfinch who couldn't remember the rest of it. Fortunately these weak efforts to escape the world are growing less with every season.   It is the candor and courage of the best of our poets that has put themselves and their times to the test; it is carrying them through our current renascence and it will persist long after. It is the native solidity and strength that insures the growth of such poets as Robert Frost, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Amy Lowell, Arturo Giova-nitti, James Oppenheim, Carl Sandburg, Vachel Lindsay and one or two others. It is, in its great variety of expression, the sign of a healthy expansion; of something which is intensely casual and intensely spiritual. It is, in short, radiantly contradictory and altogether American. Louis Untermeyer. ' THE CREATIVE WILL "The Creative Will" (John Lane) by Willard Huntington Wright is a provocative, an interesting and an important work on aesthetics. It is provocative because it is aristocratic in its theory, it is interesting because Mr. Wright is an excellent manipulator of Nietzschean eloquence, and it is important because it actually contains additions to our knowledge of aesthetics. There is in it also a fine attitude, a scientific attitude, which might be called a reverence before the facts, a feeling that nothing is too holy, mystical or hidden for the careful analysis and study of the intellect. We must give up, says Mr. Wright, our foolish and loose talk about "inspiration" and "spiritual" work, and art must follow the body of man, the stars of the heavens, the human soul into the temple of the laboratory. So far, so good. It is more difficult to follow the aristocratic theory which Mr. Wright advances. One [671 ] The Seven Arts Chronicle sees here the discipline of Nietzsche, and indeed not only is Mr. Wright one of the real students of Nietzsche, but he actually arranges this book on the plan of "The Joyful Wisdom," breaking it up into numbered and titled paragraphs. His style too is reminiscent of his master. Hence, it is no surprise to find that he virtually would exclude the "many-too-many" from the enjoyment of great art, and predicts a future of such purity for painting, music and literature that only supermen may enjoy them, let alone create them. Exclude, he says, the illustrative from painting, the literary from music and the episodic from literature. Painting is then to become like music, with a scale of colors instead of a scale of notes. Sculpture drops out altogether, Rodin with it; and literature must be symphonic, etc. In short, Mr. Wright would have art-in-itself. It is somewhat vulgar to enjoy Mona Lisa with reference to her smile, Faust in relation to the Faust legend, and Hamlet in connection with our interest in problems of insanity. These are human, emotional reactions, which have nothing to do with pure form, that creation of a macrocosm by the artist which gives us a sense of the underlying (evidently impersonal) forces of life. And so in painting, especially, he believes that the discovery of the "color scale" will do for that art what the musical scale has done for music. The born musician, he believes, builds architecture out of notes: and so the painter must build design out of colors. Simplicity is necessarily abandoned, and a work of art is great in so far as it is a successfully complex organism, the larger the scale the greater. However, Mr. Wright's main contention is in favor of an art which shall exclude the mob. On the one hand, this is secured by complexity of structure, on the other by cleansing art of anything which might start "the associative processes." A painting of a face will call up some human emotion, and human emotion is the one thing that must be omitted. Art must be enjoyed through aesthetic emotion only, and aesthetic emotion, so far as I can gather, is something by itself, a rapt absorption in pure form, a feeling of being in the impersonal life-force and assimilating the patterns of existence. The trouble with all this is, that while Mr. Wright is scientific, he is not scientific enough. He quite ignores psychology, which shows how impossible it is to view anything, to react to anything, whether it be life, or mechanism, or art, in a really impersonal way. Even if we merely look at a composition of colors, each one of us will react differently. We carry nothing with us but our past, and we fit each new impression into ourselves by analogy to something we have known and felt. No, the complexity of art is not only in its structure, but in its appeal. Many besides Mr. Wright today shiver at Wagner's operas as impure, because music, which should be pure architecture of sound, here becomes the handmaiden of a story and a poem. Yet even Mr. Wright believes that in literature the story or character-development should be expressed in poetic prose for the purpose of sharpening, deepening the impression, and I, for one, fail to see why poignant musical notes cannot be used for this purpose as well as poignant words.   But of course [672] Mr. Griffes En Route if such things are done, where are we at? What standard have we? What chemical test whereby we can say, this is art, or this isn't? Is it not bewildering to see such variety, such mixtures, such emotional contradictions? It is bewildering. And so is a great city after one has been for a year in the mountains. But one may learn to live in a great city, and to adapt one's self to its confusion. In this way to be one of "the many-too-many" is to be beyond the superman who needs a world defined, delimited and pure. I am afraid that "The Creative Will" is youth, again, in search of an absolute, which, alas, he will be unable to find. We can apply absolutes to the machinery of life, we can always say that H20 is water, but life itself changes with our emotions, and unfortunately we cannot get outside ourselves to judge it. So art, so all things which stir us beyond the intellect, remain in that flux which is ourselves, and cannot be tabulated. J. O. Mr. Griffes En Route It is doubtful whether the Neighborhood Playhouse on Grand Street has mounted anything more interesting than "The Kairn of Koridwen," the little dance drama presented for the first time on February tenth. Not that the mimic elements of the production showed a salutary revolution on the part of the artistic direction. Quite the contrary. Never before had the resources of the Playhouse seemed so inadequate. The mise-en-scene, devised by the Misses Lew-isohn, seemed unusually monotonous and ineffective. The poses and gestures of the Neighborhood's Festival Dancers, led by Miss Blanche Talmud, betrayed none of the far-famed Talmudic subtlety. The want of a single dynamic controlling intelligence was again painfully evident throughout the entire production. And yet, it was gratifying to have assisted at a performance of "The Kairn of Koridwen." One could at least return home with the sense of having undergone an experience. That was made possible by the musical setting, the work of Mr. Charles T. Griffes. It alone lifted the little dance-drama from mediocrity into importance. For Mr. Griffes' score is something more than an able setting. It is a felicitous and often brilliant piece of work. In the light of the difficulties, inherent in the action he was asked to clothe, that beset him, it is an amazing one. It abounds in passages of rare loveliness. It is skillful and imaginative. There is no question of its incidentalness. For in this case, it was the miming that was incidental, the music that was the primary and important matter. Better than anything that occurred on the stage, it expressed the essential idea that underlay the drama. Mr. Griffes' score is significant for another reason. For in it, his talent for the first time has made a satisfactory manifestation. An idiom a little undecided, a little derivative, a personal expression a little hesitant, has become formed and individual and respectable. The music for "The Kairn of Koridwen" should bring Mr. Griffes reputation more surely than his piano music, more surely, indeed, than anything that he has hitherto composed.   Taken alone as a [673] The Seven Arts Chronicle tour de force, quite apart from its musical value, it is frankly astonishing. The resources of the little orchestra of piano, celesta, flute, clarinets, horns, and harp, placed at the composer's disposal, have been exploited with a deftness that calls to mind the feats of Strauss in "Ariadne auf Naxos." Mr. Griffes has drawn effects from his curious assemblage of instruments quite as the prestidigitator draws objects from a silk hat, and quite as amazingly. The unusual conjunction of timbres, split horn and piano, chromatic harp, chromatic flute and celesta, the happy superposition of conflicting tonalities, the knitting of strongly contrary rhythms that abound throughout the work, should make a musicians' holiday. Today, there can be no more question of Mr. Griffes' rare ability. The real beauty of the music, however, lies in the completeness with which it makes plastic the Misses Lewisohn's conception. The authors had drawn their stuff from a Celtic legend. And their drama, quite apart from any modern valuation of the story of the druidess who will not leave the shrine to which she is dedicated, and goes rather to death in the sanctuary than into the world with her lover, was, in intention, at least, of the coloration that we recognize as Celtic. The action itself was laid in the kairn sacred to Koridwen, the Gallic moon goddess. A good deal of the stage business represented the rites of the goddess in her shrine by the oceanside. There were dances signifying the circle of the universe and the three planes of existence, potions brewed in seething caldrons out of herbs and berries of the wood, visions and ecstasies, all in a pattern of oak-branches, torches, bronze alt- ars, mistletoe and, in the first scene at least, moonlight. It was just that druidic, sublunary coloring that Mr. Griffes captured in his music. Whatever Celtic glamor there was in the production mounted from it. From the initial measure of the short prelude, from the moment the clarinet uttered its half mournful, half glowing phrase, there expanded a music unified by a single quality, a quality that better than anything else evoked the druid rite there in the moonlight. It was the music that urged the imagination continuously, that expressed the ardors and the ecstasies of the celebrant druidesses, that laved the stage with actual moonfire. There were the gestures, the poses, the abandon that the authors of "The Kairn of Koridwen" had dreamed, more fully, more beautifully than their stage could realize them. Indeed, only once, in all that first scene, were the miming and the music in accord. That moment occurred after the first frenzy of the rite had passed. The druidesses were prostrate before the altar. From the muted piano and the celesta, shrouded by the other instruments, there emerged, tenderly, painfully, phrases that flowered out, piercingly sweet, in the stillness. And on the stage, in a sort of ecstasy, shadowy torso after torso raised itself toward the moon in an aspiration of every nerve, every tendon, and then sank back prostrate. It was the one compelling moment of the presentation, and as such, unforgettable. No doubt, Mr. Griffes' score is uneven. The music for the second scene, for instance, is not quite as eloquent as that of the first. Not even Carmelis' dance with the branches, nor the episode where she [674] Mr.   Griffes   en Route and Mordred, the intrusive Gallic warrior, lie on the promontory and gaze out over the sea, could make it so. But perhaps the chief weakness of Mr. Griffes' score lies in the comparative weightlessness of the dramatic moments. Besides the snap, the life of the descriptive passages, and the dance movements, they are a trifle insipid. The fault does not lie with Mr. Griffes but with his librettists. In some matters the Misses Lewi-sohn were very generous with their composer. They engaged Mr. Nikolai Sokoloff to rehearse and conduct the music, the Barrère Ensemble to perform it. In others, they were unduly withholding. For instance, they deprived the composer of all opportunity to do anything with the dramatic and passionate moments by eliding them as often as they could, and when they could not, by passing them over as quickly as possible. The ending of the first scene is a good example of the want of symmetry in the construction caused by this somewhat undue aversion to passionate love scenes, and other passionate scenes. Mordred had intruded into the kairn. Carmelis had been commanded to kill him, and had disobeyed. Like another in a like situation, she might have said "Er sah mir in die Augen. Das Schwert, ich Hess es fallen." The rest of the druidesses had rushed off, leaving her alone with him. At this point, the curtain chastely fell. One needs to be neither salacious nor Wagnerian to wish it had remained µ?. For a very beautiful scene might have been enacted and Mr. Griffes might have had an opportunity to write some directly dramatic music, and not have had to end the scene so abruptly. Nor was he vouchsafed greater opportunity for variety and action in the second scene. Here there was more drama, but an unfortunate conjunction of episodes of similar character forced a certain monotony on the music again. The finale was most ineffectual, though this time the fault was Mr. Griffes'. "Finding Carmelis dead" the libretto prescribed, "the Sène solemnly encircle her, repeating to themselves the austere law of their faith 'What is to be, will be.' " It is obvious that by the time he reached that part, Mr. Griffes was a trifle bored with the whole business. And so he wrote a little conventional death music, just reminiscent enough of the "Götterdämmerung" funeral music to give the audience its cue, and let the "austere law of their faith" go at that. Perhaps his very boredom at that point is further proof of his artistic sensibility. One would like to see him try his hand at a more grateful subject. If he could be kindled to such production by the rather meager action of "The Kairn of Koridwen," what could we not expect if he occupied himself with, say, "The Shadowy Waters" of Yeats, or some other dream-stuff of Celtic inspiration? But, whatever he undertakes, it is impossible any longer to entertain only slight expectations in regard to him. The music he wrote for the Neighborhood Playhouse precludes that. For it seems to offer positive assurance that Mr. Griffes is indeed en route for actual achievement. Paul Rosenfeld. [675] The   Seven   Arts Chronicle The German Theater in New York It is hard to be critical about the work one sees in the German theater on Irving Place. The lack of work one sees at most of the other theaters unfits one for it. It is easier to be merely eulogistic; or, if one turns away from it toward Broadway, to become a scold. For it would seem the natural thing, in American New York, for the native drama to have all the advantages. And if this is so, since it is the Germans who act best, direct best, produce the best results in the entire city, it might appear logical enough to give them a testimonial of congenital superiority and let it go at that. The truth, however, is just the other way: it is the Americans who have against them all the odds; it is the Germans who have with them all the advantages. Of course, I am talking of the theater and of those specific qualities and things that the theater needs. If an Arabian fantasy is produced on Broadway, you will be sure to find on the stage a true Arabian steed. You will be sure to find new scenery for even the oldest of ideas; real settings for the most wooden situation. On the stage of Irving Place, they would use a cab-horse ; and more than once I have found a "Lady of Lyons" drop furnishing the background of a Strindberg comedy. But all considerations of this kind seem to dwindle when one thinks of the essentials. One no longer pities the folk-theater on Irving Place. One is inclined to be indulgent toward our own leading managers. For instance, the Germans have, in their theater, two actual communities: one on either side of the footlights.   Their house is not reliant on anonymous and chaotic crowds that drift toward a particular box-office rather by virtue of their own indirection than the specific draw of a particular play. About Broadway buzz the fly-swarms; and the managers, if they would catch them, must employ fly-paper. At the Irving Place there is a conscious unit—a living organism whose interest is normally directed toward its theater and among whose natural demands are those precise cultural reagents that their theater can supply. The audience is in a real sense a community ; and a community of consumers. It is knit together racially and emotionally, so that its intellectual appetite is neither "high-brow" nor "low-brow" but fundamental. And its attitude of a permanent need makes it not only steadfast in its patronage but humble before the dramatic masters whose fare it is conscious of requiring. The shifting audiences of Broadway respond to the momentary titillation of a "show" which, in its turn, responds to the impulse of some special source. That source may be intellectual or foreign or vulgar or nugatory. It never completes the circle. The bourgeois Germans, on the other hand, who watch Sudermann or Tolstoi or Schiller at the Irving Place, find in these writers the same spirit, the same emotion — although formed and charted—that have made them want to go to the theater. They make up not merely a community, but a community at one with a community of playwrights. But they are also a community at one with a community of actors. The Irving Place Theater supports a permanent company of forty players [676] A   Painter   on Painting all of whom receive their salaries whether the play of the moment requires their services or no. The company is composed of artists drawn from practically all the leading theaters of Austria and Germany. It is, of course, a varying group. But its nucleus is constant and its spirit is strong. The newcomer is soon merged into the whole. It need scarcely be said that this group represents a power of traditional, cultural and intellectual experience which no Broadway theater with its quicksand castes, its shallow background and its impermanence, can hope to rival. These Germans belong to their theater. They are steeped in its religion of integrity; they know its literature as a monk knows his prayers. They also are a unit, crystallized by the demand of their audience for an expressive dramatic art. In this sense they also are compact, conscious and self-sufficient. Mr. Hans Bartsch, the sensitive, deeply civilized individual who serves as manager between these two communities, brought me a succinct picture of the spirit that enlivens them. It was found necessary, some months ago, to discharge the chorus that had served in a highly popular musical comedy. That seemed the end of the comedy—successful as it was. Only ten members of the company had parts in it. The remainder immediately volunteered to act as chorus. Among them were stars—all of them were artists who took important rôles in important plays. This little incident expresses a great truth. The theater is, of all arts, the most communal and the most traditional. Is it a miracle that the common productions at the Irving Place excel our most laborious and feted efforts? With all our external pomp and bustle, our lavishing of time and money, we cannot bring forth what these communities have within themselves. In the ordinary course of their business, the Irving Place Theater has produced this year Ibsen's Wild Duck, Strindberg's Comrades, Tolstoi's The Living Corpse and The Concert of Hermann Bahr. These are plays of diverse and difficult power. They have been produced with a subtlety of rendition, a perfection of delineation, a unity of grasp that are simply and unequivocally unheard-of on the American stage. Yet no one of these plays was rehearsed more than six times before the premiere! But, as was explained to me by the gentleman who acts as the manager between the two communities: "Long before, all of these artists knew all of the plays—and the authors' philosophy—by heart." Truly, we must be more kindly in our attitude toward the Broadway theaters. With their lack of real plays, their lack of real companies of actors, their lack of real audiences, it would be sheer unfairness to compare them with the Volkstheater on Irving Place. W. F. A Painter on Painting It is curious to pass from Glack-ens' modest show of small pictures to the many rooms where are ranged Zuloaga's tall masterpieces,—curious and instructive. For the one is poetry and the other is oratory. It is as though one stood outside a shut door listening to a musician playing a solo [677] The   Seven   Arts Chronicle on his violin all alone by himself, and then passed into some great cathedral crowded with devotees, pervaded with one thought as they listen to the preaching of a Bossuet. Zuloaga paints for the crowd and is at his best, and then only, when he feels with the crowd. In Bond Street, London, long ago, used to be the famous Doré Gallery. The pictures were changed from time to time and it lasted for years. We artists did not care for it; and the critics passed it by with hardly a comment. Yet, with a very limited technique and a kind of sentiment infinitely worse than commonplace, Doré also was an orator painter and occasionally a man of originality. He was ruined by English vulgarity. England, being non-conformist and commercially successful, loved comfort rather than truth, and so this poor man of genius but of weak will was forced to fill his pictures with religiosity and all the sham sentiment of the ultra pretty. Far better for the artist, and the artist which is in every man, to live in the most corrupt and criminal society than to be where vulgarity flourishes as it did at that time among the people to whom Doré offered his pictures. Zuloaga paints for Spain ; its people implicitly and explicitly believe what they profess, and are of such primitive sincerity that they deny none of the facts of life. For them pleasure is just pleasure, and passion passion, and the body the body, whether it be beautiful or ugly. They know nothing of English "decency" or decorum and do not desire to hide anything behind veils either of religiosity or prudery. There has always been something harsh and rude about the Spanish intellect; what we think is charming amiability they regard as mere humbug. The most socially refined and distinguished among Spanish ladies still go to bull-fights as some centuries ago they were present at an auto da fé. Had Doré painted for these people we should have had a very different Doré, but it is the curse of the orator temperament that whatever happens it must have an audience; with the audience it falls or rises. It used to be rumored about London that Doré was in the habit of going in disguise to his own gallery that he might mingle in the crowd and hear their comments, and this was instanced as a sign of his continental vanity. Doré did not go there for vanity but because of his social nature and that he might study his people and become one of them, so as to paint what they liked and what he would like since they liked it. The French are a social people and their poetry is oratorical poetry. It is their gift, and because of it they are the beloved nation. For they are our teachers. Goethe, as we know, was never tired of confessing how much he owed to them. To think of them is like remembering some happy school time when everybody was kind and the pupils docile. Is there any charm comparable to that of reading a French essay? The Spanish art of Zuloaga has qualities that make it very different from the art of France. All the art and poetry of France has been intended for artistic Paris and if it has admired force the force has been concealed under every kind of gracious-ness and subtlety. I can see in the landscapes of the Barbizon School a certain elegance as in the school of Watteau and a most real desire to charm.    The   French   artist   is a [678] A   Painter   on Painting French gentleman. In Spain the artist, as artist, is a peasant. Zuloaga has no regard for subtlety or grace ; he admires only force, and force he will have as naked as possible;—what do peasants care for subtlety or fine manners? So we find in Zuloaga that drama so delicately rendered in French painting exaggerated into the excesses of melodrama and black gloom. The somber and terrible imagination of the Spanish peasant has its trail over every picture, whether he paints a cardinal or a courtesan or a beautiful countess or a walled-in town. In these pictures there is something "creepy." At picture exhibitions there is generally much chattering; people forget the pictures and talk to each other. At the Zuloaga exhibition the crowd was silent and, as it seemed, kept together like frightened sheep. This would have pleased the painter. For it is the orator's passion to dominate crowds of people— everybody, if possible; and he loves personal glory. For that reason he must "show off" ; thus we have the Zuloaga technique. And splendid it is—but why splendid? Because of its self-display. Never for a moment are you allowed to forget that he is a master of drawing and that he does his work with ease and copious facility. And here is another thing to be pointed out. A lady, herself a distinguished artist, whispered to me, for if we spoke at all it was in whispers: "Is not the decorative quality wonderful?" All orators aim at an immediate effect,—it is the necessity of their calling; and so Zuloaga arranges the whole scheme with slight reference to truth of facts, but with the controlling purpose that every line and curve and all the masses and the whole arrangement of color shall lead the eye and the attention up to whatever is the central point in his picture. It is like a diagram in Euclid, everything arranged, nothing left to chance. There are no spontaneities. In Zuloaga's pictures the decoration is as obvious as in a theater. The painter poet is the opposite of all this. In Glackens' pictures the technique is out of sight. He is so busy trying to please himself that he has quite forgotten everybody else and so has no occasion for display, and he is such an incurable solitary that he makes no effort to be intelligible; he is as solitary and self-contained as an infant. I went to his show accompanied by two distinguished artists and at first we stood astonished rather than pleased. In my ignorant petulance I said: "Where he was good before he is now not so good, and where he was wrong before he is now worse." Then we separated and wandered about the room each by himself. Presently one of us called out, "How that sapphire sea heaves and undulates in its fullness and in its summer glow," and from that moment, all our imaginations alight, we understood and accepted everything. Because of its splendor and pomp and its festiveness the artist within me loves the summer of New York, notwithstanding its dreadful heat, shattering to mind and body, and its swarming mosquitos and other plagues of tired crowds, and Glackens paints it as a poet should,—that is, as he himself sees it and not as other people do. The orator, be he painter or poet, conies to us: the man who is purely poet is different, we go to him. The orator has fame and our applause, the poet has his own singular happiness, of which we try to get a [679] The   Seven   Arts Chronicle glimpse; and though the solitary be not unfriendly he has no explanation with which to help us; in his pictures will be no decorative scheme, and no logical arrangement. We are left to our unhelped bewilderment, as in the presence of nature itself, till some inner feeling is touched and we have the key and know all. Nor is the key transferable; everyone must find his own key. There is an unfailing test by which you can know the painter who is a poet from the one who is an orator. To the former color is itself an end, while the latter makes of it something that is quite subordinate and a means to an end. Glackens will paint a girl's head half hidden under a hat, and he will color that hat so that its color is more potent to your painter soul than a dozen sonnets, while the girl herself is quite forgotten. Indeed in the picture I am thinking of, she is hardly painted at all. The hat itself is mostly color and with so little verisimilitude that any milliner would despise it. Yet its being a genuine hat on the head of a real girl is essential, otherwise there is no magic and the picture a nullity. Glackens derives from Renoir. Therefore, as was natural, I went to see an exhibition in which were several Renoirs. Renoir like Glackens is a poet painter, only not so much so. I call concrete that which is apparent to my five senses. It is the province of the poet, whether he paints or writes, to make the concrete more and still more apparent. That is what I mean when I say Renoir and Glackens make poetical the summer sea and the boats floating on it and the people, and I think Glackens has done this more vividly than Renoir. If Renoir began this kind of painting Glackens seems to me to have carried it further. Yet in painting men and women Renoir seems to me to have the advantage. He has looked longer at Rubens. It is his luck in being a Frenchman. Compared to him Glackens' figures are thin and papery. It is a pleasure to go up close to a Renoir, to see with what a delicate solidity all the human forms are modelled. As regards this it is better to see a Glackens from a distance, and even then it is not satisfactory. There is a nude by Renoir modelled with a skill that would not have been possible to Glackens; but one asks, why did he paint it? It is a picture of a kitchen wench without her clothes, sulky and ashamed. Was it from a sense of pity for the poor thing thus stripped for anyone to look at her? Or did he want to shock the sensibilities of people he disliked? If the latter then it was no longer poetry but only oratory and a very poor kind of oratory, yet characteristic of a certain class of French painters, and a lapse from poetical sincerity. One does not like to see the crystal streams of divine poetry clouded over by the dull stains of anything less than itself. The poet painter imitates what he loves and thereby spreads his love, and there have been painters and poets who loved everything upon which can light the eye of man. And as to the meaning of this word, love, there need be no mystery; it is just affection as we know it between a husband and his wife, parent and child, a lad and a lass. It is the master spring of life and will grow anywhere that chance favors, though we know it best when with the vigor of a wild weed it rises familiarly beside the hearthstone. John Butler Yeats. [680] The editor of a popular magazine writes us: "I stopped reading the 'better class' magazines some years ago because I found them rather sad. When analyzed, their superiority consists only of the quality of the paper on which they are printed; consequently I retired to the 'popular' regions, where people at least know what a story is, though they may not worry themselves about its intellectuality. At times I have looked into the 'different' magazines only to find that they are the concoctions of epigrammatic children and intellectual incompetents—little groups of serious thinkers. "But at last we have a magazine—The Seven Arts! I feel in my bones that your secret motto is art for the people's sake, and not art for art's sake.

It is a work related intimately to  that struggle which we realize America is undergoing to-day and from which a new national life is emerging. The work falls into three parts: 1. SELF, one of the sharpest, most direct, and deepest revelations of a man's life, his real motives, desires, ambitions and hopes, which has yet appeared in literature. 2. THE SONG OF LIFE, the real history of Youth's encounter. 3. CREATION, the drama of all Life portrayed through the Life of Man. 12mo.
