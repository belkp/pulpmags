No5 Inferior ReligionsWyndham Lewis ITO introduce my puppetsand the Wild Bodythe generic puppet of allI must look back to a time when the antics and solemn gambols of these wild children filled me with triumphThe fascinating imbecility of the creaking men machinessome little restaurant or fishing boat worksis the subject of these studiesThe boat s tackle and dirty little shell keeps their limbs in a monotonous rhythm of activityA man gets drunk with his boat as he would with a merry go roundOnly it is the staideveryday drunkenness of the normal realWe can all see the ascendance acarrouselhas on mendriving them into a set narrow intoxicationThe wheel at Carisbrooke imposes a set of movements on the donkey inside itin drawing water from the wellthat it is easy to graspBut in the case of a fishing boat the variety is so greatthe scheme so complexthat it passes as open and untrammeled lifeThis subtle and wider mechanism mergesfor the spectatorin the general variety of NatureYet we have in most lives a spectacle as complete as a problem of EuclidMoranBestre and Brobdingnag are essays in a new human mathematicBut they are each simple shapeslittle monuments of logicI should like to compile a book of forty of these propositionsone deriving from and depending on the other Editor s noteThis essay was written as the introduction to a volume of short stories containingInn Keepers and BestreUnlucky for Pringleand some others which had appeared in The English Review under Ford Madox Hueffer s editorshipand in other English periodicalsThe book was in process of publicationthe author had even been paid an advance on itwhen war broke outThe last member of the publishing firm has been killed in Franceand the firm disbandedThe essay is complete in itself and need not stand as anintroduction It is perhaps the most important single document that Wyndham Lewis has writtenSuch stories as had not been previously published will appear in later numbers of The Little ReviewEP The Little Review 4 These intricately moving bobbins are all subject to a set of objects or one in particularBrobdingnag is fascinated by one objectfor instanceone at once another vitalityHe bangs up against it wildly at regular intervalsblackens itcontemplates itmoves round it and dreamsAll such fascination is religiousMoran s damp napkins are the altar cloths of his rough illusionJulie s bruises are the markings on an idolThese studies of rather primitive people are studies in a savage worship and attractionMoran rolls between his tables ten million times in a realistic rhythm that is as intense and superstitious as the figures of a war danceHe worships his souphis damp napkinsthe lump of flesh that rolls everywhere with him called Madam MoranAll religion has the mechanism of the celestial bodieshas a danceWhen we wish to renew our idolsor break up the rhythm of our naievtythe effort postulates a respect which is the summit of devoutnessII I would present these puppetsthenas carefully selected specimens of religious fanaticismWith their attendant objects or fetishes they live and have a regular food for vitalityThey are not creationsbut puppetsYou can be as exterior to themand live their life as littleas the showman grasping from beneath and working about a PolichinelleThey are only shadows of energyand not living beingsTheir mechanism is a logical structure and they are nothing but thatSam WellerJingleMalvolioBouvardand PÃ©cuchetthecommissairein Crime and Punishmentdo not livethey are congealed and frozen into logicand an exuberanthysterical truthThey transcend life and are complete cyphersbut they are monuments of dead imperfectionTheir only reference is to themselvesand their only significance their egoismThe great intuitive figures of creation live with the universal egoism of the PoetThey are not picturesque and over palpableThey are supple with this rare impersonalitynot stiff with a common egotismTherealistsof the FlaubertMaupassantand

Intuitionand Life charged with black IllusionThe Little Review 5 III When we saytypes of humanity we mean violent individualitiesand nothing stereotypedBut OthelloFalstaff and Pecksniff attractin our memorya vivid followingAll difference is energyand a category of humanity a relatively small groupand not the myriads suggested by a generalisationA comic type is a failure of a considerable energyan imitation and standardising of selfsuggesting the existence of a uniform humanitycreatingthat isa little host as like as ninepinsinstead of one synthetic and various EgoIt is the laziness of a successful personalityIt is often part of our own organism become a fetishSairey Gamp and Falstaff are minute and rich religionsThey are illusions hugged and lived inThey are like little dead TotemsJust as all Gods are a repose for humanitythe big religions an immense refuge and restso these little grotesque idols areOne reason for this is thatfor the spectator or participatorit is a world in a corner of the worldfull of rest and securityMoranevenadvances in life with his rows of bottles and napkinsJulie is Brobdingnag s Goddessand figures for intercessionsif the occasion arisesAll these are forms of static and traditional artthenThere is a great deal of divine Olympian sleep in English HumourThe most gigantic spasm of laughter is sculpturalisolated and essentially simpleIV 1

corruption thumps us like a racing engine in the body of a carThe finest humour is the great Play Shapes blown up or given off by the tragic corpse of Life underneath the world of the CameraThis

Burgundian gust of laughterbut that is not a personalityit is an apparition of no importanceIts awkwardnessor prettiness is accidentalBut so much correspondence it has with its original that if the cadaveric travail beneath is vigorous and bitterthe mask and figurehead will be of a more original and intense grotesquenessThe opposing armies in Flanders stick up dummy men on poles for their enemies to pot atin a spirit of fierce friendlinessIt is only a dummy of this sort that is engaged in the sphere of laughterBut the real men are in the trenches underneath all the timeand are there on

prototype of half the nationEeldrop and Appleplex THEliot II THE suburban evening was grey and yellow on Sundaythe gardens of the small houses to left and right were rank with ivy and tall grass and liliac bushesthe tropical South London verdure was dusty above and mouldy belowthe tepid air swarmed with fliesEeldropat the windowwelcomed the smoky smell of lilacthe gramaphonesthe choir of the Baptist chapeland the sight of three small girls playing cards on the steps of the police station On such a night as this said Eeldrop I often think of Scheherazadeand wonder what has become of her Appleplex rose without speaking and turned to the files which contained the documents for hisSurvey of Contemporary Society He removed the file marked London from between the files Barcelona and Boston where it had been misplacedand turned over the papers rapidly The lady you mention he rejoined at last whom I have listed not under Sbut as Edithalias Scheherazadehas left but few evidences in my possessionHere is an old laundry account which she left for you to paya cheque drawn by her and markedR Da letter from hermother in Honoluluon ruled paper a poem written on a restaurant billTo Atthisand a letter by herselfon Lady Equistep s best notepapercontaining some damaging but entertaining information about Lady EquistepThen there are my own few observations on two sheets of foolscapEdith murmured Eeldropwho had not been attending to this catalogue I wonder what has become of her Not pleasurebut fulness of life to burn ever with a hard gem like flame those were her wordsWhat curiosity and passion for experiencePerhaps that flame has burnt itself out by nowYou ought to inform yourself better said Appleplex severely Edith dines sometimes with Mrs Howexdenwho tells me that her passion for experience has taken her to a Russian pianist in Bays waterShe is also said to be present often at the Anarchist Tea Roomsand can usually be found in the evening at the Cafe de l OrangerieWell replied Eeldrop I confess that I prefer to wonder what has become of herI do not like to think of her futureScheherazade grown oldI see her grown very plumpfull bosomedwith blond hairliving in a small flat with a maidwalking in the Park with a Pekinesemotoring with a Jewish stock brokerWith a fierce appetite for food and drinkwhen all other appetite is goneall other appetite gone except the insatiable increasing appetite of vanityrolling on two wide legsrolling in motorcarsrolling toward a diabetic end in a seaside watering placeJust now you saw that bright flame burning itself out said Appleplex now you see it guttering thicklywhich proves that your vision was founded on imaginationnot on feelingAnd the passion for experience have you remained so impregnably Pre Raphaelite as to believe in thatWhat real personwith the genuine resources of instincthas ever believed in the passion for experienceThe passion for experience is a criticism of the sincerea creed only of the histrionicThe passionate person is passionate about this or thatperhaps about the least significant thingsbut not about experienceBut Mariusdes EsseintesEdith But consider said Eeldropattentive only to the facts of Edith s historyand perhaps missing the point of Appleplex s remarks her unusual careerThe daughter of a piano tuner in 18 The Little Review Honolulushe secured a scholarship at the University of Californiawhere she graduated with Honours in Social EthicsShe then married a celebrated billiard professional in San Franciscoafter an acquaintance of twelve hourslived with him for two daysjoined a musical comedy chorusand was divorced in NevadaShe turned up several years later in Paris and was known to all the Americans and English at the Cafe du Dome as Mrs ShortShe reappeared in London as Mrs Griffithspublished a small volume of verseand was accepted in several circles known to usAnd nowas I still insistshe has disappeared from society altogetherThe memory of Scheherazade said Appleplex is to me that of Bird s custard and prunes in a Bioomsbury boarding houseIt is not my intention to represent Edith as merely disreputableNeither is she a tragic figureI want to know why she missesI cannot altogether analyse herinto a combination of known elementsbut I fail to touch anything definately unanalysable Is Edithin spite of her romantic pastpursuing steadily some hidden purpose of her ownAre her migrations and eccentricities the sign of some unguessed consistencyI find in her a quantity of shrewd observationan excellent fund of criticismbut I cannot connect them into any peculiar visionHer sarcasm at the expense of her friends is delightfulbut I doubt whether it is more than an attempt to mould herself from outsideby the impact of hostilitiesto emphasise her isolationEveryone says of her How perfectly impenetrable I suspect that within there is only the confusion of a dusty garretI test people said Eeldrop by the way in which I imagine them as waking up in the morningI am not drawing upon memory when I imagine Edith waking to a room strewn with clothespaperscosmeticsletters and a few booksthe smell of Violettes de Parme and stale tobaccoThe sunlight beating in through broken blindsand broken blinds keeping out the sun until Edith can compel herself to attend to another dayYet the vision does not give me much painI think of her as an artist without the slightest artistic powerThe artistic temperament began Appleplex Nonot that Eeldrop snatched away the opportunity I mean that what holds the artist together is the work which he doesseparate him from his work and he either disintegrates or solidifiesThere is no interest in the artist apart from his workAnd there areas you saidthose people who provide material for The Little Review 19 the artistNow Edith s poemTo Atthisproves beyond the shadow of a doubt that she is not an artistOn the other hand I have often thought of heras I thought this eveningas presenting possibilities for poetic purposesBut the people who can be material for art must have in them something unconscioussomething which they do not fully realise or understandEdithin spite of what is called her impenetrable maskpresents herself too wellI cannot use hershe uses herself too fullyPartly for the same reason I thinkshe fails to be an artistshe does not live at all upon instinctThe artist is part of him a drifterat the mercy of impressionsand another part of him allows this to happen for the sake of making use of the unhappy creatureBut in Edith the division is merely the rationalthe cold and detached part of the artistitself dividedHer materialher experience that isis already a mental productalready digested by reasonHence EdithI only at this moment arrive at understandingis really the most orderly person in existenceand the most rationalNothing ever happens to hereverything that happens is her own doingAnd hence also continued Appleplexcatching up the thread Edith is the least detached of all personssince to be detached is to be detached from one s selfto stand by and criticise coldly one s own passions and vicissitudesBut in Edith the critic is coaching the combatantEdith is not unhappyShe is dissatisfiedperhapsBut again I sayshe is not tragicshe is too rationalAnd in her career there is no progressionno decline or degenerationHer condition is once and for alwaysThere is and will be no catastropheBut I am tiredI still wonder what Edith and Mrs Howexden have in commonThis invites the considerationyou may not perceive the connectionof Sets and Societya subject which we can pursue tomorrow night Appleplex looked a little embarrassed I am dining with Mrs Howexden he said But I will reflect upon the topic before I see you again The Little

there were seven Stars upon the sky that beamedAnd in the grass the cow bells tinkledAnd daisies dreamedAnd sweet smells streamed Over the tasselled cornCod lay dimmed in slumberAnd Jesuswarm hair was pillowed on His Father s breastSeven disciples like seven points of a star Were rayed about the sleeping MajestiesAnd Judas was brighter than the restBecause his spirit had a fiercer sin to burnHis ruddy hair was rimmed with dewAnd what he was to me he is to youThe Little Review 23 There was no sound But the lyric murmur of a Marysinging Low upon the groundWhere a brook ran upon a secret errand Like a silver hound Slipping beneath the unbound hair of treesMary was singing to the least of theseSome ChildrenAll listenedFor the breath of her caressed the silence With curves of melodyAnd hence the very corn awoke to hearAnd to inhale the healing psalmodySo because the grassthe daisiesstirred Pleasantlyand light wings whirred As birds arose from nestsAnd quests of dew and honey went uponThe Childrenone by onemoved aboutAnd some would run up the hillAnd back againanother seemed to poutBut changed and blew a glad shrill whistle out That pleased the sailing starsThen Mary ceased her songAnd silence fell like shadow on them allNow amongst the ones who slept Judas raised his headSleep never touched his eyes with cool forgetfulnessInstead his soul was fed with sin That never flickered out withinHe yawned and bent his kneesAnd the tongue of a silver bell The Little Review Shivered above the sleeping Majesties Within the ring of sevenBecause there were but six When Judas vaulted the fence rail Out of the fields of HeavenAnd now you could hear Jesus breatheAnd God murmur peace upon the wakeful corn God A spire of frail sound rose from a boyish will See GodHe s walking down the hillSeeMary And Mary looked up And saw Judas coming toward themThe sweet hand of a Child in the cup of either hand Shall I tell them the truthJudasThat you are far from God said she Or will you burn them with your sinYou who are no kin to such as theseAnd drive them back to meCrying bitterly A smile struggled with his twisted faceBut could not give it graceAnd the two Childrenwary Of the lurid tumult in his breastWrested their twined fingers from the gnarled hold of himAnd their eyes dim with tearsRan back to MaryJudasthe silent shadow of a manHis will as heavy as a fallen tree in a woodStood upon the hillThe Little Review 25 And watched the Children as they ranSaw them nestle into Mary s armsSeeking in the cloudy charms Of her loosened hairThe peace they knew was thereWords crowded in his throatAnd he sat upon the hillside With his face between his kneesNow when his face was hidden From the least of theseOnebidden by the helplessness Of the man on the side of the hillCame from the shelter of Mary s hairAnd minding not her warning touchNor her sounding of his nameKnowing he was not chidden muchWent winding an idle way Up the hilland around and away From the still bowed manAnd first he picked a flower Which he threw higher toward the fence railGod smiled in His sleepAnd Jesus opened His eyesPut forth a hand for the plucked flowerAnd hid it in His breastYet did not rise nor cease His restThe ChildKeeping a moody soft eye upon the grey humped figureBetrayed his mischief in a smile That waxed biggerbubble likeand broke into a laugh26 The Little Review And like a thief in the night Crept up the hill to the fence railAnd peekedThe fence rail creaked As Jesus turned His face to him Poor mandear boy he whispered silverly Until he learns to playTo dress his dusty head With ribbons of the rosy dayNever can he share Your early morning passionFlecked with foamy curls of hairWould you give him back again T o my bosomcleansed of painSpill your living ways of laughing In his muffled earsAt himand beset himSplash himlittle dearsIn your fun Jesus bade the boy Run And the Child winkedYesTurned about and ranPut his flying hands upon the shoulders of the manAnd while a star blinked At what he sawThe Child broke the law of sin As he leaped over Judas in the oldold gameRan screaming down to Mary s covering hairBut did not linger thereSped back and bounded over once againAnd others captured by the first one s joy Were startled into rapture And followedgirl and boyIn the glamour of the gameUntil the sunken man became The Little Review Bathed and spatteredShakenshattered and half hiddenIn the breaking foam of ChildrenThere came a pause When the Little Onesbreathing Hard about Judassaw him raise his headSaw a smile like theirswreathing His facewashed with sleepAs though he waked in his bed From the keep of angelsIn his eyes rememberance shone Of when he was a boy And looked upon the face of God everywhereOf when he was himself a toyA plaything of a God who dreamed Everywhere and everythingAnd when the Children saw Upon his face the broken law Of sin dissolve like shadows In a ruined woodWhen they saw the sun come up Within himfill his face as the cup Of the world is filledThey spilled their bubbling laughter on the airAnd cuddled to his knees As though hetoowere of the least of theseHis greedy arms inarticulately stuffed With bloomy charmsHis roughed voice sweet With honey of his joyhe began28 The Little ReviewNow when I was a boy I had as little as you to give me joyAnd made as much of itMade a world of many mansions Each great enough for God to dwell inYesmansions of my little joyEven as do youDo we asked one thoughtfullyAnd What is mansion said another And who put the shadows in your faceAnd who took them away againA great light put the shadows in my face Said he Because I hoarded it withinAnd boarded it up with sin Of my importance Because I would not dance with joy of it Like a brook prancing to the seaBut in a deep dark well Sealed the living spirit upWhat grace of it I could not keep I would not give away In playlike youDo we asked one closer than the rest And who is Grace from another troubled breast And what is sinSin is a stone Dreamed Judashis chin on a silky head Which when a seed is blown Upon itharbors not The desire of a flower in the seedThe Little Review 2Ã But must be broken by the showerAnd a deal of shiningAnd the bold clutch of coldGrace is the flower Of desire in the seedAnd sin is the stone that will not feed the flowerHere is a flower Said a Child with a daffodil And here is a stoneWill you show us how The stone won t feed the flowerYeswill you now chattered allJudas took the stone in one handAnd in the other raised a black leather bag That sagged from the girdle at his waist There is little grace in eitherAs much in one as in the other Murmured Judashelfting the leather bag OhI hear something jingle said a little blond brother Are they sins said his sister NOspoke a voice like the beat of a great wing On the air behind JudasThen a white light shone upon himThrough him spread the light So that no shadow of him fell Like night around the ChildrenAnd Judas looked upAnd saw Jesus standing there SeeChildren cried Jesuswith many smilesThe Little ReviewWhat the good Judas has brought you all these yearsSeemy dearswhat he has saved all the stony hilly milesFor you And Jesus opened the black leather bagAnd brought forth hands full of sweet bread Which he fed to the ChildrenThen Judashis hands sticky With crumby kisses of the Little OnesWent up the hill with the great LoverUnder the cover of His armAll harm gone from himThe Reader Critic Yeats sUpon a Dying LadyJ New YorkI wonder how many of your readers know that the Seven Poems by William Butler Yeats in the August number of The Little Review were inspired by and written about Miss Mabel Beardsleythe sister of Aubrey BeardsleyI remember when Yeats was writing themShe was dying of a lingering illnessShe was a Catholicand it is of course well known that Aubrey Beardsley became a Catholic before he diedArtistspoets and writers like Charles Shannon and Charles RickettsWBYeatsand other old friends of her brother and herselfused to take turns in visiting herSome of them made points of collecting their best and in some cases most improper stories for herI hope that she kept a diary and entered some of the stories in itWBYeats was tremendously moved by her fine spirit and gaietyThe Seven Poems were the resultThe Little Review The story is one that Meredith would have lovedAnd she was a joyous creature that Meredith would have loved had he known herThere was no wearing of black thereno making a luxury of her griefno flaunting it in the faces of otherseven though they might sympathize with or share her feelingsIt was all quite Frenchwhat a spirited French woman would doShe would have enjoyed the story published in the Letters of Meredith that an old Cornish woman told him A hunting Squire in her neighborhood had a very handsome wifewhom he valued less than the fox s tailOne of the Vivians eyed heradmiredcondoleddesired and carried her offSome days aftershe was taken with compunction or compassionand about midnight the forsaken squiresitting in his libraryheard three knocks at the window That s Bess he saidand let her inShe was for weeping and protesting repentancebut he kissed hertaking the blame on himselfrightlyand the house was quietOld Lady Vivianlike many old ladieshad outgrown her notions of masculine sentiment in these mattersshe said to my friend What are the man s family making such a fuss aboutMy son only had her a fortnightGargoyles An Old ReaderI have never been a real subscriberThe only copy of The Little Review I ever bought was the memorable March issue with Galsworthy s letter in itFor a long time after that The Little Review was my religionit converted me to a faith in New Americait inspired me to dreams and creative workIt was my first American sweetheartand as long as it remained such it aroused in me the whole gamut of love emotionsfrom passionate admiration to passionate hatredIt would pain me to become just a subscriberto manifest my attitude through a dollar and a halfBetter leave the ashes undisturbed by profane pokingOf late I have thought a good deal about the magazineI have been camping near the oceanand have spent some time in your various haunts of last summer where the natives still gossip about the Little Review crowdPlunging at night into the phosphorous surf and other delightful sinsmingled with communion with some Little Review worshippershas disturbed my academic calm and provoked my reveriesOne night I was awakened and perceived an apparition moving from the roaring sea toward my gigantic fireI heard a voicea wail HelpMargaret Anderson is murdering me Was it the spirit of The Review Review The Little Review For surely the spirit of the old Little Review is deadYou seem to be proud of your evolutionof the graves of your old gods that loom in your eyes like stepping stones to those heights where you bask in the wisdom of the EzrasI hope your new faith is as sleeve deep as your former acquired creeds For the beauty of the old Little Review The secret of its magnetism and appeal to Young Americalay in its youthfulnessits spontaneityin its puerilityif you wishFor puerility mates with originalityThe Ezras know too muchTheir minds are blackscarcely smouldering logsThey are yogisyou remember how Galsworthy hoped that you would escape the danger of becoming yogisAn Ezraized Little Review will have no appeal to Young AmericaShall I tell you that in my summer class I had students from various western states to the University of California because they saw my name in the catalogueand they associated my name with the old Little Review These worshippers are cold to the recent issuesAnd I sympathize with themThe new Little Review is gargoyliticmonotonously soWe can still enjoy a passage in Wyndham Lewisalthough Remy de Gourmont has said the same things more beautifully and less flippantlyWe are still grateful for such a jewel as Maxwlel Bodenheim sPoet s Heart Bodenheim is the greatest of all the Othersfor he does not suffer from self consciousnessfrom too much knowingBut it is Ezra who sprawls all over The Little Review and bedecks it with gargoylesMrPound is digestible only in the early miniatures Oh fan of white silkclear as frost on the grass blade I hope that you will soon tire of your over sophisticated associates and drive them out of the sanctuaryAfter all you are a rock you are still persisting at the impossible and the miraculousI am looking forward to the next stage in your evolutionAnd I send you my hearty greetingover the gargoylitic heads of your miseacresfor the next freshspontaneous Little Review This letter I think will find an echo in the minds of many of our first subscribersI have several faults to find with its point of viewbut one especiallyI cannot see why personal qualities such as freshnessspontaneityenthusiasmetc are in any way a gurantee for an interesting or important magazineBeing tempermentally spontaneousmy actions will always be characterized by impulsivenessetcBut I know that spontaneity will never help me to write an immortal poemYou must keep things in their proper correspondencesI very spontaneously accept the cooperation of a group of writers who can really writeLiterature is their mediumPlaying the piano is mineWhen I play the piano very beautifully to the original Little Reviewworshippersthey will know it is not because I am young and fresh and enthusiastic but because I know a great deal about how the piano should be playedI can t do such things to wordsWyndham Lewis does it in this issue in a passage Leonardo s beauty consisted in a red rain on the shadowed side of heads That is a matter of great proseAnd the only reason for a magazine of the Arts to be published is that it shall produce great prosegreat poetrygreat reproductions of sculpturepaintingand musicWe are going to have the latter as soon as possible MCA Phases of Crazes HLCChicagoI have just read your circular letter in which you state your aims and set forth your plans for the futureIt is the best written letter of the kind I have ever readBut I don t like your promisesso I am going to risk your Reader Criticthat at least is always interestingno one ever seems to be safe from youand tell you whyI wish you didn t have such a craze for foreigners and self exiled AmericansI think you have missed your chance right here in your own countryI am sure there are writers if you would go after them whoif they couldn t write so wellwould on the other hand be writing in a familiar manner about subjects known to us and in so doing be creating a literary tradition of our ownI am tired of these floods of RussianFrenchScandinavianIrish and Hindoo stuff that have swept the countryThe war will probably reduce the importation of foreign booksand I for one think this will be a good thingI should thing there might be room in America for one magazine which will print work just because it is goodno matter where it is producedAll we ask in this is to be allowed a choice of crazesTo us is seems that there is an indiscriminate craze in the theatrein booksin magazinesand even in exhibition roomsfor the American product with all its sins upon itLet your fears for the contamination or stifling from abroad of American letters be at restCongress and the established publisher have attended to all 34 The Little Review thatIgnorance is protected from invasion far better than the country itselfEach generation in this country is spared the shock of contemporary foreign masterpiecesWhen a masterpiece reaches Americaa generation lateTime has tempered it to the shornI happen to know something of Tagore s experience with this protectionWhen Tagore was firstdiscoveredin Americahe had been published in London and had with him only a few personal copies of his work he sent to his London publishers for extra copies to meet the requests of his friendsAside from a terrific tariffthe red tape and the questioning as to the integrity of his purpose in importing his own books proved too wearing an experiencethe idea was abandonedOn his recent trip he brought with him a small collection of very gentle Indian water colourswith no other motive than to create if possible an understanting of Indian art in this countryHis pictures were held up at the port of Seattlehe wa called again and again before inspectorsmade to swear all kinds of oathsand to deposit a fabulous sumsome forty thousand dollarsas I rememberto assure the government that his intentions were all rightAs he was leaving the country some one asked him if he ever intended making another visit there had been some agitation before this about including the Hindoo in the Oriental Immigration lawsand Tagore replied I do not knowYou will make a law against the Hindoo coming to your countryYou have now a law against booksIt may be you will make a law against poets coming too When the western nations have finished making the world safe for democracyif it wouldn t be too satirical the Orient might wage a world war to make the world safe for Artjh J Bury bloody Bodenheim
